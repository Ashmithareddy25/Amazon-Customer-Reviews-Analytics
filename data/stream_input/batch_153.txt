0140288503|4.0|The title proclaims that this is a &quot;Story of Modern War&quot;, which is completely true, as it is not a story of modern politics, weapons, foreign policy, African society or US Army.  It is the story of how all of these items come to play over a 48 hour battle which is the longest fire fight the US has been involved with since the Vietnam War.  The author, Mr. Mark Bowden has assembled the action through countless interviews with the many people that were part of the battle, even including those that fought against the US and UN task force.  The narrative flows in a manner which reflects its origins through the eyes of those that were there.  There are no digressions towards the history of Somalia, modern infantry tactics or attempts to pass judgment on the appropriateness of the mission.  Instead, the reader is quickly tossed into the firefight, seeing it through the eyes of the soldiers almost as if you could smell the gunfire and taste the Somali Chak.<br />The story is very well told, and while there are moments that additional background information would be beneficial, its absence does not seriously impede the overall quality of the text.  The story is very fast-paced and it is clear that Mr. Bowden has done his homework.  The final chapter, in which the author relates how he came to tell this story is both interesting and compelling. I don't know if the author would consider this a compliment (I hope it is taken as such), but many of the fight scenes read as if they were out of a Tom Clancy novel.  They are very well written, and the emotions of those involved is well committed to paper.  There aren't many military histories that make the reader feel the pain of a bullet-wound, the fear of a fire-fight or the confusion of battle, but here Mr. Bowden has succeeded marvelously.  The book creates even greater respect for the troops involved, Delta Force, Army Rangers and SEALS are already very well respected for good reasons. I particularly enjoyed the scenes where the Army Rangers realize that the high-tech armor-piercing bullets that they are using are in fact too good- the bullets are passing through the unarmored Somali opposition and not injuring them enough to stop them.  This is a particularly poignant metaphor for the entire battle.<br />So what, other than a great book, does this leave us with? It is unique to find a modern author that doesn't fill their book with pre-fabricated thoughts and opinions, but Mr. Bowden has done just that, allowing the reader to interpret this battle, the death of US soldiers that it caused and the socio-political system out of which it arose. (In this he is similar to both Anthony Birley, author of \\"Hadrian: the Restless Emperor\\" and Lisa Jardine, who has written two excellent histories of the Scientific Revolution and the Renaissance.) These are all important things to contemplate, which provides the reader with a book of strong merit not just for the story it tells, but also for the bigger portrait that it paints.es where the Army Rangers realize that the high-tech armor-piercing bullets that they are using are in fact too good- the bullets are passing through the unarmored Somali opposition and not injuring them enough to stop them.

6305784116|4.0|Aristocats is not the most classic Disney movie ever, but it is a classic to say the least.  It's great for all children, since there are no scary moments.  There are the usual memorable songs, and jokes for you to laugh at (of course!).  It's another fun Disney movie worth watching.  This is a great DVD, so don't miss out on buying it!
0064400557|5.0|&quot;Charlotte's Web&quot; is one of the books that I remember fondly from my childhood (as well as the several times that I've read it now that I'm nominally grown-up.)  Even though I know each time that I will cry, I can't stop going back to this story again and again.  Anthropomorphism can be extremely difficult to pull off, but I enjoy the fact that although the animals experience &quot;human&quot; emotions, they never truly stop acting like the animals they are.  The friendship between Charlotte and Wilbur helps to remind us that no matter how differrent we appear on the outside, we all can relate to ne another from what we hold inside.  The character are charming, the story is both poignant and fun, and the message of the book gets across clearly without bein heavy-handed.
6304712936|4.0|Amadeus is one of those movies where during some scenes you might laugh a little, and other times it's a total bore.  But other than that, it's still a good adaptation of Amadeus Mozart, and how he had such an attitude problem.  Overall, it's OK, but I really only recommend this DVD for people looking for history or music related films.
B00004TH7Z|5.0|This is a great album, When I first heard &quot;The Wicker Man&quot; I couldn't wait to get my hands on this piece. Especially since they didn't fire Janick Gers, who is in my opinion the missing link in Iron Maiden. They just Needed Bruce and Adrian again.  Like on their previos albums the only problem which I could detect was the lenght of some of the songs. Like Dream of Mirrors(Two minutes could be cut of), The Nomad(THree minutes chop off) and Thin Line beetween Love and Hate(3 Minutes could also be cut off).  The best songs on this album are without a doubt The Wicker man, Blood Brothers, Dream of Mirrors(Despit the lenght) and Out of the silent planet.  Now I'm waiting for the Maiden re-union. When Smpson, Burr and McBrain all play the drums. Di'Anno, Bayley and Bruce sing side by side and Stratton, Smith, Murray and Gers play together. Now that wold be great.
B00004R99L|5.0|Alice and Wonderland is wonderful in so many ways!  It's so fun and entertaining that it's hard to describe.  You'll get the songs stuck in your head!  OK, ok...  Just to let you know, if you want a DVD collection with classics, you'll definitely have to get Disney's Alice in Wonderland.  It's a great DVD with cool features.
0671042858|3.0|From time to time, King write something that the line between horror and a &quot;normal&quot; book is very thin. This is one of then, not a horror story (but there is a evil entity), is more like him, telling us how some parents are so self-centerd that they won't notice until way too late that their children are missing or anything like that. No gore, no scares, only the suspense of whether the girl lifes or dies (which i won't tell, so you go read it). Not a bad book, yet not one of his best work. What it lacks in horror made up in impressive descriptions and suspense. Buy it so you can have the King collection.
B00000G3PA|2.0|Armageddon is a...  sci-fi thriller (with big stars), which actually came after the way better and more emotional Deep Impact.  Armageddon is basically about the special effects (which are pretty good anyway), and the ending is kind of sad, but it's not as emotional as Deep Impact.  The acting is OK, but the plot is stupid!  Why would be get drillers and send them to an asteroid to blow it up?!  I mean, take some of the most inexperienced astronauts and depend on them to save the world.  OK, maybe I'm being a little too much, but if you want a better movie and a better DVD, then I'd recommend Deep Impact.
B000002KD9|5.0|Neil Young had recently had scored a number one hit as part of Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young with Deja Vu when he released After The Gold Rush.  The album is a brilliant collection of songs that have a strong sense of social commentary as well of heartbreak.  &quot;Southern Man&quot; is a strong condemnation of the redneck ideals of the South.  The song has a stinging guitar that perfectly complements the angry lyrics that are dripping with venom.  Songs like &quot;Tell Me Why&quot;, &quot;Only Love Can Break Your Heart&quot;, the sprightly &quot;Til The Morning Comes&quot; and the Don Gibson cover &quot;Oh, Lonesome Me&quot; deal with longing, loss and heartache.  The title track is a hauntingly, beautiful yet cautionary tale.  Mr. Young, singing over just a piano, lays out a song that turned out to eerily prophetic in the wake of what would occur in the 1970's.  The album was a triumph on every level and became his first solo top ten hit peaking at number 8 in late 1970.
0790731002|3.0|This is definitely not a very memorable Batman experience, but anyway, I enjoyed it somewhat.  The cast is good, the effects are cool, the plot is so-so, and it's often funny.  So I recommend this DVD, I guess, but not too much!
B000002KOG|3.0|Neil Young had recently left Buffalo Springfield prior to the release of his 1968 self titled debut album.  The album contains a bit of a carry over from his songs from the band and the songs are hit and miss, but their are flashes of the brilliance he would show throughout most of his career.  The album opens with a Jack Nietzsche instrumental, &quot;The Emperor Of Wyoming&quot; but then moves into the superb &quot;The Loner&quot;.  The song portrays the sense of isolation and despair that would tinge many of his future work.  &quot;The Old Laughing Lady&quot;, &quot;What Did You Do To My Life&quot; and &quot;Here We Are in The Years&quot; are other standout tracks.  The album is a fine debut for an artist who would take many twists and turns through a storied career.
B00003CXMG|1.0|This film is totally over rated.  What is so special about it.  I love rock n roll but this movie was just boring.  Is this supposed to be a comedy?
B000002KCV|5.0|Unlike most of his work with Crazy Horse, Neil Young quiets things down on Comes A Time.  The album doesn't feature the droning, crashing guitars that typify the Crazy Horse sound.  It has softer sounds and lush melodies like on &quot;Peace Of Mind&quot; or &quot;Field Of Opportunity&quot;.  The title track has a folk sound and &quot;Goin' Back&quot; is more upbeat sounding and has a country flavor.  &quot;Lotta Love&quot; has a pretty backing vocal from Nicolette Larsen who take the song to number 8 as a solo artist in 1979.  &quot;Human Highway&quot; and &quot;Motorcycle Mama&quot; both have great lyrics and are top tracks.  The album marked a return to the top ten for Mr. Young, peaking at number 8.
1891252089|5.0|Mr. Swenson's book is well organized and appears to summarize a great deal of the Ashtanga yoga system. However, what I'm learning most from the book is that I need to take some yoga lessons to really begin practicing. Very quickly the exercises become quite challenging, but I suppose much of that is due to the nature of Ashtanga yoga. The poses are very well photographed and annotated, and I imagine his book will make an excellent reference after I've learned a little more from an instructor. Not to sell myself short, but I can't imagine ever requiring a more advanced yoga manual. The book is very well constructed, with a very heavy cover and spiral binding. Highly recommended.
B000002KCI|5.0|Zuma was the first studio album that was credited to Neil Young &amp; Crazy Horse since his second release, Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere.  While various members of the band appeared on albums in between the releases, Zuma contains the power rocking sound that only the complete band could produce.  &quot;Barstool Blues&quot; is an underrated gem that has bluesy guitar riff that pops throughout the song.  &quot;Drive Back&quot; and &quot;Don't Cry No Tears&quot; have a grungy sound.  &quot;Stupid Girl&quot; is great song with a great vocal.  &quot;Pardon My Heart&quot; is an acoustic based number as is the closer &quot;Through My Sails&quot; which features Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash and was a leftover from the aborted sessions in 1974 that was supposed to yield the band's followup to Deja Vu.  The standout track on the album is &quot;Cortez The Killer&quot; with its droning guitar solo and vivid lyrics, the song is tremendous.
B000002A3T|5.0|Amazing simply amazing. An absolute master piece that could only be constructed by Pink Floyd. It will be hard to find another album that fits all moods. I listen to it every night and can't sleep without it! I lie in the dark and let the genius of pink floyd take me away into their world. I think that this album is the best one they have done so far! Its a must for open minded music lovers! E-mail me with your thought @ stephen_whatley@hotmail.com
B000003S0I|5.0|Ten to 15 albums in rock history are unlike anything that came before them, and have never been matched. Lark's Tounges In Aspic is one of them.<br /> King Crimson created a strange mix of Stravinsky, Jungle Grooves and abstract jazz here. The title suite builds from little nature noises to a wrecking ball Les Paul riff to an eccentric, thorny funk. Each part sounds like nothing else in popular music; yet it all fits together as organically as the verse, bridge and courus of a Brill Building song.<br />Book Of Saturday and Exiles are ballads--in theory. But the lyrics are so filled with wry twists, and the playing is so angular, any equation with pop proves absurd a few seconds into a first listen. The two songs seem to form a genre of their very own.<br />The second half of the album-&quot;Easy Money,&quot; &quot;Talking Drum,&quot; and the second part of the title track-further experiment with the hybrids layed out on the first half. Jazz solos are played  over strange animal noises. The violin is given a Mozart-like line while gongs are banged with chains. It is incredibly wierd,  incredibly fresh and incrediably brilliant.<br />If you are sick of the same old sounds, try this. &quot;But its from 1973!&quot; you say.<br />Yes, but rock has yet to catch up to Larks Tounges In Aspic.
0790729644|2.0|Unforgiven is a dark, grim film that doesn't stand out in any particular area.  Clint Eastwood's performance of the grim, aging gunfighter is typically one dimensional.  The subject matter -- taking revenge for a prostitute whose face was slashed -- is about as grim as it gets.  The cinematography couldn't possibly be more dark and depressing.  It's not a particularly bad movie, but certainly not a particularly good one.
B000002IHD|5.0|In the 1960s, R&B music was pretty much ruled (on the charts, at least) by Detroit and Motown records. As polished and sophisticated as it was, it still introduced many great Black singers to White America. Not far behind Motown's great work was that of Atlantic Records and its subsidiaries like Stax and Volt. Their vision of soul was something much grittier and rawer, and it wasn't afraid to make sadness exactly sound like that, gut-wrenchingly emotional. My vote for the most emotional soul singer of all time (and there are many) would be the late, great Otis Redding. In less than half a decade, Otis recorded some of the most spectacular and heartfelt soul music ever set to wax. Granted, a lot of Otis' albums were of the thrown-together variety a la Motown, but I kept hearing that OTIS BLUE (1965) was the best of the lot. It's the first one I've heard, but I can probably take the hype's word for it, because it certainly sold me on this legend of pop music in general. To say which song on here is the best-known would be a bit tough, but I'll take a guess and say that it's definitely \\"Respect\\". Otis' version was a top 40 hit and is a great listen in its own right. But we all know that Aretha Franklin practically owns that song now, and we can best say that Otis' version is a pale reminder of things to come. Next in line may be the fiery (and that's an understatement) \\"I've Been Loving You Too Long\\". Written with fellow soul legend Jerry Butler, Otis helps create 3 minutes of probably the barest emotions ever released on record, and is the epitome of chills down your spine. Another great Otis original is \\"Ole Man Trouble\\" (B-side to \\"Respect\\"). Most of OTIS BLUE contains Otis' versions of proven classics, some of which Otis manages to reinvent just like Aretha did for his \\"Respect\\". The Rolling Stones' legendary \\"Satisfaction\\" was a surefire plus for any soul singer, and Otis trumps their ace by replacing the famous guitar lick with a horn section. Otis doesn't exactly steal \\"Satisfaction\\" from Mick & Keith, but it manages to stand right alongside it, and that says a lot. B.B. King's \\"Rock Me Baby\\" was bedroom music at its raunchiest, and Otis once again takes a great song and makes it even better. It's the same story on Solomon Burke's (recently inducted into the Hall of Fame) \\"Down In The Valley\\". William Bell's \\"You Don't Miss Your Water\\" features a rare restained performance from Mr. Otis, and its slightly more country sound would prove it an appropriate cover for (of all groups) The Byrds. The only time Otis doesn't put up a good fight is on the Temptations' \\"My Girl\\". Maybe it's because I'm so used to hearing the Tempts' wonderful take on it, but Otis isn't too successful at de-Motownizing this classic. Still a good listen, though. One of Otis' fellow soul pioneers was Sam Cooke, and even he acknowledged Cooke's important contribution of bringing gospel to R&B music. He pays tribute to his mentor and dear friend with three Cooke classics: the stirring social anthem \\"A Change Is Gonna Come\\" (which I'm sure provided the soundtrack to numerous civil rights marches), the booty-moving \\"Shake\\" (Otis would later bring the audience to its feet with this song at the Monterey Pop festival), and probably Cooke's most infectious tune \\"Wonderful World\\" (don't know much about history...). R&B music has certainly come a long way since the soul-baring recordings of Aretha, Otis, Sam Cooke and Wilson Pickett. But music as cathartic as this is certainly hard to come by in this day and age of synthesized and overly-commercial R&B. However, OTIS BLUE is a great example of soul music when it was drawing more inspiration from the church than the charts.y steal \\"Satisfaction\\" from Mick & Keith, but it manages to stand right alongside it, and that says a lot.

B00000IZOR|5.0|The Chatter telephone kept my three occupied for a good part of their first three years.  Each child had one. It was a good pull-toy, it &quot;talked&quot; the child as it went (sometimes) bumping along and it gave the child great pleasure in hearing the ring as he/she dialed a number.  <br />It was small enough to take on trips and gave pleasure during the drive as well as during the visit to those of our destination (usually grandparents).<br />Now, I have grandchildren of my own, and can't think of a more suitable, companionable, comforting toy.  I do hope you will have more in stock soon.  I'll keep checking.<br />Thank you,<br />Mrs. Jo McGarry
B00005AXEL|3.0|The one we've all been waiting for. If you like Stevie just a bit or if she's your hero of life, you will NOT regret buying this album. Stevie rocks...<br /><br />10-08-2012 Edit - years later: While I was excited about this album when it first came out -see my skewed review above- it has not stood up to the test of time as have previous albums from Stevie. In fact, being brutally honest with myself, this is my least favorite album by Ms. Nicks. The newer \\"In Your Dreams\\" is a far superior album and much less \\"over-produced\\".<br /><br />This is not to say I don't like \\"Trouble\\" just that it's not the be-all, end-all of Stevie's music. Stars adjusted accordingly.
B00004RE7C|2.0|This is a great movie (like the rest in the series) that falls victim to Paramount Pictures typical piss pour packaging for DVD. This is common with all Paramount Releases that I have rented or purchased. Big on hoopla light on content, No behind the scenes, No commentary, No Story boards, No nothing except for a trailer, and foreign language support (isn't this on all DVDs? What so special about this?). Now I would expect this with a smaller release but this is Star Trek the mother of all Sci-fi Flicks. I really can't recommend buying, unless you don't already own it. Except for a little better picture quality than VHS, your not getting anything else. I think that maybe Paramount is saving real special features for a special edition, of course you'll have to pay 30% more for it. What a fleecing.
B00002DE2L|5.0|I am a first year in a small liberal arts college, and I bought this album and played it for my friends, not only have they learned to love, Anne-Sophie Mutter and Vivaldi, but they have a new apperciation of classical music. She places new life into a genre of music that seems to be taking a back seat in todays musical culture.  The Devil's Trill is a perfect accompanyment to The Four Seasons, and is perfomed magnificently.  All in all I feel that this is an absolutly wonderful recording of one of the best classiclal pieces ever composed.  Classical lovers and non-classical lover will enjot this album.
B00000255X|3.0|Dylan's writing here is less obscure, surreal and personal than the &quot;Blood on the Tracks&quot; album which preceeded it.  Here we see Dylan as more of a straight story teller.  These stories are sometimes compelling; &quot;Isis&quot;, &quot;Hurricane&quot; and &quot;One More Cup of Coffee&quot; but at other times ordinary and almost tedious; &quot;Joey&quot;, &quot;Sara&quot; and &quot;One More Cup of Coffee&quot; (again).      Musically the album is excellent with great violin playing and harmonies by Emmy Lou Harris.  I hope the &quot;Bootleg Series&quot; someday releases the live shows from the &quot;Rolling Thunder Review&quot; which featured many of the same musicians.  There are a few &quot;Desire&quot; songs from that tour on the &quot;Biograph&quot; compilation.     In most artist's repertoir this would be 4 stars, but compared to other albums by Dylan, who I think is the greatest songwriter since Mozart, I give it 3.
B000059Z8J|4.0|You've seen it before and you know it's a great movie. Well, the DVD magnifies that greatness by ten times. The video quality is, in a word, SUPERB. They really did a nice job of cleaning up the film. The audio is also spectacular. The 5.1 Dolby is mixed really well and there is a lot of rear speaker action. More than you'd expect from a film this old. There are a ton of extras on here and they are all entertaining. The three documentaries are especially informative.<br />The only reson that I don't give this 5 stars is that I think it was packaged very poorly. The cover art is less than spectacular and Warner Brothers NEEDS to stop using the snap-case. It's just ugly. <br />But don't let that stop you from getting this. As a matter of fact, if you own a DVD player you MUST own it. It'll blow you away.
052594527X|4.0|A great read.  This book encompasses the mysterious life of Vermeer at the sames time describes the purity of a young woman's love for a man.  It was most interesting to see how Tracy Chevalier described the turmoil of events Griet, the main character, had to face at the same time uphold her values. It was a true page turner...

B000050XEI|4.0|Enya is one of my favorite artists and i am familiar with much of her and her families music.  I have anticipated this release for 5 years now and i have to say that after listening for the first time i didn't know what to think.  Yes, it is very similar to her other albums, but at the same time isn't that what we are all looking for in her.  One of the reasons i liked her so much is because so much of her music was good.  It was consistant, and i loved it.  However there comes a time when i think it's important for artists to break out of their molds so to speak.  It would have been nice if &quot;A Day Without Rain&quot; had been a little more experimental.  Especially after waiting 5 years for it.  But, just because it is so similar to her other efforts, doesn't make it stale or repetative.  After listening to it a number of times i began to realize that this WAS what i wanted and that this new CD brought back the wonderful feelings that all her other music had in the past.  Perhaps one day it will be nice to hear a little experimentation in her style, but until then i'll keep on listening because her music is absolutely spellbinding.
B000059Z8J|5.0|After years of being treated like Warner Bros.' red-headed stepchild, Superman - The Movie has finally gotten the royal treatment.  While I am immeasurably disappointed in the studio's lackluster attempt to theatrically re-release this film a couple of months back, I couldn't be happier that it's in my DVD player instead.  I would buy this DVD for the extras alone.  Three, count 'em, three documentaries on the making of this film (which come off as more of a tribute to Christopher Reeve, which is fine by me!  If it had been anybody else in the suit, the film probably wouldn't have worked as well.), screen tests, trailers, deleted scenes, music cues and lots of text make this one of the more complete DVD packages.  Then there's the movie itself: widescreen digital transfer, 5.1 audio, enhanced visual and audio effects and additional scenes.  While this film does have it's flaws (the villains are too comedic - Otis is this film's Jar Jar Binks), it got so much right by taking the story seriously.  The documentaries will tell you how close they came to screwing it all up and you'll get an idea of how good Superman II would have been had Donner not been screwed.<br />Christopher Reeve and Richard Donner has made us believe that a man could fly all over again.  And I couldn't be happier about it.
0440180295|3.0|Kurt Vonnegut skillfully employs a cunning rhetorical strategy along with the clever utilization of repitition to create  poignant anit-war statements and a dark humor which overshadow his novel, Slaughterhouse Five.  While reading the sporatic plot structure, one ponders at the point of the unique rhetorical strategy.  Along with the simple diction and the intorduction of aliens from a distant planet, the reader begins to discredit the protagonist, Billy Pilrgim.  Throughout the course of the novel, the reader must piece together small segments of the novel seperated by time in order to achieve the intended message.  This carefully plotted strategy brings about the thought that the novel seems slightly insipid and silly.  However, one later realizes that this was Vonnegut's intent.  By adding the sporatic rhetorical strategy, the reader realizes the pointlessness and stupidity of war, much as he realizes the complexity of the rhetorical strategy.  The incessant repitition of phrases such as &quot;so it goes&quot;  along with countless other brief statements also contributes to the novel's message as a whole.  As people inevitable die in the war, the phrase &quot;so it goes&quot; is continually associated with their death.  The nonchalant attitude towards the death of another being is incorporated on the planet Tralfamadore, Billy's fantasy world.  While reading, a dark humor is aroused though the inept actions of Billy and through the almost humerous rhetorical strategy.  In conclusion, the novel utilizes rhetorical strategy and repitition rather than a decisive plot, to bring about its powerful conclusion that war is pointless.
1573225517|4.0|Two things I must say before I jump into my top five, a) I saw the movie, &quot;High Fidelity&quot; first, b) the real rating is 4.5.  Let's continue:   Top Five things that I liked about this book: 1.  I enjoyed the witty commentary and style of the novel.  It felt as if Rob Fleming was telling me the secrets of his life, opinions, etc.  It was like a modern, non-three day &quot;Catcher in the Rhye.&quot;  2.  The fact that every comment and opinion and statement about life, love, relationships, etc. I could relate to.  It was like one of those &quot;Did you ever notice?&quot; comedians where after every joke you're in absiolute agreement with the stan-up. 3.  The characters.  Like most readers I enjoy good charcaters.  Not interesting charcaters who do amazing or different things, but charcaters that you can relate to, feel for, and almost tak the place of, so to speak, during parts of the film, novel, series, etc.   4.  Everybody's favorite- the obbsessive, intelligent conversations between Rob, Barry, Dick (Sorry, jumping ahead, they're all characters that you'll recognize when you read the book).  It was funny to hear how music obbsessed some people could be.  It made you feel almost envious of their extensive knowledge about music, film, and novels.   5.  The &quot;tie-it-together ending.&quot;  The ending wasn't spectacular, and it probably should have been seven or eight, but it felt very soothing, and completeing, like the how the song played on the credits of a movie can in some way make the film more enjoyable, because it sets a mood or whatever.  I'm not going o ruin anything, but I guarantee a smile of approval and happiness after reading the last chapter or so.  <br />    &quot;High Fidelity&quot; was a funny, witty, novel that at some points dragged, but at most points was gratifying.  I rarely do this, but I'm going to have to say it:  this book I guarentee you will enjoy, even for a brief few chapters, but for most people, the entire novel is enjoyable.  Good Luck with it!
1577311523|2.0|I read this book and listened to the tape. Tolle is a gifted communicator of spiritual ideas. But Tolle is a man, not God, and remember: he's selling something. His main points, that we are not our minds and we should live in the present, are presented in the most clear and persuasive manner I've ever seen. I've found them enormously helpful. Yet, as a lifelong Lutheran, I am skeptical of the many &quot;spiritual truths&quot; he issues so declaratively. He also endorses &quot;A Course in Miracles,&quot; a New Age text supposedly channeled straight from God. It's time to start asking questions about his ideas. A good place to start would be Not Necessarily the New Age: Critical Essays, edited by Robert Basil. Other books about New Age thinking can be found in libraries. Just do a subject search on &quot;New Age movement.&quot; Don't just adopt religious ideas because someone states them in a soothing, authoritative way--and various celebrities thought the book was great. Your soul and mind are too important.
B000002LQR|5.0|I can't stop listening to it. A must buy.
B00000JJQK|5.0|For years, I often read about what a wonderful album this truly was. I was, like millions of others, well acquainted with and highly admired the radio favorites Wouldn't It Be Nice and Sloop John B. I often planned to purchase this CD, but I never got around to it until a few months ago.<br />After watching VH1's 100 Greatest Rock-and-Roll Albums of All Time, I witnessed that after the votes of many fans and critics  were tallied, Pet Sounds came in at an astounding Number 3, only behind Nirvana's Nevermind and The Beatles' Revolver, and the additional commentaries provided in the program concerning this release led me to thus conclude that this is definitely a must-have.<br />It is interesting that both The Beach Boys' Pet Sounds and The Beatles' Revolver were almost simultaneously released in 1966. These two works alone illustrated the evolution of synthesizing top-notch songwriting and instrumentation with highly expensive yet very creative musical productions.<br />Lately, as a longtime Beatles fan on one hand and as a person who has come to highly admire the genius of Brian Wilson on the other, I have been comparing Pet Sounds with Revolver. Yes, I think that these albums are equal in greatness and significance. However, I have come to enjoy Pet Sounds a little more. Even Paul McCartney has identified Pet Sounds as one of his all-time favorites and rightfully so. <br />Throughout their careers, the Beach Boys released other works that have come to be noteworthy pop standards but never at the level of this one. In a way Pet Sounds was and is a hallmark of both creative triumph and a series of what-ifs and what-might-have-beens. To me there are now two great mysteries in rock-and-roll history that will forever remain: 1. How successful and well-received would The Beach Boys' Smile, the highly anticipated follow-up that never came to exist, have been? and 2. What if Brian Wilson had a prolific partner within his group just as McCartney had Lennon?
079284632X|1.0|I am like the rest of you, hearing that this one of the most disturbing movies made out there and I was really psyched out about seeing the film, and so I bought it, I can tell you right now that that is the worst thing I have ever spent money on, this movie down right stinks, the picture quality is stinky (which is excused because its a 70s flick)- The acting was horrible, the only person in this whole movie who did a halfway decent performance was &quot;Mari Collingwood&quot;.  Please do not waste your money buying this movie, unless you are willing to sit through the STUPIDEST movie ever made-- It wasn't disturbing at ALL.  It wasn't disgusting at ALL.  Just like I said don't waste your money, I really wanted to like this movie but my brain just refused to watch such stupid stuff.  Need I say more?
B000009QPE|4.0|It worries me that people like Kyle K write reviews on music which they quite obviously don't understand. In all fairness Slayer don't come in the top ten of my favourite bands but qite simply if you have a tendency to want to thrash out then this album is probably the pinnicle of thrash metal. <br />This has its own pros and cons because of course to a degree you can say that Slayer make noise for the sake of making noise. But when you listen to the demonic,sped up, Iommi style riffs, as a guitar player (mainly rhythm) bought up the styles of Scott Ian and James Hetfield, you can only sit in awe when listening to King and Hanneman mkae those babies squeal.<br />The cons however are do you wnt to sit and listen to psychotic speed riff after peychotic speed riff. &quot;Angel of Death&quot; stands out as Slayer's defining riff according to die hard fans (although my fave is &quot;Reigning Blood&quot;) yet to me does not have the same song aura as &quot;Master Of Puppets&quot;,&quot;Hangar 18&quot;,or &quot;Efilnikufesin&quot; by the other famed thrash outfits(if you don't know who they are, go and do some research you uneducated heathens!)<br />As a fan of fast crunching guitars,I had to get this album, but if your actually after Thrash songs rather than Marvellous Mayhem Slayer might not be the band for you. I'm still buying &quot;Seasons in the Abyss&quot; and &quot;Hell Awaits&quot; though despite what Fonseca says!
B000002UAX|5.0|I picked up the CD(s) yesterday, after not listening all the way through the White Album in at least 10 years.  Even though I've recently completed reading all the way through The Beatles Anthology, and have listened to the albums along the way, I still was unprepared for this!<br />I'm still trying to grasp the experience of listening to all of these wonderful songs, and am so struck by the incredible talent of all the guys.  In one album, to go from Blackbird, and Martha My Dear, to Helter Skelter and Everyone's Got Something To Hide Except For Me And My Monkey (in which I just broke out laughing because it is so good!), is just astonishing.<br />And how about the finish?  To go on such an incredible musical journey, then get put through the ringer on Revolution #9, then immediately close out with Goodnight... well, it's too much!  Goodnight just broke me up into sobbing fits, even though I knew what was coming!<br />If you don't own this, do yourself a favor and go pick up a copy right now (or have amazon.com send you one!).<br />P.S.  I'm not sure why the reviewer named Fat somebody or another penned such a goofy review.  It seems like he wanted to be zany and have some fun, but it seems classless to make jokes about Lennon's shooting, and substitute a fatal crash by Harrison.  Absolutely disrespectful of the families involved.
0440180295|5.0|In his superb novel Slaughterhouse-Five, Kurt Vonnegut infuses into his writing a cornucopia of rhetorical strategies, including running motifs, the repetition of phrases, and vivid diction, to expose the mental and physical destruction caused by war and ultimately to convey antiwar sentiments.<br /> Throughout his writing, Vonnegut employs a plethora of motifs to present his antiwar position.  The colors blue and ivory both play a significant role in painting the picture that depicts the destruction of war.  Upon his departure to Dresden, the awkward hero of the novel Billy Pilgrim glances upon the body of a previous acquaintance dead on the cold, solid ground.  The man's &quot;bare feet were blue and ivory&quot; (148).  At another moment in the novel, Billy looks upon his own feet, only to find that they too &quot;were blue and ivory&quot; (72).  Vonnegut's clever choice of cold, impersonal colors invokes images of death, and, by using these descriptions in relation to the men involved in war, illustrates the suffering endured by fighters in the war.  Their flesh turns from a healthy, robust, and energetic shade to a stone - cold, remote gray.  Vonnegut also includes the motif of a lone dog howling.  In the midst of conflict, Vonnegut often inserts this unique motif.  On the doorstep of death, Billy Pilgrim can barely continue moving through the woods behind enemy lines.  While Pilgrim's companions constantly ridicule his weakness and threaten to desert him, they hear &quot;somewhere the big dog barked&quot; with a voice like a &quot;big bronze gong&quot; (48).  The connotation of emptiness conveyed in a lone dog's callings serve to accentuate the loneliness and mental isolation suffered by participants in war.  War severs the kinship bonds of men, abandoning and isolating them like the solitary barking dogs.<br /> By utilizing the repetition of distinct phrases, Kurt Vonnegut augments his overall theme of war's destruction and its effects on man.  Repeated oftenthroughout the novel, the term &quot;The Children's Crusade&quot; comes to symbolize and parallel World War Two, the war employed as one of the main settings in Slaughterhouse-Five.  In chapter one, Vonnegut discusses his own war and post-war experiences in first person.  Responding to the bitter remarks of a friend about his novel, Vonnegut replies that he will &quot;call it 'The Children's Crusade'&quot; (15).  By using this term in first person, and later in third person through other characters, Vonnegut creates a comparison between two extremely bloody historic events.  In both incidents, the youth of the world stepped up to a challenge that appeared valiant and heroic only to discover that their causes would result in bloody carnage and tragedy.  The reality hit the young men like a lighting bolt, changing them physically through wounds and mentally through the bloody sights that bred a pessimistic attitude and a disbelief in humanity.  The most prominent repeated phrase is the short, simple sentence &quot;so it goes&quot;.  Vonnegut follows every mention of death in his novel (there are approximately eighty) with these words.  In the war, &quot;a lot of people were being wounded or killed. So it goes&quot; (106).  This phrase highlights death as a major topic in the novel and accentuates decease as a result of the terrible and ravaging destruction of war.  The sentence is presented in a curt and understated tone that adds a dash of irony and ridicules the massive devastation caused by war.<br /> Vivid diction floods the pages of Vonnegut's novel and further compounds the horrendous and ghastly images of war.  Vonnegut metaphorically compares the war to a glacier.  &quot;There would always be wars&quot; and &quot;they were as easy to stop as glaciers&quot; (3).  With this choice of diction, Vonnegut presents war as an inevitable tragedy that will always persist in the world, always on a path of rampage, always leaving immense destruction in its wake.  After the bombing of Dresden, Billy Pilgrim and his fellow prisoners of war gaze upon the massive, almost unimaginable, ruin.  Vonnegut compares the once beautiful city with the surface of the moon; however, unlike the smooth curves of the moon, Dresden is littered with &quot;treacherous, jagged things - hot to the touch, often unstable&quot; (180).  Rather than attempting to romanticize war, Vonnegut uses his blunt descriptions to focus on the hideous reality of war.  Utilizing this specific diction, Vonnegut paints a blackened picture of war that emphasizes death and destruction.<br /> Clearly through his skillful employment of rhetorical devices, such as motifs, repetition, and diction, Kurt Vonnegut vividly depicts the devastation caused by war and suffered by man.  Vonnegut unmistakably utilizes his novel Slaughterhouse-Five as an antiwar piece of literature that investigates and explores the extend of damage, both mental and physical, endured by the innocent fighters involved in war.
B00004YKUY|1.0|I can accept change when it comes to bands and their front men with the best of 'em.  Journey's change...........I cannot get past this.<br />Why in the world would one go messing around with a formula like Journey had with Perry?  It goes back to the old saying &quot;If it isn't broken, don't fix it.&quot;<br />The songs are uninspiring at best save one exception. I did like &quot;We Will Meet Again&quot; simply because its words remind me of someone who I hope to...you guessed it, meet again.<br />The new &quot;Steve&quot; hints at Perry's styling but he cannot pull it off.  If change is what Journey really wanted, then they should have removed themselves completely from any Perry-esque influence.  I know, I know, easier said than done.  <br />Everyone was expecting to hear Perry, and when they got a doppelganger who only shows hints of the true Perry it just isn't going to work...and it doesn't work.<br />Overall a sorry effort by a once AWESOME band.<br />Don't bother with this one.
0399146253|5.0|THE LAST PRECINCT is the second in a series starting with Cornwell&#8217;s BLACK NOTICE...Both of these novels demonstrate Cornwell's crafty use of English and her ability to play on the emotions of her readers. She has the rare skill of inducing discomfort in the mind of the reader. She remains a talented writer.<br />Two points I need to make -- plus one warning:<br />One of the harsh criticisms directed toward THE LAST PRECINCT is the 70 (or so) pages of psychotherapy between Kay and Anna. As someone who was trained as a psychotherapist, I found the dialog particularly annoying. While reading this dialog, the following thoughts popped into my head: \\"Cornwell, what are you doing to me?\\" \\"What does this psychotherapeutic dialog have to do with anything!\\" Yes, I too was annoyed. Yes, the dialog seems disjointed and out of place within the context of the story. HOWEVER, (and here's the warning I promised) I bet the psychobabble provides a significant element within the third novel of this series. Cornwell, if you're reading this, don't let me down. Some will read the 3rd (yet to be named) novel for no other reason other than to discover how Cornwell ties Scarpetta's mental health into the resolution of the Le Loup-Garou storyline.<br />My second point deals with the Jaime Berger character. Initially, I thought Berger's actions were totally unbelievable. No prosecutor would ever consider the path that Berger took. With premeditation she deceptively violated Scarpetta's constitutional rights. As I read it, I thought, no prosecutor could get away with this. So, I asked a retired federal prosecutor about Berger's outrageous actions. Much to my shock, Berger's action in the novel represents the normal course of how prosecutors \\"set up\\" defendants prior to a grand jury hearing. In fact, he gave me examples of how he employed Berger's strategy in a bombing case he successfully prosecuted in Northern District of Texas. It's so unbelievable, it's believable. The bottom line is, Cornwell really did her homework for THE LAST PRECINCT.<br />...This is a good story. However, be prepared to read the third in the series.s, Cornwell really did her homework for THE LAST PRECINCT.<br />...This is a good story. However, be prepared to read the third in the series.
0913866156|4.0|The Aleister Crowley Thoth Tarot Deck was obviously carefully crafted with regard for the true meanings behind each card and for the feelings that each image invokes.  The deck is strewn with lush imagery and colorful symbolism.  My only complaint about the deck(and the reason that it only received four stars) was because they're a bit oversized.  It's quite difficult to shuffle with these because of their size.
B00004Z459|4.0|I don't like metal, yet the words from One Step Closer kept ringing through my mind and I waited eagerly for my sister to buy the album (as I knew she would). I was stunned when I listened to the CD. I don't like metal, I don't like rap, but the lead singer when he sings boy can he sing. Forget the comparisons to Limp Bizkit and Papa Roach, admittedly about half the tracks on the album sounds like that but there's so much more to Linkin Park than just loud heavy tuneless noise (no offence to people who like that sort of 'music' it's just not to my taste). <br />I'm going to say that some of their tracks are closer to Savage Garden, than to any of the aforementioned groups.   I doubt anyone could disagree with the similarities between the singers voices. When the songs have tunes they're brilliant with a hard edge that only the rarest of pop bands manage. <br />Everyone's heard One Step Closer by now I assume. I don't think I can add much more to what everyone else has said. Just don't expect the entire album to be like this. The tune and lyrics were great, it wasn't too heavy for my taste and thanks to an annoying TV advertisement I have both running through my head constantly. I could probably yell them non-stop if not for the fact my neighbours would undoubtedly complain. <br />I loved Crawling so much I'm likely to go out and buy the single, it's got a great melding of rap, metal and pop, and the singer does sound like he should be singing with Savage Garden at times. :-) More great lyrics and an amazing tune. <br />From the rest of the CD, (which my sister bought only yesterday and I've not listened to more than a couple of times) I remember liking the track after Crawling and  number 12 as well (hmmm Amazon doesn't say there's a track twelve, I guess I got some weird version. Though neither were quite as memorable as my favourites so don't ask me what they sound like. <br />I suppose I should have waited to review this but I figured I'd just get my first impressions out of the way with and try and give a different perspective. So four tracks I like on a 12 track cd, (and probably more I'll listen to if I give it a chance) for me that's better than average for new releases so it's getting four stars. I appreciate the mix of music on the album even if I don't like it all. If there was less loud screaming clashing tracks I'd have probably given it the full five, however then they wouldn't be Linkin Park.
B000002G85|4.0|This was Clapton's first solo album, and it is a fine record.  During Blind Faith's one and only tour, Clapton got friendly with the group that was opening for Blind Faith, Delaney &amp; Bonnie &amp; Friends, and it is this group of musicians that work on this album.  Also, Delaney co-wrote many of the songs with Clapton.  What results is a mix of southern-fried rockers (courtesy of Delaney's influence) and great pop tunes (Let It Rain, Easy Now).  The blues is virtually nowhere in sight, but that's OK, because the musicanship is awesome, the songs are strong, and the production is OK.  A bit short of true classic, hence the four star rating, but this album is a keeper.  Clapton stole the rhythm section from this band (Carl Radle, Jim Gordon and Bobby Whitlock) to form Derek &amp; the Dominoes.  One listen to this album will tell you why.
B000059Z8J|5.0|I was very impressed with this DVD.<br />This film has never looked better! It even looks and sounds better on DVD than I ever remember it being in a movie house.<br />The missing footage was fabalous! Especially the Lex Luthor &quot;baby&quot; sequences. They were very funny and well done. I had no idea why they did not make the original print.<br />As to the missing footage and screen tests, I was totally blown away on how well these were restored and preserved. No clicks, scratches or pops.<br />All and all, well worth the low price tag!
B000059Z8J|5.0|This comment is aimed at the Studio/distributor, i.e. Warner.<br />Why oh why do you encourage consumers to buy only half finished products. It is not as if this film is a recent blockbuster, but it was at the time a great film and even more so when you consider that it`s sequel was even better. Together Superman I and II were excellent pieces of entertainment. Forget III and Quest for Peace (not bad but nowhere near the same calibre). I along with many others would have thought that the first 2 in the series should have both been re-mastered etc. All I can imagine is that Superman II will be re-mastered due to public demand, then those poor consumers who bought the box set will be agrieved. This happened with Laserdiscs and also with DVDs (re-Kubrick). Greedy Studio is all I can say of Warner. Unless Warner announce a re-mastered Superman II, I will not waste my money as I consider the 2 films to be combined.
B000059R8Y|5.0|I heard &quot;Got You On My Mind&quot; first as an MP3 sample, and thought that the entire CD would be in that sort of bluesy mode--I was dead wrong.  Clapton moves from blues to rock and ballads easily, and even with the changes, the CD flows...it doesn't jar you at all.<br />I especially liked the instrumentals:  &quot;Reptile&quot; the one that opens the CD, and &quot;Son &amp; Sylvia&quot;, which is the closer.  &quot;Son &amp; Sylvia&quot; is a heartfelt tribute to his aunt &amp; uncle, and a wonderful piece of music that echoes the deep feelings of &quot;Tears in Heaven.&quot;<br />&quot;Reptile&quot;, is a term of endearment and respect--it's justly deserved when applied to Eric Clapton.
B00002DESX|5.0|Good god, I'd forgotten how great this record is.  I bought this record knowing nothing about punk, relying soley on how cool the cover looked.  My band immediately started covering &quot;Blitzkreig Bop&quot; and there was no turning back (I met Joey and Johnny when the band played Pittsburgh Circa 1980...with an an hour of free beer to start!)  This album cannot be underestimated.  These songs hold up almost better now than they did then.  If you remember this album from way back and haven't heard it in a while.. treat yourself!  If you've never heard this album proper; listen and be changed.  Either journey is well worth the price of admission.  Adios, Joey; we miss you.

B000001Y42|5.0|The title of this review were the words that were blaring out of every teenage boy's speaker systems in early 1998, when a Florida-based band called Limp Bizkit burst onto the scene with a hard-rock cover of the George Michael classic &quot;Faith.&quot; Although making a name for yourself by a cover song may not be the best method listed in the book, it worked for Limp Bizkit as they now have widespread fame. How could &quot;Chocolate Starfish&quot; listeners conceive that this whole thing started on an album called &quot;3 Dollar Bill Y'all&quot; that sounds drastically different?<br />I have found that this album actually gets better the more you listen to it. What you earlier dismissed as filler becomes apparent as more than that on the second and third listens to this all-out rocker of an album. This is rare for a Limp Bizkit album, which usually sound the same every time you put them in. However, this is Limp Bizkit back before they were trying to go commercial, and therefore this is different.<br />The first song &quot;Intro&quot; is certainly different than their &quot;Significant Other&quot; and &quot;Starfish&quot; intros. It seems a fitting lead-in to the next song, although they could have gone right into the next song rather than have a few seconds space. Limp Bizkit is well known for their track 2s being perfect starters, and &quot;Pollution&quot; is certainly one, although Fred goes on a little too long with the a capella screaming at the conclusion of this song. Then comes &quot;Counterfeit,&quot; which should have been their breakthrough, as it is an absolutely outstanding track, even with the instrumental filler-type stuff at the end which many of these songs possess, however these parts only add to the album. Imagine if Limp Bizkit had made &quot;Full Nelson&quot; back in 1997 with the same idea as Track 4 &quot;Stuck&quot;---it would have been huge. Then comes &quot;Nobody Loves Me&quot;, which is the reason why some people listen to this album inthe first place. After the first 5 tracks, you begin to wonder if Fred is going to lose his voice by the end of the album. However, he proves this theory wrong.<br />Track 6 is called &quot;Sour&quot; (a single) and is a slower song. It sounds like a carbon copy of &quot;Take A Look Around,&quot; only they didn't have any eerie background music to go by this time. &quot;Stalemate&quot; and &quot;Clunk&quot; are more of what was offered in tracks 2-5, only in a bit more sophisticated way. Then, of course, comes &quot;Faith&quot; with a hidden track after it that is decent. Next on the agenda is &quot;Stinkfinger&quot;. It is interesting hearing Limp Bizkit using constant dynamic changes, and I think it works here, although this is not one of the more well-known songs on the album. Then comes &quot;Indigo Flow,&quot; AKA Freddy Tries To Rap. They have Fear Factory as guests on this track, why waste it? Seriously, it is tough to believe that Fred did not know how to rap at all back then, as this is basically a shout-out song. Then comes &quot;Leech,&quot; which they swear is a demo, and is pretty doggone good for one, although all too short, barely breaking 2 minutes. The finale is the much-maligned &quot;Everything.&quot; Many Limp Bizkit fans hate this song, which is an insane 18 1/2 minutes long, and dismiss it as a filler. It is definitely not your typical Limp Bizkit song, and is more dreamy than anything you ever thought possible by this group. However, they do a good job on this basic instrumental, and the trance it draws you into is incredible. The music can get repetitive here, but what does it matter? It's obvious that this was intended to be filler, but it's too good to be considered that.<br />Overall, although Significant Other may have been more eclectic, and Chocolate Starfish more pop-pleasing, 3 Dollar Bill Y'all was what got the ball rolling for Limp Bizkit. You &quot;gotta have faith&quot; that they will return to crafting albums like this in the near future.

B000000JO3|5.0|What can I say about this album that hasn't been said?  The music is timeless, charged with youthful energy and earnestness.  I hope some of today's kids, bombarded with boring, weak music, false and glamorous images of drugs and alcohol, and constant discouragement from peers and adults will listen to records like this and be inspired to change and take control of their lives like I was after hearing this album.  Although I grew up almost fifteen years after most of these songs were recorded, they affected me profoundly because I knew that others had gone through the same problems and had faced them head on and made some of the most direct, immediate, and exciting music I had ever heard.  Well worth a listen regardless of your age.

B00004YW6I|5.0|PJ Harvey's music has always been phenomenal, and this one is no exception. Stories... is a wobnderful record and as great as any album PJ has created. It may not be as atmospheric as her lost two masterpieces, but it has some earth-shattering moments and basically, it is just wonderful songs, each and every one of the first 10 a #1 single in an ideal world. Songs such as &quot;Big Exit&quot;, &quot;kamikaze&quot; and &quot;This Is Love&quot; are furious and edgy, while songs such as &quot;One Line&quot; , &quot;Beautiful Feeling&quot; and &quot;This Mess We're In&quot; (all with the participation of grand Thom Yorke) have a profound sentimental value, equal of past triumphs such as &quot;Teclo&quot;, &quot;The Dancer&quot; and &quot;The Garden&quot;, even thoiugh they are completely different songs. This album is less avant-garde than the previous two, with the lyrics still being confrontational  and personal(&quot;We Float is a gem full with wonderful lyrics and the inspirational &quot;one day we'll float, take life as it comes&quot; ) sonal and the music simple and beautiful. PJ Harvey has created another record-of-the-year (along with radiohead and KID A, but for entirely different qualities that one)and proves that she is the most prominent and charismatic female singer of the past decade and for a couple more to come.
B00004XOWM|3.0|In the album that is &quot;Chocolate Starfish and the Hotdog Flavored Water,&quot; hard rock fans are left asking what happened to their genre. Although this CD does feature a number of highlight tracks, it is clearly meant for a much more pop audience and some singles have even been in regular rotation on pop radio recently.<br />The album can be divided into two sections (pretty much): Section 1 (up to track 7) is where there is all-out anger on the tracks, and Fred shows off his unlimited ability to say the F word. The second half: (tracks 8-14, the obvious filler outro doesn't count) is a slower half with either slower songs or R&amp;B-flavored rap tunes featuring special guests.<br />The album starts off with the entertaining &quot;Hot Dog&quot; (although it insults a great song, Nine Inch Nails' &quot;Closer&quot;) and then delves into &quot;My Generation&quot;, although if Fred Durst is the spokesman for our generation, we're very screwed. Next up is &quot;Full Nelson&quot; which sounds exactly like &quot;Stuck&quot; from 3 Dollar Bill Y'all, followed by the hit singles, &quot;My Way&quot; (which I feel is the highlight of the album) and &quot;Rollin' (Air Raid Vehicle.)&quot; Then &quot;Livin' It Up&quot; rounds out Part 1 of the album, although putting back-to-back tracks on the album about how cool they are may not have been the best PR decision Limp Bizkit has ever made.<br />In the second half, we begin to see why this album was over 70 minutes long. &quot;The One&quot; shows us a side of Fred we have never seen before (relationships), but did we really need the bonus track and the silence after it? What the second half of the  album seems to be to me is a lot of silence to extend tracks and stretch out the album, which makes it clear this album was hastily prepared. This is followed by the rap-flavored &quot;Getcha Groove On,&quot; where Xzibit shows that Fred Durst needs a lot of work before he can be classified as a half-decent lyricist. Then comes &quot;Take A Look Around&quot;, the MI2 theme, which of course is a great song because it was from the &quot;Significant Other&quot; days. This is followed by &quot;It'll Be OK&quot; and &quot;Boiler&quot; (very slow for Limp Bizkit, and Boiler again has almost a minute of silence after it). Let's not get into the god-awful rendition of &quot;Hold On&quot; with Dave Weiland of the Stone Temple Pilots, or I'll have to dock it another star. Then comes another total time-waste, the remix of Rollin' featuring DMX, Redman and Method Man, which gets old after around 45 seconds but is a full 6 1/2 minutes long. (The filler strikes back again). Then comes the hilarious outro, but again, the filler strikes back...the outro is 2 minutes and something seconds long, so why do they need to punctuate it with 7 1/2 minutes of laughing? Come on, that's time for two extra tracks, and if you make them good, who knows?<br />This album shows Limp Bizkit's clear intention is to go pop. Hopefully future albums will not be as hastily prepared so we can enjoy at least flashes of early Limp Bizkit.
B000009RC2|5.0|I'd be tempted to agree (at least tentatively) that THE INNER MOUNTING FLAME is the best fusion record ever made were it not for the record that succeeded it. Some remember THE INNER MOUNTING FLAME more fondly than BIRDS OF FIRE because it came first--historical happenstance. Some may have been disappointed that  BIRDS OF FIRE didn't diverge from THE INNER MOUNTING FLAME as much as THE INNER MOUNTING FLAME diverged from the records that came before--unreasonable expectation. Many, however, are simply incapable of appreciating the Mahavishnu Orchestra in its purist and highest form. Compositionally, BIRDS OF FIRE is a development from and an improvement on THE INNER MOUNTING FLAME. <br />1) &quot;Hope&quot;'s arpeggio pattern is obviously based on &quot;The Dance of Maya&quot;'s. Whereas &quot;The Dance of Maya&quot; stoops to repeating redundantly a chord member to fill out its 10/8 meter, &quot;Hope&quot;'s 7/4 meter is completely natural and convincing.<br />2) &quot;Thousand Island Park&quot; is obviously based on &quot;A Lotus On Irish Streams&quot;. Whereas &quot;A Lotus On Irish Streams&quot; depends on improvisation to breathe life into a sketchy and harmonically conventional compositional fragment, &quot;Thousand Island Park&quot; is a remarkable composition in its own right:<br />3) &quot;Birds of Fire&quot; is obviously based on &quot;Meeting of the Spirits&quot;. Whereas in &quot;Meeting of the Spirits&quot; polymodality and polyrhythm are only--more or less--intimated, in &quot;Birds of Fire&quot; they are fully worked out and impressive.<br />In fact, quite a bit of THE INNER MOUNTING FLAME is compositionally tentative. In BIRDS OF FIRE only &quot;One Word&quot; is. (&quot;One Word&quot; is Billy Cobham's vehicle, so I suppose I can't really fault it. By the bye, on this cut Jack Bruce--not credited on the original sleeve--replaces bassist Rick Laird.) But don't get me wrong: THE INNER MOUNTING FLAME is GREAT, and &quot;Noonward Race&quot; rocks harderthan anything on BIRDS OF FIRE.<br />Also recommended: Mahavishnu Orchestra: BIRDS OF FIRE, Shakti: NATURAL ELEMENTS.

B00003CXQY|5.0|&quot;The Emperor's New Groove&quot; is one of the lightest, most fun, and hilarious cartoons in recent memory. And no, this one, unlike recent Disney movies is not an animated motion picture...it is a cartoon, plain and simple. A cartoon that breaks almost all of Disney's regular rules. What do I mean by that?  What is the normal Disney formula? Musical numbers. Love story. Beautiful heroine. Handsome, strong hero. Touching morals. &quot;The Emperor's New Groove&quot; has none of that (almost)! In this story, the lead character is a nasty S.O.B. for most of the movie, and his lovable sidekick is the true hero. And the only possible moral, about how it's more important to be a good person than a powerful leader, is so subtle and underplayed that it's almost non-existent. No, this movie does not exist to give lessons to children or to display the usual classic coming-of-age story Disney is famous for. This movie exists purely to entertain with animated shenanigans. And when I said &quot;cartoon,&quot; I meant it. Not in a long time has there been a Disney movie where the characters practically KNOW they're cartoon characters. These characters gleefully flaunt their ability to exist in a world where they could run off a cliff, keep walking, realize there's no ground beneath them, look at each other, then at the audience, and then...fall. Just like an old Warner Bros. or Chuck Jones cartoon! This film really recaptured all the fun antics that cartoon characters can have because they do not have to abide by the laws of the real world. They can turn into other creatures. They can crash into walls and never get hurt (even though their faces might get flattened), etc. etc. At one point, the main character even interrupts the movie, steps in front of the cell, and starts drawing on it like a storyboard. That reminded me so much of the old Looney Tune where Daffy Duck is drawn into tons of different scenes by a wisecracking cartoonist who turns out to be Bugs Bunny. Disney doesn't seem to have had this much fun since the Genie from &quot;Aladdin&quot; and &quot;Who Framed Roger Rabbit.&quot; If you're in the mood for a fun cartoon, I'd especially recommend this movie to adults who are fans of Looney Tunes, Chuck Jones, Hannah Barbera...anything on the Cartoon Network. Remember, you are not seeing a kid's movie. But a glorious, wonderful...cartoon! And if you are going to buy it, you must buy the 2-Disc &quot;Ultimate Groove&quot; set. It is amazing, with an entire extra disk that is literally a &quot;film-school-in-a-box&quot;. It leads you through the entire process of creating a cartoon, from storyboards to sketches to the finished product. You see cartoonists, the actors who do the voices, and get to see the insides of the Disney studios. You don't even get this close on the tour of the animation stuidos when you go to Disney World.  It is truly a fascinating, very detailed look at the making of a movie. The packaging is also wonderful. The cover art is some of the coolest I've ever seen for a DVD. I'd rank it up there with &quot;Fight Club&quot; as the best cover art for a DVD available now.
B00000637V|5.0|Is it still a well kept secret that Berlin is the definitive Lou Reed?  This was not inauthentic posturing:  Was he struggling to transcend the melodramatic borderline sadomasochism and adolescent confusion of identity in his everyday Warhol life on drugs, or was he still embedded in it?  Coney Island Baby thankfully confirmed the former.  Difficult as the entire epic can be to really hear, it is a cautionary masterpiece of dark love and urban angst.  No real music addict could do much better than hearing How Do You Think It Feels fade into Oh, Jim, or than feeling the conflict of orchestral purity of heart and abject vocal confusion and misery in Caroline Says I, among the sweetest foolish testosterone that ever whined on vinyl convinced it was handcuffed to mutually destructive love.  This is the one pivotal Lou Reed album, of a single social worker's piece, that rewards the effort to understand the tenderness of ultimately stable beasts -- and to understand why PBS's American Masters already devoted an episode to Lou Reed's life and music.
6305807086|5.0|This is one of the very rare films that keeps alive my hope that there is some originality left in film-making. At a time when it appears that every second movie coming out is eiter a remake of some sort or features an unimaginative deadbeat plot, Spike Jonze's film comes as a fresh breeze of original thinking. What a script! What great actors! I am tempted to say very little about the actual plot, because this movie is even better when you have no idea what to expect, just as I did when I first saw it. The plot is outlandish to the extreme, yet the superb acting of John Cusack, Cameron Diaz and John Malkovich carries this tale along so effortlessly that even the most bizarre of circumstances seem to fall into place quite naturally. Buy this DVD because you will want to revisit this film often!
0792156684|2.0|I saw this film in the theater, and it was o.k.  The effects were neat, considering they came from James &quot;Terminator, Aliens, Abyss&quot; Cameron.  Two things ruined the film for me.<br />First, the characters seemed very simple and empty.  Most of the characters in the film were introduced in the first 10 minutes and then disappeared for the next two hours until they died, yet the film was acting as though we should care.  I think the film would have been much better as 3-4 different character stories rather than as one love story.<br />The other thing that ruined this film was the hype.  I, fortunately, saw it opening night.  I enjoyed it.  The next several months it was painful to see how people obsessed on this film.  I'm sorry, but the love story wasn't THAT good.  It was contrived from 19th century British literature.  The rich woman is supposed to marry the jerk, but is in love with the poor free spirit.  Puh-lease.  It's a friggin' Gilbert and Sullivan opera.  I was waiting for Leo to say, &quot;Ha Ha!  But I am rich after all!&quot;  It was almost that bad.<br />I didn't think it was so bad the first time I saw it, but I lost a lot of respect for this film when people thought it meant SO much.<br />...and please, can they release a version of the movie without Celine Dion?<br />If you Really liked this film, you will probably enjoy watching Mission to Mars, City of Angels, and Bloodsucking Freaks ;)
0393312836|3.0|The novel A Clockwork Orange written by Anthony Burgess is a disturbing but realistic view of the world.  The main character, Alex, is a violent teenager who enjoys bringing pain to other humans.  He is not scared by the law or threat of jail time.  The only action that has any affect on Alex also takes away his free will.  Through the treatment Alex is turned into a zombie and can no longer think for himself nor can he act on his thoughts.  Eventhough the treatment turns Alex into a non-violent human he is no longer his own person.  The question that came to my mind while reading the book was, is it better to be forced into being a good person, or be yourself?
0393320928|5.0|&quot;What do you care what other people think&quot; might not be as fast-paced and full of as many laugh-out-loud anecdotes as &quot;Surely You're Joking&quot;, but it's just as entertaining, and even more thought-provoking. The first half of the book is much like Surely You're Joking. It's a series of funny and touching stories and recounted adventures. The second part of the book details Feynman's work investigating the Challenger explosion in 1986. Despite how it sounds (and the opinion of another reviewer), it's not boring at all. In fact, it's absolutely fascinating. It's not just a description of the investigation, it's like a detective story, complete with mystery and deception and finding clues and following leads and beating the system. It also serves to demonstrate both Feynman's brillance and his ability to make just the right kind of trouble. Feynman, having been dropped out of his science element and into the bureaucracy of Washington, shows his wonderful childlike way of encountering new situations. Instead of going by the book and doing what he's told like many of the other commissioners, Feynman goes on his own one-man mission to solve the case. On the way, he discovers a lot of cover-ups and curious mistakes, which, when we remember that they lead to the haunting Challenger explosion, are awfully creepy. I think the Challenger investigation stuff is the most inspirational of Feynman's memoirs so far. What he reveals during his investigation is shaking; not just the incidents themselves, but what they say about human nature. Even more shaking is the realization that most of us never stop to question the status quo, even when it smells fishy. While the rest of the commission was on guided tours of Kennedy, Feynman would sneak away, against the wishes of the people in charge, to interview the lowest assembly workers. It's an example of how we all should be; always doubting, always finding out answers for ourselves, and always curious. Oh, despite being inspirational and all that, it's extremely funny!

B00005AR3G|4.0|This DVD has been a real surprise hit with our family since my Mom came into town from across the country and wanted to stop and buy something for our son. The 'New Gwoove' as he calls it wasn't advertised as well as it could have been in the movies, but its got a stellar cast including the hilarious David Spade as the llama. David Spade really steals the show in this DVD with funny comments, outrageous situations, as well as playing off the fact that going from being the emporer into being a llama just is not what it is all cracked up to be. <br />After getting turned into a llama this story takes the viewer on an adventure that is clever, fun, with lots of characters getting in the way, out of the way, and generally making a big mess. The animation is clever and, of course, the music is good too. <br />Its a real departure from the standard disney film (love story romance), but enjoyable regardless. In fact, its kind of nice to have a fun disney film that doesnt fit into the standard mold. The movie is laced with adult humor similar to the stuff that is in Toy Story and Toy Story II. Both your kids and the adults should find something to enjoy in this film.

B000003FPN|5.0|On the evidence of this one CD, I reckon Chicago must have been the place to live in the 1950s.  What a superb orchestra!  What an ideal sound venue the Orchestra Hall, Chicago must be!  The CD is also testimony to the greatness of conductor Fritz Reiner and the astonishing results obtained by the producer and recording engineer.<br />While listening to each of these items of Czech music, I had the feeling that the performances satisfied me on all counts.  The wish to re-hear other recorded performances never obtruded.  Above all, there was the way that Reiner, like all great conductors,  controlled the balance of sounds.  Instead of a mush of sound, tiring to the ear and stultifying to the mind, there were clear aural perspectives, delighting the ear and refreshing the mind.  I like a conductor who can make a large orchestra easy to listen to.  Reiner left me in no doubt that Smetena wishes the first violins at Bar 31 to enter fortissimo while the second violins continue &quot;sempre pp&quot;.<br />This  CD should be proudly featured in every residence in Chicago, and in most others throughout the world.

This sound is now and is designed to appeal to the youth of today. It's here to stay.

B00000DC4A|5.0|I came to this party late, but glad I finally got there. I have long been a Bryan Adams fan but sort of fell out with the movie soundtrack stuff. I recently picked up this now 3 yr old CD and WOW!!!!! This is truly best of past, present, and I hope the future Bryan Adams. I have been listening to the CD incessantly for 3 weeks and just do not tire of any of the songs. It flows so smoothly with a mix of rockers, mid tempo, some ballads, and a mature subject matter content coupled with still youthful music. This CD clearly got lost in the shuffle of various factors. It is not too late...go get it and make believe it came out today...it sure sounds like it.<br />For those of you who admire audio production values, the CD is of spectacular production quality. The wonders of digital audio production are abundant here. Turn it up and let it crank...you will love it! Also novel is the way the disc flows, at times almost concert like in the way one song merges into the next. This creates a very nice effect.<br />Get this CD....5 Stars ...no question!
B000059Z8J|5.0|Well, the release of the original Superman movie is long overdue, but I must say it was worth the wait.  The movie is remastered and restored so beautifully, it's almost hard to believe.  I was amazed by all the extras that come on the disc (behind the scenes, special effects demos, screen tests, etc.)  This DVD is a must have even if you are not a big fan of the movie (although I don't know how you couldn't be.)  Unfortunately, the case is a little flimsy.  You would have thought the DVD would have been packaged in a firm case but it's not that big a deal.  Anyway, this DVD is fantastic.  Gives me goosebumps.
0553106635|3.0|After a long wait, ASoS was finally available in the book stores in the Netherlands. But only in Trade Paperback, which I very much regretted. With the highest expectations I started reading, and I must admit, I was disappointed. The book is really good, but slightly slower than the first two. GRRM is still very original in his style of fantasy, the dark flavor, the sense of dread, knowing that there might not be a happy ending is great, but this third part was just an elaboration on the second. The only really surprising part was indeed the very ending, but that left me with a sour depressed feeling. The book is not as good as the others, but I hope that the other three will be better and this third book was only a sort of &quot;shifting of focus&quot;.
B000001ESF|5.0|Originally released in 1979, this record, today, still stands out as one of the most influential albums of all time.<br />This apocaliptic, time traveling journey through time and space is both musically and lyrically perfect.  From the opening of the future to the destruction of the Tempals, Rush have created a masterpiece.<br />The story starts with the introduction of the priests who control the lives of all people under the rule of the Federation.  Our narator than pops up and picks up the story, in short he likes to wonder off and go looking behind waterfalls, in this cave he then finds something which we later discover to be a guitar, and, after a really quick lesson he takes the guitar to show the priests, unfortinatly for him, the priests do not share his joy and see this old fashioned gadget as a waste of time and a really good excuse for freedom of expresion.  Not putting up with this Father Brown smashes the guitar and sends our narrator away.<br />After a solum walk home the narrator has a vivid dream about past times when people had the freedom to express themselves and were not under the controle of the priests and the federation.<br />Compleatly disheartend the narrator wanders of to his cave behind the waterfall and broods for several days, it is here that he realises that he cannot live within the confinds of the Federation and so in tolal despair desides that in death he may have what he dreams of, passing into the world of his dreams, to a place of freedom.<br />This story is well crafted and takes all of side one of the album, or the fist song, if you are one of them CD types.  On side two the theme of life is continued over with five more songs, all different in there own right but with a common underlying theme, Life, it's a Funny Old Thing<br />I a law was passed that stated albums that people must own this would be one of them.  2112 has been fully re-masterd so even if you are an old die hard fan like myself you, or are new to Rush this record is for you!
B0000042MY|5.0|Trevor Jones and Randy Edelman scored big with their collaborative efforts in the making of the musical soundtrack to &quot;The Last of the Mohicans.&quot; Their efforts prove successful: the music is as moving and brimming with life as the movie itself. The score moves along at different paces to match the intensity of certain scenes, from the glorious opening credits sequence with its sweeping visuals of the mountains, to the slow-paced, building intensity of the battles between the French and British. Jones and Edelman are able to bring out the important aspects of emotion and feeling so intrical to the movie's success. This is one score that remains highly regarded.
B000002UAC|5.0|One of the great things about the CD revolution back in the '80s was when EMI/Capitol decided to re-release all the Beatles albums on CD in the original UK versions.  Naturally, I felt Capitol had ripped me off when I heard the CD versions and realized I had been swindled by Capitol's US versions.  Capitol did a big butcher job on &quot;With the Beatles&quot;  (starting with the title change- &quot;Meet the Beatles.&quot;)  Some of the songs on the US version weren't on the UK version.  &quot;I Want to Hold Your Hand&quot; was not inteneded to be put on an album.  &quot;I Saw Her Standing There&quot; was on the UK &quot;Please Please Me.&quot;  Some of &quot;With the Beatle's&quot; tunes didn't see the light of day until Capitol released it's next bastradized Beatles album, &quot;The Beatles' Second Album.&quot;<br />Enough belly-achin', but, man, &quot;With the Beatles&quot; is a great album.  It was wonderful to hear it the way the Beatles intended us to hear it back in 1963 (too bad I didn't hear it the way it was intended to be heard until 1987!)  The album really isn't all that different than &quot;Please Please Me,&quot; some original tunes and some cover tunes.  However, the second album shows the Beatles becoming the studio band which, in less than four years, would release &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; unto the world.  Lead vocals are double-tracked throughout.  More care is observed with the recording quality and texture of guitars, bass, and drums.  Overdubbing is obvious.  George Martin is guiding the Fab Four in a crash course of studio technique.  <br />The songwriting is getting better.  John and Paul are obviously singing lead on the songs which, individually, they wrote the bulk of the lyrics for.  This is different from the &quot;let's share the mike we're playin' our Cavern set&quot; approach which the band took of their first album.<br />I think it's instructive to listen to this album and compare it with its follow-up, &quot;A Hard Day's Night.&quot;&quot;A Hard Day's Night,&quot; is one of the Beatles' absolute best albums.  The studio techniques and songwriting skills apparent on &quot;With the Bealtes&quot; would come to fruition with its follow-up.  The Beatles never made an album under 5 stars.  &quot;With the Bealtes&quot; is an essential album by any standards.
B000053VAF|3.0|Kevin Smith is, in My opinion, the new Millenniums answer to Orson Welles, \\"Clerks\\" will go down in history as his \\"Citizen Kane\\" as it was his First film, he Wrote, Directed and Acted in it, it was Controversial and he will Probably Never Top it.<br />\\"Dogma\\" is Kevin's most Ambitious film to date, and it ranges from Infinitely Clever to Irretrievably Crap, some scenes Fly by, some scenes Crawl, some Performances are Spot On, some are Cringe-worthy. We All know he is a Talented Writer, but his Directing skills are Far from Polished. No Tricky Camera work, no Imagination in the Shots, he just Points and Shoots. With all of his Previous films, he could just blame the Lack of Budget as the reason the Production wasn't Top Notch, but Here, he has no Excuses. An A-List Cast, a Good Budget and a Bucket Load of Potential... Kevin's Script and Directing are the Letdowns.<br />Now to the Performances... I'll Start with the Great ones. <br />Ben Affleck and Matt Damon may play Fallen Angels in the film, but for Kevin Smith, they are a God Send. They make his Dialogue sound Great and when they are on the Screen, the Film is at it's Best. Jason Lee is a Close Second, (Ben and Matt tied for First) as he and Ben have worked with Kevin a couple of times before, (\\"Chasing Amy\\" and \\"Mall Rats\\") they know how to deliver his dialogue. They are to Kevin what Laurence Olivier is to Shakespeare. Alan Rickman comes off Next Best, every time he was on screen; I had an Ear-to-Ear smile. Jay and Silent Bob are as Good as Ever, their Comedic Styles are as Fresh as Ever and they don't look like they'll be getting Dull any time soon.<br />The Same cannot be said for Linda Fiorentino, Salma Heyek or Chris Rock. They have been given Large Quantities of Dialogue which could Easily have been given the Chop, it Embarasses them and Bores the Audience. Every time they open their mouths, Biblical Speeches follow and It slows the film to a Crawl. Especially Chris Rock, he does his best with the films Worst Lines, not even Eddie Murphy could have saved This Character.<br />Overall, it is Worth Seeing. Opinions of \\"Dogma\\" Vary like you Wouldn't Believe. To some It the Best Movie Ever, to others, it's the Worst. You just may be One of the Many who Adore it.

B00003CWL6|2.0|Pitch-perfect dialogue, amazing performances, solid direction, glowing cinematography - American Beauty has all of these things.  Yet the whole is less than the sum of its parts. It aspires to European complexity while paradoxically wallowing in American sensationalism.  It tries to paint a subtle moral landscape with a gallon of latex semi-gloss and a roller, with lurid supporting characters that could have come from Ricki Lake's green room.   <br />By now everyone knows that the story centers on Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey), whose life has become an empty, materialistic nightmare with his disrespectful daughter and frigid wife (Annette Benning).  He changes things - a bit too drastically - and ends up becoming a blackmailer, a drug user, and a would-be pedophile.  That he changes his mind at the last minute and doesn't have sex with the teenaged girl, that he ends up martyred because the next-door neighbor thinks (through a bizarre misunderstanding) that he's been taking sexual advantage of his son, that he has some New-Aged revelation about the Circle of Life as he's dying...well, all that's supposed to make him OK.  <br />If American Beauty had committed to making Lester either a villain or a hero, it might have worked better.  Instead, it asks us to see him as a flawed, complex man - and forgive him.  That might been possible, had this loopy, creaky, arbitrary series of plot devices not been employed in place of a real story. <br />For every theme explored in American Beauty, better films exist.  Either film version of Lolita, for example, develops the theme of middle-aged crisis coupled with pedophilia far more logically and empathetically, and without resorting to an unconvincing, last minute change of heart to &quot;redeem&quot; the main character.
B00003CXHJ|4.0|As far as thoughtful (Paths of Glory, Thin Red Line etc.) war films go, this one is not one of them.  As an action film however, this is exceptional entertainment.  The historical inaccuracies don't matter in this.  It is the tension that is created during the depth charge scenes or the submarine battles.  The story itself is relatively simple.  An American submarine crew is sent to retrieve a coding device from a damaged German U-Boat.  Jonathan Mostow has created a claustrophobic and very terrifying environment inside the submarines and during the battle scenes.  The performances are all good with Matthew McConaughey leading the charge and Jake Webster and Harvey Keitel following with equally impressive performances.<br />Universal have provided on this DVD an outstanding picture.  There are hardly any problems in the picture.  The sound however is another story.  The Dolby Digital track is very impressive.  However for greater clarity and a sound that will rock the house 4 blocks away check out the DTS track.  During any of the depth charge scenes expect to be thrown off your seat.<br />The special features that were crammed onto this DVD are equally impressive.  From the Mostow commentary to the documentaries describing how the film was made.  For the historical purists there are several features such as &quot;U.S. Naval archives: Capturing the U-505\\" All in all a great DVD presented with a very good picture, an awesome soundtrack, and a wealth of special features.  Recommended for all those looking for a great bit of entertainment.
B000006MS3|5.0|This is what a friend of mine told me after he listened to `The Dreaming': `The album is good, but I still prefer `Hounds of Love' because it has more variety. Kate Bush is the Bjork of the 80s!' This is what I told him, `The Dreaming' is Kate Bush at her most experimental, `Hounds of Love' might sound more polished and well-organized, it might have a commercial first half and an experimental second half, it might have 2 Top40 singles, `The Dreaming' is a landmark album for Kate because it marks her transformation from a piano ballad chanteuse to the most eccentric female artist of the 80s and conspicuously, she is. In `The Dreaming', you can hear lots of `nonsense' from her, her demented and hysterical screaming (everywhere) , her transformation from a storyteller to a criminal to a fairy...(on `There Goes a Tenner'), the sound of a car passing by (on `Pull Out the Pin'), her chanting like a crazy Indian woman (on `Suspended In Gaffa'), a witch doctor called Kate (on the title track)...of course, I cannot describe everything single sound here, it is beyond my capability and my patience, there are simply too many of such little things that made this a GREAT album!!! It is an album about ideas, but based on solid songwriting skills. It shows how crazy ideas can fit perfectly well with beautiful melodies. One more thing, you just can't sit still listening to that album, it is so DYNAMIC!!! There wouldn't be `Hounds of Love' without `The Dreaming'. No Bjork, no Tori Amos,no Goldfrapp, no Fiona Apple, no Sarah McLachlan...The world would have been a boring place without these fantastic females...Thank you, Kate! You brightened up my life and it is you who taught us how to be weird without being ridiculous.
B000026258|5.0|This is the original recording, from 1978 (it was written between 1974 and 1976, and first performed in April 1976), and it is perfectly realized -- one of the two essential minimalist masterpieces, along with Terry Riley's IN C.  Reich's liner notes give a good idea of how it was constructed, referring to Balinese gamelan music, and West African drumming.<br /><br /> I was aware of this at the time of its release, because I listened to lots of ECM jazz, but did not hear it all the way through until recently as I became interested in contemporary composition.  (I believe there was an excerpt on an ECM compilation I used to own called &#34;Music for 54 Musicians&#34;!)<br /><br /> MUSIC FOR 18 MUSICIANS is one of the most important creations of late 20th century music, and one of the most beautiful.  Western &#34;classical&#34; music seems to be at an impasse at the turn of the millennium.  Young, Riley and Reich pointed the way toward a synthesis with other musics, musics of the East, and of Africa.  This is an excellent trend, especially when it's done well.  Compassion for all sentient beings!  This music conveys that message.<br /><br /> Though there are at least two more recent recordings, one of them with Reich himself on Nonesuch, you can't go wrong with this original ECM version, which is widely regarded as the standard by which others are measured!

6300213668|1.0|This movie could only have been produced in America: musical, bulky cars, greaseballs and bleached-out white rock 'n' roll. I don't like musicals and my review will be colored accordingly. This movie is as light as that sugar fluff that they eat at the &quot;Carnival&quot; at the end. Not one second could I connect with anything that was going on. Was this a highschool or an elementary school? Surely this must be a fantasy about what the 50s were like. With a little more biting spunk this could have been a great Monty Python parody, but to me it's just a movie to quickly digest and forget all about it. I guess as a musical it has value and energy, but for the rest it had all the ingredients of those nauseating American highschool movies.
B00004Y6TQ|5.0|i only write reviews for exceptional works and this is one.  &quot;dancer in the dark&quot; is one of the best movies i have seen , ever, and the accompanying music is so powerful.  emotional and honest, it adds volumes to the movie itself and stands alone as yet another amazing body of work by bjork.  i only discovered her music in the last 6 months or so and i am hooked.  i have bought every major album and can listen to them constantly.  bjork's voice is so filled with emotion and her sound mixing is so unique and fitting that one cannot help but be swept away.  her music is such that one can sit and simply listen to it and be completely occupied, moved and involved.  i never get bored with bjork.
0451169514|5.0|&quot;It&quot; by Stephen King is one of the most powerful books I've ever read.  It was a frightening, shifting story that keeps you riveted until the very end, when everything ties together and suddenly makes sense.  Each of the characters was described in amazingly life-like detail, each of them somehow reminding you of someone you know, or even sometimes yourself.  The plot was laid out sort of like a mystery story, letting you know a little bit here and a little bit there, proportioned just right so you know enough that you're not confused but not enough to figure out how it will end.  The force that is haunting the town is the ultimate evil, feeding on the blood of innocent children and having no regard for human life.  If I had been younger, this book would have given me a deadly fear of clowns.  Though on the outside a killer clown seems a bit silly, it is considerably more than just a clown.  &quot;It&quot; is a recreation of every fear in the character's mind, every secret terror that plagues the deepest corners of their hearts.  But the plot, characters, and overall quality of the book make this one of the best books I've ever read.
B000056K04|4.0|I have been a Dave Matthews fan for about six years. I love songs like The Stone, #41, Say Goodbye, and I'll Back You Up. However, I hate songs like Don't Drink the Water, at least the CD version of that song (it has been performed well in concert). &quot;I did it,&quot; falls in the same category as DDTW, however, if you look past that commercialized, teenie-bopper song, you will find some classic Dave on the CD. &quot;Sleep to Dream Her,&quot; and &quot;The Space Between&quot; are excellent songs. Don't expect &quot;Under the Table and Dreaming,&quot; or &quot;Remember Two Things,&quot; but if you are an avid Dave Matthews fan you will find 6 or 7 worthy tracks on this album.
B00004RF97|5.0|Hollywood has a long history of taking Broadway theatricals and turning them into successful films. In 1940, this process produced &quot;The Philadelphia Story&quot; which had been very popular while on the stage with Katherine Hepburn. As it happened, Katherine was given a lot of control over the film.  She chose all the leads and virtually had the film adaptation custom crafted for her. The end result was a fabulous cast, great performances and one of the funniest scripts ever produced. One final bit of trivia, the studio claimed to have shot the entire film without the need for any second takes.<br />For the most part, this is an interesting film because it has interesting characters. And like any good cuisine, the ingredients are added with impeccable timing and in such a way as to produce a very spicy result. Instead of identifying with one central character, we are forced to wear the shoes of at least three. James Stewart plays, Macaulay Connor, a dissatisfied reporter working for a society rag. He represents the white-collar class. Hepburn and Cary Grant each represent the upper class. Hepburn is Tracy Samantha Lord, a wealthy heiress who is planning to wed for the second time, after rejecting her first husband on the grounds of what seems to be  alcoholism. Grant plays that ex-husband, C. K. Dexter Haven, a now reformed drinker who is still in love with Tracy but is forced to make her life more difficult on the day before her upcoming nuptials.<br />There is a strong social commentary within the film. Tracy's betrothed, George Kittredge, is a working class lad who has worked his way to success. He is possibly the only unlikable character in the movie; as his ambitions are a little too obvious, his mind a little to shallow and his love a little too conditional. There is some early foreshadowing of doom for their relationship. The most obvious clue comes when George tries to mount his horse, after refusing help, and makes a botch of it. Each little scene is jam packed with meaning. The movie would certainly make an interesting study for film students.<br />All of the main characters, barring George, go through significant changes throughout the movie, even if they only change in our perceptions.  Tracy's ice-princess veneer is shattered and she becomes a warm, vulnerable and loving woman. Macaulay drops his prejudices, finds some moral fibre and finally stands up for what he believes in. Dexter forgives himself and in doing so, forgives Tracy. Even Tracy's Father turns out to be a caring and wise figure, instead of the distant, immoral playboy we hear described at the start.<br />Overall the film is too clever for words. They just don't make films like this anymore. It actually relies on the audience to get the joke. The puns, cultural references and interactions are not forced down our throat with a laugh track and a snare-drum. That's not to say you have to work hard to &quot;get&quot; this film; it's more like talking with your friends; you just understand, without further explanation. Everything about this film is perfect, which makes it a delight to watch time and time again. If you don't mind classic black and whites, you'll love Philadelphia Story.jam packed with meaning.

B00000IBRI|5.0|Dario Argento throws in all his trademarks in this horror/fantasy extravaganza.A plain crime story mixed with dream sequences, gore, state of the art camerawork, maggots, fireflies, broken glass, running water, beautiful young girls and a brilliant soundtrack. You name it, it`s all here !<br />Argento has made a lot of mediocre movies the recent years, but this 1984 movie is a true classic.<br />The film is presented in 1.66:1 with a DD 5.1 soundtrack. Both picture and sound is good, but nothing spesial.Anchor bay has also thrown in some extras, but nothing very interesting in my opinion. There is a dull commentary with Argento and three of his collaborators in very broken english, a trailer, two music videos,a lousy behind the scenes segment, and a ridiculous Argento interview from a Joe Franklin show. And don`t be fooled to believe that the 28 minutes that is restored in this UNCUT and UNCENSORED version is gore.It is simply the full european version, and all 28 minutes are plain story and character building.No doubt that this cut is much better than the &quot;Creepers&quot; cut, though.<br />It is the feature itself that makes this disc a must-have.They simply don`t make movies like this anymore ! (Neither does Argento, unfortunately !)<br />Now I can hardly wait for Anchor Bay to release &quot;Opera&quot; and &quot; Suspiria.&quot;
0684833395|5.0|Joseph Heller successfully utilizes detailed character developement, an extremely sarcastic tone, and a confusing placement of events, in which he jumps from scene to scene in no particular order, in order to create a humorous yet realistic image of war and the politics that surround war. Heller titles many of his chapters after a character in the novel. This proves how important the characters are; rather than center the novel around events, Heller centers his novel around the characters. Which makes perfect sense. War may involve events, but more importantly, it involves people. Most of Heller's chapters also begin with a description of the character they are titled after. The first sentence of the chapter titled &quot;Colonel Cathart&quot;, Heller begins with &quot;Colonel Cathart was a slick, successful, slipshod, unhappy man of thirty-six who lumbered when he walked...&quot; Although how he walks has absolutely nothing to do with any of the major events of the novel, Heller tells us this in order to give a more personal image of Colonel Cathart. Colonel Cathart is a character in the war; he creates the events, the events do not create him. Heller not only developes his characters without leaving out any personal details, but also portrays the war and its charaters with much humor and sarcasm. It is impossible to read through this novel and not atleast smile. I even laughed out loud a few times. The tone may seem incredibly funny; however, the message is very grim. Heller is telling a story of war. The people in this war, as hilarious as they seem, are really very depressing. Every character has their own set of &quot;issues&quot;. Yossarian, for example, loves every woman he sees. If he lives through the war (another &quot;issue&quot;-obsession with death), he will probably have a very hard time finding a mate. These psycological and emotional damages are the ones Heller is attempting to portray. Usually the funnier it seems, the more devastating, realisticallyspeaking, its effects are. Heller also has a tendency to put all of his events out of order. Perhaps this is to show how the veterans of the war see things, or to show that the events really aren't as important as the people. Either way, it makes the novel somewhat hard to follow, but does make us look more to the characters and their feelings rather than the events taken place. As human beings, we like to take the easier route, and following the character developement is much easier than following the confusing plotline, or lack there of. Overall, the novel was incredibly insightful. Most &quot;war books&quot; are very serious, but Heller's light tone makes Catch-22 stand out. However, we must not forget the underlying message. War damages people mentally, emotionally, and physically forever, even after it's over.
0679879269|1.0|I read the whole &quot;His Dark Materials&quot; series, and it would have been better if I had not read the third one. This book, although it includes some exciting parts, has nothing to do with the plots of the other two books. In second book it says that Lyra will be tempted by Dr. Mary Malone. In the last book, which I excitedly awaited only to my dissappointment, there was absolutely nothing about this. I think Phillip Pullman, of whom I am a huge fan, should rewrite this story that doesn't stick to the plot of the other two books. I suggest to all readers who have or will read the first two books that they use their imaginations for the third book. This book was as if the author scribbled in down in an hour. Nothing fit! It litterally ruined the whole series. Don't even bother waisting the time or the money on this book.

B00004WGC4|5.0|This series revolves around John Cleese and his ability to perform both physical comedy and screaming hysterics. On both levels it works extremely well. Basil Fawlty is just not a nice person. He hits the porter. He berates the maid. The belittles the guests. And, he back stabs his wife. A role model for all politically correct people. And, no one can pull it off like John Cleese.<br />Bea Arthur tried an Americanized version, as did the great John Larroquette. Neither worked because Americanized may as well mean watered-down. No one is willing to be as nasty as is needed to pull off what John Cleese did so effortlessly.
0684833395|4.0|Joseph Heller, in Catch-22, uses mainly humor, horror, and irony to convey his theme that war is irrational.  Most of the chapters in this book are very funny.  They centre on things that are ludicrous and silly.  A great number of things happen in this book that could not and would not ever happen in real life.  The characters in Catch-22 though, never notice the absurdities around them, and this contributes to the humor of the book.  Heller shows the characters behaving as if everything is fine to show how soldiers in the war are made to do whatever their superiors want them to.  Indeed, a major theme of the book is that the individual is powerless to stand against large institutions such as the military or big business.  Different characters in the book symbolize the larger forces against Yossarian, the protagonist.  Yossarian is constantly being \\"defeated\\" by these institutions, despite his brave efforts to oppose them.  Heller also achieves his purpose though the juxtaposition of humor and horror.  He will present a ridiculous situation and invite us to laugh at it, and then immediately present a feeling of horror, such as showing us that we are no different than the characters that are behaving so oddly.  This juxtaposition is consistent throughout the novel.  One of Heller's chief methods of conveying his hilarity and dismay is irony.  His dry, cynical, irony fills the book with funny situations and afterwards makes one think more deeply about them.  Heller amplifies the absurdities of war to make them impossible to miss.  Heller's constant switching back and forth shows the reader that war is definitely irrational.
B00004W3MS|3.0|It's indeed, a very NICE album. It's nice to listen to when I am reading, going to sleep, trying not to think of anything, but upon further inspection... it doesn't really hold up. My father once said to me that his problem with minimalism was that, they wrote really nice introductions but it never went anywhere. I never agreed with him, but I feel that that statement applies well to this record. They have a wonderful knack for making nice arrangements with shifting seventh chords and whatnot, but it basically comes out in the end not really MOVING me in the least. Though they have their own sound, the comparisons come rolling off my tongue so easily. Certainly, the new Radiohead is not far off... I've found it reminds me most of Rachel's &quot;The Sea and The Bells&quot;, only it doesn't hold as much depth. So, in the end... a very nice album, I'd be interested in seeing them live and possibly hearing some of their other records, but it doesn't really leave me feeling fulfilled.
0452282152|4.0|A wonderful book! When you were a kid did you ever wish to go back in time? Of course, you did. Now that you're grown up you can read this book and have Chevalier transport you back to Delft in the 1600's. Her writing is so filled with descriptive details  you feel you are actually there. The story is based on the daily life of the main character, Griet, who works in the Vermeer househould as a maid. The storyline is not so intriquing but the writing is incredibly evocative and poignant. I enjoyed it so much that I didn't want to finish it. I highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys reading historical fiction.
6302516919|1.0|Well what can I say about Christine..... Well to put it bluntly: It stinks, but to be more fair. I'll tell you why. The movie does follow some progession in the story, but they switch the scenes around &amp; take too many creative liberties in this movie: the have &quot;The fight scene&quot; as the first scene then they get the car, instead of a gas tanker they use a bulldozer(which would make more sense, a bulldozer has more manuverability). &quot;STAND BY ME&quot; keeps closer to the book(&quot;The Body&quot; a novella in &quot;Different Seasons&quot;) than Christine does. <br />This movies just does not follow along the book in any way shape or form(except for some key scenes). <br />In conclusion: Stay away from Christine(the movie), stick to the book.
B00005A46U|4.0|This recording is the beginning of three brilliant successive albums. The first two, this recording and Land of Grey and Pink, consist of the original lineup with cousins Richard (bass)and Dave Sinclair (keys)on board. Terrific stuff. Their psychedelic roots fading away, the band ventured into the realm of progressive music with a subtle jazzy undertone. The bass and keyboard work were outstanding among an outfit of solid musicianship. Not a weak cut in the lot. Highly recommended...Simon

0517209764|1.0|Upon opening this book I immediately turned to my favourite play, Romeo and Juliet.  My favourite scene is the opening battle between the Montagues and the Capulets.  But what have we here?  Suddenly the families are reversed.  Sampson and Gregory are servants to Montague, not Capulet, and Abraham has apparently switched teams as well.  Gregory says that one of his kinsmen is coming, and then Benvolio enters.  Benvolio is a montague, which just goes to prove that they are montagues, and not servants of capulet.  I don't know the rest of the plays as well, but for all I know there could be many more easily missed mistakes in the text.
B000056VIY|1.0|this was worse than the first cd and sadly sounds the same only worse..i gave her debut cd a chance because she was a latina trying to make it but i was sorely disappointed when i listened to it and realized that she has a horrid voice...and i am a singer so i have some perspective...there are several ok songs on this cd but they sound the same as the few good songs on her first cd.  If she spent more time trying to be creative instead of selling out and showing us that behind that has its own zip code then maybe, just maybe, this would have been a better cd...but as it is...it isn't worth the money i paid for it, but if you like cheesy, overproduced, tired pop then this is the cd for you.
B000021Y74|4.0|I don't know how the comparison got started, but Groundhog Day resembles Lola Rennt (its original German title) about as much as much as cooking sherry resembles a good merlot. Both will get you drunk, and how you get there is up to you -- but the low-rent route may not agree with your stomach all that well. This may sound as if I'm getting ready to slam Groundhog Day -- not at all. It was a good movie, though not great, but there was a certain amount of formula to it -- i.e., Bill Murray plays one of his stock cynical jerk characters, who because of an extraordinary series of circumstances, undergoes a complete personality facelift by the movie's end. This is all well and good, and it makes for a fun movie -- but nobody will ever confuse it with a really classic comedy like It Happened One Night. <br />Okay, so how does all this blathering relate to Lola Rennt? Well, as I said, the comparison is absurd, a true case of apples and oranges if ever I've seen one. GD was a comedy which pretended to have serious overtones; Lola on the other hand is a serious, experimental film which refuses to take itself all that seriously. It has a definite sense of humor about itself, and even seems to parody itself at certain points. Also, Groundhog Day is about a man trapped in repeating the same day over and over again -- whereas Lola (and this is where the confusion started, I think) is about a woman faced with a difficult choice, who runs through possible scenarios of how her choices will work out -- but (and I wish I could use italics here to emphasize this) only the last of these occurs in real life! The first two are Lola running through these possible events in her own mind, speculating on how it will go -- will I get killed, will my boyfriend get killed, etc.? This is a small but crucial point that a lot of people seem to miss, and it's also the biggest reason why Lola Rennt is cut from a completely different cloth than Groundhog Day.<br />So, having said all that, let me now talk about the movie. The plot is simple: Lola's boyfriend Manni loses 100,000 Marks through a stupid accident (it's made obvious straightaway that Manni isn't the brightest bulb in the lamp), and Lola must help him come up with the cash in 20 minutes or he will die. There then follows three separate versions of how that happens, two speculative on Lola's part, the final one the way it really happens. Subtle and major changes happen in each successive version of these events, but the connecting thread between all three is that Lola must run to get where she is going. I won't spoil the fun for you by telling all that happens, save that one involves blackmail, another involves a robbery, while the third involves a coincidence that stretches the bounds of believability. Franka Potente is amazing in the title role -- she's a very good actor, and handles the physically demanding role with ease. More than one review has compared what she does to Olympic-quality athleticism, and I have to agree.<br />The film itself, both in terms of script and direction, is highly imaginative -- and you don't have to be a pseudo-intellectual, as one of the other reviewers suggested, to appreciate it. There are lots of lovely touches throughout -- the way the car accident happens differently each time, the hobo on the bicycle, the Bergmanesque conversations between Lola's father and his lover. Best of all are the brilliant &quot;AND THEN:&quot; sequences, which in several seconds of snapshots show the possible futures of minor characters and extras in the film, which again are different every time, and which swing wildly from hilarity and irony to tragedy and chilling sorrow. These are some of the movie's best moments, and they really add to the pulsing rhythms of the main story. Another nice touch is Lola's scream, which shatters glass -- suggesting that Lola has become a force of nature, and woe betide the poor S.O.B. who gets in her way. These moments make you laugh, but the laughteris of a decidedly nervous variety, because you sense that such tremendous passion will lead Lola to trouble (as if it hasn't already, considering what her unreasoning love for Manni has led her into!).<br />A lot of &quot;art-house&quot; films have the tendency to take themselves way (and I mean WAY) too seriously; Lola Rennt, if anything, almost goes too far in the opposite direction. It does a lot of its work with a sly-wink-and-a-nod feel that is amusing (and as I said above, there are moments of self-parody that are very good), but this playful tone at times almost upends the story's more serious aspects. That, along with the hard-to-swallow moments in the third storyline, has led me to give Lola Rennt four stars instead of five. However, it's still head and shoulders above most of the other experimental art films I've seen lately. I wholeheartedly reccommend it to you, and I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.
0446677450|1.0|This book is an example of how to say the same thing six hundred different ways. It's the most simplistic, boring writing I've encountered in about 10 years.

In perhaps his most famous role, Dennis Quaid plays a rogue knight who, with the help of a very noble dragon, (Sean Connery, seen-but-never-heard as the voice of the winged reptillian), fights to overthrow a wicked king, (David Thewlis, who bears an uncanny resemblance to The Monkees' Peter Tork).  An absolute must for action fans, Braveheart is both a history lesson and a carnypark thrill-ride that will captivate all.

For fans of black and white horror movies, this movie is paradise.  It includes everything B grade, with A grade talent.  It's not to be taken seriously, and yes there are a couple of editorial errors for the trainspotters, but it's all good fun.  You must remember it was written in the early 70's and is a film that explores sexuality in a very conservative society. For those who are offended or just don't get it, lighten up, don't be so boring and have fun.
B0000069KS|5.0|This video is one of the funniest I've ever seen. With all of my fave guys of course I would say that, but if your a Beatles fan you have to watch this video with Ringo, Paul, George, and John. Even if you aren't you should also. This isn't one of their best but it is really close.
0694003611|5.0|I got this book (in the board version) for a shower gift for my now 2-year-old daughter.  I didn't remember reading this book as a child and at first it seemed a little odd -- the pictures weren't tremendously appealing and the rhyme scheme seemed strange.  I have, however, been converted.  After reading the book several times to my newborn daughter, I noticed how soothing it was to her.  She seemed to be able to see the pictures and, as she got older, would reach out to touch elements in each.  We read it every night for months, because it seemed to set a good tone for bedtime.  After learning a little more about how children think, I began to understand what made it so appealing -- the ritual of saying good night to familiar objects helped reassure her when she had to say good night to her mom and dad, which can be scary for tiny kids.<br />Now, of course, she's a big girl and says it's a &quot;baby book&quot;.  However, it's still by her bed and I've overheard her &quot;reading&quot; it to herself or to her baby brother many times.  It's an excellent choice for a baby you love.

B000059Z8J|5.0|The first line of Superman: The Movie is Jor-El (Marlon Brando) telling the Kryton Council &quot;This is no fantasy.&quot;  This line is symbolic of the movie that is about to follow.  When one watches Superman you do not feel as if is a fantasy.  Superman takes itself totally seriously and it is therefore an immensly entertaining and believable viewing experience.  The video quality of this DVD is excellent.  This is the first time I have seen this film since I was young.  Now that I'm older I can truly appreciate the riveting performance Christopher Reeve gave as Clark Kent/Superman.  Reeve provided each character with a distinctive personality.  This lent credibility to the story.  Reeve's mannerisms also gave the flying sequences authenticity. The greatest compliment I can give Christopher Reeve is that whenever I think of Superman I will instantaneously think of him.  The supporting cast of Superman were also excellent.  Marlon Brando (Jor-El) and Gene Hackman (Lex Luthor) both gave outstanding performances.  This DVD also has additional scenes that were not in the theatrical release.  These scenes are not frivolous and really add a new dimension to the film.  For example, there is more of Jor-El emphasizing his son's purpose on Earth. Superman: The Movie is a great film because it has one ingredient that future comic book adaptations have lacked, emotion.  This is inherent in the relationship between Superman and Lois Lane (Margot Kidder).  Superman is undisputably the Citizen Kane of comic book adaptations.
0804106304|5.0|In Amy Tan's novel, The Joy Luck Club, she uses mystic realism, Chinese traditions, Chinese superstitions, and four different mother-daughter relationships in order to convey the lifestyles of Chinese women living both in traditional China and in modern America. The mothers tell their daughters stories of their many sacrifices and vast oppression when they lived in China. The use of familiar Chinese traditions, such as arranged marriages, and involving the feelings of the woman getting married, helps to emphasize the expected role of the submissive Chinese wife in those times. By using mystic realism in selected chapters, Tan presents more Chinese culture and superstitions. All the mothers, being raised in China, are accustomed to the superstitious stories passed through generations as warnings to various things, especially outspoken women. The women and their daughters all interact differently throughout the stories. All have respect for their mothers, even though they do not understand each other, which also presents the theme of Chinese tradition evident throughout the novel. The mothers and daughters are often in tension because of the vast differences in their cultures. The mothers believe their daughters are materialistic and busy, while the daughters believe their mothers are homely and old-fashioned. Chinese women have always been expected to stand in the background and observe rather than participate in life, until these families move to America. When they have Chinese-American daughters who have opinions and disobey their parents, they become distant from their family and culture. Tan effectively portrays the expected roles of traditional and modern Chinese women through the use of Chinese traditions and superstitions shown in the relationships of four Chinese mothers and their daughters.

B00004SCX6|4.0|This album overall outshines Britney's first album many songs on this album will definitely get you up dancing . Honestly, I listen to all types of music and at times I'm tired of listening to so much negativity so if want a change just for an hour and a half get this album! ( don't worry it won't transform you into a Teeny Bopper )
B000005IU2|5.0|if youre a punk you already know.  you need to buy this cd sooner or later.  why buy a photocopy of a photocopy of a photocopy of a photocopy when you can buy the original? even the ramones looked up to the stooges.  its funny how mtv and mcdonalds can trick little kids into thinking that blink and the backstreet boys are punk.
B00005AXEL|5.0|After listening to Trouble in Shangri-La several times I thought I would be able to put the songs in order from best to worst. I found this to be impossible. I love every song. (Though the Sheryl Crow written song is sort of weak.)<br />With all the publicity of the ''all star'' cast of characters that helped Stevie with this CD, I must say, that help is all but invisible. Only Natalie Maines is very apparent on Too Far From Texas. This duet and the harmonizing again proves that Stevie has the type of voice that blends so magically with others. <br />If there are any comparisons to make, I would have to point out that I believe the songs written solely by Stevie are far superior to the other songs either co-written or not written by Stevie. Standouts on this CD are Bombay Sapphire if only for the fact it proves Stevie is a great producer of her own music. Bombay Sapphire and Fall From Grace prove that this woman can still rock more than a little. There's some great storytelling in Trouble In Shangri-La and That Made Me Stronger. These songs also highlight Stevie's unusual style of songwriting. This contrasts with Every Day(not written by Stevie), which is a more typical example of popular music writing--and I do love this song. If I had to select some favorites, I would have to say Planets of the Universe, Love Changes and Love Is are my favorites. After all this time, Stevie is still a pure pleasure to listen to. Stevie's voice is stronger than ever and she sings with such clarity. Trouble In Shangri-La rates up there with her very best. <br />And to those who believe Street Angel is a forgettable album, I have to say I'm thankful for that CD--Blue Demin is awesome!
B000003C2U|5.0|Human is one of the great death metal albums of all time. All of the musicianship is so sublime, it's hard to figure out where to begin this review.<br />Regarding percussion on this album, it's some of the best I've ever heard. Extremely fast, but not just blast beats; most jazz drummers would be envious of the high-speed finesse Sean Reinert displays here. This guy is REALLY fast, especially when you consider that he's all over the drum kit on basically every song. You must check out the album if only for the drums.<br />Chuck Schuldiner's lead guitar work is like nothing you've ever heard before....the whole thing is just really well produced. <br />Just go buy it now, and listen to greatness!
0451196716|5.0|Of all of the Stephen King books I've read under his pseudonym, Richard Bachman, this one is tops (or perhaps &quot;Rage&quot;).<br />I picked this up for a second read after all of the reality tv shows popped up, and I still think it's scary how close we're actually getting to this scenario.<br />For those of you unfamiliar with the plot line, one hundred  young men are selected for what is called &quot;The Long Walk,&quot; and are watched like heros as they walk and walk. No sleeping, no slowing down to go to the bathroom, nothing. Losers are shot, but the winner gets ANYTHING he wants. Care to gamble your life with 100-1 odds based on your sheer will and ability to walk hundreds of miles?<br />King's (er... Bachman's) pace is excellent, each character's story is interesting, but the greatest of all comes with imagining the rules and regulations and possibilities of this game. One of the networks actually picked up what sounds suspiciously like a VERY toned-down version of the game in the book. It has to do with walking or some other sort of endurance for a prize. Is it art imitating life or just plain creepy? Read this book and try and find a screening of an indie movie called &quot;Series 7&quot; (contestants each get a gun; the winner goes on to Series 8). They pack a serious 1-2 punch to the disturbing nature of reality shows.
B00000J048|5.0|This is a great toy for both kids and parents. My 4 year old daughter loves it and we've enjoyed watching her get more skilled and creative at assembling the gears. I wouldn't recommend this for kids much under 3 1/2, although our 18 month old loves watching it spin and playing with some of the individual pieces (we took out the few really small ones). It's really durable and fun for parents too.

Buy it anyway! from what i've listened LIVE, and the samples and reviews here, well, what's left to say, but welcome back dudes!
B00005B3Z6|4.0|Potential purchasers of this video should be aware that there may be problems with the encoding on this DVD. My Panasonic DVD-L50 portable and my Play Station 2 were both unable to play this DVD without starts and stops, hiccups and artifacts in both video and audio. It was unwatchable. I was only able to view the disk on my computer's DVD-ROM with no problems. <br />The disk, by the way, is not region coded.<br />The story is great, with the exception of the drug stuff. Nobody I know does drugs other than an occasional joint. Are British young people really as drug-soaked as QAF and Trainspotting seem to show? The acting is excellent and the characters are believable. Worth buying if you have equipment to view the DVD, maybe even several players to try just in case one doesn't work.
067972768X|4.0|In her novel,  The Joy Luck Club, Amy Tan stylistically employs imagery, flashbacks,  and running motifs in order to exemplify the struggles of four mothers and four daughters as they bridge cultural and generational gaps to bond together in love.  Tan's unique style mainly contrasts the different worlds in which the mothers and daughters live.  It is this difference in cultures that motivates much of the action of the novel.<br />Tan paints the picture of the American world of the daughters who &quot;grew up speaking only perfect English and swallowing more Coca-Cola than sorrow&quot; (Tan 18) as compared to the Chinese world of the mothers &quot;whose worth was measured by the loudness of her husband's belch&quot; (Tan 18).  Since the mothers and daughters come from such different backgrounds, they have trouble communicating, not only because of the obvious language barrier, but because each of the women has her own view of life that no one else can see.  This blindness returns time and again in the novel as a motiv that is a source of pain to the women experiencing it.  For example,  one of the daughters,  Rose Hsu Jordan flashes back to the image of a day in her childhood when her family friend tried hopelessly to &quot;act like a typical American family at the beach&quot; (Tan 122).  The idea of fitting in with the Americans blinded her like &quot;invisible specs that felew into [her] eyes and made it hard for [her] to see dangers&quot; (Tan 122).  The young Rose was so caught up in her day that she neglected her responsibility to watch her youngest brother, Bing.  A dark cloud ascends over the beach as the family realizes that the ocean has taken him.  They never found his body.  In this case, the daughter was too involved in her own world to remember what her mother hasd asked her to do.  This also connects directly into another motif in which water claims something very important to the family.  This flashback is characteristic of Tan's style.  Flashbacks allow her to drift through time, focusing on the different characters and cultures without disturbing the novel's flow. <br />So by vividly describing scenes through motifs and flashbacks, Tan is able to effectively and equally show both sides of a complex heritage.  Her ability to sail seamlessly through cultural and generational boundaries by touching upon universal themes allows Tan to reveal both the yin and yang in her story.  This helps her readers understand a new genre of literature in which Asian-American writers explore their backgrounds, and this proves that it is not just a passing fad, but a substantial movement in American literature that will continue to grow and mature with time.
6305232660|4.0|In chapter 26 of this DVD you can find me in the traffic scene. I'm wearing a gray shirt and have a bit of a smile on. (I was supposed to be 'frightened' of the devastating comet) but for some reason something made me giggle and they kept in the movie!<br />My 1.75 seconds of fame!<br />The DVD is great, though. Armageddon had no substance! This movie had a story that tugged at the tear ducts. The visual effects are incredible and Morgan Freeman should really run for president.
B00000J631|5.0|In keeping with the theme of this CD, I'll keep my review short. In short, this CD kicks serious *ss. It's worth the price just to hear Blink 182's song (and I don't care much for Blink, either, so that's saying something...), where it's basically &quot;how many obscenities can we use in 30 seconds?&quot;. It's got something for everybody, even those who only like the MTV punk (Blink, Green Day, Offspring, etc.), older punks (Bad Religion, Circle Jerks, Subhumans), and punk favorites (Pennywise, Rancid, NOFX, No Use For A Name, Vandals). Everyone who's anyone in punk is here, even newbies The Living End make an appearance. The only downside is, you need the tracklisting right in front of you, so you know what song you're on. I wouldn't recommend listening to this in the car, however. Trust me, without the tracklisting, 12 songs will go by before you can blink. There is some crap in this CD, though. The Goober Patrol is downright annoying, to name one.  The Descendants's song is also annoying. That said, There's more than enough good stuff to make this CD worth purchasing. Fat Mike did an amazing job putting this CD together. Buy this if you're a true punk, or are just getting into punk. Or, if you don't know a thing about punk and have been wanting to check it out, this CD is exactly what you're looking for.
B000002L9S|5.0|Madonna seems to mature with virtually every album she makes convincing the listener to pay full attention to this magnificent pop diva. This album contains 80's retro flavored songs, that were popular during this time, although Madonna never does follow trends she sets them as many of us know. Some of my favorite songs on here include &quot;Papa Don't Preach&quot; which is a dance floor favorite about a confused teenager, &quot;Open Your Heart&quot; which is a beautiful pop song that actually made me buy this album, &quot;White Heat&quot; which is dedicated to the legendary James Cagney with Madonna's voice at full force, &quot;Live To Tell&quot; with Madonna's melancholy yet sultry vocals which can sometimes make the song rather depressing but as soon as the song stops, you'll want to play it over again (yes it's that addicting!), &quot;True Blue&quot; one of the 80's highlights, &quot;La Isla Bonita&quot; the latin infected dance song with an addicting conga drum that is played relentlessly during the song, &quot;Love Makes The World Go Round&quot; seems to follow the pattern of &quot;La Isla Bonita&quot; with yet more latin beats fused with Madonna's shining vocals.<br />As you can see Madonna's love for entertaining her listeners really shines through, making this album impossible to resist to any music lovers, and without a doubt it will make it to your CD collection.

B000059Z8J|5.0|Back in 1978, I could hardly believe a man could fly, and I could not believe I had seen the greatest film ever made.  Now, 23 years later, at long last, &quot;Superman&quot; has been given the ultimate justice on the best home video format there is...DVD.<br />From beginning to end, this digitally restored version is everything I expected...remastered picture and sound, restored beyond its original brilliance.<br />Marlon Brando heads an all-star international cast in this definitive telling of Superman's origin, from Krypton to Metropolis.  A motion picture masterpiece...great cast, great story, great score, and with what still is the greatest movie song ever, Margot Kidder's &quot;vocal&quot; of &quot;Can You Read My Mind&quot;.<br />Although the DVD could have used more supplements, whatever there is certainly is enough to last me the next 23 years...the documentaries are informative and revealing, the trailers look excellent, though I wish they would have included all the deleted scenes used for TV.<br />However, this DVD remains an excellent achievement.  I believed in 1978 (as I do now in 2001) &quot;Superman&quot; was the last great epic film we will ever see on the big screen, and history that will never be repeated again.<br />Please, go buy this DVD.

0679879269|5.0|Needless to say, if you've read the other books in the &quot;His Dark Materials&quot; series, you're GOING to pick this one up.  Leaving Lyra and Will (and Roger!) hanging at the end of the second book would be criminal.<br />If, on the other hand, you've not read ANY of the series, this book should be the one that pushes you in that direction.  Pullman has taken all of the loosest elements from the previous two books and ties them together so perfectly, so seamlessly, that even the seemingly most trivial aspect that you would assume could (or should) be overlooked is addressed, highlighted, underscored, and filed neatly away.<br />Without wanting to give too much away, you can bet that Roger is back, along with Mr. Scoresby, Lyra's parents (who meet a far more appropriate fate than I could ever have imagined), and Serafina.  Lyra and Will, in the last three chapters, will leave you gasping for more and if you don't shed at least one tear by the end of the book, consider yourself among the most granite-hearted to tread the earth!<br />Make no mistake about it, however; the book should be approached by wary (albeit open-minded) parents if you're looking at it for a gift for the kids.  There are are the casual vices they see on prime time television (deaths, drinking, despair, grief), but nothing is without its own punishment (or reward).  I'd save this for the pre-teen to teen years; even reading these aloud to the 2nd and 3rd graders might be a bit too much for those tender minds.  If nothing else, buy the books for your own enjoyment, put them away until you feel the kids are at an appropriate age, and then let them dive in to a world like no other.<br />An excellent read!
B00005AXEL|5.0|This CD is simply amazing!  There is little else that can be said to describe it.  Stevie is back with a vengeance!  Even if you didn't like her before you should really give this CD a try - the music is haunting.
0684853523|5.0|I read a lot of books on writing techniques, character development, plotting, and all that sort of thing -- not because I expect to become Stephen King, and not even because I actually do some writing myself, but because I have an analytical turn of mind and I like to understand what's going on behind the scenes, in the author's mind. (I read screenplays for the same reason.) Some how-to books are much better than others, naturally, and King rather surprised me with this one. The man is not only a very talented writer, he's a very good teacher, too. On Writing is actually part writing manual and part semi-sardonic writer's autobiography. He describes how he grew up with the writing bug, how he got started and figured out what he wanted to do, how he actually learned how to do it . . . and how he sometimes screwed up. He certainly doesn't spare himself, either. King was an alcoholic and druggie for nearly two decades, but that apparently never got in the way of the creative process. Although &quot;There's one novel, CUJO, that I barely remember writing,&quot; he says. And several of the darker characters in such books as MISERY and THE TOMMYKNOCKERS were very much himself. He finally got rid of that baggage through his wife's firm intervention. King is a very generous person when he talks about other writers, though he doesn't hesitate to explain how and where even the best sometimes have a tin ear. His notion that a book is not created from nothing, that it's really a sort of fossil, to be excavated and exposed, is not entirely original with him, but he lays out his reasons very persuasively. Even though he taught high school English in his early career, he doesn't believe grammar should be seen as a straitjacket. And his books are almost entirely character-driven; he does almost no plotting in advance. (That's nice to hear because my mind works much the same way, but I feel guilty when I just let the story take off without having plotted and outlined it in advance.) The last section of the book talks about his near-fatal pedestrian encounter with a recklessly driven van in the summer of 1999 and the part that his return to the keyboard played in his continuing recuperation. Best of all, King writes nonfiction in much the same straightforward, unaffected way that he has produced more than forty bestselling novels.)

6302581907|5.0|One of the things I truly enjoy about Whoopi Goldberg films is that she is always joined by an all-star cast and plots that make the practical actor cringe. Whoopi plays Delores Van Cartier a lounge singer who witnesses a vicious crime commited by her married lover and as a result goes undercover as a nun in order to not be found. But upon arriving at the church she overcomes several obstacles, these include the mean-spirited nun Mother Superior, and trying not to reveal her true identity. Later she joins the nun's musical choir and realizes just how truly bad they are, so the nuns insist that she be the musical instructor, and transforms the bad nun's choir into a hip funky choir that is just out of this world. I give this album five stars because of Whoopi's incredible acting talent, and the movie itself is simply irresistable! If your looking for a movie that will have you on the edge of your seat, and laughing relentlessly, I would definitely recommend this movie to you!

0375501851|4.0|White Teeth, by Zadie Smith, is undoubtedly a triumphant debut for this extraordinary talented writer who takes on big themes like race, gender, and culture. Although contemporary life has brought at least a sociological blending of races and ethnicity, blending of genes for humans remains as sadly colonial as ever. \\"If you can divide reality inexhaustibly into parts,\\" Smith writes after the twins try to make peace between their ideologies, \\"the result is insupportable paradox. You are always still, you move nowhere, and there is no progress. But multiplicity is no illusion. Nor Is the speed with which those in the simmering melting pot are dashing towards it...the brothers will race towards the future only to find they more and more eloquently express their past, that place where they have just bee. Because this is the other thing about immigrants (`fugees, migrs, travelers): they cannot escape their history any more than you yourself can lose your shadow.\\" White Teeth celebrates the chaff of humanity, the Joneses and Iqbals of any land. Smith has a lot to say about threats to ethnicity, but her real weapon is on the way the she says these things. Her true power lies really on the way that she says anything. From time to time it seems as if she will not progress on the way that she is telling an anecdote, but in the end the characters seem to advance towards infinite destinies. Not everything works well throughout the novel though. Some things are unappealing to the story. Yet even these things manage not to compromise the achievement of such a wonderful novel.

B000001GQD|5.0|The Second Concerto has been recorded more times than perhaps any other piano concerto, but one interpretation stands head and shoulders above all others; indeed it remains one of the most magnificent recordings of classical music ever made.  This is the legendary 1959 account by the great Soviet pianist Sviatoslav Richter, superbly remastered on Deutsche Grammophon, coupled with Richter's equally famous (albeit controversial) version of the Tchaikovsky First concerto.<br />The Rachmaninov is quite simply the most moving, the most exciting, and the most beautiful performance ever recorded.  Richter's pianism in the slow movement is fabulous, and the Finale (taken at a cracking pace) makes others seem dull by comparison.<br />The Tchaikovsky concerto is not quite in the same league, although Richter's playing makes it seem more profound than normal.  He and Karajan appear not to have agreed over certain tempi, but it is a fascinating performance nonetheless.<br />Sound throughout is glowing.  At mid-price, this CD should be in the collection of every music lover.<br />Also, don't miss Richter's wonderful Dvorak Concerto (a beautiful piece) coupled with Schubert on EMI.
B00005JG6Q|5.0|On a basic Saturday morning I slowly shuffled down to the T.V. to turn on my Saturday Anime on the Sci-Fi channel.  I expected another re-run of some crappy anime, but it didn't matter to me.  Rather, I discovered they were playing a movie I had never heard of, Akira.  From the beginning to the end, I was glued to my seat.  I even watched the commercials with attentiveness because I was afraid I would miss it when it came back on.  Because it was on t.v. it had been shortened and was missing a lot of the graphic detail in this movie, which is very generous.  I therefore rented it and watched it three times that day.  This is a very graphic movie, involving generous blood and some nudity.  There is no doubt in my mind that this is the best Anime I have ever seen.  So what are waiting for?!  Go rent it!
B0000041DF|4.0|By general agreement the finest uncut recording of the Rachmaninov Third Concerto in modern sound is Martha Argerich's, recorded at a Berlin concert in 1982.<br />This is also available as part of an inexpensive 2 CD set as part of Philips' Great Pianists of the 20th Century series, and is shortly to be reissued at medium price in Philips 50th Anniversary series.<br />Most recordings of the Third Concerto that were made before the mid-1960s observed small cuts in the second and third movements.  These include fine versions by Vladimir Horowitz on BMG/RCA from 1951, Earl Wild on Chandos, and Byron Janis in 1957 on BMG/RCA or 1963 on Mercury (the 1957 recording is preferable), but not Vladimir Ashkenazy's  beautifully played Decca recording, also from 1963, which is complete.<br />Apart from his 1951 recording, Vladimir Horowitz (who was associated with this concerto for over 50 years) made two other commercial recordings, in 1930 and 1978, although the latter interpretation is better heard on a Deutsche Grammophon VHS video of a New York Philharmonic concert.
B000059Z8J|5.0|Watching Superman The Movie is an experience. Not only are you treated to a film good for the kids, but there are also many moments that will thrill adults. The movie is filled with emotion, action and incredible excitement.<br />The movie opens with long introductions about Superman's past and his time growing up on Earth. We are treated wish such scenes as his launch into space, his \\"naked\\" discovery on Earth and his \\"calling\\" to go north. All of this fills pretty much the first hour of the film but we are never once bored.<br />Once the action moves to Metropolis, it is almost like a whole new movie. The interaction between Lois and Clark is simply priceless. Their early scenes together build on what is to come, even moving into Superman II.  Margo Kidder was perfect for this role. She just had the right look for Lois: attractive without being a Super Model. It was just so sweet how Superman took to her. We are also introduced to Lex Luthor and his gang. Gene Hackman was perfect for this role and he really steals ever scene that he is in.<br />The thing about Superman is that it has an epic feel to it and it never looks back. From the launch of \\"baby\\" Superman to the climatic ending sequences, we are drawn into the story. The witty dialogue is also one of the best aspects of the film. Whether it is the nonchalant comments from Superman (i.e. \\"Bad Vibrations\\") to the famous, clap inducing \\"You've Got Me? Who's got you?\\" you never feel that any of the film is scripted. And the special effects, while dated (the miniatures LOOK miniature), are also extremely good.<br />The DVD version is an absolute joy. You get 9 minutes of new footage, including more scenes in the Fortress of Solitude with Marlon Brando. There are several behind the scenes looks and several trailers and cast bios. The enhanced sound is also very impressive. When the credits at the beginning started to appear and then fly by, I was just taken back! I wasn't expecting it at all and it was a taste of things to come. You can even hear shards of kryptonite flying through space after Krypton explodes.<br />Superman The Movie is one of the best comic book movies in the same tradition of greats like Dick Tracy and The Shadow. If you or your kids have never seen it, this is a must have. If you have, relive the magic again.of things to come. You can even hear shards of kryptonite flying through space after Krypton explodes.  <br />Superman The Movie is one of the best comic book movies in the same tradition of greats like Dick Tracy and The Shadow.

0451523938|5.0|An amazing book.  Although some of the mystery is ruined because of the common knowledge of what it is about there is so much more to it.   It is a very quick read and one of the best books I have read in a long time.  Even though it is fairly short there is a lot of depth.  It is one of my favorite books!
B000002KBU|5.0|If anyone ever doubts the sheer quality and depth of the singer songwriters of the late 1960s early 70s, play them this album.  Joni Mitchell was part of a great wave of clever, sophisticated musicians with plenty to say and the talent and technique to express themselves perfectly. At the time she was one of many, over time its clear that she was one of the best. And among a handful of good albums recorded in the early 1970s this one is her absolute best. Which means its utterly brilliant.<br />A lyrical and musical masterpiece, subtle yet sophisticated, easy listening, yet profound and sometimes disturbing, Blue seems to get rediscovered by every generation of thoughtful music fans; I first heard it in 1986, 16 years after its release and took great pleasure in introducing it to some college kids recently.<br />Unlike many works by more famous artists of the era, what really keeps Blue fresh is its wonderful minimalism - less really is more in this case. Most of these songs feature simple accustic guitars leading to a sparse yet beautifully played sound. The musicians (including Taylor and Stills) have impeccable timing, and you won't hear better phrasing, ever. Its this wonderfully minimalist approach that has saved it from dating so badly, unlike other albums of the era and even some of Mitchell's later work such as Court and Spark. <br />The clean, melodic style and Joni's razor sharp voice make the cold clarity of CD the perfect medium to carry the message. And what a message, or messages there are; how many albums do you know that have no filler at all? The strength of the material is awesome, there really isn't a weak track on Blue, which might just make it unique.
B0000021RB|5.0|Without a doubt, Chicago Transit Authority is Chicago's best album to date.  After hearing Introduction, I'd doubt that you would disagree.  Chicago has really set the precedent for rock/funk/jazz bands of their time and current time.  This CD also contains classics such as Does Anyone Really Know What Time it is? and I'm a Man.  South California Purples is another example of Chicago slightly changes their styple to produce an awsome effect.  I'd recommend this CD to anyone who has an appreciation for rock and jazz.
B00005AXEL|5.0|This is an amazing CD..not only because it shows Stevie in top form again..FINALLY....but it is also one of the best CD's...musically, and lyrically, to come out from a major artist in years.<br />The most amazing parts of this cd are:<br />1. The writing - FINALLY almost EVERY song on here can be heard and understood easily...something not so easy in past Stevie songs....it's like she has come down to earth to speak to us in words we can finally understand!<br />2. The voice - Stevie seems to have re-discovered every aspect and tone of her voice again.  Her vocals have never been stronger.  On some of the songs you'd swear the vocals were recorded back in the 70's when she could hit all those high notes!  No unnecessary &quot;screams&quot; or &quot;whoooooooo's&quot; like in some of her past efforts (although the last line in &quot;Fall From Grace&quot; gave me chills when she yells &quot;make sure you surviiiiiiiive&quot;...sounds great!)<br />3. The music - The music on this CD would fit perfectly in the 70's, 80's, or 90's.  There is nothing that sounds &quot;dated&quot; like on Stevie's 80's work.  The updates are very subtle...some electrionic noises heard...a drum loop here an there..but mostly the sound is very organic.<br />Best songs:<br />FALL FROM GRACE: Simply ROCKS..but why is it the 2nd from last? Should have been placed earlier in the CD! SORCERER: Stevie and Sheryl sound as if they have been playing together for years...very intense!   PLANETS OF THE UNIVERSE:  Intensity builds up and just pulls you in so your lost in the song....love the fresh sounding music too! LOVE CHANGES: A very smooth, almost funky song....almost sexy sounding.  Again, Stevie's voice sounds so refreshed and new here. EVERYDAY: Not a Stevie song...but very pretty and poignant. TOO FAR FROM TEXAS: Not tooo country, not tooo pop...Stevie and Natalie sure blend well!<br />All in all an AMAZING CD!
B000000WJK|5.0|It can be argued that \\"A Storm in Heaven\\" predicted the post-rock movement popularized by Mogwai, Godspeed You Black Emperor!, and Sigur Ros. When it was released in 1993 it stood out sorely amongst the ugliness of grunge and the desolation of post-shoegaze, pre- Britpop England. But in retrospect, \\"A Storm in Heaven\\" was at least five years ahead of its time. On this their debut LP, Verve bypassed things like song structure and melody and concentrated on atmosphere. Tracks were left to unfold as they would through extended jams that were edited down to the album's final ten-track, forty-eight minute length. Paradoxically, the album--at its aforementioned length much shorter than many of today's behemoth works such as Spiritualized's \\"Ladies and Gentlemen...\\" and Mogwai's \\"Come On Die Young\\"--seems like an epic. The songs are relatively short, but their scope is huge. Witness the raging, cavernous guitars on opener \\"Star Sail\\" and \\"The Sun, The Sea\\". They sound so big they could have been recorded in an airport hangar. Then sample the delicate, blissed-out whale calls of \\"Already There\\" and \\"Beautiful Mind\\". Couple this with the inclusion of forebodingly blasting horns, punctuating several tracks such as the extended coda on the cacophonous \\"Butterfy\\", and the post-rock blueprint is complete. Verve would later be known as The Verve, and its songs would eventually take more form as they reached stardom on 1997's \\"Urban Hymns\\". But in \\"A Storm in Heaven\\" lies the true heart of a young band turning its nose at the constraints of \\"rock music\\". And in it lies the band's best album.

Daft punk presents their debut album here and the music could most definitely be described as genre defining.<br /> Combining modern synthesizers with retro vibes, they have created a brand of music that has a unique French flavor.

1563896656|3.0|When a device capable launching the incredible possibility of an aircraft is stolen from the English in 1898, her majesty assembles a very speacial task force to recover the device before the empire faces the horrors of arial warfare. The team consists of characters Moore borrowed from Victorian literature including Captain Nemo, Alan Quartermain, the Invisible Man, Dr. Jeckyl and Mr. Hyde. The book parodies Victorian literature, its bloated languege, its high-flying romaticism, its characters' pollitical incorrectness and obvious sexual hang-ups. While the tale is amusing and somewhat enjoyable, I think it may be too light-hearted to display what a compelling writer Alan Moore can truly be. To discover that, I point you to Watchmen, V for Vendetta or From Hell
B000002UAX|5.0|Another Beatle masterpiece.<br />The Beatles took a step back from the Pop psychedelia of SGT PEPPER and MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR, wrote a mountain of songs on the banks of the Ganges with the Maherishi, and put together a more acoustic, rural feeling for the WHITE ALBUM.<br />They touch a lot of bases here but, as always, there's still that...well, Beatle-ness to everything.<br />Though not a 'concept' album, this record is truly best if listened to straight throough, from beginning to end.<br />Track down a vinyl copy of the WHITE ALBUM; everyone should have their own copy of the iconic Beatle photos included in the original packaging.<br />By the way, the vocals on the final bit of &quot;Happiness Is A Warm Gun,&quot; the neo-doo-wop section, are among the best things the Beatles ever did.
0792110188|2.0|\\"El Dorado\\" is so hokey, one has to wonder if John Wayne was attempting a self-parody. Seriously, a film featuring Wayne, Robert Mitchum and James Caan should feature some great lines and excellent interaction. Alas, the story is tepid. Near as I can figure Wayne, Mitchum and Caan who (lamentably) are all on the same side, become involved in the classic struggle of some good ranchers vs. some bad ranchers. Though on the basis of what's on the screen, I had a hard time figuring out why I should really care which side won. Ed Asner plays the head of the villinous group, but he does so little on screen that its difficult to fathom why he's the bad guy. Caan is largley wasted in the role of the young knife thrower Wayne takes under his wing. After a couple of good early scenes, he sort of fades into the background. The subplot about Mitchum's drinking is laughable and Wayne struts through the movie as if he's phoning in his performance.<br />Much of the second half of the film is spent with our heros holed up at the jailhouse against the forces of evil. To get information and supplies, they keep sneaking out the back door and THE BAD GUYS NEVER CATCH ON TO THIS. Overall, this hokey Western is barely worth the time it takes to watch.
0345409671|5.0|i thought this book was very good, not boring at all like some other reviewers have said, but thats just my opinion. i found this to be a very interesting and compelling tale, even though it doesn't completely focus on the vampires like the other books in this series do. the only complaint i really have about &quot;Memnoch&quot; is that the first part of the story doesn't have much to do with the later part. but overall, its a very good book. i recommennd it.

6303109950|5.0|&quot;Tombstone&quot; has a remarkably impressive ensemble cast; Kurt Russell, Val Kilmer, Sam Elliott, Bill Paxton, Powers Boothe, Billy Bob Thorton, Michael Beihn.  But its Kilmer as Doc Holliday who truly steals the show.  Kilmer gives an powerhouse performance as the tuberculoic gunfighter who helps Russell's Wyatt Earp clean up the frontier town of Tombstone.  The movie makes an effort to remain close to the historical facts, thus the famous O.K. Corrall gunfight occurs near the middle of the movie.  Russell makes a decent centerpiece for the film, but Kilmer steals the show.  With his haunted eyes and sickly mannerisms, he is amazingly watchable.  Its a reminder of how good Kilmer can be when he wants to be.  Along with Eastwood's &quot;Unforgiven,&quot; &quot;Tombstone&quot; easilly rates as the best Western of the 1990s.
B00003CXFU|4.0|This was Julia Roberts best movie. The Academy awards weremean to her the past years and finally came around and gave her an oscar for her brilliant performance.
B00004Y6TQ|5.0|Even though this title has been out for a while, I only just picked it up. And now I regret it. I don't know what took so long. I own, or have owned everything by Bjork from Lifes too good, to Homogenic. I guess I'm making up for it now. Anyways, Selmasongs is truly incredible. It's so vibrant, fidgety, lush, and deep. Layers apon layers, and on top like a cherry is Bjorks gorgeous voice. Each song is self contained, not relying once on the conventions that make the individual tracks work. Very well written songs, and curious lyrics, and guest singers. My favorite track is &quot;I've seen it all&quot; [with guest voice of Thom Yorke (of Radiohead? I don't know.)] &quot;In the Musicals&quot; is lively as hell, and builds, and ebbs and flows like a show tune. This music, while being standard fare for Bjork, is so quirky and original. She has no equal, here or in Iceland.
B00003CYLT|5.0|I saw &quot;Journey of Man&quot; in 3-D and felt I could catch the Banquine flyers in my lap.  The movie is the next best thing to a live Cirque du Soleil show, even though nothing compares to the being there.  The soundtrack, written by Benoit Jutras, not only proves to be a great background for the film, it is great to listen to even without visuals.  I hope this movie is eventually released on DVD.
0671027344|5.0|&quot;That is how this is.&quot; This phrase is the closest I can come to describing how I felt reading The Perks of Being a Wallflower. While specific events from my life and narrator Charlie's differed, of course, Chbosky has amazingly and accurately captured every aspect of the high school experience. It does not allow sentimentality; instead the book recreates the daily cycle of laughing and crying that at once induces a warm smile and heartwrenching pain.
B00003CXN4|5.0|TRAFFIC, helmed by Steven Soderbergh (OUT OF SIGHT) triumphs in its documentary narration of how drugs have devastated and rooted in America. The 3 simple stories are linked together, each offering different perspective on the critical issue. Benicio Del Toro plays sublimely to effect a Mexican cop who witnesses the death of his buddy to drug syndicate. The power of drugs lead to intense and volatile obsession and violence as greed reign even amongst the politcal kingdom in Mexico. Michael Douglas plays an American senator who has taken over the Drugs Office to raid out drug trafficking, only to ironically discover his daughter has been abusing drugs. Family conflicts and emotions run high in this story and the climax is shattering and most heart-rendering. Don Cheadle and Luis Guzman portray undercover cops who is on the chase for a drug lord and when he is arrested, Catherine Zeta Jones as his wife takes over his business to support their child.<br />TRAFFIC is in fact this year's most outstanding film in terms of direction and acting. The ensemble elevates the intense atmosphere with their seasoned acting and the direction gives it an exciting documentary vision which stimulates reality. The story-telling builds up with a climax and is acutely thought -provoking without preaching morals. It leave the audience to think and dissect the world of drugs, though the insight is not really there yet. However, as a movie, it is unequivocally this year's best - it puts the motion in picture with Soderbergh's direction and leaves the audience hopelessly addicted to it.

B00003CXQX|4.0|This movie has the plainest animation of the past Disney movies, but it's the funnest. Even if you dislike Disney, you'll laugh and find this story thoroughly entertaining.<br />The characters were vivid, alive, and above all, fun. The voice casting was excellent.<br />This is different from the other animated features, and that's just fine. IT works better that way.
B000003TAW|5.0|NOPE  You throw in Rivers's unbelievable, and extremely recognizable voice, some great harmonies, awesome guitar rifs (Say It Ain't So, Undone!!) and even some sweet falsetto. You get a type of music that can only be described as Weezer. Its rock, its punk, its emo. Its just simply great. And if the music isn't good enough, there is no song writer like Rivers Cuomo. He reaches deep down and puts his soul into the song. The follow-up, Pinkerton, is a great CD, but not as good all around (all though Across the Sea is the best song ever) I don't know what to say? If you don't have this CD, get it. NOW!

B00004STDN|5.0|Has Sylvester Stallone ever made a 5-Star movie? You bet. \\"Rocky\\" is one, and \\"Cliffhanger\\" is the other. John Lithgow plays the perfect villan set beautifully in the snow covered Rockies. This movie is non-stop action and it has a bit of everything... like a nice plane crash scene; above average dialogue (yes, even for Sly); some good chases; kids on snowboards; and innocent people being mamed. There's even a few touching moments with Sly and his girlfriend (or should we say ex-girlfriend?). This DVD package offers some nice features and the widescreen version (with the great mountain views) is the only way to go. Stallone's made a ton of movies and this one is easily one of his best. Great movie!
B00003CXE7|5.0|When I look at a movie based on true, historical events, I look at it from two angles. 1. How accurate the movie is. 2. How enjoyable was it.<br />From an entertainment point of view, this movie was fantastic. It kept we on the edge of my seat, and it offered a wonderful glimpse into the mind set of the Romans during the peak of their empire. The fight scenes were the best of have seen in any movie, and the plot was wonderful.<br />From a historical point of view, this movie drives me nuts. Being a historical buff on the Roman Empire, I can't help it. The historical accuracy of this movie ended with the short blurb of text that appeared on the screen in the beginning of the movie. After that, the movie pretty much disrgarded the actual events, and continued on into a very enjoyable, but largely inaccurate story during the reign of Commodus.<br />Enjoy this movie for what it is, a great story LOOSELY based on history.

In assasins apprentice Fitz is trained in the arts of the assasin, and is also involed in the inner fight betweem the two princes. I assumed that in this book, Fitz would get a quest, to kill someone important or something like that. But the book is really only about politics at the court. Fitz does do some assasination, but these are only told of briefly. All in all a boring book that is not worth reading, you will only get irritated at the extremly slow pace and boring plot.
0790749815|5.0|Less resonant than &quot;Vertigo,&quot; more complex and layered than &quot;Rear Window,&quot; &quot;North by Northwest&quot; has something for everyone.  The title is from &quot;Hamlet,&quot; especially appropriate because of the film's plot movement from NYC to South Dakato and because of the protagonist.  Grant plays a character running from a protective mother, encountering a threatening version of Ophelia, and all the while putting on various &quot;antic dispositions&quot; while seeking to claim his own national identity and personal autonomy.  Hitchcock has not only taken his British actor but his own British classic, &quot;The 39 Steps,&quot; and transformed them into cinematic icons as recognizably American as Mount Rushmore.  The protagonist's flight starts from the United Nations and threatens to take on an international theme until the thrilling and delightful climactic action sequence.  The dispossessed hero on the run, Archie Leach, instantaneously becomes the American object of desire--Cary Grant--and Hitchcock becomes the consummate exploiter of American moviegoers' fears, dreams, desires in a segue that collapses fear and desire, death and sex into a closing moment as characteristically American as any conclusion in film.  Besides this unforgettable edit, the film contains one of Hitchcock's 3 most celebrated editing sequences: the tennis match from &quot;Strangers on a Train,&quot; the shower scene from &quot;Psycho,&quot; and in &quot;North by Northwest&quot; the low-flying plane that threatens to harvest Gary Grant.
B0000029DD|5.0|So I was goofing around in the cheapo bin at Virgin Records and I find GRACE, think &quot;Ah, I've heard the name, it's only $8, why not.&quot;  Bring it home, it sits a week or so, then I put it on the CD player and...well, it's been there for the last three weeks.  I CAN'T LISTEN TO ANYTHING ELSE.  <br />Where's OK Computer?  I...just...can't...eject it.  <br />Magnificent, haunting, lush and beautiful and it rocks.  Can't beat that.  To everyone who compared it to Zeppelin, I agree, but he actually surpasses it because his voice makes Plant's voice sound like a banshee and a housecat in a blender, plus he's so PASSIONATE.  I dunno, I feel like I'm stuck in an Edgar Allen Poe story.  Is it morbid to be so affected by someone who's dead?
B000056JYB|4.0|The world's first &quot;supergroup,&quot; consisting of Eric Clapton, Steve Winwood, Ginger Baker &amp; Rick Grech, Blind Faith fizzled out almost as quickly as they began---too many egos, too many cash-ins on the part of their managers, and a plagued U.S. tour sealed their fate. But amidst their all-too-brief whirlwind in 1969, the band DID manage to cobble together one single self-titled album, which still stands today as a classic. Containing just six songs, the &quot;Blind Faith&quot; album has held up just fine, thank you very much. &quot;Had To Cry Today,&quot; spearheaded by Clapton's unique fretboard, is a groovy headbobber. &quot;Can't Find My Way Home&quot; is one of Winwood's most heartfelt compositions, and Clapton's beautiful &quot;Presence Of The Lord&quot; is one of the biggest highlights of Slowhand's career. The band put an excellent, fresh spin on Buddy Holly's &quot;Well Alright,&quot; &quot;Sea Of Joy&quot; is another Winwood winner, and the big finish, Baker's &quot;Do What You Like,&quot; is a rock drummer's heaven. And let's not overlook the great bass contributions throughout from Grech, keeping this great rock outfit firmly anchored.The original six-song &quot;Blind Faith&quot; album easily earns 5 out of 5 stars, but this is the special 2001 re-issue version, which now makes &quot;Blind Faith&quot; a double album, containing five previously unreleased extended jams and a few other studio leftovers. Now, you'd think that by applying more material to the album, it would make this already-brilliant recording even more brilliant. But not so fast---while some of the extra material here IS a wonderful addition to the 1969 album, some other material comes across as excess flab that should've stayed in the vaults. First, the Good Stuff: the two solid versions of the blues number, &quot;Sleeping In The Ground&quot;; Winwood's engaging instrumental &quot;Time Winds&quot; (but was it intended to have lyrics, I wonder?); and the electric version of &quot;Can't Find My Way Home,&quot; which is just as lovely as the acoustic original. As for the five extended jams, the &quot;Acoustic Jam&quot; is a total keeper, &amp; &quot;Slow Jam #2&quot; is another inspired workout, with the band hitting a good groove and rocking it for all it's worth. The remaining three jams, however, despite the fine musicianship on display, are meandering and unmemorable---they don't really GO anywhere. But to be fair to the band, none of these jam sessions were originally intended for commercial release. Still, &quot;Acoustic Jam&quot; &amp; &quot;Slow Jam #2&quot; DO work, and like the regular album itself, they show what Clapton, Winwood &amp; the boys were capable of when they were cookin' together.Blind Faith's light shined much too briefly, but at least they left behind a terrific album before all was said and done. Most of the bonus material on this deluxe edition compliments the original record quite nicely, so if you're a big fan of this album, then this is certainly worth getting. 32 years later, &quot;Blind Faith&quot; is still a rock gem.
B000000H4V|5.0|In my honest opinion, this CD is worth the 15 bucks just for the live songs, those being &quot;Amen/Inner Self,&quot; and &quot;Territory.&quot;  I have heard live stuff from so many artists, but nothing, absolutley nothing, compares to the sheer brutalality I heard on those live songs.  Hands down the best live stuff I have ever heard from any band.  Until the day Sepultura come back to old form, those two songs will not be topped.

B00003CXR1|5.0|Last year, I reviewed the book CHOCOLAT by Joanne Harris. I'm happy to report that this film adaptation is even better than the print version. And how often can one say that with a straight face?<br />The film begins with a north wind blowing Vianne (Juliette Binoche) and her daughter Anouk (Victoire Thivisol) into a small French village at the very beginning of Lent, that pre-Easter period of time, which, in the Catholic liturgy, is dedicated to prayer and physical self-denial. It's not a good time for Vianne, an apparent non-Christian, to open up a chocolate shop across the town square from the church. But, she does so anyway, much to the dismay of the village mayor, the Comte de Reynaud (Alfred Molina). Reynaud is puritanically determined to shut the shop down, and Vianne is equally determined to keep it open. An irresistible force meets an immovable object.<br />CHOCOLAT, both the book and movie, is a whimsical comedy that blossoms as Lent progresses, and Vianne's shop becomes a place of healing and sanctuary for several of the town's troubled residents. Because Vianne's store is seen (by the local Church establishment) as diametrically opposed to the spirit of the season, the story can also be taken as a gentle fable of conflict between Christianity and paganism.<br />Juliette Binoche is exquisite in her role. (I think I'm in love.) Judi Dench is her usual superb best as Armande, an aged widow deprived of her grandson's company by an over-protective mother, Armande's own daughter (Carrie-Anne Moss). There's also a small role played by Leslie Caron. (Where's she been in recent years?) And Alfred Molina is positively brilliant as the uptight mayor, so dominant that he personally writes the Sunday sermons to be delivered by the local pastor, Fr. Henri, apparently only recently ordained and much in fear of the Comte. Johnny Depp has an engaging role as one member of a band of despised river gypsies just floating through.<br />One very good reason why CHOCOLAT the film is better than CHOCOLAT the book is the added dimension of visualization which the former imparts to several elements of the storyline, specifically the mysterious wind that blew our heroine into town, Anouk's pet Pantoufle, the delectable chocolates themselves (seductively arrayed in the shop window), and the climax of the conflict between Vianne and the Comte.<br />CHOCOLAT the film is one that will have the audience leaving the theater feeling good, and maybe wishing for a cup of Vianne's hot chocolate with a pinch of cayenne pepper. I can't recommend this cinematic gem enough.film is better than CHOCOLAT the book is the added dimension of visualization which the former imparts to several elements of the storyline, specifically the mysterious wind that blew our heroine into town, Anouk's pet Pantoufle, the delectable chocolates themselves (seductively arrayed in the shop window), and the climax of the conflict between Vianne and the Comte. <br />CHOCOLAT the film is one that will have the audience leaving the theater feeling good, and maybe wishing for a cup of Vianne's hot chocolate with a pinch of cayenne pepper.

B000002V0Q|2.0|No doubt this is a good metal album. But,a swith all others MEGADETHs releases, along the middle of it you cant handle Mustaines awful vocals any longer. So you stop and listen to the rest of the album later. Friedmans solos are also boring, plain flat and rough, no feeling at all. The good parts are the lyrics and the rhythm guitars. All in all, a good effort, but it should not have eleven tracks. Eight would do it...
B000002KDG|5.0|After the quiet, soft sounds of Comes A Time, Neil Young &amp; Crazy Horse followed that album up with angry, powerful rock of Rust Never Sleeps.  Inspired by the punk movement, Mr. Young fashioned an album of critical songs with powder keg intensity.  It's not all about electric guitars as the first five songs are acoustic based, but they are powerful in their delivery.  &quot;My, My, Hey, Hey (Out Of The Blue)&quot; is about Elvis Presley &amp; Johnny Rotten, rock &amp; punk and contains his most famous line, &quot;it's better to burn out than fade away&quot;, which has become part of the lexicon.  &quot;Powderfinger&quot;, &quot;Welfare Mothers&quot; and &quot;Sedan Delivery&quot; are among the most outspoken and critical songs of his career and the punk ethos he brings to them add more bite and edge.  &quot;Pocahontas&quot; is one of the best songs Mr. Young has ever written, with its vivid lyrics of a trapper who would give 1,000 pelts just to sleep with Pocahontas, the song is powerful, imaginative and absolutely brilliant.  The album closes out with a full blow reprise of the opener, this time titled &quot;Hey, Hey, My, My (Into The Black)&quot; and its echoes the sentiments of the acoustic take.  Rust Never Sleeps was a great work and a big hit, peaking at number 7 on the album charts.
B000002KIK|4.0|This album is the living proof of the original Sabbatha line-ups sheer creative genius. The band recorded this album in 1978 in the middle of internal struggles that would result in Ozzy leaving the band. And, even in the middle of this turmoil, Sabbath released an original rock album, a real gem in terms of creativity. The album is different, but is not that kind of diference due to arrogance or indulgence. Its just the genius of the musicians flowing free, letting themselves out for a minute of long standard formulas. The tittle track is stunning, sheer power, four chords, simple drums and Ozzy singing at this best.
B000002KDI|5.0|Neil Young actually performed the show that would become Rust Live prior to the release of his ground breaking Rust Never Sleeps album.  He had released the quieter Comes A Time and the album opens up in that vein as the first nine or so songs are in the acoustic vein.  The album opens up with the incredible &quot;Sugar Mountain&quot; and then moves into a Buffalo Springfield chestnut &quot;I Am A Child&quot;.  &quot;After The Gold Rush&quot; is always a highlight and &quot;The Needle &amp; The Damage Done&quot; is quite powerful. When the band cracks up the volume, the show takes on a primal fury.  &quot;Like A Hurricane&quot; is searing, &quot;Cinnamon Girl&quot; explodes like a powder keg, &quot;Cortez The Killer&quot; is a droning swirl of guitars and &quot;Tonight's The Night&quot; is soaring elegy.  The four songs that appear on Rust Never Sleeps, &quot;My, My, Hey, Hey&quot;, &quot;Sedan Delivery&quot;, &quot;Powderfinger&quot; &amp; &quot;Hey, Hey, My, My&quot; all reveal why the album was so great.  Neil Young has released numerous live albums and Live Rust ranks right up at the top.
B00005AACC|1.0|I have absolutely nothing against brainless action movies. I liked most of Arnold or Stallones action movies. But this MI2 cast Cruise in his worst effort ever, a totally commercial effort aiming just at money, money and more money, with an awful cast ( Hopkin was thrown into it to act for three minutes ... ) Theres no chemistry between Cruise and the female thief... The villain is a joke, one of worst performances by a bad guy I have ever seen. Lets check the &quot;action&quot; sequences: the one in the motorcycles is disgraceful to the genre, mainly when the two guys jump from their bikes. Im not complaining about reality, Im shocked by the way Cruise destroyed Ethan Hunts character forever, changing him into a kind of arrogant and indulgent Rambo. The opening sequence was made, I guess, to show the audience not the lies that would come, but just the lack of heart this movie would show... Irc. The worst action movie I ever watched.
B00005AXEL|5.0|I am a die-hard Stevie Nicks fan, and will listen to anything she does.  However, I must admit that I found her previous album &quot;Street Angel&quot; to be a bit anemic.  I couldn't wait for this new CD to be released, and it was well worth the wait.  Every song is skillfully crafted and recorded.  Stevie's voice is tremendous.  It is great to hear her singing a few folky ballads (flashes of the old &quot;Landslide&quot; days), and also belting out great rock tunes e.g. &quot;Fall from Grace&quot;.  The musicians backing her up are all great, and this CD should represent a true return to power for this lovely enchantress.  I hoped for this very thing (a new solo album) when I watched Stevie on VH1 &quot;Story Tellers&quot;, and now the wish is fulfilled. Welcome back, Stevie, in your absence we have longed for you and you have become more beautiful than ever!
B000050IMJ|1.0|CAge made another clever move to make huge money accepting to star this garbage, the worst production ever by producer Jerry. THis movie lacks: a) heart - commercially driven beyond limits; b) acting - with a screenplay like this, even Pacino could not save this bomb; c) exciting car chases - the car chase with the SHelby is boring, almost slept; d) plot - they managed to destroy the original film of 1974. Be it: even this being a remake, they didn´t have a good plot !!<br />All in all, I went into the movie to watch as a brainless action movie. But even so it was disgraceful. SAd.
0792836502|5.0|This film is a textbook on how to present a sweeping visual story on the wide screen.  I saw this movie in the theater when it was first released, and have seen it uncounted times over the years.  Every scene is finely crafted, expertly composed and skillfully photographed.  Many sequences have served as blueprints for other filmmakers in subsequent decades.  The lead actors are outstanding in their roles, with Eli Wallach worthy of special note.  MUST be seen in widescreen format, as it was crafted by its creator.  Most highly recommended.
B00005ASOC|3.0|Good movie, It really reaches for the heart, but comes up a little short.  Sean Connery give his usual outstanding performance. I found the story to be lacking substance and cliche. Overall, worth the rental - I wouldn't rate it high in replay value.
B00000BKDY|4.0|This album is ver very good. Every Album from Maiden are good. Here we can clearly see how good a songwriter Adrian Smith is and what a great guitar player he truly is. Some say that this albumis to polished... Why? I have never heard an album to be too polished. Every album from Maiden are like diamonds. The best songs are Caught somewhere in time, Sea of Madness and Alexander the great. Now you people who haven't heard anything from Maiden don't listen to this right away. Listen to Brave New World and Piece of Mind.
B000009QPG|5.0|When I think of the truely great metal albums of the late eighties and early ninties three albums stand out to me the most, Megadeths rust in peace, Metallicas and justice for all, and Slayers seasons in the abyss. This album is without a question the best produced best sounding album slayer has ever done. The album is so well put together from war ensemble to dead skin mask to my favorite slayer song of all seasons in the abyss. I think slayer was on top of there game for this album, and I was truely dissapointed with there follow up efforts after this album. If you dont have this one there is something wrong with you. dave lombardo is a god and so is kerry king. DAN
0141000198|4.0|OK, I have to confess that I saw the movie first, and then read the book.  So, my reaction is very, very much effected by the flick.  But since a fair number of people are going to be in the same position that I was, I thought lovers of the movie who want to know if they should pick up the novel might profit from someone else who had been in the same position.<br />First, I utterly adored the movie, and was genuinely stunned at Renee Zellweger's performance.  I have always been a fan of hers, but she is so thoroughly American that it was very, very hard to imagine her playing a Brit.  I will confess that for the first 15 minutes of the movie that her accent really bothered me.  No, she didn't botch it.  She sounded quite acceptably English.  It was simply that all these scenes from JERRY MAGUIRE and DAZED AND CONFUSED and ME, MYSELF, AND IRENE and NURSE BETTY kept playing in my mind, and in all those she spoke very, very differently.  But once I adjusted, I loved her, her performance, and the movie as a whole.  So much so that I wanted to read the book.<br />Coming to the book after the movie is a mild disappointment.  The primary reason is that Renee Zellweger was so utterly delightful, that the novel suffers somewhat by comparison.  Nonetheless, the book itself has sufficient wit, personality, and diversity to delight someone who has seen the movie first.  There are the usual variances between the events in the novel and those in the book, but a surprisingly large number of events were common to both.<br />I found one thing utterly amazing in the novel:  both of the male leads of the movie are mentioned explicitly in the book.  At one point in the book Bridget decides to watch the BBC production of PRIDE AND PREJUDICE.  She starts comparing her Mark Darcy with the Mr. Darcy of the TV series.  The part of Mr. Darcy in the BBC series was played by Colin Firth, who also played Mark Darcy in the movie.  Furthermore, on her job she suggests that her TV show do a segment on the real life romance between the actors who played Darcy and Elizabeth:  Colin Firth and Elizabeth.<br />The other actor mentioned was Hugh Grant, and his mention was not at all flattering.  In fact, I am somewhat surprised that Hugh Grant agreed to be in the movie given his appearance in the novel.  The novel has a couple of characters debating why Elizabeth Hurley stays with Hugh Grant after his high publicized encounter with a prostitute.  Now, it surprises me that Grant took the role because he surely knew that the flick would increase the number of readers of the book.  On the other hand, perhaps he (probably correctly) assumes that everyone already knows about that incident.  And I have to admit that I do admire the fact that his willingness to be so public after an admittedly embarrassing incident like that does increase my admiration of him.  Not that the incident took place, but that he is determined to get on with his life despite a mistake in judgment.<br />So, I do think that someone who has seen the movie first, will definitely enjoy this book.  And I will add to what has been said by other reviewers:  this book is a very, very fast read.  But also a very, very fun read.t on the real life romance between the actors who played Darcy and Elizabeth:  Colin Firth and Elizabeth.  <br />The other actor mentioned was Hugh Grant, and his mention was not at all flattering.

B000002GEY|5.0|I had heard of Supertramp before &quot;Breakfast...&quot;. I had heard &quot;Bloody Well Right&quot; from &quot;Crime Of The Century&quot; and &quot;Give A Little Bit&quot; from &quot;Even In The Quietest Moments&quot; from the radio. What I hadn't done, was take Supertramp seriously enough to buy an album. That changed with &quot;Breakfast In America&quot;. &quot;The Logical Song&quot;, &quot;Goodbye Stranger&quot; and &quot;Take The Long Way Home&quot; made me a Supertramp fan. I now own several Supertramp CD(s), &quot;Breakfast...&quot;, &quot;Crime...&quot; and &quot;Paris&quot; among them. &quot;Breakfast...&quot; may or may not be the all-time Supertramp recording, but it did get my attention. I love this CD. I think I love &quot;Paris&quot; even more, which was recorded from the &quot;Breakfast&quot; tour. Geddy Lee and Rush don't have anything over Supertramp. Rush was just more serious. Supertramp was just plain fun. Kind of like the comparison between Pearl Jam (Serious) and The Stone Temple Pilots (Silly). Who says music has to be serious anyway? At the time, 1979, I was a high school senior. Everybody from my parents to my school teachers, counselors, principals and maybe even the old farts who patroned the bar next door to our house wanted me to GET SERIOUS. Enter &quot;Breakfast...&quot; and &quot;The Logical Song&quot;. Again, maybe, maybe not their best work - but it helped shape &quot;who I am&quot; today. As it turned out, &quot;Breakfast...&quot; made me get serious about buying Supertramp albums, and also made me understand it was OK to forget getting serious about life at 18 years old. For the record, I ended up being a Systems Engineer for a railroad and mass transit signal systems supplier, as well as being a devoted husband and father of three children. SUPERTRAMP ROCKS. Buy them all.
B000002KHF|5.0|The other day I was starving, and decided that what I needed more than anything was some Mexican food.  I found a fajita bar and restaurant, so I sauntered in and ordered some shrimp fajitas and a strawberry margarita, along with some nachos.  But the real treat was that the second I entered, the bartender put a CD of MOONDANCE on to play.  The next 45 minutes were utter ecstasy:  great food, good liquor, and utterly awesome music!<br />A few years ago I lost a goodly portion of my record/CD collection, and one of the albums I lost was this one.  I replaced it shortly after leaving the restaurant I mentioned above.  I am somewhat surprised that it took me so long to think about replacing it.  I am one of those who believes that Van Morrison is one of the very best singers of the rock and roll era.  In fact, at his best I believe he might have been the best.  Others have had better natural voices, a greater range, more warmth, more tonality.  But Van has one thing that no other singer beats him at:  phrasing.  He is also one of the few singers (I have to confess that I can't think of a second one, but assume that there must be another) who can sing a ten minute song with no choruses or instrumental breaks and keeps it fascinating every inch of the way (just listen to him sing &quot;Cyprus Avenue&quot; or &quot;Madame George&quot; off ASTRAL WEEKS or &quot;Listen to the Lion&quot; off ST. DOMINIC'S PREVIEW).  The relatively short songs on MOONDANCE don't afford him the opportunity to show off his enormous phrasing abilities, but he nonetheless performs every song on the album flawlessly.<br />Of all the great albums that Van did in the late sixties and early seventies (his greatest period, but I have to add that he has remained remarkably productive his entire career), this album is one of the more commercial that he did.  The songs are a bit less artsy, less poetic, and a lot closer to pop.  They are also a bit shorter than the songs on other albums of the same period, a bit brighter, and perhaps a bit more conservative.  But they are mavelous songs without exception.  Several of them are among the greatest songs that Van ever did.<br />But as great as the songs on this record, one stands out as among his greatest:  &quot;Into the Mystic.&quot;  The words just before the song closes out are among the finest and wonderfully ironic in all of rock:  &quot;It is too late to stop now.&quot;<br />I would like to add one more thing.  The horns on this recording are just marvelous, and while on my liner notes no individual is credited for the arrangements, I am assuming that Van, since he was the producer, must have had a major role in the arrangements.  And a splendid job he did.<br />To me, there are several albums by Van Morrison that every serious rock fan should own.  The miracle is that as good as this one is, it is not his best.  That clearly belongs to ASTRAL WEEKS, which it probably one of the five greatest albums in all of rock.  But I can't imagine anyone not being utterly delighted with this super record.d, a bit brighter, and perhaps a bit more conservative.  But they are mavelous songs without exception.

031286504X|4.0|I read in a review that this was the book that inspired Stephen King to write horror..so, of course, I ran to the library to check this bad boy out...I loved it! Your heart goes out to the main character Robert Neville. Imagine being the only one to survive the plague. A plague that has turned everyone into vampires. The vampires' lures and taunts became a part of his everyday life.....while he struggles with justifying reasons why he should keep on fighting if he's the only human left.After years of holing himself in his house at night, (complete with soundproof walls to block the vampires' screams), and slaying vampires during the day, he meets a woman. And together they fight to stay alive....With a twist at the end that you wouldn't believe...this is definetely worth the time...The only thing that keeps me from giving it 5 stars is that it was so short...it left me wanting more.....which is not a bad thing.....
6305609691|5.0|Forget about whether or not this was the &quot;real&quot; Vietnam.  And forget about whether you like Brando's Kurtz or not.  See this movie for the fabulous cinematography and some of the most incredible scenes ever filmed and for the terrific narration, &quot;we cut em in half with machine guns, then put a bandaid on it.  It's how we lived with ourselves&quot; (much of it by Michael Herr who wrote Dispatches, one of the best books to come out of the Vietnam war)and the great cast lead by a young Martin Sheen.<br />&quot;Rock'n'Rollers with one foot in their graves&quot;....that's who by and large fought that war. And, Coppola is very sympathetic to them.  But not so to their elders and their leaders. Guerilla warfare with teenagers &quot;Cool had come from some Bronx hellhole, and the heat and light of Vietnam had put the zap on his brain&quot;.<br />Coppola's film is also about the clash of cultures...the 60's America of drugs and rock'n'roll,  technology &amp; materialism, fighting this insane jungle war in a basically feudal society unchanged for centuries.  <br />Water skiing behind the boat, the waves overturning sampans;  surfing under motarfire and having steaks and beer afterword; Playboy bunnies dancing at a firebase camp &amp; causing a riot &quot;Charlie didn't get USO, his only way home was victory.&quot;; the orders to murder a Colonel who the Brass &quot;had been grooming for a top slot in the Corporation&quot;...a Colonel who had left hypocrisy behind and now waged total guerilla war.<br />The trip up the river to Colonel Kurtz is definitely worth taking.  Coppola's movie is about the progressive insanity of the war and the deeper Sheen's Willard and his reluctant Navy boat crew get into the jungle the crazier it all gets until they reach the Heart of Darkness...Kurtz's nihilistic camp of no-holds-barred, no remaining human restraints or compassion, all-out brutal warfare.  &quot;Method?  I don't see any method here at all....&quot;<br />There is somuch good stuff here that 1000 words won't do it justice.  This is as much an examination of the American psyche in that war than it is of the actual fighting of the war.  It is brilliant art, not a documentary. <br /> Whatever else he may NOT have accomplished in this film, Coppola genuinely caught the insanity, lies and hypocrisy of that savage war that took naive American boys into a vicious guerilla war with atrocities committed on all sides to no discernible purpose.  He exposed the Dark Heart under the platitudes.  A great film of ideas framed by indelible, unforgettable images.  A Classic.
B000002U8G|4.0|Around the time Meddle came out Pink Floyd was in the middle of a transition.  This period transformed them from a psychedelic acid-driven band headed by Syd Barret to a mysterious band filled with thoughts of paranoia, schizophrenia, among others that played longer, looser songs mainly written by Waters.  This album is highly experimental in Floyd's case touching on blues and jazz, among other things.  This was much the way Revolver was for the Beatles, experimental and new.  Meddle starts out with the instrumental One of These Days which I feel is an okay song, nothing special but a good way to start off an album it is up tempo and bass driven.  Then Meddle slows down for the beautifully meloncholly A Pillow of Winds, a great song.  Next is Fearless, one of the best songs Pink Floyd songs of all time, it is softer and uncharacteristic of the band but it is brilliant in its own way.  San Tropez is okay, it has a laid back attitude but doesn't fit Floyd as well as there later stuff.  Seamus is bluesy and short but not bad by any means.  Echoes is another one of the most amazing Floyd songs of all time, this long epic is what this band is all about, the long jams and dark lyrics of Roger Waters all rolled into 23 minutes of pure godliness.  All in all Meddle is a very good album with shades of greatness, as evident in Fearless and Echoes.
B000000OQY|4.0|This is Guns N' Roses at their very rawest. This album has to be broken into two pieces. The first side contains four rowdy numbers from their sleazy Sunset Strip days. Two are covers (&quot;Nice Boys&quot; and &quot;Mama Kin&quot;), two originals (&quot;Reckless Life&quot; and &quot;Move to the City&quot;). All of the songs on side 1 are solid, punked- out metal boogies. Side 2 contains four acoustic numbers, including the Top 5 Hit &quot;Patience,&quot; &quot;Used to Love Her,&quot; a slowed- down version of &quot;You're Crazy,&quot; and &quot;One in a Million.&quot; Side 2 received much criticism for slamming just about everyone, including gays, women, and African Americans. Guns N' Roses were a metallic precurser for Eminem. On the whole, the record is a solid effort. They were perfect role models for me when I was 12. They were obscene, angry, immature, and represented everything anti- authority (see the &quot;Appetite for Destruction&quot; cover&quot;). However, people grow up and out of old toys. This record is for those age 12-19. Unfortunately, most of Guns N' Roses fans are ages 22-29 and have moved on.
B00005ASOC|5.0|I think I have only commented on one other movie, and it was done to illustrate how to take a Pulitzer Prize winning book and turn it into swill. \\"Finding Forrester\\", was a brilliant film and a breath of fresh air from Hollywood's production line of big budgeted films, with stars with egos and paychecks that are even more ludicrous, and special effects that fill-in for plot, and for acting, and actors.<br />Mr. Sean Connery is a rare treasure in so much as time continues he seems almost immune to it. His films have consistently won him the recognition he deserved once he stepped down from the James Bond Series. Nothing wrong with Bond, but the films are just not taken seriously by the \\"exalted\\" film critics.<br />First a correction that needs to be made is that the fictional character of Forrester may have chosen a reclusive lifestyle after he wrote a Pulitzer Novel, however to compare him with Author J. D. Salinger is to either admit a person has not seen the movie, or who's knowledge of Salinger is non existent. That are plenty of biographies out there about Salinger and a quick glimpse will show the differences that make a comparison between the fictionalized character Forrester and Salinger to be absurd. To suggest a comparison between this and, \\"Karate Kid\\" films is to parade one's stupidity.<br />So what did this film offer, not one or two, but three Academy Award Winners, and a brand new talent that was at least deserving of a nomination? The man who brought us Salieri in \\"Amadeus\\", an Irish Cop in \\"The Untouchables\\", and a stunning performance as a young girl in \\"The Piano\\" made this movie special. Mr. Robert Brown is a new face to movies, and he too will eventually be rewarded for his talents, as Jamal he was excellent.<br />No violence, no sex, and no special effects equals little notice with rare exception. The one film Company who consistently denies the death of quality filmmaking is Merchant Ivory Films, and then there are the independents.<br />The film is not perfect but it is vastly superior to the majority of films that were offered in 2000. For the price of the DVD you get a great cinema experience, can sit at home with no one repeating dialogue to his or her neighbor, or having the \\"Cougher\\" who inhabits every film. And as a bonus a night at home with this film is cheaper than going to your local Megaplex with 30+ screens, much fewer titles, and a panorama of mediocrity.lm is not perfect but it is vastly superior to the majority of films that were offered in 2000.

B000000OSE|3.0|Use Your Illusion II sold more records than part I for a reason. Illusion II has better songs. This record starts off with a number of weak recordings, including the annoying &quot;Right Next Door to Hell,&quot; &quot;Dust N' Bones,&quot; (1 Izzy song was enough), and a cover of Wings' &quot;Live and Let Die,&quot; a song that never should have been a single. The album provides solid efforts, however. &quot;Dead Horse,&quot; &quot;Double Talkin' Jive,&quot; &quot;You Ain't the First,&quot; and especially &quot;Bad Apples&quot; are all good songs. But this album succeeded only because of &quot;Don't Cry&quot; and &quot;November Rain,&quot; two marvellous tunes that were recorded during the Appetite for Destruction era (1987-1988). The problem with GN'R was they worked hard and wrote great numbers when they had to. After they hit it big, it was a slow but steady freefall from the top. As a life- long GN'R fan, I would recommend buying this album only after purchasing the other four records. Illusion I is pretty good, but certainly not their best effort.
B00005IC2H|5.0|I'm not as much of a fan of noise rock as the previous reviewer, but maybe it's because I just haven't heard enough bands as good as Sigur Ros.

B000059H98|5.0|Tank Girl is, make no mistake, a campy B sci-fi. It lives up to the genre perfectly, keeping a light, humorous tone in a world so dark that it would make most of us hide under the bed. It's probably no surprise that someone like Tank Girl would survive the apocalypse.<br />Lori Petty's character is perfectly witty, a girl who plays it large and in charge even when things are at their worst. She can kill an armed man and then answer the irritated stares of his buddies with &quot;What?&quot; While McDowell's character tries to break her in for a mission, she spends all her time coming up with lines to really get under his skin--and succeeds.<br />The complaints of some accusing McDowell of hamming up the role of the villain are unfounded; he not only plays the role perfectly, but does it so well that I don't think anyone else could have done it. He's playing the stereotypical megalomaniac bad guy, yes, but on top of that he adds a touch of class and intelligence. His repartee with Tank Girl proves he's nearly a match for her wit with flippant remarks. He's a very bright guy with an ingenious solution to an ongoing problem, who's simply flummoxed by the dauntlessly rude spirit of his opponent. McDowell is brilliant enough as an actor to get all these characteristics across. Bravo.<br />The plot gives us a nice, reasonable adventure without being overly simplistic; the campy tone prevents it from getting any more complex. The off-the-wall antics of Tank Girl bleed over at times from the character to the movie itself, which gets a bit goofy (in a good way) in parts where you'd never otherwise expect it to. In the middle of the film they break into a musical number in the silliest of venues--it might not be logical but it's a whole lot of fun. All this is carried along by a soundtrack pretty well suited to the film, arranged appropriately enough by Courtney Love.<br />For sheer entertainment (though not a family film, if that wasn't obvious), Tank Girl is really worthwhile. The DVD is noticeably light on features, but for the price I can live with it. If you enjoy a movie that doesn't take itself seriously, Tank Girl is for you.
078322804X|5.0|I'll start off by saying in the entire history of American cinema, this is my run-away favorite of all time. There is NO movie like the original Blues Brothers. This is the only movie that makes me laugh with every viewing. It makes me want to jump up and dance, grab my guitar, drink a beer, and bring on the happy tears.<br />Belushi steals this movie in my opinion and that's hard to do with the equally great Elwood. From the opening notes of 'She Caught the Katy' to the finale 'Jailhouse Rock' this movie brings a clever one-liner, a great song, or fast cars every second. This movie has no lull anywhere.<br />Aretha Franklin, James Brown, Ray Charles, Cab Callowy, and the great John Lee Hooker all sing in this one along with 'The Blues Brother's Band'. Jake and Elwood's singing performances are superb. How anyone can dismiss this movie is beyond me. I look at it as a lesson in life. The good will win (no matter how bad they may be).<br />The session musicians are also excellent. Even the 'geek' of the band Merv is great and they all fit into the motley crew band. Steve 'The Colonal' Cropper, Donald 'Duck' Dunn, Willie 'two bit' Hall, Tom 'Bones' Malone, Matt 'Guitar' Murphey, Alan 'Mr. Fabulous' Rubin, and Lou 'Blue Lou' Marini can all be proud of their involvement with this film.<br />The wrecking of a public mall is classic (You got us into this parking lot Motorhead, now you get us out!) If that ain't enough, then wait for the finale. Jake and Elwood race to the tax center with Chicago police (cars, horses, helicopters, and boats), Nazis, the US Army (complete with every weapon to include tanks), a swat team, firemen, and a really mad country band in a winnebago in chase. The chase scene is so over the top it must be seen to be believed.<br />Also watch for Carrie Fisher, John Candy, and a brief cameo by Paul Rubins (Pee Wee Herman).<br />We miss you Joilet Jake, without you the Blues Brothers just ain't right.
0783114222|5.0|\\"From The Earth To The Moon\\" is not just a series with good acting,eccellent special effects and surprising stories on the space program and the Moon flights.For those that grew up watching this history,it is a document of the times and for this Australian who devoured every scrap of information as a child(every Time and Newsweek and news article),it took me back to those wonderful moments.I still remember as a child hearing about Alan Shepard's suborbital flight and,on Feb 20th 1962,my local Perth Australia TV station for the first time stayed on \\"all day\\" to cover the flight.In between the cartoons and black and white American TV shows,there were updates on John Glenn's epic orbit of the Earth.For this 7 year old,it was an exciting day as Perth turned it's lights on for John and for decades on called itself \\"the city of light\\".In 1969,I watched Neil Armstrong walk on the moon with my family and when The three astronauts toured the world,our state declared a public holiday to welcome them to Western Australia and the crowd sang \\"happy birthday\\" to a surprised Michael Collins.These DVDs cover all the spaceflights brilliantly,from Ed White's first spacewalk,the Gemini flights,the Apollo 1 fire and the moon landings.They tell us the unknown stories,of people trying to convince NASA that a separate Moon lander was needed and how they were scoffed at and the episode on Apollo 13 tells the story from the medias point of view.Alan Shepard's Moon golf shot is well known,but who knew about Buzz Aldrin performing a Catholic ceremony on the Moon or Alan Bean and Pete Conrad sneaking a timer to the Moon to try and photograph themselves together mugging in front of the surveyor craft?From The Earth To The Moon takes us back to the 1960s with all it's turmoil and history.The efforts to create the lander were epic and took many years and also the efforts to create this huge rocket with it's millions of parts were equally so.From The Earth To The Moon tells of what a huge effort it took to develop the technology and to land on the moon,with many dangers and mishaps and triumphs along the way.It is more than an Emmy Award winning series,it is part of history and a document of the times.
B00000K19E|1.0|A rip off of the movie &quot;Dark City&quot;.  All they did was add boring action.  What a waste.
B00000JPYQ|5.0|I'll keep this short.If you like great guitar playing then this album is a must have.Schenker is one of the most underrated guitar players in rock and roll and he does it all on this album.From high octane runs to slower melodic pieces he always finds the perfect mix of notes.Song selection is great {it's basically a best of album} and i am REALLY glad i picked this up.
B00004WLXZ|5.0|TRIUMPH OF THE WILL has long been viewed through a dual perspective:  It is both reviled by many for its glorification of Hitler, and at the same time praised for the masterful work of its director, the legendary Leni Riefenstahl (who at the time of this writing is still alive...I think she's over 100 by now).  The truth is, it is all of that and more - a highly memorable, fascinating experience on several levels:<br />1.  Despite the subject matter, it must be acknowledged that this film does what it was made to do marvelously well:  It is a masterpiece of the art of propaganda...somethng that is practiced every day by all governments, in advertising, and in all political campaigns - but never better than this. The film does an amazing job of tapping deep into the German psyche, with scenes of Nuremburg, youth, etc., and allusions to great Germans of the past, all designed to tug at the &quot;volkish&quot; national sentiment, then deftly superimposed with images of Hitler.  Very crafty, but no different than what we see every day in our media-saturated world.  <br />2.  As a study of the early the Nazi era, it is invaluable.  Regardless of what happened in the years that followed, TRIUMPH needs to be viewed as a statement of its own era, when none of the horrors had yet happened and many around the world still referred to the Nazi regime (which was then consolidating power and trying to reach the hearts and minds of the people) as &quot;the German renaissance&quot;.  The commentary track adds a fascinating &quot;what happened to that Nazi?&quot; perspective.  <br />3.  This film has become unbelievably influential (possibly because it is still required viewing in film schools); it is perhaps second only to THE BATTLESHIP POTEMKIN as the most visually quoted film in hstory.  Just a few examples:  The closing scene in STAR WARS, &quot;Be Prepared&quot; from THE LION KING, and especially the entrance of Commodus into Rome from GLADIATOR are all lifted directly from visuals in TRIUMPH.  Even more common is the visual &quot;homage&quot; that directors sometimes subtly insert, such as the woman being tossed in the air from THE BIG LEBOWSKI (remember the kid at the beginning of TRIUMPH)?  The list goes on and on.   <br />One certainly does not need to sympathize with the Nazis to appreciate this film.  In fact, it is precisely because of what became of them that makes this early look so fascinating.  Still, I would not call this &quot;entertainment&quot;; rather, this is a piece to study and analyze.  Recommended for any student of history, sociology, mass media, or film.
0345423496|3.0|Compared to the extraordinary events from the first two books, this fourth and final book in the Odyssey series is downright petty.  The mysterious Monolith, so alien in 2001, so unbelieveably powerful in 2010, is in fact nothing more than antique automation, easily toppled by humans in the brief span of a few short chapters. <br />The first half of this volumne is the most interesting, as Frank Poole's body is discovered, reanimated, then left to explore Earth 1000 years in the future.  I was fascinated as I discovered new things along with Poole, but upon later reflection about Clarke's vision of the future, I didn't find much substance.  Once we are given the tour of Mankind, 3001, Poole treks back to Juptier to confront his past, but with all the suspense of a Sunday picnic.  The contact with Dave Bowman is little more than a &quot;Hi&quot;, and the final confrontation with the monolith entity is so rushed I wonder if Clarke got fed up with the whole series and decided he couldn't be bothered with it anymore.
B00004Z459|1.0|Just looking through reviews here, I find a lot of 5 stars for this album, now how can that be possible still riddles my mind. Probably because ppl that like real music don't even bother to look at this band, even less to acctualy listen to it. Well, I had a major bad luck, with a friend of mine, coming to me all worked up about this new, excellent, beautiful &quot;new&quot; band and music that they make. After having to sit through an hour of painful scratching and alt-wanna-be-noise, I had to take some painkillers. Two prozac pills did well after I showed them in my ears, reducing sonic pain to a manegable level.  I am so sad that I had to see this kind of evolving of music, with boy-rock-bands that can't make a decent tune. It's not heavy, it's not hard, it's not well-played nor well sung. It is, by all means, the NEW nothing, and I am not sure that music can sink any lower than this. Oh, maybe by adding a female-singer ala Aguilera, or something like that and call it metal-rap-pop-over-the-top-fussion (with a slight touch of R&amp;B).  I dread that we shall see that coming soon. In the mean time, I'm going to put something more originall in my cd-player, like Primus, or Alice, or Kyuss, or Faith, or Davis.  You do get the picture ? And to reduce my vomiting reflexes, and to try to pull myself out of this lack of good music misery, I'll go and check out new sleeve for upcoming Tool album. I feel sick, I feel sick, I.....
B00004RIV4|4.0|i agree with some of the reviewers on here who have said that this album discards all of the kooky electro sounds of 'i am not a doctor' in favour of a 'big band' sound - which occasionally works but is nowhere near as bizarre or catchy as some of the tracks on 'i am not a doctor' ('dr. zee', the fantastic 'sorry', and 'knee deepen').  <br />the vocals are great, but i prefer listening to 'i am not a doctor' instead of this because of the great production and songs which are more weird and reminiscent of bjork. there are some standout tracks on here such as 'absent minded friends', 'a drop in the ocean' (which is too short); while some tracks like 'somebody somewhere' are catchy (but the male vocals are amazingly irritating) - hopefully moloko's next album will contain some elements of the weirdness of 'doctor' combined with the great singing on this release..<br />still great to listen to, but not in the same way as 'i am not a doctor' where one could listen to the bizarre lyrics and sometimes quietly laugh at their ridiculousness but marvel at roisin's fantastic vocal delivery ('deflate your ego...') and the dancy, bassy tracks which were perfect for listening to in the car (and still are)...<br />get this but also try to get your hands on 'i am not a doctor' which grabs you right away.

006097625X|5.0|How better to discuss comics than through the use of comics? And who better to discuss this art form than artist/writer, Scott McCloud who is the creator of Zot!. In addition to this, he also has a website @ [...]<br />It is obvious that Mr. McCloud spent a considerable amount of time thinking about the evolution and the mechanics of comics (check out the statistics in Chapter 3, \\"Blood in the Gutter\\"). In his discussion of the development of comics, Mr. McCloud takes us through a timeline beginning with ancient civilizations and ending in the modern age. In this exploration, he also stops at Japan where a different way of creating comics developed in isolation from western influences. A broad overview of comics is given to help the reader understand and appreciate the importance of comics and its place in history.<br />The mechanics of comics are analyzed --from cartoon bubbles, to frames, to what's going on between the frames and to composition. From reading this book, there's a definite sense that there's more to comics than mere picture-making and words. Other factors and talents are needed such as pacing, which can be found in the realm of movie making,, and composition and line quality, both of which are tools of the sensitive artist.<br />Pacing and frames are devices employed in film/animation. But exclusive to comics is how it is portrayed in a 2-dimensional fashion. Time is visual and moves forward within a defined space.  With film, there are frames take up the same space, rendering the film animate. Time and mood are defined within a two dimensional space through the artistic use of layouts. Psychological factors such as closure is also discussed in the context of the use of gutters. <br />Color and lines can be found in the general world of art and have been explored, researched and discussed in depth by many fine artists. Both are expressive, conveying mood and feeling.  For those who scoff at the comic artist because they believe that (s)he is not capable of great art because they draw \\"simple pictures\\", Mr. McCloud talks about an important, but perhaps little thought of, device called \\"iconic representation\\" which plays a role in helping to render a character more universal among other things. <br />McCloud takes a complicated subject and through the use of an art form which clearly communicates these ideas, drives them home to the reader.  With all the work and history that goes behind creating comics, comics is definitely an under appreciated art form.
B00001QEE8|5.0|The Jungle book is what disney was once all about, FUN! it brings song and dance to a magical far off world with talking animals and kids who survive without TV and then brings all that flying into your living room.

B00003CXP1|5.0|Aside from being a wonderfully disturbing and visually stimulating film, which was clearly about a billion times better than any of this year's best picture nominees; Requiem for a Dream thankfully undoes everything that Trainspotting did to glamorize heroin use.  You want kids to say nope to dope, just plop your ten year old down and show em this flick....I think the part where the junkie's gangrenous arm is removed with some type of power saw will be especially effective....  All's well that ends well you know.  As for Aronofsky's next film, a fifth installment of the popular Batman films which haven't been any good since Tim Burton split two movies ago, keepthe kids away from it.  That kinda stuff could rot their brains.
0425129608|5.0|In this novel, Agatha Christie does what she does best:  assembles a group of diverse characters on holiday, has one of them murdered, and provides the rest with plenty of opportunity and motive to have committed the crime.<br />Arlena Marshall is a beautiful woman known for her affairs with men, both before and during her marriage.  While on holiday at the Jolly Roger Hotel on England's South Coast, she openly cavorts with Patrick Redfern while her husband and his wife watch helplessly.  Tragedy is inevitable and few are surprised when Arlena is murdered.<br />What sets Christie apart from other mystery writers is the wonderful skill she exhibits with characterizations.  This novel, one of her best in my opinion, is complete with many well-developed ones which make for a believable crime.  Miss Rosamund Darnley, a talented dress designer, and Mr. and Mrs. Odell Gardener, the outspoken American woman and her long-suffering husband, are just a few of the many who fill this story.  And of course, the famous detective Hercule Poirot also happens to be on holiday here at the time of the murder. Everybody is a suspect as voodoo practices, drug-smuggling, religious mania, and two murders from the past add intrigue.<br />The book was adapted to the big screen in 1982 with Peter Ustinov as Hercule Poirot, Dianna Rigg as Arlena Marshall, and Maggie Smith, Roddy McDowall, James Mason, Colin Blakely, and Jane Birkin also starring. A new made-for-tv version will air in 2001 with David Suchet as Poirot and Hugh Fraser as Arthur Hastings.

The Rock stars Sean Connery and Nicholas Cage who have to team up on Alcatraz to help stop someone unleashing a missile on the centre of America.  Sean Connery was formaly a prisoner in Alcatraz and the only one ever to escape which is why he teams up with Nicholas cage as he knows the prison inside out.

B00005AUBA|5.0|Why do people complain that a bands new cd doesn't sound like their last one? If you want something that sounds the same cd after cd,go buy some Offspring or AC-DC. Thank God we have bands like Radiohead and Mogwai,among others, who are talented enough,and brave enough to explore new territory. Do we want to live in a world full of Limp Bizkits?      Mogwai are evolving in a nice direction. A little more &quot;polished&quot; than their last release,but that isn't always a bad thing. In this case especially. They've added strings to a few songs,and also some vocals,but it doesn't make them sound commercial or mainstream at all. They still have their edginess and that beautiful,spacey sound. I like it as much as their last cd. Pure Mogwai...with the courage to play what they feel. If you like these guys,check out the new &quot;Unwound&quot; cd also.
B00000064F|5.0|There were a whole lot of demons wrapped up in the brilliant, but tormented soul of Nick Drake, who succumbed to depression and death before his full talent was allowed to flourish.  Nick Drake only left behind three complete albums, \\"Bryter Layter\\" being the middle and most beautiful one. The string arrangements are superb and with sympathetic backing from the likes of Dave Pegg, Richard Thompson, Dave Mattocks and John Cale, the songs really grab your heart.  In a year when the singer / songwriter has comeback from the Wilderness the re-issue of Drake's \\"Bryter Layter\\" could not of been better timed or more welcome.  This is the best way into his oeuvre: ornate, drenched in melody, emotion, evocative of a long-lost London and its small, smoky nightclubs.  All told, the songs run counter to his melancholic reputation, as evidenced by the very breezy and up tempo opening track, Hazey Jane II. However, in case you start getting the idea that it would all be dog biscuits you are soon brought down by \\"At The Chime Of A City Clock\\", which reminds you of who you are listening to. \\"You stay indoors, beneath the floors, and talk to neighbors only\\", sighs Drake. Pretty autobiographical then.  Nick Drake's, finger-pickin' guitar rises above all the musical arrangements to leave you breathless at his dexterity.  Although the re-mastering of the songs has given them much more definition and depth, my problem with this re-issue is in its time. Forty minutes of music is not a lot in these days of C.Ds, perhaps Island Records could have found a few more songs from Nick Drake's back catalogue to give the C.D. buying public a better deal. If your not familiar with Nick Drake, the excellent \\"Way To Blue\\" is a must buy. This clocks in at way over the hour and containing songs from all three albums, \\"Pink Moon\\", \\"Bryter Layter\\", \\"Five Leaves Left\\" and the posthumously released, \\"Time Of No Reply\\". It gives a good overview of Nick Drake's work plus a nice booklet with an introduction by `Nick Drake Devotee' Joe Boyd, some photos and complete lyrics. Not music to listen to when your low, rather relaxed and contemplative. Mott the Dog.y `Nick Drake Devotee' Joe Boyd, some photos and complete lyrics.

0061003646|4.0|Miss Marple makes her second appearance in this novel.  Her dear friends, Col. and Mrs. Bantry, have the unpleasant experience of having the body of a rather cheap-looking blonde found in their library.  The unidentified corpse does not appear to be at all the type of person the Bantrys would associate with, and tongues begin wagging in the village.  The search to identify the body involves many interesting characters:  Ruby Keene, a professional dancer who has been reported missing; Josephine Turner, her cousin; Raymond Starr, exhibition dancer and tennis pro; and Conway Jefferson, a man confined to a wheelchair as the result of an accident that killed his wife and children.  Mr. Jefferson was rumored to have been quite taken with the exotic Ruby.  Add to this mix the Bantrys next door neighbor, Basil Blake, who is a &quot;party animal&quot; and been known to consort with film stars and others of loose reputations, according to the gossip-mongers in the village.<br />The professional detectives are baffled and it is our shy and quiet Miss Marple who solves the case because of her past experiences and observations of how people act, particularly young girls.
B00004BZ0N|5.0|I must admit to being only a recent devotee of The Clash, but I must also take issue with the incessant shoehorning of the group into the &quot;punk&quot; category (especially prevalent in every news story following the death of punk pioneer Joey Ramone). While their debut LP may certainly fit this label, it should have been quickly shed by this, their third release. Like The Beatles' &quot;White Album&quot; jack-of-all-pop-trades before it, &quot;London Calling&quot; defies typecasting, offering a glimpse into The Clash's future of weaving even more musical styles into their music. Here, we get the new wave/Elvis Costello-ish &quot;Spanish Bombs&quot; (my favorite Clash song); &quot;Lost in the Supermarket,&quot; which sounds like a page from the Difford/Tilbrook Squeeze catalog; the pure power pop of &quot;Train in Vain (Stand by Me)&quot;; Marley-ish reggae (&quot;Revolution Rock&quot;); as well as good ol' under-two-minutes (1:48 to be exact) punk like &quot;Koka Kola.&quot;<br />THIS is the true sound of Radio Clash.

B000001IPL|5.0|If you love recent Offspring songs such as &quot;Original Prankster&quot; and &quot;Why Don't You Get a Job?&quot;, you will not like this CD. Or you might, and you'll discover the pop music the group makes is horrible. Let's rate the songs:<br />1. Time to Relax: funny intro, almost as good as &quot;Disclaimer&quot; from Ixnay.<br />2. Nitro (Youth Energy): good song, about today's generation of teens. nice guitar riff. 9/10<br />3. Bad Habit: starts slow, then kicks. a song about an extreme case of road rage, but pretty good. shows the pure raw power of the Offspring. 10/10<br />4. Gotta Get Away: a classic Offspring song, slower than their normal stuff, but has nice guitar riff with that Middle Eastern sound. 9/10<br />5. Genocide: cool guitar riff, lyrics are weird, but it's an overall good song. 8/10<br />6. Something to Believe In: about how there's nothing to believe in this society. guitar is okay, but lyrics are good. 8/10<br />7. Come Out and Play: the song that made Offspring famous (before Pretty Fly); awesome guitar riff, with the Middle Eastern sound. Love the &quot;gotta keep 'em separated&quot;, and good lyrics. A somewhat sarcastic look on school violence. 10/10<br />8. Self Esteem-another classic. slower, nice guitar riff. song about a [guy] with no self esteem. i love playing this song on the guitar and singing at the same time. 10/10<br />9. It'll Be A Long Time: a good song lyrically, talks about world powers fighting over lies. the guitar could use some work, though. 7/10<br />10. Killboy Powerhead: raw power chords in this song...don't really understand this song, but I like it. 9/10<br />11. What Happened to You?: a song about someone whose doped up way too many times. This song is ska punk, and a pretty good one at that. 8/10<br />12. So Alone: the album's weak point. I like the shouts, but its short and not too strong. 5/10<br />13. Not The One: a song about how we're not responsible for the problems of today, but we have to deal with it anyways. Similar to &quot;It'll Be A Long Time&quot;, where guitar is not really too good. 7/10<br />14. Smash: my favorite song. about being the outsider, not doing what all the trendies and mall rats are doing. lyrics are awesome, and raw guitar riffs are nice. sounds kinda fatalistic. this song makes me wanna play this in front of all the groupies at my school and laugh! 10/10<br />There you go. Classic punk album. If you're into their newer stuff, you might like it. If you're an old fan, you'll love it. Guaranteed.
B00003CXDG|2.0|I am a huge action fan, love most of Tom Cruise's movies, and loved the first Mission:Impossible movie.  However, this one is not on par with that movie by any stretch of the imagination.  I actually thought of giving this movie 1 star, but some of the action and visual effects were stunning, so that boosted my score.<br />The film starts out brilliantly, and the mountain scene was breathtaking.  It all goes downhill from there...  I really think John Woo is off his rocker.  In the commentary in one of the special features on the DVD, he says he wanted to direct a love story.  Good try buddy!  And the action scenes were overdone and unrealistic.  I am impressed that Cruise did most of his stunts, but some of the stuff was just stupid, like the cartwheel kick at the end.  Can you actually tell me that someone would not be able to get out of the way?  They should have just stuck with a realistic fight scene, where the blows would actually hurt in real life.  This was further worsened by the slo-mo that was used constantly.  At least at regular speed it may have looked somewhat believable.<br />Despite the problems I had with some of the action scenes, the worst part of the movie had to do with all the masks that were used.  I mean, how believable is it that Cruise kept a mask of his face, as well as a mask of each of the bad guys?  Added to that, who would believe that it was the same guy?  Remember, Cruise is short...at least three inches shorter than Dougray Scott.  Anybody would've been able to pick up on this...<br />I am just so frustrated because they really wasted what could have been a good sequel.  Do yourself a favor and buy Mission:Impossible.  Rent MI:2 only if you want to laugh at the garbage that John Woo made.
B000001FN8|4.0|Well, at first this album was a bit of a disappointment for me too, being to poppy and flurry. But then, after hearing most of the songs live at their following world tour, the songs really catched me (or better: the way they were performed on stage).<br />Live the scorps still perform very good, and songs like Don't Stop At The Top, We let it rock...You let it roll, Every Minute, Every Day and (yes!) Media Overkill stand like concrete buildings. Awesome.<br />Since then I enjoy Savage Amusement every now and then in my cd-player. Too bad however that it needed a live concert to convince...
B00005AUBA|5.0|Even though it may not be their best work to date, Mogwai's killer new CD is still very moving, very enjoyable, and strangly very accessible. Unlike their previous works which, although they were equally parts genious, took many listens to fully enjoy. One of the things which I really enjoy about this album is the middle ground they seem to have found peace with between  their two styles of music, being techno (Kicking A Dead Pig) and indie (Young Team, Come On Die Young). They also seem to have left behind many of the extreme darkness which plagued Come On Die Young and have come to what seems to be, to me at least, much more of an optimistic outlook. I can understand why many people found this album to be somewhat less than satisfactory, being the changes that it has to their overall sound. But I would point out to those people that Mogwai has never gotten stuck in a rutt, in fact they do a marvelous job of screwing their listeners ears around with every new album, (something I also really appreciate Radiohead for doing). Thier somewhat liberal use of acoustic instruments in this CD (see tracks 2,3, and 4) is very cool and adds a very smooth produced feel to this CD, making a lot less rough than some other releases. Truthfully, I find it hard to find much to flaw this CD with, except maybe I wish it were longer. They thankfully have abandoned the use of long periods of noisey trash which is everywhere on Kicking a Dead Pig, and the sometimes monotonusly boring guitar riffs on Come On Die Young. In fact this CD is quite engaging and interesting from start to finish and I can listen to the whole thing without ever slightly wanting to switch tracks because of it's steady output of good music.<br />Don't think that my shining review of this CD in any way shows that I dislike any of thier releases. In fact Come On Die Young (for all the problems I listed with it) is one of my favorite CDs and Kicking A Dead Pig is awesome background music, perfect for playing games to.Even so, Mogwai is definetly evolving and becoming more mature as a band. Buy this CD and I'm sure you won't be dissappointed.<br />-Ethan Lewis
B00000JBFW|5.0|This album is worth 10 stars.Unfortunately I can only give 5 stars.I agree with &quot;polaris&quot; , how could any Deep Purple fan  cannot like this album.Just listen to Wasted Sunsets and you will know why Ritchie Blackmore is still considered to be one the best heavy metal guitarists . This is a brilliant album.  Its a very matured album and one can easily see that a lot of effort has been put into this, especially considering the fact this is a reunion act.Deep Purple is still my favourite group ever.Highly Recommended for anyone who likes Highway Star or Smoke On The Water.
0553106635|3.0|The first book in the series was reviting and kept me up late in a mad dash to finish before the end of the weekend.  The second book was highly interesting, but not quite a good as the first.  This third installment is the weakest of the three, and if the next 3 books in the series continue this decline, then I don't think I'll read them.  <br />This is unfortunate because the first book was spell bounding:  the prose was excellent (and it's still good in the next two books), the characters were well developed, the plot was rich, but mostly it was DIFFERENT.  This fresh approach to fantasy writing was invigorating and I fell in love with it.<br />However, in the second book, I found myself successfully anticipating the author. The story began to meander, and characters began doing things that were, well, out of character.  The third book had confirmed my misgivings of this series' direction.  I'm afraid that Mr. Martin, despite considerable skills, is human after all.  I don't think he has the ability to sustain the quality of writing through a reported 6 books (900 pages each?).  I can see him sitting at his desk, thinking furiously on how to top the previous book:  what shocker can he pull out of the hat?  His only answer is to increase the body count, much like a 2nd rate slasher movie.  It's a tired formula:  since he shocked everyone by killing a main character in the first novel, therefore everybody will be twiced as shocked if he kills off twice as many main characters in the next novels.  If we continue the formula and double up on the slaughter, then by the sixth book he would have killed off 32 main characters.<br />I apologize if I sound bitter, but the first novel held such promise that I really wanted the whole series to suceed.  Its a shame that the publishers talked him into extending the series to 6 books, I really think it would be much better and tighter if he had kept it to three or four.
B00003CXN3|2.0|The people who have given this film three stars or less have said pretty much everything I'd want to say (&quot;safe,&quot; &quot;condescending,&quot; &quot;mediocre,&quot; etc.) -- I'd just like to add that there's something REALLY self-important about the way the U.S. consume &quot;issue movies.&quot; This was the dominant feeling I was left with, coming out of the theatre -- if something has flickered in the front pages of American newspapers long enough to leave some sort of vague impression in the brains of the masses, they'll love having it all laid out for them, thought out for them, and put in a self-flattering perspective in a movie -- which is all TRAFFIC does, re: the war on drugs. It's a pretty movie at times -- I actually liked the yellow tinting of the images of Tijuana, just because it was interesting to look at -- and the interlacing of plots won't be that much of a problem to any reasonably intelligent viewers, but there's still no reason to see this. Though hey, yeah, Benicio del Toro is shaping up to be one of the finest actors in the business. Fans of his MIGHT find the film redeemed by his presence somewhat. Still, I'd suggest not wasting your time.

B00005B6C9|5.0|What a pleasure to open up a CD from a fave group from the 60's (how few there are left!) and hear something completely &quot;now&quot;.  The BeeGees take the best of the 60's and the best of today and manage to do it without it being a rehash.  Touches of the Beatles, The Hollies, ABBA, even a hint of The Association, but always BeeGees.  It's refreshing to hear the recurring theme of loyalty, stability and unabashed romanticism from guys without being sappy, all done in wonderful melodies, harmonies in a mix of everything from punchy rock 'n roll to slow ballads.  Bravo!

B000051S44|4.0|This is the best movie ever made for auto racing fans--the un-Driven.  (The best movie ever made that includes auto racing is A Man and a Woman.)      The cars are spectacular on the track (remember when cars had more power than grip?).  For non-fans, the sketchy backstories of the characters probably are barely adequate.  It's taken several viewings for me to even develop theories about the relationship between McQueen's character and The Woman--he reminds me of David Bowman in \\"2001,\\" and The Woman just seems to *be there* (however, I can name several women in the racing community who parallel her story).  The characters are so stoic, it's hard to imagine that they are sufficiently excited about auto racing to justify the risks.      A feature of Le Mans (the event) that really helps this movie is that the race has driver changes, which allows the characters to interact and reflect during the event.    If the end seems Hollywood-improbable, it isn't--it incorporates elements of the 1969 race, the year before the fictional race of the movie.      One question:  why does \\"Larry Wilson\\" sound Austrian?
B00004THAY|4.0|Hey, this album was a great idea, even at this relatively late stage of the game.  Eric and B.B. - two of the all-time greats, with styles that could easily complement each other.  So why don't I feel more excited after listening to this?<br />Hey with 2 guitar greats, why add two and three other guitarists? Why not just add some appropriate keys (and maybe horns!!) and let these guys build the arrangements from the ground up?  As it is, it almost sounds like these guys came in and overdubbed their guitar and voice after the basic tracks were laid down.  Hell, they are both great rhythm as well as lead guitarists.  <br />So, I say more organic, less produced.<br />Sometimes, less is more.

0788821075|5.0|Pretty Movie<br /> The 80's was quite an era for movies with The Breakfast Club, Sixteen Candles, Back to the Future, Ghostbusters, Goonies.  However there is one movie which stands out in my mind, Pretty Woman.  The audience quickly falls in love with the uplifting, inspiring fairytale brought to life.  Julia Roberts and Richard Greer give memorable performances Roberts portraying a lost prostitute doing whatever it takes to make ends meet when she falls upon Richard Greer, a rich successful business man, in trouble on the wrong side of town.  These two meet by accident but fall in love by chance making for a moving, romantic film with an incredible message and talented actors.  Due to its storyline and message as well as the talented actors that help bring the screen to life Pretty Woman is the best movie of the eighties.   Pretty Woman is a perfect example that dreams do come true and bad times will only get better.  Vivian, played by Julia Roberts, is stuck on the bad side of town selling her body in order to survive.  At heart she is not the slutty, no body prostitute type and all it takes is a little fate to save her from the streets of Los Angeles.  Edward, played by Richard Greer, comes roaring through town in an expensive sports car obviously catching the attention of the girls on the corner.  Vivian approaches him not knowing this man will change her life.  Edward saves Vivian from the streets and Vivian saves Edward from his workaholic, heartless ways.  These complete opposites end up falling in love and making the other person better than ever.  Vivian reminds Edward to live life and see beyond work. Edward gives Vivian a chance to be more than a sex toy giving her confidence and the push she needs to straighten out and become the woman which lies within.  This movie illustrates the thought that people come in our lives for a reason.  Love does conquer all and the dreams of a fairytale romance can come true.  As the fairytales always go the poor, hopeless, unpromising girl can become the princess when her prince charming sees beyond the exterior and into her soul.     A good story line can only be effective when talented actors bring the feelings and emotions to life.  Julia Roberts and Richard Greer do just that with their incredible on screen chemistry and ability to become the characters they are portraying.  The spark between Roberts and Greer is present from the first moment their characters meet.  Their body language creates the mood of attraction and desire.  The audience becomes engulfed in the characters growing love for each other and the way each compliments the personality of the other.  Opposites can attract; Greer's rigid and stressed working character is perfect for Vivian's carefree, unorganized demeanor.  With out the talent of these two actors the chemistry between the characters would not have been as effective and apparent.  The way each of actors become the character they are portraying makes the film even more memorable and close to the hearts of it's audience.  Greer and Roberts made the movie!  A good storyline? ... CHECK ... Good actors to play the roles effectively? ... CHECK, proving Pretty Woman is the best flick of the eighties and it have proven it's self over and over again as each generation falls in love with the film.  The brought to life fairytale of Pretty Woman is hard not to fall in love with, the movie gives people hope and a warm feeling about love and romance.  The on screen chemistry makes each look and touch seem filled with real life meaning and love.  Roberts and Greer are perfect to work together and their talents have been seen again in later movies such as Run Away Bride.  Pretty Woman is a movie I cannot get enough of, it will continue to be viewed for years to come.<br />Pretty Woman directed by Garry Marshall. written by J
B000056K04|4.0|I've read all the press, and I willfully admit that I wasn't that familiar with DMB before I changed radio stations and heard his music recently. When I first heard &quot;I Did It&quot;, I though it was Steve Tyler from Aerosmith! I didn't hear who was playing it for a while, but I like Aerosmith so I finally found out it was Dave Matthews - surprise!...I guess this is what the purists are complaining about.  I also thought that &quot;Mother Father&quot; sounded like it was being performed by Seal....Wow- what a diverse range of music! I think it's because of the album's diversity that I was drawn to it, and am subsequently enjoying it. Try not to be too hard on DMB - they are enjoying a little jag from the norm..and the rest of you should try to enjoy it also. As Sheryl Crow says, &quot;The change will do you good&quot;. Keep smiling!
B000002KO1|5.0|What are the greatest debut albums in the punk / new wave genre? Well, Pretenders ranks right up there with &quot;The Clash&quot; and Elvis Costello's &quot;My Aim Is True.&quot; Why? Simply put, Chrissie Hynde has balls!! That may be an odd way to describe a woman, but one spin through this album and you will agree. From the opening track &quot;Precious,&quot; where Chrissie worries about being pregnant to the backdrop of killer crunching guitar, spitting out her disgust for whatever gets in her way, through the beauty and tenderness of &quot;Kid&quot; (a perfect pop song if there ever was one) to the classic cover of &quot;Stop Your Sobbing&quot;  - this album just never lets up.  Chrissie snarls and sneers with the best of them, but somehow never loses her sense of melody. James Honeyman-Scott's guitar is groundbreaking, and Martin Chambers pounds along like there is no tommorrow.  They put out lots of great stuff after this one, but after a debut like this, it's just impossible to go anywhere but downhill. It's a true masterpiece that has inspired so many others, and a bonafide five star album.
6303022901|4.0|I was especially impressed with the way Ying Ying's story was shown and woven into that of her daughter. I didn't pay attention to the opening credits for \\"Joy Luck Club\\" and didn't realize at first who was playing Ying Ying as an elderly lady -- only that she was beautiful. Her deep rich voice finally told me that this was the French-Chinese actress France Nuyen. The infinite sorrow she conveyed in telling her own story, and then telling herself what she wanted for her daughter, really did move me to tears. <br />The whole cast is fantastic and the cinematography is exquisite.<br />My only qualm about this film is that it is so female-oriented that all the men come off as ineffectual or disgusting. (I felt this about the Anglos as well as the Asians portrayed.) I was pleased, however, that Oliver Stone managed to keep to the story and not make it An Oliver Stone Movie.
B00005B3Z6|5.0|I love this show, but in a homosexual way!!! (Rudy from Survivor I wouldn't like this show)<br />This show opens people's eyes to the world of queer sex.  It's about time.  Every college kid should watch this show.  You know, there weren't shows like this when I was in college.  Homosexuals were discriminated against back then.  So I had to stay in the closet and play with my computer and my Sony stereo all the time.  <br />Watch this DVD.  You won't regret it!
B000000OUJ|5.0|Picture blood baths in elevator shafts! thats all i need to hear from this man, the man is a lyrical genius and the most intelligent lyricist in the WU, i love this album nearly as much as ironman just for the lyrics alone, every single track is dope but to be honest i was never really feeling the beat to 4th chamber, a bit two scratchy for my liking but hey this album is a gem. i appreciate good beats and strong lyrics and here you get both. the only tiny problem is that gza's stuff is nearly always has a guest mc, i dont mind that but sometimes you just wanna hear gza do his thing dolo more often
B000002NJS|5.0|In 1999, Ray of Light won a Grammy for BEST POP ALBUM, but to call this album simply pop is like calling The Beatles simply a band. Ray of Light follows the tradition of great albums like Sgt. Pepper or The Dark Side of the Moon in creating an experience. The tracks can be heard separately or as a whole, and each time you'll feel something different.<br />Ray of Light features some of Madonna's best writing, with themes that transcend any simple 3-minute pop song. Everything from dealing with the past, to unrequited love, to faith in a child is touched upon. Madonna's performance, in tandem with the accompanying music, immerses you in these universal themes.<br />With obvious eastern influences, the entire album feels very spiritual. The album, with meditation chants, and even a few Sanskrit prayers thrown in, feels primal and enlightening.<br />It's easy to pass Ray of Light off as an album with a lot of electronics in it, but upon repeated listening, you discover something new each time you hear it. To be sure, Ray of Light will be heralded as one of pop music's most influential albums in the near future. <br />Madonna's certainly hit her finest chapter with Ray of Light.
B00000K0T8|5.0|what can i say about this album that has not already been said a true classic, personally my favourite WU solo album, from ghosts smooth lyrics to Rza dark but yet soulful beats this a master piece. even cappas flow on this is dope,(ghost is obviously a perfectionist he would never tolerate no whack on his hit!) rae also delivers dope rhymes as usual. cuban link is more of a complete album some may say, but there is nothing like having this album play load in your car in the summer time. TOTAL CLASSIC
6305079900|1.0|.. Lock up your wallets!  [Rumor has it that] MGM (they just released a special editon of this movie in the UK) ...says they are set to re-release a special editon version in America tentatively for this August (not sure of the day yet).  The version being released in the states will actually have MORE than the UK version, plus a possibility is planned to release a limited edition 3 disc set of only 30,000 copies in North America!  WOO HOO!  Save your money folks, don't buy, it's not worth it and with a movie like The Terminator, you know that isn't going to be on OOP lists for long.  Cheers!
B00004ZB9D|5.0|I LOVE this CD, I popped it in my CD player in the car and haven't taken it out except to bring it in the house to play it on the computer while I surf the web.  So imagine my SHOCK when the person who reviewed the CD on the review that pops up on windows media player said a &quot;greatest hits&quot; CD was premature for Lenny?  Please considering Lenny has had only about 5 CDs he's got quite a few good songs, and I don't care what ANYONE says I like &quot;Mr Cab Driver&quot;, But I guess you would have to be from the NYC areas to understand the true meaning of the song.  And there are my Fav Lenny songs &quot;are You gonna Go My Way&quot; and &quot;Fly Away&quot;.  All in all one of my top 10 CDs in my collection
B00004XONN|5.0|Listen, I like the Aphex Twin, I really do. He's a very original artist. However, that doesn't mean that he or any of the other artists that techno-underground hipsters like to site in criticising this record have anything on Radiohead. Unlike Most people, I liked the Bends better than Ok Computer, and I probably like Kid A more than I like The Bends. Kid A reveals a depth and maturity in the crafting of a pop record that few artists can hold a candle to.  It is a mistake to compare this record to the like of The Aphex Twin. As creative as he is, his musical paradigm, along with that of most &quot;techno&quot; artists, is too limited and it is the sad result that for the most part they fall short of the emotional clarity and impact that radiohead has with this record.  I know people will disagree with me on this, and that's fine, but Kid A is not a techno album. It draws on electronic music as a source for inspiration, but from that point it rises above the simplistic disco roots of The Aphex Twin or DJ Shadow. Drawing from free jazz, blues, early electronic music a la Varese, rock, folk, and post-punk, Radiohead creates a gestalt musical entity that is not easily classified, particularly not by people who are more concerned with the number of artists they listen to that most people haven't heard of than they are with the quality, depth, and originality of music. Bottom Line, Radiohead is brilliant, and Kid A is an album unlike anyother. It radiates feeling and has real weight. From the first second to the last, the album never fails to communicate to the listener the bands intent in a very subtle and equally precise manner. When it soars, it carries you along with it, and when it curls up in the fetal position and bleeds on the floor, you feel the same way. Do yourself a favor and ignore the bad reviews, in 20 years this will be seen as a musical milestone on par with Abbey Road, Kinda Blue, Electric Lady Land, or London Calling. It's that good.
B00003CXRM|5.0|What boggles the mind when reading the first page of reviews is that not a single person has mentioned that the entire movie is based off of an intellectual staple in the literaty world, Homer's Odyssey.  Sure it was a great portraite of the American south during the depression, but the cleverness of weaving such an intelectuals story into an accurate historcal comedy/drama is astounding.  This was a plot of pure wit, and each scene had its equil in the epic peom.  See or buy this movie if you are one who enjoys the pleasures of the intelectual pursuit.  Buy this movie if you are one who wants a good laugh, but appriciate for what it is!
B00003W8NM|5.0|First of all, I'd like to say that I wish more DVD's were like this. The commentary tracks are all great, the sound is great, the video transfer is beautiful, and the extras are great. The packaging is even cool. I hope that more DVD producers are paying attention to the accolades the fight club package is getting so that we will see more of it's quality in the future.<br />As for the film itself, it is certainly one of my favorites. I'd even disagree with the earlier reviewer who called A Clockwork Orange a better movie. While the Kubrick movie is brilliant in and of itself, the story is not of the same quality as Fight Club. Which is understandable, as I feel Chuck Palahniuk is a superior author to Anthony Burgess. The Fight Club story works on so many levels that you get a bit delerious at times.  People seem to want to attach messages to the film, &quot;It's Anti-Consumerist&quot; &quot;It's a send up of the men's movement&quot; &quot;It's A satire of the Support Group culture&quot; &quot;It's anti capitalist&quot;. All of these things are true, and none of them are. Most of those aspects of the film are mere invitations to look more closely. When you do, and after you have peeled back the layers after a few repeat viewings (repeat viewings are essential to gain full enjoyment from this one, you don't just want to watch it again, you have to. It's another thing that makes it a great buy.) yoiu begin to see what the movie is actually about. I'm not going to spoil it for anyone, as the process of discovery was the most enjoyable aspect of the film for me, but do please watch this one a few times with no preconceived notions, and I'm sure you'll see what I mean.

B00005AXEL|5.0|I regularly check a Fleetwood Mac fan website which keeps up with the band members' solo efforts.  Since &quot;The Dance,&quot; I had been hearing off and on that Stevie would be crafting a new album.  After four years of waiting, I had almost given up.  And then 2 months ago I happened to drop by that website after having been absent from it for a while and there was a new link titled &quot;Trouble in Shangri-La.&quot;  My heart jumped at the thought of what this could behold and sure enough, the long-awaited album with Sheryl Crow (whom I also adore) was coming very soon.  May 1 came and went and, on a trip to my local mall, I decided to scout for the CD.  I found one copy in the entire 200+ store mall, and of course i grabbed it.  The big question for me was: Was it worth the wait?<br />Upon hearing the title track I knew the answer was a resounding YES!!!!!!  Stevie's voice and songwriting talent remain unsurpassed.  This is one of very few CDs which comes anywhere close to the musical power of Fleetwood Mac's classics, but as with all things Stevie has done, it is entirely her own.  I particularly enjoyed the aforementioned title track as well as the romantic &quot;Every Day&quot; and thouroughly enjoyed &quot;Bombay Sapphires&quot; (although I'm not a Macy Gray fan) and the very very catchy &quot;Too Far From Texas&quot; with Natalie Maines.  Even my father liked that one, and we have diametrically opposed musical tastes!<br />All in all, &quot;Trouble in Shangri-La&quot; was well worth the long wait.  I only hope that I get to catch Stevie on tour sometime after September in or near Charleston, SC (hint, hint) so that I may enjoy these songs and her classics live.
0143117130|3.0|After finally finishing this book, my response is \\"what's the big deal?\\". Why have so many people come to admire the character of Bridget Jones and why is this book so popular? I honestly don't know. There isn't anything original about the book whatsoever. The paperthin plot is taken directly from Jane Austen; most of Bridget's \\"struggles\\" are nothing new; and the book contains no moral or message of any sort. This isn't a book that can help you change your life. Nevertheless, it does have it's moments (British wit: you either hate it, love it, or don't have a clue), but overall most of the humour gets lost in the blandness of Bridget's \\"struggles\\". Overall, other than a few humorous moments that made me laugh, my reaction to the book was one of pity. I pity the character of Bridget Jones and all the poor people who read this book and live like her; just existing in life but never truly living. It's sad that so many see the character of Bridget as heroic when in reality she's just a coward decorated to be a pretty model of \\"how life is.\\" Oh well. Once again another book with a lot of hype, but no substance.
B00004RHZU|5.0|I had bought this CD as a whim. I really wasn't looking for it, but one day in the CD store, it just kinda popped out at me.<br />  When I got home, I immediately began listening to it, although not very carefully. I had already dismissed it in my mind as a Britney wannabe with a little more attitude. <br />  Some people might argue that that last statement is true. She wants to be a popstar, they might think, and now that she's got a CD out, it'll go to Pink's little head. And who calls themselves Pink, anyway???<br />  Pink does. And through listening her songs, whether it be My Split Personality, or Hell Wit Ya, you realize she's expressing herself, not who people want her to be. You definetly CAN take this one home!

The dragon who \\"helped\\" Mulan was played by Eddie Murphy's voice.  He is hilarious, kind of makes you want to hug him tight.
B00000IAU3|5.0|Although Dido claims she's not, she truly is a first-class angel.    All of the songs are very well thought-out, and the lyrics are wonderful. I'll just do a quick run-down of some of my favorite songs.<br />  Here With Me- One of the better songs on the album, but to me, it sounds a lot like Thank You, her debut song.   Hunter- A great song about going your own way.   Don't Think of Me- This song is one of those I'm kinda mad so I'm going to write a song about it. The lyrics bring up some interesting points, though.   My Lover's Gone- A very comforting song. Dido's voice is wonderful.   Thank You- A song that really hits home with me, and shows that you can always concentrate on the good things in your life to bring your mood up.   Don't Slide- Keep your head up, and you'll do fine. I think that's the main message of the song.   Isobel- I LOVE THIS SONG! It's a kind of freaky, kind of sad story about the a girl named Isobel. You really have to listen to the lyrics.<br />  There are so many great songs on this album, and those are just a few. For a debut cd, NO ANGEL is really awesome. Dido trully is an angel.
6305308659|3.0|&quot;Pleasantville&quot; is, superficially, about teenage fraternal twins who get sucked into a television set and into the world of the male twin's (Tobey Maguire of &quot;Cider House Rules&quot;) favorite 1950s  black-and-white TV show--a composite of many &quot;classic&quot; shows of the era.  Mom is the perfect housewife, Dad is clueless about anything other than going to work and being fed when he gets home, and the other characters are cardboard cutouts unaware of their own interests and desires.<br />Slowly but surely, the twins begin to subversively turn these characters on to these interests and desires--and in doing so, the characters come into color.  Particularly interesting is Jeff Daniels' character, the owner of the malt shop, who discovers his love for art and painting.<br />The movie takes a drastic turn in tone about halfway through, becoming a tract on racism and turning those who are different into the &quot;other&quot;.  Since the film is set in the late '50s, this is nice foreshadowing of how the counterculture would be viewed with suspicion in the '60s.<br />Fine acting all the way around, from Maguire and Reese Witherspoon (&quot;Election&quot;) as the teens, Daniels, and the brilliant Joan Allen and William H. Macy as the parents.<br />Uneven in tone, but a fascinating piece of work.  Not only is the film entertaining on a superficial level, but it is especially rewarding for those who follow the advice of the &quot;American Beauty&quot; tagline and take a closer look.
6304609825|5.0|Disney's &quot;Sleeping Beauty&quot; is one of the most macabre and dark pictures ever. The tale of good versus evil is magically brought to life through an astonishing visual display of elite and sinister animation, combined with our heroes and villians, and a well-rendered musical score that is taken from the very music of Tchaikovsky. There is no doubt about it: this is a meticulous and excellently crafted motion picture which remains one of Disney's most ambitious and intriguing. <br />The story remains the same: the princess Aurora is born into King Stephen's royal court, the pride and joy of all the kingdom, where celebrations and gifts are bestowed upon the small child. Tragedy strikes when the lone misfit of the kingdom, the evil and crafty Malificent, rains on their parade to place a curse on the child: &quot;Before the sun sets on her 16th birthday, she shall prick her finger on a spindle of a spinning wheel, and die!&quot; The kingdom is in peril with this news, and so the three fairies, Flora, Fauna and Merriweather conceal the child deep within the forest in a hidden cottage, raising the child under the assumption that she is of no royal relation. <br />But what Disney movie would be complete without the obligatory second act of villainous treachery and heroes saving the day? This movie follows that same pattern, but in such an intense way that outweighs some of the live-action suspense we get from mainstream films. Malificent's curse comes true, and so it is up to Prince Phillip, whose love interest in the young princess drives him on his journey to seek out and rescue the maiden while defeating the creepy witch. <br />Everything in this movie screams the word &quot;medieval,&quot; from the animation of the elaborate castles to the creation of the forests and acts of mysticism and nature which accompany them. Attention to detail is great, focusing on such things as woven tapestries decorating the walls and ceilings of the castles, while the clothing worn by the characters dances between the elite society and the middle-class quite nicely. Other important settings in the movie, such as Malificent's castle, are given a gloomy, ominous look, dark and stormy, full of rotting and decay. <br />This is also a classic evil-against-good story as well, attributing its successful execution to thr dazzling displays of magical powers as well as swarthy swordfights. Prince Phillip's treck through the forest of thorns still brings a certain amount of heightened suspense to an audience, while Malificent's character brings unease and restlessness to viewers. She is the embodiment of true evil, which is easy to see, while Prince Phillip is everything we want in a hero: dashing, morally just, and committed to his one true love. <br />Comical relief is provided stupendously within the efforts of the three fairies, whose arguments amongst one another are hilarious and laugh-out-loud funny. Flora takes on the serious role, the one with the level head who makes sure that everything goes according to her plan. Fauna is douty and bird-brained, yet sweet-natured and high-spirited. Merriweather is the rebel, and her machinations in rebellion of Flora's perfect plans bring some funny moments, especially in a battle of the wills at the small cottage as they prepare for Aurora's birthday. <br />The musical score plays throughout almost the entire film, unlike certain Disney films which have breaks in the score. The musical numbers sung by Aurora and Prince Phillip sell us on their love for one another, while the dark and brooding music of Malificent's power and evil fit the scenes perfectly. There are times when the music is frightening, and times when it brings cheer and delight to us. <br />&quot;Sleeping Beauty&quot; remains one of my favorite movies, maintaining all the classical elements of the original work while giving it a wondrous and invigorating look. The visual style is comething to be admired and adored, while the story and the characters are crafted with heart and wit. This is Disney's darkest yet most complex piece, perhaps ever.
B00005ASOC|5.0|Director Gus Van Sant also directed \\"Good Will Hunting\\" and this film has essentially the same plot.  An underprivileged youth is discovered by a reclusive genius and is shepherded to his full potential.  What GWH was to math, this film is to literature.  They are such close cousins that Van Sant felt compelled to bring in Matt Damon for a cameo.<br />Regardless of the familiar plot, \\"Finding Forrester\\" succeeds because of an excellent screenplay and outstanding acting performances by Sean Connery, Rob Brown and F. Murray Abraham.  This kind of story can't help grabbing the audience at a human level.  Genius, suppressed by societal class, struggles to emerge and it beats the odds.  The story is transcendent for both the main characters.  Forrester (Sean Connery) helps Jamal (Rob Wallace) transcend his societal constraints to realize his potential as a writer, and Jamal helps Forrester to transcend the constraints of his emotional traumas to free him as a human being.  It is a triumphant story, very uplifting.<br />Van Sant does a good job of presenting the human element and developing the characters while keeping the photography effective but in the background.  The photography is very straightforward, allowing the characters to tell the story without the intrusive use of stylish shots that are all to prevalent lately.  Van Sant gives Forrester's apartment a dark and dreary look from a color and lighting perspective, which is particularly effective.<br />Sean Connery is in top form and continues to make the case for being one of our best and most treasured actors.  He gives a virtuoso performance in this film with a complex and ornery character.  It is a powerful and moving portrayal.  Rob Brown is phenomenal in his first feature film.  He was found in a talent search and made an impressive debut with an extremely mature performance.  With the right scripts, he has a good chance of having a bright future.  F. Murray Abraham is fantastic as the haughty English teacher, who gets his just deserts.<br />This is a highly intelligent film with a strong story, steady direction and marvelous acting.  I rated it a 9/10.  Despite an all too familiar storyline, it differentiates itself by its wide-ranging excellence.  For those who enjoy good dramatic performances and intriguing character studies, this film is not to be missed.
630451087X|5.0|I liked Lost Highway when I first saw it.  This, in spite of severe reservations (I HATED Blue Velvet).  Now, having seen it many times and read the screenplay, I am convinced it is an under-appreciated masterpiece.<br />The story:  Jazz saxophonist Fred Madison (Bill Pullman) has a vague notion that his wife Renee (Patricia Arquette) is cheating on him.  Left on his front steps are a series of odd, anonymous surveillance-style videotapes of his house.  These tapes become more and more disturbing, as they get further and further INSIDE his house.  The last one is a doozy - it shows Fred having just horribly murdered and mutilated his wife.  In a jarring series of cuts, we find that he has, somehow without his knowledge, actually committed the crime.  He is convicted and sent to Death Row.  From there, things get stranger still, defying all logic...<br />Saying that the plot is meaningless is misleading.  While plot is certainly less important to Lost Highway than the skillfully woven mood of dread, it actually does make sense.  To understand it, one must make two assumptions:<br />1) What we are seeing is not literally real, but inside the main character's mind, and<br />2) that there IS a literal reality that is being represented, albeit through the extreme distortion of a mental breakdown.<br />Watch Lost Highway and think in terms of dream symbology:  if this were a dream of a repressed trauma, what would the dream be telling us about that trauma?  Surprisingly, a coherent and fairly consistent symbolic map of the &quot;real&quot; story emerges:  in dream interpretation, the house usually represents the dreamer him-/herself.  Locked away within it are dark secrets - like the repressed memory of Fred having murdered his wife.  But his subconscious mind tries to surface those memories through the symbolic videotapes.  Get the idea?<br />There is a lot more, including Jungian dream characters representing Fred's parents, his Shadow Self, his Anima and Animus.  If you've read up on clinical psychology, it helps.  But even if you haven't, Lost Highway will still talk to you, if you let it...to your subconscious, which will have no problem understanding the plot, even if the rest of your mind remains confused.<br />Happy viewing...f you've read up on clinical psychology, it helps.   But even if you haven't, Lost Highway will still talk to you, if you let it...to your subconscious, which will have no problem understanding the plot, even if the rest of your mind remains confused.<br />Happy viewing...
B000002IZ4|5.0|I'll dare to say that &quot;Purple&quot; is STPs' first album!! Why? Well, perhaps because her you won't hear Pearl Jam or any other Seattle band, you'll hear genuine Stone Temple Pilots! They've grown musically into their own sound (and what a great sound it is!!) as you can see in &quot;Unglued&quot;, &quot;Army ants&quot;, &quot;Kitchen ware &amp; canon bars&quot; and &quot;Pretty penny&quot;, although produced once more by &quot;Grunge god&quot; Brendan O'Brien! Weilands' vocals are more confident and the lyrics are as great as the &quot;Core&quot; ones. Need to say more?
6302891272|5.0|I first saw this film as a child, and what I remember most vividly is the arrow through the neck.  Mifune stumbles this way and that, an impossible number of arrows perforating him and the wall near him.  Screaming, shambling away, he cannot escape the crescendo of doom.  The sequence is almost like the shower murder in Psycho; it just builds and builds, quick cuts, whistling arrows, terrified reactions, until -<br />Until the arrow in the neck.  Then there's this beat, this elongated pause.  Mifune isn't screaming any more. His face is frozen like the proverbial deer in the headlights.  His fate is truly sealed.  He's dead and he knows it, even if he has not actually stopped breathing, just yet.<br />So climaxes Akira Kurosawa's telling of MacBeth.  This is no spoiler - everybody knows he has to die.  That we know his fate, even while he, himself denies it, is part of the tale's enduring power.<br />Kurosawa and his team have created some inspired and genuinely chilling images and sounds:  consider the voice of the witch in the woods, which is not quite human-sounding and rumbles with basso profundo undertones.  Or the silvery clouds of fog hugging the moist, coal-black forest floor in the film's brilliant black-and-white cinematography.  Or the palpably other-worldly quality of the apparitions that drive our hero nearly to madness.  The visual compositions have an eerie precision, an expressionism not generally seen outside of the old German masters of the 20's.<br />The acting is, indeed, highly stylized - even stilted, but so is Elizabethan English and, for that matter, the very notion of the soliloquy.  We don't complain about either of those aspects of MacBeth when we see it in its original form, do we?  Perhaps other reviewers here are correct in ascribing much of the film's style to the Noh theater tradition.  I cannot say, since I have never seen it.<br />But I have seen this film, and it occupies an esteemed place in my video collection.
B000021XR5|5.0|Remember &quot;Core&quot;? Well, this is their new &quot;Core&quot;, although a little darker! It's true, there is no &quot;Plush&quot; or &quot;Crackerman&quot;, but songs like &quot;Sex &amp; violence&quot;, &quot;Down&quot; and &quot;Heaven &amp; hot roads&quot; could have been &quot;Core&quot; songs, and i can even say that &quot;Sour girl&quot; is their new &quot;Creep&quot;. I really like this album, and i can't take it of my cd player since i got it! My favourite songs are &quot;Atlanta&quot; (great, great song!), &quot;Sour girl&quot; and &quot;Down&quot; (with a fabulous heavy riff!). Listen to it, you'll want it!!
B000002C25|4.0|Why is everyone criticizing this album? In my opinion, this is muucccch better than SOTSOG. It contains memorable melodies, riffs and lyrics. Admittedly, Fade In-Out is a little slow and a bit too long but otherwise this is a fantastic album. My personal favourite is My Big Mouth which IS an attempt at hard rock and a very successful one too, almost the best on the album. D'You Know What I Mean is a very good start to the album, it's a memorable song. Magic Pie is good too but you need to be a certain mood to fully appreciate it. Stand By Me is again memorable, but a bit too long for my liking. I wont go thorugh all the rest but Don't Go Away is good, Be Here Now is extremely catchy, All Around The World is just simply AWESOME and one of the best LONGER songs that I have heard and It's Gettin Better Man is a brilliant end to the album. So, stop criticizing and learn that no matter how bland or dull, slow and boring you think Oasis music has become, they will always be the best band in the world and EVERY album will be AMAZING! Recommended for all types of music fans!

B00005AR3G|5.0|Everything works so stunningly and effectively in The Emperor's New Groove, a fantastical, brilliantly hilarious Disney film that is the best picture to come out of the studio in a long time. It has all the ingredients to become a Disney classic - cool story, star-studded voicing and all the jokes you could want out of any genre. The script puts the characters in impossible situations which bravo cleverness, and although the film relies a little too much on Pacha and Kuzco (the two main characters) falling through things to make us laugh, it works, doesn't it? Patrick Warburton does an utterly amazing voicing job with the innocent, strong, angel guided Kronk, while David Spade puts terrific effort into the character of Kuzco. Sarcastically funny and fast-paced with its wit, The Emperor's New Groove is well worth your money at the cinema. I saw it twice, and that is sure to become three times sooner than later.
B00004R99L|1.0|Not one of Disney's better animated films, this 1951 adaptation of the Lewis Carroll classic is pretty lame. The songs are one-note. The dialogue is uninspired. Do yourself a favor. Skip it and read the book. UGH!
6305807086|5.0|Being John Malkovich is not only a salute to the great actor Malkovich himself, but a tribute to comedy cinema. Never before has such a stunningly original idea even been hinted at the movies - and Charlie Kaufman scriptwriter and Spike Jonze director have dished up exactly what we want; a crude, cool and appealing fantasy that beams with brilliant character creations and stunning acting to match up. Catherine Keener is awesome, John Cusack and Cameron Diaz perfectly fill up screen space and John Malkovich is outstanding, playing many different versions of himself. But, it's mostly the script that gets the biggest ticks in this film, and that is a comment I haven't made about any movie for a very long, long time.

B000007OY0|5.0|Wow!  No words can truly describe this incredible film.  I had rated this film as the best film I had ever seen until I saw The Thin Red Line which is another overlooked film and the only film that in my mind surpasses The Shawshank Redemption.  That these two films were passed over is reason enough to stop even having the academy awards.  <br />This film explores many fundamental questions about man's human nature and our society in general.  What is the purpose of our penal system?  How do we cope with adversity?  What is the measure of a man?  What motivates us?  What is beauty?  The list goes on and on.<br />Prison life is harsh.  From the spartan living conditions to sadistic inmates to cruel guards and administrators.  But to me one of the ultimate truths that the film displays is that there is justice in the end for all although it may take a different form for each individual and circumstance.  <br />The power of persistence to overcome adversity.  The strength that we gain from each other.  The necessity to risk and challenge our own assumptions.  The choice to be miserable or positive.<br />The direction, acting, story, cinematography, and soundtrack are just phenomenal.  This to me is one of very few truly devine films of all time.<br />NOT TO BE MISSED!
B00003CXFG|4.0|Pitch Black is the story of a ship that crash-lands on a planet that is a scorching desert with three suns.  The survivors of the crash include Fry the ship's pilot (Radha Mitchell), Riddick a prisoner (Vin Diesel) and Johns (Cole Hauser) who is guarding Riddick.  While searching their surroundings the cast eventually finds some nasty aliens that live in darkness.  And it turns out an eclipse is coming also.  The story is relatively simple, however there are quite a few plot twists thrown in that keep the viewer constantly guessing.  The effects are quite impressive for a movie of such a low budget.  And Vin Diesel is one of the best anti-heroes.  Keith David also provides solid support as a Muslim Priest.<br />The cut presented on the Unrated DVD is 3 minutes longer than the rated.  There is no more violence then the R-Rated version.  It is actually more character development and a few more scenes that only serve to add to the film.  The picture on this DVD is quite impressive.  Just watch all the colors that the three suns emit when they are walking along the horizon and you will see how impressive this DVD is.  The sound is also very impressive.  Especially the DTS track, just watch the opening crash scene with it on and get ready for a full on surround workout with amazing depth and clarity.<br />The extras however are not as impressive as the sound and video transfers.  There are two audio commentaries, one with Twohy, Hauser and Diesel and another with the FX crew and Twohy.  The first commentary is more casual were as the second is a technical one.  Other than these two commentaries there is nothing of great value on the rest of the DVD.  The 20 Minute Pitch Black Rave Event is a waste of space and should be avoided.<br />This is quite a good Sci-Fi film that is much better than Supernova and most movies that came out in 2000.  The Unrated DVD presents the film with an excellent video transfer and two amazing soundtracks with limited extras.

If you like Papa Roach, you'll like some on the songs(Crawling, One Step Closer, some others), but the songs don't have as much meaning as Papa Roach's songs. If you don't like Limp bizkit, there's a good chance you won't like this. Most songs on the CD are just screaming. All the songs are set to great music, but one of the singers should just shut the hell up and let the singer from Crawling, and One Step Closer sings, because he is has a great vocal talent. A good debut, and if on the next Cd they stick to one singer, they will be great.

0393316041|4.0|Be prepared to meet Richard Feynman, learn about his drumming in a steel band, his cracking of safes, his portrait painting, and his very wise, and very humorous look at what goes into his life.  Feynman pretty much excels at everything from radio-repair to philosophy.  The book is an insight into his days as a child, at school, at MIT, at Los Alamos research center, at the nuclear research center during world war two, his non-existent social life and how he goes on to learn the tricks and become a social animal.  It's really amazing how one man can play so many roles in one life.  But one also admires that Feynman was absolutely committed to his subject with a no-nonsense attitude.
B000055Y0X|5.0|Though this film is brilliant in any form, I ordered the DVD re-release because it was listed as a &quot;widescreen&quot; version. The first DVD release (and a VHS release) had alternating standard/widescreen scenes (with Kubrick's approval). This version is all standard 1.33:1 which was disppointing for me. The extras are a real treat, and, as I said, the film is worth repeated viewings no matter what format you have. Considering its release date (1964), subject matter and its relentlessly scathing screenplay, it MUST stand as one of the most profoundly essential films of all time. A bit of trivia: This was Sellers' first Oscar nomination; Sellers' is the first for any multiple-role performance to be nominated (Lee Marvin won the following year for &quot;Cat Ballou&quot;, the first multiple-performance winner). This film, as well as Kubrick's next 3 films were nominated for Director and Screenplay (by Kubrick...2001, Clockwork Orange, Barry Lyndon.)

B000059QWJ|5.0|Since I am a bit behind the times and have not gotten a DVD player, I went and purchased the VHS copy of DT's Metropolis 2000 at a local retail store in San Antonio, Tx.This was my first time seeing the musicians of Dream Theater perform on stage, and I thought the show was fantastic! I can only imagine how great it was to see that show live.The VHS version just plays out the Scenes From A Memory album from start to finish, with some musical adlibs here and there.The one thing that stands out in the video as compared to some other live shows recorded on tape is that the cameras show you each of the players hands playing some of the key parts in each of the song.One of the more mind blowing parts in the video comes when you get to see bassist John Myung play his solo during &quot;Dance Of Eternity&quot;, and also watching keyboardist Jordan Rudess play during that song as well.I simply recommend this live show, whether you prefer the VHS or DVD, to anyone out there who loves to visually watch top notch, professional musicians playing in their best form.One more note about this concert footage....singer James LaBrie sings near flawlessly and shows off an incredible vocal range that you cannot help but marvel at.A DEFINITE must have for any DT fan.

B00005AXEL|5.0|I used to not like her because I felt I couldn't relate to her songs, with her unworldly lyrics and the sort. However, this time around the lyrics may still be a bit mystical, but in a stronger sense that transfers to music beautifully. The music of the album has a fresh-sea breeze feel and sounds very invigorating. I read somewhere she was a 3 pack a day smoker a day for years. I dont know how, for I've never heard her sound better, especially on the track Planets of the Universe. I must admit, for once not liking her, not only do I have to say I like this album, but Planets of the Universe has in a very short time become one of my favorite songs ever. It really rocks! The other women on the album serve as mere backup-you cant really hear them on most accounts and that is fine. Stevie does superior in the spotlight by herself.
0156711427|5.0|The book I chose was A Passage to India by E.M. Forster.  The book was based off of the author's own experiences in India. Forster is able to tell the tale of an attempted friendship between a an Englishman and an Indian.   The Englishman (Fielding) and the Indian (Aziz) are constantly stuck with having problems trusting one another making the friendship a very difficult one to have.  The book shows us about the interactions between different cultures and it gives us a greater understanding of human feelings and emotions.      Forster is able to tell the reader a lot about India through this book.  The novel takes place primarily in Chandrapore. The main character of the novel is Aziz.  He is a Muslim doctor and a widow.  Aziz meets Mrs. Moore, (a British woman), at at a local Islamic temple.  Mrs. Moore is visiting her son, who is the City Magistrate. They find that they have much in common.  Aziz brings Mrs. Moore to find her friend Adela.  Mrs. Moore and Adela go to a bridge party.  For Adela and Mrs. Moore, the party is a failure because only a few of the English guests behave kindly towards the Indians. One of these guests is Fielding, who suggests that Adela meet Aziz. Mrs. Moore scolds her son because he is impolite to the Indians, but Ronny feels that he is not there to be kind because there are more important things to do.  Mrs Moore is offended by this.      Aziz has tea with Fielding, Adela, Mrs. Moore and Professor Narayan Godbole. During tea they discuss the Marabar Caves.  Aziz plans a picnic at the Marabar Caves for Miss Quested and Mrs. Moore. Adela tells Ronny that she will not marry him, but he nevertheless suggests that they take a car trip to see Chandrapore. During the trip, Adela speaks to Ronny, and tells him that she was foolish to say that they should not be married.      Both Aziz and Godbole fall sick after the party at Mr. Fielding's home, so Fielding visits Aziz and they discuss the state of politics in India. Aziz shows Fielding a picture of his wife, a significant event considering his Islamic background and an important demonstration of their friendship.  Again, we see the friendship developing between Fielding and Aziz, despite the forces that are against them at the time.  They are able to develop this friendship even though there are large differences in their cultures.      Aziz plans an expedition to the Marabar Caves.  During the day when they are to leave, a friend of Aziz's, bribes Adela's servant not to go on the expedition because he is a spy for Ronny. Although Aziz, Adela and Mrs. Moore arrive to the train station on time, Fielding and Godbole miss the train.  Adela and Aziz discuss Adela's marriage, and she fears she will become narrow-minded. When they reach the caves, an echo in one of them frightens Mrs. Moore, who decides she must leave immediately. The echo terrifies her.      Aziz and Adela continue to explore the caves, and Adela realizes that she does not love Ronny. However, she does not think that this is reason enough to break off her engagement.  When the group returns to Chandrapore, Aziz is arrested for assaulting Adela.      Fielding speaks about this charge, and says that Aziz is innocent. The Collector feels that this is true because disaster always happens when the English and Indians interact socially. Fielding requests that he see Adela, but he is denied this request. Aziz hires a Hindu as his lawyer who is notoriously anti-British. Godbole leaves Chandrapore to start a high school in Central India.      The Anglo-Indians are on Adela's side and call a meeting to discuss the trial. Fielding attends, and makes the mistake of actually referring to her by name. The Collector advises all to behave cautiously.  Adela wishes to see Mrs. Moore, who kept away. Ronny tells her that Fielding wrote her a letter to her pleading Aziz's case. Adela admits to Ronny that she has made a mistake and that Aziz is innocent.  Mrs. Moore wishes to leave India, and Ronny agrees, for she is doing no one any good by remaining. Lady Mellanby, the wife of the Lieutenant-Governor, secures Mrs. Moore quick passage out of India.      Adela admits that she made a mistake about Aziz.  The judge releases Aziz.  Adela is asked why she made this charge, but she cannot answer. Adela seems to believe that she had a hallucination because she thinks she hallucinated getting a marriage proposal when there was none.      Fielding asks Aziz not to sue Adela, for it will show that he is a gentleman, but Aziz claims that he is fully anti-British now. Fielding reminds Aziz what a momentous sacrifice Adela.  Adela decides to leave India and not marry Ronny.  Fielding gains new respect for Adela.  Adela leaves India.  Aziz thinks that Fielding and Adela had an affair and the friendship between Aziz and Fielding hits a rough spot. Forster presents us with the setting of the town of Mau.  Fielding visits Mau after he gets married. Aziz believes he married Adela. Fielding married Mrs. Moore's daughter.  They resolve their dispute, but they realize that because of their different cultures they cannot remain friends and leave each other cordially.     There is a question about what happened in the Marabar caves when Adela and Aziz are together.  Forster shows that it is not really an issue because it outcomes of what did or didn't happen that are important. The trip to the caves made the emotions that the characters had even stronger.  The proceding events following the trip to the cave are direct outcomes of this trip.       This book deals with the relations between the English and the native population of India during the colonial period in which Britain ruled India. The idea of friendship between the English and Indians was radical at Forster's time.  Forster is able to show just how radical this is by presenting the reader with the reactions of both the Indians and the English to the friendship between Fielding and Aziz. He does not pretend to understand India.  He believes that it is a 'muddle', which is a theme here, just as it is in Forster's A Room with A View.  With this book, however; Forster is able to bring some aspects of India to life to give us a greater understanding of the differences in culture.
B000002URV|2.0|I was quite disappointed by this, and a bit worried by the almost uniformly-five star reviews here (which usually mean that something has gone terribly wrong). Essentially, 'Sadeness' is the standout, although the samples sound very naff nowadays. 'Principles of Lust' was also a moderate hit in the UK, but the rest of the album is basically ambient euro-pop filler, a bit like Jam &amp; Spoon but much more pompous - all this stuff about how the album is a serious meditation on religion and sexuality seems divorced from reality. The supposedly-controversial religious angle is actually quite funny, and I get the impression that a lot of people take this much more seriously than it warrants. Unless you're fan, you'll find this extremely naff, and if you're a fan you'll probably grow out of it.
B000059XWK|5.0|&quot;Harvey&quot; is a film that is incredibly funny. After all, it ranked #35 on the American Film Institute's Funniest film list. But it is quite possible that &quot;Harvey&quot; is the most underrated tearjerker of all-time. The sincerity of the James Stewart character is most definitely moisture inspiring. Nevertheless, the humor in this film allows it to stand as one of the elite comedies in this country's history. I thus recommend it highly.
B000002UR7|4.0|I agree with the previous poster who said you should buy this cd and think of it not by Radiohead, but by another band. I only bacame a fan of Radiohead 3 years after OK Computer was released, and was only about 8 in 1994, and back then only listened to my parents mixture of musicals, motowns and Eagles CDs, so I had no idea who this lot were.<br />It is TOTALLY WRONG to put this down as the 'promising debut' album that led onto Radiohead's later triumph(s). it is full of great songs, and although it isn't my favourite Radiohead Album (the Bends gets that title), I certainly don't think of it of as disappointing buy or owt. <br />This is excellent! Yes creep (I of course didn't hear it first time round) is a high point, but I also love 'Thinking About You', which is...sweet almost. And I love 'Blow Out', the way it builds up and, basically blows out.<br />And vegetable! I love the track Vegetable. Perhaps it isn't strictly the best track technically on the album, but for me it speaks VOLUMES. You can interpret Radiohead's tracks however you like, and for me, misunderstood tennager prone to moods and burst of rage, this track is ESSENTIAL. I sit and listen to everyday because it tells me to be myself and not let people stop me being myself. It just lifts me up.<br />The only kind of weird thing on this was, when I heard the song 'How Do You?' I immediately though Sex Pistols, cos that's where Thom sounds he's going. I'm still not sure what to think of that yet. But I'll keep this burning slowly. It's definately 'one of those'
0812550706|5.0|Any fan of scifi really owes it to themselves to read it.  Card's excecution of the plot is right on mark.  It's original, has a few really decent surprises, and can totally take you out of your world and put you in Ender's.  I'm hard pressed to think of an easier read and, beyond that, it has substance too.  Perfect.<br />If you like it, don't necessarily jump to the conlusion that you'd like to read the rest of the quartet though.  The storyline changes into a much more philosophical mode in the other books.  The Shadow series however is much more akin to Ender's Game, and you may like it more.
B00000K31Q|4.0|i guess you all know the story, so i'll just writemy opinion about this one. as for me, i like comedy-romance sort of movies, and this one is near perfect! it's funny. (there were parts me and my sister just lough our guts off!) and very cute, nice young acters, and a nice story. if you have my kind of taste, you'll love it!  the only flaw, but it's in all of these &quot;comedy-romance&quot; movies, is that it is too &quot;predicted&quot;, you can just guess the end! (just ruined it for you, didn't i? sorry..) so as i said before, it's a very fun, cute and wite movie to watch!
B00002Z88D|4.0|Who'd have thought that these two powerhouses would have come together to produce an album?  What a mix!!!  This album gives new life and depth to songs like Hero of The Day.  You'll love the wonderful music and vocals and then wonder why an album like this hasn't been done before now.
0156907399|4.0|I thought that this book was incredibly well written, but while i thought that it was well done, and it was certainly reflective of the time in which it was supposed to represent, I thought that it was very difficult to understand. I found myself re-reading passages over and over again, just to get the meaning that Woolf was trying to convey. I thought that the author was trying to express a stoic look at the snobbishness of the Victorian era. While Mrs. Ramsay is the guiding light in the entire book,  I thought that she was also the one that really made it difficult to understand. I also thought that Mrs. Ramsay was the one that referred to the lighthouse the most. I recognized the lighthouse as a symbol for the goals that everyone that was vacationing there had, but also for everyone that was visiting the Ramsays.  Also, reflective of the era, is the way that Mrs. Ramsay looked at love. She liked the concept of being in love, but she didnt nessacarily love who she was married to. Or rather, she did, but she chose to question it. I am still not sure what the whole deal is with the Ramsay adults.  The Ramsay children, however, are the idealistic symbols for the future--they symbolize the promise of what is possible to come for the family and the rest of the world.They thought taht the lighthouse was the answer to all of their problems--and in reality, it was the creator of most of them. And, of course, while the Ramsays were a huge part of the story, Lily Briscoe and Charles Tansley were the two characters that epitomized the entire theme of the novel. They are the abstract, just like Lily's paintings, and they are the ones that really understand the world and what is going on. They are the ones that will still survive when the society that everyone knows crumbles to the ground. All in all, I thought that this novel was well written, but I thought that Woolf could have explained things a little better.
0140186395|4.0|I love Steinbeck and was excited to read this novel.  Well, it wasn't his best.  It is a very long book and I think there were less insights in the 600+ pages than in the 90 pages of &quot;The Pearl.&quot;  The major insight can be summed up as &quot;timshel&quot; meaning thou mayest.  Mostly, the novel is about the Trask family... two brother, hmm, Caleb and Arron (?) anyway, Cain and Able.  It's also a history of sorts of the Steinbeck family.  One part I didn't like was the extreme sexism.  Both in lack of female characters but also in the main female character (Kathy) being a cold-blooded...  Sure, some women are mean..., but there are sweeping generalities about all women being teases, cold, etc etc.  The parts about the Chinese man (Lee) are very good.  Overall, I like other Steinbecks better... try Grapes of Wrath, Of Mice and Men, The Wayward Bus, or Cannery Row.  Just my opinion.
B00005ASOC|5.0|This is a movie you will want to see over and over again. It is great with Sean Connery in it. I rented it hearing it was very good. In fact after I rented it, it was so good I bought it. There are not many movies I will purchase but this is a movie you will not regret purchasing. I highly reccomend this movie to anyone.
B0000024W3|4.0|In a 1984 Rolling Stone interview, Bob Dylan described this notorious double album as &quot;crap,&quot; a deliberate attempt to alienate his more ardent fans (substitute &quot;deranged&quot; for ardent if you like) who believed Dylan should be a songwriting machine cranking out anthems for every new social movement.  Remarkably, &quot;Self-Portrait&quot; isn't crap at all. Much of it displays Dylan's often overlooked sense of humor, something that people who expected him to continue writing &quot;protest songs&quot; probably didn't consider appropriate, especially in 1970 when the world was still deep within the turmoil of the 60s.<br />&quot;Self-Portrait&quot; is a pretty wonderful collection of odds and ends, with those odds (the loony &quot;All the Tired Horses&quot; and the parody of Simon and Garfunkel on &quot;The Boxer&quot;) being the principal attraction. Elsewhere, Dylan's crooning of &quot;Blue Moon&quot; is reminiscent of Elvis Presley's classic (and definitive) Sun Records version of the song, and &quot;Let It Be Me&quot; is a straightforward and utterly listenable romantic ballad. This album is certainly not his best work, but it's an absolute must for the serious Dylan enthusiast.  This album deserves the kind of reputation that the less interesting &quot;Basement Tapes&quot; enjoys.  By the way, isn't it about time Columbia released &quot;Dylan,&quot; this album's unofficial (and unauthorized) sequel, on CD?  I happen to like that one, too.
B000009VOL|3.0|but for me....? *Yawnnnnn*<br />there are better singer/songwriters out there.
B000002UZ4|4.0|Long having loved the songs of the Boys, I picked this disc up in the mid-90's to discover that the tunes I loved sounded as great as I remembered, and songs I hadn't ever heard were pleasant surprises.    'West end Girls' was my introduction to the Boys back in the day and like most New Wave classics it never disappoints. It begins this collection like a warm memory recalled from school (high-school for me) and it's infectious melody and dancy rhythms sound as fresh as they did 15 years ago.<br />    As sublime a synth-pop classic 'Girls' is, for me song 2 is the reason I really recommend 'Discography'. 'Love comes quickly' has long been my personal favorite and after what must be 1000 listens it still gives me chills. Hard-driving dance rhythms surge along beneath haunting lyrics of unavoidable love-love that we all must submit to sooner or later. Not your average ballad. It's not often that love is portrayed as a relentless, searching force and for this fan it's always been perversely refreshing.    'Oppurtunities', 'Suburbia', and 'It's a sin' are all well crafted, multi-layered pop tunes and welcome additions to this collection but I think 'What have I done to deserve this?' stands apart as another true triumph. For me it's as catchy and terrific as a pop song can get, bar none.     Amidst other entries, all polished but varying in depth, 'Heart', 'Domino Dancing', and the sorely underappreciated 'So Hard' rise to the top for me. 'Being Boring' is cool too.     If you're even a casual fan of the band, this is a must-have collection, and hopefully you'll experience hours of synth-pop pleasure, as this fan has.
B00004YKUY|5.0|In terms of the sound it's not an evolution but the fact remains; Steve Perry is gone and things change.  Some may forget that Perry wasn't with the group for the first few albums.  <br />Arrival is a solid album and better than Trial By Fire.  Steve Augeri's voice is smoother than Perry's voice, which was rough on the last album.  There are 15 tracks and the running time is 73 minutes, 58 seconds.  &quot;Higher Place&quot; has received airplay on the rock radio formats and the second single, &quot;All The Way&quot;, is getting airplay on soft rock formats.  It might beome this album's version of &quot;When You Love a Woman&quot; in that it may become an adult contempory favorite.  Other good tracks include &quot;Livin' to Do&quot;, &quot;World Gone Wild&quot;, &quot;Live and Breathe&quot;, and &quot;Lifetime of Dreams&quot; which all range from classic Journey arena rock to more of a progressive rock sound.  Lyrics are included in the booklet.
B00004ZAV3|4.0|When I first heard this cd I was very impressed with it but after I started listening to more of the Beatles music I thought it wasn't the best. If you already have some of their music then this cd would be pretty much be a repeat to you of one or two of their songs on other records, but if your just getting into The Beatles and not sure if your really like them and don't know if you want to get more of The Fab Four's music then this would be pretty good for you.
6305922748|5.0|This is Spinal Tap is the brilliant rockumentary/mockumentary chronicling the band Spinal Tap's tour of the United States.  This was Rob Reiner's debut film,  and what a film to begin with. This is Spinal Tap remains somewhat of a cult classic,  but its hilarious characters,  awesome music,  and brilliant storyline comes to life on screen,  and everyone could enjoy this movie.  Michael McKean plays the lead singer David St.  Hubens to perfection,  while Harry Shearer plays Derek Smalls with great finesse. A young Christopher Guest plays Nigel with a quiet brilliance,  and Guest would incidentally go on to direct and star in two of his own mockumentary films,  WAITING FOR GUFFMAN and BEST IN SHOW,  which I must say,  are equally genius,  especially the recent sleeper hit BEST IN SHOW.  Also great is Tony Hendra,  as the cricket-stick wielding manager of the band. June Chadwick is strong as David's girlfriend Jeannine,  and Bruno Kirby makes a great cameo as the limo driver.  The other supporting cameos are fantastic,  coming from Fred Willard(who won a Best Supporting Actor award from the LA Critics for his role in BEST IN SHOW),  Dana Carvey,  Billy Crystal,  Fran Drescher,  Angelica Huston, and Paul Shaffer.  This utterly hilarious movie is excellently directed by Reiner,  who plays the director of the mockumentary within the film,  Marty Dibergi!  Fantastic!
0553106635|5.0|I'll be brief. When I finished this book, I stood up, clutched it to my breast, and walked around the house in a daze, trying to snap myself back to reality, trying to calm my turbulent heart, clear my shock-stunned brain. Such is the power of George R.R. Martin's literature. He doesn't just tell you a story, the story comes up to you and talks to you, slaps you mad with the earth-shattering force of its tumultuous plot, makes you grim with tears. Passages of emotional/mental discussion mix with stories of violent clashes, and with tales of sorrow, snowing with beauteous sadness throughout &quot;A Storm of Swords&quot;.<br />What more can I say which others have not yet said? Please read this book and its predecessors, and find out how human we all are, what it is to be so, and why Martin is a genius.<br />Be calm, my heart, it's a long wait till book four. I think I'd better sit down now.
0451196716|5.0|Well, that is quite a statement, but now you're reading my review.  I think Faulkner, Fitzgerald and Hemmingway both have a couple worthy of note, but all hyperbole aside, The Long Walk is a psychological thriller told remarkably well.  This is the ultimate ghost story and is a defining work of a man who has earned recognition as one of the greatest storytellers in American history.  I know, I know, I sound like another King fanatic, but truly, you can't miss this one.
B00005B6C9|5.0|&quot;This is Where I came In,&quot; reminds me alot of the early BeeGees,with no Fallsetto's from Barry,and no Disco.Its now called Electronica.Robin's &quot;Embrace&quot; has that style,and this cuts going to be burning up the dance floors this summer,but wait untill you hear &quot;She Keeps on Comming.&quot; I swear if you heard this number on the radio you would never know it was from the BeeGee's.If this record gets some air play It's going to be a Huge hit.Barry's,&quot;Loose talk Costs lives,&quot; is my favorite.It  melts inside of you ,like your dreaming,just like &quot;How Deep is your love&quot; did years ago.The CD ends with the Hardest,Fastest number I've ever heard from the Brothers,&quot;Voice in the Wilderness.&quot;There's only 1 song I don't care for out of the 12 ,&quot;Technicolor Dreams.&quot;It even sounds like Barry's off key,and can't hit the high notes on this 1920's style number,other than that,I can't wait to play this CD all Summer long.
B00003CXP1|5.0|Requiem is a great film.  There is beauty in its chaos, and horror in its truth.  This is the most brilliant, mind shatteringly beautiful film focusing not only on drugs, but also on the people that use them.  Darren Aronofsky is a brilliant director.  Buy this movie...NOW!
B00004TDRD|5.0|This is a classic thriller no doubt about it!  I still remember the first time I saw this movie. Man it was like nothing I had ever seen before!  So scary!  Of course now people look at it  and say the shark is fake but back in 1975 this was one of the scariest movies!  The casting was great and the storyline was so thrilling it made you dying to get a good look at the shark!  But movie goers had to wait until the end! Overall JAWS was and still is a great movie!  I always enjoy watching this one and every time I still get the same thrilling feeling as if I were with Schieder, Shaw and Drefeyuss on that junky little boat in the middle of the ocean waiting for the most vicious shark in the world!
B00002MZ2C|4.0|Rage Against The Machine's third album might not sound that exciting or original to you, but it is a step forward in a way.  Unlike the excellent Evil Empire, Battle of LA is less dynamic and a little more formulated sounding.  The songs have less of a range than the previous album and seem to all be cut from the same cloth.  But the focus of this album seems to be about creating more intricate, mesmerizing sound textures as vital parts of the song.  This album is less tight and less explosive then Evil Empire, but utilizes the bands extreme musicanship better.  Songs like Mic Check and Ashes in the Fall seem to written around thier ability to make the most extremly inovative sound.  The guitar riffs and hooks aren't as good as past Rage efforts, but the band totally makes up with the new sounds coming at you.  While this album dosen't hit as hard, or came at you from as many different angles as the first two albums, the band's  creativity as just as extreme.  Definitely buy this cd if you already have the first two.  It rocks!
B000009F3Z|5.0|Well this was the first DT album I heard and upon initial listen I was a little tempted to return it to the store. It is complex in a rather unconventional manner, as the songs can change unexpectedly and and make the music have a sort of roughness to them that keeps the songs from giving off a smooth listen. Yet after a second listen I began to get into this album much more enthusiastically. Though the riffing is largely based on tremelo picking, if you are keen you will be able to keep the songs from blurring together. Each of the songs has several riffs and melodic harmonies, arranged in a free-form type of songwriting that departs away from traditional verse-chorus structures, though there are definately hooks and other verse or chorus-type arrangments going on here. It is much more organized that the its predicessor of Skydancer, where the complexity of the songs can actually drown out the songs themselves. Pretty much every songs here is worth a listen. If you can't get into it at first try a few more times.
B000059Z8J|5.0|This film is not only the best film adaptation of a comic book hero, it is one of the best films of the 1970s.  Director Richard Donner made an epic film that is romantic, exciting, and just plain fun.  The humanity that Chris Reeve brought to Superman/Clark Kent is what makes the film work.  The DVD is wonderful.  The behind the scenes stories are interesting.  The best part is the screen tests.  How fun to watch a very young and skinny Chris Reeve audition with not only Margot Kidder, but also Stockard Channing, Anne Archer, Leslie Anne Warren and others.  The deleted scenes are good too.  Buy it and enjoy it!
B000059MEK|5.0|Even if you bought this record just for it's liquefied metal cover, you would not be disappointed.  This is truly a fantastic album in every sense of the word.  And the techniques used in the creation were just fabulous.  One of the things my friend said when he first heard me playing it was &quot;the samples sound so CLEAN!&quot;  And they do.  Every sample has been processed at incredibly high quality, there is no &quot;Lo-Fi&quot; on this record.  The entire record is permeated with funky-style samples that you swear you know but just can't seem to place.  Every song has some fantastic SOMETHING about it:<br />1.One More Time - the perfect party track! a thick thumping bassline and everybody-that's-not-a-raver's-view of the raver world lyrics -:)-, catches your attention immediately.<br />2.Aerodynamic - by far, the most significant bit on this track is the squealing pseudo-guitar solo.  It may be simple, but it sounds REALLY COOL!<br />3.Digital Love - early 80's motivational tapes samples with cheesy vocoded lyrics = something still meaningful?  To be honest, it's still fun to listen to, despite it's cheesiness.<br />4.Harder, Better Faster, Stronger - one of my favorite songs on the record. Easy to dance to, but it features one of the most incredible things I've ever heard.  To understand you have to know what a vocoder is.  A vocoder is a device that takes your voice, specifically the vibrations in your voice, and converts it to the tone of the instrument it is attached to, which is almost ALWAYS a keyboard for simplicity.  What's really neat about Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger, is that at 2:25, the vocoder is switched over to an odd device that triggers it by a guitar.  It's especially obvious at certain points, where the player is playing a really neat solo.  Truly interesting to hear.<br />5. Crescendolls - A little odd at first, but it's got the throw-your-arms-in-the-air &quot;HEY!&quot; sample going on.  A lot of fun, eh?<br />6. Nightvision - a slow, short instrumental track, but still extremely well put together. I wish it were longer with some vocals.<br />7. Superheroes - When I looked at the sample list for the record, and saw &quot;Barry Manilow - Who's Been Sleeping In My Bed?&quot; I wondered &quot;what the heck?!&quot;  But when you hear the track, and the thumping bassline and beat and &quot;love is in the air&quot; echoing over and over it really makes sense and the song is a lot of fun.<br />8. Night Life - Brings back memories of disco!  And that's always a good thing, right?<br />9. Something About Us - Listening to the beginning of the track I was expecting Barry White to start singing.  A nice slow mellow groove.<br />10. Voyager - A little distortion on the bassline kept it interesting.<br />11. Verdis Quo - After you get by the somewhat slow intro, it starts getting kind of neat, and you want to keep listening.  The layers get thicker each minute, and by the end it's a real sonic jubilee.<br />12. Short Circuit - I can't really say anything in favour of this song, neither could amazon.<br />13. Face To Face - This will HAVE to be the next one on the radio! I've already remixed this into an extended version and played it at some parties where we play a lot more old-school funk and stuff. The version on the record is about 3 and a half minutes, my version was nearly 9 minutes, and still when it ended people acted dissapointed because they were getting so into the groove. I love this song!<br />14. Too Long - when I first saw the length of the song, I thought the title was a joke!  Ten minutes?  An epic pop-techno song?  But yes, it's an incredibly well done track, and as Romanthony says in the lyrics, it's really been &quot;too long&quot; since we've heard from the Daft Punk.<br />In all, this is truly a fantastic record with a lot of vision. A combination of funk, pop, disco, and techno, this isn't techno up front, and it doesn't claim to be. In fact, it doesn't CLAIM to be anything.  Whateverit is, it's REALLY good at being it.
B00000JPH4|5.0|i saw it when i was really little and it has been one of my favorites ever since then
078401020X|4.0|This is a great movie.  The story, the acting, and the sexual connotations in this movie are all very interesting.  Once you start watching, you won't be able to stop.  (Even though I do like this movie, I do think that the DVD could have been better.  The picture quality is pretty weak!)<br />In any event, the story is very erotic.  In fact, I almost blew.......... when Sharon Stone crossed her legs!<br />Anyway, I highly recommend this movie to all adults.
B000003S5H|5.0|I wanted to hear what French pop music sounded like, and upon logging on here to amazon.com and checking out the sound samples for this one I knew I had to have it.<br />I wasn't disappointed in the least. Easily the most beautiful disc I have heard in years from a new-to-discover act since The Dream Academy, Air have a wonderous command of that special language called music that is a sheer joy to behold. <br />Spacey and psychedelic (in an innocently beautiful David Gilmour way), it's been accompanying me everywhere in my duffel and has yet to leave my sight. It's a disc for dreamers and idealists and hopeless romantics who thought that songcraft like this died in the upheaval of techno acts.<br />The lyrics are partially in French and partially in English, but since people in America tend to think that the French language is beautiful and romantic by its very sound and style (I agree on that ideal as well) it isn't surprising that my American ears find that the French lyrics only add to the disc's overall loveliness.<br />While I love the entire disc from start to finish, there is one standout instrumental which I think is the most gorgeous piece of joyful melodic poetry since The Beatles and Henry Mancini. It's called &quot;Ce Matin La&quot;, and it conjures up images in my mind of roaming meadows with my dog on a bright summer day, of visiting beautiful new cities, of seeing majestic mountain ranges and sunset-lit oceans. A piece so breathtakingly majestic it nearly brings me to tears.<br />One thing I'm definitely going to do, though: the moment I finally get to see Paris as I've always wanted, I'm bringing along this disc to keep it pumping in my ears for the trip! Somehow this one strikes me as a perfect soundtrack for one's very first visit to the famous city. That's the only thing I think could possibly make the album any better!<br />Thank you, Air... you've given us all around the world a masterpiece that deserves to live forever. I look forward to much more from you!<br />(NOTE: I also recommend checking out their CD &quot;Premiers Symptomes&quot; which is both affordable and also every bit as hypnotic.)
B000050FEN|5.0|First off i love this movie, it's simply great, nuff said. Secondly the packaging for this DVD is also great, the notebook (DVD case) is really cool and inventive. The picture and sound quality of the DVD are also very impressive.<br /> So the only negative thing i can really say is that some of the extras on this DVD aren't really that great. Some of it is cool like the commentary by Fincher and the John Doe notebook. But the thing that really got to me was the so called &quot;alternate endings&quot;. Now the only alternate ending they have on film is really not different than the original. It is simply a more rushed version that was made for screening audiences before the movie was actually released. Once the screening audiences responded well to the movie, the studio proceeded to fund a more polished up ending (w/ helicopter scenes, etc.) <br /> In my case this alternate ending was one of the main reasons i bought the DVD, and it ....wasnt what i expected.... and really let me down. After the initial disappointment i proceeded to watch the other alternate ending. Which was in storyboard form, and was radically different than the final ending that was used (although it was way cheesier and made no sense - listen to fincher's comments on it). Also, the 7 extra scenes aren't really that cool either. But i guess they weren't that bad.<br /> Overall i'm still giving this DVD 5 stars because i love the movie, and all the essentials of the DVD are great - like the picture / sound quality &amp; the packaging. The extras are just that; extra. They're nice to look at, but in this case you'll probably only watch them once or twice. But they don't take anything away from the overall package that you get, which is a great movie and DVD with SOME cool extras.
0195067142|5.0|If you're a light reader this will hold your interest. The account of Peleliu was more riveting than Okinawa to me. The descriptions of fear before hitting the Peleliu beach on the initial amphibious assault, and then later on running through a hail of bullets were great. Most thought provoking was the attitude of the enemy troops versus that of the Marines - no quarter, no surrender, and the emphasis on suicidal hand-to-hand combat by enemy infiltrators at night.
630460288X|3.0|One of the few Stallone movies I like. He's fun to watch in this one and Sandra Bullock adds her naive sweetness to it. The movie has no depth but allows some entertaining glimpses into the future. Easy entertainment!
B00003CXDV|5.0|Tim Allen is an absolutly great actor. This film is so good, he deserved an oscar! The features aren't limited. The deleted scenes tell you aload of info on the film. It is really engoyable and worth alot, that's how good it is funny and worth watching again and again! 5 out of 5 is putting it mildly: 10 out of 5 is more like it. My complements to the chef!
B00005AFVR|5.0|Bruce and the E Street Band hadn't played together since the mid-1980's, which automatically makes this a special treat. As anybody who's seen Bruce Springsteen in concert will tell you, there's no substitute for seeing the Boss live! Nevertheless, all fans of Bruce will want this package! As with the show I saw, this set opens with The River's &quot;My Love Will Not Let You Down&quot;, followed by &quot;Prove It All Night&quot; (which sounds even better than the version on Darkness...), and then &quot;Two Hearts&quot; (which concludes with &quot;It Takes Two&quot;). &quot;Atlantic City&quot; is presented plugged in, giving the song a harsher tone than on the original on Nebraska. The Boss and Co. let loose with a long set of songs: the 1st of which is the country-flavored &quot;Mansion on the Hill&quot;. Then Clarence Clemons introduces &quot;The River&quot; with a unique but melancholy sax solo. &quot;Youngstown&quot; (from the Tom Joad CD) is reinvented here, plugged in, with some fine accordian work from keyboardist Danny Federici. From there, you have the hard rockin' &quot;Murder Inc.&quot; and following that is the powerful &quot;Badlands&quot;. &quot;Out In the Street&quot; features some fine harmonies from Miami Steve Van Zandt, Patti Scialfa, Nils Lofgren, and Clarence (not to mention a killer drum coda by Max Weinberg), proving that Bruce and the E Street Band really are a team! Although not listed on the package, &quot;Born to Run&quot; is included at the end of CD1 as Max and bassist Gary Tallent rhythmically introduce the classic song and the band performs a lengthy false stop adding to the excitement of the show. Opening CD2 &quot;10th Ave. Freeze Out&quot;, although a bit lengthy, is still entertaining. After singing a few bars of &quot;Take Me to the River&quot;, the Boss becomes the Reverend Springsteen and introduces his &quot;ministry&quot; of Roy Bittan, Danny, Gary, Stevie, Nils, Patti, and last but not least, &quot;Do I have to say his name?&quot;- Clarence. 2 new songs debut on this CD- the redemptive &quot;Land of Hope and Dreams&quot; and the sinister protest &quot;American Skin (41 Shots)&quot;. &quot;Lost in the Flood&quot; features some fine piano work from Roy. &quot;Born in the USA&quot; is converted to a folky-blues protest (with just a harmonica and an acoustic guitar). Perhaps the most special treat of all (as when I saw the Boss) is the classic epic &quot;Jungleland&quot;. You can hear the audience's ecstacy as they sing &quot;Down in Jungleland&quot;. Excepting the strings, this version stays true to the original epic. Then the Band rocks out again on &quot;Ramrod&quot;. Concluding this set is the poignant &quot;If I Should Fall Behind&quot;. Although the E Street Band were not present for the studio version (off Lucky Town), Bruce shares lead vocals with Stevie, Nils, Patti, and Clarence. Live in NYC reunites one of the greatest rock and roll teams in history.
B00005IC2H|5.0|These days when I want to determine the quality of any random record store, I simply ask if they have Sigur Ros &quot;Agaetis Byrjun&quot;.  If you are driving coast-to-coast this CD is indispensible, especially through Montana and Wyoming (trust me).  You can tell these guys are from somewhere remote and beautiful by the swirling waves of guitar, oceanic orchestral changes and astral vocal sounds.  Half of the lyrics are Icelandic, the other half is a made-up language that sounds perfect.  Classifications and band references are kind of useless here, but I'm a Radiohead fan if that helps (not really similar, except in terms of overall quality).  This is the first Amazon review I've written, and I only did it because I'm compelled by the music and the wish to share it.  Just buy it-- you'll know what I'm talking about.
B0000026UV|4.0|That about sums it up. Neither participant is much good at the singing business, but at least it has some character (Chet's wry delivery of &quot;Yakety Axe&quot;), and the guitar work from both parties is wonderful. Interesting to hear a reprise of an old duet (&quot;I'll see you in my dreams&quot;), recorded by Chet and Merle Travis 20 years ago. Well recorded and pleasant easy listening - and the winner for Chet of two Grammys (&quot;Poor Boy Blues&quot; and &quot;So soft, your goodbye&quot;).
B00000DLVA|5.0|I confess, I bought The Cardigan's previous album &quot;First Band On the Moon&quot; based on the song &quot;Lovefool&quot;. I eventually discarded it aside because I thought the band was a mere novelty act. Along comes &quot;Gran Turismo&quot; with a much harder sound as opposed to the kitschy '60s pop sound on &quot;First Band On the Moon&quot;. I thoroughly enjoyed this album more because of the band's change in direction in their music. Apparently they had been listening to a lot of Garbage. The guitars on &quot;Gran Turismo&quot; is crunchier and there are elements of trip hop throughout the entire album. Unlike the band's previous efforts, all the songs are originals, no Black Sabbath cover here. &quot;Gran Turismo&quot; is definitely a highly underrated album that has been overlooked by people expecting &quot;Lovefool&quot; part two.
6305546797|5.0|The Restored Limited Edition release of Halloween is one of the best DVD releases from Anchor Bay to date!  Everyone knows the story with the movie already, so I'm just going to review the DVD presentation.<br />First off, this two-disc set looks and sounds amazing.  Halloween has been fully restored under THX's digital remastering service.  Let me tell you, there is a big difference.  Halloween looks and sounds like a movie that was put out this year!  That's how amazing this movie looks under THX.  Picture is crystal clear and the Dolby 5.1 soundtrack lets you hear Halloween like you've never heard before!  Disc one is the Theatrical Version of Halloween.  It includes a 30-minute documentary called Halloween Unmasked 2000, which is an excellent documentary featuring interviews with John Carpenter, Jamie Lee Curits, P.J. Soles, Moustapha Akkad, and more.  Also included on the disc are radio spots, a trailer, tv spots, still and poster gallery, behind the scenes gallery, and biographies. Disc 2 is the uncut TV version of Halloween.  It features 12 minutes of additional footage, and some of it is some damn cool footage of Loomis visiting Michael before his escape...very cool.<br />This is definitely one of the best DVD releases ever!  However, it happens to be OOP and hard to find.  If you ever see a copy around get it!
B000002UUX|5.0|Rust In Peace is one of the best thrash albums of all time, hands down.  It's right up there with Master of Puppets and Seasons in the Abyss.  If you don't have it yet, I feel for you.  Dave Mustaine unleashes some of his best riffs on this album, and Marty Friedman's lead guitar work is just phenomenal. Pure perfection.

B000003TA4|5.0|If you're looking for good alternative rock or grunge this is defiantly the best album you will ever find. The songs are simple and have deep meanings, if you have any other Nirvana albums and not this you are defiantly missing from your collection.  Songs like \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\", \\"Breed\\", and \\"Territorial Pissing's\\" are the kind of songs that make you want to head bang and play air guitar.  But songs like \\"Lithium\\", \\"Come as you are\\", and \\"Something In The Way\\" really show how beautiful of a songwriter the lead guitarist, Kurt Cobain, was.

0446364495|3.0|A delightfully poetic work.  A romance in the truest sense - not only the passionate stirrings of the heart, but a delicate and thoughtful romance with the beauty of nature.
B00005AUBA|5.0|Mogwai: A band that burst onto the scene back in 1997 with their superb debut LP, &quot;Young Team.&quot;  They staked their claim based on expert usage of the &quot;quiet/loud&quot; dynamic coupled with their profficiency at creating haunting ballads and downright thrashing rock-outs.  Now with their much anticipated 2001 release &quot;Rock Action,&quot; Mogwai evolve even further.  Gone are the no-holds barred petal to the metal songs such as &quot;Mogwai Fear Satan&quot; and &quot;Helicon 1&quot;.  In their place are more textured songs with greater subtlety.<br />Mogwai's finest moment yet comes in the form of &quot;2 Rights Make 1 Wrong.&quot;  The opening riff immediately gets stuck in your head and won't let you go until halfway through the song, when you've already scaled the emotional heights the song has to offer before practically starting over again with an added banjo.  &quot;Take Me Somewhere Nice&quot; is an excellent &quot;ballad&quot; much in the vein of Come On Die Young, from their 2nd LP CODY.  It uses strings to great effect and actually has (GASP) vocals!  The purest pop song is &quot;Dial:Revenge&quot; featuring vocals sung in Welsh by Gruff Rhys of Super Furry Animals fame.  <br />An element that is seen throughout this LP is the use of the acoustic guitar.  Mogwai are not known for using this, typically opting for a clean sound before turning on the crunch.  However, on this CD acoustic guitars pop up all over the place, showing a little more range from the boys.  In all, an excellent CD with some terrific tunes.  It most closely compares to the &quot;Stanley Kubrick EP&quot; as it is generally a calmer, more hushed version of CODY.  The only disappointment is &quot;Robot Chant,&quot; which is simply sampled feedback for around 2 minutes.  Other than that, Mogwai have taken another step foward.
B000002BUY|5.0|Incubus is one of the best bands to come out of the late 90's rap metal explosion. They are also one of the only good ones. Unlike the other bands from the movement Incubus actually has talent. They are all great musicians and songwriters. Their sound is something beyond classification, I would best describe it as equal parts funk, metal, and rap recorded in space, I know crazy right? you just have to check it out. Every band has a masterpiece album, even if all their albums are great there's always one that's the best. As of now S.C.I.E.N.C.E. is definately Incubus' masterpiece. The album kicks off with Redifine, this is a perfect way to start off the album. It sounds like the Red Hot Chili Peppers meet Alice in Chains, funky yet heavy. There is also a great part in the middle of the song with bassist Dirk Lance and drummer Jose Pasillas II each displaying their talents on their respective instruments. Vitamin is the first song on the album with the spacey sound of guitarist Mike Einziger, he is one of the best new guitar players around, and his talent is evident all over the album. New Skin is probably the most well known song on the album, it's best described as tribal funk metal, singer Brandon Boyd is excellent on this song. Idiot Box is a very hip hop influenced metal song. The most dominant instruments on this song are turntables courtesy of DJ Lyfe and the great bass playing of Dirk Lance. Glass is another great funky bass dominated metal song, there's some crazy sounds on this song. Magic Medicine is an instrumental with a voice over track playing throughout, DJ Lyfe is great on this track, no doubt about it he's one of the best dj's around, comparable with the Beastie Boys' Mixmaster Mike. My personal favorite song on the album is A Certain Shade of Green, this is also one of the most metal songs on the album, great bass playing, great heavy guitar part, and Brandon is great. Favorite Things is another amazing song, it is also very catchy. The next song Summer Romance (Anti Gravity Love Song) is another one of my favorite Incubus songs. This is also the most unusual song. Just look at the title, the song sounds like it was recorded in space, it's also very melodic. Definately a great song. Nebula is a good song, but probably my least favorite on the album. Deep Inside is a very funky song, it's really good too. The album closes with Calgone. This is a really cool song, it starts off very slow with a bass part ripped from Rime of the Ancient Mariner by Iron Maiden, there is also some cool sounds and melodic singing. Then a very distorted sounding bass comes in and turns the song into a straight forward metal song. S.C.I.E.N.C.E. is a great album, don't let what the critics categorize Incubus as scare you. Their music is beyond categorization you just have to check it out for yourself. I suggest that anyone get this album, even if you were dissappointed with the album after S.C.I.E.N.C.E., Make Yourself, give this album a try, it's amazing.
B00004SCX6|3.0|I can't seem to understand why Britney Spears has attacked the Billboard charts with her singles and her not so professional voice. Yes, the music is good but minus one star for the vocals. If she gets more years of training by a REAL professional vocal coach, the next album could be a better success than all of her albums combined. Minus another star for lyrics. If Britney wants to be an artist, she's going to have to write her own songs because she is only classified as a singer not an artist. Britney needs to have a creative mind and needs to think what she wants to sing about. If she does, Britney will be able to write her own songs and become a better sucess. REAL PROFESSIONAL vocal training and a CREATIVE songwriting ability are the key elements if Britney really wants to be a star in the music industry.
B00004ZB9D|4.0|I really like this cd, probably because it's the best of.  I heard another funk/rock artist named Dawn Silva and she has a similar style on one of her rock cuts.  Kravitz and Silva should get together on their next CDs.
B000002MP2|5.0|What a fantastic album every Green album is good but this easily the best.No wonder its been so highly rated with the singles&quot;basket case&quot;&quot;longview&quot; and &quot;when i come around&quot;Every track is superb none are worth skipping.I never knew who Green day were till my mates said they were brill,but i never knew they were this good.These days Green day have been slated with&quot;warning&quot;which is still a fantatsic album but doesn't come close to this.Overall this and Nirvanas Nevermind are the best cds ever,forget the beatles or the rubbish limp bizkit this is a punk rock fans dream.Also listen out for on this cd&quot;welcome to paradise&quot;&quot;she&quot;&quot;coming clean and&quot;having a blast&quot;This is a must buy for any rock fan.
B000002BFZ|5.0|I'd always been a huge fan of Ten &amp; Vs when I was younger, but never got into Vitalogy, and when I listened to a friend's No Code, I didn't care for any of it. I became interested when Binaural came out, and I've bout 5 of the &quot;bootlegs&quot; and my love for PJ is all back. I went and got No Code recently, and after one listen was convinced it was the best PJ cd. There is absolutely NO NEED to skip any songs on No Code, I can't even say the same for Ten.  &quot;Habit&quot; is probably the weakest song on the record, but it is still rocks like the others. If anyone tells you this is &quot;harder&quot; to listen to than other PJ records-DONT LISTEN! this is the most listenable PJ record there is. There is nothing to say about No Code besides &quot;BUY IT&quot;
B00000DHRZ|5.0|This is offsprings best album by miles,but most people seem to think its the worst how with &quot;staring at the sun&quot;&quot;kids aren't alright&quot;&quot;shes got issues&quot;&quot;walla walla&quot;and the list just goes on,this does take a few listens but then your hooked.The only down side to this album is the final track&quot;pay th man&quot;which is one of those tracks you should just leave out but aprt from that its excellent up the with NIRVANAS NEVERMIND and GREENDAYS DOOKIE.
B00005AXEL|5.0|When all the talk about Trouble in Shangra-La first started, way back when, everyone said this would be Stevie's best work ever.  I thought to myself that she would have a long way to go to beat Bella Donna.  Well, guess what?  She beat Bella Donna, and then some.  There is not a bad song on this CD, and they're all beautifully delivered to us as only Stevie can deliver a song.  She takes us into her world with each song.  Those who feel this is not an excellent CD are just incapable of understanding Stevie Nicks and her lyrics.  She has a lot to say and she says it beautifully.  So rock on Stevie......rock on forever!! This is a GREAT CD!
B000002UAI|3.0|You know, it's strange.......if an artist brings out an album that you would say was his or her worst, you'd probably assume that the whole cd itself is garbage (maybe a hit single or something, but that's it). I've always acknowledged that Beatles For Sale, the beatles 4th British LP released was definitely not they're greatest achievement- of course they rushed through it just to ship it before Christmas. Of course it came between two movie soundtracks, and thge one before it, A Hard Day's Night, is considered by most to be they're best album of the early years. So, naturally there is going to be some letdown. But, somehow with the Beatles, the letdown isn't so apparent. The album is loaded with a bunch of really good songs. I'm A Loser, I'll Follow the Sun, Eight Days a Week, and Baby's In Black are my favorites- all of these could all be top 10 songs played on the radio (and I believe that at least one of them are...). No Reply, Every Little Thing, and I Don't Want to Spoil the Party are all solid and fun to listen to in their own right. And of course, there are some stinkers- I think that Mr. Moonlight could possibly be the WORST song that the Beatles ever sung (but at least they didn't write it). I mean, I take off one star just because of this horrible, horrible song! While on past albums the best pulled off the &quot;cover&quot; songs successfully, on BFS they don't- Lennon does a pretty lousy job singing Rock And Roll Music, and makes it rather silly sounding, really. The same seems to be true with the Kansas City/ Hey Hey Hey Hey Medley, although Paul puts alot of emotion into the &quot;Hey hey hey hey!&quot; part. I'm not too fond of Geroge's cover of Carl Perkins, but...he was a big fan (but thats no excuse to sing a bad cover!) Honey Don't is Ringo's &quot;contribution&quot; (ha, ha), and sometimes you wonder why they even let him sing at all (but, he had a couple of good songs, so...Ringo's alright by me). The other songs I usually just skip past. So,despite its high number of bad songs which aren't even really Beatle songs, there's a bunch of songs on here that you must here. Definitely do NOT pass this one up- it is they're worst, but...its still the Beatles (I mean, come on). You can't go worng.
B000056V73|4.0|I am 15 and I love music from the 70's which is why I rented this.  I thought it was pretty good.  The fact that some people call it boring is ludicris.  If you really like music or just good movies go see this movie.  You know you want to...
B00004XOWM|1.0|In the early 1990's, a sound of music came out of Seattle that was the opposite of what the 80's rock sound was all about. That sound, known as grunge, took the world very seriously and hated it all the way to the bank. Later, artists came out taking the bad parts of rock music, being grunge, and the bad parts of rap and combining it into one sound called Rap Metal. This album is exactly what that sound is. <br />I, originally, didn't want to buy this album because I don't understand the music and dislike anything that puts me down. I also don't like people who act fake to be popular, which is what they do, as well. That being said, sometimes, as I learned, it's wise to not buy something and not be fair because your conscience is usually a good indication of what you should do. I regret paying the money for this item and gave it away after listening through it once as it not only gave me a headache, but made me depressed.  It is all about hate, violence, and killing. Last time I checked, Rock and Roll was about sex, drugs, and rock and roll. While I don't like that saying because I'm clean and don't necessarily approve of frivolous sex, that style of rock music, which is still around, is up lifting and won't leave you with what I felt after hearing this horrid album.<br />Past it's vulgarity and posing to be something he's not by the lead singer, the musical instruments were played to a pretty mediocre level.  While I think the guitarist could get away from this band and maybe live through this horrid experience and have a career out of it, the rest are not going anywhere fast. The truth is that grunge lasted about three years, if that, and rap lasted for about 4. Rock and roll has lasted for 51 years already and is not going to stop any time soon. This is not rock, this is not even music. It's awful and I, for one, am not in favor of it being readily handed down to our children.  It is an embarrassment to rock, and I'm glad I got it out of my house.
B000051VWW|4.0|This is a great album.  Theres not a song on it that doesn't give you that cool laid back feeling that all of Sade's previous albums gave you.  The people that ripped on this album don't make much sense.  It has her beautiful voice and great beat that all the other albums had.  I do agree that it's not her best album ever though but what do you expect after so many years away.  Buy this album, you'll enjoy it.
0060900075|5.0|Mr Huxly delivers a succint, utilitarian, and utterly descriptive account, of his attempt to unburden himself of humanity's mandatory rational restriveness. While often being guilty of referring superfluosly to artists, poets and the like, he more than compensates with an unrivaled genius, and command of the written word, that is simply a pleasure to savour. His vast knowledge on myriad subjects was revealed to the reader in all its grandiose splendour, with a shrewd and insightful profundity, to rival even that of the great Dostoyevsky. He states &quot;Most people, most of the time, know only what comes  through the reducing valve and is consecrated as genuinely real by the local language. Certain persons, however, seem to be born with a kind of by-pass that circumvents the reducing valve&quot;. This utilitarian usage of the word permeates this work, like the flashes of light, and beauty of flannel that it descibes, and is surely a reference to Plato's notion that the mind works as a calming device to the natural instincts of the body. Also, by refusing to be restricted to a Western discourse, he illumanites a far greater area of his experiment, which in its own right is a recondite philosophical statement. This book was plainly stated written by a genius.
B00005AXEL|4.0|There is no doubt this is Stevie's best album in years! Infact, it's her second best ever. That says a lot for a member of the Rock N Roll hall of fame. I thought the greatest thing for Stevie on this album was hitting notes that had been lost by her for years. The songwriting on most of the songs is great and understandable. Stevie's best songs are the ones that makes sense and she dosen't blurt, but instead sings. The best overall thing about this album is it's full of great songs. Sorcerer has a great sound, Planets of the Universe rocks, Everyday is Stevie at her best in Pop form, I miss you has great guitar play from Lindsey Buckingham on it, To Far From Texas is a fresh and country-rock song, and That Made Me Stronger has a good sound. Still, there is no huge hit to carry away with this album. No Edge of 17. No Stop Dragging my Heart Around. No Leather and Lace. It's a great album in the sense of good songs from top to bottom. When it comes to a top 10 song on the album, it's not there. Stevie's Bella Donna still rules, but this is a close second.
0767805712|4.0|This film is one of a kind! Although it has no action, or special effects but the story needed not any to drive our emotions high.<br />This movie is a &quot;What if..?&quot; type of movie. What if humans were judged by there genes? What if success was determined by manufactored genes? What if something went wrong? A never ending what ifs... all are challanged and proven wrong by HUMAN WILL! You'll see a perfect well built human fail, and a normal human dream come true!<br />I recommend this movie to both Sci-Fiction fans and non fans..! It touches you with how can a perfect world be beaten and defeated by determination.
B000002BBY|5.0|The critics abhor it, the fans adore it. Whatever your take on '(What's the Story) Morning Glory?' is, you cannot fail to be impressed by its commercial success. It is no 'Thriller', but only a puny minority of albums manage to shift over 3 million copies in the UK alone. This figure is, if nothing else, a clear indication to one of the almost unique ability possessed by Oasis to get into the public domain, hence their extraordinary sales figures. Noel's sing-a-long, 'Wonderwall', has been adopted by vagabonds and buskers on a nationwide scale-a rather uncanny and ironic tibute to such a masterpiece-and 'Don't Look Back In Anger', which borrows 'its' opening chords from John Lennon's 'Imagine', is destined to become an all-time classic. The rousing 'Champagne Supernova' and melodic 'Cast No Shadow' are other notable highlights, but yet it is the overall consistency of the album which really sets it apart from 'The Great Escape', for example. The work of rival indie bands is often erratic-one minute it is sublime, the next it is ridiculous. The air of consistenty about the material released by Oasis ought to ensure them longevity as a band, but then there is the small matter of the Gallagher brothers and their erratic, ridiculous behavior... . Nevertheless: Blur better than Oasis-whatever; Oasis the best band in the world-definitely maybe!
B00003CWRX|2.0|I am not saying that this is a bad movie or bad story... not at all. But here are the disappointments that might hit you:<br />1. One of things that might disappoint the audience is that it cannot be easily swallowed after Russel's great movie &quot;Gladiator&quot;. 2. Second when you say Al Pacino, we remember his greatests &quot;Heat&quot; or &quot;Devil's Advocate&quot;. So this movie does not easily fit with many of his great movies.<br />So the success of this movie is no more determined by the actors past successful history, but only if the story is good or not. And yes the story was good and had its certain type of suspense but it gets in a frame that we all knew about this story and now it has got out.<br />In other words, we always believed that smoking cigarettes is an addiction. No this film told us why and how. So it's not new, but now it is out.<br />I see that this type of story needed not such expensive great actors except to attract more audience!
B000002AS3|5.0|'Definitely Maybe' put Oasis on the map in terms of chart success and critical acclaim. However, a negative by-product was also produced, courtesy of the album's exceptional quality: 'Definitely Maybe' provided Oasis with a platform from which they could only fall... . Let's not forget, though, that 'Definitely Maybe' provides the auditor with a wonderful collection of hard-edged indie tracks-'Rock and Roll Star' and 'Supersonic' epitomise this-as well as displaying Noel's undoubted song-writing ability and Liam's magnificent vocals. No superlative can do 'Definitely Maybe' justice, as truly great tracks were juxtaposed to produce this astonishing album.
B00003CX6P|4.0|Ripley (Matt Damon) in the beginning of the film built everything up. Very slowly and right from scratch. He was a no body, but always had the potential of being evil. He is talented, and he broke a barrier after another reaching a point of no turning back. He got himself in the dark side of the world, locked himself in when ever he needed a shelter from the sun of truth!<br />His talents were all based on evil. Started as a liar, manipulative, selfish and became a killer with no mercy! He claims love, but never loved anything except himself.<br />The film takes place in Italy with beautiful scenary, thrilling story and amazing music. You start up by being curious about Ripley quest, surprised by his goal, shocked by his moves then all the way thrilled by his cold blood!<br />Oh and I loved &quot;Tu Vuo Fa L'Americano&quot;!
B000001FDP|5.0|This, along with Soil Festivities, is a distinct break from his earlier works.  This one opens with a gong, agitated rhythm, punctuated theme followed by a thunderous intense (synthetic?) wordless latin-like syllabalic chorus-like voices on top. I don't see any vocal attributions to a single person let alone a whole collection of voices, so I assume it is some pretty sophisticated synthesizer stuff.  Nevertheless, it could be real humans not listed in the credits. In other movements, in addition to the chorus voices, there are lyrical passages in the alto/tenor range with similar wordless syllabalic nature that I also assume are synthesized. <br />Throughout the movements (6 of them) Vangelis explores themes and motifs ranging through lyrical, light, majestic, dark, brooding, abrupt, agitated and thunderous. The material is interesting, complex and rich.  If you're looking for elevator/supermarket/reception/on-hold fluff, then this is not the place to find it. <br />Its tensions never get strident or dissonant. If you are familiar with orchestral works, then, by comparison, the intensities and tensions don't reach the levels found in Ralph Vaughan Williams' 4th or 6th symphonies, Hector Berlioz's Symphonie Fantastique or Gustav Holst's Planets. You won't need therapy and it won't wear you out. <br />If you listen to all the movements in one sitting, the last movement will give you some well placed light etherial majestic relief and closure to the set of movements.  <br />I listened to this CD along with Soil Festivities while driving a motorhome up Red Mountain Pass in Western Colorado in 1985. On board were my family, mother-in-law and a guest British/Welsh family. The material gave great sonic material to accompany the visual material around us as we drove through some of the steepest and narrowest mountain highways in the US. The passengers found it a riveting experiance visually and aurally and one that they all remember years later. <br />This is one of my mostlistened to CDs. If I had to liquidate my CD collection, this one would be one of the last to go.
B00003CXDD|5.0|It makes me sad to see this movie dead.What makes it even sadder is that it is dead to the industry but not to the fans.From what i have seen in reviews of Willow it is very much alive and well in the heart of all fans.<br />I first saw this movie when i was about 9 or 10 and i loved it.It was lost to me untill a saw it on TBS a few years ago and said i had to have it but i was in for a rude awakening.&quot;Sorry but it is out of print&quot;the lass at the store told me . My heart sank i told her you have to find it for me.I was lucky they had a coby at another store and i got it in 2 weeks.<br />If you have not seen this movie then you should.All you need to do is look at all the other reviews.I mean ther are about 101 five star reviews for this movie.<br />I was lucky enough to discover Shadow moon ,Dawn , and star, but i want more, i want to see Willow reborn so my kids can see this movie, i do not want to see such a good movie died when there are so many fans that want to see it reborn.I am sure if Lucas made a sequel that it would let more people see the wonder of the  world he created and then more people will want to see this movie.<br />It just makes me sad to see a great movie died especially Willow.
B00005214X|5.0|I first bought this album when it was released in 1970 and it was apparent then that George Harrison was 'coming into his own' as a singer/songwriter. Not just one album at the time, but three! I was totally in awe. The magic of this album hasn't really worn off and it's still great to listen to.<br />I think at the time, George felt that he was under the shadow of Lennon &amp; McCartney and he was released through the break up of The Beatles and this album certainly has that in essence.<br />I even like listening to some of the Apple Jam sessions, particularly 'I Remember Jeep' with Eric Clapton's nifty guitar playing (I think Jeep was Eric's pet dog?).<br />If you're an apple scruff, which I have been a life long member folks, then you should have this album in your collection.<br />I've heard rumours of a new solo album by George scheduled for later this year? Hope so.  Thoughts and love are with him through the recent crises that he's undergone.
B000002KY8|5.0|This is an awesome, awesome cd.  However, they should really have put one of those parental advisory stickers on this thing! Now, I don't mind that sort of thing at all, but uptight  or immature people might get pissed off.  Little kids shouldn't listen to it....unless they want to actually learn something useful....  <br />There really are no bad tracks.  Everybody knows the title track, and most people know Little Red Corvette, but the real treat on this album, I think, is D.M.S.R.  It's this great, funky dance song that's 8 minutes long (not uncommon for this album).  Another great, long dance song is Lady Cab Driver, which you may want to switch it at the end because it gets a little graphic.  <br />The only song that I didn't love on this album was &quot;Delirious&quot;, because it just seemed a little goofy to me.  But all the other songs are absolutely fabulous, and they'll be absolutely fabulous 50 years from now.

0441172717|4.0|Frank Herbert's Nebula and Hugo award-winning &quot;Dune&quot; is widely acclaimed as the best science fiction work.  And rightly so.  As entertainment it's a suspenseful tale of adventure that sparkles with imaginative creativity.  When the family of Paul Atreides arrives on the desert planet &quot;Arrakis&quot; or &quot;Dune&quot;, they find that their goal to take over rule from the Harkonnen family is difficult to achieve.  Paul faces treachery, murder, as well as the rigorous conditions of a dry and deadly planet where water is more precious than gold.  It is only with the help of the mysterious battle-hardened desert tribe of Fremen, and his newly-discovered religious powers that Paul stands any chance of triumphing over the powers of evil.  The plot has a complexity of layers reminiscent of Tolkien.<br />The sci-fi classification does not mean &quot;Dune&quot; is inaccessible to non-sci-fi fans, because most of the traditional sci-fi elements are either absent or mere background.  Several remarkable scenes of hand to hand combat are more reminiscent of ancient Roman gladiators than of science fiction!  There are weaknesses: mature themes (such as allusions to pedastry) make &quot;Dune&quot; unsuitable for children, and Herbert's use of language is not outstanding. But what especially makes &quot;Dune&quot; great is the complexity of ideas.  Herbert has created not just a story, but a memorable world conveying an elaborate philosophy of ideas, with three outstanding themes:<br />1. ECOLOGY.  Arrakis is a barren and bare planet of desert sands, with characters reminiscent of desert Arabs (Herbert studied Arabic extensively in researching for the novel). As well as hosting titanic deadly sandworms, the desert sands feature a mysterious and narcotic spice substance known as Melange, which is central to the diet of its inhabitants, heightens powers of awareness, and is a central part of the economy.  The power and value of water in this hostile sandscape environment is manifested in that shedding tears is an expression of great devotion.  It becomes evident that there is a plan to rescue this planet from its barrenness and turn it into a paradise.  Significantly the book is dedicated to dry land ecologists.  Herbert was an accomplished ecologist himself, and one wonders whether he is expressing his own vision of the possibility of a man-achieved paradise on earth.<br />2. POLITICS.  There is a complex interplay of people, tribes, politics and economics, with constant scheming, plots and subterfuge revolving around personal and political ambitions.  Herbert has created an intricate and plausible history of tribes and peoples, with unique languages (much originating from Arabic), names and ambitions.  The lust for power and wealth is combined with a determination to succeed at all costs, stopping at nothing - even murder - to achieve it.  The political corruption and chaos of Dune's world is analogous to our contemporary world, as Herbert once observed in an interview: &quot;the scarce water of Dune is an exact analog of oil scarcity.  CHOAM is OPEC.&quot;  Paul's triumphant leadership is also thematic.  In humanizing a messiah figure, Herbert raises an important question: why do people blindly follow leaders?  &quot;Dune&quot; conveys his theory that &quot;superheroes are disastrous for mankind&quot; because even the greatest leaders are human.  Despite their strengths, relying completely on them is fatal.<br />3. RELIGION.  Religion is inter-woven with politics, and centers on women, such as the powerful matriarch, the Reverend Mother. Herbert at times seems to picture religion as the manipulation of the masses by the intelligent, since the Orthodox Catholic Bible functions as a human invention rather than divine revelation. The strong religious component especially comes to the fore with Paul, a Messiah figure who fulfils prophecies, the long awaited Kwisatz Haderach who is somehow both man and god, and from whom all blessings flow.  These prophecies have their own pitfalls - and are used to show the paradox of a system of predistination.  The religion is a mixture of Christianity, Islam (jihad and similar Arabic words are clearly borrowed), Buddhist philosophy, and a strong eastern mystical component. Strangely, there is no active involvement of the Creator, since &quot;the most persistent principles of the universe are accident and error.&quot;  The power of the divine resides instead within oneself, and there are definite occultic overtones, such as the mention of &quot;wierding&quot; (a form of witchcraft), and very obvious new age Eastern spiritualism and mysticism.  Herbert also makes a profound connection between technology and religion.  In light of the fact that this novel was written at the hey-day of space travel and lunar landings, it is remarkable that in an appendix Herbert observes that technology and space travel affects one's view of creation.  In his opinion, the god of technology and machine-logic is destined to be dethroned, and replaced with a renewed realization of the significance of man.  Instead of placing hope in machines, it is to be placed in mankind.  Herbert optimism about mankind is evident: a self-made paradise is attainable.<br />In short, Herbert has created a plausible world, reflecting his multi-faceted interests in society, culture, environment, politics, religion and science.  Dune's fictional cultures (Fremen), political parties (Harkonnen, Atreides), worlds (Dune), languages, religions, customs, geography, and ecology are imaginative, realistic, and function in a rich complexity that places him in the same league as  Tolkien and similar eminent writers.  Though written in the 1960s, the fact that Dune is still relevant, readable and in no way outdated is a testimony to its greatness.  You will find that this book has so much depth that you will not just read it once, but many times, with increasing enjoyment. So, don't hesitate, head for the sands of Dune for an unforgettable adventure!ngs flow.  These prophecies have their own pitfalls - and are used to show the paradox of a system of predistination.

B00004X01U|5.0|If you haven't bought the Music album yet, then hopefully this review can pursuade you to. I have never bought a Madonna album before, but this album has so many good tracks that its hard not to be a fan.<br />The first, title track is a classic, dance orientated song. Its retro, and really shows off the orginality of the album. The next single is gonning to be Impressive Instant. This is a great dance track, a bit like Music.....and I think its probably being released in the hope that it will be just as successful. However, the best tracks here are in the middle of the album. The poigant, mid-paced 'What It Feels Like For A Girl' is destined to be a classic song, and is also the only track not to have contributions from Orbit or Mirwais. The current single, this is one of the best tracks on the album. 'Don't Tell Me' is very innovative, although slightly downspirited. This is another great single, and one of my favorite tracks on the album (I bought 3 different copies of the single!). Another one of my favorite tracks is 'Nobody's Perfect'. The best slow song on the album, Mirwais manages to make up for his other ballad failures with what is again a high standard-setting track. With its plodding, methodical beats, this is a masterpiece.<br />William Orbits contributions are less impressive. 'Amazing' demonstrates what we've already heard from past singles such as 'Ray Of Light' and 'Beautiful Stranger', and so although nice, brings little new to the album. 'Runaway Lover' is a mistake - a very dance orientated backing, with the vocals at an unsuitably slow speed. This pales in comparison to Mirwais dance contributions to the album. Luckily, Orbits guitar ballad type song, 'Gone' manages to become classicly catchy, and is a very reflective number, which overshadows some other unsuperior slow songs on the album (I Deserve It and Paradise - both the work of Mirwais).<br />There you have it, the Music album is in fact incredible! Not only is it an album where nearly every track can be listened to without skipping (except maybe I Deserve It and Paradise), but it is loaded with so many innovative and standout songs that it leaves any competition aside. Unfortuneately it only has 10 tracks (the English version also contains Madonnas over-played, mid-paced interpretation of American Pie), but this is an album which places quality over quantity, and really shines with the assets it has. This makes the album much more consistent, and probably the best of 2000. If only all albums were this great! Definately deserving of 5 stars!
0060194995|5.0|Harper Lee didn't have to write another book after &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot;; she'd already achieved perfection. This is my absolute favorite book of all time; have read it over and over again, read it aloud to my spouse, and own two beautifully bound, autographed copies of the book, plus the movie. Scout, Jem, Dill, Boo Radley, Tom, and above all, Atticus Finch, are beloved characters more real than reality. What's the book about? Love, respect, humanity. Racism, false pride, ignorance. The ultimate triumph of the human spirit. A little girl who befriends a tragically lonely neighbor. An ignorant girl who betrays her kind-hearted neighbor. This book is so many things and so beautifully composed I think it would've been a shame had Harper Lee actually written another.
B000056VIY|4.0|I don't have a copy of On The 6, but I liked 2 of the singles from it, and upon hearing Love Don't Cost A Thing and reading reviews I decided to invest in the J'Lo album, instead of buying all the singles to be released from it! Overall, the album is a rather hit-and-miss affair, with varying styles (RnB, Dance, Pop and Latino). But there's something for everyone.<br />The album starts off with 2 of the albums 3 pure RnB tracks. Love Don't Cost A Thing sets a good standard for the album, and is a good comeback track. Very polished and commercial, a great first cut. The catchy I'm Real continues with the RnB theme, this is a cross between Love Don't Cost A Thing and Feelin' So Good, which is a good mix. Again, a very commerical song, this would be a good single release, although there are other tracks she may want to release which are a bit more varied.<br />Another album highlight comes next, in the form of the second single 'Play'. This is a nice change of style for Lopez, although it undeniably bears a resemblance to Madonnas Music both in style and lyrics. AGAIN, a very polished song.<br />Unfortuneately, the only pure dance track of the album, 'Walking On Sunshine', which attempts to recreate 'Waiting For Tonight's catchyness, just ends up in a horrible mess. Some people may like this, but in my opinion its a bit cold and unfun.<br />The rest of the album is heavily Latino flavored. Personally, I don't like this style of song, but I have no problem with Lopez including some Latino tracks. However, HALF the album has heavy latino flavorings (tracks 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14 and 15). I doubt Lopez will release more than 1 of these as a single, however. So it gets quite repetitive after a while. Some of them are nice, but I simply don't really like listening to them. Early indications are that 'Ain't It Funny' will be her next single. I really hope this is not the case. However, I do really like one of the Latino-tinged tracks: I'm Gonna Be Alright is incredibly catchy,and one of my favorite songs on the album.<br />Of course, I'm missing out a few tracks here. There are 2 ballads (tracks 7 and 11), none of which are amazing material, although Secretly is quite catchy. Rodney Jerkins 'That's The Way' is a nice RnB/Pop song, and has potential to be a single. However, I can never remember the tune for the chorus of this song, so it kind of fails in being catchy.<br />Finally, 'That's Not Me' is a really good Destinys Child type track, with an amazing chorus. It is RnB, but differs from her first 2 RnB tracks in style, so HOPEFULLY she will release this as a single. Probably my favorite track on the album.<br />In conclusion, the good tracks on this album make it worth the money. However, the rest of the songs drag it down and means a great deal of skipping is required. If I were her I would have cut down the album size, because by missing a few latino tracks the album would be an allround better effort. Its not up to the standards of Madonnas 'Music' or Janets 'All For You'. However, there is just enough good material here to cement Lopez as a major music star. Single potential/standout tracks: Love Don't Cost A Thing, I'm Real, Play, That's Not Me and I'm Gonna Be Alright.
0792844602|5.0|Thank god I gave this movie another chance!  A few years ago I watched this film on a local public television station.  The print they showed, however, was old and worn, with hundreds of lines and specks marring every scene.  Also, the color was so badly faded that it almost looked like it was filmmed in black and white.<br />But reviewing the film on a newly restored and enhanced print was nothing short of a revelation.  It was frequently gorgeous to look at, and the high quality of the print allowed me to focus on the story.  Many of the scenes were filmmed on location in the Middle East, which greatly added to the appeal of the movie (in American epics of the thirties, even the Crimea and India ended up looking like the Mojave Desert for obvious reasons--reminds me of the funny scene in the second Austin Powers movie, where Austin casually remarks while driving down a road that is clearly on the California coast, &quot;Isn't it amazing how much the coast of England looks like California?&quot;).<br />In 1939, the British film industry still lagged far behind the American film industry in technical proficiency.  Alfred Hitchcock, who left England in 1940 to work in the US for the next 25 years, managed to succeed despite the studio shortcomings, but even in his British films of the thirties the gap in sound and basic photographic techniques is all too apparent as we watch the films of that time.  One of the great achievements of Producter/Director Alexander Korda (his brother Zoltan directed THE FOUR FEATHERS while Alexander produced and owned the studio that made the film) was making the first films in Great Britain that rivaled the technical (as opposed to cinematic) accomplishments of Hollywood.  THE FOUR FEATHERS holds up admirably with most of the big budget films made in Hollywood in 1939.  The color is perhaps not as vivid as in GONE WITH THE WIND or THE WIZARD OF OZ, but it nonetheless is quite good for the time.  And this film is thoroughly convincing as an epic.  Thousands and thousands of extras were used, but unlike Hollywood, where whites were made up to look like Native Americans, Asian Indians, or Arabs, the extras in THE FOUR FEATHERS clearly hailed from one or another part of Africa or the Middle East.<br />The cast is solid, but two performances stand out.  C. Aubrey Smith made a career out of playing bombastic and self-important British Colonels or Generals.  And he never performed that role better than in this film.  But the best performance was by the always spectacular Ralph Richardson (does anyone else find a stunning physical resemblence between him and Kevin Spacey?).  No one ever stole a scene from Ralph Richardson.  Even in small roles he could dominate the action.  Tragically, his film opportunities rarely took advantage of his gigantic talent.  His technique and voice were the equal of Olivier and Alec Guinness, yet he never quite matched their film success.  He did, however, manage to excell on the stage.  In this regard, Richardson's career mirrored that of John Gielgud, whose screen career was equally paltry compared to his stage successes.  Apart from THE FOUR FEATHERS, my favorite Ralph Richardson performances are an amazing film version of A LONG DAY'S JOURNEY INTO NIGHT and Q PLANES (AKA CLOUDS OVER EUROPE).  His character in the latter was the direct inspiration for &quot;John Steed&quot; in THE AVENGERS on TV in the sixties.<br />Now for the scary news.  This marvelous film is being remade starring Heath Ledger (from A KNIGHT'S TALE--medieval history reborn as an MTV inspired movie) in the Ralph Richardson role and Wes Bently (from AMERICAN BEAUTY) in the John Clement role.  Kate Hudson from ALMOST FAMOUS takes the female lead.s an epic.

B000002P5R|5.0|Now, I bought this album awhile ago, and unfortunately, the first review I wrote was somehow lost in the system.  Since I have a poor at best memory, I had to just hunker down, listen to the CD again and do a proper review....<br />While definetely not the best Hendrix album, it is probably the best post-humous one (that's in print, at least), as far as studio work goes.  Jimi had an obsession with capturing his ideas on record, and this just further examplifies that obsession.  While I'd obviously get his official recordings  (AYE, A:BAS, EL, and BOG) and probably a live record or two (Woodstock, Fillmore East), this does prove to be an excellent record for the person who just can't get enough Jimi...<br />Much more polished than &quot;South Saturn Delta,&quot; the release that followed &quot;First Rays...&quot;, this album was meant to compile the material that was to end up on Jimi's fourth studio effort of the same name.  While Jimi originally planned to keep recording and produce a second LP to go with the first, his death unfortunately cut that plan short, and record producers were forced to spread out what had been completed over three post-humous, now out of print releases (Rainbow Bridge, Cry of Love, and War Heroes).<br />What we have now on &quot;First Rays Of The New Rising Sun,&quot; is an attempt to compile the available material onto one disc, in an order as close to Jimi's original wishes as possible.  Unfortunately, any claims that the CD was produced directly from Jimi's notes is a half-truth at best.  No one could have possibly known Jimi's plans, especially considering Jimi's distinct style.  He knew of a broad range of music, and so tracks may have been altered to give some a bluesy feel, or a jazzy feel.<br />Despite this, &quot;First Rays of The New Rising Sun,&quot; is still an incredible album, and still worth picking up if you are an intense Jimi-phile like me.  Although some tracks weren't mixed by Hendrix himself, and at least two tracksweren't the masters that Jimi had been working at, they still provide fantastic insight into one of the most creative minds of the twentieth century.  Intensely beautiful tracks like &quot;Belly Button Window,&quot; &quot;Angel&quot; and &quot;Drifting&quot; are seperated by heavy rockers like &quot;Ezy Rider&quot; and mild blues/rock tracks like &quot;Dolly Dagger,&quot; and &quot;Izabella.&quot; Throughout, the album retains a sense of &quot;togetherness,&quot; with a feel that most of the songs fit where they are on the CD.  It definetely is an intense listening experience, one that cannot totally be felt by just casual listening while performing other tasks.  No, instead, invest in a good pair of headphones, turn out the lights and lay still as you take everything in...<br />While not being perfect, &quot;First Rays&quot; is probably the best of the post-humous Jimi releases, and definetely worth the time and money it may cost you.  Even the liner notes are fantastic, including many rare photos, and almost 25 pages of fantistic track descriptions and essays.<br />If you fancy yourself a Jimi fan, than this record is for you.  If you respect Jimi's work, than this is for you.  Get it, it's probably one of my top 15 favourite CDs...<br />*(one warning though):  If you have a multi-speaker surround sound system, then you might want to invest in a smaller unit.  The mixes are sometimes fuzzy or tinny, and sometimes only are audible from a single speaker.  Other than that, I don't have any real complaints.

It is possible that Sabriel could even best the beloved Harry Potter books of which I am an enormous fan.  This book, Sabriel, by Garth Nix is a must read for all you fans of Fantasy.  I could say that it has had a profound impact on my life and I think that it will touch yours in the same way.  I laughed, cried, got embarrassed, and exuberent, and fearful along with Sabriel and her father.  I was almost IN the book along with the characters and MY parents were quite put out that I was paying no attention what-so-ever to their conversations while this book was in my hands.  I would stay up until 4 in the morning just to finish another chapter and then not be able to put it down the rest of the night.  I would SO recommend SABRIEL by GARTH NIX to anyone and everyone.  This is possibly the best book I have ever read and I must go and read it again to determine if Sabriel is THE BEST.  This is the highest recommendation I can give Sabriel and if I could give it 4 million stars, I would in a heartbeat.  Sabriel is a must read!!!!

There isn't a caring bone in his body!  He even dangles the baby, Sunny out a window, in a cage, to force Claus and Violet to do what he wants.  Why?  He is after their huge inheritance.  This little book has it all, including great vocabulary development.  What an entertaining book - but no happy ending.  Although this book was an assigned reading for my Children's Literature course, I enjoyed it and I am anxious to read all of the books in the series.
6305546789|4.0|How annoyed was i to order this item for the hologram cover and colour booklet only to have it arrive in a dull non holographic cover and no colour booklet..what a crock!!! The film does however look &amp; sound fantastic but dont expect the hologram cover kids...
0805062971|5.0|The main reason for reading this book...because you owe it to yourself. This is a beautifuly written peice in which the usual unmelodic tone of our culture is conviniantly tossed aside. The narrarator, along with his &quot;sidekick&quot;, ushers the reader through an examination of his or hers on life. Maybe the books success should be measured in the time spent by the readers as they try to make amends with their own pshycotic minds. And after all, Socrates himself says &quot;the unexamined life is not worth living.&quot;
B0000507R2|3.0|First, let me say:  I love Natalie Merchant's music.  Her voice is unmatched.<br />Second, let me say:  I think &quot;Tigerlily&quot; is her best work ever.<br />Third, let me ask:  Why did I bother...for an audio DVD whose quality isn't that much better than the original CD?<br />I wasn't expecting music videos or cool video &quot;extras,&quot; when I bought this.  I WAS expecting it to at least be re-engineered so the channel separation would emphasize the fact that I'm listening on 5 speakers, not just two.  It wasn't.<br />Live &amp; learn.
B00004Y6NM|5.0|This for me has got to be Erics best.The qaulity of the music,musicians and recording could not be any better(though why not HDCD?).I first got this back in 85 and now have the remaster.On my system which includes 845's SET amps and Lowthers and a Arcam 9 CD player I doubt that there could be any better listening experience.
B00005B6C9|4.0|IT TOOK ME A COUPLE OF TIMES BEFORE I STARTED TO LOVE THIS CD,BUT NOW I REALY DO.AS I LIVE IN EUROPE I HAVE TWO COPYS OF IT WITH THE TWO BONUS TRACKS,WHICH I THINK IS NOT ON YOURS OVER THERE.THEY ARE AMONG THE BETTER SONGS SO TRY TO GET IT ON IMPORT FROM AMAZON OR FROM JAPAN.THE BEST SONGS ON THIS ALBUM IS SACRED TRUST AND THE WEDDING SONG.BARRY HAVE LOST A LITTLE OF ALL HIS STRENGTH AND POWER IN HIS VOICE,BUT ROBIN IS ONLY BOTH LOOKING BETTER AND SINGING BETTER THAN EVER.MAYBE ITS TIME FOR A SOLO CD FROM HIM.AS I SAID,THIS IS THEIR FINEST SINCE MY FAVOURITE LIVING EYES FROM 1981,AND I EVEN NOTICED IT IS DOING WELL ON THE ALBUM CHARTS IN THE US.BEE GEES AND SPECIALLY BARRY IS THE BEST SINGERS AND SONGWRITERS OF ALL TIME.WHY DID BEATLES GOT ALL THE ATTENTION WHEN THEY ARE NOTHING COMPARED TO THESE GUYS.I WISH TO GOD THAT THEY WILL MAKE YET ANOTHER ALBUM,EVEN THOUGH IVE HEARD THAT BARRY IS NOT DOING TO WELL.BUT FOR NEXT ALBUM I THINK THEY SHOULD WORK WITH NEW PEOPLE AND LET A PRODUCER DO THE WORK.FOR EXAMPLE TOM DOWD WHO DID THE ROBIN CD &quot;WALLS HAVE EYES&quot; OR EVEN MAYBE ARIF MARDIN AGAIN OR WHY NOT LINDSAY BUCKINGHAM.BUT MOST OF ALL I WOULD SEE THEM WORK WITH KARL RICHARDSON AND ALBHY GALUTEN AGAIN.THEY DID THEIR FINSEST WORKS WITH THEM.OK,TAKE CARE,STAFFAN...
B000002TQB|5.0|The songs on here are funny, bright and dark at the same time as well as smart....definatly not jock rock :) I cant say anything that hasnt been said already, but in my  humble opinion this cd was worth the money!  Better than alot of american popular music....its poppy with a brain!
B000056VIY|4.0|I didn't really care for Jennifer Lopez at first, but I bought this album on an impulse because the first hit single &quot;Love Don't Cost A Thing&quot; was an R&amp;B smash, and so was the club friendly &quot;Play&quot;. What I have come to realize is that Jennifer's new album is very upbeat and retro and might even appeal to people who have bought her debut album &quot;On The 6&quot;. As for her vocals, I really don't see what all the fuss is about, she is capable of delivering notes just as good as other artists, but let me not make any comparisons. Besides the two obvious songs, I like others such as the funky techno-pop &quot;Walking On Sunshine,&quot; the rawness of &quot;Cario,&quot; the sensuality of &quot;Secretly&quot; the optomistic &quot;I'm Gonna Be Alright&quot; and the latin fused &quot;Dame&quot;. If your the type of person who has a taste for all musical styles, then I would definitely recommend it! I hope you found my unbiased opinion helpful.
B00003CXGG|5.0|Hi, I was just amazed at the talent displayed in this movie.The story was amazing the acting was good and aalyah definitley made a great acting debut. The Music was hot.

0140149295|5.0|After watching &quot;The Hurricane&quot; starring Denzel Washington. I started searching for this book, and then finally Amazon started taking pre-orders for it!<br />It's the greatest book I have ever read! I couldn't put it down! I read sometimes all night long! I strongly recommend you to read this book!
B00005IC2H|5.0|Sigur Ros, who make no one's music but their own, are the finest ambient band I've heard in the last ten years. From long winters and slate and billowing steam and a harsh old language somehow come an unearthly choir, reassuring serenity, and a line that drives and drives.  This is music that you can only listen to, not comprehend, as it goes beyond trance to magic, into a world of gray wave, ultramarine ice, and violet night roiled with storm.  Lie on the floor, listen to Sigur Ros and marvel at what goes through your mind.
0451457994|5.0|This book is just brilliant! Arthur C. Clarke is a genius! I remember when I first saw the movie and I was astonished, I wanted to read the book right away. When I read the first chapter of this book I couldn't stop. I highly recommend this book!
6303566448|4.0|... the DVD was released by Elite Entertainment. The features on the DVD include: widescreen, two commentaries, trailers, and best of all, 20 extra minutes of the film. This is the unrated edition, and it's well worth looking for.
0345339703|5.0|My entire life I had a set of Tolkien books sitting on a book shelf in my house.  This set contained 4 books: &quot;The Hobbit&quot;, and the three books of the &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; trilogy.  On a few occassions I told myself that I had to read these books, since I knew that they were known as the best fantasy books ever.  I started &quot;The Hobbit&quot; on a few occasions but never could get past the first chapter because it starts quite slow.  However, once you get into that book you will not be able to put it down.  The same is true for &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot;, the first book of the trilogy.  I would suggest reading &quot;The Hobbit&quot; first so that you know the background.  This book is the greatest book that I have ever read, and I feel quite confident that the next installment (I just started it) will be even better.  This book is simply amazing.  If you like fantasy or you are a Star Wars fan or you just like to be inspired, this is the book for you.  This book takes you into a dream world, yet the world is not unlike the world we know.  There are many similarities.  Please read it...and enjoy!!!
0788731041|5.0|It has been years since I read Possession and I remember liking it very much indeed; I recall thinking at the time, &quot;Storytelling is not dead.&quot;  Listening to the unabridged audiobook confirms that Possession is every bit as good as I remembered.  Maybe better.  Possession has it all: mystery, poetry, fairy tales, letters, diary entries, poets and academics, science and spiritualism, past and present, a Victorian love story and a contemporary one, Victorian energy and scientific progress versus the sterility of modern literary theory.  The audiobook narrator handles it all with great skill.  Only once in sixteen hours of tapes did I find myself momentarily confused about who'd spoken a bit of dialogue; for the other fifteen hours and fifty-nine minutes or so all was clear.  The reader's voice is pleasant and easy to understand; she reads a variety of materials equally well and handles a great many voices skillfully enough to make them distinct without resorting to distracting characterizations.  (A near-exception: the accent given to Professor Cropper was a trifle odd, but distractingly so.)  This audiobook could have you wishing a long car trip were even longer or make you log a few extra miles on the treadmill every day until you finish it.  You may even find yourself listening to it while you do your housework.  It's that good.
B000000H5J|5.0|This album starts off with some killer tracks, DEMANUFACTURE and SELF BIAS RESISTOR. Those 2 songs alone are reason enough to buy this CD. FEAR FACTORY is full speed ahead music in your face that just hits you and knocks you off. BURTON C BELL has the voice that not only can sing melodies, but he also has the thrash screaming voice that metalheads love. The guitars are straight in you face with some fast killer riffs. YOUR MISTAKE, ZERO SIGNAL, DOG DAY SUNRISE, NEW BREED are just a few of the killer trakcs that make up this album. I would recommend this album or DIGIMORTAL for listeners just getting interested in FEAR FACTORY. Also dont forget to give FLASHPOINT, H-K(HUNTER KILLER), and PISSCHRIST a listen. If you can find the digipak with the bonus tracks, I recommend that u buy it.
B00000IAU3|5.0|Didn't expect much from this cd...  but I must say it is great!!!  One of the best debut album in years.  If you're looking for a smooth music CD, this one is for you!<br />By the way, there are way better songs than &quot;Thank You&quot; on that album!!!<br />I'm impressed...
0062511408|5.0|Maravilloso!!! Este libro me ha cambiado la perspectiva en la vida.Desde que lo le me he propuesto, dentro de lo que cabe, a hacer lo posible por llevar a cabo mi &quot;historia personal&quot;. Es algo as como &quot;el pequeo prncipe&quot;, una historia sencilla con un vocabulario simple, pero con mucho corazn, que a su vez encierra la clave para una vida plena y feliz. Perfecto para quien necesite un cambio refrescante en su vida y todava no ha hallado el valor para cambiarla.
B000002KBU|5.0|I'm a big fan of many female artists: Tori Amos, Kate Bush, PJ Harvey, Emmylou Harris, Rickie Lee Jones and Joan Osborne among them. As such, I cannot believe that I missed this album, and this artist, for so many years. I bought &quot;Blue&quot; on a lark, and within ten minutes of listening to it, I was turning to colleagues at work saying &quot;Oh my GOD. This is incredible.&quot; I literally cannot stop listening to it. Amos, Bush, Sarah McLachlan, Fiona Apple--they all owe a debt of gratitude to Mitchell--she clearly paved the way. <br />Great, great album. Has joined my list of favorites.
0780020685|5.0|Kurosawa is one of the greatest directors to ever live. The man lived and breathed film. <br />Seven Samurai is widely regarded as his greatest work - and that really is saying very, very much.<br />Now I'll reserve my comments for this exceptional dvd - but let it stand that I simply cannot think of a better movie.<br />Of course one expects something grand out of such a highly regarded collection as the Criterion most certainly is. It delivers in most every way.<br />To begin, the video presentation is top-notch. The movie was originally filmed in, and is presented here in, its full screen ratio. This simple fact already gets over the (ironic) hurdle that many early Criterion dvds had in that they lacked anamorphic video. Seven Samurai, of course, has no need of an anamorphic transfer because it is not letterboxed to begin with.<br />While the video is a far cry from anything (recent) we are accustomed to... this film has simply never looked better. It is old and very, VERY dated. I, however, never found any of the film damage distracting. Once you are half-way through the movie you suddenly realise that you are not even noticing it any longer.<br />The video transfer is great.<br />The audio is presented in the original Japanese, mono soundtrack. Many people go running when they hear that a movie is either Japanese only OR mono. This is both :) <br />Fact is (and any true movie fan would agree here) that watching ANY foreign movie dubbed is a watered-down experience. Kudos to Criterion for not wasting their time on dubbing like many other studios do.<br />No to address the mono track. It is quite the norm presently, for studios to go ahead and re-master their old movies in 5.1. I haven't a clue whether the original sound setups (they need to be available in a particular form to even make remastering a possibility) were available - but that is aside the point.<br />A remastering of a grand soundtrack like this, without Kurosawa's direct involvement, would again bedestroying his original vision. Kurosawa was known to be *incredibly* exact in what he wanted on his film. I would simply not trust anyone but the director himself... an obvious impossibility.<br />The audio is perfect.<br />Fact is, that this dvd was not made to be a crowd-pleasing, bargain-bin special. It is a polished and impressive disc for people who love film. And any one that would like to call themselves a film lover without having seen this epic is already off to a bad start.<br />The greatest film ever created? I believe so. And with the (phenomenal) commentary and great transfer - I left the dvd without wanting any more.
B00003CXSP|5.0|For starters, I fully disagree with all the critics who blasted this movie for being different compared to Silence of the Lambs.<br />This is one of the best movies I've ever seen, and one of my favorite films of all time. The acting, directing, locations, and effects were suberb. <br />Giancarlo Gianni deserves a Best Supporting Actor Oscar. His performance was the most believable I've ever seen. Also, this movie deserves to win the Oscar for Best Makeup, for the character of Mason Verger.<br />Anthony Hopkins and Julianne Moore were excellent, the few scenes they were in together were excellent.<br />I just would like to say to everyone out there who avoids this movie because they hate the book: Don't let the book scare you away from the movie, the movie is much better than the book.
0517122707|5.0|This may be the best book I've ever read. I go back and re-read it every couple of years just to amaze myself, and each time I come away as astounded as ever.   One warning: You may not be able to read anything else for a while afterwards. This novel is so brilliant it dulls everything by comparison.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|My wife bought this CD for my birthday.  I never anticipated it, but playing The Beatles 1 turned my (elementary school age) kids into big Beatles fans.<br />The songs they like most are &quot;Love Me Do,&quot; &quot;Can't Buy Me Love,&quot; and &quot;All You Need Is Love.&quot;  But their absolute favorite is &quot;Yellow Submarine&quot; which they sing at the top of their lungs in the car whenever the song comes on.<br />The Beatles just prove that beautiful songs are timeless.<br />It always warms my heart to think that I am broadening my kids' horizons (and that we now have something I can listen to on family driving vacations that's a little more sophisticated than 'N Sync and The Backstreet Boys).<br />Show your kids that music did exist before they were born -- by introducing them to The Beatles 1.  (It will make you seem, in their eyes, years younger.)
B00000J7JO|5.0|Californiication will always be remembered by me,as an incredible and unforgetable cd.It has 14 songs of pure greatness,including Road Tripin,Around the World,Otherside,Parallel Universe,and the peaceful Porcelain.This is a perfect cd,combining their old-school sound (I Like Dirt,ect.)with a very new one (Parallel Universe,ect).BUY THIS CD.
B00003CXDG|1.0|Those who have seen this film know the gargantuan task Woo presents the viewer - staying awake. Nevertheless, you really have to hand it to Woo. He somehow manages to avoid delivering on the fundamental promise of the &quot;action&quot; genre - excitement and thrills - while simultaneously maintaining legions of adoring fans. The objective viewer, of course, calls it like it is - trash. And here's the capper - the DVD promises 45 extra minutes of Woo. I would have thought the marketing folks would want to keep quiet about this little tidbit.<br />For those of you who do like Woo, here's a Woo-it-yourself tip: take any actual action movie, and right at the critical moments of excitement, just when you start to get that edge-of-your-seat feeling, play it in super-slo-mo. When you feel all that exhiliration drain away, you'll know you've done it right.
B000002UJQ|5.0|PURE GENIOUS!INCREDIBLE GUITAR WORK,OUTSTANDING MEANINGFUL LYRICS,SWEET CHURPING VOCALS(Thom Yorke),and AND SOARING MELODIES!WOW!CHECK OUT MY OTHER REVIEWS,PLEASE.
B00000099Y|5.0|This is easily the best album ever! Just to start look at the awesome techno eye and smokebox pic on the cover, that alone is worth the 13 bucks. I admit i used to hate tool I used to call them &quot;a bunch of flamers&quot; until i heard Sober on the radio and bought Aenima a couple weeks after, soon after they became my favorite band. I was amazed at the guitar riffs, and incredible vocals. Stinkfist is an incredible song. .... &quot;Third Eye&quot; (longest song on album), Stinkfist (Most trippiest song/ video of album), &quot;Aenema&quot; (title track of album), &quot;Message to Harry Manback&quot; (funniest track on album), &quot;H&quot; , &quot;Jimmy&quot;, &quot;Eulegy&quot;, &quot;46 and 2&quot; all great. This album is incredible. And from hearing &quot;schisms&quot; on the radio last night their fourth studio album Lateralus (to be released May 15th, 2001) will be great as well. If you like Aenima check out A Perfect Circle, Nothingface, Deftones, Staind, Orgy, NIN
B000059RL3|5.0|It amazes me that the themes and sentiments that Marvin Gaye expressed in 1972 are still so contentious and relevant in the age of this 'new millenium'.  Racism, taxes, war, poverty, jobs, pollution, drug usage, etc...  And in the 30 years since it was originally released it would appear that very little has changed.<br />This album is more like a collection of related short stories than a musical work.  It always amazes me how smoothly the transitions occur between songs that have different themes, tempos, and sentiments.  You're totally unaware of when one song ends and another begins.<br />The instruments range from bongos to violins.  And all are seemlessly interwoven to paint the pictures of desperation, pain, disbelief, confusion, outrage, friendship, love, and mercy.<br />This would probably be one of the 5 albums that I would want to take to a deserted island if I had to go.
B00002ZMNV|5.0|Metallica really hit something with this. I loved the S&amp;M Audio CD I bought it at Midnight the night it was released. Then I recently got a PS2 and got some movies. By far this is the best. Multi Angles, Band Only, Orchastra Only, and basiocally anything you want. My favorite song ever by Metallica is One and it was played wonderfully. Battery was played great too. This is the greatest thing ever by Metallica. Even if they did start the whole Napster thing.
B00005AXEL|5.0|All I can say is that it's good to have Stevie back...releasing timeless albums with brilliantly beautiful songs (&quot;Love is&quot;).  People tend to focus on all the &quot;Guests&quot; on the album but really they stand in the back and merely compliment Stevie's brilliance.  I have much respect for Sheryl Crow as a producer after hearing what she did with &quot;Candlebright&quot; and &quot;Sorcerer&quot;...this CD is worth SOOO much, keep buying it folks!
B000059Z8J|5.0|What other DVD would have extras including: both director and creative consultant commentary; the entire film digitaly redone (including the deleted scenes);  more deleted scenes that show Lex Luthor's deadly &quot;babies&quot;;  a recent documentary that has new interviews with the crew and cast (including Christopher Reeve and Gene Hackman!...); the teaser trailer, original trailer, and t.v. commerical, the masterpiece John Williams music only soundtrack plus more songs (the &quot;Can You Read My Mind?&quot; pop version); finally, it's one of the most entertaining films of all time.  And the disc is only under $20!... Do yourself a favor, get this DVD and Part II, and you'll have a excellent night of viewing for the whole family.
6300274195|5.0|This film offers a parent an opportunity to discuss the &quot;bully&quot; words and actions that can hurt anyone, even Dumbo. His Mother's anger is addressed; showing &quot;everyone&quot; no matter what their station in life, must pay the consequences and in this case Ms Dumbo is given a &quot;time-out&quot;. As a Grandma of 3yr old Emily, I have the time to research the media and address solutions to how our children are dealing with situations like &quot;Columbine&quot;.  We must start with Pre-Schoolers NOW so they do not tease, laugh at, or bully ANYONE.  We can make a difference and DUMBO has made that task easier for me. This animated film is fun; Walt Disney was far ahead of his time!  surfgranny
B00003CXRP|5.0|Lots of people are saying that this movie was halfbaked, that it couldn't hold itself. Well for me it was something quite refreshing, the visuals and directing are astounding, thanks Mr.Zemeckis. The acting is great, thanks Mr.Hanks. The story is compelling, thanks Mr.Broyles. The music is superb, thanks Mr.Silvestri. and finally thanks Fox and Dreamworks for being the distributors of this great film. I liked more Gladiator but still this one I'm also buying. Better than Zemeckis's last film What Lies Beneath, I'm not saying that it was bad, just not as good as Cast Away. I almost forgot, thanking Helen Hunt for taking that supporting role and Steven Spielberg Executive Produced the film. ---
0767802470|5.0|&quot;Das Boot&quot; has stood the test of time to become not only the greatest submarine movie ever made, but also one of the greatest war movies ever made.  <br />At the outset, the viewer must understand that he/she is NOT watching an American movie.  If you were, it would probably star George Clooney or Kevin Coster attempting to speak with a German accent, which would be a real tragedy in itself.  It would also have a blatantly annoying soundtrack, lot of shots of the women back home worrying about their men, and loads of bad dialogue.  &quot;Das Boot&quot; fortunately contains none of the above.  What is does contain is a great story with top-notch production values, acting, and direction.<br />The story begins with the captain (expertly played by Jurgen Prochnow) and his crew celebrating the night before they will set out to sea in a German U-boat.  These men, little more than boys, have no idea what they are about to experience.  The captain does know, and you can see that realization on his face and in his character throughout the film.  A young, idealistic correspondent obtains permission to travel with the crew and document their journey.  The film really belongs to him as we see how he reacts as the realization gradually comes to him of exactly what he has stumbled into.  <br />Director Petersen has done an outstanding job of showing us what it was like to serve on a WWII U-boat.  You can almost get lost in the film, imagining the close quarters, the sounds, even the smells of being in a sub.  Some viewers have commented that so much of the film is &quot;boring.&quot;  Again, audiences watching nothing but Hollywood films feel that an explosion has to occur every five minutes for the movie to be exciting.  This movie is exciting, but the excitement builds from the tension that runs throughout the entire film.  Sure, there's down time, but even at three and a half hours, there are no wasted shots.  The ending???  Wow!  See it for yourself!<br />All aspects of the DVD are also wonderful.  I would have liked to have seen more of the making of the film, but what's there is very good.  I recommend watching the film in the original German with English subtitles.  Even if you're opposed to it, at least try it for the first 20 minutes.  More people should see this film.  It's worth your time.

0684833395|5.0|The definitive post war satire should be consumed and appreciated by all literarys. Heller brilliantly manipulates his vast array of characters in hilarious situations, poignantly weaving the doomed bombadier Yossarian's tale into the catastrophic ironies of the war so often overlooked by the populace. In Yossarian, Heller created one of the great characters of modern literature, and with Catch-22 he set the standard for literature surrounding the second world war. The literary world will miss the words of Joseph Heller, which always seemed to be precise and discerning.
B000006045|5.0|it's simple really...i am in awe.  i have been trippin the trip-hop fantastic for some years now, and mezzanine was an album i have always had an eye on.  it never leaves my sight....those pinchers you see on the cover?  the smooth oil like shell of the creature?  beauty and beast all in one nice tight package...and that's exactly what you're in for when you pop this gem in your cd player.  the album starts with the infectious &quot;angel&quot;...a heavy, yet siren like piece of work.  it merely sets the stage for a journey through the deep receses of your mind...a playground of phantom thoughts and pleasures that stand alone.  the playground is called &quot;mezzanine&quot;... midway through the trip...this trip-hop fantastic that is....the fifth track &lt;exchange&gt; gently brings you to an even realm ...merely the intro to the other side of the album.  the eerie &lt;dissolved girl&gt; begins....&quot;such a shame, i seem to have lost myself again&quot; says sara jay... how is it that this cd is so perfect?  because it has the ability to hit every pressure point in your soul...you feel tinges of pain...sorrow...joy...desperation...the dark side of reality with an overshadowing of fantasy.   i know i'm rambling....but i can't help it.  this collection of music is simply some of the most amazing music ever created... you will love this album....you will cherish this album...you will fear this album.   it's a soundtrack...the mind- movies i have written and seen with mezzanine as my guide are numerous.  get this cd....it's your ticket to another world.  trust me...you're in store for a massive attack. peace.
B0000057C5|5.0|I have found it impossible not to give Rammstein anything less than five stars. They are undeniably great musicians, capable of crafting excellently catchy music and extremely memorable lyrics. As you may remeber, I was told before I got into them that they were &quot;nothing more than a joke band&quot; and &quot;what metalheads flock to when Marilyn Manson becomes too tame&quot;. These comments are becoming more and more ineptly incorrect. The second batch of 11 songs are still just as great as those on Herzeleid: The two best tracks would have to be the beautiful, dramatic &quot;Spiel Mit Mir&quot; and the immesely catchy and complex &quot;Engel&quot;. Another great track is the stellar opening &quot;Sehnsucht&quot;, heavy, progressive, and memorable. &quot;Du Hast&quot; may have been a hit, but it achieves strength past its commerciality with true power. The cover of Depeche Mode's &quot;Stripped&quot; is somewhat harmed by badly pronouced English lyrics, but is still catchy, hard, and, if one goes deeper, strikingly beautiful (I would attribute this mostly to Flake's keyboard work). The guitar-driven &quot;Tier&quot; is another great track, as is the overlooked &quot;Bestrafe Mich&quot;. The unforgettable &quot;Kuss Mich (Fellfrosch)&quot; is a powerful album closer. &quot;Bueck Dich&quot;, while potentially offensive to some, is still a very strong heavy metal piece(though its probably more entertaining, or sickening, live). Problemm tracks begin with &quot;Klavier&quot;, which has unforgivable similarities to the far superior &quot;Seeman&quot;, but is still excellent in its own right, especially with some truly haunting lyrics--&quot;Eifersucht&quot; is also another like it, echoing &quot;Laichzeit&quot; but still accomplishing much. The worst track is the still great &quot;Alter Mann&quot;, which fails like &quot;Der Meister&quot;, because it has little to make it memorable. All in all, no matter where one's tastes fall, this is still remarkable stuff, and anyone who appreciates music or metal should own this. By the way, I don't quite own &quot;Live from Berlin&quot; or &quot;Mutter&quot; quite yet, but I am eager to see whether they live up to Herzeleid and will post my comments on them as soon as possible. <br />Guten Tag, fächelt Musik!
B000059R8Y|5.0|After being a huge Clapton fan for 35+ years, I've seen his ups and downs and musical directions. After being somewhat disappointed with &quot;Pilgrim&quot; (over-produced), I'm very pleased with &quot;Reptile.&quot; It is 'quality' Clapton from start to finish without being glossed over with production. It's a cross section of the best elements of his last four albums while still being fresh. The added texture of &quot;The Impressions&quot; on background vocals is a nice touch. Of course Clapton's passion shines through very strong. His vocals and guitar playing are immaculate throughout especially the guitar solo on &quot;Come Back Baby&quot; which is salty blues at it's best. &quot;Reptile&quot; covers a broad range of styles including bossa nova, blues, soul, R&amp;B, aoustic and rock. His arrangement of J.J. Cale's &quot;Travelin' Light&quot; is also interesting. It has a &quot;Dire Straights&quot; kind of feel. To this reviewer, &quot;Reptile&quot; is Eric Clapton's best and most consistent work in recent years, ...at least in the 21st century. Perhaps he is &quot;Superman Inside.&quot;
B000003TAW|5.0|I'm not one of these people who associates this cd with childhood memories, i didn't have a clue who Weezer were a few years back.  I bought this last year, and i still listen to it nearly every day because it doesn't get tired after repeated listens, it 'matures with age'.  You begin to notice the beauty of the guitar arrangements, or spot a harmony which you fall in love with.  The instumentation is fantastic, subtle drumming, laid back bass (especially on Only in dreams) and the great distorted guitars.  The huge contrasts between the subtle pluckings in the verses and the whirring power of the chorus in Say it ain't so is what makes the song so fantastic.  On an earlier review, i read that someone sang the whole album with his friends, and that is exactly the effect Weezer has on me- these are the sort of songs that are made for singing along to (unluckily for the majority of my neighbours!).  The interwoven vocal harmonies are fantastic, the ending of Undone, and Holiday have wonderful multilayered vocals. This is also one of those great albums that exists as a whole, the track order means that you are led through different moods effortlessly, the climatic 'heartbeat' section of Holiday signals the ending, and Only in dreams draws the album to a close as well as Pink Maggit does on Deftones 'White Pony'. After buying this cd i've lent it to a lot of my friends, and they all love it and have become huge Weezer fans, we're counting the days till we can see them live in a few weeks!
6300214540|1.0|All formula, from aerial shots (not any of which are impressive or original) to acting. I like Tom Cruise as an actor but he does not a thing for this atrocious, utterly predictable flying picture. A real crash for all concerned.
B000002OZY|5.0|In 1968 The Who were rapidly on their way to becoming bankrupt and on the verge of breaking up. Group leader and head composer Peter Townshend and manager Kit Lambert were banking on that the first rock opera would bring them international success and acclaim. A year later it did.<br />&quot;Pinball Wizard&quot;, &quot;I'm Free&quot;, and &quot;See Me Feel Me&quot; were the big hits from &quot;Tommy&quot; but it has to be heard in its entirety to be fully appreciated.<br />This CD was remixed and remastered by Jon Astley and it blows away all previous editions including the gold disc release.<br />A very influencial album, I highly recommend it.
0451450523|5.0|After i was blown away by the movie, i suddenly had the urge to read the book and i noticed that this was different from the movie, but who cares. Anyway, it deals with a Unicorn who seeks out in the world to see her lost companions who are kept hidden from the wicked King Haggard, along the way she even meets every animation lover's favorite wizard &quot; Schmendrick&quot; who turns her into a Human Girl and still seek them out. A must read if you love the movie.
B000002OVJ|5.0|Make no bones about it, this is where The Who realy shine; on the concert stage. <br />The original release of &quot;Live At Leeds&quot; was at the very least frustrating, because so little of their repitoire was represented on record. This is rectified by going to the original 8-channel tape and using the original running order eliminating most of &quot;Tommy&quot; but using everything else. The end result is staggering.<br />Totally remixed and remastered by Jon Astley, this blows away all previous editions. Highly recommended.<br />By the way, you can hear &quot;See Me Feel Me&quot; from &quot;Tommy&quot; on the &quot;30 Years Of Maximum R&amp;B&quot; box set.
6304712499|4.0|in 1997, me and my mom saw this in the theaters and we both liked it. i've always been fascinated with both TV Show and Comic Books ( a Spawn Fanatic). the story deals with Al Simmonds ( Michael Jai White) who gets murdered by his scum bag boss &quot; Jason Wynn&quot; ( Martin Sheen) and is sent to hell, makes a deal with the evil lord of Darkness &quot; Malbolgia&quot; and becomes a Shapeshifting avenger named &quot; Spawn&quot; so that he can see his wife again. The DVD Director's cut is the only one worth watching instead of the lousy PG-13 Version that they had dumbed down, i know that The Clown ( John Leguizomo) can be annoying but you can just forgive that and just see this movie with a different if interesting twist to the superhero stuff and some spectacular visual effects.
B000002OX7|5.0|Words cannot describe what an incredible listening experience this CD is. Every song on here is a masterpiece, and if some of the songs are (heavily) overplayed SO WHAT!?! That does not take anything away from what brilliant compositions they are and how flawlessly they're performed.<br />This CD was remixed and remastered by Jon Astley (Pete Townshend's brother-in-law, by the way) and it totally blows away all previous editions.<br />If there's anything to carp on, it's that it wasn't issued as a double CD; there are too many superb songs from the &quot;Lifehouse&quot; sessions that were left off. <br />That said, you NEED this CD; you cannot call yourself a rock-n-roll fan unless you have it!
B00005JG6Q|4.0|Just to let you Akira fans know, if you have not already figured it out, that this DVD has a new english dub.  I do not think they are releasing the old english dub on this disk.  Also, they are releasing two DVDs.  One is the standard version and the other is the Deluxe version.  The regular has the english and japanese with the widescreen version of the film and the deluxe has a behind the scenes on the remastering as well as other goodies.  I have heard mixed reviews on the new english dub.  I was a little upset at Pioneer for not including that old english track on the DVD as well.  Aw well, as they say, life's not perfect.
B00003CXQY|5.0|Disney does Warner Brothers.  That's what best sums up this rolicking, non-stop gag fest.  No cutesy side kick, no beautiful princess, no flashy computer effects, no songs (well only one small one), no real moral, just a heck of a good time waiting to be had by all.  Simply put, if you like to laugh, you'll love this film.  Children will enoy the bright colors, quick pace and wacky characters.  Adults will enjoy all that plus all the jokes that go over younger ones heads.  This is truly a film for all ages.<br />Not only is the film great, but the presentation is fantastic.  This is a digital to digital transfer, which mean no degredation at all from the original source.  Colors and textures practically leap right off the screen and into your lap.  Sound is crisp, clear and presented in Dolby Digital as well as DTS.  You'll want to experience this one in all it's surround sound glory.  Also included on the DVD is an action adventure game that's pretty darn good considering that you have to control it with your remote control.  There's also a funny viedo that teaches you how to dance like a llamma!  The kids will love these features.<br />Now what really make's this presentation shine is the second DVD.  It offers a veritable rosetta stone of animation, taking you more in depth than any making of I've seen (and I've been getting behind the scenes info for years now thanks to laserdisc).  From development and story to clean up and sound it's all here in detailed splendor.  You'll even have to chance to view side by side comparisons of different animation stages to see how the film evolves.  Taking a more hands on approach, you'll get to actually choose which combo of the three different soundtrack elements of one scene to play.  This feature really shows you the power of sound and how it adds depth and excitement to a film.  This second DVD is entertainig, fun and enlightening.  Not to be missed for Disney fans (you get to see up close and personal the Disey Animatin building), animation buffs or people who just loved the film and would like to see more.<br />Get hip to the groove and pick this one up fast.  Your entire family is sure to enjoy it immensley.  It's wild!  It's crazy!  It's down right hillarious!  And the second disc will only deepen your appreciation of Disney artistry.

B00000BKDZ|5.0|This CD is exellent. &quot;Infinite Dreams&quot;, &quot;Can I Play With Madness&quot;, &quot;The Evil That Men Do&quot;, and &quot;The Clairvoyant&quot; are all classics that any Maiden fan can sing off the top of their head. &quot;Infinite Dreams&quot; is a great song with metallic guitar that is great to hear in concert. &quot;Can I Play With Madness&quot;&quot; is a poppier song but is wonderful and is the most known song off the album. The title track is a great slab of metal with a memorable chorus. &quot;The Evil That Men Do&quot; and &quot;The Clairvoyant&quot; are two other great standouts. The album closes on a high note with the rocker &quot;Only The Good Die Young&quot;. In conclusion, this is Maiden's best work and should not be missed, no matter if it is a concept album.
B00003CXE7|2.0|The only thing that really makes this movie worthy of wasting our time is Russel Crowe's acting as &quot;Maximus&quot;, a Roman general.   I have to say, however, that this movie was a brave attempt to make an epic like those of Hollywood's golden age.   Unfortunately it didn't work out and one of the main reasons for this is probably the arrogance of the filmmakers that literally distorted and changed the entire Roman history so it could fit in there movie, as if the history of the great Roman Empire was not interestig enough for hollywood. The worst of all is that Hollywood underestimated the audience's intelligence by filling the movie with frenetic scenes of battles and putting aside the real roman story(wich is much more intersting)as if the public could only be impressed by scenes in wich someone's head is cut off and not by the amazing history and legacy of the Roman Empire.
B00005AXEL|1.0|After hearing such classics as &quot;Edge Of Seventeen&quot; and &quot;Rooms On Fire&quot; this pales next to them. The title track offers a promise for a good CD, but it quickly goes down hill from there. She sort of has a voice like Macy Grey, it changed vastly since the last album. Stevie once again fails to make herself popular by adding a few newer artists, Sarah McLaughlan and Sheryll Crow. Also she needs to stop trying to be some music goddess! Look at the cover, how more fairytale-like can you get? In conclusion buy her older stuff. If you already have ALL of her older stuff(even the worst of the old is better than all the new) save your money, something better is bound to come out. Hey, you can't get any lower than the pits.
078062999X|3.0|Hamlet cries out for cutting, for complete removal of the martial frame &amp; merciless editing of LONG asides on the theater wars &amp; the art of acting that STOP the play. Branagh is NOT a bad Hamlet, especially when he quiets himself (a particularly nice graveyard scene performance), but Jacobi might have been better employed as Polonius, Winslet is an unconvincing Ophelia, Christie is neither here nor there as Gertrude, the Altmanesque cameo casting is distracting (though some of the celebs perform capably), the opening &amp; closing scenes are grossly extravagant (Hamlet is NOT Henry V?), the straight jacket &amp; modern fencing gear are silly notions, the whole thing rings stiff/false/inflated. The 1990 Zeffirelli/Gibson is truer to the spirit by being less obviously obsessed with the letter?
B000002BYC|5.0|This album has it all.  Do the Evolution is the best song from the album and it is their best video.Brain of J is a throwback to the young Pearl Jam.  All Those Yesterdays is a perfect ballad.  Yield really shows the range the band has which makes them one of the best and most underapprciated bands of all time.
B0000524E5|5.0|I love this movie so much.I saw it when it was in the theaters,back in August of 2000 and thought it was the best film of last summer.The movie has a plot and isn't just about women who dance on a bar top.The movie is about Violet Sanford who has a dream of being a singer/songwriter,so she moves out to New York City.Violet goes from record compnay to record company to try and get people to listen to her demo tape,but no one is interested in her and tell her she needs to go to an open mic night.She tries to do the whole open mic night thing,but it doesn't work for her.So she gets a job at a bar called Coyote Ugly.I won't give too much of it a way,if you haven't seen it.This movie is very good.The acting is great and it was very well writen.A must see!!!!!!!!

6303921248|5.0|I had to read this book in school, years ago now, and to be honest didn't enjoy it much.  Then when it first came out i didn't watch it because i am not a fan of period dramas, it wasn't until i watched Bridget Jones diary, that my mind changed.  I fell in love with Mark Darcy and heard he was based upon Mr Darcy of pride and prejudice so i set out to watch it.(mark darcy is definatly just a morden clothed Darcy)<br />It was truly fantastic, i watched it all in one go ( a mighty 6 hours!!)  Whilst watching i remmebered the book, and to my surprise there were many parts of the book in this adaptaion.  Colin Firths portryal of Mr Darcy was truly amazing, i didn't fully understand his character when i read the book, but he seemed clearer and deeper in this film.  Colin Firhts eyes did just as much acting as the rest of his body put together...<br />But, apart from Darcy (the reason i watched it) the other characters were truly marvellous, and superbly casted.<br />A brilliant film, and i am proof that anybody can enjoy this.
B00005ATQD|4.0|&quot;Eyes Wide Shut&quot; is a very hard film for me to sit through. There is brilliance in just about every nuance of its story, in every masterful shot, in the superb direction of filmmaker Stanley Kubrick, who makes his presence known throughout the movie with his unique techniques of camera movement and cinematography. The story has little to be desired in terms of complexity and movement, which is subtly suspenseful and very poignant. But there are some aspects of the movie that cannot be passed by, like the film's gratuitous amount of nudity and sexual practice. But still, the movie has a lot to offer. <br />Kubrick begins this fascinating film by introducing us to William (Bill) Harford, a gynecologist, and his wife Alice. They are an upper-crust couple with a daughter living in New York City, and our first glimpses of their life seem perfectly normal and undemanding. Kubrick even goes so far as to show us their commitment to one another by putting them into several risque situations during a party scene in the first act. Alice drunkenly dances the night away with a total stranger, who keeps trying to persuade her to run away with him, while Bill is set upon by two women who are obviously doing more than making simple conversation. <br />The spin on their fairy tale marriage comes the night after the party, as Alice and Bill share a joint in their room. Alice brings up the two girls at the party, which Bill counters with her waltzes with the unknown man. Alice becomes antagonized by his opinions on women and the trust in their marriage, and reveals to him a sexual longing she once held for someone else in the beginning of their marriage. Bill is upset by this, and finds an excuse to leave when he is called away to visit a deceased patient. Thus begins an intense foray of extensive eroticism and sexual temptation that threatens to destroy their marriage and Bill's life. <br />The movie walks a fine line between fantasy and reality. Upon hearing his wife's admissions, Bill becomes plagued by dream-like visions of his wife's fantasy. It is these vivid pictures of his mind that drive him to the edge of fidelity, as he will later meet a hooker, attend a party which looks like something straight from the &quot;Kama Sutra,&quot; and find himself trapped in a web of deception among those he thinks are his friends as well as with himself. Kubrick masters Bill's subconscious by revealing a small piece at a time, leading up to the last full, shocking image of his wife's &quot;infidelity.&quot; These are small, shocking cuts, but remain important in the advancement of the character's mind. <br />Kubrick keeps the pacing well-timed and subtle, keeping the suspense at bay until the final moments when all the secrets are revealed. Attention is critical in watching this movie: there is a lot to miss by not giving your full attention to particular scenes. Each sequence plays a crucial role of some sort, whether it be an advancement of the plot or some small secret leading up to the big finish. <br />And what a finish it is. The movie is a milestone in creating a sense of high tension without ever going overboard on the suspense. Kubrick balances the physical and outer aspects of suspense with the inner tension of Bill's mind quite well, never losing focus of the point he is trying to make through this story. The ending is very satisfactory, one of those that ties everything together before finishing itself off in the last fade-out. All of the plot points you thought were useless and unnecessary come to light in a climax that is truly inspired and relieving. <br />Every nuance of this movie practically screams &quot;Kubrick!&quot; His attention to details and his grace in filming keep this film on par with his other films. I recognized his tracking shots, such as those of people walking down hallways, from his film &quot;The Shining.&quot; This is perhaps the most stand-out feature of his career, and one he is most noted for. His use ofcolor and light imagery are also very fervent. His characters are cast in lights that make them look pale and death-like, while the surrounding colors of the set pieces and the streets are branded with vivid hues and tones. And the images are quite shocking, to say the very least, some of the most shocking I've ever seen in a movie. <br />Which leads me to wonder, was it really THAT necessary to have so much gratuitous sexual scenes spread throughout the plot? I know that Kubrick likes to shock his audiences with images sometimes,... but the graphic display of the party scenes seems to be a bit of a wandering from what the movie is all about. There's an old saying that goes, &quot;Less is more.&quot; The movie would do a lot better in following this adage, instead of showing all the goods. <br />The performances at the front of this motion picture are helmed gloriously by real-life couple Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman, who play the married couple qith ease and extravagance (not like they needed any coaching or anything). Cruise is composed yet torn apart inside, barely showing emotion until he cannot hold it in any longer. Kidman's performance is both moving and disappointing at times. I found her confrontations with Bill about her fantasy to be quite disturbing and beautifully mastered, but in her revelation of a dream she had been having, her sobs seemed a bit forced and unconvincing. But, looking past all that, these two actors have a bravura talent that presents itself beautifully onscreen. And what about that chemistry? <br />Rounding things out, &quot;Eyes Wide Shut&quot; is an inspired and mesmerizing look at fidelity, the mind, and emotion. Kubrick's masterful storytelling and filming techniques shine out in this, his final project, standing out as a truly brilliant achievement in movie-making. Pick it apart, and you'll find that there is more to this movie than what you see on its cover.
B000002I2M|5.0|The thing that I love the most about classic rock groups is that they made ALBUMS, not a collections of songs.  Also, when listening to an album, it is nice to not have to skip over songs.  Well, this is one of those albums.  Every song is good, and listening to the whole album at once is an experience.  The first track, The Changeling, while not being the best song on the album is pretty good, and it flows into Love Her Madly.  This is a good song and since I haven't listened to the radio in quite awhile, I am not sick of it anymore. Next is Been Down So Long.  This song is great, listen to it loud.  It is a wonderful and original blues song.  Next comes Cars Hiss By My Window.  This song may take a little while to get into (after you skip ahead and listen to LA Woman and Riders on the Storm which, I must confess that I did when I first got this CD, but then I settled down and listened to the album straight thru and loved all of the songs), but it is really good.  It's kind of a mix of jazz and blues.  Now comes perhaps The Doors' signature song, L.A. Woman.  What can I tell you, we have all heard this song and know it is great(or you wouldn't be reading this review).  Did you know that Mr. Mojo Risin' is an amagram(i think that's what it's called-where you switch the letters to spell different words)for Jim Morrison?  Anyway, next is L'America which I think is the worst song on the album but its still a good song.  Next is Hyacinth House.  This is alot like Cars Hiss By my Window.  Crawling King Snake is a wonderful blues cover the Doors style.  It has a wonderful riff to it which by the way I just taught my self today.  Next comes the Wasp.  This is one of those songs where Jim reads/sings poetry over the music.  I like that kind of thing(at least when Jim does it I do)so I like this song.  And finally, Riders on the Storm.  Again, we have all already heard this song on the radio and all know how great it is.  So, overall, I think that this is the best final album done by any group that I have heard (see Pink Floyd's The Final Cut and Led Zeppelin's In Through the Out Door).  If you like this review please hit the button that says Yes.
B000001EAQ|5.0|A delicious mix of surreal electronic motifs and insanely groovy melodies, Pop delivers on a visceral level qute clear from the opener Discotheque, a classically brilliant manufactured poppy song sees u2 parody music culture with their own form of disco and the edge's funky guitar riffs.  Bono's voice is darker here, moreso then any other u2 records.<br />this records proves more then any other record of how well electronic music can be incorporated with rock and roll to invent a fresh sound..case in point-Do you feel loved with the riffy chorus and glaring basslines.<br />other then setting out to explore music territory in every sonic way electronically and pulsatingly, the record feels soulful stuff in the vein of the classic u2 sound, staring at the sun with its lush sound, velvet dress with its atmospherically beautiful tones and if god would send his angels with its haunting lyricisms.<br />One of the best electronic songs is seen in Bono's song to his mother, mofo.<br />the only bad thing is the repetitive Miami track which gets on your nerves pretty fast.<br />one of the classic highlights with all the good stuff is the playboy mansion.<br />this should be in every music listener's collection.
B00000K19E|1.0|when i first watched the matrix, i immediately thought, &quot;this is my favorite movie!&quot; much to my victimization. the special effects seemed other-worldly, the acting profound, and the story smart. naturally, it was predictable, especially the fact that the oracle told trinity that she'd fall in love with the one - it didn't seem that obvious, but you just knew it. forgivable, right? after my second time of viewing it, i just couldn't sit through it - it was great but after seeing the making-of, i could practically see the wires carrying neo. by the fourth, it was great again, forgiving the knowledge of how it all worked. however, before it even got stale, i started seeing its flaws: the guy trinity kicked to the wall hit the guy behind him, but the strings were still flinging him about; a truck flies through a brick wall, but the bricks react like cardboard; that annoying guy, tank (michael jackson reincarnate - only cornier). then, i saw everything that was wrong: cheesy script, pornographic acting, underwhelming effects, yawn-enducing story. and the questions raised were endless and unforgivable: how does everyone know what's going on inside the matrix? if there are cameras, how come they didn't know the agents' every move? why didn't the agents detect neo's cell phone when he first used it under morpheus' direction? then, i realized how shameful and unoriginal the story really was (&quot;the one&quot;? come on). the attemps at memorable cliches were miserably broken down by the overuse of coincidental and drammatic lightening. the attemps at an analogous epic bears a metaphor enlightening only to a moron, if any metaphor at all. no merit or ingenuity found whatsoever. and the ending was gross. this gets a one because you really can't rate something that you can't sit through as any better. go buy gattaca or something. the matrix only puts the &quot;dick&quot; in &quot;predictable.&quot;
B00000IFP6|5.0|Usually, you get what you pay for.  Occassionally, however, one finds an outstanding product at a low price.  This is one such item.  Getting David Zinman's nine Beethoven symphonies for $... is somewhat like getting a brand new Ferarri for $20,000.<br />Zinman follows Beethoven's original metronomic specifications, which seem to have been neglected by other modern-day conductors.  He uses the New Barenreiter Edition, which is supposed to be a more &quot;authentic&quot; score, and the Tonhalle Orchestra Zurich performs the symphonies on modern instruments instead of period hardware.  This is probably what Beethoven would have wanted, because modern instruments are so much better.  In any event, the effect is overwhelming.  Suddenly, many familiar passages take on a whole new meaning and seem to make more sense.  I will probably donate my von Karajan CDs to charity, after I have listened to them one last time to remind myself of how much better Zinman's rendition is.
0812589041|5.0|Ender's Game is a must-read for any reader.  The book, which is set in the near future and follows the point of view of a child prodigy named Ender.  We follow Ender from his departure from his family on Earth to watching him become the best soldier ever seen in Battle School, an academy for fellow child prodigies.  The descriptions of the events that happen throughout the novel are both very intellectually insightful and emotionally moving.  The ending of the novel is nothing less than amazing.<br />Many people have come back to revisit Ender's Game because of Card's newest &quot;Shadow&quot; novels.  If you've not yet read Ender's Game and are considering reading any of the Shadow boooks first, DON'T!  Ender's Game is my far the best of any of these books, and reading Ender's Shadow (which is not as good of a novel) will ruin this book if you ever decide to read it.  For those of you debating whether or not to purchase is book, I highly recommend doing so.  I've found myself rereading it many times.
0684853523|2.0|I'll make use of Mr. King's own advice at the beginning of On Writing. I'll be brief. I bought this book as I buy all of King's books nowadays - blindly. I have confidence that even in his worst endeavours I'll glean a nugget or two of wisdom, or quite simply be entertained for a good week or so, lost in the world King himself created for me. On Writing's first half help me rapt. It mainly consists of auto-biographical info, which I loved. Then we get to the nuts and bolts. What's a gerund? What's a participle? Yawn. I read Warriners in high school. I read Strunk and White in high school and again in college. If I wanted to learn grammar, I'd pull both of those books out of the attic. I thought what I was purchasing was some insight into King's writings - The Stand, The Dark Tower series. What I got was King telling me not to use adverbs as descriptors for how people said something ie. &quot;I hate this book&quot;, he said increduously. So for the hell of it I grabbed a King book at random off of my shelf(Wizard and Glass) and low and behold, King breaks his own rule on the first damned page!    Until he writes an auto-biography, I'll stick to his fiction. This one left me cold.
B00000AOUD|5.0|For Jethro Tull's &quot;Thick as a Brick&quot; album, Ian Anderson writes the lyrics, composes the music, sings the songs, does the arrangements, and then finds time to play the flute, acoustic guitar, violin, saxophone, trumpet and whatever else is lying around.  On top of that, he creates Gerald &quot;Little Milton&quot; Bostock, the eight-year-old prodigy whose scandalous poem &quot;Thick as a Brick&quot; was deemed unfit to receive first prize from The Society For Literary Achievement And Gestation (SLAG), and Julian Stone-Mason B.A., who reviews the Jethro Tull album &quot;Thick as a Brick.&quot;  All of this is chronicled in the four pages of the St. Cleve's Chronicle, all of which is faithfully reproduced for the little booklet that comes with this CD.  The review by &quot;Stone-Mason&quot; concludes: &quot;One doubts at times the validity of what appears to be an expanding theme throughout the two continuous sides of this record but the result is at worst entertaining and at least aesthetically palatable.&quot;  Who am I to argue?  I enjoy the satirical articles in Anderson's faux newspaper (e.g., &quot;Non-Rabbit Missing&quot;) almost as much as I enjoy the music on the album.<br />Thematically &quot;Thick as a Brick&quot; is similar to &quot;Aqualung.&quot;  Again the writing is dense and enigmatic, but of course this is part of the fun.  Anderson bemoans the social decay but he sees salvation down the road, but ultimately the lyrics take a back suit to the music and the brilliant arrogance of creating sections on the &quot;single track&quot; that are unique and yet clearly part of the whole.  The thematic unity of the songs on &quot;Aqualung&quot; is now more than matched by a musical integration of various styles into a complete whole.  You can recognize aspects of English folk music and classical bits in the mode of Handel, along with various types of jazz.  One of the nice results of this grand design is that for the first time Anderson's singing seems well suited to the music.  By this point in the group's history Anderson had surrounded himself with the musicians who would finally allow him to explore his unique artistic vision.  In the end just remember: &quot;your wise men don't know how it feels/to be thick as a brick.&quot;  This is Jethro Tull's best album from start to finish, although certainly they come close to reclaiming the magic in &quot;Passion Play.&quot;s well suited to the music.

B000002UJQ|5.0|Radiohead are not simply another rock band.  They are not simply an art project.  They are the perfect combination of those two things, and they are the best combination of that in the world today.  OK Computer is not simply a music album, it's a statement, it's a companion for misery, and something to be truly inspired by.  Every song will give you something different, and each track is impossible to skip over.  Ask 10 different people, and they will all most likely have a different favorite track from this modern-day masterpiece.
B00005ATQM|5.0|I must say, that the sound quality of DVD-audio is awesome, even better then some of the gold remastering job (ie Mobile fidelity, god rest it's soul..). Edit: as of 2014-03-06 Mobile Fidelity Sound Labs is alive and well.<br /><br />I do notice some \\"mistakes\\"..or perhaps it's just my system.  I am using a Sony DVP-7000 player (non-dvd audio).  On the regular Cd on Wolf and Man, when Hetfield says \\"So seek the wolf in thyself\\" he howls on \\"self\\". Now this disk \\"self\\" is just \\"self\\" no howl..weird. There are also major level changes in Sad But True. It fades in and out in places in the song. Now I should note that I have only 2 channels of playback available. so if for instance the howl were in the back speakers and the \\"self\\" were n the front, that might explain why I am not hearing it. Perhaps in Sad But True, the music is panning front to back so for me it appears to fade when it's in the channels I don't have. However I don't notice this behavior on normal DVDs when the sound changes channels, and I have the sony set to stereo down-mix.<br /><br />Any comments anyone?<br /><br />I still give it 5 stars for it's overall sound quality. Definitely worth it, and perhaps if these are mastering problems, the DVD-audio tracks do not have them...
B000002AZ8|4.0|VITALOGY is a cool record in my book. <br />One of the few things I didn't like about their debut and soon-to-be classic TEN was the awful production. It made every song sound the same and sometimes drowned the bands abilities. VITALOGY instead sounds like recorded in a Garage and this is a good thing to me. Nowaday's it's even more refreshing. <br />Starting off with the very good &quot;Last Exit&quot; &amp; &quot;Spin the black Circle&quot;, VITALOGY doesn't disappoint. You got your great Ballads (Nothingman, Better Man, Immortality), you got your typical great Pearl Jam (Satans Bed, Whipping, Not for you, Cordoroy) and you even get a weird, trippy sound collage called &quot;Tremor Christ&quot; in which the Band managed to insert a haunting melody. Great stuff!<br />Then you also get &quot;Bugs&quot;, &quot;Hey foxy&quot; and &quot;Pry to&quot;. To understand these songs it helps to see this album as Pearl Jam's musical middle finger to the Industry, MTV and all the business people that tried to profit on them. VITALOGY is not commercial in the least and certainly not radio-friendly, chart material. It sounds awful to anybody who normally listens to whatever is on the Radio or MTV and what music-magazines and clothes-designers try to establish as &quot;cool music&quot;. I think the point of these three songs is to underline their anticommercial attitude on this record. That doesn't make them good songs, I even hate &quot;Foxy&quot; with a passion, this is the worst possible way to end an album, ever. <br />All in all, VITALOGY is a must-buy if you are into Pearl Jam. Some great stuff in here, despite the awful uneccesarry 3 fillers. They are what keeps me from giving it 5 stars, but who cares. Buy it if you liked TEN and VS and even if you only half-liked TEN ( like me ).
B00005B6C9|5.0|After listening through the whole cd 3 times over, we are absolutely hooked!  As each new cd of the Gibb's was released through the years, each time we would say to each other &quot;Wow this new cd/album of the Bee Gees is my favorite!&quot; But then, the next one would top it!  And that is what we think again!  TIWICI tops them all!  What a bargain, at any price!  Any one of about 6-7 of the songs could potentially be   # 1 chart songs!  Such a great beat, and as usual, outstanding lyrics.  What a wonderful refreshing change from the boring/rhythm-only/lyric-anemic stuff we are stuck with from most radio stations!  Wow, BEE GEES, I don't know how you do it, but you have thrilled us again !!!  And the music video of TIWICI !   How hilarious !  Just love you guys, and your dear cross-dressing friend!
B00004U8JV|4.0|Though &quot;The Lost World&quot; has been totally ripped apart by critics and audiences over the last 3 years, it really never deserved any of it. It's certainly not as good as &quot;Jurassic Park,&quot; but it's surprising well-made for a sequel. The interesting story revolves around Malcom's efforts to rescue his girlfriend on the island where Ingen's dinosaurs were produced. In reality, the movie is one big chase with one expertly directed action scene after another. The raptor scene is especially intense, with a group of people being stalked in a field. The DVD is really a good buy, with great extras and an awesome picture. Oh, and the sound is reference quality, even without DTS. &quot;The Lost World&quot; is spectacular entertainment made even better on DVD. On a side note, the previews for Jurassic Park III are out, and it looks like it might even beat the first movie.
B000002MFN|5.0|This is probably the best record I have ever heard - and I've heard a lot. Without getting to high brow, the most interesting thing about this album is the struggle between the Apollonian and Dionysian. In &quot;Erotica,&quot; Madonna puts on the costume of a dominatrix - ready to love you and destroy you with equal relish (much like the protagonist in Coleridge's poem &quot;Christabel&quot; ....&quot;Secret Garden&quot; incorporates a piano with dance beats to create a sparkling paradise ripe with fleurs du mal.  Baudelaire would be proud!
B0000026J6|5.0|Leonard's got his stuff together on this one...except for Jazz Police.  If you remember his previous dismal music, this'll be a pleasant surprise.  It would also be good to view his Austin City Limits video of it.  Amazingly tight band.  It's no wonder why so many other artists (Joe Cocker, Jennifer Warnes, etc.) pick up his tunes to take them farther along.  If his being born with the gift of a golden voice doesn't crack you up, you might need another artist to enjoy.
B000003TAW|5.0|this cd is amazing. I had never heard of them till one of my friends introduced me to punk. even though these guys aren't all punk they're some of everything. emo, pop, punk. No matter what they are they're amazing. u get hooked on this cd. its like addiction u just can't stop listening. this is the one cd i can't live without. From the first song on this 10 track wonder, &quot;My name is Jonus&quot; u'll love them. all through the cd the songs amaze me they're so simple yet complex and awsome.

B00005AXEL|5.0|To listen to the sterling tracks one after the other on Stevie Nicks' TROUBLE IN SHANGRI-LA is to bask in a near-embarrassment of riches.  In what ranks as the legendary rock poet's most complex and haunting work since her deeply personal contributions to Fleetwood Mac's TUSK album in 1979, TROUBLE IN SHANGRI-LA manages to provide something for just about every ear. From the  delicate, lump-in-the-throat emoting of the moving EVERY DAY and I MISS YOU, to the roof-raising rock of FALL FROM GRACE, this recording proves, once and for all, the brilliant musicianship and versatility of an artist whose time has really arrived.  As critics finally awaken to the power of a woman who has created a veritable universe of passion and feeling with more than three decades of songwriting, those of us who have known this for a very long time can sit back and say I TOLD YOU SO.  The bottom line: a thrilling and glistening journey with an artist who has only become more powerful in her ability to enchant.
6304082428|5.0|By far the most accurate, filmed and acted version of Jane Austen's novel that I have ever had the privilege to see.  There is a reason why this A and E home production was and is still their most successful production.  The cast could not have been improved upon, and it is true, you will be longing for your own Mr Darcy by film's end.  Jennifer Ehle brings the character of Elizabeth Bennett to life and is so believable, you will wish it never ended.  You actually want to be her, transported back in time, to experience her courage, wit and growth as a young woman yourself. I won't go into a synopsis on the movie, for there are far too many already and I could hardly improve on them, but I cannot say enough about this film. If you see any version at all, make it this one. Even the most cynical who do not enjoy classic novel or movie period pieces will fall in love with this classic.
6305736650|4.0|Bogart is the reason this film is a classic.  The screenplay comes second.  If you want to watch a film about a man who is so broken up by the loss of the women he loves that he doesn't care if she puts a bullet in his guts, then this film is for you.  Forget the war theme, forget everything else. It is a film about a broken heart, and if it wasn't Bogart it wouldn't be a classic. By the way, the extra documentary on the making of the film is a quality piece of work.
B00004Z459|5.0|This has to be one of the best albums I've ever got. All the songs are fab. From the well known &quot;Crawling&quot; to the fab intro of &quot;A place for my head&quot; to the slightly wierd &quot;Cure for the itch&quot; this cd won't dissapoint.  I'm willing to admit, I'm not too keen on Papa Roach &amp; Limp Bizket so for those new to the rock/rap type genre, or those who have a wider musical taste, this one's for you. This band will go far!

B00005AXEL|5.0|This is an excellent CD.  Stevie Nicks sounds great on every track.  I loved the song Planets of The Universe.  It has a great beat and very poetic images of nature.  I wasn't famillar with Natalie Maines from the Dixie Chicks, but she has a lovely voice.  She sounds great here with Stevie on the duet Too Far From Texas.  Love Changes is a song about people can grow insecure in a relationship  This song also talks about how feelings can change in a relationship.  I think everyone can relate to the lyrics in that song. Every Day is a beautiful tune about love is as essential as the air we breathe.  Stevie sounds great on the acoustic guitar on the song Sorcerer.  This CD will stay in my player for a long time.
B00005AXEL|4.0|After the commercial and critical failure of Stevie Nicks' last studio album STREET ANGEL, I think many wrote off her solo career as through.  I think that this will be the album to prove them wrong.  By far her most slickly produced album to date, TROUBLE IN SHANGRI-LA NONETHELESS nonetheless proves that Nicks remains relevant as an artist and songwriter, while managing to corral a wide variety of artists to help her convey her music.  Does this rank with her best work, though?  Well, a strong case can definately be made for the title track, an uptempo tune with an incessantly urgent chorus that stands with her best rock anthems(think 'Edge of Seventeen' meets 'Stand Back').  Also noteworthy are 'Too Far From Texas', featuring beautiful vocal work from Nicks and Dixie Chick Natalie Maines, as well as 'That Made Me Stronger', one of five tracks produced by Sheryl Crow.  She also handles the album's ballads pretty well, especially the lovely 'Every Day', 'I Miss You, and 'Love Is'.  While parts of the album are a little overproduced, the fact that she collaborated with as many as seven different producers doesn't detract from the overall consistency of the record. This is a strong addition to Nick's solo catalog--and as a sidenote, for those who let critics warn them off from buying her previous two albums(the aforementioned STREET ANGEL and 1989's THE OTHER SIDE OF THE MIRROR), go out and get both, which, in my opinion, represent her best and most underrated work to date.
B00005B7CK|5.0|O BROTHER WHERE ART THOU? was one of the best films I saw all year.  Ethan and Joel Coen(FARGO,  THE BIG LEBOWSKI,  RAISING ARIZONA) have written a movie using the ancient story line to The Odyssey and turned it into the tale of a man's determination to escape prison and stop his wife from re-marrying.  The sheer brilliance of this movie deserves an applause.  Set in the Depression Era,  this comedy/musical(if you will) begins with Everett,  Pete,  and Delmar escaping off the chain gang.  Everett has told them that he has buried 1.2 million dollars near his home,  and they must get to it before the land is made into a river.  Thus begins this amazing movie with countless allusions to The Odyssey.  The blind prophet from the story becomes the blind railway man who tells the men they will go on a quest.  Then,  the men are seduced by three women singing,  the Sirens of course.  And who can forget the one-eyed man Big Dan Teague showing the ruthlessness of the Cyclops?  All in all,  this movie's great script(nominated for an Oscar) and awesome performances make this movie great fun.  George Clooney is incredible as Everett,  and this is the role which won him the Golden Globe award for Best Actor, beating out such stars as Mel Gibson,  Robert Deniro,  John Cusack,  and Jim Carrey.  John Turturro is a chameleon,  a brilliant character actor and great in this movie as Pete.  One of the best played roles is that of Delmar,  played by Tim Blake Nelson.  He is a perfect comic relief character and I feel the most likeable of the three.  In the supporting areas,  John Goodman rocks as Big Dan Teague,  and he can now be called somewhat of a Coen Brothers regular,  having been in THE BIG LEBOWSKI and RAISING ARIZONA.  Holly Hunter,  also a Raising Arizona alum plays a perfect and motherly Penny,  Everett's wife.  Charles Durning is a fiery and strong as Guv'nor Pappy O'Daniel,  as are Chris Thomas King and The Practice's Michael Badalucco.  Wayne Duvall is very good as the rival Homer Stokes.  The really wonderful part of this movie is the music.  In a way,  this comedy is somewhat like a musical,  the music carrying the men from one place to another,  and I especially love the scenes in which the three men and their accomp..uhh,  accompanist(It's a joke from the movie,  see it,  and you'll get it) Tommy roll into &quot;Man of Constant Sorrow.&quot;  An awesome Coen Brothers Flick!
0805209999|5.0|Not until 1982 had I formed a clear idea for the meaning of the term &Ograve;kafkaesque.&Oacute; The revelation came when I found myself trapped in the middle of Prague, KafkaÕs hometown, on a crossroad that received one way lanes from every direction. It was real and surreal and frightening and comical, but nothing dreamy about it. I knew, if I tried to get myself out of this situation, there would inevitably be a very real cop just waiting to give me a very real ticket,. And he did. He was drunk and rather shabbily uniformed.  For many years in my early teens, I had KafkaÕs ÔTrialÕ on my bedside table. If you want to learn German, this is the book for you. It comes in simple and straightforward language. Kafka was a great admirer of Flaubert and his maxim to tell extraordinary things in ordinary language. So whatever KafkaÕs translators may say, Kafka does not exactly pose a linguistic challenge. Still there are differences. The Muirs' translation, prior to MitchellÕs, is still a respectable piece of late Victorian imitation furniture. But Mitchell does improve, no doubt. However the actual order of the chapters in this unfinished novel is still open to questions -- MitchellÕs editors chose to be conservative. As it stands, the &Ograve;Trial&Oacute; is a great step forward from KafkaÕs first novel ÔAmerica!Õ which was written under the influence of Oliver Twist. It has many scenes of burning intensity and a sensual quality, Kafka himself never matched again. However the American backdrop is cut from cardboard and not very convincing. Kafka always had a problem to convey a sense of locality if it wasnÕt his hometown. Any reader of KafkaÕs &Ograve;Castle&Oacute; faces the same problem, the interiors come to life vividly enough, but the geography is curiously vague. The &Ograve;TrialÕs&Oacute; setting is Prague, and it shows.  This is perhaps KafkaÕs most guilt-stricken story. From scene to scene the shadows thicken until Joseph K.Õs providential encounter in the mystical bleakness of the Cathedral. I refuse to speculate on the meaning in all of this, however I would advise against fetching too far for an interpretation. The language is straightforward but still loaded with little pointers and puns. For instance: the protagonist (Joseph K.) has a crush on a certain Miss ÔBrstner.Õ This name is derived from the verb &Ograve;brsten&Oacute; Ð German for &Ograve;brushing,&Oacute; which in German is also a vulgar euphemism for sexual intercourse; and this is no coincidence. There is sex all over the place: the protagonist has an affair with his attorneyÕs maid, shabbily dressed judges simply carry away women into their chambers, during Joseph KÕs conversation with the painter, you hear the painterÕs models giggle in the background.  Notice the running parallel between illicit sex and dingy justice. The Viennese critic Karl Kraus had published a series of essays under the title &Ograve;The Chinese Wall.&Oacute; In it Kraus attacked AustriaÕs legal system and spoke up in defence of prostitutes. Kafka knew Kraus, he attended his public readings, and he might have picked up on a phrase Kraus liked to scream at his audience. It began with: &Ograve;Because justice is a whore ... ,&Oacute; (which no doubt it is.) In KafkaÕs novel the courts convene in the strangest places, in attics and lofts, under the rafters of top floors, in sub-tenancies of housing projects. This strange judicial system never allows to approach the upper echelons, but the lower charges are beggarly and sly. The whole state seems to be afflicted by an underground conspiracy, and you never know whether your friendly janitor isnÕt one of them. If it were ancient Rome, you could say the slaves are judging their masters.  Joseph K. himself is a somewhat aloof and haughty character, not un-typical for a senior manager. K. works for a bank and he is a sharp dresser and moves with ease in circles of attorneys, chief administrators and CEOs. Kafka lifted out of the text the key-parable, &Ograve;Before the Law&Oacute; and published it separately in a collection of shorter pieces. It is difficult to put your finger exactly on the meaning of this famous parable, but it certainly gives the entire novel in a nutshell. In the era of Stalin and McCarthy and after the horrors of the death-camps it has became fashionable to read into KafkaÕs novel a brooding indictment against oppression and persecution. I am not so sure: itÕs a tough call, because he is never told the charges, yet something seems to be expected of Joseph K., a change of heart perhaps, or a sign of redeeming humility, but K. remains unchanged, his ordeal merely infuses an ever more deepening gloom. One of the great paradigms of modern literature.cult to put your finger exactly on the meaning of this famous parable, but it certainly gives the entire novel in a nutshell.

B000058T5E|5.0|I had it coming   <br />What a superb album this is!!! I must admit that I have not bought a Jeff Beck album since 1989 when guitar shop came out, I am so impressed that I have nearly worn it out on on the first day, guitar albums of this quality are very hard to find these days and I must hand it to Jeff that he really works hard on getting the best sounds. Recently guitarist Joe Satriani delved more into the electronic drum machine style of music with 'Engines of Creation' but nowhere near as good as this, this is a blinder, with openeing tracks like Earthquake, and Roy's Toys - SUPERB!! and then the absolutely terrific Rosebud, when I heard this it made my hair stand on end, All I can say is if you havn't got it and you like good rhythms as well as superbly executed toung twisting guitar notes, go buy it now.
B000051VWW|1.0|Like millions os Sade fans, I eagerly awaited the arrival of Lovers Rock. I expected something familiar. I've seen Sade in concert, and loved her and the band.. Lovers Rock seems to be missing something. With artists I like, I always look for the positive elements. This disc is a snoozer-bland, blah, no groove, no  punch, no inspiration. I would have settled for a few tracks with  &quot;any&quot; beat. It appears that this disc is not very radio friendly. Whenever I hear Sade on the radio, her more upbeat music is mostly played. Maybe it was just my expectation, but I'd prefer to take a nap.
B0000026KQ|4.0|I agree with the other reviewers that say this album is bit overproduced...and it is...but it's still a good album, worthy of 4 stars. Savoy, Big Block, Where Were You are great tracks--Where Were You is the standout. A Day In the House is a little weird at first, but you get used to it. However, the tracks Guitar Shop and A Day in the House would've been better if they didn't have Terry's voice in them. Two Rivers is an excellent song to relax to. Behind the Veil is an awesome song too, it's a bit oriental. However, Sling Shot and Stand on It are duds. That may be a strong word, &quot;dud,&quot; but they just don't stand up to the rest of the album. <br />As for Jeff's soloing, it's great as usual, but a bit polished. I know he can get massive tones live, so why have to polish them in the studio? They're a little too slick. <br />Getting past the polish-ness and overproduction, the musicianship on the album is very good. Terry is an excellent drummer, but sometimes I think he gets a little too busy. However, I like him better then Simon Phillips or Cozy Powell. Hymas' keyboard work compliments Jeff's playing well...the thing I like about Tony is that he's a keyboard player, so he plays like he's a keyboard player. With Jan Hammer, I tend to think he wants to be a guitar player but plays keyboards, and Jan stepped over Jeff too much. Tony's playing is nice, though, especially on Two Rivers and Behind the Veil. The one beef I have with the musicians is there is no bass player. Tony does an average job of patching in the bass parts through his keyboards, but a real bass player would've been nice. <br />Overall, I give the album four stars. If you want an album that has the feeling and spirit of this, yet the playing that makes Jeff Beck the best and is a bit more raw, get You Had It Coming instead. However, Guitar Shop isn't a bad buy, and it'll be a good part to your collection.
0525945636|2.0|I gave this 2 stars only because I expected more from Follett. The dialogue was sophomoric, the action was inconsistent (why would Anthony only erase Luke's memory instead of killing him as he did with other friends), and the development of characters was not up to Follett's usual fare. After reading &quot;The Pillars of the Earth&quot;, which I thought was one of the better books I've read,this one was disappointing.
B000002KHH|5.0|THE BEST METAL ALBUM OF ALL TIME. No band can match the power of Black Sabbath, or any of their songs for that matter. &quot;War pigs&quot; Classic. &quot;Paranoid&quot; classic. &quot;Iron Man&quot; F^%king Classic! Even the songs that aren't that well known are true classics. Tony Iommi's guitar playing still amazes me (Rat Salad is a good example). Black Sabbath are the kings of metal. ROCK ON!
B00000IAU3|5.0|WOW!  Her deep lyrics...her sweet voice...her songs teeming with truth...her spiritual magic...her piercing artistic vision...The album by Dido is one meant to own.  He beautiful voice and style is touching and beautiful with the mystical HERE WITH ME and the empowering HUNTER.  ALL YOU WANT is teeming with heartache and beauty. SLIDE is hopeful.  ISOBEL is deep.  And Dido's NO ANGEL Album has one word to describe it...MASTERPIECE.  A BEWITCHING ARTIST CASTING HER SPELL! Beautiful!
B000002JPA|5.0|Dream Theater really shows their talent. LITERALLY. How many styles can you hear on this album? Metal, jazz, classical, blues, and prog-rock combined to make an hour of talent. John Petrucci blazes through his solos to show incredible perfection. John Myung plays funk bass and does a few tricks on some songs. Their singer is a lot better than that other 30-year-old-looking dude. He was good, but James is a lot better. Kevin Moore really does some good keyboarding, and even wrote the perfect piano-ballad &quot;Wait for Sleep.&quot; Mike Portnoy's drumming is just excellent, but not near as good as Neil Peart or John Bonham.(the two masters). Perhaps the nost known songs are the long 8 minute songs on this album. &quot;Metropolis&quot; is their most known song, and everyone in the crowd sings along to the 11 minute &quot;Learning to Live.&quot; Perfection of music. JOHN RULES!
6300247120|5.0|I am one of the fortunate ones who have had the pleasure of viewing this movie many many times and also being there when it was filmed.  I attended the university while they were filming this movie and had the opportunity to be an extra in a few shots.  It still remains my favorite movie because of the well balanced characters and the pace of the story.  I still cheer for the cutters to win every time I see the movie.  A real gem.
0833509454|5.0|I had tried to read &quot;It&quot; twice before I was able to get into it. The first time, I was browsing in a bookshop, and I read the first chapter &quot;After the Flood&quot;. It was raining that night and I couldn't sleep. I was around 14 at that time and really scared. Tried again a couple years later, made it through the second chapter- &quot;After the Festival&quot;. It was not as scary as the first chapter and I gave up on the book, preferring Robert Ludlum's italics. Then, I read it again. Started from the beginning. Made it through the first couple of chapters fairly quickly. Half way through &quot;Stanley Uris Takes a Bath&quot; I had some doubts- couldn't figure out where the book was going. But I kept on. I read that book- all thousand plus pages in around 2 days. I missed classes, missed meals, didn't sleep- you know how it goes sometimes. For me, the book was only about friendship. About being young, about believing, about what you did after school, how it felt to be with friends, how it was to play games and watch movies together, what they meant to you and you to them... As for the horror- there is horror, there is enough stuff there to churn your stomach- there is the murderous clown, there is the werewolf, there is a diseased tramp, strange creatures that come from the river with needle teeth and eat kids alive- but there are also horrors like the school bully and the neighbour who walks away from a rape that is about to happen in front of him. But the horror is - atleast to me, like wallpaper- the background- to a beautiful story of friendship, childhood and imagination. I love this book- I've read it so often and I still go back to it when I am bored. Check the book out. If you like it, you'll love it. If not, its probably because you didnt get through the first three chapters.
B00005AXEL|4.0|I've been a fan of the Nicks/Buckhingham/McVie incarnation of Fleetwood Mac since the 70's as a 10 year old child when I heard &quot;Dreams&quot; for the first time over the intercom while playing in the backyard.  The voice enchanted me like it has all of Stevie's fans.  Yet I was disappointed overall with the Street Angel and Rock A Little albums (so I'm able to be unbiased).<br />This album though is so good and along with the enjoyment of the music in it comes the satisfaction of hearing Stevie hitting on all cylinders and sounding better than she has sounded in a long time.  This only heightens my desire for the next Fleetwood Mac album due sometime next year (apparently Christine McVie won't be involved so there should be more room for Stevie songs).
B000002H70|5.0|i believe this is THE masterpiece the cure will be remembered by, nothing in their incredible 25 years comes close, which is saying alot as each album they've released since the late 70's [!!!] have been very very good- simply genius- this record towers over even the timeless &quot;pornography&quot; , &quot;faith&quot; &quot;head on the door&quot; and &quot;wish&quot; releases- the essense of the cure were captured on these twelve songs...this is the record all prospective cure fans should hear first
B00000DGUG|5.0|The progression Alanis shows with this album is amazing. The songs are lovely and full of so much deeper meaning than Jagged Little Pill. More than one of the songs on this album touched me so deeply that it brought tears to my eyes...It's a great CD.
B000000OQY|5.0|GNR Lies comprises of 4 live tracks and 4 studio tracks.  The first half contains the classic [in my opinion] Move to the City with tops tongue in cheek openers Reckless Life and Nice Boys.  I've gotta say the cover of Aerosmith's Mama Kin rules!  It's a hard rocking track that just sounds so good [mainly down to Slash - he rules!] Now, the 4 studio tracks... Patience has to be one of my all time favorite GN'R tracks after Sweet Child n' November Rain.  It has to be the best track on the album.  A ballad that sounds better everytime you listen. The next song, Used to Love Her is another classic in my eyes, a ditty about Axl killing his girlfriend.  The acoustic version of You're Crazy is up next and that's just fantastic, a slowed down version from the one on Appetite just fits in nicely.  One in a Million ends the CD in fine style, don't get too offended though, Axl get's on his soapbox and pretty much lays into anything.  Another great acoustic number. All in all, another Classic from GN'R.  Buy it
0792151712|4.0|Generally speaking, I'm not a big romance fan. But this movie was one of the greatest movies of the 90s. For those of you who follow my writing, you know that I abhor (for the most part) Action movies. I am not against violence that has a purpose or is required to tell the story. But I have nothing but contempt for violence when it is used for entertainment. One action movie in particular (which is the object of my soul's hate) turned killing into a joke, took punch shots at people who were a little different, totally distorted history, and pretty much turned a conscience free mass of killing into a big joke. Well, \\"The Titanic\\" was a nice dose of reality. Not only does it have historical value, but it allows us to meet several people, and it shows us the true horror of people dying. People getting killed should not be a joke, and it should not be used for entertainment. And certainly the ridicule of different people should not be used for entertainment. (MG would do better to keep his bigotries to himself.) Well, that said, Jack could probably have acted a little better. But he performs his role at least moderately well. Rose is touching in the sorrows she is burdened with, and we may be able to feel her anxieties, and struggle along with her as she makes decisions that will permanently affect her. Molly Brown is really likable in her rough but compassionate role. Calvin may be close to psychotic, but he does carry charm now and then. We certainly won't route for Lovejoy, but there is something to be said for his loyalty to his employer. Thomas Andrews is especially well done. He is a very likable character who carries a voice of reason, and shows a memorable sense of honor and integrity. I could go on and on about the wonderful acting, but there is no need for that. The costumes are beautiful; the scenery is beautiful; the historical characters march along nicely with the fictional characters. I know some people question if the romance plot was required. In my opinion it was. You are free to disagree with me, but the way I see it is that anytime you have a great story, you need some central focus. Moving on, the music is also very well done. Overall, this movie has great scenery, wonderful acting, nice music, a strong story, touching characters, historical value, and a high sense of morality. Along with \\"My Best Friend's Wedding,\\" \\"Everafter,\\" and \\"Sleeping With the Enemy,\\" this movie is an absolute gotta have!
B00000AFFF|3.0|Being a long-time Costello fan, and no stranger to Bacharach, I looked forward to finally hearing their much-vaunted collaboration.  I hate to say that I was disappointed.  There are works here of stunning breadth and beauty (God Give Me Strength, This House Is Empty Now), as well as some catchy cleverness (Toledo, Long Division), but I was disappointed.  I think the main fault of this record lies is Bacharach's arrangements of these songs.  He doesn't seem to have strayed from his trademark sound from his early 70's recordings.  Costello's performance comes off as mannered, revealing very little of the passion that marks his best vocal performances (rockers aside, think &quot;Sattelite&quot; or &quot;Alison&quot;).  Costello ran into a similar problem long ago during the &quot;Almost Blue&quot; sessions with Billy Sherrill.  I would have hoped that Costello would push Bacharach into something more innovative, even while fitting into the Bacharach &quot;sound.&quot;<br />Nothing against either of these great talents, but a successful collaboration should be more than the sum of its parts, not just the two of them sitting comfortably on the sofa.<br />I was, I repeat, disappointed.
0916990427|5.0|You don't need high-powered jets to crash through time zones. Knowing how to use your brain through &quot;Time-line&quot; does it.  Foreword by Tad James and Preface by Wyatt Woodsmall.  These two co-authored &quot;Time-line Therapy and the Basis of Personality&quot; in 1988.  Bodenhamer and Hall again successfully synthesize and transform traditional NLP (Neuro-linguistic Programming) materials and bring them to new frontiers of understanding and applications.  The ways we code and experience &quot;time&quot; have close connections with our personalities, our thoughts and feelings, states and experiences, beliefs and values, sense of reality and self.  Cultures also differ in their sense of time.  The book gives an in-depth exploration.  We learn how to elicit time-lines and use them to get unstuck from old dated emotions: guilt, grief, fear, anxiety, trauma and abuse... We can also use &quot;Time&quot; as a resource for creating a bright and compelling future, a &quot;life well lived&quot; (borrowed from Benjamin Franklin). Time is not a thing.  We don't manage time, but only ourselves... There is also more advanced material.  Background in NLP is helpful.  [The author's new book, a complete manual for the NLP Practitioner Certification, &quot;The User's Manual for the Brain&quot; includes the introductory section of the present book as the last chapter.] Many chapters are worth repeated study.  You'll appreciate the authors' creative uses of NLP, language and &quot;Time-lines&quot;.  [The book is written in E-prime, without the verb, to be.]
B00004ZB9D|5.0|Well I would consider myself a master of rock and blues music. I play keyboard, guitar, bass, and some drums. Considering I play some of the hardest Yes keyboards, Hendrix solos on guitar, and Chris Squire on bass, I consider myself a master in instruments. Second, I have written several songs including some that have made people cry, and some that &quot;get me singing along everytime I hear it&quot; and &quot;It's been dangling in my head for weeks&quot; are other quotes to prove my qualifications. I know I seem like I'm bragging, but I simply must tell you this to explain why I rank this album a five star. (This is rare for me). I think his wizardry with his guitar is brilliant. His soul blows me away. These songs are his greatest hits. As we all know, the greatest hits are usually not as good as some others. My first time to hear a good band in years. I think his &quot;Are you gonna go my way&quot; has a glowing Hendrix sound. His remaking the Guess Who's &quot;American Woman&quot; shows he understands music. Bands like Blink182 and rappers have truly no talent. I understand that early 70's and mid and late 60's is the best music in the world. It's bands like KISS and VanHalen and Guns N' Roses that ruined the music world. It died when Vietnam ended. Yoko broke up the Beatles. But this man has the style, soul, and talent to become a band I like. I like art rock and hard rock. I define music differently from most people. Fifties pop ranks heavy metal in my categories. I have three for rock. Art Rock includes bands like the Beatles, Yes, Rush, Uriah Heep, Pink Floyd, Deep Purple, the Who, Alice Cooper, Grand Funk Railroad, etc. These bands have tremendous ability in both the way they play and write. Songs this complicated proves what the best is. Keyboards stand out, Bass doesn't just have patterns, same for drums, guitar has more than just chord hitting. There is also hard rock, which is less complicated than art rock, but commonly includes bands also in the art rock category. It's not the common stuff. It's like Led Zepplin, Deep Purple, Beatles, Grand Funk Railroad, Alice Cooper, the Who, Jimi Hendrix, Ted Nugent, Steppenwolf, Three Dog Night, Queen, and others like that. It's songs have sometimes chord hitting with a lead. Or a guitar riff constant, with better bass, keyboards, slightly better drums. This is still a lot harder than heavy metal. Heavy metal includes lots of pop from times. It includes lots of 60's, late 70's, 50's, 80's, and 90's. It also includes the 90's &quot;country&quot;. Bands like Elvis, VanHalen, Guns N' Roses, Herman's Hermits, blink182, other stuff like that. This is music that has a similar riff through the whole song with an intro (sometimes the main riff), verses, chorus, and solos. Keyboards are hidden in the modern ones. Piano is shown some in old ones. Bass is patterned and extremely simple. Drums are the same as bass. Guitar is mainly chord hitting or a main riff. Possibly a lead. Lenny Ranks Hard Rock/art rock. He has some songs worthy of art rock but he's mostly hard rock. This means he is a truely gifted gentleman. Anyone ranking art rock is a music prodigy. This makes him almost one. A few more years in the business and yes. His Hendrix-like style ranks him real high with me. This makes two bands I enjoy that are popular in the 90's and beyond. Trans-Siberian Orchestra ranks as the other one. Listen to this band. If you like Lenny, you will like them. They are a brilliant band. Ranking with Yes and Rush.
0385484518|5.0|I spent the better part of last year recovering from a Stage 4 cancerous tumor in my mouth and struggled through that period trying to figure out what I was experiencing.  A friend sent me this book, and I did NOT read it until after I had undergone Lymph Node removal surgery.  This book helped me put my personal medical experiences and possibility of dying into perspective and appreciate the living I've done.  I did not think that I would ever be able to say that I treasured the negative things I experienced in living my life, but now I can sincerely say that those experiences were beneficial in helping me face my impending death; thanks to &quot;Tuesday's with Morrie&quot;.
014028009X|5.0|I didn't know what to expect when a dear friend had recommended this book to me.  I purchased it and started reading it but put it down.  It took me about 3 weeks to pick it up again due to a hectic schedule.  Once I got past the Diamond Sweater and the bumble socks I was hooked.  After finishing the book in one night I had to have another fix so I bought the sequel.<br />I have thoroughly enjoyed the writing of Helen Fielding.  She has managed to capture the essence of being single.  I haven't seen the movie yet, however, hopefully tomorrow evening I'll be watching it and laughing my head off.<br />I hope that there will be more written on dear Bridget and her friends in the future.  Hint, hint, HELEN!<br />Thank you for an enjoyable tale of Singletons!
B000059Z8J|4.0|The restoration process was sublime and the sound effects were outstanding! BUT.... These are a few scenes that should have been in the out takes section. These is a scene where Superman tries to stop a missle in mid flight. He stops and is floating in the sky. The Missle goes around Superman! This scene was included in the ABC broadcast in 1980.. The other scene was when Superman rescued Jimmy off the dam. He pauses in the air to tell Jimmy to snap some shots of the dam.. He tells him to &quot;Go ahead... Shoot. Both of these scenes were in the broadcast of this film on ABC in 1980.<br />I would like to have seen the ORIGINAL Making Of film too. Other then these mistakes, it is still a keeper...
B0000029DD|5.0|Whatever your opinion of Jeff Buckley, you cannot deny that the man had a natural gift with his musical talent. Grace, his only official album, released 3 years prior to his tragic death, blends a number of differant flavours brilliantly, yes, it may not be to some peoples tastes, but to most people who have heard this record they will find their own meanings within it. A fantastic album.
B000002MUW|5.0|For awhile I wasn't very interested in Madonna's earlier albums, before she ventured off into electronica music. I guess after listening to &quot;The Immaculate Collection&quot; I felt compelled to check out her other albums, and the first cd I picked up was &quot;Bedtime Stories&quot;.<br />Here on &quot;Bedtime Stories&quot; we get a brief glimpse of what to come with &quot;Bedtime Story&quot; a riveting techno-influenced tracked produced by Nellee Hooper who has worked with Bjork in the past. In fact, the writing credits Bjork is listed as one of the writers of the song. &quot;Bedtime Story&quot; is perhaps my favorite track off this cd, next to the more r&amp;b influenced &quot;Inside of Me&quot;. I never was fond of the remix of the track &quot;Secret&quot; but the original version I do like. With Babyface and Dallas Austin as two of the producers of this album, &quot;Bedtime Stories&quot; has a overall r&amp;b feel (with the exception of &quot;Bedtime Story&quot; of course). Yet another compelling album from Madonna.
B000056PWV|5.0|&quot;Rear Window&quot; is a masterpiece of filmmaking art and one of Alfred Hitchcock's best movies. It shows Hitchcock at his best in two different aspects of making movies. One is the technical aspect. The use of lighting, perspective, and the way that details and events are portrayed visually. The second is the aspect of storytelling. The way that the story unfolds, building tension and suspense at a deliberate pace as the plot transitions from humorous looks at newlyweds and a woman who lets her little dog out by lowering him to the ground in a basket, to the question of a possible murder. Hitchcock excells at both aspects of his craft, and he demonstrates his skill brilliantly in &quot;Rear Window&quot;.<br />The story involves a professional photograher (played by Stewart) who is confined to a wheelchair for several weeks with a broken leg. Bored, he spends his time observing the lives of his neighbors whose apartments border the same courtyard as his. Hot summer weather guarantees lots of open windows. Things get serious when it begins to appear that the man across the courtyard has murdered his nagging wife. As other reviewers here have pointed out, this tale works on many different levels. But, whether you view it as a morality play about voyeurism or a psychological examination of commitment issues, the bottom line is that it is one of the best suspense movies you'll ever see. I'd give it six stars if I could. It gets my very highest recommendation.
6302642175|5.0|If I could choose one word to describe &quot;Tron&quot;, I would have to say &quot;awesome&quot;.  This movie has it all: exceptional special effects (particularly for its time), an excellent musical score by composer Wendy Carlos and 2 very cool songs by Journey (&quot;Only Solutions&quot; &amp; &quot;1990's Theme&quot;), above average acting by a very likeable cast including Jeff Bridges, Bruce Boxleitner &amp; David Warner, as well as a very well-written &amp; interesting storyline.<br />If you're a fan of the old Atari video games from the late '70s and early '80s, as I am, you're in for a real treat.  You'll feel as though you're actually living inside one of those old games as you follow Tron, Flynn &amp; and the rest of their &quot;computerized&quot; companions on their mission to overthrow the evil leader, Sark, and the power-hungry Master Control Program.<br />Again, I must say that this truly is one of the best films I've ever seen.  As far as sci-fi/fantasy films go, I'd have to rank this one right up there with &quot;Star Wars&quot; and any other fine film of the genre.<br />As with any fine wine, &quot;Tron&quot; is one of those increasingly rare films that only improves with age.  If you haven't seen this one yet, make it a point to do so in the near future.  You really are missing out if you don't.  I'd also like to recommend that you see &quot;The Black Hole&quot; (1979) &amp; &quot;Condorman&quot; (1981), also great sci-fi/fantasy films made by Disney.  And don't forget Disney's epic fantasy adventure &quot;20,000 Leagues Under the sea&quot; (1954).<br />As for the long term fans of &quot;Tron&quot;, it might interest you to know that a sequel is currently in the pre-planning stages, with Steven Lisberger to again write and direct.  If anybody has any up-to-date info on the subject of the sequel, please e-mail me (my address is listed here).  Thanks.<br />END OF LINE.

0679731725|3.0|Maybe it was because I'm only fourteen, but I had a lot of trouble with this book.  Ishiguro writes very verbosely, and goes off on too many tangents to count.  But it is the tangents that are truly the story, and not what actually happens in terms of the road trip Stevens takes.  In the story, Stevens is given tume off from his job as a butler for the first time in his life.  He uses the time he drives to check out the countryside recommended in the travelbook, and think about what he has done his entire life as a butler.  He has dedicated his entire life to butlering and has let nothing come between what he has to do, even his father's death.  He mindlessly serves his pro-nazi employer without one thought of the politics Lord Darlington, his employer was into, leaving politics for the Lords and the rich.  He finds that although he has served his master, he has not served himself or anyone else (besides his matsters' guests) at all.  He has overdone the &quot;duties&quot; required of him, at the expense of his life, and that is the point Ishiguro is trying to make. The book is very confusing, which detracts from the message, but if you are prepared to take in all the lengthy descriptions and understand the signifigance of all the little stories, and give this book a chance, you will get something out of it.

0131103628|5.0|Any serious C programmer should own this book. It may not be you first book in C if you have never programmed before (even then I suggest you try to start with this book, it definitely pays off). This book is comprehensive and straight to the point. And very accurate -- you'd be amazed by how many C books out there that are just plain wrong, either because the authors don't know what they are talking about or they bend the concepts to make them more accessible -- always a bad idea.<br />First part of the book is a tutorial-style introduction to the C language. Definitely read each chapter more than once if you are just learning to program. The exercises are excellent, and answers are provided in a separate volume. Even if you solve the problem, still take a look at the answers. You pick up clear and efficient style by looking at good code. Remember some of the subtlties talked about in the book you will not get until you are much more experienced with C.<br />Get this book. It's expensive, but worth it.
B000002LEU|5.0|When I first bought this cd, I loved it, but it left me wanting more, so i bought the Heart and Soul box set and I sold this cd. I felt kinda stupid because I basically lost $ (because i got $ for selling it). I have become a huge fan of Joy Division and own most of their cds, including the bootleg cd, Remains. I only reccomend this to people who are sure they arent going to want  get all JD cds or people who are collectors. Other than that, the Cd is excellent. But, the Cd I reccomend for an introduction is the cd, Still. Because even if you become a big fan of JD (like I did) you will still have a purpose of having it, because of  the rare cover song &quot;Sister Ray&quot; and recordings from their last concert (all of which are not on the Heart and Soul box set).
B0000009TJ|4.0|This is a fun live album... if more than a bit quirky and sporadic.  True, the guitar solos are a bit sparser than your average Zappa album (exactly what is your average zappa album?), but overall I find this to be a highly entertaining listen (particularly disc 1).  Highlights include the opener &quot;Heavy Duty Judy&quot;, &quot;Zomby Woof&quot;, &quot;Inca Roads&quot;, and a highly distinctive and excellent cover of Led Zeppelin's classic &quot;Stairway to Heaven.&quot;  Recommended.
B00004U2HK|4.0|After 30 years, the hills are still alive with the Sound of Music and this movie is as popular as ever. I am not a big fan of musicals, but i know a classic movie when i see one and this is it. Julie Andrews plays her part magnificently and i don't think anyone else could have played it as well as her.
B000002J0B|4.0|Back in 1973, when I was a grad-school student, this was the first Led Zeppelin record that I actually bought.  The song &quot;Stairway to Heaven&quot; was being played rather extensively on top-40 radio at the time (although it was never a single), and I decided to see what all the noise regarding &quot;Zep&quot; was about, so as &quot;Houses of the Holy&quot; was the number one album in the country at the time, I figured &quot;why not?&quot;<br />My initial reaction was mixed. As I was more of a dance music lover at the time, the overall sound of the group seemed plodding, but I quickly realised they were superior musicians, all four of them. (Though Robert Plant took some getting used to!) So how does it sound today, 28 years later? Probably better than it did then!  I understand this type of music is still in heavy rotation today, so, for those into &quot;heavy metal&quot;, why not go to the source?<br />All these tracks work, particularly &quot;The Ocean&quot;, &quot;Song Remains the Same&quot; and &quot;Dancing Days&quot;.  &quot;No Quarter&quot; is a definite change of pace, while &quot;D'yer Mak'er&quot; is more of a concession to dancable top-40 of the era. (Remember, this was one year before disco took off) Taken together, this is a good place for the new Zeppelin listener to begin. It showcases their strengths adequately, and they still sound better than the knockoffs that came after them (AC-DC, Def Leppard, etc.) in the decades to follow.<br />Is it their best album?  Probably not, but for me (not being a big fan) it's as good as any.  None of the others were any more unified.  It's probably better to build your own Zeppelin retrospective from the six LP's from Led Zeppelin (I) thru Physical Graffiti.
B00005JHAB|1.0|The movie is extremely simple and silly. We find this movie an unjustified offense against the Italian people. It is ridiculous to describe Italians with the image of a person rough, without style, with no manner....who is not able to eat pasta! Come on....Italy, among other things, is well known for the elegance, style, and good manners of the people and for high quality fashion &amp; food... The movie does not represent at all the reality of Italy...and you would know this if you knew Italy!. In our opinion, this is pretty unfair and offensive.
B00000016N|5.0|It sure is a pleasure to reminisce, back to a day when we really thought that &quot;all you need is love&quot; and everything would be all right.  Yes, the time between my 14th and 15th birthdays, when Sergeant Pepper was redefining what was musically possible and everyone else was reacting to it. &quot;Light My Fire&quot; indeed!<br />For Jim Morrison and the Doors, it was an unbelievably creative time, as evidenced by the songs on this, their first album. To say there is not a bad track here only begins to communicate the importance of the record. Some at the time called them America's Dionysian counterparts to the Rolling Stones, and that's a good place to start. Let's just say the Doors showed what could happen when &quot;California Dreams&quot; turned into nightmares, as &quot;The End&quot; so aptly describes.<br />The gem here remains &quot;Light My Fire&quot;, every bit as incandescent as when I first heard it all those 34 years ago during the &quot;Summer of Love.&quot;  Of course, we're talking about what we then called the &quot;FM Version&quot; with its soaring keyboard and guitar break in the middle. The album snaps, crackles and pops with the bluesy &quot;Break on Through&quot;, &quot;Back Door Man&quot;, &quot;Take It as It Comes&quot;, and such fine rock standards as &quot;Alabama Song&quot;, &quot;Twentieth Century Fox&quot; and &quot;Soul Kitchen&quot;.  Another favorite of mine is the softer &quot;Crystal Ship&quot;, and of course, &quot;The End&quot;, which later gained new fame from its appearance in the film &quot;Apocolypse Now&quot; (a particularly poignant use of the song I might add).<br />Another reviewer called this one of the four or five best rock albums of the 1960's. (I'm inclined to agree with that, but completing that list is a difficult chore indeed!)  Simply put,  Morrison's later death in 1971 would rob the music world of perhaps many other great works to come. For the Doors, only L.A. Woman rivaled this one creatively.
B000002UAX|5.0|As is well known to some, if not most, the Beatles are one of the greatest and more influential bands of all time.  They ushered in an era of psychedelia with Sgt. Peppers, an era that spawned some of the best music of all time.  The White Album, as is commonly refferred to is there masterpiece.  It is the Beatles most avant garde work of all, before they returned to generally pop the way only the Beatles can do it in Abbey Road.  It shows the differing directions of the band, McCartney leaning towards pop(Bungalow Bill), Lennon towards brutal confessionals (Dear Prudence), and Harrison immersed in the eastern state of mind.  The album contains some of the most brilliant and occaisionally haunting  works of music of all time (while my guitar gently weeps, and Revolution 9) while maintaining a playful side with Birthday, Everybody's got something to hide and Ob la di ob la da.  The soft acoustic driven songs are brilliant and beautiful, Blackbird and Mother Nature's Son.  All in all the white album takes you on the ride of your life and doesn't let go until McCartney's meloncholly Good Night.   This is truly an amzing album.
B0000021RB|5.0|I came to Chicago (as they were later known) in 1970, with the songs from their second album, in particular &quot;Make Me Smile&quot;. In the following year, other songs I liked came out, &quot;...What Time It Is&quot;, and &quot;Beginnings&quot;, and I was surprised to learn that these were not on their new album at the time, Chicago III, but on their album which had been originally released way back in 1969.  Intrigued, I picked up that double-disc set, and was soon blown away by the creativity and musical excellence of the group. Unfortunately, it was a creativity they unable to ever duplicate again, certainly not after the death of guitarist Terry Kath in 1978. The second album, &quot;Chicago&quot;, come close, however.<br />But here we find a raw, uncomplicated sound, one that was quite revolutionary at the time. Here was a band using a horn section, but doing it in a way that really fit with rock 'n' roll, much better than Blood, Sweat and Tears was trying to do at the same time. I seriously think Chicago probably opened the door for other groups to successfully use this approach, notably Earth, Wind and Fire and Tower of Power later in the 70's.<br />Other reviewers here have listed the best tracks, and I'll list my faves: &quot;Introduction&quot;, &quot;Listen&quot;, &quot;I'm a Man&quot; (I agree, better than Spencer Davis Group's version), &quot;Someday&quot; and &quot;Does Anybody Really Know What Time It Is?&quot; (an interesting philosophical ramble, especially to me, a college student at the time). There are some throw-away moments, to be sure (do we really need almost 7 minutes of &quot;Free Form Guitar&quot;, an obvious Hendrix tribute, plus &quot;Liberation&quot; is overly long), but they were trying to fill a double album. Not a good excuse, I realize, but there is more than enough good stuff to go on one disc. Today in the CD era, that seems quite difficult to relate to, I suppose, because the whole 2-record set is on one CD.  Still, it's a greatprice!<br />Chicago never scaled these creative heights again, a pity, really. But for a while (1971-75) they were America's most consistent hit-makers, going to number one with every album they released (and top ten with every single). &quot;Chicago Transit Authority&quot; shows us the birth of that staple Seventies radio sound.
B00005AXEL|5.0|Stevie Nicks has always been a mystical force to be reckoned with in the Rock Industry. <br />Her lyrics are poignant, introspective, and interladen with mysticism; Her voice strong, defiant, independant, soothing and at the same time lulling. <br />The years have seen many of Nicks' multiple facets. Whether it be with Fleetwood Mac or her own incredibly successful solo career...Nicks' words have always held special meaning in the hearts of her captivated audience. <br />And there are many songs within the confines of Nicks' 7th studio album that are destined to become classics. <br />From the rolling, rocking thunder of the albums opener and title track, &quot;Trouble In Shangri-La,&quot; to the carribbean-esque, &quot;Bombay Sapphires,&quot; The introspectful Nicks provides her fans with the same enchanting lyrical melodies that have become her signature trademark throughout the years.<br />On this her best album since 1981's &quot;Bella Donna&quot; (#1, 4 wks.), Nicks enlists the talents of the most respected voice in women's music today. Sheryl Crow, a longtime friend of Nicks who co-writes and holds production credits on 5 tracks is also found playing guitar and bass and adding her vocal harmonies to 3 of the albums' tracks.<br />Macy Gray gives a stellar performance alongside Nicks in the image-laden, Bombay Sapphires; While Dixie Chick, Natalie Maines croons along with Nicks on the country-rocker, &quot;Too Far From Texas.&quot;<br />Sarah McLachlan also lends her hand and voice to the album offering up her pianist expertise and haunting vocals to the albums closing track, &quot;Love Is.&quot; As well as contributing vocals, McLachlan also designed the albums logo.<br />While remaining both true to self and form, Nicks offers up her legions of fans an album of 13 tracks that offers a little bit of something for everyone. Albeit, not without a little help from her friends. 06MAY01
0783226063|5.0|&amp;#65279;In defense of Lynch's muddled masterpiece, I argue that it is ultimately faithful to Herbert's vision.  For one thing, no less than the author, Frank Herbert himself, acted as consultant to the film, and Lynch took the trouble to actually film out in a real desert. The visual images are definitive and supportive of many of the concepts of Herbert's novel.  For example, Lynch's Geidi Prime is a gritty industrial facility, visually conveying how the Harkonnens ruthlessly wring all economic value out of both the planets and people they control, just as they have tried to wrench as much spice as possible, legally and illegally, out of Arrakis. <br />Lynch prefaces our first view of Baron Harkonnen, by showing us the twisted mentat, DeVries,(the real brains behind behind the baron's plans to become emperor) commuting in, nervously (he's as disposable as any Harkonnen minion, and knows it) taking a quick slug of his sapho juice brain booster (an explanation of the \\"red stained lips\\"), before presenting the baron with the message tube we earlier saw Leto seal with the ducal signet ring back on Caladan, during a foreboding storm.  The volatile baron is in the middle of getting his repulsive pustules treated by a fawning doctor (accurate, as I recall, to the book), while surgically mutilated workers stand mutely by.  The obscene heart plugs and mutilated flunkies convey graphically, the technically loathsome and unconstrained exploitation exercised by the Harkonnens. The shocking image of the \\"heart plug\\" is a metaphor for the dehumanizing way the Harkonnens, as ABSOLUTE rulers view and use their people: people exist merely to suit their (not necessarily rational) whims which are unrestrained by any compassion, let alone moral law.  When it suits the baron, he pulls the plug on any slave....literally, and the anti-gravity suit he wears is not only accurate to the book, but also visually conveys the no limits, out of control power lust of the character. <br />TheBene Gesserit sisterhood has been meddling in human affairs and manipulating bloodlines of the various houses, behind the scenes, for centuries, but it is ambiguous as to whether they are good or evil, progressive or reactionary, in Herbert's novel.  The somber, nun-like, bald, women mystics of Lynch's film, who double as `impartial' \\"truth-sayers,\\" as Reverend Mother Mohaim is for the emperor in one of the earliest scenes of the Lynch film, exemplify the religious adage, that `you cannot serve two masters,' and suggests the byzantine maneuverings they exercise behind all the events to come, which will eventually careen out of their control.<br />I felt that Kyle MacLachlan's young Paul was problematic, but that he improved during the course of the film.  Jurgan Prochow was regal as the doomed charismatic Duke Leto, and we can sense the coming tragedy, as he and Jessica leave Caladan visually looking much like the Tsar Nicolas and Tsarina Alexandra of Russia, going off to be shot by the Bolsheviks.  In the Lynch film, you also see the Suk doctor Yueh's mark of imperial conditioning, and the tragedy of his pitiable position as pawn of the Harkonnens, forced to betray the duke he serves.   The royal planetologist Keynes, played by Max Von Sydow, perfectly conveys the scholarly recluse who has gone native as portrayed in Herbert's novel.  The still suits of the Lynch movie have an authentic crafted look. The baroque look of the huge galactic transports and throne room on Kaitain, had a decadent and futuristic feel unlike anything I have ever seen, and I felt that they perfectly suggested an advanced society that once fought a war over \\"thinking machines,\\" and now is uneasy with its technology.  The zombie like guild members who must use a translating speaker to communicate because they are in one of the lesser stages of drug induced mutation, was also feels very true to Herbert's navigator's guild.  The ornithopters where great on the inside, put poorly realized on theoutside.   It's too bad Lynch was not allowed to expand his movie. Herbert's book is full of intriguing and unsettling concepts and opposites, begging for explanation: &quot;zen-suni&quot; and &quot;orange-catholic&quot; religions; the political troika  between 3 uneasy and very different groups with very different goals,  not to mention a whole society totally dependant on and obsessed with, a mysterious drug, melange, that oddly, no one really knows much about; the mixture of  mysticism, industrial technology and a ludite like fear of &quot;thinking machines&quot;; ruthless economical exploitation vs. a harsh ecology; planetary rulers running the gamut between patriarchical monarchy (Atreides) and ruthless, utterly selfish despotism (Haarkonens)-- with no trace of our much glorified democracy anywhere in sight; and complex personalities we want to know more about. In some ways, it may be futile to attempt to film such a complex novel, but Lynch made a decidedly powerful effort, hampered by lack of time to really develop the story.
B000002U8G|5.0|Fantastic ! No words to say about this album... Many of 70's rock lovers will dislike this pearl, but Floyd's real fans simply love it ! After the great and genious Atom Heart Mother, Floyd made one of his finest works. Acoustic Guitars, Organ and Gilmour's precise solos mixed with a lot of pos-psychodelia ideas. Everything from Floyd's &quot;first&quot; phase are present in Meddle.  One of These Days, the first track,  is a Bass-Distortion-Spacial-Noise-Trip, a very dense and hard track for 71, great idea, creating an intense sounding tunnel to some strange and apocalyptic land ! After this &quot;brain ... &quot;, Gilmour and Waters show us Pillow of Winds, a beautiful melody, with Ac. Guitars and a soft keyboard. A gentle lyric, very lovely. Fearless, the third track, is another acoustic track, with another interesting lyric. Nice melody, with a soccer team fan's chorus at the end. Not as good as Pillow, but great track. Saint Tropez changes the direction of the tracks: A jazz, blues, 50's rythm, with Waters on vocals. Very simple, well done and funny. Seamus is the &quot;experimental&quot; track of this album. A typical american south blues, with a fantastic Gilmour's slide guitar and a lot of dogs barking without stop. A little bit psychodelic, strange, but funny like Saint Tropez.  This side A, with 5 tracks, show us pure Floyd's vocals, with Gilmour starting leading Floyd's harmonies. But here, B side, is the great moment of the album: Echoes ! An incredible 23 mins track with all Floyd's greatest  attributes: Beatufiul vocals (Gilmour and Wright in a perfect combination), Spacial-Softly harmonies (Mellotron and Organ creating a paradisiac atmosphere), Good Guitars interventions (Gilmour at one of his most creative moments), Delightful lyrics (Waters showing us a minimalistic, simbolic world) everything in Echoes fit perfectly. Meddle is a classic, an unbelivable work. A few bands in the 70's could record such wonder. If you don't have this genuine Floyd's piece of magic, buy it now, and listen it carefully, feeling the sound, reaching the skies...

0792151712|3.0|It's funny in a way- Titanic became the most popular movie of all time (so far) according to grosses and that's only because teenage girls across the country saw it fourteen and fifteen times apiece!  But what a marvelous and equitable exchange.  Thanks to James Cameron, girls that weren't around in 1977 now have their own &quot;Star Wars&quot;.  (Great bit, John, thanks for letting me borrow it.)  I won't bore anyone reading this with plot summary or the complete details of the story.  Come on.  We've all seen it.  We all know it.  I'll just give you my own personal take on it, okay?  Okay. First and foremost, I feel James Cameron o.d.'ed on himself.  I realize he's a talented filmmaker and a big mover and shaker in &quot;the biz&quot; (and he couldn't care less that I'm writing this) but the fact that he wrote it, directed it, and produced it, and everything else he had a hand in gives the whole production a kind of one dimensional feel.  I read that even the sketches that L. D.'s character &quot;Jack&quot; is supposed to have drawn were done by Cameron himself.  And those are his hands doing the picture of &quot;Rose&quot; on the couch.  I should have guessed whenever someone in the movie complimented Jack on his work.  &quot;These are good, Jack.  Very good!&quot;  One can smell the self-appraisal all the way to steerage.  The rest of the dialogue isn't much better.  Don't get me wrong, I like his films &quot;Terminator 1 &amp; 2,&quot; &quot;Aliens&quot; and &quot;the Abyss.&quot;  But these are mainly science-fiction stories with messages about ourselves and each other with regard to the future which give the audience something to think about besides &quot;oh, what a great line!&quot;  (I get the impression, J.C. is very anti-nuclear power but loves hydrolic machinery- look for it.  End of aside.)  However, in &quot;Titanic&quot; I felt like the dialogue was only interested in being clever or obvious and not at all realistic.  Such as: &quot;Of course it's unfair- we're women.&quot; and not to mention: &quot;Mr. Andrews, I saw the iceberg and I can see it in your eyes...tell me the truth.&quot;  And lest we forget: &quot;Trust me...you wanna take this call!&quot; followed shortly by, &quot;Told you you wanted to take the call.&quot;  Ugh!  (By the way, how many times did they repeat the line: &quot;This is absurd!&quot;)  Also, I started to notice the way Cameron &quot;slipped&quot; facts about the ship into the dialogue to show us how much research he had done.  The size of the ship, its weight, how many people it took to build, what the lifeboats were capable of, etc.  And as far as who spouted off these random statements of trivia... except for the ship's designer/engineer I had no idea the passengers were already so knowledgeable about Titanic on its maiden voyage. At first I thought that this was the first love story that Cameron had ever directed.  Until someone pointed out to me that all his films are actually love stories if looked at the right way.  &quot;That's true,&quot; I said, &quot;but this time it is the main plot instead of a subplot and creates a strange warped twist to the  movie.&quot;  I'm so used to James Cameron being an action film director first and foremost.  But there not being much action until the iceberg strikes, I guess the love theme had to bubble to the surface of the story a little earlier than usual.  Which brings me to the actual sinking.   I'll be the first to admit, the special effects were impressive.  And like most of the people who wrote reviews before and after me, I agree that they preceeded the acting and stories on board the ship.  Almost paving the way for &quot;Phantom Menace&quot; a few years later.  But that's another review. My point is, everyone came to the movie to see the ship sink.  That's the whole idea!  There wouldn't have been a movie made or anyone who cared about a ship that had a successful humdrum voyage across the sea.  Quick lesson: Drama equals conflict.  You start a story with everything fine.  You create a problem.  Now, if you solve the problem, it's a comedy.  If you don't, it's a tragedy.  Of course I'm vastly overstating.  Forgive the generalization, but you people writing reviews about being upset with the film ending so sadly or for sinking the ship at all...  And those who wanted the Titanic to arrive in New York and have a Disney-ish happily ever after ending, I'm sorry..., but GET A CLUE!!!  Where are you from?  Where did you go to school?  That's what really happened!  The ship hit an iceberg and sank to the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean!  Hundreds of lives were lost!  Deal with it!  Did you also write reviews on &quot;Gone With the Wind&quot; saying that you wish the South had won the Civil War so poor Scarlett O'Hara would not have had to suffer such hardship?!  Please.  (Okay, deep breath.  I apologize for that.  At least I didn't write it in all caps.) Anyway, to sum up:  I went with my then girlfriend to see this thing in the theatre and she cried while I analyzed.  (Not the most romantic guy that night, I know.)  But I helped her fall asleep in my arms later that evening by explaining to her why the movie had to end the way it did.  (I won't spoil the ending for the two people left in the western hemisphere who are reading this that haven't seen the flick.)  I said: &quot;If it ended happily, that would have been predictable.  This way it's poetry.&quot;
B000053V7O|5.0|If you've ever been in a small, smoke filled club, oh, 'round about midnight, when the beauty of the jazz being played brings absolute tears to your eyes, well, you'll know why this film is so special. Jazz itself swims in the river of risk, and director Bertrand Tavernier jumps in feet first. Instead of using regular actors to play the parts of these creative people, he does it one better and uses the musicians themselves to tell the story. Starring the remarkable late tenorman Dexter Gordon, we follow the story of a 1950's american jazzman in Paris who is on the slow decline to destruction until he his befriended by a local fan, played wonderfully by Francois Cluzet. Dexter was not the only musician to grace the screen. Others such as Bobby Hutcherson, Herbie Hancock, Billy Higgins, Wayne Shorter, Ron Carter, and several others not only provided the music in the film but many played pivotal roles as well. This use of musician that have been there, done that brings a special &quot;realness&quot; that could never have come across by using regular actors. On a side note, this film was unique in quite another way. Almost all of the music that you see being performed in the movie was actually being played and recorded right on the stage. In nearly every other movie the music is rerecorded at a later date in order to take out any &quot;mistakes&quot;. This just shows the lengths that director Tavernier was willing to go to bring the true spirit of jazz to the screen. In ending, this film, like jazz itself, will probably not be for everyone. However, if you pass up the chance to see this film you will miss the chance to add two hours of magic to your life!
B000002J03|1.0|I must say that I don't understand how you reviewers can describe this album as &quot;thunderous&quot;.When I first heard Whole Lotta Love I thought to myself &quot; it sounds like he's playing a toy guitar, a plastic guitar&quot;. I honestly thought it was a quiet intro before the real ,hard song began.The reviewer who said that no albums rocks quite as hard as this one must have a very small record collection. However before you Led Zeppelin fans damn my soul to the fiery pits of hell, I have to say that I do quite like this album because the toy guitar sound and cute songs like Thank you and What Is And what Should Never Be bring back some lovely childhood memories of being taken to Santa's Magic Grotto and seeing the elfs,the first time I saw Bambi in the theatre with my parents , and the nice birthday cake I got for my fourth birhday( it had a lovely little pink sugar mouse on it)
B000002J2F|5.0|This was the first Genesis album I ever listened to back in 1982. Its power grabbed me immediately. The music is very uplifting and emotional. Some points of the album bring your heart to bursting point. &quot;Dukes End&quot;, the finale, leaves you with a satisfying warm glow.<br />It was not until recently that I sat down and analysed the lyrics of this album for some kind of theme.  What I found quite shocked me. There is a very clear depressing theme here, the message being that life is futile, empty of meaning and any belief or trust in this world is alternately doomed to betrayal. This is in total contrast to the music, which like a roller coaster, leaves you with a feeling of exhilaration and an appreciation for a universe that is capable of creating musical sensations such as this album. I wouldn't hire Genesis to write a film score!<br />To sum up, there are very few albums that produce such an emotional sensation as this one. Ignore the lyrics (unless of course you enjoy being depressed) and immerse yourself in this uplifting musical experience.
B000003BD3|3.0|David Dalton's linear notes are so out of whack with reality--he basically claims that this was a succesful attempt by the Stones to save Rock and Roll through a self-sacrificing bow to harmony and generational unity--that my first reaction was to scoff at this LP.<br />But I'd heard so much about it over the years, thanks to the myth created by Jagger's decades-long refusal to release the tapes, that I just had to hear it.  And, Dalton's hyper-spin aside, it is a fine, though flawed, LP.<br />It hasn't been completely hidden all these years.  The Who included this version of &quot;A Quick One&quot; in THE KIDS ARE ALL RIGHT, and it is good enough to make the old story that the Who was too good for Jagger to let the tapes out seem credible.<br />Jethro Tull, at that time just a bright blip on the rock and roll radar, are surprisingly good here.  The live stuff they would release on their own later is ponderous, this is energetic and great.<br />The Marianne Faithfull tune stands out like a sore thumb, kind of a bad Sandy Denny imitation.  I never understood how Faithfull had any hits, prior to BROKEN ENGLISH, it all sounds like tripe to me.<br />For me the highlight of this LP is The Dirty Mac, the Lennon/Clapton/Richards/Mitchell ensemble who throw off a wicked version of &quot;Yer Blues,&quot; for my money one of Lennon's ten best tracks.  This is the only moment on this CD where Dalton's claims of some historical significance make sense.  Lennon was only a few months into his truly classic independent period.  This is great, great stuff.<br />It is immediately destroyed, as was so often the case, by a lame bluesy jam and Yokos incessant caterwauling.  In later years Lennono did their best to say the B-52s, Lena Lovitch and others were inspired by Yoko's music.  I tend to think only a rash of suicides and self-immulations could have been inspired by this kind of thing.<br />The Stones, according to Dalton's notes, performed thier set at something like 4 a.m..  Sorry kiddies, but it kind of sounds like it.  <br />&quot;Jumping Jack Flash&quot; moves in slow motion.  ThE live version can be found on GET YER YA YA'S OUT, recorded within just a few months of ROCK &amp; ROLL CIRCUS.  <br />&quot;Parachute Woman&quot; is better, much better than the studio version. Much of the rest of the set is good, though uninspired.<br />&quot;Salt Of The Earth&quot; is great--it's one of the best things the Stones ever wrote--but is it really live?  Looking at the video, and listening to the audio, I'm more and move convinced all the time that Mick &amp; Keith's vocals were recorded live over the studio-recorded tracks and backing vocals.  Not that big a deal, I guess, but it says something about the sinceerity and authenticity Dalton tried so hard to sell in his notes.
B000002UJQ|5.0|Radiohead started off being quite basic;  Two, sometimes 3 guitarists, a bass player and a drummer.  But somewhere from point A to point B, Radiohead transformed into a rock behemoth that did more than just &quot;rock.&quot;  &quot;The Bends&quot; was the first warning sign that Radiohead was more than the sum of its parts.  But it was &quot;OK Computer&quot; that shot Radiohead into the stratosphere.  And for good reason too.  The opening riff of &quot;Airbag&quot; sounds jarring at first, but after a couple of listens, that song becomes one of the standouts.  In fact, this CD requires that the listener give it a couple of spins before its true majesty really stands out.<br />You'll know the singles: Paranoid Android (with the cartoon video), Karma Police and No Surprises.  What you may not have heard is equally stunning.  One listen to &quot;Let Down&quot; might possibly bring you to tears.  That song contains the emotional peak of the album, Thom Yorke belting out an anguished &quot;You'll know where you are..&quot; only to halt all singing start wailing in his sweet falsetto.  Exit Music (To A Film) starts out softly only to build into one of the albums big rock tracks, similarly only to fade away at the end with Yorke whispering &quot;We hope...that you choke.&quot; repeatedly.  This CD contains not a single bad track and is best listened to as an album, not as a collection of songs. The album's songs are filled with electronic atmospherics, a first for a major rock band.  Many of the songs are drenched in reverb, a trademark of Nigel Godrich, producer of this and Kid A.<br />This CD is in no way similar to Kid A, so if you were a little disappointed with Kid A and want to know what all of the fuss is about, you might be better off with this CD as it is more mainstream and traditional while still being slightly left of center.  One of the finest albums ever made, &quot;OK Computer&quot; will probably go on to become a legendary CD much in the way that &quot;TheWall&quot; and &quot;Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot; are today.
B000002LHT|5.0|This is the group's best album.. It was also a forgotten one. I really LOVE alot of the songs!! (Especially &quot;Merry Christmas (I Don't Want To Fight Tonight)&quot;) But dissapointingly, It was the last album with long time bassist:Dee Dee Ramone. But that's not going to stop me from giving this album a high one! And Joey Ramone has died 12 years after the album came out... Goodbye Joey... We all &quot;Remember You&quot; We're just glad you didn't die in the &quot;Pet Semetary&quot;. Heh Heh..
B0000508U6|5.0|I bought this CD the day it came out (Nov. 7) based on word of mouth about their song &quot;Yellow.&quot;  The CD did not disappoint.  The album starts out with one of its best tracks, &quot;Don't Panic.&quot;  This is the song that reminds me most of Radiohead, with it's delayed guitar effects, but the tune itself is very different from the average Radiohead song.  Coldplay take a more optimistic approach to their music with the best example being &quot;Everything's Not Lost&quot; with it's ending chant of &quot;Come on yeah, Sing out yeah, Come on yeah, Everything's Not Lost,&quot; which also ends the CD on a very introspective yet upbeat note.  <br />The most emotional song on the CD outside of &quot;Yellow&quot; is the follow-up track &quot;Trouble.&quot;  With it's melancholic piano line, it's the most depressing song on the CD.  But it's a very beautiful tune and you can really feel the emotion in Chris' voice.  Another personal favorite is &quot;Spies,&quot; which has a hair-raising middle-eight that really pushes through the urgency in the song.  Most of the songs are acoustic but some make use of distortion, most notably the new American single &quot;Shiver&quot; (which really grooves.)  The album also has a very tight production, which is probably where the Radiohead references come.  They also make use of atmospherics like Radiohead, but the Travis comparison is unwarranted.  The songs may contain acoustic guitars but this stuff is a long way from &quot;The Man Who.&quot;  This is one of the best debut CD's I've heard in a long time and it's really fantastic that American radio is accepting them the way they have.  Based on the promise of this CD, this band have a lot of potential to be enthralling...and I hope they realize it on their next album.
B00004RIUV|5.0|One of my fondest memories was listening to radio in the 70's in Albuquerque, New Mexico and hearing tracks such as &quot;No Other&quot; and &quot;Strength of Strings.&quot;  The haunting, melancholic vocals of the Byrds tortured soul soaring over melodic and striking electric guitars with a backdrop of harmonic voices and strings certainly left me 8 miles high.  It was a time where there were no limits.  So what we got was a man with bluegrass in his bones, L.A. country rock in his &quot;Byrd&quot; brain, English folk in his minstrel heart, strains of classical music flowing through his bloodstream, and rock in his gut.  Although Gene left us quite a while ago, he did leave us with a bonafide classic that defies all genres.
B00005AXEL|4.0|Stevie Nicks has always been one of my favorite musicians. I was very excited to find out about this new album and I am, as always, very impressed as a whole. Thank you Stevie!
B00004ZD69|5.0|I bought this CD last week and I think that it is great. I think the melodies are very catchy and well written and the dialog suites the music. I usually listen to this CD when I am reading or going to sleep. Anyone who enjoys relaxing but noisy music will enjoy this title.
B00000J7JO|5.0|I am a huge chili peppers fan and I've heard all their CD's, and I'd have to say this is definitely one of the best... although I can't say the best because I love BSSM and One Hot Minute too. This has less funk, but the lyrics are great and I love how poetic they are. This is definitely a new style for the Chili Peppers, and although it's a little different, it's still great. It has so many hits... otherside, californication, scar tissue, parrallel universe, around the world, and i'm sure more to come. It's a great CD and I love every single song. It's obvious that the chili peppers put a lot of time and thought into this CD to make it so good. This is definitely worth your money.
B000002P7R|5.0|Let's face it folks.  No one's work has been as bastardized as that of one James Marshall Hendrix.  Part of it was the musical talent he possessed, part of it the amount of time he spent recording.  With all the Hendrix music sitting in the vault at MCA, there is hours that has never been heard, and I'm talking ever.  Eddie Kramer, Jimi's engineer once said that MCA/Experience Hendrix could put out one full length album for the next 15-20 years, and still have stuff left that has never been heard... What's my point, you ask?  It is simply that the stuff that has been heard is constantly repackaged, advertised as something it's not, and in some cases, edited beyond all belief.  Add to that that most of the material is sub-par material that Jimi himself would never have wanted released, and you have a recipe for rip-off, POS albums.  Records like &quot;Jimi Hendrix with Curtis Knight and the Squires&quot;  are just shameless attempts to grab some cash by advertising Hendrix's session work as full-fledged recordings.<br />What we have now with &quot;South Saturn Delta&quot; is probably the best we'll get as far as unreleased material in the Hendrix catalogue goes (besides live performances that they are currently holding back from us Jimi-philes).  Although some of it was derived from the '70s post-humous releases War Heroes, Ranbow Bridge, and Cry Of Love, the album is vastly made up of unreleased alternate takes, and songs that Jimi was never able to complete.<br />Although this is probably the weakest entry in the Experience Hendrix catalogue, that's not saying much, and SSD is still an excellent, if somewhat fuzzy, underproduced, and incomplete, record.  The frustrating part isn't the unfinished mixes, it's the way you see what Jimi was trying to get at, but wasn't able to quite explain fully before his 1970 death.  You wonder, without answer what last effect he would have dubbed overtop of the mix, or what lyrics he would have changed, or even if the song itself isn't just a jam that Jimi hoped wouldn't be released.<br />Unfortunately, there's no one there to answer the questions that race around in the back of our heads, and so it becomes difficult to take this album for what it really is.  It's for the die-hards who just want a glimpse into Jimi's beautiful emotion and songwriting process.  For anyone else, this album might just prove to be a cluttered mess, which it actually can be at some points.  But those of us who are desperate for Jimi are just clinging onto what we can, and we appreciate the unfinished work in all it's raw glory.<br />The tracks nearing completion are fantastic, and the first takes of other songs can be just as good.  Hearing what material sounded like for the first time played is an awe-inspiring experience.  Take for example, &quot;Little Wing.&quot; One of the first takes of the song is on this disc, but it sounds nothing like the final track itself!  It's very melodic and beautiful in it's own right, but when you consider the possibilities of alternate takes, it boggles the mind.<br />The album is a great listening experience throughout, but there are moments when you have to wonder about EHs motives behind releasing certain tracks.  the alternate take of &quot;Angel&quot; is missing about a minute because of damage to the master, and the alternate take of &quot;All Along The Watchtower,&quot; sounds extremely similar to the original.<br />Still deserving of five stars, if only because of the raw fury of the record, SSD is a must have for any of the hundreds of thousands of Jimi-philes out there.  If you are new to the world of Hendrix, stay away from this collection until you've heard Jimi's original studio albums and live performances...
0790744473|5.0|Brigadoon is my most favourite musical of all time not only is the dancing great but the singing is just fantastic.Gene Kelly is an exellent Tommy and Cyd Charisse deserved to play Fiona.  Brigadoon is about two American travelers who get lost in the highlands of bonnie scotland.They decied to rest for a bit then they see a small village which is not on the map. They decied to explore it and hopefully rest for the night.When they get there they notice that every one in the village are wearing funny clothes.Things really turn weird when a man at a stall will not accept modern scottish money.This is because Brigadoon is a village which only comes to life every 100 years.  As the storey unfolds Tommy realises that he loves Fiona and she also loves him,but there is one problem.Tommy is already engaged!He then realises that he must go back to New York but once there he changes his mind to go back to Scotland even though he knows that Fiona will not be there because she will be asleep for 100 years but does she wake up?

0802130208|5.0|Normally I don't read books like this [or particularly enjoy them], but this book was FANTASTIC! The hero, Ignatius Reilly, is a big, selfish loser with amazing intelligence and a hilarious weltanschaang. This book is about him having to get a job due to a car accident his mother had, while attempting to write a book on the misery of the 20th century. This novel is full of side stories and irony. The characters are all remarkable, Ignatius most of all. I laughed until I cried many times when he expressed his opinions on his New Orleans environment. My favorite line is when he lies to his mother about injuries from a cat he received as a hot dog vendor, &quot;I had a rather apocalyptic battle with a starving prostitute. But for my superior brawn, I would have been overpowered. She fled the scene, her rags askew.&quot; Isn't that a scream? This book is a must read, but for the less well-read, I strongly recommend building up a vocabulary, keeping an open mind, and to try to see past the vulgarity of Ignatius.
B00004Z459|5.0|When I first heard &quot;One Step Closer&quot; I thought it sounded so cool. It took me awhile to decide if I should get the cd but I'm glad I did.  I was surprised to see that this is one of the first hard rock cd's without a parental advisory.  That's pretty cool.  It shows that good rock music can be made without all the profanity.  I recommend this cd if you like limp bizkit, korn, or papa roach. It's a great cd.
B00005ASHM|2.0|Why this is one of the greatest records in Pop Music history is beyond me.  I have listened to this cd several times in both stereo and mono and I just don't get it.  Each time I listen to it I have to struggle my way through.  To me, it's just another Beach Boys record with Brian Wilsons' whiny vocals.  That's not so bad when he's singing that corny surf music but when he tries to get serious as he does on Pet Sounds it's almost unbearable.  How can anyone think that this is better than anything the Beatles did is even more ludicrous.  Unless you're a serious Beach Boys fan or you just want to be tortured then buy this cd so you can be tortured in both stereo and mono for the price of one.
0446677450|2.0|This book had some interesting perspectives of self discipline and the need to invest in save and invest in assets that will hopefully generate cash for you. However, my complaints with the book are that it takes so long to make its points. Was the book originally 20-30 pages before the publisher asked him to expand it? And if you are looking for concrete ideas on putting this asset buying philosophy into action, you won't find many examples. Most of his examples are real estate or stocks and are generally passive business ventures. I think he overstates the simplicity of the real estate deals (mentions spending only 5 or 10 hours to research, buy, resell, and close a real estate foreclure deal -- 5 hours????). One thing the book did motivate me to do was to learn about buying real estate foreclosures although I think it is much more work than he describes. In the introduction and in the ending of the book, of course they push their other products - like a game that they want to sell you for $195 dollars to learn more of what they weren't able to tell you outright in the book. I'll tell you a good way to get out of the ratrace -- write a book and make a boardgame promising to make people rich, sell the game for $195!
B000009EAD|3.0|This was the first Iced Earth album I had ever bought, (back in '99) And I must admit it is a good, strong album. The only problem is it becomes overplayed rather quickly (about three months time). I feel that the strongest track on the album is the final track (more of an epic), &quot;The Coming Curse&quot;. It stays with the time honored Iced Earth tradition of the final track on an album being a seven-miniute plus epic. Truly the greatest triumph of the album, (defeats blessed are you for #1 spot).      One thing I have noticed however is that a lot of the songs on the album seemed to be somewhat &quot;borrowed&quot; from earlier Iced Earth albums. The second and third tracks sound ALMOST EXACTLY like the second and third tracks from their 1997 release, &quot;The Dark Saga&quot;.      If you are a die hard Iced-devil or just new to Iced Earth, this makes a great addition to your collection of CDs. I would also reccomend it to the not-as-die hard fans out there, but only for a cheaper price.

0671015206|4.0|I am an avid reader of &quot;motivational&quot; and &quot;success&quot; books. This book is one that I would classify as &quot;worth a read&quot;<br />Stanley and Danko drive home some hard truths in this book, and expose the mistakes a lot of us make in our perceptions of who really are the millionaires. Not the hyperconsuming lawyers or doctors out there living in exclusive neighbourhoods, but rather the average mum and dad, running their own business, who have learnt how to save their pennies, and invest them wisely. <br />This is not a &quot;rags to riches&quot; book in the sense that it does not cover the inspiring stories of people such as Ford, Disney and Edison. But books on these topics are now dime a dozen. &quot;The Millionaire Next Door&quot; gives us a different perspective on who really are the millionaires out there and how they got that way. It should be noted that frugality is an often repeated word in this book. One thing I do disagree with the authors about, is that once a person does have considerable wealth, I believe that they should enjoy it. After all, life is an adventure - if you've achieved your goals of being financially wealthy, sit back, relax, and enjoy!
B00005AXEL|5.0|Cheers to Stevie for this new record,her best along with the outstanding Belladonna.I knew she was back in full force since listening to Silver Springs from the FM The Dance album.Every song in this album has something different. I guess my favorites are Planets of The Universe,I Miss you,Every Day,TISL,Sorcerer. Listen to this CD, you will not be dissapointed. The queen is back!
B000001Y5J|5.0|BROKEN is the weirdest album trent has ever made. once you see closure with all of his videos, you will see (and hear) how intense of a ride youll be on in this album. best song WISH
0451169514|5.0|I read Stephen Kings IT for the first time about ten years ago and within the first twenty or so pages fell in love with it as I had fell in love with no other book before or since.<br />Explaining the allure of this book is difficult; to call it a simple horror novel would be doing it a great injustice, its much more a rights of passage novel, the characters shining out between the pages, childhood has rarely been dealt with so convincingly as in the pages of this novel. <br />The only flaw in what otherwise would have been his masterpiece was the ending it just didn't do justice to what had preceded it, I just hope Stephen will some day reedit the novel and give it the finale it deserves.
B000051VWW|2.0|I have been a fan since Diamond Life and have always felt that this was one of the most original and unique groups around. And then came Lover's Rock. After 8 years, SADE has left behind almost everything that made them unique. Gone is the variety of musical style. Gone is the warm, organic sound of a real Jazz band playing real Jazz. Whether it's pure egotism or just the urge to be &quot;modern&quot;, featuring only SADE's singing backed by this stripped down, programmed version of the band just doesn't hold up. The mellow, &quot;aloof&quot; singing style played very well against the previous warm, smooth musical backing, however it now comes across as bored, cold, tired, and frankly depressing.  Although some of the lyrics are very nice and the Lady's can still sing in her inimitable way, this has always been true.   Please, bring back the rest of the SADE! Let's hope there's another album soon to redeem this one. Without their preceeding reputation, there's no way this one would have ever been a best seller.
0312979479|5.0|Agatha Christie is the master of the mystery novel. Period. There is no question in my mind that she is the epitome of what mystery storytelling is about.<br />'And Then There Were None' is, I believe, her all time greatest novel. Though with well over 70 novels in print, it is hard to read them all. I love the way her charectors develope in this novel, in the short time they inhabit Indian Island.<br />The premis is simple. Ten strangers sent to an island for a luxorious get away. Mysteriously, however, one by one, they all begin to disapear...who did it? You'll have to read this wonderful novel to find out!<br />Five out of Five
6301404440|5.0|In a funny and touching story revolving around &quot;Toontown&quot; the city where everyone from Bugs Bunny to Mickey Mouse to Betty Boop lives in this movie, the top cartoon companies came together to create a lovely (and, of course, hilarious) story that will have all cartoon fans cheering, not only for the characters' roles in this movie, but also to see cartoon characters from rival studios side by side on the screen. In particular are shots with very few cartoon characters, each from a different studio. My favourite example is where one of the human characters falls out of a building in Toontown and Bugs Bunny and Mickey Mouse are skydiving and decide to help him out by giving him a &quot;spare&quot; (which, of course, turns out to be a tire!)
B00005AR3G|5.0|My wife and I bought this DVD for our 3 year old son. He was glued to the TV for the entire movie. Later that evening my wife and I watched it. Needless to say, we were laughing throughout the entire movie! David Spade as the Emperor is hilarious!! The Emperor's New Groove is great family entertainment- very, very, funny!!
0060278234|4.0|I had waited years to finally read the sequal to Sabriel which I consider one of my favorites and equal to anything I have read in adult fiction.  Lireal was  descent and interesting but a very slow beginning to the series of two new books.  The ending was abrupt and the meat of the novel didn't really begin until the last say 50 pages.  However I eagerly await Abhorsen since the real story seems to be underway.
0385491026|2.0|I enjoyed reading the first part of this part, about Elaine's childhood--and could very well relate to the cruely and power plays which do occur among young girls in our society. In fact, I found the chapters which returned to the present an interruption because they just seemed to ramble on. In the present, Elaine has returned to Toronto, her hometown, for an art show, and these chapters just go on and on as she wanders around town in a jogging suit--with her whining about her flab and middle age, checking out how the streets and ambiance has changed. One chapter could have sufficed.<br />The second part was rather disjointed and monotonous. Here Elaine is a young adult, and again, the story switches back and forth between that time and the present. It seems like Atwood suddenly felt she was in a hurry to finish this up. We get no feeling as to what went wrong in her marriage, why they were &quot;throwing things&quot; and what really was going on. It seems that she suddenly remembers she has a brother, and needs to do something about him, so she kills him off. It seemed totally contrived. She does the same thing with her parents. She hasn't meantioned them for a few hundred pages, and all of a sudden, they die off too, in a few pages. Her marriage to her second husband, and birth of a second child is covered in half a page. We get no feel as to how she evolved into this whining, depressing creature who's now wandering the streets of Toronto, moaning about her friendship to Cordelia.<br />Cordelia is another issue. Right at the beginning, it's hinted that there's something really exciting with this Cordelia issue, that some juicy issues are going to be uncovered. But after her initial torment, at age 9 or 10,there's nothing more to it. She becomes friends with her again in high school, Cordelia no longer has power over her. She runs into her once or twice after high school, and that's it. I was waiting for something more, why this obsession with her, but nothing. Igave this book 2 stars because I liked the first part about her childhood and some of her writing is very good, but all in all, a very depressing book that promises something but doesn't deliver. No plot, no &quot;message&quot; nothing to learn from it.
B000002UAO|5.0|This fabulous, fourteen track CD, with twelve tracks by the Lennon/McCartney songwriting duo, one track by Lennon/McCartney/Starkey (Ringo), and one by George Harrison, is a significant departure from their earlier works. Here, the music is lusher, darker, and more complex. With the release of this album, The Beatles bid goodbye to their &quot;Yeah, Yeah, Yeah&quot; days and established themselves as a musical force of note, more talented than anyone had imagined.<br />With vivid imagery and themes, they sang about life and all its turbulent emotions, a virtual social commentary. From the rock and roll refrains of &quot;Drive My Car&quot; to the sitar laden &quot;Norwegian Wood&quot;, followed up by the existential &quot;Nowhere Man&quot;, The Beatles had a lot to say, and they did so with a vengeance.<br />Love was still an important theme, however, to which Paul paid homage with the romantic ballad, &quot;Michelle&quot;, as did John in &quot;Girl&quot;, a song so filled with yearning it is almost palpable. As if this weren't enough, add the lament of love lost in &quot;I'm Looking Through You&quot;, as well as the achingly poignant &quot;In My Life&quot;, and you have a musical experience so complete, that no music collector should be without this CD.
0375501851|2.0|Zadie Smith's debut novel was chosen as the first novel for my fledgling book club.  I did not choose the book, but was heartened by the reviews and descriptions I found.  This seemed like a book I would enjoy--very meaty and full of interesting people.  Normally able to zip through a novel, I had to force myself to finish this the day before our club met to discuss it.  I asked myself over and over, &quot;When will I get into this book?&quot;, and by page 360, I finally found my answer:  &quot;NEVER!&quot;.  I enjoy a character driven novel, and although this appears to be a character study, it disapppoints on several levels.  <br />First, it introduces characters and never follows up with them.  For example, Alsana, Samad's wife--she had the potential to be an interesting character, and I enjoyed reading about her in the beginning when she was pregnant, but later in the story, she seemed wooden and flat.  So vibrant in the beginning, and seemingly so easy to understand, her later actions and motivations are a mystery to me.  Clara is another example of woeful neglect;  she is introduced as an amazing character, and as the book progresses, she is merely part of the scenery.  <br />Second, it introduces characters and spends TOO MUCH time on them.  Samad is a character that got a lot of space in the book, but didn't contribute much to the overall appeal of the story.  The more I knew about him, the less I cared about him.  His most intersting facet was his obsession with the twins' music teacher, and that was over in the first half of the book.  <br />Finally, I think the ending was rather poor.  I enjoy an ending where the entire plot comes together, and where all the characters left dangling earlier on fall into place.  I believe this was Ms. Smith's intent, however, she fell a bit short.  I found myself having to go back and LOOK UP who these people were.  I did not have the A-HA moment when I saw the big picture.  It was more like, &quot;Oh, I guess that was whyI had to slog through 50 pages of that whole WWII thing....&quot;  <br />Although Ms. Smith uses a lot of interesting vocabulary, and tries to spin a tale that captivates and intrigues, I found that I just didn't care enough about the people she emphasized, and found myself wishing to know better the people she swept under the rug.  In the end, not worth the time or effort it takes to plow through this tome.
B000002C1V|5.0|Of all of Pink Floyd's great albums, this one is my personal favorite.  At first listen, it will be a revelation.  There's very little of the &quot;classic&quot; PF sound on this disc.  David Gilmour and Nick Mason have largely been relegated to the rank of sidemen for this project (although Gilmour's work on this album is great as usual).  This is, by and large, Roger Waters' show.  And his songwriting and performing have never been so personal and heartfelt.  A damnation of war, searing and inspiring.  Standout cuts include NOT NOW JOHN, YOUR POSSIBLE PASTS, and PARANOID EYES.  The sound quality of the remastered version is incredible.
0679879269|5.0|When I first read The Golden Compass, and then The Subtle Knife, I was completely drawn in by not only the discriptive writing style, but the compelling characters as well.  I waited for two long years for this third book to finally come out, and I wasn't disapointed. (well, not much anyway)  It once again took me back to this fascinating world, and once again succeded in making me long for my own Daemon!  This book not only lived up to the first two, but even surpassed them all the while giving fine closure to the series.  Anyway, in this book Will is called by angels to go and fight at Lord Asriel's side as he wages his epic war against god and heaven itself, but instead he goes to the aid of his friend Lyra, who has been kidnapped by those Will believes may want to destroy her.  I won't say anything else because I simply can not bring myself to spoil if for you, but take my word for it; this is one heck of a series!  However, I think this is a book I will definitely read again in four of five years, because often I could not shake the sensation  that some of the sybolism and such was going over my head...  Also, while the Will/Lyra thing was sweet, it was somewhat (forgive me) unbeleivable.  I mean really, eleven and twelve year  olds falling deeply in love?  Get real!  Also, I would have liked to see more if the action focusing on the battle of heaven and earth, that was the climax of the series wasn't it?  Or am I once again missing something here?  Anyway, besides those things this was an excellent book, though I would mostly recommend it to  teenagers and adults.  Also most definitely read the first to prior two this one, since otherwise it will make little or no sense.
076781214X|5.0|This an excellent film to watch primarily bacause all the cast members, including Coppola's daughter who plays Sue's sister in the movie, did a super job of acting their parts. I understand that Miss Kathleen Turner did not want Mr. Cage to be her co-star; however, Coppola wisely insisted that his nephew play the roll  Some reviews are critical of Mr. Cage's performance; on the contrary, he does capture the part of that type of kid.  I knew several fellas like him when I went to high school in the 40's.  With the exception of one scene in which Miss Turner sexually get's involved with the student poet, the entire family can watch the film without being embarrassed.  I feel Peggy Sue Got Married will be appreciated in the future like many of us now appreciate &quot;It Happened One Night&quot; with Cable and Colbert. &quot;It Happened One Night,&quot; with Cable and Colbert.
B000005JA8|2.0|This album is widely hailed as one of the most visionary works of all time. I have listened to it several times and just can't seem to grasp it. There seems to be a total lack of melody or even structure in the song writing. Combine that with the Captain's animal like growling vocals and the strangest guitar work I have ever heard, flat and monotone like. What's it all mean? Was this the beginning of punk? I hesitate to call it trash. There is some imagination in it and for that I gave it 2 stars. Maybe with the help of a certain herb it might become clearer; but I don't think there is enough of that on the whole planet to clarify this piece of obscurity.
B00000255F|5.0|When I first bought this album I was nervous because I wasn't sure if I would be satisfied with it.  I'd only heard one song of Bruce Sprinsteen's, the title track, but was still interested.  After a few listens, the album grew on me. I love the way Springsteen's voice sounds (although many don't).  You can truly understand the music when you combine the raw emotion in the vocals and the hopeful lyrics.  The lyrics are probably the best at descrbing what they're supposed to, which is (in my opinion) teenage angst and felings.  HIGHLGHTS: &quot;THUNDER ROAD, &quot;12TH AVE, FREEZE OUT,&quot; &quot;BACKSTREETS,&quot; &quot;BORN TO RUN,&quot; and &quot;JUNGLELAND.&quot;
B00000IAU3|5.0|First of all let me correct the last reviewer in that DIDO ARMSTRONG wrote the songs on this EXCELLENT cd. She kind of reminds me of JEWEL. I didn't think much of it when I first got it but everytime I listened to the cd I liked it more and more. She should win BEST NEW ARTIST. Can't wait to see her this summer. Buy it!
B000002I8H|2.0|The idea is as simple as rewarding. Take one of the most distinguished voices in jazz, take some of the greatest hits of the greatest pop group (now and then) and put them in new (I would not dare to call them either modern or jazzy) arrangements - and you have a bestseller. It probably was (I don't know any concrete sales figures, though). However, that says little about the quality.  This odd recording is not easy to rate. Sarah Vaughan's performance would well deserve five stars, but it is almost impossible to enjoy it due to the dull arrangements of Marty and David  Paich, who filled almost every song up with a glue of synthisizer sounds and strings (particularily so in the case of &quot;Yesterday&quot;).  The only exception - and the only reason to recommend to buy this record - is the brilliant Bossa Nova-style &quot;Something&quot;. But generally, is a great disappointment - especially as it is not hard to imagine what great album this coud have become if Sarah had been accompanied by a piano trio or so (give the quality of both the singer and the songs).
B000023X9W|4.0|Neil Young is one of those prolific artists who keeps turning out quality material with almost every outing. Silver and Gold is another example of this. Neil's forte has long been simplicity. Just him, a guitar and his sweet, slightly off key vocals. This album is as basic as it gets in that respect. It is  very soft and quiet. There is a charm about Neil that is hard to explain. He has always been a wonderful songwriter. Distant Camera and the title cut are prime examples of this gift. Also  from these same sessions but not included on this effort are the songs from the CSNY reunion album, Looking Forward. Specifically, the touching Slowpoke. If these cuts had been included on Silver and Gold we would have been talking instant classic. As it is, it is one of Neil's most beautiful  albums to date. He is certainly one of our most enduring treasures. Silver and Gold is also a treasure and will be remembered for years to come.
B000002MFN|4.0|I Have Been A Madonna Fan Since 1987 And Even Through her controversal period. I think she is one of the most talented, influential creative, gutsy, ambitous, outspoken artis of her kind and will defently be remembered in history. So Much contrversy has surround her careear that not many have had a chance to really listen to her music and give it a chance. some say madonna is a has been and isnt talented if this is so why is she still selling millions of albums, still charting the charts with hit songs and still have our attention?? Anyway im here to write a review on one of her most underated albums ever and probably one of her best. EROTICA. The Album from beginning to end is wonderfull all of the songs are well written, bold, outspoken and give a messege through each song, she was making a statement when her SEX book and this album came out and she did its a very misunderstood album cause not many gave it a chance cause of all of the controversy but its just as good as any rock or pop album of the 70's and it isnt boring or anything. its probably the longest and full album shes ever made. 14 songs(on the uncut version) and over 75 minuttes of music. getting back to the uncut, there really isnt that much &quot;cut&quot; back into the album except for a rap song with a few bad words that eminem would call childrens music. anyway, Erotica excelent music, wonderfull mixing about having pleasure.... Fever, a excelent 90's remake of the classic peggy lee song, Bye Bye Baby a song about breaking up with someone who was using you good beats and vocals, Deeper and Deeper nice retro sound and good mixing about her father and her rebelion, Where a life beggins nice R&amp;B sound.... Bad Girl (myfav) A nice balad about sleeping around and hating her self for it, Waiting, About waitng for someone who never comes back when they say they will, Theif of hearts, a nice little humorus song about a woman trying to steal madonnas boyfriend and shes [very angry], Words, nice little diddy about whatthe affect of words really mean. Rain, one of her best balads ever about missing a loved one and waitng for the rain, why is it so hard, about why do we treat each other like this everyday??, In This Life, a sad song about one of madonnas friends who died of AIDS and how to deal with it, Did you do it?, the song that made the album explicit a rap song by some raper i never heard of and the song is just terrible, Seceret Garden, about forbidden pleasures. Go Get this album if you dont already have it its one of her best indeed excelent production, good mixing and music, excelent vocals and well written. thanks for your time.
B00003XACV|5.0|This score for the film American Beauty continues to be consistant and beautiful throughout the entire disc. It stands on it's own merits, and is a document to the genius of Thomas Newman. Anyone who liked the score for The Shawshank Redemption will love this. Highly reccommended.
B00000F1D3|3.0|I bet no one in 1998 would predict that Cher would release a dance album that would not only instigate possibly the biggest musical comeback since Tina Turner, but provide her with the biggest hit of her career(and the #1 song of 1999).  Well it happened, and though it should have been ignited by her grossly underrated '96 gem IT'S A MAN'S WORLD, as they say, better late than never.  BELIEVE, on the whole, is a pleasant enough album, with some very strong tracks, but also padded with an abundance of filler.  The title track is her best record in ages, and 'All or Nothing'follows very closely in this vein.  'Strong Enough' and 'Love is the Groove' also enhance the festivities.  On the downside, 'Runaway' is utterly generic, as is 'Taxi Taxi' and 'Takin'Back My Heart'.  And the dance reprise of her previous hit 'We All Sleep Alone' was completely unnecessary, particularly since that wasn't one of her better singles.  Overall, I'm glad she got back some of her commercial glory, I just wish it had been with a stronger effort.
B00002ZMNV|5.0|This DVD truly brought my home theater to life!  This was the first concert/music DVD I have ever bought, and now I am hooked.  Between the sound clarity, and video sharpness, and all the other cool features of the DVD, even if you are not a Metallica fan you will enjoy this DVD.  I've played it for people who hate rock/heavy metal, and they loved this DVD!
B000002UWE|4.0|Not as popular as say, the PET SHOP BOYS, not as commercial as CULTURE CLUB, and not as beloved as THE SMITHS, TALK TALK is nevertheless an 80's band that really always deserved a closer look. Synth-pop die-hards remember the singles 'Talk Talk' and the sublime (and personal favorite) 'It's My Life', but there are more than a few other tracks that upon closer scrutiny are clearly as strong as those, and they are all included on this disc.       Possessing a haunting, pained vocal style, Mark Hollis brings his sensitive p.o.v. to a number of songs that anyone other than hardcore TALK TALK fans probably have never heard, tracks like the hard-driving 'Living in Another World'.        As catchy and memorable as any New Wave hit, 'World' to me is one of those lost classics that few have heard and should've. Clocking in at 7 minutes it's a fierce, up-tempo, break-up epic. The singer wounded and hurt but accepting and even complimentary to his lost love.        Need other reasons to pick up 'Natural History'? How about the infectious and inspiring 'Life's what you make it'. Alternately funky and New Wavey it's another stand-out on a disc that has several pleasant surprises if you've been only a casual fan. Like New Wave? Order this.
B00003CXMG|5.0|Amazing! I just saw this movie today, because it opened here this week in Germany. I also write for an Hard-Rock Magazine, and this movie tells the truth. It's warm, enjoyable and with incredible actors. The music is fantastic, and you can feel this great time in every second of this journey. Also Kate Hudson should be the next big star!! So, if you love this movie, than also enjoy &quot;Still Crazy&quot;, which is also, in a little different way, an incredible music trip.
0440219078|3.0|reading 'the giver' gives you the opportunity to think about the brutality of our own world. an ending which leaves space for speculation is the adequate one for such a story. many found that disappointing and disturbing, though.
B00004TH7Z|5.0|This disc gets better every time I listen to it.  Bruce has never sounded better, and the three-guitar lineup gives Maiden a thick, heavy sound they have never had before.  For Maiden fans like me who have lost touch with the band over the last 7-8 years, this disc is a fantastic reminder of how great this band can be.  It's an absolute must-have for any Maiden fan, or any heavy metal fan for that matter.
B000002UUX|5.0|Rust In Peace finallys allows Dave Mustaine and Megadeth fall out of the heavy shadow of Metallica.  It seemed back then that Megadeth was always on step behind but here he passed them up and has never stopped to look back. The musicianship here is top notch and so is the songwriting. &quot;Holy Wars&quot;, &quot;Hanger 18&quot;, are the top two songs of the album, but there is not a single piece of throwaway material here. This album is in the top ten of any album released in the 90's and from the point on Megadeth has in my opinion forced Metallica to try and catch up with them now. This album is for any metal fan out there
B00005B0PU|5.0|Sure I'll say nothing but obvious things, but I'll say it one more time. This is one of the five top albums of all time. Everything here is so beautiful that it almost hurt my ears and soul. From Colin's haunting vocals (he's one of sixtie's best singers) to the group's perfect instrumentation (a great use of mellotron) Oddesey and oracle creates an atmosphere that few other records can emulate. It's a must for avery fan of sixties music and (if you don't have the Zombie heaven box set) there's a lot of bonus tracks. Buy it, enjoy it and be changed forever.
B000002V0Q|5.0|Megadeth have made on of the best albums here of all time.  The disc is filled with great material and even though it might not be as heavy as some of their earlier works, this album doesnt disappoint their fans. On this album we have &quot;Skin O' My Teeth&quot;, &quot;Symphony of Destruction&quot;, &quot;Sweating Bullets&quot; &quot;Architecture of Aggression&quot;, and &quot;Forclosure of a Dream&quot; as some of the standout tunes, and thats not saying the other ones dont rock. There is not weak spots here and Dave Mustaine and Co. Show why they are one of the greatest bands of al time
B00000BKDV|5.0|Awesome, purely great maiden, the opening of drums with Where Eagles dare is awesome,  getitmetal heads, keep it in your cd player more than kill em all(83) go get this cd now,all 9 tracs rock Nicko Mcbrain shows his great talent his first appearance with maiden, definitely the best drummer of all time, other than Vinny Appice(former Dio drummer) rock on, Up the Irons!
B000002L99|5.0|This album is among the best of VH, i like every song from it, but &quot;Dreams&quot; is a wonderful experience of freedom and happiness, a shout of joy; the keyboard work is dinamic and up-lifting, the voice of Hagar is at the top, and the instrumental bridge and the guitar solo are totally amazing. The coda leaves you shacking and wanting more of this extraordinary song, one of the best of all-time. Buy this CD is you like any era of VH.
B00000BKDX|5.0|Awesome its just simply great, the recording and mixing was awesome, Bruce was very funny when he spoke to the crowd, though a few times he talked about 90 miles an hour. Its great definitely add it to the collection from Iron Maiden to Powerslave!! Rock on! Up the Irons!!
B00003CXS4|5.0|I saw it about 5 times in cinema and I am waiting 3 June to buy its DVD. For a long time I haven't seen a movie like this!!!<br />Thanks to Guy, Benicio, Brad and others for this great film!
B00000BKE1|5.0|Awesome cd, this is a great album, Its great to see Jannick use pure talent in this cd, very powerful and emotional, great vocals, edgy and witty, and great bass guitar, drums, ect... People u need to wake up and stop criticising Maiden, this is great, all 12 tracs rock, though i do have my favorites, make no mistake, this should definitely be added to everyone's maiden collection, it rocks.  Up the Irons!!!!
0141000198|3.0|I finished this book in a matter of hours-----what a modern story of women and their caloric obsessions. I think this is an abbreviated version of the original???? But its a pretty good read. Is it going to be a modern classic? I think Helen Fielding hits womanhood on the head pretty well, even if she did totally and unabashedly rip off &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; in so many ways. Bridget Jones, thirtyish and single, obsessed with her weight, going through relationships and employment. What is the appeal of this story? Perhaps just that everyone seems to relate to Bridgets tale in some way or another. Even if I didn't get half of all those Brittish references of stuff....Go ahead and read it....it reminds us how normal and human we all are. And how paranoid!
B00000BKDY|5.0|Ok people all 8 tracs wonderfully written and done, with killer vocals, drumming,of course bass playing, and great guitar riffs, the solo bass and lead guitar on stranger in a strange land was simply magnificent, u could just repeat thatoveragain, Adrian Smith is an awesome guitarist, definitely one of the best, but so is Dave Murray,he was the original and is the head honcho of it all, just listen to him on Heaven can wait, and alexander the great. Another great maiden score of an album! Up the Irons!
6301885732|4.0|A big cartoon. The major flaw with this film is that most of the characters seem like cardboard cutouts. As far as performances, Warren Beatty was okay as Dick Tracy, Al Pacino was great as Big Boy Caprice, but Madonna  stole the show as Breathless Mahoney. She stole every scene she was in. While most of the characters seem like carboard, and are lame at times, Madonna creates a character of true depth, and you actually want her to steal Tracy from Tess Truehart. She is also given great lines like &quot;You don't know if you wanna hit me or kiss me.&quot; Her singing scenes are the best of all. Unfortunately, Al Pacino and especially Madonna are not given enough screen time. This film sort of falls into a void because it's too violent for younger children, and it's not mature enough for adults. I did sort of feel empty after seeing this. While the film was good, it was way too cartoonish for me to own it.                  Dick Tracy (Beatty) goes through many catastropheys as he is trying to keep the city safe. He has to outwit Big Boy Caprice (Pacino), avoid being thrown in jail, and dodge Breathless Mahoney (Madonna). Tracy is trying to get Breathless to testify against Big Boy, while she is trying to seduce him. Tracy also has to outwit the mysterious villian known as &quot;The Blank.&quot;  This film won three Oscars for Makeup, Art Direction, and Best Original Song (Sooner Or Later.)<br />Overall Grade: B (9+)
B00000BKDZ|5.0|Wonderfully done, i simply love this cd,as of all other of maidens, the lyrics were so powerful and spiritual like, filled with christianity and power. Also great synthisizers and keyboards. This is just plain great maiden, you cant go by what the samples on amazon.com play, they are way off, they sound much different then the real thing. This is how maiden sounds, its just they added keyboards, what are u waiting for, if u dont own this album, get your arse to the music store and buy it now!!!! Up the Irons!!!!!

0156528207|5.0|LOVED IT,(of course that may be becouse I've only read 1 book that i didn't like)it is a very good book that I've reread countlass times, it brings the inocence of a small child together with something else that I can't quite put my finger on, sorrow maby? anyway I highly recomend this book and give it the highest praise
2070364232|5.0|Le Petit Nicolas is an excellent book.  The stories are memorable and adorable.  Readers of all ages can enjoy this book to its fullest extent.  As a french student, I have often despised french books geared towards American students with corny simplified french containing close to no plot line.  This book is perfect for all learners of french no matter what level, because though it is simple, learners can experience genuine french writing.  This book is wonderfully written, capturing the true tone and essence of youth and childhood and the stories will be remembered, reread and loved forever.
0060278234|5.0|I didn't like this book,I LOVED IT!!! it is a thrilling sequall to the book Sabreil(the first in the series),my favorite character was(well duh)the dissreputeble dog,or as mogget calls her&quot;the horrible hound&quot;, i would not, however recomend reading it before you read Sabreil, that would leave you in the dark about who oh lets say Kerrigor is *shuder*.anyway it TOTALLY laeves you hanging and in my case, clambering for more. all in all i think it was a wonderfull book and if you like(d) it I would also recomend the sevanth tower seiries also by garth nix.
0425166805|4.0|This book will really make you think! Science-fiction or science-fact, you decide!
0800141601|4.0|The story, acting, scenery, direction, action, and romance are all very well done. However the whole live for each other concept and forego any real sense of individuality is abhorrent. And why did the producers have to take what otherwise is a fabulous film and turn it into this socialist propaganda? Serve the kingdom, live for each other. Please. Lets all just move to Russia. Films like this can give some good people some bad ideas.<br />I mean I know that you have to have the traditional good and bad guys but as is very often true in life the individual is left out in the cold. Apart from the collective. It's very difficult to not be a follower.<br />But the movie is a real pleasure to watch although a little implausible in spots. Like when Lancelot rides into Malakand's camp all by himself. Then he manages to escape with the lovely lady in tow. Like that would really happen.<br />The battle scenes were a sight to see. Gere really can muster up that intensity when he needs it. The costumes and sets were all superb. It is a great adventure story and I always enjoy watching but I get turned off by the political statements that it endeavors to make.
B000001FYL|5.0|well...I haven't heard this CD for like such a long time...But i must say...It is really good! The songs like &quot;Santa Fe`&quot;, &quot;Blaze of Glory&quot;, &quot;Miracle&quot;...They've made their mark!! Being a big fan of Bon Jovi...i could even recommend their latest release &quot;Crush&quot; which is so great!!  Oh well...Bon jovi all the way!!
B00005AXEL|5.0|Wow!  What a CD.  This CD is hot, with solid music from begining to end.  While the whole CD is amazing, one song stands above the rest: Fall from Grace.  If this track is released as a single, it will blow away anything on the charts right now.  Stevie is back...thank god!
630027120X|5.0|The movie &quot;The Mission&quot; is one of the greatest movies I have ever seen.  Roland Joffe puts together an all-star cast and tells a religous story of the Guarani, a indian tribe settled deep in the Paraguay jungle.  The hero of this movie, Father Gabriel, played by Jeremy Irons, leads a group of Jesuit preists to convert this Indian tribe into Christianity.  However, the ending is a sad one due to the Spanish and Portuguese wiping out the missions as well as most of the tribe.  Robert DeNiro also plays a role in this movie as Rodrigo Mendoza.  Him and Jeremy Irons are a blockbuster duo.  The movie is filmed in the jungle with an excellent use of the camera and as well as a outstanding score.  This movie was directed with the intent to inform the audience of the hardships faced by the Guarani in this time period and accurate history.  I really enjoyed this movie and recomend it for all to see.
B00000IGGA|5.0|i was first introduced to tom waits through the 12 monkeys soundtrack: i heard \\"earth died screaming\\" and was like \\"what the [heck]?!?\\" but then a friend of mine lent this album to me, and i'm addicted. more aggressive, raunchier tracks like \\"big in japan\\" and \\"filipino box spring hog\\" make you get up and dance, \\"chocolate jesus\\" is _still_ funny after hearing it probably 150 times, and ballads like \\"hold on\\" and \\"house where nobody lives\\" are as good as ballads get. it might not be his best album, but it's still shockingly good. get this one, \\"small change\\", or \\"heart of saturday night\\" (or all three), and then check him out live. his live shows are even better than his studio albums. ... .
B000059HAI|5.0|I'm not a big war-movie buff any more (THE SEARCH FOR PRIVATE RYAN cured me) but this is a worthwhile film if you have an interest in WWII. TORA! TORA! TORA! is a documentary-type film.  Think of it as a Stephen Ambrose book recorded live. The film is neither a glorified fifties war-film (IN HARMS WAY, BATTLE OF THE CORAL SEA), nor is it a Viet Nam noir-war film (PLATOON, THE DEER HUNTER). (Neither of which are particularly authentic.)<br />TORA! TORA! TORA! recreates war from the perspective of news correspondent-participant-observer. The story is presented from both the Japanese and American viewpoints and it is presented like a History Channel film.<br />It took the film crew several months to film TORA! TORA! TORA!  I was living in Navy housing on Pearl Harbor at the time and a number of our friends and acquaintences found part-time jobs acting in the film. &quot;Real&quot; military pilots in-between rounds in Viet Nam flew some of the planes (this was 1969).<br />Much of the architecture in Honolulu was vintage WWII era or earlier and the rest of the island was relatively unchanged from the 1940s. The terrain looked very much as it had when my father-in-law passed through on his way to Guadalcanel and later Iwo Jima.<br />I cannot tell you the names of the aircraft (my husband could) but I was told that they used real aircraft from the period including the P40s the U.S. flew and the captured Zeros the Japanese flew. We drove up to Schoffield Barracks to look at the old airplanes lined up row on row. During the filming, one of these old planes crashed in a sugar cane field and burned up before the pilot could be rescued. The daily flights overhead, the real crashes, the reenactment of the destruction in the harbor, the daily flights in and out of Hickam as men and material destined for Viet Nam left and wounded and dead arrived--was all very weird.<br />Well, this is an excellent film.  The new PEARL HARBOR relies on all sorts of technology, but if you want to see how Hawaii really looked in 1941 and how the planes really looked, and how the crews really looked, and obtain some sense of how terrifying it was to be in Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941 this is the film to see.o see how Hawaii really looked in 1941 and how the planes really looked, and how the crews really looked, and obtain some sense of how terrifying it was to be in Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941 this is the film to see.

B00003CXSP|1.0|There is so much about this movie that is disheartening that I don't know where to start.  <br />Jodie Foster couldn't have helped this movie even if she had decided to reclaim her role as Clarice.<br />There were characters and events that were left out (from the book) so much to the point that you almost don't even know what point the writers were trying to make.  Not to mention the drastic plot change.<br />I think Hollywood just thought the fact that it was the sequel to Silence of the Lambs would be enough to make it do well, but it just doesn't go over at all.<br />Save your money on this one!!
B000056VIY|2.0|The only song I liked was the first single &quot;Love Don't Cost A Thing&quot;, please, just buy the single. The CD wasn't worth it.  If I could give the CD back and get my money, I would. If you still wanna get this CD, just get the bootleg, that way you won't have spent as much and wont feel so bad when you realize it was a waste of money.
6305079900|5.0|Don't buy from these people the special edition of this will be available this fall.
6303566448|5.0|I first saw this movie last fall. I rented it at the only place thathad it around my area, and thankfully it was the un-rated version. Iof course loved it immediately. I wanted to buy it, but it has beenlong since out of print. I had heard of the Elite Entertainment dvd ofit, but couldn't find it anywhere. Then two weeks ago i found it. Itwas the Elite Dvd Special edition. I was so pleased that I dropped theother dvd I was going to buy and snatched a copy of Re-Animator. Itwas pricey for a dvd, but I didn't care. I was really amazed that theyhad it, since I knew that this version had been out of print for sometime. It also seems odd that Elite would re-release it, since anchorbay entertainment is re-releasing it next year. Then yesterday I wentback and all of the dvd's were gone. This was weird since there waslike 30 of them only a week ago. Now I know this is a popular horrorfilm, but that kind of mass sell out is a bit ridiculous. Which meansthey took it off the shelves. Why did they do this? There could beseveral reasons, I really don't know. I'm just happy that I bought acopy when I did. The picture quality is very good and the specialfeatures are good also. The deleted scenes and commentary were veryinteresting. So I don't know what Anchor Bay's edition could have thatthis one didn't. A featurette maybe? I don't know. I just thought thiswhole thing of finding a very rare dvd was weird. I wanna know ifanyone else has seen it to buy anywhere? I bought mine at...  Maybethis store made a goof and wasn't supposed to distribute these dvds, Idon't know. Anyway just thought I would share this. Again, love themovie and am very happy that I found the dvd.  See ya.
B0000508U6|5.0|Every time I read a review of a Coldplay concert, or their album, the reviewer stomps all over them. I can't figure out why, since this is one of the most beautiful albums I've heard, and one of the best CD purchases I've made. Mostly the writer compares them to Radiohead, but then says that they are not anywhere near as good as Radiohead. Much like a review I read of Travis's new album, and the writer said it was the public school version of KID A (which was private school, apparently). That was the worst one. Mainly because they are all British and have pretty voices. That's like saying Nirvana and Pearl Jam were the same because they're American and had long hair and screamed a lot of their lyrics. Stop all this Radiohead a**kissing!! I know Radiohead is freaking brilliant, but just because they put out a completely baffling, misunderstood album in 2000 does not make them God....... So give Coldplay a try. I promise that you will love it.
B000002OX3|3.0|This reissue of The Who's second album is disappointing for a couple of reasons: 1. none of the songs on the album were remixed; instead they used mono masters with the exception of &quot;Run Run Run&quot; which is stereo, and &quot;Whiskey Man&quot; which is poor &quot;(...)&quot; stereo (common in those days). 2. The &quot;Ready Steady Who&quot; ep section stupidly omits &quot;Circles&quot; even though it's listed in the reproduction of the jacket. Why? <br />It's still a fun CD to listen to, caveats aside.
B00003CXQY|4.0|\\"The Emperors New Groove\\" is Almost as Witty and Fun as \\"Toy Story\\" and \\"A Bugs Life\\", but it doesn't come Close to matching them in the Animation Department. It more closely resembles An 8 minute Warner Bros cartoon Stretched to Feature Length. <br />David Spade's Dead-pan Bill Murray-ish Comedy Stylings were Spot on in Voicing Kuzco, the Groove less Emperor tuned Helpless Llama. John Goodman also fits his role well, playing Pacha, Kuzco's Loveable, Reluctant Companion... I can picture the two actors playing the same roles in a Live-Action version. (that would be Interesting to see) But from the Get-go it's Patrick Warburton (David Putty from \\"Seinfeld\\") as Kronk, the Loveable, Reluctant Henchman, who Steals the Show. His Voicing is Never short of Hysterical, not One of his lines failed to have me laughing. (except the ones I missed as I was to busy Holding my Sides)<br />\\"The Emperor's New Groove\\" gets 4 out of 5 stars as its Animation is Far from Great, it sometimes reached levels of Annoying. It represents a Lack of Faith in the Material and it cuts down the enjoyment level for Kids, and Adults. I cannot see how kids will take to this Disney effort too well, apart from the shoddy animation, the humour is very, Very Satirical. If you thought the two \\"Toy Story\\" films and \\"A Bugs Life\\" had Clever Adult Humour, then Wait till you See This. When I saw it at the Theatres, the kids were Running Wild, they Lost Interest after 10 Minutes.<br />If only Pixar had animated it, I believe it would be one of Disney's Best Films Ever, but it is Still Well worth seeing, Especially for Adults.
B000002P2W|5.0|As The Who were entering their tenth year together, it shouldn't be a suprise that Peter Townshend, battling alchohol addiction as well as what he considered rock and roll to be a young man's occupation, produced his most personal work here (in my mind, equal to John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band for sheer laying-it-on-the-line terms). Roger Daltrey (who was butting heads with Pete in the press-check out some of the interviews they were giving at the time to grasp the severity of their conflicts) sings these songs with an intuitive understanding that's never condescending towards the composer (he's a year older than Pete and must have shared some of the same feelings). Even John Entwistle's &quot;Success Story&quot; shows some resignation in the whole record-and-image making process. Keith Moon was always his happiest when he was with the band; his own personal life in shatters, he would unfornately prove Pete's lyrics to be true.<br />Not a feel-good album by any stretch of the imagination, it is an artisticly rewarding experience. And now, remixed and remastered, this CD has never sounded better.<br />HIghly recommended.
6304595247|5.0|Of all the versions of Wuthering Heights that I've seen, this version remains my favourite. It is not perfectly true to the novel, but given the fact that the novel is exceptionally difficult to film, this version is highly impressive!! This film covers the entire novel (both generations of the Earnshaw/Linton/Heathcliff families). Ralph Fiennes is the ideal Heathcliff, and Juliette Binoche gives an entertaining and dramatic performance in the roles of Catherine/Cathy. Janet McTeer as Nelly, Simon Shepherd as Edgar, Sophie Ward as Isabella, Jason Riddington as Hareton, and Jeremy Northam as Hindley are all perfectly cast. Sinead O'Connor takes on an interesting role in narrating the film as Emily Bronte -- an interesting twist which I think works wonderfully well. The filming is lush, the costumes are beautiful, the acting remarkable, and the script exceptional. Highly reccommended for Wuthering Heights fans!!
B000002AGB|5.0|I can appreciate people's opinions on whether \\"Live At Leeds\\" is a better CD in terms of sound quality (it is) and maybe even performance wise (I personally give \\"Wight\\" the nod). But an \\"off night\\"? Gimme a break! Check out the CD's liner notes for Ray Manzarek's (the keyboard player for The Doors, who also performed) take of the Who's performance. <br />To totally appreciate this concert I recommend seeing a video of this performance. Although the running order is horribly mangled (a story in itself) it gives you an even better idea of what a fantastic concert it really was, through Pete Townshend's obvious enjoyment of playing (he destroys his guitar-but only out of frustration because his pedals quit on him!) to Moon's incredible, NOT AWFUL, drumming. And while you're at it, check out the video of Jimi Hendrix's performance at the Isle of Wight. His look of disgust through every song he performed is the very definition of \\"Off Night\\".<br />Take it from an admittedly die-hard fan; \\"Live At Leeds\\" is a great live performance no doubt about it. But don't let that stop you from getting this double CD because you have to have it if only for their live \\"Tommy\\" performance. An essential live recording. Period.
B00003CXQX|5.0|This is the most subversive and hilarious movie Disney has ever made. It mocks conventions and turns formula on its ear, and at the same time provides a non-stop barrage of slapstick humor. Kronck IS the funniest character to ever appear in a Disney flick, and the last twenty minutes of this movie make me laugh as hard as anything on film ever has (including, say, Gene Hackman's scene in Young Frankenstein).<br />The style is Disney-- you know immediately that this is from the same studio that produced Alladin-- and yet there is an attitude much more like the classic Warner Brothers than the House de Mouse. Never mind that this doesn't pretend to great emotional depth; this is a hilarious film that can be enjoyed by any age.<br />And that's no small feat. Cheesy emotional depth, mediocre music, stilted drama-- all of those failed attempts can still be rewarding. But a failed comedy is just, well, dumb instead of funny. This flick is repeatedly branded as lightweight and B or C list, but doggone it, it's hard to make a really funny movie, and this delivers the goods.
B000002P6R|3.0|On &quot;Face Dances&quot; The Who were &quot;faced&quot; (sorry) with a big problem; not with Kenney Jones but with substandard material. &quot;You Better You Bet&quot;, &quot;Don't Let Go The Coat&quot;, &quot;The Quiet One&quot;, and &quot;Another Tricky Day&quot; are good songs, but the rest are definitely below The Who's standards. The previous year, Pete Townshend released his classic solo album, &quot;Empty Glass&quot;; if he would've saved just a couple of songs from that set and used it here it would have made this album a lot stronger.<br />Of the bonus tracks offered here, the best song here is an early live version of &quot;How Can You Do It Alone&quot;. Even though it's really just a loose jam with Townshend sounding like he's making up the lyrics on the spot I found it ten times more enjoyable than the studio version. A live version of &quot;The Quiet One&quot; is also included.
0792153189|3.0|I'm a total sucker for natural disaster movies, and I was excited when I heard that this one was coming out. However, it failed to please me and I found myself just sitting there after it ended and thinking, &quot;How boring.&quot; The movie didn't do anything for me at all. If you want a good sci-fi/tear jerker, call on Armageddon, at least that movie didn't disapoint. :)
B000002OX5|5.0|This is an unbelievably cool CD, starting off with John &quot;Speedy&quot; Keene's composition, &quot;Armenia City In The Sky&quot; and never letting up on the throttle until &quot;Glow Girl&quot;. In between you have pirate radio jingles, phony jingles written by the Who (&quot;heinz Baked Beans&quot;, &quot;Odorono&quot;), one of the Who's very best singles &quot;I Can See For Miles&quot;, even a taste of &quot;Tommy&quot; (&quot;Rael&quot; which Townshend would copy in &quot;Sparks&quot;).<br />The bonus tracks have unused jingles (&quot;Coke&quot;) and strong compositions by Daltrey, Entwistle, and Moon (&quot;Early Morning Cold Taxi&quot;, &quot;Someone's Coming&quot;, and &quot;Girl's Eyes&quot;, respectively). <br />This CD has been remixed and remastered by Jon Astley and it blows away all previous editions. It also has cool liner notes by Dave Marsh.<br />Overall, a must have.
0792156684|2.0|am i the only person who absolutely wants to scream at James Cameron for not putting out a proper DVD of this movie? i mean, he puts out a double disc DVD of &quot;The Abyss&quot; but not &quot;Titanic?&quot; i would have rather he held it back from being released on DVD than release this featureless, pointless waste of money. if i wanted JUST the movie, i'd buy the VHS...DVD isn't about the movie as much as its about the FEATURES....wake up, Jim.....get on the ball here.....i wanna hear just two words from ya: &quot;Special Edition&quot;....snap to it Mr. King-Of-The-World!
B00005B6C9|5.0|What a joy to listen to this cd! I have been dismayed by several of the Bee Gees albums over the last several years. But these guys show they can create some of THE best listening music ever. Every song crafted with color and thought. The album hits with some of the old style (Wedding day) with songs I wouldn't know where the Bee Gees (Man in the Middle, Deja Vu). If you wanna hear the brothers at their best, This is it! No weak songs in this CD!
B000059Z8J|5.0|This movie is a true classic. Incorporating everything audiences have come to love about superhero films, it simply takes you back to a place and time that can be so easily forgotten.  After years of viewing films that just seem to miss the mark entirely when transferring a classic comic book hero to the big screen, this movie is the true master of the genre.<br />From the opening credits I was blown away by the improvement of the sounds effects!  It's unbelievable hearing this after having listened to my old VHS tape over the last 12 years!  Scene after scene has been re-mastered and it's truly something to be appreciated after hearing everything in mono on my old TV and VCR.  The scenes of planet Krypton being destroyed by the red sun is breathtaking!<br />Now onto the added scenes: I was a little confused by previous reviews saying the studio only added 8 minutes of footage.  THIS IS NOT TRUE!  This disc does have the coveted Superman saves Valerie Perrine scene, it's just not included with the finished movie.  Having seen the ABC version of the film years ago, there really isn't anything missing unless I AM missing something.  The scenes of Jor El and the counsel is engaging and gives the momentum of the disastrous destruction of Krypton a more emotional feel instead of just seeing a bunch of Kryptonians you don't even know fall into the abyss.  One scene I had completely forgotten about, was the scene where they show Lois Lane as a child sitting next her mother on a train watching the teen aged Superman (Clark Kent) running faster than a locomotive.  In the original movie, it just shows the girl as a &quot;just a little girl&quot; and not &quot;Lois Lane.&quot;  That scene is just so cool!  I don't know why:)  Another scene I completely forgot about was the scene where Clark Kent is standing outside a store watching a TV and the crowd is standing there in disbelief seeing a man fly through Metropolis and a man turns to Clark Kent and says something to the effect of how unbelievable it is and Clark says &quot;It's not so unbelievable.&quot; or something like that;)  The added scenes are great and effective, I think fans will especially love the scene with Lex Luthor trying to destroy Superman in his lair.  Just too cool!<br />The commentaries are great, very effective and informative.  I am not one to listen to the commentaries simply because I love watching &quot;just the movie.&quot;  But the commentary gives a lot of interesting information to the making of the film that film students would find real interesting.  The documentaries are real cool!  Everything and I mean EVERYTHING is covered from the genesis to the final completion of the film through three documentaries covering the beginning stages, special effects and the ongoing legacy which is and always will be the greatest super hero movie that all super hero movies are compared to!ffect of how unbelievable it is and Clark says &quot;It's not so unbelievable.&quot; or something like that;)  The added scenes are great and effective, I think fans will especially love the scene with Lex Luthor trying to destroy Superman in his lair.

B000002AQQ|5.0|This is a great collection of music for those of us of a certain age--call it younger baby boomer. We loved the movie because it evoked a time and place in an unabashedly sentimental manner. This CD is NOT the greatest music of the 60's to the 80's--it is NOT the greatest songs of the featured groups--and if you only have one CD in your collection this is not the one it should be. But for the rest of us--there isn't one song on this CD that you haven't heard a hundred times--and every one of them will bring back a time, a place, a boyfriend or girlfriend, or a vivid memory. For the price, that's hard to beat. I loved it!
6304401132|5.0|This is my absolute FAVORITE Disney movie!! It was the one I watched over and over when I was little - mostly for the fairies. Now, my favorite character has to be MALEFICENT - she is the best villain in Disney! Elegant, delightfully wicked with a voice, wardrobe and raven to be envied! Oh - and Aurora and Philip are great too *wink*. Pleeeeease, Disney, release this on DVD so us children who grew up long after it was released on the big screen can finally see it in widescreen...(and all its glory).
B00005AR3G|5.0|The title says it all.  A typically heartwarming Disney story that was just hilarious.  Safe for people of all ages, and certain to make you laugh if you watch it.  After reading the editorial, it would have been nice if the basic movie had a little more in the way of bonus features, but it's WAY worth the money.  If you don't have this one in your collection, what are you waiting for???????<br />TJG
6304316267|5.0|Cannonball Run is my absolute favorite movie of all-time!  It's a classic.  Not a movie with a lot to it - just great laughs and quite possibly the best cast ever assembled: Burt Reynolds, Dom DeLuise, Sammy Davis Jr., Dean Martin, Farrah Fawcett, Jackie Chan, Roger Moore, Jamie Farr, Terry Bradshaw, and more!  But the absolute highlight is &quot;the Doc&quot; who rides along with J.J. and Victor (Reynolds and DeLuise).  And who can resist a movie with Dom dancing to the classic Dr. Pepper Jingle &quot;I'm a Pepper...&quot;?  Simply put, this is the best there is!!!!
B00003CXPD|4.0|&quot;Billy Elliot&quot; is a fairly good, if melodramatic, film that addresses many issues, some better than others: early death of a parent, a striking caol miners' union, family dynamics, and gender identity.<br />When Billy discovers his talent and affinity for ballet at age 11, he must overcome the gender stereotyping that prevails in the small, northern-England mining town in which he lives. A tough but sympathetic ballet teacher helps him achieve enough finesse to audition at the Royal Ballet in London, but he must also overcome his father's and his brother's objections. The audition is painful to watch--it put me in mind of a similar audition in &quot;Flashdance&quot;: the same dour panel of judges.<br />Jamie Bell, who plays Billy, is delighful and a very good dancer as well. His infrequently seen smile transforms his entire face.<br />I found this movie very difficult to understand--the audio was very uneven and the British accent/dialect indecipherable at times. I am new to DVD technlogy and did not realize that English subtitles were available. That might have been distracting but would have been a great help.
0792839129|3.0|I saw the movie many years ago and thought it would be fun for the kids to see.  We ordered the original book from amazon.com and have read it to them several times. They loved the book, but the movie was not for them.  First of all, it is about 2 1/2 hours long. Secondly, it was nothing like the book (which is true for most movies), thirdly the entire &quot;child catcher&quot; thing terrified them!  My five year old was also very uspet about the children living underground and having to &quot;steal food from the kitchen.&quot;  For children this age purchase and read them the book!
B00004Y62T|2.0|I must agree with another reviewer in saying, &quot;I couldn't wait for it to end.&quot;  While I liked Jude Law in the role of Dickie, once he gets axed the movie begins to plunge past the level of mediocrity and keeps going until the end.  Honestly, I didn't find Matt Damon's performances subtle -- I don't fault him as an actor, I just think the role wasn't really suited for him, not to mention there really wasn't anything compelling about the character to begin with.  Not only is the movie needlessly long, it is in fact painfully long.  The only reason I watched it to the end is because I figured -- &quot;ok it has to be over soon&quot; (this went on for at least an hour).  By the end I didn't care if Ripley was caught or not, confessed, went on a bloody rampage, or moved to Kentucky, as long as it happened soon so that the movie would finally be over.
B000056VIY|4.0|Well certainly Jennifer Lopez has knowledge of to what is in America's mainstream and despite some people's criticism of the album, I thought the album was everything that Jennifer could offer. I mean Jennifer's vocal skill is definitely not what you would call mind-boggling, but it has just enough power to verbalize and articulate each word and makes the album pleasing to the ears. I will narrow down my best choices on this album, &quot;Love Don't Cost A Thing&quot; is a very themetical song with a strong R&amp;B flow, and don't forget the 1980's influenced &quot;I'm Real,&quot; the dancefloor smash &quot;Play,&quot; and &quot;Walking On Sunshine&quot; is another hit, &quot;I'm Gonna Be Alright&quot; sounds like a song you would listen to when you are recovering from a relationship, listen to her vocals on this track! &quot;That's The Way&quot; very R&amp;B, and hopefully will be released as a single. Buy this album, and give it a few listens, and you will soon discover that this album certainly is a gem!
B00003CXSP|3.0|...but pretty darn satisfying as a gross-out slasher movie.  Nothing comes close to the eerie suspense and phychological drama of the the original -- and, in fact, it doesn't even seem that Hannibal is really trying to.  While Julianne Moore adopts the southern accent and tough female agent devoted to her work attitude of Starling, she doesn't play the role with the same subtleness or intelligence as Foster did.  Also, the relationship between the two isn't true to the original -- while in first Starling only fosters (no pun intended, har har) a trust with Lecter so to use him as a means to an end (and do her job), here it seems like they have forged an emotional bond and she wistfully and almost fondly remembers their time together.  Also here we see the &quot;he's a homicidal maniac but his heart is in the right place&quot; side of Hannibal  After all, he only kills people who are REALLY asking for it.  However, the movie can be enjoyed as what it is, a gory but entertaining romp - that is, if you are entertained by seeing people disemboweled, gored by ravenous pigs, and eaten alive.  Not only does the gross-out potential soar, but the cinematography is gorgeous (as you might expect from Ridley Scott) and Florence is an especially beautiful setting.  So if all you want expect from the movie is a big-budget, pseudo intellectual, gory slasher flick, you won't be let down.
6302581907|5.0|Sister Act can easily be classified as one of the 90's better comedies filled with laughter that can surpass the likes of most movies out today. Whoopi Goldberg is as always hilarious and portrays Delores Van Cartier, a naive lounge singer who's boyfriend is a married mafioso (but she doesn't know this), and later she witnesses a murder commited by him which caused her to run to the police, who in turn stashed her in a church in San Francisco against her will. Mother Superior (Maggie Smith) takes her into the church, and discuises her as a nun with a phony alias: Sister Mary Clarence. The trouble comes later when Mother Superior doesn't like the decision to transform the out-of-tune (she improves their vocal skill) nun's choir into a funky retro 60's girl group. If you want a hilarious comedy, filled with laughter a minute, I will recommend this.
B000022TSF|4.0|&quot;Chinatown&quot; is one of Hollywood's most over-rated films. Yes, it is superbly made, the script is a model of tightness, the actors are wonderful, the sense of Santa Ana heat nearly palpable. It's a well-upholstered bit of craftsmanship, although there's hardly anything unique in that. Hollywood has never lacked the ability to mount elegantly expensive productions. What it has consistently been incapable of is transcending popular forms, of giving us something *more* than just a handsome piece of entertainment. &quot;Chinatown&quot; is no exception.<br />For, in the final analysis, &quot;Chinatown&quot; is nothing but a meticulously engineered pastiche of a hard-boiled detective story. Don't get me wrong, I love detective fiction. I just don't think it should be sentimentalized into anything more than it is. If the film has any claims to distinction at all, it is for its creamy style, not its slightly atypical focus on the seedy, rotten and hypocritical aspects of American life. Since Hollywood doesn't usually like to show America as anything other than a sunny, adolescent playground, however, the film's mildly critical gestures may seem more insightful than they are. <br />There is nothing radical or subversive about this criticism. In fact, quite the contrary. Recognizing that money buys power and that the powerful frequently get away with much for which the rest of us are punished is hardly profound. It is a message with which we all could agree before entering the theater. There really isn't much more to &quot;Chinatown's&quot; social critique than spinning this truism into an intricate spider web of complicity. To compensate for genuine insight, Towne and Polanski kink up the story a bit, giving the it the veneer of the new and the specific, while also turning corruption into something safely personal. Such mild criticism in fact *confirms* people's preconceptions by repeating a common sense recognition while conveniently locating it somewhere else. Decadence becomes the problem of a few misguided individuals; the rest of us would be fine if we could just get rid of those bad guys. <br />Of course, to expect radical criticism of American society from a big-budget, star-studded Hollywood production is, to put it mildly, naive. That is my point: the bottom line is that &quot;Chinatown&quot; is limited by the middle-brow mind set of the industry that produced it, the requirement to make money, the need to please. The very care exercised in its production insures its expense; its expense requires a large return on investment; the requirement for a large audience makes impossible any criticism that might deeply offend anyone. &quot;Chinatown&quot; is posh, sexy entertainment, a very good film to be sure. As it unabashedly caters to people's prejudices, however, it proves it is far from being a great one.
0004723724|5.0|By far, the is the best compilation of Oscar Wilde's works.  His witty style is still refreshing and captivating.  Best of all, you get all of Wilde's work in one beautifully-bound package!  If you're a fan of Oscar Wilde, then I highly recommend this for your library.
2070364232|5.0|Le Petit Nicolas is an excellent book.  The stories are memorable and adorable.  Readers of all ages can enjoy this book to its fullest extent.  As a french student, I have often despised french books geared towards American students with corny simplified french containing close to no plot line.  This book is perfect for all learners of french no matter what level, because though it is simple, learners can experience genuine french writing.  This book is wonderfully written, capturing the true tone and essence of youth and childhood and the stories will be remembered, reread and loved forever.
B00000BKDV|3.0|Piece of Mind is your averge Maiden Album, no less but certainly not more. <br />Maiden were real big at the Time this album came out, due to the hughe Success of NUMBER OF THE BEAST. With Bruce at the helm they had become the best metal band ever, even if that word didn't even exist when Maiden started. PIECE OF MIND has them taking no prisoners, trying to establish their status as Metal Band No.1. They suceed, halfway. <br />Piece of Mind is Nico's entrity into Maiden and he shows off brilliantly on all 9 songs. Bruce is on top of his value but he overdoes himself way too much. The album opener &quot;Where Eagles dare&quot; demonstrates just what people either love or hate about him, his high-pitch yelling often borders on the line of pretitiousnes. He's a brilliant singer, perhaps one of the best in Rock, but his aims at a &quot;air raid siren&quot; are pretty hard to listen . He doesn't need this  at all, and he shows  in &quot;Revelations&quot; and &quot;Still Life&quot;. Unfortunately, nearly every song here has a chorus that makes you wish he wouldn't try. &quot;Die with your Boots on&quot; is a prime example. However, once his vocals have grown on you this album still doesn't deliver enough to deserve all the praise.<br />&quot;The Trooper&quot;, &quot;Flight of Icarus&quot; and &quot;Revelations&quot; are the only real highlights on this album. The rest is either average, &quot;Quest for Fire&quot; is even one of the worst Maiden songs ever. That song alone demonstrates how Metal often overdoes itself in clichès and sillyness. None of that was on Maiden's previous albums. &quot;To tame a Land&quot; tries hard to be another &quot;Hallowed be thy Name&quot; but needless to say, it fails. &quot;Sun and Steel&quot;, &quot;Die with your Boots on&quot; and &quot;Still Life&quot; are good songs but they aren't entirely up what Maiden are capable of.<br />All in all, this is a solid but pretty flawed album. I wouldn't want to live without it but it really isn't one of my most-played Maiden albums. If you are new to Maiden try &quot;Number of the Beast&quot; or &quot;Powerslave&quot;. &quot;Piece of Mind&quot; should be saved for the last in Maiden's prime time.
B00000DR52|5.0|&quot;The Last Emperor&quot;'s soundtrack consists of music that is really &quot;East Meets West&quot;... <br />Every track is special... You can hear chinese instruments, like the pipa and erhu, playing at this moment and then through smooth transition western instruments, like the violins, take over the melody... The melodys sound very Chinese in most of the tracks, while some of the tracks sounds really western... Good mix!<br />What impress me most is the track entitled &quot;Main Title Theme [The Last Emperor]&quot;... It gives listeners an imperial China feel and it is really relaxing.<br />Most of all, I think the music written for this movie is the best I have ever heard... You can hear lots of effort being put in writting it. It also sounds better than the soundtrack of &quot;Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon&quot; as it does not attempt to squeeze in any so called pop songs to destroys the whole effect of the soundtrack.<br />Finally, the music here is what I really called &quot;East Meets West&quot;... Buy this soundtrack! You will be surprised at how the composer managed to mix eastern and western instruments together to produce such beautiful music!
B0000524E5|3.0|The previews of Coyote Ugly looked pretty good, so I went out and rented the DVD.  The movie turned out to be pretty good, as long as you let your brain take a rest.<br />The storyline of the movie seems pretty basic: young girl goes to New York to make it big as a songwriter, and ends up working in a bar to make ends meet.  The bar isn't just any bar though, it's Coyote Ugly, where the barmaids dance on top of the bar and hose down anyone asking for water. Eventually she finds herself a sexy Australian boyfriend and gets the chance to perform her song.<br />The movie is actually pretty entertaining, Piper Perabo makes an excellent Violet, and John Goodman is good as her father.  Coyote Ugly makes me wish there were bars where I lived like that; I'd have a reason to go to one if there were.  The soundtrack has a lot of upbeat music, which helps the movie keep its upbeat feel.<br />I found two disappointments in the movie, the first being that Piper Perabo doesn't sing in the movie; Leanne Rhimes does all the singing. I was hoping Perabo would sing, as there don't seem to be a lot of actors that sing and act anymore.  <br />The second disappointment was the lack of character development in everyone but Violet and her father.  They're fairly well developed, you know about how Violet grew up, and how he father acts towards her, but the other barmaids, the boyfriend, and the owner of the bar seem one dimensional.  You know that the barmaid that's leaving (Tyra Banks) is going to law school, one barmaid has problems with anger management, and the other one is a blond tease. That's about it though, and the owner isn't any better. She only keeps things in the bar that she drinks, and if you have the DVD and watch the deleted scenes, you find out how she got the bar.  The boyfriend (Adam Garcia) is probably the third best developed character in the movie, but they don't really develop him until near the end.<br />All in all, Coyote Ugly is a good movie to watch, as long asyou're not the type to pick apart movies.  It doesn't have a heavy plot, and there's enough eye candy for both sexes to make the movie worth watching for most people.
B00004Z459|5.0|This is the best CD I have ever bought.  Most rap/rock group have one frontman that can either sing really well but can't rap, or can rap but can't sing.  Linkin Park has two frontmen that are the best at what they do and they rock so hard. Chester's incredible voice and Mike's ryhmes make this band the best out there.  Every single song sounds like just as much time and heart was put into as the next.
0451191153|5.0|One of the best books I've ever read; it changed my life.  Some of the other reviewers I doubt have even read the book.<br />For my money, the only book of equal quality written in the last 100 years is her Atlas Shrugged.
B00000G3PA|2.0|This ranks right up there...as one of the all time over-rated movies ever. I usually don't go along with critics, I prefer to see a movie and make my mind up, but this is one time I wish I had listened to them. This film is a corny, stereotypical overwrought potboiler. Michael Bay's roots in directing commercials show in the obvious attempts at emotional manipulation. He cops his moves from films like The Right Stuff and Hellfighters with none of the flair or style. Of course in the trailer for Pearl Harbor he actually rips his own movie off.<br />Bruce Willis gives a fine performance, he's been in so many stinkers he makes it look easy. Billy Bob Thornton on the other hand does a poor job of delivering his corny lines with any authority. The rest of the cast is typical of this genre, all stereotyped single dimensional characters. They do have funny moments occasionally.<br />The action is tiresome and after awhile I felt like Michael Bay was literally beating me with a tire iron... .
0792153189|5.0|Yeah sure, this film has the same &quot;earth killer&quot; plot and storyline as most of those type of films do. But DEEP IMPACT is unique and a stand-out in some way. Some teenagers from an astronomy club at a high school discover a comet that is headed straight for earth (surprise, surprise!) and is powerful and large enough to destroy the earth and all of mankind (surprise, surprise again!). Now the world must find a way to stop the comet and destroy it before the comet destroys them! I know, I know...like I've said before: your typical &quot;earth killer&quot; film. But there is other stuff that happens in the film so it's not all about the comet. In DEEP IMPACT, the person who actually first discovers the comet is a young teenager named Leo (Elijah Wood) and when it is time to evaccuate his home, he is able to take his family with him to the shelter that the US government has built to protect a certain number of people but has to marry his girlfriend, Sarah (LeeLee Sobsiski), in order to protect her and her family, too. When files get messed up, and they can't take Sarah's family with them, Sarah must decide whether to go with her husband or stay with her family. <br />The rest of the main cast includes Jenny Lerner (Tea Leoni), a young reporter in search for her father, and the president of the United States (Morgan Freeman). DEEP IMPACT is an excellent film with a good, solid storyline and plot, as well as a solid screenplay, and amazing visual and sound effects. Definitely a film worth debating on buying, and if not, than at least renting it (multiple times!). Fantastic film! I loved it a lot.
0452282195|3.0|Having blue eyes myself, it's hard for me to comprehend why someone would want to change the beauty and uniqueness of oneself.  Yet, the authors explination of young Pecola's life gives the answer to that statement.  Pecola is growing up in a rough household in which her parents constantly argue, her brother constantly runs away, and Pecola hides behind her &quot;ugliness.&quot;  The young girl feels that if only she could conform to the societies ideal beauty her family life would change into a more loving and caring enviroment. Since the society looks upon &quot;Shirley Temples&quot; as the ideal beauty, Pecola feels that if only she would have blue eyes she would be beautiful and all her problems would go away.  I felt that even though this book takes place in the 1940s, the same problems exist for young girls growing up today.  The tall skinny supermodel look is something all young girls of the 21st century strive for.  Just as in the 1940s the ideal beauty was to be white with blonde hair and blue eyes.  I feel that the descriptions of this book may not be appropriate for children, but a mature young adult would find it educational.
B000002U82|5.0|Are you nuts?  You need to read a review to determine whether to purchase this CD or not?  Buy the CD already.  I have listened to it literally hundreds of times.  First on  album, then 8-track, then cassette and now CD.  I have not worn the CD out yet.  Buy the CD.  You won't regret it.
0684833395|4.0|I read this book as an assigned novel in high school, around 27 years ago. I tried and tried to get into it, but couldn't get past the first chapter. <br />Face it, the first chapter ain't the best in the book. The first two people we meet are the Texan and the Soldier in White.  The dullest people in the book--the soldier in white, by definition! <br />One day, I had an essay due on Catch-22. I'd cribbed most of the contents from other sources, but needed a few quotes to add credibility and bulk. So I opened the book somewhere in the middle and started to read at random. I think the chapter I picked was the one about Milo. And I was hooked. I found several quotes, submitted the essay, and returned eagerly to the text to read the rest for my own satisfaction. <br />Maybe all of you who find Heller's narrative structure disjointed should do the same. Or simply treat the whole thing like a book of essays and read them at random, saving the one in which Nately dies for last, naturally. (It's labelled \\"Nately\\", BTW)<br />Isn't it funny? After all these years I can still remember all the characters, many of the jokes, and can certainly remember the point. Testament to a great work of art.
B000059WOD|5.0|Linkin Park is my favorite band. They're so awesome. I didn't even like alternative untill I found out about them. Their music is really cool and it gets you pumped up. All the songs on the cd are awesome. This cd is really good. You have to get it. It's really good because it's not like heavy metal stuff, it's just awesome alternative. Linkin Park rules. I'm waiting for Linkin Park to come out with another cd.
0684853523|4.0|Stephen King has lots of good advice about the writing life and craft here. One of his best tips is to take &quot;Elements of Style&quot; to heart and keep things short and to the point. King also addresses political correctness at one point, wondering what Strunk and White would think of its clunkiness.<br />That's why it's so painful to endure school-zone speedbumps like this (Page 124, fourth paragraph):<br />&quot;With adverbs, the writer usually tells us he or she is afraid he/she isn't expressing himself/herself clearly, that he or she is not getting the point or the picture across.&quot;
0385486804|5.0|I found this book facinating.  You are really drawing into Chris' life.  For me it was a real page turner.  Get it if you like real life mystery, adventure and discovery!
B00005AXEL|5.0|Stevie's wrong, there is no trouble in Shangri La.  This record is perfect!  TISL has everything to offer, from straight-ahead rock like Fall From Grace to soft acoustic musings, as in It's Only Love.  It contains numerous exquisite Stevie soon-to-be classics - my personal favorite, Bombay Sapphires; I Miss You; Planets of the Universe; Love Is.  Everyone can find something to like in this album, from Stevie's traditional mystical stories  - &quot;Before the dawn of separation / Brings up the wind / Rises around you / I hear there's trouble in Shangri La...&quot;  - to a narrative of a lesson from Tom Petty himself!  It's impossible not to love this album.
0066620694|4.0|Christensen not only shapes the thinking of the business community, but by default, may shape the thinking of the educational and service arenas as well.  He shares that it is precisely the attributes that make a firm successful in an incrementally advancing marketplace, that make it difficult for it to appreciate oblique new markets.  Ultimately, at times, the new market consumes the existing mainstream or core market of the firm.  This principle may work in the educational arena as well, where non-traditional universities or corporate universities are beginning to shoulder a portion of the corporate professional development workload.  Fortunately, for members of the status quo in contemporary business firms, the author also provides mitigating strategies.

It is no longer enough to know your business or industry, but you must also be able to detect &quot;disruptive technologies&quot; in all aspects of organizational life.<br />Other reviewers have shared the mechanics of Christensen's research, but, more importantly, it is critical to know that this book will widen your view, increase your perception, and, perhaps, create a touch of anxiety.

6305736650|5.0|If this isn't perfection then I don't know what would be. Like all great stories, it is the vivid characters you remember. Rick, the cynic with a heart of gold. Ilsa, the sweet,loyal wife with a secret past and a difficult present. Heroic idealists. Charming crooks. Danger (when this was made there was a real chance the Nazis would take over the world). An exotic setting. Romance, oh, yes God, romance of the kind that we all dream about (I would adore being Ilsa in Paris!), but romance elevated, finally, to something even better by selfless nobility in someone you wouldn't suspect capable of it at first. Don't be put off by the age of this film. After you dry your tears at the end, you will feel more hopeful about what human beings are capable of at their best.

B000002UZ6|4.0|This is a great disc from start to finish, but too many Tina Turner hits are missing. They should make it a double disc which includes all her hits, not just a selection.
6304711905|4.0|Obviously the movie is great, and often underrated.  But as for the DVD, beware that the disc isn't encoded with Dolby Digital 5.1.  Instead, it's just Dolby Surround.  I had gotten lax about checking before I bought, and I had begun to assume that every DVD had 5.1, so I didn't discover this until it was too late.   I wonder why they didn't include DD????

A great dance album by the way, very dreamy (recalls the great &quot;Neon Lights&quot; from The Man Machine release), and still more satisfying that most of the techno available out there.  <br />If humor is to be found in the march of death played by insatiable commerce, I guess it is herein.

6302814359|2.0|I was very disappointed in this sequel. Actually, rather than being a sequel, it's a slight varied version of the original. It lacks the humor of RETURN OF THE LIVING DEAD, and the actors don't appear to be as enthusiastic as in the first one. Basically, a tremendous letdown.
0385484518|5.0|I found myself moved to tears by the love, simplicity and honesty of this wonderful story.  Morrie's courage to face life and death head on was truly inspiring. The writing style of the author, Mitch Albom, gave me a sense of my being present to the life inspiring conversations between Morrie, the teacher and Mitch, his \\"student of life.\\"  Theirs is a classroom, where the teachings of life are simple and where one can learn to appreciate each moment.  <br />If you enjoyed \\"Tuesday's With Morrie,\\" I highly recommend reading Ariel &amp; Shya Kane's book called \\"Working On Yourself Doesn't Work.\\"  This book is a practical guide to finding and maintaining true satisfaction in your life, without \\"working\\" for it.
0792844793|5.0|BLUE VELVET is one of the greatest horror films. As a portrait of madness, it ranks above something like SILENCE OF THE LAMBS, for its principal madman is far more mundane and far less easy to understand than any clinically-described serial killer. David Lynch proved, with this film, that he is one of the world's best movie makers. I never fail to be amazed by this movie. The performances are excellent, each and every one, especially those by Laura Dern, Isabella Rosselini, Kyle Maclachlan, and the unbelievably frightening personna of Frank Booth as portrayed by Dennis Hopper, in what is likely his best film performance. Jack Nance and Brad Dourif have creepy roles as Hopper's side-kicks. If you've never seen this one, I heartily recommend it.
6305907145|1.0|I so wanted to like this movie...But alas, attempts to &quot;modernize&quot; Miss Austin's novel with nudity, sex scenes and graffic depiction of sexual abuse of slaves leaves me cold.  The director seemed to have a general lack of regard for the sensibilities of the period. The overall effect was the fractured feeling that the movie couldn't decide in which century it wanted to reside. My advice is to steer clear of this adaptation and read  &quot;Mansfield Park&quot; for yourself.
B0000524E5|2.0|Okay, I'm a sucker for John Goodman, and he's by far the sexiest in the cast.  I'll admit that I enjoyed the movie mainly because (a) I did not actually pay for the rental, and (b) I was consuming large amounts of alcohol at the time.  To the film's credit, even in my drunken stupor I could tell that the scenes in which Piper pretends to sing were incredibly corny.  I think I remember falling off the sofa and landing on my head from the extreme cheese-ness.  You know?  The kind that makes your skin crawl?<br />In true Bruckheimer form, Leanne Rimes organizes a high-speed train robbery which results in a spectacular car wreck involving two commercial airliners and the Seattle Space Needle... but I don't want to spoil it for anybody.  See it for yourself (read: do not see this for yourself).  Two stars.
0553208845|5.0|Herman Hesse's &quot;Siddhartha&quot; is one of the greatest tales of self-discovery, love and the meaning of life.  &quot;Siddhartha&quot; is loosely based on the lives of Gotama Buddha and the author, and describes the journey of Siddhartha as he looks for the meaning of life, hoping to achieve a greater state of being known as nirvana.  What makes &quot;Siddhartha&quot; such a remarkable story is that it is not like a novel, but rather a manual to find your soul It is not simply the story of one man, but the story of all men for eternity and their quest to find eternal happiness and the answer to the question: What is my purpose in the world?<br />This was a remarkable novel because Hesse is able to tell a tale about a character living hundreds of years ago, and make it relevant today.  This book should be read by high school students around the world because it can teach people to listen to themselves.  It is not relevant only in Indian culture but in every culture around the world.  It can show students that knowledge and wisdom are completely different.  Knowledge is something that can be obtained by listening to teachers and parents.  Wisdom however, can only be obtained by living life for you, though experience.
6305428298|5.0|I saw this film 3 times in the movie house and it was among the first I purchased when I bought a DVD player... Caine, Blethyn, MacGregor and Horrocks are all at their best in this film(husshhh; Blethyn a bit better than the others...) For anyone, everywhere, who has lost a friend, a loved one(here a father) it isn`t hard 2 identify oneself with Laura(LV). The stunning thing is that the film could have been about ME in that department. I have always listened 2 Judy Garland - especially when the World has been against me. And by God that voice has helped me. Enough of the similarieties... When Laura gives the all-stops performance, it is a creative outlet and the LP`s doesn`t mean that much anymore. As Billy explains; there are people ALIVE who fancies (read: him) LV. Cause in a a way: Judy, Shirley and Marilyn represents LV`s Dad and she can`t allow herself 2 be rid of him. 2gether with Billy, she opens one of the pigeons cages and set them free - a metaphore really - LAURA  IS  FREE(she frees herself  from her mental and motherly blocks) The music selections are fine and personally I fully enjoy the tribute 2 Judy(though Jane is not up 2 Judy`s level singing the legend`s songs. The music is nicely arranged though). The DVD offers a &quot;making of&quot; and as said, Brenda Blethyn is the standout(compare the fiction personality and Brenda`s own). It is a treat that can be watched - and will by me - repeatedly.
B00005221M|2.0|For those of you who've never seen this movie, or do not own it, this is a great flick, and definately worthy of joining your collection.  The end scene will make you gasp,cry,cheer, and will make you want to watch the whole thing all over again. For those of you who own this movie on VHS, DO NOT BUY the DVD.  If you are a big fan of this movie, you will be severely disappointed.  The addition of scenes was nice, but the director's cut DELETED some of the best parts of the movie.  Hawkeye no longer tells duncan &quot;One day you and I are going to have a serious disagreement&quot;, a line that I thought was one of the best in the movie.  The &quot;i will find you&quot; song has been taken out and replaced by the same tune used in the end and beginning.  There are many other small deletions that are hard to catch, but leave you feeling that something is missing.  The first time I watched it, I was so furious I almost stuck the DVD in the microwave, but I guess that's because I'm such a huge fan of this movie.
0440219078|3.0|I find the book OK: The book is written in an understandable language. The topik of the book is interessting. But I dislike the open-end, because some questions aren't still answered.<br />I like the book and I think it is very interesting. If you know the content it is very simple to understand. I didn't like the open-end.It is a actuell novel which is written in a easy way.
0452282152|4.0|This story reads very well. Not much under the surface, but definitely entertaining.  Made me want to learn more about the artist.  A quick and easy read that I enjoyed despite my usual tendency towards &quot;deeper&quot; books.
0385474547|4.0|This celebrated novel is far from the best book I've ever read but at the same time provides some serious insight into the Imperialistic movement in Africa both at the time the novel was written and now. True, Achebe can drag out descriptions about the customs of different tribes etc, but lets afford him that because he has the obligation to not only write great prose but also provide a little bit of the African culture to the Western world as an ambassador of African literature. The novel is frighteningly vivid in its descriptions, well thought out in terms of political ideals, and a valuable piece of evidence in the argument about the clash of cultures in Africa.
B000002ADT|5.0|I have few words to say about this cd. This is the first jazz album i have purchased and i have listened to it almost every day since i got it. This album and Miles Davis's music is timeless. The divine sounds on this record flow effortlessly from these genius musicians. New meaning is found after every listening.<br />Needless to say, anyone and everyone should have this cd, whether a you're an avid jazz fan, or you've barely even heard jazz music in your life, you should this cd as soon as possible.It will stay with you forever.
B000059XUI|4.0|Why didn't Warner treat this highly regarded sequel with the same respect as SUPERMAN THE MOVIE? Many[and I'm one of them] think this is just as good as the first one. But all we get is a trailer as a specail feature. It being common knowledge that there are tons of outtakes, why didn't we get any, or the expanded version that has shown up on television? I hope Warners rethink their decision and re-release this with the treatment it deserves.
0792151712|5.0|After reading most of the reviews of this fantastic movie, I realize how much mainstream society has been corrupted by cynicisim and flat-lined emotionally.  The acting was the way society behaved in the post-Victorian era.  It would have looked mighty strange for Jack to say something like &quot;Cool!&quot;, now, wouldn't it?  I like the juxposition of modern time to 1912, because, then, you can see the difference and the contrasts of behavior and mannerisms.  I think that Leonardo DiCaprio was just fine as Jack.  It would have been totally out of character to try a method technique or a classic Shakesperean approach.  Remember, the character was only in his late teens-early twenties,tops.  If you look at pictures of some of the real passengers of that general age-group, some even looked younger, so I have no problem with it, myself.  It's just that people nowadays seem to perceive life through their own narrow-mindedness and shallow feelings.  I absolutely thought this movie gives us a different perspective than most of the idiotic, violence-oriented junk that has de-senseatized society.
0446677450|4.0|I found this book to be straight forward in it's explainations. The discussion on assest vs liabilities is excellent. I have recommended this book to friends
0452281881|5.0|Without a doubt, the funniest book I've ever read. So much that it seems to have ruined all other books for me.<br />Throughout, we follow the antics of the people at the Miller Shanks ad agency. There's sex, backstabbing, bizarre office politics, that one guy who just tries so hard to be your best friend, the one secretary that thinks the world begins and ends with her, and yet more backstabbing.<br />With subtle and intelligent humor, 'e' succeeds as being hysterically funny without trying too hard. It's brillince lies with keeping countless stories together, building up to the eventual Coke campaign and scandal involving a saucy cabel channel. The characters have unique personalities and styles of writing. Where other e-mail based novels fail - in having perfect grammar and spelling, while also being sickeningly formal - 'e' gives a realistic view at the electronic age, not to mention office politics.<br />As the blurb says, &quot;E is a tapestry of insincerity, backstabbing and bare-faced bitchiness&quot;. It's an agency that would &quot;sell their grandmothers in a car boot sale&quot; to land the Coke account. Above all, it's &quot;one pitch nobody will ever forget&quot;. No kidding.<br />Besides, how can you pass up a novel by a guy who's &quot;been fired by some of London's leading ad agencies&quot;?
B0000508U6|5.0|This is an awesome CD! As soon as I heard &quot;Yellow&quot; I knew Coldplay would become a favorite. So I got the CD and  they did. I love Coldplay and I don't know anyone who doesn't like them. The CD rocks, and is perfect for any mood. Go buy this CD!! It's totally worth it:)
B000031WD9|3.0|...wait, there's a difference? Let me just say up front: if you're thinking of getting this DVD for the &quot;outrageous!&quot; material, don't bother. Maybe, after growing up in a tabloid world, it's pretty hard to create something with shock value for us young people today. Or maybe this &quot;too hot for the big screen!&quot; stuff was just weak. [I should, to be fair, point out that the little quotes are from the ads and cover in Australia. I don't know if the region 1 version promotes it this way.]<br />Anyway, I'm assuming that if you've looked this up you've already seen and appreciated the movie. So here's what you can expect from the disc:<br />Commentary by director Paul Weitz, producer Chris Weitz, writer Adam Herz and cast members Eddie Kaye Thomas, Jason Biggs and Seann William Scott - Actually a well done track, with humor and notes on the production of the film. Basically, it's like listening to a group of guys you might know with some insight on technique.<br />* Production notes - Usual stuff. If you're after some real detail, you know where to look.<br />* Theatrical trailer(s) - So you can be reminded of how hilarious it is. Chances are you were subjected to endless trailers while it was being promoted, but in case you'd forgotten here's the evidence.<br />* Outtakes - I was a little annoyed that they were shown in production format [poor sound, picture quality, ect]. None of it is really funny at all, the highlight being Jason Biggs practicing the pie scene.<br />* Spotlight On Location - Not bad. Worth watching, but you won't feel the need to give it more that a couple of views. It's mostly the actors talking about their experience while making the movie, and comparing it to their own high school years. Example quote from Alyson Hannigan: &quot;I was a walking hormone.&quot;<br />* Universal Records Soundtrack Presentation &amp; Music Highlights - Sample bits from the soundtrack. Pure promotional stuff.<br />* Classic Quotes - They're in the movie. Why bother?<br />Overall, I'd say that if you were 50/50 on if you liked this movie or not, you shouldn't get the DVD. But fans, like my brother, will enjoy it despite the slightly lacking special features. The best of which is the commentary.
6305075492|5.0|&quot;The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari&quot; is a visual feast, and a definite inspiration for many horror films to follow. This film simply grasps your attention from beginning to end. From the beginning even we know this is no ordinary film as two asylum inmates are seen, one of them narrating his experience with meeting Dr. Caligari at a local carnival, who awakens a somnambulistic maniac who commits acts of murder commanded by his master. It seems we are watching a nightmare dreamt by the minds of madness. I won't spoil too much, but rest assured you will not regret adding this one to your collection. It is brilliant in every way.
0440219078|3.0|The Giver is a very interesting novel about how our future could be one day. Theres no individual life anymore but therefore a very well structured public order which makes the life of every citizen in this new world much safer. Youll be surprised and maybe youll have some conflicts with yourself because youll realize that there are so many pros and cons.
0780619609|5.0|Great movie.  You have to see this flick.  This movie tells the story of how the turtles came to be.  The action scenes are fantastic.<br />I must admit, however, that the script is weak at times.  The two evil mutants are also rather annoying.  However, the writers/directors scored an A+ in my book when they casted Vanilla Ice as the Dance Club singer.  The Ice Man basically strapped a weak script onto his back and carried this movie to extraordinary success.<br />Vanilla's Ninja Rap is one of the greatest rap songs I have ever heard.  The Ninja Rap is definitely on par with MC Hammer's U Can't Touch This and Sir Mix-A-Lot's Put 'Em On The Glass.  <br />Buy this movie.
0140189378|2.0|In my opinion, this book is pretty boring.  However the moral of the book is really good. As the reader learns one mans struggles in the world and how he trys to overcome them.  But in the end... Read the book!!
0783235380|1.0|This is one horrible movie.  I even gave it a second chance thinking I may have missed something.  It's just as bad the 2nd time.
B00005AXEL|5.0|I missed out on pre-ordering, so I had to wait a couple of days to get this CD.  And let me say it was worth the wait!!!  This album simply is amazing!  Out of all the CDs I have, this one is the best!  It tops anything anybody has done in recent years.  I have been listening to this CD over and over.  It just simply rocks!  My very best favorites (I love all of these songs) are Trouble in Shangri-La, Fall From Grace, Too Far From Texas, Sorcerer, Planets of the Universe, and of course, Every Day.  The latter makes me think of my mom and dad and their almost 33 years of marriage.<br />I definitely recommend you get this album!  It's the most perfect album EVER!!!
B000002TQB|5.0|yeah, we've all heard how great &quot;parklife&quot; is (if you've heard of blur, that is), but some of that is brainwashing from critics and people who (mistakenly) say the band can do no wrong.  this album, however, is very much a near-perfect take on british life in the early 90s.  it's quirky, sympathetic, antagonistic, intimate, and catchy all at once.  damon and co's characters are what makes this a britpop classic.  from tracy jacks' disillusionment, to the peeping neighbors on &quot;bank holiday&quot;, to jubilee's lack of girl-awareness, there is no shortage of interesting personas to investigate.  their stories add a magical quality of personality to the record.  the music, of course, complements this whole lyrical mess, with the made-for-clubbing backbeat of &quot;girls &amp; boys&quot;, the blazing neo-punk of &quot;bank holiday&quot;, the amusement park ambiance of &quot;the debt collector&quot;, and the wonderfully subdued melodies of &quot;to the end.&quot;  the variety is quite striking, but it meshes in such a compellingly listenable way, that blur pulls off the intentional trick of capturing a wide scope of british life/culture within the mere span of fifty minutes remarkably well.  there are no real low points on this disc, and it works very much like a good novel in that respect.  fans of 90s britpop should start their collections here, as should most blur fans.  if you're looking for &quot;song 2&quot; or &quot;coffee &amp; tv&quot;, this might not appeal at first, but give it a chance, and find out what makes blur so unique and intelligent.
B00003CXPD|1.0|.... but you don't need subtitles to understand Jennifer Beals' dialogue.
B00004YM0D|5.0|This is a great sing-along CD especially right after you've won some sort of game.  Ain't No Mountain High Enough is an awesome song,but there are also other good hits such as Up Around the Bend by CCR and Na Na Na Na Kiss him Good-bye.  This CD is a lot of fun and makes you remember some of the funnier scenes from the movie.
0812550757|4.0|Speaker for the Dead is the second book in the &quot;Ender&quot; series by Orson Scott Card. It is very different in style from the much acclaimed &quot;Ender's Game&quot;, but is still an excellent story in its own right. <br />SFTD is at its core, a mystery. Why do the pequeninos butcher themselves in such a horrific manner? Why do they plant saplings where the body is? Pipo discovered the secret early on, but it is never revealed until the very end of the book. Why does Novinha act the way she does? <br />SFTD introduces new characters to the story. They are interesting people, flawed, which makes them more human. Ender interacts with these people and becomes an integral part of their lives, even though they try to reject him. Jane is also an interesting character, and I look forward to learning more about her. <br />This is a much &quot;talkier&quot; and more philosophical book than &quot;Ender's Game&quot;. If you want another &quot;Star Wars&quot; battle type of book, don't get this, but instead check out &quot;Ender's Shadow&quot;. If you would like explore questions about xenophobia, racism, science and relationships, then pick up &quot;Speaker for the Dead&quot;. You won't be sorry.<br />I should add that the end of the story more or less wraps up everything, but does set the stage for the final 4 books. Furthermore, the first 50 pages of the book are quite slow. It takes awhile to get going, but trudge through them. Once I hit page 50 or so, I couldn't put it down.
B000002LQR|4.0|I loved this album sooooo much!!! Right when I heard the opening track, I was like &quot;Oh yeah, this is good!&quot; This is the second RHCP's album I've gotten-after Californication-and I could not be more happy with these guys-they are fantastic.<br /> Every song is different, and each song is filled with emotion and real stuff.<br />My favorite tracks are number 1 and 8.<br />-Blonde In Black
B00004YKUY|5.0|I was blown away the first time I heard this album.  It's the first CD in 10 years that I can't stop listening to. After reading several of the reviews I'm puzzled how some are disappointed with Steve Augeri's performance.  It truly gave me chills.  Steve Perry's vocals have suffered noticeably on his second solo effort and with the band's last CD - Trial by Fire, which I forced myself to listen through once and couldn't listen to again.  Don't get me wrong!  Steve Perry had the best voice in the business and it was with my favorite band.  His time has come and gone.  Augeri is not merely replacing Perry, he is taking Journey back to the 70's and 80's where their vocals were at the top.   This CD's producer changed for the first time in Journey's history.  As a result, every song is fully produced.  There are tons of harmonizing, no cliched lyrics, and not one song that I can't listen to.  And notice there are 15 songs.  Most are up-tempo with the usual ballads.  My favorite is the heaviest track - &quot;All the things&quot; which hasn't been mentioned in alot of reviews.  Many people believe Journey is a &quot;ballad&quot; band.  This song shows they can rock.  All in all, this is the most solid effort for rock in general in the last 10 years.  Keep it up guys!
B00000J7JO|5.0|I have always liked the RHCP's, they are one of my favorites. This album in particular is very good! Every song is different, unlike some CD's where all of the tracks sound the same and it just sucks! But anyway, I love what they have done with this music-it is great and I highly recommend it. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars was.....well, never mind! I will give it 5 stars!!!lol There.<br />-Blonde In Black
B00005ASQ1|5.0|This movie was the best movie ever, it all depends on what type of things you are into. For me it was so inspiring, you have to see it, is wonderful. I give it 5 stars UP!!
B00004Y62T|5.0|This movie is an incredible movie that twists, turns, and shows the depths of a tortured soul.  Matt Damon plays Tom Ripley, a man who is excellent at impersonating people.  He is sent to Italy to persuade the son of a rich man; who owns a shipbuilding business; to come back to America.  The plot quickly thickens as Ripley finds himself lusting after Dickie; the son who is played by Jude Law; and his lifestyle.  After Ripley kills Dickie, Ripley ends up assuming Dickie's life.  He is nearly caught several times, leading him to kill one of Dickie's friends and to run away with another man so they can live together.<br />Ripley's homosexuality is very strongly hinted at several times, but never stated as such.  This suggestion is a constant source of underlying tension and does much to enhance the mood of the movie.<br />Damon excelllently portrays Ripley, making the character believable, and actually; in my mind; somewhat worthy of pity and understanding.  The movie is somewhat amoral, with no clearcut evil characters.   Each character is shown in all their flaws and virtues.  Excellent viewing and well worth buying!
B00000IAU3|1.0|as if anyone with a brain thinks that Dido is better than Sarah McLachlan.  Hmm, Sarah's voice actually has RANGE and she writes her own songs and plays guitar and piano which is more than i can say about Dido (wow, she can play the recorder, good for her).  Dido's voice is boring and she has to rely on other people to co-write her songs with her.  how can anyone compare Dido to Sarah, who has been around since 1988 and actually has a career?  Dido hasn't proved herself yet.
B00003CWL6|5.0|I love this movie.  I don't understand people who don't appreciate the &quot;beauty&quot; of this film.  Direction, Acting, Script, all is in perfect harmony.  I think this is as far as the &quot;masterpiece&quot; can get.  Kavin Spacey has given his best performance.  The camera work is superb.  The DVD also offers the commentary and footage &quot;Look Closer&quot; and other goodies.  Some DVDs have very stupid commentaries that I really don't care to listen, but this one is very worth listening! Just Love this film.
B000056N8X|2.0|Sorry, but while this movie was not really awfull, it is a large step down from the orginall movie, and the TV series.  As a true fan of the TV series I really think that Adrain Paul who directed as well as starred in the television version could have done a much better job than this.  This movie had no consistant tone to it.  Every time I got comforable watching the movie the movie would cut to some terribly made helicopter shot over scotland that is seen in fast forward.  <br />     The bad directing and even worse editing is frustrating because I really wanted to like this movie, and it could have been good.  Adrain Paul is one of the most impressive martial artist that I have ever seen on the big screen.  As a long time martial artist myself, I appiciate someone who shows off solid fighting skills and doesn't revert to some showy and useless gymnastics move (just one time I want to see a hero in a movie get creamed trying some stupid triple flip move.).  However every opportunity for this movie to get into a good fight scene, is ruined either by some bad special effect, or a cheesy plot gimmick.  The fight sceanes are directed like the director wanted john woo type gunfight.  This just doesn't work with swords.  <br />      Someone really needs to re-cut this movie.  A good editor could turn this into a decent movie, and I would certianly like to see this done.  Whoever thought up of showing a helicopter shot in high speed should be shot, and the person who did the backgroud music sent to and institution.
0790749815|5.0|A case of mistaken identity leads to kidnapping and more, in the suspenseful \\"North by Northwest,\\" directed by Alfred Hitchcock and starring Cary Grant.  Advertising executive Roger Thornhill (Grant) has his lunch interrupted by two men who think he's someone else, a man named Kaplan, and as they escort him from the restaurant at gunpoint to a waiting car, it's only the beginning of an adventure that will take the hapless Thornhill from New York to Mount Rushmore, and introduce him to the kind of intrigue few people experience except in the movies.  And before he's through, Thornhill will have scaled the famous monument, played tag with a crop-dusting airplane and fallen in love with a beautiful woman.  It's a classic case of an ordinary person getting caught up in extraordinary events, and with Hitchcock behind it all, you know it's going to be a thrilling ride.  And it is.<br /> With this film, Hitchcock proves once again that he is, indeed, the Master of Suspense.  With terrific foreshadowing, he has a way of tipping you off to what is about to happen, without letting you in on what's really behind the mystery.  It's part of that special touch he has that keeps it all exciting and moving along, while allowing the tension to build until the very end.  It's a precision balancing act-- keeping the story right on the wire while refusing to reveal any more than is necessary at any given point in time-- that few directors have managed to achieve so effectively.  Hitchcock has an eye for detail, an innate sense of what works and knows just when to infuse some humor into his story; but a big part of his success is also that he knows how to exact the kind of performances he needs from his actors.<br /> Grant, as expected, gives a first-rate performance as Thornhill, using his natural charm and style to great effect; It's understated, and entirely credible.  His reaction to being kidnapped is totally honest, as he affects an almost naive sense of well being even with a gunstuck in his ribs.  As you can imagine it would be in a real situation like that, he simply doesn't comprehend what's really happening.  And the transition from that point to when he fully realizes the danger he's in is extremely well handled and developed.  It's a good bit of acting by Grant, and directing by Hitchcock.<br /> Also turning in notable performances are James Mason, suave and menacing as Phillip Vandamm, Thornhill's adversary, and Eva Marie Saint, as Eve Kendall, the woman Thornhill meets on a train and with whom he becomes quite taken, not only with her beauty, but by her candor, as well.<br /> The great thing about Hitchcock is that he sets you up so beautifully and never fails to deliver.  He consistently gives you that sense that something is about to happen, and it always does.  When Thornhill is standing out in the middle of nowhere at a crossroads, surrounded by nothing but fields, and you see a crop-dusting plane making a pass in the distance, and then you see it again-- but Thornhill is paying it no attention whatsoever-- you know something is up.  And from that innocuous lead in, Hitchcock develops one of his most memorable scenes ever, brilliantly conceived and realized.  The same thing happens when Thornhill and Eve find themselves at the top of Mount Rushmore; you know they didn't wind up there by accident.<br /> The supporting cast includes Jessie Royce Landis (Clara Thornhill), Leo G. Carroll (The Professor), Josephine Hutchinson (Mrs. Townsend), Philip Ober (Lester), Martin Landau (Leonard) and Edward Platt (Larrabee).  An exciting story, some engaging performances and the indelible images this film plants in your memory, all make \\"North by Northwest\\" one of Hitchcock's finest (and that's saying a lot).  Thoroughly entertaining, it's one to which you can return time and again and still be thrilled anew.  You can always rely on Hitchcock to give you a good show, and show you a good time; that's the magic of Hitchcock, and it's the magicof the movies.
B00003CXS4|4.0|Ok right off the bat I liked this movie a lot, but come on you can't say that this is just a remake of Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels.  If you can't see the similarities, just look again cause it's pretty easy to see them.  I like how Ritchie handles this genre but I really feel that he needs to head in a new direction.  Brad Pitt has a great supporting roll and his accent is one of the best I've ever heard.  At first you think he's just mumbling, but then you realize that he's actually speaking real words.  It's amazing.
B00005AXEL|5.0|When I played TISL for the first time, I got the same feeling that I did in 1981 when I played Bella Donna for the first time.  Ms. Nicks said that she worked very hard on this album and it shows -- her voice sounds great and she worked with people who understand her and her music and who knew what to do to showcase the music, not the image of Stevie Nicks.  I liked that she went through her extensive song collection to pull songs from the early 1970's (giving the feeling of the Buckingham/Nicks era, especially &quot;Sorcerer&quot;), through the Tusk era, and to the present.  Like Bella Donna, I will be listening to this album many times to gain an appreciation for each song.  The fact that she has dumped her various baggage (drugs, in-fighting with FM bandmates) also comes through on this album, showing a new (and refreshing) focus.  This album will be worth the investment!
B00003CXQY|4.0|This movie is hilarious.  It has one of the greatest scripts I've read from a Disney movie in a long time, if not ever.  David Spade and John Goodman are great together.  Their comic timing is great and adds to the comic feel of the movie.  Patrick Warburton is hilarious as always and is the best somewhat evil, dim-witted sidekick.  The only flaw in this movie is the animation.  Disney has really let themselves go since the computers have arrived.  I think they should have a screening of Snow White for all the animators and tell them this is what our films should look like, so let's try to hit this high water mark again.
6305372411|5.0|I bought this with the mistaken thought that it was a documentary. My initial disappointment that it was actually a mini series was short lived. Quite simply, this is one of, if not the, best mini series I have ever seen. It gets in depth into the early and Apollo missions, and puts a human face on everyone involved. It really amazes me that we did this. It captures the excitment and emotions of the time. I hope I make more mistakes like this.

B00003CXN4|2.0|I was really looking forward to a director's commentary (and maybe even deleted scenes) for this particular film, but apparently it's not to be. Bronkovich lacks likewise. He must really be busy on Ocean's Eleven. Soderbergh's comment track on Out of Sight is one of the most insightful and entertaining I've heard yet on DVD.

B000002KDW|5.0|This is one of those albums that I played so many times when I was in highschool, that I not only wore out the vinyl, the album cover was constantly getting scotch taped together, and somehow that darn album sleeve was always missing. But I loved every snap, crackle, and pop of this classic album. What's not to like when you get a generous helping of country rock, R&amp;B, blues, and some good ole rock and roll. These guys had the whole package. The stinging slide guitar playing of Ron Wood (check out &quot;That's All You Need&quot;). The surging B3 organ and rock boogie piano playing of Ian Mclagan. The drumming of Kenny Jones, who later when on to replace Keith Moon of the Who. The singing of Rod Stewart, with his throaty Sam Cooke type voice, and that hairdew that looked like a cross between a shetland pony and a rooster. And the most special player of all Ronnie Lane. This guy could write some very special songs and offer his unique voice that seems to fit his music like a glove. He gave us the best song on this album &quot;Debris&quot;. Is there a better country rock song out there? I think not! It doesn't get any better than this, and I can't think of anybody more suitable to sing this than Lane. For all you country rock bands out there, don't try to remake this tune. It won't work! Ronnie Lane broke the mold on this one. Other standout tracks here are &quot;Stay With Me&quot;, which was their lone hit off this. &quot;You're So Rude&quot;, which features Ian Mclagan's always great B3 organ playing. &quot;Last Orders Please&quot;, another classic Ronnie Lane tune. And Chuck Berry's &quot;Memphis Tennessee&quot;, or as Stewart sings it &quot;Tennerrsee&quot;. It was great to finally get the CD version of this record. It was the first time in 20 years I've heard &quot;Debris&quot; and &quot;You're So Rude&quot; without the needle skips. This record easily makes it in my top 10 list of best 70's albums. 5 snaps up!
B00003CX8J|5.0|My fave film of 2000. It beat out a host of other films. Anyway -  [By the way, there is no such word as anyways] For years a good pal of mine had been talking about X-Men and not being a comic book fan, I just listened. When I saw the movie again and again, I came to like it myself. Interesting characters. Just about everyone is well-cast, and I can hardly wait to see the sequel, which I hope will be good. Mystique has one memorable line, Wolverine's impressively battle-ready, Rougue is not bad ['Are you going to kill me?'], and Professor Charles Xavier ['I'm looking for hope.'] is fantastic, but I think Magneto has the best lines in this film. 'They will return home as brothers. As mutants.' Well-written, well-acted, well-directed, and well done. X-cellent. 2000's best film, in my humble opinion.
038533348X|4.0|I very much enjoyed this Vonnegut book, although probably not quite as much as the other two that I've read, Breakfast of Champions and Slaughterhouse Five. Nevertheless, this book was witty throughout, and at the same time inspired my thoughts on the fragilty of life, the meaning of fate, and our &quot;abuse&quot; of science and the power it gives us (and what it can take away from us!)<br />A great Vonnegut book, in my opinion, and a must read for any fan.
B000002VC5|5.0|This is indeed one of the finest rock albums of all times. <br />However, something that I haven't read in any of the reviews though is the damage that was done to the master tape of &quot;I Robot&quot;.<br />I have an original vinyl copy of this album from 1977 when it was first released. When I bought the CD in the 80s I was appalled to here that at the beginning of the first track &quot;I Robot&quot;, just as it reaches a crescendo, the right and then left channel start to crack up and become distorted for a few seconds. I later listened to a vinyl record repressed in the 1980s. The distortion is there as well.<br />Those that have never heard the original release from 1977 may not even realize that this distortion is actually a damaged master tape and is not what was intended.  It's a shame that Alan Parsons has not (yet) taken it upon himself to re-record this track and correct the problem.
B000009QPE|3.0|not being a fan of metal,but of fast music,i checked this out.the cover art is typical metal,as are the lyrics,which anybody could write, and have no real meaning.i doubt they will get an emotional reaction from anyone listening.as for the music,it is fast,really fast,but i could name about 30 or more bands that are way faster.i hate overindulgent solos,and there are solos that wreak of &quot;look what i can do&quot; here,but for the most part i was suprised to find some pretty inventive and off kilter stuff.for me, i cant get into anything i cant relate to,therefore feel.its about the closest thing ill ever come to actually liking metal,as the guys in the band seem to be about something more than just rock stardom, but i could be wrong.oh yeah, one more thing.everyone talks about the intensity of this album and i just dont feel it.mabye its the lyrics.if they were a bit more personnal i would probably notice it more.so he sings about satan and hell.big deal.that kind of lyrical content only matters to those who belive that nonsense.if you want intensity,id suggest checking out a black flag record,or a sick of it all album.anyway,if you are looking for fast metalic music,and dont care about the lyrics,get this.if you are looking for the same thing,only with meaningfull,passionite lyrics,stay away.
B00000JJQK|5.0|You simply can't not have this album.  It's ridiculous to imagine a collection without it.  This album suits any mood you could be in (not just &quot;hey, let's go to the beach&quot;).  It could also help you shift your moods (especially up!).  <br />Just get it, for pity's sake.
B000002UC5|4.0|There are those who will tell you this is Macca's finest post-Beatles moment. Personally, I disagree, preferring the studio polish of BAND ON THE RUN and TUG OF WAR.<br />On the other hand, MCCARTNEY was made during the years of Macca's finest voice, when he could sing the hair off a titmouse from 1000 yards, and the songs he apparently tossed of while riding out a Beatles-breakup-induced-depression in Scotland have a quiet bounce you won't find on his later LPs. <br />And there is more than a little historic significance to MCCARTNEY that Beatle peoples (read: I) find noteworthy; it was the conflicting release dates of MCCARTNEY and LET IT BE that were the preverbial final straw for Macca and Lennono. <br />I've always had a soft spot for the instrumentals on MCCARTNEY, which allow McCartney's talent for tasty melodies to run free. <br />MCCARTNEY also carries two of my absolute favorite McCarney bits, back to back. \\"Junk\\" and \\"Singaling Junk\\" are just gorgeous, the kind of thing you'd hope La Big Mac would sing if you handed him your guitar at the end of a hard day. And \\"Maybe I'm Amazed\\" is--maybe--one of the classic performances by any Beatle or ex-Beatle. Macca's vocal on \\"Maybe I'm Amazed\\" ranks with the very best Lennon.<br />By the way, I remember watching some tired old game show around the time this LP came out, and hearing a scandalized audience react with childish giggles and gasps when the host asked the question: \\"On the cover of the new album by Beatle Paul McCartney, what can be seen peeking out of his coat?\\"<br />The answer, of course, is McCartney's new baby.
B000002HPV|5.0|all other artist make paint by the numbers concotions, compared with Bjork.  She's the true artist, fully imaginative, insipering, immpresive, and wonderful--a vocal Van Gough or Rembrant or Monet.  I don't understand how people can't like this album, or why it would take a few listens to &quot;get it.&quot;  Bjork is unearthly, yet expresses true human emotion with her songs better than anyone i've ever heard.  My favorites are &quot;5 years&quot; and &quot;Alarm call.&quot;  In &quot;five years&quot; she seems to be transcending time and distance, to be singing directly and immedietly to the listner.  &quot;I dare you to take me on.&quot;  &quot;Alarm call&quot; just makes me smile and get goosebumps.  Bjork can get funky when she wants to.  the &quot;Beep beep's&quot; are cute.  The optomism in that song overflows whatever dismal forboading is on the album.  &quot;You can't say no to hope, you can't say no to happiness.&quot;  You can't say no to Bjork!
B000009QO6|5.0|There was something absolutely intoxicating when Glenn Danzig took a stab at swaggering metallic rock-n-roll.  After becoming a punk icon (with The Misfits) and a death-rock demigod (with Samhain), his next challenge was to evolve into a rock/metal hero and take his rightful position at the throne.  Amazingly, with this self-titled debut, Glenn finally found the type of music to perfectly complement and showcase his vocal talents.  What we now know is that Danzig (the band) arose simply as a continuation of - or better yet, a logical progression from - Samhain.  The idea was apparently for Glenn to write bluesy rock tunes of pure evil and hand them over to guitarist John Christ for polishing.  To say that this was a success is a huge understatement.  This debut simply amazes rock fanatics to this day.  So what does it sound like?  Well, there is definitely a laid-back feel to most of these songs (\\"She Rides\\", \\"Soul On Fire\\", \\"Possession\\", \\"End Of Time\\"), almost with a feeling of having those blues licks dragged through the mud for a while on the way to the studio - as filthy as can be.  Even the rocking uptempo tunes (\\"Twist Of Cain\\", \\"Am I Demon\\", \\"Mother\\", \\"The Hunter\\") seem to stroll along at a rip-roaringly and indulgent pace - yet still easygoing.  Strangely, I distinctly remember this CD being an anachronism when it first came out:  the songs, the style, the \\"dirty-yet-classy\\" performance - heck, even the production - seemed to be out of time and place with everything else in the world of music in 1988.  Perhaps it was reminiscent of a bygone era when rock and roll and the blues were best of friends.  Whatever the case, the fact that it seemed out of place in '88 is surely a clue as to why it still seems fresh and timeless today.  It has stood the test of time well; it doesn't sound like a product of the 60's, 70's, 80's, or even 90's.  It simply holds its own as a great record should - for all time.  Even if it would have been released yesterday for the firsttime, it would still be as fresh and vibrant and commanding.  The true definition of a classic, for sure.  Even more amazing was the fact that this was only their DEBUT!!  Thankfully, this line-up was to dish out even more phenomenal tunes such as these for many years to come.  Rock and roll and heavy metal fans: take notice!!
6300182282|5.0|Robert Mulligan's adaption of Berhard Slade's broadway play not only shows 26 years of American history but also the personal histories of the two main characters. The stories of their lives - togheter and apart- is preseted within a kaleidoscope of feelings; everything from funny to sad and - above all - touching. Alan Alda and Ellen Burstyn brilliantly portray George and Doris and their personal crisis. Watch this and weep!
B000009QPE|5.0|So why is this record such a big deal?  Because, unlike today, when Slayer unleashed \\"Reign In Blood\\" in 1986, NOBODY sounded like this, that's why.  Fortunately, I was lucky enough to have bought this masterpiece right when it came out, so I can say from firsthand experience that the impact it had on ALL extreme music in the second half of the 80's is not exaggerated.  Songs like the jaw-dropping \\"Angel Of Death\\", \\"Necrophobic\\", \\"Postmortem\\", \\"Raining Blood\\" - heck, everything on the record - raised the bar for every single heavy metal act of the day.  All of a sudden, there was a new standard in scathing brutality, razor-sharp precision, and blazing speed in music.  As peculiar as it may seem, I sort of remember that after \\"Reign In Blood\\" had time to settle, other bands (even those who has already been established with numerous releases) began getting faster - and even that much more technical - on their post-'86 records.  If that's not a testament to Slayer's influence with this record, I don't know what is.  In summary, today's death metal is surely a faster and more brutal beast than this thrash classic, so if you are expecting this to sound like today's death standards, you might be a little under-whelmed.  How can you compare this record to the second or third generation of bands that have borrowed from Slayer and what they were doing while today's metals heroes were still in diapers?  Yet in spite of that, another sure sign of Slayer's brilliance is that \\"Reign In Blood\\" can still hold its own even today.  Quite simply, the reason it is still regarded so highly in all circles of extreme music is that, when it came out, \\"Reign In Blood\\" was a frightening new sound.  And even though this is no longer a new sound, it is still downright frightening.
B00004TLMC|2.0|I've been a great admirer of the work of Stanley Kubrick ever since &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot; blew my mind as a child. And I awaited &quot;Eyes Wide Shut&quot; with great anticipation. But I'm sad to say that when I emerged from the theater, I was, for the first time in my life, left disappointed by Kubrick.<br />&quot;Eyes Wide Shut&quot; follows the disturbing, sexually-charged trek of a young married doctor (Tom Cruise) who is facing a crisis in his relationship with his wife (Nicole Kidman). His wanderings take him, among other scenarios, to a creepy orgy at the opulent meeting place of a secret society.<br />I expected to see an intelligent, erotic masterpiece; instead, I found the film to have a depressingly exploitative, sleazy feel. The much hyped orgy scenes are utterly lifeless, and even laughable. The normally charismatic Cruise barely registers as the wandering physician. Actually, the only moment of fun in the movie comes with Alan Cumming's delightful cameo as a giddy desk attendant.<br />I left this film wondering: Was Kubrick deliberately making a parody of a pretentious, would-be erotic &quot;art&quot; film? Or was his original vision butchered in the editing room? As the final film of a visionary genius, &quot;Eyes Wide Shut&quot; deserves to be seen and evaluated. But as a piece of cinematic art, I found it profoundly unsatisfying.
B00004YW6I|5.0|The most overlooked album of 2000, &quot;Stories From The City, Stories From The Sea&quot; tops my list of great albums from that year. Unfortunately, it didn't even appear on most critics Top 10 lists. But that oversight shouldn't keep you from experiencing the beauty and power of this album.<br />I originaly came to be aware of this album when I discovered the lead singer of Radiohead made an appearance. Even though I am a die-hard Radiohead fan, I believe this album is better than Kid A. In fact, the duet with Thom York isn't even the best song on the CD.<br />I've recommended it to all of my friends, many of whom are not fans of PJ Harvey. Every one of them has thanked me for the suggestion.
6303022901|4.0|&quot;The Joy Luck Club,&quot; directed by Wayne Wang, is an impressive multi-generational saga that spans two continents and several decades. The film looks at the lives of four Asian-American families. In particular, the film focuses on four mother-daughter pairs. This group of eight women is tied together by the friendship of the mothers, each of whom emigrated from China to the United States. The screenplay is based on the novel by Amy Tan.<br />The film deals with many issues: death, loss, racism, communication (or the failure thereof), male/female dynamics, and economic independence. The film also addresses such mythic concepts as the United States as a &quot;melting pot,&quot; or as a land of opportunity.<br />The film is not without its flaws. At times, it seems like a whittled-down miniseries; it's as if the screenwriters and director are simply trying to stuff too much material into a limited amount of film. And the endless parade of abusive, selfish male characters gets a little tiresome; I believe that some will view this as a &quot;male-bashing&quot; film. At times, the story seems a bit too soap opera-ish.<br />But the film's strengths, in my opinion, outweigh its weaknesses. Wang gets many good performances from the very large cast. The production values are superb; the film has the look and feel of a true epic. The complex storytelling technique (multiple flashbacks, including flashback-within-flashback) is pretty well handled by the filmmakers. And Rachel Portman's musical score effectively complements the film as a whole. Overall, I feel enriched by having experienced &quot;The Joy Luck Club.&quot;
B00005AXEL|5.0|This CD is a must buy of anyone who has ever loved the voice of Stevie Nicks... My favorite track is Everyday... That low voice of hers is just magnificent!  Every song on this CD is incredible!  She has out-done herself this time!
B00003CXQY|5.0|Based upon the glowing reviews I read at Amazon, I purchased this DVD sight unseen. After viewing this movie several times with my 3-year old daughter (she calls this, the &quot;Llama&quot; movie), my family loves this movie. Another Disney classic! It just puzzles me why Disney never really supported this movie. By all means, go out and buy the &quot;Ultimate Groove&quot; DVD.

0671042858|5.0|There are a great number of ways people read. Some love short anthology books, other are more keen to go through novels and eat them whole. Still some readers are more of on a genre basis, reading just horror, romance or what have you.<br />I love reading. Perhaps one of the great past times that I never tire of is just sitting down and going for a really good read. To move from places you can only imagine and try to be in. To actually live in the setting the author draws on with his words. When it comes to reading I would go forth by reading a novel or two after each other and them taking a break by reading some short story anthology. Kind of a way top draw a breather.<br />My last Stephen King book was Bag of Bones and that story grabbed by the neck and kept me completely enthralled by every aspect of it. The whole thing. I stood and wondered how a man like King could actually scribe such a masterpiece. He was more cast as a stereotypical horror writer, but what Bag of Bones had was something that not authors can emulate or draw from. That work was so much different from all his previous work that a person could have been fooled that the author was not really King himself. That book was big and long and after reading it, I thought that I needed time off from big novels and, though he's my fave author, from King himself.<br />Through it all, I was thinking, ok, Stephen, you did it once, but can you really do it again?? It was only after more than a year from my last King book that I finally knew the answer.<br />The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon is a short book by all standards. A fast reader could gulp it up in one setting and an average one could go with it for around a week. The book follows the same trend as Bag of Bones, with King relying more on his literary prowess more than his ability to scare powers. But does that mean, he doesn't have that in him. Oh no no! He just has it more in check and it's really in it. The whole idea of a girl being lost in the woods for God knows how long alone, and the reader experiencing what she has to go through is a feat all by itself. The notion of having a nine year old, alone, scared s just too incredulous to really fathom. Only King could have tackled such a thing and he does it superlatively. King's descriptive abilities are so strong that you will feel that you're with Trisha, wherever she goes, feeling whatever she does and seeing what she is seeing. Her dreams become reality and even her delirious hallucinations make the fear crawl inside you.<br />This book is a winner. I won't go into what I think King was going for in the story, but I guarantee that you will be touched by it. By the determination of that plucky 9 year old girl who looks older than her age.or God knows how long alone, and the reader experiencing what she has to go through is a feat all by itself.

B000002KJQ|2.0|I read reviews regarding what a horrible job of remixing was done to this album. I should have heeded them. They were right on target - buy the vinyl - skip the CD. I think that this album was one of ZZ's best ever. The songs are unparelled on any of their other albums. What was done to this album during the remix should have been a crime. It's tinny, hollow and void of any bass. The vocals are unbalanced and completely change the original tone of the album. I grew up cranking this album during hot summer nights and partying to this with the intensity it offered. What a criminal thing to do to ruin a classic like this through the disgraceful mixing job done to this album. Somebody find the guy that did this and deport him to the ends of the earth - never let the slug touch a remixing machine again. Disgraceful.
0790731509|5.0|After an entire lifetime of never having seen Cool Hand Luke (and always assuming that it was a Western, strictly on the basis of the title), I finally saw it yesterday. I won't bother saying much about the film because so many other reviewers have said it all already, other than that I loved it and it instantly became one of my favorite films. But I do want to say that The Shawshank Redemption, one of my all time favorite movies, has gone down a notch or two in my book after having seen this. Am I wrong to assume that the \\"inspiration\\" is a little, shall we say, blatant? To a lesser degree, the same applies to One Flew Over The Cukoo's Nest. I never really saw much of a connection between those two movies, but today I would bet my last dollar that they were both unabashedly patterned after Cool Hand Luke... all they did was change a few variables. Still great films, but as with Xerox facsimilies, the original is superior to the copies.
0345349571|5.0|Who is Enguerrand de Coucy and why should we care?<br />Coucy was a French noble whose life and position intertwined neatly with many of the momentous events that defined the 14th Century.  He appears, Zelig-like, at the head of armies, at the elbow of both the Kings of France and England and in the great councils of state that determined the actions of a nascent French nation.<br />His story is remarkable and remarkably well documented.  His life and actions serve as the central thread that ties the events surrounding the Hundred Year's War between England and France together in this marvelous book.<br />Tuchman displays this late Middle Age period in all of its nasty burtality.  The Great Plague hit in several waves, reducing Europe's population by between one half and one third.  A century of warfare left roving bands of knights and armed men loose in the countryside to pillage and destroy between summons to fight for king and country.  The common man and woman, evolving from a status of near slavery to severe oppression, owed service to their lord and taxes to almost everyone.<br />Tuchman brilliantly weaves the above facts of life with the politics and struggles between rival nobles, kingdoms and a corrupt church.  This book is very well written, as I had always heard Tuchman's works to be.  She possesses the rare ability to write solid history -- this book is fact filled, and thoroughly documented -- in the manner of a great storyteller.  Her characters and events, leavened by Tuchman's wry observations and logical conclusioins, are marvelously developed.<br />So much happened in this time period that it does bear scrutiny.  Chivalry, the code of the Knight that was suppossed to benefit people in exchange for a life free from common worries, had denegrated into a corrupt facade that shielded ruthless brigands from law and sanction.  The great Church, long the common denominator among disparate peoples became first hopelessly corrupt then divided for decades by rival popes more interested in Europe's balance of power among earthly kingdoms than in promoting the Kingdom to whom they suppossedly gave vasselage.  Great landed nobility struggled with each other and began a transformation from nearly autonomous players in an ever changing system of alliances across nationalities to becomming the building blocks of the infant state.  Policy and war rose and fell on the ability, whim and maturity of changing kings.<br />Although our own recently passed Twentieth Century could witness evil and bloodletting on a more sustained and organized basis than any that preceeded it -- hence the title &quot;Through a Distant Mirror,&quot; Tuchman's work also illustrates how far society has come in those parts of the world where it is civil and grounded in natural rights.  Thus, Tuchman's book shows both the constant danger through time of man's darker side as well as the progress earned by those who have managed to diffuse power and ground everyday people with a voice in their affairs and rights that can not be abrogated.<br />This is a marvelous work from every facet.  I am now ordering other Tuchman books to see how she handles man's affairs in centuries distant from that enjoyed by Enguerrand de Coucy.rival popes more interested in Europe's balance of power among earthly kingdoms than in promoting the Kingdom to whom they suppossedly gave vasselage.

B0000025JT|4.0|I love the intensity and strength in Barbra's voice, and the melodic way that Barry Gibb arranges music.  This is a beautiful combination, and this combination produced this wonderful set of music.<br />A little R&amp;B/Soul enhanced Barbra's voice, and proved that she could sing anything, and make it sound like it's her own style.  She has a wonderful singing style, just as Barry has a wonderful gift for producind and arranging music- he always has.<br />If you like good music, you'll like this one.
B00004VW35|4.0|Neil Young is probably the most eclectic performer in rock.  The trio of albums he released between 1982-1985 are the best example of his wandering muse.  Trans is a futuristic, electronic album, Everybody's Rocking is an homage to 50's rock sounds and this album, Old Ways is a countrified album in the tradition of Harvest.  The album contains some great tracks awash in the steel guitar sounds that mesh so well with Mr. Young's voice.  Old Ways has some great stuff including &quot;Are There Any More Cowboys?&quot;, &quot;Misfits&quot;, &quot;California Sunset&quot; and the superb &quot;Bound For Glory&quot;.  Old Ways is like an old pair of jeans, comfortable.

If your a fan of rap-rock, this should definitly be in your collection.

B00004T9UF|3.0|it is clear that eminem is one fo the best lyricists of his time on this album but if you listen to them there isn't a hell of a lot of meaning to his songs.  some songs are very good like stan, kim, criminal, who knew, and remember me.  but many others just dont have anything to them.  i still listen to them for the same reason i listen to someone like nelly.  they sound good and are alrgiht for listenin when driving around or whatever.  but if you want somethin to actually listen to deeply this isnt it.   the slim shady lp was one of the better cd's i have heard in a long time but he dropped off with this album.  eminem needs to get back to his underground style more and back to when he had somethin to say.  his next album is supposed to be more story tellin and hopefully better.  thats it i'm out.
0486278077|4.0|Dorian Gray was definately an excellent book, although the wording was somewhat outdated.  It is an excellent piece of work, but I just had one question about it.  Do you really think it was all Dorian's fault that everything happened?  I believe Dorian's horrid fate would never have existed if Lord Henry had not been introduced to him.  Lord Henry put outrageous ideas into an innocent litte head, and should be noticed as the fault of all of Gray's actions.  It just killed me that no one realized what was really happening!  But besides that question of fault, it was a grade A book, that I would read again, but not without a dictionary by my side.  I recommend it to anyone who likes intelectual reading, and who is willing to sit through outdated talk.  Just go for it, it's worth your time, and better yet... it's a short novel!
B000054OXU|3.0|After going back to his country roots on Old Ways, Neil Young takes a modern approach on Landing On Water.  Instead going futuristic as he did on Trans, Landing On Water was very much in the present at the time of its release in 1986.  The album has a heavy synthesizer base and a very commercial and polished sound thanks to studio wiz, Danny Kortchmar.  There are some standout songs like &quot;Weight Of The World&quot;, &quot;Pressure&quot;, &quot;Hard Luck Stories&quot; and the fabulous &quot;Hippie Dream&quot;.  Landing On Water isn't a great album, but merely good.
B000003TAW|5.0|Read a music magazine, and you'll often come across a review of a new band that will compare their sound to Weezer.  Usually the band doesn't sound like Weezer, but somehow the reviewer isn't totally wrong.  Weezer gets credit for anything sounding remotely &quot;geek rock&quot; or &quot;retro pop&quot; or &quot;grunge pop&quot; or &quot;alternative punk&quot; because Weezer produced the most listenable and melodic synthesis of all these elements. The blue disc is the original!   It spawns so many comparisons because this one disc captures a truly unique sound that everyone has a natural affinity for.  Cuomo's lyrics articulate the ideals of teenage want and longing, and his voice is clear and genuine (his is my personal favorite voice in musicdom, actually). The blue disc's 10 songs (perhaps the perfect symmetrical number of tracks) are pop masterpieces, and its one of the handful of albums I own that I can listen to straight through without skipping tracks.  But most of all (and you will know this if you've been to a Weezer show), it's perfectly sing-a-along-able.  Only in Dreams ranks as one of the most utterly rocking and beautiful songs I have ever heard.
0385486804|3.0|The first half of the book is good, a real page turner. The author, Krakauer, tells the intriguing story of Chris McCandless, an intelligent, passionate, personable 24 year old who died on an ill-prepared trip to Alaska. He also tells what is known about McCandless's other adventures, which he'd been having since high school. <br />One thing I object to in the entire book is that the story is not told in sequence. The author bounces around a lot. To read the story in sequence, read the chapters in this order: 11 (family history, childhood); 12 (high school and college adventures); first part of 4; 3; rest of 4; 5; 6; 7; first part of 16 (arrives in Alaska); 1; rest of 16; 18 (final adventure starts); 2 (dead body found); 10 (finding parents); 13 (family reacts); 17 (author visits site); epilogue (parents visit site with author).<br />The author also veers off twice in the middle of the book into the stories of other ill-prepared extreme adventurers (chapters 8 and 9), including his own story (chapters 14 and 15).<br />Krakauer made some common mistakes: not offering balance (merely offering a new extreme to counter an extremist); not offering a real avenue out for adventuresome readers (not offering understanding); and not explaining crucial things he claims to understand (this makes him indistinguishable from a madman to people who do not understand). The remainder of my comments flesh out these points.<br />In the second half of the book it becomes palpable that the author fears that youths with a lot of energy, ideals, and passion may well read about McCandless and go off on an extreme and ill-prepared adventures. It's also clear that Krakauer wants to address this problem.  He fails miserably in this.<br />I'm not a psych professional, but I think Krakauer makes some intelligent observations about adventurers such as McCandless. That they often have issues from childhood, largely corked conflicts with their fathers that erupt into short sighted missions of independence. He notes that an all-knowing paternalistic directing will fire anger in the children sooner or later. <br />But the author does not seem to understand why that might be so, except as a concept of it being something silly boys do. But I can certainly understand. I find that the world of people seeks balance: if you are one extreme, at least one other person around will seek the opposite extreme. (That isn't to say that people aren't responsible for their own behavior, no just short of that. Sane people always have some control.) The &quot;boy&quot; goes on a dangerous, wild, independent and ill-prepared quest. Well, surprise, surprise.<br />Krakauer, instead, follows the common route of blaming the &quot;boy&quot; for his death. Krakauer indulgently pities both parents in their distress. Repeatedly in the final quarter of the book, Krakauer takes to referring to the 24 year old, very independent man as &quot;the boy.&quot; &quot;The boy,&quot; though not expected to know about all of the tricks and tips of living rough in the Alaskan bush, incongruently is expected to, by age 24, (1) wrest himself from the decades-built monument of superiority of parenthood, (2) figure things out enough for himself to be at peace with his place in the world, and (3) to come to peace with his rigid father.<br />Much much worse, Krakauer doesn't seem to be aware that there are parents who molest their children, who keep them way outside their optimum stimulation range, or who lie to them constantly for no defensible reason. He never questions that McCandless was simply a remarkable yet silly boy of imperfect but decent parents. Krakauer relates his own story of a rigid father and his pitiable end. He apparently extrapolates that everyone should see their parents through indulgently pitying eyes, post haste -- in fact years and years sooner than he himself did. <br />Everyone should? Even the abused kids grown up? No, that is bad journalism. It is painful for victims to see theunfairness of this blindness to their situation. It is wrong to fail to point out the existence of such a possibility of child abuse to the rest of the readers. It is wrong to brush the reality of child abuse under the carpet as not even a possibility. Furthermore, even if McCandless was indeed simply an impulsive energetic youth with a fine childhood behind him, Krakauer is unfair for sneering at his not getting all of that maturity listed above by the age of 24. Irresponsible journalism, I say.<br />Another mistake Krakauer made is also a mistake that even the well known psychologist, Abraham Maslow made. Maslow's hierarchy goes from survival to security to love/belonging, and then beyond.  However, studies of people in crisis have revealed another step between security and love/belonging: Cognitive Functioning.  Krakauer stumbles around this key step of understanding, pointing out several knowledges that could have physically saved McCandless. <br />But he fails to explain the parents he feels he understands, he fails to explain the family conflict, he fails to explain his own understanding of his own rigid father. For that matter, he fails to explain his own ill-advised trip. Instead, he attempts to jump to the love/belonging step. The point of telling his own story in the midst of McCandless's seems to be: people who make ill-advised trips sure look silly and tragic. There is little understanding here, and only a cold suggestion that these boys don't belong and it's those who stayed at home who look good and who the author ultimately sides with. (Now don't you feel cold and left out, you young adventuresome readers?)<br />And we're back to the first mistake Krakauer makes: the lack of balance. By presenting only a choice between pitied, almost sneered-at, rejection and homey, obedient, predictable belonging, the author becomes another absolutist minded figure to rebel against.<br />When building understanding, love/belonging is beside the point. What would bea clear statement against taking such a premature step to love/belonging? Going back to survival!
006016848X|1.0|This is a book that heavily emphasizes the traditional male and female roles in romantic relationships.  Gray's writing is easy to read.  He uses many good metaphors to describe the romantic relationship, such as men are like rubber bands and women are like waves.  John Gray thinks that men and women are inherently different in every aspect: men like to fix problems and women like to change men; men need to be alone sometimes and women love to talk about their problems; men need to get away from the romantic relationships before they can get close; women's moods naturally change up and down quickly.  The author takes the stand of an expert and tells the readers to do what he believes an ideal romantic relationship should be like.  It seems to me that John Gray is telling people that they should never try to challenge the traditional male and female roles.  In fact, he thinks that problems in relationships occur because men and women don't understand the opposite sex's traditional gender roles enough.  His way of curing relationship problems is to encourage the couple to nurture and fortify the partners' traditional gender roles.   I have a problem with his overgeneralization about men and women's gender roles.  Not all women and men behave and think the way he described.  Gray pathologizes those people who don't fit into his ideal gender roles,  &quot;Sometimes in my seminar couples and individuals will share that they relate to the examples of men and women but in an opposite way.  The man relates to my descriptions of women and the woman relates to my descriptions of men.  I call this role reversal.... Many men have denied some of their masculine attributes in order to become more loving and nurturing.  Likewise many women have denied some of their feminine attributes in order to earn a living in a work force that rewards masculine attributes.  If this is the case, then by applying the suggestions, strategies, and techniques in his book you not only will create more passion in your relationships but also will increasingly balance your masculine and feminine characteristics&quot; (p. 6).  If a man is loving and nurturing and a woman is tough, Gray would say that they are not in their correct gender roles.  Why does Gray get to define what are the correct gender roles?  I think a better way to present his ideas is to list his own biases, state the limitations of his theory, and avoid supporting stereotypes.  This book is all about what Gray's ideal romantic relationship is like. It doesn't give the couple the space to define what their ideal romantic relationship should be like.  I personally think Gray does a good job helping couples to understand the opposite sex's traditional gender roles, however, this book also supports sexism.   In addition, if men and women are inherently different, how could the author explain romantic relationships between homosexuals or bisexuals?   Because Gray (1) overlooks the reader's own strengths and competencies, (2)  supports sexism, (3) focus on deficits (emphasizes finding out what is not working instead of what is working), (4) does not acknowledge his own biases and/or the limitations of his theory, I wouldn't recommend people to read it.  However, there is one exception.  If both of the partners think that the traditional gender roles work well in their relationship, I might suggest they read this book.

B000002LMK|5.0|After closing out the 80's with the brilliant Freedom, Neil Young opened up the 90's with another brilliant work.  Grunge was the sound of the moment at the time of Ragged Glory's release. The album shows why Neil Young and Crazy Horse are the godfathers of grunge as it is full of the chunky guitars and feedback that is the group's trademark.  &quot;F*!#in' Up&quot; is full of droning guitars and lyrics that question his decision making process.  &quot;Love To Burn&quot; is an explosive number with searing guitars, &quot;Over &amp; Over&quot; is in the same vein.  &quot;Farmer John&quot; is turned from a frat rock classic into a power surge.  Not everything is awash in heavy guitars.  Songs like &quot;Mansion On The Hill&quot;, &quot;Country Home&quot; &amp; &quot;Mother Earth (Natural Anthem)&quot; has a subtle and earthy tone that provide a calm in the storm.  Ragged Glory confirmed that Neil Young was truly all the way back on the top of his game.
B000002UB6|5.0|I know all the technical arguments against this album, but for me, they only make the album more profound.  I find this one of The Beatles most truly spiritual endeavors, and, ironically, the older I become, the more meaningful the album becomes.  From the first cut &quot;You &amp; I have memories, longer than the road that's leading us out of here,&quot; thru LET IT BE to THE LONG &amp; WINDING ROAD, the whole ablum reaches for &quot;the higher power.&quot;  Life is NOT perfect.  The album is NOT perfect.  The moral: All we can do is love the people who matter to us.  Paul says now that John comes to him in his dreams.  I'm sure it's true.
0380788624|5.0|I'm not a hard-core coding nerd, but I'm starting to learn and I do work for a software company, so I'm not totally lost in techno-speak.  And I LOVED this book!  Great story...and it made me think too!  I imagine this book works better and better the more of a geek you are, but I would even encourage someone just getting into computers to read it.  As I said, it is a great story and even if you can't read the PERL script in one part of the book (which I couldn't) you'll still love the book!
B00004U8H4|5.0|I read the book first and then saw the movie.<br />The book... a complete waste of time.  A great concept with no follow through.<br />The movie on the other hand is what the book wishes it were.  Witty, scary, thought provoking, entertaining, ... good.<br />This movie certainly didn't get the attention it should have.  I imagine it's because of the graphic sex and violence, which there is a fair amount of.<br />It's almost like the dark side of &quot;The Secret to My Success&quot;<br />I'm not sure how much better the Unrated Version is than the American Theater release (R rated).  There's more sex and violence but the movie remains little changed.<br />All in all, a must see for fans of the eighties, horror, and dark comedies.
B000056K04|1.0|I became an instant DMB fan when I first heard ''Ants Marching'' back in 1996.  I was totally hooked from that moment on.  I bought ''Under the Table and Dreaming'' and wore the CD out and had to buy another.<br />From that point on my collection of DMB CD's grew and so did my love for this band and their music.<br />I especially love(d) the jazz undertones in many of their songs. <br />I eagerly awaited the release of their new CD and was disappointed when it didn't come out last Novemeber as originally promised.<br />  Then I heard talk of all new songs; total remake; new producer etc.  Finally the CD came out and I was there to buy it when it hit the shelves.  Popped it in the car CD player and cranked up the volume.  Listened a few minutes, turned the volume down and then did something I have NEVER done with a DMB CD - I started FF to the next cut, then the next, until I got to track 9 where things finally started to sound like DMB and not some head banging, electric rock &amp; roll, hear it all the time on FM radio, junk.<br />I have my tickets in hand to see DMB this summer.  Trust me, I will respond loudly when I hear the good DMB and I will sit silently when they play cuts from this CD.<br />Dave, please don't do this again!
0553212621|5.0|I'll be the first to admit it.  I read this book because as a young kid, it was on the list of banned books.  My curiosity had been sparked.  Now, some 10, 15 years later, I have finally unlocked the mystery of this wonderful book.  It is a pity to be put off by the controversy.  This book is NOT just 'controversy for contraversy's sake', and it is an injustice to label it such. <br />How someone in the 1920's could write statements and observations about the human condition that would last beyond the end of the millenium is truly fascinating.  In this book, you will find the scenes that once ignited controversy, and continue to.  At the same time, however, Lawrence is using them to create an in-depth character study of what we have allowed sex to become in our society, blatantly contrasted with all the things it has the potential to be.  Enjoy.
B00003CXSP|3.0|Well, all i can say (even though I'm about to say more) is that you must read the book first to get a full idea of how much the movie sucks, at least compared to the book. Above-average movie, but if it paid more attention to the book it would have been award-winning. For time saving, I assume, more than half the characters were cut, including Mason's bodybuilding sister, which would have been neat. If all the books 'scenes' were included, the movie would probably be over four hours long, but good hours, at least. And the exclusion of Dr. Lecter's Memory Palace was an incredibly stupid idea. And, of course, the ending in the book was much better. Just because some whinning feminists didn't like what happened to Clarice's character doesn't mean it should be ruined for the rest of us! READ THE BOOK
6303921248|5.0|I'm not very easily  satisfied by book-to-movie adaptions, especially when your dealing with classics like Austen, or Shakespeare. But having said that, this was a production which left me wishing it was longer (than 6hrs!)<br />This is about as true to the book as youll ever see, it manages to be dramatic and yet retain the wonderful comedic sections, such as Mr Bennets dry wit. Some of the wonderful banter between Darcy and Elizabeth was omitted but not enough to make a huge difference.<br />The Characters in this are perfectly cast, from the greasy, perpetually sweaty Mr Collins, to the overbearing Lady Catherine de Bourgh. You could not have pictured a more  engaging, enchanting Elizabeth. As in the book; she is not the most beautiful woman in the world yet there is truly something amazing about her, she mesmerises you completely, theres no escaping. Darcy is wonderful, if you hear or read Colin Firth talking about  Darcy, you see his portrayal in a new light, and from his first scene you understand him perfectly and almost sympathise with him, when you know he is saying some truly awful things. <br />My real grade for this pic would have been 4.5, only losing the 1/2 because of the way everything finishes so abruptly. Almost 6 hours are spent going through chapter by chapter, word for word(almost), and then suddenly *bang*, its finished. Some of the best scenes between Darcy and Lizzy come at the end, when he accounts for having fallen in love with her. I know thats probably nitpicking but just the same...<br />In conclusion, this film does what so many other films never think of, instead of adding pointless and superfluous dialugue to express feelings you read about in the book, they manage to do it with looks, meaningful glances, brilliant background music; and if what they say is true-a picture tells a thousand words, then each glance between Firth(darcy) and Ehle(Elizabeth) is worth a full length novel of its own.
B000000W6F|4.0|are you curious about the pumpkins or just collecting albums by a great band??  either way this is a fine edition to anyone's  collection.  there is a touch of rock, a good coating of psychadelic, some alternativeness and a dash of musicianship all blended together.  billy corgan is a great guitar player.  he really knows how to get some great sounds from a guitar.  he had a great partner in james iha, silent but beautiful &amp; jimmy chamberlain is a great jazz style drummer(although his jazz style is not too prevalent here) in a great rock band.  from the dynamic WINDOWPAINE with its feedback moment that i adore to the darcy sung DAYDREAM (good voice and not a bad bassist either, a little average but still ok for what this band is about) this is a ride for the heart and soul.  the music, i felt, was always stronger than the lyrics but even still form the opener I AM ONE to SIVA(a favorite of the band to play live) this is an album that is the begginning of a great band, an impressive debut, and a good mix of production and playing.  emotional, honest and a gem!!! for those who may ask why it did not rate 5 starts in my book, well i am not into the psychadelic style  one hundred percent and that is my grudge against it but that is my taste.  yours may differ.  i enjoyed SIAMESE DREAM b/c it rocks alot more than this but again, that is my taste.
B00005AXEL|5.0|When I watch college &amp; pro games on TV, I press the TV &quot;MUTE&quot; button so that I don't have to listen to the dumb sports announcers.  Instead of talking about the two teams &amp; plays in the game at hand, like they are supposed to, they are usually talking about other college &amp; pro teams!!!  Many of my friends agree with me:  Put the TV on Mute &amp; play Stevie Nicks.<br />    So, here comes Stevie Nicks to the rescue again...  <br />    Instead of listening to those sports announcers, I play Stevie Nicks' &quot;Trouble In Shangri-La&quot; CD Album along with Stevie's &quot;Enchanted&quot; CD Album while watching the game - and, it works just fine.  We enjoy it. <br />     Trouble In Shangri-La is the kind of album I can enjoy listening to over and over again and again and never tire of it - just like Stevie's &quot;Enchanted&quot; CD Album or &quot;Pictures At An Exhibition.&quot;<br />     You might like to buy 3 Trouble In Shangri-La CDs: one for a friend of yours, one for your car &amp; one for your home!!!
B000000WHC|5.0|A virtuoso performance. There are few pop genres that Gary Moore hasn't tried but he's at his best when it comes to the blues. Full of energy, intensity ... and pace! He augments the tradition (no frantic white-guy-on-speed here.). He pays due respect to the &quot;King of the Blues&quot; (I won't spoil it for you; from cut #7 and the liner notes, you'll know who it is),  comfortably plays Santana-inspired riffs and he 'out-Stevie Ray's' Steve Ray. For any blues aficionado, this CD testifies that the Blues, indeed, lives on.
0446677450|5.0|This is an extremely valuable book.  Kiyosaki's ways of thinking will change your outlook on life.  He explains why people are poor, and why they stay poor, and what differentiates the rich from the poor and middle class.  Using his life experiences of his &quot;rich dad's&quot; thinking, and his &quot;poor dad's&quot; thinking as the basis for his book, he does a great job of leading you on the right path in becoming rich.  He explains that the poor/middle class are the employees, and self-employeed in life, while the rich are involved in investing and owning businesses.  The whole plan behind this book is to get you out of the &quot;rat race&quot; way of thinking, and by doing this a person will become truly successful.  The only thing that Kiyosaki's book leaves me desiring is some examples, of what exactly has to be done, and how to do it vs. his motivational and general knowledge, yet this is understandable because a master can only lead a person so far, then the rest is up to you.  This is a great book, and should be a part of everyone's collection.
B000002UAR|4.0|The Beatles continue on their voyage of musical self-discovery which they began in earnest with their release of \\"Rubber Soul\\", which I consider to be a better collection than this one. Eleven of the fourteen tracks on \\"Revolver\\" were written by the prolific Lennon/McCartney duo, while George Harrison penned the remaining three.<br /><br />The CD begins with a rousing bit of wit penned by Harrison, \\"The Tax Man\\", which I consider to be one of Harrison's best efforts. This is followed the mysterious and melodic \\"Eleanor Rigby\\" which is a terrific song, moody and provocative. The beautifully harmonized love song, \\"Here, There, and Everywhere', is followed by the strange, though imaginative, \\"Yellow Submarine\\". They also introduce a number redolent of a British music hall, \\"Good Day Sunshine\\". The track on this CD probably most reminiscent of their earlier efforts is \\"Got To Get You Into My Life\\".<br /><br />This eclectic collection of songs shows that The Beatles were on mission to extend their range, a road that they were able to travel because of their versatility. While this is a very good album, I differ with most other reviewers in that I do not think it is their best. It is still too self-conscious and disjointed an effort. The best of The Beatles is yet to come.
0684865130|5.0|Throughout Catch - 22, Joseph Heller utilizes diction and irony to satirize the inner workings of the Armed Forces.  By exercising his command of the English language, Heller comically portrays the Army in a way that makes the reader just have to laugh.  The easiest examples of this comedy are some of the names the characters in the novel receive.  The character Major ------- de Coverley is a symbol for the lengths the military will go to simply keep a secret, no matter how unimportant it may be.  Throughout the entire novel Heller never once tells the reader de Coverley's first name.  Another character that further illuminates the problems that plague the Army is Major Major Major.  When this character enrolls in the Armed Forces, he serves as a symbol of how the military promotes it's soldiers, not by merit, but simply because the &quot;bigwigs&quot; feel like promoting someone.  By promoting Major Major Major to a Major from a Private simply because some General thinks that it sounds good, creates a ridiculous situation that enables the reader to laugh at the Army that created it.    Aside from his excellent word choice, Heller fills Catch - 22 with massive amounts of irony to instill in the reader a sense of hilarity toward the Armed Forces.  When Yossarian is attending a question and answer session he and some other pilots as questions that have no answers such as &quot;Why is Hitler?&quot; This leads Colonel Korn to ironically proclaim that the only people who can ask questions are the people who never ask questions.  Soon after, because no one was asking questions, the classes where considered worthless because Colonel Korn did not consider it necessary to try and educate people who never questioned anything.  This shows how the Army will do something so stupid as give Colonel Korn orders, which achieve nothing, and call this a success.  Also when Yossarian is sick in the hospital, the army makes him switch beds because the family of a man who just died has arrived and want to see him.  Now, instead of telling the family that their son is dead already, they tell Yossarian to play along.  But when the family comes to talk to him, Yossarian doesn't tell them that he's their son, he tells them that his name is Yossarian not Guiseppe.  Normally people would think that perhaps they have the wrong person, but they persevere and take it in stride that he claims his name is Yossarian.  The brother constantly reminds them that Yossarian is Yossarian but the parents don't listen because don't think that the army would lie to them, and yet in reality it did.  Another good example of irony is when Doc Daneeka dies.  On paper it shows that Daneeka was supposed to be in the plane that crashed, so Sergeant Knight assumes Daneeka is dead.  Yet, when the doctor protests to Knight that he's alive, Knight just ignores him because he knows Daneeka is dead regardless of what Daneeka himself says.  Here Heller is making fun of how the Army deals with people strictly on paper and not as the people who they really are.  Another example of this is when Yossarian sits in the hospital bed with the wrong nametag, because he wants to sit next to his friend Dunbar.  After extensive talks with a psychiatrist, Yossarian is ruled to be insane, and is to be sent home.  But because of the wrong nametag and the fact the Army deals with people on paper, the person who's name is on Yossarian's nametag is sent home while Yossarian, the one who actually is crazy, is made to stay and continue fighting.  To show the corruption of the Army, Heller uses situation irony when Milo Minderbinder bombs his own squadron for a profit.  Now instead of being punished like the reader would normally think he would be, Milo is congratulated on how much money he made because all the bigwigs get a portion of the profits that Milo makes.    By his word choice and hilarious irony, Heller creates a comedic atmosphere perfect for his satirical portrayal of the Army.
6305127638|4.0|Star Trek: First Contact is a first-rate movie.  The enterprise, ordered to stay out of the conflict with the borg violates orders and comes in at the last moment to save the day.  Picard takes command of the task force and destroys the borg ship.  But wait -- a small sphere broke away from the cube at the last moment.  The enterprise follows it back into time to undo the damage that the borg have done A.K.A. assimilating earth.  There the meet the witty Zephran Cochran and Riker &amp; Geordi partake in the first test of the warp engine while Picard tries to get the borg off of his ship.  While there is some humor, it is done much more tastefully than Generations (which at some points seemed more like bad stand-up than a star trek movie).  The DVD is somewhat lacking: it, of course, contains the movie -- which looks great -- but it lacks in extras such as cut scenes, behind the scenes shots, etc.  It could be a lot better as a DVD but the movie is the best Trek film to date!
B00004ZAV3|3.0|I'm of two minds about this CD. I really do like the Beatles but I am not entirely enamoured of listening to the Beatles when all that are presented are the most commercial songs i.e. &quot;the hits&quot;. And as hits, a few of these barely qualify. Paperback Writer? I heard that more in the 70s than I did when it was current. Admittedly, the Beatles were one of the first to break out of the straitjacket of strict commercialism and are to be hailed as pioneers in that regard. And without the economic clout they wielded on the strength of their very commercial and choreographed beginnings, such masterpieces as Sgt. Pepper and Abbey Road may never have been issued. Record companies would have laughed. That being said, &quot;1&quot; can be seen as a CD that is sure to be a favorite with those for whom the top 40 side of the Beatles is the most memorable. From that angle, there are a few glaring omissions; where's Michelle?, where's If I Fell?, where's I Am the Walrus?; and one can always argue about what should have been included/omitted. Though songs like Yesterday are enduring classics, my favorite Beatles songs are not here. I bought this to throw in the CD rotation anytime a guest who really isn't into serious music just wants to hear pure top 40. If that's what you are into, it will be hard to top The Beatles &quot;1&quot;.
B000002UAU|4.0|With this, their eighth release, The Beatles continue on their musical journey. A conceptually brilliant recording, as well as highly creative for its time, it is a much more musically cohesive work than its predecessor, &#34;Revolver&#34;. Yet, I believe &#34;Revolver&#34; had better songs, overall, even though it can't touch the production values inherent in this recording, nor the social impact that this recording had. Quite simply, it summed up an era.<br /><br />This recording was on the cutting edge for its time, and it was a very definite, new direction for the Fab Four, as they seemed to want to shed their original mop haired image with all due speed. It was a psychedelic precursor of the youth revolution that was to come. Flower power was just around the corner, as was the so called psychedelic drug craze.<br />Some of the songs on this recording heralded the new era. The whimsical &#34;Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds&#34; was the mantra for this movement, while the mournful refrains of &#34;She's Leaving Home&#34; illustrated the general disaffection of youth which was so prevalent at the time. &#34;A Little Help From My Friends&#34; was certainly the blueprint for getting along for many baby boomers during that era which this recording heralded.<br /><br />For many reasons, this remains one of the most important and seminal recordings ever made, and no music collection should be without it.
B000003489|3.0|Giant Steps strikes me as cold, distant, and soulless.  Every six months I break it out again and I always have the same reaction: it just doesn't grab my heart.  It is a very technically proficient record, but it's fire is not human, to me.  I know many people love it, but to me there is something essential lacking here.  I except Naima from this review.  That track alone deserves five stars, but the rest of the record is cold and metallic, to me.
0800132335|5.0|This is a great nail biting thriller that I recomend to anyone that is interested in WW2. What it does is give you in the face action that keeps your eyes glued to the screen. I couldnt beleive some of the things they go through. The ending cought me completely by suprise. You really need to see this. Beleive me it's worth it.
B000002P5R|5.0|...and here comes Dolly Dagger! These are just a few of those great songs that the god of guitar made... And I just came in from the storm, and freedom, thats what I want now... Really you have to believe me, this is one of the greatest CDs ever! If I had enough money I would buy it.
B00003CXPD|5.0|There is a rebellious side in all of us.  The side that dreams, that asks, &quot;What if I had ...,&quot; that wonders about alternative futures.<br />I've been following my dreams (at my work) for years.  It is a constant battle.  Billy Elliot helps to show us that there is sometimes an end to the rainbow.<br />The movie is quaint, touching, and extremely well written.  Julie Waters, who played the role of Billy's dance teacher, was exquisite, as was Gary Lewis, who played his father.  (Of course, Jamie Bell, as Billy, was wonderful too.)<br />The movie starts off slow but builds to a very emotionally moving climax, using a British miners strike in 1984 as the backdrop.  The dialog is sparse, but powerful nonetheless.  And for once, a film takes the time to adquately develop all of the major (and even a few minor) characters.<br />If you've ever longed to follow your dreams -- or wish you could have -- then you'll love Billy Elliot.
0441172717|4.0|First off, I have a slight phobia towards science fiction. I was left unimpressed by it when I was younger, too many corny aliens and spaceships. So that it is understood, I am not usually a big fan of Science Fiction genre. But, Dune is a fantastically written book. Frank Herbert certainly has a way of pulling the reader into the heart of the plot, which is most tense once it gets up to full speed. I felt as if I was a bystander watching everything that occurred and for me that style is fascinating. The first parts of the book are slow, not tedious, but it seemed to me as if I were moving at turtle speed-unusual since I normally read quickly. The read is only slow because Herbert is dishing out a lot of information that is quite helpful for understanding the rest of the novel. After I passed the thick reading, the whole book was very easy to speed through. I would have finished last week had it not been for the appendixes at the end of the book. I am even tempted to skip the last ten pages or so of appendix because it is starting to become the &quot;tedious&quot; that the beginning was not. This is why I decided not to give it five stars.   I would recommend Dune to everyone. There are some higher level thinking topics, but even if one prefers not to ponder too deeply Dune is exciting on a less intense level, too. Frank Herbert did a spectacular job on this book. Next week I am going to pick up the sequels at the library. I wonder if they can measure up to the high standard set by Dune.
6305307261|5.0|Nosferatu unfolds like a languorous, disturbing dream.  The images have an hallucinogenic, archetypal quality:  mummified human remains in an ancient tomb; the figure of a woman sitting on a beach studded with tombstones; a dead sea-captain lashed to the wheel of a deserted sailing ship.<br />Like Kubrick's The Shining, Nosferatu is less a standard genre film than a singular expression of a filmmaker's vision.  Writer-director Werner Herzog began with F.W. Murnau's expressionist classic, mixed in elements from Bram Stoker's novel Dracula, then set about creating a meditation on the vampire myth.  What would it really mean to live forever, and be compelled to feed on the blood of others?  What of the unspeakable boredom?  The longing for companionship?  For normalcy?  For death?  As played by Klaus Kinski, Herzog's Dracula has spent hundreds, if not thousands of years alone with these thoughts.  He is the ultimate poster boy for German angst.  If not for the skill of his performance and Herzog's direction, he might have lapsed into self-parody.<br />There are shots that all but reproduce moments from the silent classic - right down to the overwrought body language. But Herzog, Kinski, and the rest of the cast (including Bruno Ganz as Jonathon Harker and Isabelle Adjani as his wife Lucy) keep it in check and keep it beautifully stylized, so it all works.<br />Probably due to the involvement of American studio 20th-Century Fox, Nosferatu was shot in both English and German versions.  Both are on this double-sided DVD; comparing them is instructive, since there are non-trivial differences in the visual construction of both films.  Most critics agree (and I concur) that the German one is superior.<br />Finally, to get an idea of whether you will like this - or any - Werner Herzog film, take the Armageddon-Matrix test:  if you hated Armageddon because it was empty and overblown, but kind of liked The Matrix because of its ideas, then you may like Nosferatu.  If, on the other hand, you thought Armageddon rocked, but only kind of liked The Matrix because it was slow in places, then don't even think about it.on the other hand, you thought Armageddon rocked, but only kind of liked The Matrix because it was slow in places, then don't even think about it.

B0000508U6|5.0|This is a very interesting and addictive album. I bought it  less than 48 hrs ago, i've listened to all of it about 8 times already and i'm still hungry for more. Overall, there's something about this album which is very captivating. &quot;Don't Panic&quot; is great, addictive and different, &quot;Shiver&quot; is tremendous, as is &quot;Spies&quot;, Yellow, Trouble, High Speed, We Never Change and Everything's Not Lost, it is great from start to finish. Even though the songs themselves are very different in speed and feel, it has a sense of being one continuous masterpiece. A lot of it sounds like The Verve and Oasis, and a *bit* like Radiohead. A definite buy for all music lovers. A classic.
B000059Z8J|4.0|One of my all-time favorite films has finally been given the DVD treatment.  This long-awaited release was postponed several times (it was supposed to be released last year).   The good news is that the picture has never looked better (Remember watching a grainy out-of-focus Superman: The Movie on television for the last 20 years?).  There is also about 8 minutes of restored footage (mostly with Marlon Brando) which adds a little more to the emotional impact of the film (particularly the added scene with Jor-El in the Fortress of Solitude)<br />Now the bad news: There's a scene on Krypton when a Sentinel is sent to arrest Jor-El.  Now we see the Sentinel leaving for Jor-El's quarters in this restored scene, but what we don't see is the rest of this scene, which I felt should've also been restored.  The Sentinel is flying through Krypton's massive canyons only to be killed by a falling building in the Krypton-quake. Also, the sound effects (mostly in the first half-hour of the film) have not been \\"enhanced\\" as previously announced, but REPLACED with completely different sounds.  This is very distracting, since for the last 23 years you're used to hearing very different things going on in the film (especially in the Krypton scenes). Also the music queues seem to be a little out of sync with some of the movie's scenes.  I read an interview the other day with director Richard Donner, who supervised the restoration.  He claimed to be unaware that the sound effects of the original film were omitted and replaced.  He was told they were simply were being \\"enhanced\\". (Interesting). Although after stating that, I have to admit that I did like the new sounds in the opening credit sequence.  They add to the anticipation and are really a heart-stopper.<br />My personal opinion is that if you're restoring a classic film, or making a special edition, it's okay to add something (such as deleted scenes) or to enhance something. But you shouldn't REMOVE something altogether (rememberthe same thing was done by George Lucas in two of the Star Wars \\"Special Edition\\" films). This disc was also originally supposed to be a 2-disc set containing the original theatrical cut of the film, but I guess they changed their minds for some reason (?).  I guess the sound affects issue probably won't be too big a deal to most people, but for some movie buffs (including myself) it's a little annoying.  For the most part though the DVD is excellent, complete with 3 documentaries, screen tests, trailers and 2 additional deleted scenes (which also should've been restored).  <br />Let's hope for a Superman II Special Edition next!
B00003CXPD|5.0|I watched this movie in pure awe at my local movie theater. I went to the big, important one to see this movie, it had gotten a lot of hype. I was overcome with emotion, and compassion. Very rarely are movies done about a recent decade. For instance, movies from the 80's are usually about the 80's or the 60's and before...movies from the ninties are about the ninties, or the 70's...etc. This was from such a recent time, that I could honestly connect with it. <br />Jamie Bell, I must say, gave an absolutely stunning performance, which almost made me break down and cry. Julie Walter's was one of the best supporting actresses in a movie of last year, so much emotion was behind every word that she said, you knew you didn't want to mess with her. This story had a great moral, and it was deeply touching. <br />The reason for my title, is, that this movie has the most meaning to teenagers. It tells them that they can defy all stereotypes and do what they truly want to do, but, this movie was rated 'R'. The reason for this, was the language. But, I personally, couldn't understand a curse word that they said because of their thick, THICK brittish accents. I think that every teenager should see this movie, and every adult should as well. People of all ages can learn wonderful lessons from this movie.
B00000JCB2|5.0|I don't see what all the fuss is about, 99% of all  metal bands swear. Fred Durst is cool. Wes Borland is a great guitarist. Sam is a great bassist.  John otto is the world's best drummer. Lethal is great too. This album flat out rocks! To hell with the critics!
0393312836|5.0|The lyrical narrative in this book was what captivated me most, my brothers.  This includes the unrivalled originality in Burgess' nadsat language.  The story really captured the often destructive self-absorption and invulnerable feeling of youth -- the ability to act without fearing the consequences, and even when suffering the consequences, caring very little if at all about one's own part.<br />The introduction, in which Burgess harped on about the excluded 21st chapter of the American version prior to 1986 had me curious.  I think that the book without the final chapter, the way it was captured in the movie, is in fact better.  Burgess makes an important point about the final chapter, yet I found it didactic and perhaps with the least flow of any in the rest of the book.<br />Still, this is an excellent book, and well worth a read for anyone.
B00005AXEL|5.0|Whether this is your first Stevie Nicks album or the latest volume in your Stevie collection, Trouble in Shangri-La is a wonderful addition to anyone's music archives.  What is so striking about this album is that Stevie brings her rock and roll sensibility to these songs in a way that stands in sharp contrast to the brainless tunes so often played on today's radio.  Stevie also proves what an versatile musician she is through these songs by blending so well artistically with a wide variety of artists.  (let's face it...how many artists in today's music world could sing with Macy Gray and Natalie Maines on the same album, and accent the voices of both)  Trouble in Shangri-La is far from another &quot;comeback album&quot; designed to send a famous rock star's career into high gear for one song and then that person fades away like a comet.  This is a well-constructed, masterfully sung compilation by an artist of exceptional talent.  Be prepared to be swept off your feet!
1573921394|1.0|There are two ways a book like this should be judged, economically and stylistically.  Unfortunately on both counts, Lord Keynes falls flat on his face.<br />First, stylistically, this book is absolutely horrendous.  It is so horrendous that even those who consider themselves &quot;Keynesians&quot;(such as Paul Samuelson) will tell you how poorly written the book is.  It is illogically organized, and the prose is incredibly difficult to understand throughout most of the book.  Indeed, half the challenge of reading the book is simply determining exactly WHAT Keynes is saying!<br />But all that could be excused if, and only if, the book contained some valuable economic insights that would make it worthwhile reading.  Again, Keynes fails miserably on this count as well.  In fact, a great number of his theories are socialistic in nature(government spending itself out of a depression).  <br />The one great fault from which all of his ideas come from is his obsessive concentration on consumer spending and total ignorance of individual time preferences and how said time preferences determine the capital structure of the economy.  Because of this ignorance, he is completely blind to the fact that as a direct result of his policy prescriptions(government spending and monetary inflation) the actual misery those policies are supposed to relieve will either become exacerbated or, in the case of an economy that is NOT in depression, will create an inflationary boom which MUST result in a subsequent bust.<br />But picking apart all of the problems with his economic fallacies would take an entire book.  Luckily such a book exists, &quot;The Failure of the New Economics&quot; by Henry Hazlitt, which is a point by point refutation of Keynes &quot;General Theory&quot;.  I implore everyone who has read Keynes' book, or is thinking of reading Keynes' book, to pick up Hazlitt's book and read it thoroughly.  <br />As far as the popularity of the &quot;General Theory&quot; is concerned, that is due to Keynes belief that government action could regulate the economy and ensure prosperity.  It should come as no surprise that his policies were embraced by those in power the world over and implemented on a grand scale, thus resulting in the business cycle so familiar in the United States.<br />All in all, gibberish, and poorly written gibberish at that.
6305342776|2.0|I too bought the Black Hole thinking of my younger years, and watching this film now makes me laugh out loud, as well as see what it COULD have been.  Granted, the film has GREAT SFX... but GREAT SFX does not make a GREAT film.  And it pays MORE than homage to Star Wars. V.I.N.CENT is tin can shaped like R2 and as effeminite as C-3PO. For goodness sakes, the sentry robots have Darth Vader's FACE! A saving grace is the evil robot Maximillian. What a dark, ominous menace it was.  What kills this film when you get down to it is the writing. I have a whole list, but I'll focus on one point as an example....For the entire film, Dr. Reinhardt is a mad genius... but then for seemingly NO reason, towards the end, he tells Kate McCrae &quot;Save me from Maximillian.&quot; Where did that come from? It's like the story just made a sharp left into an oak tree. You can't start a new story thread at the end of a film. I didn't even mind the &quot;Fantasia&quot; ending, Dr. Reinhardt and Maximillian togther in a &quot;Dante-esque&quot; hell. But in the end, you are left with a story that had too many things going on at once, rather than it being one thing or another and a movie that isn't really sure of exactly what it wants to be.
B00002E233|5.0|How could people say this is a bad movie?  It is beyond me.  Jaws wannabe?  Yeah, right.  This is a different kind of scary than the 1975 predecessor.  Jaws scared practically everybody out of the water.  Deep Blue Sea won't do that.  But it sure is one hell of a ride.
0767827015|3.0|I have read some interesting reviews and I admit I enjoyed the movie.  Yet, I can't give it a good review.  One interview said to be African-American is a curse.  No.  To have a very narrow negative perspective on life is the curse.  It's self defeating and the worst aspect of this movie.  Some choice examples: <br />Tre's father explaining why there's a gun shop and liqueur store on every corner in black neighborhoods - 'they want us to kill ourselves.&quot;  Really, I never knew about this grand conspiracy.  I thought the shop owners might simply be entrepreneurs.  Instead, maybe the government owns the shops in this grand master plan to destroy blacks.  Perhaps the shop owners are Klansmen with a few extra bucks to spare.  Sound plausible?<br />In another scene Tre's father explains that the army is no place for a black man.  Yet, I knew plenty of ex-armed forces people who found good jobs at the company I worked.  Dr. Stanley in his book &quot;The Millionaire Mind&quot; claims that some of the very rich found their military training very useful in helping to build discipline and leadership.  Yet, the army is just a trap for black men.<br />A friend of mine once admonished me that I don't know what it's like to be black in this country.  Well, I don't know what it's like to be Vietnamese in the 1970s.  Yet many of the Vietnamese in my neighborhood are very successful.  I have little doubt if Vietnamese had been gang-bangers and drug dealers there would be no shortage of apologists saying how these disenfranchised people just can't help themselves.  And that is the general theme of this movie.  Yes, Tre makes it because of his father's strict discipline.  Other than this point the movie is negative.  And even on the score of parental responsibility the movie falls short.  Perhaps it isn't the grand white conspiracy, bully cops, or racism but illegitimacy - 70% among blacks up from 20% in 1964 - that is one of the causes of all the problems in the hood.
1558908358|5.0|This is my freshmn review so here goes. I have seen this masterwork many times over the years it contains so much for all of us it posseses a theme of leadership and how one person can triumph over evil. And the soundtrack by wendy carlos is one of the best i have ever heard. she should be ranked up there with  james horner. The best tune she wrote was the ending titles theme. Wendy is such a good writer she uses synthesizers to there fullest potential. I hope you found this helpful
6305903182|2.0|As I felt that &quot;Scream 2&quot; was a bit tired and devoid of the immense impact that &quot;Scream&quot; generated, this third installment is almost aneamic. It's a tired rehash of old plot elements and even the actors involved seem to notice that and only walk through their paces in semi-disinterested fashion. The &quot;telephone-voice&quot;-thing surely could have been replaced by something new. And to dig up that Maureen Prescott story almost makes the whole thing a cross between Agatha Christie and Psycho (echoes of &quot;mother&quot;), trying to put the audience at the edge of their seats with suspense but instead making a lost cause from the beginning loose steam altoghether. It is, however, competently put together and have some bright spots, mostly some funny dialogue between Cox and Posey (they both turn in quite amusing and alert performances) and odd scenes of power, like the attack on Campbell on the &quot;Stab 3&quot; set. Other scenes simply falls flat (the beginning simply fails to catch your interest) and it's obvious who the killer is since it's the only murder that takes place off-screen. But Wes Craven has managed to renew himself before and hopefully he will again!
0875428940|5.0|This deck is my long time favorite. I have always appreciated the contents of Rider-Waite cards, but the style of Pamela Coleman-Smith drawings was too old-fashioned for me and was a disturbing factor during readings. Robin Wood deck is what I was looking for: same ideas, but with modern rendition. I cannot say that I love every single card (I still haven't found my 'ideal' deck) but there are no cards in this deck my subconsciousness rejects. My first Robin Wood deck was in everyday use for the last couple of years (I own around 20 decks, but use only a couple of them) and finally it is so worn out that I will have to replace it with a new copy... Usual warning for the beginners: try to see the deck before you buy it, especially if you are going to work with it, not only add it to your collection. No matter how good reviews you have read - if you don't like it, if you don't 'feel the vibes' - DON'T BUY THE DECK, because it will do you more harm than good.
B000002H33|5.0|This is one of those albums that you simply cannot fault, how this album isn't one of the greatest sellers of all time I have no idea whatsoever.  That aside you have to understand that this is not an album for the faint hearted, here you will find loud guitars, dark lyrics, fast drums and beyond that sheer unadulterated noise.  Make sure you have your mind under control when you listen to this cd, anyway here is my song by song analysis :-<br />Track 1 : battery This is one of the best intro tracks I have ever heard.  While for the first minute or so it is slow string guitars it suddenly plugs in and the guitar assault begins!  The drums beat fast and the guitar belts out lots of noise.  This is one of those tracks that grabs you by the brain and simply refuses to let you out, a track that is absolutely first rate and without doubt the best of the lot as an intro track<br />Rating 9/10<br />Track 2: Master of puppets Things get serious here as the band go a bit political.  While the trademark guitars and drums are present you can't help but think the band are talking about how easy as a race humans are to control and the idea that there is always an authority higher than the other holds water in our bleek world.  As a guitar track I rate this as excellent, the pace varies well and blends with the lyrics superbly a fantastic track that keeps your interest high.<br />Rating 10/10<br />Track 3: the thing that should not be This is a track that I can't quite fathom the meaning of.  The track itself is very slow and the lyrics seem to talk of soome kind of battle but to be frank I don't actually see any reason for making this song other than to fill up the album.  The lyrics are practically meaningless and the gitar isn't exactly exceptional either.  While it is an okay track, I can't help but feel that they went off the path with this one, a shame really.<br />Rating 7/10<br />Track 4: Welcome home (sanitarium) This has to be one of the best metallica songs ever written.  This sublime track has the underlying plot of dealing with the way mentally ill patients are treated.  Instead of standing on a soap box and ranting about how life should have progressed since &quot;one flew over the cuckoos nest&quot; the band write a song that conveys a view of life as a mentally ill person and with lyrics like &quot;no locked doors no windows barred.  No things to make my brain seem scarred...&quot; you can't help but feel total utter sympathy for these poor individuals.  This song not only manages to be political but also has superb music to go with it.  The guitar is very melancholy and the drums sound heavy with bass, this track is sheer class and is definitely the swan song of this album.  An absolutely sublime record.<br />Rating 10/10<br />Track 5: Disposeable heroes This track takes us back to world war one and shows you life in the trenches through the eyes of a shoulder.  A track that deals with the generals incomptetence well and the music that acompanies it is very fast and heavy with bass.  Adding to the picture of noise, tangible fear and death.  An excellent track that does not fail to follow up the last record.  superb<br />Rating 9/10<br />Track 6: Leper Messiah Here the band go again giving us the picture of life through a certain person in time.  This time we visit the medieval period and see what life was like for a person condemned as a leper, while it does this successfully the band have moved progressively upbeat in this track and it doesn't seem as melancholy as the two tracks prior to it.  This however is not a fault as the track itself is very good and conveys the point of life as a person outside society, another political track that is truly good<br />rating 8/10<br />Track 7: Orion (instrumental) This is a rare thing on any album in rock and metal, and music as a whole.  Outside of classical very few artists opt to write an intsrumental tune and you have to congratulate metallica for doing so.  The track itself ishard to describe the guitar is slow yet somehow makes you sit in awe, the accompanying drums are also well performed.  The two solos that are part of the track are perfect and fit the flow superbly.  The track as an instrumental is by no means excepetional but it fits well on this album and the fact they dared to go creative with instruments rather than sampling or something shows true talent<br />rating 8/10<br />Track 8: Damage inc. This track is very similar to battery and as such serves as a fitting way to end the album.  The track starts very slowly with almost classical theme at the beginning but soon the guitars pick and the tempo rises.  At that point we hear the lyrics and this is a pure assault about being a group causing terror and pain.  The speed is fast and the drums hard, with the lyrics almost at rap speed.  The track itself is a good way to finish off and a worthy addition to this sublime album.<br />Rating 9/10<br />Overall album 9.5/10  <br />This album is a must for anyone, if you are into metal, heavy guitar, rock then you will feel immediately at home.  Other people may take a while to like it but this albumis recommended to anyone, simply buy it as there is nothing at all to stop this from being voted best metal album ever.
B00005A1PR|5.0|This is flat-out the best disc I've picked up in the past year. It's in the CD player so often it should get it's mail delivered there... Sure, Ms. Arie arrives atop a wave of highly talented black female singer/songwriters, but so what? Does anybody dis Iverson just because Kobe happens to be in the league too? And the point here is that India Arie is most certainly in the same league with Erykah Badu, Lauryn Hill, and Me'Shell -- an intoxicating voice pouring out emotionally complex lyrics that buzz around in your head for days on end...
B00005AR3G|5.0|Disney scores another hit with this story of friendship.  John Goodman, Eartha Kitt and David Spade provide fabulous voice-overs for this hysterical tale of two unlikely compatriots becoming excellent friends.  The movie teaches a moral lesson in selfishness.  Tom Jones provides a fabulous main theme song.  Not just for kids, as the humor reaches out to adults on many levels.  Five fun stars!!!!!
B00005ATQM|5.0|If this disc does not absolutely sell you on the DVD-Audio format, you are deaf!  I got the same feeling listening to this DVD as I did the first time i picked up the CD 10 years ago.  This is the way that music was meant to be heard.  It really need to be heard to be appreciated.  Well worth your purchace!
0743506650|5.0|All the good comments in these reviews are true, and more! I was so pleasantly surprised by his voice and narration which accompanied me on my daily one-hour commute to work.  It's like listening to a childhood friend who is so open and honest, and so anxious to tell you all the good and bad things that has happened to him and his career as a writer.<br />King says a lot of ideas for his books came to him in the form of &quot;What if...&quot; questions. A &quot;What if&quot; just occurred to me.  What if someone does not want to stop listening to his tapes and continue driving for six hours, all the way to a strange town where interesting creatures start to pop up....
0670451495|4.0|This book explains a mama and papa duckling who are in search of the perfect spot to hatch their little ducklings.  They search and search for the perfect spot until they find one particular area that seems to meet all of the classifications.  They need to have enough water to swim in, a place that's not too dangerous, and a spot where there aren't such horrid things as bicycles flying by.  They finally find the best location appropriate for bringing up their little ducklings.  It's a cute little story that little children would be interested in reading.  Kids would like the simplicity of the pictures which the author has chosen to use of sepia illustrations without any color.  This simplicity goes right along with the easily understood text that younger children  can relate to.  The book explains that the mama duckling makes sure that her little ones learn all of the appropriate things they need to know in order to make it in the world.  Some of these include: teaching her ducklings to comes when they are called and keeping a safe distance from dangerous things on the road.  These little concepts are appropriate for the intended age level.<br />The story takes place back in the 1940's and this is explained by the type of illustrations used as well.  The book also includes a policeman named Michael.  It desribes him as a heavier man who feeds them peanuts.  Michael also stops the busy traffic of Boston so that the little ducklings can pass through.  Some critics may say that this is a stereotype of policemen.  This might imply that law enforcement officials are maybe not in the best shape and that they might take the time to do meaningless types of activities that other people don't seem to understand.  This is up to the adult to decide as they read this book to children.<br />This would be a nice book to share with younger students in the Springtime.  It's yellow cover which symbolizes the color of ducklings is a good choice.  The smaller size of the book is a goodstyle to use for this intended age level as well.  This book has made a lasting impression for the general body of children's literature.<br />In the classroom, let the children glue yellow cotton balls on their own pieces of poster board to create their versions of little ducklings.
B000059PR5|2.0|The Day After, divorced from the contex of its times, can be seen as a powerfully filmed movie.It is, in effect, the ultimate disaster movie in which instead of a building or a ship, the entire world is destroyed. The film is filled with haunting images. Two of my favorites are people watching as American missiles take off, headed for the Soviet Union, knowing that there must be Soviet missiles headed for them. The other is an airial shot of the hospital, showing the grounds littered with the dead and dying-much like the similer scene in Gone With the Wind. Of course, The Day After should be seen in the contex of its times. It was 1983, the third year of the Reagan Administration, and the left had been whipped into a frenzy over the proposition that Reagan, by opposing the Soviet Union, was certain to start a nuclear war. Hundreds of thousands had marched for things like a nuclear freeze in Europe and the United States. The Day After was really supposed to show what would happen if Reagan was not stopped. The great irony is that the fears expressed by the makers of The Day After never came to pass. History has shown that Reagan was right. By opposing Soviet aggression, especially with his SDI proposal, President Reagan forstalled the horrific future of The Day After and brought into reality the real future, with the Soviet Empire in ruins and American triumphant.<br /><br />(...)
6304696566|5.0|Once you get past the conventions that were required in a Western made in 1956 (e.g. a white man playing the part of Chief Scar, and insulting treatment--by characters in a work of fiction--of Look), what do you have?  Simply the greatest Western made by the greatest director of Westerns in film history.  (For what it's worth--and I think this means something when you're talking about a Hollywood product--THE SEARCHERS was in the top 20 of moneymakers in the year it was released).  Of course a lot of bad movies have made money, but ask Scorcese and Spielberg et al. what films have influenced them. Food for thought for the &quot;enlightened.&quot;
B00003CWTI|5.0|Esoteric films like Magnolia are often judged largely on a basis of stylistic merit; the &quot;how&quot; over the &quot;what.&quot; I'm very much a &quot;what&quot; person, as in I generally care for *what* is being said more than *how* it is being said (with exceptions, like the mesmerizing 2001).<br />For that reason, I'm honestly confused by why it is I loved this movie so much. In a way, to me, Magnolia says nothing, but at the same time it says something beautifully. Don't get me wrong...there's some interesting stuff here. I recognize evident commentary regarding the social and family dysfunction, and especially the intuitive and corrosive &quot;sins of the fathers&quot; theme. However, when watching the movie it went right over my head. I nary gave a thought regarding style during the films entire length, but obviously something was done to make this Magnolia great, because my attention was fixed on the intricate weaves of emotion that sluice the film. The movie is runs for something like three and a half hours, which is LONG, but I didn't want the movie to end. The movie has a quiet layer of psychological and emotional intensity that is powerful, yet it remains indefinable to me.<br />I attribute this film's greatness to the sterling performances of the talented coterie of actors formed around the singular vision of Paul Thomas Anderson. The characters aren't likable people, but wow, they are presented with remarkable acuity. Tom Cruise's performance is especially powerful. Cruise is not a favorite of mine, but when he's good, he's very good. The film's plot doesn't really go anywhere, and one would expect the sundry character threads to come together in a logical, satisfying way. It doesn't. Yet this is one of the movie's greatest merits, as it underscores the elusive theme of subtle determinism and random correspondence.<br />Although it might seem pointless and dumb, the movie has an operatic flair and grandiosity that eludes so many others. There is an ineffable magic to this film. I don't know what 'it' is, but 'it' was definitely exercised here. This is not for everyone; but for those who enjoy it, it is a meticulously crafted film of equivocal yet striking brilliance.<br />Finally, the sound Magnolia is incredible. It may sound like a moronic comment for this kind of movie, but I've seen few of Magnolia's contemporaries take advantage of audio technology like this. I was awed by the astonishing clarity of the bullet tearing through the foliage during the &quot;action&quot; scene. Neat stuff.neffable magic to this film.

B00005B6C9|5.0|I have to admit the teaser's of the title tune I had seen previewed on TV attracted my attention. While I was at our local music store, this album was one of the albums they had available in one of those preview thingies with the headphones. As I jumped from song to song, I realized it wasn't just the title song that was good, but that every song was a winner. My personal favorite on this CD is Walking on Air because it just makes me feel good. Hell, the whole album makes me feel good. Glad to see these stars of the 60's, 70's, 80's, 90's moving on into the 21st century and collecting new fans along the way.
B00005ASOC|2.0|Wow....another movie where you expect so much more!!!  The story line was a great idea but after the first 20 mins the movie just starts rolling down hill.  It becomes predictable and long!  I wanted to like the movie but in the end I was sadly disapointed.  And the kid that played Jamal NEVER smiled what is up with that?
B00005ASOC|5.0|From the director who brought us Good Will Hunting, director Gus Van Sant brings us another captivating motion picture, Finding Forrester, that will tug at your heartstrings.  As an aspiring writer, I felt an immediate attraction for this film.  And as a result, there may be some bias in this review; so please don't hold that against the movie.  <br />Sean Connery's performance in this film could earn him a best actor award by year's end.  His character, William Forrester, is a recluse who had withdrew from society after writing a Pulitzer winning novel.  He shut himself in his Bronx apartment for forty years.  It takes a talented sixteen year old black kid named Jamal (Rob Brown, a virtual unknown) to free Forrester from his self-imposed imprisonment.<br />Although Jamal is intelligent and well read and has the potential to be a great writer, it takes the elder Forrester to smooth out the young writer's rough edges.  The friendship formed between the two is self-serving for both, filling a void both had gained after losing a loved one.  Forrester teaches Jamal the art of writing and passes on to him a torch he knew he could no longer carry.
0395645662|3.0|The &quot;The Giver&quot; is a &quot;wiered&quot; book. Its storyline is quite unexpected, and basically the story isn't really what I like to read. But it turns out that the sense of the book is of a deeper meaning, and afer spending a while thinking of it I realized tahat it's at least a good Idea for a book. But honestly, the ending could be much better. I won't tell why, but be warned. After all the book is easy to read and quite interesting
B00003CXRO|4.0|I don't think that i've ever seen a film quite like this one.  And it's a real tribute to both Zemeckis and Hanks that this particular film was so effective.<br />First i've gotta talk about the ending since there seems to be so many different opinions about it.  In my mind the ending was very straightforward.  Hanks was at a crossroads (in his life).  To me he had definitively ended up deciding in which direction he would go despite the fact that the film ends without him embarking on his journey.  The last direction that he looked is the direction he intends to pursue.  I personally thought that it was a great ending.<br />Zemeckis is to be commended since visually and graphically the film was stunning.  That includes the crash, dental work, casting off, and for me the most emotional moment of the entire film is when the ship appears.  I did not think, going in, that I could be thoroughly engaged and entertained by one man's experience on a deserted island.<br />I could have done without all the FedEx stuff in the beginning.  Although I realize that it was all done to show how time conscious that Hanks' character was.  To me it seemed kinda like overkill.<br />Thoroughly enjoyable.
6304806442|5.0|This is an awesome film, fun and harrowing.  Derived from some of the episodes in Irvine Welsh's transcendently brilliant novel (go buy the book) of the same name, the movie launched much of its cast into stardom (though not necessarily better things).  Trainspotting is perhaps the first heroin comedy, undeniably grim and disgusting (this movie certainly does not glamorize the lifestyle as some critics have charged) but laugh-out-loud humorous as well.  The dialogue is sharp (though it may take a viewing or two before the Scottish dialect can be understood), the soundtrack is excellent (singlehandedly reviving Iggy Pop's career; buy the soundtrack) and the direction by Danny Boyle is outstanding with numerous shots that have been copied by other, lesser directors.  It is endlessly disappointing that the group behind this film have not come close to creating another film as good as this one since (see:  A Life Less Ordinary, The Beach).  But it may not be much of a surprise because Trainspotting the movie sprang from an unbeatable debut novel.
B000002L68|5.0|Prince is one of the few TRUE musical geniuses.  Too many people lavish that title on undeserving musicians.  Prince's sound is unique.  Part rock, soul, jazz, acid... it's all there.  And he puts all those different styles on display in this fabulous album.  No one, save Terence Trent D'Arby, can blend them all together so seemlessly.<br />As always he's a little bit nasty, funky, profound, and poetic.  There's everything from dance tunes to ballads.  All outstanding.  This is an album that sounds as fresh today as it did close to 20 years ago.<br />Not to be missed.
0399146253|2.0|I'm sure I'm not the only one who's tired of Kay Scarpetta's angst and anguish at the expense of a real story.  The distracting and stilted present tense of the prose could have been tolerated.  But re-hashing her last book and the book before that?  Maybe Ms. Cornwell has gotten bored.  I know I have.  The end of the book is an obvious harbinger of the next - because what little new plot there was didn't resolve.  What a disappointing trend from a heretofore favorite author.
0800128052|5.0|This is the most important game of your lives. That's what this gem of a film is really all about. Those words are uttered by 'Dan Devine' the former football coach of the Notre Dame Fightiing Irish football team.<br />Non football enthusiasts have asked me about Rudy and I always tell them that Rudy is not about football. Football is just the backdrop. A setting. It (football) really can be described, in this context, as a metaphor for the game of life. Hence the no excuses line. <br />It doesn't matter if your outclassed. What does matter is do you have the faith, persistence, and heart to really go the distance? And perhaps even more importantly is the question of visualization. That is to say that whatever you can realistically picture in your mind will ultimately become manifest in reality.<br />All that aside, Rudy is a film about guts and about following your own voice even when circumstance and popular opinion are against you. And even more so about the price paid for doing so.<br />If you can watch this film without welling up inside then you've probably never really faced adversity or endeavored to overcome.<br />NOT TO BE MISSED
B00005AFMT|5.0|Many Crimson fans will argue that Discipline is the band's finest album. Discipline introduced Adrian Belew and Tony Levin as new members in the band's re-birth following a seven-year hiatus. An album in which Bill Bruford was challenged to limit his use of cymbals, Adrian Belew's style of singing, guitar playing, and songwriting were a welcome accompaniment to founder Robert Fripp's guitar work and signature Crimson sound. Tony Levin played both bass and stick as the band continued its tradition of bringing new innovations to the rock genre.<br />The playing here is stellar, with each musician performing at the top of his game and further inspiring each other to do the same. From the wild musings of &quot;Elephant Talk&quot;, &quot;Thela Hun Ginjeet&quot; and &quot;Indiscipline&quot; to the laid-back reflections of &quot;Matte Kudasai&quot; and &quot;The Sheltering Sky&quot;, this is an album that influenced a new generation of young guitarists including Living Colour's Vernon Reid and members of Primus. Songs such as &quot;Discipline&quot; and &quot;Frame by Frame&quot; weave the work of the band's two guitarists like fine silk while the rhythm section creates its solid foundation. <br />For the veteran musician, this album is so packed with hot licks it begs to be studied. For the seasoned listener and newcomers alike, Discipline is an amazing collection of spirited songs and the all-out efforts of its disciplined band members. Each of the four band members is among the greatest to have ever played their respective instruments. There is not a bad moment on the album as it pleases moment by moment, track by track.
630339406X|4.0|The film has alot to say about the child in all of us and the need not to become too grown up.  We all need to have a sense of fun and spontaneity.<br />How many other actors could really make you believe that they were an 11 year old boy in a man's body?  <br />But it really is a coming of age tale as Hanks gets to discover more than he ever bargained for in the adult world.  Both good and bad.  A discovery that all young people are beginning to make at that time in their lives anyway.  But what a privilege to be able to see the best of both worlds.  More of us could use that kind of miracle.<br />Whether he's squirtin' silly string out of his nose or sharing a tender moment with Elizabeth Perkins Hanks remain sincere and believable.  <br />An entertaining and heartwarming experience.

B000008H1U|4.0|This album is very untull like in as much as it is more pop-rock.It is not surprising it won the Grammy (perhaps wrong category though) I have all but a few of Tull works and this is quickly becoming a favourite of mine. Rather scary how a few of these tracks sound like Dire Straits. A very nice easy to listen to cd requiring little thought or explanation.
014100018X|4.0|I haven't seen the movie, but after reading the book, I really want to!  Harris creates such a visually stimulating world in the pages, I can already see the scenes in my head.  A scrumptious treat of a book, you'll enjoy every detail, every line.  The village of characters comes alive in full dimension with their quirks and personalities and flaws.<br />If just a bit heavy-handed in the portrayal of the two feuding sides, Vianne and the local priest, Chocolat is still a wonderfully rounded story full of a fabulous cast of secondary characters, each with their own storyline.  Everyone in the story learns or grows a bit, and you'll enjoy the ride!<br />Read it!  Really great!
0375703764|4.0|Some book reviewers have called this title &quot;Pynchonian in scope&quot;. While that is certainly not true, this book is Pynchonian in aim. Just as Pynchon is not the easiest material to comprehend, nor is House of Leaves.<br />The thing that will most easily grab your attention as you casually thumb through the pages of House of Leaves is the page layout. Some pages will have only one word, maybe two. On some pages the words will form patterns. Some chapters seem like a ficitonal version of an e.e. cumming poem.<br />Once you get into the book, you realize that much of the playfullness with layout is parallel to the storyline itself. Mark Schorer in his essay &quot;Technique as Discovery&quot;, wrote, &quot;For technique is the means by which the writer's experience, which is his subject matter, compels him to attend to it; technique is the only means he has of discovering, exploring, developing his subject, of conveying its meaning, and finally of evaluating it.&quot; What becomes obvious, as one reads House of Leaves is that the book could have just as easily been written without the &quot;left-of-center&quot; technique, but much of its charm and personality would have been lost.<br />The story line itself is pretty good ... not great. Those who compare it the literary &quot;Blair Witch Project&quot; are not that far off the mark. It's different: yes. Is it great: not quite.<br />The bottom line is this: If you like to read and are interested in something that is different from what you've been reading, then you owe it to yourself to take this one for a spin. If you are a casual reader who will read if there is nothing else to do (and there is nothing wrong with that), you may want to leave this one and the shelf and pick up something like The Hobbit.

B00005AXEL|5.0|Stevie Nicks is back in  full force. Trouble in Shangrila is the album that everyone has been waiting for from Stevie. The song writing can not be beat. The production is flawless. The voice is incredible. Trouble in Shangrila will remind everyone why Fleetwood Mac became the supergroup that they are. Without Stevie, they would have never accomplished so much in music. This album deserves to go platinum. Stevie is back to save us from the teen pop acts that are flooding the airwaves. Hats off to Stevie Nicks for delivering such a stellar piece of work....
B000002N2N|5.0|Wherein our heroes, the bruthas from Forest Hills, return to the scene of the crime and completely annhiliate a theater filled with pinheads and cretins. Legend has it that the first 10 rows of seats ended up on the stage...I believe it. It's like having your head duct taped to a jackhammer for 54 minutes. It's the greatest live rock & roll album ever made...hell, the first three songs alone qualify as possibly the greatest recorded moment in rock & roll history. Buy it NOW...
B00005AXEL|5.0|I have just recently became a fan of Stevie Nicks and can't believe I have never noticed her before. Her voice first intrigued me on the Practical Magic soundtrack along with Joni Mitchell. Ever since then I have back-tracked to hear more. I am very excited about this new album, and in my opinion it is brilliant. I love how she teamed up with other strong female artists that I happen to like very much such as Sarah(one of my favorites) and Sheryl. Stevie's voice is very unique, it is like none I have ever heard before.
0679879269|5.0|The Amber Spyglass opened my eyes to what books can actually do. Phillip Pullman did a FABULOUS job closing up the series even if it didn't really have a happy ending. I cried. The book couldn't have been better. I would recommend it to anyone who has read the first two books in the series simply because it wouldn't have as much of an emotional impact if you couldn't understand what the heck was going on. It may speak a little strongly against religious beliefs but if you don't take it seriously, no doubt you will enjoy it as much as I did. Phillip Pullman has a very powerful way of writing and describing when it comes to fantasy. If you can imagine, you'll love this book!
B00005B6C9|5.0|This is the album we thought the Bee Gees would or could never make again. Finally, they deliver a product that you learn to love since the first listening; the first Bee Gees new album that doesnt leave you with a tight face and hoping they would remember those innovatives tunes of yesterday; at long last, a new collection of Bee Gees songs that can be SUNG or whistled! More acoustic numbers (though not as many as I would've liked). New Maurice songs and more Robin! Cool.<br />When was the last time we heard the brothers singing upbeat 4/4 rock'n'roll?  Me, it was last weekend, when my breathing stopped with the closing title of the album, Voice in the wilderness. Eddie Van Halen would envy that solo!  :)<br />Congratulations, Bee Gees!
B000002UAR|5.0|Revolver is an album that never quite got the attention it needs. Although Sgt. Pepper, Abbey Road and the White album are all brilliant, I generally consider Revolver to be their best. Paul McCartney, John Lennon and George Harrison all break new grounds with some of their best material ever, and for the last time they really work together as a group. The Beatles were getting tired of doing live shows and began concentrating on studio work, and it really does show. Also, the effects of drugs begin to show here for the first time ( the Beatles refer to Rubber Soul as the &quot;pot album&quot; and to Revolver as the &quot;acid album&quot;).<br />The album starts powerfully with George Harrison's great rocker Taxman, a song about the Beatles bad experiences with taxmen (and I think everybody can relate to this.) Following is Eleanor Rigby, one of my all time favorites. It's a very distinct Paul song, which continues the trend he started with Yesterday. Eleanor Rigby is a beautiful ballad - for the first time on a Beatles album, a song with no Beatles instruments at all (just Paul's vocals and a string quartet). I'm Only Sleeping is one of John Lennon's entries on Revolver, a great song about, well, sleeping. John's vocals on this one are wonderful.<br />Love You To is the first of George's Indian songs. It's quite good, though not as brilliant as Within You Without You (appearing on the Sgt. Pepper album). Here, There and Everywhere is another ballad by Paul McCartney, which never got the attention it deserves. It's a beautiful love song, one of the best love songs ever to be written. Yellow Submarine is, of course, the only major hit on Revolver, though certainly not one of the best songs on it. Paul's wrote and Ringo Starr sang on a fun, happy children's songs.<br />She Said She Said is one of these Lennon songs that don't really make any sense, but somehow they just work, and beautifully so. Wonderful guitar work on this one.<br />Side B opens with Paul's Good DaySunshine, one of the most cheerful songs ever written. A nice, uplifting pop song. And Your Bird Can Sing is another somewhat bizzare John entry, a wonderful song with great guitars and harmonies. Next is For No One, another great ballad by Paul, this time on a sadder note. Really quite touching.<br />It's not really clear what John Lennon's Dr. Robert is about, but apparently it was some sort of in-joke within the Beatles. A good song, fast-paced, rocky and quite funny. I Want To Tell You is another wonderful George Harrison song, the guitar intro is a true classic.<br />Paul McCartney was apparently a little behind in the drug business, so while George, John and Ringo were all on LSD, Paul wrote a song about his first experience with marijuana - Got To Get You Into My Life. A very good song.<br />The album ends with Tommorow Never Knows, one of the most incredible songs the Beatles ever recorded. Written and performed mainly by John, it's their first psychedelic song. Wonderfully done, with beautiful, hypnotising vocals and some great effects from George Martin.<br />Revolver didn't generate as many hits as Rubber Soul before it or Sgt. Pepper after it, so it hardly has any presence on the collection albums ( only TWO SONGS on &quot;1962-1966&quot; while Rubber Soul has SIX! ) Therefore I urge you - If you love music, BUY IT!
B000001FI7|5.0|I highly recommend buying this CD for yourself or anyone you know who is open to this genre of music.  This is a CD I could listen to almost every day for a lifetime and never tire of it.  Every song is enchanting and hypnotic.  It is my favorite CD in my collection.
B000002OX7|5.0|Nearly every song on this album is a classic. 'Wont Get Fooled Again' is my favorite Who track ever, and one of the best songs of the seventies. There is not a single track that I haven't listened to over and over again. The only song I don't really love that much is 'Water'. It's a cool song, but this isn't even the best recording of it. The alternate version of 'Behind Blue Eyes' isn't really neccesary, as it is very similiar to the other version on the disc. Still, this album is an absolute must. It makes me wonder why the band seems to be most famous for Tommy. I love their rock operas, but nothing can touch this album.
0380730367|2.0|After four engrossing and original novels, Lehane takes a major step backwards into triteness and cliche with &quot;Prayers for Rain:&quot;  Good guys beat up bad guys.  Bad guys beat up good guys.  Good guys really beat up bad guys.  Bad guys . . . well, you get the idea.  The excessive violence is accompanied by excessive sex, with various characters going to bed with each other for no good reason.  It seems that Lehane has finally succumbed to the difficulty of writing a series:  he has run out of ideas, and is filling up pages with graphic content that he hopes will sell.<br />The characters are also less interesting or even stereotypes, including an unethical psychiatrist, a dysfunctional family, and a sociopathic ruthless criminal.  The latter two are all too reminiscent of previous Lehane novels.<br />I hope that there will be a sixth Kenzie/Gennaro story. I also hope that Lehane waits until he has one of his uniquely original plots before he writes it.
6305090564|4.0|I feel like a hypocrite, I hated both Mummy movies by Stephen Sommers, but I love this movie! It is my number one guilty pleasure. It was all around cheese, but it knows it and doesn't care, therefore giving it a lot of room to have fun, which it does. The plot is thin, the fx, are decent, and the acting is...well there, but everybody looks like there having fun, I can imagine this movie was a blast to film. The action in the movie is well paced and exciting, especially the totally unbeleivable, yet thoroughly exhilarting jet ski chase through the belly of the ship at the end of the movie. The dialogue is 100% cheese, but fits the movie perfectly, even the one liners are pure gold. I'm not a big CGI fan, but I liked the fx in the film, the half digested villain is some of the best CGI I've ever seen, even rivaling Episode 1. This movie was lambasted by critics from all over, I should have done the same, but I did not have the heart, it was just too much fun. If you liked both of the Mummy movies by Mr. Sommers, you get a real kick out of Deep Rising!
B0000524CY|5.0|I recently purchased this movie, and I have to say, it is better than it was in 1973. I don't find it very scary, but it is very suspenseful (to me at least). But I'm not trying to downgrade this movie. It truly stands as the scariest movie of all time, and is also the best movie of all time. This version, the version you've never seen before, includes over 12 minutes of never-before-seen footage, plus the REAL ending. Bravo to performances by Linda Blair, Ellen Burstyn, Max von Sydow, Jason Miller, Kitty Winn, and a cast of others. And a wonderfully demonic voice done by Mercedes McCambridge.
B000005IZ8|5.0|This is the soundtrack to Godfrey Reggio's film of the same name; a sorta-sequel to &quot;Koyaanisqatsi.&quot; Incredibly pretty films with ideas best appreciated by the Unabomber in all of us. (Well, not in me, but diff'rent strokes . . .) They REALLY deserve to be on DVD.<br />I first heard this soundtrack, uncut, on public radio, via John Scheaffer's amazing New Sounds program. Go listen to the sample tracks and imagine hearing this stuff, without commercials, while cruising down the Long Island Expressway at 11:00 PM on a steamy summer night. Utterly mind blowing.<br />The tracks alternate, roughly, between sweet and sincere ethnic themes, and variants of the the monstrous, awe-some, terrible, profound and beautiful &quot;Anthem.&quot;<br />As other reviewers have mentioned, bits of this score are beginning to turn up in films. I feel so utterly damn cool and avant-garde when the freakish music I listen to ends up in movie and commercial scores.<br />Buy it.
0804106304|5.0|In The Joy Luck Club, novelist Amy Tan used the Chinese traditions of astrology, the five elements, and gung shih along with American literary devices to establish the mothers' apprehensive tone and the daughters' contemptuous tone.  Through a series of personal narratives, Tan captures the hardships faced by the Chinese immigrants in the strange, unfamiliar America and the tensions between the Chinese-born mothers and their American-born daughters.  The Joy Luck Club uses ancient Chinese astrology to define the characteristics and personalities of the women.  In ancient Chinese history, it was said that Buddha invited all the creatures to see him, but only twelve came, so he honored those that came by naming a year after them, and this became the Chinese astrology. \\"She [Waverly's mother] has the strength of a horse.  A Horse born in 1918, destined to be obstinate and frank to the point of tactlessness.  She and I make a bad combination, because I'm a Rabbit, supposedly sensitive with tendencies toward being thin skinned and skittery at the first sign of criticism\\" (183).  The two are set against each other by the uncontrollable fate of their birth date.  The Chinese culture believes the five elements (wood, water, wind, metal, and fire) determines a person's temperament and how they will react in different situations.  \\"My mother once told me why I was so confused all the time.  She said I was without wood.  Born without wood so that I listened to too many people\\" (213).  Throughout the story the narrators allude to the elements as the source of a action.  Fung Shih is the Chinese idea of the world being in perfect balance.  In order for life to be good and for us to have good luck, your life must be balanced physically as well as mentally.  \\"When something goes against your nature, you are not in balance.  This house was built too steep, and a bad wind from the top blows all your strength back downhill so you can never get ahead\\" (112).  Fung Shih is a powerful force in the narrative \\"The Voice from the Wall\\" told by Lena St. Clair regarding the trauma of her mother's stillborn son.  The daughters consider these Chinese traditions more Chinese superstitions, the communication and cultural barriers brought about by the lacking of understanding bring about the tensions felt by both generations.  Tan also incorporates motifs, symbolism and irony into the novel to give the tone and achieve her purpose of showing the hardships faced by the Chinese Immigrants in the unfamiliar society and the distances between them and their daughters.  Tan uses the directional motif throughout the novel, especially stressing on the importance of the east, from where all begins.  \\"I know her corner on the table was the East.  The East is where things begin, my mother once told me, the direction from which the sun rises, where the wind comes from\\" (22).  The story begins in the East in China from which their mothers' history begins and journey to the west in America, where the daughters are from.  Ironically it also concludes in the East with Jing Meo Woo's journey to her mother's homeland and past.  Amy Tan brings together the classical element of American Literature and Chinese history and culture to achieve her purpose of depicting the struggles for identity and the tensions between cultures and generations in The Joy Luck Club.  I thoroughly enjoyed this book, and learning about the history of the Chinese culture.  It's a good story for any mother or daughter.
0451169514|5.0|The one thing that I have always loved about King's writing is his characterization of people in small towns.<br />Seven school losers band together to fight the most evil being of all of Stephen King's antagonists. A being that has the capability of making people see their worst fears come to life.<br />The seven children are linked together by their ability to see the being manifest itself into a clown (something I have always feared as a child) and terrorize them.<br />Another good book about good versus evil.
B000003BF1|5.0|This album is where the Stones really came into their own, where Jagger and Richards made it sound like they wanted.  Although you can't always get what you want, I think Keith Richard's guitar soundscapes here are nigh on perfect, from the intro to Gimme Shelter, to the bass line he plays in Live with Me, to the guitar that counters the bass line in Live with Me, to the riff in Monkey Man and to almost all guitar parts in between (Mick Taylor only plays bits on Country Honk &amp; Live with Me). Keith established his style and stamped a template for rock n roll on this record, my favorite Stones album by far.<br />No Stones album is complete without a throw away song or more and I'd nominate Country Honk here.  Otherwise, there are some classics: Gimme Shelter is chilling, Live with Me is pure crotch rock.  Ian Stewart's piano carries Let it Bleed.  Mick's harp and lyrics on Midnight Rambler paint a dark but vivid picture.  And rock and roll guitar players who want to play a thousand notes should listen to Monkey Man and hear how Richards creates a rich song with a simple riff.<br />Unlike the original LP, the CD includes a list of who played what on each song.  Lots of surprises.  A fine, fine album.
B000002P2V|3.0|The follow up to &quot;The Who By Numbers&quot; show's Peter Townshend trying to take the group towards a new direction where they wouldn't become a parody of their former selves. This works well on &quot;New Song&quot;, &quot;Sister Disco&quot;, and &quot;Music Must Change&quot; but John Entwistle's compositions here conflicts with Pete's and in the process creating a very uneven album. With Roger Daltrey singing almost all the songs, he becomes hectoring, trying to put his stamp on the material and find some common ground. Keith Moon, whose personal life was spinning out of control and close to being fired from the group, played probably his weakest set.<br />Ironically, the title song is one of the best performances the Who ever gave.<br />This reissue, remixed and remastered by Jon Astley, sounds superb. It also includeds the Who's version of &quot;Empty Glass&quot;, one of Pete Townshend's most personal songs.
0684833395|3.0|In Catch-22, Joseph Heller uses a flashback structure and irony to make reader not only see how horrible war is, but Heller utilizes comedy to first make the reader laugh then have the reader be disgusted with what they were laughing at.  Heller structures Catch-22 in a jumble of flashbacks of events and repetitions. Heller may first mention something very random at the beginning of the book, and make it seem like it's some joke.  However, then later on in the novel he'll actually tell the situation behind the first mention of it, and it sickens the reader to learn what truly happened.  For example, Yossarian, the main character in the book, has a \\"dead man\\" in his tent.  At first this just seems to strengthen the opinion that Yossarian is insane.  Heller repeats this use of the \\"dead man\\" all throughout the book until finally he tells the reader who the \\"dead man\\" really is.  The \\"dead man\\" is a man named Mudd.  Mudd transferred into the same squadron that Yossarian was in, but immediately went on a mission after he put his stuff in Yossarian's tent.  He was killed on that mission, but his paperwork hadn't actually transferred him into the squadron.  Therefore he was never actually in the squadron.  That means his stuff still lies on one of the beds in Yossarian's tent, and no one can take it out because it's really not there.  At first the reader may find the mention of the dead man to be humorous, but when the reader finds out the truth they feel disgusted with what they were laughing at.  Another structural episode that is repeated numerous times throughout the book, deals with a man named Snowden.  At first he is just mentioned, and once again this adds to the thought that Yossarian is insane.  Then near the end of the book Heller tells the reader what really happened with Snowden.  This graphic description of Snowden's death sickens the reader and once again enforces the purpose of the author to show how horrible war is.  Irony also is very prevalent and purposeful in conveying Heller's message from the book.  One instance shows how corrupt the management has become.  The leaders of the squadron want them to go bomb a bridge to form a roadblock, or that is at least what they tell the men.  The truth is they just want to get a nice picture of a \\"bomb pattern\\".  They don't care that this will kill innocent civilians, all they want is their stupid \\"bomb pattern\\".  It is ironic that the commanders don't uphold that decency of not killing people just for the fun of it when they should.  They really don't care even if their own men die, just as long as they get some recognition.  Another irony demonstrating how war twists things, happens through the chaplain.  It says \\"the chaplain had sinned, and it was good\\".  This is ironic because the chaplain is supposed to uphold some sort of righteousness even in trial, and now when he sins it is good.  A paradox that also portrays how war really messes people up is the fact that Yossarian thinks that everyone is \\"trying to kill him\\".  At first this statement seems ironic, but the more the reader gets into the book the more truth it has. Not only does the enemy try to shoot Yossarian down, but his own commanders are trying to kill him by making him fly more missions.  Colonel Cathcart, the leading colonel of the squadron, keeps raising the number of missions therefore giving more chances to everyone else to kill him.  In an indirect way the colonel tries to kill him, and according to Yossarian so is everyone else.  War has made him paranoid, and it destroys any sort of faith in goodness or even any kind of truth.  War has completely warped everything that he is.  Heller's purpose is to show how terrible and twisted war can make a person.
0684803356|3.0|Please don't dismiss me as one of those idiots who can't spell and says a book is &quot;boring&quot; because it's long and they'd rather be listening to heavy metal music. I read &quot;Moby Dick&quot; and did not find it boring. I read &quot;Bleak House&quot; and did not find it boring. I read &quot;Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire&quot; and did not find it boring. But &quot;For Whom the Bell Tolls&quot; is, well, boring. Here's why: I never gave a damn for this Hemingway hero Robert Jordan. He seems like a pretty aimless tough guy, making love every fifth chapter and cussing around trying to be cool. The ending was entirely unsatisfactory - we end up having gone just about nowhere. Fortunately, Pilar is an interesting character who adds some spice to the proceedings. The only real point to this novel seems to be conveyed by its fine title, a reference to a John Donne poem. Loosely, the poem conveyed the idea that whatever happens to any human being ought perhaps to be the business of all of us. In the case of the novel, Hemingway draws attention to the largely overlooked Spanish Civil War and its suffering. But he does so with the title page alone; the rest of these 400 pages add little to this noble premise. Hemingway needs a better plot to devote his fine style to.
0790729628|3.0|The film is just GREAT! One of my best 3 movies of all times. But, opposite to most people, I think the original version (not the Directors cut) is the best. The DVD has almost no extras, and for a film that had raised so many talking, its a shame! All I want is a double DVD set containing both versions, with all the possible extras, something like what have been done in the Alien Box.

B0000024RQ|5.0|This is just a great album.  It is full of wonderful lyrics and simple beats from when it was just Dylan with his guitar and harmonica.  Blowin' In The Wind is a great song that most people my age don't even know is his because it's been covered so many times by so many people.  There's a reason.  It is as good now as it was then.  Well, I wouldn't know about then since I'm 17 years old, but you get the point.  My personal favorite songs on the album are Masters of War and Don't Think Twice it's Alright.  Masters of War is just full of such raw emotion that you can't help but get angry at those who &quot;build the death planes&quot;.  Don't Think Twice it's Alright is more fast paced and a great song.  This is probably my favorite Dylan CD, and that's saying a lot.

B00004W3MS|5.0|I believe this record is the most innovative style I have ever seen. It is four guys from Iceland getting every bit of sound out of the instruments they have and keeping it all pleasing and insightful. Jon's style of singing makes this album shine. I went to see them at the Fillmore in San Francisco and I can assure you they can replicate if not heigten every peice they make. Along with Radiohead's Kid A, this is the future of music, for those who are willing to not shield their eyes.
B00000IAU3|3.0|I bought this cd after hearing a couple of ok songs and reading rave reviews. However, I don't understand why she has shot to fame so quickly. Says a lot about what publicity can do. Now she has this artsy reputation which she doesn't deserve at all. Her voice is good, but her lyrics are flat and the whole thing is a bit ho-hum. For a similar sound but a lot more intelligence I like Natalie Merchant, Sarah McLachlan and, of course, Sinead. She remains unparalleled.
B00005AXEL|5.0|Truly amazing - what a great album.  I can't think of one track that isn't a pleasure to listen to.  &quot;Too Far from Texas&quot; is probably the best song on the album, though - Natalie's and Stevie's voices sound so good together.
B00005B6C9|4.0|Having been a fan of the Brothers Gibb for more years than I care to count, I would rank this as one of their finer works. Barry, Robin and Maurice have put together a tight, introspective grouping of songs and lyrics, as evidenced by the title track. While there are a few clinkers here and there, I was impressed by the stripped-down-to-basics theme of this album, such as &quot;Man in the Middle&quot;.They're in good voice and harmony here, and listening to the music one is reminded of the ups and downs they have faced in over 30 years in the industry. As a bonus you can view the video of the title track and a biography of the band on your computer.

0553213105|4.0|Pride and Prejudice is an enjoyable love story first and foremost but it is also an interesting commentary on the way that society used to look at the institution of mairage along with role of women with in that same society.  The storyline is augmented by wonderful characters such as the witty Mr Bennet and the rediculus Mr.Collins.  I very much enjoyed reading this book and would readily recomend it.
B00000G3PA|1.0|This is without a doubt the worst movie I have ever seen. It does not have a single redeaming quality. Not even the special effects are good enough to make this movie worth seeing. It is real trash.
0670888656|3.0|This book is a normal book for my liking. The plot was a little strange at the begining, but I was able to pick it up the farther I read into it. I liked the setting in the 1800's era where not to much was known about the scientific world. The only thing that kept me glued into the story is the characters. Mr. Jekyll had a problem being lonely, while Mr. Hyde was crazy like a young teenager. When he killed the Dr., then the story was more exciting. Overall, I think everyone should read this book just because it is classic horror.
0312243022|5.0|This is an absolutely brilliant book! Days after finishing it I still feel full of its glow, its love of life.<br />My literature group first read Virginia Woolf's Mrs. Dalloway, and I would highly recommend that anyone considering reading The Hours first read Mrs. Dalloway. The way Cunningham uses the various characters, scenes, and \\"things\\" (e.g. pears, a necklace, flowers) in Mrs. Dalloway adds a richness, a continual reverberation to the reading experience. He uses some very differently, although often they are parallel, and they would nearly always surprise me  -- Mm, here's this strange fascination with pears! or Oh! Buying these shirts after lunch is just like buying the necklace!... He delves into the soul of Virginia Woolf herself, writing her own novel. He remakes her characters of Clarissa, Sally, and Richard in light of modern sexual mores. And he  honours Woolf by  showing how one of her readers, Laura Brown, will go to great lengths to absorb herself in reading Mrs. Dalloway. <br />That said, Cunningham certainly makes The Hours a complete novel unto itself (I think! I can't completely imagine reading it on its own.) The plot is entirely unique in its amazing construction, and the ending is totally unpredictable. <br />The intertwining of the 3 main characters, Virginia Woolf in the '20s, Laura Brown in the '50s and Clarissa in the '90s, adds some insightful historical perspectives of how women's lives have changed throughout the century. <br />I think Cunningham's greatest feat with The Hours, however, is the love of life with which he imbues it. He helps us understand the importance of savouring the immense beauty that each moment, each hour, each day, has to offer -- despite tragedies and pain and suffering.  The last few pages absolutely glow with this love of life. I've been left with the lingering warmth and happiness of this book for days and days.
B00003CXHJ|1.0|This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen.  Matthew McConaughey can act, but with this poor excuse for a movie he is given no room to shine.

1573221562|5.0|I absolutey adored this book! If you are into period pieces, journal entry style writing, dark and moody environments, suspence, and supernatural happenings, check out Affinity. I don't know if Sarah Waters intended for the reader to be as entranced as the main character Margaret, but that is what happened to me. This is more than a book, it is an experience. The reader, if suseptible to it, can become as entranced as Margarette is, by Selina and the 'supernatural events' which take place. While reading it you fall under the same 'Spell' as the main character. A spell cast by the Spirtual Medium Selina Dawes. I found myself experiencing the same trust, and finally shock that Margaret feels at the end of the book. I don't want to give anything else away! Just give it a shot. You won't be sorry.
B00005AFVR|3.0|I attended the Atlanta concert (my first Springsteen and E Street Band concert) and was overwhelmed. I looked forward to the release of the live CD with great anticipation; and thus my disappointment when I received and listened to it. The selection of songs was curious (how can &quot;Badlands&quot; be omitted) and the editing was very choppy. Only &quot;Forty One Shots&quot; stands out. For my money, &quot;Live 1975-1985&quot; is a much better investment in a live Springsteen CD.
B000050IL0|5.0|Fans of Glenn Gould will love to see this; a chance to watch Gould perform with great camera work from &quot;Bruno&quot; and company. The visual element inherent here may even win over some people previously opposed to Gould's approach. Great sound, great editing. It is, for the die-hard Gould fan, a cathartic experience. Glenn was near death when this was filmed, and it shows; he looks horrible. Thin hair, pancake makeup, ink stains on his fingers, and one rather obscenely long nostril hair make Gould seem almost corpse-like at points. But there is still his performance to cherish: a inimitable genius, totally lost in his art. Overall, a very interesting and rewarding document.

0679805273|5.0|I give this book to each of my nieces and nephews as they graduate and they all love it. They have told me that they take it out many times and reread it. They grew up with Dr Seuss so they trust him.

B000059XY7|5.0|I was glad to see 'Superman' available once again for purchase. I couldn't find a copy to buy for the longest time, and was happy they decided to rerelease it in a special edition. The restored film was a pleasure to watch again, but the extras on the tape made it extra special. Not having made the jump to DVD yet, I am pleased when tapes get the 'extras' treatment. Although not as decked out as the DVD, the tape offers the films trailer and the screen tests for the film. It was enjoyable to see other actresses such as Anne Archer and Lesley Anne Down try out for the role of Lois Lane, as it was clearly evident why Margot Kidder was chosen. All in all, a good package for us still stuck with VHS technology.

I was recommended David Sedaris by a friend who was reading Naked, and we have taken turns reading chapters out loud to each other. I would be at work reading to myself, and my boss had to ask me what was making me crack up so much!!! I don't normally laugh out loud when reading a book, but he is great!! not only is he funny, he writes the words in a way that you can hear his voice (even if you have never heard him speak before) .. my favorite so far is the essay about his french class! I highly recommend this book!
B00003BDXG|1.0|First, my objection to this movie has nothing to do with violence or the quality of the film-making. The violence is stylized and I have seen more gratuitous violence in supposedly mainstream movies. And the movie is made with craft and a lot of razzle-dazzle editing and effects with every sort of technique and mixed medias.    However, I feel the movie fails abysmally as satire or social commentary, which it was purportedly supposed to be all about. Stone has tried every form of explanation to justify this sorry, ugly mess he's put on the screen, but his rationales just don't wash.    First, everyone on screen is repellent. Absolutely everyone. Except, of course, for the Indian shaman which is SO politically correct and such utter nonsense it belongs in some other film (looks borrowed from Stone's The Doors, matter of fact).    Okay, it's black satire so everyone is supposed to be repellent. Well, that would work except his purpose here is supposedly to show how the Media glamorizes and sensationalizes violence and the perpetrators of violence. But, everyone Mickey and Mallory murder are unattractive and unsympathetic as well. We end up with lowlife dregs mostly killing other lowlife dregs. It's hard to care. And I think this failing undoes the movie.    The fact of the matter is that spree killers and serial killers murder your daughter. Or your brother. Or your mother. That they are then made the center of Media attention/obsession thereby giving them fame and a sort of glamour...well THAT is obscene. The fact that we will remember the Dylan & Klebolds, the Dahmers & McVeighs of this world while their victims go unheralded to their graves is an injustice worthy of exploration and comment.    Don't look for it here. Stone makes the worst sort of error in that because everyone around them is venal, Mickey & Mallory don't look so bad. He glamorizes the killers. Just exactly what he supposedly thinks the media is guilty of, and thereby creates his own sort of love affair with these detestable swine.    Stone's protagonists are just another loathsome couple of airheads on the run in Nowhere USA, killing equally loathsome dehumanized victims. His resulting effort is loud, busy, noisy and obnoxious. It is one of the purely ugliest presentations I've ever seen. But all that heat sheds no light anywhere. At it's core it is empty and heartless. It has become what it is supposedly satirizing, and that makes this effort as obscene as its supposed targets.
B00005AFVR|1.0|I saw Springsteen in the Meadowlands at the beginning of his tour August 7, 1999, and he was teriffic.  By the time he got to Madison Square Garden he was bored.  He tweaks the numbers and tries to stylize them to be artistic.  All he succeeds in doing is providing second class entertainment.  Buy some of his older stuff and you will be better off.

B000002G23|5.0|'Message in a Box' is perfect for any Police fan, old or new. It includes all five of their released studio albums plus various unreleased recordings. All of the albums are quality, but 'Synchronicity' is the best. The last five tracks on it, including &quot;Every Breath You Take&quot; and a smashing &quot;Synchronicity II,&quot; make this set worthy of purchase. I have always been a mild Police fan, owning the singles collections. But after hearing this, I am hooked. The only unworthy material on this box set are the first couple tunes that were previously unreleased. If you grew up after the Police were in vogue, you will find many pleasant, musical surprises on this collection as I did. Everyone wants the Police to reunite. I think they got out at the right time, while they were at the peak of their career.

B00005B1W5|4.0|What a wonderful concert video set in two magical places in the world and, if you are a fan of New Age music, the tunes and the playing do not get much better than this. It was great to see audiences very different from those we always see react to beautiful music and superb entertainment. How about David Hudson, eh?; what a guy!!! The sound of the 'duduk' will always haunt me... Yanni, please use this instrument more in your music! <br />Having been so effusive in praise of this DVD's content why am I giving it only 4 stars? That is just to tell the dumb marketing person who decided to release the pan and scan version, instead of a widescreen and anamorphic version, what a wonderful opportunity was missed by trying to save a few dollars. Actually, both P&amp;S and widescreen versions could have been released on the same disc! Imagine viewing the Taj Mahal and the Forbidden City in a widescreen vista!! How nicely that would have set off Yanni's orchestra! The original video quality would have been excellent (I own the VHS version also) so making an anamorphic version should have been a cinch. May I remind the marketing person, too, that the demographic of those who might watch this video would include lots of more mature people with a good deal of money and the financial power to buy widescreen TVs. Lastly, I have no complaints about the DD 5.1 sound mix.
B00004Z4SD|5.0|'High concept' is a term usually used to describe blockbuster films with plots that can be summarised in one line, preferably five words long. 'Old man drives lawnmower to meet striken brother' sums up 'The Straight Story', but doesn't really do it justice. Basically a long meditation on growing old, it's a slow-moving road movie that nonetheless remains riveting from start to finish, like a cross between 'Koyaanisqatsi' and 'Wild at Heart'. It's also the only film in which Harry Dean Stanton looks relatively young. Richard Farnsworth's performance in the lead role is excellent and understated, although it's hard to separate the character from Farnsworth (who was suffering from terminal cancer, and who took his own life shortly after the film was released) himself. Faults? Lynch keeps his surrealistic instincts in check most of the time, but they burst out in a pointless scene with a woman who keeps crashing her car into deer. And a later scene, in which Farnsworth walks into a bar and has a beer and some emotional catharsis, seems a bit abrupt and contrived. But that's just being mean. This a great film, one well worth seeing, with a superb soundtrack from Angelo Badalamenti. It harkens back to a short period in the very early-70s when Hollywood produced low-budget, small-scale gems, and gives you faith in cinema again. If there is a cinematic opposite of 'New Jack City', this is it. As for the DVD, you just get a trailer and subtitles, and it's in proper widescreen. The dark bits - and there are quite a few dark bits, as the film takes place partly at night - are sometimes a bit jagged and blocky, but the picture and sound are otherwise fine.
0790734060|5.0|to Mr. Toshiro's review, currently a &quot;Review of the Day&quot;.  Jeepers, what a know-it-all.  He complains that  *Amadeus*  is  &quot;loud&quot;  and  &quot;pushy&quot; -- unlike, say, DON GIOVANNI!  Or a few other select Mozart operas.  What -- THE MAGIC FLUTE is a  &quot;quiet&quot;, &quot;subtle&quot;  piece?  Spare me.<br />Here's the deal:  certain works of art are subtle; others are not.  Mozart's art was often both.  The film  *Amadeus*  is joyfully not subtle, God be praised.  Mr. Toshiro complains that Milos Forman demonstrated a lack of  &quot;innovation&quot;  in this film.  GOOD.  Because one can imagine what a muddied pile of dreck this story would've been if someone like, say, Alain Resnais directed this thing.  Certain stories demand the bold, popular approach.<br />My point being, snobs need not apply in regards to this wonderful movie.  Indeed, most  &quot;serious&quot;  classical dilettantes hate this movie, in much the same way the Shakepeare posers hated  *Shakespeare in Love*.  These are THEIR cultural artifacts, baby; God forbid the rest of us might enjoy them!  If you're hung up on the lack of accuracy in  *Amadeus*, you've woefully missed the forest for the trees, my friend.  Of course it's a fable -- duh.  What would you prefer -- an A&amp;E Biography?<br />Eschewing  &quot;innovation&quot;  for entertainment, *Amadeus*  succeeds in making classical music seem like an exciting, essential thing.  Beyond that, it boasts fine performances from a talented cast, with all the juicy melodrama that they can sink their teeth into.  Who can resist?  If you can, you just don't like movies, brudda.  *Amadeus*  is a popular . . . yes, POPULAR  (loud, pushy, &amp;c.)  classic for the ages.  Well -- there it is!
B000002J20|4.0|This is the album that most people love or hate due to it's giant and mammoth nature. There was, and is simply nothing as ambitious and sprawling as this. I tend to fall closer to the former category, as I enjoyed this otherworldy listening experience. Personally I tend to love music and albums that are deep, artful, and basically anything that has alot to get out of, and &quot;Tales From Topographic Oceans&quot; is no exception. &quot;The Revealing Science Of God&quot;, is my least favorite piece of the album, yet is still a good listen. &quot;The Remembering&quot;, is very beautiful, featuring Jon's heavenly vocals, Rick's swirling synths. This piece has to do with memory, the past, and the impressions that are left on the mind.<br />Side 2- &quot;The Ancient&quot;, my favorite piece on here. This epic features middle eastern type influences, particularly the drumming. This piece is very mysterious, frightening, dark, cryptic, haunting, and ends with Steve's beautiful classical guitar backing Jon's vocals. &quot;Ritual&quot;, is another outstanding piece. This also features middle eatern influences and somewhere in the middle has a spiritual-like drum solo.<br />Overall, I really enjoyed this work and I admire Yes for having the guts to release an extraordinary album like this.<br />...And one more thing, I personally do NOT recommend listening to the album all the way through in one shot. It's probably better to listen to 1-2 tracks at a time to really get the full appreciation of each outstanding piece. Then if you feel up to it, listen to all of it. <br />Thanks for reading my review.
B000002BBY|5.0|This is the best album Oasis have ever done. Every track is brilliant, 10/10 for each song on the album. 'Hello' opens the album perfectly, with the line 'It's good to be back' - very significant. 'Roll With It' continues the fast rock trend that we saw in 'Definitly Maybe', 'I think I've got a feeling I'm lost inside' repeated at the end is a highlight. 'Wonderwall' - there is nothing more to say, sheer brilliance. 'Don't Look Back In Anger', argubly better than the previous track, Noels voice suits it well and it remains as one of the finest Oasis tracks ever. 'Hey Now' is a flashback to the debut album, very rocky and lots of guitars. 'Some Might Say' is one of the best singles released by the band, deservidly getting to ~1 in the UK charts, this is a classic. The lyrics may not mean anything but when a song is this good, they don't need to. 'Cast No Shadow' is dedicated to Richard Ashcroft, he and Noel are the best songwriters of this generation. This is a beautiful tender ballad, just right in the middle of a full-on rock album. 'She's Electric' is a fun, happy affair. The 'Digsy's Diner' of the album, a very successful hit, everyone I know who has this album regards this as a standout track.<br />However, with nine previous brilliant tracks, the album reaches its peak right at the end with the final two, epic tracks. 'Morning Glory', the title track of this epic album, is a mass of guitars and heavy drums. This is pure brilliance. Again, meaningless lyrics but still a landmark song. One of the best of the 90's. And then we finish with THE best song of the 90's, brilliant lyrics, superb chords, amazing rhythm and a lead guitar solo to die for (check the live version out on 'Familiar To Millions', 'Champaigne Supernova' is the finest Oasis track, in my own view, to date. Brilliant. Long live Oasis.
630407185X|5.0|Unlike Saving Private Ryan, A Brigde Too Far focus on warfare rather than focus a group of soldiers in WWII. An all-star team of actors and actresses gathered in this epic-making war film since The Longest Day. It was the most expansive, most cast member and most extras in a single film. No such movie will ever be made again.  A Bridge Too Far is about Operation Markets Garden--an operation that could end WWII early before Christmas. Watch the inception of the operation, the planning, the opposing force, the air drops, the bombardment, etc.
B00004Z459|5.0|... I was afraid I'd only like one or two songs on this CD, but Linkin Park didn't let me down. It doesn't matter if I'm sad, happy,[mad], or asleep. &quot;Papercut&quot; gets me hyped up and the rest of the songs just keep me on that natural rush. The high energy feel of the CD is the same straight through or on random. The added bonus is if you stop to listen to the words, it's a whole other level.
6300183211|5.0|I'm 16 years old, and i thought a lot of you might want a teen's perspective on this film. I first saw it when i was like, 8, but didn't understand it, so i decided to re-watch it a couple weeks ago. This movie is incredible. Al Pacino pulls off a cuban so well, i couldn't believe it. Thismovie is packed with some of the coolest scenes out of any movie. There's also a lot of dark humor tucked in some scenes. There is no other way to describe this movie, except incredible. It's a little on the gory side, but, all women i've known who have seen it have loved it. Michelle Pfiefer is incredible in this movie, but, she's always pretty good. WOW... WOW, If You Haven't Seen This, Check It Out!!
0385495323|5.0|The author has done the impossible. He's taken a complex subject and explained it in a clear and often entertaining way. At the same time, he did not oversimplify or water down the material.<br />It has as much information as a textbook, yet I found myself reading it as if it were a novel. If it were possible to give more than 5 stars I'd do it without hesitation.
B00000JMG7|5.0|I was very excited when I learned this was being released. I am a fan of great blues and blues/rock guitar playing and Rory Gallagher certainly fits the bill.  This 2 cd anthology of his BBC recordings provides a fitting tribute to the now deceased Irish guitar hero. The first disc contains material from live concerts broadcast on the BBC while the second disc contains material recorded in the BBC studios. The set was recorded from 1971-1986.  Rory Gallagher was one of the first world famous Irish rock musicians.  He has influenced either directly or indirectly many of the Irish groups that followed such as Thin Lizzy and Gary Moore. He sort of reminds me of the Irish equivalent of Johnny Winter.  Both are under appreciated and adept at playing both blues and rock.  They played some of the same festivals, broke into the scene at the same time and play both acoustic and electric guitar equally well.  The set includes some tracks not included on his studio albums.  I think the live disc is the better of the two simply because of the live energy Rory was able to generate in concert (all of his live albums are worth picking up). My favorite cuts on the live disc include a killer version of &quot;Calling Card&quot;, &quot;Used To Be&quot; and the trio of cover tunes &quot;Got My Mojo Working&quot;, &quot;Garbage Man&quot; and &quot;Roberta&quot;. Notable cuts on the studio side include &quot;Hands Off&quot;, &quot;Feel So Bad&quot; &quot;Toredown&quot; and &quot;Hoodoo Man&quot;.  The only drawback is that it isn't longer.  I keep hoping they will get around to compiling a box set which will contain all of my favorite tracks along with some unissued live and studio recordings.  Until then I recommend this set along with the remastered versions of his original albums.  It is also worth investigating his early more improvisational work with Taste.
0452281881|3.0|I loved the idea of following a story by reading emails of the participants. I guess it appealed to the voyeur in me. On the whole, however, I was disappointed. Once you realize that a character is two faced (says one thing to subordinates and anothe to superiors) it loses its shock value. Seeing the same behavior again and again isn't funny.<br />There are far too many characters introduced with little preparation. A table on an inside cover of all the people and their titles/functions, perhaps an org chart would be a big help.<br />I would recommend skipping this title, unless you happen to be in the advertising business. In that case, the familiarity of the subject matter and the personalities will probably have so much appeal that the near-miss effort by the author can be overlooked.
B000006SGT|5.0|This 2 cd anthology contains the complete Mickie Most recordings from 1964-65.  This anthology contains prime slices of British Invasion R&amp;B and blues.  Perhaps overshadowed by the Beatles, Rolling Stones, The Who, and the Yardbirds, the Animals were still a great group.  The dominant features of this import set are the singing of Eric Burdon and the organ playing of Alan Price. Chas Chandler who later produced for Jimi Hendrix plays bass on this set.  Hilton Valentine handles the guitar duties.  Included in the set are many of their classic songs.  &quot;The House Of The Rising Son&quot;, &quot;We've Gotta Get Out Of This Place&quot;, &quot;Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood&quot; and &quot;It's My Life&quot; to name a few.  Some of my other favorites include &quot;Gonna Send You Back To Walker&quot;, &quot;I'm Going To Change The World&quot;, and &quot;Boom Boom&quot; among many others. The set also features some previously unissued tracks from these sessions.  Fans of the British Invasion and the British R&amp;B/Blues scene need this set.  It contains early period material only.  Fans of their psychedelic era need to look elsewhere.  Essential compilation!
B000056V73|4.0|&quot;Almost Famous&quot; was a good, enjoyable movie. The story is well-told and tight, the sub-plots well-wrought and interesting. I honestly liked all the characters (especially Frances McDormand's mother-- a great persona!) and found much of the story to be quite sweet. And that's not something I find myself saying about movies that take place in the 70s or are about rock bands.<br />Goldie Hawn shines through her daughter's smile. It was really nice to see the talent and beauty passed on. Definitely worth renting!
B000002W9P|4.0|...you will find what is ultimately a very good album. The guitar work is very good - complex, intricate and always varying. The lyrics are little annoying but then most lyrics are. Finding an album with good lyrics really is an added bonus. There are no fillers - even the hidden track &quot;Judas&quot; (available on some CDs between &quot;A Tale That Wasn't Right&quot; and &quot;Future World&quot;) is really good. The epicness of the album is well crafted, and Michael Kiske has a very good voice on a par with Bruce Dickinson and Geoff Tate. My only complaint is that they sound very much like...Iron Maiden...except much cheesier with a more European sound.<br />Although Helloween have written some naff songs (see part 2 of this Keeper... duo) they aren't here. Again, if you can see through the cheese then you will be awarded...
B00005B6C9|5.0|This CD grows on you.  You just can't write this group off!  Somehow they've managed to stay completely true to their roots and yet stay completely contemporary!     I really like how Robin-heavy this CD is.  It seems the last two decades have been monopolized by Barry.  He is the main voice and writer on most the hits.  Rightfully so, too.  But Robin steps up to bat this time and hits a couple of home runs, most notably with the lively &quot;Embrace&quot;.      &quot;Voice in the Wilderness&quot; is very rock-oriented.  Thank God!  I'm in my 40's and I loved this song.  Don't know how the MTV market will take to this, but I enjoyed the stray into a heavier sound.  Sounds like Barry and the band are having a ball performing it too.      A lot has been made of Maurice's two songs.  &quot;Man In The Middle&quot; and &quot;Walking On Air&quot; are both great little numbers, but are outweighed by the quality of work surrounding them.  Still, the variety is great!      &quot;Techincolor Dreams&quot; really put this CD over the top.  It almost made me jealous.  Is thery any genre of music Barry can't write in?       &quot;Deja Vu&quot;, in my opinion, is the only miss.  Didn't care for that one.       You can't go wrong here!  This CD has something for evryone is and is an out-and-out delight!
B00000IP3S|4.0|I you're new to Blind Guardian then I recommend Tales From A Twilight World or Somewhere Far Beyond first, but make no mistake - this is still a great album. [Actually], it was my introduction to Blind Guardian and I was blown away! Generally, it's more epic than those other albums I just listed and it has a more medieval style as well. I'd say the song-writing was more sophisticated too. You're probably asking why they're better albums. Simply because I feel that this album tapers of a bit to the end. The last couple of songs aren't as good as the first few, and generally I feel that the other albums have more good songs. But as I said - still an excellent album. Highly recommended...
0684853523|5.0|I purchased &quot;On Writing&quot; for my wife as a christmas present.  However, as I had just published my first novel &quot;Strike Hard&quot;(ISBN: 158851322X AmEricaHouse), I found the information that he gave refreshing and informative.  I utilized many of the concepts that he discusses in the working for the sequel to my novel, and have been given new avenues to follow during this.  I found the biographical information humorous, sad, and informative.  In my own quest to join the literary world, I found many of the same stumbling blocks that Mr. King did, and have used his experiences to avoid a few also.        In conclusion, I feel that &quot;On Writing&quot; gave me an insight into the mystical world of authors, and has helped me look forward to my own career with renewed interest and vigor.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|Buskers can survive entirely on a repertoire of songs by The Beatles and be assured that they will never starve. In fact, my introduction to the winsome `Eight Days A Week' was via a three piece street act outside Central Market in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. The simple chords, the catchy melody, the beguiling innocence of youthful romance, all conveyed through two guitars, a tambourine and a two-part harmony. I stood there charmed by the refrain, \\"Hold me, love me, hold me, love me, ain't got nothing but love, girl, eight days a week\\" and willingly parted with my dollar. I thought if more buskers would croon The Beatles, the city streets would be a much better place. But I realise, of course, the Fab Four did not write songs just for three-chord musicians.<br />The Beatles are a study in market positioning. They introduced themselves as happy popsmiths, creating instantly accessible hand-clapping numbers like `Love Me Do' and `I Want to Hold Your Hand', and got as many number ones as they can in a short time.<br />After the easy pop hits, The Beatles began to churn out more complex rock songs `Hey Jude', `Get Back' and `Come Together'. Since they have gotten everybody's attention, it was no wonder their number ones just kept coming, even with songs as eccentric as `Yellow Submarine', `Eleanor Rigby' and `Paperback Writer'. Which brings us to the point of this album, which is a collection of all the number ones ever scored in either UK or USA. Unfortunately, this means that it misses out on some more eccentric but also more wonderful songs; yes, nothing from Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band - considered their magnum opus - made it to this compilation. But that didn't stop it from becoming number one in 33 countries within a month of its release. Though it does not have the integrity and conceptual unity of one of The Beatles later albums, it is nevertheless a winning formula for a good ol' time. This album will make buskers of the whole world yet.
B00004YKUY|5.0|I am a die hard Journey fan and was quite skeptical of a new singer.  Journey, without Steve Perry, seemed impossible.  I watch the VH1 special on Journey (isn't Steve P bitter!) and heard some of the new tracks before the release of Arrival and I was hooked from the 1st time I listened.<br />Right now DIRECT TV is showing a concert from earlier in the year, taped in Las Vegas and it is fantastic.  They have the same great energy and great sound as they always have.  Anyone that thinks the Journey ended @ &quot;Frontiers&quot; is sadly mistaken and shoud NOT consider themself a &quot;Journey Fan.&quot;  &quot;Rasied on Radio&quot; had a lot of good songs as did &quot;Trial by Fire&quot; (admittedly not their best album).  Can every album be better then the last?  They're musicians, not gods!  &quot;Arrival&quot;, as a whole, is as good (if not better) than &quot;Rasied on Radio.&quot;  If you are a true Journey fan then you will love this record.  If you are a Steve Perry fan, you will be bitter about it.  I love Steve Perry but I was pleasantly surprised to see the bad did not miss a step when the replaced him with the &quot;new Steve.&quot;  <br />Still, I hope one day Steve Perry will reunite with the band but that looks to be a school boy's dream @ this point!  Enjoy the album!
B00004Y6TQ|2.0|Maybe you need to see the movie first? I don't know but with only seven songs/orchestrations and being an aligned piece (The songs fit within a framework.) I decided that I should have gone with another selecton from Bjork's catalog as my introductory. I was dissapointed both with the individual songs and the work as a whole.
0805047905|5.0|...The large colorful pictures are great (albeit not accurate, a purple horse?).  The rhythmn of the verse is great, and of course by now...I have memorized the text, so we recite in the car, or at the park...anyplace...I highly recommend.
6305910324|5.0|The first time I saw this movie (2 weeks ago on cinemax) I couldn't believe it.  What an amazing film.  I immediately went out and purchased the DVD.  Now I can watch it as often as I want.  I can't believe this masterpiece didn't garner more attention, especially when time came to give out awards.  Oh well, I guess we're talking about an institution that gives awards on how grand special effects are compared to the acting and true beauty of a film.  This one should have cleaned up at the oscars.<br />Anyway, if anyone out there is just THINKING about getting this movie, do it.  You won't regret it.  I promise.
0307120007|4.0|My 15 month old son has enjoyed this book for many months.  He likes to pat the bunny the most.  The perfume that comes &quot;on&quot; the book is a horrible smell to me.  But he doesn't seem to care.
0767817664|5.0|This gem of horror from 1985, featured Roddy McDowall as the great vampire killer, who is quite shaky, though ends the film with much bravery, William Ragsdale as a sex-crazed teenager and Chris Sarandon as a new neighbor with a little bite. Also showing up on the scene are Amanda Bearse as the present-day Mina and Stephen Geoffreys as Evil Ed, who is an absolute riot in the film. This vampire classic is not only for me, the best vampire film, but perhaps the best horror film. This movie is one of the great definitions of entertainment. There's some great special effects in the film including a very freaky Evil Ed-wolf and a menacing Jerry Dandridge-bat. Tom Holland, a master of horror who's also directed Child's Play, and written such creepy-pleasers as The Beast Within and Psycho II has given this film a great foggy atmosphere and vibe-full colors, and a great 2:35.1 widescreen aspect ratio that is an incredible delight. This film also stars Jonathan Stark from House II.
B00003CXPD|5.0|This is certainly the best movie I have ever seen !! I don't have words to describe how beautiful it is... I came out of the cinema so happy, so complete... I will always remember this film like a very good thing that happened in my life... It showed me many things that we cannot hide. If you wants something, and are afraid of get it real, you MUST  see it !! Congratulations, Stephen Daldry and Jamie Bell !!
B00004U9MS|5.0|Being English, of course i like to be patriotic about british bands (especially great ones like Travis &amp; Colplay), but this is something else. This album, apart from the Crash test Dummies album 'God Shuffled His Feet' has got to be the most beautiful of ALL TIME.<br />Its just so good. A bit 'same'y' towards the end but, wow, Coldplay are going to the top!
B00000IPAX|5.0|great cd with hilarious sex jokes and great music what more could you want! They are all great and I can't find a song on their cd that I don't like. This cd was great and actually had some hidden messages in it too most of which were pretty funny others had a serious note. This punk rock band really knows what they are doing and are great performers plus the album cover of this is very nice and so is the back
B00004YA66|5.0|&quot;Frequency&quot; is an excellent drama filled with great acting, suspense, true emotion, and a tremendous amount of accuracy.  I am a huge fan of the &quot;Back to the Future&quot; trilogy, but I am well aware of how difficult it is to keep the audience believing and also attentive to detail (important in such suspense classics as &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot;).  Due to a commitment to consistency by the director Greg Hoblit (except for one blunder explained in the commentary) and phenomenal acting by both Dennis Quaid and James Caviezel, it is easy to stay attached to the plot and feel sympathy for the Sullivan family.  In response to questions in reviews about how Frank beats cancer, you can see him throw away the last pack of cigarettes his wife offers him towards the end.  As far as the DVD goes, the audio commentary is informative and helpful to make realizations you may have missed while watching this underrated thriller.  The few deleted scenes included are intriguing as well, especially when John carries out a conversation over the ham radio with his childhood friend that would have been a welcome bit of comic relief had it been included.  New Line continues to deliver great movies and nice packages on it's Platinum Series DVDs.  Don't miss out on this quality movie.
B00004SVID|4.0|This is, as has been noted, not terribly different from the original disc, only better. Included here are additional musical moments, particularly from Richard Wright. For various reasons, he had not contributed much to the original WALL, and hearing his participation in the live shows makes this more of a Pink Floyd product and less a Roger Waters solo endeavour. [The only thing that all Floyd fans can agree on is that there is a difference.] Also the long version of &quot;Empty Spaces&quot; from the film; and Roger inviting the audience into the implied death-threat of &quot;Run Like Hell.&quot; I would recommend that anyone who has not already gotten the original, studio version to get this instead; it may not be necessary for those who have it, except to say that it IS what you have, only better. How often does that happen?
B00005AAFS|5.0|I purchased this disc while on a trip in stuttgart and listened to it on the ICE train from Stuttgart to Konstanz, gliding through the sunny valleys of south germany.  Incredible experience, the music supported the land, the people and the whole presence of existence in germany.<br />wonderful
6304504012|4.0|It appears that admiration for this film version of Evita depends upon which you saw first -- this film, or the stage production.  Those who saw/heard the stage presention first will favor it, and those exposed first to the movie will prefer the film version.<br />I thought the film was just great.  I received the film soundtrack as a gift long before I saw the movie.  I happened to be ill, and for three days, all day long, I listened to the sountrack again and again.  The music is fabulous, the melodies terrific, the integration really fine.  The story formed itself in my mind solely from the lyrics... I pictured Antonio Banderas, as Che, playing a walk-on minstrel-narrator who occasionally dropped into the scene, not unlike Nat Cole and Stubby Kaye in Cat Ballou -- and the movie, in fact, after I finally got to see it, bore out that impression.<br />Antonio was preferable to Mandy because of the accent.  The Che character NEEDED that accent, rolling R's and all, and Antonio provided it perfectly.  And Madonna was super.  If only fate had offered this role to her ten years earlier!
0441172717|2.0|Herbert is one of those people who have a great imagination, with beuatiful skills of creativity.  These people can create amazing worlds in their head, with politics, culture, and a unique language.  The only problem is, he can't write.  I am an avid reader, and recently decided to pick up this renowned novel.  I was sorely dissappointed.  With such poor development( I do not mean an introduction-I hate introductions.  I mean actual coherency), I could barely bring myself to finish this book.  Don't waste your time.  This so-called &quot;Brilliant&quot; sci-fi novel is nothing more that a pieced-together third-rate material.  (By the way- anyone who wants to tell me that writing isn't as easy as it looks- I am a writer, and would be glad to email some of my stuff to anyone who contacts me.)
B00000G3PA|4.0|Well, i know, i know, i know that the plot is dumb, but so then WHAT?!, the acting was really very good, the FX great,and also i's very exciting, even more than Deep Impact, yeah, Deep Impact was good for me, but Amrmageddon it's better, i don't care about what some losers and critics think about this film, they can bite my (bleep), Armageddon it's not excellent, it only fails for the plot, but this film was made with the purpouse of entertaining people, and give them somehow a good time in the movies,i just can't wait to see &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot;
B000002ADT|5.0|If you are considering buying this album, I pray for your soul if you choose not to purchase it.  Simply put, I pictured heaven as harps and angels before this album.  But, as said, this album &quot;must have been made in heaven!&quot;
B00001NFCY|5.0|This cd is amazing.  I had only heard &quot;Higher,&quot; then &quot;What If&quot; before I got it and I loved them both.  The whole cd is awesome, though.  &quot;The Faceless Man&quot; is one of my favorites.  The lyrics are passionate as well as the music overall.  It's moving and powerful, meaningful.  I haven't heard the first disc, but I want to get it as soon as I get a chance to look for it.  I would recommend Human Clay to anyone who likes good, heavy rock and is looking for another album to add to their collection.
0790729407|5.0|This is a brilliant film! Not only does it have you captivated with the action and romance, but it is pretty accurate. The best thing about this DVD is that you also get the documentary with it that explains why Neil Jordan decided to make this film. I thouroughly recommend this film for anyone remotely interested in Irish history.
0783225849|5.0|Mild mannered secretary Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) is in a position where she's practically begged to steal $40,000 - her employer gives it to her to put it in the bank right after her boyfriend Sam (John Gavin) tells her he can't marry her because he's in debt.  She packs her bags and leaves town; en route she's caught in a thunderstorm and checks in at the Bates Motel.  She's greeted by Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins) a shy but friendly young man whose possessive &quot;Mother&quot; doesn't share in his liking for the young woman.  Norman brings her her a late supper and they have a talk which convinces her to return the money - after she takes a shower.  Terrifying, startling and influential shocker still holds up after more than forty years and countless imitations.  Was shot in black and white for no other reason than Hitch thought the blood would be too upsetting for audiences, and this also boasts the first onscreen toilet flush - which made the censors even more paranoid than the murders.  DVD includes an insightful 93 minute &quot;making of&quot; documentary as well as trailers and newsreels and production notes.  Followed by three sequels two decades later, a TV movie and a remake in 1998.
B000002H72|5.0|Full of the eclectic rhythms and beats expected from previous Pixie music (Come On Pilgrim EP, Surfer Rosa). This one takes it step further creating in the process a collection of classic tunes you'd be an idiot not to aquaint yourself with. This time things are more clearly defined than Surfer Rosa, yet still spread so widely it feels like more than one band's output of music. There are the head-thumpers (Tame, Debaser, Crackity Jones), the more mellow rock rifts (Wave of Mutilation, There Goes My Gun) and other classics that splice and merge between creating the unique sound we've come to love from them (Monkey Gone To Heaven, Gouge Away). Out of all the Pixie CDs, this is definitely my favourite because it contains so many fantastic songs, all with no further ado, let's run through them.......<br />1. DEBASER - fantastic tune, which I'm sure everyone on hear has mentioned is connected to that french film (Un Chien Andalusia or whatever). Forget that and just judder to the fantastic juttering guitars and simple drum beat that keeps a song aboput slicing eyeballs so up tempo!<br />2. TAME - Definitely one of my all time favourite songs, mainly down to it's simplicity and the sheer excess of Black Francis's vocals, using it more like an extra instrument to the band's repertoire, which he likes to grind away on, pushing it through the high and low chords without strain but yet putting across such emotion and power. A short song but fantastic on all parts (listen for Joey torturing his guitar) and it doesn't matter if the words make no sense when you've got such an amazing song. a ha a ha a ha! taaaaaaaaammmmmmmmmmmmeeeeeeeeeee!!!!!!!!<br />3. WAVE OF MUTILATION - Another favourite, this time with a much gentler verse that seems almost like poetry. The backing of guitars and drums are so in tune, it feels like a wave of music (how crny that sounds!). Great song where Francis keeps the vocals in check to match the theme.<br />4. I BLEED - A beautie sleeper song that could slip you by. Kim comes in on backing vocals and the jive twists between their overlapping and the throng of guitars as they cry &quot;I bleeeed!&quot;. Fantastic backing guitars on this one.<br />5. HERE COMES YOUR MAN - One of their better known songs, but not one I love them for (although if you've got the B Sides Album check out the video because its hilarious watching them standing their like a wedding band for hire, gobs wide open to represent their singing, hilarious!). Good little tune for it's nice rift and mellow flow which contrasts so amazingly with the more dark songs one here.<br />6. DEAD - Slightly more hard-core, dependent less on vocals now and more on guitar grinding and drum wrecking (to a degree). Once again Black Francis keeps the vocals playing a part as they twine the guitar chords to give them more dominance.<br />7. MONKEY GONE TO HEAVEN - Another well recognised song that despite a calm rift and plinky-plonking of piano, still doesn't feel at odds with the rest of album as you can always feel the dark side to it as Francis screams &quot;and if the devil is 6, then GOD IS 7!!...&quot;. Beautiful.<br />8. MR GRIEVES - Weird....seems to be just another song but it stretches, seeming to want to be a poppy type but yet still concerning nutso themes and the clanging of the guitar's throng. Yet, it still doesn't suffer, and comes off as a nice little song to put your back into position with (ahhh, my back's killing me!).<br />9. CRACKITY JONES - Fantastic song similar to Tame and Blur's &quot;Song 2&quot; with it's pumping energy and vibrant pace. Talking about cocaine, which considering it's effect makes the pacing genius, as Francis screechs through this one; his vocals trying to outpace his, kim's and joey's manic thrashing.<br />10. LA LA LOVE - Ditty tune that is another funny contrast like HERE COMES YOUR MAn, with it's pop love song mocking that keeps the lyrics and instrumentation simple but yet sounds so fresh, delightful indeed!<br />11. NO. 13 BABY - Nice body-churner, after LA LA LOVE this is the perfect follow-up as it gets you warmed up for GOUGE AWAY. Drums take a more prominent place at points but as ever it Francis's sliding voice and all guitarists plucking that get you turning the volume up and make your body mock their movements.<br />12. THERE GOES MY GUN - Simple rift, simple chorus, simple words, all again but once more they make it sound other-worldly as they rock along. <br />13. HEY - Despite not having any real connectin to anything on hearing, this song feels fantastically emotional, especially when Frank goes &quot;We've chained!&quot;. Amazing control here as they never leave lapses or let things rush, timing the bursts and vocals perfectly.<br />14. SILVER - Weird one that i can never listen to properly cause it's so haunting despite it being very hard to make out exactly what they've talking about at times. Kim and Francis's vocals really come into play here, complimenting each other perfectly.<br />15. GOUGE AWAY - One of my favourite songs of all times as everything comes together; Black Francis straining his voice through lyrics concerning parties, marajuana and generally a song that seems to talk about a person's self-destruction (gouging away at themselves). The guitars  try to keep it calm but even they can't restrain and rise to their crescendo as Black Francis tries to destroy his vocal capabilities.<br />If your just getting into the Pixies then this may be a good start as you'll probably recognise HERE COMES YOUR MAN, MONKEY GONE TO HEAVEN and likely heard of TAME through the smirnoff Advert. Good idea to move onto Surfer Rosa from here (just a tip).
B00000JGHM|5.0|Totally awesome. I was blown away by the plot of this movie, not to mention the cinematography of which the way this film was shot. The the best part about this movie? It's really, really long. Pop this baby in your 5.1/6.1 HT system, and you'll be saying Wow faster than the way gasoline are going up in the past month in California.
B000002MTU|4.0|I just recently got into the blues, but I had already heard of Eric Clapton.  When I got this CD I was wowed again by his awesomeness on the guitar.  He is the best in my book.  I can't wait to hear more of his stuff in the future.
B00000ADG2|5.0|This album is timeless. The songs are carefully crafted and sung. Everything is wonderful in here. I especially love &quot;To Zion&quot;. A mother's love for her child. Ex-Factor is lovely too. Everything is wonderful here. Keep making the wonderful music, girl!
B0000399WI|5.0|What more could you want?  Not heavy on extra features, but why would you need them with a film of this quality?
B00003CXS4|5.0|&quot;Snatch&quot; is alot of fun!  You can't help but love the lead characters, even though they are, for the most part, just a pack of losers.  Brad Pitt is truly marvelous as the mush-mouthed gypsy (which I read was a take on Benicio Del Torro's &quot;The Usual Suspects&quot; character) and, as in &quot;Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels&quot;, Vinnie Jones is a major scene stealer.  The plot twists are great and I never found myself getting bored.  While similar to &quot;Lock, Stock...&quot; in some ways, it is definately it's own film.  If you like your movies fasted paced, violent and wildly funny, then see &quot;Snatch&quot;.  You will love it!
6305807086|4.0|I went through 3 months of intensive psychotherapy after watching this.  The puppeteering is cool.
B00000K2SE|5.0|I am a sci-fi Fan, and normally, all I am is disappointed by how good a film &quot;could have been if only they had done... or not done...&quot;. The Film 'The Matrix', however, is the exception to my usual sci-fi blues.  It is intelligently written and, more importantly, the storyline is maintained throughout the entire movie.  The special effects are intensely captivating and are, to say the least, stunningly performed.  Everytime I watch it, I find another aspect of the film to enjoy.  It is, in my opinion, one the most superior sci-fi films to date.
B00000K19E|5.0|This dvd has more and better utilized features than any other.
B000002UAR|5.0|I began to hear those famous chords of the Beatles as soon as I was born. Now here I am 20 years later and I still love to here the Beatles. I Listen to them daily, and I always have them I my truck. I can basically say that Revolver ranks just as high as Abbey Road or Sgt. Peppers.  In fact I like to call it the ultimate transition album, there rockin in the old style, but just at that point before they explode into Sgt. Pepper!  All in all the album is awesome, and it ranks among the greatest albums ever produced!
6305736650|5.0|An all time classic love story.  Why don't they make movies like this anymore?
B00004XONN|5.0|Where do I begin? Radiohead has released a beautiful album, but if you came expecting guitar-heavy tracks such as &quot;Electioneering&quot; from OK Computer, or even &quot;Lucky&quot; (Also on OK Computer), you better turn your expectations away. This is quite a bold step, moving away into a lighter, electronically enhanced genre. The first noteworthy song on the album (Also being the first on the album) is &quot;Everything In Its Right Place&quot;, a song that keeps it all together. &quot;Kid A&quot; comes next, and is a fine song. &quot;The National Anthem&quot;, the third track, I remember from Saturday Night Live, where Radiohead put on one hell of a show. They do just as well here, and this is another standout track, and is much different than some parts of the album - the track features a mesmerizing bass line which eventually gets drowned out by jazz musicians giving it their all. The song gets more hectic as it goes on, and then is followed by a calmer tune - &quot;How to Dissappear Completely&quot;. A very beautiful song, and the &quot;aaa-haaa&quot; sound you will eventually give in to, and love this one. Next, comes the transitional &quot;Treefingers&quot;. This one is just instrumental, short, and quiet. It seems out of place, but it's actually a nice transition to the next song, &quot;Optimistic&quot;. &quot;Optimistic&quot; is a genuine rock/pop song that rides the line, but has a 70's feel at the very end. This one is also very good. After this, comes &quot;In Limbo&quot;, a song that rides the top of my charts. After this comes my favorite on the whole CD, &quot;Idioteque&quot;. This song features simple lyrics put to a mesmerizing beat. That, and having it be the first purely electronic track on the album, will only ensure that if you don't like it at first (On Saturday Night Live, when they performed it; I preferred &quot;The National Anthem&quot;), it'll at least grow on you. After this comes &quot;Morning Bell&quot;, transitioned from the end of&quot;Idioteque&quot;, and the continuity works. Last on the album is &quot;Motion Picture Soundtrack&quot;, which I like for its originality. This song is cinematic, and Radiohead displays it well (It sounds just like a motion picture soundtrack, silly!). There are 2+ minute gaps between the where the song begins, and seemingly ends (a glissandi-esque effect in the middle).<br />It may seem weird to a few, but I guarantee that this album will be worth it for most people.
B00000K0DT|4.0|Entertaining film, but not as good watching it the 2nd, 3rd, 4th time...  No interesting special features.
B00003CWOL|3.0|There are very, very many really good things in this movie, but in the end it is marred by an inability to pull all the elements together as well as by a really weak ending.  Oh, and another weak link:  the depiction of God.<br />God doesn't fare well in cinema history.  Nothing is harder in a movie than to represent God in compelling fashion.  Alanis Morrissette's cart wheeling Yahweh is easily one of the least convincing.  Even worse than Will Smith's turn as Bagger Vance AKA Jesus in another movie featuring Matt Damon.  Or George Burns in his incarnation as the I WHO I AM in a couple of dreadful films with John Denver.  In fact, I can think of only one truly moving portrayal of God in film:  Rex Ingram's &quot;De Lawd&quot; in GREEN PASTURES.<br />This is a film of ideas, and if you don't like ideas, you won't like this film.  To me, Kevin Smith is at his best when putting ideas to use.  He is at his worst when engaging in physical humor or gross humor (the worst moment in the film--apart from Alana Morrissette's turn as the deity or the general ending) is the monster composed of feces).  Well, he is also good as sex jokes, though perhaps a few too many are made in the course of anyone film.<br />Also, the movie doesn't have a good pace, and sometimes lurches forward only to rock backwards again in a few minutes.  I suppose I echo the editorial review in saying that Kevin Smith writes brilliant scripts but isn't nearly as polished as a filmmaker.<br />Moving to the good side of things.<br />It is frequently really, really funny.  I laughed a lot, and a lot of the images in the film have really stuck with me.  Like the &quot;Buddy Jesus&quot; statue from the beginning.<br />The cast was, I thought, pretty strong, if slightly unexpected.  Not including Jay and Silent Bob (their showing up in a Kevin Smith film can hardly be termed unexpected), you get Ben Affleck, Matt Damon, Linda Fiorentino (I have always had a massive crush on her), Jason Lee (the lead singer of the band in ALMOST FAMOUS, here playing a demon decked out in a splendid white suit), Salma Hayek, George Carlin, Janeane Garofalo (big crush on her also), Alan Rickman, and Chris Rock.<br />The movie is neither overly disrespectful of God (I had several friends studying for the priesthood when I was at Yale Divinity School, and I am certain they would all have had a hoot watching this) nor iconoclastic.  Overall, I recommend this movie, and if you aren't expecting perfection, I think you will get a kick out of it.<br />Kevin Smith themes:  in every one of his flicks, there are references to hockey and STAR WARS.  The former is fulfilled in obvious fashion with the hockey stick wielding punks.  The latter in having Carrie Fisher appear in a small role near the beginning of the film.  Keep a sharp eye out for her, or you might miss her.<br />PIECE OF TRIVIA:  the old fella who gets beat up at the beginning of the movie by the hockey stick wielding punks is Bud Cort, who had a small but memorable role in the movie M*A*S*H and the title role in the Robert Altman cult flick BREWSTER MCCLOUD.

B000002AP1|4.0|I'm only beginning to really get into old-school punk.  I just borrowed this CD from a friend, and I can't wait to buy it myself!!  I just played it tonight, and I just HAD to share my thoughts in this forum.<br />First of all, RAW POWER really rocks.  Imagine a faster, more more bare-bones version of the 1960's Rolling Stones (when they were really wild) turned up a couple of notches, and that only begins to describe Iggy &amp; The Stooges circa 1973.  I guess the only CD I know that sounds sort of similar to RAW POWER is the debut album by the New York Dolls, which is the only old-school punk CD I own...so far.<br />This CD immediately kicks into high gear with &quot;Search And Destroy&quot; which is a great anthem for those times that still holds up today.  It's got great fast rhythm and lead guitar by James Williamson.  Very raw indeed. :)<br />The second song, &quot;Gimme Danger,&quot; starts out surprisingly soft with slow acoustic guitar strumming and gradually builds into a punk crescendo of very raw proportions, with some heavy feedback by Mr. Williamson.  It kind of reminds me of the Stones' &quot;Paint It Black.&quot;<br />Then we get back to full-steam-ahead with &quot;Your Pretty Face Is Going To Hell&quot; (Originally titled &quot;Hard To Beat&quot;).  If you listen carefully to the 3-chord guitar riff in this and other songs on this CD, you can hear the late 50's - early 60's influence present in the music.  It's just transformed into wild stuff here. :)<br />&quot;Penetration&quot; features growling, sexual vocals by Iggy that are heavy on reverb.  You can just hear how much of a sex machine he was back then! It's sure to put you in the mood for...something.<br />&quot;Raw Power,&quot; as the title song, is a bonafide classic with some memorable lyrics.  I like the way Iggy leers, &quot;Raw Power is sure to come a-runnin' to you!&quot; This song reminds me of the Stones' &quot;Street Fighting Man&quot;...played about twice as fast!<br />&quot;I NeedSomebody&quot; has a slower, bluesy rhythm to it (believe it or not) but is undeniably early 70's punk.  This song actually has a well-defined, and memorable chorus, as Iggy sings &quot;I need somebody, baby...just like you.&quot; The rhythm section, provided by brothers Ron and Scott Asheton on bass guitar &amp; drums respectively, keeps a good steady pace and provides the backbone of the song.<br />&quot;Shake Appeal&quot; is faster, catchy, and actually features handclaps!  Talk about a TRUE punk first. :)  It also features &quot;Yowwwww!!!&quot; screams by Iggy, that I know must have influenced David Lee Roth later on.  <br />The final track, &quot;Death Trip&quot; is long (5:52, by far the longest song on this record), but fast and steady in it's guitar riff. It's also quite a wild track. Everyone gives his all here.  Another memorable line from this song, repeated a couple of times, is &quot;I with you, you with me, Baby, we're a-goin' down in-a history.&quot;  That makes me think that Iggy knew exactly what he was doing at the time-- he knew that he and his band were going down in history as one of the seminal voices of punk, which almost nobody else was doing at the time, except for the New York Dolls.  Hearing both of their early CDs now for the first time, it's pretty evident that they both set the example that would be followed later on by the great punk rock bands of my generation, namely the Sex Pistols, The Clash, and Black Flag.<br />Now all I need to do is to return this CD to my friend, buy this CD myself, and then check out more of Iggy's long, tortured career.  I can't wait to share the pain right along with him! :)
B00004Z400|5.0|&quot;White Pony&quot; is was the best thing I heard of all 2000. Hands down.
B00005AFVR|4.0|If you own Springsteen's earlier three CD concert set, you might start out a bit dissapointed with this album.  The sound is a bit muddier, the recordings are brilliant but have a little bit of washout... the kind of sound you might actually get at a concert.  I think that this was purposeful, to have recordings sound more real.<br />The deeper you go into the CD, the better things get, with remarkable performances of 41 shots, 10th Avenue Freeze Out, Lost in the Flood, and other songs.  The E Street Band is having fun, enjoying playing, and that comes through.  Well worth the inexpensive price.
0553208845|5.0|I read this in college.  I read it again recently and realized just how much this book had affected the way I think about my life and priorities.<br />Most books do not address such issues, even obliquely.  Certainly, a book can be enjoyable, even sublime, without such proscriptions.  But because of its lyrical relevance to the practice of living,  I have found that Siddhartha has become a part of me in a way which few other books have.<br />Siddhartha is an inquiry into the &quot;good life&quot; and reifies the contours of the many paths that purport to lead there.  I certainly haven't adopted the lifestyle of this book's ascetic protagonist, but I have come to see the darker side of a life lived for consumption.  As with Siddhartha, I have become aware of the ability of possessions to enslave as well as liberate.<br />It's a lesson that I don't think I would have learned didactically, and, of course.  I learned it while following the life of someone who let himself become enslaved, and I continue to learn as I find myself being similarly enslaved.<br />Hesse has a knack for bring a western reader, like myself, to the world of Eastern mysticism.  It is a world I would otherwise have difficulty observing.  Wisdom is a rare commodity and it surfaces in far flung locales.  Hesse has mined distant shores for a few precious nuggets and puts them on glorious display.<br />This rural midwesterner is grateful for the the view.
B00004XMV6|5.0|This is the best movie EVER for both Mickey Rourke and Kim Basinger!<br />Ok if you want to look at it as a hot sexually sadistic movie, that's one way to look at it. But how about combining this with a mind game movie?<br />Haven't you seen how an independent successful woman (Elizabeth) Kim Basinger lose it all? Haven't you seen how (John)Mickey Rourke take control? Oh this is a game of power. Two wandering hearts fill in love, two erotic souls heat up the air and two minds playing a game! <br />But who is to win?!! Two wounded hearts, two shattered souls and one DOMINANT MIND!<br />It makes you shiver as (...) counts you'll be back before I count to ...!<br />Oh and the sound track of the movie is PERFECT!
B0000041ZT|5.0|It's curious the power of the cine industry in promoting unknown or forgoten scores. A Kubrick's picture - '2001 Space Odisee' - became the starting fanfare of Strauss' 'Also sprach Zarathustra', in perhaps the most successufull 20 or 24 bars in the music history and, for 3 decades, tireless source of inspiration for thousands of publicists throughout the world. Another K's picture - 'Eyes wide shut' - has allowed to come out the beautifull Shostakovitch' 'Jazz Suite n 2' together with other delightfull 3  scores of the same composer. I'd like very much if publicists unlike with Zarathustra, let in peace this music, to keep on loving and enjoying with its audition. It's clear that arent Shostakovitch's  master pieces in the same dimension that some of his symfonies or operas - marvellous Lady Macbeth of Mtsenk!- but, there's no doubt that this scores transpire pure music, to be relished in the same manner we do when we listen a Mozart's Serenata or Scubert's Impromptu ...Russian caviar with cold champagne under the moonlight. Concergtebow Orchestra conducted by Chailly play this music very convincingly, with the lightness and coolness requiered, and, at the same time, with the dose of sadness and melancholy that suggests in many ocations the music of this composer of genious. On the other hand, the Decca recording is one of its best. Soundstage is almost miraculous and the attention to the detail is unsurpassable, with a very natural micro and macro dynamics presentation of all the instruments, together with a sense of immediacy that's relly difficult to find out, even among the most reputable specialized audiophile recording brands.
B000056K04|4.0|I thoroughly enjoy the new Dave Matthew's Band &quot;Everyday&quot; album, even the electric guitar parts, but I still hold &quot;Under the Table&quot; as my favorite and the best. &quot;Everyday&quot; goes beyond what was in &quot;Before These Crowded Streets,&quot; yet at the same time, in its docile tones, was not as complex as &quot;Crash.&quot; &quot;The Space Between,&quot; is my favorite track, along with &quot;Angel.&quot;  It is still a wonderful album, but compared to previous releases, it does not seem as grand. However, for all fans, this is essential DMB. A very well-structured sound and an enjoyable listen.
0440219078|5.0|Although some might disagree with me, i find this book of the best ever. This book put me in tears. And no it is not some mushy book. I read this book 2 years but i can still remember the details and suspence it put me through. This book is about how people worked and acted in a diferent world. They had different feelings then we would about the same things. This book is a heart wencher that I would recomend to anyone. Because I loved this book and was touched deeply.
6305364613|5.0|There will be people out there that will criticize this version of Romeo + Juliet.  Sadly, these people think they are purists, but are totally mistaken.  As one that's been reading Shakespeare for years, and have taken classes specifically about the great Bard, as well as being an avid playgoer, this is simply put, one of the most exquisite versions of this tragedy on film.  Shakespeare's Romeo + Juliet was not made to be a sedate and quiet drama, it was written about a time and place that was quite racy by Elizabethan England's standards.  Verona was a place of blood, lust, and intrigue.  By updating the storyline so dramatically, Luhrmann tries to give the modern audience a taste of what made this play so remarkable in its time.  At first it might seem brash and too MTVish, and simple-minded viewers may be immediately turned off by it, but for those who love seeing Shakespeare come alive, they will be delighted.<br />In our modern times it's often hard to look back on a play like Romeo + Juliet and understand how a sword fight can turn a town upside down or how a feud between two families can get a whole community involved, but Luhrmann turns everything up a notch and makes it obvious why these events were so important to the story's progression.  Lurhmann is masterful at updating a classic story to the modern day while preserving the beauty of the original text, and revealing the raw emotion and fire in every scene.  The art direction, costuming and sets are excellent and created a fantasy world that the viewer can get swept up and lost in.  A great preformance by DiCaprio and the rest of the cast allow this movie to shine to it's fullest potential.  There are few people that watch this movie and have mixed views - you will either love it or hate it.  If you love it, you'll understand that this is the type of screenplay Shakespeare would have written had he lived in modern times.  If you hate it, you obviously just don't understand.
B00003CXSP|4.0|It is truly an amazing film. Forget the sequal... to me this one is much better than the first! This movie drives you through a master piece of suspense and thriller.<br />The make up was brillaint and thrilling for the &quot;deformed man&quot;! Anthony Hopkins played his role well but the big credit I give to Ridley Scott!<br />The two things that got me not to rate it 5 stars was:<br />1. The story did not cover how did Dr. Lecter manage to do everything (job, escape, travel ..etc.) without any assistance!<br />2. The scene at the dining table at the end of the film was a bit over exaggerated!<br />Other than that, it was a movie not to be missed!
B000056K04|4.0|Being from North Carolina, I have seen Dave quite a few times live and have been listening to his music since 1994. While I agree with the general consensus about this album being different than his previous works, I do not agree with the &quot;Fair Weather Fan&quot; syndrome that is plaguing these reviews. Get over it already, people! The fact that he has done something with music that breaks the norm should allow fans to accept any new work from DMB, with an open mind. True, a lot of the Violin/Sax components have been reduced, but you see a nice tradeoff with newer styles from this CD. I can't wait to see how Boyd/Leroy implement their sound in concert, with some of these songs.<br />As for the CD, many of the songs touch on many different styles/themes. From the Latin sound of &quot;Mother, Father,&quot; to the woeful, pre-apocalyptic words of &quot;When The World Ends,&quot; this is a CD that should be accepted by any DMB fan (or others who are picking up a DMB album for the first time). The grittier tunes of &quot;I Did It&quot; and &quot;What You Are&quot; feel of harsh love. &quot;What You Are&quot; feels a lot like &quot;The Last Stop&quot; from Before These Crowded Streets. Some of my favorites on the CD are &quot;Angel,&quot; &quot;Space Between,&quot; and &quot;Everyday,&quot; due to the effect they can have on a person during a life-altering experience (In this case, the birth of my daughter).<br />I respect opinions of others, but the fact that people are not going to see Dave live because of this album or not buy any other albums because of this one is just plain ludicrous! We're not here to judge the character because of the changes between past/present, but the quality of the music presented before us. And if we can't do that with an open mind or constructive criticism, then we're no better than those who &quot;judge a book by its cover.&quot;
B000002GDJ|5.0|The second released Police album, &quot;Regatta De Blanc&quot; (White Reggae?), could be considered their best effort because it showcases their superior musicianship and their strong song writing capabilities in combination better than any other Police album. I still consider 'Synchronicity' their best- ever simply because the songs are so catchy. This record is still magical, however. Every number performed is sweet music outside of an annoying piano ditty called &quot;Does Everyone Stare.&quot; &quot;Message in A Bottle&quot; is the best up tempo track the Police ever captured on tape, period. Other highlights include the familiar &quot;Walking on the Moon,&quot; a hilarious &quot;On Any Other Day,&quot; and a reggae gem called &quot;The Bed's Too Big Without You.&quot; 'Regatta De Blanc' is highly recommendable for those who are interested in picking up a Police record. This is one of the better albums I've ever heard.
B00005BJ2O|5.0|A triumph. This beautiful, evocative CD starts off with David Bowie in &quot;Nature Boy&quot; - An ambient, melancholy song that sets the mood for this sad, grand vision of Baz Luhrmann's. The Divas themselves bring us a rousing, tightly arranged version of that classic 70's disco bad-girl anthem, &quot;Lady Marmalade&quot;, and Christina, Pink, Mya, and Li'l Kim do it in style.  Fatboy Slim takes us to a football match/Can-Can with &quot;Because We Can&quot;, a thumping, throbbing interlude, and ...then we come to the cream on this wonderful cake:  Nicole and Ewan.  Whatever you have heard, disregard, and LISTEN to the music!! Nicole's heart-rending &quot;Someday I'll Fly Away&quot; will bring tears to the most jaded eyes, and the sweet poignancy with which she sings hits the PERFECT note. Ewan's &quot;Your Song&quot; is the piec'e de resistance- His pure, clear, beautiful voice will shock all, and the arrangements on this one are big, beautiful, and while the Opera Man was wonderful, he was not necessary, for Ewan needs no accompaniment to make him look good, and this song is the centerpiece of the CD.  He stands alone.  Dare I say, an improvement on the sublime Elton John version? True.  Nicole and Ewan's duet &quot;Come What May&quot; is another big one, destined, I think to be the next big wedding song, in the tradition of &quot;Endless Love&quot; - Huge song, wonderful arrangement/production.  Ewan &amp; Nicole's singing lessons paid off beautifully &amp; they should be very proud.  Ewan can easily segue into Big Broadway if he so chooses.  Nicole is wonderful as well.  The other songs, the samples, E &amp; N doing Beatles AND Paul &amp; Wings in ONE song is priceless !!!  All else excellent, but I have highlighted the standouts. THIS CD WILL GROW ON YOU EACH TIME YOU LISTEN TO IT, AND ALL SONGS GEL TOGETHER SEAMLESSLY - HATS OFF TO BAZ, BECK, BOWIE, BONO, ETC...AND ENCORE TO THE 2 STARS OF THE MOVIE! NOTE TO BAZ: IF YOU HAVE ANY MORE SONGS IN THE VAULT, A LA' GLADIATOR 2, RUSH OUT AND GET IT MOVING AT ONCE !!!!GLADIATOR 2, RUSH OUT AND GET IT MOVING AT ONCE !!!!
B00004YKSD|3.0|I know there are a lot of viewers that are The Doors fans who hated this movie because of inaccuracy issues, but this movie, regardless of truths or untruths turned people on to The Doors' music by intensifying a mystique already surrounding Jim Morrison. I'm sure the surviving members didn't complain about the movie when they received ballooned royalty checks from all the new sales of their material. It's all about entertainment and art (and money). Anyway, this DVD gets three stars not because the movie is average but because this special edition doesn't have an anamorphic screen. WHAT A CROCK!! Why did I even bother selling my old version to get this new version for a few unnecessary extra scenes. Thanks a lot ARTISAN.
0618135871|4.0|In the svelte-novella style of DeLillo's BODY ARTIST, Philip Roth offers a tawdry, melancholic, almost self-torturingly unsentimental portrait of a libertine slipping into old age; so unrelenting in its spiritual grime, he might have called it THE BODY RETAILER. David Kopesh, as near and as far from &quot;Philip Roth&quot; as those cockamamie names Woody Allen makes up for the single character he plays, is a cultural critic and man-about-town in his early sixties. He meets a prim, tailored Cuban woman named Consuela, most remarkable for his melon breasts. His addiction, in late-middle, early-old age to her lusciousness, and his brutally rendered relationships with others (particularly his castrated son and a middle-aged lover painted in compassionate but unsparing light), all point toward an elegiac conclusion. Instead, Roth gives us one of karmic violence, climaxing on an image that at first seems almost comically misogynistic, but which soon after takes on a fully earned, excruciating pathos.<br />Like a cross between Saul Bellow's RAVELSTEIN and Woody Allen's DECONSTRUCTING HARRY, THE DYING ANIMAL--the title is as apposite as it is awful--is the funeral wail of a Jewish lion in winter, a cultural kingpin for whom there are no fresh laurels and nothing left save lust and the long goodbye. All three of these guys are surprisingly unsparing when it comes to revealing their own chauvinisms, their personal failings, the petty cruelties that come with their now-entrenched high berths. Elsewhere, that nudity can have the scent of narcissism; here, it feels both genuinely clinical and genuinely impassioned and despairing.<br />Roth has become fixated, terrifiedly, on the cosmic boomerang of bad vibrations. It's not just a torturing conscience but the rigged roulette wheel of God the Father that brings the Rothian hero to his knees. The finale--a seemingly unconscious riff on the melodramatic wrapup of Nabokov's LOLITA--is as genuinely moving as the best parts of AMERICANPASTORAL; maybe more so. Like Robert Altman (and unlike Woody Allen), age seems to make Roth pick up steam, force, belief, will.
B000002GF8|5.0|The Police never released a bad album, and had some sparkling moments before 1983. But 'Synchronicity' was definitely their career milestone. Not only does this album have more good songs than any other they released, the singles are masterful. &quot;Every Breath You Take,&quot; &quot;Wrapped Around Your Finger,&quot; &quot;King of Pain,&quot; and &quot;Synchronicity&quot; are among the best pop songs I've ever heard. This album is more radio friendly than those previously released by the Police, especially more so than 1982's 'Ghosts in the Machine.'
B0000025LS|5.0|Having read all the reviews now, for all the &quot;80's era&quot; Santana albums, it is time to speak up, and Zebop! is the place to do it. This old reviewer has been collecting Santana band/solo records on vinyl and cd since he walked out on the stage at woodstock.  Glory halleluja! that the &quot;Fillmore&quot; stuff was finally released on a Cd recently.  But why all the bad press over his 80's decade material?  I'll tell you why, because it's not The Santana Band sound, nor is it the eclectic jazz of the Caravanserai/Borboletta/Mahivishnu period, nor even like his recent 90's experimentation.  I've been reading &quot;bad&quot; reviews of his albums, and they all boil down to one thing: it depends on the ear of the listener.  Carlos Santana himself does not record material for YOU.  He plays for his own inner voices and hopes it touches yours.  Carlos is and always has been an experiment in the elemental forces of sound.  &quot;Poppy&quot;?  You may think so, but I don't think that word ever entered his mind. Zebop! is one of the best showcases for everything that is and ever was &quot;Santana&quot;.  It is AS GOOD as Abraxas, if not better because it is more polished.  Would you purchase a diamond in the rough?  I don't think so.  Yes the first three Santana albums were a mark in music history.  Great is too weak a word for them. Then his forward momentum into the Jazz/Fusion 70's period even firmed up more what we all knew about Santana, the man and his fellow musicians.  Carlos has always surrounded himself with top-notch talent, including his vocalists who are used for the &quot;sound&quot; he wishes at any particular moment, and Alex on this one, Shango, Marathon, etc. was the sound he wanted.  If you pay close attention to Zebop!, you will note that it is much structured (on the &quot;second side&quot;) to be like Abraxas, beginning with the african percussive &quot;tales&quot; into a Black Magic Woman/Gypsy Queen repeat (note the title reference Gypsy Queen/American Gypsy) and even a Samba Pa Ti take off (yes it's a Cale cover but beautiful), and ending with some hard hitting blues and instrumental.  Side One irks some people, because of what? A &quot;top-40&quot; tune?  a &quot;Pop&quot; sound?  I find the entire journey through Zebop! to be one of natural progression, and exploration with the master himself into every musical venue he ever performed.  Listen to words of the opening number, Cat Stevens' immortal Changes IV, which Carlos chose on purpose.  It says everything you want to know about the album, and what the musician is trying to say.  Zebop! is possibly Santanas best ever effort.  It is a milestone in his career, and only for his true fans.  It brings together all the early Santana rock, the latin percussive nature of his beast, and the blues/jazz rythme of his soul, and the angelic message he wants you to hear.  This CD is a diamond, polished and sparkling, and flawless.  If you've been reading bad reviews of Santanas 80's period, and are frightened to try this one, or Shango, or even Marathon, don't listen to them!  Listen to your heart.  If you like Santana at all, buy this one!
B00004YKSD|3.0|I know there are a lot of viewers that are The Doors fans who hated this movie because of inaccuracy issues, but this movie, regardless of truths or untruths, turned people on to The Doors' music by intensifying a mystique already surrounding Jim Morrison. I'm sure the surviving members didn't complain about the movie when they received ballooned royalty checks from all the new sales of their material. It's all about entertainment and art (and money). Anyway, this DVD gets three stars not because the movie is average but because this special edition doesn't have an anamorphic screen. WHAT A CROCK!! Why did I even bother selling my old version to get this new version for a few unnecessary extra scenes. Thanks a lot ARTISAN.
B00005AXEL|5.0|I have been a Stevie fan since the age of 5, when Bella Donna came out and I twirled around the living room to Edge of Seventeen.  For the past 7 years I have waited, somewhat impatiently, for her new album.  And boy was it worth the wait.  There is not a bad song on this CD.  And while many are focusing on the multiude of guests on the songs, I think that it just goes to show what an influence she has had over the female artists of today.  There would be no Sheryl Crow or Sarah McLachlan if Stevie had not paved the way by writing intensely personal songs and singing them with passion. All of the songs on this CD showcase great songwriting, musicianship, and production.  Hopefully the success of this CD will help sound the death bell for all the overproduced teeny-bopper acts out there.  Britney Spears could learn a thing or two from Stevie--most notably, how to be a strong, talented performer.  Buy this CD, and get ready to be enchanted once again by the fabulous Ms. Nicks.

B000002LK1|5.0|Definitivamente es uno de los mejores albumes producidos en la temprana decada de los noventas, un album contrastante ante el boom del technobeat y el house comercial de esa misma epoca, y a su vez con el remanente del glam de grupos como Poison o Bon Jovi, un album que a la fecha suena fresco y potente, que encierra dulzura y obscuridad, que tiene todo para estar entre los mejores de todos los tiempos.<br />Es el mejor album de DM sin duda, y no por que demerite el trabajo de este ahora trio, sino que es el album mas caracteristico de un movimiento que se creia facil de extinguir y que no ha muerto gracias a este album y su influencia. Enjoy the silence, Personal Jesus, Policy of Truth, seguiran sonando como el dia que se estrenaron, himnos de una juventud en busca de alternativas musicales que despues se verian saciadas con el grunge y el manchester, pero que encontraron en Depeche Mode-Violator su primer acercamiento a la &quot;otra&quot; musica.
B000002JSN|5.0|This 1975 double album was the best, and most diverse, piece recorded by the band, and it was recorded at the height of their powers, just prior to many technical changes that would transform the industry and the band.<br />While many would opine that their previous effort (Led Zeppelin #4) was their best, I simply disagree.<br />The wide breadth of styles (metal, synth, blues) shown on this album makes it a sonic tour de force.<br />Standouts include &quot;Sick Again&quot;, &quot;Ten Years Gone&quot;, and &quot;Kashmir&quot;.<br />The band was never to sound this good again and the succeeding albums each were substantially weaker than this, which was by far, their best. Music like this simply is not made any more!
B000002IGP|5.0|Now album will rock the roll right off of you! Warren DiMartini is without a doubt the most under-rated guitarist on the planet (rigth along with George Lynch). Anyway, 'Round-n-Round' was a major hit for Ratt and is their staple song like KISS's 'Rock n Roll all Nite'. The solo sounds just as fresh as it did 15 years ago. Sent chills up my back and I wouldn't rest until I learned it note for note.<br />This is basically a party album and you can't go wrong cruisin' to it either. Any complaint I have is 'Lack of Communication'. Their social commentary just doesn't fit well on an album dedicated to girls and rockin' good times. Never cared too much for that tune really. The guitar riff kicks, but the lyrics and chorus just fall flat. Aside from that, this debut, like 'Appetite for Destruction' will live forever to the rock n rollers who either have just discovered Ratt or who were there in the beginning.
B0000019PA|5.0|WOW! This is one of the most touching records I have heard in a very long time. The production of the record is so unconventional and strikingly beautiful. While at times there is a lot going on, each song is bathed in pure pop genius which is well complemented by a strong foundation, with sometimes humorous, often ironic, and always very moving lyrics. If you are tired of the sameness of conventional pop records, fret not; the overall sound of this record and of the songs themselves make this album stand out in a way few others can.
B000023X9W|5.0|After a lackluster decade in the 80's, Neil Young experienced a renaissance in the 90's.  He released some of the best albums of his career and showed that he was every bit a relevant as he was in the 70's.  His first album of a new decade and century is another brilliant piece of music.  Spurred on by a reunion with CSN, Silver &amp; Gold is a beautiful collection of songs that contains some sharp and vivid lyrics.  Songs like &quot;The Great Divide&quot;, &quot;Horseshoe Man&quot;, &quot;Red Sun&quot; and &quot;razor Love&quot; are all magnificent tracks.  The best track on the album is the great &quot;Buffalo Springfield Revisited&quot; in which dreams what life would have been like if he had stayed with the seminal country-rock band instead of breaking away to follow his own muse.  Closer to 60 than 40, Neil Young shows no signs of fading away.
0451191153|2.0|I gave Ayn 2 stars just for the amazing amount of words devoted to this tripe.  After being bashed on the head for (it seems like) a bazillion pages of objectivist ideology, I must say &quot;OK  Alice (her real name), I get your point&quot;, but after I read a couple of pages more... I'm bashed about the head again with the same ideals... then again... and again... and again.  The story is boring, the prose is uninteresting, the story insulting (especially to women), and the philosophy is wanting.  I rather thought it was like treking through mud with rubber boots.  Does anyone over the age of 18 find this interesting?  Don't try and tell me that this is good writing.  And as someone who loves books... her inability to write is her greatest flaw.
6302794331|5.0|I have been a lifelong lover of the muppets.  I grew up watching Sesame Street and the muppet babies then as I grew older I watched all of the original muppet movies.  This movie is the greatest of them all.  Brian Henson does a great job of directing this loveable movie.  I think this is the way Dickens would want the movie to be portrayed.  Well, at least I do. :)
B0000004F9|5.0|Soft Machine had a very good album - the first - and a devine one - the second. The first album reminds me a lot Syd Barret's Pink Floyd. I'm not sure, but i think that Kevin Ayers shared it with the rest of the band, but still, Robert Wyatt is the dominant member. I have a vynil copy of the album with the great song &quot;Memories&quot;, that was the best of it. By the list of Amazon.com, the song was &quot;dissapeared&quot; from the disc. Am i right, or just missed it? Anyway, in my opinion, it's one of the greatest of the  British &quot;underground&quot; music of the late 60's, and i give it 5 stars. The second album took the band (or actually, the band took us) for a long musical journey, that no one else reached before or after. &quot;There's a music for the feet and there's a music for the head. This is a music for the head&quot;, was writen on the back of the cover, of the old vynil record, so i guess they knew, that this one won't be in &quot;Tops of the pop&quot;... :) I declare without hesitation: 6 stars! The perfect unit ever made by rock musicians! Sadly, since the third album the band turned to irrelevant directions and i lost my interest in &quot;Soft Machine&quot;. Few of Wyatt solos continue the greatness of the 2nd album, but the original is the best.
B000002MZ9|5.0|Neil Young &amp; Pearl Jam are kindred spirits and they joined forces for a superb tour in 1994.  After the tour, they got together and recorded an album, Mirror Ball.  Pearl Jam fills the role of Crazy Horse on the record and Mr. Young is inspired by their youthful vigor.  The songs have sharp, punchy sound and are crisp and full of verve.  Songs like &quot;Act Of Love&quot;, &quot;Downtown&quot;, &quot;Peace &amp; Love&quot;, &quot;I'm The Ocean&quot; and &quot;Song X&quot; are all quality tracks.  The band are clearly inspired by playing with one of their heroes and they are as tight as they've ever been.  The only minor complaint is that Eddie Vedder appears sporadically throughout the album and it would have been nice to hear him sing on ever song and a few more duets with Mr. Young.  The album became one of the biggest hits of Mr. Young's career, peaking at number five.
B00004T8RK|2.0|Who the hell am I except someone who spends good hard earned money on CD's.  Most times I can live with it but this one really took the cake.  If you are a Pearl Jam fan (And I am one) you cannot help but be disappointed by this recording.  There is nothing on it that even reminds us why this band was so good to begin with.  Those who say that this is an evolution of Pearl Jam and it is a good thing should listen to Jim Morrison and try to see if it reminds them of anything he was recording when he was on drugs.  (No disrespect to Mr. Morrison; I'm a fan of the Door's also).  People should save their money on this one and look foreward to their next release, I'm sure it has to be better.  Sorry guys but on this one you stink.

B00005AXEL|5.0|This is honestly one of Stevie Nicks' best albums ever. The sonwriting is wonderful and is classic Nicks. There are many guests on this record, but they don't obscure Stevie. She is still the dominant voice on this CD. This is an absolute must have for any Stevie Nicks fan!
B00005221M|4.0|I've seen the original - and fell in love instantly. Wonderful actors, a beautiful scenery, no lengths and heart-gripping drama and action. Thats how it was - and I'd watch it one over and over again. I then got this DVD and frankly it just isnt the same. Some scenes were added to give it a more historical touch and there's a lot more of walking in the woods - that's it. Oh and they changed the absolutely grand soundtrack - it still contains most of the themes but it lost a lot of it's splendor.<br />My verdict: as long as there's no release of the original version on DVD:  GO GET IT - it's still one of a kind. A two hour trip into a fascinating story - a classic.
0451191153|3.0|a tale enacting the loss of independence/spirit in our culture. where just any job will complete the task so long as it's what's always been done. not as widely applicable as atlas shrugged was as it has a lot to do with promoting man and his dominion of the earth. if we all worked exactly as HR did than there would be even less of a viable planet than there is today. but there is a lot to take and apply to certain parts of life. worth the read.
6305313687|5.0|I just recently saw the movie and i thought it was absolutely great.I personally think the movie has some mild seens of violence but nothing really bad.The movie is really well laid out and has a clever way of showing when an event is in the past,they make that certain scenes black and white.I really think Edward Norton plays his part really well. The movie also has funny lines,and theres vocabulary that youll wanna say outloud right after. The movies title says it all,American History X.The movie shows you the bad side of america and the bad side of people.I think that if there is anyone under age to see this movie theyre parents should think twic eand let them see it,its almost like a documentry in a way.well this movie was one of my favorites,i hope you see it and you like it.
B000002MTU|5.0|This is one of my all-time favorite blues albums. There's a real great live vibe to the recording (they actually did record it live in the studio). Kind of like a Chess album, but with better equipment. Clapton's playing is full of passion. And as far as I'm concerned so is his singing. The growling he does on songs like Blues before Sunrise may sound a little contrived at first, but listen to it a few times and you will enjoy it. It's kinda like a greatest hits of the Blues album, with improved sound quality. But it's still Clapton you hear, not some imitation of Muddy Waters or Freddie King. A great tribute.

0060977493|4.0|Arundhati Roy would have described The God of Small Things when she wrote: \\"The secret of the Great Stories is that they have no secrets.  The Great Stories are the ones you have heard and want to hear again.  The ones you can enter anywhere and inhabit comfortably.  They don't deceive you with thrills and trick endings.  They don't surprise you with the unforeseen....In the Great Stories you know who lives, who dies, who finds love, who doesn't.  And yet you want to know again\\",  If she had exchanged the word \\"Great\\" for \\"entertaining yet imperfect\\" and the phrases \\"want to hear again\\" and \\"want to know again\\" for \\"aren't really interested\\".  Admittedly it was a very good book in some places, but one can tell that this is Roy's first book.  Several scenes seem to be thrown in just for kicks and shock value and they lend no obvious support to the rest of the plot.  These are some of the niggling little details that detract from the overall quality and charm of the novel.  The overall effect is that the reader finds themselves trying to make their way through the book like an explorer trying to make their way through the Amazon-with a machete.    Despite the descriptive writing and lush imagery,  there seems to be a formula to the book.  Evocative literature aside, the tragedy and affair that follows is rather predictable(and she doesn't tell you her definition of a good book until you are far beyond the halfway point.).    This story is made up of densely woven together(I find that I keep making my way back to the forest imagery)plots and subplots intertwined with masses of elaborate descriptions and phrases.  The flashbacks and flash-forwards and twists that make up the novel are refreshing in the beginning but soon bring this reviewer back to those sad, unfortunate days spent sitting in English class discussing Sound and the Fury, a book I soon learned to loathe for the style it was written in, stream of consciousness.  While Arundhati Roy does make use of streamof consciousness, she does not wield her style like a meat cleaver.  Her book attempts to make amends by the use of vivid and beautiful imagery.  The God of Small Things is more about the language being used to tell the story as opposed to a real direction or one of things we like to call plots.  Roy admits that the book was a \\"work of instinct\\" and mentions that the book was written \\"sentence by sentence\\" and this is quite evident.  Many smaller sub-stories are meshed together, united by storytelling.  The foundation that the novel rests upon is the voice.    The story is told in a non-linear fashion, moving back in forth through time, touching upon events that have happened or will happen.  There are no surprises with regard to actual events just how they unfold. The odd turn of phrase that is readily apparent in the joined words and sentences, the overabundance of capitals, and silly rhymes makes sense when it becomes clear that the tale is narrated using the eyes and voice of seven-year-old Rahel.  The plot centers on the fraternal twins Esthappen(Estha) and Rahel and their forced transformation from two children with \\"joint identities  into two separate people.  Roy writes that they \\"thought of themselves together as Me, and separately, individually as We or Us\\".  The Estha's and Rahel's unusual bond is threaded throughout the storyline, and shapes the decisions that they make, how other characters react to them, and how they interact with other people outside the unit that are.   Roy's characters are quite enjoyable and interesting because one is able to see their own relatives in the unconventional characters.  Everyone has that weirdly intelligent relative, or a quirky or a cantankerous relation. Arundhati Roy declares that the family broke \\"all the rules. They crossed into forbidden territory. They tampered with the laws that lay down who should be loved and how. And how much.&quot;  A brief sketch of a few of the main/important characters as follows:     There is Blind Mammachi, the twins' grandmother and founder of Paradise Pickles and Preserves. Blind Mammachi is a virtuous violin-playing widow who suffered years of unwarranted abuse at the hands of her highly-respected yet overbearing, insecure husband. There is Estha and Rahel's grandaunt, Baby Kochamma, who totters on air cushions for feet while playing out the bitterness of her lifetime of unrequited love for an Irish Roman Catholic priest. Baby Kochamma spends her days savoring soap operas and satellite television wrestling matches, while living her life backwards.  Velutha, the title character, an ebulliently talented handyman, tainted by his Paravan lineage.   Chacko, Estha and Rahel's uncle, now divorced from his English wife, runs Paradise Pickles and Preserves with the iron hand of what he likes to think is communism, and flirts and sleeps with his female employees.   The twins' mother, Ammu, is a divorcee who fled her tyrannical husband's alcoholism which didn't endear her to her family or community since it was her fault that her marriage fell apart, of course.  A feminist before feminism, Ammu cannot decide on a last name, because as she says, &quot;choosing between her husband's name and her father's name didn't give a woman much of a choice&quot; at all.    If you're looking for a book that follows and highlights the events in India during the `60s, go get yourself a history book.  This book is more about social class in India and the relationships between members of a family, and members of different sexes and what happens to those unfortunates who have the temerity to deviate from the established order of life.  All in all, flaws aside, The God of Small Things is a very good read.  The book is by no means a masterpiece, but it should be enjoyed for it's beautiful prose.

B00003CXR1|2.0|On a sensual level, Chocolat is a sumptuous feast offering excellent acting, gorgeous cinematography, and a delightful parade of 1950's costume design.  Unfortunately, the story line is dominated by all too familiar deconstructionist tract:  Good is bad, bad is good. ....  The village priest is an affable chap, but is essentially a fool. The town mayor is a bigot.  The heroes are the generous and attractive unwed mother, the long-suffering battered wife, the charming, free-spirited river boat vagrant (i.e., social parasite), and the old curmudgeon with a heart of gold.  Anyone who isn't dysfunctional in some way is relegated to the background as a mereprop. ....  The trivialization of morals in this morality tale derides serious thought and reduces conscience, moral accountability, and prioritization of values to a drivel of clichs.  In railing against a town full of narrow-minded and phony characters, this story becomes its own worst enemy - - rigid and disingenuous. Chocolat is especially disappointing because it had the potential to be great, but degenerated into a sort of sitcom with a big budget.  But then, if what you are really after is an overdose of confection, then this mind candy is likely to please.  If nothing else, it is a great tale about chocolate.
068484267X|4.0|This memoire of a poverty striken and chaotic childhood in Ireland is brutally honest and sad.  WHile I believe that it has been over-praised a bit, it has a distinctive writing style that is very enjoyable.  There are many details that stick in the mind:  his discovery that his mother begged in secret, the smell of the sewer next to their aprtment, their dog eating the only bit of meat in the house before they could grab it.  Well worth the read.
0783230710|5.0|&quot;Apollo 13&quot; is told in a textbook fashion that makes it all the more believable, chronicling the harrowing saga of three men trapped in space on their way to the moon, and the courage and heroism of the people back on Earth who struggle to bring them home. Everything from the storytelling and directing, to the special effects and score, make this movie an epic that rises to heights of fame because the story it tells is a true one, done equal justice by the filmmakers. I stood up and cheered for this movie, which is one of the most accurate historical accounts I've ever seen. <br />We're first introduced to each of the astronauts who will take the fateful trip: Jim Lovell, the project leader, and his partners Ken Mattingly and Fred Haise. Originally scheduled to take a later space flight, the crew of the Apollo 13 mission is unable to take on the task, which bumps our three astronauts to the mission. No one thinks too much of the mission, it being just another in a long line of space explorations, while Jim's wife, Marilyn, has her own superstitions about the number &quot;13.&quot; Another glitch hits once Mattingly is grounded with a supposed case of the measles, forcing Jim to place Jack Swagert into the pilot's seat. <br />Nonetheless, the launch goes off without a glitch, but things go from hopeful to disastrous once a powerful explosion cripples the spacecraft and leaves the astronauts stranded in space, without any apparent hope of return. But the astronauts and the ground crew refuse to believe that this is the end, and their efforts become a thrilling race against time as they devise a plan to bring them home, while their families pray for their safe return and the world watches in sheer wonderment at the events at hand. <br />The movie rides to success on many things, but the most important of the elements is the impeccable acting from a terrific cast. Jim Lovell is played by Tom Hanks, who is optimistic and a leader once the going gets tough. Together with Bill Paxton as Fred Haise and Kevin Bacon as Jack Swagert, their scenes together are some of the best of the film, as they refuse to play their characters as one sole person. They must be strong and defiant of the possibility of death, while at the same time realize the danger of the situation they're in, and the three bring out these emotions wonderfully. <br />Supporting actors also add to the movie, the best of these being Ed Harris in his performance as Gene Kranz, the flight director stationed in Houston, Texas. His sternness and unrelenting attitude towards his crew and the new mission objectives prove to be effective, inspiring a sense of heroism in his character. Kathleen Quinlan portrays Marilyn Lovell, playing her as a woman who refuses to break down or entertain the notion that they astronauts will die. She comes off as strong and forceful, which is most evident in her refusal to allow a news crew into her house. Gary Sinise is Ken Mattingly, who proves he is intelligent and noteworthy as an actor by providing his minimum onscreen time with a performance that plays a big role in the story advancement. <br />While the acting is intrical, the setting for the majority of the movie is also very important, and the special effects do a tremendous job in bringing space to life. The technical effects for the spaceship are meticulous, while space itself is seen as a vast black expanse that requires no gooey aliens or monsters to be truly frightening. These effects are seamless, creating an ominous atmosphere that surrounds the characters as well as the audience with an overbearing sense of lifelessness and possible death. <br />The musical score also adds greatly to the overall effect the story has on us as an audience. Composer James Horner employs the vocals of Annie Lennox to bring a mournful and melancholy tone to slower scenes, while a vocal ensemble, strings and percussion combine to add intensity to faster sequences; most noteworthy is his piece for the spacecraft's re-entry into the earth's atmosphere. The music has a patriotic feel to it that keeps in sync with the movie's historical feel. <br />Director Ron Howard treats the story with a passion for accuracy, taking us on a journey into history to look at one of the most well-known events in our history. There is immense attention paid to the sequence of events as well as the obstacles that stand in their way. There is a nice flow to the story that never stops moving nor bends from its storytelling standards, which keeps the movie entertaining and enjoyable while never becoming boring or tiresome. <br />&quot;Apollo 13&quot; is definitely a modern epic which stands out as an impressive achievement in filmmaking. The story is a true one made believable by the efforts of the director and the cast, and made excellent by the seamless special effects and the musical score. For me, it's a feel-good adrenaline-pumping movie which tells a brilliant story of heroes and a race against time.

6303142346|5.0|Disney's animated version of the classic tale, &quot;Beauty and the Beast,&quot; is every bit as enchanting as the &quot;tale as old as time&quot; that it tells, making its way into our hearts as well as motion picture history. Being the first film nominated for an Academy Award for Best Picture, as well as six nominations altogether, Disney proves that it has what it takes to make an animated feature enjoyable for adults and children. I remember watching the film as a small child, and now, as an adult, is hasn't lost its luster, and everything is just as I enjoyed it before. <br />Through brilliant animation and song, as well as some terrific voice talents, the story of unexpected love comes to new and exciting life. Small-town girl Belle is forced to head into the woods once her father turns up missing, bringing her to a gloomy, secluded castle where she finds him and his captor, a vicious-looking beast. Of course, the beginning of the movie explains the beast's origins: he was once a selfish prince who, after turning out an old beggar woman, was transformed, given an enchanted rose, and told &quot;if he could learn to love another, and earn their love in return by the time the last petal fell, then the spell would be broken. If not, he would be doomed to remain a beast for all time.&quot; <br />This begins their rocky-turned-romantic relationship, as they begin to warm to one another. Meanwhile, the town brute, Gaston, has plans of his own, involving some sinister maneuvers involving Belle's father in hopes that she will agree to marry him. <br />Many have hailed this as the best of Disney's films, and they wouldn't be wrong in saying so, either. It's easy to see why the movie has become such a success: there are elements at work in this film, just as in every other Disney film, only they seem to have taken on a small degree of maturity with this film's creation. <br />The animation is some of the best and most believable I've seen for an animated film in a longtime. Most of the scenes involving solely characters is the same as most of Disney's works, but there are scenes of pure life-like reality that have a special flare to them. The ballroom scene is one such scene: the camera angles sweep across a room filled with high-arched glass windows and a chandelier which looks as real as the words you're reading on this page. Some nice effects go into the creation of the castle as well, especially in the end once everything returns to normal. <br />The is one of the most moving Disney soundtracks to come along since that of &quot;Cinderella&quot; and &quot;Pinocchio.&quot; It is clear that composers were striving to capture the feeling and influence of their previous score for &quot;The Little Mermaid,&quot; and they truly succeed in doing so. The songs are delightful and will have kids and adults alike smiling and singing along. The score is the perfect underlining for scenes of romance as well as tension and suspense. In case you were wondering, three of the originally written songs were nominated for Academy Awards; that should say something. <br />This is one of Disney's most ambitious and successful projects, ranking alongside such cinematic achievements as the successes of &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; and &quot;Gone With The Wind.&quot; Winner of the Golden Globe Award for Best Picture, as well as its Oscar nominations, &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; is a hallmark of a time when movies were something that everyone, young and old alike, could enjoy on the same levels. This is the best picture of 1991.
B00003CX5A|1.0|Gothic ? A return to roots for horror ? Um yeah, sure. The classic Legend Of Sleepy Hollow has been butchered. Se7en Scribe Andrew Walker, I assumed would bring at all the thematic depth and darkness of the original story, instead he's opted for the Scream pop-horror root. Instead of using the headless horseman as a metaphor for the vengeance of a superficial society against outsider Ichabod Crane as in the novel, the horseman here (in true hollywood fashion) is being controlled by some stupid witch. It's like instead of a killer in a mask, we get a medieval witch. The classic story of Sleepy Hollow has been turned into a medieval slasher film ! In true hollywood fashion, everything is made nice and simple for the audience. Lots of jump in your seat moments, lots of blood, and a nice happy ending. Everything is explained to you and there is no thematic depth here at all. <br />Gothic does not mean everything is dark. Gothic goes deeper than that, I really thought Tim Burton understood that. But this is pop-horror. Cheesy jump in your seat moments of horror. Nothing disturbing or even remotely depressing like the original book - this ain't The Exorcist folks. Texas Chainsaw massacre ? Don't get me started. Using blood is cool, if it's going to disturb the audience ala Last House On The Left, but this is just cheesy mainstream trsh. OKay, the cast are great, but I feel sorry for such wasted talent. This could have really brought back gothic horror, instead it tries to make gothic horror appeal to the masses. BRING BACK LOW BUDGET DAMN IT ! A triumph for visual style it may be, but a triumph for horror this ain't. Tim Burton barely says a word in his commentary track, which shows how much he thinks of his film.
6302787068|4.0|Disney's &quot;Aladdin&quot; isn't as spectacular as some of it's other films like &quot;Beauty and the Beast,&quot; but it's proves itself to be worthy entertainment for adults and children alike. The dazzling animation and animal characters will provide hours of mockery and cheers from children, while the superb comical talent and witticism of Robin Williams will be a sheer delight to both sets. The movie tickles my fancy in new ways; I loved it. <br />The story centers around a &quot;street urchin&quot; named Aladdin, who'd give anything to live within the walls of the Sultan's palace. One day in the marketplace, he meets a girl who turns out to be the princess, but he is soon arrested at the hands of Jafar, the Sultan's advisor who has a thirst for the throne. Jafar takes Aladdin far into the desert, to a place known as the Cave of Wonders, where he ventures inside to find a magic lamp containing a giant blue genie with a flare for comedy. Aladdin uses the lamp to make himself a prince, in hopes that he may win the heart of Princess Jasmine and finally live in the palace. But Jafar has different plans. Spurned by the princess and annoyed by the Sultan, he makes it his life's goal to retrieve the lamp and become master of the universe. <br />While this movie doesn't have the grandeur and magnificence of Disney's spectacle pieces, it's clear that it doesn't need that look or feel to make it work. This movie is basically a Disney comedy, possessing a simple story for children while the dialogue will appeal more to adults as well. It's not a very serious film, which makes it even easier to enjoy the comedic lightheartedness it brings with it. <br />That comedy rests on the shoulders of Robin Williams, who provides the voice of the Genie. Some of his best work is done in this film, and he brings some of the funniest one-liners and gags ever to a movie that works well with them. And since his character is one of animation and not reality, then the possibilities are endless. You'll laugh until you cry watching Williams in action, as he switches many different forms, voices and attitudes. <br />Everything else for a typical Disney movie is right in place: there's the setting, the Arabian town of Agraba, overlooked by a palace complete with dome-topped towers and sparkling white walls, all with a certain Disney touch. There's the main protagonist, Aladdin, who hopes for a better life and then gets one. There's Princess Jasmine, the maiden whom everyone wishes for their own. And there's the villain, Jafar, complete with talking parrot Iago, who provides comic relief in the midst of his master's evil doings. <br />I wasn't expecting much from &quot;Aladdin,&quot; which is why I liked it so much. Perhaps people expected a bit too much out of it, being a follow-up to &quot;Beauty and the Beast,&quot; but in order to enjoy it, you just have to sit back and relax and let it roll over you. The comedy is the best thing about it, and Robin Williams succeeds beautifully at bringing a warm and funny nature to the picture. &quot;Aladdin&quot; is laugh-out-loud funny! I loved this movie!
B000059Z8J|5.0|SUPERMAN THE MOVIE falls into the &quot;they-don't-make-movies-like-that-anymore&quot; category.  It is a hybrid of 60's &quot;epic&quot; movies, 70's all-star-cast disaster flicks, and the late-70's special effects films (like STAR WARS and CLOSE ENCOUNTERS).<br />The DVD looks and sounds wonderful.  The extra's are very interesting - 3 documentaries illuminate the journey from page to screen.  The battles between director Richard Donner and his producers are fascinating.  However, in all fairness, one wishes the Salkinds (or someone on their side) could respond.  <br />There are some very cool early flying effects in the bonus stuff.  The screen tests are hilarious - Stockard Channing as Lois Lane would have been a hoot.  Lesley Anne Warren was an interesting choice as well.  However, when Margot Kidder's screen test appears it is obvious why she was chosen.  In her screen test she had a bad haircut and a 70's hippy dress on.  However, she simply glows with energy and the magic required to help the audience believe a man can fly.  <br />The film has held up well.  It moves from Greek-like Krypton to the Americana of Smallville to the zippy, campy feel of Metropolis.  Gene Hackman is hilarious as Lex Luthor.<br />The re-inserted scenes are fine.  They are really minor additions to this great film.  They only help make it better.  (I'd really like to hear/see more of the SUPERMAN II cut scenes!)<br />SUPERMAN is a super DVD!
B00003CXMG|4.0|I saw this film and thought it was very entertaining.  Cameron Crowe definitely captures the spirit of the time this film takes place in because he lived through that era.  Frankly, I have to laugh at those reviewers(probably people under 30) who found that this film wasn't &quot;exciting&quot; or &quot;funny.&quot;  They can go watch &quot;The Mummy Part 2&quot; or &quot;Joe Dirt&quot; and I'm sure they'll enjoy themselves since a lot of these people have short attention spans.  Most of today's films contain too much eye candy or roller coaster-like moments.  And as for comedy movies today, a lot of people won't find a film funny unless there is a lot of gross-out humor (or one of the &quot;stars&quot; of the film is a former or current member of &quot;Saturday Night Live.&quot; )<br />This is what makes &quot;Almost Famous&quot; stand out from the crappy movies being made these days.  The humor is subtle at times(&quot;It takes 18 minutes for the machine to copy one page...&quot;) and the actors have a lot of nice dramatic moments.  <br />I liked the performance of Kate Hudson, but I thought the actor who played the lead character was outstanding.  Jason Lee, from Chasing Amy and Mallrats, also gives a good performance as one of the bad members of Stillwater.<br />If you like movies that don't try to gross you out in order to be funny, or films that don't need to have guns a blazin' to be dramatic, then check out this film.
0800128052|2.0|No offense to everyone here who gave this movie 5 stars (which was indeed everyone!) but I just didn't like this film. Why you ask? Well it was superficial, obvious, and predictable. I never understood why Rudy was so determined to play at Notre Dame, didn't admire Sean Astin in the lead, am not at all into football. Not to mention I was totally bored by the ultra-deliberate pacing of it. As for originality, well, I think I can stop here.
0385474547|4.0|The writer of the review mentioned in the title must not have realized that one of the main points of &quot;Things Fall Apart&quot; was to get the message across to all those hollier-than-thou Missionaries out there that they RUIN people's lives.  Yes, that was in there...it's surprising you didn't find it after digging that deep.  However, it's certainly understandable since you weren't interested in the book.  When that's the case, most people just give up(including myself) and don't try for the ultimate meaning.  Well, that's all I wanted to say about this book except that I felt it was long in coming as far as getting the afore-stated message across.
B00005AXEL|5.0|Since the day I bought it, I have and refuse to take it out of my CD player. It's that good. Great sounds, great lyrics. Even my neighbor overheard it one sunny day and bought it as well.<br />Rock on, Ms. Nicks!
B00003CXMG|4.0|First off, I am not a fan of Cameron Crowe.  I find Jerry Maguire and Singles to each be overrated (like many movies reviewed here, actually).  I didn't want to like this movie, but it's so very likeable.  Yeah, there are plenty of corny moments, but there are more moments of honesty than camp.  Kate Hudson was nominated for Best Supporting Actress for her role as Penny Lane.  Her performance is endearing, a little provocative, but ultimately vapid.  The real star here is Patrick Fugit.  If for no other reason, see this movie to see his performance.  You have to root for him 'cause he's so damn pure and true to himself despite all the people trying to sway him to their way of thinking.  Someone who has probably received little notice but very much should, is Michael Angarano, the young(er) actor who plays the young(er) William for a few minutes in the film.  His screen time is brief, but he uses it very well.
0684833395|5.0|Catch-22 is most definately the best book I have ever read.  Heller brilliantly portrays the hellish experiences of war with hilarity and horror.  Catch-22 is full of ironic contradictions and farcical ancedotes.    However, Heller in no way evades or desensitizes the atrocities of war.  Fortunately, just when Heller begins to use excessive military jargon, he digresses to a comedic story about one of the men.  The keeps the average civilian enraptured.    Heller's masterpiece is a book for the satirically minded.   Catch-22 should be read by all.
B00004Z459|5.0|First, most people hating this are the one that probably listened to just a song or two. Thought the album contains a nice blend of music! I don't know why people compare this band to others, they're so different, It's not limp bizkit, these aren't &quot;empty tunes&quot; and you get the feeling the singers actually sing and not talk to you. Some don't like the DJs work, just listen to &quot;A place for my head&quot;, It can't be better than this, prefectly fits. Best ones : By myself, in the end, one step closer, paper cut.  All the others rock too. Defenitly one of the few album I found without a track I dont like.

6305075492|5.0|I've never been a huge fan of the silent film era.  In fact I never watched silent films until a class a took.  This was one of the 12 or so silent films we saw in the class and 1 of only 2 that I really liked. <br />The set design really sets the mood for the film.  The scenery and acting were great.  Conrad Veidt as Cesare was great as well as Werner Krauss as Dr. Caligari.  I like the end of the film as well.  The actual ending was not going to be that way it is.  It's better this way.  If you're not a fan of the silent era, start with this film.  It's a good one.

It is a stunning movie filled with romance and comedy. If you are a firm believer that there is someone for everyone, I would recommend you watch this movie. It is an emotional movie that moves me to tell others that this is one of the best adaptations of Jane Austen's books.

B000002BPS|5.0|I love this CD.  It is easily the best CD that I have ever heard.  In this Cd they have a variety of types of songs, such as songs with feelings (Gone Away), songs saying what they think of everything (Cool to Hate, Me And My Old Lady) and just songs that are jokes (Intermission).  I am a Christian, and I am saved from all my wrongs, which feels great, so I am into hardcore  christian groups such as Project 86.  Offspring however is by far my favorite secular band.  Buy them.

Bella Donna and Wild Heart are still my faves. TSIL didn't enchant me because Stevie's vocals sound dry and monotone. <br />There are guest vocalists but they're mainly used as harmony vocalists. It would have been nice to hear a solo verse or two from them (ie &quot;Leather and Lace&quot; and &quot;Stop Dragging My Heart Around&quot;).<br />I'd rate the CD 2 stars but since I like the artwork, I rated it 3 stars.

0767849493|3.0|I rented this mainly to see what all the Catholic backlash was about, fully expecting to be majorly offended.  But, surprisingly, I rather liked it  -- although I really don't understand why Hollywood always assumes that angels constantly spout bad language.  Still, I was surprised by the level of theological/philosophical discourse between Matt Damon and Ben Affleck (the fact that it was those two made the exchanges even funnier since it seemed so incongruous).  <br />The weakest part, IMO, was the ending.  Alanis Morrisette played God as a sort of semi-retarded child, and things just got a tad silly.  But all in all, if you have any taste for the metaphysical, it is an interesting diversion (and not nearly so anti-Christian as I was led to believe).
6303433766|5.0|I will always wonder what I would have thought of HEAVENLY CREATURES had I seen it when it came out rather than now, after Columbine.  This film is based on the true story of two adolescent girls in New Zealand in the 1950s who kill the mother of one of them.  The crime was shocking and like latterday Americans, the New Zealanders must have staggered about saying, we just did not see it coming and how could two girls from nice families do this?  It is precisely that question that the filmmakers seek to answer and, in a very original way, succeed at.<br />The film follows the girls from the point they meet in the restrictive girls' school they attend to the moment of the crime.  In between it reveals two very intelligent misfits who are drawn to each other as if by a fierce law of physics.  Such is their affinity that they invent a fantasy world and inhabit it so intensely as to be able to envision exactly what the other sees in their minds.  Their bond and fantasies affect their judgment, throwing the usual excesses of emerging pubescence off kilter.  When events in their families' lives begin to insert themselves in such a way to threaten a separation of the two friends, they decide to remove the perceived obstacle in their path to togetherness.  <br />It would have been safe to suggest the mystery of the fantasy world but this film shows it concretely.  The clay figures the girls fashion to depict their characters are seen coming to life so that the audience also sees what they see and share.  There is wit, too, in the depiction of the very normal aspects of the girls' experiences with school and families.  In the end, the power of the film comes in the realization that no one aspect of the girls' lives is any different or less sympathetic than the stuff of many coming of age stories, it's just that in this case they were sucked into a vortex so powerful that it knocked out all the emotional safety catches.   The line between angel and monster is a very thin one and that is very scary.  That one of the girls is revealed to have become a well-known, successful personage in her adulthood just adds to the perplexity.<br />All the artistic ducks are in a row behind this production.  Acting, direction, cinematography, sound: all check out.  Disturbing but fascinating.

B000005JAX|5.0|In recently viewing the Depeche Mode videos 85-98, i couldn't help but notice that Martin is the only one in the band who has remained completely static.  His style is unique, and he has stayed true to his roots.  This album, his only solo one, does NOT make use of his songwriting skills, but rather his voice, and offers the fan a true glimpse of the music that moves him.  How many of us have music that truly moves us, that we sing along to, laugh to, cry to?  I love Depeche Mode so much, and SO many bands that followed have been influenced by them, that one begins to wonder what kind of music they listen to?  Well here is that chance... &quot;In A Manner Of Speaking&quot; is such an intensely emotional song, and my personal favorite.....
B00004Z311|5.0|Ahhh, the classic story of good and evil, and this one is mixed with mythical creatures? Yes it's true. This movie is filled with faries, trolls, unicorns, and more. Better yet, this movie is based on evil trying to corrupt innocence.<br />As Tim Curry plays the Prince of Darkness, he wishes to cover the world in a blanket of misery but cannot because a pair of unicorns keep the world stable. As a beautiful princess named Lily (Mia Sara) frolics in the woods with a simple boy named Jack (Tom Cruise), she runs into the last two unicorns in the world. She wishes to touch them and as she attempts to do so she is kidnapped by trolls and the male unicorn's magical horn is chopped off. The world is covered in misery and the other unicorn begins to die without her soul mate. It is up to Jack to restore good into the world and to save the other unicorn. As he meets up with mythical characters on his way, it is up to you to see whether he can accomplish it or not.
B000056NX5|4.0|...and I think it would be difficult to compare the two! The older version was not filmed on a sound stage and the shots were bigger, and reflected the preferences of the time. Both are excellent films, but are different interpretations of the same work.<br />Glenn Carter does a great job, and although I really preferred Tony Vincent as Judas, Pradon does a good job portraying a complex character. In the end, I think I prefer the more recent version...Carter's Jesus is less ascetic, less angelic and much more human. I think that the newer version will reach the younger audience, the feel is definitely more edgy, urban and somehow more intimate.
B000002KMY|3.0|THis CD is good because the musicians involved in this production were good. Also, master-producer Martin Birch was at the helm at the time. But is clearly below &quot;Heaven and Hell&quot; high standards. DIo's lyrics are also a joke, you can't have a clue about what he's talking about most of the time. THis was the firs serious sign the Sabbath's ( or Iommi's ) creativity was gone for sure.
B00003CXP1|5.0|&quot;Requiem For a Dream makes Traffic look like an after-school 'Just Say No' video.&quot; I don't recall where I read it, and I'm just paraphrasing it, but that's about as good a review of both those films as any I've read.
B00000J2SQ|4.0|even featuring awful &quot;pop singer&quot; Joe Lynn Turner on vocals, weve got some terrific tunes here, mainly &quot;DEATH ALLEY DRIVER&quot; and &quot;POWER&quot;. The album is average Rainbow but it never lets you down.
B00000JPH4|5.0|As an avid viewer of many titles across the board as far as animated and muppet type video's, Jim Henson reminds me of the great type of childhood memories I've had growing up and seeing the muppets on television. The Dark Crystal is a fine example of how animation and video graphics have grown over the years. The story of Jen, who in his mind is supposed to be the only remaining Gelfling alive, finds the biggest task of his life begins at a young age. The story has an excellent plot with a very detailed storyline. The wonder and the astonishing visual affects that Henson incorporates into this beautiful story are excellent. Jen goes through various trials throughout the course of the movie, including having to deal with the loss of his family and his mentor, the elder mystic, the Mystics are considered as the wise one's of the world where the Skeksis are the evil counterparts linked to the mystics by that of the Dark Crystal, shattered long ago by the beings who kept the Crystal of Truth. If you are a muppet lover this is one movie you can't miss. Another video that I would recommend is The Labyrinth. Yet another fine work by the master himself, Jim Henson.
B000002KFJ|4.0|Here are my prefered Sabbath ( with Ozzy ) albuns:<br />1) SABBATH BLOODY SABBATH 2) SABOTAGE 3) PARANOID 4) VOLUME FOUR 5) BLACK SABBATH 6) MASTER OF REALITY 7) NEVER SAY DIE 8) TECHNICAL ECSTASY<br />So, I can say there's no flaw at all iN SABOTAGE. The album is perfect, heavy but with musical differences between the songs. Ozzy is singing like never. A true gem.
B000059T5O|5.0|...but ought to give it a listen.  I'm a big fan of Waits' gritty skid row sensibility and found sounds, and with any luck those familiar only with Hammond's blues will develop an appreciation of Waits' raw, gristle-and-veins poetry.  <br />I'm particularly fond of Jockey full of Bourbon, which in the Waits original reminds me of sitting on 3rd street in downtown L.A. at 5AM, listening to a tinny radio in a piece of crap '82 chrysler while a buddy called Bock-A-Looch scores a packet of Mexican Brown... only Hammond's lyrics are much more understandable.  Waits captures the atmosphere, Hammond gives it to the listener.
B000002V0Q|3.0|This band has sold more than twelve million albuns. It's a great accomplishment by a metal band who never sold out ( well, at least totally ... ). So, why I'm givin this great album ( no doubt the best album of the Marty Friedman era )only three stars ? BEcause I keep guessing how many more albuns this band would have sold if Dave Mustaine were a humble person and hired a real singer. His voice destroys the songs, it's great suffering to hear them because of it. It's not because it's a ugly voice. ( Brian Johnson from AC/DC also has an ugly voice, but he could set it into the band's music ). The trouble is that Mustaine doesn't have a clue how to sing !!!! OF course there would be no MEGADETH without Mustaine, but he must recognize the fact that he is one of the worst metal singers ever.

B000059ZLH|5.0|This DVD is absolutely incredible! I saw them on this tour in Denver, CO. I thought that was the ultimate performance but they topped themselves on this one. The music is flawless. James' vocals ame amazing on this recording! The deleted scenes(A mind beside itself, Learning to Live, and Change of Seasons) are worth the price alone. Buy your copy now!!!
6303433766|5.0|Based on the true story of the relationship between Juliet Hulme (Kate Winslet) and Pauline Yvonne Parker/Reiper (Melanie Lynskey).<br />I believe there is too much emphasis placed on the actual murder of Pauline's mother, Honora Parker, even though the murder itself is why this movie was made. Although of course a very important aspect of the movie, it is not the movie entirely, and not the most important aspect of the girl's relationship. In essense, this is a story of two teenaged girls who quite literally fall in love with each other, and who live in a society (early 1950's New Zealand) which would not and could not cope with homosexuality. They began as friends, becoming so because they enjoyed the same things, namely the arts of all varieties. They liked each other because of their similarities, and as they both also enjoyed fantasy, they slowly created a fantasy world only they could enter and understand. I believe they created this fantasy world not only because they probably thought it exciting and a test for their very high intellects, but also because their world made them feel safe from society. Although homosexuality was hardly mentioned during that time - as Glamuzina and Laurie's book &quot;Parker &amp; Hulme A Lesbian View&quot; discusses - the girls still knew the nature of their relationship would not be tolerated by society. A testament to this is referred to in Pauline's diary,(the movie is based in a large part on the writings), where she says something to the effect that she and Juliet could not sleep together on a particular night because they were afraid Juliet's father might walk in on them. They were best friends, and they were in love with each other; they shared a love that few could understand, and fewer have experienced because it was so pure and innocent. I believe that is why this movie has captivated so many people. They created their fantasy world in attempt to hide their love for each other from society, and even though they lovedeach other so deeply, when they slept together (as the movie shows), they started out pretending one or the other was a &quot;saint&quot;, which was always a man, which helped them accept the act that they were engaging in; they did this because society's insinuation of 'this is wrong' was constantly in the back of their minds. The murder occured because the threat of being parted occured - they could not live without each other....<br />In the end, in Juliet's words: &quot;It's all frightfully romantic!&quot;
0425098478|5.0|this book is a good read.  i heard about it and i bought it!  the price of this book is the best investment i have made since my promotion!  i have read it two times already and i learned something new each time.  the goal setting was a skill that i lacked.  also i was reminded how important praising is to the employee.  my skills were enhanced by this book!!!
B00004ZAV3|5.0|This is a great collection of The Beatles' #1 hits, but understand you're only scratching the surface here. ALL of their studio albums deserve to be heard, so think of this CD as your Beatles primer. You have an incredible journey ahead of you. Rock on!!
0425163407|5.0|i read this book a year ago when i was...15 (yes i'm 16 now). i found it very interesting....enough for me to keep me reading it. i read it in 2 days, it was an exhilarating and embracing book. FYI if you're gonna buy it, just buy the paperback...that's the one i read and it was just as good as the hardcover. i suppose. on the other hand, if you don't like weird medical stuff, then...this book might not be for you. however, i've always been interested in anatomy and forensics (call me weird but i like to read about dead people). it deals with the type of forensic tools, and medical information. hopefully that won't fly over your head. :-)
B00005BJ2O|5.0|I just purchased this cd today and have already listened to it at least once all the way through. I was blown away by the entire thing.Ewan and Nicole both do their own songs and yes,they really can sing! I highly recommend this cd and will continue to listen often.[Every day,at least]
0785788719|5.0|Jules Verne's &quot;20,000 Leagues Under the Sea&quot; is an incredible story that keeps the reader in suspense. In the beginning, the suspense erupts out of a mystery about this &quot;creature&quot; that has ripped apart several substantially atrong ships. To find out, Pierre Arronax and his faithful servant, Conseil, Journey on a ship that finds its way into the harshness of this beast, which actually is a submarine. Then the mystery shifts; How is this ship operated? How can this even be scientifically feasible? And most of all; Where did this Captain Nemo come from and just what is he all about? The events that occur provide clues, and the story becomes more and more suspenseful until.....WHAM!; the story ends. This is a terrific book.
0743200799|1.0|I thought of the word was \\"square\\" and I thought of that word many times as I wended my way through this surprisingly tedious book.<br /><br />I say surprisingly, as the space program had many many interesting people and events.  Kranz is a horrid story-teller, he makes it as stale as week-old bread.  Apollo 13 was a wonderful movie, exciting as anything and Kranz' discussion of the flight is dull, dull, dull!!<br /><br />Kranz makes a plea for more space exploration but fails to provide a reason for it beyond giving his fellow engineers and controllers a job.<br /><br />Kranz brags about the long hours he spends, the endless preparation.  But he also brags about how many children he has.  Heck, why have children if you are a wokoholic.  Or simply keep your personal life out of it<br /><br />People have asked me why I choose to review some books and not others.  It is a good question.  After much thought, I have realized that if a book is extremely good, I want to tell the world about it.  Or in this case, when I choose a new book, I hate being disappointed.  This book disappointed me badly.
B000002U82|5.0|The incredible thing about this album is every note, every sound effect,every single second recorded is properly placed to perfection without sounding over produced or overdone. Yeah it's a concept album but I won't bore you with a long drawn out review on what every song or lyrical content mean's because I think that's a personal thing and it's a different interpretation for everyone listining. All I know is when i play this album from start to finish, time just disappear's and when it end's I need to hear it again. How many albums do you know that can do that over and over for you. LONG LIVE DARK SIDE OF THE MOON!!
B000006TRV|4.0|Pink Floyd cribbed an idea from the Beatles, namely let's put out a big double album with a mostly white cover. &quot;The Wall&quot; features a few brilliant classic tracks, such as &quot;Mother&quot; and &quot;Comfortably Numb,&quot; but as a concept album it doesn't hold together with any clarity. The music is all carefully played and produced, but the overall dark tone makes it ponderous to me. This kind of angst-ridden album is perfect for alienated high school boys.
B000002C1W|3.0|It's simple, the David Gilmore (PINK FLOYD) compared to the Roger Waters (PINK FLOYD) is a much more melodic,uplifting less depressing (PINK FLOYD). I think Roger and Dave were an incredible team,and no dout that duo gave us some of the best music and lyric's around but unfortunately that's over so enjoy what David Gilmore's (PINK FLOYD) has to offer. There's something on this album for everyone,Instumentals,Balled Rock,Blue's Rock,Acoustic,Psycadelic,Melodic,Scary,and Anthem Like...
B00005BJ2O|3.0|Good news first:  Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman have no problem selling soundtrack ballads and music hall confections.  Both have pleasant voices, and enough acting chops to get these songs over on character alone.  For his part, McGregor shines on his on Elton John's &quot;Your Song&quot;.  The rest of the CD is heavy slogging though crazy medleys (&quot;Sparkling Diamonds&quot;) and misguided remakes (Beck's kitchen-sink version of &quot;Diamond Dogs&quot; makes an already difficult song near impenetrable).  There are highlights, however:  &quot;Lady Marmalade&quot; is impossible to destroy, and Christina Aguilera, et al, do the song proud; Rufus Wainwright's simple piano ballad &quot;Complainte de la Butte&quot; is an oasis in the midst of chaos, and &quot;Hindi Sad Diamonds&quot; is a Bollywood musical set to heavy metal.  As it stands, though, the collection is schizophrenic -- maybe the film will give these songs their proper meaning and context.
0671867369|5.0|Amrose has written a remarkable book of war by writing about where war is fought -- at the Company level. Much more than the story of this one excellent warfighting team, Ambrose shows us the limitations and achievements of a single rifle company, this one paratroopers. <br />He is able to communicate the pride, the terror and the technical aspects of battle.<br />A must read for history lovers and a crossover book for any non-fiction reader.
B00005ARDC|4.0|This San Francisco trio is going to get compared, ad nauseam, to The Jesus &amp; Mary Chain circa Psychocandy.  Well, B.R.M.C. is that, and a lot more.  The feedback is here, but under a tighter rein, which gives the loaded melodies freer reign, and though there's darkness in the contours, these Bay area boys don't wallow in the mire, they rock themselves out of it.  There are echoes of great bands from the past twenty years, but the nifty trick BRMC pulls off is that even though they mix elements of gothic, glam, techno, punk, they never sound slavish to any one sound.  They aren't too deathly serious about it all, either, most noticeably at the beginning of \\"As Sure as the Sun\\", when guitarist Peter Hayes punctuates his gothic blues with electric blasts of \\"Also Sprach Zarathustra\\".
B000056K04|2.0|The worst Dave CD Ever, i couldn't believe it when i bought it. Dave and the band need to find there roots again i believe. There was this whole thing with Dylan's not gonna be the same after electric, but he proved it, he proved he could. Dave proved the couldn't, this is awful, it's made for MTV ...
B000002OZY|5.0|I recently decided to broaden my musical roots.  With this undertaking in mind I went in search of records that were truly great.  Repeatedly this album was mentioned, so I finally caved in and bought it.  I was not disappointed.  From the opening chords Pete Townshend and the boys lay out a beautiful, intelligent, cohesive story. Lyrically this is one of the most challenging and interesting rock journeys ever.  That in itself would make this album a keeper, however the music that accompanies the story makes this album truly classic.  Every song is powerful and moving.  This is definitely an album that a true music fan MUST have in their collection.
B00000099Y|5.0|The complex sounds of this album are almost hypmotizing, the lyrics are so deep and powerful, and the vocal stylings of Maynard James Keenan just tie everything together into a perfect harmony.  You can feel this music inside you.  Unlike most music out there today, you can easily tell that there is something meaningful behind Tool's music.  You can tell this album wasn't written with the hopes of becoming mainstream.  You can tell this album isn't full of hollow emotions and materialized angst. I recomend ording this album, along with &quot;Opiate&quot;, &quot;Undertow&quot;, &quot;Salival&quot;, and the upcoming release &quot;Lateralus&quot; which blows all of their previous albums out of the water.  Like a fine wine, Tool keeps getting better with age.
0944379044|5.0|This book is the best book I have ever read. Don't get me wrong, I in no way support Adolf Hitler, his actions, or the beleifs of the National Socialist(nazi) Party. I bought this book because I have a great interest in WWII(mainly the war in Europe). The way in which the Nazi party and Adolf Hitler took power in Germany absolutely astonishes me. Most people do not believe that such a ruthless man could have taken power so peacefully and be voted into power. It is ironic that in hopes to prevent Germany from ever again becoming a threat to world peace with the writing and signing of the Versailles Treaty, Europe allowed Hitler to take power during Germany's depression after WWI. A fact that most readers of this book do not know is that it was not actually written by Hitler. It was rather written by his cellmate and fellow Nazi, Rudopf Hess. Hess would later become Hitler's second in command. During their 9 month imprisonement after attempting to overthrow the pre-existing German government, Hitler dictated to Hess who wrote what Hitler said. This book is from the mind of Hitler, just the hand of Hess.
B000059Z8J|5.0|Personally, this is one of the movies I wanted on DVD when I first got my player. Of course, being new to the DVD, I figured they'd have just about every movie possible converted to DVD. I figured wrong and was so disappointed that I bought what figured to be the next best thing... the BATMAN DVD. I figured wrong again. All I know is BATMAN better be the next super-hero flick to get the &quot;special&quot; treatment. If they did the same thing as SUPERMAN, I would not have minded a long and predictable wait. I have watched my SUPERMAN DVD atleast 5 times all the way through including the special extras, and it has to be the best &quot;special edition&quot; movie I've bought since FIGHT CLUB! The documentaries are unbelieveable and definetely something I was looking forward to more than watching the new footage. It still amazes me how they made Superman fly! The added scenes are the second best special item on the DVD. They don't ruin the movie at all but actually explain and make original scences more interesting, if not better. Another item is the screen tests. They can be interesting to watch, sometimes. The rest of the time you can actually feel embarrassed having watched the entirety of them. These screen tests are however pretty enjoyable. The only complaints you can give this DVD is the following: 1.) Warner Bros. need to get with it. The cardboard case they offer may save them some big bucks compared to plastic cases, but everybody I know hate them. They are too easy to break, especially the inside that holds in the DVD. Those always seem fragile until they do break. Plus... 2.) They fit everything on one disc using both sides, making the disc more delicate (smudges, scratches, etc). I am still angry about the GOODFELLAS DVD I bought which forces you to flip the DVD halfway through the film. But the special features on SUPERMAN are worth the flip. In closing, I believe everyone will give their personal recommendation on this DVD. Everyone, somehow or someway,is a big Superman fan. For a true comicbook fan, this is icing on the cake. Bon appetite!
B00000K31Q|4.0|Without being too over-the-top or annoyingly dramatic, 10 Things I Hate About You is a witty, harmless, inventive teen film that did and continues to do more than She's All That or Drive Me Crazy could've wished. The film is refreshing, even if it doesn't have the newest story of the century. It does the Shakespearean thang with hip sensibility and creative script-writing. Julia Stiles and Heath Ledger who play Kat and Patrick are an awesome team, they comedically portray a teens version of romance with style and interest. I loved the scripting and the film doesn't go grey with age too quickly.
0790729652|2.0|Though I did get a great deal on this DVD..., that is the only bright side. Batman is a great movie, and actually won an Oscar. So why release this DVD before it's time without special features? For it could surely use the super-sized treatment such as the Special Edition SUPERMAN I recently purchased. Not only do consumers want to own this movie to watch whenever they feel the urge. They also need the inside dirt on the making of the film! Personally I was blown away by the extras on the SUPERMAN DVD. For it's time the things they had to do to make people believe a man could fly (in the late 70's I remind you) were something I have always been interested in, but had never had a chance to see anywhere else. Hence when making a DVD, you should always try to go all out.... My personal opinion rating on this DVD (2 stars) is based solely on the DVD, not the film. It is great to see Batman that clear with sound that is astonishing...but after watching the SUPERMAN DVD, all I am interested in is to know &quot;where did Batman get all those wonderful toys.&quot;
B00005ASOC|4.0|There are some great, hidden films that just come and surprise you out of the blue. Finding Forrester is one of them. It's a sometimes stunning, rarely boring picture that made me think about my further talents as a writer, and, better yet, it made me want to use them. The film is about writing and race (but it doesn't annoy you with the annoying \\"black and white\\" issue) that is sure to be remembered, thanks to it's stunning performances from the ultimate man, Sean Connery, from the amazing newcomer Rob Brown and the impressive Anna Paquin. I'll admit the film is over-long, but it is still very much worth the price you pay to see it. Look out for a surprise cameo from Matt Damon as a lawyer.
630512762X|5.0|Possibly is. The only other American action movie that is equal is possible \\"The Rock\\" also w/ Nicholas Cage. This is probably better though. Micheal Bay is nothing compared to Woo in the action department. This movie rules. It sad i missed it in theaters, goddam summer camp. I saw it on video and rented it a rediculous amount of times. THis movie is amazing. This is what made me the die-hard Woo fan i am today. Far better then anything else he made in America, though Broken Arrow and M:I 2 were cool. Hard Target just plain. THe plot is one of the more original and not just the 20th die hard rip off which is what most action films are these days. not that i am against die hard rip-offs its just nice to see an original plot. The movie has a great opening shoot-out that truly dazzles. The rest is history. This movie has all the Woo stuff. Complex characters. A character who studies the nature of good and evil. Doves flying around. A church. 2 guns. Lots of action. Truly cool. The action is amazing and blows away anything American action directors have thus far produced. Stunning and beautifull sequences of mayhem and destruction that only Woo could do. Cage/Travolta were amazing. Both should have been nominated for Oscars. Of couse the academy would look bad giving nods to people in an action flick but i think they did better then the other people nominated that year. Travola is the coolest bad guy like in Broken ARrow. Cage is cool too but is an awesome good guy as well. See this movie. You will be amazed.
B000002G7E|5.0|For those with an adventurous taste for rock, there's &quot;White Light White Heat.&quot; I love the concept behind this thing - rock isn't supposed to be prissy, it's all about gut feeling. Accordingly, the band seem to have set up mikes just about anywhere in the room, almost at random, and let 'er rip. The result isn't quite white noise, but this buzzing mess has the excitement of art that has an idea behind it that might actually work. You can hear the vocals, and these are some good Lou Reed songs. (If they weren't, the experiment would have been a failure.) Zing, buzz, pow. Great, out-there stuff. &quot;The Gift&quot; is the only weak link - the long spoken story in it isn't the kind of thing you want to hear more than once or twice - but the rest of this audacious thing makes up for it.
B00000IAU3|4.0|Dido ... that name didn't exactly bring to mind a talented singer; but that of Fido-Dido the 7Up animated sprite.<br />My first impression was that of that of just another flash-in-the-pan but to tell you the truth, this is a pretty refreshing album if you're the type who've been listening to BSB, Westlife et al and have been looking around for songs which doesn't reek of &quot;baby&quot; &quot;love&quot; and the rest of the syrupy songs/lyrics.<br />Dido will certainly be appreciated by fans of Sarah McLachlan and , upto an extent, fans of the Cranberries. I found her voice and singing style hauntingly similar to that of Dolores O'Riordan in one of the tracks.<br />My favourite track is the oft-played &quot;thank you&quot; and I also liked the opening track &quot;Here with me&quot;. I never really appreciated Bjork so I liked &quot;Isobel&quot; pretty much ! ;-)<br />I dunno why but although I liked the whole album, I just can't recall any song that stood out (ok, except &quot;Thank you&quot;) in my mind. I look at the play list here but I simply can't recall how each track sounded like nor the lyrics to each track. It's as if I'm looking at the tracks of an album that I've never come across !<br />Well, if you like Dido, be sure to check out &quot;Lene Marlin&quot;. Personally I find Lene Marlin's voice modulation and lyrics much more mature and mesmerising. But hey ! Dido's great nonetheless ! More power to her !<br />And if you don't appreciate this album, you probably wont like this particular genre of music so stay clear ! There's nothing wrong with the album at all (singer/songs/music/lyrics) !<br />Recommended !!!
6305313687|4.0|The movie had excellent acting and cinematagraphy. But it glorified neo-nazism too much during the first half, especially during the Basketball game, I mean please...
0399146253|4.0|I love Kay Scarpetta. She is the epitome of who most women strive to be: strong, empowered and independent. And this book did her more justice than any previously...Cornwell actually gave us some insight into Scarpetta's mind for a change. While I admit the plot was quite convoluted, it was a nice change of pace to get inside of Scarpetta to find out how everything in her life has effected her. I actually found myself more interested in her sessions with Anna at times than in the rest of the plot. Plus, I found the ending dissappointing how neatly it wrapped up. Lucy seems to be turning into a real superwoman, like her aunt. Though Cornwell seems to have written herself into a corner, I can't wait to see how she gets Scarpetta out of it.
B000002JK2|5.0|I bought this album as soon as it came out. I had it for several years and I don't think a week passed that it wasn't played by myself or one of my compadre's. At some point someone else decided they needed the album more than me. That doesn't mean I don't remember every song and the mood it brought with it. Ronnie  Lane could use a soft melody to help you sip your pint while sitting just a few feet away at a table at your favorite pub, or so it seemed. Then Mr.Townsend would raise the sound to stadium level, if you wanted. It is like riding a rollercoaster of sound that you will never forget. The title of the disc says one thing but the music says something completely different. I can't wait for the flash backs once I receive the disc. Try it on. I'm sure it will fit. Thanks for your time.
B00005BJ2O|5.0|This is unlike most soundtrack albums that have a lot of fluff. It's filled with incredible song after song, all crucial to the movie. Lady Marmalade is the easy choice for the first single, but there are so many amazing songs on this CD that aren't so radio-friendly, but are still sublime. Ewan McGregor's cover of &quot;Your Song&quot; soars. And the tango version of &quot;Roxanne&quot; is beyond words. This soundtrack could become a classic.

0782008364|5.0|First, let me compliment the cast.  The two female leads, I believe, did an absolutely fabulous job with their roles, and convinced me that they could have actually have fallen in love.  That is very important, because everything else that happens in the film is dependent on believing that they have developed enough love and trust in each other to pull off the caper they are attempting.  Joe Pantoliano also does a good job as the mobster trying to pull himself out of the hole he finds himself in when the movie really kicks into gear.<br /> Okay, to get to the plot.  Basically, Jennifer Tilly's character(Violet) sees and then meets Gina Gershon's character(Corky), they develop a relationship, fall in love, and then decide to steal over two million dollars from the mob and blame it on Violet's boyfriend.  That's only the nut shell though, the actual story takes many twists and turns over this material as things start spinning wildly out of control, and things don't always go the way that the girls had planned.<br /> A lot of the story depends on split timing from the girls, and the belief that they could trust one another enough to pull this off after knowing each other for such a short time, and the fact that they could have fallen in love with one another.  Their relationship does seem to develop fairly fast, but from the first time the two of them really talked to one another over a cup of coffee, to the scene where Violet entices Corky over by asking her to get an earring she dropped down the drain out for her, I was sold.  Just listening to Violet breathlessly asking Corky to kiss her as they sat on the couch after the earring episode was an experience in itself.<br /> After that, when the money enters the picture, their relationship is primarily put on the back burner as everything now hinges around the money.  The money is stolen, rather cleverly, but from there things start going downhill for the two of them.  Ceasar, Pantoliano's character, doesn't react theway Corky thought he would, and soon the bodies begin to pile up, and after a little trick with a redial button, the girls find themselves in real danger, where they really need their trust in one another to save their lives.<br /> The pace of the movie always remains brisk, and I found myself constantly sitting on the edge of my seat as I watching it, all the way through until the end.  I don't want to spoil the ending for anyone, so don't read the end of this if you haven't already seen the movie.  I like the movies where the bad guy gets his, and although almost everyone in this movie was a bad guy in one way or another, even the two female leads, I still enjoyed seeing Violet blow Ceasar away, and the two girls riding off into the metaphoric sunset with the two million dollars.  A most enjoyable way to spend two hours of your time, at least in my book.  Hope you think so too.
0887306101|5.0|If you love the market and always wanted to be a trader this is a great book. It will not make a successful trader out of you but will give you some ideas about how to approach your own day to day dealings in the market.
0451169514|5.0|Why can't we hold onto the magic of being young, when if you &quot;stepped on the crack&quot; you would &quot;break your mother's back&quot;?  This is a story that focuses of the beliefs and the magic of seven friends who BELIEVED, really BELIEVED in the magic of themselves, and hung onto that belief when they needed it the most, even after it had faded into adulthood.  This is so much more than a horror story, it's characters are so much more than just characters in a story, they are your childhood friends, the ones you rode bikes with down the longest hill, the ones who told you not to pick up that penny because it was on the &quot;tails&quot; side, and that was bad luck, the ones who believed in all the MAGIC of friendship.  Once you pick it up, you won't put it down until the very last page, and then you'll want more.  I took this book everywhere, read it everywhere, and I did it twice :)  Let Stephen King take you back to the place where magic was within your reach just by holding onto the hands of your friends.
0780622642|4.0|Most of my adult friends didn't like this movie but my kids kept playing it over and over.  One of my sons even played it during his birthday party!  It is kid-friendly with the approximately three profane words quite well placed.  The pace seems a little slow in-between action scenes but overall very enjoyable.  There are also cameo appearances by some of the actors from the classic TV series.  And just as in the TV series, Dr. Smith seems to be the focal point for maintaining your interest for the duration of the film.  Great performance by Gary Oldman as Dr. Smith.
B000002MU3|5.0|This is easily one of the ten best albums I've ever heard.  What's amazing about it is that here we have an album by R.E.M., a band best known for composing &quot;ballads rich with lush harmonies&quot; (whatever that means), and here, they're just playing their hearts out, and yet a lot of that harmonic genius is very evident.<br />For example, in &quot;Let Me In&quot;, an absolutely tormented song which may or may not be about Kurt Cobain..., Peter Buck is using more distortion than at any point in his career, and yet halfway through, this absolutely stunning organ countermelody creeps in, and the tone of the piece instantly shifts from angstful to mournful.<br />Stipe takes a lyrical turn here, too - these lyrics are less his normal affirmation of life than introspective pieces written from characters' points of view - characters who are all too human.  Tales of ... guilt, of reinventing oneself to impress a girl, of accepting greed, of jealousy and tormented helplessness.  Yet, each one of these themes is wrapped in poetry and metaphor, and every character is presented sympathetically despite his or her shortcomings.<br />In short, this is a true masterpiece.
B0000025R3|4.0|Indeed a very delightful record of the egnimatic eighties.  The beats are quite captivating and the lyrics quite thought provoking.  Just what is a vegemite sandwich anyway?  Its a shame this band disappeared almost as quickly as it emerged on the scene.  This music is clever without being sappy. The saxaphone playing is quite nice as well.  Worth a spin.
6305363668|5.0|This movie is astounding; it is about love, and what it means to be human.  Harrison Ford plays an essential role; but it is Rutger Hauer who makes you love and makes tears come to your eyes.  When you see his vision and beauty, it etches itself on your memory; every moment of life, and every act and sight, falling short of beauty (and love) is compared, and found pale, and the need is to make it beautiful.  That is, an inspiration toward life.  Hauer is vibrant in this role.  Nothing could be more moving than his performance in the latter scenes of the film.  Just about every word, action, and facial expression is worth your attention.<br />Don't worry about ideas, or cognitive questions, maybe not even about \\"moral questions.\\"  It is deeper than that, and the only adequate response to poetry is poetry, or love. It will sing in your heart; and make you glad--though perhaps cry, but without regret.<br />To a man, every one of us crawling between earth and heaven.  Here is the aspiration.
B00005AXEL|5.0|My god, does this woman ever stop!!!! Love her!!!! This is another powerful deliverance of sound from the wonderful Miss Nicks. I am constantly overwhelmed by her powerful voice and determination. This album has some songs that resemble her old style such as the title track and &quot;Planets of the Universe&quot;. The duet she sings with Sarah McLachlan is wonderfully enchating both with the style and the lyrics it conveys. She also works with Sheryl Crow, Macy Gray, and others to make this album well rounded. Each song is different. If you like Stevie at all, you will not regret buying this album!!!
B00004CWO8|5.0|I loved this ballet. I first heard of Adam Cooper when he played the 25 year old Billy Elliot. I like this DVD, It has information about Adam Cooper and it says he went to Art Academy at age 11, the same age as Billy Elliot. I don't know if Billy Elliot is his life story but there was a coincidence. Anyway, He is a fantastic dancer and the rest of the company were excellent. You will not go wrong to purchase this DVD.
B00000ILBK|5.0|With First Contact Paramount proved that they had figured out doing Star Trek on the big screen (though they still were having a bit of trouble getting the comedy part right).  With Insurrection they did it again.  To top off the exceptional plot and above-par writing Franks (director/Riker) has demonstrated mastery of Trek-humor.  There is no blatant slapstick -- instead it is replaced with a rendition of the HMS Pinafore (complete with a Disney-esque bouncing ball to point to the correct word in the song.  Insurrection has an excellent plot, deals with tough choices (mostly Picard's), and really comes off as a great movie.  I'm not sure if it can compete with First Contact's Borg -- but it, at least, is a close second!
078401213X|4.0|I think &quot;Pi&quot; will do for indie thrillers what &quot;Clerks&quot; has done for indie comedies. Both movies are shot in a somewhat gritty b&amp;w film, both have a great vision, and both have actors you've probably never seen before but who do a bang-up job nonetheless.<br />The similarities end there. This movie is pretty hard-nosed, and it's not for the faint of heart or for anyone with a short attention span. I actually enjoyed watching this movie by myself and making my own conclusions - I suggest you do the same at first before watching again with your friends. It demands your full attention.<br />Especially for those fascinated with numbers, this movie will knock your socks off. The main character is hunting for a pattern to Wall Street. This makes him quite popular with a group of individuals looking to bank some serious cash. Also interested is a sect of Jews looking to find a 216-digit number that will unlock the secrets of God. Think of the pressure! The man understandibly suffers headaches and an eventual mental breakdown.<br />Most people have been introduced to chaos theory if they've read &quot;Jurassic Park.&quot; It's a good start, and &quot;Pi&quot; will take you further down those roads. There are ample &quot;A-ha!&quot; experiences of insight, and though the ending is kind of the easy way out (hence 4 stars instead of 5), it will be quite enjoyable. &quot;Pi&quot; is one great reason why you should explore an independent film now and again: It is definitely a departure from the realm of big-budget entertainment that puts special effects and pretty faces ahead of good acting and a good plot.
B00005AXEL|5.0|Not only will die hard Stevie Nicks fans love this CD, but so will the rest of us. When you listen to Trouble in Shangri-la it doesn't take long before you realize why Stevie is called the Queen of Rock n Roll.  This CD is a fabulous collection of well-written songs that discuss real life from a woman who has lived it all.  This CD is a real keeper!
B00000JHAU|2.0|Belle and Sebastian never fail to totally confuse this listener, and this album seems to carry the most obvious examples of their perplexing sound. The good: The melodies are very catchy. The songs are played with admirable restraint, with a clear head for what atmosphere they try to evoke; a wistful, slyly melancholy musical space that soothes the listener, while implanting some solid, hummable melody and subtle instrumental work. ...This music is well-played; the group know their sound and how to use it. But since it has no originality to it, that isn't saying very much, is it?
B0000057C5|4.0|In the world of industrial rock, Rammstein is king.  Although they may not quite fit under this category, the subtle synth and grunge-like guitar riffs are all that the critiques need.  Rammstein is not truly heavy like Metallica (BOOOOOOO), hard like Slipknot (BOOOOOOOO), or industrial like Front Line Assembly.  However, it is rhythmic and energized music that be listened to in either a bad/violent mood or when you just want to relax.  Not many bands can accomplish that.<br />Despite a bad reputation because of Columbine (as if Rammstein had anything to do with it) and horrendous translations (&quot;du hast&quot; means &quot;you HAVE&quot;, hence the single S) Rammstein is still alive and producing new music.  That, again, takes skill.<br />Sehnsucht is, in my opinion, the best Rammstein album, but not buy much.  Buy it if you want, if not, you're missing out.
B00004Z459|4.0|With the oncoming surge of rap-metal bands being signed everyday, I thought the genre was practically dead. Sure, there are a few good rap-metal bands kicking around ((hed)p.e., Downset) but the bulk of them just can't seem to interest me. When I heard &quot;One Step Closer&quot; I was immediately repulsed -- screaming &quot;Shut up when I'm talking to you&quot; 15 times just doesn't qualify as talent in my book, so basically I just wrote this band off as another up-coming has-been. It wasn't until hearing &quot;Points of Authority&quot; on my local radio station that I started getting interested. So, I went ahead and bought the CD, figuring &quot;Hey, it can't be as bad as Chocolate Starfish&quot; and low and behold, it was a great CD. From the opening &quot;Papercut,&quot; Linkin Park seem to keep up a great momentum and the vocals (while admittingly sounding Backstreetish) are actually really great, most noteable on &quot;Crawling&quot; and &quot;In the End.&quot; Songs like &quot;A Place for my Head&quot; and &quot;Runaway&quot; are easily forgotten, but the really good songs pretty much eliminate those. Linkin Park surprised me with a rather good album, and it seems to me most of the reviewers who gave this a low-rating seem to think they are just a Limp Bizkit knock-off, but if you ACTUALLY hear the album, you will realize that they are two totally different bands. Give this band a try, you never know.
B000003N7G|5.0|For someone who is not a music afficionado or jazz expert, this album took a few listenings to appreciate. But once I stopped talking over it, driving during it, working through it and simply listened, the revelation was Amazing. I can not tell you how the melodic lines complement the chord changes or anything like that. What I can tell you is that this album brings forth a joy from deep within me. Coltrane's sax simply screams, yells, leaps, and sings with unbridled happiness. I can listen to Persuance/Psalm over and over and over, and every time I get the same emotional response. Coltrane and his crew felt something as they recorded this, and looking through the liner notes, I can understand where their happiness stems from. Simply put, this album is Unbelievable.
6300216268|4.0|I'd heard about this movie for years and finally rented it. Loved it instantly for the zany plot, and some laugh-out-loud scenes with Bud Cort and his mother! I went out afterward and bought Cat Stevens' Greatest Hits! Ruth Gordan's Maude is so great, and has such a refreshingly unconventional view of life and death. The relationship between the two leads is really touching, and I appreciated the insightful scenes and dialogue. Favorite moments: Harold and Maude watching the seagulls by the garbage dump when Harold notices the tattoo on her arm; Maude's observations when they are sitting in the field of daisies. Sweet, funny, and different; this movie always cheers me up when I'm down!
B00003W8NM|1.0|This movie kicks some serious butt, if ya know what I mean.  I mean really.  It's the sobering slap in the face for moviegoers everywhere, from New York City to Paris to Philly, PA.  The fab HELENA BONHAM CARTER, straight out of England, is a real treat to behold, so check her out in FIGHT CLUB as Ed Norton's main squeeze.  Ed norton is great in the lead role as Tyler Derden, and BRAD PITT lights uyp the big screen in his hunky superstar way (and the small screen too) in the very same role - that's right, the same role!!  This movie movie really makes you think about hoW THE HUMAN BRAN REALLY WORks and how sometimes each all of us feel like wer'e someone else sometimes.  Who is Tyler Derden anyway???  Watch and find out, but don't blink.  You might just miss something important=!  Catch you later, fellow fight clubbers.  #1
B00004XONN|5.0|True RADIOHEAD fans hate when their saviors are compared with Pink Floyd but here the comparison must be made: KID A is their answer to 'Dark Side Of THe Moon'. Immersing themselves in the 'studio as an instrument' motif, Radiohead manages to distort everything popularly conceived as rock &amp; roll. Tossing conventional song structure to the wind, Radiohead offers us heaping portions of sonics. Sounds swirl in and fade, Yorke's vocals seem more an instrument then punctuation, keyboards chime in and are then forgotten... the whole album seems like an experiment. And the results are brilliant. From the soft padded introduction of 'Everything In It's Right Place' to the slow, drowning wisps of 'Motion Picture Soundtrack', the album creates and holds a feeling, an emotion, unlike anything recorded in the past twenty-odd years. The distorted ending minutes of 'How To Disappear Completely' and the bombastic jazz blow-out which caps off 'The National Anthem' are two moments which would seem so damned out of place were they not included on a Radiohead album. 'Optimistic' offers a glimpse of more classic rock stylings, but those are few and far between here. Radiohead have always tried to push the envelope, go in directions they should not go, and yet they always manage to find their way home. KID A is a magnificent album, one which first-time listeners will find disorientating and challenging. But when was the last time an album challenged your notions of rock and roll? Radiohead continue to shine.
6303142257|1.0|Neither appropriate for kids nor for adults. This movie is boring and confusing at the same time. Dont buy it.
B00004X0Q0|5.0|This is pure rock &amp; roll: sloppy, energetic, amazing. Rarely have I heard a CD that has managed to inject so much adrenaline into every passing second as this. Everything here works brilliantly. The crunching guitars, rubbery bass, pounding drums, near-manic vocals... it's enough to induce heart-attacks. This is full-on, nose-bleed punk rock. But beneath the wall of grunge hides a careful composition of song. This sounds sloppy and thrown-together, but it is not. Like Nirvana's 'Nevermind', each song rolls on like a roller coaster, slowing down to prepare for massive momentum. Lyrics are used like weapons, listening to Cedric Bixler belt out lines like 'sacrifice on rail-road tracks/ freight-freight train coming!/ freight-freight train coming!' is enought to drain you of breath, each line spit out with tremendous emotion. 'One Armed Scissor' and 'Arcarsenal' are pure 'break stuff' music while 'Invalid Litter Dept.' and 'Quarentined' are as close to adrenaline ballads as you're likely to find anywhere. This is strong stuff from a band who has perfected their craft with several (unfortunately unheard) indie albums. You may need to have a pacemaker installed after listening, but it will be the greatest heart attack you've ever had. I promise.
B0000025F7|5.0|Yes, this album is better than Thriller.  This was music that saw Michael and Quincy Jones team up and when Michael was &quot;black&quot;(literally!).  It's hard to believe that this was the first album ever to have 4 top 10 hits by a solo artist.  Although it sold 9 million copies, Off the Wall has never got the respect it deserved because of Thriller.  However, I feel that Off the Wall is a mandatory selection for any music lover just as Saturday Night Fever, Sgt Pepper's, Thriller, and Pet Sounds.<br />All the tracks are good--there's no filler here!  However, these are the tracks that stand out in my mind:<br />1) Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough -- His 2nd #1 (after Ben) overall and the first #1 from the album.  This is an unbelievable record--it's pure disco with Michael singing about forces (he's actually talking about spiritual things here).  I just love the overall sound of this song.  Definitely one of the best tracks.<br />2) Rock With You -- The other #1 from the album.  This song is more of a ballad and it has such a smooth feel to it.  If there was ever a perfect song, this is it.  Another highlight of the album!<br />3) Working Day and Night -- Strictly an album track, this song has a very frenetic pace with a hook that you can't get out of your head.<br />5) Off the Wall -- the title track and a song that went to #10, it sorta foreshadows Thriller with its spooky texture.<br />6) Girlfriend -- a song written by Paul McCartney, it is a very fun song to listen to.<br />7) She's Out of My Life -- another song that went to #10, this song, IMHO, is Michael's greatest ballad ever.  The only song that comes close is Man in the Mirror.  It boggles my mind that this song didn't go to #1.  If you don't get chills going down your spine when you listen to this song, then you ain't human!<br />9) It's the Falling in Love -- pretty much a duet with Patti Austin (one of Q's favorite singers along with James Ingram), it has a very funky, dance quality to it.<br />In summary, this is a must-have album.  After 20 years, it still sounds great and fresh.  It's not that I hate Thriller, it's just that I love Off the Wall better.
B000001E29|5.0|Almost every review addresses how hard this album is to listen to. I am likely part of a small minority that immediately loved the Black Rider. Waits has never sounded better: &quot;November&quot;, &quot;That's The Way&quot;, &quot;Briar and the Rose&quot;, &quot;Lucky Day&quot;, and &quot;Last Rose of Summer&quot; are easily as sentimental and poetic as any Waits song on ANY other album he has recorded.  Like any other Waits album, the Black Rider has its fair share of haunting melodies... &quot;Flash Pan Hunter&quot; and &quot;Crossroads&quot; immediately come to mind.<br />With &quot;Waitsian&quot; melodies, recording techniques similar to those found on his album &quot;Bone Machine&quot;, and a great story and SOME lyrics provided by the great William S. Burroughs, you simply can't go wrong with this album.
0385335482|5.0|After reading Bridget Jones, i was on a rampage to get anything  British and girly.  When i finished Shopaholic i flipped to the first chapter to start it over again!  i really  don't agree with all of the people describing every new book about women to be a Bridget Jones clone, especially this book.  The writing was funnier and better, and instead of screaming, &quot;Bridget Jones is me.&quot;  I am screaming, &quot;I am Rebecca Bloomwood.&quot;
B00005AXEL|5.0|This is by far the best CD in 5 years from anyone. My hope is that this type of music puts an end to the computerized Brittney the Brat...<br />Stevie's voice soars and the music is amazing.<br />\\"Planets of the Universe\\" is one hauntingly great song.<br />The whole CD is a classic.
6300214826|5.0|When the United States was thrown into the quagmire of the Vietnam conflict, the nation entered into one of its most trying, devastating and longest wars, suffering the loss of thousands of its finest men and women to the perils of warfare.  In the years preceding the long-awaited finale, Hollywood opened the floodgates of war memories, unleashing a host of movies pertaining to the war-- &quot;Born On the Fourth Of July,&quot; &quot;Full Metal Jacket,&quot; and the acclaimed &quot;The Killing Fields.&quot;  Although the war movies released during this post-war era did vividly communicate the aura of human suffering from the battlefield. In 1979, a more distinct and harrowing account of agony surfaced into the mainstream of American entertainment-- &quot;Apocalypse Now,&quot;a disturbing narrative of a United States Army Captain (Capt. Willard, played by Martin Sheen)enmeshed in a web of politics and a superego battle of his ethics.  In a nutshell, Sheen portrays Capt. Willard, an aloof and taciturn man who, after having served and survived one &quot;tour&quot; of duty, is called back to serve another &quot;tour&quot; and is now assigned the task of executing a fellow U.S. Army officer (Captain Kurtz, played by Marlon Brando) who in essence, has become the &quot;Benedict Arnold&quot; of the regiment.  Unwillingly, Willard accepts the assignment from his superior officers, with the instructions to execute Kurtz.  Thus, left with no open options, Willard accepts the assignment, and embarks on a journey to locate and enact the order administered to him.  It was during the course of his travel down the river with his fellow crewmates that the viewer is able to witness the issues of morality and the agonizing dilemma of humanity which must have echoed like a broken record through not only the minds of the actors, but through the minds and souls of the soldiers who served.  The fear of death permeated each soul, as was seen via the vacuous expressions on each man's face asthey absorbed the images of death before them.<br />But, survival was key in the jungles and rice paddies in which these men fought, and the toss-up was often between being killed or killing the enemy.  Not surprisingly, the ethics and morals of soldiers were often lacerated when many realized that killing was the best option toward survival.  Furthermore, a second interesting fact was the portrayal of race issues, notably between the blacks and whites.  Although racial tension was robust both abroad and on the home front, it was fascinating to realize that despite the color of the soliders' skins, all were congregating to battle one enemy-- the Viet Cong. <br />Finally, it was touching to see the desperate longing for home which these soliders craved-- the need for laughter, good times, and most important, for the relatively solaced life which many once possessed, but which were stripped bare by the onset of the war.  Nowhere in the film can this be best portrayed than the scene in which American showgirls were transported to the military base complemented by the rock and roll music of that time.  Perhaps Willard expressed the emotions best when he stated, &quot;...I wish he hadn't done that,really.  It made us miss home even more.&quot;  One final note:  the breathtaking cinematographic effects lended a realistic portrayal of the war and presented an irony-- in the lush, placid greeness of the jungles and paddies, a war raged on mercilessly, which claimed the lives of countless young souls.  Another irony lies in the very title of this film-- an &quot;apocalypse&quot; as defined by Merriam-Webster Dictionary, &quot;an act in which evil forces are destroyed&quot;-- a rightful name for the Vietnam dissension, for in the eyes of the United States, the Viet Cong were the &quot;evil forces.&quot;  Truly, Francis Ford Coppolla's exceptional masterpiece deserved the eight Academy nominations and the two the film won, for it exemplifies the inordinates of heaven and hell, and the dire consequences which occur when the fine line which divides the two is crossed.
B00004R9A4|4.0|Disney has at last released one of its Classics.I enjoyed this movie as a child at the moviehouse. And it took me a long time as an adult to locate the video....all be it with the video editors cuts !!. But this dvd version restores the complete movie. As with dvd , the photography is truly excellent. And the sound track with the restored songs just great.The Portobello Rd scene sticks out in this respect. A movie I look forward to sitting down with my Kids to watch
0446364495|5.0|In Bridges of Madison County and woman named, Francesca, falls in love for a photographer named, Robert. When this occurs her husband,Richard, is away with their children. She finds a new part of her and enjoys herself for four days. When Robert tells her he's leaving she has to make a choice if she will go with him. She decides to stay with her family and hold her love inside.  I have read a lot of books about love but this one really gets to you. Bridges of Madison County has a aspect of love that most other book s never deal with. This is where one of the partners that has fallen in love is already in a relationship. Here Francesca is married, and Robert is dedicated to his work of photography. I loved it because some books that have this certain situation, they usually let the other person they are involved with go. But not in this one, no, he leaves and she stays with her husband, Richard.  I loved it so much because it goes to show that even if you are married and committed there could be someone that you meet and fall in love with them. Even if it's not love you could become infatuated or obssessed with the thought of being with them. Everyone likes the feeling of being in a secure relationship and this book proves that not everything is guaranteed. Robert is a calm and cooly collected and I want to be like this character. It's the way that he talks so gently and forcefully that Franchesca just has to listen.Robert says there love is &quot;in a universe of ambiguity, this kind of certainty comes once.&quot;  I loved this book but it's not for everyone if you feel that your partner is cheating or if you always fear somone not being able to commit to you then this book will definitely make your fears grow. Or it could do the exact opposite and you could find that all your fears are not necessary. If you like general romance books you'll like the subtleness of this one.

B000002UAO|5.0|This record is fantastic. It has a mix of the loveable, cute, mop-topped Beatles and the moustached, drugged, extremely shaggy haired Beatles. It starts out with \\"Drive My Car\\", \\"Norwegian Wood\\", \\"You Won't See Me\\", \\"Nowhere Man\\", \\"Think for Yourself\\", \\"The Word\\", and \\"Michelle\\". It ends with \\"What Goes On\\" with Ringo singing, \\"Girl\\", \\"I'm Looking Through You\\", \\"In My Life\\", \\"Wait\\", \\"If I Needed Someone\\", and finishes with.....(drumroll) \\"Run For Your Life\\". Most of the Beatles' cds have pictures in the cover jackets and this one eight :two of each Beatle. It also has a list of the songs on the album inside. It's a gear..er..fabmost cd and I would buy it again if I didn't already have two copies plus the original record....

B00003003R|5.0|I noticed a couple of comlpaints regaring this Gunners album, namely because sweet child was missing.  well here is my view, buy the australian version.  it includes an elctryfying version of sweet child, plus a version of patience which leaves a bit to be desired(the crowd singing ruins what otherwise sounds like a good version) i agree with the view heavens door sounds a bit dull.  and i am no expert on guitar, but heavens door is not really a complex piece of music, so in defence of slash, there is not much you can do with a song which has very little depth. i am a die hard fan, so this view is probably a bit biased END RANT
B00005BJ2O|5.0|I have looked forward to this soundtrack ever since the release of Something For Everybody, the collection of great songs from director Baz Luhrmann's various movies and operas.  It is just as eclectic - Baz mixes different sounds and styles into a seamless whole.  Somehow these different kinds of songs - love ballads, duets, incredible dance songs and a haunting cover of &quot;Diamond Dogs&quot; by Beck - all belong together.  Ewan has a beautiful singing voice.  His cover of &quot;Your Song&quot; may actually be an improvement on the original.  &quot;Lady Marmalade&quot; is a killer track.  The more I listen to this the more I like it.  A magnificent combination of great songs, musical theater storytelling and a techno-pop style.
6305131090|5.0|Film auteur Ken Russell made at least six biographical movies about celebrated composers, three of which enjoyed commercial release in the United States: \\"The Music Lovers,\\" about Tchaikovsky; \\"Mahler,\\" about its titular subject; and \\"Lisztomania,\\" really about Wagner as much as it was about Liszt. Unseen in commercial release in North America (and unseen by me) are studies of Frederick Delius, Sir Arnold Bax, and Bela Bart&oacute;k. Known for his extravagance - and, let us be honest, his vulgarity - Russell nevertheless believes passionately in these projects and endows his composer-artists with an especially powerful aura. (At one point, in the late 1960s, Russell apparently tried to help in the promotion of Lyrita's release of symphonies by Bax, although his plan was eventually scuttled by Lyrita's management.) The Tchaikovsky, Liszt, and Mahler films are all studies in the link between neurosis and creativity and portray the artist not merely as a social outcast, unfit really for society, but as a martyr to his own talent, which inevitably consumes him. \\"Mahler\\" (1974), as fantastic as portions of it might be, maintains the closest marriage with reality. Robert Powell (famously Jesus in Zeffirelli's film of that name) as Mahler represents perfect casting. For one thing, he looks the part. British beauty Georgina Hale (where is she twenty-five years later?) is alternately innocent and whorish as Alma Schindler, who, twenty years younger, became Mahler's wife only to betray him, as Mahler perhaps betrayed her, too. There is enough neurosis in their story to go around. Russell gives us not so much a straight narrative as a series of vignettes in flashback from Mahler's point of view as he returns by train to Vienna for the last time in 1911, the year of his death. Using Bernard Haitink's recordings of the Mahler symphonies (with the Concertgebouw Orchestra), Russell illustrates the music in the visual fantasies or episodes that make up the film. Examples? To the apocalyptic \\"organ chord\\" from the First Movement of the Tenth Symphony, we see Mahler's lakeside hut at Maiernegg burst into flames; then a cocooned female figure gradually emerges from her chrysalis in a weird ballet. To the death-march on \\"Fr&egrave;re Jacques\\" from the First Symphony, with its interruptions by an oompah-ing klezmer band, we see Mahler watching his own funeral and interment helplessly, his coffin carried by black-uniformed SS men while Alma, in matching SS miniskirt and jackboots, does a lewd dance on the grave. In a crucifixion scene accompanied by bleeding chunks from Wagner's \\"Ring,\\" Cosima Wagner, the Mistress of Bayreuth,gives him a pass for being circumcised, then compels him to eat pork, thus licensing him to conduct the most Teutonic of Teutonic music. (This follows the announcement of the composer's conversion to Catholicism - as I said, nothing is too vulgar for Russell.) For the \\"Veni, Creator Spiritus\\" from the Eighth Symphony, Russell gives us a cinematic suite of Gustave Dor&eacute; engravings based on Dante's \\"Paradiso.\\" And so it goes. At one point, a reporter claiming to be \\"Ernst Krenek\\" bursts into Mahler's Pullman compartment. (The real Ernst Krenek would have been about three years old at the time.) What holds the sequence together is the music in combination with Powell's remarkable performance. He even convinces when he undertakes the thankless job of conducting an unseen (and of course nonexistent) orchestra for the camera. (We all do it, but none of us wants to be photographed while doing it.) While room remains for as less surreal treatment of Mahler, Russell's, despite its eccentricity, is still a worthy attempt. Aficionados of Mahler will especially want to have it. I recommend it with the cautions implicit in what has gone before.ic \\"organ chord\\" from the First Movement of the Tenth Symphony, we see Mahler's lakeside hut at Maiernegg burst into flames; then a cocooned female figure gradually emerges from her chrysalis in a weird ballet.
