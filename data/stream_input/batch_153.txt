B0000AXY62|5|I use the Master Lock to secure my Allen Bike rack to my Jeep Wrangler. It does the job. I like the covering that protects the lock mechanism. I would highly recommend this Lock to others
B000BZJ5NC|3|Poor fit for my '05 Dodge Magnum RT:<br />1.  Lengths seem different from the factory wires, not sure because I trusted the manufacturer and didn't measure each original wire before removing it (dirty hands discourage this).<br />2.  Really needs a diagram showing which lengths go where.  There are routing diagrams online, don't see wire lengths posted.<br /><br />In hindsight (always 20:20) I wish I'd measured the new wires before installation and each of the old wires after removing them (recording it with the cylinder number).
B009ZMX1ZK|1|Lasted about six months and then my car began to misfire again. Replaced this with an OEM one and it's been fine ever since. The connection fittings on this model came warped/ bent.
B007Y5CMDW|5|I wish I'd bought one years ago. Perfect fit - stays put - easy to install and remove. Gives me confidence that I'll avoid the cracking dash syndrome that afflicts most classic Saab 900s.
B000BODTZI|5|great thing to have. nice easy no water needed does a GREAT job
B000C1HNSE|5|Works perfectly on my 2003 Mitsubishi Eclipse Spyder.  Seems good quality and a perfect match at a great price.
B00BYH6C1E|5|very happy with this product!
B000F09CEA|5|This is a great product for freeing up frozen bolts, I soaked overnight and the next day they broke free.
B00V4J91HE|3|:)
B006C1NTEU|5|Installed this a year ago. Still good.
B002BJNFZA|5|This is a very nice boot. It took no time to break in. Very flexable when received. I'm  a little disappointed that the tongue and laces are not attached to the sides when the zippers are down. I never saw a pix with the zippers open and the piece with the laces attached. now I know why.  Still a very nice boot. update.......After 4 yrs of riding and using as work boots, they have held up great. they are showing wear under the big toe and its going to be $55 to resole, so I'm just ordering a new pair and using these for summer time. I had to get new insoles but what would you expect after 4 yrs. of use.  upgrading rating to 5 stars
B00AVZPQJO|1|Doesn't fit 2010 honda civic lx dnt buy this
B008F472OK|5|Worked well, installed easy, shipped fast.  Color is off a little but that was expected.<br /><br />Definitely worth the price when comparing to what car dealers want.<br /><br />Thanks
B007NQMNUY|1|It does not fit around my roll bar, so I will have to find some use for it.
B000EQ1ZP4|1|Not worth the money, bought these for my IS300 hoping that they wouldn't warp as fast as the off the shelf pep boys rotors but they were just as bad and twice the cost. Won't buy again.
B0010E00T6|5|Fits my Acura perfectly.  The carbon layer is an improvement over simple filter paper.  Much cheaper than the factory filter.
B000FW62PA|5|I have a Toyota Matrix XRS with grey interior, and the wheel cover fits perfect, and matches the color scheme.  Would recommend.
B0002SQYTG|5|Just like the 925, an excellent tire gauge. Same problem with the kPA scale ink wearing off, but the PSI scale is still perfect.
B00BNDC182|5|well designed for the need of the vehicle, with the shopping and your organization in the car, for comfort and protection to carry shopping or other objects inside the vehicle.
B0095TC6I6|5|I used a pair of these for several years and found them to be very stable.  Perhaps those with vibration problems had factory mirrors with a flimsy outer case that allowed them to vibrate.
B00MRSNH9E|5|Ty great product!
B005ET4D0K|5|Very happy with them.
B001GG2EWE|5|Great!
B002MEITG4|5|Had to make on slight modification to the gasket but it pretty much fit right on and works like a champ. Great service and delivery.
B003UM7B98|5|Very reliable jack! I have used it many times and it is definitely worth the extra money.
B00DOVXN88|5|I don't have the squeaking issue most seem to have, the only thing I see now is more brake dust but they DO make a big difference in stopping
B009D9HEJO|5|Looks good on my 2015 Camaro put them on the engine coil pack covers
B002SIR8RU|5|It's got a good weight and assembled easily...  It's the kind of thing you hope you never need, but it was handy to have it in with the emergency stuff in the car.  It was a bit windy out on the highway when I stopped to help someone with a flat, but it stayed in place and did the job right.  Keep the box for storage so plastic bits don't break off when in storage.
B000XQ5IO4|5|This tool has all you need to repair any fuel related leaks
B00029WYVW|5|K&N 99-5050 Filter Care Service Kit - Squeeze. cleans real good but the squeeze bottle is a little messy. I'm going to try the spray next time.
B005LQIT5Q|5|The wind shield works great, went one fairly easy. Honda Yamaha Suzuki Kawasaki Harley bike cruiser motorcycle blocks wind, bugs, rocks
B00EE259BA|5|Nice product, the time delivery is magnific.
B00200BDR2|5|I love the McGard system.  They lock the rim, tool does not jam.  A++ This is my second car to fit with them.  These when on a 2013 Ford Flex.
B000EGL6GC|5|I bought this for my 79 Bronco and it is the closest thing I've found to that old school deep down to your soul v8 sound. I had one put on my 2004 Dodge 2500 HEMI as well and it made the truck sound like an old muscle car. I think the Vortex has a much better sound and quality to the flow master, everyone buys those and I like to be different. Even the guys on 4x4 extreme and Stacy Davids Gears uses them and I thought it was just a gimmick but they really do sound like the muscle cars I grew up with in the late 60's and 70's. I will be using these from now on....
B00IKPEUPI|5|Worked exactly as intended for 2002 Tacoma.
B003RF8VEC|5|The best seat I've come across. Just no substitute. Beautiful for long rides - and love the simplicity of it all.
B005JV8822|5|I love it
B0068N79YI|5|Very good and easy to install! They are well made and work great.  They look as good as tge original crome ones.
B00A8NPMX4|5|Perfect fit and great price. Plus it looks good. I got it because it's very similar in shape to the stock knob. My only negative is that the stock knob actually weights more. But not by much.
B0049GJIR2|5|Fits like it should.
B00067BYCU|1|These wiper blades are excellent at cleaning the glass. They leave a silicon coating behind that allows the rain to sheet off at high speeds. The coating doesn't work as well as rain-x. Rain-x starts sheeting around 45-50mph, the piaa wipers coating not until 60+mph. However, any time you need to use your wipers they leave a white streak across the windshield that doesn't disappear for a second or two. At night, the streaking catches all surrounding light and is blinding. It's like someone flashing their bright lights at you every time the wipers go across the windshield. The silicon residue is a great idea in theory, but in practice they are the WORST WIPERS EVER! They're DANGEROUS!
B00AKYOOYY|5|real genuine stuff
B00N396SHE|5|Awesome upgrade to my truck. It really unleashes the low end torque!
B00FEBNIZO|5|Bought this for my brother. He loved it. It looks amazing on his cadillac. It was delivered very fast. This is a must have.
B00KV15JVI|5|Material and workmanship were first quality, much better than the original vinyl armrests. Unfortunately, this is not a job that most people can handle themselves. It requires removing the interior door panel and the armrests came with minimal instructions. I took my Honda CRV to a body shop. Our local Honda dealer did not want the job.
B001B9SL50|5|Easy transaction and timely receipt and exactly what I needed.  You just have to make sure of the model numbers...
B000BGHYP2|4|great toilet - five star if it had a slow closing lid
B000CP86ZE|2|The product is well designed and of good quality but they did not fit my Altima so I returned them.
B0080JEPCW|5|Look good n fit my 2002 harley sportster
B00JKAU48Y|5|So happy to have a new Key fob
B003S02HOQ|5|Goal Zero strike again.... Hit it out of the ball park with this. only down side is you need to have a battery to charge then charge your Phone, etc. Bought 2 of these and they charged my Sherpa 50 in 2.5 hours.... Great for the great out doors...
B0026SUKEU|5|good quality arrived on time
B005LLSMJY|4|Works as promised!
B00480FIEG|5|ive tried all of sylvanias bulbs and they just don't last and these Phillips are brighter and last longer already they are great!!!!
B00HOTKASC|3|The handle fit and works well; however, it was not white, as the picture shows, but black.
B0033XXXG4|5|Absolutely first class product. I had very little problem installing the new legs. After reading reviews I was worried it would be difficult, Mine went in effortlessly, it took me more time wiring the new switches than installing the new legs. The independent control is a great improvement over the single motor running both legs. My only suggestion would be for them to include a plate to mount the switches to. I had to stop in the middle and go buy a mounting plate I used a plastic &#34;no smoking&#34; sign form my local hardware shop turned over to the solid white side.What an overall improvement to my fifth wheel.
B00PQWN5DQ|5|&#34;Wonderful...sturdy product. Works as advertised and much more accurate that the old stick kind. I like the rubber &#34;armor&#34; that protects the unit if dropped. Arrived exactly on the date advertised. The folks at JACO even follow up with a personal email to make sure all is well.  Thanks to all.&#34;
B00O2C4ILO|5|This set of lights give my truck a very nice look, it's amazing how big is the diference after I instaled them to my truck, those people are amazing with the services that the provide to us in amazon
B0013GHAV2|4|Items arrived quickly. Love the steering wheel cover but it could be a little wider to cover steering wheel better thats why I only gave 4 stars. Seems to be of good quality though but it did have a slight odor upon opening package. I just left windows open to air out and in the morning there was no more odor. Not to crazy about seat straps could have done without them but still cute.
B00CRR5L8U|5|Worked perfect, pleased, with price too.....
B005UB7AGG|5|Great brakes you can't go wrong<br />2008 F150
B0002HRBSU|5|Works as intended
B0014FGS60|5|I installed this on my 2012 Wrangler Sport this morning and it went on pretty well.  I reviewed some video instructions from other manufacturers and there is some good information out there on how to drop the muffler (which I had to do for my Jeep).  Dropping the muffler was the hardest part of the job for me.  My Jeep only had straight through holes on the chassis for two of the bolts, the other two had built in nuts that the bolts had to pass through which made it a little trickier.  Take your time and don't tighten up any of the bolts until you have all of them going in well.
B00062Z0DO|5|I can tell a big difference in the response of motor since installing on 99 jeep wrangler
B000IETTSC|4|Very happy with product for my car, fit and finish good and keeps out rain while driving with windows cracked open a bit
B00IVVIDVI|5|Fast shipping and very pleased with product
B004HLWPO2|5|Great product, easy to install and delivery was exceptional.
B000USQV5K|5|Perfect replacement DRL for a 2004 Tahoe. Dealer charges 10 bucks PER bulb. Sweet deal!
B00EC8Y25A|2|Not bright enough
B00OFQCJGS|5|They work and look great
B000FJ1OTM|5|Great pump.fit my 98 honda accord and pump works like OEM.
B001O01CZC|4|Worked great
B00FDX2MI2|5|Worked Great for my 2014 Jeep Grand Cherokee
B005J93ZQS|5|Great product, great price!
B0050CQP20|3|it works a little, you have to clean it with stronger energy by hand.
B00A1A6PT4|5|When I replaced the water pump on my 2005 Buick Lacrosse, these were one of the suggested items. I am glad I replaced them. My old plastic ones were so brittle that they fell apart when taking them out. Skip the plastic ones and use these.
B000BR1Q5A|5|K&N, I put them in everything, they work and live the life of the vehicle
B001PVQUWA|5|These new vent shades look and function great on my Honda Pilot.  The fit was perfect and the installation was quick and painless.  I simply followed the enclosed instructions.  Prior to ordering I researched this product on the Internet and came across an installation video on YouTube.  The video shows how really easy these shades are to install.  I bet I had them installed with 10 minutes.  I could not be more pleased.
B001O0CLPW|2|defective. NOT Working properly
B002UC15QY|5|Works great and also looks great.  Great poduct for the cost. If your looking for a dropin camper stove this one is worth it.
B00E35TDCY|5|Exactly as advertised.  These rubber emblems look great and feel durable.
B000K8GKS8|5|The plate is vivid in color and striking, good qaulity, study....VERY pleased with my purchase. I would recommend it highly.
B001AY2WKQ|3|This is a fun idea, but its made really cheap.  It didn't even last 6 months before breaking.  Oh well.
B001O7I20I|3|Works good at keeping stuff organized.  It's made of a decent rubber/foam type of material.  Doesn't feel cheap, but soft enough to protect the phone.  Doesn't work too well with the iPhone's charging cord though (I'd assume this for any  any phone with a bottom connector).  If you feed the charge cord through the bottom it's tough to get the right length of slack to make it convenient to use.  To keep it long enough to be able to answer the phone while it's still plugged in, there is no where for the extra slack to go other than loosely hanging out.<br /><br />Even if you keep the cord short to keep it tidy, you still have to leave some slack in order to plug/unplug it.  When setting the phone in the slots, the wire bundles up and keeps the phone from sitting nicely.  If you accidentally forget that the phone is plugged in and try picking it up, you'll end up pulling the entire holder up and dumping everything else in it.<br />My solution to this is instead of feeding the wire through the bottom, I usually just end up sticking the phone in upside down with the connector sticking out.
B000TYOS3C|5|Ours just recently broke and fell off, we ordered this and it worked great!
B001EOV46K|5|product as described with prompt delivery
B000PTKONY|5|I own 2 m/c's and two scooters... tire changes were cuttin' in on my likker money... needed for football game party'in (?)  So the whole thing just made too much sense... good product!
B0079DGP64|5|Exactly what I wanted. All parts were there. Easy too install. You need special bit for screws, star shape.
B005I60VZK|5|At a fraction of the cost that the dealership will charge you. I took it to a local locksmith and the programming was done in less than 5 minutes. Get that done without dropping off your vehicle at a dealership and leaving it all day.
B0031I1ZJ8|4|Cover fit over my wheeler nicely, so doesn't blow around.  Just got it, so don't know how it will hold up, but still looks good.  Only complaint isisn't isn't completely waterproof, but close.
B001DKTG0G|4|My 2001 Ranger with 160K miles shifted smoother after replacing the factory fill ATF. But get an actual pump,  just squeezing the bottle to get the oil in the gearbox was a PAIN.
B00DG0EIZY|5|This was my 1st helmet and I wasn't sure what size to buy. I'm an adult female 5'5&#34; and my head circumference measured at the widest point is 21&#34;. I got the small and it fits perfectly. I couldn't tell by the picture what type of finish it had but it is a glossy finish. The visor goes up and down manually with 3 clicks to hold different positions and I believe it is removable by unscrewing the silver circular knobs on the sides. I haven't removed it but the knobs do twist to loosen. There is a zip-on cushioned neck piece at the bottom that I have left on every time I've used it this summer and it doesn't make it seem hot to wear it. Some people have complained about not having a tinted visor for sun but it wouldn't make sense unless you will only be riding while it's sunny...If the sun goes down while you're out you will have to ride with the visor up and therefore no eye protection or stop and change out the visor. To me wearing sunglasses just makes more sense since I wear them when it's sunny anyway. I wear very large sunglasses and they fit just fine with the visor down. This is a very stylish looking helmet for a female and you can't beat the price!
B000C33LRY|5|Product fits and works.  Glad I purchased Beck Arnley 039-6428 PCV Valve Grommet as well.  It was impossible to remove old PCV valve without breaking old grommet.  If grommet breaks and falls into valve cover, do not worry - broken part falls into a box inside top of valve cover and does not fall into engine.
B00CKZM5T2|5|YOU WILL NOT FIND A BETTER DEAL OR BETTER PRICE ON THIS RUG. GOING TO ORDER MORE FOR GIFTS. THANKS
B00FTB06XQ|4|Works good, easy to install excellent service got on time. Deffinetly recommend it.  Will purchase more in the future. Very satisfied.
B000I04Z7Q|5|Coming from someone who knows next to nothing about cars.. This kit was very easy to install. Be sure to get zip ties to hide the wires. They are not included. Other than that, well worth the money!
B0000AXRH5|2|You get what you pay for, very cheap quality. It funnels well though...if that's what you're into
B002ZBWKAU|3|This is good to have item while traveling. Compared the tire pressures using this inflator with the commercially available in gas stations and they both showed the same pressures. I'm not able to preset the tire pressure, didn't work for me. I would recommend this item because now I dont have to worry about the time and place where I need to check and inflate the tire pressures.
B000JFJM14|5|Works great for changing the oil in my jet skis, way better than the cheap HF model I first bought.
B009U2P838|5|Nice addition to bike
B000GZO8SE|5|Worked great
B000C55MN8|5|Just installed, but seems like it will do the job.
B004OXJ56O|5|The little Super Beetle had a flat spot on acceleration and no carburetor adjustments would do the trick.....this distributor along with the Flame Thrower coil did the trick.  I'm a very happy customer.
B0006HLEQQ|5|No doubt this will endure. But get the right size.  That is key. otherwise, it is hard to put on and wont fit snuggly.  This is 2.0 in diameter. If you need 2 1/4, get that. dont get this.
B00514CCHE|5|Fit great
B00KRQOT5E|5|Arrived before it was scheduled. It's beautiful and I'm stoked.
B000H8XK4S|5|I was rear ended by a hit and run driver. The only damage was a busted tail light. Didn't want to go thorough my insurance or pay the high prices at the autobody shop so I did it myself. Can't beat the price....fit perfectly....only took minutes to replace....plus it came with new bulbs!! I'm so happy I found this part on Amazon... Saved me hundreds!!
B003L2ZVRG|5|We have been trying to find a good conditioner for our leather furniture.  WE HAVE FOUND IT!!!  This Leather Honey is the best ever!  Very easy to put on and polish up if need be.  We will buy more for future use.
B000F6DNMQ|5|great
B0045G6KFO|2|I used these for the first time this morning in 40 degree weather.  After one mile I could feel my fingertips getting cold.  By the time I made it to work (7 miles) my fingertips were almost frozen.  The rest of my hands stayed warm but I don't need the back of my hand to work the controls.  The gloves are also pretty bulky, but I expected that given the price point.  I will be ordering something else today.
B004J3AGG2|5|Easy to install if you can get your u-bolts off easily.  I'd recommend soaking with PB blaster a good time before if your truck has been around for a while.  Gave a the truck a mildly stiffer ride but I think makes it handle better especially with any type of load in the back.  I had to trim one of the adjust bolts on the rear so it would rub on my tail pipe.  I think it raised the rear of my 1997 K1500 about an inch when not loaded.
B001RLKX0S|4|I have my Jeep set up nicely.  Outside cage, rock side rails, winch, front recovery bumper.  These added a nice accent to the rear.  Very sturdy.  Easy to install.  They are holding up great.
B00A29M44O|5|Exactly replacement as the original one when I bought my travel trailer
B00MXGRMFK|5|I love these, I am 4 foot 11 inchs and and had a tough time getting into my Toyota 4 Runner.  My husband  had purchased these for his pick up truck (so I could get into it) and so we bought the same ones for my 4 Runner.  They do collect a bit of mud since we live on a gravel road, but so it goes.  The product itself is just fine.
B004QQPTQY|5|Quick Delivery as always. Quality product.
B000YPMA54|5|I have vast knowledge and experience with HID lighting systems. Majority of products made in China/Taiwan are usually inferior in quality. I came across Maxlux and seen it is made in Korea. Quality products are manufactured in Korea and the Maxlux Hid system is no exception. This kit is superior in every way to any other kit I have come across!
B00JWVROHU|5|He absolutely loves it. It has typical material used for a bell and is very sturdy. Would buy again for him.
B00C6B54FW|5|Good
B005PJJ89U|4|This tire guage is pricey compared with alternative gauges. I bought it because the previous reviews indicated that it was able to obtain a valid pressure reading on he first attempt. I have other digital pressure gauges that requie repeated attempts before a valid reading is obtained. Very frustrating and counter productive since you are actually bleeding  air out of the tire.<br />This tire guage gets an accurate reading 80% of the time. The apparent reason is that the gauge head is made of metal and more accurately machined that the plastic alternatives. This guage is impressive.It is worh every penny I spent.<br />By the way the programmable feature is of no interest to me.
B009S30W9O|5|Good
B00OTTJX42|5|True spirit of my Toyota Thundra, looks great
B0079RP0IY|5|Works as expected, have used this brand for years
B0018GP7SU|5|Very very loud even louder than the flaw master 10 that I use to have.
B000COAYE6|1|Add said ceramic header , shows a picture of a ceramic header, but recieved a black header with no collector flanges. I was VERY dissapointed when I opened the box. I could hav bought these black headers from the local speed shop for the same price maybe cheaper.
B00757KJTI|4|It is a stubby, so you do lose a bit of range in mountainous areas but I expected that. I was going mainly for the look, because I hate those 31-inch antennae that come standard on trucks these days. I does what I expected it to do; stay out of my peripheral vision when I'm driving.
B001RNOHBC|5|I still have my 23 channel Cobra CB radio from 1976 , and it still works.  It was an obvious choice to by a Cobra inverter and I have not been let down.  Works perfect, charges the computer, phone, etc.  We had bad weather recently and lost power at home.  I played on the computer while my wife read on her Kindle.  The batteries were going down so we got out and drove around for a while charging the \\"toys\\" back up. It was great to be able to use this for just down time but now I know if we had a true emergency the unit would be ready and able.  A great product, may need to get one for the wife to keep in her vehicle too.  Also, ordered one day with standard shipping and got it TWO days later.  I should really join Prime, Amazon has been so great with the products we have bought, so far I have never had a problem.
B00B8QFGFY|1|Part of the matrix was not working. It would not perform all of the functions as described. The colors were not brilliant. This was a fluke and this particular unit was defective. Amazon allowed me to return the product and get a refund in the form of a credit. Oracle products seems to be of a high quality. Make sure you test all of the functions immediate upon arrival and before final installation on your vehicle.
B00UVYPU14|5|Great!
B00RGZWIW0|5|Great product. It has a sturdy bottom panel and collapses flat easily.
B000CACMMM|4|It works great. It is stiff as other reviews have commented on. But it definitely keeps everything dry. It rained while in use and everything was dry at the end.
B00PARUEUY|5|Great item. Fits perfectly. Super fast shipping.
B0012TUSLE|5|I needed a Face Mask that would keep my ears and face warm during cold mornings when I would occasionally ride in a vehicle without a top.  This did the trick.
B008FRFC8U|2|Lights are very weak.  Provides minimal requirement for a caution light but no added illumination for nighttime or plowing situations.
B00407V5V2|2|I followed the instructions shaking for over a minute and held 12 inches away and it drips. Yuk it just doesn't work right. I asked someone to help me who works with paint sprays and they confirmed it is the paint not me since they tried and it dripped with them too.
B000W0RQ8C|4|I bought this to prevent my US Army receiver cover from growing feet and walking.  This is a well made lock, and easy to use.  The waterproof cover seems to fall off a lot when unlocking, but I never lost it.
B0080CDDO0|5|Exactly like factory fit my 2013 VW Passat Wolfsburg edition perfectly
B003V5MOZK|5|This is a great product which makes cleaning yoru rims much easier!  It also cleans your calipers and hard to clean nooks and crannys.
B0090UN116|4|great product!! lights are very bright and does turn some heads...i woulda gave it 5 stars however the instructions are no help at all and i cannot change color in sound activation mode
B00026Z3DQ|5|These jack stands are awesome!  I own a Chevrolet Avalanche Z71 and I can fit most standard jack stands underneath the frame without even jacking up the truck, so I needed jack stands that give me the high lift ability while still remaining stable.  The lift range on these jack stands is great, and the build quality is very high.  I have complete confidence in these jack stands while working beneath the truck.  Similar jack stands are well over $75.  The additional safety lock is a great feature, especially if you have to work near the jack stand.  It is a simple metal bar that slides in between the lift teeth, preventing the neck from lowering.
B00AZOHJDW|5|Try buying some at your local parts store. Carry lots of money, they like them a lot. These are worth buying in just in case.
B0066SIH4G|5|I installed these mirrors on my Triumph TR3B vintage racer and they have been through 2 seasons of racing and work fine. I have them mounted on each side of the scuttle and the view behind with the convex lens is adequate for racing purposes. Easy to adjust and they stay put.
B005HWW6LW|5|Perfect
B005VWYVCA|5|Good part, no issues on install.
B00KGGTF9U|5|This an excellent sunshade and I love that it keeps my front car seats from getting too hot. It really covers the sun during very sunny/hot days. I've been using this for a while now but since it's not as hot these days, I know that it will be perfect for the really warm days during the summer. It's a great quality sunshade and it's very easy to fold back into it's smaller shape to save space. I would definitely recommend this. I was given this product in exchange for an honest review.
B001NVJF7O|4|If you are an aviator fan, this is a cool nod to the field. I put my motorcycle keys on this key chain and always get asked what its for. Made very well and looks great.
B000JFHNQA|5|Awesome product. So glad I bought this.
B000CJ009K|3|Not pre-drilled for 2003 Dodge 1500.  Had to make custom holes.
B0042VTYXM|3|I've not tested it, but the 3 star review is to raise a QC issue.<br />I bought visor clips for my 2 ResQMes, and discovered that the width of the barrel varies enough that one of them wll fit snugly, and the other falls out of the clip! Swapping them made no difference. So whilst these presumably function as advertised, don't bother with the accessories.
B002ULMW62|5|These lights are great.  got them for my car a three weeks ago (figured id wait) and theyve been everything i thought.    they really fit on easy on my chevy equinox, (same size bulbs as the Impala as well as several other chevy models).     The light these give off is much brighter and wider than the stock license plate bulbs. Also the blueish hue to them really adds some flash to the back of your car while driving at night. ive gotten numerous compliments.     great all around.       side-note:if your someone who like to avoid the police, dont get these. they INCREASE how well cars can see your plate #'s.
B000C9WLEC|5|I bought this filter for my Kubota L3130 and it fit perfectly.It was a great price and a high quality filter.
B00HT1JYG4|5|I bought these to replace the factory 3 point seat belts on  my 2011 Kawasaki Teryx sport.  I am 6 feet tall with a long torso while my girlfriend is 5 foot 2in. The factory belts were unsafe for shorter people,  the top part of the 3 point would cross the neck almost strangling her, they road on my collar bone so they were very uncomfortable. I purchased the cross bar for the roll cage so the top straps on the 4-point harness had something to attach to. These are excellent quality belts and were very easy to install, it took me 15 minutes per side to swap the factory belts out. The extra padding in the shoulders is very comfortable, the adjustment are simple to operate and adjust for many shapes and sizes. Now we ride in comfort! These are the perfect solution for the terrible design of 3-point harnesses.
B000C2WFA4|3|I bought this to turn off the &#34;check engine&#34; light on the dash of a 2001 Nissan Sentra (a common problem on this car). Price was right compared to the OEM cap from the local Nissan dealer. The new cap seemed to work at first (the light went off after a day or so when the computer reset itself), but when my wife got some gasoline (removed, then reinstalled the cap), the dash light came on again after a day. I then removed and reinstalled the cap by applying an inward force and rotating through many &#34;clicks&#34;. The dash light then went off again. So, after a couple more cycles like this, it appears that I must be the person that reinstalls the cap to get it to seal. It takes more effort than &#34;tighten past 3 clicks&#34; to get a seal. UPDATE: The &#34;check engine&#34; dash light came on a few days after my last cap install. My cheapest option now is to buy the OEM cap. Of course, we may have a different, intermittent problem also causing the dash light to come on.
B00A82EAGA|5|Works great
B00BG0P2U6|5|Very nice.
B000UHSA3C|1|30 day money back guarantee is a joke! Very cheap made product, camera not water proof and a poor picture. Would have rated it 0 if I could have.
B003U56R68|4|exact fit
B00NLNJZBS|4|work as describe!!
B009DJT0AK|4|Works well so far.
B001B0QBZ6|1|Good luck if you decide to purchase this lock!  No problem getting it on but almost impossible to get off. I struggled for 10 minutes before I was successful removing it. At one point I thought I would need to get a locksmith. I was finally able to remove it after exerting enough downward pressure while twisting the key. I was so frustrated that I immediately threw it in the garbage so I wouldn't be tempted to put it on again and risk not being able to remove it!
B008R8ZFCU|5|Love, love, love!! I wish I knew these existed like 5 years ago!! It has def made life much easier!
B00GSAUHB8|5|This is great. I have a black car with black leather seats that get so warm from the sun. This works perfect with my car and keeps it cool. Definitely recommend!
B001EOV42Y|5|three hours to install on my 2014 town and country.
B003EOZAT0|3|they just came in the mail today after 3 weeks of waiting i havent had a chance to install them so i dont know
B000LNUDZS|5|One of the best, if not the best leather conditioner ever...!!! Is it wierd if I admitted that I really love the smell of this prduct? :~<br /><br />I have been using it on my jackets, shoes, belts and bag without any issues.
B000OV7Z1M|5|worked great
B003UVCY00|4|Best bet for the money, use it on my boat for night fishing and can spot a lot of bouys and flags from a distance(30-40 yards maybe?)
B000AL8VD2|5|was glad to get this with my spark plugs
B000C55T7W|5|Perfect fit for my 2004 Buick Lesabre.  As one person mentioned mine had spring nuts on it.  Two of them snapped but luckily I had 4 nuts and lock washers sitting around that fit the factory bolts.  Everything fit perfectly on the factory air lines.  What a deal for a little over fifty bucks.  Easy install and better ride.
B000EALHH6|1|This product instantly removed oil from my concrete floor, but anywhere it splashed outside of that stain, it left an instant, deep orange rust mark. Now I have to find a way to remove the rust spots.
B0060OU2IU|5|at $1.99 this bulb is as good as it gets, bright and barely warm to touch after 10 minutes on.nice brilliant white color with slight blue tint, I'd say 5700-6000K,
B002PE95ZA|5|Makes up for the low quality diesel fuel to be had in my parts.  I just had a 2 degree F start and it fired right off (way better than just the local fuel with a bit of antigell).
B0053D9P8C|4|This shade is good.  It is thicker than most universal shades and in my opinion keeps the car cooler.  I also enjoy the edging material they use as it does not shed all over the dashboard.
B0038B23TY|5|Look great and look just right with the eagle eye headlights. Bulbs are easily seen so I would use silverstar bulbs or led I use led and they look great.
B00170L4Q6|2|This belt is longer than the worn belt it is replacing (too loose). It is an off-brand of Dayco called Drive-Rite.
B00CCE8FJU|5|Great bag, I got it for my GS1200, it is big and does hang over my tank.<br />I love the quick release its very easy to get the bag on and off the bike.
B0036E9VB6|5|excellent buy much better than previous models I have owned.
B00A3FMZNM|5|I gave this to my brother-in-law for Christmas and the weather has been too bad to install these.  They do look very strong and should work very well for his flat bed car hauler trailer.  We are installing them on the dovetail to get a better length on our tie-downs.  The factory installed tie downs were just too close to the cars we were hauling.
B005N734US|5|Cool and warm..
B003USWKH0|3|Fits well.  Smells awful.  Don't know what chemical they used on the leather but it makes my eyes water!  Brought it to cleaners and hopefully they can get the noxious smell/fumes out.  We'll see.
B0023VMRRI|4|Got lost in the mail the first time but I have it in now and it seems to be working great.
B001NQF3QQ|5|Terrific. Just what I was looking for. Great for the environment and my car!
B005VO5GRM|5|Perfect! Way cheaper than going through the dealer.
B00TA54WTQ|5|Installed these near the front of my motorhome and they work great
B005SY8LI6|4|Haven't had it too long, but so far , so good.....  Will be taking it down the River..... See how everyone likes it.
B000BZEDZ2|2|I specifically ordered the Bosch to make sure it was an OEM equivalent.  After 3 months, my 8-cylinder M-B started running on only 4 cylinders because the rotor continuity failed.  Even though the part is warranted for a year, I could find no way to return this defective part to Amazon because it wasn't within Amazon's standard 30-day window.
B002IX9RJM|5|Aquapel >>> RainX<br /><br />If there was an infinity symbol on my keyboard I would have used it... you'll wonder why they even still make RainX after using Aquapel.
B000S2SKIY|5|Could not pump gas fast. Would shut off the pump everytime. Replacing this allowed more air into the gas like it suppose too. I have a 2008 sierra crew cab
B00FBKUK22|1|I bought this for my Subaru Wrx 2006 and everything fit perfectly, they were working beautifully, for the first month or so i had them. The problems that i have been having is that the HIDs sometimes dont turn on at all, I understand that HIDs do have a tendency to cause this and the fix would be just to turn on and off your lights, however in my case it will turn on for my first trip, and on the trip back none of the lights will turn on. I have tried switching the ballasts and bulbs and none has been  of a fix. I've tried to contact support for a replacement however I have not found anywhere to do so.
B000EQB752|5|Looks exactly like the old set I took out, but cleaner.  The filters are behind the glove box on my 99 Accord and it took a bit of work to get them replaced.  This product is great with a great price.  What more could you want?
B004TO0SMS|5|I must say for $25.00 this was a great inexpensive way to upgrade the interior of my car. If you have a slick steering wheel the cover for this is thick and makes turning much easier. The shoulder straps are the best thick and plush, and overall it feels and looks great. Plus it gives you that new car smell haha. This is a must buy couldnt be more comfortable
B00B57RBV8|5|good stuff
B002JPA770|4|The shade fits well and definitely works better than the less expensive generic type.  The only thing I would caution is that you can not be in the car and remove it.  I did try and take it down while still in the car...quite humorous.  The first time I wrestled it I inadvertently changed the radio station.  The second time I tried it a bit differently and ended up turning on my windshield wipers and washing my windows.  On the up side my windows were dirty and needed to be washed.  You definitely need to be outside the vehicle to take the shield down.  Not a biggie but something to be aware of.  Other than that it is a great product.
B004W4O7Q8|2|I've had these spyder projector headlights installed since June 2012 and have already had to replace the right side low beam bulb 2x.  Great product but horrible durability so far - I would probably not purchase from Spyder again
B000GZKBT4|5|The ProTaper handlebar is a high quality product as we have all come to expect. I especially liked the measured markings that made installation easy to align.
B00B9HHT0M|5|Stick extremely well even without being actual vinyl, and have gone through numerous carwashes and a crappy winter and are holding up beautifully. The only issue I had was actually the size of a couple of them being too big, but that's really not the Worst thing that could happen lol
B00D7HNOSI|5|Really like these. They are super soft and seem to hold up. They seem a little big, but I'm very happy with them and ordered more.
B000GTOKYM|4|Out of the box the wrench seemed pretty good. I checked the wrench with a calibrated load cell to check the torque settings on the wrench.  All my settings were about 1-3 Ft-lbs low (checked it from 10-150 ft-lbs at 10ft-lb intervals), not bad for the cost of the wrench.  I think this will serve my purpose of light duty work on my personal vehicles with no complaints.  Note that at low torque ranges the click is not very audible so just pay close attention on low torque settings.
B0002JMS6I|5|Used this as a 02 sensor spacer, worked like a charm, had to use in conjunction with the Dorman Help 42009 Spark plug Non-Fouler
B004JKESLO|3|Perfect
B00E1SOVPW|5|The rotors are heavy weight and well made. The pads and rotors fit perfectly like OEM.  So far, the braking distance seems improving.  Can't beat the price!
B008RN2AL4|4|A good quality product fits great on my 07 1098
B00CS6YVA4|5|Great new starter that fits my UD361 and now cranks great.
B0045V1SHE|5|I was really impressed on the build quality for the price. I would easily buy these over the much more costly other brands. The tricos are now on my list for wipers in the future.
B00027GZU0|5|Installed this pump kit on Johnson 9.9. Parts are of good quality and exact fit.<br />If you need the wider boot that fits on top of the out port you may need to verify this kit comes with it as I just reused my existing one with no problems.
B00433SIQI|2|Watching the video makes this product look amazing. However, when I tried to use it there were a few problems. The applicator solution wasn't near as sudsy as the video made it out to be. I ended up having to add some dawn to get the suds to be able to manipulate the tint on the window. Also, the low lint cloth basically left white particles when you tried to wipe off the window. I ended up just using some microfiber paper towel type and the squidgy. Also, the box knife was very dull. Either dull or the tint was sheet metal. You probably can use a regular box knife, find a squidgy at the parts store, and get yourself some micro fiber paper towels and that will work just fine, probably much better than this product.
B00B2YHFO2|5|good
B0043YNNVC|5|Really well made with heavy gauge vinyl coated fabric that doesn't have the smooth texture and shine normally associated with vinyl. Heavy duty elastic really secures it on the tire and does not allow for movement once installed. Highly recommend and would buy again!
B00HETCEVS|5|Good stuff.....need not write anything more...service was good product was exactly as described...packaging was a bit poor but all in all it gets the job done
B00AP854EO|5|First of all, the delivery was ridiculously fast, which is great cause I was anxiously waiting for it to arrive! Secondly, the item is ten million times cuter in person. ( I hardly read the actual descriptions, so I look at their pictures & hope for the best) It fits my Hyundai Elantra perfectly! (I seriously love it) It is not hard to put on AT ALL. It literally took me under a minute. Based on previous reviews I was expecting I would have to tell my boyfriend to do it for me, but that wasn't the case! However, it does smell REALLY strong! Like penetrated melted plastic or something. But I'm assuming cause it's new & I'm sure it'll go away. Besides, I REALLY REALLY REALLLLLLY appreciated that the seller was aware of the odor & threw in a free car scent. They probably read other reviews complaining about the smell & actually did something about it by giving us a cute little car scent. (smells really good by the way)<br /><br />***I TOTALLY  RECOMMEND IT!!!! ****
B00J5NUHSS|5|Very nice pieces. using them on turbo application Have been looking for black, high quality clamps for some time. Highly recommend!
B003076AIG|5|I am a car guy and work on all my vehicles. This is by far the easiest and nicest trailer hitch harness I have ever installed by a mile. One Subaru was smart enough to pre-wire a connector with all the wiring needed to hook up a harness.  Pull the dead end cap which takes some effort off the Subaru harness plug this in and a few tie wraps and I bought the mounting kit as well and you have an OEM factory install.  Awesome product...
B005N6XIHS|1|The shirt came and looked used. It is too short as well pretty annoying
B0002YR83Q|5|Does a great job.
B00CMX20H4|5|Good Horn, nice sound and drivers hear it load and clear.
B002UPKEQ8|4|TL;DR its pretty good in a low-water, or drought environment. Not show quality but a hair better than a standard car wash mix.  My Car: White Subaru BRZ Used: 7 square Microfiber Clothes from Costco 20 fl. Oz of clean water (drinking or distilled which is recommended)   So, used a mixture of 1 part Chemical Guys, 16 parts clean leftover water. 1:16 - decent enough but almost as good as a simple wipe down with a wet rag. Ramping it up to 1:14 to 1:12 and that made a difference when it's thick dirt or been awhile. It's a little pricey considering the amount, and factoring in that you have to wash ALOT of microfiber clothes. Still better than a two bucket method for the environment.  Some tips: 1. Use clean almost drinkable water 2. Mix it around 1:15 minimum (for my use)  3. Use about 6-9 completely clean microfiber clothes. 4. Spray enough where it slightly beads but not completely. Start at the highest parts of your car. 5. Wait 30 seconds 6. Gentle but with some minor pressure to get dirt off. Wipe in on direction DO NOT SWIRL! 7. Wait 10 seconds or so. 8. SWIRL away, with light pressure to get the really dirty stuff off. 9. Repeat for same spot if it's still dirty or move on to the next panel.  Edited: Spelling and Clarity
B000O51VJ0|3|I purchased this after having previously already owning a Campfire in a Can. I was hoping it would be just as good at half the price. Unfortunately it didn't quite make it. It is a very nice unit and I was happy with the looks, set-up and flame. I especially liked the control valve and single-piece ceramic log set. However, the bottom does get hot since it is not insulated like the Campfire in a Can. I particularly value the no-clearance feature of the CIC - that allows me to use it on a picnic table, my plastic mat outside my trailer or on the bare fiberglass of my boat. It is a safety feature I just can't live without any more. The Little Red Campfire is just fine normally, but I can't stand the whistling at above the 60% setting either  All in all, a fine product, vastly improved from earlier models - just needs to be zero clearance rated for my uses.
B002OI5U3S|1|Sent me the wrong set Thanks guys.Was in a hurry,Started installing them until i got to back windows. Would you guess too short. Didnt double check whole set. My bad. Wrong set your bad.
B000WK1ZWA|5|Have used our Thetford 365 seasonally in our cabin for the last three summers and am totally pleased with the product. It works well and has held up well. No breakage, no significant problems. The large capacity means I only have to service once or twice per season. The large size makes it about the right height for comfortable use; many portables are so low to the ground that they are not comfortable to use. The rotating spout makes it easy to empty and clean out. Highly recommended.
B00DYOVXZ0|5|wow ... forget going and getting your car checked at a car shop or car parts store... now you can do it all on your own from your phone tablet or ipad.<br /><br />I downloaded several apps that to test which one works best with this and i found one finally.<br />for apple devices atleast its called OBD FUSION<br /><br />works awesome. real time readings and clears errors and checks the web for code meaning. you can even manage several cars in the app to be able to keep up with them all.<br /><br />perfect for even reading cars during test drives if you are in the market to buy a used one! thats actually why i got this.
B008VM0TLO|5|This is a perfect solution.  It doesn't look cheap (ok it isn't cheap).  The fit is great in my Buick.  I can see through it but it provides great shade for my son in the backseat.
B001CF4UWG|5|This is exactly what they call it, a recovery strap.  NOT A SNATCH STRAP, a tow strap.  The low reviews that call it junk for breaking on the first use almost always mention using it to jerk on a vehicle and that is not what it was meant to do,  However, I've put this strap through some torture using it in a manner it wasn't truly intended with a slight jerk to get mine and other vehicles out and it's held up great! Probably not the best strap on the market but I've got no complaints!
B00LNOUNUE|4|Good value for the money. It is a little loose and flappy at highway speed
B000OF7MMA|4|checking my electrical gauge to see if was accurate, found it was reading off a bit, so this helped me solve my question
B007X5KH5I|4|Easy to install. They slip a bit, but work. Good purchase for the price. Glad i got them. Arrived quickly
B00AV18NG6|4|A little thinner and a little less of what I thought I might get - probably my fault - but it's the wife's car and she says it works good and protects it well, and the main thing is she's happy! So, I'm happy too, I guess.
B0042Z6PBM|5|Thank goodness for this fuel pump. Instead of an expensive OEM part, this pump was easy to install and worked as advertised.  I am happy it  is still working and I saved over one hundred dollars.
B000EDOT9G|5|very nice
B00068XCQU|5|These little chargers are the greatest. If there is anything out there any better than this I am not aware of it. Highly recommend.
B0002SR4OA|5|Shipped promptly. Worked great! Helped me find the malfunction.
B001G7O048|5|This new filter fit perfectly and solved my power steering noises.  (The old filter looked more like a doughnut than a cylinder.)
B00ETON9QK|5|Very bright little lights and a great value.
B00B2YE4B4|4|These seem to be a lot brighter than my factory lights and the white light is a lot more appealing than the old dingy yellow look of OEM.
B0007RDVGG|5|Looks great and smells great as well!
B004GFS2C8|4|I had a chip patch before at a shop and it turned out well, so I figured I would try this at home kit on another one of my windows kit.  I found the direction easy to follow and was pretty confident it would work.  However, the final result wasn't as noticeable of a change as I expected. I do think it helped seal the chip though. Overall the product is a good value and I would give it another try. The only other qualm with the item is it's a one use application.
B001DAEF02|4|Seems to be a good quality product for the price.  Installed on my truck with no problems fit was perfect.  Would highly recommend.
B001P7C7QM|2|Way to loud and spits oils out
B0053ZKF9I|5|Very great decal. Makes me think of my visits to Bulgaria and how bad I wanna go back and live one day! This is a great way to show your love for a country or even start up a convo! Thanks so much
B000Q754E4|5|When travelling in the car we have been able to keep frozen food frozen for longer than 20 hours when we combine a few frozen freezer packs plus this amazing cooler even in hot above 100degree temps outside the car. The option to be able to connect it to a normal electrical outlet and keep the food frozen has allowed us to pay ourselves back ten times over the initial investment
B000JZZPOM|5|It fit on my 2002 honda civic ex perfectly. Its better than buying a universal converter and having to weld it on. Great product, fair price, compared to the price honda is charging for the same part.
B004306VTC|4|Worked great on my back patio.  Cuts the glare of the concrete and is nice on the tootsies. no carry case though.
B008Y3UZTG|5|It was exactly as I though it would be
B001KQWKLK|5|Good
B008FQ6URI|5|fit my 2003 mini cooper perfect
B00KV8U29U|5|Working Well So Far! I installed the pair about 2 weeks ago.
B005FYOHLY|2|Is cute. I love Marvin...and K9.. but doesn't fit my SUV.Smell dissipated in 2 days for me. Left it out in sun to see if it would stretch...
B000VKTULY|4|Cheap and Comparable with OEM.
B000VZ9CL2|5|Before I purchased this, I bought one similar by ACCU-GAUGE, which was crap...  This gauge is much better constructed with better parts and fittings, hoses, and even comes with 2 different tips for your pressure measuring pleasure.  And hey, it even glows in the dark!  It's as accurate as much more expensive gauges and you cannot go wrong.  It was also the same price as the \\"accu-gauge\\" crap.  Well done JOE!
B007ILG7V0|2|The detail is not very good. It looks like is was made from a copy of copy of a copy.
B007OSL3DY|4|I wanted a lock for the tail gate on my truck and thought this would do the trick.  I like the construction and the key feature, unfortunately is does not fit.
B003NHVEV6|5|worked perfect and easy to install.
B000CCM4ZK|3|I was worried it might leak, given that this is the style with the plunger rod through the lid. Sure enough, tip it a little, and it leaks. It went back.
B0040DXAWI|4|Fast delivery and good product. I would definitely recommend this. Only caution is this are closer than what you see in the mirror.
B00BYNJ7OW|4|Packaging was not great. Boxes came all beat up so hopefully nothing was damaged in shipment.<br />Great product though. I have heard great things about Bilstein...
B001R1Q62W|5|Excellent Lights. Bright, and beastly. However one disclaimer. They did an absolutely atrocious job sealing them. It'll cost you about 35 dollars in sealant to get the best effect out of these bad boys. I had these installed professionally and the finished result is better than I even expected; yet after reading some of the other reviews and a discussion with my body guy, i just want to emphasize on how horribly they're sealed. For the money I'm not complaining. Stock lights from a dealer could have been as much as 250 each, where these look better, and cost 1/4 of that. Its just necessary to take the extra step, and re-glue them before installation. Gluing Process should take about 8 extra hours (to dry) and than the standard 20 minutes or so to install them. Hope this helps. Good luck.
B00754T6TK|5|I bought this for my son's car.  Worked fine.
B005ZH10O8|5|i think all the wizards products work  this is easy to use with there other products especially there mist and shine
B000C2CG1W|5|Perfect fit even came coated with thread sealant.
B009D41M9C|5|Perfect replacement, beautifully finished chrome plated brass.<br />, they match my wheels perfectly and complete the total package.<br />Will buy more for when i<br />i will need for replacement because of theft of loss.<br />Excellent quality, threads are perfect and there are no sharp edges.
B000CO96SG|4|[...]  [...]  Your internal bushings are bad in the motor, an easy repair once you take out the grille from the front. Only two phillips screws between the top of the slats hold it in. Remove the screws and release the ends of the spring that tensions the bottom of the grille and the grille will slide down and out from the front. Unclip the retaining clips and pull them out. The plastic couplers will slide inward on the torsion bar and the headlight doors will swing free.  The motors use three nylon bushings. You can find these on line or in the HELP sections of parts stores. They're sold under Ford power window motor bushings.
B001FI02O0|3|I liked this product, before it started to rust in some spots. It was easy to install and looks great though.
B0002WSC0G|5|This kit is well stocked. There are even spare parts. The quality was very good. I am well pleased with it.
B0041CDPQO|5|I bought another battery tender that failed a month after purchase. This little guy has been my best buddy ever since. I've got it ziptied to the handlebars of my motorcycle and you can barely tell it's there. The cap has held up this long even though I keep my bike outside. Not a drip of rain will get inside. Overall, great product.
B004ZG7TT0|5|bought for the hubby, it's great!
B00CHCX1H8|5|Great device, really bright even in daylight. Many flash patterns too.
B008VPAPZG|5|Works just fine!
B004QC30CI|5|A perfect fit in a 2007 2.5, 6 speed tiptronic 09G transmission.  Looked just like the OEM parts.... at a fraction of dealer prices, whats not to love...!
B003FXKO64|1|Worst power inverter ever - bad modified sigh wave - will buzz and fry lights when it actually puts power out at all - will run about 70Volts if that ---<br />The cheep inverters from Harbor Freight are Much better ---
B002BFUREG|5|Fit my VW perfectly...
B00557QI0Y|5|This saved me nearly $300 from having to do a dealership repair.  I did this once before with a re-manufactured rear wiper motor on our 2005 Chevrolet Uplander purchased from a local NAPA store.  It was over $85 with the core charge.  Once I installed it I had to drive back to the store and give them the old part to get a refund of nearly $22.  This part (a few years later) is priced right (w/o core charge) and is ACDelco.  My complaint with the &#34;aftermarket&#34; part I used before was that the range of motion of the wiper seemed greater than 180 degrees, which caused it to surpass the bottom of the rear window partially.  I installed this ACDelco using a YouTube video ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iDz5uT4Tkhk ) and it went on great and operates within proper specifications.  It was really &#34;a piece of cake&#34; and I do not even consider myself a &#34;backyard mechanic&#34; at all.  The trickiest part of this was taking the inside plastic liftgate panel off and on (with the latter being the most challenging).  However, even that wasn't all that bad.  Definitely not a &#34;show-stopper&#34; when it comes to saving big bucks!  This is a &#34;can-do&#34; project for even the novice car repair person.
B000CDADO8|5|the wipers work great. I have been using them for about three months now and they do the job. No streaks and make the windshield completely clear. Putting them on was very easy. Of course they sat in my trunk until there was a lot of snow and rain and I wound up putting them on in the dark while it was snowing and raining, and still managed to do it in a matter of 5 minutes.
B00IFHV6U8|5|Great battery.  I've been using it for a few months now and it holds a charge and starts my bike every time.  No complaints, I'm very happy with it.
B00BXMRP4I|5|It does what it is supposed to do . It's not the best quality but it will get the job done. So far I have used it on two cars replacing AC compressors.  Already got my money worth it !
B008RHC880|5|Fits perfectly on my 2008 Hayabusa and the color match is spot on.  High quality and light weight.  You cannot go wrong for the $$.  5/5 stars!
B000CCMLEY|5|great
B000CMIW60|5|Fit as a stock replacement. Helped my steering shimmy from large pot holes.
B002YCEIRS|5|I have yet to install it (waiting for warmer weather), but the part arrived very quickly and appears to be a cheap fix for something I would have paid someone much more money to do.
B0066TL3J6|4|The U-joint fit perfectly. The only issue I have with it is that the included grease zerk is very difficult to install because of its intended location. I had to use a longer one to grease properly.
B0087NB6D2|5|I plugged my Sena into the USB port of the audio system in the back for power and then I plugged this cable into the passenger cable.  I drilled a small hole to run the wire behind the seat.  It works very well with no alternator whine.  I can receive the CB but cannot transmit so, I mounted the Honda mike from an old headset and cut the speakers off.  I plug the cable into the front to just the mike if I know I am going to talk over the CB.  My wife and I use Uclear bluetooth sets to communicate.  The only downside, I have not found a way to communicate over the Uclear and hear the CB at the same time.  I just use the External speakers on the bike if I need to do both, which is very rare.  It is not a perfect solution but I now ride without a cable attaching me to the bike 90% of the time.
B002MHDY2K|4|Love the bag can fit a week of clothes in it. The bottle holders are a plus. The rain cover works got caught in a heavy down pour and my stuff stayed perfectly dry.
B00547IVXM|5|My husband and I bought &#34;Find My Keys&#34; for my elderly mother who loses her keys once or twice a week. No exaggeration. True to form, my mom misplaced her keys almost immediately after receiving this product. She used &#34;Find My Keys&#34; and found her keys with ease. The product worked perfectly. Highly recommended.
B000COCMX2|4|work great stop a little better than the ome pads
B000BKC2D2|1|I too followed the directions exactly and the mirror fell off within 2 hours.  The weather was dry and in the 70's so nothing extreme or unusual about that.  The glass and metal button were meticulously cleaned with a razor and denatured alcohol prior to attempting this installation.  Since my old mirror was held on with some kind of plastic adhesive strip, I did not have and debris or residue to remove.  I just needed to make sure the two surfaces were cleaned from all microscopic traces of dirt, dust and oils.    As per the directions, you're supposed to wait 30 minutes before installing the mirror and I waited more than 90 minutes.  Then after the mirror was in place for a couple hours, it popped off after making a simple manually adjustment.    After it failed, I noticed that the adhesive stayed on the glass side and fully released from the metal button.  The adhesive also stayed very soft and could easily be scraped from the glass with my fingernail.  It just never hardened as I would have expected.
B0052SF0LO|5|Easy to install.  Only had it for a month so far... but works great.
B004EIAADG|5|If you think this is heavy - check the weight of your car battery.<br />Check out the size/weight of a full size charger/starter.<br />If you think it should jump start a faulty ignition system - get the system fixed.  It will jump a system in otherwise good condition (dead battery) just fine.<br />If you think it should substitute for a gas engine driven generator - check out the size and weight of a gas engine driven electrical generator.<br />If you think it should substitute for the air delivery volume of a compressed air pump with tank - check out the size and weight of even the smallest pancake tank pump.  You can top off the pressure of a car tire - you are not going to seat the bead on a flat tire.  The high volume side of the pump filled my queen size air mattress in 7 minutes.<br />My cables were 5 ft in length - enough that the unit could sit on the ground and reach the battery of my SUV.<br />Based on other reviews - take care of the plug terminals.<br />Based on other reviews - take care of the plastic clip handles.<br />A battery of this type should never be fully discharges.  Re-charge it after use.  Keep it charged.  The older it is - the less it will return from a fully discharged condition.  I'll repeat - a battery of this type should never by fully discharged - it should be kept fully charged.  It is for emergency use.<br />Your car alternator immediately starts re-charging your car when you start the car.  Keep this battery fully charged.<br />It does what it is supposed to do - it doesn't do what full size replacements are singularly designed to do.
B00HJ6RV3C|3|Be aware the the picture shows white but the product is grey.
B0031R9ADC|5|Responsible for store and very good quality products
B001HN849S|4|Perfect.
B000PA03AC|5|It worked perfectly on my MINI Cooper 2004. I just had to do a little reading and boom! the thing was in! now I listen to my iPod all the time!
B00GUD0Q9Q|4|Item was exactly as expected!  Easy install. Looks great. Shipping wasn't the best. Came freight which made it hard to be delivered to a residence. Product weighes less the 60 pounds could have come UPS for simplicity.
B005NLQAHS|5|LOVE IT! Listen, save your self the headache and time and just order this one! I ordered the cheapo ones on here and guess what? Diddnt work. Pony up the extra cash for this one. I have a 2003 Ford Focus ZX3 that i needed to clear an o2 code, and it works GREAT with Torque Pro
B002R1HN6E|4|Purchased to replace the very faded headlights in my 99 Corolla. This assembly was virtually identical to the OEM assembly. Swapping the actual assembly is no problem; all you need is a 10mm socket wrench to remove 3 bolts and 1 nut, plus a 10mm crescent wrench to calibrate it once it's installed.<br /><br />The worst part of the installation was removing and then replacing the front bumper cover. I'm not totally sure it was necessary to begin with, but I just followed instructions I found on youtube. YMMV
B0018YD4D2|5|Good!!
B00DIGV4MG|3|The buckle length is shorter (about 3 inches) than factory making it difficult to clasp the belt, also the belt section in not as long as factory. Other than that they fit perfectly and is good quality.
B008DGJY9Q|3|not forged but cast. seems ok for the price
B00FTABGTA|5|Just what I wanted & looks great on my Ram
B00K4P25CW|1|The key does not fit it list the key will fit 2010 glk350. I would want a refund but it will cost more to ship it back to the seller.
B0083SL82A|3|To Start off, I really like the look of these mirrors. The blue tint is nice for the sunny days. After reading the other reviews, I think I got lucky because my mirrors are not distorted. I can see the cars behind well but I wish they were a bit bigger so I could see the road a bit further back. They were pretty simple to install, all I needed was a 5mm hex bit. I had them on my bike for about a week before I ended up switching back to the stock mirrors. When I exceeded 8000 RPM on my bike, the mirrors became loose, rotated, and would now swing with movement. I feel if the rubber mounts that go into the tubes were longer, it would hold much stronger. The mirrors are all metal and rubber construction. Its a shame that with such a good build quality, they did not have a good enough mount.
B00AHRHVT4|5|Nice lights. Have had them on my truck for about a year now and they still work fine. No complaints they are better made than I figured they would be and brighter
B002OARFLG|3|works great
B00GBRG4TC|5|I was able to use this filter in my 2014 Nissan Altima S Model.  I couldn't find a standard &#34;oil lube filter&#34; place that carried this, which meant I needed to get dreaded dealer service.  I am not much of a DIY guy, but 10 minutes later (after watching a youtube video), I had a new filter installed.  Great stuff!
B00C0XA9JW|5|05 jeep grand cherokee<br />im a mechanic my self and this was not to bad to do. good cheap lift added about 3in to the hight. put on some 265's bfg all terrain and looks sick! you'll love the look. worth the money
B00DS836PW|5|very good product
B008WNTKHQ|5|very good wosks great
B00NB2XT6Q|5|Great multi purpose compressor. I have used it a few times now on my tires, I love screw on valve stem. That allows you not to be bent down holding the air line on trying to keep air only going into the tire instead of losing air pressure to atmosphere. I have also used on my football and am looking forward to using on infallible beach balls and etc during the summer
B00KQGNC0S|4|It's bigger than you would expect, but fits both the pump and repair kit.  Not compact by any means.
B001A0IT5C|4|I bought two of these side mirrors for an older vehicle I own and they work great.  Easy to install.  They eliminated the blind spots and made driving safer.
B000EDSSDE|4|Good product.  A little more bulky than blocks, but way easier to level.  Well made.  I still need a few more words to get to 20
B000C800VO|5|Fit and works as expected. Great Price from this seller.
B00M3L159Y|5|It looks better !
B00B8KP4SO|4|These light took my Chrysler 300 2006 SRT 8 to a new level. They look.great and work find. I would mention that you do need to buy 2 bulbs that was not listed in the selling.<br /><br />JJ
B005P7CKJW|4|Pretty cool ! My only complaint is that it does seem to have some wrinkles ya cant get out, even with heat. Other than that, my gun looks incredible
B006A49KJC|4|It seems like it has been working well for my Passat B5, turbo. I wish it was a bit cheaper though.
B00H8BXK6U|5|Product as described.  Great Buyer to wok with.
B004U3XQWC|5|Great product. Was easy to assemble and attach to car.
B00IYT9RDK|5|loved it logo on both sides fast shipping
B006J2P3GY|5|Great perfect looking very very nice
B003US1OSG|5|I know my kid is going to like it.. If it says FOX on it, it is pretty much a given.
B004BSAI4A|4|worked
B000VLC83U|5|Wow!!  This is a high quality, functional item that comes at such a reasonable price. We purchased this camper shell due to it being lighter in weight than the fiberglass types.  Saves on gas.  Plus, it folds down!! So you don't loose the back of your pick-up if needed and no having to remove a heavier camper shell.  This remains on your pick-up when you fold in down.  Keeps all your items free from the rain, wind, etc.  Got lots of good comments and many inquires from other pick-up owners.  Need not to mention that to top things off (made a pun) that it is a Bestop!!  Quality materials.  We love this shell.  Would highly recommend this item.  Glad that Bestop came up with this idea for truck owners.  Shipping was quick and all parts were there.
B009DK7JCU|5|Nice replacement light for our Passat!
B000EVWE6I|3|I chose this speedometer because it was the lowest priced one with a black face and white numbers that also fit an older Toyota Landcruiser.  It was everything I expected except for:  1. the Toyota speedo cable didn't clip on, the inner cable fit but the outer lock didn't.  I had to secure the outer cable to the housing with electrical tape; 2. the light bulb housings don't twist and lock, they're just held in place due to a tight fit.  No problem while it's new, but after 50 times changing bulbs or bulb colors, I'll probably have to put a dab of Elmer's glue on to hold them in place; 3.  (this is probably due to my setup, not the speedo) it reads 5 mph below actual speed from 0 to about 50, then it's right on from 60 to 75.  If I had known this before I bought it, I still would have bought it.  I'm not disappointed.
B0009V1WSE|5|Great.
B00KTIYXLU|3|Batteries go dead too fast
B00368N4TC|5|Perfect fit for my Evo 8, installed with the matching radiator when the stocker started leaking.  Pretty easy install using the existing hose clamps.  Looks great, no leaks, easy install.
B00O84WNNG|5|I got this to keep my twp mowers charged and ready for the summer, so far the chargers are doing great and I like the fact they can be left plugged in all the time.
B00L3NYVHQ|5|Got this product a big discount, very soft and i used it for washing our cars , i want to buy more...very useful wet and dry cleaning.
B00DY78RWY|4|My back hasn't sweated since buying this, so far so good, my concern is the switch; I hope it holds up to the amount of use it will get,  I am drug rep and am in and out of the car often. Would be nice if it would turn off/on when the car did... It would be easy to leave it on and wear down the battery accidentally.
B009PDC23Q|1|Unit &#34;DID NOT&#34; come with a new key blank as stated in the description.... See pic....
B0052YLXUK|5|Quality bearings for replacing the rear axle bearings. I did not realize that the kit included the dust cover seal also and ordered that  unnecessarily, so I wasted $15 w/shipping.
B004CWKZ98|1|this is the second brand of screen protector that I purchased for my Samsung Craft. Both have been to slightly too large. Just enough so that not all the edges will seat themselves. You might think that I just don't know what I'm doing, but I haven't had problems with other phones screen protectors.
B0093EC0BG|4|Brought for my 2006 f150. Relatively easy to install. Looks nice. No idea if signals, lamps, or defrosters work, as I did not orinally have them. Power adjust works fine.
B00DQTIWHA|1|yuck
B00FNSQMFQ|5|Exactly what I want ed
B00JBI9HHY|5|Was perfect ! It´s a touch of restyling for the car. The quality is so good !
B0041PQ20C|5|WELL MADE AND WOULD HAVE KEPT THIS HELMET BUT IT WAS TOO SMALL FOR MY WIFES HEAD SO WE HAD TO RETURN IT
B003BZLLUE|5|Great product
B0068EOS7S|5|These are super strong and engineered to excellence. The curve at the end of the hand guards near the grips makes it convenient for your hand to hold the bike as if the guards were not there
B00F6DAK92|2|Not sure why they think they can say these are 8° spot beams. The Unity spotlight on the average police car is also said to be 8° and this is not even close when compared side by side.<br /><br />It is a bright, cheap light with a plastic lens. I don't expect the lens to last more than a year, but that's just a guess.  I hoped this light would be perfect for use as a driving light and the tight beam would not blind other drivers. But the light beam does bleed off too much and would blind the other drivers. So now they are part of my high beams. The light is nice and does throw light a lot further than the 48 watt/30° & the 27watt/30° lights that I also have on my Armada.<br /><br />I just dont expect the lenses & lights to survive. The plastic lens moves around to the touch. Water does get inside. I will need to take them apart soon and seal everything & hope that will keep them working.<br /><br />So buy with caution. Buy thinking that you may only have these working for one year, then you will be happy with them if they last longer.<br />For me, I will not be buying these for my other vehicles.
B008VPAPZG|4|I bought this since the buttons fell off my original key for my 2008 Saab 9-3. I bought this one which is made out of plastic rather than the rubber the original one was made out of.<br /><br />I put the electronics and battery in the fob, and the buttons worked and my car started. It does what it sets out to do.<br /><br />No Saab sticker on the replacement fob, so I have to dock one star.
B0010E3JUI|5|the best
B0023VGMLU|5|The garage wanted $200 to repair this so the vehicle would pass inspection. We got the part for around $50 and it took about 5 minutes to pop it in and it passed. And the car looks so much better now!
B00007E7LO|5|I just purchased a used 2003 4RUNNER and the truck club fits perfectly. If you're paranoid like me, the truck club gives you that extra sense of security that your truck wont be stolen (unless someone really really wants your car).
B000COSN4E|5|Top quality wires. Perfect fit and a fair price.
B002R6FTB0|5|Although it took me longer than I thought it would, the mesh grill was fairly easy to install. Instructions are accurate. Great price compared to local dealers and other websites.
B004IAGNNG|3|The product is good. It works for the most part as described. It does not ALWAYS reset trouble codes. It worked for a Dodge but not for an Acura. Also the program is poorly laid out and clumsy.
B00CTLGSZO|5|It is the Best, no more getting out to- see are we there yet
B003FID1NW|5|great deal--shipped fast
B002G47GE6|5|Easy to install in a 5 minutes
B004144C6E|5|This fuel pump was received on time and in good condition. I installed it with no problems and it is working properly. It was purchased on April 1, 2012.<br />Thanks Amazon for a great deal!
B00DYBBP06|5|Is nice.
B008SERYA4|4|Good floor mats that do come in the exact shape of those from the factory. Carpet not quite as high quality, and just the tiniest shade different in color. Would have preferred them to be packaged differently, as removing the thread tying them all together (which seems unnecessary) will result in some small holes in the mats afterward. Hard to complain for the price you pay for these custom mats.
B000FEDP8A|5|Thanks for summing up the culture wars of this country in 4 words. The vinyl dries out in the sun, so I mounted it to cardboard before hanging in my window.
B00HE66IQS|5|Perfect Match. Had to touch up my car after the first time I had it on the highway. Glad I got this one as the color matched up perfectly.
B007IOBTBK|5|Good for a die-hard fan.
B00DFUO77O|4|Fit and finish is good, everything lines up. I used the old bulb not the new one that comes with it and the whole headlight seems dimmer than the factory right one I did not replace. Not that noticeable, but the reason im giving it 4 stars instead of 5.
B000C02XNK|5|these rotors are great quality and have been great. real nice look to them and way better than the vatozone parts.
B007JSGR9Y|4|I had an auto parts supplier read my engine light code and reset the code.  A few days later the code came back and I thought I might need a scanner.  This one is easy to read on the screen and presented the same code as the auto parts store.  I was able to erase the code which turned off the engine light.  Now I will fix the car. Scanner is easy to use and lightweight.  Thank you.
B005EL3QRE|5|The seal doctor seems to work.  My seals had been leaking slightly for a while... not bad, but annoying.  I ran the seal doctor through a few times, and it allowed a bit of oil to come through the seal and flush it out.  Since the seal doctor released some oil out through the seal, I put a few drops of fresh fork oil back into the top of the fork through the air-bleeder screw.  Since doing this, I have not noticed any more leaks.
B001EOWQ5I|5|2008 CRV: My installation went fast and was easy; you can install this yourself. The un-snapping of the interior trim was simple. I pulled the trim back, reached in, and clipped the fittings together. I taped the little black box to the body. Then, I pushed, pounded, and snapped the trim back into place. I think it took longer to put the trim back into place then opening the inside trim and making the connection. It only took a few minutes and the wiring works.
B00666BSBW|5|EBC makes high quality pads, and these (which fit my 2006 Kawasaki Ninja 250) are excellent.  They're not quite as aggressive as the factory pads, but are still quite good enough.  As a previous reviewer noted, the FA129 set is only the two front brake pads, and not a set for both front and back.
B00TYXZU5Y|5|Always a reliable first class product. This time made better with Amazon Prime shipping!
B00AHL6E3Y|2|The front seat covers fit good but the back seat covers didn't fit good at all.  They are too big and now they look baggy.  There were no holes for the head rests or the seat belts.  I liked the floor mats.  I couldn't get the steering wheel cover to go on even when I let it sit in the 90 degree.
B00T0X2WEA|5|Shipping was fast and this product is very easy to install and looks good
B004ZF3TLS|4|Installed a set on my 2011 Kawasaki KLR 650. Went with the 4300 color , a little more white than the stocks but just a little. Much more light output but takes about 15 seconds to get up to full output. Ballasts were bigger than I expected but I got them to fit. Only been running them for a couple of weeks so don't know how long they will last. I also freed up some watts for my electric jacket and gloves, every bit helps on the KLR. Good bang for the buck!
B00B9ET8IG|4|Missing transponder
B00D7HN0LE|5|I purchased this adapter for my camaro, I wanted to be able to turn on the daytime running lights with my halos and this adaptor is perfect. It is not too expensive, if you do not want to sit outside under the heat or cold to rewire your cables I suggest spending a few bucks to buy this adaptor. You do not have to watch a video on how to install this adaptor, you simply connect this adaptor on the passenger side of your car, the cables you need are going to be right above the light bulb for the daytime running lights. It took me about 5-10 minutes to install this, I definitely recommend this if you have a camaro and want to turn all of your front lights at the same time.
B001CSKEOQ|4|Great item to have if you love Betty Boop like I do and it makes the inside look even more better.
B00HFMTM5K|3|It's actually not as shown. The flags are on the bottom and the EH? is on top - hard to see the EH? (which I thought was the best part) once installed.
B000BPOI8O|5|Wandering through Home Depot, Lowe's and other such stores I wasted time & fuel & never did find this plug for my weed whacker. Then it occurred to me= AMAZON. I found it immediately, got a great plug that has my machine running great and it has a lifetime guarantee. This is a really good deal.
B00DNU3MIG|3|These arrived, very fast and work Fantastic... But they would fit in a Tea Cup... and were shipped in a box 3x3x2 and placed in another Box 8x8 and filled with plastic to fill up the box. Yes they arrived uninjured..lol there zinc they wont break.. and could of been sent in the first box, or a box half that size. Come on folks we don't need to Box,  boxes .. Just saying!
B000E5U6PU|5|I was able to install this kit in about an hour. The instructions are very clear for removal of your exsiting air intake. No real sound difference at low idle or normal driving....but when you put your foot down on the gas you will hear a big difference around 3000 RPMs.
B007OXCIB0|5|I decided to buy the product to meet the free shipping requirements and I was surprised on how fast this item was delivered. Kudos to the vendor. The quality and texture of the product is way better than I expected. Definitely making a few more purchases of this to complete a now new project.
B00IWO4K8O|1|Didn't fit a 2006 Honda CRV. Felt flimsy.
B003BZWR4S|5|We use this in our studio and have never had a problem.  Not as pricey as some others but just as good IMO.
B00CDXUEDU|5|I found some halogen off road lights at a garage sale and installed them on my truck. This wiring harness made the wiring job super easy.
B001O0GGP8|1|sent it back, wrong ones
B006IFDM4C|5|I bought these for my small camper to extent my battery life while in the back country and they are worth every penny! Make a huge difference in how much light they put out versus the old style and takes for ever to see any voltage drop in the battery.
B00NRLCATI|5|Great product
B0070ZZ490|5|Very well made, with some height combinations to choose from, depending on the way you place the polyurethane bushings. Installed them in no time on the rear sway bar of a 65 Nissan Patrol, since the originals were completely rusted. Suspension is without any lift, and longer ones will be needed in that case. Would be great if Energy Suspension will make longer ones.
B00KDO3ANC|5|Awesome
B003N8LB4K|2|These are mad from the same material you purchase for your chair mat to protect carpet. Made of very hard PVC. I kept them about 6 months.<br /><br />The Good:<br />Fit well<br />Durable - they will never wear out...ever<br />Very Clear<br /><br />The Bad:<br />They smell bad for about 3 months<br />They are very hard with pointy spikes below. They can scratch you and plastic in your car or even put a tear in your seat. I always worried when the car wash was removing them.<br />They can fold over and prevent the gas pedal from pressing. (yes this happened to me)<br />They travel (Despite the pointy grips)<br />They are very flat with no ridges to catch dirt. Dirt and liquids simply roll off to the carpet.
B006C86G4S|1|Took me months to recieve.So isn't worth the wait.
B0032H8N2U|5|This cover was so easy to install.  Works great.  It is very simple to retract. I highly recommend this product.
B004JKZ2AU|5|I have a '99 Honda Superhawk, and this works great on the rear.  I have not tried it on the front yet.
B000HEBR3I|5|sierra works great just needs longer hose
B0045V3PXO|5|I dont usually review these types of things but these blades worked well and lasted 2 years before I had to replace them.
B008H08LQU|4|Great product. Everything is just as described. The only downside is the wait as it ships from China. Definitely recommended.
B009SEI7KE|4|The paint color match my 98M3 color
B00ANZHG7C|4|Works as advertised, good product for the price
B001CF19TS|5|Put it in a Crown Vic Police Interceptor....fits perfect!
B000U0JCPO|5|I've had my Duracell D2A Battery Charger/Maintainer for several months now, and it's worked perfectly on my antique motorcycle.  The green light indicates when the battery is on a \\"floating-charge\\" maintainance voltage, and I have no qualms about leaving the unit plugged in for long periods.      I used the supplied battery pigtail wires to make a semi-permanent setup, which makes it very easy to plug the battery into the charger without even having to remove the motorcycle seat.  This charger also comes with clamp-on wires, and even an automotive 12-volt plug for car batteries.      I can't vouch for the long term reliability of the Duracell charger, and I certainly wouldn't leave it outside, as it doesn't make any claim of being waterproof, but so far I'm delighted with it, and am starting to regret that I didn't buy two, especially at the sale price that was on Amazon
B00FKPJIGC|5|These things are bright!! I bought them to replace my red bulbs in my car that went out. They are super bright. Definitely recommend if you like red
B003F0RR7G|5|Ordered this to replace the stock factory paper filter in our 2010 equinox.  Couldn't find any filter other than at the dealership that wanted more $$$ than this k&n.  It was a no brainer decision to purchase a higher quality filter at the cheaper price and have since seen gas mileage improve by .4mpg, seems subtle but these really do pay for themselves.  Couldn't be happier with this drop in performance filter.
B0041CDPQO|5|Install is pretty straight forward if you know how to take off the tank. Very convenient and useful. No more not answering your phone because it ran out of charge while you were out riding. Note that it doesn't come with a fuse junction to go to the battery. I already had one that I use for my battery charger and connect it to that when I ride.
B000FGJSXE|5|Just as promised, good product.
B003TU662Y|5|Better use for flat floor / wall use.  Avoid using in corners to avoid marring with the black brush platform you see in the picture.
B00LFM3WH0|4|I would give this (the combination of the cover and the locking kit (both mechanical and solenoid operated) five stars if it were not for the poor quality control exhibited in the fabrication of the rails for the cover.  I had to clean up the pop-rivet area on both sides - something that should have been done at the factory.  In the case of my installation, a failure to clean up after drilling the holes for the pop-riveting caused the pop-rivets to not settle down against the aluminum extrusions.  Such a simple thing to take care of but which left me feeling quite disappointed - for the price of this item that should not have been my experience.<br /><br />As to operation once installed - great!  The instructions for the locking mechanism are pretty sketchy and poorly illustrated but it is a simple installation and it works fine once installed.  I would buy this again but hope the company (whom I did contact to complain) does a better job instructing their assemblers and with QA.
B0001XPC04|5|satisfied with my purchase
B000PWC5JM|5|Thick grooves, very durable, fit is perfect for the BMW 530i (E39) sedan.  You will not be dis-satisfied and well worth the $$$$$.
B00HN9NOFO|5|I only had a couple of tiny places to fill in where someone accidently bumped the front of my car - this is a perfect color match.  I couldn't find those places now if I had to!
B0024ECIP0|5|Best cord going.  The handles make pulling apart a one person job, used to be a team effort with the old cords.
B001V8U3J8|5|Great fixed my Awning on my travel trailer, will probably be getting a new canvas soon, Thanks James
B00XAX4B9A|5|Great product! Keeps my car cooler in this South Texas heat!
B0051D3MP6|4|Did not use but looks waterproof for the place I need it.<br />I had to change the eye hooks they were to large for sons quad
B00144B26C|5|This is a great product at a great price.
B007TKL8CI|5|This is a wonderful purchase! I bought an RV cover from this manufacture (Eevelle) a few months ago. It comes with a three-year warranty. They were a great help when I talked to their customer service department, answering any questions I had about their products. The RV cover is sturdy, durable material. I am pleased with my purchase and have bought other items from them as well. Thank you!
B00KYXWY34|4|Hard to install, but looks good!
B0054DWS1W|5|I picked this up to lube the brake pistons on my motorcycle but this lube can be used virtually anywhere on virtually anything.Great suff for the price.highly recommended.
B0060KKGA8|3|Got here quick.  I  bought this becauce my original mirror is discolored (I was told because of the heating element imside) It is slightly smaller than the OME but only a tad and really not.  noticeable worked just fine.
B006LO7YM6|5|Arrived sooner than expected.  Thanks!  Checked the voltage before installing and found it to be fully charged and ready to install.<br /><br />The bolts are a bit short so if you have any other leads attached such as for a battery tender, you'll have to fiddle with the nuts or get slightly longer bolts.
B002OPHLAQ|5|I'm really happy with my purchase they do well in mud and muck.
B0066IUDSY|1|There was not enough power to generate heat at a temperture that would defrost.
B00MDUZ93I|3|The floor mats look good but are very slippery if you have any water or snow on your Feet.  My biggest issue is the holes that lock the mat to the floor don't fit my buick and the water from the mat leaks to the carpet since they Are open not closed.  All and all they are nice but if I had to do it all over again I would by weather tech mats instead.  Not worth the 2 months I waited to recieve them
B000COUN74|5|It MSD and it works
B005NLQAHS|5|Great
B000C39C72|1|I bought this some time ago for a project truck that i just got around to finishing up. This thing worked fine for about a week and a half then one morning the fans just never came on. They also just come on for no reason at times when the truck isn't even running. The bright side is i see they are a little cheaper than they were when i purchased mine, but you get what you pay for. i suggest paying a little more and get a more reliable controller.
B00274JM7E|5|great product....now I don't have to go searching in my purse or pockets for a tissue....there's one right above my head ready to use....so convenient
B00390BS7C|5|Actually haven't had to use it yet, as the O2 sensors on our Caravan are still showing good, but it is a good strong heavy sturdy feeling tool, which I added to my specialty toolbox, for certain future use....
B008564ZQG|5|THANKS
B0036ULEV0|5|Just what I expected after looking for the best options air gauge options for car, bike and accessory inflating needs.  Gauge measures well and clamp holds valve stem securely.
B00KI1WINS|5|It was perfect...just like the one that was ripped off. ..
B00T60P4U6|3|Aluminum... Not steel. But the color's nice.
B0006VORDY|5|Good quality product
B005TTYZEY|5|Great product!  Good value!
B00CU6B6A0|3|Works well
B0043Q0ZLQ|1|I previously gave this seat 5 stars.  Super comfy and good value.  I've owned it for a few months now and after casual use in the garage it is completely giving way.  I am 6', 250 lbs.  The \\"C\\" shape of the seat frame is literally collapsing.  I do not abuse my tools and this one has gotten very little use since I bought it.  It is no longer a \\"C\\" but taking on the shape of a triangle.  To salvage it I will have to get a jack at the end of the arm and bottom frame and bend it back into shape and reinforce it.  I cannot keep using it as is.  If you are 100 lbs less than me you may never have this problem, but it is not holding up for me at all.  The $20 Harbor Frieght seat held up with the same design.  This one certainly should have.
B0017R95DI|4|The pump was delivered much faster then I expected. When I opened the box, the plastic bag that wraps around the pump was soaked inside with oil. Every surface on the pump was soaked and sticky, right down to the cord. The oil bottle that was in the box was still sealed tightly. The oil leaked out of the unit.  There was a large tag on the pump stating that it contains no oil prior to shipment and it must be filled before use.  The oil definitly came from inside the unit.  The oil plug underneath the pump was loose too.  I know they test these things from the factory but having it show up messy was just a hastle.  It does not look like someone used it and returned it. There wasn't a scratch on it.     I have not used the pump yet, although I filled it with oil and turned it on. It was very quiet.
B000SKYL9I|5|I have always trusted Mobil 1, especially with the oil products.  I was surprised it was actually delivered, but extremely happy since this particular weight is not offered near me.
B00L32LMVA|4|Good for the price - only with the clamping bracket design was I a little more user friendly. Once tightened down, it forms a really good seal around the bed; even the heaviest rain ain't getting in.
B002KOIDEO|5|This charging system is great.  I am glad this addtional pigtail is available for an additional vehicle.  One of the best items I have for the Harley.
B00E1SJ1AC|5|To get these parts locally, I'd have to pay twice as much for a lesser quality.  These parts are more like the factory parts then the cheap one sold elsewhere.  Just better metallurgy and specification for the price here.
B00H26EW54|3|Thought that the part would at least have been some sort of metal. It is all plastic and looks like it will fall apart when I try and mount anything to it.
B0002SRH4W|4|.  One big negative is the two flat adapters it should been provided with 4 I forget where they supposed to go since i lost the owners manual.  also the big collar nut supposed to go below the anchor plate when pulling that sucks cant use a ratchet.
B002E3KOJ8|5|I ordered a 5000k and 4300K (anything higher, like 8000k and above will be very blue and you wont be able to see at night, plus they are illegal in alot of places. Stay with 4300k to 6000K at the most) Bi-Xenon HID kit for my 2008 Hummer H3. The install was very easy...much easier than I anticipated. I also ended up breaking a piece of the bulb connector, and the seller got back to me as soon as he possibly could, which was like 2 minutes via email, and that is awesome service. They are sending a replacement part at no cost. Very impressed with the overall experience. From the product price, to the instll and the seller being so helpful. I would highly recommend this to anyone.
B0030I91BI|3|Still too early to tell how this will work out, but gave it a 3 rating just because the fit was somewhat tight and I wasn't sure at first if it was going to fit and work. I have only used it once around the property so need to see how it works after a few times out on the road. I plan to limit the distance that I take it thought just in case. Will try to update this after testing it out well.
B00BFXN9DG|4|Ordered them - they arrived - packed well - i put them in and they worked.....the way the world was intended to go around!!
B00MOR4CFQ|5|super bright and easy to install
B004ATHRVC|1|Never recu my command(order) the salesman has canceller my command(order) talks probleme with expediteur tres bad kept silent salesman achete kept silent pay and he cancelle
B002ERQLMS|5|Easy install. Small profile sot not as visible
B009FUFCDQ|5|Can use for everything - car, bike, kitchen. Anything that needs cleaning just use these handy cloths. Easy to wash and use again, all stains come out easy.
B001L299PI|5|Fits, works well, looks good. Nice upgrade to tow jet skis. 2007 Nissan Murano now car is more useful with hitch.
B000EVYGZA|4|It does what I expect it to do. One problem: The holders for the probes are effectively useless, no matter where along the probe you try to mount it.
B004I0MOIY|5|great product came complete with bulbs, easy plug and play install
B000JZKIL2|3|This item does NOT fit a 2005 Jeep Grand Cherokee 4.7 V8 as advertised.
B002796PJW|5|Very good well made spark plug.  Best price of anyplace, I recommend these plugs for your model A Ford car
B00JG3OIFU|5|Good stuff
B005CNNJI0|5|I bought the husky liners weatherbeaters for all my cars, highly recommended. Made in the USA as well.  You won't be disappointed.
B00J5940JE|5|Removes rust to clean metal effectively
B000MILXMO|4|Found this and it's just what we were looking for. The other one we had that had been bought years ago needed to be replaced. This fit the bill.
B002OIB9GU|5|Installed these on a 2011 Ram 1500 Quad Cab. Took about 15 minutes to install all four and they look great!
B00O1UO80S|3|The lights are not as bright as was described and two in the pack did not work.  Easy to install though, and they work really well, but I will be going with a brighter one next time.
B00L4JA2Q8|5|I bought this one for my WR Blue, 2015 Subaru WRX STI: &#34;Genuine Subaru J361SVA000 Touch-Up Paint, WR Blue Pearl (BLU - 2015MY), Paint code k7x&#34; and it matched perfectly! I touched up some light nicks in my paint, and also used it to paint plastic plugs I got to cover my front bumper holes (that are for JDM license plates).
B000I45Y8Q|5|Complete set of E sockets at a good price. They shipped quick and worked well. Used them to remove the seat in my Silverado.
B001PHY8HS|5|great
B004KPQB90|4|Really good fitment
B004SR87JW|1|Promoted as a replacement for a 1996 Jeep Grand Cherokee, this is not that. It looks to be a solid replacement, just not for the use stated.
B000C7TUQQ|5|Had to make a connector hose fitting to make it work but a good price and works great.
B000GV5CIS|5|Built perfectly for up to 6 footers.  Takes ALL the pressure OFF the tailbone.  No fatigue when riding and your partner will really appreciate it too!
B000JRO9JM|4|My feet were pleased
B008I2OZJO|5|THIS POLISH IS FANTASTIC, IT REALLY PUT A GREAT SHINE ON MY CAR, AND COVERS THE SMALL<br />SCRATCHES....GREAT PRODUCT AS ALWAYS BY DUPONT..I WILL BUY IT AGAIN....KEN
B00HJ2CR2Q|5|Not metal. Has good adhesive foam on the back. Gives the look you're after without breaking the bank
B003RWYYPK|5|Perfect!  Easy to program with the included instructions.  Works great!
B0057GU6A6|5|It does require buffing, and it is a 2007 van, so the color is very slightly off. This is certainly better than a white scratch or a new paint job.
B00AB2PBU6|5|so awesome
B000EQFTD8|5|I love the bulb, but unfortunately I have a 2011 Jeep Liberty which has really bad headlights, but for the price I'd totally buy them again.
B009PAK75E|5|fits my 2002 honda civic
B008Y2RYHS|5|The decal was in great condition I'm very happy with it! Love the game of thrones and this does it justice!!!
B000C822YM|5|Easy to install, Fits perfectly and I will buy another when I need to, thank you so much, this saved me.
B00ABKN6WI|3|These are definitely a middle-of-the road product. The luxury of changing out lenses does not make up for the fact that the frames feel INCREDIBLY flimsy and the lenses pop out without pressure on the back. Seriously. Hold them wrong and the lenses pop out.<br /><br />I use these as 'goggles' when riding which alleviates the loose-lens issue. So far no fogging issues. I'll give this product a 3 out of 5 because they work for my intent - riding goggles that can be glasses. But as soon as the frames snap (which they feel like they will if I breathe on them wrong) I'll be requesting a replacement/refund and kicking this down to 1/5 stars.
B002VPL6AA|5|Perfect fit
B004NUZ50I|4|These two wrenches are needed when removing fan to replace belts.  I plan to use them soon when my other parts get in.
B00IKJ8HH6|5|very good and fast service would order again
B0052XNOXU|5|Perfect factory replacement, easy to install, good price on Amazon.
B004TO0WJW|4|I bought these to use on a 1/2&#34; (5/16 ID) line replacing a metric size fuel line on my boat. They are too small to fit the 1/2 line, especially when there is a bulge in the fitting the hose goes on to. So, they're OK for 13.3mm lines, but I couldn't find any SAE sizes.
B002XML5HK|4|when i first received them they worked great( used the lube also) drilled out about 20 spot welds on a quarter panel and about 10 pan head screws. the next time i used the same bit to remove spot welds an outer wheel wheel the cutter broke like it was made of china. i hope this was a fluke.
B00DR14U0K|5|Got the top very quickly even for standard shipping. The top itself is great quality and fits great after nearly a month. No leaks at all. No issues opening and closing the new top. Instructions are decent. Before you buy this I recommend you completely take apart your existing top. Your top frame may be extremely rusted in spots and you don't want to find out halfway through the installation. Also you need to purchase the rain rail. They were nice enough to install the rain rail to the top for me. Very happy with the product.
B00DDWBYTI|4|The sign was delivered damaged but I might be able to fix it without needing to send it back. It was dented in two places. Other than the damage it looks just like picture.
B00D42AFS8|5|Works wonderful
B000VDO1I8|5|This beats any dog whistle around!  1 of 3 dogs runs free on 160 acres twice a day & when I want him home soonest I stand at the gate & let it rip.  He appears within 5 mins from who knows how far out.  When the 3 get into doing anything I want stopped I just give a fast beep & they decease immediately from whatever they're doing.  And if they're in the yard but I can't see them I give a short burst & all 3 come running.  Use it for all kinds of signaling to family members too far from the house to hear a yell - this gizmo is the best - plan to get 2 or 3 more & locate them in the barns for fast access.  Even our hard of hearing folks know to look up after a short blast.  Too cool!
B000GZV5YO|1|I thought I was getting a good battery..... instead I received the first that was DOA and would not take a charge. I put my old battery back in and the bike started so I know it is nothing to do with the bike. contacted the seller who immediately sent out another battery as a replacement... Guess what.  Again...  DOA and would not work even after being charged.
B00E1D1GY6|5|I am performing surgery while I write this review! AND I'm driving! Which is a surprise to me because I cant muti task very well. Ok I'm going to explain why this product is the-ASJAKISD OH GOD THERE IS BLOOD EVERYWHERE! WHERE IS THE BODY? THE BODY IS GONE!
B0039LDF4A|5|I was quite dubious about this but bought it anyway. After a little trial and error it stopped the leak in my Ohlins fork seals, which are notorious for early leakage. On another bike with the same type forks I developed a leak far from home on a long trip, without this tool along, so I trimmed a corner of a BMWOC membership card and fixed the seal!
B003TTL0TE|5|I love Amazon Prime. Arrived in 2 days. On a Sunday too. Have yet to use it feels like it will wash my car very nice.
B004GD9AA8|5|Worked great, replaced a busted door handle......
B00480KPH6|1|No comments...
B00I3YCCWE|5|Exactly what I've needed. No more screwing around. Just snap on and spray, un-snap and store away. Easy! I like easy.
B00MIHIYVA|4|Well made, instructions mostly complete. If they hadn't skipped a couple of steps and made one reference to two bolts when there were three, then definitely a five-star product. Great value compared to other models I've seen.<br /><br />One big advantage of this product is the tremendous weight savings from removing the entirely too robust sub-frame that supported the old tail.
B004TMHF8K|3|i love it
B00651CLCS|2|Disappointing... Some here have stated reception with this antennae was just as good as the factory one, I can tell you my experience is quite different. Reception is notably WORSE. For FM stations where I had marginal reception with the factory antennae, I now get absolutely nothing but silence, not even static or a broken up signal without being in much closer range of the broadcast.<br /><br />This one looks great and all but it's certainly not even close to being as functional as the factory antennae.<br />Not sure I can/will keep it installed.
B00F9RNIPI|5|I love these booster cables. I bought 3 that came with a little nicer zip-up case. But I could not get any more. So I ordered 3 more of these with the bag. They still have gloves and brush which are handy. I love the heavy duty construction and especially the 20 foot length. Now we do not have to position the cars perfectly in order to get the cables to reach. I used one set tonight for the first time when my daughter left a light on in her car and the battery went dead.  Great cables!  I plan to order 2 more so that all of our cars have a set.
B00RT3QA8C|5|After trying the usual concave round mirror and finding the duplicate image distracting, I ordered these adjustable versions.  These are adjustable in all directions and do maintain their positioning.  The adjustment amount is more than sufficient to provide a field of view of EITHER the inner or the outer area that is not covered by the main mirror. The asymmetrical shape allows edge placement thus minimizing the amount of main mirror that is covered.  Uses 3M adhesive pads.  The 2&#34; size is a little small, especially if used on a passenger mirror - recommend a 3&#34; size.
B000CK5QTI|5|These front brake pads are great for a Honda Civic. They fit just right like original OEM parts, quality is great, and thanks to Amazon, shipping was immediate. After installation (which took maybe about an hour on both sides), the brakes feel great, and there is no noise whatsoever! Get these brake pads, the quality is amazing. Make sure to get the drag reduction clips or springs (Raybestos H6001) that are recommended with these, it's not a must, but it pushes the pads away from the rotors when brake force is not being applied, and it reduces the friction noise and probably also unnecessary pad wear. I'm not a 100% sure, but I feel like the springs also reduced a little bit of steering wheel vibration at higher speed (very slight before this change anyway) because the brake pads are not constantly rubbing on the rotors. Give these a try.
B0010DWEX2|5|The KYB GR-2 suspension strut and coil spring assembly provides an excellent ride on my vehicle.  Slightly stiffer than oem strut and coil, the ride is not perceptibly harsher but the handling and cornering has improved compared to the original manufacturer's struts.  Installation was straight forward and did not pose any danger since the strut and coil spring are pre-assembled.  Installation required less than 30 minutes per side.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B0010DWEX2 KYB SR4027 GR-2 Suspension Strut and Coil Spring Assembly]]
B004BTDOTK|5|If you are bothered by wipers that miss spots or skip across your windshield, I recommend these PIAA wipers. They have a silicon rubber wiper in an attractive flat wiper blade that is actually beneficial if you use your wipers at autobahn speeds.<br /><br />I recommend you use these blades in combination with Aquapel windshield treatment. The two product compliment each other and make for a safer drive.<br /><br />When using these wiper blades, I change them once a year .... in the Spring before April's showers.
B0040CYZ28|5|Needed to replace most of the retainers on the doors of my '99 Tahoe. This is just what I needed, and not a bad deal for the price.
B00DSD7IAG|5|Perfect for my car!
B006G7519G|5|i was getting 3rd gear lock out and super notchy shifting.... these bushings fixed that completely!  i've recommended these to close friends and they've ordered them already!
B001U28NX8|5|I use this on the black lower-body cladding on an Infiniti Q45 to keep it from looking dried-out. It lasts for weeks, much longer than similar spray-on products. It looks, feels and smells almost exactly like the original-formula Jergens moisturizing lotion.
B004XE5ODW|5|Obviously the best bumper sticker there ever was.  It's now on my wife's laptop which she uses at Columbia, where Ferrets are illegal. :(
B000C55MQK|5|Work perfect<br /><br />install in 30 minutes, it was easy<br /><br />regardless of the state of the road, it feels soft cushioning for passengers and is more comfortable on a trip experience
B00CF72BBC|5|I dont have them installed yet but the quality is there i didnt get a tracking number but thats not too big of a deal
B007HU3C5G|5|Good price got it delivered really fast
B007HYR8HA|5|Perfect!
B007ZDDUCK|5|I'm happy with my purchase. The scent is nice and the leather is soft. It is not sticky, but make sure you let it completely dry first.<br />I don't have any long term experience yet, but I can say now that I will only purchase Chamberlain's Leather Milk in the future.
B0041LZDKG|5|I love haynes repair manuals, they tell you how to maintain, fix or deal with any problem you  might encounter with your car. highly recommended!
B000WKAW9M|5|If you own a first-gen KLR 650 like I do, then do not hesitate to buy them. One of the best &#34;Bang for Buck&#34; farkles you can buy. They're a must for dialing in the bikes handling. I weigh 230 and they work great. Go a little up on the fork oil weight, and set the forks about an inch above the clamps. Then just set your rear sag, and pre-load and viola! This almost completely cures the dreaded &#34;Twitchy Feel&#34; on the FWY. For two-up and, or loaded bike, you will need a rear shock or heavier spring, minimally.
B00427MIFC|5|It's an O2 sensor
B00144I5KS|5|After doing Step 1, Step 2, and 3 coats of Step 3 wax on my full size car, and going through quite a few battery recharges over a 10 hour period, this Powerball 4Paint ball still looks new.  It looks like it will last a long time, which is surprising since it is so soft to the touch.  Does a great job.
B000CIPHUI|5|This product comes with the alligator clips and with the round batt cable hook ups.. They don't specify this.. So I almost bought the clips for no reason.. Anyways.. Great product. Thanks
B005C2ADX0|5|One hook is fixed to the cam buckle.  The other hook is connected to a 15 foot strap that goes through the cam buckle.<br /><br />The idea is that you connect on hook to the trailer on one side, than you release the cam so you can span over what you are transporting and connect the other hook to another side of the trailer.  Then you shorten the distance between the two by pulling on the strap.<br /><br />To release you push down on the cam.<br /><br />I used the one I got to tie up a tree.  Since the tree did not have any eyelets to connect the hooks to, I wrapped the strap around the trunk and then around the branch, I connect the hooks and then with one hand I pulled on the strap and with the other I lifted up the branch, and it worked!  Now our new deck can be finished without destroying the privacy provided by the tree.
B000K03XCM|5|There is a price to pay for the great initial bite of these pads in the form of noise and dust. Modulaion is also very good on these pads. Not really recommended for road racing but great for autocross. I use them on my daily driver that I autocross as well. I cannot go back to another pad after driving on these. I tried the HPS, but they felt like they didn't want to stop the car at all. Hehe. I just love the way the HP Plus stop!! If you can deal with the noise and dust, you will not be disappointed.
B005EJGSQ2|5|I bought this heated seat cover for my fiance since the car she is driving does not have them.  The seat gets nice and warm and is pretty simple to attach and detach when needed.  I would definitely recommend buying this seat if your in need of some warmth in the winter.
B005MZVGR4|5|Love these &#34;That 70's Show&#34;-style retro flowers -I've looked for them for ages.  I get lots of compliments.  Many thanks, Magnet America!
B00802FXVG|5|I was going to buy a Hid Kit from DDM tuning, but after finding this one and reading the other reviews I figured I would give Kensun a try. I ordered this kit and it arrived in 5 days as stated. Quality is very good, I like the box it comes in but not that useful. The box alone could probably know $5 off the price, but the price was super low anyway so... I got the kit, installed in a Scion XD 2012. Super easy install, hardest part is mounting the ballast. After installation the HIDs worked very nice!! Beautiful color and we adjusted the headlight so that nobody would be blinded. After doing all the cable management, the headlights would blow the fuse. After a few hours we found out that the Ballast was grounded internally. So I emailed Kensun, got a quick reply and a new ballast shipped out within a few hours. EXCELLENT SERVICE!! So after I needed a headlight to drive at night and I opened the ballast found the short with my multimeter and wrapped it in Kapton tape to insulate it (I use Kapton tape to re flow computers and Xbox because its non conductive and can withstand extreme heat.) So when I got the new Ballast I swapped it and now I have an extra! I really like this kit the light quality is really good and Kensun has excellent service! Definitely recommend this kit or the Innovited, both are inexpensive, very high quality, and offer amazing US based customer service.
B00LVRC5HC|1|Do not buy,<br />Maybe it was just my car but 1 bulb didn't work and the other began to melt into the socket, be careful when using these
B000NPDL76|5|This seems like a quality product. I bought it to confirm a leaking head gasket. I could not get a positive  reading for CO2 from it which wound up being correct. The kit did detect CO2 in a breath test so I assume it would have report correctly on a cylinder leak.I did call the support number with a couple of questions and they were available and informed on the product. since the consequences of the negative test are costly, it might be a good idea to also perform a cylinder leak down test. Now that I have it,  I'd use it before buying a used vehicle since the test only takes a few minutes.
B000CJPZ7W|5|100%
B006524HCO|5|This seat is awesome...does not move around at all. Has not left any scratches upon removal. I highly recommend!
B00466V9AY|5|I got a pair of these for my nephew when he bought a used Ranger that didn't come with any remotes. It was easy to program and they work great.
B00D2LOIC0|5|fit my 2013 challenger and better than the single core stock one. i had to really force the top and bottom hoses on becuase the outlet and inlet are larger.
B00L8FPOVG|5|For my 2009 FZ1 this was a simple install and a perfect fit. There is almost nothing else to say. Great value. They look exactly like the photo. One use and you may have to replace them, but these are not for racing on the track.
B000EQOIT4|5|The 03 LeSabre eats up front motor mounts.  Replaced the front, left, and right mount (didn't replace rear) and car runs much better.  Left and right were weak, not shot, front was completely gone.  Trying to figure out if doing the sides gets the front mount to last longer.
B000GZX2HW|5|This manual actually repaired my bike for me! All I had to do was place the manual near the bike while I spent the day polishing it. Now the 88 runs like a 110! Would definitely recommend for those that don't really care to turn a wrench.
B004GC3P4G|4|fit great!
B00J1TK0CE|5|It was great I like it thank you
B005A3YCDS|5|Very happy with this aftermarket part. Looks just as good as the OEM lens at a very reasonable price. Excellent alternative to OEM part.
B00K6BR0L0|5|Nice quality, does what it is intended to do.
B002BE6VIS|5|After waiting, not so patiently, for several months, I finally was able to order this! And I love it! Easy to apply, make sure to clean the spot first.
B00KAIC474|5|Fast shipping and as described :]
B00NWRKXZA|5|Very sharp looking.
B008H3YI82|4|Solved my problem to replace turn signal on old jeep. Could not find OEM replacements for jeep this old anymore.
B00BG6IUUE|5|Amico 4 Pcs Car Alloy Grenade Shaped Tire Valve Cap Cover Blue. better than i expect. will recomend 100%. thank you very much.
B004VL7AMA|3|Too much dust
B00EHIQ3CU|4|Just installed mine and they bolted in with almost no issues. My only problem was the pigtail where the old headlight pigtail plugs in is incredibly cheap and I bent one of the connections. I was able to bend it back but it was still a little irritating
B000FIWKQY|4|It is not full proof however a great deterrent for my problems with gophers. I have had. Wry good results but still have the occasional pest
B00T9W255I|5|Great stuff. Just enough for a 16 ft trailer
B00G2KICUC|5|Works great
B000KL3AJW|1|The mats get hot and fold up around the door side. When they get cold the mat will go back.
B000MMOJUS|5|I bought one of these 3 1/2 years ago and the plastic coating around the metal cord has only now given away.  I use this often on a daily basis while keep around 10 keys attached to it.  I'm now ordering a replacement to last another 3 years of heavy use.
B004SEVQ4I|5|Fits and works. Best price on the Internet.
B00B8TWJR4|5|Perfect item just as described. Well packaged and arrived earlier than anticipated.
B000IBG3T8|5|good quality, looks neat on the rear.
B0090NTU86|5|Both the temperature knobs on my car broke a few months ago and it has looked really trashy without them.  These knobs fit my 96 Accord perfectly and restored the &#34;normalcy&#34; back to my ride.
B0049EG160|5|Excelente.
B0009J4FVM|4|The wheel cover seems well made and durable.  It is comfortable to the hands.  The 4 star rating is due to the strong  lingering odor.  For two weeks after installing, I could smell the cover when walking by the car which had the windows closed.  I've had it on now for a few months and there is no longer an odor.  Also, be sure to have some kind of a pry tool (flat screwdriver, etc.) when installing.  I did leave it out in the warm Fla sun for a few hours, but still needed a tool to stretch it over the steering wheel.  Knowing what I know now, I would still probably buy it again.  The pros outweigh the cons, IMO.
B00236UCA2|4|They dont stay clear all the timeeee. but they do the job, which is keep me safe. soon ima get a face mask though. oh and btw if you wanna know how these are gonna look on you, get diving goggles, and thats how its gonna look lol. serious.    overall i'd recommend it if your not trying to worry too much on looks, or about money. cause they'll keep you safe, and their cheap. but if you got the cash, and are really worried about safety, or possibly looking cool get a $20 mask.
B003S2A89A|5|Great stuff. Used to fix a potbelly ashtray made of cast iron. After curing I was able to drill two hole to screw parts back together.
B00GBW09G6|5|Exact mopar replacement for a better price
B00KLEVR0M|1|Fell off car on first trip, was attached to a straight, solid piece of body on trunk lid, bought stickers instead.
B001FCM0XM|5|This Grill Guard is perfect! Fits absolutely amazing on my 2007 Tahoe! I got the Aries 4065, and it only took me 3 hours to put it on by myself! The grill is very discrete, I can't even see it from the cab, but it's there! Looks awesome too from the front! There is even two pre-drilled holes for the optional installation of lights if you so chose to have. This thing is 5/5. I have no idea what went wrong with the other reviewer to give it 3/5. It fit perfectly without any extra washers or anything. The only complaint I have is not having smaller hands for the tight spaces of the bolts on the tow hooks! But eventually I got it!
B000GV95KE|5|Very easy to install,instructions are easy to read (not that I used them)  but this really dresses up the ugly axle bolts. Not to mention with it being smooth, it will be easy to clean to. If you have to remove them for a tire change,it will take about 5min. to remove both of them. If you are looking for a very easy way to dress the bike up, this it a very easy one to do.
B000CSKR2G|1|The horn does not have the electrical connectors as pictured - instead it comes with generic spade clips and some wires so you can retrofit the horn to your wiring harness. If you are looking for direct replacement with your stock connectors, look elsewhere - such as the Delco horns like D1920C, D1978D, etc.
B00MGHVRVG|3|Since winter isn't over I really can't give a fair assessment of this product as of yet.
B001UOOY02|5|some happy with the purchase, It looks great and is just like the lightning headlights. Gave my truck a nicer look and I can see better at night with these also comes with headlight bulbs
B000C7YQ2Y|5|I purchased this as an alternative to a locking fuel door. This fit perfectly & easily onto a 2008 Mustang GT. Verify it works with your car before purchasing. Extremely easy to put on once it arrived. Shipping was quick by amazon as always. Item includes 2 keys labeled \\"FUEL\\", so it's nice they give you a spare. My car had a plastic ring that was on my normal gas cap that you just slip off & slip on this one.
B00BEIUIZ4|4|fit was good, quality movement on the faceshield, but there is a whistling in some positions
B002YKFA0O|5|If you are a professional, you know this is the right product!
B0094V6104|2|I previously owned the [[ASIN:B004RCEM1A DB Tech Car Headrest Mount Holder For New Apple iPad 2 WiFi / 3g - Works with all Cases and Sleeves - Includes 5 ft. 3.5mm AUX Cable]]. Both mounts are very similar, I had to check they weren't the same mounts. I'm guessing there's pretty much only one way to make a car mount for an iPad, so the line of car mounts are about the same.<br /><br />Having said that, my DB Tech iPad mount worked out great, but the hinge used to lock it in place on the car seat broke after about 6 months of use. I think it was bound to happen, but it may have been from my son kicking it. The Heininger 1037 mount you have to screw in place, while the DB Tech used tension clips (it was one of those clips that broke). I find the screws difficult to work with, but once in place it's fine. If you plan to frequently transfer this mount between cars, I would find it troublesome.<br /><br />For cars that have angled / contoured seats (read: your child is rear facing) this mount, same with the DB Tech mount, is difficult to place - it's doable, just takes time to get the placement right. It's a little easier with the Heininger mount.<br /><br />When placing an iPad on the hanger I was disappointed with the Heininger mount. Most of the weight is low, not centered, so the iPad feels like it will easily fall off even though it's locked in place. Still, it bounces a lot. The DB Tech mount locks solid, is more centered, and doesn't bounce.<br /><br />Overall I don't like this mount very much. It's bound to break just like the previous one (can someone make one with metal clips, please?). And the bouncing around is irritating! It does work though, but I'd get something else.
B0049OJ9YG|5|Used this to upgrade my 2004 Chevy Express transmission without an oil cooler to one with. Perfect fit.<br />You will also need ACDelco PN 15808430 and 15751207 if you want to do the same.
B0002SRL20|5|Works great just like the old ones..
B0002U5H9M|1|Finally a bumper sticker that expresses how I truly feel about you dirty immigrants!</sarcasm>    Honestly, do people really think that the way to get people to speak English is by posting bumper stickers IN ENGLISH?  I mean, come on, at least put it in Spanish or Chinese or something... IF THEY CAN'T SPEAK ENGLISH, THEY CAN'T READ IT EITHER!
B008AJPMRY|5|Fits perfectly and takes minutes to mount.
B00GXY2SOI|5|The system was boxed with all required items I did purchase and intake gasket kit.
B002G247IG|2|The material is very thin - It is acceptable but I would have liked a thicker material. so so so
B00GHT6RCI|4|Looks exactly like the original....sans the cracked tray on the original.<br />Other than the cracked tray, it's held up fine for ten years after buying the Suburban brand new.<br /><br />Just need to find time to install it.<br /><br />~Jabba
B008KZK0T8|5|Fits my 2011 Hyundai Elantra Touring perfectly.<br /><br />At purchase, the original ship date from Amazon was a month out. They emailed a few days later when it shipped, and the cargo screen arrived five days after ordering. (Ordered Wednesday night, arrived Tuesday afternoon with Amazon Prime.) I was very happy with the speed of delivery. I'm sure they over quote in case they have distribution issues.<br /><br />Ships in packaging. Installation was easy, just pop the screen into the trunk. It is a secure fit because the screen is locked into place. There are release tabs for removal and you only need to press one.<br /><br />At first I thought the black screen would look strange with the tan interior, but the two tone color scheme is fine.
B00J73CJVY|5|Fast delivery. Easy installation
B005OCZ1RQ|4|as it fits, it could have more labels - but thers is enough space for that. To find the rigt size was easy an so, the helmet ist perfect. I tried it in winter in the snow and it looks great
B0013WJT2E|5|This product fits perfectly, seems solid,  and is half the price of the same product that I can buy at the auto-parts store.
B0001EVTGY|5|Great looking bug shield  Perfect fit
B0028PJ10K|3|I have been using these for a year with my double axle toy hauler. In the past i used good old wood planks cut from 2x8's but they took up a lot of space, so decided to give these a try. i feel that they must have the design all wrapped up and patented so its hard for another company to provide competition. I looked into the Camco's but i decided against them due to some people reporting them failing(crushing).<br /><br />Pros<br />Light weight<br />Fully adjustable<br />Easy stacking<br /><br />Cons<br />Price<br />1 set of 10 isn't enough for a double axle trailer<br />The carrying bag sucks. The stitching has unraveled in a couple areas, and the zippers teeth wont stay locked together. I gave up on the bag and tossed it in the garbage.
B001XCBCQK|4|I just got this last week and could't figure out how to fit it. One call to customer service,sent them a picture of my attempt and they analyzed the problem and told me how to fix it same day. I seems to work very well and looks good. I would recommend this to anyone with a wagon.
B001LHVOVK|5|I have already used it on my truck and work van. Great price and came a day early. The manual was easy to understand.
B00BW424PC|5|Does the job but does not fix X-drive models perfect.  I knew this before buying it. So still 5⭐️
B00EBQJA78|3|Fits ok, there are only two srew holes at the top, so it wont really lay flat on the mercedes bracket, had a few scratches before I opened the package.<br />Probably would not buy another one.
B000C94EOW|5|proper part fit my 96 deville very well
B004INNEX0|5|I used to be a rainX user, but these were recommended to me and I have put them on all of our vehicles.  They are easy to install and work great.
B000B5QFE4|5|The item is exactly as described.  Works great for what I need it for.  Mirrors fit perfect and give more view. Easy to put on and take off.
B000FQ23ZO|5|Very nice
B003YHX2OW|5|my sister has these and i found them very useful so i got them. Less to no dirt tracked in. LOVE IT!!
B001GJ3FIS|2|it breaks very easy
B007P6VOT8|5|Perfect
B000OITFMW|5|I've had this set for a long time now and it has proven to be very good no complaints here
B000VU91SG|5|Fits like a glove, and great non skid finish. Heavy weight keeps it snug. Excellent price about 1/3 of what the dealer wanted for the same thing.
B00HZSLFSG|3|This is an okay product. I received mine with only one set of mounting bolts.  The top mounting bolt didnt even fit so i had to find a bolt that would fit. I also had to purchase more nuts and bolts for the other one that i did not receive mounting hardware for. The product description says they reduce vibration, which is completely false because these things shake like no other. They look good, but were a pain in the a**. Would maybe buy again if the price was better.
B000EDQR50|5|We always keep a spare or two on board. Takes care those times when you get in a hurry and break one  on a trip. It will happin to you sooner or later. Quick and easy to change out and replace.
B00NUZ2B2M|1|It was too small to fit on the grill. Disappointed
B001GKVZAW|5|Great product and easy installation
B000UA2LKM|5|I was a bit worried about this when i bought it but it fits the 2002 japanese cr-v RHD automatic model perfectly !!!
B00BOE9R96|3|the trunk spoiler is high quality, looks OEM and definitely feels it.<br />the only reason I rate 3/5 and not 5/5 is because the ad said hardware was included, and I did not receive any hardware.<br /><br />but the product itself is A+
B001THP2I8|3|I was excited to try M Seal after researching paint sealants online.  The label on the bottle is different from the picture on Amazon and the Chemical Guys website (both showing the M Seal in different lettering compared to my big block lettering M Sealant).  Probably the same product just an older label or maybe a knock off product.  The sealant did go on/off easy and left a very nice shine on a black car & a blue car.  I haven't tried my silver car yet.  Just beware you may not get the most current version of the product or maybe they just have different labels for the same product.  I posted a pic on the product page showing the bottle I received.
B004XG2FBE|4|Great fit easy install!!
B004A6I2RS|4|Pleased with radiator now my heater is working
B004LYR4FK|2|I was not impressed with the amount of light put out by this product. Three fairly low output LED's that aren't sufficient for much of anything - barely noticeable in an outdoor setting over even light starlight.
B0073WZSNC|1|turned copper after awhile, but added some character to the bead too. would like to find another one in stainless
B00DM2SK50|1|Not a 13&#34; light... it's as long as the 15&#34; light I bought and returned.
B004MS9VTW|5|do yourself a favor and grind off the head of any pin you are looking to remove and the job goes much easier.<br /><br />The tool then worked fine for pushing out pins, pressing plates and riveting the new pins
B00464FANI|2|Item described as a fit for my 2003 Nissan Murano; it wasn't.  Blade constructed of thick plastic which didn't allow it to flex and fit.
B000BTLXMO|1|As soon as the product arrived, the logo attachment fell off! The build quality is lousy and it keeps falling off repeatedly even after reattaching. Buy any other product; don't waste your money on this junk. A keychain should supposedly be extremely simple to make. Apparently not for Au-tomotive Gold.
B00MUF1APW|4|Loved the lights. They are very bright.  But one quit working after about 3weeks
B001M1A0XI|5|I Love it, people would always ask where i bought it from and how much it was. It made my helmet come to life and made me stand out from my friends when ever we would go out for a ride. It comes with its own adhesive but i put some krazy glue over it just in case. Ive never had problems with it but the only thing you should consider is that my helmet did not fit in my helmet bag after putting this on, but thats not a big deal to me. Overall Great
B0079SGJAG|5|The starter fit just fine . I'm very happy with it. The service was great, delivery was right on time .if I have a need I will call again.
B001H1QCI0|4|Decent deal for the stuff I needed!
B000JSRZC4|5|Although the item was returned since it didn't really fit my cruiser needs, I did get full credit, less shipping.  This company is a quality vendor with reasonable prices and I will continue doing business with them regularly.
B00280BL9O|5|Not much to say about this, it's the right size and it works well. It's perfect and it doesn't reinvent the wheel, everyone shoudl keep one in their car.
B006EGAIII|5|Awsome
B0009YDQCG|5|I am at a loss to explain the previous postings on how these excellent quality floor mats have a rubber odor.   I ordered two sets of them (one for my Honda and one for my wifes BMW) and both of them emit no discernible odor whatsoever!  They look great and are 100% easier to trim than the plastic floor coverings.     As with any cutting the standard advice prevails.  Measure twice, measure again and then cut once.    I almost cut the wrong grooves but after relaying the mat, after each cut, got all of them to fit as if they were molded for the particular car.  They trim easily with a standard pair of kitchen scissors.     IMHO, can't find a better mat at this price.   If there were odors Rubber Queen must have changed the formulation because both of my sets (delivered separately and in two different colors) have no odor at all.
B00563QWCG|5|I bought my 2003 Ford Focus used, which meant that it didn't come with the remote for the keyless entry. I shopped around and the dealership wanted close to $100 to supply and program the remote. I found this remote and bought it figure that it was cheap enough that i wouldn't be too disappointed if it didn't work.  When I got the remote and opened the package, the instructions were simple and straight-forward. I took the remote and instructions to my car and it literally took me about 20 seconds to program the remote. I have had the remote for a few months now and I am still very happy with it.  I would definitely recommend this product!
B001JK1A4K|1|Thought I had solved my garage parking problem. Worked well for a few months and then the lasers started to get very dim and now they are worthless. Of course the warranty is long gone. China junk! When will I ever learn!
B00HVHG0VI|5|Superb item....even better customer service!  These are wonderful!  At $250+ for my Jeep key fob, this is the perfect way to protect that investment!  This does the trick and in a very stylish way!  Thank you so much!
B002V31GOI|4|Pros = Sizing was good, lightweight, great idea.<br />Cons = Fleece quality could be softer, wish battery would last longer, works best with another layer over it to maintain warmth.<br />My husband works outside and wears this under his heavy work coat on cold days...it definitely helps!<br />I steal it to play Frisbee with the dog...I like it too, but expensive.
B000EVWDAK|3|The instructions for the code reader were pretty vague, but I got it figured out in short order.  I read the trouble code, brought the code reader into the house and hooked it up to my PC.  Again, the instructions were vague until I got to the part where if you wanted to download the code for possible solutions, you had to buy a subscription in order to get any kind of input on how to proceed, based on your code.  So, I already paid for the diagnostic tool, and now the vendor wants to suck me in again.  I don't recall seeing that &#34;minor&#34; caveat when I purchased the unit.  I find this method doing business, very sleazy.  I compare it to the cable companies or car lessors methods; very misleading.  I have not decided whether I want buy the subscription at this time.  It's listed for $29.99 for one vehicle per year.  Who knows what else I'll have to buy once I get the subscription.
B004BCLBJM|4|I like this product very good product
B001XCBCQK|2|If you've got a very small car and very staid dogs, this may work fine. But it's thin aluminum piping, and the side extentions don't have much umpf.  On day one my black lab figured out she could squeeze/bend her way past the quite flimsy side extentions (which were almost maxed out extention-wise in my SUV) and I came back to the car to find her sleeping in the front seat.  About a half-roll of black athletic tape later, I'd shored up the various pieces enough that they side extentions don't simply move out of the way when pushed, and the dog has given up (though my tape job took several iterations before I finally dissuaded her).  I've been in pet stores where I've handled MUCH sturdier partitions (and have an older one in my other car); if I had to do it over again I'd spend some more money on a better quality product.  If you have an active or mischeivous dog, and really want to keep him/her away from groceries, or keep that wet dog hair off your leather seats, you'll need something else.
B0051VMIC6|5|This is the best battery and the best deal a black battery with cheap white print is available at your local autopart store for 70 dollars
B001KS2PXQ|5|this was for my Daughters Rav4...1/2 the cost of the dealer...I'm pleased.
B00BLYWNYU|4|Perfect fit, performs well.
B00HFQH0X2|4|All the instructions are in what I think is the Chinese language, but it is easy enough to figure out. I do not live where it gets frigid cold, but I find these seat warmers to work very nicely, they seem to heat quickly which was something I needed.
B00E3X56R2|5|Very nice and great price
B00FQY5UR8|5|excellent
B002G1QG3G|3|Hi. As others have said these gloves run really small, and the elastic around the cuffs is tight. Let me say this a different way. the gloves fit about right, I wear a x large which is what I ordered and when on they feel good. But they are hard to get on because of the tight elastic around the wrist. They are well made and look nice. How warm are they I don't know, it's February in the Dakota's, so not riding right now, but they are pretty thin not that, that will predict how warm they are...<br />  WHAT I WANT SAY IS the rain guard nylon thing- a- mobbies are useless. The opening to slide them over the gloves is tiny and will never fit over these gloves. A big guy might use them as a prophylactic, but they are too short..<br />  I bought these to go with the same brand of jacket for my son's upcoming birthday they are nice gloves.
B002L2QLZ8|5|Bought this item for indoor staircase...I'm up and down during the night and have dogs that move around also during the night...sometimes at the top of the stairs or lying down on one of the landings....not wanting to put on lights to wake anyone up would have to move slowly so I wouldn't trip over or step on any of them....This was my perfect solution..the motion dector range is perfect...lights stays on just long enough so not to overdue on the batteries...I have owned other led lights for this area...they just ran through too many batteries....very happy with my purchase..
B001C6JCQO|5|Part was exactly what I needed.  Instead of replacing the whole release motor assembly on my 95 S10 Blazer to replace a small plastic part that finally gave up after 20 years, I bought two of these for an extremely reasonable price and Prime Shipping.
B00EYZ6IP8|4|Product came and was pretty easy to install. Only complaint was that the stock screws for the rear tail lamps were too short to screw in. I went to a local hardware store and got longer screws to make it work.
B00VZ3YRO6|5|awesome product and awesome quilty fast shipping and great price...
B00BA1SWXA|5|I love my Bad Wolf Decal.<br /><br />Stuck perfectly on my back window and hasn't faded or moved in a year of various Nebraska weather (from -20 to 100+).
B004Y9YIU6|5|Worked & look awesome lets see how long they last
B00NMQMKLG|5|These guys are awesome. I ordered an LED package kit for my 2009 Jeep Commander. They shipped everything I needed for the install. I actually was sent a couple bonus LED bulbs instead of the correct dome light fuse style bulb, but after contacting them about it, they immediately shipped me the correct dome light bulb the same day. Awesome customer service, awesome products and my car's interior looks great. A+++
B003CJC78O|1|Cheap thin. Horrible Quality
B000CAXU9G|5|My old filter was who knows how old.  When the body is rusted, it's a sign that it's too old.  I swapped this one in, and picked up a couple of miles a gallon!  (When I opened it up, the old filter was really dirty and clogged.)  If you haven't replaced your filter in a few years, or don't have a clue how old it is, do your engine a favor and let it drink properly.
B009G5EVVE|4|These item just what I was looking for
B003ZJUDD2|4|After investigating this issue  accept my apologies for my past review cause the problem doesn't came from unbeatablesale inc.  But from the manufacturer. I think the product is good.
B0027IFUOO|5|Used this in my 1964 Huber Maintainer. Installation was a breeze and fixed the issue of no gas to carb.
B00HCQFJL0|4|Just got it. As advertised. Easy install, just one strap around base of headrest. Now will see how long it lasts since I have no little kids to yank on it.
B00FWP8QBS|5|Works for me!
B00SVXS3A2|4|Great design and much, much cheaper than Polaris
B003ZIXKMO|5|They look and work great on my 2014 Chrysler Town and Country.  I've already noticed a difference in the interior temperature when I leave the windows cracked.  NOTE:  take your time installing them.  The adhesive is sticky (as it should be), so make sure you position them correctly before pressing down.
B00FW1DRZC|5|Looks good.
B001NQKH76|5|good
B0078SZRQO|1|I was very disappointed by this...First of all it's FAR too small to be functional. And secondly, it's very cheaply made.. it feels like a very thin plastic and makes a very junky clinky sound. Doesn't even hold well.
B002UY0IJM|5|Works great in a 1989 Diesel F-SuperDuty.
B002VPFIRC|5|good product
B00EWSE5HA|5|Perfect replacement. Absolutely recommend purchasing if your sun-visor is broke or sagging.  Great quality and a super easy to replace; just a screwdriver and 10 minutes you will be finished.
B00HBV4YUI|1|Poor quality.<br />It cracked and tore on bottom while I was putting it on the tire.<br />It's cold out but that's not a excuse.
B006ODTQFW|5|Item as described
B008SF5QHG|5|This is an awesome deal. It was exactly what I had expected. I have recommend it to friends and family.
B00L847UL4|4|perfect fit on 2000 F150
B00029KA8G|4|Nice quality, but took forever to do my first one.<br /><br />I guess once you get the hang of it, it won't be so time consuming.  The holes where the needle threads through are very, very small, hence the difficulty doing the job.  Make sure you bring your glasses, as you will need them to see the holes.<br /><br />Otherwise, nice product, well made, and everything there to give you a new feel steering wheel.
B002M3P828|3|I used this with the  Curt 18100 Aluminum Cargo Carrier with Folding Shank.<br />It worked rather well at first. We took it on and off the rack 2-3 times and the 3rd being back at home when we returned.<br /><br />***Major things to consider:<br />When you're on a rode trip you may need to take it off for overnight as you maybe in a hotel or someplace not so safe to leave on. So we took it off. The material was very durable to carry the cooler, the camping stove, 2 beach chairs, a small size folding table for the stove(very small), the gallon gas for the stove, 2 sleeping bags, a large tent that is rather heavy, and another back with lanterns, and small stuff.<br /><br />So my wife and I were able to carry it into the hotel for part of our road trip. Then we put it back on the rack for the rest of the trip, and then off once again at another hotel (This time the valet parking did the removal).<br /><br />All this time we lifted and carried, never dragged. But when we got home We noticed the bottom of the bag was scored/ripped up in a few places in one corner. this I can see caused from the items inside, and rubbing in the rack when driving?<br /><br />So, this maybe more of a 1-3 time use bag if your moving it around at all.... unless you use a trap or something underneath the bag. Or you find one with a harder shell like bottom section. Since it is $40, which isn't too much, but it is just a canvas type bag dipped or sprayed in some waterproof vinyl-rubber like material. The zippers were OK, as the way the bag is squared off in the corners, it made it a bit of an effort to get them out of the sides to zip up.<br /><br />We only had 2 days of some rain, and everything was dry. I don't see wetness being an issue even in heavy rain, as long as you use the zipper flaps.<br /><br /> I wouldn't mind paying a little more if the bottom part had specific reinforcement. Otherwise I think it did the job for this one trip, and hope it will last the next one. We will put some tarp like material next time around....Otherwise it would be time for a new bag.arp like material next time around....Otherwise it would be time for a new bag.
B000LP8F60|5|this product is so easy to hang and remove when not in use<br />works prefect thru all of the EZ pass lanes
B000DN7T5I|5|Excellent Kit, Just did a 3.0 ratio Saginaw, This guy has a full write up and a very well explained tutorial. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJ-89YhvAXU
B000C5WCRC|5|Worked perfect on my 96 Toyota Tacoma as the rear sensor. Check engine light went out almost immediately. Came with the gasket as shown and wiring was the exact length as the one removed.
B001CA7X4I|5|wasnt expecting any performance increase cause they are just spark plugs but it did improve startup. nb miata fires up much quicker now
B001AWLTX4|5|Nice good and breathable
B002ZBWKAU|4|A decent tire pump with digital display
B001FCB4JS|5|Love it.  Worked Great.
B00ONHKY2K|5|Looked everywhere for this great price fast delivery extremely pleased and relieved
B002XUXUTS|1|EDITED:  On May 27, it stopped working!  What a disappointment.  As difficult as it was to disassemble the rear of the car to install it, it will be even more difficult to remove it and return it to Amazon.  The hole I had to drill in the car will still be there.<br /><br />I had installed a backup sensor on my car a few years ago, but when I added a radio with backup camera, I foolishly removed it.  The beeper gives you a warning even if you aren't watching the monitor.  I realized that I wanted another backup sensor, and the reviews led me to this one.  It emits a steady tone until you are close to an object.  Then it beeps very fast.<br /><br />Two comments:  the beeper isn't very loud, so I bought another from Amazon.  I've seen lots of beepers like this, and they were all loud, but this one isn't.  Also, the wire that goes from the license bracket into the car is barely long enough.  I had just enough room to connect the bracket wire to the main wiring harness.  Half an inch less, and I would have had a problem.<br /><br />I like the fact that it has two sensors, and they are adjustable up and down.  It's also nice that they give you longer screws for the license plate holder, since it is at least 1/4\\" thick, and the stock screws will not work.
B00BZR3NRO|5|It should be a pair for this price
B00HNHS7T4|4|Very nice roof rack but the mounts did not work with a Suzuki SX4 even though the ad stated that it would. I had to custom build mounts with straps which seem to work great.
B009AA9WVY|5|Watch how to rep.ace on youtube
B00C3OBAPU|5|the style and construction of this jacket far surpasses its price. very happy with this purchase and seller.the compliments i 've gotten have all been positve. great product and seller
B003UZ7RNU|5|The windshield installed easily and looks great. The only complaint is the plastic moulding that is supplied. It is coiled in such a way to make it difficult to install. Otherwise it is awesome.
B00BF0OJK6|5|Perfect fit in my 2008 Jeep Wrangler Sahara Unlimited (4 door)
B00067BWKY|5|This was a difficult item to find in stores.  I broke the lens on my PIAA light this winter and it was much cheaper to replace the lens than purchase another expensive (but well worth it) set.  Service was very quick and the product was priced more than fair.
B0083J7K6M|2|You get what you pay for in this particular purchase.  I opened the box and handled/inspect it and wrapped it back up, put back in box and returned it.  Didn't even mess with installing them.  They are very cheap and most likely will not last a summer with them.  So far I have not found ANY quality mirrors with signal lights for my 2010 R6.  I know I'm not the only one looking.......I think I may need to start up a biz, I'd make a killing haha.  Don't waste your time, your stock mirrors are way more sturdy and safer.  Until I find a company that decides to make quality turn signal mirrors that are functional then I'll be sticking with my stock ones.  Pig spotters and bar end mirrors are something I'm interested in either.
B00JGFV8EM|1|delivered on time... i expected better quality....but i'll have to see how this holds up when i stick it on something.
B000ZAYR68|2|They do not fit the seats well at all, but are good quality material. They keep slipping out of place.
B0053OSBUY|5|You can't change one of these ADPs without these specialized tools, and they seemed to be well designed and well made.  But the one tool I needed for my Dodge minivan, the H10 10mm extension, broke before the bolt came loose.  This looks like the weakest of the various adapters because it has to be short enough for the large hex fitting to engage the pulley and small enough around to fit into the recess.  It's only a 10mm nut besides.  I'm trying to buy a replacement for this piece separately.<br />UPDATE 5/30/14 - I found a \\"Contact Us\\" link on the Gates website and asked them if I could get a replacement for the broken part.  They replied within 2 hours saying if I would send my address they'd send me a new one.  Got the new part today.  It seems to have been upgraded; it is noticeably thicker in the area that failed.  My rating is up to 4 STARS because of their great response and the upgrade.  If I can actually use it to get my ADP off, I'll update to five.<br />UPDATE 6/9/14 - It worked.  Don't forget ( I almost did) that you are unscrewing the pulley from the threaded shaft.  Turn the pulley counterclockwise while holding the shaft still or turning it clockwise.
B006A41IPG|4|ship om time and working
B001AWU6KQ|5|I'm about to purchase a second pair of these for my 2012 Wrangler.  These handles are easy to install and you can tuck the excess strap around the roll bar with a credit card.  Once installed they seem very sturdy and my wife is happy for the extra leverage for climbing into the Jeep!
B00GHSLYN6|5|Fit perfect, easy to install. Looks and functions as original and much easier on the wallet than replacing the entire door panel. Will update post after some time on vehicle if any issues crop up but don't expect any. At any rate, it can't be worse than the original equipment.
B004ZIEKI6|3|Ok.  So, it's a squeegee... The price was a good price so I bought it.  I bought it for the purpose of cleaning the outsides of my apartment windows.  I'm on the 7th floor so, it's not like I can just get a ladder.  The squeegee works GREAT on my mirrors and the insides of the windows where I can pull it downward, like it's designed to do.  But trying to use it on the out side windows and sideways...Not so much!  It would've been nicer if the blade was doubled like some windshield wipers so that I can clean the outside of the windows better with out having to use too many paper towels.  OR have the head curved more.  It's only great for cleaning from top to bottom.  One good thing about it is, the bottom of the handle has a hook opening to hang it, so this was great because I was able to tie rope to it so I can slide it on my wrist and not drop it as I'm trying to clean the windows.<br />This should only come up under automotive and not in the general list of squeegees!  It would be 5 STARS if I were to only use it for my car windows.
B000HDFX7K|4|Works just like it is supost to. It alowes me to do my job better. I would recomend this product.
B00029WVII|5|My recent purchase of these stick-on mirrors is the second set of them I've bought.  The first set I bought have been adherent for two years now and have aged well. They seem to be good optically. Their one curved corner allows them to cover the least surface area of your mirror possible per their size, which is larger than a lot of these mirrors.  The curved corner makes them fit your mirror more efficiently than round or rectangular shapes and just look correct, the way they look on your car's mirror.  They are big enough to give you a good view, without excessive minification of your view through them, and without covering too much of your car's mirror. You can buy cheaper ones but IMHO paying a little more for these seems to be worth it.
B000VI071S|2|it only shows correct direction or close to that data \\"sometimes\\"... most of time it is useless and not reliable!
B004N6YRDS|1|sometime works or comes on by its self
B001UP1F26|4|Seems like a good cover. Used once, so far. Didn't have any instructions. Somewhat confusing, if you have never used. Nice, thick. Well worth the money..
B002ATXTNE|5|Arrived on time, perfect gift!
B000BN3A4Y|5|excellent product - have bought for many people
B004UL5V40|3|the blade is fine. the button is WAY too easy to push. the battery drained in my pocket in a couple days... half the reason for buying is now useless.
B000BQPIGY|5|This is only window cleaning product I have ever used that does not leave streaks.  Cleans great and streak free.  What else could anyone ask for.  Price is well worth the benefit for sure.  Vendor ships promptly and arrives in great shape.  I ordered the 12 pack.
B00405U8CG|4|Fits pretty good, but not as good as same brand purchased for other vehicles I have owned (Toyota Tundra, Nissan Maxima both were great fits).<br /><br />The problem I have noted is that the left and right vertical edges curl away from the windshield and the screen also flexes inwards across the width of the windshield.  This creates a fairly large airspace between the windshield and the screen.  The resulting airspace creates in-effect a small greenhouse which accumulates heat inside the vehicle.<br /><br />Although I wish the screen was slightly wider so that I could &#34;wedge&#34; and lock the left and right edges behind the window trim, it is still a well made and effective sunshade.
B003VMVH7Y|3|I liked the look.  I ordered an xxl so I could layer under it if I needed to.  Even with the adjustments it didn't fit well and the pads were not where they lined up well.  An xl is probably all I needed (I'm a little chesty so I thought I could get away with it).  Seemed very light weight for summer riding.  Didn't love it so I returned it, but I didn't hate it...
B000CITK8S|2|Bought in Feb. 21/13 used it four times .It stopped working Feb 20/15 .Amazon will not return it and it has a five yr. warranty.I would like to have it replaced.
B006R7PHI0|5|As described.
B0000DYVN9|1|Just opened up product and put in car.  I believe it's defective because the mechanism when plugged turns on but the part that determines heating time clicks on then turns off within seconds.  I thought that the blanket would heat up, in spite of the mechanism clicking off, but the blanket did not heat at all.  Would like replacement to determine viability of the blanket.
B0090Q5NCA|3|Easy to install than other sun shade I purchased which close at center of window shield. This is one piece unit and middle part sags.
B002DU3TTO|5|Needed this extension to hook up the 4th bike.  Works great.  For my own situation, it would have been even better if it were a pig tail, but it serves my needs.
B003FO2O1G|5|I purchased this after replacing my old RV TV's with digital flat screens.  Took about five minutes to install.  I live in a canyon and got 40 channels in the first search.
B00BHD6710|5|Very cool
B00EEKQA2E|1|Did not fit as advertised.  Vevy low quality.
B00433SIQI|3|haven't used it yet, but looks like it's got everything i need, I used baby soap in a spray bottler, and a decal blade  before so hopin gthis steps up the results some.
B000WMRYP0|5|Amazing
B0070Y35GU|5|perfect fit, easy install
B005032988|4|Love it!
B007BL4W8M|4|This item will work as an acceptable replacement for the oem part.  The fitment is not as good as oem and it is made differently.  The issue with my original grill was that the clips on the black part broke.  I thought I would change the &#34;chrome&#34; pieces out and use the new black piece but there were incompatible.  I was looking for better matching of color with the other side and possible a better fit.  A person walking by would never notice the difference in fitment but when you are installing it and looking really closely you can see it isn't perfect.  Overall, good part for the money.
B009M3BHP8|5|Fit great and very durable love these !
B00CXADGQ0|5|fits perfect, great price
B005FA5W26|4|Really nice Vinyl sticker. My only complaint is, however, it was a bit hard to place. It didn't want to stick at first and the thin parts were completely horrid when trying to remove it from the paper. But once on the surface I was placing it on, it worked beautifully and I haven't had an issue with it sense.
B0013VT5N8|5|This is a heavy clear cover that does exactly what I needed it to do. Used it to cover a front plate that I adhered a small licence plate sized quilt to (my wife is a quilter) and it turned out real nice. Note: buy Cruiser Accessories 81230 Locking Fasteners to go with it; dresses it up nicely
B005G21GUK|4|Simple install. As far as swapping out with previous version. Had a little confusion with the remote as far as getting it going and turning it back on after it times out. Does not come with instructions. Operating or instillation. There are some on the cover of the junction box and some on the back of the remote but weren't covering my issues. I was able to get some PDF instructions off the internet and all is right with the world. Works great.
B0002MABGE|1|Have tried several times to select the english option by pressing \\"1\\" on the automated menu so as to navigate towards making a phone call. It offers the option for english speaking customers. Will not allow you to select that option. If you are not a chinese speaker, that makes this card pretty much worthless. Maybe they should make that clear before one purchases the card.
B0057VQWQS|5|Excellent item only thing I do not like is the tie down straps, I will be looking for and purchasing something else to tie this item down to Jeep
B000M1DFZE|5|The flashlight was exactly as expected and works excellent. I have another one of these already. I work as a mechanic and rely on my flashlights and work lights all day long. This will be my second at the shop and I will be ordering a third soon. Thank you for this product.
B00IOMXK94|5|Looks amazing and the holes shown in the picture aren't there. They are holes are like dimples you can drill out to add switches if you want to add switches
B001NZKPS8|5|Plugged right in, just as advertised.  About the easiest installation ever.  Took all of 15 minutes, including the installation of the controller. 2007 Chevy Silverado Classic, 2500HD
B00520G9C6|5|So cute! Quick service. As advertised.
B001UKOGLS|1|Front seat fits just fine, back seat is a pain in the neck. Ford Edge 2007<br /><br />I only have the front installed and haven't had the time to waste figuring out how to get it in the back seats. It shouldn't be this tricky to figure out or install these, they do feel cheap and I'm concerned about them being able to protect vs spills.
B008LO4H4C|4|You cant buy this stock for even close to this price........puts out slightly higher energy than stock. Which may not sound like much but in small engines that are trying to get all they can out of it .........at $11.00 how can you go wrong
B000TV59EC|1|doesnt break down very well
B001TYJOG2|3|They are okay at best. You get what you pay for. The front covers fit my 2014 Fiesta well. The rear seat cover was a bit tough to get on and I ended up ripping one of the straps off.
B00B5LM9DY|5|These covers are great & easy to install...they give the car the same look as offical stitched leather..very pleased with is purchase
B00E5OUOCQ|4|Between all the &#34;Jumboness&#34; in the description and the fact that I have a Ford C-Max (not the largest vehicle in the world) I (wrongly) assumed that it would be plenty big enough. It's not a totally wash as it semi-covers the windshield but it's definitely not a perfect fit. I would recommend you take some windshield measurements before buying it as it seems to be for &#34;jumbo&#34; sports cars or the largest Fiat 500;-)
B0015Y9358|4|This spare tire cover is a good value. It fits well and does what is advertised. Get your money worth.
B00KTHT4EW|5|Good quality. Works great.
B001P20XZE|5|You own a H3 you need this for that little extra space your missing. Holds my sun glasses, loose change, and iPhone quite well.
B00HAG5XHW|5|Nice size
B00280BL9O|2|This gauge only goes up to 50 PSI which is not documented anywhere. I wanted to use it for my car and my bicycle. But since my bike tires are 80 PSI, that isn't going to happen. I would have happily paid twice what I did for a device that would measure higher pressures. And at the very least, it should have stated it in the specs.
B003CWFP9E|5|My new car cover is doing a great job - a perfect fit + protects my red 944 against sun, rain and birds.
B0013REXO8|5|Solid and stable. Good quality. Easy install. No complaints at all.
B000GZPCYI|5|Works perfectly
B000F5DQWY|3|I couldn't use this in my Honda Odyssey because it is too bulky to replace the horns that are on there now.  I could put it inside the engine compartment but then it will be quieter not louder.  Take a good look at the dimensions and make sure it will fit.  You'd think a minivan would have room for this, but make sure you can get it where you will want to put it and that you can access the wiring to connect it up properly.
B00AG8DZ80|2|6.0 diesel truck has been running very rough. Come to find out two injectors are missing. Had high hopes Rev-X would help. There was no apparent change in how the truck ran after driving with additive over several days.
B00EEKO99K|5|Works perfectly. Exactly as advertised
B004BWI2RG|1|This part is not even remotely close to an OEM replacement. This part's threads do not fit the 2007 Yamaha FZ6.
B00HS4A4NO|3|Cools very well but the BRICK in my back that you call a back massager had to go. Thanks to a pocket knife to the seam and cut it out. Now VERY comfortable.
B00HZBPLI8|5|Awesome! !
B000XQ9MGE|4|The Clore JNC300XL 'Jump-N-Carry' 900 Peak Amp Ultraportable 12-Volt Jumpstarter is compact, lightweight and convenient to use. The removable front flashlight is a nice feature.
B00EBQJA78|5|Great product.  good price.  arrived in like 2 days instead of 7 as promised.  Doesn't get any better.
B00067BVKK|1|Absolutely horrible, I installed them, hated the color, yellow , and output!! Not much light at all. Wasted my money
B0002JN2EU|5|Seafoam is the reason my old pressure washer and lawn mower and chain saw continue to run well passed the end of their lives.
B00JFQGS4C|4|Great little novelty.  My bride likes rabbits so it worked for me.
B00YME6LU8|5|The front looks nice with the white letters which will not rub off. Didn't like the white around the back so cut it off.
B00ZSAXX24|5|Easy to hookup good directions works fine
B001LMWQ44|5|Love it
B0041RV1D8|1|I purchased 2 of these in October 2010, the first one broke in early December. Now in January the 2nd one has stopped working. The lights come on saying it's on but never gets warm.
B000NBVFN2|5|This wrench did the job for the plugs that wanted to come out without the special puller. The tool is also extremely handy for putting new plugs back in to the engine.
B000O5N9ZE|5|I bought this for my nephew, very cute sign. Sturdy. Good buy, looks exactly like it's picture, arrived very fast.
B000UKHG1G|5|Fast shiping and best prices
B005FG64U4|4|Despite a few inner bulged marks and a slight scratch the replacement  tail light worked well and easy to install.
B004YRQ7T8|3|pricey version of what basically is available non brand name at less cost. Fit was a bit tight over what I expected. water soaked liners/shirts/poly vests, whatever work well. I couldn't say this one works any better than the competition. My riding buddies use the vest approach which on second thought is easier to use as you do not have to remove your primary shirt to soak. scared a few people with my white belly!
B001Q4XIHG|4|Very nice and mounted well on my honda 2013 foreman. A little tight on my prized rifles, but very secure.. I would reccomend..
B0009IBJE4|3|I successfully charged a car battery using it.  It was very easy to tell when the charge was complete as well as if there were problems.  The diagnosis of those problems were a little hard to decipher.  The manual is not written well and the error codes displayed on the device are not in the manual.  I had to search for the information on the web.  Once I found the information, it wasn't any more helpful although they do offer an 800 number if you need assistance.  However, the hours were inconvenient      The process was initially frustrating because the error did not occur for about 3 hours into the charge.  I finally slowed down and hooked up the battery *before* plugging in the unit.  It would only successfully charge the battery when this was done.  Overall, this is a great product.  However, the documentation could be more clearly written.
B0056DZNS0|5|I've had them on for two years and am very happy with the easy install and great looks.  I have had many comments about the extra step for access to the rear of the box on my 2007 GMC 2500HD 4X4.  Bolts and washers with the kit were the wrong size.  I cut new larger washers from Tractor Supply conveyer belt material and used original GM bolts.  I just side swiped a tree stump and they saved the door.  I am going to replace with same.  My only change would be to move the door step pad 6 inches rearward.
B008JTAABI|4|This is a cool product. We purchased it as a gift for christmas, and the build quality is awesome. I'd buy it for myself.
B00527Z664|4|I have only used it once but seems to have no trouble charging phone, ipad or operating laptop off of it.<br /><br />Almost seemed to quiet for the unit.
B004HAAPRC|3|They work as described but I had to file the edges to make them work and the gaskets they came with are pretty cheap.
B00AN9Q0O8|4|it works out well but i didnt know that you had to put it together and please make sure you have a wrench to tighten the bolts.
B00IICYTDG|4|strong
B0006JLV5I|5|I have a fiberglass sided trailer that is a year-round live in under dirty trees.  Over the course of a year, moss, dirt and water streaks commonly develop.  This stuff, a soft bristle brush, and a little elbow grease make the trailer look as new.
B00K9BBQ5I|5|cool sticker
B00C1U2GYA|1|Poor workmanship, liner is glue on and peel off at the edges.  Arrived in an envelope with the front flip pressed down.  I would not put it in my Porsche.  Do NOT makr the same mistake as me
B000BOC2E2|5|It was getting to the point that I was filling my tires 2 to 3 times a week. I took the worst of the tires and soaped it up. The leaking was coming from around the bang-on rim weight. I called up my local tire repair shop and they wanted $25+ to dismount, clean and remount the tire to fix the rim-leak. Since all four tires were leaking, it would cost me over $100 (with tax, etc.) to have all tires done. Then, I remembered Slime, and asked a guy at the auto parts store if it worked. He said that his tires were leaking like a sieve all around the side-walls, which Slime fixed. IMPORTANT: He said NOT to follow the instructions on the bottle and, instead, put in 8oz per tire for 24 in. tires. That is roughly 60% more than recommended according to the instructions on the bottle.    I was able to buy a 32oz bottle for around $9.00 where I live. When I got home, I got a ruler, placed the bottle upright on a flat surface and measured the amount of liquid in the bottle. I made 4 marks on the side of the bottle with an indelible marker -- dividing the contents into 4 parts (if the label goes all the way around the bottle with no gap, you will have to peel some of the label off so you can mark the bottle directly and see the remaining level of fluid inside as you squeeze the contents into each tire). I then took out my hydraulic jack; jacked up one side of the car in order to relieve the weight on the tires when deflated, then removed the valve from the stems in the two tires on that side. After all air was out of the tires, I squeezed in 1/4 (8oz) of the bottle into each tire, screwed the valve back into the stems, re-inflated the tires and dropped the car back onto the garage floor. I repeated this procedure with the other side of the car. All-in-all, it didn't take me more than 30 minutes to deflate all four tires, squeeze the slime in and re-fill them with air.    I then took the car out for a drive -- to work the Slime into all the crevices of the tire and rim. There wasan immediate difference; and, within a few days of driving (because it takes time to work the slime into all the nooks and crannies) there were no more severe leaks. It was the first time I was able to go for more than a week without having to fill my tires. After 3-4 weeks, the tires are holding air and I don't even have to top them off anymore.    Interestingly, just last week before Christmas, I noticed that one of the tires on my wife's car was flat. Luckily, I noticed it while it was still sitting in the garage. I filled it up with air, and it was flat the next morning. I filled it up again, and it was flat that evening (it was getting worse real fast). I took the tire off and soaped it up like I did on my car. Wow! There were leaks all around both the inside and outside rim (must be all the salt and below-zero weather). So, like I did to my car, I slimed it and filled it up with air. I drove it around for about 10 minutes and parked it. A few days later, it still read the same pressure as I put in it a few days earlier after I slimed it. A few days later, I did the other three tires.    As I figure it, I saved over $200 in rim-cleaning & remounting costs for 8-tires with two $9.00 32oz bottles of Slime.    Also, be aware, that since there is so much slime in the tires (way more than the directions say to use, as explained above following the instructions from the auto-parts guy), at speeds over 35-40 mph, the tires will be a bit unbalanced for about a mile until the slime evens out from centrifugal force -- something that I have no problem living with, since it saved me over $200. After about a mile, everything smoothes out and the wheels automatically fall back into balance (kind of like those centrifugal balancing weights used on 18-wheelers). I have driven at speeds up to 65 mph for long durations with no noticeable shimmy or bounce after the slime re-balances itself inside the tires.
B005FYG9RY|5|We are very happy with this buy. We don't need to buy the complete unit. We will buy more sune.
B0099SL2L0|5|Saves me money when I do my own tire rotations and must reset the vehicles TPMS since now I don't have to go to a tire shop or dealer.
B000COMXI6|5|Nice to find this at a reasonable price. Other tire gauges don't work as well with the inside tires on our dually setup. Received the order quickly, without any surprises. This tire gauge is made in the USA.
B00CEXK74K|3|Installation is a little bit tricky. I had a problem getting the tabs all the way up into the top of the window channel. You don't get a complete seal as the front edge is outside the window track but the tabs are inside. This leaves a small gap where the change occurs that lets in air and water.
B007CMRCKK|1|biggest peace of junk you could buy!!! has no power climbing any kind of hill no fun at all ... i would have to push it up just small inclines with my kids on it to get it to the to flat part of the roads... the belt and chain driven transmition is horrable the way it's set up.... I wish i would have never bought it my kids wouldnt even ride it because it was no fun at all..... DO NOT BUY
B0057FK080|2|it's really really tight for 2013 Camaro. And filtering cloth are thinner and looser compare to the original filter. On the package, it says it has activated carbon layer, but it doesn't.<br />  Because of its poor filter cloth, I got an genius filter from the Dealer.  it turns out the genius filter is made by ACDelco, which is also available on Amazon with about 20 dollars.
B003VAWQYY|5|Works great. This stuff dries pretty fast and usually smooths itself out fairly well, recommend that you use on warm days and seem to work better if in direct sun. Fill cracks in various plastic parts or any void, this stuff is great A++ This product will no doubt last a long time.
B001J8M79E|5|Honda uses Titanium intake valves and aggressive cam profiles. The intake valve springs become a little weak after use. This causes the valves to float and slam the valve seats. The seats then recede into the head. Since the valves now sit closer to the cam lobes, the clearance closes until there is none and you lose compression and power. Exhaust valves don't seem to have the problem, but when it's time for them, the Kibblewhite full kit is worthwhile. Kibblewhite valves and springs are a solution for long term reliability and reduced maintenance. You need both the Stainless valves and the springs. Typically, these valves and springs will last 4 times longer than stock. When you have finished riding and store your bike, take the pressure off the springs by leaving your motor at TDC. This will prolong the life of the springs, also. No, I don't work for Kibblewhite....I don't know them. I just know what works and why. I understand Ron Hamp has a similar kit with great reviews.
B004ME8MZ0|5|Work and fit great with no vibration while driving. I have a 26 foot camper and I can see very well around the camper.
B000IDUW5C|4|I bought a yellow two-pack.  One fires, one does not.  Amazon has a great return policy, so I am replacing the one that wont fire.  It is a smart design, much smaller and lighter than I imagined.  It is only slightly bigger than my car's key/remote.  I prefer to keep it in the center console, and the bright yellow makes it easy to find.
B0077UETY4|5|excellent
B0077T23IO|5|Needed a set of stands for doing light maintenance. This price can't be touched by any other bike stands. Similar products found in the motor sport section of \\"box\\" stores will charge double or triple. Easy to put together and work like a charm. Using them on a CBR600RR and I can easily lift the bike by myself no problems. No issues with shipping, product arrived in under a week.
B008RNBEE8|5|Perfect fit on my 2000 DB8 integra and reduces vibration on from my hasport motor mounts. Gives you clearance to use carbon fiber intake.
B001KRAQ7E|2|Quality is good, but where's the bracket?? Try and find a BMW E46 caliper online that doesn't come with a bracket. It's just not the way they are commonly sold, and if you didn't realize that this one doesn't have the bracket, you're gonna have a bad time when you get it in the mail.
B00A48FCHO|1|Blew the fuses 3 times in my 2013 Mustang brought a new style LED bulbs and they worked great would not reccomend
B000C9TVJK|5|I LIKE OEM
B001BSAXFM|4|Hard to find these days, but a very useful tool.  Doesn't take up much room.  Fits under your seat or in a glove box.  I put one in each of our cars.  Great for sweeping out sand after a trip to the beach!
B00I7X2VBI|5|This gasket was the cheapest I could find.  I ordered 2, so I'd have a spare on the hook, just in case.
B0075FU2G0|5|Excellent
B001CF3JG4|5|In the defense of other reviews about these:<br /><br />These are NOT &#34;Top Knotch&#34; deflators. I have mine set at 18 PSI for my 31x1050x15 A/T's, I probably could go lower if I wanted too, but I don't really care on the A/T's, haha. These are not completely accurate, which I'm good with. Set at 18, some tires will be 17, some will be 19. Some will be right at 18. It all depends on temperature, as far as I can tell. But, seriously! For $40.00 bucks, being off 1 PSI in each direction? These are awesome! I just screw 'em on, and go socialize with my jeep buddies. Or help other people deflate. Air'ing down, I really don't care if it's off 1 or 2 PSI, it's not that big of a deal. Putting air back in, I want them all even.<br /><br />I would highly recommend these. There's no reason to spend 80, or however much the &#34;top knotch&#34; ones are. These do the job just fine. Follow the directions, set them with your spare. And you're next wheelin' trip will be cake if you air down!
B005I5XYC8|3|Took a try or two (to program) but eventually worked in my 2001 Ford Crown Victoria.  I had a the key cut at Ace and it's a little stiff when unlocking the car, but a decent backup key.  Also, you need two working keys to program this one.
B007OA8IX0|1|Gave off very weak light.  Not even close to the yellow in the ad.  Looked more like a dim white.  Super fragile.
B00C1NW4HG|5|my wife loves it
B00GLJYLKO|5|Exelent
B008CJXEPY|5|It was too difficult to learn which headlight were best fitted to the nissan. Now everything is clear it most beautiful headlights. Very easy to install. Do not use lamps coming with headlights, they are useless.
B000C91EWC|5|Works great bolted right up had for bout a month now and no issue at all shipped and arrived 3days early which was even better would recommend
B005Z2H15K|2|Corners of frame too rounded so plate sticks out too far. Couldn't use bolts provided, had to buy longer ones at hardware store. Covers won't stay on without glue. Design is fine looking but fit is bad.<br />Saw at Walmart for 4.95!!!!!!!
B008VLVDII|5|Very Nice!
B001UC8WMA|4|Good product. Worked fine in my 2005 Town and Country.<br /><br />Took a while to catch the programing but finally it worked fine.<br /><br />I recommend product.
B001M5RLX6|1|I had the same problem as the last guy's comment.
B00JPZEG8S|5|They really add a lot to the look of my Jag!!!
B001P275YG|5|We're good.
B0026JJWWK|4|The springs in the blades are a little bit strong so I had a problem with contact of the wiper in the center of the blade on my 2011 Toyota Camry.  I had to bend the wiper arms on the car slightly toward the windshield so that the the wiper blades made full contact with the windshield.  This was true for both the 20 inch and the 24 inch blades.  Otherwise, these blades with refills work great. These blades look similar to the original equipment blades that came with the car.
B00RXVDJKC|2|Quality could be better
B0041CAECM|5|Look and work great!!!
B009PHDY98|5|ok
B000WJPGTE|5|Product was out of stock but was sent the next best thing and it works great thanks
B003V3PZOY|3|I bought this to replace a Clay Magic kit I had used up.  The Groits clay is very mild... too mild for my liking.  It many more passes to remove contamination that took only a couple swipes with the Clay Magic.  The other thing that I did not like is that the clay stuck to my fingers and hands even when using a spritz of the spray on every section.  I had yellow clay stuck to my hands for a couple of days after using it.  I never had this issue with the clay magic.  Overall I give it three stars because in the end it did accomplish what I wanted it too - remove contamination from my cars paint without marring it.
B00B4VKQD0|5|Excellent cover, fit perfectly.<br />Being utilized outdoor, water repellent, keeing dust out, interior cool during hot days.<br />Best cover, good investment.
B0093XZFPA|3|Meh
B00KBKOAGY|4|Is easy to install and shades eyes.  Could possibly have used more of a solid shade, but this is very useful.
B004M3C130|3|applied and yes it did give some shine and restoration but not as much as expected. but it was still ok. so don't expect this thing to make your rubber look like new but just to improve it.
B001T8H0JG|5|This oil pump brought my pressure up significantly at idle and interstate speeds I would definitely buy another if ever needed
B001GH1PU0|5|Got these to use in mt 05+ Tacoma. They do fit in the blank panels on the left, however you do need to file down the lip on the edges. The switch itself works good and looks good. Has a OEM look to it. The color of the light is okay, but I wasn't expecting much. Easy to wire up, the switches are kinda deep ( compared to others ) so keep that in mind.
B00DNX6G2C|1|Save your $$ cash !!!, don't buy this !!! Took a month to arrive, I actually forgot I ordered it/ it took so long !! Plus didn't work !! Very Dissapointed !!!
B0009IRKM4|4|Look nice on truck
B00332GPOC|5|I put these on my Camry Hybrid, perfect fit and easily installed. I am also thrilled with how flat they are, they don't stick out like a lot I see.
B000ESDGGI|4|Looks great, although I havn't fitted it yet.  I did not realise it requires an external regulator ... my mistake, but easily fixed.  Pity the freight is so much to NZ or I would be using these items a lot more.
B000IYA3YQ|5|Pop the cap covering the stock wiper nut and its basically remove it and spray a penetrating oil into the shaft. Wiggle the shaft a bit and the old arm should pop up with out a problem. Looks and works flawlessly! Also look at the sprayer location to determine driver or passenger side.
B0012WHBSO|5|Viair has always been a great compressor company. I use this to air up after driving on the beach. It's quiet, never blows the lighter fuse, and doesn't overheat. A+ product.
B00AKI45EE|5|These are adorable.
B0091OE6K6|4|This product is well made. I use it to adjust the seat belt to prevent it from rubbing on my children's necks. There is one slight problem and that is the release mechanism, it is difficult to release should you want to move it to a different belt. Other than that I have no complaints.
B000BTKCP8|5|My truck is base model pickup and is sorely lacking in storage space. This product added lots of useful space. The installation took all of fifteen minutes, inlcuding unpacking the box. My truck has a dark charcol grey interior and this storage unit blends in perfectly, it really does look like it came from the factory.
B000CONU1K|5|It's goes to 2014 toyota camry with steel wheels-fit's well.
B00DSD5A5G|1|Die cut was very sloppy around saw blade pattern it pulled and stretched the sticker when I pulled the sticker off of backing it left distorted and lifting areas when applied. To bad other wise it would have been a cool sticker
B0009VIPYI|5|These work great to clean your lug nuts. They get down into the lug nut holes in your rims and do a great job of cleaning.
B009YPGWW2|1|junk
B00CNXQNWG|5|Perfect replacement on my 2000 Dodge Durango. So far they have performed well. Fast shipping and am appreciative that you ship to APO (Army Post Office) addresses. These arrived in Kuwait within 8 days and are a much better product than what's available here.
B004IA3JSS|5|The switch was easy to install and come in different colors. Plus I link to save money. It was 4-5 bucks cheaper than other sites.
B0066QS6LM|4|Good enuff.  When taking off old one which will be corroded in place, I found that taking off the brakes/rotors down to the knuckle was necessary to access the front of the plate for a thorough going hammer and metal punch beating.  Once it loosens a bit drive a screw driver between the knuckle and ball joint mount plate to remove.  Lots of PB Blaster is good too.  Use some anti seize on the new one.
B00IYJ2GJC|5|Great helmet and comes with speaker slots. Not the ideal helmet for winter riding though.
B00IXW0H3W|5|OEM, exact replacement. Awesome quality! A++++++
B004QC64MQ|5|I have yet to install but it looks perfect
B00537FIRU|5|works great, easy install
B000PDI1E4|5|These are great mats.  Super heavy duty and durable.  They even had the mini logo on them.  Perfect fir for the car
B009AA2J0U|4|exactly what i needed to clear airbag light and got my truck to pass inspection, easy install also.
B000JFJM14|2|I ordered one of these for small outdoor engine work.  When the first one arrived, the top was cracked all around the pump.  The box did not show signs of abuse but was not well designed to protect the top and pump handle.  Returned to Amazon for replacement, second on arrived with cracks around all of the bolts that that hold the top to the body of the extractor.  At that point, I gave up and returned the second for credit.<br /><br />Let me say that, from the markings on the box, this was shipped directly from the the supplier, not from Amazon.  Amazon has always done an excellent job of packaging items it ships and they have always arrived in great shape.  I am sure  they will follow up with their vendor to assure better packaging in the future.<br /><br />AS ALWAYS, AMAZON stood behind what they sell, they apologized for my inconvenience and treated me with respect, the way a business should, they are the best!!!!!
B001E6WBAG|5|i'm not a hvac guy so I think the 4oz should last me the rest of my life.  Better and easier than thread tape which i should never have to use again since the tube is so large.
B004UPZXQM|5|Very shinning really after applying it on my old bike.<br />Good water repelling quality. Extremely easy to apply as well.
B000CI1LL2|5|This is a gear-reduction starter like the 1.6L Suzuki Sidekick uses, and is rated at 1.2 kW of power, vs the .8 kW stocker.  It spins the 1.3L Samurai engine over much quicker than the stock starter ever did.  This helps the engine start faster and more reliably.<br /><br />It is a brand new, not rebuilt starter so there is no core charge.<br /><br />I've been running one for over 2 years now, and it has been doing great.  It is a great upgrade.
B006N93158|3|Sound looking ball joint but very tight fit on the bushing side.  It didn't go in as smoothly as expected and needed some help going into place.  I wish the design was like the passenger side. It was much easier.
B009UOIC52|5|Good quality helmet great visabilty priced approximately thirty dollars less than motorcycle dealer all around nice
B0041CG336|3|This item is hard to determine if you are taking to much air out or not enough.  The feel doesn't change enough for every puff of air you let out. Overall, I set it and was able to ride for over 300 miles with minimal discomfort on my M109r.
B004PC28Z4|3|They're a bit loose, but they look cool and work fine... Worth the money.
B001RBQF4G|1|These hooks are tiny enough that they catch on each other and make the net a hassle to use compared to other ones we have owned.
B002CJE38M|4|I will admit that this is not the cheapest code reader on the market but I know this it's paid for itself many times over. I have had a few issues with an older BMW and have saved quite a bit by using the reader and narrowing down the problem. It simply allows me to figure out the root problem and not replace perfectly functioning parts. You can spend a lot of money at the BMW Dealership or Independent Garage or you can use the reader and take pride in doing the project yourself.
B004C443KI|5|Great heavy jacket. I ordered 2 sizes up, fits great. Smells so good.
B0028JW4PU|5|good product, good price, fast delivery.
B001Q399RA|5|Recived as decribed
B000CQDPE0|5|This thing is a monster of a hook.  It looks like it belongs on a crane, but its pretty legit on my truck.
B004XM4Y80|4|It was a easy replacement, so far no issue starting the car in cold morning. Great product for asking price.
B00BD4SO7I|4|These are cool, colors are cool and thin material for washing. Do have problem with the seat part staying in place, the little hooks they sent don't hook to anything actually
B000IG3QUM|1|I bought this for my car. It was a complete piece of junk that was hard to set and then stopped working in less than a week. It ended up in the trash.
B001EP2904|5|good quality
B007ZDDUCK|5|Well I was asked if I wanted to try this product and give an honest opinion.  So here I go with my thoughts on this item.... It was just what I needed to get the seats in our caddy back to almost new.  We had beenlooking the right stuff for sometime and when I got this offer we said well why not.  It has put life back into my seats.  I was worried they would start tearing soon and now I am not worried at all.  They feel great and I am about to try it on my babes leather coat next.  Thank you
B005WWOL9C|5|Exceeded my expectation... easy to install.  Great cost and great product and very heavy duty. Now I need to add my winch!
B001T9JW9Q|5|exact fit like the original
B00BLX1L4O|1|really cheap. hate it
B008A5XX9M|5|The part fit very well into the the trunk.  I was able to replace the lock in about 20 minutes with no problems.
B004HOGEVO|5|excellent
B0094DEG7M|5|the perfect pink!
B000EJV5N8|4|Have tried this for 2 weeks and seems pretty good.  Need it for my many toys.  Decent product.
B000C02B3W|5|This is a great product and I have used it for the first time and got the exact results that I was looking for.  I used it on a motorcycle trailer prior to painting it, and am very happy with the results.
B005ASZHAK|5|This is a high quality trim pot that feels like it's built to last. I will be using one for variable boost and variable launch control with my Megasquirt EMS.
B000SKV4T8|5|I have used Mobil 1 on all my vehicle's for years and after buying a new to me, HD 2010 ultra Limited was pleased to see the they also made the V-twin moil 1 for it. I call them to ask what makes this a better product than the OEM oil that HD sell's and they explained that it is specially formulated to meet or exceed the requirement need with air cooled HD engineers as well as trans and primary case requirements. I believe that they manufacture a superior product and will be only running it on my bike.
B001DKRKGS|4|it is cheap and bendy but holds any cup I've put in it and has never spilt one so I recommend it
B000CD8IEK|4|good
B00KN0UOEE|5|Bought this 303 to clean my softtub.  works great.  will buy it again from Amazon. Good price there.
B000BYB7H0|5|Installed in Lincoln Town Car to fix engine shudder under load.<br /><br />Easy replacement and OEM quality.<br /><br />I have had issues with aftermarket coils before so I now stick with Motorcraft OEM
B000I8XDAS|5|I got this just in time for the final lag of winter. My battery has stayed toasty warm even with the temperature dipping down into the low 20's. It is best to Use a 10-3 extension cord if you do not have an outlet close by.
B001MT0XPK|5|Work fine with whose vehicle:  Kia sportage 1998 DOHC  Honda CRV 2001 iVTEC 2.4  Mercedes ML350 2000  Opel Astra G 1997
B0016KH14Q|4|It looked like this hitch would work just fine, however it said it would fit my 2002 Grand Prix GT but it does not.  It will fit an SE because the plastic bumper is different between the two trim packages.  If it did, I would have liked to keep.
B001MXL71A|5|At the time I purchased this I was traveling (for business) to Nevada and Arizona a lot. This pump is very strong and was able to inflate a flat tire without any issues. I removed the valve and let the air out as a test of the units ability to actually work in an emergency. I have only one complaint, the cord needs to be two feet longer. I used a jumper cable so the pump can reach the right rear tire (battery located just above the front right tire). Outside of the cable length, if you have an emergency or find yourself in a parking lot with a low tire, it is comforting to know this pump will get you where you need to go to patch or replace the tire.
B00G0LZQSO|5|Worked on 2011 prius III drivers door
B00BTGSGFK|5|Haven't use ityet  but appears to be a good item that will last.
B00JWOO2YK|5|my 300 looks so good at night
B008I2MLWM|5|Similar to OEM but much cheaper even with shipping.
B001W6LGGS|5|Great back up camera for the money, really helps hooking up trailer, also seeing people while backing up. We will see how long it last.
B0068C4KPK|5|i think this is the best 20/50 oil made for bikes that take 20/50  ive used castrol in all my cars an bikes for over  35 years i
B0000AY9KE|5|My strap broke so I bought this one to replace it, the brackets was a nice addition.  I recommend it.
B000FGVGWA|5|I have tried multiple cleaners, bought and home-made, to get the permanent fog off the inside of car windows. This stuff works.
B00HDT08D0|5|Great!
B00AWNVW52|5|The part is working great. It was a great price. However it came to me late.
B008BYQ240|5|Very good product, it could be better if the flap was velco and not zipped.  When riding I would like to get inside the pouch easier.
B00E5OUOCQ|1|Does not stay on the windshield. Barely stays close to the glass by the rear mirror. Not recommended.
B007JIDLKC|1|Does not fit a 2001 Toyota 4runner as it claims!  Spend the money on the OES Genuine Antenna Mast.  Then they will charge you 1/4 the cost of the item to send it back!
B007HXYDXI|4|For the application I used them for they don't work that great. I have them as my backup lights, they don't offer much visual illumination. They fit and work great from third person perspective.
B00U7FV5HU|2|First of all the white LED didn't work, it would only turn on for an instance then turn right back off. Didn't fit 2014 Chevrolet Sonic
B002X91VTU|5|Got these for $40 they were a great buy and I do not regret it. These things are brand-spanking new!
B00KTJ1FKQ|5|Easy to program. works fine
B008TUNAGY|5|Great helmet for my 5 year old!
B003BZD03K|5|New washer did not fit close enough to the wall with the new hoses that were installed.  Husband looked in our area stores but they did not carry anything that would work.<br />Found this item online here, ordered, came quickly and was just the thing we needed.  Elbows put on and washer moved closer to the wall.
B003U2RMYC|5|This switch was exact replacement at a fraction of the Toyota part price. Make sure you know how many &#34;pins&#34; your (Electrical Connector)  has. There are two versions , one with 14 pins and one with 18 pins. I assumed they were all the same and  ordered the wrong one the first time.
B001U2D6NA|3|We purchased these lights as an owl deterrent for our purple martin colony.  They worked well to ward off the owls, however we noticed a lot of moisture accumulating in the lens & one eventually stopped working after only 2 months.  We're not sure why since they're supposed to be weather proof.  We didn't have them mounted so maybe that's why the moisture accumulated behind the lens & the one stopped working.
B007PP2DMG|1|This item was listed as &#34;new&#34; . They both arrived scratched, cloudy, and barely reflective. This is the worst product I have ever ordered from Amazon. I threw them in the trash. And have ordered a different blind spot mirror through Amazon but from a different company. Very disappointed in the Amico mirror<br /> MD
B001P2B7P4|5|this is a awesome product it fits perfect an looks awesome on the jeep as well.
B0041LN1L4|5|Awesome!! It really works. Only thing is if you park behind a big truck, it can only protect your car so much as the trucks bumper is higher than a sedans and will go right over it and scratch or dent the hood of the car but you can't really do anything about that. This is one of the best things I purchased for my new car.
B000C709FW|4|I used a suction pump to bleed the breaks and the car pulls to the left, turned out to be tires.
B001T9CG94|3|I was very impressed with the results when I used this product. Unfortunately after a couple of weeks the repair doesn't look as good as it did. The damage is starting to re-appear. It still looks much better than it did before the repair, but I'm wondering what it will look like a few weeks.
B006TMM0ZG|5|very good and prompt delivery
B00E1TTFLQ|5|Great exhaust note fit perfectly nice little boost in acceleration ,terrific quality
B000GAQ1IY|1|Does not fit a 1998 Honda CBR600 F3. From my impression of the description of the product it made it seem like it would in fact fit. Waste of money. Never again..
B00DOP5CK6|2|Brought for my 2005 Toyota Matrix Hatch, it was a bit cheaper than StrongArm which I easily installed on hatch of my van. Only one end of the lift has the metal clip similar to the OEM part, one end used a wired clip through a tiny drilled hole to keep lift from popping out.  The problem is the hole does not clear the ball on the chassis , so the wire support is useless.  I have contacted Monroe but they can't help.  So I am doing without the wire clip and am looking for another way to keep it from popping out.  Go with the StrongArm, it worth the extra $$.
B00449O5PO|5|Works great! So much better than the Rochester stock carb. It really run and good out of the box.
B00BG9M5GQ|1|Absolute junk! Broke after second use!
B00DMTTSIQ|4|Just received, excellent fit. Good value.
B00GK4XGW4|5|Great price
B00JSCK650|5|works as expected.
B007MFZEXO|5|You have to buy the hoses and wiring but once it's all hooked up it's very loud
B000BRJUTO|5|good quality !!!! fast shipping !!!
B000LG0BGQ|5|It worked perfect. The enclosed<br />Instruction were spot on.
B002R1AB2M|5|All good
B005XBBW1W|5|Great Price...<br />Much cheaper than buying them individually at the the dealer.<br />Will definitely purchase again and keep them in the garage for future oil changes.
B005J1UK2I|4|I use these to level my 1971, 28 foot Avion camper trailer. this trailer weighs about 4,000 pounds full.  Using a battery powered impact driver these jacks open and close quickly and are capable of lifting one side of my trailer off of the wheels fairly easily.  The jacks are well made, heavy duty and look as though they will last a lifetime<br /><br />I downgraded these 1 star because the included wrench doesn't provide enough torque to lift the trailer more than about an inch.  The wrench is well made but doesn't provide a long enough lever to deliver the force required to move even 1/3 the rated weight of the jack.  From a practical point of view I don't understand why the manufacturer would provide such an inadequate wrench but I suspect it is for liability reasons.  Replacing the provided wrench with either the impact wrench (as I do) or just an ordinary wrench allows these jacks to reach their full potential.<br /><br />Having stated that I sometimes use these jacks to lift a trailer off the ground I need to caution people to NOT lift heavy objects if you do not fully grasp the possible negative impact of your actions.<br />- The kinetic energy stored in lifting something heavy is MERCILESS, DEADLY and FINAL.<br />- Plan ahead and think through what WILL happen WHEN something goes wrong.<br />- Do NOT put any part of you body at any time (not even for a half second) in the path of a falling object.  The worse OFTEN happens.<br />- Always provide proper blocking strong enough to withstand the weight of the object being lifted<br />- Remember &#34;Safe&#34; equals fun, &#34;unsafe&#34; equals stupid... ALWAYS BE SAFE!
B000BRFGGA|5|great
B00D2PIFAC|4|Great Product! Works great. Everything seems to be working just as the description said it would. I would recommend this product.
B00DR67P9I|5|Very good as a reversing light because of<br />* brightness (far more than the two 21watt bulbs at the back of my car)<br />* low current draw (you can connect it to your existing wiring, no relays or wiring upgrade required. Consider removing one of your existing reversing bulbs - you won't miss it at all if you're using this light because it's so much brighter than your bulbs.)<br />* low profile (it's 6 1/4&#34; wide, 2 1/4&#34; front to back, and 1 3/4&#34; high overall. The spiffy bracket adds 1/4&#34; to the top or rear, depending how you want to position it.<br />The bracket attaches to your vehicle with a single 1/4&#34; stainless bolt so you can hardly see the bracket at all.<br />Since mine is mounted to the towing hitch assembly I've taken the precaution of sealing around the edge of the lens and the cable entry with clear silicone caulking. (other people complained of water ingress, I want to prevent that.)<br />So far so good.
B00CB22B7A|5|A little longer than I expected but it is good quality and a good shade of red. Not as deep of a red as I would've liked, but I'll be keeping this around as a backup. (Finding better colored couplers instead)
B00E7BHON4|5|I got this for a good friend of mine for Christmas and his last name is Brogan, of course.  I was so pleased when I got it.  It was very heavy and very nice.  He was so happy with it and put it on his truck right away.  Great product!
B0082YFC1S|5|Very nice look and fit!
B00AZMI57I|5|aaa
B000E24APU|1|not so good
B008VIB7YG|1|lens fell out first time use,on highway.
B002NTA28G|5|Delivery was fast.  I received it three days after ordering it.  Installation was easy - took about 10 minutes.
B000KKPFFA|5|Worked just fine.
B00IX5MOD0|3|&#34;12&#34; x5 - it is made solid but IMO it lacks brightness, Better for lower cars not SUV..  B U T  I'm using them to it without the logo inserts as regular puddle lights, 80% brighter then led replace bulbs.
B004SSB5CW|5|Got it on time. Just what I wanted. Could ask for more.
B008H08LQU|5|this is the brightest panel I bought yet. Bright white w/ very little blue. Very happy w/ this and will buy another
B006QD3WVY|2|I ordered two.  One was thick and plush.  The other felt like a cheap imitation (thin and sparse).  The plastic strap holder broke when I was trying to lengthen it.  The backing has foam, and I wonder if it will mildew.  The ones I bought from another store had a cloth backing, so the seat never mildewed after 13 years.  Very disappointed, but more trouble to return, so I kept them.  It will at least keep the seat covers clean.
B0068B7PSK|1|The picture shown and the product number are correct but when I received the liner it was completely different from what was advertised. Customer service was terrible with the attitude of not wanting to get me the correct item. Probably my last purchase with Amazon, I will stick with people that specialize in the product not internet companies that don't have a clue about what they are selling. Good luck if you buy this item!
B004M2BV8M|5|good price and very nice looking
B008ANT9LK|5|Exactly what I was hoping for.  Multiple lengths.  Fit tight.  Work well.
B000AP1MUC|4|Fits my '05 Pathfinder fine.  I ended up averaging 17.2 mpg in the 2000 miles since I installed it.  What was my mileage previously?  17.2 (yup, no change).  I probably don't drive in such a way that the engine is airflow limited, hence the relatively good 17.2 to begin with.  Still, I'm happy that I don't have throw away relatively expensive disposable filters every so often.
B000VBAHIS|5|Excellent product with tailored fit, great color coordination, and fine protect for the front passenger and driver's side foot space.
B000BUQOEU|4|Works good, helps control awning, had to replace one starp already since purchase would recommends better sewing quality for strap
B00BI9IP86|1|BAD QUALITY WINE ME THESE VALVE DAMAGED. LOST MY MONEY. SHOULD REPLACE THE MONEY OR SEND ANOTHER !!!!
B004W4ME22|4|The lights arrived on time and surprise from Spyder, the box had installation instructions in it! These were fairly easy to install even without instructions as the power lines are red & white and the negative is black for the HALO and LED lights. The turn signal, side marker & head lights easily connect with the factory connections. With the installation complete, I can say that the headlights do look great and help the \\"blackout\\" look I'm going for (to get there someday). Now the reason for only four stars; I was disappointed in the overall performance of the standard (low beam) projector headlights. They are not nearly as bright as the factory headlights and the light beam that you see as you're driving both simply falls short (actual distance) of how the factory lights perform and the actual light beam is not smooth, it actually looks like you're seeing like from a broken mirror reflection with three distinct beams of light and a single of the three from each side being much brighter than the other two beams. Of course it is not the same center beam as you would think. The passenger side is the center beam and the driver's side is the inside or right side beam. The bright (high beam) headlights are fine but as it stands, my factory fog lights shine brighter and shine further down the street than the low beam headlights. I've got them and they look good, plus I almost never drive at night so I'm going to keep them for now but if you do a lot of night driving, you may want to look somewhere else.<br /><br />Update 5 may: I tried to get comfortable with the low beam projector lights on this set of replacement lights and they're just not cutting it so I've returned them. Since my primary goal is to do a \\"Night Runner\\" style blackout of my truck and I found a OEM style all black replacement for about $110 less than these which keeps my factory bulbs & style lights which I may later convert to HID. Bottom line, the assembly has a nice look but the projector low beams on them perform like a bycicle light and are not safe for night driving in my opinion.on them perform like a bycicle light and are not safe for night driving in my opinion.
B000C5SG1I|5|Good quality
B004BT2GNK|5|Working OK
B0058WXNOK|3|There has to be an easier way than to use heat to set this product. While it ultimately worked, the little heat sink tool cools way too rapidly. I found the whole repair took too much effort, although the ability to mix colors to match the upholstery was great.
B005WVZFC0|4|great piece
B00JYMJ1SC|5|Sticks very well and arrived before expected delivery date. Came with very easy application instructions. I love it and will but from this seller again!
B00I51L28K|5|great transaction and part fit in perfectly and really &#34;cleaned up&#34; the old look of that gear shifter.
B000TGLE2S|4|I have a 2009 Ford E350 XLT 5.4cl V8 that was only getting 10mpg.  I am now getting over 11mpg in the city, but beware, the engine is so loud at certain rpm's that you might want ear plugs.
B008EN7IDM|5|They work very well
B00BSV76CU|1|Parts of the sticker were cut off
B0091WALES|5|Keyfob worked great.  Easy to program.  Great price.  Fast shipping.  Well worth the money. I would highly recommend to anyone needing a new one.
B0009IK4EK|2|Blade refill is the proper size and fits the application on the rear window of a 2012 Equinox.  However, the blade refill comes with end caps rather than a clip on one of the arms.  Using the supplied end cap leaves about 1/2&#34; gap or play from the end cap to the first arm on either end.  This gap allows the blade to slide toward the end cap on each end as it moves back and forth over the window causing a significant clicking or taping sound with each movement of the blade.  This noise is very annoying, and, may cause one the end caps to possibly come off at some point subsequently releasing the blade from the arm.  2 Stars were given because it fits somewhat, and, after a couple of uses it appears to wipe well.  Otherwise, it does not fit or work well on a 2012 Equinox in my opinion.
B00FF1K7BQ|4|I really enjoy the scent....doesn't quite smell like a new car, wasn't sure how you can bottle that scent anyway, but I definetly like both and will purchase more. I don't think its overpowering at all, as a matter of fact I tend to spray a couple of times a day sometimes, because I can't smell it all the time. But I think it works like perfume and I'm just so use to the scent and that's why as opposed to someone just getting in and smelling it right away.
B0062XB4FY|5|Works as advertized!!  this was my first purchase for this kind of floor mat / liner and I am now a true believer in these, they stay in place and just fit and hold everything in the liner,  PERFECT!!
B001PNC5CW|5|Simple but excellent tool -does it's job as expected. Wouldn't be without it - makes the job of removing the sensor much quicker and easier.
B003A8D6YG|5|Inside my Saturn LS100 and under the radio, I have a small storage area, however anything I put their would soon come flying at me any time I accelerated, stopped or took a sharp corner.  This pad solve that problem with ease.  The pad comes with two sheets of plastic on it, which I kept on until I did a dry fit.  It was about a half inch too long, so I grabbed a pair of scissors and cut off the excess.  After taking one sheet off, putting it on then taking off the top sheet, I now had a usable are to put my stuff.  Works just as advertised, I just don't want to take it out, because it may take a lot longer to put back in.
B000GKIE4S|5|This is still the best hone you can get for the money, whether you are cross hatching or taking out material.
B000I1KJT8|5|These pliers works very well and are made very good. They are definitely worth the money. These are the right tools for the job.
B000C5PZP8|5|Awesome!!  These plug wires are an great replacement over OEM wires.  Made my car run smooth again
B000BPSW7C|4|Did a good shine !!!
B0096UAYPG|5|Excellent. Great value
B009DJV56C|5|Good part easy to install
B006CRT72W|5|Bought my F-150 and it didn't come with a keyless entry remote. When I did some research and found out it should, I searched and found this. Cycle the ignition 8 times to get the truck into programming mode and hit the lock button. It programmed right up and worked like a charm. One of the best things I've bought for my truck.
B00CXBBAK8|5|it was a great fit
B007ZQG4UW|4|Great kit!!  Head Gasket quality is first rate - best of all 6.0L Power Stroke head gaskets on the market.<br /><br />This is Not the Black Onyx gasket infamous for so many failures. It is the same OEM gasket with blue sealant with improved sealant material that is now colored black.  These where installed with APR Head Studs to ensure no more failures on the truck.  OEM EGL cooler failure causing cylinder vapor lock was the source of the OEM head gasket failure.  Installed at 121k miles along with improved EGL cooler (bullet proof type from different manufacture).<br /><br />Would have given the set a Five-Star rating but for lack of schematic or list detailing where the less obvious, nearly identical, and/or smallest seals should apply.<br /><br />I definitely would not consider purchasing any other brand of set on the market.
B001NZYQEW|5|Worked great, bolted right up to my truck. However, you need to buy either muffler studs or bolts for one of the flanges. My truck had studs on the old part on one of the flanges that was downstream that doesn't come out.
B007D5480S|4|Fit well.  Easy to install on 2010 Prius. The powder coating on the hitch had significant chipping, which most likely occurred BEFORE shipping. The shipping container (cardboard box) was undamaged and did not contain any paint chips.
B002C7DSIK|4|I just received this yesterday so I gave it 4 stars since I haven't used it yet. I'm sure it'll work perfectly for my Nissan Xterra since the back is lined in plastic and things are constantly sliding everywhere. I like the fact that you can lay it flat or use hammock style depending on what you are putting in the back. I did a wide search for this net and Amazon had the best price and the best reviews.
B0089FGG1K|5|Very comfy. Sizes fit right in line with what you commonly use. Hard knuckes are awesome, good luck not trying to punch friends with them.
B003ZABBO6|5|No more cracks on my Lambo's lower front bumper.  I wish I would have found these 2 years ago!
B001TJ3FEY|5|I drive a medium size truck where equiptment must be tied down. This product fulfills the DOT requirements and is sturdy and well made. I highly recommend it.
B0019COQ6C|5|ALL GOOD!
B0052FRXU8|5|I liked them except the little plastic door piece that covers the screw didn't come with it, but they replaced the broken door handles just fine so no complaints here.
B00BYH6C1E|1|Disappointed. Not theproduct I thought it was Difficult fitting between seats of Lincoln. They keep working out. Overpriced. Would not recommend.
B001U6DMSK|4|This was a gift for my daughter.  She likes them and thinks they look great in her Equinox.  They were a little tricky to install.  It took 2 of us about an hour to install.  Be ready to spend some time in the floor board while hooking the seat covers underneath your seats.  The good news is, once you have them in place, they stay put.  I would recommend this product.
B0002CO9MQ|5|The lights themselves are great. I caution you to avoid these lights if you plan to use the factory fog light switch in a Jeep Wrangler JK. Do some reading on the Jeep forums about fog lights on the factory fog switch before buying these for that purpose.<br /><br />After lots of reading, I got them working on the factory switch. It requires soldering a capacitor to your relay and using your factory wiring to trigger the relay. Fun stuff...<br /><br />Great lights though
B001JT1OGU|5|Can't say that log books are fun, but this cover makes them much less a chore.  Well made and attractive.  I'm very glad that  I purchased.
B000WK4ESW|5|S100 is the only product I trust on my motorcycle, works better than any of other products I have tried.
B000BKEBO0|1|Didn't work for me
B004RIUZ4M|4|I liked it more than my son did
B0019WRHWW|5|fit very well with jeep liberty 2012
B000SKYV20|2|This compressor does the job, but, the time it takes is more than I feel is acceptable.  I wouldn't recommend it.
B003CK75LC|5|the instructions were easy and the patches were easy to apply and the rubber cement adhered well and dried fast.
B001AIZ5HY|4|Worked very well. Enough to do headlights on 2 Honda civics with some left over.<br />Only wish it came w/a sealer.<br />Follow the instructions! Hint: sand more than you think you should for the 1st sanding step.
B0009XQUKC|5|I buy a lot of stuff from Amazon and I have never had a problem returning anything so here's my advice to you; buy it and try it, if it doesn't work; return it for a refund, even if it is open and has been used. No other web site allows you to do this!
B00FRKJF0Y|5|The toughest and most durable rolling bag
B000CNJAOC|1|Look at picture posted here. Now look at fan blade I returned. Not the same. Wrong bolt pattern & wrong rotation. I need fan blade exactly like the picture.  Joe Laub
B001DCF6IA|4|Got 2 of these for my 2005 jeep  grand cherokee. They work good, fit exact. The only reason i gave 4 stars was cause i thought they would be faster in opening my back tailgait door.
B0009PSA4O|5|excellent product<br />i would recommend this product. it gives an excellent view of the skiers etc. clear and well built
B004AQZUX2|5|This works on my 2005 g35 coupe. It is cheap and it works. Make sure not to touch the bulbs with your bare hands. wear latex gloves or something of that sort. A side note: if there is too much vibration or u hit a dip in the road, the bulb might go out because the filament isnt designed to withstand impact or vibration. If this happens then just turn ur lights on and off again and it will turn back on.
B008X02JIU|5|Great product as described.
B002K6IELO|5|Always buy me aftermarket bulbs from maxlux . Never a problem , always ship on time and the work just as good as stealership bulbs .
B00F9VNPC0|5|Straight up OEM replacement on my 2012 Chevy Equinox.
B00496QJRE|5|Perfect fit for 1998 LS1 Trans Am.  Easy to install with basic tools in your garage with minor mechanical skills. I am a retired dentist and had it done in no time with no leaks. Replaced pulleys and belts at the same time for summer only Trans am.
B001Q8IXW2|5|Works with every waxs, compounds, applying treatments, even lite scrubing. Wish some stuff like synthic wax would wash off pads better, other than that good pads.
B00FALVU8A|5|Chemical Guys Vintage Butter Wet Wax did a great job on my year 2013 clear coat painted mid-sized sedan. The Butter Wet Wax  was creamy enough to be put ON my microfiber cloth as opposed to soaking into the cloth. It is important to clean the car with a cleaner that doesn't also apply a shine. You only want to clean the car before applying this wet wax. You don't want a layer of wax or polish. After the car was clean and dry, this wax went on smoothly without running or dripping. On the other hand, it was thin enough to easily spread on the car. I was able to actually cover the entire car with a thin layer without the wax getting too dry by the time I buffed it. I don't recommend this approach as a section at a time is best but it did demonstrate for me that this Butter Wet Wax wasn't going to be a hassle to use. The results were excellent. The shine was impressive. I recommend this product.
B0018PSASU|5|Applied to back of rear brake pads. On my car two weeks. No complain.<br />Time will tell how it compares to other-brand brake lubricant I apply on front pads.
B005Z8HAUK|5|I have Hummer H2 tires on my Yukon and I live on a beach that you can drive on, so airing your tires down and up frequently is required.  Those other 12v pumps took way too long to do the job, but the slime does it in a couple minutes.  Plus, I constantly refill my ATV tires with this puppy, which makes the battery clamps, instead of a cigarette lighter plug really convenient since I don't have any cigarette lighter sockets on my four wheelers!  This is a quality made piece with the speed and power to inflate four large off road tires in a decent amount of time.  This was a purchase well worth it because I really needed it and I frequently use it.
B00317BWH4|5|Worked perfect on my 06 Harley Streetbob I was already changing the fork seals out so i decided to put in the lowering kit.
B000FW4MJ8|5|good value!
B00DO93SOY|5|If you want not annoying while you are cruising with no cabin drone and to unleash the beast when you are ready this is the exhaust. Couldn't be happier with my purchase. Exaclty the sound I wanted. Just follow the instructions during install and don't try and be a do it yourself hero like me. Added an extra hour to my install being hard headed.
B00MWNZ1JI|5|Works as intended.
B0033DMGP8|5|Actual gates kit that has the good belt. 05 OB XT limited 2.5T.
B000P23HZS|5|I have three of these smart chargers already hooked up in the garage keeping my batteries fully charged and ready to go.  I just purchased another item that has a 12v battery that will need to be on a tender.  No brainer says stick to what works - the BatteryMINDer.  I like the pigtails that bolts up to the battery terminals so connecting and disconnecting is a breeze.  I haven't lost a battery yet so it must work.
B000UK5QSQ|3|I thought this would be good for cold weather motorcycle riding to keep my breath from fogging up my glasses, but they still get fogged up... And my face was still cold. A regular bandanna works better. This would be good times when you don't need glasses. Like shoveling snow or something.
B004Y0YAYY|4|The product was exactly what was needed.  The only issue was that I had to drill two holes into the lip for the resistor to fit correctly into place.  Luckily there were several half drilled holes located in the required position.  After the holes were drilled, the part was installed and function restored to the fan control knob.
B003PL9KKC|4|Although it's not quite the same quality as the OEM item, it is a perfect fit & looks nearly identical to the original. I'd definitely recommend it.
B004RNSLYS|1|Due to a loose bottle cap, oil had already spilled about 200ml when the package arrives.  The cap seems loose from manufacturers factory, because there is no traces that manufacturer's original package is opened during transport.  Oil itself is good.
B0012SCXHW|5|This is a must have for the DIY mechanic.  I changed out 2 Oxygen Sensors for my 2004 Xterra and it worked great.  It took some serious torque abuse.  Saved me the cost of having a mechanic doing it.  It pays for itself plus some on the first oxygen sensor change you do. FYI, make sure you put a little nickel anti-seize on the oxygen sensor threads if there isn't some already for the next time you have to change it.  It will glide right out versus seized corrosion.  Bottom line: very happy with purchase, great quality tool, great value - would buy again.
B001BK04B8|5|Great mirror for the price mine were broken came quick fit perfectly functions as it should
B000JFJLP6|5|Outstanding item; very good service with shipping.highly recommend.
B004131E1Q|5|ates not enfe  for my rack  i need all seal kit for the pinion and rack
B005QMBBAU|5|This tow rope is perfect for the trunk in case of emergency. This one went in my daughters car...hopefully she won't need it...but if she does, it's there.
B00JGX1CHC|4|This is a great little unit. It indicates when the battery is less than 80%, when it is over 80% charged and when it is full -then it stops charging. It takes a couple hours of charging - even if it's 80% full. I have a 2002 330ci and plugged it into the cigarette lighter, draped the cord through the door and close the door gently on the wire (w/a towel draped over it to protect it). Then, extension cord to the wall - outside but covered parking. My battery drains quickly because I often take short trips. If I do this to top it up once a week I stay on top of needing a jump. Very happy with it.
B005JU5TUM|5|Worked great
B000OCIUKQ|5|:)
B000BGM2XG|5|I've hear the reviews of leaking, and guess it's just a case by case scenario,  Mine works just fine.  I take precaution and don't man handle the pump just in case.
B004YIVTW2|5|Easy to install and looks 100% better than the factory shifter. The car should come from Dodge with this.<br /><br />Highly recommended!!!!
B003WWRCS6|5|My bike is garaged so I can`t vouch for the waterproof part but it is a very well made cover.  Fits my Hayabusa well
B000P17NXQ|5|Awsome break system! Does a wonderful job! Was a replacement for the one stolen outa truck! Works jus as good as original!
