B0053HPKG4|5|These are perfect!  Got them for my Four Winns 17' boat.  The cheap plastic ones broke so I got these.  Love them.
B00PE5MIV0|5|Great Plate holder looks and feels great will last a long time
B009R1DQF4|4|I couldn't figure out how to use these on my Toyota. They appear to be well-made, but I eventually gave up and took my car to a body shop ($$$$) for repair.
B008SEM724|2|Excellent fit to replace the original lights on my tahoe but after only being on for maybe a week left light appears to have moisture on the inside of the lens
B0024NSRA6|5|Look nice and fit perfect  but scatters my HID lights unevenly.
B000ALDQDC|5|Such an easy install my daughter put them in herself.
B0015PMZMU|2|5/16&#34; flaring die broke after just 4 or 5 uses
B000UVCK9S|5|Works fine as advertised, but I wanted to hard wire 2 lights to come on with my headlights in both foot wells in the front of the car, because I've always found the remotes and music features kind of gimmicky. After destroying one light so I could view the traces on the circuit board I figured it out. When you strip the outer black insulation you will see one red, one black, one white, and one blue wire. I discovered that the way to do it is: black: +12v, next, splice red white and blue together and ground them. Yes, you read that right.. Black gets 12 volts (don't ask) and the other 3 are grounded. Hope this helps.<br /><br />NOTE: My wiring instructions only apply if you want to bypass the remote! Otherwise, keeping the remote, red gets +12v and black is grounded.
B003DNOSWC|5|Looks good on our trailer
B00FQTG0JK|5|This HeatShield Sunshade is one of the best purchases I have made in my life!  With temps ranging around 100 for the last 5 weeks and parking on a flatlot all day I can truly write that this product works like a charm!  My car will start cooling in a minute after I get in to drive home after 9 hours in the blazing sun.  Even ordered two by accident and the company was nice enough to call me that evening to confirm that is what I wanted - which I did not so I was very grateful for their attentiveness!  It was my mistake.  Customer Service means very much to me.  My mother has purchased one as well for her Camry.  Highly recommended!!  Will enjoy it for years!  Very well-made.
B00G85J02K|5|if audi doesn't sell caps like these, they should. great attention to detail and so easy to put on. keep any provided tools in a safe/memorable spot in case that tire warning light comes on.<br />beats getting original audi items at ridiculous prices... getting all my gear at amazon and ebay!
B008I7NROS|5|Perfect fit and it looks just like the original on my 2007 Tacoma.  The cable was more than long enough to reach and the install was very simple.<br />It wors flawlessly.
B0099JFK2G|1|They work great for the first minute then one of the strips went completely out two of the others will only work on one opposite color and the third strip works on all colors
B004QXRA00|5|It works great and is cheaper than what the BMW dealer was charging.
B00A6GGZ9S|1|Only reason I gave these a one is because it doesn't have a negative star...don't waste your money,,, they squeal like a pig,, even after break in period do not I repeat DO NOT put yourself in a position to maybe have to stop fast because they won't !!!!! GARBAGE,, TRASH, , JUST STRAIGHT UP P.O.S !!!!!
B002DTV172|5|Both battery float chargers the 12v and the 24v were a excellent choice they worked very well.
B0009H51SU|5|Very good
B00G1Y3UME|4|Nice looking items that function great on my 2011 Honda CBR 1000RR.<br />Minor issues:<br />- the clutch doesn't feel as tight as the brake handle. There is some slight vertical play. Not enough to effect use.<br />- there is a seat for which to place the button sticking out for the brakes. This seat can swivel inside the unit. The instruction tell you to make sure it's turned correctly. However, which way is correct? I found out when I took my bike out and the ABS wouldn't shut off at the first corner because it wasn't in the seat. Rotate this item until you see the grove where the button fits.
B00DOHJYOY|5|Have not actually worn the suit to ride yet but for the price and look it seems to awesome. Seems like it will be great for fall/winter rides. I am 6 foot tall about 180, I normally wear a large jacket. However I bought the XL and it fits great. I Think the Large would have been too tight.
B00NN80YFC|4|The easiest available access to a fire extinguisher but it rattles like crazy.
B00AUMY1SK|5|Very bright.  Placed on 2013 Subaru XV Crosstrek.  Very Nice
B006VXNGVK|5|Great!
B00RED6R2G|5|exelent. very nice, thank you
B00JEK5XBS|5|Works as promised and looks awesome on my truck.
B008IK507W|1|Cause I didnt work there was a hole in it
B00IACGK90|4|Works great.
B00X4S6K6S|5|great
B000CIY0U6|5|Fit great
B00L9QXKRE|5|Fit my 2014 Dodge Caravan perfectly.  Worth every penny with kids in and out of the back all the time.  Only down side is the compartments for the stow an go are covered, so its not easy to use these for storage on trips.
B002ZTI5YM|5|Easy to install and remove to clean
B000BRN1Y4|5|Works great! Gets the job done. I don't go anywhere without one.
B008K7PV90|4|Feel nice, fit good overall happy with my purchase
B00Y8SCT9A|5|It works perfectly fine
B00AQ2OHFG|5|Bought this for my 2006 Nissan 350z Touring Edition to replace the rubber oem hose which tends to get hot even behind the protective shield.  My clutch pedal would not return properly and I don't think that the adjustment rod would have fixed 100% so i opted to replace both the master/slave cylinder plus add a Stainless Steel braided clutch line.  Seems to be working great so far.  I will post an update after a few months.
B00TUSXF5U|5|I bought this to replace a shattered passenger mirror on my 2009 Audi A4 wagon.  The mirror was shattered (almost the way a phone screen does) but still intact.  I was going to pry off all that glass and then apply the new mirror.  But I took a chance and just cleaned the old mirror and applied this right on top of the broken one.  The fit was perfect and there's enough clearance for the mirror to still be fully adjusted.  The adhesive tape is super strong - so be careful when placing it!  Very happy with this product.
B00KZ3201O|5|great product
B00TKX6E62|5|made of good material they fit great!
B003KIWCJG|5|Yeah, tire plugs. I used these on my lawn mower. They work great.
B002K75E2K|5|shade was exactly as one guy said but does its job that's all that matters
B009V5BHDY|5|LOVE this...fit my motorcycle perfectly and even prettier in person ...would recommend!
B001O19II4|5|Fits the vehicle, locks, and unlocks easily. Does the job it was purchased to do.
B00B8YCBJ0|5|Looks good, fast shipping
B0024NM5T0|5|easy to install and great performance!
B001W9OP86|5|Perfect fit for a 96 tercel. Good quality.
B003E7H4ZK|5|great
B008BMQYGI|5|Great!
B000C846NW|5|Works like advertised
B007XZK8WK|4|Never got to install them, sold my Jeep.  But they look good & appear to be very sturdy.  Not a lot of the 3M backing tape tho...
B000CPZZVW|5|Fit the need cheaply
B000CO9QO0|5|Perfect
B00062YIM8|5|Fixed my car's issue, that I caused, knowingly...dumb.
B00MGTS1WW|5|Great bag, fit perfectly in my Pro Series 63153 Rambler Hitch Cargo Carrier I also bought. There are a lot of dumb people out there that don't know how to use ANYTHING, I'm sure they had problems. I packed it full to it's maximum capacity on my Pilot and put kids bikes on top of it. It poured down on my way to Florida, and back. Dry, no probs!
B000HWTCBO|5|Good quality product!
B00L3KDUD0|5|Perfect for the hard to reach spots
B000WJ96BI|5|Excellent quality. Perfect fit. Of course you have to know what you are doing to install it. But it's not complicated.
B00PJDGR2I|4|Fits well
B00J44BH4Q|5|It fits great. Keeps my steering wheel cool to the touch, which in FL is a must.
B000II3N7Q|1|the lights are ok but not as bright as I thought also the adhesive side dose not stick good at all I rate this as a 3 from 10 also the switch is junk you need to get a remote
B004I15L4C|5|Great it was want I was looking for.
B00G6FDT7E|5|This resistor fixed my a/c problem on my Tacoma. Very simple to replace.
B00APL7NYK|1|they all fell off within 20 miles!
B000CFUC06|5|It's the best intake for your Hemi engine. The airflow is amazing and it was very easy to install.
B0002YUQ4E|5|The support team at Waterworks suggested this product to me to put yearly on my chrome fixtures. I have horrible iron filled water that stains everything. This product keeps the fixtures protected and looking great.
B00VVF10UW|5|formed real well .
B00LIX9F4A|5|Very nice and new in all aspects.
B008GG7KLW|4|They are the right color and are quite bright but did fit the plug a little loose on my Dodge magnum marker lights socket.
B0048G17RM|4|The dashboard cover fits like a glove and doesn't require any additional adhesion.  However, I did expect the cover to be thicker than 1/16&#34;,but with today's material it may hold up .
B004AIHKT2|5|It fit perfectly and was better than the OE plastic part!!
B000CDADFM|5|fits and works
B00WMK6Z46|5|Fit great on a 97 honda civic good quality matts
B005Y36GUQ|5|Perfect fit! Great price. No problems.
B00D9EKABI|5|Perfect fit and sleek design.
B00ZC20NUS|5|Very creative design. Normally I keep a separate multi tool and a tire gauge in my vehicle, but having this all-in-one tool will simplify the clutter in my glove box.
B005N53C9I|5|Just what I wanted. Was a little worried about the fit but no problems.
B00MG5JAIU|5|Package arrived with all contents as described. Installation was pretty easy. I didn't use the instructions. Its pretty self explanatory. The quality seems great. I installed this on my 2003 Avalanche 4x4 Z71. Measuring the bottom of the fender to the center of my wheel, stock was 22&#34; and after the install it measured 24.5&#34;. A gain of 2.5&#34; and the keys are not torqued all the way in, they are flush with the cross member. The ride did change significantly. It is much stiffer now, which is to be expected- it rides like a lifted truck now. One thing to consider is that by changing the torsion keys out, you're changing the angle of the control arms and it eliminates much of the downward travel. I have ordered Bilstein 5100 shocks to try and compensate for the ride hardness. With this lift I was able to fit 275/70/18 or 33.2&#34; BFG KO2's with no rubbing and no trimming. I will be installing 2&#34; spacers for a more aggressive stance. Review will be updated with results.
B004OI3OZ2|5|Great produce easy install.
B0041MGDLI|5|Can't complain, quieter than the bearings I had that were failing. Haha.
B003B00D1C|5|Highly recommend. use in my 2014 Harley Davidson ultra Limited. .
B0043PZDM8|5|Comfortable, very mobile, rolls well.
B00MQ5Z5F2|5|I started my truck and my Ranger with this battery as well as charged all my devices. A truly great product.
B00573I2OQ|5|I have been using this for about 6 months with no complaints yet.  The battery fitted easily under the tank of my GS1150 and it fixed the problem I had been having with the ABS lights straight away.
B001DRNNHG|5|this charcoal infused filter really makes the exhaust from simple traffic light waiting virtually disappear. Sometimes the smell is so bad I gag while stopped at a light. Not anymore! As long as my windows are up!
B000BZ96MW|5|Met expectations and then some!!!
B00NLQZS7U|4|very fast shipping, light pants, proper size, seem to be okay, but I have not tested it on a bike
B00TZBX1GK|3|This is a pretty good plate rim. It is not compatible with the standard front raised mount on Toyota Tundra Trucks, you will have to remove the raised plastic mount and attach directly to the front bumper as the plate rim will not fit into the recess. I didn't try it on the rear, but it looks like it would work fine there too.  The laser etching is OK, at least the rim is metal and not chromed plastic.
B009VYWIMO|5|Installation  was fairly easy. Just tapping  into your reverse light  circuit might be a little challenging.I suggest getting a tester probe.Nice product the screen is in color and crystal clear. And it's wireless.
B00HRGTTZW|4|Was what i expected
B0043C55AG|5|perfect for my needs, small, compact easy to carry and all the hex bits I frequently need.
B0002MG5M8|5|In my experience, Dinosaur is a fine, customer oriented company.  I purchased one of their boards in 2013 and it has worked flawlessly since then.  I did have trouble with operation of the refrigerator earlier this summer when it would not operate on propane.  I called the very helpful technicians at Dinosaur, and they guided me through the easy process to determine that the problem was a faulty re-ignitor, which I then purchased here on Amazon.  These have been very pleasant folks to deal with.  While I haven't used their warranty provisions, it is one of the most user friendly warranty plans anywhere.  They really don't make excuses or place blame, and they stand behind their products.
B006PAGJXQ|1|I bought this battery charger for use in my shop.  I've used it several times, averaging 1-2 per 2 week period.  It worked well for about 5 months, then completely failed.  I opened the lid to see if anything burned out or a wire came loose.  Everything was in perfect order, so the circuit board must be the problem.  Call the manufacturer.  The phone call was long and not very pleasant.  It was not terrible by far, but I was annoyed by the way it was being handled.  They said it was under warranty and said they would send me a shipping label to have it sent to their shop for repair or replacement, free of charge to me.  2 weeks have gone by with no email and I have called them once.  My biggest annoyance is an empty promise.  Time is money and this company is wasting a lot of my time.  I DO NOT recommend this product for 2 main reasons: 1.) poor quality and prone to failure; 2.) Terrible manufacturer support.
B00252BWOY|5|Perfect fit in my 1997 Jeep Wrangler TJ
B00T7CRMJY|5|Fathers Day present for my dad to replace his last sheepskin cover that has worn to nearly nothing. The material feels thick and comfortable without the ridiculous puffy look like some other covers. Easy to install and fits well in a early 2000's Infinity Q series. Dad absolutely loves it and tells me how spoiled he feels every time he gets in his car. After a lite wear everything still looks good and shedding hasn't been an issue. Seems solid!
B00KTJ2Y88|5|Improved performance and gas mileage. Perfect fit.
B005GSFTSE|5|Great product, fit the holes perfect for the one it replaced.
B003TTTIOI|3|Had a little problem leaking around cap, sent back one but replacement no better, have to tighten the heck out of it.  My old jugs never had this problem.
B00J15J50Q|5|We love this!!!! We often hv to remind ourselves that our fellow South Africans are not just boorish drivers honking at us to get out the way/drive faster etc but simply catching our attention - one South African to another! :) It looks great on our car! great buy!!!
B008G5MD5G|5|Recently bought these for the interior of my jeep they work great as expected brighter than I thought...really fast shipping will buy from seller again..
B000GU13Y6|5|Fit my 1971 Ironhead perfectly
B000G1MBTG|5|I bought this for my 67 year old Mom, to help her get her English Mastiff in the suburban. Very wide, stable and reasonably light weight.  Handles a 140 lbs mastiff with ease.
B002GTKAHQ|3|Fit and work good. See good enough area behind and on side of me. Haven't been out riding to much build still going on and need new tires so holding up don't know about but seem pretty strong.
B00LNIPAIU|4|Delievered on time. Fit perfectly with my seats
B0082X2R30|3|I had to modify the product the Velcro was not very good
B007OW6MD6|5|They do the job.  Hard to mess up a washer.
B001C3K4DW|5|I have never ordered a performance exhaust and it was not my intentions. I have gone through 3-5 exhausts on fords so I wanted stainless steel to survive the salt/winters of Wisconsin. This sounds cool (more rumbly than stock) while not being too obnoctious. It went on well. The biggest tip... jack up the right side a bit. I spent an hour trying to slide the exhaust around the spring/coil and by jacking the side up that same effort took 30 seconds. What was great is you just need to unbolt it on the main pipe behind the cat (close to the muffler) which saves a ton of time. I actually spent 2 hours saturday hammering out an old part from the exhaust not realizing the new one comes with the adapter (doh its in the picture!)<br />need: 9/16ths wrench, possibly 17mm alen wrench or larger standard alan wrench, 15mm sockets. this is my first exhaust change and it was not as bad as I had feared.
B00EC2CKW8|5|I got these at Home Depot and I've used the, to tie down drywall, 40 1x4s, doors, windows, and countless other items all on top my Subaru. I looked them up because I want more :)) 100% recommended
B00QVX14FA|4|Good durable flag. However, they are orange, not red as shown in the photo.
B005NHPBLS|5|Perfect fit for my 2014 Town and Country-S.
B00DD0ZO14|4|Good but the looks is not as same as picture online
B000BUQODG|5|I don't know how we survived with out this item. My camper is so much cooler when we get it out of storage
B0088CNNKG|1|Poor is a good word for this product, they leak, you can't add air through them. Not even close to being worth the price, they did more harm to my tires than good.
B000IYPPCQ|5|It fit perfectly. No problems of any kind. It was kinda easy to put in.
B001CFDDE2|5|This is a great ladder rack, However it sat about 9&#34; above the truck, I was able to cut it down 7&#34; now it looks great. You need some mechanical ability to put this rack together, but once you do you have a really nice rack.
B001KS6FPK|5|Fits well and works well. The price is awesome.
B00ABYVT64|1|What can I say, the bottles look sturdy enough and feel just as great in your hands but I wish they performed as well as they looked.<br />I would like a turning nozzle that automatically switches from stream to spray but I have yet to find one.<br /><br />The hoses that feed the product into the bottle's nozzle is extremely long so you need to cut it so they bend and break over time.<br />The bottles also leak from the part where you connect the nozzle to the bottle. I tighten them as much as I can and as look as I can and they still leak if you put the bottle upside down and squeeze a bit or even lay it on the side.<br /><br />I will be looking somewhere else for a quality chemical resistant spray bottle.
B00032K4FG|3|Kind of cheap, I bought for a front plate and it gets the job done but I'm sure after awhile I'll have to replace
B004AIG714|5|Great.  Worked right the first time.
B000HBNWOI|3|What is pictured and what you get are 2 different things. They seem to have the same specs, except on the back of the one I received it specifically states that when used in sunlight it may turn a dark yellow color and is intended for indoor use only. I didn't want to chance using it in my application and 1 have it fail, but 2 also turn yellow.<br /><br />I ended up going with gorilla epoxy because it says indoor/outdoor - I haven't received it yet so perhaps it says it too dries clear, but turns yellow in the sun.
B0033WDG58|4|works great!
B00429NKWK|5|Finally, something that actually works as stated.  I've tried other brands of headlight restoration kits and most did very little, just barely touched the surface.  I did some research and found that Sylvania Headlight Restoration Kit had consistently the highest ratings.  So I decided to give this a try.  My wife's 2008 Mazda 6's headlights were horrible...they were yellow and you could barely tell the lights were on at nights.  This kit does take some time, about a good hour to do both headlights.  It does require a lot of rubbing with the different grades of sandpaper but you do not have to rub very hard (take your time).  I followed the instructions that came with the kit and there is also a video available online.  When it was done, about an hour later, holy crap, what a difference.  It almost looks like a new headlight.  The lens are still hazy after the final sanding but they will clear when you apply the final step which is the UV protectant / sealer.  I'm sold on this product and now I will be using this again if I ever need to restore any other headlights in the future.<br /><br />Here are pictures of the headlights after using the kit.  I don't have pictures of the before but they looked worse than the picture shown on the box.
B004XJ3R7C|5|love it!
B003VFHSBK|5|Just what I needed to shade the deck on the RV
B00EDFM6R8|5|I was tired of finding the same old blue crappy LEDs for my RV, and these came to the rescue!  These LEDs are PERFECT! I just bought 20 more. Say goodbye to my old, hot, battery killing, bulbs. These are just as white, and BRIGHTER than the 912's they replaced.
B006KZAJ8C|5|Easy install and works properly.
B004PL9BVY|4|I changed out the oil in my 2 stage 80 gallon compressor from 30 weight non detergent Valvoline to<br />Royal Purple Synfilm recip 100, I took the temp. at the hottest part of the compressor head with the Valvoline in it<br />it was 230 degrees. Then I tested it again after the oil change to the Royal Purple it was just about the same, 225 degrees.<br />I did not notice any change in the sound of the compressor.<br />It takes 2 quarts of oil at $19.99 a quart to swap to Royal Purple I hope I can extend my oil change interval.
B00LQ7AFAQ|1|Okay really annoyed will fix my review if they do a partial refund..... After hooking everything up it leaked bad..... non of the flanges were even. i ended up having to have a muffler shop weld the down pipe to the headers an then weld the down pipe to the resionator flang. The machine work on this is horrible. so if you pay the 100 some dollars for the set be prepaired to spend another 80 at the muffler shop....
B005FG5QSU|5|Direct fit. works good. includes bulbs
B00TP0K60K|5|I work in the medical field and love the size of the stethoscope.  It fits perfectly on my MacBook Pro near the trackpad.  It is a way for me to show my line of work and also a way to personalize my computer. Went on easy too.
B00K56PUJ0|3|I used this sun visor a couple days in mid 90's Utah summer weather. I noticed it started to loose shape around the edges like the temp melted it a little bit which surprised me. It is a bubble insulator so that might be the break in shape it takes, just hope it doesn't progress.<br /><br />The graphic is pretty nice though, good colors and good fit in my Subaru.
B0002STTSY|5|Love this tool,  this is the second one I purchase.
B002GOLH50|5|Disappointed  at first, but made lemonade with this lemon. Sure I had to fabricate a bracket and replace the light bulb due to the negative reviews of the light output, but it came out very clean and mean. I installed a H4 HID light system and it is great!
B00FMV0WFA|5|Perfect fit and good quality. Why didn't this come with my 2015 Sierra?
B004BL71JM|4|Did what its supposed to do...great clips
B00M1OUBES|2|Very disappointed in this. Yes it will start a car just fine. But it only has 400mah reserve. We have an isound 16,000mah and it lasts all week. This will not last a day and I'm afraid if we use it, it won't be there to jump the car should we need it.<br /><br />So as a very lightweight jump box.. good. But as a power supply for devices? Not so much.
B000GV3EX8|5|What a huge difference in ride quality!!! I installed these on my 2014 HD Iron (XL883N), even though Amazon says they wont fit, they do.  They have made the height and ride many times better than I could have expected.  I paired these shocks with the Progressive 18.5&#34; fork springs and the bike is now a whole different animal, I can actually lean in and corner aggressively now!  I'll probably have to upgrade my tires and brakes now to keep up with how much of an improvement the Progressive shocks and springs made!
B00757KJTI|4|Turned my Tundra into Mr. Cool...Great look, although reception is a little spotty but what do you expect with a stubby?
B00RNJPXEO|5|LOVE THIS!! We used this when we went to Branson and I know we will use it much more as our family grows...
B00Z1X7H66|4|Very easy to install and holds like a champ
B0043E3HTU|5|I had hard time finding a 4 inch u bolt for my basketball hoop frame.  My pole is 4 inch but all the sports stores sell 3.5 inch bolts. This worked perfect and came the bracket!!!
B00FOGK8PC|5|I can hear better thru this headset than I could with the much higher priced J&M set I had before. It was a good buy for the money.
B003G6V6O4|1|Received in good conditions, Installed them and it only worked for about 3 weeks, one of them went off thinking the connection might as gotten loose, turned out the bulb cracked, which was really weird cause I installed them carefully and it just cracked shortly after 3 weeks.
B007MXK6WK|2|The product delivered is not what was pictured, does not appear to be high quality and the case is damaged. It came from China, not Taiwan!
B00BUICCFC|3|Works great.  Itis used daily.
B00ATFAAYM|5|This light is extremely bright and WON'T drain your battery on atv in a matter of minutes .  great price too!
B00805NGW6|5|great product and not obnxiously loud which i wanted.
B0001WW37U|5|High quality, just what I was looking for, thank you!
B00NKVOZ7U|4|Excellent
B009MCY63Y|5|Wife loves it on her bike.  Better visibility during the day for sure.
B000CMFSWQ|2|Mats didn't fit like they were made for the vehicle.
B000QQD7FS|5|Really good price and worked fine
B00CP6HGNG|5|Worked like they are suppose to
B00BAZCGBK|5|Very good work
B009AQS4IU|5|Love it, just what I pictured
B00Q8CVLW0|5|No choice if you have a Honda. Have to use this brand
B005GLQCKA|5|I use this for retracting pistons on a set of 4 piston brakes and it works flawlessly for that. Makes it very easy to change brake pads quickly and easily. This is a very high quality piece that will last for decades in the average home garage. If you have multi piston brakes I highly recommend this
B005HPKJ3G|5|I just put these into my recently purchased 2009 Honda Odyssey EX-L.  They fit perfectly and look great!
B000276B2C|5|Worked as expected.
B008FCE8IA|5|I ordered this for my 2012 Chevy Traverse- I needed it for a Thule Force cargo box I just bought.  Everything you need is included with the kit- no additional tools required (although a small hammer did help in getting the c channel put in place).  I was able to get the rack and cargo box installed in less than an hour.  Very simple and straight forward process.
B0064DZKVG|5|this product was delivered quickly and undamaged. it fit perfectly. the tube had to be cut to length but i knew that in advance. it fits different thickness of roofs so measure accurately before cutting.
B002UC15G4|1|Does not fit
B00VFA600S|3|Nice little light, very compact with the controller inside.  Unfortunately overrated. I got 9-10W consume on 3 Units I tested, everywhere in between 14-80V. One of the units has slightly different light beam color. If you need 20W, buy 2 of them.
B000GVD686|5|Good perfect A+++
B00290YD2U|5|Great Lanyard
B00KTHZMPM|5|We went to a locksmith and paid $70 for both keys and they work like a charm! It is so nice to have my buttons back!
B0006IX87S|5|Easy to install.
B004FKU3CQ|5|Awesome helmet! Better than the half helmet I did use. Less road/wind noise. Little to big in appearance than I care for but despite that is pretty lightweight!
B00RNI89MI|5|Nice kit. Install of components was very easy.
B00ML7G5X6|5|great
B0007UQ2N2|3|Sometimes it still kink, not as it described
B004ZF44DU|5|Very happy with the lights
B00O0SRA42|5|I received my box the other day and I love them. The only problem was the cigaret adapter was not included, so I went to radio shack and purchased one for 11.00. Other than that, all the wiring was easy and the lights are awesome
B00HEZYVYA|2|Not as bright as the incandescent bulbs that I replaced.
B00CBWL88S|5|Looks sharp but does show smudges and finger prints!
B010TZJUFG|5|Awesome cap, very high quality.
B000EQ3EC6|2|This is more of a complaint about incorrect information than the filter itself. If you have a Mazda3 with the SkyActiv engine this filter will *not* fit your car even though Amazon and a couple of other stores claim that it will.
B0052UBHQE|5|Fast delivery - good instructions - works great!
B008XNZZ7O|5|Works well for taking out unpleasant scents without covering them. Very suitable for car use, especially if your dog rides with you.
B001UMYVZM|1|Did not fit my Honda Element and poorly constructed.
B00TFDDE6K|5|Great product
B0009IQZH0|5|★★★★★▒ Excellent product ▒★★★★★▒100% recommendable ▒★★★★★
B00JKP9TZI|5|Awesome, looks great
B004VR08E6|5|Fits great easy to install
B00IWRL2SC|1|Did not fit
B001IF3XU0|5|works as stated
B004J9OE0K|4|Fits my 2006 STS-V...but was missing some inserts for some cooler line mounts.
B004A34G94|5|This did the trick I was worried at first because the fan was on the opposite side but it worked like a champ
B00O3GT7O2|5|Bf loves it.
B00T0WUNTM|4|Everything came as described except for a few cuts in the corner of my rear windshield cutout, but it was barely noticeable.
B00IP0A836|5|number one
B008F9FBSE|5|Got this for my new car. Looks freaking awesome. And had zero problems with it sticking.
B0055AA3PC|5|great quality fit right 2004 chevy trailblazer LS,
B00PV37ZEA|4|This is a very convenient way to store things in your car. I am not using it as a Trash bin, but to store various toys/headphones etc. my kids leave laying around in the car. The side mesh pockets do not have much elasticity as I would have hoped for. That is the only reason I am giving 4 stars instead of 5.
B00G23UYAU|5|It works great, for security and for a better look of the tires.
B00EN9DOP2|5|It came on time but I haven't used it because it will not work for my application.
B001Q4QO2C|5|easy mounting and holds guns firmly. have seen no marks on any of my guns I carry in it.
B007P2VK9G|5|Nice, looks good on window of my white truck. Lord Jesus Christ son of God have mercy on me a sinner.
B0068ETQOI|5|Very nice product and well built for on or off road. It flows a ton of air to keep you cool on a hot day. It is well worth the money.
B006EGAIII|5|High quality. Low price.
B00KN0UOEE|5|I'll start with a 5 because it actually squirted out. But in the So Fla heat......we will see.
B002M5IQRU|3|The picture is misleading. The filters are plain white and are not made of activated charcoal. I still give it 3 stars because the price is still low and work as well as factory filters. I would buy again if it wasn't for the deceptive product image
B004I8SF5M|5|perfect fit and it was easy to install and they are just like the fctory lights...
B0012TWXJE|1|I bought this tank bag in 2012 for $29.00. It came as advertised and worked very well for my needs. I bought it again in 2015 (the price jumped to $43) as a replacement to my original bag. The design has changed. The back pad (that sits on the tank) is no longer Neoprene as claimed on Amazon. It's now made with cheaper PVC that isn't nearly as soft and seems much less durable. Had I known the product had changed I would have purchased a different bag, but now with two days until my trip I'm basically screwed. Don't buy this BS product.
B00RM327NG|5|Perfect. Using for one month without any phone fall, tested in 3 vehicles. It came with two magnets, one for use inside a case, and the other one if you want to stick directly in the case or phone.
B005CD4GIM|5|Cool antenna balls
B00P0LJ2XK|4|Just as described. felt like good quality.
B001CEJH0W|5|perfect product,.. fits awsome
B004BLAU0E|5|good
B005VJH0SK|5|good product,...wish the high beam was the same color as the HID though
B008BLFHS0|5|Easy to apply
B00QL6OPXK|5|perfect product
B00DFT2HI6|5|The key shipped very fast and I took it down to my local locksmith and told them that I need a duplicate made for my Honda CRF250L. Took them a minute to make it and I tested it and the bike roared to life. Cost me $1 to have the key cut. It feels great to have peace of mind knowing I have a duplicate key that I didn't go broke from purchasing at a Honda dealer.
B004LQR6EW|5|great product
B0096IIWT8|5|Nice fit
B000CMKEN4|5|Fits my F-350 (1995) great.
B00LDBJS8U|5|These must be broken in, wipe everything with them treat them like you don't care... wash em. Once broken in there is a technique, don't try to wipe... grab corners and drape out over paint and pull towards you. Can be stored in water. Like stated break them in only get better with age
B00HUFY6JO|1|Color is green
B0002JMUWA|5|Great.
B002JC0MVO|4|fit well
B009O3VQ4I|4|Just what I wanted!
B00OEJ3SIO|5|Cute dachshund  puppies decal.  Its on my Explorer expressing my love for my dachshunds.
B00O8JRFA2|4|They look really good on my bike
B000XEBI9K|3|I live in NYC and I  got this for when I had an 2010 Accord Coupe and a 2011 MKZ that had bumpers that had license plates on the bumper so I needed a bumper protector that had a license cutout.  I have had this for 2 and a half years and it has held up find.  The reinforced straps are nice but if they really wanted to steal it they could just yank it out.  The rubber construction isn't that soft or that padded so I can see how this wouldn't protect from harder impacts like a foam pad would.  Also I was always really worried that a dirty Bumper Bully would scratch my paint since it collects dirt with all the nooks crannies and groves on the back.  Defiantly not the sleekest option or the best protection.
B00R1O6S7M|3|Very Nice product only turn signals material is plastic
B00400IYTK|4|working good
B0007YZB5S|4|Good
B004JKQH7M|5|filters oil and debris.
B00WH24LEU|5|man, this is a heck of a great tool!  I bought it to remove a windshield decal from my Jeep, but I can easily see myself putting this to use all over the place.  Great find!
B007PRM3C4|4|The bumper looks great and I am pleased.  It came with the winch plate assembled, it was a heavy feat to put on even with two people.  Warning remove the bottom bolts under your frame that bolt into the bumper before attempting to line it up as it blocks the seating of the front bolts. Also you will not be able to reach two of the front bolts to tighten securely unless you first mount the winch plate part and then the outer shell. The added protection to the front of the vehicle is a huge plus compared to the plastic standard bumper,,, but at a cost of some gas mileage I am sure...
B00NAUKQ0Q|3|Like others have described the Black wire is the Positive and the White is Neg. time will tell on these lights because what I have found is they all work fine at first but then as time Go's by they fail.<br />They seem very light weight I would like them more if they were fully potted where water couldn't effect them but for the low price what can u expect
B000DLBIGG|4|I bought this for my Prius which comes with a lame beeper. I had my mechanic install it with a push button (not included) because my steering wheel horn switch died.  It is louder and has a tone reminiscent of an American car.  It is completely sufficient, but, is NOT Truck or Locomotive loud.  Certainly a good replacement for wimpy import car horns.
B008N2JLRU|5|Fits my used 2013 Sonata perfectly.  Much cheaper than the dealer.
B00V4KCN32|2|The zippers like to come unzipped and the overall quality of this product is poor.
B00OW0UAJA|5|Perfect for pulling keys off when I have to leave my main keys behind. Bought two
B008LLVM3O|1|Was not the custom fit for my vehicle as peomised.
B00HRGG05O|5|I've had this set of brakes on my 92 Honda accord for about a year now and they still look and work awesome.
B008I179BG|4|Read carefully. This is a plastic lens. As pictured it does not include the circuit board that had the LED bulbs. You will have to take your old one apart and move the assembly into this lens. If your lights don't work you can buy just the circuit board elsewhere.<br />Thus is OEM Honda part
B00LK2OVD4|5|Nice upgrade to my truck. It was an easy plug and play.
B00HP957RK|3|Should have provided hardware!
B00M2ZULPU|5|The key was as described only problem it was hard to find someone to cut the key and even when I did it didn't work....something about a chip in the key that's needed.....
B00JLPNHJQ|5|Got mine a few weeks ago & tried it out today. I took my 2011 dodge dually 3500 diesel in for service today & they had another 3500 dually sitting there dead as a door nail only would do 1 or 2 clicks that is it. So we hooked it up & it started at the snap of a finger we did this five times same result every time & still shows full power. Glad I purchased this item it could be a savior since I haul for a living with my truck. Only thing is just found out they came out with a 2.0 version with more cranking power. 2.0 version is about $50.00 more.
B00H00P2PG|5|good
B004W4OONO|1|I really did like these headlights until the low beam bulbs burned out. After removing the housing on my Ram to change the bulb I found that the bulb itself cannot be replaced. After contacting Spyder auto customer service and getting no help I decided to write this review to let people know before hand. If you want projectors for your Dodge Ram you should look into another brand.
B00SLN1XMM|5|this product made it  snap to wire up my trailer!  instructions were easy to follow.  beats the old cut and splice method by a mile !
B00NQ198LC|5|Quick, easy to install and they work like a charm. My Thule rack is safe! Thanks for the great product!
B00KV8U21I|1|Purchased GE H11 Nighthawk headlight bulbs in June 2015 and put them away for when I needed them.  Over the weekend (August 2, 2015), I needed to replace headlight bulbs in my vehicle.  One side gave out within 3 days of installing them.  When I checked into returning the faulty bulb, I found out that the Amazon &#34;warranty&#34; expired in July 2015, 30 days after I purchased them.  Now I'm stuck with a bad headlight bulb and frustrated because Amazon will not honor the &#34;quality&#34; of the light bulbs they sell.<br /><br />Product Link:  http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00KV8U21I?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00
B007MHKG3K|1|Sucked would not stick to car window.
B0077FI5ZI|5|Excelent value
B000BYEMKE|1|Did not fit my 1999 infiniti g20
B000JUXGAC|4|Installed easily , works like a champ so far .
B000DZM7FS|5|I have used this polish for 45 years! Great product and it's uses on metal seem unlimited. I highly recommend it I bought this big can for the savings it offers over the tubes. I expected the can to be reasonably durable, rather like a paint can. But it is a very thin metal can, similar to a pop can. I'll have to transfer the contents to a sturdy container, or risk loosing a lot of polish if I drop the can, because it will surely burst.<br />But again, I don't think there is a better polish available.
B00OAEDLYY|5|It's a hilarious sticker so I ordered it for my stepmom. She loved it haha
B000BOAQUE|5|thank you very much!
B0058J4LE4|5|Looks very sleek and stylish on the truck. Surprised on how well it lights up. When I first saw it. it looked very dark but when the lights came on it was actually very bright. Love it and now people can see me better;
B000PAM9KO|5|This is regular air filter, nothing special about it. Costs less than usually what dealerships charge and slightly cheaper than walmart
B0041CDPQO|5|Fits great, no issues.  Routes the cable just find on my FZ1.
B00R5Y8IOO|5|Great mirrors
B009SSNS2C|3|The driver piece  is the smallest, doesn't go under the pedals. I don't really like it. It was a suprises. I wouldn't buy it again although seems to be original. I think seller should put up more pictures.
B00YG21KN4|5|Great.
B00BAZBXTG|5|Is Good bulbs
B006JRLIVS|1|Perfect fit/match to what we currently have on camper,  but was broken when received. didn't even open box to look at it until hubby was ready to fix & now it's been too long to return!  Guess that's a lesson learned the hard way.
B008XKLAFI|5|Yes the fab met my expectations thank you seller!
B00BD4YSKU|4|Exactly what is described...perfect condition....arrived quickly...but....didn't fit my Fiat seats.....
B007AOSHZO|5|Perfect fit for my 2014 Town and Country-S.
B00029X0WO|1|could not use this item, the truck already had them.
B004MXN71U|5|Exact replacement, worked great, well pleased....
B000C545CC|5|Good fo 2002 Taco 4/4 dbl cab
B00AOTBVJQ|5|Worked great for double flares right on my truck. Haven't tried it for bubble flares yet
B001C6JC3W|5|Worked exactly as announced. Changed the part in 20 minutes...
B000K048US|5|Good quality!
B0028OTTIA|5|Its more gray then the green look but heavy duty and works well.
B000K005Z0|5|Good quality!
B007LIHXH2|5|Good price and easy to mount
B00AQ29F80|1|Didn't fit the car it said it would. Didn't even bother returning because it cost the price of the hubs to ship. I'll sell em at a garage sale or something and make SOME of my money back.
B002809QXW|5|Look nice and work great on my 2001 Volvo V40
B000YC5ID8|5|Works great!
B003L7JSY8|5|Ford OEM license plate bracket.  Yup.  That's what it is.  Replaces the original perfectly.
B001C81FVM|5|Weather tech products has not let me down.  I have used them on a number of my cars
B007XZK90Q|1|Received an incomplete package. Terrible. Pretty pissed off as of now. As my stock intake has already been removed
B005J3LO58|5|Good
B000C3ZCTY|4|Don't think this will be a simple bolt in project. The clearances are such that to get washers and nuts on the bottom requires very small fingers and wrenches. With the Mustang up on jack stands, the suspension parts were dangling at full extension. I had to use a crowbar to lever the top into position to bolt it down, but with the Mustang back on the ground, everything seemed to work well and handling was much improved.
B00DF7CGES|5|Install on the front took about 20 minutes.  You do have to drill and remove the back wheels to install properly, so that takes a little time.  But, get your hands a little dirty and add some subtle style to your Scion tC.  I also added a shorter antenna, window mounted Wind Guards, and changed up the color of the interior lighting...(Deep Blue, very slick.)
B00MWEN5YA|1|Product was cheap and had scratches on it and I didn't get the art or speed that the picture and descriptions said it had. The double sided tape does not stick very well either
B00C58GZXG|5|It was amazing it looks beautiful on my truck. And for the people that said you had to peal off each letter... Your wrong. You just use it wrong. BUY BUY BUY!
B00FPL0NH4|4|I bought this for my 2003 Infiniti G35 after the passenger window motor died. It works great! As others stated it is a bit &#34;noisier' than the factory motor but it does the job. I will purchase again!
B00RGZWIW0|5|Nice sturdy and good purchase. I would recommend.
B00SKTCY98|5|Excellent product!
B001L9E3PM|5|This is the only way to buy and as far as I am concerned this is my seller of choice.  No more driving around or calling to see if someone has it in stock.  When you need this for your engine, there is no substitute.  Great price!
B0076DID6W|5|love this
B001SPGRJ4|4|I understand these reviewers who are saying this part is 1-inch shorter than the OEM. However, if you're replacing both at the same time, then the 1-inch difference is not a problem. I ordered the driver's and passenger's side and, it is true - they were both approximately 1-inch shorter than the OEMs. But, in reconnecting the links to the stabilizer bar, the new links were both the same length (1-inch shorter), so it was no big deal. Knocking noise is gone and car (2000 Toyota Sienna) is driving and steering nicely once again.
B0027VT0I8|5|It works great for our cabin!
B0007PHD0S|3|I bought this because my car had a bad mildew smell coming from the vents. It was VERY easy to use and worked great the first few days but after about a week the smell is back. It's not as strong as it was but it's still there. I'm giving this 3 stars only because a lot of dirt came out of the drain after I filled it with foam so I do feel that it's working as advertised but I feel the can is too small. Either I need to use 2 at a time to actually fill the whole evaporator or I need to clean it again. I originally bought two cans (a lot of other feedback recommended using two so I figured I'd buy a backup) and am going to try cleaning it again. Hopefully a second cleaning will keep the smell away.
B008FOGE3U|4|Easy to apply...works as intended.
B00BU58W4A|4|not needed
B00RPBF1LU|5|My husband has a 2014 Jeep Grand Cherokee and this front license plate fit his bumper perfectly. Great product!
B009MAT1GI|3|Keeps windshield area cooler. Vertical size is good, however horizontal sides leave a couple of inches of open windshield on both sides.  I have a 2013 sedan.
B00MN8MX66|4|good  quality .
B00JRH6D8A|5|I love this thing! It is the cutest, most awesome decal I could ever find! I wanted a cat one that was super cute and unique but I couldn't find one..until I saw this :-) it is a larger decal but I think that's what makes it so awesome. It also came with some mini decals, one being a cat!
B00S1PPSKI|5|Eledtriduct is perfect for my application
B00S6GNC7S|5|This is a great key holder. Since I put it on with my other keys I have not walked off and left it in my bike while parked. Thank you
B00390BS7C|5|If you're going to change sensors, this tool will save you a lot of grief... worth every penny even for a single use.
B005EV96PU|5|Excellent
B000EDOTCS|3|okay, I guess.
B0032FVCOI|5|Feels strong and can roll up tight enough to fit under my seat. However it wants to unravel so I had to add some ties to keep it rolled up.
B004MDEVBU|4|Installed Easily on my Kia 2012, just had to trim a little flashing no biggie, took about 3.5 hours.  Nice to have one on there.
B00MB86L2K|4|I'm sure these would have been great if it would have been the right part. I filled out all the info that they needed to send me the right part. And when I got it. It was the wrong one.
B007MOXBTO|5|I have received one compliment and probably irritated a lot of religious people behind me, thank you.
B008N82D2E|4|Good, solid lock. The Kryptonite website says it fits the back disc on a 2013 Harley 883, but sadly it does not. Fits the front disc fine, though.
B0031HFZSQ|5|I get nothing but compliments on this decal. You will catch people taking pictures of it.
B001DCF0QI|5|Works perfectly, and delivered promptly.
B00HE90MZI|3|Kind of loose fit on my bulbs but good price
B0031BQN74|5|Vance and Hines the name itself tells you it quality and they fit!
B0007RVLS6|1|Product is not thick. And doesn't give a nice shine as other products do. Will not purchase again!
B000CQOIVE|5|Works great. Easy to adjust.
B005M16QY6|5|These are quite possibly the best and most comfortable pads I have ever owned. Great for riding and working out!
B002UBZI6S|5|Much better than what came with our rv from the factory. Easier to clean, more comfortable, easy to install. One thing I didn't see in other reviews, it comes with the bottom gasket. We had to get a small hose extension from home depot to connect the water. I would do this again without giving it a second thought, an will change it out in our next rv before the first trip out.
B00M09WKWA|3|The blue is a bit lighter than what is pictured.
B00K5A907E|1|Cannot use it as it is not made for a 2000 Toyota Camry LE (made in the USA). Very disappointed :(
B00657BNE4|5|My husband loved these. They are well made and look great!
B00ZYYEHF6|5|Very good unit
B00B9ETBGU|1|At this point I really have no use for it. I cannot find anyone that will guarantee a cut on it since it has a chip in it. In addition, my local Honda dealer will not even make the cut since it is not one of their keys and cannot guarantee it will work. It came with instructions on how to program it although it says the Honda dealer will cut the key. So at this point, I cannot say I will even be able to use this blank that I purchased.
B00XHESVUC|1|broke in 2 weeks ..felt strong at first but did not hold up after 2 week dont waste your time
B00TF8G110|5|It was perfect.
B000W8HD6O|5|Works great. It is the same as a more matco unit but at a realistic price. Matco even uses the same model number but wants nearly  $200.  Buy this and save money
B000BUQOFO|5|Great levelers for our Pleasureway van camper. Sturdy but not too heavy! Very pleased with them.
B000BQSKQY|5|3M products amazing
B00E1L72RS|2|It is too small for Acura MDX. I wonder why they made it like that.
B000C84740|5|Worked great! Thank you!
B000F10O8W|2|While it looks good and covers my now cracked dashboard of my 1983 Rx-7, the round Driver's Side A/C Vent wasn't cut correctly and the entire mat left of the steering wheel area fits poorly and isn't aligned with the contour/layout due to how the Vent was cut.
B00V9CXSX4|5|This fixed my blower on my 2000 Suburban. Before this it only worked on high
B000CIXMNW|3|Not sure how many stars to give as this part did not fit my car, though Amazon (and other stores) said it would. In the end the transmission cooler lines I have are smaller diameter and they will not seat in this Dorman replacement part. And of course by the time I installed them (doing a transmission rebuild) and noticed the problem I was past the window allowing me to return them.
B001Y8NF90|5|Work great
B00BAZCUZC|1|Had these installed for not even a full day and they melted the socket for my fog lights.
B001HSWO8K|5|Perfect fit. I am happy with my purchase.
B001O2T43M|5|Good
B004AIOZFO|4|Works great and installed almost flawlessly. There's one problem where a nut and bolt were reversed. I took a trip to the hardware store and got the right nut and it was all good.
B00E7WEFQ2|5|had lashes on my mustang before but not the ones that are already curl looks great
B00E9FYG52|3|Not the original fitting for a Mercury Cougar 2.5 6V year 98.5. The pgtail connector is different. I didn't install.
B001D52POK|5|compatible and works
B000GV537S|5|Fast shipping, , fit perfectly, ,, easy follow directions. ..  A+++
B00TIRQBN6|4|The cover fits well and improves the look versus the old weather beaten green cover.<br />It does not cover the whole cover leaving a exposed gap at the top.  I would give it a five if it covered the whole original cover.
B00NWT3RWE|5|Fits and works as good like the original. Easy to change.
B008HJ8C5G|5|Purchased this decal about a year and a half ago, it looks great!  Has been in the hot Arizona sun with no signs of wear!  Easy to apply.
B000B60A44|2|Snap broke after (1) month of use!
B001DRA0G8|5|great product!
B0009IQZFM|1|I did not like this product at all. After 4-5 uses, I am throwing it out. It only grabs a small amount of water before it needs to be squeezed dry, but worst thing is it retains a lot water after many attempts to dry it out, resulting in a useless product. After the first wipe, it continually leaves water drops across the vehichles. My beach towel was doing better. Just bought an ABSOBER drying towel and it is worlds better. I do not recommend.
B00M4AKA0O|2|Nice looking but cheaply made.  Mine broke the first time I used it.
B00DZXLYVS|3|One hole was missing for one of the pull handles,  the handles were too short so the plastic mud guard had to be cut
B007XYG1U4|5|my son loves it !!  It seems like very good Quality leather & was very reasonable!!! great purchase!!!!
B0019470XQ|3|the light is OEM perfect. the bad thing is that the plastic license bracket is what breaks, poor design, needs metal
B002LLE1ME|5|Fast shipping and good unit.
B0024E6UE0|5|they work great and easy to install except for trailers that have the refrigerator vent. you need to trim around it. they do the job well. it was an exact match for the trailer vent shape.
B00KGGTF9U|5|This fits perfect in my 2015 Jeep Grand Cherokee
B003VM6KTO|1|junk, lasted a year +-. first the antenna hole tore out, now the cover coming apart, like a water treatment is coming off the fabric and sticks to your hands. it leaves a residue on your hands also!  these are expensive and would have liked a better product and to last longer.
B00EUUNJRM|4|My son loved this
B00PF0HIGO|4|The lights are very bright! I put them in my F150 and love the amount of light they put off both up close and at a distance all together.
B004UIUIGO|4|great
B00JA3BMDW|4|The thermometer works well but the light of the screen stopped working the second day after I got it so, if I am in a dark place, I need a source of light to read the temperature.
B006YBC1SS|4|they fit well
B000BW8VJO|5|Very happy. No problems
B005LPFFX6|5|Very nice paint
B00UD36JZE|5|Works great, didn't realize they were re-manufactured, but works just as good as new! Thanks!
B007TY3QZ6|5|Very satisfied with this product
B00FGLRY0M|5|Great addition to my Vortex! It has a dark appearance on the outside and inside great visibility does the job perfectly! But in hindsight should have stuck it out for the transition visor.
B00L3VEUJM|3|Looks great, hasn't fallen off in a carwash, and seems to be made from good materials, but the fit was poor.  The pros -  price is right, and the look is great.  It seems to be secure, in spite of the bad fit.  The cons - the fit was the biggest problem.  No matter what I do, all of the clips will not snap on.  There were three that can't seem to snap into place.  The drivers side bottom corner was the worst.  The summary.  I will buy it again if it breaks or falls off.
B00HNW8MJ4|5|It's been hard trying to find a wheel cover for my 2006 Honda Civic coupe since it has a smaller steering wheel that most cars but this one fits perfectly tight no looseness at all. The cover also makes wheel a little thicker which is even better.
B000E3EXH4|4|happy
B001BW6AXC|5|Works Great.  Exactly as expected.
B004A30UHG|5|easy install, worked right away
B000CCM63K|5|great product
B00HGGZ9O8|5|great fits just great
B006QJG3AA|5|Works good
B0024GW3U8|3|the wife likes it and that's all that matters
B00TP2M872|5|Great quality, best looking mud flaps I have ever seen.  My boyfriend is jealous
B005OXTVEO|5|Perfect replacement...
B00AZ4SXUA|5|Perfect fit for my Honda civic 2012 lx.<br />You might want to drill some holes in the hood to super secure it ....installation time 20 mins
B0009IK9DG|5|If you are short like me and reaching the top of your car is a problem, this is the perfect solution.  The brush is soft and doesn't scratch the paint.
B00RW19GJG|5|Great look along with Derby cover and air cleaner insert
B010H0QV00|5|This is a great tool to have in your glovebox or your garage.  The tire pressure monitor gives readings on par with my traditional tire pressure gauge and other digital guage.  You can measure pressure using 4 methods:  PSI, BAR, Kpa, and KG/CM2.<br /><br />The digital display has a nice blue backlight.  There is a bright white flashlight and a red LED light that can be turned on separately.  The following tools are available in the handle:  a glass hammer for breaking glass, a small Philips and flat head screwdriver, seat belt cutter, pliers, and scissors.  The tool includes 5 button cell batteries (remove the plastic inside first so the tool can operate).<br /><br />This is a quality pressure gauge and multi-tool that I'm happy to have in my glove compartment.<br /><br />(A sample was provided for testing and evaluation.)
B0036ULEV0|1|Didn't work with my valve stems to stay on and later quit. Bought a cheaper one that works much better by Campbell Hausfeld
B000EQ0O7O|5|Love these pads I got for my 4Runner, they work great low dust, super stopping power, no squeeking, I put these on with Callahan rotors, VERY SATISFIED, Thank you Amazon !!!!!
B00MOKMTLW|5|Perfect fit.  No brainer to install.
B000CPHXRQ|5|I was looking for this for my new 2015 Nissan Rogue.  I researched many sites and even called a Nissan parts dealer to find out they don't make one yet for the 2015 models.  Then I found this, and it fits quite well.  It does not cover the entire back bumper but does offer a lot of coverage, with some overlapping under the lift gate, but the lift gate has no problem closing.  I am hoping that the tape stays (I applied correctly by putting even pressure along the length then using a roll of duct tape to smooth it out) but if it does not hold I will just apply some new 3M tape.  It will still be cheaper than OEM and will cover all the scratches that I didn't even realize could happen so easily.  So far, would definitely recommend!
B0009IBJCQ|1|Piece of junk.  Don't waste your money.  Put it on a discharged battery and it started out ok and then went directly to charge complete.  Battery would not even turn the vehicle engine over much less start.  Thought maybe battery might be defective so went and bought a new battery.  Seller told me to charge it before putting it in the vehicle.  It done the same thing.  would not charge the battery.  Its going to the dump on my next trip.  Had to resort to an old charger I have been using for about 30 years
B00BITJ2TC|5|I Ordered it on Monday and i received it on Thursday . Works great with my 98 corrolla I had no problem installing it.
B008BLKI2U|5|Nice
B000C67V36|5|The pioneer cover fit well and no more leaks! Delivered quickly
B0000AZ7XF|5|item as described, fast ship, great price.
B00651CBO6|4|Works well. All 2 of the radio stations I listen to still come in with the same clarity as with my stock antenna. This thing is a bit more floppy than anticipated, will bend in the wind while driving. I bought this for my 94 Bronco, but it looked weird, so I put it on my 2003 Escape instead.
B00O3QB67S|4|The door mirrors on my 1992 MR2 won't stay in place anymore.  I use this and have no problem seeing around behind me now.  My only problem, is that I can't really lower my sun shades anymore.  To use a windshield screen when parked, I have to take this mirror off...but that only takes a second to do, it goes on easily and stays in place just fine.
B00UW4DJF2|5|Amazing product. My fianc&eacute;'s car was dead as a doornail and after researching car jump starters i decided to give this one a try. Delivered same day  I opened the box and was skeptical at the size, but low and behold I hooked it up to the battery and the the Jeep Compass started right up! The battery was 7 years old straight from the factory! Unbelievable! Will recommend to all my friends and plan on keep it handy for storms. Just note it will start a dead battery, but if the battery is as old as the one I jumped you better get to a service station right away!<br /><br />B.M.Mahon
B009EY0L6Q|5|Very happy with the TBag
B008VL67BG|1|Bulbs are not bright. They are a lot dimmer than the halogens I bought at Home Depot.
B00KSDSYAW|4|Fits find, wife is very satisfied
B00OACARDO|5|this is an outstanding custom decal in every way!  and if you saw my Jeep, you'd know I'm a big fan of decals lol I was very impressed by the fast delivery and quality packaging too. The decal was a breeze to apply too.  I was super pleased with the backing....it was bigger than the actual decal so it peeled off in a snap. if I can find any more room on my Jeep, I will be back for more :)
B0027XYKZO|5|Great fit! My truck is getting better gas mileage and running a little better.  I've still got more to do but I can already notice the improvement.
B000E2CVI8|5|Love it makes changing oil on my bike much easer and faster
B00DQUA1FA|1|The car cover did not fit my car although the advertisement specifically indicated this cover would. Now I  must suffer the inconvenience of returning it and ordering a different cover and hope and pray it fits knowingly I can't trust the size indicator.
B002FY462W|5|Product is crystal-clear and works fantastic!  Very satisfied with this item.
B0009H51LC|5|Perfect air filter for my truck.
B007TN15EG|5|Works great
B005H12QXG|4|great product easy to install. wish I bought them sooner
B00DS3MBZI|5|Nice glove..sized great..i like fly gear!
B00B1U6I54|5|fits perfect
B00I9K30PA|5|On-time delivery and excellent product
B002O95M3K|3|i don.t know is this really kensun anti-flicker i see the kansun Stiker but it's look different for the expensive one
B00HVIG7UQ|4|Only problem is it holds every little piece of dust when I put it down or in my pocket.  The rubber material holds everything
B0041MJGDU|5|Stayed put and didn't crack in the Texas sun
B001KOL8RY|4|These handguards keep roost from hitting my hands, however, due to the way they mount they fit pretty low for my liking, I have the vented version as well and like them better than these as the mount is different.
B00CQNO1OU|1|Actual size is more like 7.3MM without the insert, with the insert the base diameter is 7.4mm and the flare is 8.7mm at 9.8mm depth. So needless to say theses did not fit in m 6mm holes...
B0068O1V4G|5|This worked perfectly for putting another radio in my 2005 Silverado. Wired this to the new radio, unplugged the old radio from the vehicle harness and plugged this one in. No cutting any original wiring. Worked great!
B00YGCKH42|5|Exellent
B00D3OVG1M|5|I bought a pair at a local truck accessories store,  I figured I'd try 2 first because my 2015 Silverado, came with the bed Rhino coated...Once I figured out how to install them,  they fit just fine.  Getting them here with a Prime membership is the best price.  Truck store cost me $25 for a pair.  I will eventually order more here  they fit and work very well, very handy having in bed tie downs...
B006SYNF9K|3|Update: Bought this product in February and the zebra print side began stripping late August.  I really am at my wits end with vehicle shades as they mess up the vehicle when they are stripping.  Given that this one is padded and wide, I will cover it with some canvas-type patio furniture material as these plastic ones don't hold up well to perennial sun :(   Initial Post: Purchased a few months ago and it is holding up well to the Caribbean sun! Initially it seemed too big for my Rav-4 screen but after a few adjustments, it provided excellent coverage.  Does a much better job at keeping out sun rays than previous visors used.  Thick and durable thus far. No regrets with this purchase.
B00OL4RGTY|1|These things are garbage .there honestly junk don't even fit on the truck now have to modify it to work would never buy these agian.
B00S5O3DIY|5|A lot for the price
B000V5WF6G|5|exact fit and replacement for the OEM air filter.
B00UTWXZJ2|5|Installed on daughter Jeep she's happy
B00K3XVRDI|5|Very fast shipping and they fit great on my 95 no instructions tho. But if u can't install mirrors then cars might not be ur cup of tea.
B000XOGROG|4|I like it, however I wish it would have mentioned that it wouldn't fit over if we had a solid cover roof ...hopefully it will fit the golf cart???
B00MHWXUV0|5|Is as advertised. Not bad.
B006H34A8C|5|I've got a 2012 yfz450 and this mount fit great. I have a 6 inch light bar mounted on it. I ride desert trails, sand dunes, and forest trails and this mount has been awesome!
B00A50S534|5|worth every penny
B00O8ZNJ2Y|5|These things look sweet
B0065FRBZ6|5|great products
B005NLQAHS|5|This is very handy to have for the times when your car shows you Check Engine and dealership asks for $100 diagnostic fee. Besides check engine error codes it can give many different metrics. I used it with my Android Phone and Torque App and was able to get Throttle, Fuel, Air, O2, Engine RPM data displayed. There are a lot of different options you can select to display, but it will depend on your car if it reports that data. I used it few times while driving and this particular OBD2 was very responsive.
B00NXRXNO2|5|Second time I bought this company blades, it nice quiet smoothly operating long lasting...
B00CG3T71C|5|Perfect fit on 2015 model.  Great for collecting sand from beach chairs.
B008BCF4KA|5|Will this fit Honda Civic 2014 ex?
B012X49ENY|5|I just got my P&F Wingback car organizer today. I couldn’t wait to set it up in my car, which is an embarrassing mess whenever anyone rides in it with me. I am just so busy every day that things never seem to be in order and end up all over the car.  So, I bought the organizer hoping for a miracle! First of all, it was very easy to install. In just a few minutes I had it set up and ready to organize. Probably the greatest feature is that my purse fits in the center between the two front seats and won’t fall into the back seat. I can’t even keep track of how many times I’ve been driving and had my purse up-end into the back seat on the floor. I’ve lost my cell phone and loose change, and actually had to pull over to put it all back together. Even with just that feature I’m a happy customer! The car organizer also has lots of pockets! For my iPhone, my USB charger, my sunglasses, my reading glasses, a notepad and pen, my wallet, even my Kindle-they all fit in their own place and I can reach them easily while I drive. I have a feeling that this organizer is going to be my new best friend! So glad I ordered it! Thanks!
B00MG9D1G8|4|sturdy and excellent grip on the roof rack bars<br />some of the bolts were on the &#34;snug side&#34; during installation, but are holding pretty well and solid<br />The actual part where you attach the lights is solid and has plenty of material, which could become a problem if the installing bolts on your lamps are short. Quick fix, change the bolts, and tighten up.
B00BJS8E00|3|Tools ok but innerrod can't fit longside of head .
B000COMXCM|5|Nice little pouch to keep your lock key in.
B00H26YYRU|5|They stick well and look great on my 2015 optima SXL /K5
B00651OAVS|5|so easy to work with dont flare to hard or tighten to hard
B001O0XM50|4|Same brake pads as offered through my local auto-parts house, but at 1/3 their price.  These pads are ceramic, but also contain copper and other materials to promote better/faster braking and better heat dissipation from the rotors.  100% ceramic pads do NOT dissipate heat as well as these ceramic-composite pads do.  These are also the exact same compound pads as came on my car from OEM.<br /><br />If you have nice, fancy wheels and are tired of brake-dust turning them black, and want to restore &#34;new-car&#34; braking performance, install these pads, and replace or turn your rotors.
B0062IJP32|1|Not happy with this at all. I should have listened to other negative reviews. It doesn't quite fit right on my 2006 Chevy Silverado. It's not flush all the way around. It was also kind of a pain to get on the 2 long screws with the rubber on them didn't line up with the holes so I had to force it and bend the screws.
B0028SHNMU|4|Worked OK on my leather seats. Not bad for the price but there's better products out there.
B000CO7E3U|1|Wrong part. Not for the vehicle its intended for.
B000OAG2DK|5|Shut off completely stops water flow unlike the turn-style shut off heads in some campers that don't completely stop water flow.
B000EDUUHQ|5|They do the job.  Are easy to adjust and install where needed in our RV cupboards
B00IX26VQ4|3|No channel for wire
B002D33QBW|5|My husband is very pleased with this product. Very good quality.
B00Z6LWGSM|5|They fit and work perfectly
B001GG09GW|3|Larger than expected
B00SR5FM6W|5|GOOFIT PD24 Performance Carburetor is an awesome product and I bought​ it for my GY6 125cc Go Kart. I am very happy with my purchase as it has remarkably improved the efficiency and perforance of my vehicle. I would highly recommend this product for GY6 125cc and 150cc Go Kart owners.
B0009TAOC6|3|My take is, this item came faster then I expected. The package was a little large, but secure. But what you expect it's a ball, a small ball. And the package is like a flag. When the UPS came, if it was not in that (flag bag :)  ) it would take all day for him to find it. I connected to the hitch and it fits great. With the lock washer...beautiful!! And it makes the hitch on the vehicle noticeable. I just haven't use it yet. I will, that's why I gave it 3 stars after I test it out on my 2000 miles trip and the rental truck place inspect it. I will edit my stars and write another review. For now thanks!!
B00ZW66WK4|4|Replacing bulbs in an RV to preserve battery power.  Not quite as bright as I expected, but will work.  Would have preferred a warmer color but can live with this.  Fit fine in the sockets, unlike another brand I also used.
B00GN6YIXA|3|These are cheap replacement reflectors. They are fine reflectors but the housing is shoddy. The housings' paint was already chipping away when they arrived and the screw/bolt peg was unsecured which made fastening tricky but not impossible. I wouldn't expect them to last very long but for the cost I'm willing to see how long.
B000KL3C5E|5|Perfect!
B001UFUD0G|4|Wish the head rests were a bit more snug. But they are taunt and heavy duty. I have them in my 08 Tacoma and they are great!
B00CKML3ZW|5|This worked just fine to replace a broken strap on the window awning on my motorhome.  After looking to see what was involved in removing the endcap on the roller, I took a reviewer's advice and reamed out an extra entrance point on the groove. With that done, it's quite easy to slide the damaged strap off and install the new one. I found the use of a rotary tool and a small diamond bit much easier than a drill to make the cut.  Be careful to wear eye protection while cutting the groove.
B000JZWMGG|1|Dont fall for the same trick I did!!!<br /><br />This advertises &#34;direct fit&#34; and &#34;same performance as OEM&#34;.<br /><br />Yes it was a direct fit.<br /><br />NO...it does not perform the same as a OEM AC Delco part.  I noticed that the core was only 1 inch thick as opposed to the OEM radiator that was 1.25 inch thick.<br /><br />Yes...SIZE MATTERS.  I towed the same trailer over the same grade...and before when towing the trailer, no matter the outside temp the engine and transmission temp remained at a rock solid 210 F.  With this radiator, the engine and trans temp creeped up to 247 F while the outside temp was only 78F.
B007PP26RI|5|2-part epoxy putty worked perfectly to fill the hole and 80331 bandage sealed the deal.  No issues after more than 1,000 miles
B001HLIMD8|5|Very cozy and protects my neck when I'm wearing a summer top.<br />Little smelly at first but then I hung it outside to air out.
B00NW9DDH8|4|This product is good it's just a little smaller than I was expecting.
B00K7XWNKA|1|Cover is made of cheap material, it tore as i was installing it. The fitment is also horrible!!!
B00WUOTZVE|4|Took a little time to get here but it went on smoothly. The directions were not as helpful as we thought but we had a professional put them on and they knew what they were doing
B00VU73X2O|2|After I installed this aftermarket part, it did not fit properly. I'm really disappointed because I spent a lot of time on this and my fender does not fit correctly. I'm a Very unhappy customer.
B00ONHS8KU|5|What i need it for my cargo van true fit.
B006RLK62I|5|Fit perfect for my 2008 Mazda 6 Sport!
B00F9EEKYY|5|Great product, fast shipping
B000CQRLDG|5|Works great, great stopping and no noise
B00QRHDIPY|4|Ok
B0044B0Z06|5|OEM product. Good price. Fast delivery. Would purchase from them again.
B000M5NNQ6|5|Excellent product!  Highly recommend - we use it in our tractors - really boosts engine performance and longevity.
B001EA0LJK|5|Door edge trim came on my old car from the factory. I like that it gave me a little security when other people rode in my car and threw the doors open or when someone parked too close in a parking lot. I recently bought a 2016 Mazda CX-5 Grand Touring and this kit works perfectly. The trim looks good; it's shiny and black and along with the copious amounts of trim already on my car, this goes with the overall aesthetic really well. It fit over the doors easily, was a breeze to install, and thanks to the adhesive on the inside doesn't look like it's going anywhere anytime soon. I installed it last night and did some city and highway driving with it this morning and the trim is still firmly in place. Frankly, this trim seems to stay on better than the stuff my old car came with from the factory.<br /><br />This kit came with more than enough trim to do all four doors as well as the edge along the back door. I probably have just about enough left over to do another two sedan or coupe doors. The quality of the trim seems superb and for the money you just can't beat it!
B00OC90BR2|4|cute sparkle to add to my car.  A few of the stones are crooked but not to noticeable from afar.
B00JVXFF1Q|5|I have replaced this part on my srt6 crossfire with an O'reilly's part six times. Every time it would last about a week. Got this part in and my car has ran fine since I installed it. The only problem was that the listing said this part wouldn't fit my car, yet the part fit and worked perfect. Will be ordering another.
B000B8N3MS|5|Works fine.
B007WR25ES|5|I had no problems using it on a 3.5 hour drive each way on our vacation to the beach and back.
B007RU1EK6|5|Just as described and perfect
B004D9CHUU|5|Works
B00G7RP280|5|100% FAVORABLE REVIEW, FUNNY ITEM TO HAVE- RECIEVED FAST SHIPPING.
B00CU5EJ3C|5|worked fine
B00192JFBI|5|perfect, easy to install
B000WJ6YBS|4|If you have an old machine like mine the arms are much longer.  This 'tightens up' the look by reducing the extension.  For what the part physically IS, it is VERY pricey - but if they don't make the replacement anymore...
B00898LAJ0|5|They work great! I was a little frustrated with the hose clamps because they were on the short side. I had to struggle to get them started in the clamp. Otherwise, they work great and I am looking forward to using them.
B000C34KYC|5|Excellent
B00B7JMA74|5|Perfect - exactly what I expected.
B00I290HJU|5|Perfect fit
B00H84Q366|1|Looks really cheap
B00VGL8RDO|4|Excellent quality however 8 days to arrive is really bad usually takes threedays, what happened?
B000C9O7R6|5|great
B00JIIZCM6|5|I use it for my motorcycle jacket and it helps me to get the bugs off pretty good.
B000NUAFH0|5|I have a 2004 F250 (110,000 mi.) and it really did a great job cleaning up what was probably injectors starting to get blocked. The truck would have a very &#34;rough&#34; idle when first started. It took about 4 tank fulls of treated fuel to make a difference and now with another 4 tanks it is very smooth. I will continue to put in 4 ounces per tankfull from now on. DO YOU KNOW HOW MUCH AN INJECTOR JOB COSTS!!!. This is cheap insurance and probably helps out way beyond my injector issue.<br /><br />very satisfied customer,<br />Mike
B000V7JEYU|5|Great product, and it's made in the USA!
B002BVXM92|5|I suppose it worked..
B012J99VGS|5|I just received my magnet yesterday!  I love it!  I also have the 26.2 sticker from this same company that is GREAT!  Thank you so much Motvia!
B000BD6NES|1|Decription is not complete and or accurate. The length was wrong.
B00A2THQN8|5|perfect fit
B00X9UVAU2|5|Awsome, it looks so cute in my car and great quality car seat covers. My only complaint is it didn't come with instructions on how to put it on. It took some time to figure it out. Also the staring wheel cover was to big, but over all I love it.
B000UIVE2A|5|There were issues with the packaging not holding the compressors so they arrived 3 times damaged, one was damaged and would not work but my mechanic put another in and got it working fine. The support given by Four Seasons made up for all the headaches, they were very fast and helpful, and if i needed another one i would buy it from them. Hopefully, they can figure out how to secure the packaging better because i think the product is as solid as any of its competitors at a reduced cost. God knows you're gonna need to buy one of these every few years if you own one of those damned CRVs.
B000PWYBN0|5|It worked perfectly!
B000N9MTW0|5|Just as described and quick shipping.
B007TZ836M|5|very good
B000H03S16|5|Really nice muffler for the price. Good sound. Not extremely loud but louder than stock. I didn't rejet carb will update how plug looks when I take it out
B00I8SJPPW|5|Love the deep sound this gives off. Could stand to take out one baffler to make it louder but as it comes is a major upgrade over the stock exhaust
B00CNEQZF0|4|Parts worked very good,  very happy.  A little hard to pull tailgate down now, but tailgate goes up well and stays up good.
B000FQ1K0S|5|installed easily as long as use have right tools, took me twenty minutes.VERY PLEASED
B004J325G6|4|Inculded everything I needed. I did have two extra springs that I couldn't figure out where they went.
B000FCGR0U|4|Works pretty good. Still gets hot in my truck. Just not as bad. And the surfaces of everything are not blazing hot like they would be.
B0075JJ4V0|5|Very nice quality, arrived as promised. Easy install
B000XY6XMM|5|Good buy
B00J04WAZA|5|2015 Tundra CrewMax Limited.  I got these to put on as the leather seats can get sweaty in the Summer.  They fit and look great, I will just leave them on year round.
B00CPSVG6W|5|Looked all around and found Blondie’s to be the best. Put them in my RV and I can’t live without them.<br />Nice fit and VERY comfortable! And fast shipping!  THANKS Blondie!!! 
B005T3ZI6E|3|helped clear up the garbled sound coming from the cassette deck in my truck - unfortunately was not enough alone
B00Q8PAKRY|5|looks nice
B006G5AY3G|5|Everyone who gets in my car loves this pillow.
B000E7BTAO|5|great product!
B00CJ0AIJM|5|Works great on my 2004 A4 and you can't beat the price. It's been 6 months and I see no problems ☺.
B0057V3ZEA|3|good price but doesn't fit like it should... Had to file down the shims.
B0016KFY0O|4|Worked grea. Replace orginal without any problems. Now I can back the boat in the water without unplugging the trailer.
B004ZG69D2|5|I purchased this tool to replace the bearings and hubs in the cars and trucks in less time and improve the quaiity.<br />I just used it to remove two drums too due to excesive wear of it.<br />I have a new car maintenance shop and i am investing in good tools to make good jobs for the customers.
B00EC0Z694|5|The mirror and housing, etc., look great, works perfectly and in<br />every way matches the original. Replaing it at a dealership would<br />have cost $375.  Fit System's replacement cost about $40,00
B002XL2IG8|5|Havent used it yet but its made exactly like the one for my 5th wheel. Will use when I put my generator in pickup
B000EOER56|5|Excellent
B003JHC5XG|5|Nice very easy to install. It was a very little off center. Usually this really bothers me.
B0042VVKD4|5|Very good quality and well designed, this is the kind of stuff that you wish you would never have to use, however, if you have to use, you will be very gratful to have it, it is basically a smart way to cut seat belt and break car window glass, this is in the unfortunate event you get in an accident and get traped inside your car, every second will count... I baught 2, one for the wife and one for me...
B0002XRUMQ|5|Perfect fit.
B007UTPU1I|5|I needed a quality 10k hitch with 1&#34; adjustible increments.  Local trailer supply stores said none were available.  Amazon to the rescue!<br />High quality great hitch.
B001Q399RA|4|Compact, powerful for size..
B003UHX5WU|5|It fits Perfect! this is the one I needed.
B004C4BW70|5|This thing is awesome. It is very well made and holds all size cups. You can tell it will be durable. I needed something for the rear seat of my Jeep Wrangler for the kids and this is perfect. It arrived very quickly and I was impressed as soon as I took it out of the box. It has adequate space for storage. It has straps to hold it down but I don't use them, it stays in place by itself. Great product!
B00IJM46D8|5|great replacement mats and so much cheaper than my local dealer
B0078U9GS2|5|Perfect fit in my 1997 Jeep Wrangler Tj
B008CE09PM|5|Using this to haul a 4 bike rack on top and cargo rack on bottom.  I added an 18 inch extender for the cargo rack to extend out past the bike tires.
B0055EFU8I|2|I purchased this in 2013. Nice looking tool. I have not used it very much maybe 10 or 15 times. Now it is 2 lbs off. I have 2 other gauges that are right on with each other. My vehicle shows the tire pressure. If I fill with either of the other gauges it shows correct on the vehicle. If I use this gauge it is 2 lbs off in the vehicle. Low reading is not acceptable given the price for this unit.
B00IY3YLCI|5|number one
B00LHB08C6|5|Very Cute on my 01 VW beetle. Easy to apply. Arrived 2 weeks early. ❤️😉
B008ZQPNWQ|5|Got it for my boyfriend and he loves his cap.
B003V1DL6A|5|good price and an excellent fit. fast shipment
B00BUIOI8G|5|Great one step wash and shine for salt water boat.
B00BCRMAR6|2|The covers are  hard to put on they do not stay on, and they are  thin.
B000243QA0|5|This was perfect. Exactly the right size, fit correctly, and allowed me to get my Weber Performa BBQ back up and running. (No thanks to Weber who does not sell the item, nor will they sell the replacement fitting that is needed to attach this to your Weber BBQ. Weber wanted over $125 for a new regulator (all others of which sell for about $30) and refused to sell just the fitting to attach this to the grill. Go on eBay and search for the fitting, it is $8!) Thanks Manchester for the great tank and the fast shipping.
B0036U1TH4|5|Fit my rzr looks good easy to install
B0049MX8N6|5|Had to retur. Did not work on my truck.
B000OGAA1E|5|Just what I was looking for. I had one like this that lasted nine years before the battery quit. The previous tire gauge battery was not replaceable as this one which is a plus. I have tested the gauge against a calibrated gauge and it is accurate. Overall I'm pleased and would buy again.
B00HSHWFQK|5|it's the right part and my window works now,
B00A8PD7HK|5|The set up is nice and the feel is great. Had to lower my forks about 1 1/2 inch and at first I was not happy about it but after doing some reading the FZ6R needed to be lowered with or with out clip ons. Love my new bars thank you.
B002N5YDG2|3|work very well but the last one lasted only 3 month hoping this one last better
B004AGHNHS|5|thank you for having quality parts
B0097S22V6|5|Great hat the color matches the picture. Im a big mustang fan, the only thing is the stripes on the bill are a little off to the right, shipping was fast ordered it on monday and got it on thursday same week, its a unisex hat no specific gender.
B00ABK67BK|4|This was very easy to install.  Everything lined up well and fit nicely.  I just wish it came with the hardware (six bolts/springs).  Seems like each auto parts store only stocks two at a time so I had to go to three different places to get them.  Plan on spending about $40.00 total for all of them.
B0081SE1OO|5|Great product shipped super quickly. Took an hour to install only because I had to get my metric tools instead of SAE. Exact fit product slipped in without much effort. Started truck, alternator light went off, and alternator was making the correct voltage.
B00DBEMGP4|5|Did its job for cheap
B000CONYOI|5|Very happy. No problems.
B000B8LKZ0|5|Great price, fast service, and works as expected. Another great Amazon purchase. I love Prime service from Amazon.
B00LYJ7WB6|5|Works great! Fits well on a 2008 lance charming, or pretty much any other 50cc chinese scooter. Thanks!
B00CGTVCIC|5|No smell, as advertised! Comfortable and grippy. Fits my Acura RDX steering wheel perfectly. Its tight when installing, but it will go on!
B0083UF6IK|5|Fits perfectly to the seat and is very secure.  It will hold a fair amount for its size if you unzip to expand it.  Also very nice looking.  If I recall, the description notes is says &#34;Versys&#34; on it...it does not, just Kawasaki.  It fits models other than the Versys.
B00UTWY5W8|5|Same as the right
B00RV83UUG|5|NICE LIGHT, FAST SHIPPER, A+
B000BRF3VS|5|great vent, easy to install.
B0036E9VB6|5|Good product fast shipping!
B005NJOGGM|4|Fits. Looks good. But I find that I mostly just leave the hitch in the receiver all the time so I don't have to go install it whenever I need it.
B000COL2PQ|5|Expensive like a lot of Lokars stuff but good quality. The days of buying good quality at a good price are gone. So this works
B004N5U7DS|5|Exactly what I wanted at a great price. Replaced mine in under an hour! Recommended
B00I3LLVS8|5|Went right on and no more leak awesome product
B006UH5AAC|5|This is the best actuator I have had, easy to install, if it breaks it's easy to fix, I have owned several boats, this is great!
B00319JQLQ|2|Starter lasted 9 months under normal use before it croaked.
B008UG22LG|5|This decal is so adorable! Looks perfect on my Jeep and is a great size. Not too big and not too small. Very fast shipping as well. Couldn't be happier
B00480N0GE|5|Great direct OEM replacement for normal use.
B002HXGGOC|4|Installed easily and worked with cap
B000GTVXKG|5|For the price you can't go wrong I put these on my girlfriends yz85 and they fit great.
B0012V11SQ|1|I really was really excited to find &#34;in-channel&#34; model for my car having them previously 10 years ago.  But, I was wrong.  I haven't even opened the package and I can already tell the visors for the 2 rear passenger windows on a '12 Ford Escape (non-hybrid) will not fit when I held up the package to the car.  The product assumes the window runs parallel to the ground and has no curve.  My windows curve down towards rear like most other Escape models.  Company doesn't seem to make the exact product for my vehicle's four windows.  Disappointed and trying to decide if install two of the four vents is worth $$ paid.
B00BITKJNK|5|Excellent product
B000FGI6E6|4|Seems o be working fine. I gave it four stars because the Harley wrench does not fit around it, but no big deal.
B00QF1D0J6|5|all of the parts that I orderd fit perfectly. I have no complaints. the prices were lowest I found. sometimes you pay for what get but this wasnt the case  I am completly satisfied.
B00GI162K2|5|thanks
B000E28MTU|5|great product!
B006O84LWU|2|The chain I received didn't come with a master link and also the packaging had been opened. I didn't bother returning as I got a link at my local Cycle Gear.
B003R3U3M2|5|fit great, worked great, it fixed my problem, thanks.
B000EM019O|1|A complete waste of money. The paint comes out in blobs - impossible to use.  Do not purchase this product.  I will never buy this again.  Waste of my money.
B00MMKMRPM|3|A little too big, remote rattles inside.
B008R58AHU|1|DO NOT WAIST YOUR MONEY IT IS JUNK MINE IS BROKEN NOW ONLY LASTED 3 MONTHS AND HAS TO BE REPLACED DONT BE CHEAP LIKE ME !!!
B005I5I5GI|5|helped me finish my project
B0081HH5Q6|5|Worked great-well worth the money. Nice and strong, good chrome.
B00KYDZWBU|5|Exactly as described! Although, I was informed that the magnets for this product are more powerful than many other magnets. Matter of fact, the magnets are so strong that they injured an employee of ours who was installing the product. Because of which he will require years of psychiatric help to get over his new found fear of magnets. Other than that, the product arrived before the anticipated delivery date, it is plenty bright for day/night use, and the price did not break our budget. We will more than likely purchase more of these.
B000RZAPPS|5|Love these hubs way better then stock ones that will lock up at 75 and blow your transfer case... Like mine did but I put these in and never looked back had in for about 4 months which I would have put these in years ago though!
B00GEIAA0C|5|Good
B00D6MBGL6|5|They work great. Basic led lights and positive negative wires. Simple wiring job for anyone with any wiring knowledge. I tested the lights on the battery before installing. Touch the negative wire to the negative terminal and the positive wire to the positive terminal on your car battery, all LEDs powered up. They are very bright for inside the car and probably not quite bright enough for exterior use.
B008JP8O6K|4|Great replacement
B004C22WYO|5|This unit works as advertised with my Vulcan VN1700 Nomad. I read just about every review and educated myself on AFR. A lot of classic tune guys will defend their Power Commanders until their face turns blue. This unit has revolutionized the segment and serves 80% of most riders needs. My bike now pulls hard at low range and has corrected lean running condition. I recently added a K&N filter with V&H twin slash just before the tuner. My engine would get hotter than usual and I knew it was craving more fuel early in the powerband. Once this powrpro richened up the mixture, my bike has come alive. If you want EXACT tuning and extra dyno expense after every upgrade, get a PCV. If you want plug and play greatness for the life of your bike/modifications, go with this. You won't be sad. Ride Safe.
B00B7M1MAW|5|This is the second time I've bought these (we have two Passats) - they are the genuine OEM VW mats (as advertised).  They fit great, and seem to hold a lot of dirt (how does the dirt pile up so fast? lol).  They look good when they are clean, and most of all, they protect the carpet (and therefore help the car retain a little more value).  For the price, they are a solid 5 star item.
B0083Z2T1W|3|GOOD<br />The spinner is well made.  It turns easily and noiselessly.  The silver and black blends in very well to the cars decor.  Makes driving especially turning in tight places a breeze.<br />BAD<br />It comes with no installation instructions.  It took me awhile to figure out that the rubber shims were two different sizes fat and thin, to adjyst for variuos steering wheel diameters.  It has no suggestions on placement or the easiest may to clamp the konb to the wheel .  Worst of all, is that it takes three hands to install: two hands to squeeze, and I do mean squeeze hard, the two sections together and one hand too screw in the bolt.  So, it takes two people to easily install this, otherwise you're in for a very frustrating experience trying to keep the holes lined up while you screw.
B001NOU92G|5|Nice gun to spray latex or primer. Use Flotrol and water to spray perfectly.
B00NU9FWJC|5|Very satisfied with this purchase. Sounds amazing
B007XZK6UE|5|Great product perfect fit
B00EBHPDDM|5|Excellent for me. I'm 6'3&#34; and have big calves and these fit great
B00NBN1C78|4|I needed a jack for my car hauler trailer and thought this would fit the bill perfectly.  I will be using it on my Hobie Cat trailer instead.  The tools in the kit are good quality, the design is unique and slick..... But, the description of the U bolts is wrong. It said &#34;any trailer frame up to 3&#34; wide by 5&#34; high.&#34;  The inside measurement on the U bolts will fit 2 1/2&#34; wide by 4&#34; high for the larger bolts and 2 1/2&#34; wide by 3&#34; high on the small bolts. I will be trying to source some larger (wider) U bolts so I can use the kit.  This will only work well on a square frame tube or C channel frame.
B009WQPWVK|5|Good quality
B00EP4971A|5|work will same oem bulb .
B001J7CO02|5|quite loud. running mine on 160psi.
B009VI5B0G|5|Excellent kit fairly easy to install stopped the leak saved a bunch of money will buy from this company again!
B00F6D4UKW|3|The way it was rolled up in the tube it came in the backing on it was pulled of in several places. But we was able to salvage it and it came out OK.
B000HEBR3I|4|small caacity but does the job
B008E951R6|2|Didn't fit my back dome light.
B000N5YLCU|5|Good kit and good quick service. Im very pleased
B000GZFQW6|4|It was inexpensive, and works fine.
B0009H51ZS|5|Perfect fit.  Looks like good quality.  Great price.
B00383YCH8|5|easy install, only difference it doesn't have auto dim
B000BZABM6|5|Great bearing! My mechanic was surprised with the price of these as his wholesale price was more than what I paid here. They seem to have performed very well since purchase. No complaints. Would buy again. Thank you
B004EYI10O|5|great product have been using it for a while now on various engine cat, cummins, paccar a must have for electrical diagnostic
B00FW1VFAG|5|Great cargo tray! Assembled it with my son in about 20 minutes. Love the fold up feature. I purchased a locking hitch pin and just left in on the vehicle throughout the vacation. It fit my cooler, beach chairs,  boogie boards, fishing poles, etc.... Highly recommend!
B00CEKW2XW|4|rusted pretty quick, needs a thicker coating of sealant. otherwise would have been 5 star
B0000AY61Y|5|This handle is light but strong.  It really lets me put pressure on the deck brush and the extension feature works well.
B007QV5JVQ|5|excellent
B00D9C2CDO|5|I was skeptical that this was really waterproof but it is! We've only used it on one trip but it worked great. The only possible negative is that the straps are really long so my husband and I had to spend quite a bit of time securing them so that they were not flapping on the roof of our car. But it worked great and we will use it again.
B0016OMMLO|3|This is a two piece set.  I thought is was one piece.
B001DCC4VC|5|Replaced it for my 2001 MPV broken actuator. Could install it within a minute since it exactly matched old one.<br />It came with locking button (don't know proper name) that attached to hole of door so I pulled out old one.
B0051D3MP6|5|Great Charger, This works perfectly. I have had no problems with this item and i love the separate styles of cords that comes with it.
B008CE0IE4|1|Very junky. Weld slag blocking gear, poor fit of handle to shaft. Overall very bad. Get something else.
B003UE1DGI|5|Used this on my Chinese SSR 125cc pit bike that I purchased from Tboltusa  ...  the factory  Chinese chain would stretch when hot ..replaced with this Renthal  and have had no problems  ...
B00RF9J8DY|5|Love it!
B00CJ8FAOM|4|good quality
B00R27WIT0|4|GAVE 4 star, Just received today. Have not installed yet, but it looks and feels nice.
B0031748RU|5|Excellent
B004MGKJ1I|5|Hilarious!
B00YFSAN1E|5|Great
B00ZICGS8I|5|These Autvivid lights are extremely bright and are well made. I wired these to my backup lights and an aux switch(to encourage people to stop tailgating me). They throw out tons of light.
B006LJBMCY|5|No issues Here went right in perfectly window works a year later
B00V5RA476|3|acceptable
B00U9ZHSEW|5|Perfect.
B00AXE635O|3|not bad
B008I58BAA|4|It isn't a complete solution to wheel cleaning, but it sure allows you to get into places that otherwise would be missed.
B000KZ25NK|5|Came right on time and it was exactly what I needed.
B00A75O7GQ|5|Perfect.
B00LHUI4XM|1|The screw don't fit. Hard to put on. Looks like it will be permanent after you put it.
B003D32OK0|5|Direct replacement for my old Alert.  5 min installation.
B0050Z9WL8|4|Second set of Kensun bulbs (have them in my fog lights) had an issue with these when installed (won't turn off for a minute or so) emailed customer service and we determined a defective relay, they mailed me a new one, didn't fix the issue, turns out my lights are negative trigger (always has power just shuts off ground to turn off) the relay didn't like that, rewired into the factory relay and all works perfect. Customer service rep was very helpful and never spoke down to me, and was appreciative when I found the issue as it is a rare one
B00HS5HO86|5|Great!!!! Looks really good on my escalade.
B000UPA0EG|1|Did not fit correctly. But, I used it until I the dealer item.
B004IJBV20|5|Awesome!
B003BGYRPO|3|sprays much darker green than the cap. Besides that works fine.
B003NVDC7Q|2|2009 Toyota Venza - They aren't as good as they could be. The rear window rain guards are a bad install design and they pop out from time to time. The 3M tape also show's at the top of the guards on the rear windows only. The front are good. I would be completely happy if the back guards stayed in place and the glue/adhesive didn't show.
B0089XR9M2|5|Arrived quickly easy to install, looks great on my car. I have no complaints at this time.
B002R4IBT4|5|Sleeves on these jackets run a little tight but all in all, very comfortable and very well constructed.
B00NAP7G2C|5|This fits on my 2000 Jeep Grand Cherokee and lifts the hood just fine. I can't speak for how long its last but so far this week there still working.
B002PQQ970|5|Excellent
B00NPO8EG0|4|I had to trim around the fuel hole a little bit to get it to fit right but other than that it was fine.
B0097CE6KM|5|Arrived on time.  It was easy to program and has been working great.
B007HOG97K|5|I bought a $20 OnGuard U-Lock with a bonus &#34;High Strength&#34; cable, and after 3 months of use, someone cut the cable and stripped my Specialized Rockhopper bike. As a &#34;We're sorry for your loss, and that it'll cost $550+ to repair it,&#34; they sent me the 6ft. OnGuard 8021 lock. For a month, I had no use for this chain lock, except using it as a walking weight. The 6ft. bike chain lock weighs about 11lbs. and so far has kept my new bike secured, I just need a 2nd chain lock to replace my U-Lock and 15ft. Brinks cable.
B00KY0V85C|5|Stunning detail - Excellent quality - Fast Delivery - Terrific Sellers!  Everyone notices and comments on how beautiful the license plate looks.
B00K18JVQK|5|Love the smell and no greasy finish. Keeps my leather looking new and feeling soft.
B007HTE9EA|5|My used car didn't come with mats.  I guess they decided to keep them and sell them to someone else.  They work  great.  They should protect my floor for a long time to come.
B008F8Q8DM|5|Sometimes the car lasts longer than the headlights. Such was the case with one Pontiac Sunfire. It was time to give it new &#34;eyeballs&#34;. These were the best value on the web and were a perfect fit. I'm very pleased.
B00GSAUHB8|3|Doesn't exactly fit my 2012 Prius C, but with a couple of clips on the sun visors, it works well enough
B000EQ3EC6|2|Nothing wrong with the quality, but it did NOT fit my 2012 Mazda 3 SkyActive engine. Not the products fault, but Amazon's auto parts match needs to improve.
B00EB30YHQ|4|Fits good, works well but bulky and hard to store.  Not shades fault since this escape has a very large windshield.
B004L0AAD2|5|Works great. For what I was looking for
B0040CVQCU|5|Exactly as described. Perfect.
B00R6XTWKI|1|The sizing is wrong. Ordered a sz 25 womens, and this was clearly not that. Sizing is more towards kid sizes than womens. Product looked good,but sizing is way off. Will not purchase ever again
B00N9LMXUC|3|It's ok, it does it job, but it no covers very well the windshield, some sun rays still reach the car interior
B00L33PAUI|5|Absolutely love this item
B00WP7REL4|5|Does exactly what it's supposed to - fits the S60 console perfectly.
B00GJ5ZGRC|5|perfect product!
B002GYSMUS|5|Worked like a charm
B00DJ5KEF4|5|Great for charging cell phones while on the go!
B00546A92E|5|Perfect fit !!
B00FSAV5LU|5|Great product. I use it on my Mercedes. The biggest mistake is that I bought this RU(ready-use) version of smaller bottle. I should have trusted this product and bought the gallon of the concentrate so that i can do hundreds of washes. This thing will clean bird poop, tires, windows and wax the body at the same time!
B00NLP70N6|1|Cheap product, actual mirror piece blew off 1st day I used it.
B00829I3TQ|5|Same as oem. Just has the Toyota label milled off. Otherwise identical.
B005MZX03C|5|beautiful tribute
B00BV80MK8|5|Great power adder for my 72 Suburban with LQ9 6.0L.  Really woke it up.
B0058OB80Y|4|Took awhile to charge them up but since then they have been working great!!
B006OQ35GU|1|Great idea, but does not work. With all the gaskets in place, leaks poorly. Not dirty or clogged.
B000CFQ2XM|5|Made my ride very smooth.
B0026N1TQ8|5|totally pleased with this product
B003N5GJJU|5|Looks good on the gunmetal Prius C it was ordered for.
B000BXKYUC|3|Exactly what I needed.
B00JMLB4TY|5|Satisfied.....
B003RANY8U|4|had to get it programmed
B00JNEBF1M|5|These are very well made though slightly longer than the OEM (2006 Dodge Grand Caravan) lug nuts I replaced.
B003ZYS8UW|4|This is my second that I bough, first one died on me after year of use. Overall a great product
B004V9Z02Y|2|It did not fit my 21 inch tire very well I had to lengthen one of the loops to make it work.
B00G620ZVU|5|great price! light output is bright and more light a spot light. will certainly get more!
B00UZOWK4U|2|It doesnt fit my winshield. To small...
B00SVGREP4|4|No problem installing.
B00YCVPMSI|3|fenders look great and the textured finish was exactly what I was looking for matched up to my Body Armor winch bumper nice... Note one hole did not match up in the front and had to drill and the rear fenders I had to drill every one.  Nice fit to the body and was the third set I ordered that did not match holes perfectly so be prepared to drill.  The directions have it as attaching with the visible bolts as only decorative, but even at that the nut will not allow the fender flare to seal nicely.  This seems a weak design for a rugged truck.  I had to go out an buy new longer bolts and drill through the truck side panels but was very pleased when all said and done.
B00BITKV5G|4|Ok
B00KTHZEZK|5|Great quality, on time shipping, very easy programming. Programming instructions included were very simple and easy to follow. No problems at all. I now have two brand new, cut, programmed key fobs for under $50. Can't beat that! The local Dodge dealership wanted $170 for one key plus another $60 to cut and program the key fob.
B00QA1205G|5|Came exactly as pictured. Not flimsy at all either. I've been through my local car wash over a hundred times and it still looks brand new.
B001G7CF5O|5|Looks sexy
B00DWJ7Q8K|5|Exactly what I wanted
B00BG0951I|5|Great looking on my sportster, not bad coming from China
B00PSMQX2O|5|This stuff cleans carpets probably the best I have seen so far (for spots that is).
B003CX5SU4|5|bought  the same car cover 5 years ago and they still seem to have an awesome car cover
B0039Z1UHA|3|not for marine use
B0000AXDOY|5|Better than the model it replaced....silent operation, great pressure, buying another for the price and peace of mind of a back unit.
B000C9NG6E|5|My engine has never run cooler.  The acdelco is heavier than the one I replaced.  Even the bearing feels tighter and weighty.  Install was a snap.  Gasket doesn't adhere to pump.  You need something tacky to hold it in place.  I recommend using a product like &#34;Copper spray a gasket &#34; to help hold the included gasket in place.  Plus the spray also has excellent thermal properties.
B004B1C61K|1|Did not fit 97 TJ
B00B6CEM3C|5|This is shoe conditioner/cleaner, not shoes. why is it asking how it fits? That's pretty funny.
B00RZJ096O|5|Thank its a good item I like it ...
B0040CTXQ6|4|I think these are ok -- I was baffled trying to repair my Toyota and really couldn't figure out how to use these, and finally went to a body shop and paid $$$$ for the repairs.
B00UJ62GU2|5|Very fast shipping. It just took 2 days. I use it to erase my oil change and MAF sensor light. Easy to use and save me $100 for the auto shop. Everybody should have one. It save you a lot of money.
B00C0NXPIY|5|Wifee loves being in the TT barefoot now... these are so friggin comfy! matched the grey interior perfectly.
B001SZMJDW|5|Genuine OEM and 1/10 the cost if ordered from GM. A Saab requires 5 hangers, write to find out which type requires 3.
B00C6O5OA4|1|Does not fit Subaru's with 5202 wiring harness.
B008XOEHHW|3|The material is nice, but the size has conflict with vulcan original parts
B010W724XQ|5|Love this on my new truck
B00MQ4P6Z2|5|excelente
B0023GM2KK|5|This worked better than expected and no leaks so far.  Better than a gasket.
B0002F668I|5|Great item.  Makes filling my motorcycle's tires much more easy and convenient.  Highly recommended.
B003NU0EM8|1|It didn't
B000C2UD30|5|Been on 2 months eassy install no problems
B004A6M8FK|4|It does fit well, but it's too early to tell how much the aluminum to plastic joints will hold. There seems to be an occasional very small leak now. However almost all aluminum-plastic radiators eventually leak according to (...)    Years later: This radiator has done very well holding water. The remaining problem is forcing the transmission oil fitting to be tight enough to prevent all oil leaking without breaking it. It did leak a quart the first year, but now I've got it down to a few drops a week without breaking the fitting.
B003CEJXGI|5|PERFECT!!!!!!!!!!!
B00XZ9ONT2|4|A little tedious to program but less than the price I paid the deal for a replacement battery.
B00HNKYD0I|4|works well
B005XRPVJ0|5|Nicely made and clear. Made my wife's 20 year old truck looks new. I think this is a good buy
B000LG3UHS|5|This seller and product were exactly as advertised, easy to program, fast and great service.
B0033DOKX4|4|parts fits well and works good
B00938WXOQ|1|I had no problem with the delivery. It arrived within 3 business days.<br /><br />I was disappointed in the quality of the frame. It was not as sturdy as I had hoped. The 5.0 decal is smaller than I thought and seems as if it will fall off very easily.<br /><br />I would recommend othet 5.0 frames. For the bang for the buck I didn't think it was worth it.
B0076OAODG|5|Excelente product!
B00IZ5PCMS|5|Works good and looks good! A lot easier to get on and off than stock.
B006AU5MW0|5|It's on our truck and proud of it
B00BCRMAR6|5|So perfect!! Great protection and style!! Fits wonderfully!! Thank you for exchanging your product for my review!
B000PJED72|5|Have used this now on two large vinyl windows that are 20 years old and were sticking badly.  Didn't do a lot of prep - just cleaned the tracks a bit with a dry paper towel.  They now slide up and down with ease.  The concentrator straw that came with it worked perfectly.  Very happy with the product.
B004UPZXI0|2|This product is orange in color so it is pretty easy to see if you forget to wipe a spot off even on my silver car.<br />It streaks fairly easily so you would have to continue using more of the spray.<br />It smells like your fake orange cough syrup so that just made me gag.<br /><br />This is not a true sealant but just a regular detailer that you would use with your clay bar or to clean some light dust and fresh water spots.<br /><br />I recommend using Meguiar's Ultimate Quik Detailer instead. It is extremely cheaper, doesn't streak and smells a lot better.<br />[[ASIN:B000RXNLK6 Meguiar's G14422 Ultimate Quik Detailer - 22 oz.]]
B00JIJ4LWW|5|I was so pleased with this product. I will definitely use it for all my leather things, very easy to apply and very effective. I highly recommend it.
B008BC8EW0|5|Awsome
B000B8N3IM|4|Does its job on my 83 Rx-7
B0002NYE5W|5|Love it!
B000GU7G88|5|Good fit no complaints.
B00OCAQKNU|4|looking good on car, looks more sporty now.
B000NVW1LM|4|good additive
B00IHR4OZU|5|Good product have driven between cities multiple times. 120 miles round trip. NO PROBLEMS its always tense going long distance on spacers ESPECIALLY this large and I was driving on DESTROYED dirt roads while in diff city. Got back on highway 80+mph. No problem Would def recommend to those with mid size trucks. Mine is a 2000 GMC Sonoma
B00K0UL13A|1|All negative:  purchased this Stigan turbo because of reviews and price proceeded to have it installed at local Vw dealership 2 days later it failed.  Contacted both Stigan and buyautoparts and neither cared, both just replied back how there not responsible for labor nor installation.  So it wasn't a saving nor do I believe the reviews are accurate, I truly think both firms hire people to write reviews period.  And as for Stigan there way of testing to see if there turbo passed quality is to blow air through it.  All negative for both firms period.  And will never purchase another item from either.  everyone that I come in contact with I will tell them this story and provide the firms names and explain how neither stand behind the products manufactured nor sell.
B001PL7RK4|5|good
B0048J02Y8|5|Perfect fit for my van, easy to replace.
B00RBMN5CA|1|Installed on new riding mower. Worked for about 5 seconds then scrambled and no longer displayed anything. Removed battery and it was still scrambled display.

B00B3UYSUE|5|Very good coverage
B00B8SEFUE|5|Nice mats good quality
B00BNIOH84|4|Does what it's supposed to do!
B000CD6GLM|4|The product itself is pretty good, smooth & clear.
B00A7YUIO2|2|The brush with handle from tip to tip measures 13 inches.  Sorry but I really needed the longer brush.
B00OD5UG48|5|Excellent product for about a third of the price.
B00NY0S2OY|5|I have a 06 low rider that stayed dirty under my garage. I am satisfied with this cover. It has elastic at each wheel and completely covers the bike with windshield and has a snap buckle on front wheel to keep it in place in high winds. So far so good.
B0053H8MKK|5|Exact replacement works good
B00HTP8N0I|5|they seem to be perfect for what I need to tie my  my bike down in my trailer
B002UC1AYQ|5|Worked fine, no problems
B0064IU5FW|1|this product is good for jeep wrangler page but say yes.<br />  it is impossible to update it, the website does not download update and said that amazon is not authorized for sale and it is a crime to buy them (amazon). Total waste of money. taketh legal action against them for giving an unauthorized product and get my money
B003QU5PY2|5|Great quality
B001CEG94Y|2|Too expensive
B000786GLM|5|works as advertised.  Was able to repair a Cracked Cast Iron Sewer line delaying a repair quoted at Thousands$$$.
B00VJ4LHUS|5|Great combo bag and organizer for my car.  I tend to have a messy car and all of the items that fit in this bag are the reason!  Love the fact I can put this behind the passenger seat and one reach and have it all right there.  One thing I would have preferred a smaller tissue box area (maybe for those more square top opening boxes, and another spot for a bottle of water.  But that is my quirk.  You will like the convenience of this and how nice it will make your car look!
B0064VJ4LU|5|Easy to apply, cosmetically improved appearance. Im only concerned about the buildup of dirt beneath the bottom plastic that reaches inside the handle, but its nothing i would be really worried about. Looks great and thats why I got it. Met my expectations and am happy with it. Thanks! :-)
B000GTXNI6|5|Used this to put a Renthal R1 chain on my Chinese pit bike ...worked great no complaints!
B00TVC7C1S|2|i ordered a cavalier but got a cocker..
B006AAQAG2|4|Want to give a full 5-star review, as I've always enjoyed the Cruisin Classics brand of products, however I had to knock them down a star for this product. Package arrived promptly (even ahead of schedule), however the product received wasn't nearly as veinous as the item pictured. The hallmark of a great set of truck nutz is authenticity-- I just can't believe these nutz belong to this truck. However, the customer service at Cruisin Classics never failed to accomodate all my needs. Got new nutz on the way and I can't wait! Thanks Giant Flexable Truck Nuts
B000AMW0K6|3|Got it.
B00XVZYTLM|3|Can't really rate these any higher or lower.  They are inexpensive at $18 and priced accordingly.  Not great but not terrible.  The lights were installed in my truck camper in hopes of reducing the load on the battery.  The bulb bases get hot, not sure why that would be unless there is a resistor built in...which would defeat the purpose of trying to reduce the load on the battery.  Not sure what to think about that, other than I hope not and I'm not willing to pay $10 each for an LED light.<br />The color has a pretty decent blue, cold hue to it.  I don't mind it at all, they look nice. One thing I noted is that they aren't all the same color. Side by side some put out a more blue hue and others a more purple hue.<br />So for the price I am ok with them, any more and I'd be very disappointed.
B00N44WMBE|1|This item is not fully compatible with the 2012 Passat B7. It does work once it's plugged but the bulb keeps coming out of the socket. It's very difficult to replace the bulb in the B7 Passat and I can't afford to keep putting the bulb back in the socket. Wouldn't buy it again and would not recommended it. Very disappointed :(
B001TJ50N8|4|Seem to be working well in my trailer bed, nice that they are kinda recessed into themselves, keeps from scratching things badly.
B005C2ACBI|5|Best I've ever had- I'll never get the cheap, regular style again. I heard from a friend they don't like heavy salt exposure from MN winter road salt. Sure makes it easy to tie stuff down now though!!
B00Y07TZ3C|4|I like the density of this product because it's still easy to see out.  Another product I purchased was too dark as it fit on both sides of the glass.  It fits my Nissan Altima well.
B000CO89DE|2|Flimsy
B0009OMYAQ|5|2007 HHR, this was the perfect tool for my oil change. Very happy
B00KHUQ9NK|2|It is marked as a universal cover but it did not fit the two vehicles we have. One is a large truck and it was to small for and the other is a small car and it was too large for.
B00GI77OVW|1|Didn't fit
B000BPZ4X2|2|I had to drill to fit this on my car
B0059RCJQM|2|Looks nice but it's cheep plastic and the wannabe 3m tape on the back is thick making a gap so you can see the tape but all together it looks ok and people can't tell
B001PLENP6|1|Very bad
B004AIDK50|5|Plug and play replaced blend door actuator on drivers side. 2004 Chev Silverardo
B00COOTD9O|5|Very easy installation. Directions were clear to understand
B001892W7G|4|I had to order these guys. They were on my wishlist for a long time (and a million other things for my Jeep... 2dr JK, for what it's worth) but one day I came to remove my soft top and one of the torx bolts was just spinning freely in the plastic dohickey. Definitely wish I had ordered them sooner now! They are well worth the cost.<br /><br />The top and doors on my Jeep come off and on often-- if it'll be nice for more than a couple of days it's worth the trouble to take it all off. I've got the process down more or less, and there are those tedious bits you just work through: reattaching the rear window, getting the hole from the top to align into the door channels and screwing/unscrewing the bolts that attach the top to the roll cage. Sure, it's not terribly difficult, but it is annoying. Thankfully these guys practically remove that step and make it as easy as can be.<br /><br />Four stars because I do get a little concerned sometimes when working with them as the ass-end of the spring-loaded mechanism in the bow will sometimes stick out with it's c-clip showing-- something that it looks like it's not supposed to do. Still, hasn't been an issue yet after several removal and reinstalls of the top.
B000E35UV2|4|Should have noted and pictured that it comes with a ca[p. I bought one for nothing
B0094BG9SS|5|These are easy to use and stay locked in place for my paddle board
B007ICDFVY|4|After receiving the wrong part twice the third one actually fit perfect and sounds great.  Great customer service as well!
B003JLDQNK|5|Great tool for your bike! Safe and easy to use very reliable plus sexy looking!
B005GBQANO|5|This is a super high quality vinyl decal, not a sticker. As soon as I got mine, I immediately ordered three more. Also, mine came with two, one in white for dark background, and one in black for light background, I couldn't have been more pleased with this purchase.
B0080E7LPA|5|worked like a charm.
B00S87GK2O|1|Great Price and they look great too, as long as you don't turn them on. These things are not worth the stamp to get them to you. Now I know why they gave free shipping. I got Amazon suckered again. Don't get them unless you want less light than that of the bulb you are replacing. Oh and I bought 2 packs too. Man I feel double suckered. Now lets see how hard it is to return them.
B000YE6T20|5|Worked perfectly in my C10 Pickup! Clutch releases smoothly and silently
B0014SOUWG|1|There are no installation instructions.
B00069CN2I|5|Worked really good! Fit my 2004 suburban well. I would recommend getting small circle mirrors to stick on them for a better view.
B000EQVXRE|5|OEM Replacement for my 2008 Corvette Z06. Fit perfectly.
B0001EW4FY|5|i always discounted the ventvisor as a pimp out decoration. wrong! quite useful, it's been a hot summer in the city and with my windows cracked and the vent visor conccealing them, the temps when getting in the cars is much lower, driving with the windows down is much quieter while driving. a win win situation. i have not had to use my windshield shade very much this summer.
B00XFNI3L2|5|Perfect.
B005R1P2PU|3|If you  are a professional don't buy it 35 years in collision repair didn't meet my expectations, maybe for week end warriors might be alright
B00F542DQU|5|Low cost and good!
B006K8V3NE|5|perfect for the job !!!
B00P2VLFK6|5|Really made a difference, I think the amount of safety these things offer is worth the money!
B00L6MOWPU|5|Great looking and versatile
B00IO94I8Y|5|Perfect fit. Easy install.
B000IYTXNS|5|its and works fine on a mercury cougar 2.5 year 98.5
B0013K3YRW|5|great
B00CA5PJ5O|2|Material (keys) were fine. Service from vendor was decidedly unimpressive.
B000QGCLFU|5|I feel much more visible now. I'm glad I bought these
B00W8LR4US|5|Have had these before. They are great for letting you crack you window open and keeping out the rain.
B003BZD08U|5|Unit works fine, would purchase again if needed.
B000BN84J0|5|Perfect fit! Heavy duty fabric that feels like it will last a long time.
B003Z9UUUS|4|This is a good product,well made and very durable. My only two beefs are with the clamping system which tends to scratch you if you aren't careful! Also the actual fit could have been a little nicer seeing that these are used on today's more modern bed designs. They should be more &#34;custom&#34; fitted to lines of the bed. I'm  using this on my 2014 ram quadcab.time will tell!
B0001EXR28|5|Great product, excellent service, thanks!
B0016KA9PY|5|For my first brake controller I was nervous to buy a lower priced model. I wired this to a 2011 Tahoe and pulled a 7500lb travel trailer.  Worked great.  After adjusting the gain up a little bit, I had a smooth and safe braking experience.  Would buy for another vehicle.
B000CQOIR8|5|Worked perfectly on my truck.
B000BQR100|5|I was worried these wouldn't be any larger than an old set I have, but they are and fits my large Toyota Prius (2009) window really well. Maybe not as perfect as the actual Prius sun shades out there, but I'm glad I spent the $8 on these instead of $20 more minimum. These are working great for the money spent!
B0002RNSG4|5|Great product - easy to install on Jeep Liberty so a trailer could be towed. The price for this product was more than fare. The other option would have been to rent a vehicle every time there is a need to tow a trailer.
B002VIDP5G|5|Works great, which is what you'd hope for in something to stop your vehicle.
B001FC79EW|5|Workgood !!
B00HGAL64G|1|Shift knob was delivered on time but the product itself was scuffed up. The shift knob is cool looking and solid but it looks like a returned item and the momo logo is poorly applied
B00466V9AY|5|Works fine and easy to program.
B0018JVJIE|5|This oxygen sensor is excellent.  I made sure it was the correct one before ordering and, upon arrival, I was able to install it easily.  It came with the anti-seize compound for the threads as well as the rubber boot to keep water out of the vehicle where the wire comes through the floor pan.  After installation I cleared my diagnostic codes and then started the car.  I monitored the output of this sensor using a real time monitoring scan tool and it worked perfectly.  I have since driven 2,000 miles and the Check Engine Light has not turned on.  I saved almost $200 compared to what the car dealer wanted to charge me to replace this sensor.
B0021KVFG0|5|The wire harness was easy to connect up to my 2011 MDX.  Just plug it into the fuse box located on the back left side and it’s pretty much ready to go.  In the instruction, they wanted you to just leave the harness hanging out of back door hatch when in use and stow away in the back compartment when not in use.  It doesn’t look very professional with wires hanging out the back door.  What I did to keep all the wires hidden was route the wires thru existing manufacture pre-cut holes.  There are also pre-cut holes to run your wire harness to the underside of the vehicle.  To expose these pre-cut holes, you will have to remove the compartment door and carpet and also the plastic molding, (see pictures).  There is also an existing bolt there that you can connect your ground to.  These pre-cut holes has rubber cap covering them that you can pop off easily.  I used these rubber caps and run my harness thru them to protect the wires from the sharp edges of the pre-cut hole.  To run my harness thru the rubber cap, I had to cut a round hole out of the middle of the rubber cap and cut thru one side of the rubber cap then run my wires thru it.  I used Duct Tape to give it a snug fit around the rubber hole.  I also wrapped the wire with Duct Tape wherever it comes in contact with sharp metal edges.  I hope this helps.<br /><br />Update 8/14/15<br />I ordered a mounting bracket, CURT 58001 which give it a cleaner look.  No more zip ties.
B0049E4VJO|5|works great
B00BYS6YDO|5|Good substitute for anti-freeze if you never drive in freezing areas. You can then handle cooling leaks with deionized water instead of expensive anti-freeze.<br /><br />Modern radiators have been designed to be lighter by making the radiator ends lighter with plastic. It's false economy. Designers now overload cars with bells and whistles and then try to compensate with lighter but weaker components, especially plastic. My car at 178,000 miles would not have needed any repairs if the old time components were used. But plastic radiator, thermostat housing, fuel pump and spark plug transformer parts have cost me between 3 and 4 thousand dollars in repair.
B003W04A7O|5|best!!
B0062B0F6K|5|Great car parts and swift shipping!  Happy! :)
B00BUHL8E4|5|Ordered these months earlier.  Finally got around to the project, and thought I had purchased OEM Mercedes.  So I was a little apprehensive to use these.  But, I've never had a bad Beck-Arnley product so I decided to use them.  They appear to work great!  If anything goes awry, I'll update.
B001CJYBGW|5|worked well.
B001GJ3FIS|5|I really like this unit for the price. WOrks as specified and seems well made.
B00029J3JI|5|Great build quality, even the paint is shiny. Sounds great on my 2013 Victory.
B0023VGFDK|5|Worked great!
B0002U1TVW|2|Great product - disappointed the soft pad that normally comes with it was missing
B00AO6I20A|5|I liked the helmet, but the one I received was defective. The visor doesn't come down.
B00JZL91GY|1|Don't buy it!! It comes with small alligator clips to connect to your car battery. The clips are way to small, becomes disconnected when driving over the slightest bump. Seller claims it only had a 90 day warranty, but it actually had a one year warranty and they won't honor it.
B00J9QQU0K|5|Fits good, protects from my dogs claws
B000W0RQ8C|5|Fast shipping...smooth transaction...just what I needed and wanted
B0057B5Q9C|5|It was a perfect fit and delivered in a timely manner. Will be purchasing items from here again.
B002YKQNL4|5|perfect product
B00JYMZ8HK|4|Works great.
B0016LE80K|5|Worked like a charm to eliminate the problem of having a bulky 4-port USB charger fitting into a recessed cigarette lighter port.  The wire gauge is large enough to handle the current of two Quick Charge 2.0 chargers working at the same time. Extenders have caps on them so that nothing can fail into them if they're not being used.
B004ZF39T0|1|These lights are absolute trash I had to order a second ballast and bulb with in the the first 2 weeks. I upgraded from 10000k to 20000k. The 20000k bulbs were not as advertised they were not the right color or brightness. In fact the 20000k bulbs were not the same color as one another one is white and one is a light blue. Anyways if I could rate 0 stars I would.
B003E1GLSM|4|The only problem was it's heavy to hold up and tighten up.
B00445KJHG|5|They fit great look even better.
B00N33D15M|4|Quick Delivery- Product Good
B001CEG9AI|4|This is the correct filter for a 2001 Volvo V70.  it's a pain to install, but worth it only to see how bad the old installed one was.  I expect many have never ever changed this before, like my car, but after, you will feel sooooooo good.
B009AFFYR0|5|Work as they should
B007H2PP1S|4|Good product.
B00SEMFVBO|5|Very good quality and it fits.
B003FHLNVK|5|Awesome product,  it turns a cheap (but protective) helmet into a quiet place to focus on the road
B00QXLV0FE|5|This is an awesome product.  It has exceeded my expectations and my wife loves the look and feel of the seat covers.  Customer service is top notch too. There was a problem with the custom design that I sent so they offered a few extra items at no cost and then rapidly shipped it to me at no cost. It highly recommend these seat covers with this company.
B00BCR64GY|3|I love these but they ripped on me. Will use as long as I can..  I get a lot of compliments on..
B00FTB3MPA|5|Great product and delivered quickly.
B00OIOY0QY|1|Waste of money. They beep constantly in reverse whether any things behind me or not
B00L8TA2T6|5|Very bright light bar not as good as a rigid but pretty good and nice build quality. I suggest not using the mounts that come with it I say you should get custom ones for it to look good on the vehicle
B00C5TFFWW|5|Good Fiolter
B0002XRUNK|5|Perfect fit.
B000EQB6Q2|5|So far so good...works like it should.
B00TUHX736|5|Better quality than another set I tried to order in blue but were on back-order.  It all worked-out just fine.  And they fit the recipient's Prius C just fine.
B006N94XAA|5|Good...
B009LLUVHG|5|This truck sticker in displayed with great pride
B009DJV2J2|5|Easy to install, just replace the rivets with nuts and bolts.
B00DFT98WO|3|The key i received did not match with what was needed for my 97 bmw f650.
B000CB2410|1|did not work
B00SB3OYW8|1|product looks like trash, cheaply made garbage....don't waist your money, oh and they make you pay for return shipping. amazon has really gone down the tubes
B000C7USNU|5|Perfect fit in my 1997 Jeep Wrangler TJ
B00VKQIGSQ|5|fit my 2015 eco diesel as good or better than stock. No problems
B00R8N39P0|5|I LOVE IT
B000BGJW5M|5|Exact fit for my Palomino Thoroughbred.  Easy swap......
B00LPSEPVG|5|I like it so much!
B00EOA46SY|5|fit great !!!
B0012ETJ1O|1|OEM bulbs in my Honda lasted 10 years. These lasted on 10 weeks. Do not buy. Poor quality and durability.
B000CINDQ8|5|Good stuff for repairs on rusty auto body. Easier to use than the fiberglass I have used in the past because of the thick consistency. Hardens completely within 24 hours and is really strong when fully hardened.
B00GSAUHB8|5|&#34;This sunshield covers the entire windshield and does a good job of blocking some of the penetrating heat this time of year!&#34;
B004VGAJOG|5|I ordered these for 1999 toyota corolla. The price was great, easy to install, and it came very quickly. It's so nice to have working door handles again!
B000E4QPJ2|5|Great product. When it arrived I went on-line downloaded installation instructions. The install turned out to be a snap and I'm not mechanically at all. Very happy with it!
B00CJIZW5O|5|Excellent product
B002PK2TD4|5|Great gun if you are spraying latex. Use Flotrol and water for better flow.
B00BENM7T4|5|GREAT JOB
B00RM3T8II|3|I thought it would have more than just an on/off button, but it wasn't expensive.
B003ZVSFLM|1|Was not what they described. Didn't even fit. ONE plastic cap. Overpriced item. Was very upset when I received it.
B001C97UW4|5|Been on 2 months no problems. Easy install
B000GU5CR0|5|Great item as described; real nice addition to rear fender.
B0012H0N3E|5|These have not been used yet, next camping trip is not for a month, but I like the way they look, think they will be pretty when lit
B00652G4TS|5|High quality piece of equipment. Performs flawlessly. Must have tool. Dirt cheap.<br />W.B. Robbins
B000BNS9FE|1|Well, it says that fits Dodge Ram 1500 ,2005 , but it don't. There are 2 ways to install the brackets, 1500 mode and 2500,3500 mode.mine does not fit in the 1500 way, it fits in 2500-3500 way ,and not in a perfect fit, even my truck is  a Ram 1500.....and when you install the bull bar, it stay tilted to the truck grill. It does not fit straight, if I want to make fit straight, I' ll have to replace the holes with a file. &#34; no drilling, no modifications&#34; is your slogan. That is not true. Westin, help me. I do not want this bar in this conditions.
B00E5NO07W|5|Great decal. Very easy instructions and it looks great on the back window of my tacoma. Received the product in a couple days. Thank you to the seller, i will be ordering additional decals at a later time.
B00513G82U|5|Was a bit skeptic when i order it but very pleased when it arrived. Wife very pleased with additional comfort and storage space
B00029J3ES|5|A little louder than I had hoped, but tolerable and has a great sound to it.
B001UCGPVU|5|very nice
B0058J51XO|2|I bought a pair of these headlights for my 2009 Tacoma in January of 2015 and I already have burnt spots from my highs in August of 2015..... I wouldn't of been disappointed but I only use my high beams maybe a total of 2 hours a month. I also had 4 LEDs out after taking it out of the box.
B000AZ7U76|5|As expected<br />Fast arrival. Good price!
B000E2CVIS|5|Filtered the sh*t out of my oil. #imlovingit!!
B006SYNF9K|2|Not what I thought..
B003CMIH2Q|5|good
B000CN4ZY2|5|Just what I needed to go along with my Edelbrock 1405 carb
B00OV7HKA6|5|Amazing battery life. One of the best product out there.
B00WY8A36M|5|worked
B000BRJVSY|5|Great deal! Love the lights!!
B00ANA5USY|5|This floor mat fit like a glove and is easy to clean. it keeps the Grandkids spills very well contained.
B000Z0HVHA|5|Needed the extra length.
B00P02LRFA|5|Great airfreshner with aloha style.
B000C1LLPA|5|I got these for my wife's solara, I am a repeat customer, VERY SATISFIED with akebono pads, low dust, super stopping power especially the way my wife drives, I will only buy akebono from now on, thank you Amazon for fast delivery
B000C36BIK|5|I  have purchased 2 other top line belts for my Corvette and this belt is the best, no noise and really good. I suggest these belts for everyone looking for your last belt....
B00QI7FLL2|4|Perfectly fit my suv & good quality materials.  4 stars because there's no instruction.  Update: The round hook is not sticking very well.
B002M2OITI|3|I order 4 sparkplugs  and one came broken. hope to get replacement for the broken one. and i will rate 5 stars. thanks and blessings
B00HWI45SG|5|Awesome stuff. Fit perfect look good. Arrived when supposed to. Easy installation. Would buy and recommend all day.
B00G6188EM|5|great product. makes my motorcycle pictures that much cooler!
B0091OE6K6|5|Absolutely perfect. I had clips like this on my seat belt for 15 years, and one finally broke from sun/heat wear on the plastic.  I am tall enough that without them, I'm not completely strangled, but short enough that I'm *much*  more comfortable with one of these clips. I couldn't find them in stores anywhere near me, and I was not willing to wait for the stores to restock, so I ordered these. Great price, arrived very quickly, and the plastic is durable enough that it should hold up for many years of use.
B00D3298A0|3|Kind of hard to customize, despite the &#34;one-size fits all&#34; sales approach. It still didn't fit in my 2012 veloster perfectly. It kind of lays on top of the gas pedal and it smelled up my car like cheap rubber for weeks, but they are more durable than the stock floor mats.
B0009X1MHS|5|Nice item. Good price.
B000E7WLJW|5|3 years and still great
B00EOBMFAY|4|The casting on the rotors looks good compared to others I've seen.<br /><br />I bought this set to do the Tacoma upgrade to Tundra brakes. I'll be doing the actual upgrade in a couple weeks, and suspect it'll go just fine.<br /><br />One source of confusion though...there is a UPS return label in one of the boxes.  There's no mention of a core charge or any other paperwork.  I called the phone number on the return sticker but the call won't go through...  Also the calipers came with clear plastic bags in each box...but neither one was in one.
B00D130CA6|5|Awesome and on time.
B00864CKG4|5|Fits better than expected feels great, I'm really excited about it.
B004I0OGSU|5|No issues
B001FAIA3I|5|works great
B003CSSE64|5|worked a treat!
B00OGGU5B8|5|Exactly what it said it was. I am happy
B004ABHD14|5|actually used this on my Weber BBQ valves when I rebuilt them.
B00CYOF2JE|5|Just as described, quick delivery, no problems. Very satisfied.
B0053H3WQ4|5|The packaging was so neat and professional! Everything was intact, no damage. The hid's look amazing! Would definitely buy again!
B00W4ZQUG2|1|I bought this set of mats for my brand new vehicle. To say that I am disappointed is a huge understatement. They are extremely poor quality. There is absolutely no way that anyone even glanced at them before they threw them in the box and sent them to me!!
B002SE1EN8|5|2011 kia soul (plus) perfect fit
B000E2CVIS|5|is an oil filter and I guess it does that
B00NWGZ3A6|5|Started using this device to test my speaker connections for any shorts and connectivity problems. I like the large display, lightness in weight, as well as the size being small enough to fit in a front shirt pocket.
B004ME11FS|5|We have had no issues with this product and would purchase again.
B00AN9OQ9Y|5|Perfect they look good
B0049Z43J6|5|very good!
B00CQ43QJU|5|This is a good cargo liner and worth the money. It does not have the grips on the underside that the other Husky liners have, but I don't have a problem with it staying in place. It fits my 2015 Rav4 perfectly.
B001GBJQCA|5|Super easy to install (by handy person). High quality part. Well worth the money. Very thorough instructions. Most importantly, all the functions worked. Everything needed was supplied in the kit except for the mounting bracket. I bought a different brand bracket and the bolt pattern did not match and had to be drilled out; no big deal.
B009R1DQF4|5|These worked well when I decided to replace my splash shield myself. The key was removing the old pins, and the key is to rotate the pin before trying to remove it. I bought extra just in case (and was glad I did). The parts were well made, made for a quick install, and arrived quickly. Thanks for the great service!
B000LVBQBU|4|Work well and installed quickly on 2006 Toyota Avalon.
B001GH1NR0|5|Works great. Easy to install and did what I wanted.
B005M16QY6|4|slides around some but stays on good enough
B009OHH4FO|5|I've used welpers like these for years on job sites for MIG welding. Only thing is, these are much better made then the ones the companies I worked for supplied. And the great part besides being a great multi-function tool is that they are  MADE IN USA !
B00IO4EYMY|5|great deal
B00KS3BGAM|3|Recently purchased these for the dash/cluster, in my jeep grand Cherokee. these lights are blue but are not very bright...
B004306VTC|5|We have had this rug outdoors for several months now. Absolutely no fading. Only a few snags, due to our dog. Otherwise a great product and beautiful on our deck.
B00KTIFAZI|5|Amazing!  I had the remotes programmed almost instantly.  I did make a mistake (tested each one after the door locked, which really unprogrammed them all), but I realized what I had done and reprogrammed them all again within minutes.  These were a great value and so user friendly.  And now my six year old can't lock my only set of keys in my car again!  And I love the color.  The red really stands out in darkness of a purse.
B00LX6PWZS|4|nice
B00XC2KVPC|2|Replacing bulbs in an RV to preserve battery power.  Had problems with fit, really had to push hard to get them in the sockets.  Also, color of the light changes after they are on a couple minutes.  Warm at first, but changes to a blue-er tint. I also bought another similar set of lights that had fewer of the same 5630 diodes on each bulb (6 instead of 10), were cheaper and were advertised as fewer lumen, but I don't see much difference in brightness (or color after they are on for a bit) when side by side.  I expected these to be brighter and warmer based on the description.
B000182F1S|5|AVS original visors are the only way to go. I have bought many sets for vehicles I've owned. Just installed a set on a 04 Trailblazer and these set off the look so well. Perfect fit every time.
B0094JJEIC|5|Fast shipping and great price.  These are going for $300 in my local market.
B00KPWBE1C|5|This looks suspiciously like the same bumper I have seen other companies sell for twice the cost... hmmm. Well, I needed something to match my front bumper on my JK and decided to take the gamble and order this guy. Surely enough it's construction is solid, and it looks like it was made from the exact same factory that my front bumper was made from (and if some forum posts are to be believed, then it was).<br /><br />Installs easy enough, looks good and is definitely solid. Haven't bumped anything with it yet, but have used it to tow and have had quite a bit of weight on it. If you're looking for a tube bumper and you think this one looks good enough, trust me, it's that and then some.
B00D9E3GTG|3|Not a good picnic blanket<br />I really only bought this because of the design.<br />It's cheaply made, and I wouldn't use it more than once.<br />I can't complain however, it reflects its price accurately.<br />It's below average.
B000EDUUIA|5|Moved into a new home.  My wife's Suburban is the main vehicle we put this in front of currently.  She pulls in, and so far she can easily tell when she hits it.  I'm confused as to how people cannot, but I can't answer to that.<br /><br />This is fairly new, so the tape is holding it down well.  It is taped directly to the cement floor.  It is holding fine, but I can easily see that this could be an issue, but tape on cement is what it is.  I'll replace with new 2 sided if necessary, but so far this isn't an issue.
B00D3298A0|4|I ordered these mats to help protect the rugs in my car from getting worn and stained, because they're flexible they fit perfectly and work great! Best of all they don't have that strong rubber smell like most mats do.
B00627X88Q|2|Be sure to realize that this is a WET lube - I wanted the dry, and missed that detail since it wasn't listed in the description.
B001TI5IIQ|4|Ive tried several different headlight restorers, many that were more expensive than this.  This one provided the best results and was easier to use without the need for power tools and masking tape.
B005PCBOU8|4|look nice
B00I50553E|5|Truck looks great.  Raised it.  Mean looking stance.
B006K8YQYW|5|Worked perfect, like brand new again.
B001M1A0XI|5|I get a lot of compliments on this. People notice you more and that always is a positive when riding a motorcycle!
B00KTIUTP4|4|NObody had the ballz to cut the keys for me and everyone (including my searches) pointed to ACE hardware. The people at the key/auto department were amazingly patient (going back and forth to my wifee's TT to make sure it opens the doors correctly). We've only been using these as remotes. They're easy to program if you get the exact instructions. It took me a while to find/grab this generous blog post:<br /><br />You will need BOTH remote key fobs to reprogram one or both of them.<br /><br />1. Take a key you DO NOT want to reprogram and put it in the ignition (this is your original factory key you need to operate the car).<br /><br />2. Turn the ignition on but DO NOT start the engine.<br /><br />3. Put the second key in the drivers door lock. Whilst it is in the lock press the UNLOCK button once only (the lights should flash on the car but the doors will remain locked).<br /><br />4. With the second key still in the drivers door lock, unlock and then lock the door again.<br /><br />5. Remove the key from the door lock.<br /><br />6. Open the car and remove the original/driving key from the ignition.<br /><br />7. Now test the key that you have reprogrammed, the one you have removed from the door lock.<br /><br />If both your remotes don't work, do all of the above for the first key, but at step number 3. press the UNLOCK button TWICE. The light will flash twice and then proceed onto step 4 and finish the procedure.<br /><br />- beats getting original audi items at ridiculous prices... getting all my gear at amazon and ebay!
B00N48LYIM|2|I ordered one that i though fit, i am trying to return it since it does not fit.I did reorder one.Have not heard back on the return since last week, i did re-notify and have since received an acknowledgement but still not return process.
B00ID7EDRI|5|Fit perfectly.  No problems at all with any of the wiring.  Took only 5 minutes.
B00PQWN5DQ|5|Outstanding delivery time, air gauge small fits in my center console, the end swivels making it very easy to check the air on all tires, even the spare tire.
B00RCEDOUK|2|Does not fit 2015 model. But it works. There is a gap between the product and my bumper but can only be seen from the top or side. Does not come with screws for the license plate, only bolts for the bumper.
B00JXZKHRY|5|seems to be perfoirming exceptionally well since the install last week
B0049MEE0C|5|Not sure why it's so cheap, but it works good so far. It has the standard threaded top for those trigger/gauge combo hoses.
B0063MIAV0|5|Sweet!
B00PX6E02U|5|Easy installation and durable, comfortable fabric.Well worth the money, for sure!
B0049YOR2K|5|Exact match to my OEM part and easy to install on my 2008 Lincoln Navigator
B0002NYDYO|4|Need this if you want to pack your own grease.
B001C6JCTQ|5|These are it. There on point like no ones business. Buy them even if you don't own a Honda or even a car
B00H3JPKEW|3|Good enough to protect my key, as I drop it quite often. It is bit too bulky, and loose on the key. After all, It is okay and keeps my key in better shape than my old Vw key, haha!
B00JVPFI48|5|Attached to the front corner of our travel trailer to get some extra light as you approach the awning area and door. Works very well; not super bright but more than enough for this purpose. I used the velcro strip included with the light, so the light comes off when traveling. Only downside that I've seen is that the motion sensor isn't doesn't pick up movement until you're pretty close to the corner.
B000JFJMFK|5|Perfect fit.
B00802GX4W|3|Would've given five stars but one ballast relay didn't function and the customer service rep didn't know what was in stock etc.
B00BD40BRY|5|It was what i expected.
B00UBYTTCU|5|Brightest ever can't wait to put it on the Rincon
B00153CXNI|5|Killer little inverter. As a field tech, I can power a laptop, multiple computers and attached peripherals, LAN switches, etc., Works great!
B00S75A5KU|2|I purchased three sets, H13, H11 and 9005. H13 was suppose to go in to my wife's Jeep, but right after installation both bulb started flickering and turning/on off randomly independent of each other. Then I tried 9005 as a high beam/running light in subaru. It was fine as far as brightness go, but it was not working in hi/low mode, it only worked in Hi, so I could not use it as a daytime running light, because I would be blinding everyone. Last one was H11 for subaru low beam. It was clearly not new out of the box, with stickers torn off and just thrown in the box, but I decided to give it a try anyways, and unfortunately compared side by side with standard halogen bulb, led bulb was noticeably dimmer. So I ended up sending all three kits back. Sad that it could have been great product, but I suspect is simply ruined by poor manufacturing quality.
B0097X6730|5|This mattress has greatly improved our camping enjoyment. It is very firm. If you are looking for some thing like your grandma's feather bed this is not it.It conforms to your body as you sleep and move while also giving very good support.
B002GJQ1ZG|5|Lots of options here.  Good value!
B000C2JUG6|2|its makes noise when braking
B00QFY2BCK|5|Excellent product
B00I07E0D8|1|Might be a good product on the right fitment. Unfortunately OpticsPlanet support doesn't seem to know what that is. I called them before ordering to confirm compatibility, they confirmed and I ordered. After I received it and found it was not correct, I call them again to be told, &#34;no that doesn't fit&#34;. Complete waste of time. Returning mine when they get around to a return approval.
B0002Q804K|5|I rewired my whole jeeps tail lights with this kit after having a wiring short that dealership wanted to charge me thousands to fix. I rewired everything from scratch to the rear and now I have no problems with my taillights and I'm ready for a trailer in the future.
B000FOUB8M|5|Very nice!!!
B0085N4PLY|3|Ive heard a couple of bad things about it . first off the company doesnt tell you that you have to have something welded into it so that your o2 senser can be screwed back into it  . secondly , i had a friend that took the headers off after he used them for a while and realized the airways didnt match up perfectly to the holes on the engine block . so i have some mixed emotions about it.  also the flex tube is cheap as hell , whenever a gas it i hear this weird whistling /buzzing noise
B00NEL75AA|5|Filter arrived a bit early and works great. It seems to clear odors & smoke fairly well too. That was unexpected. I've ordered another for my wife's new car.
B00C626RTS|5|My husband is very happy with this purchase
B000HEBR3I|5|works great, i found that the 6 gal. gas can was heavy to lift, now i fill my tractor wit no problem. I am very happy with my purchase
B000WJGLZC|1|i don't think it is going to work on my scooter, which is a aprilia scarabeo 500. If i cann't make it work I'll send it back for a refund.
B00HHIWTCU|5|works perfectly
B000C9NRUE|5|great product!
B000GTXD4K|5|These are NOT high quality glasses, but awesome for the price. I had my prescription put in them and I love the fit, style, and how well they protect my eyes from the wind while riding. The great thing about them is if the frames wear out or break, for about $10 I can replace them. I'm a big fan! Besides, my wife says they look great on me :)
B00IMIZGRY|4|The fit is difficult.  They do not fit as well as the original fixtures.  They have a bit of an upward trajectory so you will either need the specialty tool to adjust the beam in-place or you will have to take the fixture out and do some trial-and-error.  The retaining ring for the headlamp is next to impossible to lock.  I ended up using some spa lube (for spa and pool O-rings) to get the ring to engage with the help of a screw driver and the gentle tap of a hammer.<br /><br />The driver-fixture was missing the retaining ring for the headlamp.  I contacted the seller, provided pictures, and they were kind enough to send a replacement fixture to me.<br /><br />Overall I'll give them a Good just based on the fact that the seller has excellent customer service.
B00K33GT7M|1|not for automatic
B006X0C5QI|5|worked great the pigtail wire colors even matched the vehicle.
B001UGLKK2|5|Great helmet!!!
B005LE402E|4|nice
B0007XQ3UQ|4|It's a manual.
B003ZMDAJS|5|My daughters loved it !
B00AGRTRTC|5|awesome and so easy to install ,
B005MZXFR8|4|Nice magnet for the price can't beat it i chose to use a razor and cut out the white in the middle of the magnet by the loop of the ribbon it looks much better like that
B0012ZEZ8A|4|Great kit with lots of important pieces. I researched and this was a very good buy for the money.
B000TYSBTO|5|Good
B00NMQWZRK|5|Fits perfect!  Hides all the armrest blemishes, comfy to lean on.
B00HUBXBBM|5|i bought a truck in march and though the seats are good I have a shortage of length to see clearly over the hood. this cushion worked perfectly for me. it doesn't raise me up too high and it stays put.
B005JFMCQ6|4|I purchased this lanyard because for the price, it was decent. I didn't expect much; I just wanted something to put my keys on where I wouldn't loose them as easily. When it came in the mail I was pleasantly surprised. It's made out of soft material, and the print on the lanyard itself was clear. For the price, it's not only served its purpose, it's held up. I would definitely would suggest this product to anyone who wants a decent key holder for a decent price.
B00EHIPITY|5|makes my Silverado look very nice, I am glad I went with this upgrade.
B00NHIWKXW|4|The product looks great on the seats.<br />For me, I have black original seats, so the color difference is very obvious between the car seat and the seat cover, so I should have bought black color, but.. what the hell. It still looks good.<br />One thing though,<br />There is back-padding on the on the front seat covers and it hurt my back pretty bad, so eventually I had to tear the side and take out the sponge(?), then seating become very comfortable.<br />It would have very been nice if the back cushions on the front covers were placed a couple of inches higher.
B0010E00T6|5|Saved a lot of dough. Installation was very simple and was worth it, seemed that the old filter was never changed at the shops.<br />Air improvement is terrific, i even think it gives a nice smell to the car now. Perfect packaging. Can tell this is a pro item. Thanks =)
B00LG07MZE|3|This shade is an ambitious effort to fit a wide range of cars.  However on a late model Toyota Prius (2015), it is rather too wide, but definitely not tall enough; making it a struggle to get to stay in place.  They should be making another size for more recent taller windshields.
B004FJKDP4|5|Fits my 2001 civic lx sedan and was half the cost compared to Honda Auto Parts at the dealership.
B00U6CBAEW|5|With 2 kids in the back seat and a third row seat to boot things can get pretty unorganized quickly in the car. I had a previous organizer that was pretty cheap and nothing compared to the quality and room that this organizer gives me. With this trunk organizer things have gotten a lot easier to manage everything that has to go with us when we're making a family outing! From items that we always bring with us in the car but don't always use (jumper cables, extra water bottles, an umbrella) to whatever needs to go in the stroller that we don't want loose in the back while we're driving (snacks, water, a tablet, etc) this organizer can take it all!<br /><br />You'd think in an SUV that you would never run out of space but anyone with kids will know just how untrue that can be. This seriously has been a lifesaver on keeping me safe (from a wife who always wants the car clean that is!) Joking aside this is durable, easy to attache, will stay secure to the seat, and looks good on top of it. A great investment for the back of any SUV! A double win is I've got at least one person I know who loves it which it'll make a great Christmas present for.
B0048YEJ0G|5|I got these because my old ones broke. I have had them for about a month and love them.
B006RUJ2D8|5|This product is amazing.  I used a hairdryer and plastic razor blade to remove decals on a travel trailer.  That worked well.  When finished, just spray on the Rapid Remover and in less than a minute I wiped off all the glue.  This product saved hours of buffing and scrubbing.
B00MS98MWY|5|Insanely bright led lamps, looks awesome on my cab over project, almost to bright lol
B000BUU5Z4|5|I like it!
B0027ETL5W|5|great product
B005JOAOLW|4|Works well fits good
