1439102724|5.0|I think this is one of Jodi Picoult's best books to date. As with all her books, she deals with issues that are controversial and evoke strong feelings and opinions in everyone. She manages to do this without seeming like she has her own agenda. I also love how this book is told from the point of view of various characters, it adds a serious depth to the story. Strong, powerful, and very touching. A great read.
B000AOEMXM|5.0|it's great... .... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ./.. ,... ... ... ... ... ... .
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this app and use the plans everyday unless I'm in an area where I cannot get connected.  I also use the daily verse to post to my Facebook page.  The only thing that I would recommend is in the Plans to list the Bible verse first and then the devotional text.  Also, if possible to use our current location in the Search for a Live Event.  I love being able to switch to different versions to see how the same verse(s) are worded.  Thanks for a GREAT product!
B00A12VW86|5.0|It just show why Green Day has stood the test of time, they are the best. Always enjoy their music.
1439152780|4.0|This is another good book by a great author. Kate Morton keeps you interested and involved and writes a compelling storyline as usual.
B001EBV0OY|5.0|I never write reviews, but I always read them, lol. This is my all time favorite movie it is a Classic! The acting was excellent, and the story line was executed beautifully. This is a movie you should always have in your collection, and take out on those lazy afternoons to watch.
0345803493|2.0|The first book was captivating! Everything was amazing the sexual portions were erotic.<br /><br />This book almost every sexual portion it ends the same way... They came together and colasped....How unrealistic is that lol
B001929D38|5.0|I didn't know Green day had a split personality but I thouroughly enjoy them playing as the Foxboro Hot tubs.
B002JIOOB2|5.0|this is one of my all time favorite shows. the characters are awesome and not your typical stereotypes. I love most of the storyline, although t does get a little crazy toward the last season. But its entertaining and you feel like you are watching friends by the end. Love it.
0525953728|5.0|purchased as gift. The recipient loved it. and would like to have some more books<br />in a series about the same subject.
B001NLKXK2|4.0|recommended for anyone who is dealing with this subject.  helps you understand waht is going on and how they feel
B009B51K9U|5.0|Another reason why this band will always be my favorite band and I will continue to support them and their efforts.
B000VNMMR0|5.0|bruce willis at his best. if your an action fan, this movie is really non-stop. there is a person somewhere in america shutting down the entire system and someone has to find him before the whole country goes up in smoke. i can tell you one thing for sure; you will put this movie on pause if you half to go out of the room.
B0017JKEL8|5.0|This amazing throwback into the industrial workplace of the 1960s is a brilliant show with intriguing and flawed characters that grab your attention and never let go.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|If you believe in magic this is the book for you.  Very interesting and a book that will take you away from your everyday
1884883303|4.0|It is very good for your common guitars, amps... especially for the price. It mentions, but does not value less popular guitar makers... there are better guides out there for that.<br /><br />Great price at Amazon.com ($19.00, no tax and free shipping if you bump your order up to $25.00) as opposed to ordering it from Vintage Guitar, $25.00 plus shipping, tax ?????)
B0009MDPYM|5.0|did you like the exorcist? well this is better. take a trip into the world that few have seen and even fewer want to. if your a fan of good vrs evil you are not going to miss this movie. follow a man who already knows where he is going after he dies and he hates deamons with a passion. one of the best movies i have seen.
B004GYY714|5.0|I can listen to stations from all over the world and now many are in my favorites! I would highly recommend this app to the music collector or any individual who enjoys finding great music created all over the globe.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|I am not sure I could do what this mom did however I do understand her reasoning.. Mothers will do anything to save a child from others or themselves.
B002RKSZPS|5.0|The genius of Chesterton lies not in the specific things that he says (many of the ideas he speaks of are already dead and vanished), but in the way he teaches his listeners to dissect problems and viewpoints from the inside-out, turning them on their heads until we see them differently than everyone else sees them.  It's very difficult to put into words exactly what I mean, but this book is a great example, as is his essay collection \\"All Things Considered.\\"
B00009ZYBY|5.0|if you like  russell crowe this is probally his finest movie to date. place yourself as a general in the roman empire leading thousands of soldiers into battle then be striken of your honor and sentenced to die by the emperior's command. see how the general regains his past glory and the loyalty of his fellow soldiers.
B007SGM084|5.0|These books are awesome! I realize I'm not missing much in my marriage, but it is nice to day dream. If you don't have a Christian Gray in your life, you will when you begin to read these novels!
B006LSZECO|5.0|I am almost always able to know the twists and turns of this type of book but I was surprised at every turn.
B002RKRTGO|5.0|There's very little to say about Doyle or Holmes that hasn't yet been said.  The books are classic detective stories that are worth a look from anyone who has even the slightest appreciation for the classics.
B009RH9FR6|5.0|This is a wonderful case, for a number of reasons. First, it serves as a case for the KINDLE FIRE HD, and is very protective and easy to carry around. Next, it is also a great stand, capable of standing the kindle horizontally or vertically. It is well padded. It is very sturdy. I recommend this case for anyone looking for this kind of high quality accessory for the new KINDLE FIRE HD
B004EWFV9K|5.0|as always, Kurt is very entertaining, troubled and ready to solve the mystery.  Interesting to see some of Kurt's past come into play and to watch him go thru the aging process.  Another great addition to the series!
B00A77II0U|5.0|Waited a long time for another mystery game. This one is great on my Kindle. Storyline is fun and graphics worth the money.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Fast moving story in the Grisham tradition. I used Kindle Fire and it was excellent! I have read most of his novels finding them interesting and lively. This was no exception
B00012QM8G|5.0|The packaging with 1 reversible DVD is beyond my understanding.  There is no safe place to touch the disk and honestly, I would have rather had 2 disks than this nonsense.  Why not a Blu-Ray?  Forget about Hi-Def and that stuff, how about Blu-Ray so you can fit it on just one disk and not have to reverse the disk and ruin the mood or the movie?    About the movie.  I have watch it several times and soaked in the story.  I liked it.  It was hard to watch at times, and brutally inhuman other times.  This time I decided to watch the film for technical reasons, even though the story would distract me at times.  So far I have noticed one flaw that seemed to me to be inexcusable.  In the scene where Amon is timing a Jew making a hinge, he then takes the Jew out to shoot him so he can make room for people coming to the camp (from Yugoslavia).  He first uses a Luger to shoot, but it jams many times, then he pulls out what looks like a 9mm Glock out of his right pocket that jams as well, constantly pulling the chamber back and forth to mount the round...nothing.  Amon finally butts the worker in the head and walks off to his right with the Glock in hand.  Then the scene switches to a close up of the soldiers on the left and Amon is in the back ground walking away with a different type of gun in his right hand.  He drops THAT gun on the ground and another officer picks it up.  If you look closely, that gun he drops is now SUDDENLY a revolver, not a Glock, as different a type of handgun as you can get.  How set design can miss that baffles me.  Especially with an intense seen like that to then mess it up by not providing the correct set prop shows how overwhelmed the set crew was or how little they cared about consistency.  What would have made the scene more impactful would have been to keep the props the same so as to NOT distract from the scene by having gross changes like this.  Any glaring alteration in the flow of the script with grab a viewers attention and leave the less of an impact on the awareness.  I might now go through the entire film looking for more of these inconsistencies and distractions.  I have found several camera angle mishaps so far which are minor where they have 2 cameras on a scene but switch back and forth and they are not in sync show seconds before or after the other camera like a time travel event.  This shows a lack of attention to detail in the editing room, but I am looking for clear mistakes.  Perhaps they were tired.  This was a huge effort producing this film.  None of these issues distracts from the message of the film or my like for it, but I have seen it enough times that the errors are now the only parts that are different each time I view it.  It's the errors that create a stutter in my flow of the viewing the film and they stick out like a light bulb in a dark room.  I suppose this happens after you view a film a half dozen or more times.  Were I a film editor, I would not let this happen unless it was part of the delivery of the film, not just a glaring mistake.    Liam Neeson is phenomenal,as usual.  Without him the movie is largely without direction.  Ralph Fiennes provides the urgency the film needs to be intense and provocative while Liam's character placates the tension with a soothing approach.  This back and forth of this feeling in the film is part of why it succeeds, as a crescendo climax of emotions followed by a relaxing recovery before starting up again in a different context.  Both men are attractive to the point of distraction and ideally suited to their roles.  On the flip side of this tension, Ben Kingsley is why this film has a purpose.  There would not be a Schindler's List film at all (or a list for that matter) were it not for this character.  The entire movie pivots on the character he plays.  Without his frank and casual performance to his situation, Ralph would be a random killer instead of a vigilante, and Liam would have nothing to do or a character to play.  And then there is probably the most evasive and mindful roles in the film portrayed by Embeth Davidtz as Helen Hirsch.  Her role is quiet but shows powerfully the good side of Amon and his internal moral conflict, adding depth to his vigilante ways.  Amon is a hard character, harsh, unyielding and relentless, but guided by his love of Helen, showing his personal conflict and showing his compassionate humanity.  Oddly enough, Amon does not use a pistol from the other soldiers when shooting the hinge worker, showing that his pride and emotions guard his actions.  Any true psychopath would not hesitate to find another weapon.  Embeth Davidtz's conviction playing Helen shows how Amon can be taken down with kindness and sincerity, further reinforcing Schindler's role.  Helen's role, while overshadowed by her situation and simple, stands out to me as the more memorable roles in the film, representing tolerance, fear, hope, passion, and despair.  If Ben's role was one of quiet indifference and obsequience to the Germans, then Embeth's role as Helen was to wear obedience at arms length, heart in her hands, affected, but not showing feeling in her face.  At all times I thought she might run away and yet she persisted out of fear but also unwilling to just lay down and die to be free, and that conflict swirled around the other actors, making the film complex, deep and meaningful for me.  Nicely done.    If only the film was technically flawless.....
076790592X|3.0|The pages fell apart when I first opened it. Good thing I bought the movie too.!!! I guess I could have gotten a bad copy.
B0013ND30W|5.0|DVD was totally worth the money. It looks and sounds great. It's kind of cool that it reads the weather forecast in you area and mimics the same weather on the main menu.
0307341577|5.0|Loved it.  I couldn't put the book down. The book was so believable I caught myself crying several times. It was heart wrenching.
B008UUPOVM|5.0|I like this new CD of his because it sounds so different than his previous music! The lyrics actually make sense!
B0089BSOPA|5.0|Thank you so much to Universal Home Video for giving Halloween II the respect it deserves both in the theatrical and tv released blu rays.  There is so much more material out there for both H1 and H2 (original materials from both films that have never been released) so we hope that at some point there is an ultimate release that includes the H1 and H2 out takes as well as all the material that is available for release.  Thank you UHV!!!!!!!
B00A0HQ7H8|5.0|awesome songs from Lana!!  she's fantastic and the best new artist out there.  Melodic, provocative, cinematic, destined to become classic.
B009VLXMJA|4.0|Very nice collection of songs.  I bought this for my daughter and we are planning on going to the Red concert next summer.
B00A6PD8RQ|3.0|CHILDRENGREAT ANIMATION AND INTERESTING PLOT.A GOOD DISNEY FLICK,SUITABLE FOR  WATCHING WITH<br /> YOUN GER FAMILY MEMBERS.  I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS MOVIE
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I would have given it 6 stars but 5 is all I could get, better story line this season I don't miss a episode.
B009GEBBNQ|1.0|boring, predictable, too much CGI and nothing special.<br />The Christopher Nolan Batman films remain far and away the best super-hero films.
B009A3NGF4|5.0|Great mix of upbeat and slower songs.  If you love the Mumford sound you'll love this album too.  The &#34;Boxer&#34; cover is almost as good as the original.
B009R5GR1K|5.0|This app is great! Downloaded the offline version for my Fire and am absolutely delighted with it! Love the pcustomizable home page. Great speed when looking up words. The online version alone was very nice but now I am able to use it on or offline. I highly recommend this app for information and for fun!
B007KFZ7RE|5.0|Add some variety of sound to your collection... interesting music to say the least... love it! Heard the first tune on a car commercial and had to look it up... glad I did.
B0086700CM|2.0|Not a favorite game of mine, probably cause I am not good at it. What can I say? I just keep it on my Kindle for when my friends want to play it.
B0020M99LC|5.0|Great action movie! Good story, loved it. Well worth it to watch. Daniel Craig makes a great Bond. One of my favorite movies.
B0086700CM|5.0|This App Is Awesome But I Have To Redownload It Because My Cousin Restarted My Kindle. I Have To Get All My Highscores Back
B008EZVNO0|5.0|If you are a Van Morrisson fan... this review is completely unnecessary... then again for those which have not been listening to Van... here is your opportunity.
B001PK5TIM|3.0|the gore is cheesy although I did look away a couple of times.  the character of Ruka was fun.  Reminded me of Robocop, with silly TV ads, futuristic setting, and violence
B004FRX0MY|3.0|It is a app to download music and it works<br />It is a app to download music and it works
B009MF56GC|3.0|A worthy (and obviously expensive) effort, but Expendables 2 just didn't have the chemistry of the first one for some reason. Expendables 2 requires serious suspension of disbelief too, but that's part of what makes movies movies I guess. The references to actors' previous movies (and in the case of one actor, his TV show) were funny, but why does Hollywood insist on the glib, silly dialogue throughout action sequences and moments that should be at least semi-serious. There were many parts where I looked at my husband and said, \\"Really?\\"<br /><br />What's up with the bad face lifts and lip jobs these celebrities are sporting?  Can't they afford good plastic surgeons?  And they could have found someone better to play Maggie, the female member of the troop.  Someone who #1, was trained in martial arts. Not that I expect all Asian actors to be prowessed in martial arts, but she did use martial arts in a fight scene and it was obvious she was not trained, and she was terrible.  #2: Someone who was easier on the eyes. Oy. (Then again, her unattractiveness fit in with the \\"misfit\\" qualities of the group.)<br /><br />All in all, an impressive effort that was definitely not boring. My eyes started to glaze over after several hundred violent killings though, and I was ready for it to end about 1/2 an hour before it did.
B009VSW15Y|1.0|Not any good. don't get it....PICTURE IS OF LOW QUALITY.Don't buy it. You willl be sorry if you do. Be warned..
B009FZFONO|5.0|Best show by far.....crazy twist and turn  on every show....thank you baby Jesus.<br />This season is amazing and such great endings for the next episode
B006FTC6ZC|5.0|I received this DVD early and in great shape  everything was in  order - package  and DVD also in great shape have not watched it yet for it is a X-mass gift but will get back to y'all when it is open and watched . Amazon has all ways done right by me so far --Thank. YOU
B005LAIISU|3.0|The kids liked it to an extent, but I didn't love it. Much better animations out there for sure, especially for adult audiences.
B007Q35PLI|5.0|Fun movie, and great for gaining insight into autism... at least from one person's perspective.  We've watched it twice and enjoyed it both times.
6305428425|5.0|I love this movie it's got a great soundtrack I am so happy I got this. Yay for this movie
B00992CF6W|4.0|My kids and I love building our own worlds in creative mode. It is a good game but options are limited on the pocket version.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|I loved this newest set of Batman films. Christian Bale is excellent and the storyline is very believable for a comic book movie.
B007W8S2MG|5.0|This is one of the best RPG games I've ever played. Theres so much to do. Collecting different personas is very addicting. Its kinda like Pokemon. I play this game hours at a time and end up forgetting that I should be sleeping rather than playing. I absolutely love this game. Another great thing is this game is over 100+ hours long. Its so worth the money especially if you like JRPGs like Final Fantasy. WARNING: The game starts off slow for plot setting. However, after a couple of hours it unleashes you and lets you do whatever you want.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|It is scary yet very  fun. however it IS a little short. I wish it was a little longer. cant wait to try part 2.
B004EPYZUI|5.0|Not sure why there is any hate for this movie. It can be watched like a regular action movie i.e. turn off the brain and see pretty colors. Or you can dive into the story, which in my view is like a hardcore version of the rugrats. Either way great movie, and the music is great, and the cg, and the ladies are also very nice, so that doesn't hurt.
075669812X|5.0|Nice published book, plus the extra green Ninja and the price made a deal. Good item for a gift to the Ninjago lovers.
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|I couldn't wait for the US Version so I had to buy the UK Blu Ray Series 3 and its every bit as exciting as the last two. I'm guessing the US Version will include the upcoming Christmas episode plus some extra bonuses so I guess I am gonna end up buying it but honestly waiting till Feb for the series was way too long lol!
0345803507|3.0|i brought this book because everyone was talking about it ; i don't think i will open it up may sell for more money who knows
B005AERS74|4.0|Better than the previous album but still not the same as the old ones.... it seems they are getting back out there
B009RI4FRU|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie, it has some big names but comes off as an indie style movie. Finally something different from Hollywood.
B0076DCT2G|4.0|The ending was a little anti-climatic. I liked the Paul Brenner connection in the book. Maybe John Sutter can be in the next John Corey book.
0345803493|3.0|i brought this book because everyone was talking about it ; i don't think i will open it up may sell for more money who knows
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|My kids (3 and 8 years old loved it. Its funny and a lot of scences that they still laugh about
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This was a fitting finish to a brilliant trilogy, all of which I enjoyed thoroughly and couldn't put them down, one after the other!
B005LAJ212|5.0|After watching this year's episodes, we decided that we needed to watch season one again. We were surprised at how much we had missed or forgotten from last year. Highly recommend it!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This game is fun for all ages. I like it,my mom likes it,and my friends like it.So as you can see,this is a great game.
B005LVR6ZA|5.0|This was the first book I read by PKD and I was very satisfied.  Lots of things going on - mystery, telepathy, precognition, strange time phenomena, dead people still being able to communicate with the living, wondering what is real, and more.  Mysteries kept emerging the further I got into the story and I kept wondering how long can he keep doing this?  I guess I'll find out if his other stories develop in the same way after I read more of them.  Which I will surely do!  This was a page turner.<br /><br />Since this was written in 1969 and the story takes place in 1992 it's interesting and funny to see the technology that was \\"predicted\\" in the futuristic 1992.  There are some humorous developments.  Just take it in stride and you should be fine.
B001N2WITU|4.0|The movie is extremely funny, but only if you can understand it.  This version is in French with no subtitles, so don't get it if you don't understand French.  The version with English subtitles is call Don't Look Now, We're Being Shot At.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|This is one of those \\"can't put it down\\" books. I started reading yesterday and just finished.  It was an endearing yet gruesome tale that has left me rather queasy, like the seasickness I'm certain Pi regularly experienced.
B008LZHA3G|5.0|In this, his 35th or 36th studio album spanning a career of 50+ years, BD continues to fortify his position at the top of relevant, folk/rock musicians.  Apart from a few short, periodic voids of creativity, his latest albums exhibit talent equal to his previous best.  While some reviewers have recently criticized his aging vocals, since when was Dylan's voice ever considered his most eloquent attribute?  Dylan's voice has always been \\"off,\\" but endearing; a major ingredient of his attraction and success.  More attractive, however, are Dylan's lyrics and musicality.<br /><br />I would grade \\"Tempest\\" as one of Dylan's top ten albums.  Great lyrics, outstanding music, all of which were provided by exceptional back-up musicians in a top-notch recording by Columbia.  If you're a Dylan fan, you need to hear this album!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I first read the series because I heard it was recommended for anyone who liked the Twilight Series I was hooked after the first book I just couldn't put the books down it is a great series. be prepared to not sleep once you start reading you won't be able to stop!
B008XNZMOU|5.0|This is the kind of CD that you keep on in the background when doing things around the house (cooking, cleaning). Even though you buy the CD for the songs you heard on the radio, you wind up liking so many more after they seep into your head when your not paying attention. So far, I have played and replayed almost every one of the songs a hundred times.
B003O86FMW|5.0|A great book written for teenagers but quite enjoyable for adults, as well. The writing is simplistic for an adult audience, but it is a fun read.
B009KHBDUU|3.0|Entertaining but not the blockbuster it should have been with the Star-power available in the movie.  A little too &#34;campy&#34; for my taste.  It 'nonchalants' the killing of innocents and has some gratuitous violence that's not necessary to support the plot line.  I couldn't give it four (4) stars because it does not come across as a cut above average.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I first read the series because I heard it was recommended for anyone who liked the Twilight Series I was hooked after the first book I just couldn't put the books down it is a great series.
B009D5VNLS|5.0|The conflict in the story its not about some outside evil, as much as the conflict we encounter within our own families.  Younger Children may be frightened of the size of the bears.  I do wish they had not made all the men bumbling if lovable idiots.  The illustrators of some of the recent movies have made them unattractive too.  But I like our heroine, I can relate to the Mom as well, and believe people will enjoy it.
B0045XICB2|5.0|It was so easy to to rent this movie via Amazon.  I recently became a Twi-Hard and wanted to catch up.  I rented this and Breaking Dawn - Part I for $.99 each.  The rental was good for two days.  How can you beat that????
B007THA4FI|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed the book.  She builds several parallel story lines that intertwine throughout the book and evenually come together at the climax.  Well written and pleasurable to read.  As always her prose paints vivid mental  images.  Good story even though its based on the mundane lives and happenings of several residents of a small, non-descript village without any &#34;super-stars&#34;.
B001706I5I|5.0|growing up I always watched the animation I wasn't sure I would like a remake since most of the time remakes are horrible but I have to say I loved it! It is actually one of my all time favorite Christmas movies now.
B005LAJ212|5.0|I can't rate this show  because I haven't watched it yet.  It was recommended to me by many friends that think the show is great.  Looking forward to viewing during the long winter months.
B0064SHI9I|2.0|This was purchased for the purpose of backing up a single phone and restoring to an identical replacement (HTC Rezound running Android 4.0).  While all of the steps went smoothly, the result was that it did not backup/restore almost half of my apps and data.  I'm not sure which side of the process failed.  I ended up spending as much time reinstalling the apps from scratch if I hadn't purchased MyBackup Pro.  Not worth even the few bucks.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|His writing style is smooth and palable.  A great painter of scenes.  Not an action thriller;  just good, old-fashioned reading at its best.  Reminds me a little of Pearl S. Buck.....
B003O86FMW|5.0|I first read the series because I heard it was recommended for anyone who liked the Twilight Series I was hooked after the first book I just couldn't put the books down it is a great series.
B009VB7QQA|5.0|if you like vampire movies and a touch of history.  obviously not accurate history, but clever play on actual hx at times.
B004UID2LC|2.0|Nice app... but you must keep amazon app store on your phone to operate it, and the app store app is always runnning you cant keep it stopped.
B009L32R5I|5.0|Great reworks of some of the best Genesis tunes, and some obscure, from his years in the band and not a note out of place. Supper's Ready and The Musical Box are masterfully recreated and just as powerful as the originals. I miss the little Roto Tom play in Eleventh Earl of Mar but there is something different about this version that draws to it, which must be the clear vocalization. Unquiet Slumbers/Quiet Earth/Afterglow, the signature finale of many years come across with a new brilliance.<br /><br />The rest of the pieces are as superb as expected from the master guitarist who painstakingly has created some great solo work, of which there are three of his post-Genesis years production included here, Camino Royale and A Tower Struck Down fit the package well, as they could very well have been part of the Genesis rotation. This album has plenty of great moments and is worth the purchase.
0553579908|5.0|Exactly as described. Very good. Love the book too, it's a great read! The second book of the series - and I'm totally hooked.
B009KHDT0C|3.0|yes worth watching, just not full price .  fell short of its potential. i was a big fan of the original
B001AH6ZWY|5.0|I remember watching this movie when I was 26 and being somewhat let down by the ending. I didn't get it. Fast forward 16 years and my stance has completely changed. This movie is brilliant! It's one of the best movies ever made. It asks so many questions, and observes so many different viewpoints. It can be taken so many different ways. There's simply something in this movie for everyone. I super highly recommend this movie to anyone open minded about the existence of extra-terrestrial life, religion and our origins. I'd say it's one of the top 3 of most important-thought-provoking films of all time. I love it and want more!<br /><br />About the DVD: Not that it really matters but for such a great movie I'm embarrassed that a human with no graphic design skill made the DVD menu. Worst DVD menu I've personally ever seen but don't let that stop you! Own this!
0307591549|5.0|This book is a must-read for college students who tend to withdraw into their rooms or the library.  I wish I had read this before high school.
B00181JGI2|5.0|Another cult classic..... Lost track of how many times I've watched it.<br />I love this movie for the off beat humor and the characters.<br />I laughed so hard I cried. Jeff Bridges, John Goodman and the entire cast<br />were perfect in every scene.<br />Giving this as a gift for Christmas to a friend.
031250926X|5.0|My daughter loves this book, particularly the Slide and Find feature, which allows her to reveal the animals all by herself. It's a great thick board book that holds up well to baby/toddler usage. Beautiful illustrations, and the text has a nice cadence when read aloud.
B0099G3I96|5.0|love these guys. there isnt a song i dont like. fun and upbeat. its like they  were never on a break..
0061091480|5.0|I read this book more than 20 years ago and I'm still grateful to Wayne Dyer for it. It's been a life saver and this is one of those books that I recommend to everybody, a great eye opener. I'm now into quantum physics and how we create our own reality but everything in this book still applies to life, it's a wonderful book.
B00003CXRM|5.0|Fantastic Movie and soundtrack.<br />Excellent gift idea.<br />It's another movie I would watch more than once<br />and the soundtrack stays in my DVD player
B008JMKN4Y|1.0|I had to read this book for a book club. This title was NOT chosen by me. It was a nightmare to get through. Plot is predictable and the storyline is nauseating. Not a book for me. I guess this genre is not my favorite.
B009E3EY38|5.0|I own hundreds of concert dvd's.  I'm one of those that strongly dislikes excessive editing where camera shots change at a dizzying pace.  It can be painfully annoying.  I own some other concert dvd's that are almost impossible to watch, much less enjoyable.  I read the criticisms about how the editing ruined the Celebration concert experience, but bought the blu ray anyway.  The degree to which the cameras changed shots was not bad at all - overall.  In fact, I thought the director actually demonstrated his artistic side in how the concert was shot and edited.  I didn't expect to say such a thing when I heard about there being 16 cameras.  I thought, although using so many cameras, that the concert was more tasteful in its editing than annoying.  There are no doubt rapid edits but the cameras stayed still longer than most concert dvd's that I own.<br /><br />Now to the music.  Incredible performance.  It's not just great considering these guys aren't kids anymore or haven't performed together in decades but great because the performance was absolutely top notch.  I don't know how some people can criticize Robert Plant's voice.  Don't even go there.  He was very, very good.  Plant is a consumate pro.  He came to play and exceeded all expectations.  Plant is one of the most dignified of rock stars - a classy person wise even beyond his years and a great role model to others who aspire to being a front man.  He was wonderful to watch and listen to.<br /><br />Thanks to the entire band for doing this gig.  I know you didn't have to, but I bet it would be an understatement to say that you were all quite glad you did.  You were brave to do what you did.  It took a lot of work and commitment to bring the performance up to the level you did and we should all be grateful for this work of art and your dedication to it.  This was not an easy set list to play.  It's one of my favorite concert dvd's and I'm by no means the biggest Zep fan.  Buy it.
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|Fun game. My kids love it. Wish there were more levels. Excellent for star wars lovers or angry birds fans.
B005SFR7YE|5.0|Never can go wrong with the Phantom.The Phantom of the Opoera at thje Royal Albert Hall was another great performance.
B007EJ6S92|5.0|The price is fine and the presentation is great. It was for a friend and he was really delighted with this =)
B0031Q0XCA|5.0|Very realistic and relatable tale. As they say on the beginning of the movie, this isn't a love story and that's what makes it perfect. There's enough movies out there with Hollywood's bull*shit of happily ever after, we needed this for a change.
B007Q35PLI|5.0|Truthful, useful and entertaining for all ages. All seven of my grandchildren (ages 4-21) watched this with us and no one was offended or frightened by this beautiful story. Temple takes the fear and stigma out of autism; indeed, this is a classical American success story that applies to us all.  Merrill
B009WO7NQO|4.0|Like always these new editions are always fun.  Having  to  purchase  the other levels is lame.<br />Or other worlds, I should say. #lamesauce<br />Still love angry birds though.
B00009TB5G|5.0|I love the movie and this presentation is great! Its price couldn't be better and it look great on the shelf with the other ones =)
B009GEBBNQ|4.0|Avengers was better than I expected.  I had anticipated a pretty normal action movie with lots of action, too much drama & little dialogue.  It had a nice balance of humor, ego, fun & action.  Our family really enjoyed it.
B007BVOEPI|4.0|Good job bringing the story to life . . . I'm reading the book and this goes along with it perfectly!
B008458O3S|4.0|I liked the puzzles. They start easy and get very tough. I like that they share recent solutions. The selectable speed is nice, and the sounds are good.<br /><br />A selectable color scheme would be nice for those who like light backgrounds or are colorblind.<br /><br />And of course, more puzzles would be nice.
B001NCHF3O|3.0|A sister who loves this album suggested it to me. While there are some items I like very much, others are of no interest at all. I probably should have listened to the samples more carefully and bought a few songs instead of the album.
1582701709|5.0|this book has been very helpful when i'm feeling down. i like to read this book when i'm going through rough patches, and it always helps me get back on track.
B001G50QCK|5.0|This is just one of my favorite shows . . . I miss it!  The earlier shows were better, but this season was good too.
0240816250|5.0|I'm only 1/10th of the way through, but I'm learning so many things about developing that one would otherwise get through expensive, frustrating trial and error, that I've already declared this as a must-have/must-read book.  There may be several great ways of doing b+w, but I would feel confident that this is at least as good as any other.  Rarely does a book show so many experiments and side-by-side comparisons that clearly demonstrate how and why the printed statements are justified.  I find the explanations clearly stated with little to no ambiguity, the printing quality good enough to see what is being demonstrated, and objectives meaningful.  Coupled with a book on b+w filtering, such as Ansel Adams' &#34;The Negative&#34;, I see this as enough to get a serious student everything s/he needs to optimize the capture and presentation of whatever creative talent they possess.
B0058BI896|5.0|BBT is the best. Love the cast, they are perfect together. I remember Kaley Cuoco from &#34;Charmed&#34;. Her role was a half white lighter/half witch, and part of the &#34;charmed ones&#34;. My favorite is ,of course , Leonard.
B0058VW36U|5.0|do you like strategy games yes:lemme tell you about it. there's a green cute monster who literraly dreams about candy world end of yes no:how else can I say it? go buy something else.great game overall period point blank
B00961ZESW|5.0|Great songs, great voice - I can't stop with listen! I can't say, which song the best is, there all so great! Listen to the songs!!!!
B0063B2BNE|5.0|always loved watching bones even since i watched it on netflix, but netflix did not have season 7 so i bought it.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|The best show which got messed up at broadcast time. Someone played this gripping series out of order. I do hope the one(s)<br />responsible are not working anymore. Josh Wheaton Rocks. The charactures  are your best friends, you hurt when they do.
B003V5CFV8|4.0|Say what you wan about the sound track but the performances of the three main characters really make the film what it is. Smart and hilarious.
B005LMEB8E|5.0|I wasn't the biggest fan from Demi, but this Album is great! I like it so much and have so much fun when I listen to them!
B007J4T2G8|2.0|There was so much hype over this book and maybe that was the problem...high expectations.  I quickly became bored with the characters.  Very repetitive and unrealistic.  No desire to read the other two in the series.
B003LXSY60|5.0|The Black Keys are a reief for the direction of today's music in that it is innovative and exceptionally creative.  I would purchase their entire collection if only I could play them.  I downloaded 'Brothers' and it went to a cloud thus leaving me unable to locate, share with my smart phone, or transfer and iTunes.  5 bucks down the drain.
B00979CS50|4.0|Good guitar boring rehashed themes and lyrics, but real real good guitar!<br />Oh did I mention real, REAL GOOD GUITAR!
B004QKNXIQ|5.0|I rent this movie as instant video! And I had so much fun, as I watched this movie! It's a great version! Much better than I had expected, watch it! (=
B00110K62U|5.0|I have loved musicals all my life, but \\"Les Miserables\\" is a truly emotional experience for me regardless of how many times I've seen it, in the theatre or on the concert dvd's.  I much prefer this one to the newer version, even with all the technical improvements and bells and whistles added to the 25th anniversary show.  For one thing, Colm Wilkinson is now and forever Valjean for me; Philip Quast is amazing as Javert and Lea Salonga is heartbreaking in the role of Eponine, while her voice is transcendent.  I also don't feel that anyone has ever equaled Frances Ruffelle as Fantine, even after 25 years.  This production is heartfelt and the showing of the barricades on screen adds immeasurably to the effect of the concert itself.  The entire cast is superb.  Don't miss it.
B000I0QK74|5.0|I was so happy to give this CD to my husband for his Thanksgiving gift! He loved it! The process of ordering was easy and it was shipped and delivered on time.
B001IF252M|3.0|I have had several of these, some work, and some don't.  There appears to be a manufacturing problem with these, but I haven't had any problems returning the ones that don't work.  However, you should be aware that the ones that don't work right, might work one time, and not the next.  The problem presents itself when you are trying to get a projector to recognize the computer.  You may have to reboot several times, or it may never work at all.  I would still recommend it, although I hope Apple comes out with a better idea, and wish that they had just used a regular VGA and DVI  rather than requiring an adapter at all.
1451696205|5.0|I love this book. You really live vicariously through Charlie, the main character. This book works on many emotions, from nostalgia to apprehension to comfort. This is a coming of age tale that doesn't involve the usual crap that gets lumped into that category. This isn't Sweet Valley High, it's more along the lines of what lies beneath the surface of suburbia. Appearance is only skin deep and you'd be surprised what you'd find if you'd only bother to look. You should definitely take a look at this book. You can thank me later.
B004I2K4DY|4.0|But still amazing due to the music and the production values.  While Colm Wilkinson will always be THE Jean Valjean for me, I think that Alfie Boe has an astonishing voice and tremendous stage presence.  A few quibbles--while I disagree with whoever said they don't feel that Lea Salonga's voice was powerful enough for the role of Fantine (I thought she was fantastic, as always), I cannot imagine who thought that casting pop star Nick Jonas as Marius was a good idea.  His voice doesn't begin to hold up against the powerhouses around him, which weakens the production sadly--he is simply overshadowed, especially by the actor cast as Enjolras, who blows him away whenever they sing together.  Another weakness--not depicting the battle on the barricades on the overhead screens, which was used to such great effect in the 10th anniversary concert.  And my final quibble--the restaging of the death of Eponine during \\"A Little Fall of Rain\\", which was far more heartwrenching in the 10th anniversary show.  Still, the show stands on its own--nothing can take away from the power of this haunting score; and the finale, featuring the cast members of the original West End production, will bring tears to anyone who loves this musical.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|This was an amazing book for me and me dad to read. The description was as vivid as it could get and the author knows what he is talking about. I can't wait for the jack reacher movie to come out.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|I love this bag. It can be a little hot to carry but I love it. I will be ordering another one soon
B008ZOHCKE|5.0|What can I say??<br /><br />THIS APP + KINDLE FIRE HD WITH AWESOME BATTERY LIFE = TOTAL AWESOMENESS!<br />Well not that I'm exaggerating or something but... To have an electronic notebook is just awesome. No more bags full of separated notebooks for different class. KF HD has 9hrs to 11hrs batt life which is longer than a regular school class which is 6hrs. so you still have 3hrs to review your notes when you arrive home!
B009RI4FRU|5.0|The kids in the movie are great.  It is a little weird but I loved it.  All of the acting is super.
B0043XS7IC|5.0|great album,perhaps my favorite CLUTCH release,bonus live tracks are cool too.what i like most about these guys is they are constantly changing it up.
B005PK56TA|4.0|A little different kind of TV show, horror and drama. If you like dark TV shows you should check this out.
B009XWD02G|1.0|Didnt work at all, app allowed me to pull up artist but every song I clicked on, could not download
B001NHN7TU|4.0|We watched this again after many years.  It is still just as funny!  Kevin Bacon is great.  I love Reba in it too.
B000HKYBXA|5.0|Generally, you can never go wrong with anything that Mr Branagh has his hand in. Be it a role, his writing or directing or all of the above and more.<br />Mr Branagh was the one to get me interested in Shakespeare. Every other attempt, to me, had always been so dark, hard to follow, fairly miserable and bleak. Mainly because I have was born in the 20th century.with a 20th Century mind. He brings the plays up to date in his own special way without losing any of the original intent. His Henry V, for example, is a must. Clear and compelling. And as an Anglo Irish Briton had me all set to pack my bags to take part in the siege of Harfluer.<br />On this version of Hamlet he chose an excellent setting. His own portrayal of the nutjob Prince is superb. The cast is a constant 'oh wow - I never knew he/she was in this!' No, not dropping names as many do not appear in the credits.<br />Above all. The story is now given a new life that can be understood by many more viewers and indeed readers. Get it, enjoy it, then watch again and again.
0307719219|3.0|I could not finish it. What I read was worth 3 stars. I thought it had a decent, if not obvious, premise that inclusive political and economic institutions are what define prosperous nations (as opposed to geography, culture, etc.). Nations fail because a few greedy people get into power and support extractive institutions which benefit them personally. Even though more inclusive institutions would result in higher overall wealth and prosperity for more people, the greedy few cannot risk it - because they care more about their personal wealth which is higher with the status quo. The creative destruction that results from innovation and risk taking threatens the greedy few. The authors use the phase \\"extractive institutions\\" and \\"creative destruction\\" hundreds of times. They go through an exhaustive (and exhausting to read) history of all time and places to support their thesis. I don't know enough history to know how valid their interpretation is, but I think focusing on a few examples in detail would have been a better approach. To me, the failure of nations is caused by greedy, power-hungry people (i.e. a persistent part of human nature throughout history). I found the book repetitive and a tough read. I renewed it once and decided that was enough. I believe I got the authors' point.
0345479092|5.0|It is great to ask have a reference book that feels like your talking to your mum. It is easy to find what you need to know and nice to know that most of the things youare doing is right.
B009YU6FJM|5.0|might be their best album yet.  if you liked diamond eyes you'll love this.  can't wait until they come back out on tour.
B002N7CTKM|5.0|Wish single episodes were cheaper, but it's nice to have.  Great show!  This is a very funny episode.  A favorite!
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|Season Two MUCH better than Season One.  For those watching 1st season; be patient - better CONTINUING plots in the 2nd.
034580404X|5.0|Books came in excellent condition. Books itself were a great read & it was even better that the books came in such great condition!
B000BI0WOA|3.0|The CD is a knockoff.  It was down loaded and burnt onto a cheap disk.  If I wanted to cheat the artist I could have down loaded the music.  I will not purchase music CD's from Amazon in the future.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|my friend recamedid this game to me so I got it. . Now I'm addicted to this game and don't ever want to stop. best game in the holl game store.
B002PEP4SC|5.0|I watch the tv show Castle and this book is just like the show. Loved it and will be reading the rest of the series.
B00A1XOPE8|5.0|I found the reading of this novella to be no strain to the brain, but a delightful story very well told.  Yet once I had finished reading, my brain kept right on thinking about the complexities involved in this simple narrative and its wonderful &#34;magic&#34; system.  I found the main character very compelling and I would like to find out more about her -  perhaps in a future novel.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|He plays it all the time and he is 6 and does it great.  It is well worth getting it.
B00A77II0U|4.0|the game is definitely worth the money. highly recommend.  I loved the helping doll and was sad at the end. definitely worth playing over again and again
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|Wonderful animation and acting. While a great cartoon experience, it was also a touching movie about growth.  Loved it.  I would see it again.
B0000AQZYM|5.0|Finding Nemo [VHS] Wanted to see this again and got if for a good price.  No problems with video or service.
B0012HRJEA|2.0|This is probably a VERY good movie. To take the classic story in drop it in modern-day Verona, with the Shakespearian dialogue intact is sheer genius. But I had difficulty understanding much of the words. Sorry Amazon, I'm an extremely literal person and if I don't know what they're saying I get confused. To top it off, many of the words have archaic meaning and if I don't see them written I have no idea what they are. The only &#34;fix&#34; for me would be to follow along with a script. But I watch movies to be entertained. Don't want to have to study them at the same time.<br />I URGE AMAZON TO USE THE CLOSED CAPTIONING WHICH IS ALREADY PRESENT ON THE MOVIE TRACK.
B000HEWEJO|5.0|it is the good old favoriteof mine, watch it every thanksgiving to put me in the christmas mood. must have
B00978V35C|5.0|Robert Cray presents great songs on this album, and his vocals and guitar work perfectly.<br />If you're a fan of his you will not be disappointed.
B009YU62H2|5.0|Love it! Recommend to anyone that loves the classic screams and riffs we fell in love with. Get it when you can!
B0086213XW|4.0|The subject matter is nothing new, but I liked the way it was handled in this movie.  There's no question that this is Michelle Williams' film; she plays Margot, a 28-year-old woman married for 5 years who has no idea how a 28-year-old woman married for 5 years is supposed to feel or act.  Seth Rogen does a decent job portraying Margot's husband, Lou, but despite his hefty amount of screen time, we never learn much about what makes Lou tick.  All of the other characters seem to exist for the purpose of fleshing out Margot, while remaining pretty bare bones themselves (through no fault of anyone's acting abilities).  This does make the film awkward and uneven at times, but it also keeps it from becoming cliche by turning the movie into more of a character study than a story about a relationship in trouble: Is it the relationship that's problematic, or is it Margot's expectations of the relationship?  Stylistically, the movie is lovely.  The scenes between Margot and her handsome neighbor and would-be lover, Daniel, are mostly overwritten in the beginning for the purposes of exposition, but the film picks up a nice pace later on.  Michelle Williams' acting is so good that that alone gets the film to 3 stars.  There are plenty of other reviews that go into detail about this film's flaws, but I think that Williams' performance combined with the film's honesty and original portrayal of the subject matter outweigh those flaws and make it worth a watch.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|Best movie I've seen in a long, long time! Ensemble cast that couldn't be better. Wonderful Brit stars that aren't!
B00932AA5G|4.0|Kept wondering who's going to be the lead when remade in English. Any of our leading men want to play their real height, 5'6\\". Brutish and nasty and twisty. Good enough to pass the time.
B008YI91HS|5.0|Download worked great. Glad to have this movie in my library (and not bundled up with the other two, like iTunes forces you to do).
B0098VYCCE|4.0|I thought it was a pretty good movie.  Enjoyed the special effects and the actors seemed to be in their role and made the movie fun to watch.
B009K0P10K|5.0|You must watch from the first  season. You will be hooked. I can't put it down or wait for the next available episode.
B006ISJQ26|3.0|Great start. And then they changed the original in major ways. Some great bad guys. Strong and gritty performances. Colin's character is a gem. If only they stayed with the story.
B009HQ9UHC|4.0|This game is lots of fun, even (or maybe especially) when you don't build your &#34;contraptions&#34; correctly. Can be a bit frustrating at times trying to figure it out but lots of laughs watching the &#34;failures&#34;.

B009HV2JT8|2.0|My husband read the book and really wanted to see this. Glad we got it during Amazon's weekend sale because it wasn't that great. They tried to make every action scene look like the Matrix and the story was just so-so. Wouldn't recommend this.
B001GCUO5W|4.0|I'm sorely tempted to spoil this film, but I won't. I'll limit myself to three brief remarks.<br /><br />>> If I said \\"Shutter Island\\" was a suspense story with a twist ending, it would be completely true -- and completely false.<br /><br />>> Those familiar with classic films will have no trouble figuring out what's happening 15 minutes on.<br /><br />>> Note Scorese's references to \\"Vertigo\\" and \\"Psycho\\" (and possibly other films I missed).<br /><br />If you want to be surprised, don't read too many reviews. Including this one.
B008WCP2KG|5.0|Absolutely love it!!!!!  Great purchase!!!  Great value!!!  Will be watching this one over and over again and again!!!  Would be a great Christmas gift too!!!
B00785P2QC|5.0|I enjoy the challenging any creative fun. it keeps my mind busy the entire time I play. it has become. addictive.
B009S8PEHY|5.0|I enjoy Christmas songs and Rod Stewart. I have another<br />album of Rod Stewart's Oldies and I listen to it a lot.
B009CPJHY4|4.0|Normal fare for a movie like this. All happy endings for everyone...but then again, so what! Enough tragedy in life without having to dose yourself with it in a movie also. Just a nice pleasant bit of easy viewing. And a great cast too! Love Bill Nighy!
B00A12VW86|3.0|Its OK. Not as good as uno but still better than a lot of music out there. Not great though.
0345536886|3.0|I really don't think that this was one of Grisham's best.  The story line was really very simplistic and it was definitely not a page turner like some of his former books that I have read.

B009ZTLPJM|4.0|I'm not going to spend a lot of time dissecting this album. Others have certainly done a more thorough job than I ever could.<br /><br />As a Soundgarden fan since the days of Ultramega OK, I was thrilled to hear they were releasing a new album. I really tried to temper my excitement and expectations for this album. Since their last album was probably my least favorite, and it had been so many years since they band worked together, I tried to be realistic about how much I was going to like the album.<br /><br />I wasn't disappointed with the album, and in-fact, I like it quite a bit. Ultimately, it's not exactly what I was hoping for, but I think it's a very good album. I like the somewhat varied music they explore while still maintain a distinct Soundgarden sound. I do feel like Chris Cornell's vocals sound very, very similar on most of the tracks. Obviously, it's always going to sound like him, but I felt it was hard to distinguish his vocals from track-to-track much of the time.<br /><br />I'm really glad to have this album to add to the Soundgarden collection, even if it didn't fully satisfy me as a long-time fan.
B0055SWM08|5.0|I admit it, I'm not a huge fan of video games.  Quell however has changed my mind about using my free time playing a video game.  The object of the game is to move your sphere around various mazes and pick up the pearls.  It remembers where I am every time I turn my Kindle back on.  I find this game endlessly relaxing and addictive.  I am wondering though why sometimes I have music and sometimes I do not.  The best .99 cents I've ever spent.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I love the show, I hope it's the longest running series ever!! I try to get everyone I know to watch it.
037571457X|4.0|Persepolis is the autobiographical account of a young girl growing up in Iran during the fall of the last shah and the following war with Iraq.<br /><br />What struck me the most about this book was it could have easily been my daughter's story in the U.S.<br /><br />From the takeover of the government by religious fanatics, to the culture war that ensued.  This is something that could very easily happen in the United States today.<br /><br />I think that this strikes me so much because we Americans think that we just can not understand the way that people of another culture think.  Persepolis shows us that a little girl growing in early 1980's Iran isn't so different from my 6 year old daughter today.  Obsessed with pop stars (Michael Jackson in Marji's case), dressing stylish, and playing games.<br /><br />This book should be required reading in high school english classes in America.  It teaches us that the differences between us and other cultures really aren't all that different.  It also shows us that powerful stories can be told in a form other than prose.<br /><br />I only gave it 4 stars because, at times, the narrative gets a little hard to follow.  But I think that is because these are the author's memories of events that happened when she was 6 years old.
B007WCJSWA|5.0|Hesitated at first in purchasing this after reading the poor review in Downbeat, but recently got it as a longtime fan of Stern's.  It ranks as one of his best, a great constellation of songs, musicians, and performances by Stern.  He continues to evolve and demonstrates his amazing breadth and masterful playing. Disregard the bogus Downbeat review!
0375714839|3.0|This graphic novel is very engaging and quite the page turner -- I picked it up on a friend's recommendation when I wanted to be reading something but was already inundated with heavy reading assignments at school, so I jumped at the chance to read something informative and yet not dense.  And it's good fun.  However, because of the highly Westernized nature of the author and her family I felt like Satrapi was writing this story as a Westerner and not as an Iranian. (Yeah, I know.  She mentions \\"we Iranians\\" a lot, and I won't deny Satrapi her cultural heritage.  But it's obvious that her family is not like the majority of Iranian families. Their ideals and tastes are very much influenced by Western models.) One example of this is early in the book when she and other girls/women protest the head scarf.  Some form of head covering is prevalent in most of the Islamic world, and it is not necessarily \\"forced\\" on women as many in the West believe.  So while I understand resistance to force in the case of the Iranian government's mandate, there was a bit of cognitive dissonance as I read Satrapi's description of her relationship with the head scarf -- as if it were this strange, evil thing she had no cultural connection to.  There were other times I felt that I was reading a take on growing up in Iran written by a Westerner - particularly from the midway point on.<br />  Anyway, like I said it's a fun read and I'd be lying if I said I didn't learn quite a bit from it as well.  But I do sort of worry about the effect it would have on someone who knows next to nothing about Islam or Iran.  Being that the story is told from someone who is Westernized in many ways, it could just reaffirm many of the misconceptions we have about Islam as a whole.  At the same time, their tastes do not make Satrapi's family any less Iranian, in the same way that liking Indian music and food doesn't make me less American.  But as one of the few insights into the Iranian experience that has beenwidely read around the world, I view it as kind of unfortunate that Persepolis is told from such a, well, narrow perspective.  (Then again, it would be great if people liked it enough to seek out similar books and broaden their perspective on the Iranian Revolution, Islam, etc.)  So yeah, pretty ambivalent here.  If you feel like you can bring in enough background knowledge to balance out the author's particular viewpoint and not take it in as unquestioned \\"truth\\", go for it.  If you don't know much about Islam just be sure you take some of the author's value-laden claims with a grain of salt.  In other words, I think Persepolis is great if read as a memoir, and potentially misleading if read as a guide to Iranian culture.
B007SGM084|5.0|Loved these books. They were fun to read. Little on the x rated side but loved the story. Good love story
B0092MKFIY|5.0|I have listened to this album twice, and I'm lovin it! The first track is my favorite, but the others are catchy and varied. The album seems to go between harder rock and instrumental groove. Usually I only buy singles, but this band is an exception. Every song is great in its own way.
B0098VYCCE|4.0|I thought that this was an imaginative re-imagining of a common fairy tale.  I did not capture me so much as to be among the best movies I have seen, but neither did I feel that the movie lost relevance and I was waiting for it to end.  It won't end up in the library of films I own, but I would watch it again.
B008IJTFYW|4.0|love how you can match up differnt sound effects with Relax Melodies.  Had a lot of fun playing around with the app.
B0055D3EFU|4.0|This low budget horror film is Exorcist scary from the start to finish of the movie.  Loads of surprises.  Very creepy cinema.
0679735909|5.0|I am just absolutely floored by the amount of research and writing that went into making this book. To &#34;make up&#34; poems, and articles, and letters, and excerpts of biographies that all fit together to make a believable tale like this, is no small feat. I was glued to the pages for days until I finally finished at 2am one morning. I can't wait to read another of A.S. Byatt's novels.
B004Z7AHZC|5.0|my daughter read the book first and loved it. this movie really broguht characters to life. I havent seen the movie myself but daughter loved it, played perfectly and came in great condition.
B0064T6LV8|4.0|This is a fun (& somewhat addictive) game to play...esp. the larger ocean-themed version. Also enjoy the sound effects. Recommend it highly.
1439102813|5.0|I bought this book as a gift for my wife.  We recently lost her mother who had alzhemers.  My wife read a review of this book and was interested in reading it.<br /><br />She was very impressed with it.  She liked that it was written from Alice's point of view.<br /><br />I intend to read it as soon as the other people in the family who she has promised it to have finished.
B008G12ERC|4.0|Let's be honest. I bought this album for the single &#34;Madness&#34; and hoped that the rest would be similar enough to fall in love with. Instead, I skip through Track 1, 3 (which I hate), 7, and 9. I ended up loving &#34;Follow Me&#34;, and the last 2 vocals &#34;Save Me&#34; and &#34;Liquid State&#34;. The very last 2 songs on the album are pretty cool...synthetic beats with random talking which somehow works. So I love enough songs on this album to give it 4 stars, but I'm wishing for more of the &#34;old&#34; Muse.
B000ID3KU6|1.0|I purchased this movie by mistake because I failed to recognize it. I had watched the beginning before, but soon abandoned it. I thoroughly dislike Italian westerns made in Spain, especially by Sergio Leone. Spain is not the American west, which is an interest in itself. The trains are European design and are badly phonied-up in a paltry attempt to make them look like 19th century American ttrains, as though no one would notice. Any substantrial buildings are nothing like what would be found in the U.S.A. Those westerns fall short because they fall apart.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I was captivated from the first chapter.  Really kept me guessing as to how this story would turn out.  Well done!
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|Worth the rent. The CGI and the story in Brave is very well done. I would highly recommend this for adults or children.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|This is very easy to find the scripture I need and I especially like that it is the red lettered edition.
B008CLI3TE|1.0|While I have after several viewings managed to \\"get into\\" Game of Thrones, I can't help enjoying it with reservations because:<br /><br />1) I'm not a fantasy aficionado and don't have quite the appreciation of \\"world-building\\" which the more seasoned fantasy enthusiasts seem to applaud. This is why I had to stop after a certain point when reading Tolkien. I finished the Hobbit, the Lord of the Rings, and Silmarillion. Halfway through Unfinished Tales I just thought--and feel free to laugh--\\"who cares\\"? It had stopped being a story and become, to me, a sort of desperate escapist history which couldn't have ended until Tolkien died, and clearly not even then. (Perhaps I am being unkind to Tolkien since a lot of his Middle Earth lore was published posthumously anyway. Perhaps he never intended to publish any of it and it's his fans who can't let go.) And though Game of Thrones is, so far, the only addition to my viewing diet that is of the Dungeons & Dragons sort, and in spite of the show's creators' best efforts to foreground the drama rather than the fantasy, I here and there find myself blushing over some quite awful writing of the \\"you can, you must\\" or \\"I can, and I will\\" variety (as if they'd never read Shakespeare, or read him and resisted him), as well as over the rather far-fetched proper names of peoples/places which sound like they were wrenched from the board-game/trading-card imaginations of unbecoming nerds. In other words, Game of Thrones too often feels like the product of a sad loser made for sad losers. (And even then, sad losers are the products of bad parents, bad education systems, income disparity, structural inequality, etc. So they can hardly be blamed.)<br /><br />2) Despite my reservations I know Game of Thrones could have been far worse: it could have been more like the books on which it was based. Granted, I have never read any of the books, but I spent days systematically reading every 1-,2-,and 3-star review for them on this website. Okay, a bit of an overstatement since I did this almost a year ago and more reviews were undoubtedly added since then. Even so, there were quite enough reviews a year ago for me to decide that I would NEVER read the books. This was due to my impression that:<br /><br />a) the fantasy element in the books is present to an extent which I would find unbearable. The author's tendency to overload the narrative with unnecessary detail and history of his fantasy world was a serious complaint among the reviewers: the word \\"editor\\" was mentioned a lot, often in conjunction with \\"where was the,\\" and more often in conjunction with \\"where the ---- was the.\\"<br /><br />b) in spite of a 700 to 1000-page minimum per book, and in spite of the publication of 5 books over 16 years (1996-present) the story is still not finished. But not only is the story not finished: the other serious complaint is that the plot is headed absolutely nowhere. (Hint: The author was a writer for TV serials in Hollywood in the '80s. Were the expectations high to begin with?)<br /><br />I'm unqualified to speculate what fate awaits the books, except to say I feel sorry for those fans who spent so much time reading them only to become increasingly frustrated by what seems no more than a marketing ploy designed to keep stringing them along. (It takes 10 hours to finish the first season of Game of Thrones. How many hours did it take to slog through Game of Thrones the novel, let alone the whole series thus far? Again, they have my profound sympathy.) What doom this spells for the TV series is harder to say. Presumably the show's existence hinges on the books' existence, although perhaps not necessarily so: I vaguely remember watching an interview in which the author stated that he had divulged certain plot points to the show's creators in the event that he was hit by a bus (no comment) before bringing the book series to its conclusion. Then again, HBO often cancels its series before their completion, and sometimes for quite inexplicable reasons. (In the instance of Rome the reason was reportedly a financial one. Fine. In the instance of Deadwood it was never clear if the reason was to do with money or ratings. Then they cancelled John from Cincinnati for its mere 3-million viewership. Huh?) At the moment, however, Game of Thrones has nothing to fear: consumer interest is apparently strong enough for HBO to have ordered a third and fourth season (that's 2 years) to cover the third novel Storm of Swords. And who knows how the two novels after that will be divided. It's certainly enough time for the author to decide if he's going to keep scribbling in the margins or give his poor readers their due.

The calendar and the box are in excellent condition and I know the person I'm giving it to will enjoy it all year long.

B002EBDP9G|5.0|If you are not a person that ever had a real interest in history in your youth, but you feel that you would like to enlighten yourself with some fascinating information to keep your mind sharp when the grandchildren come around. Or maybe you just want to read a well written piece of nonfiction. If so, this is that book.  I've read it twice and love to relaunch myself into the eras of colonization through the reconstruction and so forth.  The author does a wonderful job at keeping the reader well informed and interested.<br />I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to further enrich their mind.

0547884591|5.0|For those of you counting previous product reviews as somehow a sign of the authenticity of my comments, please note: I'm a very busy guy and very rarely if ever bother to waste my time offering public opinion on the crap I buy to enlighten the masses. I just bought a $1200.00 Nikon from Amazon and there are LOADS of things I could have said about the item and about my buying experience, but frankly, who gives a damn? Every photographer knows Nikon. My opinion means nothing in that universe. Even though I had a lot I wanted to say; I refrained from wasting my time.<br /><br />This is different. I had downloaded samples of Tim's previous books, 4-HWW and 4-HB. The gems and nuggets of unique and valuable information in those books sold me on actually spending real cash money to try 4-HC. That and a few of Tim's promo materials plus a hefty discount from Amazon pushed my buying buttons.<br /><br />So the pkg arrives while I'm not home. It's waiting on my doorstep. \\"Damn!\\" I say to myself. \\"Amazon overkill on the packaging, as usual. Why the hell do they have to use such a big box for such a small book?\\" I bend down to pick it up, \\"Holy crap! Why is it so heavy? Ha ha, maybe the warehouse screwed up and put 2 or three copies in the box! My Bonus! Damn, I hope it wasn't my fault...hope I'm not the one who screwed up when I placed the order! Or maybe this isn't the book I'm expecting, maybe it's just something else!\\"<br /><br />Frankly, I was expecting a small, lightweight, easy, one-night '4-Hour Read' with maybe 120 small pages.<br /><br />So I open the box and, as a bibliophile, I must say I was--and still am--thoroughly impressed. Amazed! Over 650 big, beautiful, high-quality, superbly-designed pages; lavishly illustrated and brilliantly organized. The cover and dust-jacket, also indicate a 'no expense barred\\" production value. They don't make books like this anymore. Not for $36 at least!<br /><br />So I read the jacket covers. I flipped through the pages. I checkedout some of the page heads, chapter heads, photos and illustrations.<br /><br />I immediately went back to my computer, logged onto Amazon and ordered another copy for my grown son. I had it gift wrapped for less than $3. It will arrive the day before his birthday next week. I had no idea what to get him until I held this book in my hands, and flipped through the pages again, I instantly knew he will love it. I'm so glad I was able to do this. I know my son and I are both going to enjoy reading this book. Honestly, I can think of lots of other people who I would love to give this book to. It's an unusually high-quality product at a great price with broad appeal.<br /><br />Thanks to you Tim, for putting all of this together in such an elegant and interesting way. I can't wait to dig further into it!

B00571F26Y|5.0|I have tried many diets all high in products filled with Heathy grain(?????) and was so frustrated with continuous weight gaain and discomfort on these diets. I just started to put this diet to work and can tell the difference in my body function. I believe I also will see a change in weight as i pursue this diet. Freinds and family have tried it, lost weight and reversed some issues with arthritis, diabetes, Blood pressure and kidneys. It takes effort to read packages in stores and learn to substitute the right products and learn to cook different but worth the effort. Thank you Dr Davis for your boldness to speak the truth. I also spoke privately to two local farmers who are retired and furious with the farmers for continuing to produce this wheat even while their own family and friends die from complications of wheat in their diets. I encourage you to get this book and read this information so you can make a wise decision about your personal well being and health.
B0068LYEHA|5.0|Caitlin Moran is so likable. She's funny, she's smart, and she doesn't degrade her reader. I have to say that I liked the second half of the book better than the first - mainly because I just felt like I couldn't relate to some of her tales of puberty (although her tone still makes it an interesting read). But when she starts talking about navigating the office and dating, I started liking it more. To me, where she really makes this book exceptional is when she discusses why you should or shouldn't have children and how she feels about abortion. It just felt so real and honest and I wish she could have talked about that more. Overall, it was a great book.

0738711500|5.0|I have always loved Tarot cards and have collected many decks over the years.  I was never really able to find a deck that &#34;worked&#34; for me.  I thought I just did not have the knack to learn.  This deck (and book) totally changed my mind.  By following the author's directions carefully I was able to understand each card and memorized them by the end of that day.  Her method is foolproof and very effective.  I am SO glad that I purchased this set, it really is remarkable.  Even if you were to end up using a different deck and some point this set offers a framework that will definitely help you to &#34;learn&#34; Tarot.

B008AK8FHM|2.0|I found it near impossible to get through the first several chapters.  I know that he had to prove to an unbelieving world that he was no nut case, but honestly it got old.  It is not like this is the first book on this subject.  I, like I am sure many others would like to know what happened to make him believe the existence of heaven.  Most of the book was filled with esoteric hard to imagine wanderings of his mind.  I got half way through it and put it down because it was such a tedious read.  I will start at the end when I pick it up again, to try to glean something from his story.  I do know that there are very perfect families, with all members super successful and I learned of one  in this book, man even this guys real family were super high achievers, amazing..  It looked like it was written to speak to those he thinks to be higher evolved members of the society he belongs to, not to the masses, who, would probably  be the ones to believe it and benefit from its message more.  Especially those who have recent losses.  But then, maybe his target audience needs it more.  Then again his statements that it doesn't matter how bad or evil you are you still go to heaven, makes you wonder, why try to be a good, honest decent person?

0316228532|4.0|I actually really liked Casual Vacancy, though I can see why others don't. Yes, it does have some sexual content and swear words, but I feel like those aren't too important when considering the book as a whole. I think the main difference between this book and the Harry Potter books (if you were to compare them) is that the HP books were more for entertainment... Casual Vacancy has a larger, more significant message - or two. I wouldn't recommend it as an entertaining read though. Find something else if you're in that mood.<br /><br />I love the way that Rowling lays out the story. It is a little confusing when you first start reading it, getting to know all the characters and their separate stories. However, as you continue to read, their personalities, personal stories, and complex interactions start to make a lot of sense. The way that she wrote it makes me feel as though I, the reader, had just moved to Pagford and had to slowly and gradually meet everyone and understand the political dynamics and socioeconomic conditions... this process takes some time though. It's kind of like a curtain slowly pulling back to show you the larger picture. The characters were very well developed - that is one of Rowling's strengths. I can relate to many of them - I caught myself thinking \\"hey, I know someone jusssst like that\\" for several of the characters. The way that the book is structured with all the characters/families' separate lives coming together as the book progresses reminds me a little of James Joyce's The Dubliners. Casual Vacancy is really just a combination of short stories that flow together with similar characters. If you only read half the book or stop one third of the way through, you will miss out on this effect.<br /><br />I think there were several key messages that Rowling wanted to get across to her readers, and they can be applied in many situations, times, and places. One message that hit me in particular was the rippling and cyclical effect that an individual's behavior has on many different people. If one person is nasty to another, the effects of that interaction do not just stop at the next person - they usually radiate to other people in some form or another. Therefore, if one person commits a crime or does something \\"bad\\" based on this rippling effect of nastiness from someone else... who is to blame? Can blame or fault really only be attributed to just one person or should more people be held accountable? This was a major theme in the book, as you watch how the characters interact with each other. It's also interesting to see which costly, bad habits are considered socially acceptable and which are not tolerated. If a person is fat and gorges on food without self control, this is viewed as better than someone who abuses drugs, even though they are both based on addictive behaviors and cost the health care system money.<br /><br />Another take away message is to really consider people who society thinks are useless - drug users, the poor, prisoners, etc. The book really makes you think about how they ended up in that situation - where does the blame lie? It also challenges common stereotypes associated with this group of people - lazy bums, messy slobs, drug abusers, pregnant teenagers. Sure, some people might be described as that... but not the entire group of low income people. The book shows that they can be very useful members of society if someone believes in them and gives them a chance - this is what Barry represented. His behavior had a positive effect on those people who it reached, even though it might have come at a cost to his family. If there were more Barrys in the world who reached out to others to encourage, help and inspire them, it might be a better place to live... I think Barry is the idealized character in this story - it is who the average person wants to be.<br /><br />I would say you should definitely give it a chance, regardless of the other poor reviews here. It made me think quitea bit after reading it. I'm actually tempted to re-read it to see what I might've missed the first time through. I think one of the main reasons why people dislike it, is it can make you feel a little uncomfortable about yourself.

0824835921|5.0|[I'm reposting this review from the previous version, as it keeps being republished for good reason. The review still applies.]<br /><br />I've been using Heisig's book for about 7 weeks, and have \\"learned\\" 310 kanji during that time. I wanted to share some of my experiences and thoughts to add to the other thoughtful reviews.<br /><br />First, by way of background, I experienced the \\"traditional\\" method of learning kanji when I studied Chinese a number of years ago. As Heisig notes in his introduction, that method involves learning characters in order according to how fundamental they are in language, and one learns the written character, pronunciation, grammatical details, and so forth simultaneously. The characters are learned purely by rote, and the pictorial aspects are not tied to anything systematic. My experience agreed with Heisig's notes: with nothing to anchor one's memory, it is nearly impossible to remember how to write the characters. I spent many hours a day practicing the characters to little avail and much frustration, and ultimately abandoned learning Chinese because I could not find the time to persist in that method.<br /><br />When I decided to learn Japanese, the fear of chinese characters returned. How could I learn kanji when Chinese characters were an insurmountable obstacle in the past? Luckily, Heisig's book has been part of the answer. The key is that, instead of merely learning random markings, he lays out a system in which one uses imaginative associations. And, yes, it really works (at least for me). It is not difficult to \\"learn\\" 20-30 kanji per day, given an available hour or two of time.<br /><br />Now, a few things have to be said. First, in his system, to \\"learn\\" a kanji means simply to learn two things: (1) how to write it; (2) a single key meaning. There are many other things that one does not learn (in volume 1 of his system): (3) pronunciation (that's in volume 2); (4) alternative meanings, which are multiple for most kanji; (5) compounds with other kanji; (6) anything about usage or grammar. That is by design, as Heisig notes that learning to write the kanji is the most important barrier for westerners. He specifically designed the system to lower that hurdle as low as it can be, and that meant that the other aspects of kanji are postponed.<br /><br />The value of this system depends on one's goals, schedule, and related activity. First, Heisig notes that his system should be completely separated from any other simultaneous activity to learn kanji. It is NOT intended to be a supplement to a second or third year Japanese course, for instance. Further, it is not designed to progress from common to less-common, like many kanji books. Rather, it bunches kanji together solely on the basis of how easy they are to learn together. This implies that the course must be completed -- or very nearly completed -- to get most of the benefit. That implies a certain schedule, namely, to persist until one is done.<br /><br />In terms of goals, the system works well for some goals: (a) learning to write the basic kanji in a short amount of time, so one can devote study to grammar and other matters; (b) rapidly developing an extremely rudimentary reading ability, where \\"reading\\" means \\"occasionally figuring out a few words, but mostly just being able to have some visual memory for kanji when confronted by them\\"; (c) laying a foundation for other study of Japanese when one has an enforced break of at least a few months; (d) learning the kanji because they're fun, as a supplement to kana-based Japanese classes (i.e., prior to starting kanji formally); (e) breaking the language down into parts that are more suitable for self-study. Those are my goals, and I suspect the goals of many other adult western learners of Japanese.<br /><br />There are other goals that I believe are not well-suited to this system: (f) supplementing an intermediate or advanced Japanese language course where you're learning kanji otherwise (Heisig's book could, however, fill in a break in such instruction); (g) rapidly developing basic reading fluency, i.e., in relation to word frrequency or importance; (h) serving as a text for classroom; (i) reviewing or learning grammar.<br /><br />One thing that I would highly recommend: get the flash cards in addition to this book. Yes, it is possible to make your own, but as other reviewers have noted, that is an unpleasant exercise. In addition, it is error-prone: if you don't know how to write the kanji well, the flash cards are likely to drill poor representations of the kanji. I would also note that Heisig's cards have other valuable information. First, they have cross-references to some common kanji dictionaries for westerners, so it is easy to look up a kanji in those when the key word meaning or stroke order is unclear. Second, they have pronunciation information to complement volume 2 of his system.<br /><br />Finally, it should be obvious but I'll state it anyway: no book can do the hard work of learning a language for you. Heisig's system has given me what I needed to get over the very high hurdle of learning to write kanji, but it still takes a great deal of patience every day. You have to sit down and practice and review the flash cards, and his book, over and over. For me, it requires at least a few hours per week, in 30 minute pieces here and there -- but mostly it requires patience and diligence. Good luck!

B007SS3VUS|5.0|Graceland is one of those rare albums that has aged wonderfully. Almost 30 years on from its original release, it is still capable of surprising and delighting the listener.<br /><br />It's even hard to recommend one track or another - Under African Skies is probably my favourite, but for my money there's not a duff song on the album. There are quieter, more contemplative tracks, and loud dancey ones, and as well as just being a very enjoyable album it's also a slice of South African music, the album which introduced groups like Ladysmith Black Mambazo to the world.<br /><br />With 6 bonus tracks this is already pulling its weight. The DVD copy of the accompanying documentary adds even more Gracelandy goodness, and gives an insight into the controversy and uncertainty that surrounded the original release. Along with the documentary itself, which is an engrossing watch, there are extended interviews with several of the people featured, and to top it off there are three music videos and a wonderful film of Simon and LBM appearing on Saturday Night Live.<br /><br />Thoroughly enjoyable and great value.
B0094KF4WG|5.0|I wasn't sure wether I really wanted to read this as I thought the book might be full of bravado. I came away very impressed with how well written the book was and just how exceptional and humble these individuals are. They will continue to make significant contributions to the country long after they have left the military.
B005XN31LY|4.0|I watch this show specifically for Robert Carlyle, who has the most difficult and multi-layered character.  The rest of the show is okay.
B005WUHAX8|2.0|The case was nearly impossible to put on, first of all. Then once on It was very hard to use the volume buttons. Also, the sound coming out of the speakers was muffled and rattled. And last but not least, it effected my call reception and I started dropping calls.
B005LAIHZE|5.0|I received the novel as a birthday present, and was skeptical, when first I checked out the title.  I read it, though, and was absolutely shocked at how good it was!  It was in no way disrespectful of our beloved 16th President, and it stayed true to history, as far as Abe's history is known, and I enjoyed every page of it.  Consequently, when I learned that a movie had been made of the novel, I was immediately interested.  I pre-ordered it, from Amazon, and waited.  When finally it was released, I couldn't wait to see it.  Well, the movie did not disappoint!!!  One added thing; my wife really liked it, too, and she's very hard to please.  I would unhesitatingly recommend this book to everyone.  The CGI is great, and the action is non-stop.  Plus, Rufus Sewell is a great bad guy.  'Nuf said!  Buy this movie!!!
B009OYTAL8|5.0|This is a very fun series.  I missed the pilot so I bought it to make sure I understood the complete back story.  It was worth it and HD on my Kindle was fantastic.
B002O385GC|4.0|I didn't think I would like this movie, but I do. It is really very funny and entertaining. Something both my husband and I can watch together.
B005CRQ2DK|5.0|The Diary of a Wimpy Kid series is a witty book about growing up. Greg Heffley is a stumbling,really bad excuse for a boy,but an unlikely hero. I especially like this one because of the amount of trouble Greg gets himself into. Nevertheless this is a great book for tweens.
B006S08RLU|5.0|This movie was very very good! A little bit dragged out at first, but well worth the wait! Not too appropriate for those younger than say 13, but it quaintly captures the essence of France and human nature! Wonderful <3
B009WO7NQO|5.0|Very fun to play. Love the Star Wars Angry Birds.? Grandkids love to play this game too. Hope they add more levels soon.
B009715NUK|4.0|This set has probably one of the best Pet Shop Boys b-sides of all time with \\"In His Imagination\\". The song should have been released on Elysium but if you haven't heard it you need to. It is such an amazing song. I would put it up there with some of the best they have ever done. I have been a long time fan and have just about every cd but I would seriously recommend getting this single even if just for that song.
B009KHBDUU|2.0|We really thought this movie would be funny, and were sadly disappointed.  It drags on and on...  And we barely laughed during the movie.  Glad we just rented it because it would have been a waste of money if we bought it.
B007THA4FI|1.0|I honestly thought that anything that J.K. Rowling wrote would have to be great, after the Harry Potter series.  Boy, was I wrong!  I would love to have my money refunded for this book.  I kept waiting for the good stuff.  It never happened.  All I got was a headache.  This is like the longest, most disappointing bad soap opera ever!  What a waste of talent to put this kind of trash into a novel.  I'll probably never read another of her books.
B005PK553C|5.0|Connie Britton and Dylan McDermott are awesome in this. Really good acting and good story line. Could not recommend more.
B004HW7JHE|5.0|This is the best MAD MEN Season so far. But, as always: Great Acting, great characters, fantastic storylines.<br />Can't wait for the early Seventies and how things will go on with all the changes in a whole new decade.<br />Bring us Season 6 !!!
B009VB998I|4.0|It was a cute movie.  We watched it on our family movie night.  My children found it enjoyable and they are 7 an 18 months.
B008OOYALE|4.0|this game is great but a bit slow going at the beginning but don't give up. It picks up eventually:-)
B00932A6G4|1.0|Was very disappointed. Nowhere in your description of this film did you mention that it was animated and not real. I am not a fan of animated films. I felt like I was misled into renting this film. Amazon should do a better job in describing their films.
B006LSZECO|4.0|See above. Compellingly different views of the same events.  The shifting perspectives are fascinating. I  would highly recommend this book.  It is a very fast read.
0345535421|5.0|the book was bought for my nephew as a gift.He wants to read the intire set.he is reading it now,he said he love's it and can not wait to start the next one,which I also got him at amazon.As well as the next.There were three books bought at the same time.They arived in the time that was posted and i would order from Amazon again.But I will make sure it is Amazon not  just a store selling under Amazon
B003MC5N28|5.0|I could not put it down, just kept reading it until the end.  My granddaughter recommended the book because they read it in class.
B00976NY6A|5.0|This is a great album.  One of the few that can be listened to from start to finish. Their best so far in my opinion.
B003S6T62Q|5.0|I was very pleased with this purchase....not only did it arrive well before the expected date, but it was like brand new!
B006AZZPCM|5.0|this is the best app out there for music. And I cannot believe it is free thank you so much. I tell everyone that I run into about this app thank you so much for creating it.
B009CPES4I|1.0|Not sure which moron classified this movie as a comedy. It belongs in the genre of \\"directorial tragedy\\". By no stretch of imagination would any body (particularly some retirees from the west!) try to retire in India and more so in a god forsaken hotel in Jaipur. Looks like it is a favorite hobby and pass time for western directors to highlight only the ugly face of India and deliberately ignore any thing that is good. The most recent trend is to have at least one scene where a westerner goes into a slum and eats food served by the dwellers there. Can guarantee it would ever happen in reality. Like the slum dwellers are waiting in anticipation of a western guest for dinner...  uhhhh..    Unadulterated \\"Intellectual Non-sense\\". I would go for any cheap comedy than watch this s***....
034580404X|4.0|The books were easy to read, not my type of romance, they have sex so often that it's not so exciting, but the mystery and plot behind the sex were enough to make me continue reading.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Love it on my iPhone.  Always have something to do while I'm waiting for an appointment.  Gives many options to use.
B005A1ER0I|5.0|Brilliant music, very evocative.  A very talented composer who knows his craft well.  Would recommend this to anyone who enjoys sweeping music.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|Great movie and what made it even better was being able to download it from the comfort of my own home!!
B009VB97EY|2.0|There were far less dance scenes than I was anticipating. The plot was weak and the ending was atrocious. Everyone else who saw the movie with me felt like it was a waste of time.
B008S0IJAM|5.0|If you're already a fan of Aimee Mann, you won't be disappointed. It's gotta be one of her best albums, methinks.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This is a great game for kids and adults. Our family loves playing it in the car on those long road trips.
B0094BB4TW|2.0|Needs some serious bug fixes.  Wont update past the first page of the news feed.  C'mon boys this is amateur stuff.  Once thats fixed, it will be a great app.  Just use the web browser instead.
B007UPNA6Y|4.0|The latest in the series was not as riviting as the previous books but still a reasonable read once it got going.
B005D63ICI|5.0|My husband got me onto this show, and, despite how dark and violent it is, I can't stop watching it.
B000VOC90Y|5.0|Great bag, I am very pleased with the backpack. Exactly as described. My last bag was also an Ibex back, my new computer wouldnt fit or I would still be using it.
0955153077|5.0|I love it, is all you want to learn and begin with digital painting. Good tutorials and everything is explained
B008B3GP2A|4.0|Since listening to &#34;THE VOICE&#34; I have desired to party with Adam Levine. He never disappoints. The order procress could't be<br />easier. The price was bad either.
B005LAIHPE|3.0|Not as good as I expected.  Would wait until it is on television.  There was a lot of action though.
B001OGWY1W|5.0|The best batman movie ever in my opinion. Great suspense, amazing action, you are not going to get bored. Also, you will get to see the best joker performance of all time. R.I.P Heath Ledger.
B0035JRUZQ|5.0|For it's day and time it was one of the best westerns ever made. Two icon stars, John Wayne and Robert Mitchum. It was way before the &#34;spaghetti westerns&#34; of Clint Eastwood (which I also loved).  It was a major first role for James Caan, now also an icon. It was funny, dramatic and the way westerns should be. It was THE all American western.  I have probably watched it 30 times and never get tired of it.  I am grateful for those who finally decided to put it all DVD as my vhs copy has long since bit the dust. It can't be appreciated by today's young people because it was released at a time in this country when morals, courage, friendship and loyalty.  All of these things are rare today but to the older folks who still remember those times it is epic.  Take the time to watch it.
B0000VD04M|5.0|Dieser Film ist alles andere als \\"paradox\\". Edward D Wood junior (das D steht für Davies), der sich nie um ausgefeilte Drehbücher scherte, den es schlichtweg egal war, welche Darsteller bei ihm mitwirkten. Der sich teilweise einfach Szenen aus ganz anderen Filmen bediente, versuchte, diese irgendwie bei seinen \\"Meistwerken\\" einzubauen. Der kreativ war, - äußerst trickreich (einfach aus der Not heraus, so gut wie niemals auch nur ein halbwegs angemessenes Budget zur Verfügung zu haben).<br /><br />Der seine Filme vor allem als Geschenk an das Publikum verstanden wissen wollte.<br /><br />Ein garnicht mal unbegabter Kopf, mit absoluter Fantasie und sogar tollen Ideen bedacht. Jemand, der Herz (wie bei Bela Lugosi) hatte. Für den ein Begriff wie Freundschaft, nicht nur wie bei leider vielen, irgendeine leere Floskel wahr.<br /><br />Ein absolut normaler Mensch, trotz allem, wofür ein stand und eintrat, anderen Leuten dennoch immer zugänglich war, - nicht im geringsten von sich selbst eingenommen.<br /><br />Aber auch mal genauso schwach, verletzlich, introviertiert, den Alkohol und Drogen nicht abgeneigt, in seiner Jugend ein Frauenheld, - und besaß einen ausgeprägten Fetisch für Frauenkleider (mit denen er ja oft am Set plötzlich auftauchte), war aber nicht direkt homosexuell.<br /><br />Kam selber aus ganz einfachen Verhältnissen, diente aber trotzdem tapfer im 2. Weltkrieg, wo sich wschl. sein merkwürdiger Faible für sexy Damenmode schon sehr früh zeigte. Er gab es dann später auch ohne Scheu zu, - unter seiner Uniform sowas oft getragen zu haben.<br /><br />Und der trotzdem richtig gutes Durchsetzungsvermögen als auch eine sehr große Überzeugungskraft gleichermaßen besaß. Dies ist sein filmisches Portrait.<br /><br />Dargestellt von Johnny Depp, ebenfalls ein Ausnahmetalent und sich nicht zu schade, Rollen zu verkörpern, mit denen sich ein jeder identifizieren kann.<br /><br />Unter der Leitung von Tim Burton, Regisseur, von dem schon oft etwas verfilmt wurde, bei dem andere sogenannte Hollywoodgrößen (Darsteller wie Produzenten) garnicht diesen Mut zu Risiko, einen Flop zu landen, bereit wären, einzugehen.<br /><br />Ich mag diesen Streifen sehr, konnte auch herzhaft über die echte Filme wie z.B. den berüchtigten \\"Plan 9 from outher Space\\" von Ed Wood nur schön schmunzeln.<br /><br />Möchte hier auch garnicht leugnen, das man fast schon mitleidig über ihn lachen konnte, ganz besonders in diesem Film. Warum ist klar, eben das wird es halt sein, was Ed Wood (Johnny Depp) hier durchaus so 100 % sympathisch macht. Ein klassischer Fall.<br /><br />Genau so bleibt der echte Ed Wood in Erinnerung. Einfach der typische Underdog.<br /><br />Ein doch naiver Idealist, - der sich halt auch von niemandem hier sagen lässt, er wäre ja nur unbegabt.<br /><br />Der an sich trotz Widerständen glaubt, - der von seinen Ideen überzeugt ist.<br /><br />Sehr selten, - dh. wenn überhaupt, dann vielleicht nur zu vergleichen mit Andy Kaufman, finden wir (die Zuschauer) solche oft (zu ihren Lebzeiten) einfach zu Unrecht verstandenen, echten Visionäre. Ihrer Zeit meißtens schon weit vorraus.<br /><br />Und, bedauerlicherweise, wurden sie z.T. auch noch bis heute nicht richtig für ihre Leistungen zumindest fair annerkannt.<br /><br />Tja, es ist ... und war eben schon immer leichter, einfach nur mit dem Strom zu treiben als dagegen zu schwimmen. Aber, so ist es halt, sei es drum, diese späte Verbeugung, solch eine letzte Ehrung, - eine Hommage wie hier sei ihnen gegönnt.<br /><br />Der verdiente Oscar dafür hat es letztendlich dann doch gezeigt. Schade eben nur, das sowas viel zu spät meißtens erst vorkommt, wenn diejenigen nichts mehr davon haben.<br /><br />Auch die anderen Mitwirkenden, wie Lisa Marie, die Vampira darstellt oder George \\"the Animal\\" Steele, der Thor Johnson verkörpert, ebenso wie Patricia Arquette, die Ed Wood's Frau, Kathleen O'Hara (war mit ihm verheiratet von 1959 - 1978) spielt, oder Sarah Jessica Parker als Dolores Fuller, seine erste Freundin, die ihn dann aber wegen seiner transvestitischen Neigungen für weibliche Angora - Unterwäsche sitzen ließ, - sie alle fühlen sich wunderbar überzeugend in ihre Figuren ein.<br /><br />Martin Landau, der Bela Lugosi hier darstellt, natürlich ganz besonders. Vor allem ist es aber Johnny Depp, bei dem man wie vorher mit Jim Carry als Andy Kaufman in \\"der Mondmann\\" oder auch Woody Harrelson, der Larry Flynt spielte, immer das Gefühl bekommt, sie \\"SIND\\" einfach im Film derjenige persönlich !<br /><br />Und nicht das es nur gespielt wurde, - ps. wobei der echte Larry Flynt ja noch lebt, die anderen beiden hier genannten lassen sich eben nicht mehr fragen, ob sie denn mit ihrer jeweiligen Verkörperung selbst zufrieden gewesen wären.<br /><br />Das bleibt also genau ihnen, dem Zuschauer hier überlassen. Und allein schon deswegen - Fazit - kann ich auch nur die Empfehlung, zumindest als Ausleihtip dafür geben ... ;-)
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I have seen the 1st two seasons and have been looking forward to this one. I have NOT BEEN disappointed. This season has been non-stop action and unexected turns. AWESOME!!!
B0014D6PCO|5.0|One of the best Batman movie of all time. The story line is great, the fight are amazing and Batman B. is more realistic than the others that were made before. Nothing to do with the one with Georges Clooney or Val Kilmer. Go get it.
B005DOKIYG|3.0|Wish it was a bit larger to put in a sylus pen. It is a bit soo small for me.
B006JD48NM|5.0|As a Senna fan I hoped to like it.  I loved it.  Exciting to relive moments with Ayrton and watch his awesome displays of talent.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Don't think I've ever read one of Grisham's books I haven't really liked - they pull you in early in the book & are hard to put down. I started this about 9:30 one Sat. even when watching a couple of football games - put the mute on & went back & forth to check the scores & ended up finishing it about 2:00 am - once you get to a certain point, you just have to finish it.
B00AA7O22U|4.0|I liked that movie because I get to see very good actors from past great action movies performing and fighting each other. J.C Van Dam was great as bad guy. I missed Mickey Rourcke though. It's a good movie, you won't regret renting it on Amazon.
B00136NUG6|5.0|It's a greatest hits album--of course its going to be great.  I'm not the biggest Earth, Wind, and Fire fan out here, but they are a fabulous group.
B009NQKPUW|3.0|Its a remake of Alien with just a few twists and better effects.  The twists don't even come close to divorcing  it from Alien.  At times you'll think you just watched someone reenact a scene from the original....But hey, its got Stringer Bell!
B005K17RU0|5.0|Much better and it's faster than other applications. I did you have trouble with portrait orientation at first on my pad
B009E3EY4M|2.0|I've always been a huge fan of LZ. I saw them 3 times(showing my age)and that is how I would like to remember them along with their incredible recordings. Also, as a guitar player I've always idolized Page. With that, I can understand why Plant didn't want to continue on a tour. Page's playing sounds a bit lost. He tends to rush the beat on everything, especially the solos. His playing sounds weak. On 'Stairway' the guitar is SO distorted, even in the beginning. Maybe the mastering was bad but his guitar has very little dynamics. This goes against his own production values.
B005S9ELQ2|4.0|Ben Affleck continues to prove himself one of Hollywood'd  best, most intelligent 'mainstream' film-makers. In Argo he manages to combine nail-biting suspense created with a minimum of violence or standard movie action, a sharp, dark sense of humor about the weirdness of both espionage and Hollywood, and makes a film about getting American hostages released from Iran without giving in to jingoism.<br /><br />Affleck even takes the time at the beginning of the film to put the Iranian revolution into a larger context of prior American involvement and manipulation in Iran's politics, thus making the Iranians' hostage taking horribly wrong, but also somewhat human and understandable.<br /><br />The story itself is a doozey, and definitely fits into the `you'd never believe it if it weren't true' mold.  Using a fake movie as a cover-up for a long- shot rescue operation sounds like a bad episode of `Mission Impossible' (or even `Get Smart').  But here it is, a part of history.<br /><br />I have only two small complaints about the film.  First, other than Alan Arkin's and John Goodman's deliciously funny performances as the Hollywood end of the deal, not many of the other characters are given as much texture as they might, especially considering how strong the cast is.  Perhaps the fear was slowing down the film with character details, but I would have gladly watched a few minutes more to know these people better on a human level.<br /><br />More problematically there are a number of key moments where the suspense is trumped up needlessly by throwing in some very &#34;Hollywood&#34; conceits (coincidences, physical impossibilities, the real story of the climax being abandoned in favor of more overt dramatics,  etc) in a film that didn't need them, a film where the whole point is how real world spy operations are miles from what we usually see in films.<br /><br />Neither of these flaws seriously damage a very, very good film, but I couldn't help some minor disappointment when I felt the film go for the `movie moment' over truth.  But this is still a highly entertaining and intelligent thriller, and that's to be applauded.truth.  But this is still a highly entertaining and intelligent thriller, and that's to be applauded.
B00A77II0U|4.0|This game has good graphics and puzzles, I only gave it 4 stars because it finishes quickly, but worth the $2.99 I paid.
B00A8ECU24|3.0|Well... It was cool and all but not what I expected. It's a lot like farmville the whole way through but with My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic characters. This would be a game you would want to play it for like 30 minuites and then come back the next day. When I saw the reviews I thought it was going to be an online interactive game but sadly,  no. Another thing I want to tell you is save up your gems and cash. An easy way to get FREE yes FREE cash is to just skip time in the settings on your device if you are impatient. Please friend me: slimehead3, and thanks for reading.
0316228532|5.0|This isn't Harry Potter. Your heart won't soar while reading this, ever.<br />I see this as a character study that's masterfully crafted with over 15 main characters you get to know really well by the end of the book.<br />The plot is a bit heavyhanded and predictable at times. (Anyone see the movie \\"Mermaids\\"?) And I honestly didn't think all that swearing was necessary. Rape, abuse, drugs etc. made it impossible to read in one sitting.<br /><br />BUT, I finished the book several hours ago, and I'm still reeling from the impact of the ending.<br />4.5 stars overall.
B0070ZLZ1G|2.0|If you want to know how to make your kids succeed, this book will disappoint you. Stressful environment is not good for kids. However, this book does not show any proven ways of guiding a child to a bright future. Though this book is not thick, it spared considerable portion detailing a couple of kids playing chess move-by-move. You may think you were reading a how-to-play-chess book. The core message can be delivered in a more concise way. The kindle price has just dropped from $11.45 to less than $8. If the price reduced further to $1.99, it may reflect its intrinsic value. Sorry, it is a book with big title and slim, if not vague, content.
B009S0VG42|5.0|After seeing so many bad reviews, I felt the need to write a good review so that true fans aren't turned off from purchasing this CD/DVD. From start to finish, it's amazing.  I enjoyed it very much and highly recommend it to Coldplay fans.
B004F5GLJ0|3.0|I am going through the series & while this is a good continuation of the story, it wasn't as good as the 2 previous.<br /><br />Still has to be watched though if you want a complete story to the next one in the series. Otherwise it's like not watching a series finale and then trying to watch the next season premiere in a tv series.<br /><br />Recommend but don't expect to be overwhelmed by it's awesomeness.
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|Was very easy to download the app to my tablet. Fun game, grandkids love it too. They spent 2 hours playing already
B0008ENHT4|4.0|As the owner of a 2008 Mustang Bullitt I felt this is a &#34;must have&#34; addition to my video library.  The Mustang vs. Charger chase scenes are considered a classic by all us &#34;gear heads.&#34;
B008XBCJ34|5.0|I had wanted to buy Avatar in 3D, but until now, the price was prohibitive. I really did not expect it to be as amazing on a TV as it was in a theater, and it wasn't, but it was close. I would recommend this to anyone who has a good 3D TV and has either seen the movie in a theater, and loved it, or hasn't seen it and likes the premise.
B002ZHKZEM|5.0|It's a must watch bbc dr who is one of the greatest shows ever. Great story great plots all round great
B007N5YIUS|5.0|Tablets are a great thing for kids and keep them away from my computer. Good product, will go back to app store
B009RI4FRU|3.0|thier is fun plots to this movie and it will get boring if you are not expecting the 60's era  but is has some good parts to it and you want watch with the kids and show/tell them about this era if you can get past some of the boring parts
B009YX02T8|5.0|As well as the ending to a wonderful story, so is the soundtrack.  Beautifully written and the artists that sing the songs are wonderful.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|Ken Follett continues his characterization of life in Europe and America after the devastation of World War 1. The next generation faces the challenges of communism and World War 2. I found the story compelling and historically accurate. The twists and turns of the story are very satisfying.
0547564651|1.0|This is a technical book filled with research that is based on raising children in deep poverty and the adversities they have and how they can overcome it.  Not a book for a middle class household simply trying to get ideas and tips on how to make their children more successful.
B004YM6JLO|5.0|If you love Vampire Diaries, you will love this season even more than the first two! You will not be disappointed with the twists and turns in the plot.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|A Special word of thanks to the developers who continue to improve the usability of this Android App. I am using the Nexus 7 (Jelly Bean) and appreciate the correction for highlighting! No longer are there yellow letters in a a garish blue background - now the highlighter highlights in a a normal yellow background. Add to this quick, easy instantaneous results when opening a book. Excellent job.

B001GMH8SI|5.0|this is a must watch more than once movie for sure! I'm not even sure you'd &#34;get it&#34; if you only watched it once. but it is a great, statement movie, with a great soundtrack
B003V1WTMM|5.0|Another excellent read from Kate Norton. She cleverly mixes modern day with an historical mystery and you really come to care for the characters in her story.
B000SXMQ24|5.0|One of my favorite just non stop Hard<br />will love to buy all<br />of these records<br />super easy to use the cloud player to download to my mp3
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|I love this game! i really like that you can actully draw the things you need! This game is NOT an Epic Fail! I really like it! you should give it a try! ((((:
B009IQ0TGM|5.0|Original, yet it's what you'd expect from Ellie. Quality music from a quality artist! It's not like her debut, 'Lights' however, there are certain parts of the production that is reminiscent of it. But prepare for a different sound, one that I'm sure most will love.
B0090EHVMC|5.0|A very entertaining film for children and adults; we were all rivited to the screen, and now the grandchildren want me to purchase a copy for our movie cupboard.

B0096HIEE2|5.0|was fun to watch the guys dance.....storyline could have been better....would have like to see more dancing from the men
B009NQKPUW|3.0|Didn't thrill me like the Alien movies. Had good effects and even liked the lesser known actors. Good rental. Wouldn't buy.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|Very challenging and fun to play.  Uses several skills from all of the Angry Bird games.  Space bubbles are sometimes a real challenge.
B003204MQS|5.0|I rented this movie for 24 hrs. It was well worth the price at the couple of dollars I spent. Very suspenseful, unexpected ending, but a lot of the dialog was difficult to hear and pointless as well, which doesn't really ENHANCE the sense that you're watching someone's &#34;hamemade&#34; video. It's just annoying.
B008XBCJ34|3.0|loved the 3d version very beautiful effects with all the bright and beautiful colors .....good movie to see at least once
B003TH14H4|5.0|My sister lent me the first season of Castle and I really liked it.  But after this season, I am totally hooked and amazed by the cast.  It has it all.
B00AA7O22U|5.0|Don't expect more than guns, explosions, and marginal acting....it's a great action movie. The Amazon On Demand quality was absolutely horrible. I felt like I was watching a movie filmed in 1950 viewed on a TV made in 1980.
B0034G4P7G|5.0|Aaron Sorkin nailed the script, and oh by the way...why are so many words required to review an item, REALLY?
B00A6PD8RQ|3.0|thought it would have been better than it was....expected a lot more based on reviews that I had read...has a good meaning to the story line.
B0098VXE50|4.0|Amazing twist to an old fairy tail.  You really get to understand it from the &#34;Evil&#34; Step-mothers point of view.
B0098VXBIA|5.0|This was a funny movie and just a good lay in your bed with your kindle fire and chill. I totally enjoyed it and it had me cracking up. Good movie to just watch.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I actually really liked this book. I took a chance after seeing the trailers for the movie, no I haven't seen the movie. i found the story very captivating and couldn't put it down. If you want a good book I suggest this.
B009YU6FJM|5.0|Like always Deftones delivers a great album -Love entombed. Why is there a word min word count, why why why
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Andrew's ability to bring life to such a character is impressive.  We have all the living dead movies we can handle, this series really brings it closer to home.  So stock up on supplies and always aim for the head.
0156027321|3.0|I loved this book at first.  I enjoyed reading all the trials and problems that were encountered.  It started to get weird, then, for me, nasty, and finally, so disappointing.  The only sensible ending made me so sad, I did not want to even think about it.  It made the story so pointless, please, let's have some fantasy.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Nifty, love all the different things. Love the animals and recipes. World pics are really great, as well. Love it!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|thx to this good app i figured out my kindle charger is messed up it will say 100% when its only 90% thanks to this app i know to get ny kindle fixed.thank you!!
B0043WDK2G|5.0|Just love the banter and twists of plots.  Can't wait to start watching next season and forever hoping for another great Kate and Rick kiss.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|This movie was cute. It was great to see a Disney movie without a couple scenario. Loved the animation. Fun!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I can't put it down. It allows me to escape my everyday worries as I become entranced with this mind twisting puzzle that keeps me thinking.
B0001ARCFA|5.0|I have tried several headphones, I was looking for quality sound and comfort. I was about to go all out and purchase a pair of Bose headphones but I do not feel comfortable paying between 250-300. I decided that I needed something very comfortable that I could fall asleep with. After hours of searching through forums and blogs, several people recommended the k-240 headphones. I took a shot in the dark and I am so glad that I bought these headphones. Great sound, (could be a little louder but...) Probably the nose comfortable headphones that I have used. Don't let the size deceive you, these are perfect for personal use. The soft leather headband and ear cushions could not be more comfortable. I fall asleep with these headphones every night, I am very satisfied. It lacks bass but these are definitely worth a look if you are on the fence.
B008JH5CVS|5.0|This had a lot of &#34;Escape from LA&#34; plot when I first saw the trailer.  Yet, Guy Pearce's character was way more fun.  I love his dark humor and how he tries to hide his &#34;good side&#34;.
B0045XICB2|5.0|Catching up for the newest movie! We enjoyed this movie. The series will be great to watch with teenagers. Fun!
B00A6PD9I4|4.0|First of all this is definitely a kids flick but on that adults can enjoy.  Ancient Scottish culture was full of paganism and this film feeds on the superstitions of those people.  Good animatio and good voice acting come together nicely.  Probably my works better for a female audience or at least to have one to help you appreciate the movie more.
B000FA5SMK|5.0|What a treat for my first exposure to DeMille. Already into Lion's Game. It measures up nicely as another great read.
B008Z9YGEE|3.0|I thought it was ok. It could have been better if the people were wearing normal clothes instead of weird theatre type stuff.
B006YXTRHY|5.0|Catching up for the newest movie! We enjoyed this movie. The series will be great to watch with teenagers. Fun!
B009SQRL4U|5.0|My son, who is 7 years old, really enjoyed this movie. It's a really good holiday movie. Recommended for all ages.
B00787IR2Q|4.0|For its time, this movie had crazy special effects. Our 8 year old enjoyed it, and it didn't even have to use swear words or inappropriate material. We have lately been going back to the oldies b/c today's movies are so overdone with effects and language that really is not appropriate for younger kids.
B002ZG97EC|4.0|very good movie and funny for the whole family.<br /> all of action in the movie. very cute little kids.love it
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|Fun movie -- may be frightening for some kids who haven't yet distinguished between story and fact, but that's Disney for you.
B00A6PD8RQ|5.0|My daughter and her friends in college rented this they loved it!!!! They wanted to go back to their childhood.and watch Disney movies
B002DQDV6Y|3.0|We liked this, but there were certainly times when our daughter (8 years old) had to cover her ears and close her eyes. The effects are a bit scary at times. So I would recommend this to an 11 year old, perhaps. But the story was engaging, just like the books are.
B007U4DB4G|3.0|enjoy movie for the whole family. very funny.This movie for the people have dog or pet who love them and care of them.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|A tv series with a zombie movie feel with as many plot twists as it has it's constantly keeps watchers glued to the tube I totally recommend to any one looking for something good to watch. I m solely talking about content I know  it's a little off the graphic novel as I ve heard from sources. But if you don't like spoilers or reading graphic novels.
0061689246|4.0|The story of Tristran begins with the meeting of his father and his mother, a witch's servant, at a market that only comes to town every nine years... And nine months later he is born. At the age of 18 the market comes again and he proposes to his beloved, who tells him she will give him anything he wants if he retrieves a star that had fallen beyond The Wall and brings it to her. He finds, to his surprise, a young woman in place of the rock he was expecting and begins his journey back home with her (unwillingly) in toe. Unfortunately for young Tristran there are others who want the star for their own dark purposes...<br />'Stardust' is very enjoyable and a quick read. The main characters (Namely Tristran and the star) are both very memorable characters. They both grow throughout the novel and their personalities are unique, leading to fun banter and conversations. The side characters are great and the seemingly unrelated secondary plot comes into play in an unexpected way.<br />However, the last part of the novel feels very rushed and not on the same level as the openning chapters. It is somewhat annoying, like the author had a deadline they had to meet and they kind of just threw words on the page. This isn't very obvious as you read, but once you're done it becomes more noticable. It doesn't take that much away from how much I liked this book but it's enough for me to give it four stars instead of five.<br />I'd definitely recommend this!
B009157BWU|4.0|So I really hoped I would give this 5 stars, but I am in the camp that says Tim Allen wasn't quite the right narrator for this. I love Him, but it just became too cheesy. Still, a cute, easy film to watch with your kids.
B006IYY8F0|5.0|This is by far the best DVD about Angola prison. What Warden Cain (and God of course) has done at Louisiana State Penitentiary should be told all over the world.  Warden Cain even says this is his favorite of all the documentaries about Angola!
B0091REZMW|2.0|the game didn't last very long.  I found it on an easy level.  It was not very challenging for me.
B008GBCMHO|5.0|Love the characters and songs in this Disney classic. Fun animation. Everyone in the family from young to old likes this movie!
B0087ITC9C|1.0|My husband and I went to see this movie as we have both liked Denzel Washington in past roles, my husband is a private pilot, and we have friends and family members who are military and/or civilian pilots.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this movie was more about nudity, profanity, inter-racial sexual encounters, and drug/alcohol use than about aviation, accident investigation/technology, and the emotional aftermath experienced by survivors and family members (something I have experienced firsthand).<br /><br />While some of the scenes were well done, the nudity, particularly in the opening segment, and the over use of profanity added nothing to the message of the movie.<br /><br />Shame on the producers, writers, and cast.  They took a potentially powerful story and cheapened it into just more Hollywood drivel.
B000MPEIF6|4.0|This is ok ... the following series are great. You have to watch this to understand the movies after this one. this sets the plot.
B0098VYCCE|5.0|I am usually not into these kinds of movies but with two of my favorite actors, Kristen Stewart and Charlize Theron, I had to see it and it was everything that I expected of them both. Kristen Stewart left Bella behind and pulled off Snow White with an outstanding performance and Charlize Theron has always been able to step into the role of whatever has been thown at her. I loved the story line, the action and the graphic effects. Great movie and great cast.
B0060D11OU|5.0|Have always loved this movie! Know all the songs (and probably the dialogue, also!). Fabulous story about getting a new nanny. Great songs, great characters. Never get tired of watching it.This is a must have for your Disney movie collection!
B001NLKZUA|5.0|Excellent series! Once you start reading; you can't wait to read the next book! This book is not just for teens!
B009WO7NQO|5.0|Bought this game for my grandsons to play when visiting me. They love it playing this game! Very happy with it.
B004LUS390|5.0|Sketchbook Mobile is my favorite app for doodling. Even the free version has all you need for that anytime creative moment. Pay the small price for the full version, and you can upload pics from your device and add to them. I love it!
B0060CWUB4|5.0|Originally saw this in the movie theater. My nephew was crazy about it! As new additions to the family came along, they all watched it and loved it. It has good, evil, and over the top characters in it. Have owned it in every format-VHS, DVD and digital download. Own a lot of the Disney movies. This is a great addition to any collection!
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|Excellent series! Once you start reading; you can't wait to read the next book! This book is not just for teens!
0316017922|5.0|This was definitely one of the most original and revealing book I have ever read.<br />Read it, why not?<br />Go forth and buy.<br />The author uses an abundance of statistical information, anecdotes, and newly found logic that will change you perspective.<br />Do it, buy now!
1878424319|5.0|This is a interesting book with things to think about. Remember this is guidelines and based on your religion, it may not be for you.<br />It still has good moral information for all who have morals!
B007C94QRK|5.0|The muppets have always been entertaining. From the original muppet tv show, up to this movie. The songs are catchy, the story is entertaining. Fun for the entire family!
B001NLL93W|5.0|Excellent series! Once you start reading; you can't wait to read the next book! Now, looking forward to watching the movie!
B00000J6AG|5.0|This CD has some of my favorite songs by Moby on it and is necessary for anyone who likes Moby.
B001RXB4FY|3.0|I thinck this cd is good. I enjoy the songs. I am not blown away but I like it. It's a good rock cd.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|Bought this as a back up for when the family visits, but forgot to bring the chargers for their devices. Works perfectly. Good price.
B000AARKOO|4.0|keeps you entertained, the story line is one of the best I have seen in some time .... I likes it
B005NF2UE6|5.0|I preordered this CD and I was not sorry I did.  The music by Nickelback never fails to please. I even saw a concert on this tour.  Well done.
B0084AZXKK|5.0|This is an exciting story,  well-told.  It would be excellent to read-aloud to fourth, fifth, or sixth-graders. Adults can enjoy it, too.
B0076DCT2G|4.0|John Corey is his usual snarky self.  Reads like an ongoing dialogue.  Asides & self comments are hilarious. Liked Paul Brenner connection.
B009SCRERI|4.0|Loved this and so did my niece. I may have liked it more than her. She wanted to watch it again and I was all for it!
B002ZG975Q|4.0|As a Beauty and The Beast fan to begin with, I was interested to see this movie.  I was pleased with this version.  I like the images on his face.  I liked that Neil Patrick Harris was in this movie too because I am a fan of his works.
B00005V0X5|5.0|While the original production was crap on thie record, the remater is worth it<br />Only complaint is the radio edit of &#34;These Boots are made for walkin'&#34; but original writer made them do that.<br />Great album. Thrash at it's core.
B0086700CM|4.0|The kids love it.  They all seem to really enjoy playing it.  For their enjoyment I give it a 4 star rating.
B009ZTLPJM|4.0|Great to hear Soundgarden back in action. I've been waiting a long time for these guys to come back and this album kicks A**.
B000Z8GZYW|5.0|My whole family loves this movie and so we each now have our own copy.  I'm not crazy about the cover picture, but that isn't terribly important.  The movie is wonderful.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|I really enjoyed everything about this story great ending. I would recommend this book very entertaining, Nicholas Sparks books are always a good reading experience.
B007EDYN36|5.0|I am NOT a Kiss fan, but after hearing Criss on Opie and Anthony I decided to give this book a try. I was enthralled with it and finished it in 2 days. It's a quick read, but I really enjoyed it.
B007D2XSW0|5.0|I've tried a lot of these kind of apps but this one seems to be the best yet. I really like it. Just one thing I hope they add......when you pick your crop size, ie. 5X7, 8X10 etc, add the ability to choose landscape our portrait. ie. 5X7 or 7X5, etc. Other than that, I love it!!
B007FH9GA6|5.0|I love the character Lisbeth, she is quite awesome...I won't spoil it for you, but this book is worth reading.
B008M34INW|4.0|Good action show.  Not for children.  Kind of like a comic book.  Worth seeing. Mel Gibson still has it.  It's worth renting.
B00A17AD36|5.0|I liked the weekend before he got signed. The songs are the same as when he released them prior to signing. There are 3 new songs which are awesome. He does sound a little like michael jackson.
B001OGWY1W|4.0|Watched only because of the Joker; a great movie but at times hard to believe.  How could the Joker alone blow up so many buildings etc?  They should have made it slightly more realistic.<br /><br />OTOH, the Joker is the Joker, so there's 4 stars.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|This is, without a doubt, the best Avenger movie so far. The great special effects in 3-D are better than in the theater.
B009NQKPUW|5.0|Great movie. Questions aspects Creationism vs. Evolution, religion vs. science. From beginning until the end you're watching to see what's going on. The acting is amazing, Noomi Rapace, shows once again that she is a great actress and perfect for the role. This is the prequel for Alien, however, I saw elements from Space Odyssey 2000 too.
B00992CF6W|5.0|i would recommend this game to anyone that enjoys being creative as a release from general stress. it forces creativity one could say.
B003B02PFO|5.0|A great book to read running up to Christmas (or at any time). Easy to read and an unusual story.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|I won't summarize the story, I'd just like to throw it out there that it may be a great intellectual read but at it's core it is a romance. I think the reason it gets so many mixed reviews is because people go in anticipating the former and being turned off by the latter. I was just the opposite, I tip-toed around it for a few months and then broke down and got the audiobook, needing a new romance to pass the time. I was very pleasantly surprised but the richness of the settings and the author's broad range of knowledge. I really enjoyed the characters and the story and it was one of those few gems that stayed with me long after I finished reading.<br /><br />If you are even slightly inclined towards audio books, I strongly recommend the Audible version of this book. The narrator does an amazing job with the voices. Each character sounds distinctive and Matthew's accent is pitch perfect and drool-worthy. I cannot even fathom reading the print version of the sequels now that I've listen to the audio version.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|Very cool adventurous animation. It's definitely not for kids. It has some parts that I think are quite violent for children.
B0038P59A0|4.0|I have seen this movie many times, and it was pretty cool. The acting and story line are superb, but the action is somewhat un-gratifying as each scuffle begins to feel the same. It is sometimes difficult to trace the reason for each scene, perhaps more difficult than the mystery genre would require. All around, a great movie and essential to fully enjoying its excellent sequel, but not great if you want a crazy action flick or something with a lot of re-watching potential.
B004GYY714|5.0|I can listen to my favourite BBC radio stations (or any other) wherever you are in the world. The best
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|Hard to believe this is animation. Pixar's best movie so far. The story is wonderul. Excellent movie. I highly recommend it.
B00899DV6O|5.0|This is an amazing album. An album that you can listen to all the way through. It has a mix of different styles including dubstep. If you like dance music and music to relax to I strongly suggest you get this album. Five stars Two thumbs up!
B009WO7NQO|5.0|A fun combo! Even fun losing, cuz darth vader laughs at u! ....and this reviews is forcing me to write more words....grrr
B008GXHOFW|1.0|I hats it because I had to delete every fame on my kindle fire and when I did it said still not enough space
B00701L5XS|3.0|This is good if you really are interested in learning how to tie different knots or even learning how to untie one if you have to.  Not something that I will really use but it doesn't take up much space for that day when I may need it.
B008GXHOFW|4.0|awesome game.. real fun and entertaining! I love this and would recomend it to anyone! you get to be spiderman and stop crimes and go in missions.<br /><br />but on the down side it takes up a lot of space. and it takes a while to download. but overall a good game.
B004Q7DQLS|5.0|I own over 200 books from over a dozen paranormal authors and this is now added to my collection of my favorite books that I'll keep to hand onto the next generation.
B007SGLZP8|2.0|I would have to say that of all John Grisham books I have read, this was the most boring. The characters were not believable and generally unconvincing.
B005F9TQ2Y|5.0|He never disappoints-even my 19 year old son approves. I have been listening to Bob for 50 years and first saw him in concert in 1963. This is one of his classics.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|highly recommend this great and free app. easy. big keys. fun to use. recommend for many uses especially I like the memory features.
B009HV2JT8|4.0|No complaints here. Streamed very well through my PS3, enjoyed the movie, and couldn't tell that it was being downloaded from Wifi.
B009FZFONO|5.0|I have to admit, I was a Walking Dead fan long before the tv show. When they finally came out with the show I was amazed at the quality they were able to put into it.
0345803493|5.0|Better than the &#34;Twilight&#34; series, and I loved the Twilight series!! I found the book very romantic-I hated to see the story end.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|I love it! Great story telling and amazing cinema quality. This is a must see. You will not be dissapointed.
0307454541|1.0|This book was soooo boring, i could only get to the 2nd chapter.  I rarely every stop reading a book so for me to stop reading this one was a sign that it is awful.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|episode 1 phamtom menace is about qui gon jinn and obi wan with young anakin there are lightsaber duels and lots of fun.episode 2 attack of the clones is a forbideen love story for padme and anakin.episode 3 is about the the fall of anakin and the rise of darth vader it has lot of lightsaber duels and a lot of deaths.episode 4 a new hope is about young luke skywalker and his path of a jedi. star wars epire strikes back is about han solo and princess leia's love and after the death star is destroyed the epire stikes back.episode 6 return of the jedi is about luke and darth vader the father and son bond.the complete saga has a connection in episode 1 and 4 it is about luke and anakin's begining of becoming a jedi.episode 2 and 5 are both love stories. episodes 3 and 6 has the most lightsaber duels
B000EQ4G5K|4.0|Highly enjoyable, like the rest of Rihanna's albums.As always, her album and style change with each album, which I like.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|i normally not play sim game but this is kind of building place for really live. i think its make me think how i could build my own townin the real world. thank to development team.
B005UA0FLE|5.0|Classic Christmas songs with a 'cool' twist, especially 'Feliz Navidad' and 'All I Want for Christmas Is You'.  The addition of the Puppini Sisters in 'Jingle Bells' is especially lively and joyful.
B007ZXK08C|5.0|Fantastic book from start to finish. couldnt put it down and wish it never ended! i would definitely recommend this book!
B0055SWM08|4.0|This app is a very fun game. It is difficult but not impossible to complete tbe levels. Good mind clearing game.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|Terrific characters, good story. Something that may be reality for many baby boomers in the near future. A truly delightful movie
B009IQ0TGM|5.0|One of the best albums out this year.  Ellie's voice is beautiful as are the songs in this collection.  You can't not love this!
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|This is one of my favourite shows.  It's got eye candy.  It's got attitude.  It's got violence.  It's even got some humour.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Once again John Grisham came through with a wonderful book.  Grisham is one of my favorite authors and continues to produce great fiction! :-)  This one is no exception.
0439023521|5.0|I bought this for my book club, and we loved it we are looking at reading all of them and getting the movies to go with them
B001O7Y9ZU|5.0|I bought this to replace a cassette I had listened to throughout high school.  I loved it then and I love it now
B008GXHOFW|1.0|I wouldn't know. I bought it and got rid of all my apps and books and it still did not fit. I think that game loft should stop having games need so much data:(
B000ID37RM|5.0|Gregory Peck's character shows the epitomy of being a mature adult (a real grown-up.)<br />This is the type of man, I think, we all strive to be. Too bad the author never wrote another book.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|amazing show. cant stop watching it. 3rd season is the best yet. sundays are now that much better with walking dead after football
B007N8RULO|4.0|Good way to pass some down time while still exercising your brain. Hate the int<br />Qrusiv<br />e ads but feel it's worth to play.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I have Pinterest 5 stars because it is so addicting with all the great information it has. I can look at it for hours an get ideas on everything around me. I'm telling everyone I know about it!!!
B009GEFXLC|5.0|I love the show Castle with Nathan and Stana.  The show is great, the acting is wonderful.  Season 5 was a great season, but I especially loved the last episode titled &#34;Always&#34;.
B00A6PD8RQ|5.0|Wonderful movie for the family and excellent quality happy customer I'll be purchasing more movies soon<br />would like to see more HD movies available.
B008Z9YLV2|4.0|Having not read the book, I didn't know what to expect from this movie. My wife and I watched this and enjoyed it. She had read all three books in the trilogy and was worried that the movie would be too gruesome for her, but she ended up liking it as well. I look forward to the other two titles in the trilogy.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|this book is so well researched tha it could be reality. Loved it. Anticapting the movie. GO ZOMBIES, BRAINS GRAAAh
B004FEL6GO|5.0|My 5 year old son loves Transformers.  Especially, Bumblebee!  This toy was inexpensive, and made a little boy very happy!  I was surprised how well he was able to transform the toy back n forth from robot to car, etc.  I guess each child has different strengths, but I even find it easy to transform.  My only beef with it is that the parts fall apart too easily, but for the price it's still a good toy.  Though it comes apart easy it has managed to remain unbroken.  Would recommend this toy to others.
B009NQKPUW|3.0|Enjoyed the film for the most part but the ending was kind of unsatisfying. The alternate ending did at least explain one mystery. I did not believe the heroine's motivation (What would charlie do?) for further risking her life and limb.
B003AYMZO2|5.0|It gave me a great idea of what this season was about and I really enjoyed it.  I hope that it will be as good as it looks.
B0049P1ZZQ|5.0|I am a huge Walking Dead fan, I have already watched season 1 three times now but i love collecting movies and series on dvd, and to get Season 1 on Blu Ray for only $11.99 was an awesome deal!!! LOVE IT!!
B007PBKG5G|5.0|I had heard &#34;Hold On&#34; on the radio, and knew I wanted to hear more.  I bought the album, and couldn't wait to buy tickets to see them live.  Brittany has a fabulous out-sized voice.  Amazing!!  This band has a really good lyric sense.  They make riffs that sound somehow retro and familiar, then they take them in unexpected directions.  I love this album.
B001W2JWWC|5.0|My review is not required. This is one of the all time great rock and roll albums by one of the best bands ever.
B0010T3UUM|4.0|hard to find size 14.....yea//gift for someone that couldn't find size in black.<br />haven't given gift at this time//christmas gift
B007HC3LHS|5.0|This is one of the most interesting books I've read in awhile and I read a LOT.  I became intimately acquainted with the protagonist, in the here and now and in her flashbacks.  The alternating chapters, which almost convene in time was well done.  I loved learning about her past and reading about her dealing with it in the present.  Really good book, very hard to put down--I just wanted to know how things turned out for her then and now.  I wanted to see her triumph.  Great dialogue and writing voice.  I am looking forward to more from this author. I like her style.
B009A3NGF4|5.0|I knew from their first album that I was going to love this band, wherever they went with their music.  This album makes me nostalgic for the raw emotionalism of their first album.  &#34;Babel&#34; is more professsional in every way, but it's certainly obvious the difference that it makes being a &#34;name&#34; band.  It is obvious that they have much better backing, and they clearly have grown up.  This is a band of grown-up professional musicians, as opposed to the raw adolescent sounds of &#34;Sigh No More&#34;.  Clearly, they are proving to have staying power.  All my best to them, but I must confess that I will always find my heart tugged more by &#34;Sigh No More&#34;.  Sigh!!!
B008QTVNUI|5.0|Very gripping series.  The plot keeps us at the edge of our seats!  The characters are well cast, especially Claire Danes as the Carrie, the troubled CIA agent.  Locking forward to Season 2!
B009FZFONO|5.0|Walking Dead is Awesome!! So psyched for no commercials!!! Highly recommended to anyone that wants to watch it from the airport!!!
B0053KWDES|4.0|Increases bass. Can sufficiently drive headphones that my iPhone and MacBook Air cannot. Only worth it with very good headphones
B0092MKFIY|5.0|My son and I stumbled on these guys by accident.  We bought tickets to AWOLNATION, and Imagine Dragons opened for AWOLNATION.  They had a warm-up band Zeale, first.  Then, Imagine Dragons were so good, I truly mistook them for being the main act.  I just thought they were AWOLNATION playing new stuff!!!  I really enjoyed both bands, but was BLOWN AWAY by Imagine Dragons.  These guys play terrific music, and are visually stunning.  I couldn't wait to get home and buy their album.  It was WELL WORTH IT.  These guys are going all the way.  They are the best new band I've heard in years.  Rock on, Imagine Dragons!!!
B00933JF74|5.0|UPDATE: They have updated the game since my original review, and it is simply BETTER!  Two additional scenarios were added, and all the scenarios are now playable as sandlot games after the initial 'quests' are fulfilled.<br /><br />In fact, there isn't even a mechanism to drain your money from you.  No temptation to overcome.<br />In addition to that, the game is fun to play!  It is kind of Warcraft-esque in that it is a manpower, resource allocation, develop technology, but no war is involved.<br />My tablet will occasionally launch then exit.  Don't know if it is this app or another one mis-behaving.  Killing all other tasks has always solved it, so, less serious than a power-off (Or being told by Verizon to pry off the back of your droid and remove the battery).<br />There are prestige points you earn, that you can use to unlock other game stuff, or have 'instant' builds (very helpful when starting a new game). I have played 3 of the 4 'scenarios'.  They are OK, and a good learning tool (the first is the tutorial) but the SandBox is where the fun is at.  Use points to unlock all the landscapes.  You will not be disappointed.  It saves \\"4-pages\\" of games, so you can save up an old city and play it when you need to make points.<br />While the landscapes are static, you control the replayability by how you choose to build your towns.
B00005N6KG|4.0|They are perfect for running but don't last too long. I order them two at time so I have a back up when they die. These headphones are the only ones that don't fit funny in my ears. The headband holds them nice and snug to the head.
B0065CCM76|5.0|All of the songs on this album are hits and they are great to listen to when driving long distances.
B008M721MS|1.0|It seems that I cannot use it on my Kindle Fire. I keep getting a message that it is not supported. Bummer!
B007QPFGJW|5.0|I got this book because my brother recommended it. It was very funny. A little bit like Forrest GumpGreat book
B008Z9YGEE|5.0|It was best to have read the book first. so many details in the book were left out, but knowing them helped to explain events in the film. Special effects were well done. I wonder how many people realized that this could be more truth than fiction. Catniss is my heroine! I even bought the mockingjay pin and I'm a senior citizen.
141659521X|5.0|There is nothing like a new Vince Flynn (Mitch Rapp) Novel. I can't wait til I can pre-order my next one!
0446580848|5.0|One of his better books. Liked many of demilles books. Wish he could write faster.<br />A great writer of detective and mystery.
B007MB5OCE|5.0|Greaf book. Witty and humorous. Recommended by my brother. Kind of like Forrest Gump in a way. Read it and you will agree
B008AK8FHM|2.0|I got bored and stopped reading it by the 5th chapter. I really like these types of books, but this is more about the author's life than the &#34;proof of heaven&#34;.  I just lost interest in his odd dream during his coma.
B008OOYALE|1.0|the dragons are super cute, but you have to chat and get friends to do anything and I cant find the missions that get gold for you. If that was changed i would definately 5 star it.
B00917IQFY|4.0|For me, this was an easy and enjoyable listen.  With this revival, GP and the R has has \\"aged\\" lol like a fine wine.<br />Hints of the old yes, but a newness that is refreshing and sustainable in my humble opinion!  This music would be a nice ride live.  Hope to see them in Pittsburgh soon!!!
0345803485|5.0|Start with book one and read the trilogy in order.  This is a good book, no matter what you've heard.  I'm not crazy about reading about kinky sex and skipped those bits after w while.  You get the picture real quick!  But the story is actually a fantasy love story.<br /><br />You'd be interested to know that the apartment they live in is real.  After this book was published the realtors had so many visitors, just to see the apartment, that now they only show it to pre-qualfied buyers, by appointment.  I got started on this first because it was banned here in FL at some libraries.  While it no longer is, I am totally against that and am interested in anything someone else prohibits me from reading.<br /><br />This is not for children or teens.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|My Granny uses this and she likes it.  It's easy for her to keep up and mark off her daily reading.
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|I read all of these books in the series and I am a huge fan! I really love these books, but I must say that this book number seven is not my favorite of them all. Only because Greg never gets any happy ending! There just wasn't that big of a climax either. I really enjoy the series though. I wish the books were longer because every time the next one comes out I read it in like and hour and a half! But all the other books get five stars! This one just gets four. :)
B009HV2JT8|5.0|It was an awesome movie. It kept my attention. It was very interesting. Great mixture of fiction and historical facts.
0345803493|5.0|I'm sure you have heard about all the kinky sex in this book...but skip over those parts if you want, and absorb the true love story behind it all.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|i love calculator plus because its simple to use has oversized numbers which make it easy to see and best of all i got it for free!
B008M87GJK|4.0|Very informative and great design. News I can't find elsewhere, especially world news. Plus love the feature articles on travel.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|This movie had a great story line, my son loved it, and graphics were amazing!!  This movie is a must see!
B00006JIA4|5.0|I got this after watching a biography on Freddie Murphy.  What a rock star!  This set has all his most popular songs, and a lot of very good other ones.  I don't know why I never paid attention to him when he was alive, but this set brings back memories of his era.  Very  good and worth while.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|really enjoy the ponies and the whole set up, but i wish that game play was a little different. more minigames etc.
B0083P1QUM|4.0|Scarpetta fans will enjoy this newest in the series featuring action, betrayal, favorite characters and their complicated relationships with each other.
B000HKW7E0|4.0|Had a great time with the family. we were entertained by watching this movie as a family and it was the first time my parents had seen the movie.
0345803507|5.0|This series is really good.  You can skip over all the kinky sex parts, those parts got really got tiresome anyway.  It was like &#34;what again?&#34;  Kinky sex is not something I particularly want to read, but this is really a love story, and very good.  Very interesting, but I would start with Volume One, and read them in order.
B006AZZPCM|5.0|This app is very intuitive, works great and is very easy to use.  One can search yoytube with it.  Once you find a movie you like this app gives you the option to view it or download it.
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|Easy to use. A great aid and utility, The dictionary is a terrific and useful addition to tools for a tablet.
B00946ZOT8|5.0|The Rosalie Barbie is so beautiful, and in a barbie-esque way resembles the actress who plays her, Nikki Reed. She is a must have for any Twi-hard or anybody who loves barbie in general. Her hair is so soft and gorgeous, and has a nice wavy look to it which is pretty movie accurate. She has very durable arms and legs. Her skin tone is a very beautiful pale color and has slight blush on the cheeks. She is by far my favorite of all the dolls and is the main reason I started collecting them. So buy her, it is worth it!!:)
0385535147|5.0|I have read a number of Grisham's books and they are all very good. In my opinion, I have to say this is the best one yet. Fast paced and full of twists and turns that were not expected. When I finished it I wished there was more.
B00153ZC8Q|5.0|Considering it was filmed in 1984 and was the first movie directed by John Cameron it is terrific.  Honestly, I don't know how the movie got green lighted.  &#34;Cyborg Robot from the future is transported back in time to ensure that nuclear war....&#34;<br />If I were a studio executive hearing that script, I would have said they were nuts.<br /><br />Truly a classic movie....
B008R14YBK|5.0|I got this cd and it was awsome! It's better than I thought it would be. I would recomend this cd if you like people like Demi Lovato or Selena Gomez.
B00486070K|5.0|I don't know why I waited so long to make my life easier. This is exactly the product I needed to use the Ethernet which makes all things more accessible. And Amazon Prime is the best!
B001EC2ISA|5.0|an all star cast in one of the most creative comedies in years. My kids have seen this movie dozens of times and by default, so have I.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Love my Kindle for Android app.  It took me a while to figure out how to get it installed and linked to my public library system, bit it was worth it.  Now, we just need more books.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|My cable that came with fire had been giving me a lot of problems. It didn't seem to fit right and this one is snug in the fire. So much easier to use and was replaced FREE. Thank you Amazon & customer service.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Love the subscription.  Love the show.  So easy to use.  Would totally recommend for anyone who can wait until it comes out on DVD or have time to watch at home.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|My review addresses only the formatting of the Kindle edition that includes the complete Hunger Games Trilogy in a single ebook. Several months ago, when I first considered buying that ebook for my Kindle, I was disappointed to discover that other Amazon customers had run into a problem with the font size varying from chapter to chapter in the first book, The Hunger Games. It didn't prevent them from reading the books, but it was definitely annoying. I downloaded the free sample to see for myself, and the problem was obvious, so I didn't buy the ebook at that time. At one point, I reported this problem to Amazon, and I was told that Amazon was trying to get the problem corrected through the publisher.<br /><br />I'm happy to report that when I downloaded the free sample again today, the problem appeared to have been corrected. I then went ahead and bought the trilogy ebook. I can now confirm that the font-size problem that was discussed extensively in another three-star review here has been corrected. I'm not saying the ebook is now flawless (free of all typos, for example), but THAT problem, at least, appears to have been corrected. I hope this is helpful to those who, like me, held off on buying this edition due to the font-size issue. I've looked over the corrected version on my Kindle, and I now give it five stars overall for formatting. It looks good.
B0097GVJWQ|3.0|It seemed like a lot of unnecessary back & forth. I liked the game & finished it with hints. It was well worth the price. The graphics great but I had to u too many hints for this type of game. Took some time to finish. I am usually good at figuring a game of this type but finding the needed items was an adventure of it's own.
B0000DD79B|4.0|Very nice to hear them again on CD format. Nice mellow tunes. I wished I had ordered it on the Essential 3.0  CD. Thank You!
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I call on this app every morning, before I leave for work. It is great for knowing what kind of coat to wear. This weather app is just a great one of have, for anyone who needs or wants to know the temperature and the humidity. It also includes short videos from the weather channel. It is one of those apps you will never feel bad about getting.
B008B1VYP0|5.0|I've seen many people talking bad things about this album, but for me is a great one.<br />Of course is different from what they used to do, but still have the essence of Maroon 5<br />Love it
B004UPANAI|5.0|Hugh Jackman and Liev Schreiber tore up the screen in this movie. It was exciting to see the relationship between the brothers evolve and the evolution of Wolverine. It was action packed with historical war scenes, x-men battles and brother on brother fighting.<br />The movie explained just enough of how Wolverine became the man he is and left enough room for additional movies to fill in more gaps. It teased me and left me wanting more.
B0098460O4|5.0|I play this cd at least once a day.  These teenagers are awesome and I hope they are both very successful.  I think<br />their friendship brings out the best in them.
B0090P98Z4|5.0|The game has great flow. I love the graphics and the style of game. I would recommend it to all my friends.
B001LM1456|3.0|Ed Norton is one of my favorite actors and  so is Tim Roth; so it pains me to say that I didn't love this movie. It was a pleasant diversion, but not engaging. The characters were flat and unrelatable, the plot was the typical &#34;hulk&#34; story and there were no exciting surprises.<br />The action sequences were the only thing that made it bearable, but I love explosions, so I may be biased.
B009S8PEHY|5.0|I love this album. This is a wonderful Christmas album.  This would be a fun album at a Christmas Party! It will certainly get everyone in the Christmas spirit!
B00A3DZ61W|1.0|I paid for the ad-free version and cannot get that to load, so I tried the free version, this one with ads, and this won't load either. I don't understand, but maybe the universe is telling me I have played angry birds too often. I un-installed everything and still cannot get this to work. Very disappointing.
B007OUFESC|2.0|I like all of the actors in this movie in other things that I have viewed, but hated this film.<br />The characters were exaggerated and farcical reproductions of people. I found it impossible to relate to or sympathize with them. It was surprising how unlikeable they all were. I keep waiting for some redeeming scene or quality to emerge and was disappointed.
B0096CDG0O|3.0|I love playing Dice with Buddies, I just don't like that the app opens upside down (to me) when I open it on my Kindle Fire
0525952926|2.0|Fall of Giants was such an interesting and compelling read, which is what made me shake my head when I completed Winter of the World.  With the exception of Volodya and Daisy, the characters are simply archetypes of historical figures that you might find in a middle school social studies textbook.  Gone are the complex characters that pulled readers into the story: Billy Williams, Ethel, Walter, Maud, Gregori, Gus, and even Fitzherbert...these were characters that drew us into the world of the First World War.  I agree with some of the reviews on here, the writing seemed stilted, tired and lazy.  Though comparing some of the prose to the product of a high school creative writing course is a bit much, I found the work boring and the language passionless.  The characters are the tragic component, introducing a new rather placid generation while completely ignoring and abandoning the old, dynamic personalities that really entertained the reader...I don't know what to say...if you are a Follett fan, than it may be worth a read...if you are a reader of historical fiction, I say give it a pass, the historical references are amateur, bordering on the infantile.  Follett blasts through the history...a more careful author might have expanded the book, while making sure to tighten the story...references to the Nazi T4 Euthanasia program and the Russian mass rape and terrorizing campaign during the fall of Berlin are a surprising addition--you usually don't find these topics in historical fiction.  I hope that Mr. Follett concentrates on creating far more interesting characters for his conclusion, and less on teleporting us through years of history.  Most of your historical fiction readers know about the history...we read to be transported to that era and his characters usually take up there.<br /><br />After reading some of the previous reviews, I feel that I should make an observation regarding some of the partisan comments made by some amazon customers--this is not Fox Newor MSNBC people?!  Follett and his researchers actually did a fine job of reflecting some of the major ideological ideas of the time period.  Our conception of social democrats, conservatives, communists, socialists and fascists are completely different than the world of the 1930s.  Fascists and communists are both depicted in a negative light, and conservatives (British and American), are rightly, depicted as sympathetic to national socialism--remember Philip Roth's alternative history The Plot Against America.  I would never consider Winter of the World as a great piece of historical fiction---it's extremely mediocre---but its definitely not partisan.
030759565X|5.0|Do NOT judge this book by its unfortunate cover! I couldn't resist the title, but the black almost had me pass it up.<br /><br />This is the best cookbook I've had the pleasure of reading in quite some time. And, I've flagged a bunch of the recipes to try myself.<br /><br />There are a variety of degrees of difficulty in the recipes included, but they're all one degree of delicious sounding.<br /><br />This goes to the top of my gift list this year!
B006YXTRHY|5.0|I very much enjoyed the first movie in the series and while the 2nd and 3rd were kind of tedious (which happens when you have to build a story like this), this next to last segment was action-packed and amazing. I am by no means a &#34;Twi-hard&#34; but I definitely enjoyed this installment of the series.
B001QWBM62|1.0|It's got a lot of great features and the sound is AMAZING, but at the end of the day it's only as good as it's construction. It broke after using the #2 input only a few times. #2 input now doesn't seat the 1/4\\" cable properly and pops it back out no matter how forcefully it's put in. TRASH!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|amazing game!  you will not find a game like this. I love it. everyone should get this game. that is how good it is.
B000HKW7E0|4.0|Great fun...great flick.  This is a marvelous family film.  The comedy is based on the typical issues that arise in families...exaggerated, of course.  There's even the grotesque &#34;trailer-trash&#34; part of the family that you cannot help but love despite their trashiness.  Comedy does not work when the writers take themselves too seriously, and these writers do not make that mistake.  Parts are laugh-out-loud hilarious.  Yes, there is some &#34;toilet&#34; humor, but if don't take yourself too seriously, either, you will love this movie.
0345803485|5.0|Love it! Couldn't put the book down. I can't wait to read the other two! Naughty but in a classy way lol
B005CKPQNE|5.0|&#34;Every great magic trick consists of three parts or acts. The first part is called &#34;The Pledge&#34;. The magician shows you something ordinary: a deck of cards, a bird or a man. He shows you this object. Perhaps he asks you to inspect it to see if it is indeed real, unaltered, normal. But of course... it probably isn't. The second act is called &#34;The Turn&#34;. The magician takes the ordinary something and makes it do something extraordinary. Now you're looking for the secret... but you won't find it, because of course you're not really looking. You don't really want to know. You want to be fooled. But you wouldn't clap yet. Because making something disappear isn't enough; you have to bring it back. That's why every magic trick has a third act, the hardest part, the part we call &#34;The Prestige&#34;.&#34;<br /><br />Season 1-3 were the pledge. Seasons 4 and 5 part 1 were the Turn. Season 5 part two, will be the prestige.<br /><br />Breaking Bad is the American Dream on Trial. It's 'There Will Be Blood' with a 4 season backstory. Breaking Bad is simply the greatest teleplay, the world has ever known.
B002RSQGQK|5.0|This was my first experience using instant video and was very simple to access.Worth watching Hitchcock masterpiece ,shared viewing with my 11year old niece and she loved it.
B0065GC0BA|4.0|The course of true love never runs smooth. I enjoyed this book even though it had me in tears.<br />Well written and had me not able to put it down
B000H5TVJY|5.0|The broken man stands as an indictment of our own inhumanity.<br /><br />He reaches out, continually, trying to find a human connection in a sea of flesh. He is surrounded by shallow people, in high society, incapable of having any meaningful conversation, incapable of true empathy towards one another, inexorably constructed by the media around them.<br /><br />However, as everyone around him seems to thrive in this 80's based, high-society due to these inhuman characteristics that have become increasingly reminiscent of our society, writ large, you have Patrick Batemen, being utterly consumed by them.<br /><br />From a psychology perspective, it's actually quite an astutely written film (book) and character. From a satire perspective it's nothing short of brilliant. However, it can at times be bloody, gruesome, and downright gross, it certainly isn't for everyone, but ultimately the film misportrays itself as a killer flick. The murdering and sex, are circumstantial to the true point of the film, which is social satire.<br /><br />I found the Blu-ray rather satisfying. I could very easily pick up on the film grain and was more than pleased with the picture quality. It's perhaps not the best I've ever seen, but nothing warranting 1 star reviews. I can't comment on the surround sound though, as I've only got a two speaker setup.
B009ZAY8MM|4.0|Love their rendition of \\"Carol of the Bells\\"!  Can't have enough of Christmas music and this is a welcome addition to my collection.  It will have its share of playtime these next few weeks!  Congratulations, Pantatonix!!!  --N. A. DePano
B007KOYEOC|5.0|Hard not to fall in love with Mr Grey. Not the best written book but as we all know there is something about Mr Greys story that just won't quit!
B002N7CTKM|5.0|The humor covers a massive swath, from the physical/obnoxious humor of Chang, to the filthy of Pierce, to the meta of Abed, to the wit of Jeff, to the innocence of Annie, to the overcompensation of Troy, to the new-age satire that is Britta, and the ever unfolding unexpected backstory of Shirley.<br /><br />The show isn't just funny, it's sincere, it's subtle, it comments on the dynamics of people, and culture. It can be downright wacky, or insightful, or intelligent, or even all of those things, at the same time. It's truly an extraordinary show with an all star cast and top-notch writing team. All of my friends, love the show in sometimes very different ways. In that way, Community is little like the schmoo. It's something for nearly everyone.
B003L20IHE|5.0|We really enjoyed this video.<br />It is a great family, feel good movie.<br />I highly recommend it to anyone wanting to watch this kind of movie

B000HKW7E0|5.0|Just a good old fashioned laugh at families stuck together for the holidays. Checy Chase at his best, lots of 80's outfits...just fun.
B0042U94UQ|5.0|This is a movie that is exceptionally entertaining from small children to adults.  We loved it!  Very well done with super animation.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Enough said. Don't pick up this game if you something else that needs to be done:) I love it !!
B008F5YDRI|5.0|An excellent storyline! Characters were perfect, loved Ewan McGregor, and the premise of the plot. Great movie for just chilling out
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|This is an excellent holiday movie for kids (and adults) of all ages!  I would highly recommend it.  My 2 year old grandson to my 14 year old grandson just love it as well as several adults in the family.
0812982622|5.0|I don't pay a lot of attention to book awards, but if the ones for 2012 have been handed out and this book didn't take them all, something is wrong.<br /><br />The Orphan Master's Son is the most inventive, creative, compelling novel I read this year, maybe in many years. I've seen it compared to Orwell's 1984 and Huxley's Brave New World, which seems apt. I think the difference for me in reading Johnson's novel is that I'm reading \\"history\\" in the moment. It contains, like those novels, commentary on totalitarianism, methods of torture, the struggle to find beauty and meaning in a world filled with propaganda, attempts to describe the culture of a people who have no choice in the songs they sing, the clothing they wear, the stories they tell, and who moreover have no concept of freedom. I find it darker than either of those novels, and it is not an easy read. Torture, starvation and delusion are not light fare. But the writing is beautiful, the research that went into this novel apparent, and the moments of beauty rise like the dawn. The scene in which two children are encouraged to engage in true storytelling (as opposed to spewing propaganda), led by the narrator with crumbs of fantasy and delight is amazing. Many of the early scenes when the narrator is on a fishing boat are also filled with stunning description. I've seen the words \\"magical realism\\" used to describe this novel--it would not occur to me to describe it that way. To me it reads more like science fiction of the dystopian kind, a la Orwell and Huxley.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|I enjoyed this tremendously. The characters, storyline and setting were exquisite. There was actually a really scary bear! I didn't expect the bad guy to be so bad:) Great family film
B0098VYCCE|1.0|Not well written and poorly acted movie that has some cool special effects though. However that does not make up for the lack of meaning.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|awesome game  love pllaying it wish there were more like it. my sister was ther one to get me started on it
B0001XAPZ6|4.0|Saw this movie a few years ago and it was one that I really wanted to own. Really like the theme.
B009O2XY12|5.0|I love this game.  I have it on all my devices.  The only thing I don't like is the limited game play.
B008GXHOFW|1.0|bought it and it wont even install. says try again later...well later never comes...btw not even worthy of a star
B007FY9ZWI|1.0|It will allow you to play music but there are no controls, such as volume,  until you purchase the paid version. One of the interesting things is that it made me download isyncr, and that was what I was really looking for anyway.
B009NQKXYK|3.0|Unnecessarily confusing at times the movie does have its fair share of thrills and oh my god moments- just not enough to make it great.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Love this show! I watched it on UK TV and will watch it again in January 2013 in the US.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is really one of those games that is great to have if you are just looking for a way to kill a few minutes. It presents a little challenge, makes you think and you can always just stop and come back to it later.
B009KHCRVO|5.0|Don't take it seriously and you will have no expectations with which to compare.  Great farcical fun. Enjoy the silly and the slightly serious commentary and  b movie sci-fi plot guilt free
B008QTVNUI|5.0|I only wish that amazon let you know that it was downloadable before purchasing. Can only download to a kindle HD...
B0081JPTCQ|4.0|I have had the opportunity to use this a couple of times as a note pad and it worked really well. However, the icons and what they represent is not that clear. It takes a while to figure out where all the commands are.
0812993357|5.0|i've waited for a long time for this to come out and it lived up to my expectations...especially if you're connected w/ the fashion industry
B0085Z8F4A|4.0|I went to this movie expecting something along the lines of A2, which is what the promos implied before the movies release. What I got instead was a movie that I felt dragged with little action. I'll leave out the prequel discussion because that could take up another entire day. Adding to my gripes is the hottest chick in the whole movie was barely in it, and while I'll give Ridley the nod on the special effects, this movie could have been a lot better. I would hope the sequel has some action based on the ending of this flick. Time will tell.<br /><br />P.S.<br /><br />I wish some of the deleted scenes actually were used in the movie. The scene at the end where she treats the synth like a sub-human and stuffs his head in a duffel gave her an edge I felt she needed.
B001CDLATE|5.0|Possibly the most beautiful and provoking documentary ever made. Worth buying on blu ray until you get a chance to see it in 70mm at the cinema.
B007HACDLK|5.0|As always I am entertained by Vince Flynn and his unstoppable hero, Mitch Rapp.<br /><br />This fast-paced trek into what is an eerily relevant situation in the middle east keeps you clicking away at the next button...(aka page turner!)<br /><br />Rapp, a strong-willed, brave, decisive character is the perfect hero. He is not bothered by trivialities. He sees the answer to the problem and powers toward the resolution.<br /><br />I wait with baited breath to see what situation Rapp will tackle next! Thank you Vince Flynn!!
B008WCP2PG|2.0|I was so looking forward to this movie and was so disappointed.  There was no story line and I am no prude but I not understand why every other word out of any of the actors mouth was f___.
B000MRA5NS|5.0|After the criticisms regarding casting, Bond returns with a renewed attitude.<br />Beautifully shot and crafted, superior to the follow up Quantum of Solace, Casino Royale is a successful adaptation of a static novel.
0345803507|5.0|This book is truly an amazing end to a great series. It had a lot of unforgettable twists and turns, and I love the fact that there was a bonus at the end. A definite must read...
B0085TKAW6|5.0|This is the continuation of the story of 5 families in &#34;Fall of Giants&#34;.  It is a great story based around WWII and the start of the cold war.
B001U0HBPG|1.0|I watched this movie thinking it was going to be good, however it was a waste of time and energy. It sounds like a good movie at first, but then when you start watching it, you realize just how bad it actually is... I mean come on, he ages backwards... No high interest point to the movie and it's very slow moving. Just save your time and watch something else.
0345803493|5.0|There was so much that was explained in this part of the series. I understood most of what happened in the first installment, so this one was an ultimate help in what I felt was a whirlwind of information.
B0056CUZRA|5.0|This is a wonderful story of 5 interconnected families during WWI.  It gives a view from a Russian, Brittish, German and American perspective.
B005CRQ4OW|5.0|This book is a fun family book to read. It is very funny and is full of excitement. It is a real page turner.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|This is a must see movie...I can watch this over and over again. This movie has so much action and it also has some comedy in it. Great movie for any family...
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I loved it so much that I read it too fast, and missed it when it was finished. Wow....can't wait for the next one!
B005PK553C|5.0|BEST SHOW EVER!<br />You never know what's next and ever episode leaves you hanging as you sit there and say &#34;is that really it?&#34;
B006ZCWU5K|5.0|This was a most welcomed addition to my collection. Some whimsy that didn't always appeal but great to hear that strong soaring sound again from the Boss of my musical history.
B000YHG72E|5.0|Loved renting it from amazon on the roku. Quick and ready to watch for no more than any other rental.
B009LA1R34|2.0|Nada nuevo,esto es como un cd de duetos,nada original,un par de canciones te ponen a bostezar,un producto de fabrica,nada natural,fake,boring,annoying......
B002KGEORM|4.0|Well worth watching! SOA will keep you coming back for more. Bet you can't watch just one! Sign up for amazon prime and watch all the SOA you want for free!
B0087DFIOU|4.0|OK, I was completely surprised by this movie. Very pleasantly surprised because many of the things I've always liked about Mel Gibson's more &#34;on-the-edge&#34; characters were back in full force. A preposterous plot (A corrupt city inside a Mexican prison?) but no worse than the last two Mad Max movies. I was also very impressed with the writing and cast that surrounded Mel and added so much life to the otherwise overused &#34;South of the Border in a jail&#34; formula plot line. Plus, you can tell Mel and his cast were enjoying making this movie. I'm astonished it didn't get (or I didn't see that it got) any theatrical release - it appears to have gone straight to DVD. Too bad. I think Mel could have recovered more of his recently badly tarnished Hollywood cred if it had been available, even with an R rating. Whatever his politics or family issues, he's been an entertaining actor and director who has always taken chances and done things his own way and I respect him for that. And I enjoyed this latest romp. Felt to me a lot like the early Lethal Weapon days - wild, unpredictable and sharp witted.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|One of the best films to come out this year. It's a great watch from nearly any standpoint. Blockbuster movie-watchers, Comic nerds, and HD fans will all love presenting this movie to others.
B0050VI5SI|5.0|Foster the People and this album Torches is a great indie jam. The music is easy listening and is something you can drive to, do  homework to, and workout to!
B007C4ZJ0S|4.0|The first fight scene captured my interest because of the moves the female lead uses. I enjoyed her fighting throughout the entire movie. Didn't give it a 5 star because of the story line, but will watch anything this actress does in the future.
B008J05EL8|5.0|This fit in perfectly with some of the things I am currently doing with my Kindle.  Good Choice I like it.
B0053KWDES|4.0|The battery cover arrived dented. It will not close all of the way. I contacted FiiO, and they offered to mail me a replacement cover. Kudos to them, I will add a star when it arrives. There is slight feedback when it is very close to my iPhone. WiFi, Bluetooth, cellular, I don't know, but is means that they must be kept in separate pockets. Annoying, but tolerable in my situation.<br /><br />If you can deal with keeping them in separate pockets, its a good amp, particularly with a line-out adapter to clean up the line a bit.
B006O2QNOU|5.0|The movie held my attention from beginning to end, easily.  Some of the dialogue and \\"little speeches\\" are priceless.<br /><br />What I got out of the movie wasn't so much that wall streeters were to blame; more so I think the filmmaker suggests that these behaviors are a societal or global issue that needs attention by everyone.  One of the characters justifies it through a human nature argument, which was interesting, that people can't help but be who they are.  My favorite part of the movie is probably when Paul Bettany's character is talking to the guy that's going to be fired.<br /><br />\\"Listen if you really want to do this with your life, you have to believe that you're necessary and you are.  People want to live like this in their cars and their big houses.  The only reason they get to continue living like kings is because we got our fingers on the scales in their favor.  I take my hand off, the whole world gets really fair really quickly and nobody actually wants that.  They say they do but they don't.  They want what we have to give them, but they also want to play innocent and pretend they have no idea where it came from.\\"
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|This game has a terrific scheme and is a hoot to play. You can spend a lot of time (as l have) and still not complete all the levels and some of levels are VERY clever.  A really reat game!
B009LK6JS2|5.0|This game is really fun, you feel like you are really flying.  I would reccommend it for anyone wanting to fly.
B002ONIST6|5.0|And still love watching this movie. Denzel and Russell Crowe did a fantastic job of acting in this movie. Excellent!!
B0063IH60K|4.0|great way tp pass an hour or two when your waiting at the doctor or dentist, or shopping with your wife.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|Typical Follett work. Great detail presentation and situation description as usual.  He is my favorite author starting with Pillars of the Earth.
B004V5A7K8|5.0|I enjoy playing this game.  It is not hard, but can be a bit challenging.<br />I like that the balls change to the color of the block that you knock out - something that I didn't notice<br />at first.  I've only made it to stage 2 so I have a ways to go.<br />The kids like playing too!
B005R32L66|3.0|I'm still getting the feel for this app, Don't know how good it is yet.  Some issues may be more my phone that the app.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I HATE reading but when my mom friends all started reading and raving over the books, I had to give them a shot. I quickly feel in love with the books and had a hard time putting them down. As a new mom, sleep is rare. But the books were so good that I read every night before going to sleep, giving up that precious time. Yes, many will say that the books were poorly written using repetitive descriptions. I, however, thought it was fine. I think that was part of why they kept my attention. They were written in a plain, everyday language that made it easier to follow and get into the story instead of tripping over little used words to show how great an author is at using a dictionary. I wish E.L. James would write more to the series or another series similar to this one. I feel like a trader to Christian and Ana by reading any other series!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|John Grisham has returned to his old ways,thank heavens.If you loved The Firm and The Client ,you 'll love all the twists and turns,and surprises, of The Racketeer.
B009ZAY8MM|4.0|Great sound, great harmony. Have enjoyed the songs they have covered, looked forward to something more &#34;original.&#34; Only once or twice did they not quite hit a sound they were trying for. Great for just a vocal performance.
B003PIS5XI|5.0|The special effects were state of the art for the time and hold up well enough to be entertaining by today's standards. The plot was simple with no wasted action or twists. The acting was superb with two of my favorites Robert Preston and Dan O'Herlihy. The film will appeal to fans of Back to the Future and although no sequels were made, there was enough room at the end that perhaps one day someone will make the leap and defend us once more against Zur and the Kodan Armada!
B009WO7NQO|5.0|Tons of fun if you are a Star Wars fan or fan of birds. The different powers of the characters are fun to explore. Can't wait for the update.
B009VB7QQA|1.0|No plot, terrible acting, it has it all... wrong! I can´t believe it´s a blockbuster...<br /><br />Avoid this movie and watch anything else!
B007STBUIW|5.0|I was blown away by the image and sound quality of this movie on blu-ray.  Jaws is one of my all-time favorites and I am so glad Universal gave it such high quality treatment.  It is worth the upgrade!<br /><br />And who doesn't need an extra digital copy so you can watch it on your portable device while vacationing at the beach ;-)
B008XBCJ34|5.0|Needs a 3D TV to get full effect.  Just loved the movie and this transaction was perfect.  Highly recommend to anyone.
B000001FTD|4.0|Among the Living is one of Anthrax's most popular albums. In my opinion it is a little overrated more than we give due credit. For years I thought Anthrax was \\"unworthy\\" of being in the Big Four, my friends, fellow metalheads I apologize for my younger days. Among the Living is a classic thrash and metal album. With songs like the title track, Indians, A.D.I this album will not dissapoint. I really like the song N.F.L, I'm a fan of the gang vocal shouts, It gives a punk feeling to the whole band. If you ask me, Anthrax has one of the best drummers in the business. Overall, if you want a thrash metal collection you must have this album along with their masterpiece, Persistence of Time. 4 Stars, a good album, not a masterpiece but still good.
B0099G4Y26|5.0|EVERY single song on this album is fantastic.  Great mix of love songs, angry songs, and somewhat silly songs - 3 aspects of every rough relationship, something P!nk knows a lot about.  I have really enjoyed this album.  My other favorite P!nk album is 'Funhouse' and this is definitely on par with that CD.
B007MU85D0|5.0|I love nearly every song on this album (which is rare). Would highly recommend the entire album! Enjoy everyone! :)
B004VYYA2K|5.0|I bought this for my 5 year old daughter because for her birthday and for Christmas she will be getting a lot of Barbie stuff, this is perfect for her and she absolutely loves it!!!! She can store everything in here! She also loves the fact that it also unzips and becomes a play mat!!
B009LUBA7M|5.0|I've really enjoyed both of Mika's other albums and this one does not disappoint.  I think it's my favorite so far.  It's just pure pop fun, hard for me to not dance around.  Exactly what I need for gray days like today.
B000YHG72E|5.0|This movie is an amazing movie for the family to sit down and watch during the holidays, Every year around November and December, my family and I sit down to watch Elf and A Christmas Story... CAN'T BEAT IT!!!
B007ZXK08C|4.0|This was a real page turner - loved being on the edge of my seat with so many twists too!
B008CPZNL6|3.0|There is too much tendency for Flipboard to push certain sites on the user.  It is also a puzzel why some sites are difficult to remove.
B002BI6SMI|5.0|apparently I ordered this movie on DVD as well? I ordered it on Blu Ray and I guess by accident I purchased this on standard definition as well... Still an amazing movie
B000JMLFLW|1.0|Why is this still being published? How does anyone finish this stuff?  The women are pathetic, their lives meaningless; the men are shallow; thank goodness I don't have to live in such a self centred universe.  I'd rather shoot them all in the first five pages, and let characters who are trying to contribute to others' lives get more oxygen. Talk about suffering for Austen's art - she did, so we have to too? Give me strength!!
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|Great game lots of fun! Every time I play another series of angry birds it just gets better and better!
B00A3AUGEW|4.0|This is typical Phillip Phillips music, with no surprises.  This album proves he was the right person to win American Idol.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|Great comedy for the family. Always a good laugh. It has creative writing and great line delivery by Steve Carell.
B006YXTRHY|5.0|Amazon asked me to write a review so here it is.  I rented Breaking Dawn Part 1 from Amazon to view before possible purchase.  I had heard Bella was going to get pregnant and I was very curious as to how that was going to work out.  Well, I found out!  I totally enjoyed this movie.  I found myself laughing a lot through it, just some funny dialogue and actions in it.  Not laughing at it but with it sought-a-speak.<br /><br />This review is for Twilight fans who are curious and want someone else's opinion before seeing it or adding to their collection.<br /><br />After seeing the end of Part 1 I couldn't wait to see Part 2 and I saw it in the theatre this past Tuesday.  All I will say is if you've seen all the other Twilight movies you can not Not see the end of this Saga.
B004LWZW8S|5.0|A stunning movie to see in \\"Blue Ray\\".  Very entertaining, visually exhilarating.  I highly recommend this movie to action buffs, especially fans of \\"300\\" and the \\"Titans\\" series.
B006IN2F10|5.0|Great Christmas gift, my son will be so happy when he opens it.  He loves falling asleep to his favorite stories
B0000DD7LC|5.0|Alicia will not fail you as all of her CD's as excellent!  This CD arrived on time and I was very happy with it and I still am.
B005LAIHZY|4.0|I got this for my 4 year old daughter.  She did she it in the theaters, but as any parent knows, kids will watch this stuff until their retina's explode.  A few scary scenes, but that is part of growing up.  We did make sure to be with her the 1st few times so that she understood the scary scenes and now she is a bit more grown up.<br /><br />Highly recommend.
B0000AKCLS|5.0|We were so lucky to attend a concert of his in Tulsa, OK in November. He played for 2 solid hours with jaw dropping talent. This is great jazz/blues music..Husband marathon runner loves most of these tunes on his Ipod.
B001NTJV6G|5.0|This Mp3 was easy to download with no problems.<br /><br />Erykah is unique as so is her voice.  You will not regret the purchase!
B00A7ZWUJC|4.0|I love this album. It seems like she had fun recording these songs. I can listen to the whole album without skipping tracks. It's an overall good feeling to this album and shows her growth as an artist.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I loved both of the books in this series. I just don't like that I have to wait soooo long til the next one comes out:(
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I love anything that is written about someones experience with heaven.  It just confirms what I believe will happen when I die.
B0069G5Z9K|2.0|it looses your data! it skips a lot!!!!!!!!!!!!!! it does not work all the time!!it starts over, and you do not get the coins!
B009JNXK88|5.0|If you like super meat boy and retro style, this game is for you. The controls are great and gameplay is progressively harder.
B004SVM7BW|4.0|The only thing I don't like its that you can't change the size of the high lighter. When I try to highlight something it tends to highlight more then what I want. But other then that its a really good app and its easy to use.
B009ZXT4BY|2.0|This game is a complete copy of Minecraft, right down to the look of the trees. Mojang should sue CRG.
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|Oregon Trail: American Settler is a pretty fun game, if not time intensive.<br />The recent update on the 22nd, not so great. The game crashes every time I try to plant beans and it won't let me scroll further than that for the strawberries or other planted stuff.<br />Its a fun game but the update just frustrates me. As well as the missions that I have: where can you get the barbershop?
1846556007|4.0|It only makes sense to finally have the first Harry Hole novel which has been referred to in most of the subsequent stories. It was worth getting it all the way from the UK.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|great series, great actors, wonderful story, not all the cursing you find in most shows, cant wait to see season 3, and I hope there will be many more downton abby series to come. absolutely wonderful. more, more, more.
B0086449YA|5.0|This is an album by a master at the peak of his powers.  The songs are great and the band is fantastic.  Beautiful melodies, bluesy and heartfelt, and the title track is an insightful glimpse into a time long gone.  It's magic.....
B0045XICB2|5.0|Allowing customers who purchased twilight to watch the movie for free online since we don't get it today is definitely why I do business with Amazon.
B003CI90MQ|5.0|Don't need to go through 100 pages of introduction before you get to the real stuff... Every page is loaded with useful tips and the whole book makes you want to get out and start shooting.
B0045MPPJK|5.0|Normally don't like rap, but this is different. Very talented group from south Africa. Their music video is great too.
B00906J7KO|4.0|Lovely but missing substance. it is almost too repetitive but it will still be entertaining for your pets and kids
B007THA4FI|5.0|Loving every word of this book! I can't read fast enough! I have never met more despicable characters with such everyday dark secrets... To make matters worse, every characters flaw is undeniably human nature.... you can't help but see yourself in some of their thoughts and rooting for the downfall of each one anyway
B007EECSFA|4.0|The progress of the tale is a bit jerky with many obvious clues that something is afoot.  The conclusion was well worth the time it took to solve the puzzle.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|The best show on tv at this time. The multiple stories and fast paced twists keep my attention riveted. Can't wait for the next episode each week.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this game. I t keeps me entertained when I'm on the go. I love the little wishing game the best.
B00571F26Y|5.0|I've been having issues for a long time with getting sick 20mins after eating. I could not figure out why I was having issues until I read this book. Now I understand that I have to watch my wheat in take. I've decide to do more and remove all wheat from my eating life style. I cannot wait to live again and feel good. This book was amazing and I'm looking forward to the cook book which I already purchased. Five stars a must read for everyone.
B007SGLZP8|1.0|Story is not original and book was boring. Haven't read one of his books for a long time and will be a ling time before I do again. Way over rated!
B005AERS74|4.0|Nice easy Maroon5 listening. The mix of songs is well balanced and it is a nice selection of Maroon5 tunes. Enjoyable for a Marron5 fan.
B00097E4A6|4.0|Ordered this toy for my nephew. He loves it! I got it for a great price and it shipped quick.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|I really enjoyed reading all of the Fifty Shades Trilogy. I thought book was the best.  I enjoyed how the booked ended as well.
0525423656|2.0|WHAT HAPPENED!? the first book in the series was AWESOME...and this one....was boring...it had a few interesting turns in the plot...but not enough!! I really wanted to LOVE this book...sadly..I am very disappointed :(
B009DZDJU6|4.0|It had good actors.  Abraham was pretty cool at getting vampires.  Lacked a little something but fight scenes were pretty good.  Some things in the movie you just knew were a stretch.  All in ask decent movie.
B004132HZS|5.0|I watched the first episode of this amazing series online and from then on I was hooked. I have happily watched and re-watched the entire series from season one to the heartbreaking season 2 finale about A THOUSAND TIMES! I even managed to get my PARENTS hooked on the series.  I'm biding my time till series 3 comes out in Fall 2013. Oh, hurry Steve Moffat. Hurry!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|LOVED this book!! if you haven't already read this book, you are MISSING OUT! the plot was great, and the characters easy to love!
B008B3GP2A|5.0|Well, It is Maroon 5- what else do you need to know? They are great! Adam Levine is awesome! Great album!!!
B009D5VNLS|4.0|This is a good story.  I wanted something that kept me on the edge on my seat.  I think it's lacking in some areas.
B00A6PD9I4|3.0|Nice story, about finding one's own way instead of blindly following what is traditional or expected.  Graphics are very nice.
B00571F26Y|5.0|This book will rock your world!!! I have been wheat free for months after reading this book and I have lost 30 pounds, never feel like I'm starving, I eat tons of good food- never felt better! I recommend this book to anyone and everyone I can!!!
B008764ZQ4|5.0|I loved the movie and love that this soundtrack has the actors signing the songs like in the movie.  Love it.
B009YU62H2|4.0|There is some lighter melodic stuff like Cornell's solo stuff but most of it is like their mid nineties albums.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This is just not one of your dumb zombie movies. It is a series involving family, friends, strangers meeting along the way and helping one another to survive. Rick is the absolute leader with the courage to do what is right to protect his flock. He never waivers. My favorite character is Daryl. Daryl started out as being the bad red neck and has turned into one of the bravest members of this group and truly has a soft spot in his heart which is very attractive.
B00628SJJS|5.0|A very good movie. A classic that every one has seem and talks about. A different perspective of the nazi party
B007IXWKUK|2.0|Very predictable. Sex over the top gifts and same control issues from Grey. Same old self esteem drama from Ana. If you like repeat performances this is what you are looking for.
B004JN1D2I|2.0|I had read the first three years ago and anxiously awaited the sequel - hoping it would be the conclusion. WRONG! I do enjoy - sort of - Mr. Martin's books, but there are way too many characters, strange names, places, castles - you name it and, I've given up on this thing ever ending.
B00A6PD9I4|4.0|Prior to renting the movie ($1.99 special), I read the reviews to ensure its appropriateness for my 7 year old son.  I was also interested in it because a friend had mentioned it touches nicely upon the relationship between a spunky teenager and proper mother - a circumstance in my household.<br /><br />I must admit the majority of the reviews are spot on and well written.  The movie is heart warming, delivers a good message, and is very entertaining.  My whole family enjoyed it.<br /><br />Now, to those who say it was too violent, showed too much skin, and had witchcraft in it, well, too each his own, it didn't bother my 7 year old one bit.  Some folks took their toddlers and pre-K aged children to this movie.  All I can say is, &#34;What were you thinking?&#34;.  The movie has a PG rating, not G, so responsible and informed parents shouldn't take pre-K kids, in my opinion, as a general rule.<br /><br />In closing, a good and enjoyable movie with a heart warming theme, especially for proper mothers with spirited daughters - but leave the toddlers at home unless the rough and tumble Saturday morning cartoons don't bother them.<br /><br />Tony
B009K0P10K|5.0|Not sure where they are going to take you next. The modern day Dallas keeps you routing for the good guys but still loving the bad guys too. Nice eye candy
B00001ODGR|5.0|A perfect Styx concert.. Such unique personalities. Dennis, Tommy and JY make beautiful music together. I saw this tour live, Turn up your volume on this one and rock out.
B0041KVXLK|1.0|I am sure that a perfectly pressed copy of this is quite wonderful. Unfortunately, mine were not one of those. I say \\"mine\\" because I have exchanged(3)copies of this already with no luck. I was able to hear side 2 without any issues so I know it can sound great. I have four other titles of this reissue set and I am very happy with those.<br /><br />The problems with the Pepper album seem to be the same. They all seem to be on side one. Most of the other reviewers have described the same problems.<br /><br />This is what I think the problem is. Most of the later albums like Pepper, Abbey Road and the White Album are the ones that seem to be having the most problems. I think that the pressing plant over pressed these records on worn stampers because these were going to be the most in demand. This historically has been a problem with hot selling records. No quality control just to get the numbers out. To the manufacturers, its all a numbers game anyway. Back in the 1970's, I had to return 10 copies of Led Zeppelin's Physical Graffiti before I was able to get a decent one when it first came out.<br /><br />Once the dust settles, I'm sure a lot of these problems will be resolved and will go away. I am not going to give these reissues a bad rap just because of few bad pressings. I have heard enough of this record to know that I still want it. As soon as I can find another the plays properly, I am going to grab it.<br /><br />I have been buying these separately to avoid the problems with trying to buy the perfect box set.<br /><br />Update:<br /><br />I recently ordered another copy from Amazon,(4th)copy. This was the worst one so far. I am beginning to believe that there isn't a good copy anywhere. I will give it another try before I throw in the towel.<br /><br />Final Update:<br /><br />\\"Praise Be\\" I finally was able to get a hold of a good copy of this title, and it sounds good. I was beginning to think that one did not exist.<br /><br />Although frustrating, I think that Rainbo should get another chance. All the other LP's of this issue that I got were superb. What all this feedback is telling me is that vinyl is truly on a comeback course. A project like this should have been spread out among several of the pressing plants. It's too much for one pressing plant, even for the likes of RTI and others to have the pressure of 100% quality control. I don't know how may vinyl pressings were actually done, but I am sure that it was way more than the normal 5000 to 10000 pressings that a regular reissue might receive. Let hope that if EMI decides to do another \\"Mono\\" reissue set, they will learn some of the lessons of this and spread the job out a bit.<br /><br />Mystery Solved?<br /><br />I had been wondering why I seemed to be the only one having problems with this pressing from the local record shops in my area. Nobody else seem to have the same problems.<br /><br /> A recent event may have solved this mystery. I recently switched out cartridges and replayed my distorted copy of this record. For what ever reason, this record sounded fine with the different cartridge. The previous cartridge was an Audio Technica fitted with a shibata tip stylus. The new cartridge was a Pioneer fitted with an eliptical tip stylus. Both cartridges are in good working order.<br /><br />So if you are having problems with the sound on this record and you have a cartridge with a shibata or microline tip, this may be the problem. Those tips may be picking up distortion further down in the groove. You may want to try this out using a different phono cartridge. I would be interest if anyone else comes to the same concludion
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|awesome movie. really good action movie. can't say as I've seen a movie about the &#34;black widow&#34; before. was a good part anyway. enjoyed it.
B009D5VPTI|4.0|Cute movie, animation could have been better and characters other than the main character and the mother were extremely exaggerated (ugly) and thus non-believable. Her &#34;suitors&#34; are not Disney princes by a long shot. She is to consider one of them for marriage after courting them? Yuck!!! The music was beautiful. Julie Fowlis is the best!
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|It has both character and feeling, I would recommend this film to everyone.  The story you can not go wrong with, has some good 'lessons' for younger people to.
B007SGLZP8|2.0|Not one of his better books.  He is. capable of much better work.<br />Hope his next one is back to his normal offerings!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|its great there's lots to do on this game. fish hunt fragile. build. I wouuld recommend this game to friends
B009HV2JT8|5.0|This was an action packed movie. I loved the special effects and Abraham Lincoln a vampire slayer, who would have thought this movie could be any good.
B0056C6XIA|5.0|when i bought this i was excited to get it! the time frame by which it was delivered was amazingly fast, however, when i got it the fire starter is pointless because there is no flint to go along with it! it is pretty much a useless piece in this pack! the multitool is very useful and unlike some of the other comments i saw on here, i have been able to use it for just about anything.<br />i give it an 8 out of 10 and the only reason it isn't a 10 is because i am disappointed about the fire starter!
B008BSPQ3E|5.0|A very good set - not only great to have SO again to see him in concert at the time interpreting songs gives a great insight into his music.<br /><br />All the music aside the book and the documentary a worth it on their own,<br /><br />Great work Peter, a classic lives on, can't believe it's been 25 years - I was young then and Sledgehammer remains my favourite video clip of all time!
B0081L37Z0|3.0|This movie was pretty funny. It was not the funniest movie I've seen, but was funny and my friend enjoyed it.
B000HT3P7E|5.0|The price was great, and the dvd was brand new and in its original packaging! It made a great present.
B008Z9YLV2|3.0|I was a good movie, but I thought it would have been better than what it was considering all the hype.
B008J34466|5.0|I bought this album while it was on sale for 49% off, and it came here fast! I ordered the album 20 November, and it got here on the 24th. The album is great, and I love almost every song. The only problem I have is that Amazon does not offer a clean version of the album.
B009ZTLPJM|5.0|Non-fans that \\"never got\\" Soundgarden, still will not \\"get them\\" with their recent release in almost two decades; fans from Soundgarden's \\"glory days\\" may not want to \\"get them\\" anymore; however, their distinct sound is in effect with King Animal: odd time signatures, sludgy-Zeppelin/Sabbath riffs with undertones of punk and touches of middle-eastern, and for my money, their news songs are fantastic.  The four members sound as if they haven't been disbanded since 1997, and they can still bring the thunder on both uptempo songs [Been Away Too Long; Non-State Actor] and slower songs [Blood On The Valley Floor; Rowing].<br />My favorite songs include: By Crooked Steps, Taree, and Worse Dreams.  However, all the songs are very well put together, while my least favorite, Halfway There, is still decent.<br />This may not be the group's best CD, see Superunknown, but for the fact that the 2012 rock landscape, and the last 10 years, seems to have been missing something, it seems that missing component has been Soundgarden itself.
1475143389|5.0|I have lifted for quite a while and needed a change in my workout, so I ordered this book. This book is very well written and I recommend it for anybody interested in weight lifting. Mike is a great guy and offers a lot of good tips on lifting, eating, and also on a variety of other tips for a healthy lifestyle. I read this book in less then 24 hours and will have tips to follow for the rest of my life. I hope everybody interested in a healthy lifestyle reads this book at some point in life. Thanks Mike for offering so many great tips. Also I had a couple of questions for Mike and he emailed back quickly to help me out which I really appreciate. Great author and great book 5 stars!<br /><br />-Matt Hayes
B0016OLC5Q|5.0|It isn't often that a film moves me; especially with the junk they make these days. This movie captured me from the beginning and never let go. Brilliant writing and directing. The acting by the main character was good, others were lacking here and there, but it was minor. Truly a wonderful film. I long for those adventurous days of youth, traveling about with no money in my pockets. I was able to relive my past in this movie and remember what is truly important in life.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This game really holds your attention. It is great for all age groups. I have trouble putting it down! Very intertaining!
B005PK553C|4.0|entertaining and i enjoy the way the story is constantly changing and at times a bit humorous. I'm getting ready to watch season 2 and hope its as good.
B009VB97EY|5.0|This was exactly what I expected and even more!  I loved every minute of this movie and highly recommend it
0060589272|5.0|I used to own this book before but of course let a friend borrow it and never saw it again. I wanted another hard cover book and was excited to see that Daily Deals had one for sale on Amazon. The book was in a better condition than what I expected. Sometimes you never know what you are going to get when it comes to used books. Will use them again when looking for a used book.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|absolutely bad.  plain bad.  worst game there is. is my 2O word limit up yet. bad game bad bad bad bad bad.
B008NR8YTQ|4.0|I have heard imatators but Gary Moore doesn't do that. He plays it his way. Jimi would love it. He plays it better than anyone could nowdays. It's a shame he's gone also.
B007SGLZP8|1.0|I usually love John Grisham's books, but this one left me cold.  I finished it, because I must finish once I've started, but I didn't enjoy this one like so many others.
B005CW5E3E|4.0|HE keeps it simple and his guests are varried and support him well. All these tunes are old school blues standards and very enjoyable.
B001NKI60W|5.0|Avid fan of ABBA so the flaws of the film are made up by the score. I'd recommend it to anyone who enjoys a musical, romantic comedy.
B005XN31LY|5.0|I really had no desire to watch Once upon a time.  I started listening to what other people had to say about it, and decided to give it a chance.  It was much cheaper to purchase the whole season, instead of a show at a time.  I'm glad I did.  I am now hooked. The writer of this show are absoutely fantastic.  I can't wait to finish the 1st season and catch up on season 2.  Love It, Love It, Love It.
B004XNGKBS|1.0|If this were a FREE app it still would not be worth the money.  I have a fairly good writing hand but on this thing it turns it into what looks like hen scratching - almost totally unreadable.  And you dare not lift your finger from the screen until the entire word is complete.  I'm slow so it took me all of an hour to realize I had wasted my money.
B007IXWL2C|1.0|so sad that I gave into pop culture pressure and ordered this book.  I wish I had kept myself above this
B008HTQ28K|5.0|I have always been a fan of Grisham, and he certainly did not let me down with this one.  While realizing the improbability of this incredibly complicated plot, it is still fascinating, intriguing and nail biting to the end.  I loved it.  Can't wait for the next one.
B007EE4XKI|5.0|I loved the storyline and the unique perspective. This story has continued one of the great Star Trek stories. The only issue was that the end felt rushed. But I will definitely buy the next book in the series!
B004T4LUPW|5.0|the perfect calandar merge.  easy to create schedules that are repeating but not regularly.  just drag and drop.  nice visual layout.  easy to see.
B002VRZEYM|4.0|For anyone who has ever wondered about what they are eating and the story behind it. So glad I don't eat fast food or much meat.
B005ZOBNOI|3.0|I had so many unanswered questions when this book ended :(  I enjoyed the book all they way up until the end, and then it just ended.....
B0036BK6MW|4.0|All around enjoyable film. Great life lessons and an ending that brings a smile to your face. Sandra Bullock is always great!
0316019984|5.0|This book is super cool.  It's has intricate design and wow factor.  This makes a great gift.  I also purchased Peter Pan.  Equally as nice!!
B006M9NJFG|3.0|I thought it was alittle pricey, but it comes with me on all backpacking trips, and has done the job. It is well constructed, light, and the tin cup is good too. Its a canteen, what can I say.
B008XNZMOU|5.0|Taylor never fails to amaze. This album is better than the last - listen to the duets! Everything Has Changed is my favorite.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|product was for my grand son 5 years old.  He says it is the greatest ever.  I take his word for that.
B003YTN4S4|5.0|This is Such a cute movie and a great story. My kids loved it and so did my husband and I.
B000SGGUWS|5.0|Awesome! I love reading the books on my kindle app!! Downloads instantly to your kindle app which is amazing. Highly recommend.
B001706I5I|5.0|We love this movie so much! We had no problems viewing the movie! This is such a fun family movie!
B004SIIBGU|5.0|Doesn't matter if you're buying or selling this app works great! I actually find it easier to use this app than to sit down at my computer and use the Internet.
B0087YPCYA|3.0|THIS IS NOT 3D!  We rented thinking it was  3D (wanted to try out on tv) and ended up re-renting on U-Verse and paying 2x for it. The actual movie is campy and cheesy with lots of nudity... What do you expect, it's entertaining for what it is.
B003Y5USF0|5.0|This movie is one of my favorite oldies but goldies! Totally recommended for a Sunday evening. Effects are already starting to look old, but hey! This movie is OLD! haha
B001AKTZOQ|5.0|Just old school, had the album years ago, and wanted CD. CD arrived within a week. Brings back great memories!
B0064X7FVE|5.0|The weather reports are timely, but the maps are fabulous.  This was the 1st app I wanted!  Highly recommend it.
B00866H7SS|5.0|Absolutely brilliant good story overall couldn't wait to get a chance to read it on my kindle should have bought one of these years ago
B007SYWFRM|1.0|so i had this game on my nook color and it was great and i got pretty far. i didnt use real money for in-game currency though, but i checked in all the time.<br /><br />i just got my new kindle fire HD and i wanted to get ice age village on my kindle fire also. as son as i installed it i tried to open it and it said 'ice age village has stopped'.<br /><br />[If u have a kindle fire u know what im talking about. WHY DOES EVERY FRICKING APP HAVE PROBLEMS WITH THE KINDLE FIRE??b!?!?!?!?!?!?! IM STARTING TO THINK I CHOSE THE WRONG DEVICE. MAYBE I SHOULD HAVE BOUGHT THE ipod or samsung galaxy player tab.u cant do simsimi or go on goohle plus apps. U DONT EVEN HAVE A DOUBLE SIDED CAMERA (the kindle fire hd has a front facing camera) I didnt buy the wareanty so i cant return it.]<br /><br />if u have the KINDLE FIRE, DONT BUY!!!!!!! will justbwaste space on ur device.
B00AA7O6QC|3.0|If you are in the mood to watch mindless explosions, awesome stunts, and rampage then this move is right for you. These movies will never win an Oscar and that is Okay! It will provide substantial entertainment and give you a good return on your craving for action. Kids have &#34;The Avengers&#34;  and the older generation has &#34;The Expendables&#34;. So sit back and set your mind to cruise control.
B001K3EXTA|5.0|This is still the best version of a film adaptation so far. I don't think there is a more handsome man than Robert Redford circa 1974.
B00008PC2O|5.0|This is the PERFECT gift for any terminator die-hard fan. It has directors commentary, behind the scenes, and hours of bonus footage on the making of Terminator 2 movie as well as extra scenes not released in theaters.<br /><br />This movie is deeply touching. I mean its so sad that the Terminator cant stay with John Connor and tells him &#34;.. I know now why you cry, but its something I can never do.&#34; Absolutely, the the saddest scene in cinematic history. I mean the kid has no father and this killer robot can't stay with him and ...ohhh its sooo sad. Its the closest any film has come to making me cry.<br /><br />Excuse me I seem to have allergies.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|Our 10 yo can't put it down.<br />Papa and teenage sisters play it too.<br />Mama is concerned with the laser fire, but it still passes the &#34;not too violent&#34; test.
0891419063|5.0|Good book cover to cover. Thank goodness there are men that are willing to fight for our freedoms. Good price and the shipping was prompt.
B009HV2JT8|4.0|I admittedly did not know the story beforehand thinking that it was going to be more slapstick.I was expecting more humorous gore and more unnecessary nudity with the concept of the movie. I was pleasantly surprised that there was a great balance of story and violence (only brief nudity of a dead woman).
B009P5S11G|2.0|After reading the reviews that said this CD was her best I have to say I am very disppointed.  I should have known there was a problem when she released Diamonds.  In my opinion her best work was Good Girl Gone Bad.  This CD sounds depressing and forced (the monotone voice throughout is killing me).  It is honestly all over the place.  Will the real Rihanna please stand up.  According to estimates she will be number 1 next week but this is NOT a shining CD in her career in my opinion.
B0050R0XPA|4.0|My wife and I love Legos, Star wars and Doctor Who. That being said, we found this series of lego and decided to make our own Christmas village, complete with the Doctor and Amy(obviously not included, but not hard to find compatible figures). The sculpting of the buildings was well done, including a light brick to light the windows. The set really like having 4 different sets in one. The post office, A postal truck, a child playing with his dog and a winter pavilion. The set has several people, more than usual for the price of the set however No Santa. For the price, a great value.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|The Walking Dead is a great series.  Zombies rock, and this is the ultimate zombie experience.  Keep up the good work.
B009NQKPUW|4.0|Like the special effects and the look of Vickers actress.  The beginning was confusing, why did he/she commit suicide?  The ending was too simple.
B009FZFONO|5.0|This is the best show ever. It really draws you in and you just cannot stop watching it. I defiantly recommend it.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|Okay, so the swivel portion of the DVD holders on the inside of it is broken. None the less, it's awesome. I ordered like a day ago. No lie, and I got TODAY. I'm super excited to spend the next few days watching the ENTIRE collection and gaining hermit status. Awesome product! SUPER FAST delivery. Thank you!
8866131350|4.0|When I ordered this planner, I expected it to be the same size as the planner I currently used (8&#34;x5&#34; approximately -- I'm just guessing here). No dimensions were listed on the Amazon.com page, but the labeling was the same as the one I used, and I hadn't been able to find the planner in a brick-and-mortar store, so I ordered it.<br /><br />Imagine my surprise when this tiny, pocket-sized planner arrived. I meant to return it immediately, but considering the circumstances -- no other planner formats that I've liked as much as this one, and the fact that the planner (regardless of size) was not available in the stores in my area -- I decided to keep it.<br /><br />I really like having a note page that accompanies each week's worth of calendar. As a writer and editor, with other duties beside, I enjoy having flexibility to annotate and make lists directly across the page from the dates on which those lists are required. Although I'll have to write smaller in this year's planner, it'll still be useful, and I don't regret purchasing it. I just hope that -- for the sake of future customers -- the dimensions are listed by the time I post this review.
1741798981|4.0|I've had the best luck with Lonely Planet guides for many places I've traveled. I like their neighborhood-centric layout where you can open one section to look at all the restaurants, museums, etc. in one neighborhood - say, Kensington/Hyde Park, for example. I prefer that over other guidebooks that present one huge section about museums, another huge section for restaurants, etc. That's too overwhelming for a city as big as London!<br /><br />My only gripe with this book is that the \\"sleep\\" section (for hotels) is separate from all the other neighborhood sections in the book. They DO break it down into neighborhood, but if you'll just be staying in one area, it's a pain to constantly flip between that neighborhood's section and it's subsction in the \\"sleep\\" part of the guidebook.<br /><br />This guidebook comes with a map stuck into the back of the book that you can take out and bring with you - very useful! There are also color-coded sections that you can see easily as you flip through the book: RED is for planning your trip, BLUE is for neighborhood-specific sections, and GREEN is for cultural information about London: history, culture, etc. GRAY is for important information about getting around, making phone calls, money, and other logistics that you'll need to know about when you arrive.
B000FVQLQQ|5.0|My granddaughter had to do a report on this movie. And I wasn't able to find it any where else.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I absolutely love this game. You really have to work hard to achieve three stars in each game. A very challenging form of entertainment.
B003ELKNH2|4.0|My friend really loves this movie it is his favorite of all movies. And he has seen it several times.
B0070YDOT8|4.0|I just installed Big Fish Casino. Game hesitates a lot and the profile picture does keeps changing. There does not seem to be way to save the profile picture to a permanent state.
B000VIK8D0|4.0|I like westerns and this one was recommended by a friend. Enjoyed  all the actors in this great movie. Go
B003XQM2YU|3.0|Reminds me of Jaws...first half of film feels long, complicated and despite gory battle scenes that were not meaningful, boring. In the second half, the movie gets down to the story and I enjoyed it. When will directors be more interested in STORY than in how much they can throw to the FX group?
B002XTBE6K|5.0|I have watched this mulitple TV version of Emma multiple times and throughly enjoy it. Would recommend to anyone who enjoy historical romances.
B008476HBM|5.0|As a classic, it can be read and then reread, finding new ways to apply its' story to ones own life
B008MG1E4A|5.0|It is always good to get the true facts about important current events instead of the doctored ones that the administration wants us to have.  Thank you for your service Mark we appreciate it.
B007EECSFA|5.0|Highly recommend this book for your book club. This is the book my book club will discuss this month and can't wait to see when/if the readers figured out the plot!
B009VB97EY|3.0|What I would call a B rated movie, it was ok and passed the time. Not really a thought provoker and not really great if porn is your goal. Difficult to watch with  a mixed group ..  thus the low rating.
B004T5K3OK|5.0|As a consultant, I need to keep track of my receipts. This app does a great job of eliminating the need to use a scanner. Very easy to scan in a receipt and automatically upload to my client's folder on dropbox before I have a chance to lose it. Not perfect but the best bargain out there by far and my most valuable business app beyond a doubt.
B0002HYC8C|5.0|I bought this for my Noah's ark unit for my SS class, and it did not dissapoint..it really reinforced the lesson for the children, and they played with it for several weeks before they got tired of it. The artistry is good, and the items are ALL very durable....however, the assembly directions do NOT come in English, so be prepared to follow the pictures!!!
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|This Christmas movie is a must have for anyone who loves Christmas.  The story line is something we all need to have applied in our lives.  The movie graphics are awesome.  My kids love  this movie and so do the adults.  Tom Hanks is awesome for producing this movie.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I was intrigued by this book, especially with the surprise ending.  It was interesting to find out so much about how the mind works.
B000QI2ZWW|5.0|My grand children just adore this movie.  They watch it over and over again.  Good clean movie.  A mist have.
B006TF6WAM|4.0|An engaging novel that reveals the obession of a man that has grown tired of his marriage and feels it his duty to seek a link with his past by means that most readers would consider to be insane.
B0090P98Z4|5.0|its awesome and the controls are easy to handle wkdkffm dkdkfkfk dmrmdkfkfm dkfftvk. fmffkfm fmfgmgm mfgkgmv fmfmvmvm gkfkfkgmm gkgkkgvk fkkggmgkgk gmgmggmg fmmfmdmfng
B0052AC8C6|5.0|We love this refreshing time of laughter...My nephew and I stayed up enjoying this story line which has a very ethical message to it for all ages. We will watch this one again.<br />Thanks to all those who made this a very special success.
B008QE9XD2|3.0|HOW HOW HOW is this a PG-13??? I compare it to other Johnny Depp movies like Pirates which are also PG-13. PG-13 movies should NOT include scenes where a woman goes below the camera in front of a man, obviously giving him oral.  I'm VERY surprised that this is in the Kids & Family section of Amazon movies. Be warned!
B00457WZEI|5.0|Would recommend this to teens and adults who love to read good books.  Wonderful book from the horses viewpoint and personalities of people combined with warmth and love.
B0092MKFIY|5.0|I was introduced to Imagine Dragons by a friend who knew that I liked Mumford and Sons, One Republic, and the Killers. The combination of these styles are harmoniously gathered into a melodious combination. The rolling drums and amazing vocals by lead singer Dan Reynolds contribute to the harmony of the entire album. I cannot wait to see what else this up-and-coming band has to offer. They truly are, well, Radioactive.
B0017TFLBQ|5.0|I HAVE loved having this game again and have been playing way too much!!!  I think it is fun, pretty simple to play, yet has lots of good strategy and each castle you get is a little different as with each scenario.
B008A1NKTO|5.0|this  movie is  awesome the true heroes that defend the country as a former marine  i salute them all  as well civilian and  Paramedic, fire dept  as well as civilian , and  military Medic who also  are heroes in fighting  disease, crime, etc in this world  we all  must unite  to make  not our country better but our own  home town neighbor .
B001RHPJBU|5.0|Everything I like about Phil Collins.<br />The music is great; very upbeat and entertaining.<br />I would highly recommend to everyone.
B0069UP2PI|5.0|the  movie is  really cool about  outbreak  of the dangerous  Virus is like  a wake up anything  can occur in real life
B0052OSTOS|5.0|I got this app to help with my anxiety and it worked like it said. It is a very relaxing meditation to listen to. When my anxiety was severe I would listen and meditate every morning and also when I was having an anxiety attack. It helped cure my anxiety and I no longer have issues. I highly recommend it as it does work and it helps you deal with your anxiety.
0446343129|5.0|Sugar Blues, is a must read!  If you think cigarettes are habit forming, read Sugar Blues, it's a history lesson you'll never forget, it's an awaking as to why diabetes runs rampant through our communities,especially the Black communities and now it's affecting the children, our most precious natural resource.  If we continue to stay uneducated to the fact that sugar  is in everything, and it is in fact a drug, that  no one wants to talk about, why, because we are all destine to be addicted to the legal drugs, insulin,etc. And if we are not careful, it will be only given to the selected few, and who might that be? Those who can afford it.  Understand that we are being fed sugar from the cradle to the grave. This story is  fact based, and an over all an overwhelming experience if you are interested in the truth.  If you never do anything before leaving this earth read, and please read Sugar Blues, it will and can help to save our lives and the children and all after them!  Peace and Blessings, Sugar Blues was money well spent!
0393088731|5.0|This book definitely deserves 5 stars! It is Irvine Welsh at his best. This book is absolutely on par with Trainspotting - the language, the amazing characters, the humour. I mainly read while commuting on the metro as I don't have time during the day, and fellow commuters look at me strangely when I often burst out laughing while reading - it's that good. I even cried twice. Irvine Welsh is by far my very favourite author, I have every one of his books and if you are a fan like me, you will fall in love with this book!
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|if you like action movies this is your movie . we just loved it . . My grandkids want to watch it in 3d every time they come over
B009NQKPUW|5.0|One of the best films to come from the Alien world in years and a return of the original Alien director, Ridley Scott.  The movie has excellent 3D cinematography, concept and direction.  Best for those that follow the first Alien movie but written as a new science fiction story that stands on its own.  I hope they follow through with a next chapter and stick with Ridley Scott's direction.
B003TXSF5C|5.0|One of the most eye-opening books someone will ever read. Informative, and spell binding. Hawking does a great job at explaining.
B0097GVJWQ|4.0|kept me going for 2 days and didnt want to put it down. would recommend to anyone who likes hidden object game with a mystery twist.
B000FCK8ZK|5.0|If you are looking to read the novels to see how it compares to the show.....be prepared. It's completely different. All the characters are different, and the way the story goes. But it is a good read!
B009IQ0TGM|5.0|Ellie Goulding has the kind of voice that can't be adequately described.  This latest album is a real treat.  It's moodiness is what makes it great.  Highly recommended.
B00785P2QC|3.0|While a fun game, the numbers of goals centered around Facebook posting is TEDIOUS!  It would be great if those goals could be skipped and removed from the goal list.
B00002N9ER|5.0|It works as described.  I used one hook in my truck and one in my house.  Was able to use this as two mounts instead of one!
B00377Z0Y4|4.0|I have always been impressed by Ian Andersons' work, but I don't think you need to be a Tull fan to appreciate the Christmas Album!  It definitely has the flavor of Jethro Tull, but in a nice Christmassy way.  There are some traditional songs mixed in with some of the groups own works.  I was pleasantly surprised and glad that I made this an addition to my collection.
B0042UEU8M|2.0|While this movie did entertain me, it did not entertain me in the way I expected.  Charlie St. Cloud is just plain bad, but at least I was able to get a good laugh out of it.  Though lazy writing largely characterizes this movie, the lack of flow was just as bothersome.  I don't blame the actors too much for the awkwardness, but it was in fact overacted, over-dramatized, and the lack of chemistry between the two leads distrated me from what might have been an OK plot.  On top of that, this movie was packed with cliques.  Far too many for me to stomach.  Had to laugh or roll my eyes.  Chose to laugh instead.
B009329ZF2|5.0|A great movie for the entire family.I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes action movies. Enjoyed the movie.
B0038BBA4I|4.0|Purchased this album for my kindle after hearing this group on the coffee shop station on Sirrius. There isn't a track that I would skip. Nice mix of music. Will be purchasing other Mumford and Sons offerings.
B000I9VOO4|5.0|This movie is a fitting tribute to a terrific novel.  Both of them are outstanding.  Gregory Peck IS Atticus Finch!  Everyone, get the book, get the movie, and be moved by both!
B008XG1X18|4.0|pinterest is designed to inspire - it does exactly that. very fun &amp; easy to use, I can find all sorts of ideas on here.
044024630X|5.0|This book was purchased as a gift for a friend who does a lot of reading. He enjoyed the book very much.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|Movies speak for themselves. The packaging and bonus features both make this one of the finest special editions I've ever owned. Got it for $20 around Thanksgiving, but this is easily worth double that. There's simply nothing missing here.
B00448VST6|5.0|Live, you gotta see them live, tcad that is, love scott pilgrim books and this movie is wonderful adaptation of a wonderful comic series

B008HTQ28K|5.0|John Grisham is a writer whose books I look forward to...unlike with some other authors, successive books haven't disappointed or failed to meet my eager expectations. The plots are reasoned, the characters believable, credible and not too larger than life, and the the situations real or near-real. And his characters don't speak 'the written word' or spout long winded sentences...they are closer to life than many in modern thrillers, and the fact that there are new protagonists in every book ensure that the characters don't read their own headlines.<br /><br />'The Racketeer' is a good buy, especially if you bought it on Kindle like I did. The plot is different, and keeps you guessing right through to the end, even though the main player's final triumph is a kind of foregone conclusion. There are some pretty interesting twists, and some threads come together at the end or close to it, like they should. It's fast paced and shifts gears often, which was another reason I read it through in quick time. The changes in narrative style and tense between the first person narrative scenes featuring our main player, and the others bothered me initially, but I got over it soon as well. In any case, present continuous is a John Grisham hallmark.<br /><br />In sum, a good read from a great author. I read it through on 3 different devices in every moment of free time I could snatch, and enjoyed every page of it. My only regret is that I've finished it and now need to wait for his next book
0312330537|5.0|This outstanding novel is about love, loss, prison, crime, and war.  Within the first chapter, I knew I was in for a special ride.  Best book I have read in decades.  Painted with descriptive words, you experience places you would never venture.  Roberts transforms you to the midst of the scene; you take in all senses of the location.  Always magical.  Coupled with characters you fall in love with yourself, the end result is an intimate journey with the author.<br /><br />Upon noting how fantastic (and long) this book was, I made a decision to read the book very slowly.  I have read copious books, etc. in the meantime.  I only read about 20 pages of Shantaram at one reading -if I was disciplined.  I didn't want it to end!!!  I have felt that way about many a book, but never before have I purposefully taken my time.  It is such a treasure.  I let it last a year.  I mourn its' completion.
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|Kids and husband like the game a lot.  They like the gravity well around planets and the light sabre, especially.
B0086700CM|5.0|It's fun until you die &gt;:U.But when you get far and earn more coins it gets better to play.Good luck ;O
B0077ZNCE2|2.0|Not a very good movie; acting is poor, lacks action.  I was a big fan of the books, and this movie is disappointing.
B004WGIXX4|1.0|I was embarrassed to see Kevin Klein in this movie, participating in the propaganda myth that people are old at 58. For god's sake, I am 57 and know well what a f*** buddy is! My generation may have even invented the term. I would love to be able to watch a comedy that does not mention fingering or eating someone out in the first 12 minutes. I thought that was reserved for trash like \\"Porky's Revenge\\". The tradition and appeal of a good romantic comedy is its innocence, which happens with great infrequency in this film as a result of the occasional vulgarity which has sadly become part of our mainstream culture. \\"That hole is my b****\\", bellows Portman in a miniature golf scene. How sad to see what we have become. A show like \\"Sex in the City\\" would have dealt with this topic, which is a great premise, with far more class and humor.
B000VRWRMQ|5.0|I was a huge Ace fan back in &#34;the day&#34; and I had the album when it came out.  I was glad to pick it up at a good price so I can listen and go back to those days.  I like Ace's most recent album/cd &#34;Anomaly&#34;, too.  But this is Ace how I remember him the most.
B0040QYROK|5.0|Metropolis is, of course, a magnificent silent movie that repays repeated viewings. Although the primary theme--the heart, hands, head epigraph--is banal and simplistic, there are other themes that merit one's attention. I think two of the most important are, first, the fact that Rotwang, the &#34;Inventor&#34; and ostensible scientist, is really dealing with the occult--not science--and he is the villain, while Joh Fredersen, the &#34;Head&#34; of Metropolis, is the one who represents science, engineering, and modernity. But these ideas are somewhat ambiguous, muddled, and understated in the movie. The second theme is that Metropolis is presented as a dystopia, but why does it have to be with machines doing most of the work? Technology has historically liberated humans, not subordinated them as depicted in this film. By far the most amazing characters are Maria and Robot Maria, both wonderfully performed by Brigitte Helm, who quite justifiably became a star with her acting in Metropolis. Robot Maria takes on several different guises, including the Whore of Babylon, before being burned at the stake as a witch! The Art Deco architecture and interior design elements throughout the film are beautifully rendered. Even Robot Maria in robot form is Deco, built in an elaborate scientific laboratory within a quaint rural German house and revealed sitting under an occult pentagram, which makes her the most intriguing robot ever built. Unfortunately, Robot Maria is little used in robot form in the movie, but in human form as the false-Maria she is a major character, as is, of course, truly human-Maria, the heroine of the movie.  My problem is that so many of the reviews don't belong here and this is entirely Amazon's fault for mixing them in (this is a problem with many other Amazon reviews of famous cinematic masterpieces that have gone through successive restorations; smart reviewers update their older reviews with a dated note). The item listed here is the KINO Blu-ray version of the 2010 reconstruction, but most of the reviews are quite a bit older. So many of the reviews here refer to the older 2001 restoration and even several others, such as the absurd Moroder &#34;restoration.&#34; All of these older ones are based on material largely from the heavily cut and edited Pollack-Paramount 90-minute version of late 1927 which completely destroyed the correct story of the film so that it made no sense at all. Even the excellently-restored 2001 version, which makes up 83% of the 2010 version, lacks so many important shots and scenes that the story is confusing although at least all the outstanding design and cinema innovations are present. Really, Amazon, all pre-2010 reviews should be removed from this item or distinguished by more than their date. This is just a confusing and shameful situation.  The original early 1927 Fritz Lang Metropolis was 153 minutes long, the excellent but incomplete 2001 restoration is 123 minutes long, and the nearly complete 2010 restoration is 148 minutes long (the same length as the 16mm Argentine copy). So only 5 minutes are missing. These must have either been removed by Argentine censorship after the original 35mm print was purchased in Berlin and taken to Argentina, or the print got caught in the projector at some point and a damaged segment was removed, since we must assume that the original print sent to Argentina was the complete 153-minute version. Apparently some of the missing 5 minutes dealt with sexual content, so I suspect censorship. As is well known, 123 minutes could be reconstructed from archived remaining original 35mm negatives and prints retrieved from various sources, while the essential long-missing 25 minutes came from the 16mm copy of the 1927 Argentine 35mm original print that was deliberately destroyed (!) in the early 1970s (!) by an Argentine film conservation (!) organization after the 16mm copy was made to substitute a chemically stable medium for the cellulose nitrate original (why not store the only original copy of this masterpiece left in the world in a fireproof vault). The archived remaining 35mm segments had frames large enough for digital techniques to remove all the scratches, light variations, and other artifacts so that the 123 minutes from this source look pristine in Blu-ray HD. Unfortunately, the 25 minutes of material retrieved from the 16mm copy was so bad (the Argentine 35mm original print was thoroughly scratched from repeated projections, the transfer to 16mm was performed incompetently and too quickly, and the frames were so small), that even the most advanced digital techniques could not completely clean it up, so it looks greatly inferior compared to the 123-minute high-quality portion into which it is necessarily spliced to create the 148-minute 2010 restoration. But, in the end, we must truly be thankful to finally have an almost complete digital restoration of this cinematic masterpiece. Buy the Blu-ray 2010 version even if you have earlier versions--you will not regret it.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|&#34;Proof of Heaven&#34; by Eben Alexander, III<br />Excellent Book.  I consider it a must read for anyone seeking to have a better understanding of our afterlife.
B008JAGZDE|3.0|It is what it is - don't expect more  A continuation of the previous mildly entertaining nonsense, but worth spending $4
B0081KTI0E|3.0|I enjoyed the movie but not as much as I had hoped.  Slow in many places and very dark to watch.
B005EGXNLS|5.0|You gotta love Utred, the main man in the story.  His life, his loves, his courage and dedication keep you engaged.
B009329ZF2|4.0|While it had its juvenile parts and in some places it was a lot like Transformers I still liked the movie overall.  I hope to put it in my home movie collection.
B004GJDQT8|5.0|Great to shop while you are on the road or away from home. Saves me a lot of money when comparison shopping.
B0098VYCCE|3.0|Definitely a new approach to Snow White.  I am not a Kristen Stewart fan of any kind but she did a fair job of acting.  Another movie that had a dark plot in my opinion.
0316227706|5.0|Bought several of these books as gifts and I know everyone is going to love them! Such a cool idea for a book.
B008EQIEWS|3.0|It was enjoyable from a purely entertainment viewpoint.  The acting was mediocre at best.  Would I recommend it, possibly.  It had its stupid parts for sure.
B000FCKBCU|4.0|Ordered this book because it was selected for book club. I am an avid reader and tend to enjoy light &#34;fluffy&#34; reads lately because I chase 2 under 2 all day (and night) and have little attention for anything too deep or detailed.  This story did not disappoint. It was a very quick read, I finished in just an afternoon. It was fun and feel good with some relevant themes. I even found it relatively well written in comparison to some chick lit.  My only criticisms would be that it was a little too quick of a read and by the time book club rolled around I had forgotten a bit and had to refresh.
B0098VYCCE|1.0|So bad...truly awful..would it have gotten better? Maybe but i was regretting the 30 minutes i wasted..the trailer was pretty good so i was disappointed that the movie did not live up to that....
B0091REZMW|5.0|this game is addicting you should get it for hours of fun<br />I never wanna get off of it. my family is addicted to it
B000050HTO|5.0|There is a definite difference in the voice and maybe even a bit of an idealist in his writings but it is pure Dylan.  What a great musician he is and how fortunate we are in being able to hear his messages and those incredible tunes.  He is absolutely brilliant!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I love this game. I play it all the time. the part I don't like about this game is the gutters on the sides because they things your wasting your coins on that you want goes in the gutters and does not come back then you run out of coins get this app but grrrrrrrrrrr . :)
B002DKGWSE|5.0|This was actually pretty good.  Another one of those &#34;this could happen to you&#34; type movies.  It kept our attention and we have watched it several more times.  I do not think anyone who likes this type of movie would be disappointed in this purchase.
B004GFN11A|5.0|And it's fast! I would much rather type and blog on my laptop but when I am out and about, this app helps a lot! It's easy to use and has the same features as the website on a computer.
B000UJ48SQ|5.0|I saw this at a theater when I was younger and have always remembered it.  It was sad, then happy, and then sad but the story and Ryan O'Neal's performance were outstanding.  The wardrobe and costumes were beautiful and may have even been recognized with an award if I recall correctly.<br /><br />This is actually a very good movie, but may not be for everyone.
1423140605|5.0|I have the rest of the series and love reading them.The book is great I can't put it down. And its a great read for any age.
B0041KKYCY|5.0|This was excellent.  When we purchased this DVD we thought it was just another horror type show to watch when there was nothing on television.  Whatever our reason for the purchase, I am glad we bought it.  This is a revenge movie and you will find yourself becoming vested in her succeeding in getting revenge.  This is really a good movie and you will recognize many of the characters.  Sarah Butler plays a perfect role.<br /><br />You will not regret this purchase.
B005KCTQSK|5.0|We've been starved these past few years, this young talent<br />brings quality to those of us that love music. Thank you for existing.
B005F9TQ2Y|5.0|If you are a Dylan fan, this is a must have.  I would suggest anyone reviewing this CD...buy it. He is brilliant!
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Sorry to see the series end but an amazing read!! Game of thrones is one of the best books I've read
B0000AC8LR|5.0|I have nothing to say except I just wanted to own this movie.  Who has not seen or at the very least heard of the movie Donnie Darko.  This will definitely end up a cult classic.  I am glad to have purchased it.
0525952926|2.0|I agree with all who wrote that the second volume of the trilogy does not measure up to the first one.  The writing syle is very different : short, clipped sentences; conversational tone;  shallow characters;  adolescent sex scenes;  improbable plots at times.  The historical perspective that filled the first volume is lost in cheesy romance novel  dialogs. I'm 3/4 thru the book and keep hoping that it will improve.<br />Was Follett working on the 3rd volume while someone else wrote the second one?
B00003CXZ4|5.0|This is a really strange movie that will definitely keep your interest.  To have no memory of 5 seconds ago and then no memory of the next 5 seconds ago but to know you have no memory of the past seconds, hours, weeks, months and years.  How better to document your moves than memos. . .<br /><br />This is a very well written movie and after seeing it on cable, I had to have it so I could watch it whenever I wanted.  Everytime I do watch it I see something I didn't see the last time.  Possibly I too am starting to lose the memory of 5 seconds ago!
B009ZAY8MM|5.0|Incredible music, worth every penny and much, much more. Perfect addition to your christmas playlist. Check out PTX Vol. I too
B000063DS1|5.0|Oh My - the Band...one of the greatest groups ever.  What a production this was and if you were not fortunate enough to have been in the audience, you will have to settle for the DVD's and CD's as I have.  Joni Mitchell, Van Morrison, Dylan, Neil Young, the best of the best came to join the band for what was their final showing...their Last Waltz.  As I write this review I can hear the Last Waltz playing in my head.  Can you imagine all of the great artists of this era, the cream of the crop, none better. . . all came to be part of this finale.<br /><br />This is a classic worth owning.  Watching it will give you chills.  This is definitely a 5-Star performance.  BUY IT NOW.
B009VB7QQA|3.0|The effects are good but just watching Abe as a vampire hunter is hard to believe and detracts from the movie.  I know, it's just a movie...but maybe a character other than Abe might have fit better.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Reacher series is always a good read. Very enjoyable.  On the lookout  for the next one in this fine series

B008XG1X18|4.0|Although I am still learning how to use this app, what I have learned has made me pleased with what the app can do!
B009WO7NQO|5.0|I love this game, I am a Star Wars fan, from seeing it as a kid, to being super excited for the next installment which I know Disney will do it justice, to say the least. Anyway I love the characters in this game and how their abilities mirror the movie.<br />if you're a fan you already have it, if you're thinking about getting it why wait.
B005LAIGN2|3.0|The acting in this movie was fair, although a little too over dramatic to serve it's message.<br /><br />There were many more facets of the plot that were unfortunately left unexplored. The overall tone of the movie, was a very unflattering depiction of virtually all of the other armed service personnel as being openly racist, until later won by the integrity and valor of the core cast. It really was just one scene after another of how cruel, unsporting and how dismissive white people can be towards men of color.<br /><br />I admire the dignity and respect the plight of the men depicted in the film, of course. However, this is basically a film that flatly attempts to illustrate once again, that people of color will triumph simply because they are people of color.
B009YU62H2|5.0|Knights of the Soundtable ride again! The only downfall... less live shows from Pearl Jam. King Animal ROCKS. My wife has been begging me to take off repeat! Orpheum Theatre 1/20/2013 should be LOUD!!!
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|The Dark Knight has the best possible actors for all of its characters. Action packed, creepy, funny and all around entertaining.<br /><br />Most people consider this the best Batman movie. I agree.
B00A12Z264|5.0|I love this CD - it showcases more of her vocal ability & nice variation in music - true Christina fashion.  Very talented young woman.
B0068FYZIO|5.0|Filmed in black and white, this is a very harsh true-to-life depiction of compassion and love despite the realities of hatred and genocide during the second world war.<br /><br />As a beacon of hope to the Jewish people, Schindler, a shrewd German business man began to create a safe haven to hundreds of Jews being persecuted by the NAZI war machine. He cleverly created jobs in his factory to be filled exclusively by what were deemed as &#34;essential&#34; Jewish workers. This effectively saved them from the awful fate of the Concentration camps, or simply being murdered on the spot by NAZI soldiers.<br /><br />Artfully acted and directed. Both heartbreaking and uplifting, a story like no other.
B006OAB2XO|5.0|I first discovered Grimes while shopping.  It was on the stores in house music.  I ordered the album and have fallen in love with it.  It has a retro 80's feel with an amazing and modern production.  Love it!
B0049P1VHS|5.0|Die  hard fan of The Walking Dead ,This is one  t.v. series  that I hope  last for  along time .
B004YM6JLO|5.0|I love this show! The actors and actresses are so talented, and the storyline is intriguing! I watch as often as possible.
B00A6N8F4Y|1.0|Nothing redeeming about this movie. Incredibly self-important, bad cinematography, convoluted plot. The whole movie just seemed to exist to give Selma Hayek a job.
B007OV9EYG|4.0|Though some creative liberties were obviously taken in the screen adaptation of this tale (how else could you turn an illustrated children's book into a 90 minute film?), I think that what's important is that the spirit of Dr. Seuss' original vision is preserved. Some aspects are translated downright marvelously, such as the whimsical trees, the goofy fish, and the cuddly bear folk. They are brought to life in a weird, wonderful world that I imagine Dr. Seuss would be proud of. Though the aspect of colors and vividness cannot rival the splendor of \\"Rio\\" and \\"Finding Nemo\\" (the kings of color, when it comes to animated films, IMO), \\"The Lorax\\" nonetheless manages to be quite impressive at times (my favorite scene was the \\"nontraditional\\" white water rafting). It's definitely worth watching on Blu-ray, as opposed to DVD (as are almost all animated films), in order to get the most out of its color spectrum and attention to detail.<br /><br />As for the story itself, \\"The Lorax\\" tells a serviceable tale that is held aloft by the superb voice acting of Ed Helms, who makes up for the less than pleasant contributions of Danny DeVito and Betty White (fine actors, but a rather annoying, cliche-riddled duo for an animated picture). The larger message of environmental conservation has its heart in the right place, although its absurdity (focusing on the renewable resource of trees rather than the limited resource of oil) must be overlooked. But, hey- if you're watching a movie based on a story by Dr. Seuss, starring a mustachioed critter as odd looking as the Lorax, then you should already be prepared to suspend your disbelief!
0307716988|5.0|I have been a Michael Jackson fan since I was five years old, He is the greatesr artist that ever walked the earth. I loved this book because He tells about how he made it in this crucial business and it shows how coultured he was and his love for mankind and all kinds of music. Every Michael Jackson fan should have this autiobiography.
B002BI6SMI|4.0|This is a really good movie and I ordered it for a christmas present for my 18 year old son who loves this movie and we enjoy it as a family every time we have watched it.
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|This movie is a wonderful family movie,one of my favorites, but the 3d was awesome. It added so much to the whole movie, we loved it.
B008SVS3FC|4.0|Another great disc from a master musical story-teller.  If you're a John Hiatt fan, add this to your library.  If you're not a fan, give it a listen and you will be!
B004L03B3S|5.0|This movie is absolutely one of the finest films I have watched in a very long time. Though the subject matter is \\"taboo\\" this film does it with such class and style, that it just seems natural that these two \\"Brothers\\" were destined from birth to be \\"together\\". This is NOT a pornographic movie... it is a true \\"Love Story\\" in the most wonderful of ways.<br />I was completely taken by it and enjoyed it. You will too!<br />Love like this, should never, ever be denied.<br />Buy this movie... you'll want it in your collection! I know I am glad I did!
B007MU85D0|5.0|Every song speaks to the soul.  Consistently good.  I can't gush over this band enough.  Be prepared to weep and shout for joy, sometimes during the same song...
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is a fun game to entertain. My friend had this game on her touch so I got it on my kindle fire. It is amazing.
B000JQU4TW|5.0|Oscar Wilde lives up to his name.  This classic takes the reader on a wild ride into the impossible, the creepy, and the fascinating.  You won't regret reading it, but you might have a bad taste in your mouth about your own sins afterward...
B001FB4VXU|5.0|Love this tv show.  Can not wait to add more seasons to complete my collection. Received it in wonderful condition.
B002PLALCO|4.0|I am so glad they make clean versions for DVD's  I really like Pink but I don't like buying DVD's with explicit lyrics.  I liked this DVD.
B008CP6RWU|3.0|When I fist started playing it, I was almost hypnotized by the game's stunning visuals and awesome music. After a few minutes, though, I found myself doing barely more than just walking around.
B003XRELGQ|5.0|Not for the conventional mind. I found it a brilliant escape from reality. Very exotic. A memorable book worth revisiting.
B007L24T52|5.0|This is an e excellent book, the plot is very very good and believable, it all comes together very well
B009KHBDUU|3.0|I thought overall it was pretty good.  Depp generally comes through.  However, some of the subtleties of the humor required some prior awareness of the soap opera series.  It is good without it, but since I had watched some of this soap in the 60's, I think some of the humor was very clever in synching this movie with the series.<br /><br />Worth a look, particularly if you are a Johnny Depp fan.
B0063IH60K|3.0|Tablet didn't have Solitair installed and this was the first one I found.  Not as good as Windows 7 Solitair; however, I enjoyed playing it on my tablet.
B004UXUUDA|3.0|I am bit disappointed. I actually thought I had ordered the movie & not the sound track . At best, the sound tract was not what I It was I anticipated for it's musical track. Not sure I recommend.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Different take, though gets predictable towards the middle. Scifi thriller...which should make for a decent movie. Hope to read more from the author.
B009CPEOC4|4.0|This is more of a documentary than a movie..but in my opinion, it was awesome. I love Katy Perry and it was fun to be part of her back stage crew. It shows just how much effort goes into each show Katy preforms. You will come away loving Katy even more after seeing this...:)
B0024SQW2Q|5.0|I really enjoy all of these stories.<br />I gave this movie 5 stars because I this it was all well done.
B000V1Z8KK|4.0|I can relate to the Gunny in the picture. Great movie & storyline. I and others were asked to do something similar for our government & some of us were prosecuted for doing it. I understand & wish I could settle the Washington DC problem the way he did. I have some of the same or similar skills.
B007PS0X0W|5.0|This was an exciting movie with a cool story.<br />I picked 5 stars for this movie because It was amazing I think this was the nicest looking Underworld when it come to graphics.
B009VB97EY|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie :) and channing tatum did a great job and there were many great actors in the movie as well
B009FZHYKU|5.0|My boyfriend and I love this. Show is amazing! I love that Amazon has it.  Can't wait for more! GREAT!!!
B004PV293G|5.0|If you liked Teaser, then you must get this Deluxe version as well. It's got noticeably extended licks on Wild Dogs/Lotus, and also many of the other songs. Definitely different from just Teaser.
B004HW7JMY|5.0|Just a great purchase. The sale was very secure, fast and I already saw all the season, I love this serie
B00992CF6W|4.0|its a good game but there are so many things that should be in it that arent,  but overall its a good game
B003UBTX7C|5.0|Oliver Stone keeps young forever - and Baldacci makes it seem like a news report.  The black cloud that follows the club around is not as dark in this book as it has been in others, but still keeps you wanting to cheer them on..  I cannot wait for the next in the series.
0307595579|5.0|Bought it as a Christmas gift.  I'm sure the recipient will love reading the trilogy as much as I did.
0316228532|5.0|Okay, so...okay.<br />I know this has been stated time and time again, but I feel the need to reiterate it. This book is not Harry Potter. There are no happy endings here, so if you're looking for a book that will bring you joy and a sense of happiness and completion, look elsewhere. The Casual Vacancy is not that book.<br />It's an uncomfortable book to read. At first, the discomfort comes from hearing JK Rowling's distinctive voice in your head, narrating the foulest language and the dirtiest, most vile thoughts you can imagine. It's a bit like hearing a five-year-old read aloud from Fifty Shades. But as you go deeper, the discomfort comes from how Rowling gets inside the heads of the characters, in a way that reaches inside you and puts its finger on the parts of yourself you're most ashamed of.<br />I'm incredibly impressed by that last part. The cast of The Casual Vacancy is immensely diverse, and yet Rowling seems to know them as intimately as she knows herself. She pulls no punches, and that's why it works. If she'd tried to soften it the smallest bit, the book would have failed miserably. But because Rowling was unflinchingly, tragically honest...it succeeded brilliantly.
B0052AC8C6|5.0|I didn't really expect much out of Rango. I just watched it because Amazon was pushing it and it had such a high rating. But it was sooo good. The animation was the best I have ever seen. Best in the sense of the detail of the characters. You know how in almost all animation and most movies, you never feel the extras or even minor characters have lives when they are not onscreen. I felt the characters in Rango did. There was soo much detail, both in characterization but also visually, down to the texture of their skin, as much as, more than in HD movies of real people. Each character seemed fully realized.<br /><br />The plot was unsurprising but the characters and animation carry it along. It got a little slow in the middle but then picks up again and runs pretty fast to end.<br /><br />I also felt that the inspiration was the fairy tale of the Valiant Tailor who killed seven flies with one blow, made himself a sash that said \\"Seven at One Blow\\" and became a hero based on his lie, just as Rango (I don't remember if we ever learn his real name) becomes a hero based on his lie that he killed 7 with one bullet. Just as the tailor tricks two giants into fighting, so Rango tricks his two enemies into fighting.<br /><br />The bankrobbing, bat riding bandits were so great I wanted them to be on Rango's side. Their scene was as exciting as any action scene in, say, Indiana Jones.<br /><br />Depp was great as Rango. You can see the patterning of his action in Rango's animation. Which, again, was fantastic.
B009MO5G90|5.0|The 3D version of this movie rocks.  It really heightens the visual experience, enjoyed it much more than the traditional 2D version.
B005H9B44A|4.0|Spoilers<br /><br />It was a comic book of a movie but pretty enjoyable. If anything there was too much action and not enough interaction. The motivations of many of the characters were never quite clear to me. Thor's change of character after spending, what, a day or two as human, was not believable, nor was his love for Jane. If they had left him mortal, say for a year or two, I might have bought it, but not such a brief time. But the action sequences mostly carry the picture as does the sound. It was all CGI but I can't make myself not like it, even though a bit of it annoyed me. Like the destruction of the Bifröst Bridge. If this is a society with such high technology that it seems like magic, they seemed to fallen into a decadent period because they cannot repair the technology their ancestors built. That is what comes of having kings.
B0086700CM|5.0|This is 1 of my favorite games.My friends and I love this game so much. SO IF YOU LIKE ADVENTURES GET THIS GAME.You can get things to help you get a bigger high score.<br />  From Emma
B000SEGUDE|1.0|I had high expectations of Cloud Atlas based upon reviews.  I was so bored I deleted it from my Kindle after a few pages. A waste of time and money.
B002KDSBGA|5.0|I love the movie - great story - well done - suspenseful and heart felt.  But Amazon streaming is not the best way to go.  Every time we try it, the movies cut out at least once.  Not sure what the gig is as we don't have the same problem with comcast...but don't think we'll try through amazon again for a time...unless we hear improvements have been made.
0316187216|3.0|First off, I need to say I'd pretty much given up on contemporary fantasy until I chanced on Mr. Abercrombie's First Law trilogy, and later The Heroes.<br /><br />While Red Country is a solid story and wraps up lots of loose ends - particularly Logan Nine-Fingers - the novel simply didn't do it for me. The writing didn't have the mad gleam those other books had, as if it were rushed or written out of obligation rather than inspiration. The characters came off as flat, the battles, bloody but predictable, the themes vaguely depressing.<br /><br />Again, my hat's off to the author for re-invigorating the genre, but this isn't his best. Read the Trilogy, or if you prefer a stand-alone, try The Heroes.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|My whole family loves the challenge of this game.  It starts out easy, but gets increasingly difficult.  It is worth the download.
B000HKW7E0|5.0|This is a must see movie every Christmas at our house, along with Christmas Story!  It never gets old.  Giving it as a gift this year!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This game is pretty addicting.  Once you get started, you don't want to stop.  It's fun for the whole family.
B001BR5NN0|5.0|If you grew up in the eighties you have to give this movie 5 stars. It's a classic all-star cast that maybe the modern day youth wouldn't know or appreciate but this movie truly brings back great memories. OH...just watch it!
B000HAB4KS|5.0|One of the greatest movies of all time! Keanu Reeves shows us a different side of himself that will blow your mind. Top special effects and excellent story.
B000YAA68C|5.0|I love this movie and I usually do not like romance movies.  So funny and sweet and Gerard Butler is not bad either!
B001BR5NH6|5.0|Bought this movie for my husband.  The embassy post office called me and told me the envelop had shown up empty due to apparent theft in transit.  I told Amazon what happened and they sent me a new one for free even though it wasn't their fault.  That means a lot to me, even if it is just a cheap movie.  We haven't watched it yet, but who doesn't love Weird Science!?!  Thanks Amazon!!!
B008B1VYP0|5.0|Awesome Album Maroon 5 's Best Album The whole album is good it is their best album by far. I just love it.

B0079TQHDO|3.0|Not Archers best work but still a good read and recommended for something light between others. I enjoyed this book none the less.
B00A6PD9I4|4.0|Great movie with a great story, excellent animation fun for the whole family.  You can usually count on Disney/pixar to produce a an animation film worth watching!
B009HV2JT8|2.0|was ok just expected more, not enough action and story line was a bit off. Glad I did not spend the money at the theatre to see it
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|This game is a lot of fun, I love it. It is very contagious and addicting. I love Mahjong and have some form of it on all my devices
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|Enjoy the simple fun of drawing and guessing pictures with this app.  Goog laughs shared by all that play the game.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This game is very addicting! Fun and Frustrating! Can't put it down until I get all those boxes knocked down!
B007C94QRK|5.0|I've never been a fan of the muppets until I had children. My girls LOVE this movie, they are glued to the television from beginning to end. I don't know why but it works. I watched a few bits here and there and it's also fun for adults.

B005V2EVBQ|5.0|I bought this for my husbands Kindle. I knew he would be tossing it on his tool box and truck. Very durable
B009OA57MI|1.0|This game is stupid I can't even take off without it crashing in the water. And it also shuts off my Kindle Fire randomly.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Love all forms of Mahjong. Very addicting, and great fun. I have trouble putting it down and going to sleep
B007ZJDGXC|4.0|I am a Denzel fan anyway, and liking Ryan more....I bought the digital copy so I have it in my digital library. Action packed and emough story to keep it all connected....:)
B002SR2PKG|5.0|This is the first book that has EVER scared me, and I do not scare easily. I love all of Stephen King older books
B0083GQ2A0|3.0|Okay for a rainy afternoon....kind of disjointed, and the thin backgrounds don't make some character sense, But enough to get you running ahead of the pack....:)
B0000DJZB9|4.0|This is a fun DVD to own if you love GNR, or classic 80's videos. My one complaint is that the, &#34;You Could Be Mine&#34; video is missing!!! I assume it is because they couldn't get the rights due to the video having scenes from Terminator 2. Otherwise it's a nice trip down memory lane.
0062213423|5.0|ANOTHER MUST HAVE FOR PARENTS OF DIRECTIONEERS!!!! My daughter is going to love it and i loved the way it looked in person...great buy.

B0063IH60K|4.0|first time kindle user so this free program was easy to find,download, and play. just some fun time when nothing else is going on.
141694737X|5.0|My granddaughter loves flap books, and she wanted this read over and over.  Simple, creative, animals...board book small for small ones...a hit!
B00A6PD9I4|3.0|Not nearly up to the standard of other recent animated features. Very thin story line and reliance on  repetitive gags.
B001HNE3NO|5.0|This was a well written, interesting plot that leaves you in tears. I loved the two separate stories that eventually conjoin.  Not only was it a well written fiction but some basic history was involved.  I loved every moment.
B0031Q0XCA|5.0|I found this movie to be excellent in depicting two areas of our lives: (1) the conflicts involving vocational choice, and (2) the conflicts that often surround the &#34;sweet mystery&#34; of love. We don't always do what we train to do, and that can create angst (often times in the minds of others). Sometimes, the people for whom we feel deep, abiding love are not the best choice (or even a remotely good choice) for romance. Hard to figure. It happens a lot.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|this is one of the best apps I've ever had. Could be better if it rengenerated coins faster. Is awesome
B009NQKXYK|3.0|Prometheus - The plot was predictable and a little stupid.  The most interesting aspect of the story line was how he tied this movie in the Alien series.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|Great fun and makes you think. Different from Ab and improves problem solving skills for us old people. The kids can crack uber fast.
B009Y2KGSQ|3.0|Long time Aerosmith fan.  Was so looking forward to a new album.  The idea of the LP and the 50s Sci Fi cartoon artwork was ok, if a little hokey.  If this is music from another dimension, I like this dimension better.  The sound quality is lacking in the downloaded version.  The work maintains some Aerosmith traditions with some interesting bits.  But the soul of Aerosmith is missing. Only a couple of songs on this one will get to my Ipod.  Glad they're still around and could give it another try.  Maybe they'll get re-inspired.  But they should leave the duets off unless they warn us it's &#34;Aerosmith et al.&#34;
B008JGSM6G|5.0|this is an amazing puzzle game. and its free so you don't have to pay for it. its very fun
B0085RQLXK|4.0|I saw Music From Another Dimension at Walmart a few weeks ago, but I it didn't pick it up until today during the Black Friday sales for five dollars. The retro B-movie album cover is cool, but covers can be misleading. I made the mistake of reading several bad reviews, so my expectations were low. It seems that fans think the band will crank out hit after hit, but you have to realize that it has been eleven years since their last release. During that amount of time people can change and so can their style of music.<br /><br />For me, Music From Another Dimension! wasn't as bad as I thought it would be. If you are expecting a great rock 'n' roll album similar to their earlier years, you're going to be disappointed. Aerosmith's new release is a mixture of soft rock and light country. There is even a duet with Steven Tyler and Carrie Underwood. Both of them have great vocals and the song is one of the standouts from this release. My favorite songs from are Legendary Child, Street Jesus, Another Last Goodbye and Shakey Ground. Overall, I liked listening to Aerosmith's new incarnation, but I do miss their early years.<br /><br />The complete track list:<br /><br />1. Luv XXX<br />2. Oh Yeah<br />3. Beautiful<br />4. Tell Me<br />5. Go Out the Lights<br />6. Legendary Child<br />7. What Could Have Been Love<br />8. Street Jesus<br />9. Can't Stop Lovin' You (Duet with Carrie Underwood)<br />10. Lover Alot<br />11. We All Fall Down<br />12. Freedom Fighter<br />13. Closer<br />14. Something<br />15. Another Last Goodbye<br />16. Shakey Ground (Exclusive Track)
B009HV2JT8|5.0|this movie was great. The story line was interesting and easy to follow. If you want historical accuracy then you'll be disappointed.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|Disc runs trouble-free for viewing.  Picture and sound quality excellent, rivaling that of the theatrical showing.  Would have preferred to purchase only the 3-D disc at hopefully a lower cost than combo pack containing same content on three different disc formats.  Outer packaging contains gorgeous 3-D artwork.
B009GX6SSK|4.0|The characters continue to develop but I don't think their interaction is well established. They have finally moved away from trying to find out what Hallan's &#34;G&#34; stands for which was a lame story line from the get go. (Now &#34;Castle&#34; and &#34;White Collar&#34; are playing around with the same weak story.)
B0009P5YXO|4.0|Works well. Doesn't weigh much, so I added some extra mass in the casing. As advertised. Handle it gently and it'll treat you well.
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|This was a great movie if you liked Iron man, Thor or Capt America, you will love this. Rent, watch, enjoy.
B009FZHYKU|4.0|I enjoyed how the characters have gotten over their guilt for killing.  They are more aggressive.  I dont like it that Lori has died.  She finally stopped nagging about killing and she dies.  Andrea is acting sooo stupid idolizing the Governor.  C'mon she was a lawyer.  I hate the way she turns so primal easily.  It doesnt match her at all.  Don't like Michon's character.  She's like a teenager acting butchy.  I think Dale's brother should not have shot the kid.  He's character look promising.
B009Z8HPYM|5.0|This album has the patience of maturity, but still with a fresh sound.  It was worth the wait, and expect it to pass the test of time.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|works well with practice. minimal user interface is sometimes hard to figure out. everything is there, but how to bring it on screen? very good, even without root.
B008KW43TE|2.0|I really cant see what all the hype is about with Frank Ocean. This cd was not at all what I expect and to me it really wasnt all that good. Of course they were songs on here that I could listen to over and over but as a whole I really wished I wouldnt have wasted my money.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|Duke Nukem on android, this app reminds me of so many older dos programs I still run on a special unit setup. Haven't had a lot of time to run the app but it looks and runs great....
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love this app as I do love the website. It allows me to spend lots of wasted time pinning. It is awesome.
B009D5VNLS|5.0|and nation. This can be a great story about the history of Scotland. SCOTLAND THE BRAVE-No truer words spoken or sung.
030788743X|5.0|This is a hard novel to review. I've got to confess that I came very close to not making it more than a twenty pages into this book. It's set in a dystopian future, with a disillusioned teenager as the protagonist. And that's where the book hit a huge speedbump, for me at least, with the crapsack world just a little too...crappy and the whiny know-it-all teenager just a little too...whiny. I actually put the book down for a few months, not wanting to slog through anymore of the dismal dystopia and not wanting to listen to protagonist Wade Watts complain about how crappy everything was. (Though, to be fair, he had a point in-universe.)<br /><br />I picked it up again a few months later, determined to give it another shot. I'm very glad I did. With the crapsack world of Ready Player One being so crappy, going online in the super-immersive OASIS system is a big pastime. And once Wade \\"stepped\\" into OASIS and became Parzival (his avatar's name), things really picked up. Call it a case of the author doing his job too well, but reading about life outside of OASIS was a grind, while reading about the virtual reality/game environment was actually fun.<br /><br />To sum up the plot, Wade is a gunter, an online \\"egg hunter\\" searching for the Easter egg hidden in Oasis by James Halliday, the tech genius who created the system. To find the egg, gunters need to know everything about everything geek, game, and pop-culture-related from the 1980s (though there's stuff from the 1970s through the 2000s referenced). As someone born within a few years of the fictional Halliday, and who grew up enjoying a lot of that game and geek culture, this book was tailor-made for me. Kind of. Nostlagia really is the cheapest kind of cheap pop, where the writer doesn't have to work to give the reader an emotional connection, he just alludes to stuff that's been rattling around in your brain for two or three decades. And you know what? It usually works.<br /><br />Also, besides the nostalgia factor, there's some great world-building (literally) inside OASIS. By the time Parzival had gotten really started on his quest (no spoilers here), I was hooked. By the time he was getting close to the midpoint, I was saying, \\"If Cline references Moon Patrol or Rastan, he gets a five-star review.\\" By the time I was finished, I said, \\"Aw hell, he's earned his five stars anyway.\\"<br /><br />What I ended up liking about Ready Player One was that it actually did something fun with all that nostalgia, and through Parzival showed the real joy that Halliday (and Cline) found in all of those games and TV shows. And, like Star Trek TNG: \\"Hollow Pursuits,\\" it's look into how seductive virtual realities can be-the kicker is that, unlike the crapsack dystopia of Ready Player One, Star Trek is set in as pure a utopia as can be imagined (and TNG is the most utopian of all the treks). So be careful reading this book-you might not be able to put it down.there's some great world-building (literally) inside OASIS.

B006FTC6ZC|5.0|totally original, completely entertaining and simply awesome! If your a horror fan, you love this spin on the done to death cliche of todays horror genre! I highly recommend!!!
B001ANSS5K|4.0|This book was one that I surprisingly could not predict. Even when I thought I knew where it was going I didn't. This was my first John Green book and judging from this I will be reading more!
B000YHG72E|5.0|Best humorous Christmas movie of all time.  Very, very  Funny!  We watch it every year as a family and really enjoy it.
B005HSL626|5.0|I originally played this at Dave and Busters and I fell in love! This is such a fun waster of time! It's perfect for the Kindle as well size-wise!
B008RA3X5E|2.0|It freezes and shuts own a lot and when I leave the app open, it always closes sometime in the night
B005801WTK|3.0|This is fun music if you plan to dance. Some of the songs can be borderline uncomfortable but when they are good they are good. However when they are bad they are bad.
B000FC2L1E|4.0|The book was well paced and very interesting to read.  The author kept my interest throughout the book and I would recommend it to anyone interested in historical fiction of 18th century Scotland
B008JGSM6G|5.0|It's a never ending game of fun! I guess one day I will finish all the puzzles but considering I have played for multiple hours multiple times it has lasted me this long! Great game if you like puzzles and problem solving games!
B000FC2L1Y|5.0|The story was riveting and kept my interest throughout the book.  The tibits of life during this time was very interesting and was woven throughout the theme of the book.  I highly recommend the book especially if you have interest in Scottish history
B002F6FQGK|4.0|I love Florence + the Machine! She is my favorite musical artist! This is a great first cd but there is no such thing as a sophmore slump for her! Her second cd is definitely better but this is such a great beginning!
B0063IH60K|4.0|Fun, fun, fun i like this game , especially when I need  to take a brake from homework assignments. But it also  has too any popup ads. so for the pop up ads I give 4 stars.
B00913DPW2|4.0|The Haunt is a nice take on an old game genre.<br /><br />The puzzles are really brain teasers, and can be overly hard sometimes but with the hint system or the option to sky them entirely it make is quite enjoyable experience.
B008BSPQ3E|5.0|Finally having a clean version of the So tour live is worth the price alone.  That damn POV video from '87 with the poorly synced dubbed audio and lame editing to studio footage has been fixed!  Three cheers for VocAlign(tm)!  I knew they had that whole Greece show was in the vaults somewhere!  Did we really have to wait 25 years for this?  It's a stellar production of that show.  Every part of the sound and picture is top notch EXCEPT they put This is the Picture at the beginning.  Wrong orders bug me.<br /><br />Similarly, remaster of So they put In Your Eyes last where it was the beginning of Side 2 traditionally.  However the remaster is brilliant.  As much as I love the original, I always thought it was a bit dull sounding.  The new re-master is loud, but not over compressed and high frequency response is more lively and clear.<br /><br />The DNA CD is fascinating.  Hearing the evolution of each song from the cassette demos to the production ruff mixes in a medley of each song is a very cool.  For real super super geek fans like me, I could have handled full versions of each, but I realized that would have been 2 more CD's of material most would find boring.<br /><br />Only complaints are that  a) packaging of the DVD's is poorly designed and hard get the discs out of.  b) Not enough wide shots of the Live show.  Really don't get a feel of all of the cool things the cranes are doing as part of the light show.  That was what made that show so visually gripping.  Aces otherwise!!!!
B009QW7HMC|3.0|I don't like season three nearly as much.<br />The new characters lack in interest for me The new group with the governer isn't a good add to the show at all. Andrea and her sword swinging friend have some value, but the governer is boring to me.<br />Hopefully AMC will get their act together soon with where the show is going or I'll simply stop wasting my money buying season three nd wait for it to show on Netflix.
B009471JQE|5.0|Nasty!...in a great way! Reminds me of pre-Eliminator ZZ. Will take you back to the more blues influenced &#34;Jesus Just Left Chicago&#34; sound
B0097GVJWQ|4.0|great game!!! graphics are interesting and detailed.  storyline is interesting, i would recommend it for anyone first trying this game style.
B009NQKPUW|1.0|There was no logic in this &#34;plot&#34; whatsoever. Many of the events in the movie happen for apparently no reason and are left unexplained.<br /><br />SPOILERS (actually nevermind, just read them and skip the movie): Having sex with a person infected with an alien virus(?) makes you pregnant with a squid, even if you're previously infertile? Just one of the many scenes that will leave you wondering what the scriptwriters were on when they wrote this.<br />Stay for the deleted scenes! Why the heck did they delete those scenes?? They were at least a weak attempt to explain why they were even there in the first place or why the alien suddenly went berserk.
B009LA1R34|5.0|Without a doubt, the best album of her long career. Every song is sung with strong passion, the lyrics are deep and emotional and her vocals sound better than ever before. Thalía has grown immensely as an artist and if you weren't already convinced of her talents as a performer, this album should be all the proof you will need. \\"Habítame Siempre\\" deserves all the awards it will (and should) receive. Bravo.
B002BWP49C|1.0|feature disc worked,but movie disc did not!had to take a refund&borrow the movie from a friend.I was very disappointed&sad.Sorry!!! I will put on my wish list&hope to get for Christmas.
B007FG9LIE|4.0|Took a bit to get to the point of &#34;what's going on here&#34;....but the end definitely justified the means!!!<br /><br />Couldn't put it down towards the end.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|This had been recommended to me, and I am delighted. As I'm nearing retirement, seems like a nice place to seek out.
B0098VXN2Y|1.0|Plot never comes together. They were trying too hard to hit all the stereotypes and missed every single one. Strongly recommend that you don't waste your time or money.
B0043GAZYS|5.0|I grew up with video games and comic books. This movie hails to my generation. The style used in this movie is amazingly graphic. It's fairly true to the books also.
B002QNBRXS|5.0|This was simply an incredible season from start to finish and Lithgow plays one<br />Of the most memorable villains I can remember. Season ended beyond shocking!
B003B02OOG|4.0|Very good short stories. Each had its own independent story set in Ford County.  Like all Grisham books its hard to put down.  Because they are short you cab get through one in a single setting.
B0015HOFZI|4.0|The turntable is cheap-looking and \\"plastic-ally\\".  The control buttons are like one would find on a ten-dollar toy, but they are functional.  The mechanism itself performs well and the sound is as one would expect from a hundred-dollar turntable; but that's OK because the dynamic range of the typical record (excepting those produced by top-of-the-line studios and equipment)is such that when the sound is transferred to digital media, the recording will probably be disappointing anyway if one is into sound reproduced professionally.  MP/3 people will probably be overjoyed that they can transfer anything recognizable from vinyl to a disk or whatever since excellence of sound is not a priority to them.<br />So, this turntable produces good enough sound for the average individual over a functional stereo setup, but don't expect much more owing to the medium.<br />The worst aspect of this whole deal is the supplied, Audio Studio software.  And the worst aspect of the software itself is the instructions that are obviously written by some geek or geeks who take it for granted that one has an understanding of how the software should perform in all of its complicated wonder.  If all you want to do is install the software and just start copying vinyl to digital immediately, you are in for a big disappointment:  There are no such instructions. I spent well over two hours trying to find the basics of Audio Studio and I failed miserably.<br />At this point, the turntable is hooked up and ready to copy my record collection to my computer (and then onto CDs). I am in the process of finding another record-to-computer copying software that is manageable.  When I find that software, I'll return with a review of what sound I am finally able to transfer.<br />Oh,  One last thing. If you want to listen to what you are recording, just get yourself a RCA-to-1/8\\" stereo adapter and attach the RCA patch cord from the turntable to the adapter and then plug the device into the Line In socket on your sound card.on your sound card.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|I didn't think this was one of Grishams best books but was a true to life living story like so many of his books.  I think you will enjoy the read the characters may remind you of someone you know.
1609611543|4.0|I purchased this book a couple of weeks ago but have yet to follow it exactly.  Too many good foods to eat right now but will get on track and see if this works.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|I want more of my favorite fiction character, reacher, each book has been a reading pleasure. This story was intreging and each character seemed to fit the story, I really liked it.  I have read all the reacher series, Lee Child is a great story teller.  I look forward to the next in the series.<br />I do not think Tom Cruise is the right actor to plar Reacher in the movies.  Very poor choice nothing about cruise fits this character.
B00A3DZ61W|4.0|THIS IS A VERY FUN AND ADICTIVE GAME,GREAT THEME!!! WOULD TELL ANYBODY AROUND THAT THEY SHOULD PLAY IT!!! GOOD GAME
0425263916|5.0|This book was so well written. I honestly could not put it down because I had to know what was going to happen. Loved it!!
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|fun and addicting! but run out of energy quickly and have to wait forever to gain more or pat for more... not paying to play a game
B008AK8FHM|4.0|I enjoyed it but, I did not expect this kind<br />of book. I think it was good reading but, have read better ones.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|If you love Star Wars and Angry Birds, you'll love this. Fun for the whole family. I would purchase again.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|The story was very believable. I liked the characters and the struggles of every day life. I would recommend this book to anyone looking for a good read.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|ANYBODY THAT LIKES ZOMBIE MOVIES.<br />IT IS THE MOST REALISTIC ZOMBIE I'VE SEEN.<br />I LIKE FOLLOWING THE SERIES EVERY WEEK.<br />LOOKING FORWARD TO NEXT EPISODE.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|It's great that this works even on watches! I'm using it with the FlickKey Keyboard on a rooted MotoACTV. FlickKey also works great on a watch.
B009VB7QQA|5.0|The movie was well written and directed. Enjoyed the historical facts included. Special effects were well done as well. Recommend seeing it.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I don't get much time to read...but this book made me MAKE time to read. So good and has so many story lines that everyone can  find something to  keep them reading.
B009VSW15Y|1.0|BE VERY CAREFUL THIS PRODUCT WILL  NOT WORK ON  THE KINDLE FIRE.  MISS REPRESENTATION OF ITS CAPABILITES MUST BE CORRECTED BY AMAZON.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|Amazing game where you breed dragons and build up dragon zoo basically. there are lots of games like this out there but Dragonvale has it down because they don't force you to buy within the  game at every turn. Tiny Monsters is the worst culprit of this; i deleted that game because I was so sick of digging through the &#34;deals for gems&#34; to even get to play the game. The option is available in DragonVale but its more of a an extra piece for those who just can't wait to see what dragon they got. You can play Dragonvale completely without buying gems, which makes me more likely to buy gems since I'm not forced to spend.
B00992CF6W|2.0|I couldn't upload this on my daughters Kindle Fire because it is connected to her father's Amazon account. So we had to end up paying twice for the game. (Paid again under her father's account). I guess I should have known how these accounts work, but i didn't and i had to pay twice. To be fair, she loves the game!
B00A7ZWUJC|5.0|It is the best Album ever! I love the style mixture in Unapologetic. I recommend buying. You won't regret doing so
B0083Z6AH6|5.0|no difference between free and paid one, so why not choose a free one? :) This is good enough for reading.
B006LSZECO|4.0|&#34;Gone Girl&#34; contains a great mystery and is a very good read.  At the same time, it isn't quite 5-star material, and I'm sure that are many peer or superior books.
1603425381|4.0|I like this selection of borders as it is often difficult to source these edgings for all sort of items, the instructions are easy to follow.<br />This is a lovely concise little book bursting with ideas.<br />I have maybe been mean in rating only 4star but because I am an experienced crotcheter I thought from the pictures there would be more intricate designs.<br />I will use this book for reference and for inspiration.
B008XNZMOU|5.0|Taylor Swift never disappoints and this is no exception.  Love it!  I'm looking forward to what she will write over the next 20 years
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Love this game. I have it on my iPad, iPhone and Kindle Fire. Works great on all the devices. Good when you just want to relax, but don't want to veg in front of the TV. The music is very meditative.
B0009HLD0K|5.0|Second only to American Flyers. This movie is great in the way that it shows the clash between locals and college kids and because of the bike-centric setting.
B009VB7QQA|5.0|I thought it was very interesting and liked the twist it gave about Abraham. I thought it was very good!
B009GEAPYW|5.0|Frank Miller rocks!! The Dark Knight Returns... way better than any other Batman animated movie, even better than TDKR by far
0425263908|5.0|Bared to You, the first of the Crossfire novels is an exotic love story that I couldn't put down it was so intriguing.
B0025KVLUQ|4.0|What can you say?  Another Beatles album must have for your collection.  I'm not all that certain that the remastering makes all of that much difference.  The previous sounded good as is.  Oh well, just my opinion.
0446580848|5.0|The Panther by Nelson DeMille is a great thriller that you can't put down as it keeps you riveted to the story page after page.  I knew there would be a twist to the story, so I had to keep reading until I found out what happens in the end.
B0087JTAKW|4.0|It was such a different book for me, but I'd seen the auther on TV and though the concept was so different.
0425263916|5.0|Reflected in You is the second book of the Crossfire novels.  What a love story, what Gideon will do for Eva.....wow!!
B00000ITOY|3.0|I bought this for my 2 year who loves puzzles, but he became so frustrated. I think it was the pegs that made him frustrated each time he tried to place the pieces back onto the board. I feel it's meant for a kid closer to the age of 3. Counting the pegs and holes will definitely help.
B002C4YYEU|5.0|The acting is superb, outstanding in fact. Johnny Depp is so versatile in his acting - he becomes the role, plays it out perfectly from beginning to end, whatever the role. He has truly made an art of his craft, and treats his profession with such respect that I will see whatever he plays in, produces or directs.  I watch his movies for the mastery more than the content, altho this story completely enveloped me - the concept , once I figured out what was going on, was . . brilliant!
B007SGM084|5.0|I think this goes beyond some of our secret thoughts or desires. Oh man, I couldn't put it down. Couldn't wait for my me time after work and after family duties were taken care of at the end of the day.
B0084IG7KC|5.0|I think this will go along side my other favorite movie, V for Vendetta.  I will watch it very often.
B002436WFI|4.0|Excellent rendition of the story, but who is doing the editing. The books never plod along at this slow pace.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I have had a difficult time trying to find books that my son wants to read, besides the Diary of a Wimpy Kid series. There's nothing wrong with those books, but my son is required to read books for school and take AR tests. He actually wanted to read The Hunger Games. I had to explain some parts of the books to him, and it sparked some interesting discussions, but they are great books.
B0012NIF56|2.0|Unlike Netflix, which has high quality most of the time, we seem to have an issue with amazon movies stopping in the middle and needing a complete restart every time. We were happilly watching superman two and it just froze, then when we finally got it back, the picture quality was diminished. This happened with other streaming amazon purchases but has never happened with Netflix.
B0034G4P7G|5.0|Awesome movie and package presentation.  One of the best I've seen.  The price was unbeatable, in fact I purchased another one to give as a gift.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|awesome game keeps my mind woking and is very ingenious vey good spin off of angry birds can't wait for a sequel
B000I9TY4G|5.0|I highly recomend this movie to all.  It only takes a few minutes to get addicted to the FireFly/Serenity world.  The cast blends together and draws you into the adventures.  If you are into SciFi this is the one for you.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I absolutely love this show. I truly cannot remember I was so excited to watch something. It is exciting, suspenseful, and so much more. I recommend this to anyone that doesn't mind a little gore. Awesome series that will leave you wanting more.
B002XXLKHY|5.0|This is one of our favorite holiday movies!  It was great to watch with the kids as we got ready for the Christmas season.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I read the book, saw the movie and have read the 2nd book and now reading the 3rd.. The movie followed the book very well.
B00A6PD8RQ|4.0|All of the family enjoyed this movie.  Great graphics, typical Pixar humor that entertains both adults and children, and a good message.  Fun for the whole family!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This is a great book..  wish now I would have just ordered the trilogy.  As soon as I finish my other books I will order the next two.  Thanks
B0083P1QUM|4.0|I've been reading Cornwell since the beginning and have skipped the past few books because the drama amongst the characters seemed to be going the way of a soap opera.  There appeared to be no easy way for Cornwell to write her way out of the situation.  In Bone Bed, I think she has taken the best course of action and has shifted the focus from all the external drama to Kay's internal and more personal issues.  In this way, Cornwell allows us to move away from the heavy and often negative dynamics of the characters and back into the world of Kay the doctor, forensic scientist, and woman.  The bit about the femme fatale in the ranks of the CIA was just implausible.  But otherwise, well done. I'll be reading the next one.
B002WV5A9G|5.0|Great movie. I would buy it as a classic trek film. You can't go wrong with this title and Chris Pine was great.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|I use this all the time for all sorts of notes for shopping, address, recipes, passwords, things to do you name it.
B009EAO38C|4.0|It's a good album, flows well from track to track, and is just a fun album for listen to.<br />I ill definitely buy more of their music.
B008I43DYU|4.0|I use this a lot.  it is so handy, my kindle is always with in my reach and it very helpfull.
B000OLGCI4|4.0|Received the DVD in the described time. The DVD was packaged not the best. I received the package, opened it just to find out that an entire corner of the DVD box was shattered. Pieces fell into the DVD case itself, so I was worried it ruined the quality of the DVD. However, the DVD looked fine, but I have not watched the movie yet...
1616614609|5.0|It is an excellent game and worthy of its roots.  It has fun new concepts and hopefully will not disappoint all the fans of the original game.  So far it hasn't.
B004UNX1LS|5.0|Clear, great selection of the latest videos absolutely for free!  I also have the app my ipad so I would highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good video!
B00881VLCE|5.0|My wife and I both enjoy this app. It is great app for relaxing and killing time. would recommend to anyone.
B009INAGY0|4.0|This a solid mid-tier release by Death.  After 3 proper reissues, Relapse is really scraping the bottom of the barrel on the extras, though.  I appreciate the remastered sound quality, packaging, & lyrics, but I would have preferred 1 disc for a couple bucks less b/c I don't see myself listening to the bonus material more than once.  In fact, if space allows, I'd prefer to see Scream Bloody Gore & Leprosy issued as a 1 CD combo pack for the next reissue.
B009A3NGF4|5.0|Babel is more mature in its sound and production than Sigh No More. It also takes more chances by diving deeper into the Christian themes hinted on the first album. Whether you're spiritual or not, Mumford and Sons deliver a folky rock that is currently the best in genre. Highly recommended.
B00A3DZ61W|4.0|It does what it is supposed to do. I don't know what else to say about it blah blah blah
B00A7Z8KAU|5.0|I think this is a great app, for the price and its very helpful. I love the way it gives you so many options!
B009MF5BXK|1.0|The fact that Stallone and all these other have-been actors get paid millions to do crap movies like this is bewildering. It's an offense to our intellectual as moviegoers.<br /><br />This movie is an exact duplicate of the previous, except with even more decaying past action stars like Van Damme and (can you believe it) Chuck Norris. Stallone's face now looks like a chicken on hormones, that man has had so many plastic surgeries and botox that he has become almost unrecognizable, he is just horrible to look at, a true freak. Amazing how these actors just don't know their limits and the difference between aging gracefully vs looking like a rotten old pumpkin.<br /><br />I don't usually review movies, but this one was such a blatant waste of my time that I had to blow off my steam here. And to all these people who have given this gargabe of a movie 5 stars, really Amazon, can you check that they're REALLY not under 13?
B009KHDT0C|4.0|I love to watch Johnny Depp so any movie he is in, is a good movie.  This movie made fun of a really old soap opera TV series made in the 1960's.  Dark Shadows was a guilty pleasure back then, everyone would say they hate it; but then, secretly watch it because it was captivating.  This was the same thing.  I love it!
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|My 11-year old daughter suggested I read it.  So I did.  It was a great book.  Unfortunately, we need to be reminded of some of the simple and important things in life - like kindness.
B0086221SS|1.0|I'm about to conclude that nobody knows how to produce a real comedy anymore.  This is the sixth straight movie, classified as a comedy, that I've watched without even cracking a smile!  I know I can still laugh when I watch older comedies.  Maybe it's just a generational thing, but I found the martini scene monologue veering more toward perversion than romance or comedy.
1594744769|4.0|A great change of pace read.  Unusual story which is good for a change from some of the predictable ones that I sometimes come across.
B009ZAY8MM|5.0|I usually add just one or two Christmas Albums to my collection each year.  Being a fan of PTX from The Sing Off, I didn't hesitate to purchase the entire album without listening to all the tracks first.  I was not disappointed either.  This is now plugged into my car's MP3 system on continuous replay.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|I loved this set. It allows me to play the move over friends that may not have bluray. Great extras but wish it was a directors cut.
B008ENA74E|5.0|I dealt with Goldman Sachs for many years and found this story to be completely believable.  Smith does a great job of describing the culture and the protocol for success at the Wall St icon.  His stories of how they would stick &#34;muppets&#34; with bad trades ('axes&#34;) rings true with my experiences.  GS (and other Wall St firms) called everyday trying to stick us with their mistakes and bring in quants that could barely speak English to convince us it was a good trade.  I used to laugh at some of the ridiculous crap they tried to stick to us.  I can't help but wonder if Smith had gotten named as MD if he would have been so self-righteous in the end.  I enjoyed the book for the stories alone and the refresher course on trading jargon.
B008MEM24S|5.0|I downloaded this app for my eight year old nephew and now I'm addicted! It's an awesome puzzle game, fun for any age!!
B0073PZN8O|3.0|The concept was awesome and I can't really complain about the acting. The way the story was put together and explained wasn't plausible.  Even in a sci-fi world it meeds to make sense.
B004QK5N5W|4.0|Helps expand the use of my iPad, which is very helpful, allowing me to not have to switch between my iPad and iMac so much.
B000K8EQ5W|4.0|Sandra Bullock and Keanu Reeves make a great team. Storyline is interesting, and we all hope that love always wins,
B0094BB4TW|5.0|This is my first e-book purchase to use on my new Kindle Fire, and I am very happy with it.
B00A6PD8RQ|4.0|From the previews, I was honestly expecting some sort of sojourn/journey for Merida as she sought to prove herself to her parents to avoid being married off.  She was an awesome character, and Kelly MacDonald was a perfect choice (even if I kept picturing her role in Boardwalk Empire)...the rest of the cast was great.<br /><br />I had a lot of fun watching this with my toddler (when she actually paid attention).  It's not violent; I was surprised they were able to make this type of movie without any gratuitious violent, but it had much less fighting than a movie such as Hercules.<br /><br />Overall a pleasant watch and probably a good addition to the collection, but the thirtysomething man in me was just hoping for a little more adventure.
B00A3DZ61W|1.0|Doesn't work at all. Won't load. All other AB's work fine. Tried deleting and reloading but no luck in Birdland
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this app!!! Me and my bros connect all the time. The online one cost like $26.00!!! But this was so much cheaper.
B009YX02T8|5.0|All the amazingness I expected. I love it and highly suggest it! :) The music is great and the saga goes out with a bang.
B0086700CM|5.0|this app is not awesome its amazing I love it if right now you are reading this say I if you love this if you don't you sick I love this app
B0045XICB2|5.0|This was such an awsome love story that i liked very much!The whole series was just written perfectly and would recommend this series to anyone that believes in true love or if they are into vampires and werewolves!
B006YXTRHY|5.0|This was so well played by the two wonderful actors!I liked the part where she can't carry the baby anymore but don't get me wrong i hated that that happened but the true love of Edward and he was willing to sacrifice everything to change Bella into his kind and then he bites her all over and then she finally wakes up!True excitement! can't wait to see Part 2,going tonight to watch it!
B005GG0MIS|5.0|A new way to look at the relationships from one president to the next.  The Presidents in most cases got along better than<br />Congress and the President today so I hope that members of Congress read this book too.
B009VSW15Y|2.0|Have nt been able to figure out how to take pictures of something in front of me. I must be missing something. can you help
B000SEIDR0|3.0|This book was recommended to me by my son and we both came out with different perspectives.  Too much information<br />for me,  I almost wanted to become a Vegetarian.  It was explained to me as a child how we get our food, and because I liked<br />beef and poultry I chose to block it from my mind.  Some of this book was a little too graphic for my taste.  I love most live<br />animals, and therefore this is now my dilemma.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I found this game easy to use and as solitasire always is, challenging.  The cards moved easily and I loved changing the card backs and the backgrounds.
B00A77II0U|5.0|I like this game. hidden object scenes,  puzzles. and a good story line. this is more an adventure game and not just hidden objects with a puzzle or two thrown in. thanks alawar.
B007KOLNXC|4.0|it's not quite as good as some of the previous seasons...but still solid.  Will happily devour season 6 when it comes.
B009YU62H2|5.0|If you are not sure about buying this record, let me assure you, as a fan, you will not be dissapointed with this record. This is Soundgarden! Not Soundgarden 2.0, this is the Soundgarden, the band you remembered and loved, but better. Is this possible? What has it been 15 years since &#34;Down on the Upside&#34;? The songs show a maturity that only, well, maturity can create. These are fully realized, well written songs. All four members were involved in the song writing process, so this is not a Chris Cornell record at all. Favorite tracks for me are: Taree, Rowing, Black Saturday and Non-State Actor. Do yourselves a favor and buy this record, you will love it. I paid 3.99$ for it, such a deal!
B002UM5BXW|5.0|I really enjoyed this book as i am a hack in the kitchen yet i love everything food.  The chapter on Tokyo and the story about knowing meat were entertaining.  Well worth reading.
B001NLKS16|3.0|Some of the chapters in the book are confusing and some are written in Latin.  But this book is great, especially if you've see the show!
B004LROMSO|4.0|This is a pretty well done series.  I got it mainly because my granddaughter loves it and I wanted to watch it with her.  She would have given it five stars, but I found it to be a little less compelling than she did.  Interesting take on the Arthur legends.
