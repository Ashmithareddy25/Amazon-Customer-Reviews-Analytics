B00B5HQLMI|5.0|Arguement will ensue, but Daniel Craig is the best Bond, ever! And, of the three Bond movies in which Craig has acted, this is the best (and that is saying a lot).<br /><br />Moreover, the supporting cast has never been more stellar, or better. The penultimate villan is electrifyingly brewed and concocted by Javier Bardim. Judi Dench, once again, is M, to the letter. Ralph Finnes adds just the right amount of upper class menace. And Ben Whishshaw, as Q (redux), proves that geniuses sometimes do have something left to learn.
B000I8H7RI|5.0|I use to hate this movie.  But I've grown to love it and the scenes of Bodaga Bay are really nice.
B003YV0A02|5.0|I never get emough of this movie. I could watch it monthly. If I were stranded on a desert island with only a screen, a DVD player and one movie, this movie would be my choice. It's a an action film, a comedy, a love story, a holiday movie...it's my absolute favorite Christmas film....
B0091W0JPE|5.0|You must remember this a kiss is just a kiss a sigh is just a sigh…….and a great movie will always be great
B009JZWO3I|4.0|Some sex, some intrigue, some implied violence, a little comedy, and even some financial woes. It's not particularly suprising, but it's good enough to justify another season.
B000S5C02S|5.0|Pixies. Need I say more? Yes, because they require it for the review. If you have no Pixies, but this. Play loud.
B002APU580|4.0|Of all the cinematic versions of Jane Austen's novel, this one comes closest to realizing the reader's mind's eye. While the book is still better, the movie is a delight.
1493680943|1.0|The cover said a Christmas Carol by Dickens, inside was a coloring book with nothing to do with the story. In another copy, the first page of the book started halfway through the story. Very cheaply made. Buy another version!!!
B000CEAGH6|1.0|This dino is five times smaller than expected for the price. I could I bought this at Dollar Tree. I'm returning it.
0670024856|5.0|This quiet, wonderful novel by Elizabeth Gilbert echoes inside me in myriad ways.  I love these characters, their travels, and the depth of understanding I was given of who they are and how they lived. Thank you, thank you Elizabeth.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|It's a lot of fun. I wish you didn't have to pay to play or wait for time to pass.
B003HV0TN2|5.0|Haven't finished yet but I felt compelled to write a review. I was looking for the next book that would grab me, that would have me wanting to be a teenager again and have so much time to read :)<br /><br />This one is not disappointing. The story is very well told, with just the right amount of details.<br /><br />The characters are intriguing, even the side ones. Watching the main character's development is a thrill and I can't wait see how it ends (at which time I might update my review, but I highly doubt it'll be any different, perhaps even more flattering).
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|The only frustrating thing is how different it is on Ipad! There are way more pictures already in the ipad content that are listed as future upgrades for kindle. Fun<br /> &amp; interesting game despite that.
B004ZGI1V0|4.0|Great suspense and good mystery.  did not put everything together until the end.  Pause for thought about our age of electronic identity
B001AR4K8K|1.0|This will not play on my dvd player.  It must have been made for a country other than the U.S.

B00F2362IE|2.0|Game was working fine the first 2 days. Wouldn't load up after clicking on the play button. Just a black screen.
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|Terrific and grandkids love the game - Only one challenge has two stars all the rest have three stars - Smartees!
B00AECGQF2|3.0|This game is the cutest! I have a lot of fun playing it. So I would recommend it to all people how like stile.
B00CKOYVG8|5.0|This is the very best Angry Birds game - love the challenge of others who play - so far we have beaten the competition weekly!
B00DWFQ2N4|4.0|Love Justin Timberlake and this cd does not disappoint.  I think I prefer the first one, however.  And beware, some of the lyrics are pretty raw.
B00B5HQLMI|5.0|We couldn't find it in the stores and when we did, it was much more expensive than purchasing it through Amazon.<br />Thank you and have a wonderful Christmas and Holiday Season
B00DURHYWC|5.0|Saw them perform many of the songs in concert. Best yet except for Phyllis Diller ending the album. Enjoyed Storm Large's songs the best.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|Vanessa Diffenbaugh proves the Language of Flowers doesn't have to be confined to poetry and history buffs. The main character, Victoria Jones, takes us on a journey through her struggles to accept herself and accept love from others while letting us see parts of her childhood which made her a hardhearted eighteen year old who only finds comfort in her flowers. Using the Victorian Language of Flowers, she becomes popular with couples and those seeking love as she uses her knowledge to portray special messages to others through beautiful flower arrangements. But her flowers can't help her cast away her feelings for Grant, a flower vendor who is a part of Victoria's most painful secret, the secret that caused her to lose her foster mother, Elizabeth. As she accepts that maybe she can love someone and be deserving of love, she ends up pregnant, which makes her fears and insecurities come back full force. After a series of bad decisions, the story wraps up the fates of Elizabeth, Victoria, Grant and their daughter, Hazel.<br /><br />I was surprised at how easily it was to pick up on the Language of Flowers throughout the entire novel, even the scientific names. Victoria Jones is a character you can become emotionally attached to and I found myself doing just that. The author explains emotions well, making me feel like I was right there beside Victoria the whole way. My only complaint is I wanted to see if Victoria and Grant were successful in raising baby Hazel, but how could they not be with a woman like Elizabeth by their side to support them?<br /><br />I am going to recommend this book to everyone I know. Being a mainly fantasy reader, I was even sucked into the storyline and anxiously waiting through each chapter to know how the story ended.
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|It's fast and easy to use. The only way to get information and to get the best way too.  Quick. Fast.  Thanks.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Another page turner from Grisham. He never disappoint! Hard a hard time putting the book down until I was finished!
B0012GMUI6|4.0|Good cd, and worth owning if you like Pink Floyd's (The Wall and Final Cut). Roger Waters first solo project after leaving Pink Floyd.
B001PPGAK8|1.0|If I could give it 0 stars I would. This movie failed to follow the comics in any meaningfull way, characters were not themselves, and the focus was all on Wolverine. They pretty much just kill off key X-men characters because they can, and show how awesome Wolverine is.
B00E8AVNBI|3.0|I liked Danny in Machete better.... he makes stupid, careless decisions in this movie, which ends up getting him his butt handed to him several times... whoever wrote this story, should at least made him as smart as he was in Machete.  Oh well, I guess it keeps the movie going, with him having to keep avenging himself.<br /><br />The action is too fast and too cut up also....  but, it's a new western, with some grit, and I unique story-line, so you gotta give it that.  Blood and gore, and torture, etc.... standard Danny Trejo, but this time he carries six-shooters.
B00DAPOHU6|5.0|Very mellow Jack Johnson, which is what I wanted. This CD has a different sound than the others, but the music is just as catchy.
1572814136|4.0|Great design, classic pictures but updated with more clarity and color.  Only complaint is that they are very thin card stock.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|Great story, really enjoyed every minute!  Had a hard time putting it down.  As always got what I expected from a Baldacci book.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|A great fast pace... erotic story that will leave you wanting more.  I would highly recommend this book to anyone looking for a quick read.
B0081336FO|4.0|Interesting approach to interpreting the works of Arthur Conan Doyle.  I am a diehard fan of Jeremy of Brett's interpretation of the iconic character of Sherlock Holmes, yet I can appreciate this 21st Century approach, though it does take many liberties with the canon.  Cumberbath does a remarkable job with the material provided for him.
B00GLX1MG6|3.0|This movie has some good laughs...just a dumb, funny comedy.  The acting was good, but nothing Oscar worthy which you wouldn't expect in this type of movie anyway!
B0054LJGWS|4.0|This book had its moments, but overall seemed uneven. Would have loved a deeper exploration of the lives of Crowley and Aziraphale, rather than the time spent on the Them. The bits by Gaiman (The Four Horsemen in particular) were the best parts of the book, while those by Pratchett, primarily the Them, were weakest. The children's voices didn't sound authentic to me. Might just be my pro-Gaiman bias, so take this with an appropriately large grain of salt, especially if you are a Pratchett fan.
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|This movie is so well done from the acting to the costumes... I think they do a good job of following the book.  That being said, a movie is never as good as the book.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Really enjoyed this whole series! Definitely a satisfying end to a great trilogy. If you're looking for a fun book that you won't think about putting down, look no further!
B008A36R2Y|1.0|I don't mind paying less for the version made in china, they can cost half the price. You could call it \\"Fakeduino\\" and people would still buy it because its cheaper. But this seller is deliberately trying to pass by as the Arduino brand, false advertizing is a serious crime, and insulting. Not to mention I was charged almost the same amount as the original.  See [...] for identifying faked boards. In addition the soldered components on the board being visibly crooked, this board fails all indications.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Tremendous book.  Makes me cry everytime I think of what others endured.  I wish all had a better quality of life.
B00DSO9RMC|5.0|Great book, good story, carries the Discworld further into the &#34;future&#34;, and more satire then you can poke a yorkshireman with.
0142403873|5.0|This is a very cute book and has quickly become one of my daughter's favorites.  Also enjoyed The Gruffalo's Child.
B005T87QCI|5.0|Another game my 9 year old found and he loves it. I wish the men were available for free instead of buying to unlock.

B00992CF6W|5.0|OMG  this game is so amazing I wouldn't stop begging my parents to get it for me then they said yes and there mad at me for  playing  it 24seven oooooooooooooooooooooppppppss!
B00BPDR3F6|5.0|An interesting historical fiction staring an amazing woman. Filled with interesting information and locations. I have a feeling I will be thinking about this book for a long time.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|This is a great game. Some of the 1 star reviews say it gets ruined after you update it, but that is not true. I just updated it on my kindle fire and it works great. You get deals in the shop too! I highly recommend it to anyone. Best game ever!
B0002EXH4K|5.0|This is the best Megadeth album of all time. This album has all the great songs. Sympathy of Destruction, Sweating Bullets, and etc.
B003VANOFY|5.0|I honestly bought this because I saw a gamer on Twitch (PhatomLord) post it on his facebook and I've seen him use this headset several times.<br /><br />Pros:<br /> - Sounds awesome, can definitely hear everything that is going on with the Dolby 5.1 or 7.1 turned on.<br /> - Amazing bass that you can have with this, honestly surprised me when I first put them on...pleasant surprise as I was expecting to get THAT much bang for my buck.<br /> - Funny voice morphs that you get default right away.<br /> - Chatting, friends have told me that this sounds a lot crisper and cleaner then other headsets I've used.<br /> - Memory foam on the top and ears.<br /><br />Cons:<br /> - Almost feel like the ears are too big, I have a big head and all by the earmuff part feels like it goes halfway down my jaw line.<br /> - Wish that the microphone could go almost 360, so you could wear it on the left or right side.<br /><br />Honestly the cons are just me being picky with the product.  It's a great product and I'm really enjoying it, now I just need to find more voice morph programs to mess with people.  :D
B00EJYGL8S|5.0|Can't get enough of their music Don't need any other Christmas CD than this one, unless you are buying more of their CD's.
B00FATEJYE|5.0|Please try this game. It's very very good! Am still waiting for a whole bunch of other great games of old (Mario Bros, etc). It took Warner Bros and DC Comics awhile, but it was worth the wait. Thanks very very much, I'm loving it!!!!
B007BFSYMS|5.0|Saved our sanity with a new baby. Hair Dryer and Vaccuum sounds were the only thing that helped her calm down and sleep.
B005VMSATA|3.0|Acting was good. The story became the usual save the universe. We didn't like that the young man who was infected and became the &#34;villain&#34; had no choice.
B00AEFZ6V4|5.0|Fun yet predictable movie. Fabulous stars making a fun heartfelt movie.  I can get a bit scary at times so I don't recommend it for small children. I really enjoyed it and so do my nieces. A great family film with some amazing fantasy themes.
B0049VZ222|5.0|This is a very addicting series. Keeps you wanting to watch it all night long. Even though zombies are crazy to think of in the real world, this show makes it seem very real. Good acting and special effects.
B00008G8M4|5.0|Independence Day is still a fun movie to watch, despite its obivous techilogical flaws.  I don't know why the photo shows ID4, I don't know what that means and the copy I recieved does not have that above the title. The movie plays great without any issues and has a few additional features. It's a great quality movie and one of the best action movies to come out of the '90's.
076790592X|5.0|Such a good book.  I don't read much, but I picked this up just to see what my son was reading for class.  It was so good.  It made me reevaluate a lot of things in my life and was definitely a good read.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|It works just as stated, and I'm confident that google will someday expand the apps it's compatible with. If you're looking to add smart features to a dumb TV, this is a really good option. Chrome tab mirroring is also somewhat useful. Ultimately the end user has to find a way to make this dongle useful, because it's kinda a novelty right now.
B00992CF6W|5.0|love this game it is very addicting but I wish the next update would come soon ready for it now
B00D2JDNQ4|4.0|This novel starts slowly but soon draws you in - once I was about 100 pages in, I found it hard to put down. I do think though that it could have been edited down a bit - it wasn't as tightly written as some of the other Booker winners in recent years.
B00BEIYMTW|4.0|\\"The world of 'Cars' takes flight in 'Planes'\\", proclaims the blurb on the cover of Disney's new Pixar-like animated feature. We could only wish. Pixar produced films with superior technical qualities, but was best known for finely crafted stories that appealed to young and old alike. Planes displays great computer animation, but has a hit-and-miss story that appeals to children while leaving adults largely out of the fun.<br /><br />The story revolves around Dusty, a crop dusting plane who wants to be an air racer, and he gets his chance to compete in a round-the-world race against champions from many nations. This allows for not only slightly exotic character development, but for great displays of scenery as well. The settings are familiar from Cars, (a rural backwater community, inhabited by rubes and relics), as are the sidekicks (numerous small forklifts as workers, a not-so-bright truck as a friend, and an experienced old timer as a mentor). There is one sly reference to the tractor-tipping scene in Cars, as Dusty the crop duster is sightseeing in India. He comments on the many tractors wandering the landscape below, and his Indian companion says \\"they are sacred in our country\\".<br /><br />Although lacking the subtlety and storyline depth of Pixar's best, the three and four year-olds I watched this film with thought it was fascinating. It was colorful, fast moving, and flew literally around the world with plenty of moments of beauty and peril that kept the kids on the edge of their seats. So for the small ones in your life I rate this one four out of five. Try it, you might like it, and your kids certainly will.
0316098329|5.0|Strange book. I've never read anything like it. As an English teacher, I was fascinated by the writer's use of language.  Couldn't put it down, but it was a little dark. It's not for everyone.
B00EJYGL8S|5.0|The Piano Guys never cease to amaze me! Their Christmas album is no exception. The perfect balance of beautiful, fun, and inspirational, this CD delivers your favorite Christmas tunes in true Piano Guys fashion. I tend to not like instrumental Christmas albums as much as vocal albums, but this recording is one I will never get tired of listening to. It's hard to pick favorite tracks since they're all so wonderful, but some of my top favorites would be &#34;Angels We Have Heard on High,&#34; &#34;Carol of the Bells/God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen,&#34; and &#34;We Three Kings.&#34; You should absolutely buy this CD - you won't regret it!
B0089LOG02|4.0|Good book; well-written, and it left me wanting to learn more about the orphan trains and the multitudes of children who boarded trains on the east coast, wondering what their futures had in store for them.
B00EJYGL8S|5.0|Love this album. Very beautiful and I love the added bonus of the DVD! I've already listened to this several times
031623480X|4.0|while i normally shy away from diet oriented books i do acknowledge the subject of nutrition is extremely important, but after reading so many opposing theories on the proper way to eat I was forced to simplify things and just use common sense.  this was a little different in the way that it was a diet specifically for optimal function of brain/neurology.<br />  theory makes sense, I personally feel he comes down a little too hard fruits, though.  the other thing that bothered me was that he made absolutely no mention of fermented foods.

B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Wonder is fabulous; I both laughed and cried out loud.  This book is about a fifth grade boy, but any gender and age will find something moving and useful in the novel.  I like the short chapters; they make for a fast read.  I also like the switch of the first person narrator.  I plan on using this novel with my high school you d adult lit class.
B009CPEOC4|5.0|Purchased this item for an 8 year old.  I found the content age appropriate even though there are songs by Katy Perry that may not seem so.  Nice blend of music and inspirational messages to young girls about following your dreams.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|This was a real page-turner. I normally take at least 2 weeks to finish a novel. I finished this in 3 days!
B007MC8YLQ|5.0|Great game. I always loved Freecell, and this version is fantastic. The presentation is great, the sound effects are great, and the animation is great. Other than that, it's Freecell!
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|I loved this book, I've reread this book a couple of times, it gets you thinking out of the box, I hope that everyone that reads this book may find what they were searching for.
B00A4OALL0|5.0|I love Wanye Shorter his work with Miles (Nefertti and E.S.P), his solo albums (Juju and Speak no Evil) in the late 60's and his work with Herbie (Joni Letters) were my favorites but this new album is my absolute favorite.<br /><br />I am often chided by my elder jazz friends for being comfortable with a specific style and sound but for Wanye Shorter, I never tire of his music... as I grow as a listener, I appreciate his mastery...for me it truly gets better with time!
B00992CF6W|5.0|this is totally worth the money!!! amazing game thats addicting! *superrrrrr good game* minecraft rocks! Me and my friends love to play minecraft together!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I loved this book you will love it to<br />It took me one day to read.of course you must start with the first one
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|Great game, just don't like the energy system. It doesn't seem like a game that need to limit a number of hits per level.
B003YL4LYI|3.0|I could not read books 1,2,3 fast enough.  They were superb.  Book 4 began to drag and book 5 is moving along so incredibly slowly that I am finding it difficult to finish.  I have really enjoyed Martin's literary style and enjoy the development of the characters, but i want the story to get moving!!!!!  I hesitated to buy the book after reading other reviews. If you enjoy Martin's style it is probably worth reading, but just know that the pace of the book is exasperatingly slow.  I hope book 6 ties everything together!!
B008Q08EV8|5.0|I enjoyed the movie; it was well done. The challenges and fights were full of action. Amazon Prime made it easy to find.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|Ok, I almost didn't read this book due to all the negative reviews.  I don't get it. Not every series should be predictable and have a perfect ending. I liked the book and the ending.  The ending had a meaning and a purpose. Did I just spend the last 45 minutes sobbing while trying the read the print through my tears, sure?  I think that was the point. Isn't it good if you are so connected to the characters that you feel their pain and emotions?  Don't we watch movies that make us cry?  If you read the other two books, read this one.  It's worth it.
B005N7CA3A|5.0|Darren Hayes is my favorite singer going back to Savage Garden. I have all his CDs and love everything. I particular like this one. The songs really touch my heart in a personal way. This is an awesome collection for any Darren fan. I may have to get a new one soon I have listened to this one so much.
B003Q6D2B4|4.0|I liked the actors in the movie. They all played good parts. There was great action and suspense through out the movie.
B00FGFVMGA|4.0|The game was super fun and I enjoyed figuring out all the little puzzles. I liked how it included an option to get hints so you don't get super stuck on one part of the game since that usually takes away the fun. I do wish that they had different adventures than just the one.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|great book, loved every minute. couldn't put it down. I thought it was even better than the movie for sure.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I don't know why this game is so addicting, it just is fun. The only downside is the game does require WiFi to run.
B001GQSY5K|5.0|My son loves this movie, wasn't available for streaming so happy to found it on DVD. My son just came of age to begin appreciating the Clone Wars series, coming off of LEGO Star Wars mostly, and I do not regret having him watch this before beginning the actual TV series. Must see!
B00DJYJPLO|5.0|The dialog is so natural it feels more like eavesdropping than writing...so truthful and uncontrived it is almost embarrassing...yet gives hope that honest love is really all we need....

B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Although I am new at this game, I am enjoying it immensely. It did not take this elder long to learn the ropes. The game can be played without purchasing anything extra as long as one doesn't mind having to be patient. This best tip I can give is to have more one of these types of games going at the same time to extend your playing pleasure.
B000HKW7E0|5.0|Top 5 all time best comedy in anyone's book.  Will undoubtedly be a classic Christmas movie for decades to come.  And don't we all have a Cousin Eddie in our family?  Very funny.

B00FR0GT9Y|2.0|The more I listen to it, the less I like it. Tinny, thin, pathetic drum machine.  Let's face it, we're listening to Tom's solo work at this point. 8 new songs, the rest are rehash material from Corporate America, which was also weak. I just don't understand his continued use of electronic drums.  All the bragging about the analog sound and then he elects to go with a digital drum machine again!  It makes the songs sound like cheap elevator music. Tom, if you ever do another record, please use a studio drummer. Your solo stuff would be much better with real drums brought forward just a bit. The percussion is simply too thin and wimpy on these tracks.  If you're looking for that old school Boston sound, you won't find it here.  If you like electronic elevator music, you might like it.ok with it, but certainly not blown away.
147676459X|5.0|If you have not read Allie Brosh's blog, Hyperbole and a Half, you should probably check it out. Reading Ms Brosh's work is like letting rainbows and sunshine into your life, where angels dance and cherubs sing and the air just glitters with a shimmering light. Not reading her work is like punching yourself repeatedly in a very sensitive part of your body for hours straight while also pulling your hair out with large pliers. Some people find that to be a good time, but I've never understood those people, and I don't believe in what they are all about.<br /><br />If you've read the blog, then you know that you want to buy the book. You are probably reading this review for amusement purposes only. I do wish I was funnier, but hey, that's what the book is for. If you could just laugh all day long by reading Amazon reviews, no one would buy any books or read any funny blogs. We would just read reviews for banana slicers all day long (hilarious, BTW).<br /><br />If you haven't read the blog, then you are probably experiencing some sharp pains, and wondering where all the clumps of hair around you are coming from. Fear not! Buy this book and all your pain will go away! (Existentially, so to speak. This book has no medical healing properties.)

B009HEMJCW|5.0|This movie has an excellent story with a great message, especially for young girls (and their mothers), who may not be happy with their looks.  The underlying message; that we can be happy just the way we are, is especially important in a day and age when Hollywood and photo-shopped supermodels portray unrealistic &#34;ideals&#34; for what is considered beautiful and acceptable in society.  The character Penelope shows there is much more to a person than outward appearances alone.  Mothers, be loving with your daughters and help them to be happy with their looks and to know they are beautiful just the way they are.  Be you, and be beautiful!
B00FATEJYE|5.0|This is a good app for playing while you wait for another thing to finish. I have gotten so far that I get about 30,000 each time I finish playing. But be careful, this game can be addicting, so be sure to also spend time with family, and not always glued to your Kindle. Just saying.
B00ENIR864|5.0|Works like a champ, only tried it once, however it read the code immediately, welcome to the 21st Century! To bad on the Kindle Fire HD the camera is forward facing...

B002ZCY7SW|5.0|Excellent series! Must watch! Looking forward to the new season coming out next summer! Long live 24 and Jack Bauer!
0345535529|2.0|Let me start off by saying that I have seen the first two seasons of game of thrones so I have a pretty good idea of what happens in the first 2 books. I started reading the first book and got to page 248 and the next page is 315. So i am missing 67 pages worth of book. If I hadn't seen the series I might have been a bit more upset. I went ahead and kept reading and so far no more missing pages.<br />We will see if any of the other books are missing pages and I might update this review.
B0058UXHHK|5.0|I decided to read this book at the suggestion of my daughter. Once I started I couldn't put it down.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|Not sure I would have put those two concepts together before, but I find it very enjoyable. Allows me to distance myself from the pain I must live with.
B00280LYIM|5.0|Great book with a plot twist. Ethan the second half of the observer on a Tuesday night at the beach
B0055V6EZE|5.0|Very original CD.  This CD is very intertaining.  I bought his other CD and I loved that one too.  Five stars is not enough.
B00EJYGL8S|5.0|I've always been a fan of The Piano Guys. They are all very talented. Awesome music! A must buy. Would make a great gift too!
B00DERIV8Y|5.0|There aren't many action figures that look just like the person they're supposed to be, but this Daryl Dixon figure is incredibly detailed and looks exactly like him.  It's going to be hard to give it away as a Christmas present, because I want to keep it!  I was a little skeptical when I saw the photo, but it did not disappoint.  It really is just as pictured, and one of those must-have additions to any &#34;Walking Dead&#34; fan's keepsakes.  Well worth the price, which was quite reasonable.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|It was a little gory but still cool and it was shorter than a lot of gory books I have read

B00B4VXQC8|4.0|It arrived with few cracks on the CD case as what is describe on the product listing overall it is good looking. I haven't open it yet but I guess it will be good. Not a bad price for a newly released album from Bon Jovi. ;)
140006922X|5.0|Thought provoking take on the life of the most influential person that ever lived.  Reza Aslan did a superb job of separating fact from myth and conveying a detailed picture of life in Judea at a most complex an violent time.  I was afraid that reading this might shake my faith, but it did the opposite.

B003VS0CX8|5.0|Rogers & Hammerstein's music is timeless even if the movie is a bit dated and corny at times.  Julie Andrews is truly amazing.  The cinematography is breathtaking.  This has to be a &#34;must see&#34; for any movie buff.
B00337MTA6|5.0|The book, itself met my expectations. I was a bit disappointed in the edition. I was thinking that it was the 1928 edition but once I got it, it was actually the 1961. And, the art was different on the front than what it shows here.
B005LAIIN0|5.0|I truly enjoyed this movie.  I have always had a soft spot for zombie movies starting with Dawn of the Dead.<br /><br />Zombieland is still my favorite but this will be in my top 10.<br /><br />This is one of those movies you can watch over and over.

B00GLX1MG6|3.0|Good rental glad I didn't spend the extra cash at the movies. Most of laughs were shown on the trailers for this movie.
B0032Y8XH8|3.0|Another reviewer commented that the songs on this album all kind of sound the same, and I have to agree.  It definitely does not hold up to repeated listening.  When I have it in my 6-disc car changer, I find that by the time it comes around again in the rotation I am ready to skip over the disc.
B009LDMJGA|4.0|\\"King Animal\\" and I have been having this battle over the past year since its release. I don't know what I was expecting for Soundgarden to release after such a long hiatus, but I was excited. As someone who likes *all* of their work for different reasons and different types of listening moods, I am not lamenting what this album isn't (in other words, Louder Than Love or Badmotorfinger or Superunknown... or even Down the Upside, which I did really enjoy). Every album that I just listed sounds different from the other; Soundgarden is a band that changes, evolves and builds on top of itself rather than just recreate the same sound (heh-heh, making them a GARDEN of SOUND).<br /><br />And yet... for whatever it was, \\"King Animal\\" really put me off. I couldn't get into it-- \\"Been Away Too Long\\" was super commercial and had me worried, especially after The Avengers song. Was my precious SG selling out? Oh no... \\"Non-State Actor\\" didn't do much in the way of wooing me and then I was annoyed. I admit that I flipped through songs (oh digital music how you are killing music and/or albums) and stayed away from it, playing Badmotorfinger a little louder and finding new comfort in Ultramega OK. Having witnessed SG's welcome back tour, I knew that the band still had their chemistry and skill, but I just didn't get \\"King Animal.\\" I went to the \\"King Animal\\" tour as well... it didn't seem like the fan base was as excited about \\"King Animal\\" songs, so I felt that maybe I wasn't missing out on too much and that was until I heard \\"Rowing.\\"<br /><br />\\"Rowing\\" is-- by far -- my favorite song on this album. Driving home from the concert, I sought it out and then wondered how I could've passed by this gem (did I even make it there?) and slowly began to pay attention to this album. This album does not have a super hit on it; there's no \\"Burden...\\" or \\"Outshined\\" or \\"Spoonman\\" this time, but maybe that's okay. Maybe, just maybe, creating hits is not the only thing SG is looking to do. It seems like this album is an exploration of their sound, skill and perhaps even reintroducing themselves to listeners.<br /><br />I decided to give \\"King Animal\\" a real chance. Understanding what this album was about, and its sound, I gave every track its due. Harmonically, lyrically and skill wise -- the majority of these tracks show the great musical skill that the band has individually and collectively. There is understanding about music and even a confident, self-assured quality in their sound. The album is less focused on producing a few mega hits with filler between them, but instead... they've produced a piece that builds within itself-- in other words, an album. The only song that seems completely out of place on the record would be \\"Halfway there\\" which sounds like Chris really wanted this particular track on the record even though it breaks with the flow.<br /><br />I am glad that I kept trying with this record. It will take a few listens before you might really even begin to get it (and in retrospect, it took me a while to get some of their other stuff), but I do think the more open you are & if you're willing to set for yourself an idea as to how you define \\"good music\\" versus what you think SG should do, you'll likely have a better experience with it. Don't get caught up in defining SG-- they've always been good about doing it for themselves.<br /><br />Overall, I do not think that this is the definitive Soundgarden album, but it is exactly what it needs to be....<br /><br />(Songs you must give an objective, real chance are: A Thousand Days Before [So DotU], Attrition, Eyelid's Mouth, & Rowing. These may not be the absolute best in the sense of the word, but they're - for me - the most interesting tracks to listen to & are worth 20 minutes of your time.]
B0067R0APK|3.0|I love Accuweather's forecasts.  They're the most accurate around.  They do live up to their name.  What I don't like is the software updates.  Every time there's an update, all of the locations that I've entered get deleted.  I have to re-enter the location data all over again.  I also end- up having to reset all of my preferences.<br /><br />This is silly.  There's nothing especially exotic about saving the user's locations and preferences and transferring them to the new version of an app.  Some how though, the designers of this app don't seem to be able to do this.  That reduces my rating to a 3.  Fix that, and accuweather will be  the perfect weather app.
B002PL5GTC|5.0|This is a great collection.  You can't complain when Dave puts out so many awesome songs.  Every song on here is well done and I'm glad that some of the newer stuff has gotten representation too.  If you're a Foo fan, you'll love it.

B00FEMJF6O|3.0|Love playing this however it takes too many coins to purchase buildings when you're just starting out. Zynga needs to rethink this part otherwise enjoying the new game.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|this is the best app and I love it on my kindle it dose not glich or lag and that is not the best part the best part is it is very fun and it is FREE!!
B0001IMCDE|4.0|As a movie I used to love as a child, I now find &#34;Return to Oz&#34; to be a bit cheesy as an adult. However, kids should enjoy this unique follow up to &#34;The Wizard of Oz.&#34; Don't expect to see the lion, tin man, the wizard and other characters from &#34;The Wizard of Oz.&#34; Most characters in this movie are new, and were not in the first one. Some scenes may be a bit scary for little ones as there are several &#34;villains&#34; after Dorothy,  so I would recommend this movie to ages 8 and up.
B00F2362IE|1.0|it is not the best game but if it loads right it will work but it is not worth the money end time if I could I would rate it 0 stars it freezes it when you trey to get in the game it always says Rooftop Run not spawning and It'll know it is the werst app ever!

B00EJYGL8S|5.0|There are no words. I suppose that's why there is music. Our entire family loves The Piano Guys, even my 19 month old son will settle down to sleep for their music. I love the Christmas season and own a plethora of Christmas music. Even so, this album is now a new Christmas music tradition in our home and will take a prominent place with our very favorites. Just the right mix of playful fun and peaceful reflection. Thank you Piano Guys, for bringing such joy into our lives and into a world where it is sorely needed. From our family to yours, we wish you a very merry Christmas!

B003O86FMW|5.0|OMG. This trilogy is absolutely one of the best reading experiences I've had. I started reading it because my teenage granddaughter had read it and I wondered what she liked. Now with the movies coming out, it is a great source of conversation.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|This is a continuation of his characters in &#34;The Shining', and he drew it together remarkably well. It is a weird book, but so was &#34;The Shining&#34;. Very entertaning and hard to put down. I really hated for it to end.

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This trilogy is absolutely one of the best reading experiences I've had. I started reading it because my teenage granddaughter had read it and I wondered what she liked. Now with the movies coming out, it is a great source of conversation. My sister was reading it at the same time. We were texting as we got to the end of this book (and the end of the trilogy). She finished a few hours before me and said &#34;I think I'm going to need counseling before I can go to sleep.&#34; It was riveting.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|Why is this such a best-seller among women? I was immediately struck by the poor quality of writing and felt it should have had a better editor. When it comes to the subject matter, I felt it was anti-feminist and pro-submissive. Ugh! I thought it was a trashy novel.
B00DQC2FPM|5.0|Amazingly awesome! My boyfriend and I had so much fun putting this together! We are now on a LEGO frenzy...

B00EDY5KTA|4.0|Frozen is the 53rd official animated feature in the Walt Disney canon. Directed by Chris Buck and Jennifer Lee, Disney veterans who previously worked on The Little Mermaid, Pocahontas and Tarzan, the film is loosely based on Hans Christian Andersen’s classic fairytale The Snow Queen, albeit significantly ‘Disneyfied” and turned into a full-fledged musical. The story involves two princess sisters from the kingdom of Arendelle, Elsa and Anna, voiced by Kristin Bell and Idina Menzel. As she grows up, Elsa begins to manifest powers that allow her to manipulate snow and ice, culminating in an incident at her coronation as Queen that leaves Arendelle under a blanket of eternal winter. Elsa flees from her home, distraught, but Anna resolves to reconcile with her sister. Teaming up with Kristoff (voiced by Jonathan Groff), a gruff mountain man, and Olaf (voiced by Josh Gad), an anthropomorphic snowman, Anna sets off into the frozen wilderness to find the Snow Queen with the fate of the kingdom in her hands.<br /><br />The songs for Frozen are by husband-and-wife composing team Robert Lopez and Kristen Anderson-Lopez, who previously worked for Disney on the Winnie the Pooh movie in 2011, and who co-wrote both Avenue Q and The Book of Mormon on Broadway. Their songs are decent, but oddly unmemorable, and certainly anonymous enough to make one long for the days when Alan Menken would collaborate with Howard Ashman and Tim Rice. The two showstoppers are clearly “For the First Time in Forever” and “Let It Go”, the first of which features prominently in the film’s trailers. These two are classic Disney ballads – all soaring melodies and searching, profound themes about being true to yourself and all that stuff – and the Demi Lovato version of “Let It Go” is a virtual shoo-in for an Oscar nomination. It’s very good indeed, although I do prefer Idina Menzel’s performance in the film itself. The other songs are pretty enough, although two obnoxious Disneykids in “Do You Want to Build a Snowman?” are saccharine enough to put a diabetic in a coma. Oddly, the Lopezes have a peculiar habit of having their cast sing muffled from behind hands or through mouthfuls of food, which is more than a little off putting. The lyrics are clever, though, and one of the comedy songs, “In Summer”, has a couple of clever zingers about the potentially watery fate faced by snowmen when the ice thaws.<br /><br />The score is by Christophe Beck, who seems to be the new go-to guy for the mouse house following his successful assignments on the reboot of the Muppets franchise and the acclaimed animated short Paperman. In terms of the score it’s interesting how, in recent years, the organization has jumped around trying to find its musical identity. Whereas Alan Menken was the undisputed Disney composer for almost the entire 1990s, in recent years composers ranging from James Newton Howard to John Powell to John Debney to Henry Jackman and more have all written one or more scores for the studio, leaving it with a curious lack of a signature “sound”. It remains to be seen whether Christophe Beck’s score will be successful enough for him to confirm him as Alan Menken’s more permanent successor, but on the strength of his work here, he deserves at least a shot.<br /><br />It wouldn’t be a stretch to say that Frozen is one of the best scores of Christophe Beck’s career to date – it’s certainly on a par, quality-wise, with some of his other acclaimed scores such as the first Percy Jackson movie, The Seeker, or We Are Marshall. Beck’s score musically explores the story’s Scandinavian roots, incorporating regional instruments such as the bukkehorn – an ancient wind instrument made from a ram’s horn – and Sami vocal techniques, such as kulning (a sort of Norwegian yodeling) into the fabric of the score, alongside a traditional 80-piece orchestra and choir. The opening and closing cues include two performances of “Vuelie”, a lovely piece inspired by traditional Norwegian music, performed by the Norwegian all-female vocal group Cantus in the former, and by singer and musician Frode Fjellheim in the latter.<br /><br />The rest of the score tends to be more straightforwardly orchestral, a mix of soaring string-led melodies with dreamy, icy, twinkly percussion built into the orchestrations, and some quite powerful action music for the more dramatic material in the film’s second half. Of the more tranquil and/or lighthearted pieces, “The Trolls” includes some magical-sounding performances for harp and harpsichord which are quite playful, while the coronation piece, “Heimr Arnadlr”, features original lyrics in Old Norse and a beautiful ecclesiastical aspect with layered vocal harmonies that Handel would have enjoyed. The “Winter Waltz” is light and pretty, and “The North Mountain” and the lovely “We Were So Close” combine some light comedy with moments of sparkling wonderment, but it is in its darker moments that the score really comes into its own.<br /><br />“Elsa and Anna” has some cool timpani rhythms and strident string runs towards its conclusion, foreshadowing what is it come, but things really take off during “Sorcery”, where Beck ramps up the tension and terror, has the strings mimic the sound of swirling, frost-kissed wind, and showcases the kulning vocals for the first time. The bukkehorn crops up as a hunting herald in the subsequent “Royal Pursuit”. As the score progresses, cues like the frenetic “Wolves”, the galumphing “Marshmallow Attack”, the muscular “Summit Siege” and the forward-thrusting “Return to Arandelle” are genuinely exciting and energetic, some of the best action music I have heard Beck write to date. There’s a repeated brass triplet motif that flows through many of these action moments that is just terrific, and when everything comes to a climax in the four-minute set piece “Whiteout” – orchestra, choir, and the soulful kulning – the result is outstanding.<br /><br />Perhaps the one main drawback in the score – stemming from the fact that the score composer and songwriters are different – is the general lack of any crossover between the two. There are some gentle allusions to the song melodies here and there – the ostinatos underneath “Coronation Day” come from “Do You Want to Build a Snowman?”, for example, while some of the chord progressions from “We Were So Close” seem to be from “Let It Go”. But, for the most part, Beck’s score and the Lopezes songs are two distinct, separate entities, and that gives the soundtrack as a whole something of a disjointed feel, a lack of an organic connection between the two elements. Much of the film’s pre-release press sang about how Beck worked with Lopez and Anderson-Lopez on incorporating their songs into arrangements in the score, and how the trio’s goal “was to create a cohesive musical journey from beginning to end”, but I genuinely don’t hear any direct statements of any thematic material from the songs anywhere other than in the “Epilogue”, and it’s very frustrating.<br /><br />In the bigger scheme of things, and taking into account Disney’s rich history of music in their animated films, Frozen is a comparatively minor work. When compared against the likes of Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin, or even Mulan, let alone the likes of Pinocchio or Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs – well, there is no comparison really. But, taken on its own terms, there is a great deal for score fans to enjoy, especially in the action music, while fans of the Lopezes work on Broadway will probably enjoy the show-stopping ballads quite a bit as well.<br /><br />Note: this is a review of the single CD, standard release version of the Frozen soundtrack. A special 2-CD expanded edition set also exists; the second disc of that release contains demo recordings of songs and score compositions, unused outtake recordings, and instrumental versions of the film’s main songs.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|One of the worst pieces of trash I've ever read. Only read the first and won't read the rest. Poorly written and was a pornographic book. Should have been rated R. I hope no teenagers read it. Awful, awful, book.

B00BI5IXL4|5.0|I bought the downloadable version. My review is for the less tech-y of us! :) You need to find Amazon 'UnBox' application. First download that to your computer. It's free, and only takes a few minutes. Then, when you buy a movie, it'll download the movie to your UnBox. This movie took a few hours to download, but that was fine... I set it to download and did other things around the house and ran a few errands. You can start watching the movie while it's downloading, but I wanted it all there first. When you're ready to watch the movie, just click the UnBox icon and click 'watch the movie' and there it is!<br />By the way... I loved this movie!
B001KWTBVQ|5.0|I think it's the perfect movie.  A love story with a fairy tail ending.  The best rendering of a Cinderella movie I have ever seen.

B007EECSFA|4.0|This story is intriguing and keeps you interested, as there are lots of twists and turns in the plot.  The characters are well developed, but the present day ones, less so.  The book goes back and forth between past events and current ones.  It can get confusing until you get into the book.
B00GN76K4Y|1.0|Whenever you get on the level that has the guy with fire coming out of his head there's a glitch. I was on the very last round on a tournament trying to get a new character, but noooo I got burnt by his fire and the ball disappeared. So I waited and waited and what happens, the match ended with me losing by 1 point. So this is why I'm so posses and giving it 1 star and deleting the app of my kindle.
B002VWNIDG|3.0|Not a really scary movie. But for the time it was published defienetly a good movie. Its more funny then terryfing. :)
B00594XOZU|5.0|Love this app is great for trying when your phone dies or if sunrise m someone doesn't have a phone this is a great app for u both to get to communicate with each other plus u can have group chart! :)
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Just got this in the mail today... All I can say is that I am in love!!! A great cheaper alternative to viewing netflix and other things without paying $100's of dollar on a console! We'll worth the $30!!!! Hope you enjoy!!!
0393312836|5.0|This book is one of a disturbing type. I would not necessarily recommend it for young readers because of some of the content. For people who are older this book is disturbing, thought provoking and brilliant all at the same time.<br /><br />The story is told by the central character Alex who is violent and bad just because that is who he is. Him and his gang go around creating havoc until Alex is mutinied by them and left to be arrested. The story talks in a a brutal invented slang that at first can make the book hard to understand, but adds to his and his friends different social pathology. Through all the different writing techniques that arise some very important questions and brought up: to what extent do people go to make everyone &#34;good?&#34;<br /><br />In a very interesting way the author shows a duality between the government and the young people who rebel. It is shown in a dark twisted way the freedom that the boys want and at a point have. The police are trying to reign in this horrid behavior and are wanting to fix the ones who are caught in violent heinous acts.<br /><br />A Clockwork Orange was in the end a good read. It kept me interested in what was going on and really had an effect on some of my thoughts regarding freedom and how a person is. It will appeal to people for many different reasons. It will effect people in completely different ways; but it will effect them.
B003O86FMW|3.0|Haven't read it yet but can't turn the page to start til I review. Nice job amazon. Need three more words.
B005KLZWZC|4.0|it was a very good read one of the best sets that I've had in awhile when I got done my 14 year old daughter read it and she was really impressed interested in some of the spin offs
006202406X|2.0|The ending of this was terrible. And I agree with the others that Tobias's point of view was very different than expected.
B001NLKT60|5.0|Excellent read if you haven't read it you are missing a treat. One of the best reads I have read in quite some time.
B00EJYGL8S|5.0|Wonderful Christmas music by some of the most talented guys around.  Brings tears to your eyes to watch it on the DVD (included).  Something the whole family can enjoy for years to come.  Thanks, Piano Guys!  You've done it again!
B005CGI4EG|5.0|For the money of this set, this complete series is an awesome value. I remember when the DVDs first started coming out and they were about $25-30 each. So $40 or so is a great value. I love every episode on here. Long live the legend of Al Bundy #33
B004JN1D2I|5.0|Loved it especially cause I saw the series I would not read this without seeing the series first, They cast as series perfectly
B00H1O3XO8|4.0|Did I miss something? What happened with the &#34;cliffhanger&#34; last week? The judge's phone call to Alicia to get coffee?
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Beautifully crafted lifescape of a family's journey through time and across the world.  Loved reading it and contemplating the work afterwards.
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|Minion rush is great for kids or adults to play, but I am disgusted by it. No, not by the fart gun. It's because I had fifty tokens, I completed an offer for 44 tokens. I should have had 94 coins but I didn't. I hadn't spent one token and after I completed the offer I had 0 tokens. Yes, 0. I unlocked the residential area and wanted tokens. So disappointing. But, other than that, it's a great game. P.s., I lost the tokens when I got this app on Android, not Amazon.
B00EJYGL8S|5.0|Such a great CD!!! I love the music, and I love the Piano Guys!!! Keep up the wonderful work you guys do!!!!!
B005LAJ16I|5.0|I love television.  But this show is the best.  I tell everyone about the show and how it never fails to entertain and keep you on the edge of your seat!  Even started purchasing seasons for gifts.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I really like this app. IT IS EASY TO USE. I can see the weather in more than one place. I have five sisters and I worry when the weather is bad in one of the areas they live in.
B005SV9W4Q|2.0|Garbage.  One of the worst remix CDs I've ever purchased.  Save your $$$$.  There wasn't a track on this disc that wanted me to get up and dance!!!!!!!!!
1451666179|4.0|This book was as hilarious and poignant as her blog, and I thoroughly enjoyed myself with it. I love Allie Brosh!
0316055433|1.0|This is arguably the worst book I have ever read. Tartt attempts to give us four stories for the price of one, and the resulting mess is like mixing pickles with Corn Flakes with orange sherbet with olive oil. The overwhelming story line was not about the painting at all, but read like a manual of pharmacology. Then there was the story of the painting - that would have made a good story. Then there was the story of the protagonist's relationship with his employer. That would have made a good story. Then there was the story of the PTSD. That would have made a weak story. And, thrown into the mess are the sub stories of the protagonist's relationship with his friend Boris and with the woman he loved and who remained unattainable. There was also the story of his relationship with the family with whom he lived for some time in his youth and who he rediscovered on his return to New York. Well, you get the idea. Definitely worth a pass unless you're fascinated with the effects of several intoxicants combined, the high and lows of the psychedelic experience and the seamy underside of Russian low life.
B002PQ7JQK|5.0|WE got this just in time to have a Star Trek marathon on Thanksgiving .  Great buy Love the series!
B007MC8YLQ|5.0|Plenty of challeges in this tough solitare game.  Good graphics and many options. If you generally like solitare try this one out. Free Cell is one of the more difficult solitare games to win, but the challenge is welcome as it takes a bit of the luck factor out.
B003P9VZ0W|5.0|My grand daughters are huge princess fans.  Their room is complete with this set. I can not believe how many stickers came with this set.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love the app for pinterest.  Much easier than the way I was trying to view pinterest.  Love the site also...
B001IBIHQ4|5.0|OUTSTANDING!! A real down to earth look at the history of my beloved Corps' during one of the toughest times in our long history. Well documented stories of true American HERO'S. A feeling of pride and sadness. Sadness in what must be done during war. And how it (war) can change a person forever.<br />Semper FI<br />Hap Smith Jr 2112<br />U.S.Marine Corps (retired)
B003VS0CXS|5.0|If you like movies from &#34;the good old days&#34; then this is for you.  I love musicals; I love Dick Van Dyke, and I love comedy, so I couldn't go wrong.  I am trying to get a library of musicals and plan to watch them with my grandchildren.  In my personal opinion, they far exceed the video games children spend their lives immersed in nowadays.
0800141849|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite movies with Barbara.  She wrote, starred and directed this movie.  I have seen it a dozen times.
B008M9PHWM|5.0|What could I possibly say to make you appreciate the this wonderful album? Very little, but if you have listened to other Bob Dylan albums you may be a fan you may not be as well. I have been thrown a loop whenever I hear a new Bob Dylan album. Something new and beautiful is waiting to be taught to us through this living icon. I can promise you a way words have been used that are completely original and the story will never seem to go the way you might think it will.
B005HSL626|3.0|It's like beating up fruit because  when u play the game it looks like there beating u up &amp; u fight back
B00EJYGL8S|5.0|As a long-time fan, I really enjoyed this album by The Piano Guys. I also liked the refurbished tracks from previous albums, particularly Winter Wind, which is even better with the cello additions. I bought the digital copy, and I don't think I'm missing anything with the DVD, which seems to be mostly made up of videos I can get on YouTube. I'd be more interested if there was exclusive video content.
B001NLKSI4|5.0|This is the second JB novel I have read and I couldn't be sadder that none are left for me to consume quicker than my eyes could move. He took me into everything I loved in the first Wolf book to much greater and wildly amusing detail. I couldn't be taken out of his story telling. At 22 all you want to know is how to make it big and Jordan Belfort did. He is a story teller and even if his writing isn't sophisticated it is more entertaining than any sophisticated author. This movie will be the highlight of my movie going year that usually consists of two flicks. This one with Leo (the way I visualized Belfort) has a story for an Oscar and I'm going right back to page one of the first book. Pond scum!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My Grandson's (4 & 6) Love this game!  The older one asked me to download it and then the little guy started playing too.  I have 2 Kindles, works out great when they come to visit!
B00499QUK2|5.0|Excellent show.  Watched the whole first season in one night and season two the next day. Can't wait for season three
B00881VLCE|4.0|Great fun! I love being able to use my own photos, everyone gets a kick out of seeing themselves in a puzzle. The only problem is that it freezes sometimes.
B002QH2NUA|5.0|excellent! songs are in tune and great to play along with. Does it get any better? a must have for Beatles fans
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|Lovely game. Time consuming but still very good. The first levels are very fast and but then it slows down
147676459X|5.0|Allie Brosh makes me laugh and cry, often all at once. She's smart, perceptive, and original.  Really, the book is just utterly wonderful.
B00AA36RZY|5.0|&#34;Now it all makes sense!&#34; - that should be the mantra of this book in terms of learning to understand Design Patterns. It is absolutely the best way to learn and UNDERSTAND the whats and whys of software development using Design Patterns. I recommend starting with this book, read it and use it from cover to cover, then you will be ready for the Gang-of-Four and all other advanced materials on this subject.
0273710516|5.0|I bought this book around the time I started working as an ERP Consultant at Google. This is the best &#34;how to write for business&#34; book I have read. I have read this book twice and will probably read it many more times. I used what I learned in this book to write business requirements documents (BRD) and functional and technical documents (FDTD). The overriding concept is &#34;logic in writing&#34; and the author shows how we think in a &#34;pyramid structure&#34; and why our writing should have this pyramid structure. The second part of the book goes into &#34;logic in thinking &#34; which is also great though a little dense.<br />This book is worth the money you spend on it - it SHOULD BE REQUIRED READING FOR EVERY CONSULTANT and PRODUCT MANAGER.<br />Along with Strunk and White's Elements of Style this book is a perfect one-two punch for anyone who wants to read 2 books on how to write for business.
B00G3Q6VPS|5.0|This album is just great, i wasnt expect somthing interesting since Femme Fatale, but this one is just GREAT, The Vocals (yes shes actually singing), the BEAT, you have ballads, you have electro, you have pop, is like you mix all britney albums and get better.
B009NQKXYK|3.0|run of the mill entertainment.  This is a formula film, the acting is good, the action is good, and it passes the time.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|SUCH A GREAT PRODUCT I LOVE HOW IT PROJECTS WHAT'S ON MY LAPTOP OR TABLET OR PHONE, ONTO MY TV IS JUST SO AWESOME!
B003WMA7BU|3.0|This may be one of those rare instances when the tale told in the movie exceeds that of the book it originated from. That's not to say, however, that James Sallis' book isn't worth reading; it is. It's a quick-paced, different kind of read, one that highlights--perhaps even champions--an underworld of criminals and those who play by their own rules.<br /><br />Both the book and movie begin in the midst of intense, riveting action, yet there's a constant, slow-burning buildup to both that is mysterious, as if something bad is going to happen at every left turn. The main character, labeled in the book as \\"Driver,\\" is perhaps less likable in Sallis' book than in the movie, but, just like in the flick, he's cool. Driver is an astute, observant, off-the-radar-of-life Hollywood stunt driver who would rather drive criminals away from getaway scenes than be in movies. He likes the excitement, and the pay is probably better. In a parallel world, he may have made a great detective.<br /><br />Crime books like this are great when a job gets bungled and the excitement and backstabbing kicks in. Sallis forgoes throwing in a clich&eacute;d love interest and refuses to give anyone involved in the story a huge break for the typically magical Hollywood ending. This is real life, and these are real people with tough backgrounds. No big breaks are forthcoming.<br /><br />Sallis intersperses the breakneck pace of the book with jabs at mainstream society, from canned classic rock music--our protagonist prefers authentic smooth jazz--to silly \\"Judge Judy\\"-type TV courtroom shows where everyone looks idiotic and desperate. His characters are arty but hardened; isolated but part of like-minded individuals who run underground; deep thinkers who aren't afraid to threaten and come through on their dire promises. These guys are outsiders, independent and often illegal. Their lifestyles entail late-night drinks of the alcoholic or caffeinated variety, sleeping whenever they want, always looking for the next big score. Despite their uninhibited badness, however, there is something inherently human, perhaps even humane, about them, as they strive for at least some of the same things we all do.<br /><br />As good as Sallis' storyline is, the book is not as focused as the movie. It's choppy, especially toward the end, and in some cases more depth would have been nice. Where Sallis has the edge, though, is in the poignant messages he writes. Just try not being moved by a line like: \\"Life sends us messages all the time--then sits around laughing over how we're not gonna be able to figure them out.\\"te their uninhibited badness, however, there is something inherently human, perhaps even humane, about them, as they strive for at least some of the same things we all do.

B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|This story grabs you from the first paragraph and holds your interest until the last sentence. Jake Brigance is a few years older and several of the characters from A Time To Kill are also in this sequel. You won't want to put it down.
B00AZRBLHO|1.0|I got this book because so many people recommended it.<br />I kept dragging myself to continue reading. Reached Chapter 17 and then couldn't take it anymore.<br />In my opinion I think it's a complete waste of time. I prefer getting right to the point, but this is supposed to be a novel so it isn't meant to get to the point quickly. And the ideas you get out of it, aren't things you haven't read before on ITSM blogs etc. (again as far as I got, since I stopped at chapter 17).<br /> It also wasn't entertaining at all. It isn't a page turned, I really had to put in effort to continue reading. How entertaining can it be to read about IT? So the authors had a huge challenge to start with.<br /><br />Anyway, it wasn't for me. Maybe others like that style, I don't.
B00AYPXG5W|5.0|Not sure how much actually happened and how much was total fiction but it was entertaining. Even my wife enjoyed it and she doesn't go for sci-fy.
B00FEMJF6O|3.0|Fun game but still just a clone of the 50 others just like it. Someone needs to get creative for once
B00ARF93AQ|2.0|Not even close to the original. Very hard to follow and the ending was rather dumb. Did the newbie actually quit? You tell me, I watched the end twice and have no idea.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|this pops up after you finish the book. It's perfect.. It's been my favorite book for a long time. I've just reread it for about the nine hundredth time.
B00EJYGL8S|5.0|What can I add that hasn't been said by other reviewers?? Just that if you enjoy The Piano Guys and their music, you simply can not pass this by! I love their take on my favorite Christmas songs and will be playing this cd and dvd all month and possibly beyond!
B000XUBFE2|5.0|The Book Thief is well written and eloquently narrated. It follows the life of a pre-pubescent German girl and her trials and triumphs as a foster child in pre- WWII Germany. The circumstances and people in her life are realistic and easily recognizable as would occur in anyone's life. You know Liesel, you feel her as a friend, a daughter, as someone of conviction who has a strong and determined heart. I love this book!
B00BB8UJKG|2.0|Amazon can't support the video.  After half an hour, all I could get was an error from Amazon 1001:3222.  This error persisted through the entire time I had left to view the video.  It can't be software, because the system performed beautifully for the first half hour.
B00E9A656K|5.0|I love it because you can rashly loom and stuff so ya I haven't really played this game before I just wanted you gyes to see this woo ya!
B00DJ4PIBK|5.0|Love the idea, the little projects are cute, it's a great way to count down to Christmas.  My five year old loves it!
B000QRIGLC|5.0|Words cannot describe the emotion put into this book. I could not put it down. Do yourself a favor and read this book
B00AZRBLHO|5.0|Very important book for any business person who thinks IT is important to their business, or any IT person who thinks they want to be more important to their business.  It is obvious why all the tech companies, who inherently &#34;get this&#34; are outpacing all the old IT organizations in businesses.  At the core is the simple concept of doing 10 deployments a day.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Great characters and great story.  It made me want to read more about WWII.  I can't wait to read part III.
B00EJYGL8S|5.0|I have always enjoyed the Piano Guys and their music. As it is now Christmas I am extremely excited about this album. I just purchased it and I love it! I hope it does very well!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|The first app to install after the built in Android apps. Also install the Windows application. Perfect for remembering everything.
B0057UA4FY|1.0|The Amazon marketplace seller advertised this as the DVD format, but sent a Blu Ray format set of discs instead.  This was a huge nightmare because we only had a portable DVD player for a 5-hour car trip!
B006LR0XLM|5.0|This is my number two app to install on all my devices (behind Evernote but only by a little).<br /><br />Everybody and their cousin seems to have a cloud service but Dropbox is a great choice if all you want to do is have files available at any time from any where.
B00005LOUQ|5.0|I absolutely love this movie and watch it throughout the year! By far my favorite Christmas movie, wish there was a Whoville in real life!
B005D9MUWY|5.0|For ease of use, word prediction, choice of keyboards, customization, SwiftKey can't be beat. Make sure to follow the instructions when installing in order to properly replace the Google keyboard.
B008NCSZQ8|4.0|The first half was kinda slow; rounding everyone up, arguing, trying to prove who is boss, not trusting one another. But then things finally start to get interesting the last part of the movie! Sweet! I love when the hulk smacks Thor's brother around like a rag doll! So much for being a god!
B00EJYGL8S|5.0|You can never have enough from The Piano Guys, so what could be better than The Piano Guys at Christmas time? Nothing! I'm thoroughly delighted with these beautiful arrangements. It's always uplifting inspiring to hear the way the music ties together all the fun that their new creative style brings and the cheer, tenderness, and beauty of the classics.
B0077EBWVI|3.0|fun movie! Don't like the bad racer boyfriend or any of his scenes... but I do like how the main boy has values and lives them!
B000QRIGLC|5.0|A triumphant story of one man's faith and courage over impossible odds and circumstances. Brings home the point of the sacrifices our troops make. A debt that can never be repaid!!
B00B5HQLMI|3.0|Creepy bad guy, sad ending, crazy beginning. I liked how certain people stepped up when they were needed! But he seemed unprepared and running on his toes most of the movie; he does amazing with the little he has to work with, but you'd think he would've brought some weapons with him when he picked up the nice ride? Come on now. Casino Royal is still my favorite!
B001AQO3QA|5.0|I simply love the Alien movies so there is not really much I can say. The product is nicely packaged and the commentaries are great.<br />The sound and image are perfect.
B007IK44CK|4.0|On edge, still does his breath-holding jumps and stunts! They always think of crazy new fight areas and stunts that haven't been used before! Pretty fun
B003719GGS|5.0|Very applicable. I'm single and dating, and it is nice to know why I like certain girls more than others, and why certain girls like me more or less than other guys they've dated. A must-read!
B007R11DKQ|3.0|It would be a good movie to watch around Halloween, with all of the murdering, creepy changes, and killing witches... The captain is my favorite character! Has some funny heart warming parts, but also a lot of creepy and awkward parts.
015603008X|5.0|Great read! Also came in great condition.  It was all I expected and more, the story itself too is kind of sad...just saying.
0920668364|5.0|Having raised my children and moving into 'Grandma' mode, I can see that this book has as much to say to the new mommy as it does the growing child.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I LOVE,THIS BOOK!  It was my favorite of all the books.  I hope the movie hurt us out .  I give it a 5!
B00B1E6FF8|5.0|This movie fascinated me.  It seems to be the only documentary (nearly or actual) of the capture of Osama Bin Laden.  This maneuver is of extreme interest to me because it seemed needed since the time of &#34;911.&#34;
B00BD99JMW|4.0|I enjoyed all three books but I wanted more depth, more story. Tris and Tobias were written to much in the same style.
B00AZMFO9U|4.0|This was an interesting movie directed by Dustin Hoffman.  It was about a house owned by Gustave Verdi and occupies by destitute, aging musicians.  I did not find the movie as interesting - it was more a comedy than a biographical story.
B00AKOB7CG|5.0|Good workout with clear instructions. Can be adapted to all fitness levels. I would recommend to anyone who wants a good cardio workout.
B005LAIIQC|5.0|This movie, like the Die Hard movies, is a series I watch repeatedly.  I never tire of it and the breakneck action is fascinating.  Matt Damon who plays Jason Bourne in the Bourne Trilogy was not in this fourth movie.
0345803507|5.0|Loved the Fifty Shades series, very well written and very erotic. Would recommend both men and women read this series.
B0033AI41G|5.0|I liked the story about a West Virginia native since I live in West Virginia.  It is not typical of the life of most West Virginians.  The music by Charlotte Church was inspiring as was the story of the life of a schizophrenic who won the Nobel Prize in mathematics.  I thought the role played by Jennifer Connelley was outstanding.
0399226907|5.0|great story book for both my grandsons. it is timeless in simplicity, but very artful and colorful. love all the things about this book.
B0034G4P7Q|3.0|It was interesting to watch but not memorable.  I have not watched it after the first viewing.  It has a sophisticated aura but there were no outstanding principles espoused in it.
B00EF1PKJQ|5.0|isn't she the greatest?!!!<br />i can just sing & play harmonica along to all these sweet sad songs<br />try her, you'll like her
B003IWZ1D8|5.0|It is a movie I saw in a theater when it was first released.  I think Anthony Perkins is an interesting actor.
B004469BQA|5.0|Excellent album though I'm biased as I love pretty much every Joe Satriani has done.  Well, not &#34;Gnahhh&#34; or whatever it's called.  That song just doesn't work for me.
B00BUADSMQ|5.0|This is a good movie - I like all of the Die Hard movies and the character portrayed by Bruce Willis.  I watch these movies repeatedly.  I never seem to tire of seeing them.
B00G3Q6VPS|5.0|Britney Spears' 8th album was written for her &#34;diehard&#34; fans and 15 years later she is still bringing fresh new sounds and changing up her style. Her versatility is the main reason why she has been at the top of her game since 1998. I know many fans were expecting Blackout 2.0 but there is no way that it could have been recreated without Spears in the Executive Producer seat. This album definitely has some autotune heavy tracks but holds quite a few surprises that highlight her voice. My favorites in order of preference are: Alien, Til It's Gone, Work Bitch, Now That I Found You, Body Ache, Tik Tik Boom, Hold On Tight, Perfume, Chillin With You, Brightest Morning Star, Don't Cry, Passenger and It Should Be Easy. This is the first album since Blackout that I have not felt the need to skip any tracks and I was not really a fan of &#34;Why Should I Be Sad&#34; or &#34;Perfect Lover&#34;. I would recommend this album to anyone that has been a fan of hers since the beginning or those who are looking for an album with equal mid-tempo and heavy bass dance tracks.
B00CE03UOC|5.0|very cool.  need to unwind at the end of the day with something challenging but not frustrating.  this is it.
B00DW39B2K|1.0|Unwatchable, luckily I rented this dog from my local library. Don't waste your time on this drivel, and that's the truth.
B00CHCUR9I|5.0|I absolutely love this! I'm not new to the series, but on the kindle is great! Also, it's more affordable for lower income people like me. Thank you for putting this series on here!
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|It keeps you going just when you think it is the same old thing it takes off in another direction and you have to find out what happens next.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|This is fun challenging game to play and I'm up to any challenge I recommend playing this is you are a bring or persistent because it is perfect for people who love mlp
B001ECQ4HG|5.0|Any review I write for this is totally biased since this is one of my favorite movies. In fact, I have the tattoo that Clarence gets tattooed on myself. So yeah, I could go on and on about this film but suffice it to say: the movie is so good I tattooed it on myself. Buy it.
B00001W9G0|5.0|A classic!!! This is a soft spoken movie, I had to turn the volume all the way up so I can hear everything.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|Love love love Veronica Roth!  What a talented author!  And I cant wait for the movie!  I really enjoyed this third book and like the first two read it very quickly, not wanting to put it down.  Yes the ending was extremely shocking and sad.  In fact I went back and reread that part twice to make sure what I thought had happened actually did!  No maybe it wasnt how I wished it ended but it did not take away from the fact that I still feel the story was well written and dramatic and enjoyable.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|It was the best book I have ever read!!!!! If liked Divergent then you are going to love the mortal instruments!!!!
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|I had heard good things about this app. The downloaded file was corrupted and there is no link to a drepeatdownload. Amazon simply tell me I have already downloaded it. Very disappointing.
B00B52F278|5.0|I love this series,  it gives a good taste of life, and battle, in ancient times.  The gore is exaggerated and makes it better than true realism.  It is a bit vulgar and a fair amount of skin is shown, but that is probably true to the times.
B00BRUPICM|3.0|For the price of the Kindle version, it is not worth the cost.  The author did not have a flow with the words in any sentence<br />structure. Graphic details may interest only a few readers.  I think most of us would rather have a good story line that has<br />an even flow.  This story was jerky.
B00006RCNJ|5.0|I returned this to Amazon as I already had a copy.  But initially,  I felt a bit sorry for Andre it was a bit like drawing teeth. The audience sat watching without showing any enthusiasm. I should have known Andre would soon have them dancing in the aisles. Me of little faith.
B00FGFVMGA|5.0|Great little game. Not very long, but for free app of the day, I can't complain! Would like more games like this!
B001IF277K|5.0|The phone is Alive again! Well over a week on standby. Great item for any X10 which you thought had bit the big one.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|I enjoyed this book, but it ran on a bit long for me. I gave the first two 5 stars, so I certainly think they are all worth reading, this one included.<br /><br />Interesting and compelling books that consider humanity, what damage really means, group psychology, and more.
B00F2362IE|5.0|I purchased this app for my 5 year old niece and 3 year old nephew. My nephew is a huge TMNT fan, he has all the videos and he was Leonardo for Halloween. The graphics on the game are great and its easy for them to play, but they don't understand why they can't play different turtles and I totally agree with them. If the game were free and characters needed to be unlocked I would understand. But a $3.99 game should have the basic characters unlocked. They like the game but they're not very good so they don't get a lot of coins each run and I'm afraid they'll lose interest before I can unlock more characters. Update 4/27/2014 I used the $5 free credit Appstore promo to unlock the other Turtles. That, combined with the update that added the van have given new life to the game. They love it! I do have to sit with them when they play to let them know what's happening with all the new Accomplishments or when the game asks if they want to sign in to Game Circle but that's not a big deal. Good job, Nickelodeon!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|The true Constant Reader always wants more at the end of the story...just one more page of epilogue.  Doctor Sleep gives another volume to quell that thirst left at the end of The Shining - and then some.  In his efforts to slake my thirst, King has only exacerbated the need...
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|This is by far the best show on TV besides Scandal.  Very graphic and scary.  My wife and I love it.
B00957T6X6|5.0|Regarding the story itself, great - well-written, engaging, a touch of the historical with a touch of magic besides.  Incredibly complex story line, but quite rewarding if you stick with it.  The scope of what Martin has written is astounding.<br /><br />Regarding the Kindle multi-book set, I've seen a number of negative reviews, stating things like the pictures aren't zoom-able, the price is outrageous, or navigation is difficult within the Kindle version of the boxed set.  I don't understand these at all - perhaps they were reviews left quite some time ago?<br /><br />I'm loving this series, and am quite happy with the Kindle version of the 5-book set.  I'm able to quite easily navigate to the exact phrase I want in whichever book I want, and have more than once found right where I left off in a paper version.  The maps are indeed zoom-able to several levels.  For me, the price was right at $9.99 for the set - maybe this was higher earlier when the series was all the rage?<br /><br />Don't know what all the fuss is about - I think this is great.
159463176X|5.0|A heart-wrenching follow-up to Dr. Hosseini's beloved THE KITE RUNNER and A THOUSAND SPLENDID SUNS, AND THE MOUNTAINS ECHOED tells the story in microcosm of a few of the largest population of displaced persons in the world, the Afghan diaspora, in a very accessible and compassionate way.  Highly recommended for those who are, care about, do not understand, or do not care about the Afghan people.
B00DNV9V1W|3.0|I wasted one of the protectors because it didn't have one of the peeling stickers that I needed to take off in order to install the protector. When I set the other one was perfect. my protector has some scratches but my screen doesn't so, thanks so much!!
B000P6YNSE|5.0|Greatest show ever.  You are missing out if you have ne er watched it.  Could not talk it up enough.  Best thing to be on TV.
B00EJYGL8S|5.0|what a great CD and it is so fun to watch the videos on the DVD. These guys are masters.
B00F2362IE|1.0|It froze every time my kids tried to play and kept saying it was &#34;Loading&#34; for hours on our Kindle Fire.
B00GH4RKYM|3.0|A real disappointment.  Lead actor was not at all believable as Superman & the plot was convoluted & not compelling.  I fell asleep 1/2way through...
B004498KPU|5.0|I love this DVD. It have all the videos Michael ever make. It have 3 DVD's. My daughter love it. I do recommend it. Amazon have the perfect price.
B00001ZWTT|1.0|The great Ross Martin is flipping in his tomb, he's flipping off the producers of this monstrosity. The only way a film can be this bad is to do it on purpose-with millions of dollars to flush down the toilet and somehow be able to write it all off on taxes. The man with his hand on the flusher was none other than Will Smith, who when he was cast, racism had to be wrote into the script. Mel Gibson was considered, but Patrick Swayze would have been perfect. Swayze was near Conrad's size, was good at martial arts, and a very good actor. Will Smith fans don't care if his movies are any good, they just show up to see him-because he is so &#34;likeable&#34; and for some reason they like to chew bubblegum and text message all the way through each and every one of his blockbusters. Why has this not showed up on mystery science theater 3000? It is because more people have seen the Gamera flying turtle movies than have seen this (no disrespect intended for floppy rubber turtles swinging from piano wire).
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|This is the beast game on my kindle fire. I recommend it to my 20 year old cousin he loves it . I would give it infinite stars if I could .I recommend this game to seven and up .&lt;&laquo;&raquo;&gt; peace out :)
B00009P1O2|5.0|simply legendary!<br />after 25+ years still one of the most electrifying concert of ever! Recommended for all those who could not be there
B00C5R7B0I|4.0|While some of the more recent Scarpetta tales have meandered a bit far afield, this latest harkens back to the days when it was just her, Lucy, Benton & Marino, following the twists & turns  as they race to identify & stop the really bad guys from continuing on their sick murderous rampages.  Using cutting edge technology, it still takes all their combined investigative skills to unravel untruths that have been covered up by ever increasing and elaborate lies at the highest levels. Enjoy the  ride.
1451666179|5.0|Both the writing and artwork that Allie creates for her stories are superb. It was pretty much a given I'd buy this book after reading her website for free for three years. I think I might buy a couple more as Christmas presents for people, too.
B00FR0GT9Y|1.0|Sorry, but this is a very disappointing release after 10 years between records.  I would characterize this as a collection of ballads with not one up tempo song on the entire cd.  The sound seems manufactured and it may be due to the use of drum machines.  I&#34;m a long time Boston fan but they need to get back to the roots of the first two albums which is what fans want.  Tom, I expected much more from you and you didn't deliver.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|I've played this game a lot on PC and the mobile version of it works just the same - plus you get even more towers and more levels. I can't wait to try co-op on it.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I LOVE THIS GAME! I saw my mom playing it on Facebook and wanted to play it so badly. I really love it because of the candy and difficulty of the levels. Will definitely get for kids!
B00GUJP9PG|1.0|I tried downloading it but it says a error while downloading it and I just spent 3 bucks on it what do I do?????
B005IDXIL2|3.0|Ball is hard to track, occasionally seems to go a different direction than intended. Scoring is OK, game is easy to see and loads pretty fast.
B005T87QCI|1.0|Purchased this back in September.  My 5 year old loves it!  We purchased the Build Your Own Robot at that time also and it worked, for a while.  Then suddenly it was gone?!  Not worrying too much about it we didn't do anything about it (we were going to buy him the All In One pack for $11.99 anyway).  We decided as an early Christmas gift we would get him the All In One pack.  So, I purchased it today 12/3/13.  Where are the robots I paid for?!  I just purchased the ALL IN ONE $11.99 pack, got the confirmation email saying I purchased it, but wouldn't you know, none of the robots are available!  You just devastated a young boy who was looking forward to playing this game with all the robots and being able to build his own....  I try to be unbiased in my reviews but I have to say with the Build Your Own Robot purchase suddenly not working and this experience I have to warn people and give this game a 1 out of 5 just for the basic loss of money.
0152465030|5.0|We love reading this book over and over and over! It was one of my favorites as a child and it's one of my children's favorites!  I hope we can pass this on for many generations.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|A definite page turner! This sequel to The Shining tells the trials and tribulations of the now grown Danny Torrence. There are several surprises and twists in King's novel that I could not put it down, anxious and wanting to know what happens next.  Danny's gift is used to help a child defend the greter good against an evil clan wanting to suck the power of shiners to prolong their lives. I love the fact that King ties up all possible loose ends and quenches his readers' thirst for the &#34;Whatever happened to Danny in The Shining,&#34; question that's been in the back of their minds for years.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is challenging and addicting.  If you strive towards goals, this game is for you.  Having a lot of fun.
B00BAXFCPO|5.0|Eye opening book.  Highly recommend it, especially for those affected by Alzheimers Disease.  This of course already made complete sense to me as a person following a Paleo diet and rejecting the Standard American Diet (SAD).
B00GOZQ2E8|5.0|Very fun game. Love the graphics. Makes it look 3d when you are playing the game. Recommend giving the game a try.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I am speechless. Just finished this truly amazing story of fiction and fact. I can't say more right now.  Markus Zusak is gifted beyond the words that have been written.
B00EKR61FM|5.0|It has everything you could ask for: The movies themselves, and tons of special features. The book the DVDs come in is in itself a special feature, and a must-have for Twilight fans.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|fun game. makes me want to go hunting bad. will play this all the time. killing white tails all day!
B00B0LPYXG|5.0|Enjoyed the movie -- that ends with an unexpected twist.  Not so much about the flight itself, but about people, real human beings, not just &#34;heroes&#34;.
B004K00NMG|5.0|Ok, just to get this out there: this movie is straight up a historical fiction.  This is not a docudrama, dramatized history, or whatever non-fiction derivatives there are.  But with that said, this was a brilliant film with a truly complimentary set of &#34;extras&#34; thrown in.  This being their first animated theatrical feature, 20th Century fox definitely shows their pride through the package of this film.<br /><br />CONTENT ISSUES:<br />Ok, this is definitely a family film.  No innuendos or nudity type stuff, no language issues...this is a safe film.  There is violence, but it is well-purposed and not all that vicious.  What I will say, though, is that the villain, Rasputin, can be kinda scary for young kids.  In many ways, his visual presentation is a bit more horrifying/intimidating than most if not all Disney villains out there.  So I would wait for kids to at least be around 10 years of age (as a general suggestion).  But, again, totally nothing to worry about.<br /><br />PLOT (ABSOLUTELY NO SPOILERS):<br />I won't discuss plot points and things, but will just give a general impression.  I really did enjoy the narrative that was told.  It's nothing too complexed but it is told well and presented well.  It definitely is pretty straight forward.  Ultimately, I felt satisfied and complete.  Actually, I felt refreshed and warm fuzzies haha  But, though it was very very well done, I have to say, they really could have slowed down a bit and explored a little more of the ambience.  I would have loved to see more of the happenings in Russia and in Paris.  I would have loved to explore more of the ambient aspects of their train ride.  The film really followed a blatantly point-A-to-point-B kind of storytelling.  I AM DEFINITELY NOT SAYING THIS IS A  TERRIBLY BAD THING, AT ALL.  Again, it was good, but a little more &#34;looking around&#34; instead of rushing through would have been a wonderful way to greatly enhance the tale.  But, the character interaction really makes this film...especially the main 3.<br /><br />MUSIC:<br />Yes, this is a musical...and it's this part that really helps make this tale, fly.  I loved all the numbers except for one...and the music was smartly written, well placed, led up to in a believable manner.  If you want a good taste, the song &#34;Once Upon a December&#34; is really the musical keystone of the film.<br /><br />EXTRAS:<br />I won't list all of them, since they are already listed in the main product description area.  All of them are excellent and fun little additions (though I think the stacking doll game could have been a little more &#34;entertaining&#34;).  But I would like to draw special attention to the &#34;making of&#34; mini-documentary.  This is, by far, one of the best &#34;making of&#34; mini-documentaries that I've seen included with a film or tv series and should be a standard for such things.  Often times, other ones simply touch and grace the various aspects of the production process.  But, here, they go into greater depth.  Not only do you hear about &#34;experiences&#34; and &#34;opinions&#34; from the staff, but they take you through the animation process, the voice over/singing process, and a whole ton of other things, as well.  It's not as good as a more focused documentary in say Discovery or Smithsonian....but they really take you much deeper than most DVD Extras type documentaries I have personally seen.<br /><br />ALL IN ALL:<br />This is a wonderful film for the whole family.  A lot of wonderful lessons and fun interactions.  Also, strong acting as well.  It may be a bit more straightforward than some of would like, but for me, that did not ruin the experience at all.  And the music was simply wonderful.  I do think that this film comes fairly close to being a classic in animated movies, just my opinion of course.  Either way, I hope you take it for a spin and that you'll enjoy this gem, as well.makes this film...especially the main 3.<br /><br />MUSIC:<br />Yes, this is a musical...and it's this part that really helps make this tale, fly.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|I really enjoyed the book. I found myself smiling and frowninglghing a loud gettin mad and wanting to cry while reading. I felt the emotion in the book as if it were real. I loved the book.i ave already recommended it to so many people. Now on to book #2!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|My wife and 3 boys all love this game.  They love &#34;getting&#34; new horses and finding way to earn points through competitions.  Kind of a surprising find.
B000N2HCKQ|5.0|This book puts sticky ideas in everyone's hands for personal use, relationships and business use. It's brilliant and makes so much sense that it's easy to remember. I find myself thinking of it throughout the day when I see or hear someone attempting to make a point and missing or making an excellent point whether or not they did it on purpose. It's a must-read for people in business!
B00CE03UOC|5.0|very addictive game.  As you play, you start to see the general patterns.  Fun for all ages from 5 to 40 in our house.
B0014JIFWG|4.0|as a student at the Culinary Institute of America, I am constantly on my feet.  These shoes are super comfortable but after a semester they need to be replaced. All in all I will Definitely be buying another pair.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This app is grate for all ages and I am not being payed this is a fun app!!!!!!!! An f2f it is really free
B00FATEJYE|5.0|These game is the best it gets hard later on it gets easy I'm happy that someone told me about it
B00F2362IE|4.0|The game is really fun but there's allot of loading involved and it would be better if you could pick a different character each time.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|ColorNote works great. I have no issues with it whatsoever. It's not difficult to use and keeps me on task.
B00FATEJYE|5.0|It the best game I had so far and its pretty cool. It's really close to the original game and the only thing is the graphics.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Fun game but frustrating when you move up in levels and have to wait for someone to give you a ticket. But still fun and challenging
B007SZ0E1K|4.0|Excellent processor of course, the only downside really is it comes with a lousy CPU mount. Yawn, no one that buys this is really going to use it as it isn't good for overclocking which most people that buy this are going to do. So that's my only complaint as it should have an option to buy it without the fan to keep the cost down.
B003OFVIXG|5.0|This young lady is a must have in your collection should you like French music. A fresh mix, ran it on repeat play for the first 2 days.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|This is addicting me and only because i love hidden objects. I pay this game almost everyday, the only thing I hate is that I run out of energy quick.
B004ZJZQJC|5.0|This is a classic movie and even better now in blu-ray! Which child has not dreamed of<br />fighting in space or defending against asteroids. This puts all those desires into a movie<br />format...
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|fun for all ages. my kids play now I cant put it down. fight for game time! I am bigger then them.. lol
B000TGJ8AS|5.0|Living in an area without cable and poor Satellite reception, I watch DVDs of series that I can no longer get.  This is a good series with likeable characters and current plots.
1451666179|5.0|This is so damn enjoyable. I plowed right through, giggling the whole way. The rudimentary drawings are so perfect. And there's so much truth in here. I'll be honest: I'm a therapist, and I've read sections to clients more than once in the last few weeks since reading this. The one called Thoughts and Feelings is my favorite, but when I think of the simple dog with shapes in the thought bubbles, I laugh instantly.
B00371XIJE|5.0|Incredible how the simple love of a dog for his owner instills so many deep rooted feelings of loyalty and love. Dogs mirror our soul , especially after the death of a loved one. People feel it, and dogs live it. Must see even if you're an animal lover or not.
B000FBJHZS|4.0|A good read and an interesting concept but not up to his other stuff.  Several of his other books were glued to my hand, this one not so much.  I guessed the bad guy long before the end.  Sorry, Dan.
1439102813|5.0|Read this book for our church book club, where everyone seemed to like the book.  It opened up the topic of Alzheimer's disease and what it must be like for those families who are dealing with this illness in their daily lives.  Despite its topic, which is sad at best, I found the book helped us to understand better the emotions and frustrations that Alzheimer's patients (and their loved ones) must feel at the early and mid stages of their disease, and so allowed us a way to be more supportive and understanding of those persons within our congregation who are currently in various stages of this disease.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|Difficult to set up with iPhone and iPad. Worked for a couple of days. Now I am unable to cast (stream videos) from you tube. Will have to call google whose support was not the greatest in the first place. Buyer beware
B008MG1E4A|3.0|The book was worth the time to read to get the perspective of the people involved in the mission. I thought the author was a bit condescending bordering arrogant with his description of his training, prior missions and tools used. Sounded more like he was trying to impress a girl at the bar rather than depicting his activities and experience. I also couldn't put the hypocrisy of his statement about &#34;SEALS don't want glory or recognition&#34; (or something like that) out of my mind. He got my $10 when I bought the book.<br /><br />Overall, the book was simplistic, but a fun easy read.
1465414444|5.0|It's called a visual guide but it's loaded with information and tons of lore I hadn't read before.  The artwork is fantastic, you'll recognize a lot of it from Hearthstone, Warcraft models, and the comics.  Every page is full graphics.  A really nicely put together book.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is too addicting!  I can't stop putting it down.  The only drag is that you have to either wait in between stages, or purchase lives.  I would recommend to anyone who is looking for a fun, casual yet addicting little mobile app.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Bought this book based on a recommendation from a friend.  Really great book that's easy to read.  I've been told its also very accurate on the military details.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Although I'm a fan of both sci-fi and YA dystopian lit, I had somehow never read this book. Based on what I had heard about it, I was expecting something more along the lines of Hunger Games. However, as I say in my review title, I think this is more Sun Tzu's Art of War than Hunger Games. I will say that I thoroughly enjoyed the book - I found it to be a real page-turner, and I truly grew to care for the main character Ender. It holds up both as a fun read and as thought-provoking literature.<br /><br />The sci-fi is more of a backdrop - the story takes place in a future earth that is threatened by an alien race, and young Ender is sent to train on space-age ships and weapons. His mock battles are described in detail, and sometimes require a lot of visualization to follow. If that's not your thing, or if you are looking for more sci-fi innovation or fantasy elements, this may not be your favorite book. Since I have studied martial arts and texts like Sun Tzu's Art of War, I found all of this fascinating. Both the psychology and strategy of battle and war are handled here, and through the training of Ender, powerful questions are posed about what price is paid to train warriors, what makes us human, and morality. I think the book also poses interesting questions about the dehumanizing nature of video games, and in that sense, even though this book is 25+ years old, it is completely relevant.<br /><br />So that's my take - as long as you are expecting the military/battle/strategy emphasis, you will probably love this book. It is a great story in any case.
B00EJYGL8S|5.0|So very classic, an instant family favorite that we have added to our Christmas music tradition. We absolutely love it!
B00FR0GT9Y|2.0|I wanted so badly to like this new Album.  I just can't get past the mix and the drums.  I have no idea how or why it took so long for this album to be made.  Tom's guitars sound good.  It has the Boston \\"sound\\" but the drums are terrible.  Not bad....terrible.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|This is a bit different than Upstairs Downstairs but the acting and production far exceeds those episodes.  It is amazing that this actual castle is still standing with all the beautiful interiors.  That along with the major actors and actresses make it outstanding.
B00EJYGL8S|5.0|Loved it! My favorite song is &#34;Let it Snow / Winter Wonderland&#34;. My one-year-old son starts bouncing his head in the back seat every time it comes on!  :)
B0063IH60K|4.0|I could play all day long...gets me through a boring day at work.  More I play the better day at the fire house...
B00BXI0IHS|4.0|Enjoyed the story. Much better than Eat, Pray, Love. Would have preferred a happier ending. I could visualize the story and the scenery-very good descriptives.
B0063M22QO|4.0|it's hard to put this one aside once you get the hang of it- kind of like trying to eat just one potato chip!
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|I really enjoyed this game but seemed alittle short for what I payed . Didn't get very far before you have to purchase. Still loved it!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Definitely love it. Works like a charm. I can stream anything I want from my browser now without having to deal with crap smart tv anymore.
B008P1EWIM|5.0|I added this app to my alarm clock application and now I have beautiful moving backgrounds that illustrate the current weather.  It shows current temperature,wind speed,pressure and forecast(short term and long term) all while showing time.  I can even set alarms.  It is large enough for me to see without my glasses.  I highly recommend this app and a small stand for the Kindle so you can stand it up on a nightstand.  This app even allows you to see the weather in other places in real-time.
B0051ANPZQ|4.0|What a wonder of a book. It is very well written and the research allowed for a very authentic story. I really appreciated how carefully the full nature of Aggie's disfigurement was presented. My nephew, a ten year old, was slowly, gently exposed to how mean people can be. I was pleased the the moral of the story is kindness.
B000TERG6S|5.0|Great artist I love the way the guitar sounds with Jesse cook. It's full of energy and he is really good at taking me to far away exotic places with his songs!
B005P1YCNK|5.0|Very practical tools to help you succeed! Easy to read and understand, great examples and just awesome! I would recommend it to anybody that has problems with being consistent.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|I absolutely love this game. The graphics are wonderful, I enjoy completing the quests and it is very addicting. One of the best games I have ever played.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So glad that this game is FINALLY on Kindle. I love it so much. If you stick it out, you don't have to buy the power ups. You eventually find the sweet spot.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|It is really great! high quality and low price. I have no reason don't give it a 5 star!<br />If you are looking for a Backpack just for camera and you don't want spend too much money. This is your choice.
B002LMV7TS|5.0|How can you not love the Grinch?? Jim Carrey is hysterical and the movie line is adorable. Fun for the entire family.
B005K17RU0|5.0|This is a very helpful app, and seems pretty accurate.  Easy to use and works well on my kindle fire hd.  Glad to have it.
B001E5CH0G|5.0|Who doesn't like Will Ferrell? His character is anoyingly lovable. Picture quality great. Fun! Will is great, Will is great!
B0087JTAKW|4.0|A moving, fascinating, compelling story of love, heartbreak, and hope as only Mitch Albom can tell it! A must read.
B0007LXPBI|5.0|If you are looking for a movie to watch with your tween daughter for &#34;movie night,&#34; this one is terrific.  It is so funny!  One can see that Lilo has talent.  We had an eight year old girl, a 21 year old girl, myself (the mom so MYOB about my age), and a guest over 40.  WE all laughed and laughed.
B009ZXT4BY|5.0|My daughter loved this demo so much that we purchased the game. We are pleased with this purchase. It has entertained her for hours.
B009NF54ZE|4.0|i m. liking this the further i go but it could be more risque. Jack looks like a lusty pirate. Why not let him be one. Still, I am having fun.
0307450570|2.0|It's ok but the price is way out of line but if you like Maratha then you will like this book. I thought it was not one of her better books.
B009NG1Q96|5.0|I couldn't put this book down. I read it so fast that I now must wait in anticipation for months for the third book. I rarely enjoy a character as much as Maxon. Looking forward to day dreaming of how this all will go.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|I love this game. In my opinion this game is for all ages. I just don't understand why l can't scan my pets... sometimes I lose the token or throw it in the garbage. I think you should get this game.
B004T4LUPW|5.0|Excellent calendar. Tried so many others first, but this is the best! Love the drag and drop to copy and the individual colors.
B00B8R1NP0|5.0|I never saw myself as a murder mystery kind of girl. I usually stick with nonfiction and am very particular about what I read in fiction, but this book I could not stop reading! I had it on my laptop as an ebook and have to admit I snuck away to the bathroom to finish it! It starts right away with a disgusting murder scene and just takes off from there. When a book makes me a little bit nauseous with its details, that’s a good thing. It means it affects me. As the mom of 5 who has seen all sorts of poop, vomit and blood, I am hard to affect! The gory details certainly satisfy, and there are some unbelievable plot twists, yet they work well and make sense. And you won’t believe who the killer is! Can’t wait for the next book in the series.
B001ANYDAO|5.0|I read this in three days while I waited for my wife to get read in the morning. The stories are very succinct and packed with information I would never have even thought about. I never knew anything about Bill Gates other that he started Microsoft with Paul Allen.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Reading a book about a child hero is always enjoyable, yet troubling. No adult wants to see a child grow up TOO fast, lest the child become blase about life. So it goes in this book. Ender grows up TOO fast for his own good, but fast enough for his war-mongering elders. The end is fitting and soothing, and makes the book worthwhile. Enjoy!
B007XF4J66|5.0|Great movie! I love the extras too!  The price was right so I decided to buy it and I have enjoyed it thoroughly.  The picture and sound are really good when you consider that age of the movie.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|What a great story and series! I enjoyed this series and would like to say that it is one of the best book series I have ever read. I will recommend it to everyone!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Super fun! Very addictive game to play and hard to put down once you start playing! I definitely recommend ti play.
B000LXQVA4|5.0|I have this at my house for when grand babies visit. My 5 month old granddaughter loved it so much that we sent one Las Vegas for her.
B00GP0G0IK|5.0|So far do good I like the game it's fun. Still working thru the &quot;free&quot; mode.  So far good a good game
B00CH3QLG0|5.0|Great music.<br />The only bad thing is that you only get 3/4 songs on each side of the LP !!
B00FATEJYE|5.0|....the cost.  Not sure how long it'll be fun without spending $. A nice addition to the console version.  Not sure why it was delayed.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|The game is fun until it times you out and you have to wait 18-20 minutes before you can play again, unless you BUY additional lives.  I don't consider that a totally &#34;free&#34; game.  I would rather see advertising that you can opt to skip and continue playing your game.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|A beautiful book, both heart wrenching and ghastly, but it digs in and lingers long after you finish it. Now I'll need to buy it in hardcover.
B003ITGPTA|4.0|The first one was totally and completely awesome, This one could never top it. But it was pretty good. There were a few sappy scenes, especially the ones with Rocco. Overall, the movie was worth renting and I love the pair of brothers and their guns. They have some stellar comedic moments and the new sidekick is hilarious as well.
B00122MWU6|5.0|This album was my introduction to the band, and I thoroughly enjoyed it.  The lyrics are somewhat comical, and the musicality is uniquely impressive.
B000AP04OM|5.0|This is my favorite movie.  The songs are classic and the behind the scenes stories are great to watch.  Things you would never have noticed otherwise.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|This book and the series were very good. The ending was unexpected and I wasn't quite sure if I liked it but, overall I loved this story.
B0007939NO|5.0|I love Gene Kelly and the story is good.  The wedding march is absolutely amazing.  I watch that scene over and over again.
B002WY65W4|5.0|I love this movie. Love it. There's nothing else that can be said. You need to watch it. One name to reel you in, Bill Murray.
B009TGODOK|1.0|Poor acting and plot and the whole male cast was weak. Mickey Mouse movies are better to watch and enjoy
B00EDY5KTA|4.0|Saw the movie, really liked the music.  The Deluxe CD has additional variations of some of the songs and some songs that never made it in the movie.  Almost like a behind the scenes audio take.  In fact the whole second CD are labeled mostly as demos, Karaoke or outtakes.  Definitely enjoyed the music, just note the 2nd CD mostly are variations of songs from the movie or songs that never made it into the movie.
B00B5HQLMI|4.0|I thought it was almost as good as the original ones.  It was a welcome relief after they really messed up several more recent ones.  Not perfect, but quite good.
B000MQC9H4|5.0|Funny Holiday farce written with these actors in mind. Two girls, one from California and one from England swap houses at Christmas due to relationship problems and end up finding more than a vacation from it all. Filled with hilarious dialogue and a great performance by Eli Wallach. Not really having anything to do with Christmas except the time frame it seems to have become a holiday film due to the message of life goes on and people find what they are not looking for sometimes.<br />  It's is a fun romantic comedy that guys and girls can enjoy because it covers several aspects of relationships; the widower, the used, the workaholic (hide feelings) and the normal.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|There isn't anything I can say that has not already been said, I am sure.  I like the program very much, but the end of Season 3 almost turned me totally against it.  However, that is not the subject of this review.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|An excellent writer and one of my favourites.  The first two of the trilogy explained some things about the two world wars which I hadn't really understood.
B00EJYGL8S|5.0|Absolutely wonderful! Great music for Christmas. Their talent is amazing! I listen to them all year long and see them in concert whenever I can!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|love this game! a lot of fun and getting rewards to boot! See how many your can get up on your first run!!!!
B006AX6ONI|5.0|Mark Cuban is sort of my business super-hero. I have a ton of respect for the guy and I just love what he does on Shark Tank. His book was very, very inspirational and motivation to me. I'm an entrepreneur who runs my own businesses in computer/IT consulting and web/cloud hosting, so a lot of his tech-related background in business was much aligned with what I'm doing myself.<br /><br />This book was a very fast read. I finished it from front to back within hours in the same sitting. It has no fluff which is great.<br /><br />His personality comes through in his writing, which is full of quick witted tips and strategies that shows just what type of personality it takes to become very wealthy in business. One of my many major take aways from one of his many tips was &#34;no sales, no company&#34;. Time to hire some salespeople for my businesses!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Just like playing Tribez! My son is not able to get the Tribez game on his kindle fire so he wanted to have ice age village instead!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|toooo much porn... story line is decent but not amazing. make sure to read this alone because itll def make u blush
B00992CF6W|5.0|He loves this game, he can play this either while we are driving to go somewhere or while we are waiting at the doctors office.
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|I'm a beginner backpacker. I got a real sense of the obstacles Cheryl faced on the trail.  I did not respect the personal choices Cheryl made but I respected her tenacity.  I  found it to be a fast read.:)
B0086700CM|5.0|Just like stampede run! a lot of fun! Just don't fall down... running is lot of fun and interesting to say the least and great waiting room occupy game!
B005GFPZYK|4.0|May he and his friend rest in peace. It is my opinion his murder was very convenient for some folks!
B007FEZQF8|5.0|Even if you aren't a fan of the show, the graphic novel stands tall on it's own two feet.  Great art, great story, and excellent dialogue make this a real page turner.
B008Y1YK9Y|3.0|The third movie is not as good as the first two, but over all entertaining and worth adding to my collection.
B009ZAY8MM|5.0|This is such a talented group of artists.  If you like great acapella, excellent harmonies, superb arrangements, and phenomenal beat-box, this is the group that sets the standard.  No instruments needed.
0385537131|5.0|Absolutely a page burner. Love he way he ha chosen characters from a time to kill, to nother level, deeper thought and the Segreagated South as it was in 1988 and most apparently continues today. I have recommended it to all of my famiy and friens for another fine Grisham read.
0446554995|5.0|I simply cannot get enough of Special Agent A.X.L. Pendergast.  A very dramatic and unexpected end (?) to the Helen Esterhazy Pendergast series.  I also ordered White Fire and finished it almost immediately.  Can't wait for the next book!
B000S1M9LY|1.0|Words cannot describe fully how much Wallace's &#34;writing style&#34; annoys me.<br /><br />It reads like the stream of consciousness of a spoiled 10th grader.<br /><br />I get that some people really connect with this book, however I found it to be one of the worst books I have ever read. I bet they hand this thing out at Guantanamo.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|it is true to the card game! fast paced, action moves fast, it is very good and i would recommend it to everyone!
B00EJYGL8S|5.0|Was given this CD for music to listen to as I study for exams. It is FANTASTIC music for any event or activity! Listening to it right now as I write a MASSIVE research paper, never felt more at peace.
B00G9BME3A|4.0|I did not see this movie, however I did notice that some \\"Guber\\" from amazon put the follow INCORRECT information under the title of the movie. This is a direct cut and paste from amazon as of 12/3/13:<br /><br />World War Z [Blu-ray 3D + Blu-ray]<br />Leslie Nielsen (Actor), O.J. Simpson (Actor), David Zucker (Director)   Format: Blu-ray<br />3.6 out of 5 stars  See all reviews (2,362 customer reviews)<br /><br />This is the 2nd movie I found that's screwed up the movie details. How did he difficult was it to miss such a significant detail? Naked Gun does not sound like World War Z. Someone please slap the dufus that did this. Also, I believe OJ was in jail when this movie was being filmed and Leslie Neilsen died 3 years ago.<br /><br />Update: Looks like someone has corrected the mistake. What's really strange, the link on my review still displays the wrong information:<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00G9BME3A B00G9BME3A]]
B00GX59QO2|4.0|It was funny; it kept my interest; it was a bit predictable, but I enjoyed it. Left open at the end for another one.

B00BPDR3F6|4.0|This is a well written engaging book which I could not put down, just a little depressing of a story line, or I would have given it 5 stars
B00AHTYGRW|5.0|This movie deserved best picture by far!  Amazing!  The story is so great that it's hard to believe is based on fact
B00EJYGL8S|5.0|We absolutely LOVE this CD!!  The music is incredible-we listen to their music every day!!  One of our favorites.  You will not regret getting this (along with all of TPG's CDs)  :D
B003V4AK8E|5.0|I could not stand the Dualshock 3 controllers so I had to get something more friendly to what I was used to.  This controller did the tick!  It works perfectly and has a great feel!  I did end up getting used to the Dualshock 3 however and now prefer them.  But this controller was no letdown.  Boom.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|Was worth the price and is very challenging. Lots of replay value which is something you don't see in an app game.
B0001WGDX0|5.0|I'm new to classical music so this might not be much help.  All I can say is that the quality is excellent and I really enjoy listening to it.
B00APACSJG|5.0|A good read by a master story teller-  L M Bujold adds another good yarn in the Miles Vorkosigan Saga
B000I186FW|5.0|say what you will about the Wachowski siblings,but they can direct and especially write very intelligent, intense, emotional and damn gripping story's. V for Vendetta and The first Matrix are their best films,even though they did not direct V for Vendetta. The story is so smart and really make's you think it gave my brain a workout, the first time I saw the movie in theaters just like the first time I saw the first Matrix. Hugo Weaving plays V to perfection, he is a hell of an actor and the fact that you never see his face adds to the intense nature of his acting. the fact that he has to do all his acting behind a mask and use body movements to really bring the character to life is a treat. Natalie Portman plays Evey and she gives a very strong performance and I love that she got her head shaved for the role even if they paid her to shave her head that's dedication to your art, cause women love their hair lol. john hurt is amazing as well he plays a cold sadistic dictator bastard to scary realism. there is not much action in the film but the action it does have is stylized and done very well with some cool knife and gun fights. this was my first review
B002XB0AC2|5.0|Beautiful figure, as are all of the XIII figures from Square Enix. The detail and coloring are very well done.
B003U6BE8I|4.0|Pretty good movie and special effects. Just make sure you read the book or even better, the audiobook first before you watch this movie...
B00EJYGL8S|5.0|I just bought it thanks to cyber monday deal! ;)<br />Piano guys have been my favorite musicians and everyone please buy their albums for awesome Christmas!
B002RSOTSM|5.0|One of the best films ever made! Jimmy Stewart's acting is brilliant and the chemistry with Grace Kelly is riveting.
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|This I got for my son as he is a Hobbit fan.  I am not so I am rating this on his opinion.  He was excited to have this on Blue-ray and really loved the movie.
0804162727|5.0|I give this Prima guide a hearty recommendation.  The hardcover / gold edged version I ordered is gorgeous.  The guide basically runs down the main game and all of the extra side quests.  There is a complete list of heart pieces and the little octopus things (forget their name) which are needed for item upgrading.  I didn't get into too much detail regarding the locations of the extras since I am playing through without the guide.  I mainly bought it as a nice collector's edition book to accompany my game, as well as offer a bit of assistance on my later plays through if I am trying to get 100% of all extras.<br /><br />There are several maps showing both worlds and the location of many treasures and other extras.
B008K8VDPU|4.0|It could be better. In my opinion most of the stuff has to be bought and is kind of complicated. I'm also upset that Amazon doesn't have Magic Piano in my opinion it's much better.
0800141660|5.0|Jane Austen can go no wrong in my book!  The DVD was in good shape with no problems when it arrived.
B00EQ0CKRQ|5.0|It's great it's addicting and exciting. I would say a must have game to challenge with friends. Or just to play single in player career.
B005KJZDW6|5.0|Love the feel of this album. It's something new to my Christmas library but has a classic sound to it.
B00FATEJYE|5.0|Awesome game man I really suggest downloading this game. A great addition for a kindle so happy they put this game on it
B004EIZCPM|5.0|Surprisingly good movie!  Acting was great, and the concept really is a nice modernization of an old idea.  Enjoy it.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Good graphics, pretty easy to figure out, and so far haven't had to spend any money :). Keeps your interest , although the game is addicting :) glad I downloaded it!
B00DMK6WN4|5.0|The 3d in this movie is incredible! My kids and I loved this. I would recommend this movie to anyone.
034580404X|5.0|These books made me laugh, cry and get angry! It was an emotional roller coaster but well worth the read!
0789723107|5.0|This book changes way more than how you see the web.  As video producer with a creative team it's become &#34;strongly suggested&#34; reading as it helps one to see all creative in much clearer way.  I recommend this book highly regardless of whether you'll ever even think about a website design.<br /><br />Excellent,<br /><br />Steve Hargis
B00CNQ7HAU|3.0|In typical Grisham fashion the story kept you wanting to find out more. The twists and turns as the story develops, however, became quite predictable. Grisham is a terrific storyteller and while the book was an enjoyable read, it was too predictable to warrant more than three stars.
B004PGO25O|5.0|Excellent book and very inspiring.  Pressfield's reads always leave me thinking about stuff I haven't thought about before.  I enjoyed this very much.
B00AGOGOLE|3.0|Still learning about it. Enjoy that there is video and photo abilities. Wished that it enabled funny and creative backgrounds.
B005HSL626|5.0|who doesnt love fruit ninja,, my three year old grand daughter loves it and plays for hours and hours and hours, okay  actually she likes it but I had to get through the minimum word count..
B00B7Y0206|1.0|when I read a review the app sounded great it included kindle fire. this is my kindle and when I tried to download it said it wasn't able to. like come on..... &gt;:(
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|James Bond,,,  I like Daniel Craig as Bond,, sometimes I think he tries too hard but it is hard to be Sean Connery..
B00EJYGL8S|5.0|I love this album! I am a pianist and love instrumental music. This definitely puts you in the mood for the season with many classics that have twists that make them more exciting. All involved in the production of this album are extremely talented. This is one of those few albums I can listen on repeat without getting sick of it. Loved it. Period.
B002HJ9PTO|5.0|A good mic for the price.  Not too many options in this price range.  It's good for narration.  It's nice having a 20 foot cable.
B00FATEJYE|4.0|Love it the best game app on platforms love characters . The move are easy to do and just the game on 360
B00BD99JMW|4.0|What the heck? I hate getting myself so invested in a series to end up not really enjoying the ending.  The story itself was pretty cool... but seriously?!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|this was very well written and Iook forward  to reading the other books.  I recommend this book for great read
0393342212|5.0|My husband and I both love this book.  It's a very easy read.  We liked it so much that we got our family a copy of this book.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|This was a good read.kind of predictable but the details were nicely done word word one two three four five
B000002URV|5.0|We enjoy all Enigma's music, but this was the first, and our favorite! Even with all that has come since, this is still our #1

B0018QOIXU|5.0|Heard Adele on the radio and wanted ome of her music...she has a great voice, and all around talent. It was worth it .
B00BAXFECK|5.0|This is such an engaging book that I can't put it down.  Characters and events are described so well that I feel as if I'm there watching it all first hand.
B00007LTIC|5.0|July 1977. After 2 1/2 years, an eternity in the 70's, the word is out; Rick Wakeman has rejoined Yes and they have a new album!<br /><br />Right off we are jolted, as we are greeted with one of the worst album covers the band had ever done. What happened to Roger Dean? Up to that point we had 4 great covers by Dean. Now it looked like Yes wanted to change their identity.<br />At least they kept the logo.<br /><br />The next thought was whether they would change their musical style too. Wakeman had left the band because of musical differences over the direction that \\"Tales From Topographic Oceans\\" had taken the band. Keyboardist Patrick Moraz brought a more jazzy approach to \\"Relayer\\" and we the public got a highly imaginative progressive album. Then each band member released a solo album that all tended to sound a little different. What would new Yes songs be like with Wakeman back on keyboards?<br /><br />1, 2... ahh.. 1 2 3 4<br /><br />It stars with a countdown and for a moment you wonder if Yes is going to start playing simple rock and roll. But that thought is swept away as the hard rocking title song blast its guitar effects at you from all angles as Howe's virtuosity shines through in all its colors. Like wizards casting a spell, Howe and Wakeman take you up and down and all around on a thrill ride seeking God, the One who is no taller than the grass sees. Yes, the One is God and the guitar playing is downright Godlike. Supported by Wakeman's flourishes, Squire's deep bass and plenty of soaring vocal harmonies, this opening track can't help but send you on your way toward the One.<br /><br />`Turn Of The Century' is a nice mood piece. Wakeman's flowing keyboards meld around Howe's classical guitar as Anderson paints a picture of an artist sculpting his love. When we are 5 minutes into it Howe's fluid electric guitar glides over the high vocals. About 3 minutes after that it mellows out and ends in soft classical guitar.<br /><br />`Parallels' is a Squire piece that did not fit on his solo album. Once again we have long runs of bass and electric guitar notes which meet in the middle with Wakeman's long run keyboard solo. After another verse we get Howe's solo, nicely matched by bass and keyboards. They all come to a sudden stop that ends Side 1 nicely.<br /><br />Side 2 is made up of 2 songs that combine to match the length of \\"Close To The Edge\\".<br /><br />`Wonderous Stories'. Here we have another song about God. You hear stories your whole life and here Anderson sings about God itself telling the stories. It starts off with 2 lone guitar strums. Then Wakema's keyboards spin around us like a circus in heaven, dancing in crystal clear skies. After 2 1/2 minutes, Howe's electric guitar rushes to keep up by playing dozens of notes, yet never becoming obtrusive. Just a great little song.<br /><br />And then it gets better.<br /><br />\\"Strong dreams reign here\\"<br /><br />How do you describe one of the greatest songs ever made? Words do not do it justice. `Awaken' is Yes at their most grandeur, ethereal, powerful, and beautiful. Wakeman's piano starts it off at a fast pace. Then all goes soft and Anderson sings about becoming one with the One. Squire's strutting bass and Howe's sharp electric jab at the air while White's drums pump the beat. At 3 minutes Howe gives us a solo that stretches the fabric of space. Then, 6 1/2 minutes after this great buildup, all goes calm and White's percussion starts. It is joined by Wakeman's keys and after a bit, by Squire's bass footprint. Soon Howe's guitar joins in and slowly grows in strength. Then at 9 minutes all subsides and you can almost feel the music breathing. At 10 minutes it starts up again and White's drums come into play, matched by a heavenly chorus of angels. At 11 1/2 minutes Howe lets it rip. By the 12 minute mark, drums, chorus and vocals all hit a peak. Then Wakeman takes us even higher and the angels take wing. The climax sounds like you are in a church and the roofflies off and you are flying away. But in the end you are floating peacefully, at one with God. At one with the One.<br /><br />\\"Like the time I ran away, turned around and you were standing close to me.\\"<br /><br />God is always with us, though we may never know it. You  ~ It ~ All is One.<br /><br />4.8 starsflies off and you are flying away. But in the end you are floating peacefully, at one with God. At one with the One.<br /><br />\\"Like the time I ran away, turned around and you were standing close to me.\\"<br /><br />God is always with us, though we may never know it. You  ~ It ~ All is One.<br /><br />4.8 stars
B004VDSWQ6|5.0|Great sound quality!  I've hardly every watched the video, purchased primary for the audio.  The sound engineers did a great job on it.  The content is very very good also.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I loved this book, it's amazing and wanted to read it 2x just to make sure I didn't miss anything!!!
B00EJYGL8S|5.0|These guys are fantastic musicians and artists.  We love having their music in our home and the inspiration they are to young musicians.
B001PP9STS|5.0|This is the classic first album from The Undertones. It is mastered well, nothing sounds clipped or overly loud. I got mine from import CDs.<br /><br />If you are a fan of the Ramones, Buzzcocks, The Who, or the early-mid career of The Beatles (Beatles for Sale, Help) you will probably enjoy The Undertones. My favorite songs on here are probably Wrong Way, Jump Boys, Here Comes The Summer,  Teenage Kicks, and True Confessions.
0553801473|5.0|Can't review this book in isolation because I no longer remember what happened in any given book. But I have loved the series. In fact, it's one of those rare books that crosses generations in our home. My then-teenaged son started us off. I followed, and then my early-20s daughter. My husband was reluctant, but even he got into the TV series.<br /><br />A word to George R. R. Martin: Keep writing. Please. We need the next installment.
B00AQ71FLK|5.0|Defeatist game I have ever played you won't find better. Mostly game I have ever got that I can't stop playing hope they make more realms and creatures
0316204366|4.0|I've read all of Malcom Gladwell's books and I have always found them interesting.  He has a unique outlook about situations and &#34;David and Goliath&#34; follows that trend. The only thing I found a bit disappointing was the way he finished the book.  It seemed like it needed a brief summary and ended rather abruptly, which is why I gave this 4 stars instead of 5.  However it is a great book that will have you looking forward to each successive chapter as you are reading it.
B00FATEJYE|5.0|Yes finally I have waited forever for this to come to kindle fire so excited I have this game on ps4 and ps3 yes!!! Finally
B00A7OIXW6|5.0|We all love Ralph.  The characters stole our hearts from the moment we first watched this movie.  Had to buy it for the Holidays!  It's a classic.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is a fun game!  Me and my sister always take turns playing it, then tell art each other when my battery dies :)
0756991145|3.0|Matilda is a 14-year-old living with her mother on a war-torn island near Australia.  (For some unknown reason, I kept imagining this child as a boy, but then the author would jolt me with a reminder of her gender.  Except for a critical scene late in the book, it doesn't really matter.)  Since all the teachers have evacuated, the one lone white man in the village, Mr. Watts, lures all the kids back to the schoolhouse by reading Great Expectations aloud.  Matilda develops a particular affinity for the character Pip, and there is so much talk about this fictional youth that he poses somewhat of a threat, not only to the beliefs of Matilda's mother and others, but ultimately to the lives of everyone in the village.  Matilda is pulled in two directions, torn between love and loyalty toward her mother, and the respect and admiration she has for Mr. Watts, who has introduced her to a world beyond her own.  This dichotomy is not new in literature, but I liked the presentation here.  Both Mr. Watts and Matilda's mother are martyrs to their own causes, and perhaps a bit of practicality would have been useful for both of them.  Matilda faces a moral dilemma and will eventually have to choose her own course, blending the best of both influences.

B00B0LPYXG|5.0|I love Denzel and this was a great character for him to play. It is more about alcoholism and relationships than the crash.
B00DMEQP46|5.0|The CD was in perfect condition! Not MGMT's best album imho but the CD's still pretty great. Psychedelic, interesting songs
B00GH4RKYM|3.0|The fight scene with Zhod goes on far too long.  I liked the twist on the story however.  I actually liked Kevin Costner as Clark's dad.
B00E9A656K|5.0|This game is badass.. I really love the gameplay and graphics.. And I think it needs more cars.. And different tracks as well. For better gameplay
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|AMAZING! I would read this book at anytime again! If you are a catching fire fan, than get this! It keeps you interested and going! I LOVE IT!
B004X6PRO6|5.0|Its fiction.  But the author gives us a flavor of what life is like in North Korea.  That part is terrifying.  The book is crafted in a very unique way that makes reading it both fascinating and a bit challenging to read: changing the protagonist's persona and switching from one perspective to another and from one point in time to another.  And some of the action will absolutely make you laugh, which adds a needed portion of fun to an otherwise bleak existence in one of the most secret societies left on earth.<br />It is no surprise that Adam Johnson is a creative writing professor, its a very well crafted story; and also little wonder that the book won the Pulitzer Prize.
B000A6T1KE|4.0|It's another in a long line of classics provided by Star Trek Next Generation.  Youthful minds can enjoy the possible worlds of space and imagination with this one.
B0084TWN9K|4.0|This selection of short stories is largely concerned with broken or never formed relationships internally, between persons, and always lurking but seldom in full view, with God. Ms Munro has a gift for incisive descriptions, crisp and spare as the winters of her native Canada, that fit her narrative landscapes as James Lee Burkes’ visceral and voluptuous depictions of the weather in Louisiana buttress his. The perfect words convey just the mood she desires, as in “...along the curving streets with no sidewalks, the only person about on a waning afternoon.” I do recommend this book.
B003EV6DBM|5.0|My collection goes from number 1 thru 7.  You just can't get enough of Doctor Who.  The first episode as good as the last.  Doctor Who lovers this collection is for you.
B00BETX5PS|5.0|This have been the best Movie. I like the action on this movie. i watched on my home theater and the sound is amazing.
B000GIXLO8|5.0|Second volume of the Classic Trilogy Lord of the Rings.  It will be something to treasure for your movie life.  Brought to life by Australian directors and has characters like Christopher Lee, the evil wizard.  I grew up on the cartoon trilogy, being told human characters in the movies could never be done.  No technology for it.  If you only have one movie collection, this may be the one you should have.
B000TEMROY|5.0|This is a great album with their hits. If you like or love music then I recommend this CD for you listening pleasure.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved it can't wait to read the other two books. Great job Suzanne Collins you're a brilliant writer. ;-)
B00CO8D3G4|4.0|When I started reading &#34;Choose Yourself&#34; I thought that I won't close my PC without over with it. I found useful information, how-to, inspiring stories, personal experiences, and how finally the author chose himself, a decision which helped James to change his life according to what I understand.<br />If I have one complain it could be this one: At the end of the book I found too much unnecessary detail that can make the readers lost.<br />I think that a great book is not necessarily the one with 300 pages, but the one that just delivers the message whether in 100 pages or more.<br />I choose myself, even though I've done it already. Therefore, my experience in reading that book offered another occasion for better caring about that decision.
B004DLPXAO|4.0|Has more features and works better than on the iphone. Easier to navigate and move from book to book .
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I love Stephen King's classic early novels - Salem's Lot, Carrie and the Shining, and I think the Shining may be my favorite of the three.  You can imagine my excitement at learning that Stephen King had written a sequel to the Shining.<br /><br />Doctor Sleep is a great story.  I don't think it is as good as the Shining, but it doesn't try to be, and that works.  Much like a child who finds his own identity separate and distinct from those of his parents, Doctor Sleep is rooted in the Shining but quickly cuts its own trail.  The story begins in darkness, finding the gifted young protagonist of the Shining all grown up and wandering the earth in haze of substance abuse and addiction.  His protectors - Danny's mother Wendy and his mentor, Dick Hallorann - are dead and gone, leaving Danny alone to cope with his addiction and emotional scarring.<br /><br />However, where Jack Torrance reacted to his addictions self-justified rage, Danny gives in to despair and hopelessness.  He is fully aware of his life's downward spiral and all he can do is stand by and watch as he heads for rock bottom.  In its darkest moments, Doctor Sleep seems even more personal and revealing than the Shining.<br /><br />Despite this bleak hopelessness, however, Doctor Sleep is ultimately a story of redemption and in many ways, it feels like that redemption extends to the characters of all three of Stephen King's first novels.  Although the protagonists of Salem's Lot and the Shining survive their respective ordeals, survival, it turns out, is a bittersweet victory.  Families are torn apart, communities lost and lives altered forever.  And of course, poor Carrie White didn't even survive her story.  Doctor Sleep redeems all three by taking up their causes in the form of Abra Stone, a child who shines far brighter than even Danny.  Gifted and extremely powerful, Abra is also compassionate and wise beyond her years.  Unlike Danny and Carrie, Abra is largely spared the emotional wounds of childhoodtrauma.  Her parents are loving and supportive (albeit in denial about her gift) and Abra is shockingly well-adjusted.  Despite her talents, Abra is happy, has plenty of friends, does well in school and by all appearances, seems like an ordinary child.<br /><br />Her shine enables Abra to develop a bond with Danny, who tries to become a mentor to her, just as Dick Hallorann was to him.  Abra also attracts the attention of a traveling coven of serial killers who prey on those who shine.  Calling themselves the True Knot, they travel the country, kidnapping, torturing and murdering gifted individuals (mostly children) to take their &#34;steam&#34; - their spiritual essence - as it escapes their dying bodies.  &#34;Taking steam&#34; makes these killers immortal (and no longer human) - so long as they can find enough steam to feed.  When the True Knot discovers Abra, they see an opportunity for an endless source of steam,  with plans to hold her in captivity and slowly bleed the steam from her with torture.<br /><br />Much like his mentor did for him,  Danny finds himself rushing to rescue Abra from the True Knot.  For him, it is as much about redeeming his soul, exorcising the memories of the Overlook and atoning for his own transgressions, as it is about saving Abra.  Abra, however, is not necessarily a helpless child in distress.  Under her cheerful exterior there is frighteningly intense, steely resolve.  As the story reveals more of Abra's character,  I began to wonder if this is how Carrie would have ended up had she grown up in a loving, accepting home.  Or if this is what Danny might have become if not for his father's murderous rampage.  Abra refuses to be a victim and takes on the True Knot, head on.  Unlike Ben and Mark, who just manage to make it out of Salem's Lot alive, Abra isn't interested in just surviving - she intends to win.<br /><br />The combination of these elements makes Doctor Sleep great fun.  The battle royale finale alone is worth the price of admission.  But don't come expecting the Shining.  Doctor Sleep is its own novel and it makes no apologies for that.
B008JGSM6G|2.0|I got 80% complete on the first level and then the paths would erase and I would have to start again. Never did finish.

B00EJYGL8S|5.0|LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this album.  So easy to listen to. But then, I have yet to find an album or arrangement from these guys I don't like. Well worth you money, but better yet - well worth your time to listen and reflect.
B00G5G7EXY|5.0|I am a 15 year old girl and an avid Disney princess fan. With that being said, this movie was fantastic, and utterly adorable. I grew up on the classic princesses, Like The Little Mermaid and Aladdin, but this movie is just astounding. They do sing a lot in this movie, but I didn't mind at all. In fact, I rather liked most of the songs upon listening to them for the first time, especially &#34;Do You Want to Build a Snowman?&#34;<br />As a bonus, there was a little plot twist near the end (at least, I didn't see it coming. And it sounded like everyone else in the theater didn't see it coming, either) that made me gasp out loud, which was a total surprise. This movie was visually stunning, and I absolutely fell in love with Kristoff.<br />After the disappointment of Brave, I wasn't expecting much with Frozen. But it was amazing,  and it will DEFINITELY be going in my Disney Princess movie collection.

B00FAPF5U0|5.0|waited a long time for candy crush for kindle fire and I'm pleased that it has lived up to my expectations.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|Excellent character and plot development. Engaging, intelligent, warm, witty, refreshing, and creative. If you are interested in sci-fi, westerns, or simply want a break from all the surface-level characters on television, I highly recommend this show. You won't be disappointed. I would write more, but there are many great reviews already so I would just be repeating what praises others have said.
B00DMK6WN4|5.0|Pixar has done it again. This movie brought be back in after the last few pixar movies had me skeptical. As good as its partner, Monsters, Inc., Monsters University finds its place along with the many other pixar greats.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Right from page one, you are pulled into this book. It take place in a time and place all of us need to know and understand. It has taken us 70 decades to understand the other side. There is so much evil, and also so much good. You cannot judge a whole country by what some of them did. It is horrifying and heartbreaking.
B00DHRLK84|5.0|Brad Pitt is amazing in this awesome story. Many zombie movies don't have any storyline to speak of, it's just killing zombies, meeting other survivors, dying. This one has a plot, and it is put together beautifully.

B003008RWA|5.0|Michael Moore may get a bad rap from some, but not from me. I don't usually watch his documentaries due to the language content, but this one is an exception. A truer story of the REAL mess of American healthcare I have never seen. I love how frank he is about his subject, how real it is, how thorough. This is not a boring documentary. It's compelling, it's smart, and it keeps you watching. It also makes you think about what people are settling for, what they're programmed to believe is 'better' for them. Educate yourselves. You may come out on the other side, but at least you'll have both sides to compare, therefore to make a more informed decision about your personal beliefs.
1451695187|5.0|Death is not an end…it is the beginning of a new existence!  This book gives clear examples from a doctor's personal experience that proves in my mind that another journey begins full of happiness and love.
0670024856|3.0|After the first few pages, I thought, &#34;This book is going to be a keeper.&#34; That's how smart and real the writing is, and Ms. Gilbert's story telling ability is the kind that takes you in immediately and keeps you there to the exclusion of everything around you. She had me hooked, right up until her main character turned 16 and discovered a racy book; then this book suddenly turns from a beautiful, compelling story into an old-fashioned version of a soap opera. We are treated to detailed descriptions of this girl masturbating, and when she becomes a much older woman, we get to hear about how she gave a spontaneous oral sex job to a man who was her gay husband's lover just because all she ever wanted was to have a man's 'organ' in her mouth. I skimmed so much of this book trying to skip those parts and get back to the story, which, incidentally, felt like it should have ended a couple of hundred pages before it did. My hope for Ms. Gilbert is that she had an incredible story and caved to an idiot editor who kowtows to societies' simpletons who want only sex and violence in their entertainment; I'd rather believe that than think that the first part of this book was just a fluke. The only reason it even got three stars from me was all due to the quality of writing and story up until the character turned 16.

B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this game is fun my daughter loves this game she likes this game so much she plays it every day
B00BD99JMW|2.0|This book never grabbed me the way the 1st two did.  I missed characters from the previous books.  TRIS and Fours relationship along with others in the book  lacked any kind of depth here.  The dual narration was extremely confusing.  I had to refer back to the start of the chapter every time because I couldn't figure out who was speaking, Tris or Four.  They sounded exactly the same. Four was always so strong, he sounds like a girl now.  Disappointed by the ending. How many people can you kill off??  The 1st two books were so good.  I wish Roth would re-write this one!!
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|Very enjoyable. My son and I run the base together and great time doing it. I build and he get blown up.

B00ARHAAZ6|4.0|This is the first of Brandon Sanderson's YA offerings that I have read and I must say that I greatly enjoyed it.<br /><br />I should also preface this review by saying the Sanderson is one of my favorite authors, so I am guaranteed to enjoy pretty much anything he puts out.<br /><br />The concept of STEELHEART is simple. What if super-powers were real, only there were no superheroes. That powers turned you evil and you became a supervillian and tyrant, who thinks nothing of throwing away &#34;normal&#34; human lives?<br /><br />That is the world that, David, our young protagonist grows up in. As a young boy, he witnesses Steelheart, an Epic whose power can turn anything to steel--plus flying, invincibility, shooting energy out of hands, and super strength, kill his father for saving his life.<br /><br />Steelheart becomes the oppressive ruler of Chicago, stylized 'Newcago' in the book, and he rules with a steel fist.<br /><br />This turns David into a young man who is obsessed with Epics. Learning their weaknesses so that he can kill them one day. And he wants to do nothing more than to kill Steelheart.<br /><br />This leads to David meeting up with the Reckoner's, an elite group of soldiers that hunts and kills Epics. Which is what the rest of the novel entails, leading up to the big showdown with Steelheart.<br /><br />The plot is pretty typical for Sanderson and YA. There is a love interest, an older man who had a mysterious past yet also manages to kick serious butt, and the likable rest of the gang. The big bad guy is mainly faceless and he seems completely all powerful and all knowing, except for one weakness, which only the group can find out.<br /><br />There are some twists and turns that keep it fresh and one of the most charming parts of the book is David's absolute failing at making metaphors. They just keep getting worse and worse and I commend Mr. Sanderson on this because he has made it almost an art-form by the end of the novel.<br /><br />Unlike most of Sanderson's other novels, STEELHEART is in first person and never leaves David's point of view. Which makes sense considering this is a YA novel and teenagers typically don't want to follow the myriad viewpoints that Sanderson typically sprinkles throughout his novels.<br /><br />Also, the plot is less convoluted and for an older, or more experienced reader, it may seem simplistic and predictable.<br /><br />Still, this was a fun and quick read (took me about a day) and had more depth than I was expecting. I teach 8th grade students and would love to use this book in my class.t of Sanderson's other novels, STEELHEART is in first person and never leaves David's point of view.

B00FQ53NIA|5.0|If all her albums are hot like sex, this one is more like making love. A lot of people will either find this to be her best album or a decent album. This has got to be one of her most intensely personal records! The lyrics are catchy, the beats and production are on par. You want EDM you got edm, you want introspective lyrics, you got introspection and depth, substance, intellectuality.The music is very much sentimental and moving/human. Every part of this record goes above and beyond expected!this is a massive return and our first taste of Britney in her 30s! The lyrics are so honest and provocative that many people will be able to relate to it. Those who grew up with Britney will find something new and exiting! She's hard working/ambitious and it shows! There are 80s influenced dance tracks to beautifully somber poetic ballads. The album goes from upbeat dance to ballads that have a sad/lonely vibe to them. This is no longer bubblegum pop and super stardom, this is the sad aftermath. The nuances of her strong vocal ability reflect in each song, and most importantly it's her heart that shines the brightest! Long time fans will find what's most important, meaning.
B004RJMUJO|4.0|It's kinda boring best classic game which you can play it for a long time but don't feel fun with it.
B00571F26Y|4.0|So much great information about the perils of wheat and gluten. At times, it can be a bit tough to get through. I probably wouldn't start with this book, but for someone who already has a bit of knowledge on the topic, it's a fantastic resource.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Riveting story. Couldn't put it down. Even reading in my birthday I couldn't stop reading until I got to the end.
B006LSZECO|2.0|I don't understand the hype about this book. Sure, at times I was enthralled and wanted to find out what was happening, but the way it was written was just annoying. Also, I hated both main characters. It's hard to trudge through a book where you don't want either protagonist to win.
B00992CF6W|4.0|I like it but I really want discovery lite but<br />I don't know if dad Will say yes TO it if I'm done
B007URVZJ6|4.0|This book was helpful in getting &#34;most&#34; of my Kindle publishing issues settled. There were some challenges for me. Probably more due to my computer skills or lack thereof. It's real good for getting started.
B0015AARJI|5.0|Works as intended. Blue tooth connectivity is great, no lag at all. Weight is balanced and the analog sticks are pristine.
B00EJYGL8S|5.0|I LOVE PianoGuys and this Christmas CD does not disappoint! The piano book is also phenomenal! I hope everyone buys this CD!
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|All three of my children love Polar Express.  They watch it numerous times each holiday season and enjoy it just as much as the first time they saw it.  It is truly a fantastic movie that the whole family can enjoy.
0061914177|5.0|Always a 5 stars for anything Gary Vaynerchuk writes. From the start, I was captivated about how simple he broke down some of the ideas I had in my head, but was unsure of. Definitely a must read for anyone in marketing, advertising, PR or who just wants to be awesome at life.

B00DONF9SS|5.0|Arrived really early, ordered it friday, here monday.  Just as decribed in the images, and looks really good next to the Sailor Moon I bought a month ago.  Will certainly be ordering the Mars when she is released, I hope they do all ten girls, 14 if you count the Starlights and their Princess.

B000ZK4466|2.0|I'm a big fan of the Mars Volta's first three albums. My favorite of theirs, Deloused In The Comatorium, had the perfect balance between song structures and spacey exploration. The balance between order and chaos was perfect and they pulled it off on that album beautifully. The guitars were sublime, vocals were dynamic and melodically engaging, keyboards were funky and interplayed well with the guitars, synths/sound effects were used tastefully at the right moments, and the drums and bass laid down the solid foundation for all that to happen. The band on that album had SYNERGY. I loved their Santana-meets-Yes-meets-Pink Floyd sound they got going on. The music had enough structure to keep me engaged, but took it to another place for just the right amount of time to keep things interesting before bringing it back to earth. Somehow, they never quite did that effectively again.<br /><br />However, in the case of The Bedlam in Goliath, something doesn't work here. The songs are more concise. The guitars are great (interplay between Omar Rodriguez Lopez and John Frusciante is face melting). Bass/drums/keys/horns are solid. Every track is intense and the whole album never backs down. What could it be?<br /><br />The vocals. Cedric's vocals ruin this album for me. His choice to sing in his higher registers for the majority of the album just kinds of craps all over the amazing instruments. A lot of the time, his voice is just plain squeaking. On top of all that, he chooses to put computery/glitchy effects on his vocals for some of the songs. Sadly, most of the songs he sings on here don't carry any memorable melody. To my ears, they just serve as a distraction from the intricate instrumentation and add nothing to the music. The band sacrifices synergy and chemistry for the sake of virtuosity and ego. It doesn't matter if the instruments are playing 1000 notes per minute. If the songs don't flow and the vocals carry no melody or tone, the music suffers.<br /><br />I hate tobe so critical of a band I admire. But this album lacks that special ingredient. It's so ironic, because their next album, Octahedron, contains a lot of the elements missing from this album. Cedric's singing on that is beautiful. But the music is so compact and structured, it lacks the exploration of their previous albums, an element that has become so identified with them. If only The Bedlam in Goliath and Octahedron were meshed into each other.
B006PTNQGU|1.0|It kept stopping and we couldn't watch it.  Sadly this is the second time this has happened with Amazon. We won't be getting another movie.

B00AESN8XY|5.0|THIS IS AWESOME. Probably the funnest app I've downloaded so far. It's a lot of fun trying to breed the perfect sickness to murder all the humans on earth.
B00BUVPIRS|4.0|Crescent moon games satisfied my want for a Skyrim-type game that I can take with me on the go. With few glitches, awesome combat, and amazing graphics, this game gets a top spot on my list of favorite mobile games. The inventory system, while being a slight pain having to scroll through items, is overall fluid and easy to use. The combat is also fluid and easy to use, with the pure satisfaction of slicing something in slow-mo or shooting your bow at giants while riding a horse. Plus you get to ride a pterosaur. Enough said.<br /><br />I must say that a setback for this game is the amount of game. I know that it must be hard to make a Skyrim-type game for a mobile device but when I finished the main quest I had nothing to do but go to areas that I've been to a hundred times and kill monsters that I've killed a hundred times. While this can be fun, it obviously gets redundant after a while. I would love to see an update or expansion, or maybe I should just get Aralon: Sword and Shadow. Anyway, great work.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|i love this game it's entertaining and requires strategy. only thing I dislike is how you're almoat forced to pay for lives and to pass levels and I refuse to pay for a &quot;free game&quot; but I love it! very entertaining and pretty much everyone I know plays.
B00CH87HF4|1.0|it downloaded and it stopped and then it asked me if I wanted to download again and I was like NO.DO NOT BUY.
B0096PAA6E|5.0|This guy is a throw back to the years of good music.  He incorporates funk, rock, country, jazz, and blues and he even throws in a slow souful ballard.<br /><br />Wish I could purchase a live show of his on CD.
B00BAXFECK|5.0|Couldn't put it down!  Obvious huge amount of research went into the development of this story that is compelling and educational!
B006LR0XLM|5.0|I have been a long time user of the desktop version and recently installed this on my Samsung Galaxy Note 3 running Jellybean 4.3. It works perfectly on that platform (it also did during the brief time I had it on my Note 2).<br /><br />For quick operations like sharing and deleting files this is an ideal solution. There is a built-in file manager that means you never have to leave the app or invoke a second one to move files to the shared storage. On my Windows PC I needed to use Explorer, but this version is totally self contained.<br /><br />You can use it as a cloud drive, especially if you sign up for one of their subscription data plans. I stick with the free 2GB plan since I am only using it for shares. I will admit that their pricing for their pro plan is tempting since the entry-level plan starts at 100GB at a reasonable monthly fee. My total storage requirements among all of my computing platforms is less than that.<br /><br />The reason I gave this five stars is it installs quickly and is intuitive to use. More importantly, I have yet to find a bug, to the app gets high marks for that. The fact that I can quickly move files, including my phone's internal settings and some key folders, to cloud storage is a major convenience. But the best reason is this (and the desktop version) is free and includes enough storage to at least share files and keep a few critical ones accessible to my phone and laptop from anywhere there is an Internet connection.
B0091THDOM|4.0|Pouch style iPhone cases are not very available, so I was happy to find them from Snugg.  The phone is easily accessible in the pouch and the card slot is great for a license, credit card or bills - very handy when running.  The design is very simple and clean.  The Snugg company has excellent customer service.
B00FEMJF6O|3.0|Too heavily dependent on Facebook. If this was a Facebook game I might understand the constant messaging to friends but as a stand alone gamer it makes no sense.
B0046B1KHG|5.0|Do I need to say anything about this wonderful movie! We love watching it without commercials and when the family is over! So entertaining!
B00C7TAF3Y|1.0|I have to admit,  while this game was working it was captivating.  About halfway through the game,  it became impossible to load. I would get the opening screen,  hit &quot;continue game&quot;, it would show the game screen for a split second,  then exit completely out of the game back to my kindle library.  I tried uninstalling it,  then reinstalling,  but now it gets stuck in download and wont reinstall on the kindle.  I wouldn't mind so much if I didn't spend money on this game, but I hate paying for something that doesn't work.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This series was the best books I ever read. I loved it so much. I wish there 4 more books I want to know every that happened in Katniss life. Suzanne Collins has a gift, I hope she uses it wisely on other things. Thank you getting hooked on the Hunger Games series!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Works great for Netflix and Youtube. I hope it expands to offer other streaming capabilities in the future. Set up was fairly easy, although it took a very long time to download an &#34;update&#34;.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|has a lot of realistic quality to it, app caused a freeze up on more than one occation . able to reset easily
B000FBFMZ2|5.0|If you missed this the first time around, don't be put off by the publication date.  This is really good, dare I say rollicking (?), cyberpunk adventure.  It made a name for its writer--an entirely well-deserved one.  Fun, dark, and magnetically detailed.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|Love this show and totally hooked. The writing is superb. Great storyline and witty writing. I love the characters chemistry together...whether it be witty banter or drama among lawyers/clients or love stories. One of my faves that I've recommended to everyone.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Had the app on my android phone and liked it, so I found it for my kindle and love it.
B00CKOZ8QA|5.0|Ok..this guy is an ex-jock (San Diego State Univ. Football) with a degree in city planning and intending upon graduation to work as a municipal worker somewhere; the passion however of singing remained in pursuit of GP, as well as the desire to be heard was never lost in his heart. Already on Youtube you can see some pretty good emulations of GP's music who are not only multicultural but multifacted as well
B00EGMQIJ0|5.0|I am not going to write a long review. The obsessive-compulsive way this book was written will rub you raw and scare you to death. I believe in the power of big data to do good but this book serves as a cautionary tale about it's devastating capacity for evil.
B00FR0GT9Y|1.0|Wow. Pure crap. I am sad to say that, being a HUGE fan of the first 3 albums (some of the best music ever made). I even actually liked 'Walk On'. I skipped Corporate America.<br /><br />This album is worthless. Nothing to see here...move along. Political BS and mellow ballads.<br /><br />Boston is dead. No wonder Michael Sweet bailed and focused on Stryper.<br /><br />EDIT: Okay now it's actually kind of comical to listen to this album a second time. Almost every song has regurgitated bits of 'More Than a Feeling\\".
B008JFUNWS|5.0|This movie was better than the first one. I didn't think that it matched the book that well though. It's a great adventurous movie and a good one. I'm a Percy Jackson book geek, so it's easy to see the very few mistakes. I liked the movie until the end when Kronos rises. The Last Olympian is when Kronos is supposed to rise. Monsters came a little earlier than they were supposed to, but I don't mind. All in all, it was a good movie. Everyone portrayed the characters very well. I give it 5 stars for effort for trying to make it like the book and making a great family friendly movie! &#60;3
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I don't say that as a negative  The game is a lot of fun!  It can become a big time sink without realizing it.
B0042AEOG0|2.0|Not what I expected. This CD was a let down for me. I expected a little more from Mariah Carey
0425264009|5.0|I just finished reading the newly released paperback version of a book I wanted badly but refused to buy in hard cover.  First, I admire Ms. Singh's writing  and absolutely adored this book.  It was worth the year-long wait  but I shouldn't have had to wait that long to get my 'fix'.  For that I blame the publisher's greed.  Let's face it; they found a great writer.  I give her five stars, but I give the publishing house only one and a grudging one at that.<br /><br />Please indulge my rant for a moment, because I know I'm not alone in this comment.  I've purchased every book it in this series (and all her others, too), and have kept them all of my shelves.  They were all identically sized paperbacks.  That's the sticking point.  I want the series to match seamlessly.  Not 12 books of one size and one that doesn't blend.  The hardcovers are also far too expensive.  Everything is too expensive these days, but the publishers made rotten choices years ago in giving huge advances and contracts to bad writers because gossip-mongers decided poor taste and bad writing would sell. Thus, no much money left for new, upcoming and highly talented original writers like Ms. Singh. Shame on them all.  Ms. Singh would be worth every penny, but by waiting the publishers screwed her, us and themselves.  Okay, rant over.<br /><br />As to the story, the characterizations were devastating and the plot line horrible in it's beauty.  This is a bittersweet song about fundamental strength and misguided weakness, betrayal and redemption, revenge and morality, brutality and compassion, and above all endurance and enduring love.  There is much authenticity and symbolism in the title \\"Obsidian\\".  Not only is this material lava rock formed at the very core of hell's fire, but it has a strenght and resiliance so unmatched that medical instruments with  obsidian blades are used for the most precise and delicate surgery.  Obsidian is a fitting tribute to the character and purpose of Kaleb Krychek.
B0014BY72Q|5.0|Shades of prophecy yet to arrive. The eerie happenings displayed in this futuristic world could be just around the corner...
0321934946|5.0|This book has lots of good information in it.  I lent my original copy to a friend of a friend, and as it looks like I am never going to get it back I went and bought myself another copy.  I use it for reference.
B0041D843M|5.0|This book is fascinating, if food and nutrition are interesting topics for you.  It's not a quick read, but it's full of useful information that you won't find many other places.  The book can be repetitive, and the text would've benefited from some additional editing.  Overall, however, it's a very solid presentation of important material.  If you would like to gain a new perspective on our culture's indulgence (dependence?) on animal protein, this is a must read.  Thanks to the authors for providing access to years' worth of important research.
B00785P2QC|4.0|Good game though they need to make it easier to get cards because without thoses you really canet do anything.
B00F8L2VO4|5.0|Great app for the development of a language.  Through this application you learn to integrate speech, writing and listening which are essential to communication.
B009G8RCS0|1.0|. . . But not by much. The part of me that loved Abe Lincoln, Vampire Hunter, really wanted to like it. I mean C'mon, a war movie where we kill moon Nazi's, but it just sorta sucked.
B00EJYGL8S|5.0|They put their own beautiful twist onto every piece of music they play!  Piano guys rock!  A must for your Christmas music selections! :)
B00BD99JMW|5.0|Worth the read!! It was the perfect ending to an amazing series! The author is brilliant and I can't wait to see what she does next.
B005H0IW6W|4.0|Nothing better than a good classic Christmas CD. Went with this Buble because it had all the classic songs that everyone can sing along too.
B00DXP7L88|5.0|Great series, the best series I've ever seen entertaining and never boring.  The series should continue for a few more years
B00EZFN3KK|5.0|Like many of her fans, I bought the last cd The Girl Who Got Away but was disappointed at the lack of radio play or worldwide buzz.<br />Dido has one of the best voices in the pop music and sadly seems to have been overlooked...<br /><br />This compilation is a must buy for both old and new fans as not only does it contain all her greatest hits but they are the full album editions not short radio edits. Added to this is the incredible new track &#34;NYC&#34; that is an instant classic and with proper promotion by her record company could easily reach #1 on either the pop or dance charts.<br /><br />I bought the limited 2 cd edition from Amazon UK (which is much cheaper than the price listed here) and can honestly say its WELL WORTH getting. Just go onto the net and listen to No Freedom DJ Cobra mix. Its breathtaking as are the remixes for Blackbird and Go Dreaming, two songs that should have been singles off her last album.
B00EJYGL8S|5.0|The Piano Guys were my favorite before this CD, Now they have made me a happy person by releasing a Christmas album! My family has listened to our CD several times already.  :)
B00GAL6L3S|5.0|Stunning..<br />I already bought Noi but with the inclusion of Eros' newest hit &#34;Io Prima Di Te&#34; along with a bonus 84 minute concert DVD<br />featuring most of the tracks on Noi plus a couple of his greatest hits, its well worth the price. Give yourselves this gift for Christmas and have the best of Italy in your home!
B00GX598FO|4.0|Part comedy, part action adventure and played for fun this is great movie to relax and enjoy.  Red2 has intelligent scripting played by talented screen veterans with deft face-paced direction for pure escapist adventure.  Grab the popcorn and put your feet up!  This movie is an action adventure tongue-in-cheek enjoyable view.
B007L3BMGA|2.0|Badly written, the story line a bit predictable. Girl meets boy, wants to change boy, he's rich and fell in love with her, teaching her kinky sex along the way.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I choose five stars because like all the other book in the series I couldn't stop till the end then I was sorry it was finished.
B00E8KC5HY|4.0|Being such a demanding and lengthy work, every recording of the Matthaus Passion work has its strong and weak moments. From the three main elements in the passion, the recitatives, the chorals and the arias, Jacobs excels in the first two. The recitatives, led by the wonderful Werner Gura, has a real story telling feel to them, with a clever use of continuo instruments - Harpsichord, organ, lute and contrabass. This variety allows for great changes in mood and colors. Hear for example the recitatives after the death of jesus, and mark the horrifying sense of abandonment and loneliness. The chorals are sang beautifully by the two choirs, if sometimes sound a bit drilled. The arias, on the other hand, fair less well in my opinion. The problem here is the speed. All of the arias are played much too fast, pushing the singers and orchestra players to their limits. In a recording that tries to restore a tradition of performance from the 18th century, the arias sound unnatural and inappropriate to the rest of the performance.<br /><br />Jacobs tries to restore the way listeners must have heard the passion when it was performed at the St. Thomas church in Leipzig. For this reason, the second choir, originally placed on the back balcony at the church, is placed far back in the recording, not left or right as usual. This concept is interesting enough, but also sounds a bit forced and gimmicky.<br /><br />The recording quality is top class, one of the best from Harmonia Mundi in recent memory.<br />Overall, this version of the passion will stay on my audio system for it’s great emotional depth, wonderful dynamic recitatives and beautiful chorals. Not a first Matthaus for your collection, but definitely a nice second or third version.
B0027ZCQ4E|5.0|We remember watching the original made for TV series starring Richard Chamberlain and were pleasantly surprised with the acting of Mat Damon. The action was pretty much non-stop.
B00FG8H93W|1.0|WOW! Marketing scheme alert anyone? Last week this retailed on Amazon at around $35.00. In fact I purchased the Nether version at a local LEGO store for around 36 bucks this last Sunday (The village and the other were priced the same as the Nether). NOW Amazon shows it as listing price of $142.00 marked down to $80.00 telling you that you SAVE $$? More like Amazon hiked the listing price up 400% and took off a few bucks to trick you into thinking you saved $$! You are getting ripped off buying this for anything over $36.00.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|Was great when the player was working. But now, I have to keep it unplugged till I want to use it or it over heats and will not sink with my Android phone or respond to anything else. Would like to send it back to be fixed or exchanged, but Amazon says it has been over to send back time and Google wont take it back due to being sold by Amazon. So stuck with a non working player. So take this information as you will......
B00F2362IE|1.0|game is really bad not worth 4$ and it is TOP FREE and its $4 Isis wuuw suuw Isis usual
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Can't get enough of it. I love it. It definitely keeps me busy and I'm on it all the time.
B0081SRJSY|5.0|This is an amazing game. I like playing it on android as its super easy to calculate the scores. This has great multi player and is a must have for anyone that likes board games.
B001H1SVO8|5.0|A movie with a fresh storyline.  Acting is very good and you really never know where the movie is going because it is not predictable.
0525478817|5.0|Holt McDougal has to be my favorite author.  If you like this novel, I recommend reading his others like Looking for Alaska and Paper Towns.  Happy reading!
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I can read my favorite books! I think this is the greatest app!<br />Thank goodness for being able to download it to my android!
B007D2XSW0|4.0|Makes my pictures come out looking amazing. The edits aren't complicated and easy to use and I love how I can automatically update my Facebook if I want.
B005SFS4ZU|5.0|I just love the singing in this version. Ramin Karimloo has the best voice for the phantom yet. If you are a fan buy it.
B00DSO9RMC|4.0|Good story with some of my favourite Discworld characters.  Not as laugh out loud funny but nice development of the wonders of the world - the steam engine, and how pivotal it became in altering the landscape we live in now.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|A little restrained, it's a big bet on future improvements.  Also, I like the option of not having a phone or tablet on me to operate it.  Like my Apple TV a lot better for a million reasons, and hope I'll like the Roku better too.  This is not that useful if you're basically trying to cut off cable.
B00ET7ICEQ|5.0|It's been a while now since Sheryl was diagnosed with Breast Cancer, actually I believe that Diagnosis came just a short time after she broke it off With Lance Armstrong, I've seen her 3 times since then & she has looked great, more importantly she sounded great an that's reason enough to go Out & buy her Album and just let her sing .
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|\\"John Grisham has been one of my favorite authors for years and I`ve read all of his books.  \\"A Time to Kill\\" is my favorite.  Sycamore Row is the now 2nd favorite. It is a well thought out sequel and carries on Jake`s life. Read it slowly to savor but couldn't wait to find out what happened.  Certainly recommend it.  5 star reading!
B004X75RK4|5.0|My daughter and i love this movie.<br />Great story. Host of characters that are funny and a surprise ending that catches everyone of guard.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Kids play this game for hours... seems simple enough, but you will be challenged!  It's a nice way to wind down after a long day.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|There is some bug when I tried to edit my existing notes. Doesn't support duo level click to enter edit mode also the keyboard wasn't shown after I was trying to edit some existing text in the note. Please fix them.
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|This is an amazing series overall. S4 starts out slow but the mid-season finale is totally wild!!! Cannot wait to see what happens next!
B00CFNUMD0|5.0|My family loves watching Shaun the Sheep!!!  The mischief that the sheep get into is wonderful & funny!!!  The music is addicting too!!!
B000W967UQ|5.0|Excellent reading! I thoroughly enjoyed this book and am looking forward to reading more book from this author. Check it out!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I read this book in three days, doing not much else.  I enjoyed it immensely.  I know it is suppose to be for teens and young adults but it was enjoyable reading for this almost great-grandma as well. I've since read the second book and will soon start on the last in the trilogy.
B000002MUW|5.0|In spite of being known for controversy and shock value, Madonna has released a lot of great material in her 30 year career. \\"Bedtime Stories\\" is one of her less remembered albums despite containing her biggest U.S. hit, \\"Take a Bow\\". But, I find it to be one of her most complete albums. The whole album flows together and does not overstay its welcome with just 11 tracks. It doesn't contain any big dance tracks that Madonna is known for, but it shows that she is more than capable of singing ballads. It's a shame that this album is largely forgotten by everyone and seemingly Madonna herself (she hardly performs any tracks from the album on her tours) because it's some of her best work.
B003O86FMW|3.0|People say that this is the best book of the trilogy, but i disagree. I think the best book is the first one... But this is entertaining nonetheless.Though why she kills some characters, i don't know. And Finnick and Cinna are my fav characters.
B009RX7WTI|5.0|it's greys, need i say more?? I mean its the best drama show out there, and its awesome!!! BUY IT!
B002RI9SC4|5.0|After reading this i wished that she would continue the series but alas! Now i wish that she'd just finish MIDNIGHT SUN...<br />BD is awesome just like all other books...and the end fight just keeps you on the edge of ur seat. And the imprinting twist !!!! wowie !
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|What can I say it is Stephen King.  Hard to but the Kindle down I love it this way and it saves the page I was on.
B002RI9ZQ8|4.0|I was doubtful about it at first but once when i started reading it, it's unputdownable (if thats even a word). Absolutely engrossing and engaging, the reader starts forming his/her own hypothesis but in the end the real answer stuns all...
B005K0HDGE|3.0|This read goes fast, like all King books it is well written.  On a business trip I once checked out Daley plaza.  No way I would plan a shot from the book depository window.  It would rely too much on luck.  King should have walked the plaza with a vet.  I doubt any veteran would try such a shot, the odds of success are low and the odds of getting caught are high.  It is a \\"crap where you eat\\" thing.  If anyone expects me to believe Oswald took that shot they need to get 50 one tour Marines with similar marksmanship scores and have them shoot under similar conditions and 40 of them would need to be successful.  Otherwise, way too much insanity and luck involved for me to think Oswald did it.  I could almost believe Oswald was stupid and crazy enough to martyr himself, but, then lucky enough to make the shot too?  No chance.  Never read a conspiracy theory book, probably never will.  Just don't think any vet is both crazy enough to think this shot could work and lucky enough to make it.<br /><br />Good read though, and worth the time it takes to read it
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Why the hell was Finnick killed ? Ktniss causes more trouble than she solves. But she did right by killing that president of district 13. Though i was expecting Katniss to be with Gale... and what happened in the end ???? So abrupt !!!!!
B001XUH69Y|5.0|wonderful classic. we need more bogey and film noir. maltese falcon, big sleep, key largo, postman, double indemnity, please - feed me.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Itsa bit confusig at first but as you start reading the concept becomes clearer and the u start o enjoy and then you can't put it down. Katniss and Peeta and Gale... are awesome. The heroine is self sufficiant and mature. Collins pays equal attention to each character and very character is equally important.
B0030A0ZD4|5.0|If you're a big Michael Jackson fan then I highly recommend buying this.  I watched it many times as a kid and absolutely loved it and still love it!  It's a bit cheesy, but still REALLY great!  Buy this immediately if you like Michael Jackson.
031219126X|5.0|This book was awesome. I love the story line. The book itself was cheap, so it fit my college lifestyle. Recommend :)
B008JFUPZI|5.0|This movie will make you laugh from beginning to end!  It might be a little like MIB as far as the jokes and humor go, but who cares, MIB is still awesome today.  Reynolds and Bridges are a very good team together.  If you like Sci-Fi with lots of very funny stuff going on then I highly recommend you buy this.  If you're unsure about buying it, then I recommend you rent it first.  It's very kid friendly too if you're one of those paranoid parents.
B0012Z361C|5.0|I bought this dvd as a gift for one of my mom's friends.  She said the woman loved it. Good music and execution was the feedback.
B008JFUOVI|1.0|Don't buy this.  I'm  REALLY bummed they made 2 and 3 after the original was SO hilarious.  Don't buy this or the second one if you're thinking about it.  I won't keep either sequel and neither should you unless you really like this more dark, gross out humor.  What a waste of time and money.
B003GQM52Q|4.0|The movie seemed very &#34;authentic&#34;.  It didn't glamorize gunfights, cowboys, saloons, prostitution, things were raw and dirty.  Gun fights weren't necessarily done fair or sober and it may have taken several shots before one guy actually hit the other, and it might have been in the leg....  Good combination of adventure and drama.  At 191 minutes, it is a loooong movie :)
B00005N6KG|5.0|They are so light weight and have good sound and the ear piece fits well and is comfortable. I take them to the gym every day.
B00FATEJYE|5.0|Really cool game. Like infinity blade or blood and Glory. Really good graphics too.Again great game. Awesome gameplay as well
B0065CCM76|5.0|I'm a big Seger fan. I've been waiting to add this to my digital library. Caught a nice price break and jumped on it.
159562015X|5.0|Great book for helping you and the ones you love understand the strengths that make you YOU, and then using that knowledge to live on purpose!!
B0045HCJSK|5.0|I bought this to pretty well round out my John Wayne collection of modern westerns (1955 - 1977). Great movie.
B00BAXFECK|3.0|Even though it is written quiet well, it did not need 800+ pages to tell the story. Hard to find the redeeming value.
B000001EHS|4.0|Excellent value. It's nice being able to rip this to my digital library while having a hard copy for a backup.
B000007U6V|5.0|it is a typical early synith music. there is the constant bass, melodic melodies that run through all of the songs
B00B5HQL50|4.0|Great action packed movie. Daniel Craig is next only to Sean Connery as the best James Bond. Judi Dench also great
B00G32TD98|4.0|The movie is a little cheesy.  About the same as Insidious.  My only complaint is that it's based on a real story.  I'm not a believer, so I find that pretty far fetched or a stretch.
B00BMEF6IO|5.0|SOLID ALBUM START TO FINISH.......RANKS AS ONE OF THE BEST ALBUMS OF ALL TIME.............A MUST HAVE.....WAITING FOR THE TOUR IN 2014
B002ZCY7PU|5.0|Chuck is one of the best series out there and season three is no exception. Get ready to laugh and laugh hard.
B004EFYZ1C|5.0|Just interesting to know, and you can rotate it through time.  I also love the picture.  For the kids, it is very educational.
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|It's Josh Groban...need I say more?! This is a wonderful CD filled with moving music. It's got a more modern feel than the rest of Groban's CDs.
B00992CF6W|5.0|THIS IS THE BEST GAME EVER! If you want an adventure game, building game, AND a game to defeat monsters, have fun with your friends; Minecraft is the game.  TOTALLY worth the money.
B00EJYGL8S|5.0|I love this CD! It's classic Christmas music with a twist that will make you want to dance around! It also makes a great gift.
B00EMGUT1I|5.0|its MOTORHEAD!  some of phils best playing to date , and mickey dee again lays down the law on the drums. and YES Lemmy is indeed GOD!
B0091TGWYE|5.0|Thanks
B00GP0G0IK|1.0|I downloaded this game and got to play about one minute where you are trying to get to the gate; the screen would go white and I ended up back at the very first of it. I deleted game and reinstalled it but it didn't change. Pretty sorry game. I will give it one -half star which is one-half star too much.<br />Submitted by Bama.<br />.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I wish lives were cheaper, this game makes $633,000 a day it can  surely afford to lower the prices. But overall the game is addicting and great!
0606321845|1.0|I hope this is his worst book ever because it was very bad. The story started out well but just fell apart into a boring, tedious narrative. Seems like he just wasn't interested in finishing. I'd say a serious lack of professionalism in this work.
B00CH87HF4|4.0|Good game to waste time playing. I don't purchase anything on games so that's a drag. Other than that the game is pretty fun.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Entire series is quite amazing. Loved the writing, the story, the suspense. This was a very unique series to read which was refreshing.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I absolutely love this game.  Fun. Fun. Fun.  I should probably be doing something else, but oh well!!  The crush is calling!
B003G4W49C|5.0|Orson Scott Card creates a new hero in Ender's Game. The book was spellbinding and the ending was surprising. A thoroughly entertaining and thought provoking read.
B00594XOZU|5.0|I love this app and I think it is better than text plus because it is way easier to use
B0091W4IRY|5.0|Great movie! Lots of action and subtle humor. Robert Downey, Jr is superb as Sherlock Holmes. I hope there is another chapter in this movie series.
B003VS0CX8|5.0|I love this movie and having it in Blue-ray is wonderful.  I love the option of keeping the Blue-ray and loaning out the digital copy.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I thought all the ccs peeps were crazy. Somehow, somewhere along the way I got sucked in and now I'm the crazy ccs person.....this is definitely addictive!<br />If you are looking for something to waste time this is your app.<br /> Try it today!
0345529057|5.0|love the books!<br /><br />not exactly the same as HBO, but enjoyable none the less.<br /><br />highly recommended to anyone who enjoyed the TV show.
B001974DG0|5.0|Dean Koontz has written many great novels, but Watchers is his best work. I have read this story many times and will always return to it. Einstein is such a great character and every dog lovers dream. The story has the typical Koontz tension and thrills, but Einstein steals the show. Great story telling and did I mention a great Character???
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|One of the better Grisham novels. Well worth the reading, Let's hope Jake Brigance appears again in a future story.
B008JEJPX2|5.0|I'm pregnant woman. This is just for me! The sole of this shoe is very soft and comfortable. I love it.
B00EJYGL8S|5.0|I purchased this album this year and LOVE it!  I've shown the DVD to my music students in school, and they are entranced with the beautiful music and settings!  A must-have for anyone who loves Christmas music!
0553582011|2.0|I was intending on giving this book as a gift. However, as I opened my package I discovered it is a mini paperback. I'm fine with paperback but the size is embarrassing. I guess you get what you pay for.Not
B00BXDOSXS|5.0|I had large avi files that wouldn't play with other software without significant lags. This player had no problems playing them without any lags in the audio. It works great.
B0055SWM08|4.0|this game is so much fun.  just one more level should be my new nickname.  can't. stop playing even when dinner is burning.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Uncle Steve has done it again.  Another page-turner tat I could not put down.  I started and finished this book over the Thanksgiving holiday.  If you are a fan of King's early work, you will not be disappointed.
B00F8L2VO4|5.0|Duolingo turns learning another language into a game that really makes it stick to your memory. After a while you start relating words and thinking of the correct grammar for that specific language you're learning. It's really good.
B00F91SCXC|5.0|Great movie and a great rental price at 99cents! I wished all of the rentals are this cheap! If you are reading this big movie studios! you are not cheapening your movies if you just give what people what! which is affordable prices! Then I probably won't think about renting this again!
B00B0LPWU6|3.0|This movie started out good and exciting, but then it turned to Denzel slipping into a drunken downward spiral and I didnt finish watching it. Too depressing.
B00DPKQ60A|5.0|A little like Emile Sande, I like it, she still has some maturing to do, but she has a great voice, and a sense for rhythm.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love the mini quests in between levels while waiting for friend's to send you tickets. It's a great idea for those who have a hard time. Collecting tickets but don't want to pay to unlock each and every level.
B00BAXFECK|5.0|This is truly an extraordinary story and holds the reader from the beginning right through to the end.  The characters are well developed.  The plot is interesting.  It has everything a good novel should have, and more.
1401938906|5.0|This is a fantastic book about he laws of attraction.  You definitely will not be disappointed.  Pam Grout did an amazing job with this and her writing style is both easy to understand and very upbeat.  Love it and would recommend this book to everyone.
B0088W6IMQ|5.0|Great series in excellent HD quality. SYFY missed the bus when they canceled this series. I enjoy it as my kids do as well
1250038820|5.0|in a city where there is so much going on all the time and Millions of people around you, is amazing to get to know all this stories, all this ideas, thoughts, feelings and souls. Beautiful pieces of the everyday life.<br />This is what the real New York is, their Humans.
B009IU6BIS|5.0|Classic Chevy Chase, got to love the over the top size of the tree and the extreme lights on the house!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|battery HD rocks.  I love it is really percise it is really really really really cool and it even has bubbels
B00979CS50|3.0|all the songs kinda sound the same. not one of neil's best efforts. i guess it's not bad for a man of such advanced years however!
0307950654|3.0|This one disappointed me, because I love P.D. James and her plotlines, and this was mostly P.D. James trying to sound like Jane Austin and trapped by Austin's plotline. I'm looking forward to an original P.D. James mystery next time.
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|I had to revise my review as I could finally get past \\"Servers not Available\\" error. Looks that with certain WiFi hot-spots the game is not able to contact Gameloft servers thereby giving this error. Could be firewall or network ports/sockets issue. Having said. The game actually is very funny, entertaining and cute. But, There is a lot of lagging or delayed response thereby making this game unplayable on low end devices. Overall it is OK time waster. Three stars from me.
B0006GQMC8|5.0|One of the all time great adventure films with some of the eras best actors even though many of the actual facts<br />behind the incident had been changed The scenery was fantastic and I would recommend to anyone who likes<br />action films and the Bronson and Marvin together
0810994739|3.0|The reason it's called Rodrick Rules is because Rodrick throws a big party and makes Greg popular.  Greg is popular because Rodrick told his friends a embarrassing story about Greg but messed up the details and everybody thought he was cool and was stealthy, because he sneaked into the ladies bathroom and girls locker room without being spotted.  i kind of like it because its funny.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I love this app.  There are so many combinations you can choose from, it's difficult to imagine someone not finding a sound or sounds to relax them.  I paid for the full version even though the free one offered a lot of sounds.  Ipnos Software Inc. deserves kudos.
B007712XAU|5.0|Great movie.  Very easy to order.  Fast delivery.  The only way to shop for movies or books.  You get what you want when you want it.
B00CZF8B68|4.0|This is a fun song.  Hard not to be &#34;happy&#34; when listening to it!  Can't wait to see the movie.
B000B7BRMM|5.0|Great jazzy renditions of traditional Christmas classics.<br />I much prefer these to some &#34;all new&#34;, basically unknown, often less tasteful supposedly holiday stuff that's come out in recent years.
B0063IH60K|5.0|MobilityWare Solitare works flawlessly on my Kindle . Solitare is a simple but absorbing game that lends itself to computer play. This app permits single or three card draw and replay features that add to the enjoyment.
B00FATEJYE|5.0|The BEST game I have ever played on the kindle fire. I am definitely hooked on this game! Everyone needs to get this game!
B00BD99JMW|5.0|SPOILER ALERT SPILER ALERT SPOILER ALERT.  OHHHH MYYY GRRRRDDDDD I. CCAANNNTTTTT BELIVE SHE DIEDDDDDDDD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!IM LITERALLY DYING RIGHT NOW!!!,<br /><br />Btw its a good book read. It.
B00CLZ4B4I|1.0|The quality of this video is poor, by far the worst purchase I have made.  I have HD tv and Kindle HD this movie look  like a bootlegged copy you buy at a swap meet.
B00EKR61FM|5.0|This was the perfect set for any Twilight fan. Between the picture album packaging and all the extras, it was well worth the wait.
B00BAXFJ5M|5.0|Good storyline ,Michelle and Sean still feisty.  As always  Baldacci creates a good  adventure with warm believable characters and just enough romance
B00AEFY6ZQ|5.0|Anything with John Wayne in it is a 5 star movie!  My grandson is a huge fan of his movies, he will be getting this one for Christmas.
B00CNQ7HAU|3.0|This book was readable but predictable, not to be compared to A Time To Kill.  Horsham can write better than this.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Downton Abbey is a terrific series and season 3 is no exception.  The show is well-written and has great music and acting.  It is also set within a strong historical context.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Cannot play the game anymore because it only goes to level 440. Please create a new update so it is in sync with all the levels on Facebook. Thank you
B00G4I1CLS|5.0|A really excellent treatment of a difficult subject. By the end you'll understand orcas, seaworld, and the trainers better than you ever did before. It's pretty darn engaging too.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|One of the best books I've read. This is an absolute must read. I loved every word of it. Wonderful humor and an honesty that makes you empathize with the characters. It will make you laugh out loud, weep bitterly and want to find true love. If you are willing to shed a a few tears and learn to look at the world around you a little differently this is for you.
B00EJYGL8S|5.0|The music is beautiful!  The Piano Guys are super talented musicians!!  You NEED to buy this CD--you won't be sorry!!!  LOVE it!
B006M4RN3U|5.0|I love the music of this group. It is up beat, but you can actually understand what they are saying. Reasonably priced.
B00B0LPYXG|2.0|It was too negative.  Thought it was a movie more about a miracle landing, but turned out to be a story of a drunk.  Story was boring after the first 30 minutes.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Excellent book. I didn't realize when my book group picked it that it is a young adult book. Good for adults too, we all enjoyed it. Well written and an interesting story from the perspective of people in a small village who were not really a part of all that was happening around them except as they were forced to be. A few people didn't like the parts with the narrator because they didn't like how those parts were written. I didn't mind them and they aren't in a lot of the book.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Fun game with lots to explore. This is my second time playing and just as challenging as the first time.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|it is a fun game you have to use your detective skills and cant wait for more levels to be open
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|Perfect!!!!  This game is free to play and they dont fotce you to spend money to advance in the game.  It is fun for sll ages and you can interact with the game by playing sub games to earn gems.  LOVE THIS GAME.
B00E6895M6|5.0|Bones of What You Believe is an excellent album, and Chvrches is one of my favorite new bands. I love their 80s pop-synth sound.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is such a fun game. Better than sugar crush. The minions are the best. Another fun thing is that any one can play.
B00A81MV3U|5.0|This is just a great movie - well written, well acted, entertaining, touching, funny - it has it all. Enjoy
1419705644|5.0|Great item, great quality. Lots of compliments from Adventure Time fans - beautiful color photos and pages. Very happy I picked this for a birthday gift!
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Very satisfied! Time is of the essence and I like being on time. The ability to change the alarm tones is one of my favorite things about this app.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This games is so much fun, skill level keeps my 9 year old busy.  My only regret is that you have to pay for so many add ons to keep this game going and my son is near addiction.
B006M4F67A|5.0|I was introduced to this game by a co-worker over ten years ago and I've loved it ever since. I must thank J Coffman for the introduction.
B00EUS9JF0|5.0|I understand why this álbum is in the list of the very best of the year according to Billboard. It has great music, good lyrics and it worth the price.
B00FOR9ZHS|5.0|Great read, good stories. Blast through it in a day or two. Simply a delight to read. As far as thinking human beings go, get this book.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Very fun and keeps both me and my daughter entertained. The only thing is that it doesn't give up the collection items easily or quickly
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so much! My son wanted it because his friend had it on his kindle. So I got it and started playing with him. Had so much fun that I downloaded it on my iPad!
B003XVYLDU|5.0|I understand Kurt Vonnegut was a POW at Dresden in 1945. After being part of a clean up gang the day after the bombing, he was never the same again. I now understand why Friends who served in Vietnam tell me Kurt Vonnegut is their favorite author.
B0062KJ198|2.0|It wasn't really good. It had some funny parts but overall it was not worth my money. The main guy was hot.
B001FSDOZO|5.0|Awesome CD by Nickelback.  Know it by heart.  It's great for working out or kickboxing class as well as driving around.
B00GNL251C|3.0|This movie should be dubbed in English. The choreography was outstanding. Too much testosterone, though. Short on romance. The opening scene needs more background information for the English viewers.
B00G4EXNNM|5.0|Just a beautifully recorded, well sung, well thought out,true to the form remake of an old Everly Brothers album. The harmonies are pitch perfect. I have not heard ANYTHING this nice in years.
6305882592|4.0|SPOILERS<br /><br />Love this unusual story for several reasons; it took the time to show why Harold's mom drives him crazy, the acting is solid and the three leads perfectly cast, and lastly, Cat Stevens' songs are simply beautiful and this film is where I fell in love with his music. Only weak point is story didn't show why Maude found Harold appealing. It showed why Maude appealed to Harold, but not why Harold appealed to Maude.  Suspect that Harold was Maude's final cause as she spent her life fighting for justice, but would've preferred to have Harold's beauty showcased as Maude's was. The writer showed her to be interesting, funny, unique, sexy, beautiful on the inside and out. The writer worked hard to do that because he knew his audience would not ordinarily accept a reverse May-December romance, so he showcased Maude, but he forgot to showcase Harold. Other than that, I really enjoyed it. Favorite part is the very funny mother/son dynamic. 3 and 3/4 stars rounded up to 4.
B005BRS8Z6|5.0|Loved the book!!  You will have to read it a few times to truly get the meaning of the agreements...Was an eye-opener to some of the things I was doing to myself...  A great book...
B000059TEQ|3.0|loved this story when I was a pre-teen, now, it's okay. Ryan O'Neal was a hunk but I loved Ali MacGraw, she was so pretty and I loved her clothes, and her character's musicianship in the story. I've listened to the Bach piano piece more times than I can count. as a middle age woman much more aware of misogyny in the world I'm not fond of the b*tch word the Ryan O'Neal character called the Ali character cause I feel the filmmakers could've shown their story was \\"hip\\" without resorting to female name-calling. I'd rate it a 3 nowadays. Upon recent re-viewing, still cared about the characters and felt very sad when the Ali MacGraw character dies. Great movie music theme.
B008JFUPZI|3.0|similar to MIB,with as competent stars as MIB.  Bridges, Reynolds, Parker really brought the Bacon.<br />hopefully there won't be a sequel, tho.
B000MV8ABS|4.0|Unusual horror film with a kid lead. Resourceful and smart 13 year old hero works to save his beloved brother from creatures from another world. Scary villain.
B0083ZRAJS|4.0|For those who found the original Judy Garland movie enjoyable, you'll enjoy the inspiration for it in this story. Looking forward to reading the rest of the books in the series.
B00BY9GQHM|5.0|This one has a story line and HO`s that you have to mix together to form one object that you have to find.  It kind of just goes from one HO scene to the next and there is no going back and forth or using things to make it through. I gave it a 5 star because the graphics are good and the mixing of objects was neat.
B004Q3UL2O|5.0|I happen to think Jake Gyllenhaal is a cutie and he does have amazing chemistry with Anne Hathaway, but I really expected Love & Other Drugs to be another roll-your-eyes, predictable romance, like you see in the typical romantic comedy. IT'S NOT! I don't want to give away the story, but there's much more to it than what it looks like (2 hot people who have no strings attached sex and end up falling in love - yawn). It's funny, but also touches on some serious real life issues. Give it a try - you won't regret it.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|Nice and long, affordable, and no complaints for two years of use! I was happy with the product, and need more words for amazon to publish this
B003G4W49C|5.0|A genius in the body of a child, a hero with empathy and compassion. This book touched me in ways few science fiction books have in years. I would recommend this book for all ages groups.
B00EOFJAT4|5.0|It's nice. Reminds me of dancehall music a little. I like Ellie Goulding's music. Her voice is very interesting. Ya dig!!
B005KDWUFA|5.0|LOVE THESE GUYS!! WHAT BEAUTIFUL VOICES THAT BLEND TOGETHER SO WELL. I HAVE ALL OF THEIR ALBUMS AND THEY ARE A JOY TO LISTEN TO ANYTIME, AND I DO JUST THAT VERY OFTEN.
B00B0LPWU6|4.0|Great movie! It kept me entertained from the beginning to end. Denzel did a great job, and John Goodman's character is awesome.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Great book. Thrilling, keeps you on your toes, never wanted to put it down! Best book I've ever read !
B00EJYGL8S|5.0|This is such a fantastic collection of music that should be in every home!!  I didn't even realize I'd bought the &#34;Deluxe&#34; edition which comes with the bonus DVD.  That is an extra special treat for sure!  We love The Piano Guys around here....such amazing talent all the way around!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Simply put this is the best platformer on Kindle Fire. It's that good. It's challenging but not frustrating. Strongly recommend this to everyone.
B007A2O3FO|5.0|I love every movie that maggie smith is in even if it is a child or family movie.  I just like to watch her work.  It is always wonderful.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Enjoyed the story line and special effects.  Looking fowrd to the sequel and seeing what comes up next? Exciting movie
B006MW3V6U|5.0|what can I say but wonderful.  can't wait for the next season and the next season and so on. Hurry
B00D3ITOHG|5.0|Sound is very good and clear. I use them as a monitor for playing the bass guitar because I am standing close to the drums and can hear the other music very well.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|AMAZING PRICE!  Great movie with great actors who have amazing voices and you really CANNOT beat the Cyber Monday price!
B0013F1D02|5.0|What a fun movie.  The story was great, with action and adventure.  It also had some truly funny parts that made me laugh.  I think this movie is made for all ages.  Stardust is visually stunning.  Watch and you will like it too.
0226039331|5.0|This is the standard Koine Greek lexicon.  After painstakingly combing through all relevant Greek literature, from amulets to Josephus' Antiquities, Bauer&co present their analysis of the meanings of all relevant words, with references.
B0079R8KXG|4.0|Perfect for my kindle and love the strap that keeps is closed.  Just love it!!! PERFECT!!!<br />And it didn't have a smell either.  Love the feel and style.
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|Fun and addicting time waster.  Too bad it crashes on my Windows phone though.  The kids play it on their tablets.
B0000214G6|1.0|the movie did not run smoothly, and the  picture was of poor quantity. I did not enjoy watching the picture
0316055433|4.0|I enjoyed this book because the story was so unusual. However, I knew before I started it that I was going to have a problem with the ending. I did. One would think, after almost 800 pages, the author would have tried a bit harder to tie up a few loose strings. Maybe she is thinking about writing a sequel? What happens to Theo....does he just continue to drift?  The last 1/4 of the book almost felt like the author herself was getting tired of writing and just wanted to end it all in the easiest way. But, after the reader has made a commitment of that many pages, I think the author owes us some closure.
B000FCKC4C|5.0|Fascinating story that inspires the reader to search for his or her own treasure... follow your dreams in spite of set backs, unsurmountable obstacles and odds. Perseverance is key as well as teaming up with people one can help achieve their dreams along this journey called life and likewise they in return help you achieve yours. Highly recommend this book. It has a lot of Christian allegories overtones.
B00E4W40C4|4.0|Good Movie, a little slow at times but it's the freaken Wolverine. You got to love a all things wolverine .
B001AQO3QA|5.0|Great series including the additional footage added in - not sure why they ever left it out of the original version but the quality is beyond reproach and considering it has been 25+ years since Alien came out - the special effects are still amazing.
B00EJYGL8S|5.0|Love Love these guys. Their compassion for their music and life shows in every thing they do.This one definatly going in the traditional pile that will be played every Christmas
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I have not had any issues with it books are easy to select and prices are reasonable. there is a great selection of free books to try the app out.
B006AZZPCM|1.0|One day my Internet messed up so I couldn't  watch you tube so I  got tubemate and it worked great but now it doesn't work at all and it screws up my screen please fix glitches and I will rate better
B007J4T2G8|3.0|Modern pornography.  Its quite interesting that there are hundreds of sex novels with all sorts of  S&M and this ONE makes it as a hit.  The descriptions are well written but the characters  could have been described by any twenty-one year old Slave  working in a Dungeon  in  Manhattan while they are flogging and doing bondage.<br />The Rich and Powerful need a sexual outlet and accidentally they develop an affection for their Slave.<br />She is quite mentally ill to absorb it all for the luxurious life she might enter.<br />I can't  blame the writer  for describing  what goes on daily in the S&M world and making millions from it.<br />One thing for sure, you won't fall asleep reading what might be  your secret desires.
B008C20TDG|5.0|Great book - Whole9life and Whole30 are changing my life - I feel better than I have in years. I would definitely recommend this to family and friends.
B00FN811SY|5.0|The revised version of The New Worlds Translation of The Holy Scriptures is the best of both worlds. It has the easy reading style of a paraphrase Bible but has the structural integrity of a literal word for word translation. I enjoy the fact that THE DIVINE NAME JEHOVAH as represented by the Hebrew Tetragram or four letters which is a transliteration of the Hebrew verb: &#34;TO PROVE TO BE OR TO CAUSE TO BE&#34; has been restored to their original places in The Bible. I also love some of the easier reference works that are included. Whereas I still use the Reference version of The New Worlds Translation of The Holy Scriptures I use the revised version for meeting preparation and of the field. The reference Bible has a academic flare and easier for me to understand when considering deeper information.
B00004Z459|5.0|Who doesn't love this album! This is such a cathartic album for me especially when I'm pissed or frustrated I just get it all out when I listen to this cd. It's a must have for anyone's cd collection. 13 years since it's release and it still has a very powerful effect on me. Hybrid Theory means the most to me from any other release of theirs not because their musical style has changed but because it set a standard for music. It changed my opinion of good music. They were original, fresh and totally cool! Bleached blonde hair, spiky red hair, lip rings, Chester and Mike's voices....takes me back in time, takes me away from all the pain and leaves me alive..I will always be a loyal fan.
B0055SWM08|4.0|Very nice, simple puzzle game. You swipe to move the ball and it rolls until it hits something. Sounds easy, but there are nice obstacles and tricks that make it more fun. No time limit. Easy to learn. Sometimes it takes a couple tries to start game on my Motorola RAZR. That explains the loss of one star.
B003M8NG94|5.0|One of my favorite Tim Burton films. Science fiction alien films get turned on their ear by the Master of fantasy. A stellar cast and a hysterical storyline.
B00CWV8TIU|4.0|I like this movie and love many of the actors/actresses in it. The plot is cool and has a neat twist that I didn't really see coming initially. If you like psychological thrillers, I would recommend this!
B001EC2IT4|5.0|very creative and innovative, funny, well produced, excellent story line - why in gods good green earth do they have a required minimum number of words ??
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|we are the lat among our friends to see this movie...cried like a baby....excellent movie....yes the poor always get screwed.....acting is excellent and now i am going to read the books :) yes backwards...the story of my life
B00AB7HESI|5.0|&hearts;&hearts;&hearts;&hearts;&hearts; not just five stars but five hearts TO I love this app VERY entertaining fun NEVER stops being entertaining I love it I HIGHLY RECOMEND YOU GET IT AWESOMENESS
B001EQ5ZJK|5.0|Wow! There's so much in this book that it demands re-reading.  An interesting and entertaining read. An eye-opener that challenges many long-held perceptions.
B000MV8U1S|4.0|I love the soundtrack in general, and Hug and Drew's duo is great! if you like the movie, you will like the cd.
B000AY74OG|5.0|Soooo cute!  Grandkid favorite!  Our family likes to laugh and have good clean entertainment.  This one is a keeper.  So much so that we plan to purchase all of this series.
B001675YWU|4.0|It's a great season...love the show! I love the show and how it gets in the 5th season, shame on HBO for having only 1/2 of the regular quantity of episodes in this season.
B001L2EE9Y|4.0|I love this era of Joni Mitchell and had the vinyl albums when I was a teenager.  I still maintain that she has one of the most beautiful voices around.  Not in the present - she has smoked since she was nine and now has almost no range at all.  But the early albums, like this one, are still delightful to listen to.
B00A80SHFM|5.0|If you enjoyed the movie you should like this CD.  This CD has most of the music from the film and makes for great listening music.
B00FOWX6NM|1.0|The border color was not as it appears here.  Not worth it.  The backgrounds were not something I would use either
B009IH0ICG|5.0|GREAT PRODUCT....... I have been barbequing for years. I wish that I have been smart enough to have been aware of one of these. No way in hell that you can get a hotter fire with a standard stacking of the briskets. I just bought my 2nd Chimney Starter today. No lighter fluid. I use the \\"Fire Starters\\" from Weber also.  VERY HAPPY!
B00F4PM6WG|5.0|My 2 and 6 year old love this game!  Fun making train tracks and playing the games.  I would recommend.
B00CE03UOC|4.0|not bad. fast paced game. fun to play. can pass 5&ndash;10mins when waiting for the bus. I like big butts.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|This game ia great! I am impressed how the team continues to innovate and create more levels! Sometimes I have trouble syncing nh spot on the map across my devices, especially my Kindle Fire.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is amazing I just can put it down. But when I got to the mall job I loved it the most.
B007VDN1PA|5.0|Easy set-up, easy use, easy download.  It can get any easier.  Only minor drawback....company needs to include a pair of tweezers for using the slide option.  Slot is very narrow and can be difficult to remove slides.
B00GINENG0|4.0|THIS APP IS GREAT!  YOU SHOULD REALLY GET THIS APP. U CAN GET ALL SOTTS OF THINGS AND THE BEST PART ALL OF ITS FREE. U CAN MAKE HIM GROW. AND MAKE HIM URE LITTLE OWN TOMCAT.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This app has me sometimes for how hard it is. But there<br />are east ones to not to hard not not to easy plus it's tricky so 5 stars.
B00FATEJYE|5.0|I have  had this app for a while now on my iphone and im so glad i can have it on my kindle.
B0012HRJEA|5.0|We love this version of Romeo and Juliet! We love that it is set in a more modern time but still with the Elizabethan (sp?) English. The colors and vibrancy of the costumes and scenery added an intensity to the story.
B00F2HW20M|5.0|Great concert playedalmost exactly as it was done in studio. Video images are very good, sound is crsp, detailed and full as a concert should be. Five stars to Steve Hackett!!!!!
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|Game play is more fun than the Facebook version. Quests are easy but challenging at the same time. Especially enjoy the Christmas quests.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I know that minecraft pe has come a long way from cruddy to EPIC. If you want to know my minecraft pe name it is Raptor_plays_MC. I am a tester for minecraft pe updates.
B009VIZDLI|5.0|A wonderful book - just get past the first few chapters where you might think that either the writing is not good (but it is) or that the content is weird (it isn't - surprisingly very normal) and you will have an intelligent insight into the human psyche and a rare glimpse into Autism Spectrum all done with humour to rival the best sitcoms. Highly recommended.
B004GYY714|4.0|Easy listening, not too many ads, clear and fun to have. App downloads immediately after purchase and is ready to use.
B00005NKKV|5.0|This was the second addition to my Simon & Garfunkel studio album collection. A few months ago I decided to finally indulge my love for S & G by purchasing all of their albums. I'm really patting myself on the back because this was a great present to myself. Seriously, if you're looking to buy Simon & Garfunkel music, you can't miss \\"Sounds of Silence\\". It has the perennial favourite, The Sound of Silence, which is the version everyone is so familiar with. It also has Kathy's Song and I Am A Rock, which are greatly loved songs as well. Also on the CD area few bonus tracks, one of which, Barbriallen, was a song that Art Garfunkel released on \\"Angel Clare\\" (a note: I like this version better). The album cover is one of the more famous covers in 1960's music, and it's got some adorable pictures of two very handsome young men (climbing in trees, no less!) in the booklet that accompanies the disk. It is all together a very nice package that should last a long time.<br /><br />The songs that I personally favour, in this order from most loved down, are: The Leaves That Are Green, Kathy's Song, I Am A Rock, Blessed, The Sound of Silence, and April Come She Will. All in all, the songs on this album are enjoyable folk-rock. You can see how Paul Simon's songwriting has evolved since \\"Wednesday Morning, 3 A.M.\\" here. He has created a lot of upbeat and even heartfelt songs. I am always moved by Kathy's Song and April Come She Will, but find We've Got a Groovy Thing Goin' to be, as the booklet says, \\"just for fun.\\"  I love to listen to I Am A Rock when I am feeling angsty, and when I'm in the mood for no singing at all, I might listen to Anji. There truly are songs for just about every mood here. One more song I'd like to mention is Somewhere They Can't Find Me, which is a more clunky-sounding rewrite of Wednesday Morning, 3 A.M. Out of the two songs, I prefer Wednesday Morning, 3 A.M. It is a lovely song with gorgeous harmonising, and for the life of me, I can't figure out why Paul rewrote it. I also am not a big fan of the cymbal in A Most Peculiar Man, nor most of the instrumentals in Leaves That Are Green. Those are small gripes in an otherwise favourable review, however and do not reflect on the star rating.<br /><br />I like to listen to \\"Sounds of Silence\\" to alleviate the midday blues I get at work, and it is a very effective system to cheer me up. While \\"Sounds of Silence\\" can't be called my favourite S & G album, I certainly enjoy it and wouldn't give it up for the world.
B001QWBM62|5.0|Very easy to use, can convert wav to mp3 right on the recorder so basically everything you need done can happen. I plug my electric drums right in with xlr which makes me reall happy that they arent mini xlrs
B00555X8OA|4.0|There is no doubt that there were days I just wanted to put the book down and walk away, but then I would read a few more pages and get struck with some fascinating insight. This book forced me to think about, well, how I think. It also goes into the implications of how those behavioral patterns affect the smallest and the biggest situations we face everyday. This is not a how-to or self-help book, but a diligent reader will dive between the lines and find ways to make the material applicable daily life.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I am a huge Stephen King fan and have been waiting on this sequel for a long time. It's not quite what I expected but it never is with King. It is a very good book.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|Good character development and true to the book, except for one scene that was from book two, but it &#34;fit&#34; just fine.  I also like that Katniss and Peta were not presented as all macho, like Lara Croft or most males in other movies.  They seemed flawed and I liked that - more realistic.
B00GX59QO2|4.0|It was a fun and violently playful movie.  I enjoyed the first movie and so I wanted to watch the sequel.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Love games that use deductive reasoning and problem solving techniques. this is different and I am looking forward to more levels.
B00B0LPYXG|5.0|Acting is excellent, casting is good, moves along well in spite of the action and graphic stunts all being up front in the first 15 minutes.  There is a moral conflict that is thought provoking and the movie has an ending positive message.
0765334798|2.0|I enjoy Scalzi's books, especially the Old Man's war series, very much, but this one left me flat. It wasn't Phillip K Dick, it was tenuous and repetitive. I gave it away with reservations; I should have just binned it.
B00E4W40C4|1.0|The &#34;Unleashed Extended Edition (Blu-ray 3D / Blu-ray / DVD / DigitalHD + Digital Copy)&#34; only includes the extended cut on the 2D Blu-ray, NOT on the 3D Blu-ray. If you're expecting to get an extended cut in 3D, DON'T BUY THIS! Peter Jackson was able to give us an extended edition of the Hobbit in 3D, but apparently 20th Century Fox didn't want to spend the extra few dollars to allow James Mangold to give The Wolverine the same treatment. Shame on Fox for bundling the extended cut with the 3D cut - send 20th Century Fox a message and BOYCOTT this cynical product packaging.
B00G6ZTM3Y|1.0|I hate this app so very much. This is a dumb, stupid app that is too overpriced and once I installed it a reinstalled it right away. Don't get it and save money and then you will be :)
B001TKD4ZI|5.0|I love her books. She has it all humor, action and hot romance. Anyone who reads paranormal romance books won't be disappointed.
B00DWFQ2N4|4.0|Great album just not as good as version one.  2 of 2 just seems a little calmer for JT. Still fantastic.
B000E41MS6|5.0|Of course I give this one 5 stars. David Tennant and Billie Piper are the best Doctor Who duo ever. Even if they are not your favs these DVDs are well worth including in you collections.
B008JFUO72|4.0|Enjoyed it better than IM2, but not as much as the first or the Avengers. I would have preferred more of Tony kicking butt in the suit. Nevertheless it was very enjoyable. And the epilogue after the credits was hilarious.
B004EPYZSU|5.0|Love this movie and soundtrack. Of course watching Daniel Craig is nice on the eyes. Took me a bit to adjust to &#34;Indiana Jones&#34; as the gruff guy but it works.
B00AQ71FLK|4.0|the game is great if you like leauge of legends but don't have a computer. the only down fall is it takes up a lot of prosesing power and data
0865478007|5.0|This incredible book took me several weeks to get through. First I'd get angry. Then I'd be outraged. Then I'd decide to run for some public office that could fix the discussed problem. Then I'd think about the severe backlash I would experience from industry and academia alike. Then I'd feel sad. Then I'd eat a cookie.<br /><br />There are 361 insightful, jaw-dropping, horrendous pages.<br />That was a lot of cookies.<br />My scale committed suicide around page 298.
B004UID2LC|1.0|You only get to choose from one page of videos and you don't get to search for any videos. 2 thumbs down
B00BVDNKSY|1.0|I HATE this game!  Hate the play! Hate the interface! After only a few seconds, it made me tense and nauseous.  If you would actually like to enjoy the games you play, avoid this one.  It has about as much entertainment value as being bludgeoned. I only gave it a star because I was forced to. I really want to rate it zero stars. Zip!  Nada! Nothing!  If I could return an app, it would certainly be this one. Excuse me, while I go hurl.
B006M4F67A|4.0|Great game but wish it would not restrict access to the next level without having to rate or pay for it
B00CL151G4|2.0|This is an important tv series, good story, good parallel with the original Holmes stories, good actress (Lucy Liu).  So why was this released in such horrid shape?  It is hard to watch for several reasons.  The resolution is lower than other recent tv series.  The focus keeps going in and out - from experience with my own cameras, this might be due to using a poor quality camera in conjunction with light too low for successful video and auto-focus.  Even in closeups the quality is poor.  At a number of points there is terrible pixellation;  I watched this on a 55&#34; screen, and the individual squares seemed about 3\8&#34; square!!!  This is hurtful to one's eyes and completely spoils the enjoyment of its fine qualities.  I'm assuming the show was shot with insufficient light and with poor quality cameras.  We can hope for a re-release if its possible to refine the video.
B00355L2TU|4.0|The workout itself is ridiculously short, but I enjoy it and it makes getting in just a little bit of exercise that much more convenient.  I also think Jillian's kind of mean (sorry!), but she's way less annoying to hear over and over again, day after day.
B00B5HQLMI|4.0|It's a solid entry into the Bond movie franchise - everything you'd expect.  It's not quite as good as Casino Royale, but definitely worth the watch.
1465414444|5.0|This is such a beautiful book with so much great information. A little over my 10 year olds head but he just loves to stare at the pictures and read about the different races, etc.
B00D1DBO1C|4.0|It synced with my Google calendar for a while but it stopped and I don't know why. I'm going to have to reinstall it but I really don't want to do that because I've been tracking my progress on keeping up with my classes and events and it would be a tragedy to lose them. Can someone help me with this?
B00EJYGL8S|5.0|Piano Guys just never miss.  They are so creative and manage to do things with a piano and cello that most of us would never dare to dream of.  My very favorite on this album is Angels We Have Heard because once again they use the whole team and the whole piano.  But, as always, every song is great and it really is hard to pick a favorite.
0395389496|5.0|I purchased this for our daughter to share with her young children.  I love this book and have enjoyed reading it to our older grandchildren for ten years-every year.
0307341577|3.0|None of the characters in this story are likable, including the main character. Libby Day's family was killed by her brother when she was 7. By the time she hits 30, she's still 7 inside, her inner growth stunted by the tragedy. She can barely take care of herself, has never had a job, and suddenly the money that strangers donated out of charity over the years is down to about $900. To replenish her bank account, Libby grudgingly agrees to pimp herself out to a group of people obsessed with the Day murders and with proving that her brother isn't really guilty. Along the way, she starts to have doubts herself and the real story unfolds between her present-day sleuthing and flashbacks to her mother's and brother's point-of-view from the day of the killings.<br /><br />This story has many layers and I'm sure that different readers will get many different messages from it. I was disappointed that I didn't like the main character more, but that didn't stop me from wanting to get answers about what really happened &#34;that night&#34; just like she did.
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|Great story about a child who is not sure if he should believe in Santa Claus.  His trip to the North Pole on the Polar Express and his interaction with Santa himself shows him Santa is the &#34;Spirit of Christmas who lives in our hearts&#34;.  Animation is great.  Tom Hanks is a wonderful conductor.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|The Chromecast is fine, but I never got my promotional code for my 3 months of Netflix even after I got an email saying I would receive it. Now I can't figure out how to get it. Bummed since that was my motivation for buying this.
B00BRUQ7ZY|1.0|Really? Mr. Aslan rehashed for a 21st century readership arguments in vogue in the 1970's and since pretty much marginalized, but still popular among a cult following of aging Marxists and liberation theologians.<br /><br />I searched in vain for new original research in this book but I found none, and based upon Mr. Aslan's selective use of evidence and ideological bias, the conclusions are to be expected. It's like reading a novel of which you already know the plot and its undramatic finale.<br /><br />A single reading of N.T. Wright's introductory chapter to his _Jesus and the Victory of God_ neutralizes Mr. Aslan's entire thesis of Jesus as a &#34;zealot&#34;.<br /><br />Don't buy this pseudo-scholarly claptrap, regale yourself with N.T. Wright's _Jesus and the Victory of God_ instead.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love this very addicting game. Hard to put down at times and it was free with my Amazon kindle account. Highly recommend this to friends.
B00EJYGL8S|5.0|The Piano Guys - the best group EVER!!!!!  They couldn't put out a bad album if they tried and this Christmas edition proves it. They are awesome!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|My 3  year old really enjoys this horse game. His best part is to mix the food before feeding the horse.
B009MF5BXK|5.0|This movie have almost all my male action pack actors in it.  Sylvester Stallone still looks good to be in late sixties.  He can still move pretty fast.  That's what taking care of yourself will do
B008OOYALE|5.0|Very fun and addictive. Does take awhile to build up to get some items, but it just adds to the fun.
B005LAIGW8|5.0|I love action pack movies.  This fits right into that category.  If you are an action-pack fan like myself, I would recommend this DVD.
B009NG1Q96|5.0|This book was recommended to me by my neighbor's daughter -<br />she loved it and so I got it and loved it too - it is a quick read and the<br />story, even though it is second in the series is easy to get into.  However,<br />when she told me about the series I also bought The Selection (# 1 in series)<br />so I was aware of the back story and the characters.
B003Y5H5EW|5.0|I love this vampire movie.  I love the Underworld trilogy.  Kate Beckinsale have done a good job in all these movies.
0375842209|2.0|the movie previews look great and I will go see the movie but I could not<br />get into the book - I wanted to and tried but it was not my cup of tea.
B009MO57H6|5.0|I received it when I was supposed to.  I love anything with Milla Jovovich in it.  She is one of my favorite actress.
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|Have read every John Grisham book and they never disappoint<br />The legal profession lost a great mind.  This book like all of his<br />books is a take on a legal question and is a good read.
B00FAVRHBE|5.0|I'm so excited to get the DVD, the special was amazing! I wish 9 would have come back though, it would have been amazing if he came back, even just for a minute to show how he got to Rose's work.
B00EHMG358|5.0|I really enjoyed this book...a fun read! This was more like the authors older works. I think it would help to have read 'Still Life With Crows' before beginning this story.....<br />I should mention that this free sample does an excellent job of leaving you hanging at an exciting part of the story...lucky for me my hubby was reading White Fire from the library so I used his copy to finish the book:)
B003VANOFY|5.0|Great headset for gaming. Nice adjustable volume. No faults so far, and has very good sound quality and people say I sound clear.
B00G70JQZC|4.0|Was a fun and exciting movie, makes up for the Origins movie that I was not a fan of. There<br />is allot of great action here and loved the Japanese setting. Some fun side characters and conflicts with Yakusa add to the action.  I would tell more but don't want to give it way if you have not seen it. If you liked the first two X-Men Movies you will most likely like this one as well.
B000Z8GZYW|5.0|I simply love it. I can watch it several times a day. The added features, especially one about public reaction to the movie, make it worth more than just seeing the movie at a theater.
B00785P2QC|4.0|This is a pretty fun game to play, it gets really addictive too. Gets kinda annoying to with all the  tasks
B000GCFG7E|4.0|Always entertaining with just the right amount of thrilling predicaments. Always a great twist with the characters, Well done,Thanks Lee!
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|My friends turned me on to this game and I've been addicted ever since. It's so fun just ripping off other robots heads and it's a great stress reliever. I would recommend it 100 percent.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Wow!  What a roller coaster ride of twists and turns!  The beginning is a bit slow...imagine a roller coaster beginning its slow assent up before the crazy ride begins!
B00004RFCM|5.0|If you want to spend a day or two lost in New York, just pop in this video.  I have enjoyed the first season over and over.  It doesn't really get old.
1451666179|5.0|Everything about this screams Ali Brosh who I love very much so of course I love this book! Thank you, Ali, for the joy you bring to my life!
B00EJYGL8S|5.0|Second Piano Guys CD our family bought, beautiful music<br />The songs are peaceful yet moving<br />These men transform well known music like these Christmas tunes into an extrodinary listening experience
B0079R8KXG|5.0|The Marware Vibe Case Cover is a terrific color and fits my Kindle Fire perfectly.  It was exactly what I was looking for.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|Not what I expected, but sometimes we have to understand authors have a mind on their own. They filled  their own expectations not ours.
B003JYMF8Y|1.0|Romero's worst. There is so much wrong with this movie is kills me. And it breaks my heart because I normally love Romero's films. Also, stop using the TERRIBLE CGI. Go back to practical FX.
0316204366|5.0|Malcolm Gladwell at his best. I really enjoyed this book, Gladwell is a great story teller. If you like his other books you will like this one as well. Particularly liked the history and back ground information on the David and Goliath story. One of the best books I've read this year.
B005UT29Z0|3.0|Overall a decent movie. It gets thoughtful and smarter towards the end.<br /><br />Really painful for me were the lack of details in the issues the firm was facing. There should have been more detail and complexity; there should have been less shots of analysts looking at a computer screen followed by the expletives &#34;f***&#34; and &#34;J*sus.&#34;
B00EJYGL8S|5.0|A Family Christmas is truly a beautiful CD.  I have it on my  * Piano Guys Playlist * shuffling all 3 of their CD's that I listen to most nights.  It is worth buying, especially since you get the DVD with You Tube videos, plus the Yule Log.  I don't listen to much Christmas music, but this is one I'll probably listen to all year long.
B00BAXFECK|4.0|Thought book was too long but worthy it in the end.  Story about the art business was interesting.  Glad I read three<br /><br /> It
0345529057|4.0|Great series. I started reading this after the first Game of Thrones season came out on HBO and I was hooked. Like most books, the book is 10x better than the show. If you like this series I would recommend the Wheel of Time Series by Robert Jordan. It is a 15 book series that will have you on the edge of your seat for most of the series.
B007SGM084|5.0|I admit it. I liked it. I really liked it. It wasn't awesome writing. Could have used a few more edits. But I loved the love story. I love the fight to help make a person better.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|The plastic on this cord seems to be better quality than the original cable that came with the Kindle DX. The original one must have been some really cheap plastic, I never had a cord where the plastic on the cord disintegrated after just two years.
B00BAXFCPO|3.0|Pretty common information for a gluten free diet, but I was surprised as to the relationship between ADHD and gluten.  I am presently on a Vegan diet but found that I was consuming excessive carbs.  My previous thoughts that whole grains were OK turns out to be false. However, the Brain Diet may be harmful if you have a heart condition, and recommended consumption of meats, eggs, oils etc may be a problem for persons with arteriosclerosis.
B00FR0GT9Y|1.0|I just picked up the new Boston album, Life Love & Hope, online. Don't waste a penny on this.  Want to hear more? Read on...<br /><br />The hardest part of this is that I was a HUGE fan of the first album, and to a lesser extent, Don't Look Back. What I mainly hear on this release is a half-hearted rehash of ideas and sounds Tom Scholz has been recycling since Third Stage, which for me was barely tolerable, and certainly the beginning of the end.<br /><br />Drums: The worst drum machine sounds I have ever heard. And that's saying a lot. The programming is ridiculous, these are drum patterns no real drummer would ever come up with, way too busy and completely without feel. On top of that, the drums are mixed at about half of the volume they should be for a 'rock' album.<br /><br />Guitars: Yes, Tom, you invented the Rockman sound. Now quit it already. The first two albums rocked because you tracked through amplifiers. This sound is way over processed and has no balls whatsoever. The parts are all meandering and without focus, and there's too many of them on every song.<br /><br />Vocals: Yes I hear Brad Delp in there in places. I also hear lead vocals by a thin voiced female singer that sound totally out of place. What I don't hear are vocal melodies like those that made the first two albums memorable.<br /><br />Songs: I don't hear any of these at all. There is also a glaring lack of 'hooks' like those that made Boston a household name. No amount of studio production, or decades between albums, will make up for a lack of actual music. The third song, an instrumental, would fit nicely on a Mannheim Steamroller Xmas album.<br /><br />Long story short, with just the talent within my circle of musician friends, we could write an album of songs that sound a lot more like Boston, that actually rock, and that someone might actually want to hear. Please do not frustrate yourself by buying or listening to this terribly failed attempt at rekindling the Boston fire.
B000I186FW|5.0|this is a really excellent movie. First of all, it has a really good story to it, but also a moral story about standing up and believing in a cause to fight against oppression and tyranny and how their strength in numbers. Guy Fawkes was a real person and there really was a gunpowder plot. Unfortunately, he was caught and put the death, but if you look at history and what Benjamin Franklin done, he was printing papers in a fictitious name and sending them out to the colonies to spread the truth about what was really going on and what was going to take place even when they are writing the Constitution that was considered treason and if that would be as of today it would be considered terrorism. What Benjamin Franklin and the rest of the group were doing. But this movie does have a meaning to it. In my opinion, this would be a five star rating
B002DD67XG|5.0|James Taylor is an amazing ballad singer-songwriter. I love hearing his music, it's so soothing. JT's mellow tunes melt me. He's just timeless.
B0069UP2PI|5.0|this movie is really excellent, but it is same time is one of the scariest movies you ever want to watch for the simple fact is, this could really happen. So there is nothing fake or a joke about a deadly virus that can easily be spread from country to country, and all it takes is that one person in the best example how something could spread worldwide is just like how AIDS started and there really is no cure for that. I highly recommend this movie. But again, the scary truth is how easily this can play out in real life so quickly.
B0027MJU00|4.0|Another Flynn success. Dark and twisted in such a way that keeps you thinking, reading and sometimes leaves you wondering.
B00EJYGL8S|5.0|This album is so beautiful!!!  I love their mix of Carol of the Bells and God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen!!  Carol of the Bells is my all time favorite Christmas song and the Piano Guys did it justice and then some.  Remarkable!!!  Where Are You Christmas is also one of my favorites on this album.  That sweet, innocent voice brings a beauty to the song and really polishes it off.  I Love it!! &#60;3
B000KJT8IG|5.0|I never get tired of watching this movie every Christmas! Easily Chevy Chase's finest (all of the Vacation movies). Decided to grab this Blu Ray to add to my collection.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|This CD is Wonderful and By FAR one of my Favorites that I have in my collection!!! :) The Piano Guys are Inspiring!
B00GLX1MG6|4.0|THE WOMEN ARE PRETTY IN THE MOVIE AND IT WAS HILARIOUS TO WATCH IT.  THE STORY WAS PRETTY GOOD TOO.
B00EJYGL8S|5.0|Thepianoguys have done it again with a great album. This is great music for in the house while reading, driving to work, a party, anything really.
B00G3Q6VPS|5.0|I love this album. It is the best one yet because she wrote/co-wrote each and every song which is perfection to me!
B006M4RN3U|5.0|Fun is a great name for this band.  I love this album.  All the songs are great; this is so much more than the ones you hear on the radio.
B000VDUWMC|5.0|It was quite interesting and gave a good account of where and why the author believes the powers of the world are where they are today!
B00DERIV8Y|5.0|Ladies and Gentlemen, In the event of a zombie apocalypse, break open your Daryl Dixon 10\\" Deluxe Action Figure and let the spirit of everyone's favorite redneck bada$$ guide you!  I am 100% positive that thanks to my Daryl action figure, I WILL SURVIVE!<br /><br />I was lucky enough to have spent the last week with Mr. Dixon, as somehow, even though the official release date was moved from 11/18 to 12/2, I received mine the 26th of November.  It's been, quite possibly, the best week ever!<br /><br />Seriously, this action figure is so amazingly detailed, when I took a few pictures with my DSLR, it looked like the REAL Norman Reedus was staring back at me, piercing my soul with those eyes....  Now I see what Carol (and maybe even Beth, huh? huh?) see in him, and I'm a married man!  It feels a lot heavier than I expected, so I know it would last through any apocalypse that may come.  It comes in several separate pieces (Daryl himself, Poncho, Crossbow, Knife, and 3 arrows) most of which fit together with no troubles (the arrows on the bottom of the crossbow, the knife in the belt sheath), but I did have a slight problem getting the crossbow into his right hand.  I had to pry the thumb and middle fingers apart slightly to allow for the grip to fit snugly.  I wouldn't plan on removing the crossbow from his hands any more once you've maneuvered it into place.  Once it's placed in his right hand, the left hand slides right up into place on the fore grip.  The other area of trouble I encountered was getting the poncho on.  I've never owned a collectible action figure prior to this one, so I was afraid I may break it trying to remove the head.  Don't be afraid, this thing is built like a tank.  You just need to twist the head slightly and begin to push down on the head, almost like you're trying to make his chin touch his neck.  This should allow it to come apart cleanly, allowing easy access to put the poncho on.  To re-install the head, I found it easiest if you place the head back into the slot and then begin to push down and back, almost as though you're pushing his chin up and away from his chest now.  Having said all of this, I don't personally like the poncho, so I promptly removed it and put it back in the box.  I prefer the angel wing vest only look.  Lastly, the feet seem to be slightly movable, so if you're having trouble getting your Daryl to stand on it's own, I'd try to adjust the angles of the feet ever so slightly.  I haven't had any issues getting mine to stand on it's own.<br /><br />The only thing missing, for my taste, was a walker ear necklace, but I know that was from seasons past.<br /><br />Overall, coming from a 30 year old married father of two, I absolutely love this action figure.  I'm still a kid at heart, and I love The Walking Dead, so this is right up my alley.  It's a great conversational piece, and in my opinion, a must have for any Walking Dead fan!e head back into the slot and then begin to push down and back, almost as though you're pushing his chin up and away from his chest now.  Having said all of this, I don't personally like the poncho, so I promptly removed it and put it back in the box.  I prefer the angel wing vest only look.  Lastly, the feet seem to be slightly movable, so if you're having trouble getting your Daryl to stand on it's own, I'd try to adjust the angles of the feet ever so slightly.  I haven't had any issues getting mine to stand on it's own.<br /><br />The only thing missing, for my taste, was a walker ear necklace, but I know that was from seasons past.<br /><br />Overall, coming from a 30 year old married father of two, I absolutely love this action figure.  I'm still a kid at heart, and I love The Walking Dead, so this is right up my alley.  It's a great conversational piece, and in my opinion, a must have for any Walking Dead fan!
0446580848|5.0|There isn't much I can say that has not already been said, so this review is mostly to back-up other solid ratings. This book is great, the series is great, the author is great, and you should buy it!<br /><br />Every two years DeMille seems to put out a new Corey novel, and every two years I stay up all night reading an incredible, thrilling, snarky story. You should too.
B008RLTUUA|4.0|Very interesting and disturbing.  Found it to be a bit repetitive at times. Specific examples of drug companies manipulating data was most useful.
B008JFUS5A|5.0|This movie was beautiful.  As someone who only saw the first film and this one because I was dragged to them by friends... this movie sparked my interest in the Hunger Games series.  I am reading Mocking Jay now and can't wait for the next film to come out.  Will definitely be reading the first two books and buying the first film!  GREAT JOB!!!
B00EJYGL8S|5.0|This cd is fantastic! It has a great mix of traditional favorites and original tunes with Piano Guys style. The bonus dvd is a nice addition.
B007SGM084|5.0|the story line is very good. a love story that I enjoyed getting lost in. I will be reading this again.
B007V4530A|5.0|This book had lots that I haven't seen in typical public-speaking or presentation books.  A great plus is the fact that the examples are 'live' - they can be seen in action on TED.com.
B00BAXFCPO|5.0|It gave me a real awareness of what I was doing to my brain by feeding it junk and how I could feel better just by eating better.
0955153077|5.0|This book has SOOOOO many tips in it and actually spends time explaining what things like &#34;jitter&#34; and &#34;scattering&#34; means. I thought it was super useful not only for the painting aspect but gets into a lot of detail on the tools themselves. There are also very good step by step tutorials that I was pleasantly surprised by with lighting tips, etc. Super useful!
B00CDCIQX6|5.0|Tom and Halle do not disappoint!  I really fell in love with this movie.<br />You'll watch this more than once!  This movie will make you think!  This is not an entertainment video to sit and watch mindlessly.  This is a beautiful example of rebirth and Karma.  I had to have a copy!<br /><br />&#34;Our lives are not our own. We are bound to others, past and present, and by each crime and every kindness, we birth our future.&#34;
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Great game. Can't seem to stop playing this game. Is that bad?  Try it for yourself and you won't be able to stop
B0086VWCPG|5.0|I've only used it a few times now but I'm impressed how well it tracks and how much your tracks it's well worth the money I would recommend giving it a shot.
B00GP0G0IK|5.0|Good game. I like games that challenge me. Thank you . Anyways I love this game. And I hope others will like it.
B004G600A4|5.0|What a great family movie as always great storyline and cartoon characters  would recommend this to anyone who loves cartoons

B009LDD4V4|5.0|I love this series and all the actors the storylines are fantastic and very funny at times it is a great series
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|This game is challenging fun and a super time kill. I had it on my old android phone but the game was too big for the memory. I was sad but then I got my new kindle and now I get to start over! Now I'm happy.
B001AGXEAG|5.0|I watched this movie years ago and loved it then and love it still very funny i would recommend it to anyone although would watch before letting young kids see it
B007HUD6OS|5.0|This book is so good I loved it if you like mysteries and adventure you should read these series<br />I am not kidding
B003F3NDWG|5.0|What a great series it has great actors and the humour if great the storylines and crimes are very interesting
B001P06GX4|5.0|Very enjoyable adult game. My friend brought hers out and we really enjoyed playing it it's a great family pastime
B00005R2IS|5.0|I watched this movie when it first came out years ago and loved it and knew I had to have it again although the acting is not as great as today still great
B0083P1QUM|3.0|Bought this for a friend to read she wasn't interested in it said it was just not as good as the other books
B0058YPGSY|5.0|This is a series which is very enjoyable to watch opens your eyes up really what goes on in the bike world
B000002OCP|4.0|Almost perfect album. I understand the criticism on the pure blues level, but I'm not a 24/7 blues purist. ALL good! I recommend though. It's got some lovely/nasty guitar tones and the production is classic '68 joy. Funky stuff, indeed!
B00F7YHDWC|4.0|This is fun but I'm tired of dying.  I must be too slow because I get to a certain point (about 1750) and so far, I am not able to get past it for awhile.  It's cute and I'll keep trying, but there are other games out there that are more fun that I am more successful doing!
B00B4804KS|3.0|Very good 3D effects, but according to the description it's runtime is almost 6 hours, not true, it's just the first one they made of Jurassic Park.  So don't think your getting all three movies here in 3D.  Was very disappointed it was not all of them.
B00CGNYDIE|3.0|It's okay for free.  Pretty pictures and mildly challenging, overall not that exciting.  You can &#34;undo&#34; your puzzles and rework them &#34;for fun&#34; if you desire.
B00BAXFECK|5.0|This ia a beautifully written, gripping read. It's so rare to find a book that you both can't book down because of the &#34;page-turning&#34; quality of the story, and because the highest level of skill and craft  infuses all aspects of its creation.<br />The characters we meet are some of the best, quirkiest and heartfelt people I've met in any book in recent years.<br />Often when the side characters are so strong, the main character and ,in this case, narrator, tend to be weak by comparison. Not so here. Wonderful. I loved this book.
B002B44KDG|5.0|God bless Neil Young.  He creates music from the heart and doesn't give a damn if it's commercially &#34;approved&#34; or not.  I'm a huge fan and in my humble opinion he has tossed out some real garbage along the way but when he is &#34;on&#34; no one can top him.  He, I believe, is one of the greatest artist of our time.  I just finished reading his book &#34;Waging Heavy Peace&#34; and it gave great insight to the man.  I was a huge fan before reading it but the book gave an intimate look inside his world, past, present, and future.  When I finished reading it I felt like I had become his friend.  What a great read.  I'm a song writer and performing artist and Mr. Young has been a huge influence and this album was the beginning of it all for me.  Anyway, I think &#34;After The Gold Rush&#34; is one of his very best.  You gotta love the guy!
1490313370|5.0|Thought provoking and right on the money. Corporate America is in decline. Its time to \\"choose yourself\\".<br />James is entertaining and full of motivation.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I found the book slow at parts, and then fast and confusing during some of the action sequences. Fun story. Glad I read the book instead of waste $30 and wait 2 years to see what happens after Catching Fire
B005NJU8PA|5.0|I really enjoy how easy the instructions are written. The food tastes great and the stories are worth reading even if you never plan to make a single recipe. While I do love the hard back print edition the kindle version on a tablet is amazing to cook with.
B000ZNQEMU|1.0|This is not what is pictured! I purchased this and what I received was a storm trooper flashlight three times the size of a Lego piece. Way too large for a keychain. If you are looking for a Lego figure sized keychain, this is not for you.
B00DQZT494|3.0|I bought this for my wife, it arrived after a long wait-ordered it in early November. I also ordered her the poetic case that cost $14.95 to compare it to, and she prefers the one that costs 1/3 as much as this one, This one feels ok, and looks nice, however it does not turn on and off like the poetic does, and it doesn't feel like it will hold up. All in all, for $45, I would expect a better cover to protect her HDX that she LOVES !!
B006O2QNOU|3.0|I enjoyed the movie because I'm into the market. Others watching with me were not thrilled with the movie at all.
B008SAZHLQ|5.0|This book definitely made me think of when I was younger. Amazing what we do when we are &#34;in love&#34; and some of the strides we take to make one another happy.<br /><br />I laughed quite a bit during this book (in a good way). R. Rowell did a great job with putting the reader right there, front and center of what was happening. Many times I found myself immersed too heavily in the book and would forget to eat lunch.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Period. Keeps u enthralled completely! U can waste an entire day finishing this book. Not to mention the entire 3 books
B002ZG976U|5.0|best movie ever
0316017930|5.0|This is such an amazing book! Gladwell is a fantastic writer. This book really changed the way I feel about education and success. Highly recommend. It's one of the best modern books I've read in a very long time.
B002G1YPH0|4.0|A most excellent cooler for a really reasonable price. The directions are very, very poor, and fail to make clear that a plate must be fastened on the BACK of the motherboard. For some cases, this is not much of an issue, for others, it means near total disassembly of the motherboard cluster. In my case, there is a mostly solid plate the board sits on and the board has to be taken out of the chassis to add the plate. Like I said, for some people this is a simple matter of removing the other panel of the case.  So, better instructions would make this a 5 star product for me.
B00G6ZTM3Y|5.0|O my goodness i have alwAys wanted terraria on the kindle fire yayayayayayayayayayayayaya<br />Thanks for putting my second favorite game on the kindle fire !!!!<br />The first thing i did when you released it was get it on my kindle fire<br />In all honesty i think that terraria pe is ten times better than mine craft pe
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|The movie doesn't have a good ending, and obviously has a lot of filler, but I love all the action.  It also has a much lighter mood than did the Lord of the Rings.
030716327X|5.0|This is my go-to gift for newborns.  My kids were born 13 months apart and I think we went through 4 of these!  They are so tactile and cute that the babies love them...great for bedtime...
B00G32QIEG|4.0|This was fun. Kept you wondering throuhout. It could have used a little more of the girl and old man but it was still fun.
B00EY8BRGU|5.0|This movie keeps you on the edge of your seat!  Great, fun ride full of twists and turns!  Watch it today!
B00FPGSPQU|3.0|It was good. Same old, same old. How many times can 3 guys put themselves in stupid positions. Maybe they should stop drinking?
B00138KFYO|5.0|Love Janis and miss her. This has all of her greats on it in one place, the recording is good.
B000MD9UJC|4.0|Yes. What a nice upgrade for a mini mag lite. I can't begin to tell you how much brighter the light is then the old high intensity bulb.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|minion rush is fun to play for all kids. dodging the obsticles is challenging and collecting bananas along the way is fun.
B00DJ4PIBK|5.0|for my 4 year old daughter. she loves it. the problem is keeping a little kid from ripping them all open on the first day. and the &#34;friends&#34; legos really do appeal to girls
B008JFUNHI|4.0|Despite any misgivings concerning Orson Scott Card's personal beliefs about controversial subjects, his novel &#34;Ender's Game&#34; (TOR, 1985) often shows up in the top 2 or 3 titles of the most loved books among Science Fiction readers. The original novel won both the Hugo and Nebula Awards for Best Novel, not an easy feat since few have won both awards for the same book. (&#34;Dune&#34; by Frank Herbert, &#34;The Left-Hand of Darkness&#34; by Ursula K. Le Guin, and &#34;Doomsday Book&#34; by Connie Willis are a few examples which are double winners.) After many starts and stops over a 20+ year period, &#34;Ender's Game&#34; has finally graced the big screen. And it has been worth the long wait.<br /><br />The screen adaptation of &#34;Ender's Game&#34; is one of the best among classic science fiction novels. (By contrast, the original &#34;Dune&#34; film directed by David Lynch was an atrocious screen version of Herbert's famous novel.) Where &#34;Ender's Game&#34; succeeds (and the original &#34;Dune&#34; film didn't) was because the former understood the sensibility of the story. While on the surface, the plot seems simple: a young cadet is in training at a kind of military space school. At the same time, the story is much deeper than merely a bunch of kids playing shoot 'em up in a weightless battlefield. Underlying the setting of a training school for pre-teen space soldiers (written over 10 years before Harry Potter) is the idea of how a youth becomes a leader among his/her peers. Is leadership in-born, or is it taught? Or does it come from facing adversity in which the person must find within him or herself the ability to be self-reliant?<br /><br />The administrators of the space school don't believe that leaders are born, but rather can be forged, like a sword. And Earth needs someone forged for the task to stop the alien meanies who threatened to conquer earth. In the last battle, the meanies were stopped by a hero who had the guts and cleverness to use every resource available to ensure victory. To replicate their former hero, they contrive to offer one of their best students a series of experiences which will instill the idea that he is a leader. And that student is Ender Wiggin. The administrators in charge of his experiences are Harrison Ford and Viola Davis who put Ender through a ringer of impossible situations that would be nearly unbearable to almost everyone else. The story is not only about how Ender deals with these experiences at the training school but also how he grows into something a bit different than what the administrators had planned. And after having graduated to different levels of the training school, he meets someone he thought so much larger than life that he can't believe he has met him face-to-face.<br /><br />A beautiful and moving adaption of one of the great science fiction classics. The cast is first rate all-around with exceptional performances by the kids, particularly Hailee Steinfeld as Petra and the highest marks for Asa Butterfield as Ender. The special effects are fantastic, which is to be expected, but they support the story rather than overwhelm it, which seems to be the trend these days for most science fiction offerings. This is one of the few science fiction films that is simultaneously dazzling and moving. A rare find in the annals of SF filmmaking. And as stated by others involved with this film, the message of &#34;Ender's Game&#34; has absolutely nothing to do with the author's opinions on other subjects.every resource available to ensure victory.

B003IMV8HG|5.0|When this LP came out I was in College and my roommate stole my MCC collection.  Coming on...It's Mariah Carey!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I play just for fun and to pass the time while waiting for my husband to complete dialysis 3 days a week. I enjoy the game.
B00GINENG0|5.0|When I got it Tom was small and so cute I'm on level 7.<br />Recommend this game!!!!!!!!! PLEASE NOW OR NEVER
B004M3GDI4|4.0|Good light, it will definitely get the job done.  My only issue is that for the size and weight there are other headlamps out there that will get the job done.  Not a headlamp for your typical camping trip.
B0070YDOT8|4.0|I haven't had time to play it much but I like it so far. I will keep playing when I have time.
B008JDAC7G|5.0|Ok. It accesses your accounts so don't haveto ccreate a new one.  These things are not privacy concerns. It will not be able to do anything till you log in any way.  It's a fun game.  Really pointless. But what do you expect from adultswim. But really, if you don't want that stuff, don't download it.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|I love this app it works very well and has many features on the free version and you can upgrade to the full version. And get more features
B00G6ZTM3Y|5.0|this app is worth the 5 dollars! its awesome. it has most of the items from the computer version. and the space gun is in it you just need a flintlock pistol. in my opinion best game on the amazon market. thank you 505 games you guys did good maintop this game with re-logic. you guys should start making terraria merchendice. thank you once again.
B00G922EA2|4.0|Very good game with a very good story line. Citonsidering I purchase quite a few this company works for me. Not too hard plus not too easy. I have  to say hidden object games have always been my favorite s since the days of PC computers. I think 4 stars is an excellent rating because to me 5 stars is purely perfect. My only complaint is these games take up a little space which is a small price to pay for 2 to 3 hours of Fun! Love it G5 keep up the good work
B00GP0G0IK|3.0|Needs a sequel or to at least let you go back and choose the other object to see what happened very interesting
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is awesome it has daily challenges and it is FREE!!!!!!!!!!!!!! :)<br />It kinda like temple run but even better
B00EE3FVSU|4.0|I lived the character development, and even though a few plot parts were a bit predictable, the message of this well developed story resonated deeply.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I love this book but I cried when they talked about rue:··( :-( _<br />:( we love you rue and always will have the same way that you can get
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I thinking very fun and addictive.  However, I don't like how some levels are designed for only power-up that you either have to buy or get really lucky.  I do not purchase and sometimes get stuck for weeks or quit playing a while all together.
B00GFOIUVQ|5.0|This game is so awesome and I like all the weapons with all arm or and the graphics;the action it's so cool
1449410243|4.0|Gave this as a gift to a cat owner who loved the whole presentation of the book and the poster.
B00DAXXO98|4.0|I just finished watching the first season of House of Cards, and it is an impressive show. The first couple episodes are faced paced and really draw you in. The show doesn't moralize, it does a good job of providing depth to the characters and makes you understand the inherent conflicts and absurdity of DC. It makes you wonder whose interests are really being represented.<br /><br />After the first couple episodes the show levels off and becomes a bit dramatic. Nonetheless, it kept my interest and I would recommend.
B00DJUPLY8|2.0|The player crashed several times on my Kindle Fire HD 8.9&#34;. It's either an issue with Kindle or with the App - but it is upsetting that Kindle is not truly Android friendly. There is a significant lack of apps - especially the most popular and common ones... such as Google search, You Tube and the browsers. Silk sucks... let the other browsers be available. If Silk survives, no worries else you can divert that money to the delivery drones project.
B008602KQI|5.0|Love this series!  The premise of the fantasy is thought provoking; it's Ggeat for all ages, and the movie is pretty close to the book!
B009LOJK1Q|4.0|Engaging book. Very well written (as you would expect) and full of interesting characters. Just a little too predictable for 5 stars.
B00003CXPD|5.0|This inspiring story of a young boy's passion to dance and to become a dancer is a must for young and old.  Made even more meaningful and poignant by the contexts of poverty, loss of his mother, and the tutelage of a dedicated dance teacher who recognizes the boy's potential and drive.  This is one you can watch over and over and never tire of it!
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|This generation Chromecast doesn't do much. I expect great things in the coming year but right now it basically let's one play YouTube videos on the home TV.
B00BAXFAOW|5.0|I have like all of Macolm Gladwell's books but this one was really easy to read and had some interesting takes on conventional wisdom.
1576754227|5.0|Great advice on how to get to the important things in life and stop procrastinating with the little things. Easy read. A must for DS business owners.
B00AZMFJYA|5.0|**STAR TREK - Into Darkness .... Excellent film worth watching again & again. Chris Pine was excellent!  Deffinitely one of the better one's!
B008XG1X18|5.0|Like it a lot! It has lots if areas of interest that keep me occupied for a couple hours at a time.
B009ZXT4BY|5.0|The demo sucks, but the game is so worth the money it is so fun! No issues, no freezing no cons at all! Super great totally recommend!
B00138CXFS|5.0|One of their best albums.  Would have purchased it just for &#34;White Rabbit&#34; but my wife loves the entire collection.  This updates our LP.
1594487154|5.0|Excellent book...i have suggested this book to all my friends, those in sales and those who don't think they are!!
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|The game is fun,  but clearly designed to cost you money despite being free. I would rather buy the game up front then pay a buck everytime I want to keep playing. I don't buy anything--the game isn't that good.
B00B7FOQCK|5.0|Excellent accessory for the Surface Pro, with one USB 3 plug the Surface Pro needs a small USB 3 buss, this is a great one.
B005SAYRA6|1.0|I was not pleased with the quality of this movie at all.  It was very grainy, not High Def at all.
0425252868|5.0|I am a big reader of non fiction, especially presidential biographies & World War 2 history. This is absolutely one of the best books I have read.<br />It makes you realize that there are good people everywhere & in every situation.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book came very highly recommended and it didn't disappoint. Great character development and a story that just won't quit. The plot development is superb and of course the ending is what one would hope from such an good writer. I do plan to read it again.
B008FRFN7A|5.0|Worked perfectly on my Kindle Fire HD! Very pleased. Setup was quick and hassle free.  Can't beat the price. Stuff.
B00EGMQIJ0|4.0|I enjoyed this book and zipped right through it. I had hoped for a little more depth and a better or at least different ending. I had the characters figured out very early on which was disappointing, but over all a very good read
B00FR0GT9Y|3.0|I gave it three stars instead of two because of the guitars. It's not a bad album, it's not bad music, but I miss the Boston I grew up with and it seems that these are mostly love songs that Journey and Air Supply might write if they got together. Where's the energy of Don't Look Back, the rock of Smokin', the balls of Rock and Roll Band? The band sounds great  but the songs don't rock for me. I thought a couple of songs we're going to take me there, but alas, it wasn't to be. Good music, not great rock and roll.
B00BAXFECK|5.0|I have read all three of Donna Tartt's books - a actually have them all and she is perhaps one of the best writers of contemporary fiction. By some standards the book is long, but the plot development, characters and that special Tartt treatment of the story make this the best I've read this year (and I read a lot). I have recommended it to all of my literary friends. I just wish we didn't have to wait so long between books.
B00957T6X6|5.0|It will hurt when the book series ends, but the game of thrones is eternal. Masterful and engulfing. I hope Mr. Martin has a few more in him.
B008JFUUIA|5.0|Excellent Movie!  Excellent amount of time it took to get my movie!  I had been looking for this movie in stores but could not find it.  One click on AMAZON and boom, it was on the way.
B000NQRE1E|5.0|I seen all of titanic movie but my fav is this once with Leonardo DiCaprio the one that play Rose will bring out her role in the movie.
B00BATG18K|5.0|This is a very engaging read. Amy Tan has another winner in this book. The characters and adventure is addictive.
B003YUC9JI|5.0|I like the one made in 1986 and the other sets but this one is good too and Jaden and Jack just bring the movie to life.
B009LQKHIO|5.0|This was a great story. I enjoyed reading a romance novel that has great family values. I will being reading the rest of the books in this series plus other books written by Jill Sanders.
B000WQWPKA|5.0|I like this movie and Will Smith is a good sing and actor. It's have a little bit of everything.
B0010SKUYM|4.0|I really enjoyed the book and found it to be different and am looking forward to reading the second sequel to this one.
B002BGFUPQ|5.0|I love all the fast and the furious movie it's good movie and at the end of the movie you see van at the end of the movie.
B00EJYGL8S|5.0|Once again The Piano Guys deliver! This CD/DVD is absolutely wonderful. Each track is an inspiration.  Let the holidays begin!!!
B000WGWQG8|5.0|Such a great story. Almost all of the actors are excellent, but Paul Giamatti and Laura Lynley are extraordinary. I did not expect to laugh or cry so much in a TV adaptation of McCulloch's great work of history.
0316044938|3.0|This is kind of a hard book to read. I have read it twice now, and the second time I had to really push myself through it. I'm glad that I saw the movie first because I think if I wouldn't have, I would have been really confused. She is constantly switching back and forth from the girl being in Heaven and then back to her family on earth.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|5 star .Exciting all the way to the very end. Enjoyed the twists and turns as well as the surprise ending.
B008K9SG9K|5.0|Love the entire album. Every song is an a favorite of me, with lyrics that are deep and moving. This type of music is not typically my scene (mostly metal and punk), and I bought it for someone special to me to listen to on road trips since my music is unbearable to him, but i found myself listening to it way more than him. I really can't get enough of this album and sing along to each track when it comes up on my iPhone's shuffle.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|I like the ease in which the game flow from task to task, without feeling overwhelmed by missions.  I also enjoy building things to sell.
B00EJYGL8S|5.0|I love The Piano Guys.  They enjoy their music so much and when I saw this I ordered it as soon as I could.  I love the mixes  they do and I love they way they play their music.  I appreciate their abilities and the way they share.  The Dvd is 2 or three videos and then you have your burning log and their arrangements.  I like listening any way I can.
B000OVLINI|3.0|This book was entertaining. The characters were enjoyable, but I felt as though this book was more for teen aged readers. The storyline is a bit over dramatic, and not very believable. The ending was predictable, and anti climatic. All in all, I did enjoy the characters, but the plot was kind of silly.
B00EEDNA4M|5.0|This is hands down the best Television show in History. The drama and the action gradually intensifies with each and every episode/season.
B000BTC5LW|1.0|Just bought this DVD set.  First thing I noticed is the cheap packaging, but I could get beyond that, figured it was just a remaster/rerelease.  Second thing I noticed that gave it the 1 star is the sound quality, it just plain stinks.  The volume is low, whether on a computer, TV, or portable DVD player, and it has a crappy crackling sound to it, especially the right channel, on all media devices. Figured it might be a 1-time thing, so Amazon sent out another copy, but it was exactly the same poor sound quality.  I originally saw it on youtube and picture and sound quality were top notch in HD mode.  Being a huge fan of Pink Floyd from way back, this had to be the finest concert I had seen of theirs.  Contacted Amazon to send both orders back, but its been nearly a week and no refund from them, even after a call to them, got the Return Received e-mail, but never got the Refund e-mail, still no refund on my credit card yet.  Gives me a bad taste about not only the DVD, which obviously was a re-release done cheaply, but also Amazon's returns department.  Bad experience all the way around.

B00EJYGL8S|5.0|Last year I heard them for the first time and fell in love!! I was waiting patiently to see if a new Christmas Cd would come out and it did! Everyone in my family loves listening to The Piano Guys songs. Great job guys!!!<br />I am going to give this as a gift to a friend who loves to listen to Christmas music year round!!!
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Truly an amazing game for the Kindle. Good to pass the time and unwind with, but so much fun it's easy to lose track of time. Clean and crisp graphics, tastefully done.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Great bingo game!! Only wish they would make it easier to increase your daily chips. I have been trying for weeks to get the needed collection items to increase daily chips with no luck. But then if they made it too easy it would not be a challenge. Overall fun game for free!
B00CNQ7HAU|2.0|Very disappointing read.  With the cast of characters, I expected much more.  The story line and plot were exactly the same as A Time to Kill, the scenarios were just different.  Very predictable!!!!
B00EJYGL8S|5.0|I love what these guys do! Their music is so pure; it has so much life and joy, which is exactly what Christmas is all about! Thank you, Piano Guys for another CD to enjoy. I definitely do NOT recommend putting this on your Christmas list; get it NOW. =)
B001UV4XI8|3.0|I had the DVD version of this but I really wanted the blu ray to complete my collection. I was really excited to get it for $3.99 on Thanksgiving!!!!!!! The only down side is that the case is broken and it won't close. Im trying to keep my odd at bay with it, but I think Ill be okay since its in one of those movie/game rack things. Besides that great buy
B006LSZECO|2.0|This book was actually amazing... for the first 3/4 anyway.  It is very well written and a page turner if I've ever read one!  The problems I have with this book are entirely with the ending. It's ludicrous. It's stupid. It's incredibly disappointing.
