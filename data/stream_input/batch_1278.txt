1615243496|3.0|This book would be awesome, if it wasn't for the fact that it came scratched.  It's a Christmas gift though, so no time to try to return it. Over all I'm happy with the look of the book, just disappointed that it's marked up.
B005MYEQ4U|4.0|Personnally like found the movie to be just a bit of fluf or fun.  It isn't particularly deep, nor is it intended to be I think.  I would also suggest that anybody who stayed awake during Freshman intro to lit class would know most of the characters.  I didn't see it as a major work, but one that is intended to be enjoyed.  You know like his earlier funnier ones.  I will say that when Owen Wilson was talking about living in the now, I could only think of the scene in \\"Whats New Pussycat\\"  when Peter O'toole was holding forth at the end with a little sign over his head saying \\"artist's message.\\"    I highly recommed it.
B004L3AQLU|1.0|This film is bad.  Not in a, \\"it was almost good\\" kind of way either.  Whoever is reviewing this and giving it 5 stars either didn't watch it, or was too distracted by the low impact nudity to realize they were watching a terrible film.  The first 5 minutes are solid, but the film takes a turn towards goofy comedy and never comes back from cheesy Viagra jokes and a laughable attempts at drama. Hathaway's  contribution of graceful beauty and nudity can only take a film so far.    I know my review doesn't give a lot of insight into the film itself, but to be honest it's better that way.
0743277465|2.0|Starting with the positive- Josh is a remarkably accomplished individual and his book did offer some intriguing perspectives.  Unfortunately, the amount of effort to find the pearls was onerous.  His narrative was fraught with an adolescent writing style, over abundant clichés , unsubstantiated pop psychology assertions, and excessive amounts of narcissism.    On most pages the word I or my appears between 10-15 times.  Close to 3000 self references.  Makes one wonder about his  Zen approach to life.  Sort of makes Donald Trump look humble.  Could have been a very good book if he had hired a ghost writer.
B00005NNT1|5.0|Item was shipped and received very quickly.  Cost of item was more than reasonable.  I would do business with this vendor in the future.
B001UV4XI8|4.0|The film itself was much much better watching it again after watching Deathly Hallows Part 2. The first time I watched this as a rental before Pt 2 was out I was not impressed, thought it was the least dynamic and interesting of the Potter films - kind of dull and flat, lack of plot elements as well as \\"new scenery\\" of the world created by Rowling. This is probably why it's so inexpensive even on blue ray. I must say I enjoy it more now on re-run.<br /><br />Bought this and Part 2 because of the upcoming \\"blackout\\" on Potter DVDs/broadcasts/streaming availability that is going to happen in 2012 and will last until Warner Bros. releases the new box set some time in 2012 or possibly even 2013. I do like to have Harry Potter \\"marathon weekends\\" on my own time, especially holed up during snowstorms and since I have all the other movies I didn't want to wait for the box set to watch the whole saga when I want to. And of course if the box set does not provide extended versions of these films with ample extra footage in all of them in my opinion it will be pointless to have since I'm not a collector but watch for \\"entertainment value\\".
B000HKWCOA|5.0|This is a another great Star Trek collection that adds to the overall Trek experience and timeline.  It is a bummer this one was cut so short as it feels incomplete by the time you get to season 4 episode 22 you find yourself really getting into the characters and storyline then BAM, it's over.  While this was on TV I did not really watch it, but years later I really enjoyed it on video.  I think they just timed this show wrong and put it on TV too soon.  Someone else mentioned Trek fatigue and I think there is some credibility to that idea.  Had they waited to put this on TV a few years later or so it might have made the whole 7 years instead of whimpering out after only 4.  Oh well.  Hopefully we get another Trek series in the future, until then it is video reruns of all the great star treks.
B001UV4XJ2|5.0|I do not give a hoot about the availability of digital copies, it is not something I use or care about since once a film is 10 or 12 years old it will be streaming all over the place on my subscription service anyway. For me blue ray is fine and having the standard DVD with it for now is nice if you still have devices that don't have blue ray drives on hand like I do. So all the issues people were having w/ Ultraviolet and digital rights/availability are not an issue for me and my rating is based on the film itself.<br /><br />This is now one of my favorites of the Harry Potter films, perhaps the one I like the best of all. Well done! A really fitting end to this series, it doesn't disappoint, brings all the loose ends together neatly and retains the \\"epic adventure\\" aspect of the earlier films. Plus, it offers a more mature moral, ethical, and philosophical \\"message\\" in its content that is understated in the other films but rightly so. The characters are just now at adulthood where the depth of these issues becomes meaningful and realized.<br /><br />After watching it I went back and watched Part 1 again. I was disappointed in Part 1 the first time around and did not find it up to par with the other films - thought it was dull, the plot dragged, and lacked the innovative and engaging aspects and little details of Rowling's \\"world\\" that the other films demonstrated. I have to say that Part I seems much much better to me after watching Part 2, especially given the culmination of the deeper messaging I just described in the above paragraph of this review.<br /><br />Overall I have been really pleased with this series of films and found the end of the story to be well executed and satisfying despite that they are a children's story. But then again this was the original intent of Star Wars and Tolkien wrote the Hobbit initially for his own children.<br /><br />Adult friends of mine suggested I read the Potter books and so I have started on the first, breezing through it of course. Rowling is no Tolkien, let me just say that. The story elements engage, but the writing is remarkably curt and pedestrian, even for a children's novel. I have been told this improves/becomes more age appropriate as one moves on through the books, though.<br /><br />I must say I enjoy and am thoroughly entertained by the little world and characters Rowling has created and so enjoy the films immensely no doubt due to the high quality of the productions as far as script, direction, acting, costume, sets, and effects are concerned.<br /><br />Top notch all the way around. I recommend the entire series if you enjoy the fantasy genre but struggle to find HIGH QUALITY production outside of the LOTR series.of course. Rowling is no Tolkien, let me just say that.

B0041QSZJM|2.0|I bought this CD based on the samples, but this is really just an attempt at different styles from someone that doesn't really get those styles.  I really like this type of CD with a bit of culture mixed with familiarity at times, but this one doesn't feel cultured appropriately...it's a \\"wanna be\\" CD.  A few of the songs are worth buying, though, so maybe buy them one at a time as a download.
B004GJYR7I|5.0|Received in a timely manner, well wrapped and intact, as advertised.  Nary a problem. Thank you so much for your quality service.   \\"Bringing Up Baby\\"  is one of my all time favorite 'screwball comedies,' and I've long wished for a copy to add to my video library.    \\"Crazy like a fox\\" flighty socialite Hepburn and spaced-out scientist Grant together make this film a superb anti-depressant, should you so require a lift. The wonderful supporting cast rounds out the insanity.   Never a dull moment when zany Hepburn/Susan is in the scene. Somehow, she manages to draw everyone into her antics, all intended, of course, to snare Mr. Grant for whom she has developed an unlikely affection.  Apparently, veteran character actor Charles Ruggles coached Ms. Hepburn during the filming of the hilarious jail-house scene, as she was playing it much too seriously, was unsure how to proceed.   His coaching payed off. Her comic enactment as a hard-core 'moll,\\" including the description of nerdy Grant's womanizing ways highlights one of the best set pieces in the film.

0060775858|5.0|I discovered this book pretty late in life, and at first found it pretty odd, but have come to love it more and more. The poem is quite lovely and soothing (if a bit creepy, like old-time nursery rhymes) and the art is very striking and memorable.
6300182355|5.0|Shot in England with a little sensuality to go with its PG rating finds Flash and Dale along with Hans in Ming's Court.  Ming takes an immediate liking to Dale and his daughter has a fondness in her heart for Flash. The Court gets busted up and Flash gets konked out.  Ming's daughter saves him.  Ming wants to marry Dale and promises not to blast her into space...until such time as he grows weary of her.  Meanwhile Flash hooks up with the Hawkmen. A young Timothy Dalton is part of the cast.  Its a fun space movie that leaves space for a sequal at the end.  I don't know if any of the main chracters ever appeared in another movie again.
B0041KKYBA|4.0|I wish I had known this and my money would be in a mattress. Of course, you know there's probably some liberty taken with these things, but even if 50% of this is true, we have been taken for a big ride by the financial services industry.  Wake up everyone and watch this.
B00005JLKB|5.0|A delight as we see from the very beginning Clark showing up in a meteor shower that brings Kryptonite with him, and in so doing killing his first loves's (Lana) parents and affecting Alexander Luthor for the rest of his life.  When they are older Clark and Lex meet when Clark pulls Lex from a car wreck, Johnathon shows up and wraps a red blanket around Clark's shoulders. (It looks like a cape! Cool.)  Most of the season utilizes elements, electricity in the first episode, where we see Clark as a Christ figure on a cross for the annual school prank. Fire is in the second episode, bugs, and aging.  We see Clark pine for Lana even though she has a boyfriend and Chole pine for Clark.  For the season-ending cliff-hanger a tornado blows into town as Johnathan tries to protect Clark from a reporter who has figured our Clark's secret.  A fine use of story telling about the greatest superhero of them all.
1897299214|2.0|175 pages in which the author explores a small part of the country with his handlers, while working for a French company producing animation. He eats at the restaurants provided for foreigners, complains about the food, dances at the nightclub provided for foreigners, and devotes almost no time, effort, thought, or consideration to the morality of even working for a company that outsources work to North Korea, never mind the money he's contributing to support a brutal dictatorship. The whole book is written in a \\"Ha ha, look how strange they are!\\" way, with no real consideration of the moral and human crimes committed by the North Korean regime or the desperate plight of the North Korean people. What a missed opportunity. Just trash.  He closes the book by visiting the \\"Museum of Imperialist Occupation\\", and after going through room after room depicting the torture of Koreans by the Japanese and Americans, says his female guide is so beautiful that he can think of a few tortures he'd love to inflict on her. Charming.

0743298039|4.0|I enjoyed this well-written book almost as much as those mentioned by Diane Setterfield: such as Jane Eyre. Very good structure to the story: great beginning, middle and end - this was a page-turner.  The setting was magnificent, the sense of place such that I imagined the castle, the plot is intriguing and full of suspense.  Sibling rivalry and \\"twinship\\" are beguilingly portrayed.  The mystery kept me turning the pages, the scene and setting were haunting, and the denouement entirely surprising and satisfactory.
B002GY9F9K|5.0|realy smart realy funny realy well done realy good very entertaining great story line lots of fun.. no wonder it got cancelled!..lol
0316098329|5.0|The language of a five-year-old, the creativity of a mother keeping both herself and her son healthy and sane, and the plot itself combine to make this a book you can't put down. Fearing it would be depressing, I reluctantly began the book and then couldn't put it down. This is warm, exciting and insightful; I highly recommend it. I have been reading Donoghue since Slammerkin and Life Mask. Those were wonderful reads but this shows her maturation as an author.

1423113454|2.0|This was a mediocre book at best, but what really ticked me off was that the story was peppered with complaints about how racist white people are. The two main characters are the son and daughter of a black father and a white mother.  The son looks black and the daughter looks white, so the son is frequently discriminated against, and he has to be especially careful of the police. One of the father's lessons is that he needs to be constantly aware of how people look at him because he is black.<br /><br />Do the kids reading this book really need to be spoon fed this type of garbage?  Is the author's intent to teach children, who have a tendency to internalize the stories they read, that if they are a minority they are automatically a victim and if they are white they are automatically racist? And watch out for those racist police!<br /><br />The irony is that this book is a perfect example of how racism is excused and perpetuated.
B0009K7QZ8|5.0|Alright, I will start this off by admitting that I am a 27 year old male and my friends gather once a year for an OC marathon weekend.  I promise you it is much cooler than it sounds.  Anyway, for the second annual this year we threw in season 2 after seeing that it was only $9.99 (now $11.99 at this writing).  Let me tell you, while often overlooked as a letdown to a spectacular Season 1, Season 2 brings the heat.  I think this has been forgotten over time.  Clearly, it deserves a number 2 ranking (1,2,4, worst season ever: 3) in the OC season pantheon.<br /><br />Yes, there are some misses: Mallpisode, Any scene with Mischa Barton that did not include Olivia Wilde, Lindsay/Ryan awful romance, most of the Zach/Seth comic book stuff, and of course DJ trying to steal Ryan's thunder as Marissa's boyfriend who doesn't talk.<br /><br />But to judge a season you need to look at the hits, and there were many: Great Caleb season all around, Kiki's drinking problem (fresh margs anyone?), Olivia Wilde incredible breakout lesbian performance, The Bait Shop somehow becoming the number 1 performing venue in the country, Christmakkuh 2, Julie Coops, and Summer/Seth Spiderman scene.  Plus, WHO KILLED CALEB?  Spoiler.<br /><br />You could probably skip like 6-8 episodes (since theres 24 which is absurd) to enjoy this even more.  I recommend drinking heavily while watching.
B002ZG98Z0|4.0|I don't understand the other reviewers who said the first movie was better. SATC 2 is much more light-hearted, funny and less Carrie-centric than the first one. SATC 1 was a real downer, and the whole story centered on how Carrie's wedding went awry because of contrivances such as the little girl's misplacement of her cell phone, Mr. Big's nervousness, and Carrie's addiction to designer wedding dresses. I also didn't like the underlying message of the first film, which is, if a guy feels too intimidated by a fancy wedding, forgo your fantasies and get married at City Hall to make him happy. Hello, what about a compromise?<br /><br />The second one is more of an ensemble piece, with lots of laughs arising from Samantha, the Irish nanny, Liza Minnelli, culture clash, etc. Maybe for some fans it's too funny, since they prefer the soap opera aspects of the first one. For me, the fun spirit of the 2nd is worth watching repeatedly any day over watching Carrie cry her eyes out again over Mr. Big.

B004X80QNG|5.0|I've never left a rating before, but had to leave one for this app. I tried just about every calendar app out there, and I always found something lacking. When this one came up as a free app of the day (thank you Amazon!) I figured it couldn't hurt to try. This app has everything .... it is easy to use and I can find exactly what I am looking for without having to go from screen to screen. It also features a color coding option, I can tell at a fast glance who has what going on that day (big plus for me being that I have a very family). One of the best parts are the templates you can make. It take a few minutes to create them but once you do they are incredibly easy and fast to use. It makes putting an appointment in your calendar very fast (especiallly when you are the Dr and have to move quick lol).  I will say that I haven't synced it yet so I can't vouch for that option; but I LOVE everything else. Try it....you won't be sorry!

B000OPPBEQ|5.0|At $33 with free shipping and handling, I almost couldn't be happier with this purchase. It's just an amazing deal.  Granted, some people hate the Matrix sequels. I'm not one of them. I see what's wrong with them, but they get so many things right that once you get past that first viewing the minor flaws are easy to ignore.  I've seen all of these films several times, but this was my first time watching them on Blu-Ray. So, so, SO much better than DVD! And while most of the bonus materials are standard definition, it didn't bother me much.  There are hours upon hours of bonuses. It's like an all-you-can-eat buffet of Matrixness. After each film, I went through and watched the bonus clips I was most interested in. They were fantastic, and I feel like I barely scratched the surface, so I know if I want to go back and see more anytime I can. (I highly recommend the bit where the actors talk about their roles in The Matrix Reloaded. The Keymaker guy is so great.)  I hadn't watched the Animatrix films before. They were better than I expected! The Wachowski brothers came up with the story for some of them and Don Davis did a lot of the music. Not up to par with the main trilogy, but they're very enjoyable and they fill in bits and pieces of story you miss in the feature films. The same goes for the footage shot for Enter the Matrix (directed by the Wachowskis and included on the Reloaded disc). However, I've read that over two hours of film were shot for that game, and I could only find ~50 minutes of it on the disc. Still, it definitely filled in some gaps for me and was satisfying to see.  I haven't even gotten to the Matrix Experience disc, but I already feel like I got way, way more than my money's worth with this collection. If you dig the Matrix, don't hesitate. Pick this up. And if you don't have a Blu-Ray player? Uh, buy a PS3 and pick this up!

B004LWZW4W|5.0|I am a huge fan of the original Planet of the Apes movies, I have the collection on Blu-ray and I watch them often. I was excited about a new installment in the series and I was more excited when I heard it was not only a reboot but at sequel to the original. Fans of the originals may pick up things that newcomers may not. Little things that are said and character traits of the apes that I believe will lead into and become characters from the original.<br /><br />One thing I thought about after I watched it was that if you took away the CGI apes, you don't have a movie. All the apes are fake throughout the entire film. The human actors are not near as entertaining as the apes and they lacked solid acting. It was a little corny at times, especially with the female lead character. The facial expressions of the apes are amazing and they greatly captured the power and emotion of Caesar. All in all it was a very entertaining movie and was a great build up for the series and movies to come.<br /><br />The PQ and AQ were great. Sharp clear images with great depth. Very strong bass and crystal clear highs. A lot of fun.

0140067477|4.0|Lately, I have been really interested and fascinated about the whole philosophy of Taoism. I have become very intrigued with the reading of the short stories and trying to find the meaning of each one. Living a life of simplicity and harmony has really appealled to me lately.<br /><br />I came across this book and decided to give it a read. As I continue to learn about Taoism and all the great insights and wisdom that you can derive from Taoism I needed something that would speak to me on a level that made sense. I believed this book did the job.<br /><br />I found the book interesting and engaging. Using Winnie the Pooh I was to begin to construct a basic understanding of Taoism.<br /><br />I am currently reading some more books on Taoism and trying to find ways to incorporate more of the beliefs into my way of life. This book was a great entry point for me to begin my learning journey.<br /><br />There were some poems that I really liked, but in the end I wrote down a few quotes that stuck out to me.<br /><br />** Knowledge and Experience do not necessarily speak the same language.**<br />**....isn't knowledge that comes from experience more valuable than knowledge that doesn't**<br />**one disease, long life; no disease, short life**<br />**easiest way to get rid of a minus is to cahnge it into a plus**<br />**Tao does not do, but nothing is not done.**<br />**flow like water, reflect like a mirro, respond like an echo**<br /><br />Great stuff right there. I recomend this read. I am also interested in reading more and expanding my thoughts and knowledge.

0142418471|5.0|What are the odds of finding two Will Graysons in one city, in the same place, at the same time? Well, it happens in Will Grayson, Will Grayson, and this random meeting of the two Will Graysons changes both of their lives forever.   I have read books by both Levithan and Green and this novel completely resonates with their personalities. Once again Green gives us a nerdy out-cast boy and Levithan gives us a non-stereotypical gay boy, both trying to figure out their life; however, like always, they both give a unique twist to the story, giving us a funny, heart-warming novel. I will admit, though, that I didn't like either Will Grayson at the beginning very much, but that was just the authors way of showing how much the boys needed to change and grow.
B005FITIGO|5.0|It starts with a firing and ends with a burying - and the dog got the best of the deal.  I rated this very good movie 5 stars \\"not\\" because it was completely stellar in delivery - but because it nailed everything I have observed happening in the market over the years - things I had difficulty believing at the time, and because I did not believe it, lived to rue the day I did not take heed of what I suspected to be the truth.  And that is that none of these people at the top really know what is transpiring out there in their Never, Never Land of electronic trading; they don't understand the ramifications of their \\"leaps and straddles\\", \\" butterflies and compound derivatives leverage\\" because they never had to;  and rely entirely on underlings that don't, for the most part have a good understanding either; that silence is bought, used and trod on as long as is practical;  and that financial instruments the world markets depend on (and the individual investor who has been sold the biggest bill of goods) are knowingly spun out of thin air and kept circulating in a round-robin tail chasing scenario that catches the tail up to the head every decade or so.  There is no incentive to correct, because the Piper is always paid in full by those on the lower levels and has no need to use his flute. (calliope may be a better choice here)  The movie didn't go far enough though because there is the \\"next act\\" -  the men of hindsight who come in to \\"fix\\" things are the same men of vision that were always there - and a new decade begins anew with a fresh set of suckers.  Kevin Spacey does his usual good job as Sam, the \\"yes man\\" department head who is relied upon by Jeremy Irons to keep things lined out - Irons gives the performance that really comes across as the most believable character portrayal of the film - that of the ruthless, untouchable head of a Wall Street trading and financial clearing firm.  He epitomizes the nature of the beast.  Sam buries his beloved dog the same night he has lost everything else, but it wasn't only the dog that died penniless.  This film belongs in the category with \\"Wall Street\\" - although it may never achieve the same status - and I recommend it.  One thing is certain.  It will either wipe the word \\"paranoia\\" from your vocabulary or assign it a whole new meaning - \\"cautious\\".
1416914285|3.0|The only good thing this book has going for it is the concept. Otherwise, it would have gotten 2 stars instead of 3. I also liked the world.   Other than that, this book isn't that good. The writing style reminds me that I'm being told a story instead of being there with the characters.   A lot of the so-called 'mystery' was easy to guess and there were many times that I wondered if Clary was an imbecile since she couldn't put 2+2 together. There was only really one shocking thing that I didn't see coming. Otherwise, there was a bad job done hiding clues and keeping the mystery.  Some parts of the storytelling were sloppy. The whole book - except the chapter told by Luke - is from Clary's POV, but the author switches for one page to Jace's POV. This is because Clary is about to discover a pivotal part of the plot and I guess the writer didn't want the reader to be there when Clary discovered but to be there when she showed it to Jace as a surprise. BTW, I also guess what she was doing before she supposedly surprised the reader and Jace about what she could do with a drawing. Again, a mystery with no mystery. It was also jarring because the reader has spent 3/4 of the book in Clary's POV and we come to this one page that's in Jace's POV. It was too sloppy as far as I'm concerned. The writer should have found a better way to keep the supposed mystery rather than switching to Jace's POV to try to hide it.   This book was entirely too long. I bet a good 200 pages of insignificant info could be edited out without messing up the storyline. The author loves descriptions and they're tedious. Many useless things gets a good paragraph or two of detailed descriptions. Nothing.but.description. It was so annoying that I started skipping over any amount of description I came across. The author also loves dingy, dirty places because it was used so much in this novel that it overstayed it's welcome. A lot of it was repetitive; she described different scenes the same way.   One thing that I actually did like was the name Clary. I think it's a pretty name.   I will not be reading the rest of the series and I most likely won't be reading any other books by this author.

0375842209|5.0|I really loved The Book Thief especially because the narration was so different. Death as a narrator gives the books a different dimension. Death adds his own commentary and it gives you the feeling that the story in unfolding before you. You know everything that is going on in Liesel's head but also everyone else's in the story. Death also tells you what will happen in the future even if I didn't like what was going to happen but it did help me prepare myself for it. I like how bits and pieces gave you an idea what was happening with the war outside of Molching so I had an idea where Hitler was without just knowing they years. I also liked this story because it is from a different perspective of the Holocaust. It tells the story of a young girl who grew up in the middle of Hitler's regime and how not everyone sided with Hitler and what it could have been like for any normal person back then. It showed that the war affected everyone: their food was rationed, the poor were left with even less money, and anyone that didn't conform to the party was ostracized and shunned. Sometimes I felt the story was true because the characters felt so real sometimes. Many of the characters were fleshed out really well and you felt like they were real people. There was never a minor character. Each and everyone seemed to have a hidden pain or a secret that you would have never guessed and they all made the story feel more real. My one problem was I did like how Death would give you snapshots of the future sometimes I wish they weren't mentioned so I wouldn't have them hanging over my head for the bulk of the book but I do believe it did make the actions of the characters even more meaningful because you know what they would culminate to. It made me relish some of the moments between the characters because I knew one would not make it.

0385534639|4.0|The promotional description for this novel about two young illusionists unknowingly pitted against each other in a magical circus is a little misleading. You're expecting a Harry Potter-like showdown between good and evil, with one having to kill the other in their final duel (which I expect is what the publishers want us to think in order to read the book).<br /><br />In actuality, (spoiler alert!) the competition never involves a duel, but the creation of magical circus exhibits which somehow so emotionally drains the two illusionists that one of them is supposed to commit suicide rather than continue with it. The contest is further complicated by the fact that the two participants fall in love and each is ready to sacrifice themselves in order that the other one might live.<br /><br />I thought this premise was a little far-fetched, but once you accept it, this book is actually very enjoyable. Ms. Morgenstern has an extremely original, whimsical imagination and a poetic writing style that makes the descriptions of the various tents and the magical exhibits inside them a delight to read, and makes you wish there was a real-life night circus you could visit. There is a sub-plot involving three minor characters which takes place several years in the future, which can be a little confusing at first. But once you get used to it, this future sub-plot actually creates some subtle suspense as you continue reading to find out what happens when the two plot-lines finally come together. It's a good thing, too, because without this understated tension, the story is actually pretty slow-moving. If they ever make a movie about this book, they'll probably have to inject a little more action into it to make it acceptable to today's audiences.<br /><br />Not an emotional roller-coaster of a story, but definitely worth reading, if only for the beautiful descriptions.

B0064NTZJO|5.0|I saw Drive opening night, and I wasn't expecting what I saw at all. This film is a beautifully shot, ultra-violent, well-rounded drama. Winding-Refn delievers to us a twisted, yet beautiful, story of a quiet man who is pushed to his limits when the girl he loves is put into danger. The story is simple, yet the characters are complex, as usually they are in a Refn film.   Ryan Gosling gives the performance of his career as Driver, who is much like Eastwood's Man With No Name in The Good, The Bad, And The Ugly. Very quiet, keeps to himself, but if you mess with him... Bad things happen.  The film has a very retro feel to it, almost channeling an 80's John Hughes film by blasting out a great soundtrack filled with electronic beats and slow love songs. The retro feel to the film is a very new and refreshing look at cinema. The movie is slow, and very quiet, but when the violence starts, it's stomach churning. The movie is definitely not for the faint of heart. It made me cringe, and I love violent films.  I would definitely reccommend this movie to anyone who is a fan of anything. The movie has a little bit of everything for everyone. 10/10

B0013BCWEW|5.0|I was familiar with the \\"ZODIAC KILLER\\" of San Francisco long before this film was released. I LOVE true crime novels and ALWAYS Love a good mystery. Who doesn't? Needless to say that this film was right up my alley. I however, had no idea it was going to be half as engaging, entertaining, suspensful and dramatic as it was. \\"ZODIAC\\" in my opinion is the best film of 2007 without question. David Fincher (FIGHT CLUB, PANIC ROOM, SEVEN) directs this dazziling masterpiece that could only be better if it was longer. I only say that because the movie is so fascinating that I ran out after the movie and bought both of Robert Graysmith's books on the subject \\"ZODIAC\\" & \\"ZODIAC UNMASKED\\". The film is based on BOTH books. Jake Gyllenhaal (BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN, JARHEAD, DONNIE DARKO) plays Graysmith in the film and is marvelous as the obsessed cartoonist. The film also stars the always magnificent Robert Downey Jr. (IRON MAN 1 & 2, NATURAL BORN KILLERS, CHAPLIN) as Paul Avery a reporter investigating the Zodiac murders for the San Fancisco Chronicle. Mark Ruffalo (ALL THE KINGS MEN, THE AVENGERS, SHUTTER ISLAND) stars as Inspector David Toschi, who follows all the leads to a conclusion he never gets. I couldn't reccomend this movie ENOUGH! A+

0670022950|5.0|*A full summary of this book is available here: [[ASIN:B00IC1GVW0 An Executive Summary of Steven Pinker's 'The Better Angels of Our Nature: Why Violence Has Declined']]<br /><br />The main argument: We are fresh out of a century that featured two world wars often considered to be the most destructive in history (not to mention numerous inter-state, civil and tribal wars and genocides), and are persistently submerged in news coverage that features more than its fair share of military conflict, terrorism, murder, gang violence, rape, domestic violence, child abuse and animal cruelty. As such, we may be forgiven for thinking that human beings are at least as violent as ever, if not more so. Indeed, many are persuaded that the onset of civilization some 5000 years ago has had none but a de-civilizing effect on the world and its people, and has led to an increasing level of violence as state hierarchies have grown in size and complexity, and military technology has advanced.<br /><br />However, in his new book `The Better Angels of Our Nature: Why Violence Has Declined', the Harvard scholar Steven Pinker argues that, all appearances to the contrary, an in depth look at the evidence reveals that violence has in fact decreased world-wide and in virtually every category we can think of since civilization began (albeit unevenly in both time and geography, and with a few blips along the way). The evidence comes not only from anecdotal and narrative tales but from an exhaustive look at the statistics, which is altogether very convincing.<br /><br />Specifically, Pinker cites 6 historical shifts or trends that have brought with them a reduction in violence: 1) The Pacification Process: the shift from traditional hunting and gathering societies to state-run societies based on agriculture, which saw a drop in lives lost by all violent means, including both warfare and homicide (when adjusted for population sizes); 2) The Civilizing Process: the rise of kingdoms and the increase of global commerce, beginning at the end of the Middle Ages and extending into the 20th century, which saw another massive drop in homicide rates and other violent crime; 3) The Humanitarian Revolution: the rise of science and enlightenment values in the 17th and 18th centuries, extending into the 20th century, which has seen decreasing trends in religious wars, superstitious killings, slavery, torture, corporal punishment (including capital punishment), and animal cruelty; 4) The Long Peace: The post WWII period, which has seen a massive decrease in wars fought by and between the world's major powers; 5) The New Peace: the post Cold-War period, which (despite popular perceptions) has seen drops in inter-state war, civil war, genocide, and terrorism; and finally 6) The Rights Revolutions: the civil rights era in many Western cultures over the past 50-60 years, which has seen drops in both forgiving attitudes and violence connected to racial and religious intolerance, homophobia, and violence against women, children and animals.<br /><br />In addition to this historical survey, Pinker also tackles the problem of trying to explain why this reduction in violence has taken place (each of these enterprises could fill a book unto itself, hence the generous length of the work--roughly 800 pages in all, and 700 before notes). The first key to understanding why violence has declined is to understand why it exists in the first place, and has been a prevalent feature of our past (and continues to exist in the present). Violent behaviour, Pinker argues, is partly the result of certain aspects of our human nature which incline us to behave violently under certain circumstances. These biological inclinations towards violence were laid down over the course of our evolutionary past as a result of their success in helping our ancestors survive and reproduce in the environment in which they evolved. In other words, the natural inclination to push others around (under certain circumstances) in order to get the good things of life (from a biological perspective) proved to be a successful strategy for our ancestors, and so was passed down to future generations, and ultimately us.<br /><br />Pinker identifies 5 distinct motivators in the name of which violence is committed, each of which with its own unique or overlapping biological backing. These are the so-called inner demons of our nature, and they are 1) Predation: the desire to attain certain ends in the most straightforward route possible (mainly biological resources, such as food, and mates); 2) Dominance: the desire for status and prestige; 3) Revenge: the desire to avenge past insults and injuries;  4) Sadism: the fascination and appetite to witness, and even inflict, suffering upon others; and 5) Ideology: a susceptibility to belief in ideologies (which are often understood as justifying the sacrificing of people that stand in the way of their fulfillment).<br /><br />While evolution may have equipped us with these motivations, as well as the inclination to use violence to attain them (under certain circumstances), evolution has also equipped us with other motivations and faculties that incline us away from violence, and towards peace and cooperation (again, under certain conditions). These are the so-called better angels of our nature and they are: 1) Empathy, in the sense of having sympathy and compassion for others; 2) Self-control: the ability to control our impulses; 3) A Moral Sense, which includes not just an innate appreciation of the golden rule, but other facets as well, such as a susceptibility to beliefs regarding purity, authority, and in-group cohesion. (It is important to note that not all expressions of the moral sense contribute to more peace (hint: see #3 & #5 in the `inner demons' section above); and finally 4) Reason, meaning the capacity to remove ourselves from our own parochial interests, and recognize each individual's interest as being fundamentally equivalent; and also the capacity to identify violence as a problem to be solved, rather than a game to be won, and the ability to offer up solutions with regards to how the problem might in fact be minimized.<br /><br />The evidence that both our inner demons and our better angels are a part of our biological nature come from evolutionary psychology, neuroscience, and a host of very intriguing psychological experiments, and is once again very convincing.<br /><br />With regards to explaining why violence has decreased, Pinker points to the idea that in each of the historical shifts away from violence, some historical force (or forces) has acted to enhance the influence of our better angels at the expense of our inner demons. In other words, various environmental forces have worked to elicit the more peaceable side of our nature, and suppress the more violent one, thus leading to less violent behaviour. Pinker identifies 5 historic forces here. They are: 1) Leviathan: the monopoly of violence by the state, which has decreased the rewards of private individuals to resort to violence themselves, and whose efficacy improves as governments become less corrupt and more just towards their citizens; 2) Commerce: the increase in global commerce, which increases cooperation and reduces hostility between states; 3) Feminization: the increasing influence of women in the realms of politics and economics (as women are, by nature, less violent than men) 4) Cosmopolitanism: the increasing exposure to new ideas and other peoples afforded by increased mobility, literacy and media, which decreases parochialism, and increases the range of people for whom each of us feels sympathy; and which also allows for the progress of ideas, which leads us into the final historic force; 5) The Escalator of Reason: the ever accumulating body of knowledge and good judgement afforded by the application of human reason to our questions and problems, which has lessened our tendency to privilege our own interests overthat of others; and which also allows us to see that the cycle of violence is destructive, and provides us with ways of reducing it.<br /><br />This is the most important book of the past decade.

The star power makes it compelling and irresistible; though they're young, you can't take your eyes off as they create sordid pits and traps for others to fall into.<br /><br />It helps if you're familiar with the original film, Les Liaisons Dangereuses, as context. To that film, this one is a spirited companion.<br /><br />Don't expect auteur-quality directing or atmosphere; it's not that kind of movie. Instead, it's a movie about personalities, power, sex.

B00338QENI|3.0|I am sure the reader of this review finds It  difficult to read such an abysmal critique of a bestselling book. I read the Immortal Life with excitement, in part due to the praise by the author of  [[ASIN:1400064163 Unbroken: A World War II Story of Survival, Resilience, and Redemption]], and recommendations from collegues. The book, although insightful in the events of the Lacks family, often stretches the length story to the point where, ironically, the privacy of the Lacks family is risked. The author writes of a disease found the in medical files and says she is forbidden to reveal its name. Further, Skloot writes of the aunt being in underwear in a wheelchair. Such gossip is questionable and represents the essence of Ms. Skloots 'journalism.' Moreover, much of the book is about the author's interraction with the Lacks family. Multiple fights with Henrietta's daughter are documented, and the loss of contact with family medmbers is widely recounted. Moreover, and author repeatedly recounts the basic outline of the story,, as if the reader has not bothered to read the book jacket. The author's self-involvement is increasingly disappointing as she breaks her journalistic identity and becomes an agent for the Lacks family. The bias in the reporting  is appalling, and only a few pages are devoted to the legal standings of the HeLa case. The innocence of the Johns Hopkins doctors is seldom explored.   If you are easily entertained, this book may very well be for you. Although the timeline moves slowly the author makes it feel otherwise. Be wary of excess praise, and consider other reviews before reading.

But it is definitely not made for Kindle Fire and in fact, the packaging that it comes with clearly states that it is made for Kindle 3 (which is the code name for Kindle Touch and the $79 \\"Kindle\\").<br /><br />If you buy this for Kindle Fire, you will have to stretch the elastic bands and pray they never snap or that the Fire just slides out on you.<br /><br />If you purchase it for Kindle Touch or the now cheapest and newest Kindle, you will be a very happy camper as it is specifically made for these Kindles. However, it is a little \\"long\\" for them and with the Kindle it was made for being so light, it adds a certain amount of weight to it that for me wasn't worth the incredible aesthetics since there are other equally lovely cases available that are more functional if you plan to use the Kindle Fire to watch Video.<br /><br />I will update my review once I hear from Amazon. If they change this over and list it as a Kindle Touch and Kindle cover for Kindle 3 black & white line, I will change my review accordingly.<br /><br />Also, please excuse the awful quality of my phone's video! Doing it one-handed, I realize that it was mostly a bust. The close-ups of the elastic bands around the Kindle Touch and Kindle Fire are not as clear as they were on my phone. I did also take photos that you may view under customer photos though they make me question the 8 megapixel camera on my phone.<br /><br />Update: After making Amazon aware of my concerns and customer complaints over the fit of this cover with regards to Kindle Fire, it is under review in the catalog department to decide whether it has been set aside for Kindle Fire by mistake when it might have been meant for the smaller new Kindles.<br /><br />As someone commented, this may be unlikely. It is in the best interest of Amazon to advertise if for the Fire. Also, it may be possible that two types of this cover are shipping out and that is why while some complain the cover does not fit the Fire at all, others say it does with a really tight fit and still others say it fits perfectly.

Words cannot begin to describe this beautiful film interpretation of Bizet's masterpiece. The filming was done in Spain and Migenes and Domingo are superb!  The music ranges from the lusty to the sublime.  If you cannot handle too strong of sexual excitement, beware that Julia Migenes' gypsy will give you heart palpatations! If you are a lover of opera, this dvd belongs in your collection. Thanks.[[ASIN:B0054YIQLW Carmen]]

B0060AY6FO|1.0|Anticlimactic. Bad plot. Boring. Just some of the words to describe this book. The characters were not themselves. Many errors weigh comsistancy and very disappointing
B000FCK8ZK|5.0|I loved this book. It exceeded my expectations as being a Dexter fan with story and characters. Compared to the series, the story is simple with regards to number of characters and adventures, but is rich and complex with describing Dexter's thoughts and emotions. Dexter in the story is different from the Dexter in the show and I loved the book \\"Dexter\\" much better. I do not think I will read the rest of Dexter series. I am worried that the rest may not be as good as the first one (that is exactly what happened with Dexter series and quality wise it just went down). However, I recommend this one to everyone especially Dexter fans.
082300659X|5.0|This is the most accessible book on classical drawing that I have ever read. I own all 3 of this author's books. This book is a whole new level of growth from Ms. Aristides. I feel with this volume her skills at teaching have exceeded her exceptional gifts in drawing. The lessons here will be familiar to advanced students while still offereing many valuable new insights. But it's not too over-the-head for a beginner to benefit. it's a fantastic opportunity to learn from a master. The DVD really helps to underscore the lessons in the book and get a better understanding of the author's voice. For those who are serious about improving their drawing skills, I could not recommend any book more highly.
B000063Y8F|2.0|This product was not made in the USA, it was made in China. Considering that, the price seemed a little steep.
B005PTQPU0|4.0|We knew we'd like this one - and we do.   Not disappointed.   She certainly reminds me of a classic favorite - Laura Nyro.  She is not bound by the usual format of pop/jazz woman singers.
0439813786|5.0|I was very impressed with this book. I'm giving it as Christmas present to my granddaughter. I like that it was in black and white.  I read it in one day.
1400052181|5.0|I was amazed by this story and am thankful to have read it.  It delves deeply into the advancement of science vs patient rights in the beginning of the 20th century- and the effect on future generations.  It is intertwined into a story of a brave woman and her family.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|I was really looking forward to see this movie as I missed my chance on theaters.  This is a great movie ! Acting is awesome, especially for the maids. It is a funny, sad, touching movie where you get attached to every character.  I believe this is a close picture to reality as it was at that time and I think this is a great lesson to learn...  I do recommend this movie to whoever wants to share a touching moment with family and friends !
B0064BCNA4|4.0|if only the sounds were not laggy it would be way more fun. Not bad though. my kid would love it
B004EPYZTE|1.0|When viewing the opening sequence, I could tell that this movie was going to be incredible. Unfortunately, it was incredibly bad. Bad movie gimmicks and story telling. Then the first scene with the grown Conan in conversation has him acting like a goofy kid. What? I couldn't make it through any further. About 20 minutes in, I left and found something better to do. Disappointing after going back and reading the first 10 original books.

B005DOL0R0|5.0|First off, I do not see one thing that I would inform a potential buyer of this sleeve that contrasts what one should expect. Meaning, this sleeve is exactly what I thought I was receiving.  It fits my Kindle Fire snugly and securely. The padding is not immense, but I did not expect a great amount or want that much since I wanted a sleeve, not a case. The feature I appreciate most in the Fire is its slenderness, therefore I only wanted a sleeve to add a bit of added protection without the cost of adding too much bulk. This sleeve does exactly that for me.  Secondly, in regards to the infamous \\"smell,\\" I did not experience that with mine. It could be an earlier production method that caused the problem for some of the reviewers, but when I stuck my nose to my Fire, I smelled precisely what I would expect a sleeve to smell like...in other words, I barely smelled anything and would have never even attempted to find out the smell but for the earlier reviews discussing it (which still hold merit!). Perhaps only the manufacturer and/or Amazon could tell us for sure if something was changed in the manufacturing process.  Lastly, I am OK with the price (gasp!). You should always expect first party companies to charge a premium for their hardware's accessories. There are higher profit margins to be gained from the unnecessary \\"stuff\\" than the original hardware. Is the material and design worth 30 dollars? Absolutely not. But given this sleeve 1) has Amazon's name, 2) is intended for an Amazon product, and 3) is made solely for this particular model (Fire) of Amazon's hardware (Kindle), I am comfortable paying a bit more than a 3rd party product that in addition to not be developing for its own equipment, could be soliciting products that are intended for different models of hardware.   With that said, I rate this product 5 out of 5 stars.
B005LY4B0A|5.0|Fun game, definately worth a dollar.  Way better since music has been added to the opening scene of the game.
B005HV6Y5W|5.0|The Best film of the year that almost everybody else hates. Loved it. My other two faves are Midnight in Paris and Rise of Planet of the Apes.
B005R4255C|5.0|Love the songs, love the remixes, love the energy ! I think that Michael would love it too...  And looking forward to see it live!
B004O3YGMC|3.0|Doesn't use RDP. which is a pain because you have to install software on each computer you want to.connect to. Oh well definitely worth a dollar.
B002KSPKRS|1.0|I got this X41 EARFARCE HEADSET FROM TURTLE BEACH as a christmas gift. I was all excited up until the time I went to hook it up to my XBOX 360 Elite only to be let down that it would not work on my system.... Let me explain.  The AV cable that transmits the video and sound to the TV did not have an optical port? I guess the R-Tards at MICROSOFT gave me one of there OUT DATED AV cables?.... So I went on a field trip to Walmart, Gamestop, and Best Buy and got a new AV cable adapter with an optical port. But then I get home and low and behold the friggen adapter didn't have a video port, so not only did I need this stupid adapter that I already spent 22 bones on I also needed to go on another field trip to Walmart to get a friggen 35 dollar HDMI cable!!!  So I go home plug all this stuff in, only to find out that apparently the optical cable or the RF device itself is not picking up the sound off my XBOX!!! WTH? So I was off to Wally World yet again! To buy an analog audio cable for another 15 bones!   All in all I wasted 77 dollars, 5 gallons of gas, and about 6 hours of my time trying to hook this headset up to my XBOX!!! It sounds great in 5.1 BUT!!!... I STILL DON'T GET THE 7.1 SOUND THAT APPARENTLY ONLY WORKS THROUGH THE GD OPTICAL CABLE!!! You could say I'm pissed off, but that would be putting it lightly. Ya only get one star from me Turtle Beach, one star for wasting my hard earned money and very valuable time. YOU SUCK!  I'm gonna contact them and see what they say about my experience so check back for an update.  Thanks for reading.
B0064J6OMO|3.0|I don't normally write reviews, but I felt I needed to for this movie.  I loved Ryan Reynolds and Jason Bateman, and thought the story had a lot of promise.  The crude humor and \\"F\\" word was just a little over the top and not necessary. If they had taken it down a couple notches it would have been even better.  If you are ready for over the top situations...it will be funny and you will be fine.  Just consider yourself warned.
0375826742|1.0|Everyone's been asking me to review the third book in this series, so here I go.<br /><br />The author still has basic storytelling problems. The main one I keep noticing is that he is trying to work description or exposition into the action more, but it still reads like he's stopping the \\"movie,\\" ZOOMING IN ON EVERYTHING, and then pushing PLAY again when he's done. We nearly always get an extremely detailed description of every weapon, every person, every room, and every setting the characters encounter, and the adjectives used aren't connected to actions or attitudes. Or if it's exposition, maybe we'll have someone cast a spell, and then the action pauses while we endure two paragraphs of narration about other caveats to the spell that could have been applied but aren't useful here, and what might happen if it fails, and all kinds of trivia about other magics that are like this one--none of which end up being important in the scene. He's still failing to filter these observations through the minds of his characters, which dooms the narrative voice because it takes us OUT of the moment every single time.<br /><br />He has also made some poor choices with apparently unintentionally sexist phrases and disturbing attitudes toward women, most notably by \\"telling\\" that Arya is brave and independent and capable but \\"showing\\" that she is not any of these things because she needs to be rescued AGAIN. There were so many other people Eragon could have had to rescue from imminent death, and yet again Paolini chose Arya as the damsel in distress. She holds her own and later saves him once too, but framing women like this suggests that the strong ones are the exception to the rule. And sometimes, Roran talks like a creep. It's really uncomfortable.<br /><br />Add to that the fact that Saphira's narration is really obnoxious and recoil in horror at some of the untidy retcons Paolini tried to force into the story, and you have a very good reason to believe this fellow has not learned from experience.<br /><br />Bad Narration:<br /><br />Stylistically, narration is pretty terrible in this book. The similes and metaphors are especially galling, and I noticed that a disturbing number of his comparisons involved geological themes. I mean everything was hard \\"as diamonds\\" or heavy \\"as lead\\" or bright \\"as gold.\\" No one can just be \\"distinguished\\"; she's \\"the most distinguished, like an emerald resting on a bed of brown autumn leaves.\\" Someone should tell Paolini we don't need everything compared to something else in order to understand it. Even a monster's blood, which happens to be blue-green, is described as \\"not unlike the verdigris that forms on aged copper.\\" Coming across \\"Her tears appeared like rivers of silvered glass\\" just made me groan. And how about \\"Red as a ruby dipped in blood, red as iron hot to forge, red as a burning ember of hate and anger. . . .\\" So . . . was it red? As red as HATE and stuff? Don't forget to dip red things in other red things so you can go off on how red they are! And let's not forget \\"A flock of starlings darted across the afternoon sky, like fish through the ocean.\\" 'Cause \\"a group of animals moved through their habitat, like another group of animals moving through their habitat\\" really helps us see it better? And the biggest problem with it is it's not just distracting and unnecessary; sometimes they place an alternate image in your mind and draw your attention AWAY from the object or situation he is describing.<br /><br />The unnecessary description is especially pronounced when it comes to describing weapons. Paolini devotes an inordinate amount of time to his descriptions of swords and other tools. One of the shorter descriptions was as follows: \\"[A] bizarre implement: a single-edged weapon, two and a half feet long, with a full tang, scale grips, a vestigial crossguard, and a broad, flat blade that widened and was scalloped near the end, a shape reminiscent of a dragon wing.\\" I found one sword description--for a sword the protagonist only used for a couple chapters--at a mind-blowing two hundred words, and don't even get me started on the chapter where Eragon actually makes a sword that matters. Twelve pages of excruciating detail explain how exactly he made the sword, and it reads like an instruction manual. (Because Paolini freely admits he was fascinated with a certain Japanese swordmaking book at the time. Gee, you can't tell.) It's like if you just wanted to watch a crime thriller and twenty minutes of the footage involved an autopsy detailing exactly how the victim died. Some of the descriptions actually truly do not make sense, such as the description of Arya's voice as \\"Her low, rich voice contained hints of rustling pine needles and gurgling brooks and music played on reed pipes.\\" Can you imagine that? Someone's VOICE having all those things in it? Considering the gurgling, I think Arya may need a doctor.<br /><br />And let's not forget our old friend the unnecessary speech tags.<br /><br />\\"But how could you prove that?\\" objected Eragon.<br /><br />::sigh::<br /><br />I shouldn't have to say it again, but if the WORDS THEMSELVES are an apology, an agreement, or an objection, you DO NOT NEED TO IDENTIFY THEM AS SUCH with your speech tags? ARE YOU ALLERGIC TO THE WORD \\"SAID,\\" MY DEAR BOY?<br /><br />(\\"Yes, yes he is,\\" said the exasperated author of this review.)<br /><br />And my favorite, of course, was when I encountered a single sentence that was 307 words long. Also known as \\"this is where the editor fell asleep.\\" The narration described all the dwarves who were sitting around a table, and the sentence contained 9 semicolons, 28 commas, and 26 descriptive adjectives. When the final dwarf was described as \\"she of the nut-brown skin marred only by a thin, crescent-shaped scar high upon her left cheekbone, she of the satin-bright hair bound underneath a silver helm wrought in the shape of a snarling wolf's head, she of the vermilion dress and the necklace of flashing emeralds set in squares of gold carved with lines of arcane runes\\" . . . I started wondering if Paolini was just trolling his readers.<br /><br />Bad Dialogue:<br /><br />Two big problems. One: everyone--no matter their education--talks as though they are royalty, and it is uncomfortably unnatural. Roran, the illiterate farm boy, says \\"You dote upon her words as if each one were a diamond, and your gaze lingers upon her as if you were starving and she a grand feast arrayed an inch beyond your reach.\\" You'd never guess his job is beating people to death with a hammer. Two: Other people's reaction is to praise their verbal abilities. This happens like six different times in the book, and I am convinced it is an attempted Jedi mind trick on Paolini's part. A character says something awkwardly phrased, long-winded, and overly ornate, and another character tells him how poetic he is or expresses amazement and surprise at his eloquence. Is he just trying to convince us that's so? (The \\"cursing,\\" which happens a couple times when characters who are very angry spew out a stream of obscenities, is especially inappropriate. They all sound like they've been taking insult lessons from the French Taunter.)<br /><br />And I probably don't have to say why a fantasy novel that actually contains the phrase \\"Die, puny human!\\" should be punished and reminded to go on the paper.<br /><br />Predictable Plot Elements:<br /><br />This book is riddled with \\"revelations\\" that are written as if they will be a surprise to the reader, but I feel almost insulted when the narration suggests I didn't know. Take for instance monsters that are left for dead and actually aren't--wow, never saw that coming! Or a girl being revealed as being pregnant after her \\"secret\\" was already referred to multiple times, including her acting weird whenever having children is mentioned. How about when a character mysteriously referring to his \\"hearts\\" instead of his \\"heart\\" turns out to--oh my gosh--actually be foreshadowing? Yeah. It's really insulting.<br /><br />Nonsensical, Contrived, or Contradictory Plot Elements:<br /><br />The most obvious and most drastically awful problem with this book is that the magic system continues to be incoherent and continues to get worse. People cast spells that go against the rules of spellcasting, or in a couple cases contradict everything Paolini has said.<br /><br />Eragon denies Roran's request to be made more powerful through magic because he would \\"lose whatever strength or speed\\" that Roran would gain from it. When he accidentally made a character grow up too fast through magic, he didn't literally lose years himself. When he heals people he doesn't lose his own health. Admit it, Eragon. You just want an excuse to be the most powerful in the story. It seems like Paolini's magic system only makes sense in weird little pockets of logic that wouldn't actually add up to a comprehensive set of physical laws. And you know why he does this? Because he constructs his physical laws around what he wants to happen instead of having things happen that reflect the physical laws.<br /><br />There is also a consistent, disturbing trend for Eragon and Saphira to threaten people, barely suppress their own violent intent, and behave like tyrants. Saphira snorts fire at someone who said she couldn't have mead (after which he changes his mind right quick, and it's written as funny), and she attacks a tree spirit when it doesn't answer her fast enough. Even worse, Eragon tortures a blind man and banishes him (then gets emo about what HE went through having to do that), ignores a man's mortally ill wife to go drinking with his buddies until he's reminded again to heal her, and seriously considers taking the dwarf council hostage if they don't vote how he wants them to. It's horrible, and yet the narration treats Eragon as though he is a gleaming hero.<br /><br />Several retcons adjust the story in ways that need pages and pages of justification, and while some messily plug holes and rewrite history, others simply give up and say \\"no one knows why so and so did that,\\" acknowledging that it makes no sense but suggesting that it doesn't have to because mysterious characters are mysterious.  Same as Galbatorix is a villain because his motivation is being crazy.  (Also known as \\"we need someone to fight, but making the villain's reasoning actually make sense would have introduced authentic moral ambiguity into this story and that's just too much of a gray area.\\")  It's laughable.<br /><br />And as a good thing about the book, I chuckled when Eragon asked if there was anything he could do to appease the dwarf clan that hates him and Orik replied, \\"You could die.\\" Yes, you could, Eragon. Why don't you get on that?<br /><br />I must say this was a terribly difficult book for me to read and I honestly do not think Christopher Paolini is improving as a writer. There were perhaps three places in the book that I was interested in what was going to happen, and there were MANY places where I honestly would have just put the book down and not thought of it again if I weren't trying to review it critically. It's frustrating, because Paolini has determination and imagination, but his debilitating flaws are his inability to write character and his absolutely tone-deaf prose (especially since he decorates it after the fact with gaudy adjectives resembling fake versions of the gemstones he's always shoving into his similes). If he would learn to write people as if they were something other than plot devices and learn to stop writing narration as if he is an overenthusiastic performer, he might improve. Until he does so--until he realizes he ought to--he will continue to be a lucky kid who grew up to be a below average writer . . . an artist whose art is only admired by those who don't know better.just trolling his readers.

1594744769|5.0|I loved this book. I was hooked from page one. I couldn't put it down once I started reading it. Loved the old photos that went with the story. I would highly recommended this book for anyone who loves to explore old houses or loves old photos.
B005L38QK2|5.0|I got this for my fiance for Christmas but gave it to him early because his old mouse was getting ready to die. He loves this thing! He plays a lot of FPS's (Battlefield 3 mostly) and can definitely see a huge improvement over his past mice, it's a little too light for my tast but he seems to prefer it.
B002ZG981E|5.0|This has been another instant classic from Christopher Nolan, the director who has brought us such great films as the rebooted Batman trilogy, The Prestige, and Memento. The two-disc edition of the Blu-ray has played flawlessly on my Blu-ray player as well as the DVD version on my MacBook while I was traveling. Many people think that this film is too much of a \\"thinker\\" but it's really not all that convoluted or hard to follow (unlike the previously mentioned Memento). The acting is great, as well as the storytelling of Nolan. This film is definitely in the top ten of my favorites films of all time, and I'm sure that if you are a fan of his previous works, Inception is for you.

B00002N9ER|5.0|These brackets hold my flashlight in place in my Jeep next to the drivers seat.  Even on rough trails the light has never come loose.  In addition to my Maglite, they hold my large survival knife and seat belt cutter (the loops for a belt go over the clamps before the flashlight goes in) and I've had no issues for over a year.  I bought a second set to mount another 3D Maglite in my camper.  I have the flashlight mounted upright so if I need light in the middle of the night, but don't want to use the 12 volt, I just push the button and light the whole trailer, flashlight in place.  The price had about doubled by the time I bought the second set, but at less than $5.00 they are a bargain.

B000HEWEJO|5.0|One of our family's favorite Christmas traditions is watching Frank Capra's \\"It's A Wonderful Life\\" and eating rocky road candy.<br /><br />Just about everyone knows the story of George Bailey.  George is an ambitious young man who, due to extenuating circumstances, finds himself shackled to his deceased father's struggling Savings and Loan business.  George does good and honorable work, but he never realizes his personal dreams and vision of success.  Then when tragedy strikes on Christmas Eve he faces the biggest personal challenge of his life.<br /><br />This film, though a well-known holiday favorite today, was not a hit when it was released.  So, how did this film gain top-holiday movie status?  Do you remember a few decades ago when many of the cable TV stations were just getting off of the ground...TNT, USA, etc.?  If you recall, \\"It's A Wonderful Life\\" aired several times each holiday season for a number of years on a several different channels.  This happened because this film at that time had passed into the public domain.  So, these new cable TV stations could show it without having to pay any royalties!  It was free to them.<br /><br />When you combine that repeated pattern of showings until the copyright was renewed, with Frank Capra and a heartwarming Christmas story, people came to know and love this movie.<br /><br />I mean, what's not to love?  You have James Steward, Donna Reed, and Lionel Barrymore headlining the show.  I have heard it said that casting Lionel Barrymore as the cantankerous miser, Mr. Potter, was pure genius.  If you look at his other roles he typically played warm, grandfatherly characters, but not in \\"It's a Wonderful Life\\"!.<br /><br />The acting is great, and though the story line and characters have a strong Norman Rockewellian flavor, this film is well worth watching every Christmas season.<br /><br />5 stars for a fantastic Christmas classic!

B003E6K1VK|4.0|I didn't get to listen to this much, but when I did, it REALLY made a difference in the sound quality. Everything was much cleaner.  I use this at work, with sound coming out of my laptop, with a pair of Denon AH-D2000's.  The first day I started using it, every few minutes I would start hearing some static and it would get worse until I wiggled the DAC.  About 2 days later, only the left channel would play with all but 1 USB cable that I tried.  This was in both headphone outs.  When trouble shooting, I tried to use the line-in instead of the DAC, and the line-in would only work if I pushed the mini-jack in with a decent amount of force and held it in.  This was with the cable that came with the unit.  So, the DAC would only work with one channel, and the line-in would only work if you forcefully pushed the mini-jack in.  2 separate problems.  The other reviews have been pretty much positive, so  hopefully I just got a lemon unit.  I will be sending it in for a replacement, as otherwise this seems like a really nice item.  I will update if the 2nd one I get works.  UPDATE:  My 2nd try seems to work ok.  Haven't had any issues after 2 weeks, and the sound quality is superb.  Bumping up one star.

B004A8ZWSS|4.0|The Tourist starts out with Angelina Jolie ordering a croissant in a Parisian cafe with stylish flair, and as it turns out, this scene sets the tone for the rest of the film.  Sophisticated in its beauty, lush with Venetian motif, and with such charming actors, to watch The Tourist is to become enchanted with the imagery and the romantic idea of Venice, more than with Venice itself.  The Tourist is to Venice what Roman Holiday is to Rome.<br /><br />The movie's soundtrack is effective if not memorable, with a few nice surprises, including an appropriately subtle taste of Katie Melua in one scene which made me fall in love with her vocals all over again.<br /><br />Apart from the imagery is a casually-paced plot with enough humor and suspense to sustain interest throughout the movie, but is it enough to make this a classic?  Will this stand the test of time?  Probably not.  Other than the sheer beauty, there is little here of lasting value.  All the more reason to appreciate the fun while it lasts.
B003Y5H4Y8|3.0|\\"The Debt\\" is a descent film, not by any means, a great one. It is a remake of an Israeli film of the same title. The original (currently being shown on the  Sundance Channel's On Demand Service) is far, far better. The understated acting in the original film  (by Israel's great actress Gila Almagor, in particular) is brilliant. Not to take anything away from Helen Mirren, but this remake is just a very ordinary film.
B0002F6BRE|5.0|Believe it or not, I've never been a Will Ferrell fan.Too \\"over the top\\" for me, I guess.So it makes sense that I had never watched \\"Elf\\" before.However, it was on TV last night so I decided to watch it,and - SURPRISE!!! - I was enchanted!!I fully expected to be changing the channel within the first 15 minutes, but I watched it all the way through and loved it.I couldn't wait to order it and add it to my list of \\"have to watch movies\\" for Christmas.I'm not going to say that I love Will Ferrell but I DO love \\"ELF\\"!
B001UV4XJ2|5.0|I'm not even going to bother reviewing the movie (if you are buying this edition, you probably already know about it)  but I will review the product. This DVD came in its original packaging, unopened and in excellent condition. The delivery was quick and painless. I was a bit surprised that it came via USPS, but it arrived unscathed so I guess its just whatever works. Something to note: The UltraViolet copy is *NOT* a downloadable copy it is a *STREAMING* copy so an internet connection is absolutely necessary to watch the ultraviolet copy. I personally find that between the Blu-Ray and the DVD, I have no need of the ultraviolet copy, but if you are purchasing this for a digital copy, you may want to look into the workarounds for that. (I think I saw somewhere that if you call Apple, they will give you a download through Itunes, but you would have to look into that.) All in all, satisfied with the order.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Works great on my Coby MID8024. Tried others but like this one best! Game loads fast and plays fast. Good options to make it look and play the way you want.
B002L9N4DS|5.0|Forrest Gump (Blu-Ray), I love this Film and it moves me everytime I see it, no wonder it won 6 Academy Awards, it looks Awesome in Blu-Ray and the sound is so spectacular coming from my Sony Speakers. 141 minutes filled with most memorable events of the second half of the 20th Century.  The Blu-Ray box also comes with a second DVD filled with special features over two hours of everything you wanted to know about Forrest Gump the Film. I specially enjoyed \\"Seeing is believing, The visual effects of Forrest Gump\\", also Screen Tests, An evening with Forrest Gump, Little Forrest, and so much more.<br /><br />One of my favorite sequences Forrest Gump standing next to Governor Wallace at the University of Alabama attempting to block integration, Gump with his natural naive and innocence persona as he tries to exchange few words with President Kennedy, and so many more memorable moments. This Epic comedy-drama romance Film based on the 1986 novel of the same name by Winston Groom, wonderful writing, Tom Hanks as Forrest Gump, Haley Joel Osment (Forrest Gump Jr.) Gary Sinise (Lt. Dan) , Sally Field (Mamma), Robin Wright (Jenny), Mykelti Williamson (Bubba) with Awesome beautiful Music that touches you deep down in your Soul by Alan Silvestri and Great Directing by Robert Zemeckis,...I love this Film and never get tired of watching it! ...Thank You D.D.

B005V2EVBQ|4.0|I was a little uncertain about the quality of this case based on many of the reviews for it, but based on my own personal experience, this case has proven to be really effective. Looks wise, it's got a very sleek design to it and I actually think it enhances the appearance of the kindle fire. My only gripe is that for the white version (which I own), it doesn't seem to take much for it to start looking dirty or worn. But really, what more could you expect from a product with a white matte coated plastic finish?   It's light, snaps on easily and doesn't add a great deal of weight to the kindle fire. The strap seems to be sturdy enough to take frequent use over a long period of time and I like the addition of the felt material inside the front flap. It's done a good job in preventing scratches on my screen so far. The horizontal stand function was something I had been wary of before purchasing this, but it actually does a good job at staying up. I like to draw on a desk in my room and I sometimes like to use the stand when I need it for browsing at the same time. It's only collapsed once, and I think it's because I hadn't positioned it correctly. Other than that, its been able to take the frequent movement of the desk when I'm at work. I would still like to see Marware come up with a more secure way of keeping the stand up, though.   Overall I'd recommend this case. It won't offer the same protection as say, an Otterbox Defender case, but it's a good alternative.
B003Y5H5FG|1.0|I love Collin, Collete and Anton. They are always a joy to watch. But not here. This is not even close to the spirit of the original Fright Night nor does it bring anything new thats awe inspiring that would make it at least a serious attempt to scare us in whole new different ways. While the original had a buildup, kid noticing weird new tenant and helper moving coffin into basement, Charly spying new tenant with hooker in the buff, tenant opens mouth exposing fangs,suddenly his eyes roll upward to Charlies window and his very long fingernail pull the shades down,all these with a real creepy eerie soundtrack playing,just one of the real creepy haunting moments.  Something funny is going on here. He spies, calls the cops and no one beleives him, not even his friends take him seriously. This took about almost 30 minutes to accomplish. In this remake we hear about a vampire being in town in the first 5 minutes. 15 minutes later Evil Ed, Charleys scoffing outcast friend who barely has role of any substance here is turned, while in the original he tried with Charleys girlfriend and Peter Vincent to prove that Charley basically is in need of help  Collin Farrell seemed like he was told it would be a comedy, the boozy happy go lucky next door neigbor. The original Dandridge was a subdued threat covered by a gentlemanly charm, charming while Collins is a smug beer swilling shmuck if you really wanna know what acts like. Wow, thats real inventive, the vampire who not being invited in hangs at the door borrowing beer.  Most of the time its Farrel acting more like a homicidal maniac then a vampire. Blow up the house to get in. Blow up the house you blow up Charly so what do you care if you can enter or not. The car chase scene with an appearance by the original real vampire Chris Sarandon was lame. Borrowed from 1978s the Body Snatchers where Kevin McCarthny spoofs his role in 1956 movie running down the street being chased by the Pod People still yelling your next. Now thatwas a great moment. Sarandons appearance was just a paycheck.  And Peter Vincent? HAHAHAHAHA. Midori swilling Magician who is about as helpful as salt on a wound, his screen time thankfully was limited as well. Well its not his fault that it was the late great Roddy McDowell who played Peter Vincent, a role that would have been perfect for Peter Cushing as well I thought, though at this time Cushing was ill it would have been great to see Hammers Vampire killer doing it American style, but I digress. This was also a fine build up as Charley first approaches a now dated pink slipped Vampire Killer who does a marvelous job trying to get away and into his car from Charley whom he starts to fear as being a lunatic.  Amanda Bearse role though it wasnt a neccesity, they could have used the time with the chick Charlie loved and developed another angle to the story and be creative. And then their is the climax of this movie that was just short of retarded, Dandridge living in an unfinished house without any stucco yet on the wallboarding and keeping his victims in the walls in layers of earth. And the face change?  Give the originals hellishly great makeup job they did on Sarandon.  But I see either all the vulgar and tasteless fan kids and studio stooges have written in to up this trashes Amazon score. Dont worry, the 1 star crowd is just now starting to be heard.

B005FVFWOI|3.0|[[VIDEOID:mo2UHIMOVG9RF0F]]I'm a bit surprised by the \\"revelatory\\" listening experiences some are having with this new remix. To me, while good, the tonality is a bit of a letdown. The top end is quite bright and while the bass stands out better than the original mix, I think it has been left a bit too loud. There is a level of \\"clarity\\" that is quite impressive, but if you have been listening to the \\"25th Anniversary\\" CD as a basis for comparison, I think you're really missing out on hearing the original mix as it was. And I'm betting some folks who are slobbering over this release were probably listening to the 25th, which was heavily no-noised to the point of having almost no life in a misguided effort to remove tape hiss. That CD has quite often placed near the top of \\"Worst Remaster\\" lists on the internet, and using it as a way of judging the original mix is perhaps not a wise decision.  I never thought this was one of Tull's better \\"productions,\\" but I'm not sure the remix doesn't overcompensate in an effort to reveal more \\"details.\\"  The dynamics are good on this remix and certainly compression is very minor and not really much of an issue, but some tracks are lacking a bit of punch compared to the original mix because everything seems kind of pushed up front. DR Meter does seem to bear this out, as some of the tracks have about 3db less dynamic range than the original UK CD. While many have adored this remix, one complaint I have heard and certainly agree with regards its lack of midrange. Whether that is how the tonality developed as the multis were reorganized and levels reassessed or is more about Wilson's and/or Mew's decisions, I obviously don't know, but this really does have a pretty heavy bass/heavy treble sound. The mids are kind of recessed. Perhaps the original mix was a bit too heavy on the mids, but it's hard to say for certain given the wildly different sounding CDs and LPs out there, most of which have surely been \\"tweaked\\" as well.   I preferthe original UK CD (CDP32 1044-2) or the DCC for the original mix. This is impressive work and clearly the result of devoted individuals, but I feel that in direct comparison with a decent version of the original mix, there is something lacking in this new version. I do think it works better on some tracks than others, and I recommend this release to any Tull fan, but I think that overall it will get far less playing time from me compared to the versions I mentioned. The bonus tracks are great, the liner notes and pictures are excellent. A very solid job and reasonably priced; just don't underestimate the original mix if you haven't heard a decent version of it. I suppose something between the original and this would have worked best for me. The original is a bit murky and restrained, whereas this seems to lose the intimacy of the original mix and moves things up front a bit too much for my taste.  I made a little demo which I have attached. It used the DCC as a comparison, but I think the original UK CD I cited is nearly as good and that is easily attainable for 10 bucks or less with a little searching. This video is also searchable on YT (Tull Aqualung Remix). As you'll hear, in a direct comparison with a decent sounding version of the original mix, the new mix does seem to have quite impressive clarity and separation, but seems to lack the balance of the original.

1451648537|5.0|Bill Gates is generous of his money; Steve Jobs is generous of his knowledge and experience. He and his wife let the author go deeper into their private life including family, relatives, former girlfriends, those who don't like him and those who love him, cancer treatment, parenting...  The couple earned all my respect for being so grounded. From all the perspectives, I learned how Jobs make those great achievement in his life. Jobs and Gates are different. Both are great in our American modern history. There are more and deeper about Jobs and people around him that this book did not cover. I would still think this is an over 5 star book.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|I thought I made a mistake of buying a cover for my Kindle Fire because of some of the reviews I've read, but when my order arrived and saw how perfectly it fits my Kindle Fire,I knew it was worth the price! I got the pink one and everywhere I go, people are asking me where I bought my cover because it doesn't look bulky at all and you can see how well it protects the kindle...this is very important because I bring it everyday.  Overall, I love this product and do not see any flaws in it!
B005DF2QMC|5.0|This tape to digital converter actually works. I was able to transfer audio cassettes of family memories to my computer and then to a CD. It takes some exploring since the instructions do not provide enormous help, but a transfer to MP3 and then to CD works. The unit itself is flimsy plastic, so handle with care and the translation of a few words by someone in China is amusing. Good buy for the price.
0307477479|1.0|I do not see how this book could have won the Pulitzer Prize. This book is nothing special. In fact, it is a lot less than special. I kept hoping that something would happen, to make me care about the characters, and the story.  With one hundred pages to go, I could not put it down, because I figured it must have a great ending, to make up for the so-so pace up to then.  I figured that if it had a Pulitzer, and was a best seller, the end must be a redemption for the rest.  But, no such luck.  Also a strange thing happens. There are 70 plus pages towards the end, of nothing but some kind of unassociated graphs, and charts, with drawings and arrows with sentences. I do not know what these charts had to do with the story. In fact, it was weird.  At first, I thought that someone had made a mistake at the publishing house, and put part of another book, in this one.  Someone must know what they mean. I assume the author had some purpose in putting them there. But, I didn't know what was meant by them, and in fact, I ultimately did not care. Sometimes, you finish a book, and the story lingers satisfactorily in your mind for days afterwards. This book isn't one of them.
0857685627|5.0|So I didn't actually purchase this book. I won it from a YouTube contest and the book is signed by Frank O'Connor (Former Content Manager at Bungie who joined Microsoft and became the Creative Director for 343 Industries). I have played every Halo game to date, including Halo 1-3, Reach, ODST, and Wars. I'm a huge fan of the series and can't wait for Halo 4 and the Reclaimer trilogy. Hopefully even a Halo movie. This book is 192 pages.<br /><br />This is my first art book so here is my perspective. Playing every game in the Halo series, I really didn't know or understand how concept art and sketches start and what processes the creative teams use to make them come to life. I have a new perspective on what goes into making characters, weapons, vehicles, planets, aliens, etc. basically everything that is in a game.<br /><br />This book shows everything from the Halo series. When I say everything, I mean original sketches all the way to their evolved and final forms. Art from every game up to Halo Reach. Master Chief, Cortana, The Flood, The Covenant forces including grunts, brutes, elites, hunters and jackals, vehicles including the Warthog, Tank, and Covenant vehicles, all weapons and armor, ships including the Pillar of Autumn, and all world settings including Reach, Ring World, Earth, etc.<br /><br />While I am sure there are more extensive art books for Halo (including the Halo encyclopedia), this book is very detailed and the images are truly vivid. If you are a fan of Halo or into the conceptual art in video games, this book is for you.

B004WCTLNY|4.0|I'm not a fan of movies with so much as a hint of religious evangelism in them, but this fantasy thriller goes easy on the faith elements and heavy on the romantic elements so I was okay with it. It's a big budget Hollywood production, and the set values, mostly in New York City, are all real and high quality. There are special effects at work, but very subtle. This is actually a decent movie for thinking adults who can forget their cynicism for a moment and believe in fate, as they call it here. Matt Damon does very well for himself in a role that calls on his acting muscles more than his physical ones, for a change. I did have to laugh at the use of what appears to be an iconic insurance company building in Manhattan as the home of The Man who controls our destinies.
B005ZHB84U|5.0|Notes: I have the score as mp3 files and I have not yet seen the movie.<br /><br />After the enormously successful Sherlock Holmes (both the film and soundtrack), could director Guy Ritchie and composer Hans Zimmer dazzle yet again? As to the score, yes, Mr. Zimmer does excel yet again. I cannot say anything about the movie because I've not yet seen it, but the music is electrifying, especially track 10 To The Opera! which contains music by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart from the climactic scene of Don Giovanni (an opera which I haven't yet had the opportunity to see, but I must say that Mozart is my favourite composer), so I'm sure I will enjoy the movie thoroughly. Of course, the timy track That Is My Curse (Shadows-Part 1) which leads directly into the mammoth tracks Tick-Tock (Shadows-Part 2) and Chess (Shadows-Part 3) are also terrific, setting up the atmosphere of menace which I'm sure pervades the film, as this time, Holmes and Watson are hot on the trail of the villainous Professor James Moriarty (whose existence was hinted at in the first movie and who was an unseen but palpable prescence). Also, some Ennio Morricone is thrown in for good measure. The Mycroft Suite, It's So Overt It's Covert & Romanian Wind are whimsical and thus hint at comic relief in the film. And finally, The End? provides a welcome taste of Discombobulate (which was the theme in the first film). The bonus tracks are also quite worth it.<br /><br />\\"Two gentlemen find themselves at cross purposes. When two objects collide, there's always damage. Now, are you sure you want to play this game?\\" Absolutely. Let The Game Begin.
B006JPS1OM|4.0|It's simple but that doesn't mean it's too easy. its a good old 'find all of these objects in the picture' type game. On my Kindle Fire, the screen wasn't always responsive and I had to press objects a couple of times. Fun and interesting. I love it.

1843532727|4.0|We have about 20 Rough Guides in our collection and will always consider them first when exploring other countries.<br /><br />The Rough Guide to Japan served us very well on our 2 week holiday in this wonderful country. Like all Rough Guides, the author injected their own personal touch and the listings for restaurants and accommodation proved as helpful and accurate as ever.<br /><br />With the exception of one small fishing village that didn't live up to the cuteness the author raved on about, everything we did and visited as a result of the guide made our holiday one of the most memorable we have had. I would recommend the guide whole-heartedly to anyone planning a holiday there.
0439023513|4.0|First, let me start by saying that some of the reviews for this book are unfair. I think if you read the book a lot of the things people are complaining about are explained in the book. Like for instance, Katniss & Gale's relationship. Over the three book series, you start to see Katniss and Gale drift apart due to Gale increasing bitterness and anger at the Capital. Which ultimately has a hand in the killing of Prim. And Gale does not leave without saying goodbye. He comes to see Katniss in the hospital on execution day and he knows that she will never forgive him for his role in Prim's death. As for ending up with Peeta, only someone who has been through the Hunger Games can truly understand what each other is going through. Gale could not understand why Katniss would spare the life of her stylists or complain about their treatment at the hands of President Coin. I think if President Coin had not been killed Gale would have followed along with her reign of terror.<br /><br />One of the major drawbacks to the book is how slow Katniss is. She has clues and people telling her things throughout the series and she does not put all the pieces together until the end. You wonder if she had not been so dim how things we have ended up. In general it was a very good read. The second and third book however are not as great as the first book, but the series pull you in and you must finish to know what happens.
B005ZHB84U|5.0|I have long been a fan of Hans Zimmer's scores. Two years ago, before seeing the first film, I purchased the first soundtrack. Having grown up watching the Jeremy Brett BBC (Grenada) series, I was expecting a very serious score, and was at first taken aback by the curious mixture of comic and unusual in Zimmer's work. It took me about three times through the disc before I finally understood it, and it's now one of my all-time favorite scores.  So when I picked up the new score for \\"A Game of Shadows,\\" I was thoroughly expecting him to build on the themes from the first film, and couldn't wait to listen. The first four tracks are breathtaking, tension-building action music. Wonderful! I was expecting some comedic-sounding, unusual music, yet tracks 5-8 still managed to surprise me. At first I thought it sounded crazy, but again I found that after 2-3 listens-through, I understood it. Track 9, \\"The Mycroft Suite,\\" is an excellent track portraying the sound of Holmes' brother.  Track 10, \\"To The Opera!\\" is hair-raising. I have always appreciated the music of W. A. Mozart, and the use of his music from \\"Don Giovanni,\\" and blending it into Zimmer's fresh work for this film was amazing.  Track 11, \\"Two Mules for Sister Sara,\\" is a very good piece of music which comes from composer Ennio Morricone, and fits very nicely on this release.  \\"Die Forelle,\\" track 12, is a tremendously good re-working of the Schubert piece, tweaked through sound effects and then merged in with Zimmer's score. It is incredible. Tracks 13-17 return to the more typical Zimmer score, with some action sounds, some reflective, sad sounds, and then finally a re-launch of the Zimmer \\"Sherlock Holmes\\" theme. Incredible.  Finally, for those with a good internet connection, the CD purchase brings you to a hidden web site where you can view two videos of how they made some of the music, as well as download three bonus tracks. Very nice.  Now for the only down side: the final track, number 18, is another oneof those hideous \\"remixes\\" which have been showing up so much recently (and which took up nearly *half* of the latest \\"Pirates of the Caribbean\\" score, \\"On Stranger Tides\\"!). These need to be dumped from the CD releases and more of the good music from these movies need to be included, instead.  In short, if you liked the first \\"Sherlock Holmes\\" score, you'll like this one, too!

0618154043|5.0|Upon his death in 1973, J.R.R. Tolkien left behind a vast collection of writings about Middle-earth. His third son and literary executor, Christopher, assembled some of these into The Silmarillion, published in 1977, but the question about what to do with the other reams of material was unclear. Aware that fans of Middle-earth would be eager for more material, even unfinished or existing only in rough drafts, he assembled Unfinished Tales and published it in 1980. Its success inspired him to proceed with the far more ambitious, twelve-volume History of Middle-earth project.  Unfinished Tales occupies an awkward place in the Tolkien canon. Unlike the History series, which consists of almost exclusively non-canon material (early drafts and rough notes of material that was eventually finalised and published), the material in Unfinished Tales was specifically written by Tolkien to flesh out other parts of his mythos that were not explored in the books themselves. In particular, the writings include a series of essays which were designed to answer a wide number of issues brought up by readers of The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit in correspondence. Some of these essays were written very late in Tolkien's life and represent his last - and often only - word on subjects such as the origins of Gandalf and his fellow wizards, the backstory of Galadriel and the history of Numenor during the Second Age. As a result some fans hold Unfinished Tales to be the fourth Middle-earth book, only marginally less important than The Hobbit, The Lord of the Rings and The Silmarillion. Others choose to disregard it as anything more than a curiosity, since as Christopher Tolkien himself notes it's unlikely J.R.R. would have permitted even the completed writings in the book to be published without more polish.  Unlike The Silmarillion, which was presented as a single narrative, Unfinished Tales is a collection of stories and fragments intermingled with Christopher Tolkien's editorial notes.These are kept to a minimum in some of the stories and essays, but in others are much more prevalent (something he apologises for, but regards as necessary in the case of works where his father was working on several drafts simultaneously, risking confusion to the reader). Christopher's notes are fascinating, well-written with a clear eye for detail and minimising confusion. He assumes the reader is already familiar with the Middle-earth mythos (since they're unlikely to be reading this book otherwise) and is able to delve into various topics in depth. Whilst he clearly loves and respects his father immensely, it is also amusing to detect the vague frustrations that creep into his notes, most notably when trying to fathom why Tolkien abandoned particular narratives at key points (feelings the reader may share as the book unfolds).  The first story is 'Of Tuor and His Coming to Gondolin'. The story of Tuor's arrival in Gondolin and the events leading to the fall of that city in the War of the Jewels was the first story Tolkien ever wrote set in Middle-earth, and is still one of his most memorable narratives. However, the version in Unfinished Tales was written much later, in 1951 (the much more complete original can be found in The History series), featuring a more conventional prose style than the archaic original. It's stirring, epic stuff, featuring some great imagery as Tuor is confronted by the Vala Ulmo, Lord of Waters, and has a great destiny laid before him. The story proceeds with power and momentum until it abruptly halts just as Tuor reaches Gondolin itself. Even with the earlier version available and a much more compressed account of events readable in The Silmarillion, this is still a frustrating moment.  The second story is 'The Tale of the Children of Hurin', a much longer story (almost a hundred pages, taking up a quarter of the book) featuring the adventures of the doomed, tragic Turin. Unlike the story of Tuor, this tale is more or less complete, though somewhat complex due to competing drafts and different versions existing. Many years later Christopher used this material (along with some other, later unearthed manuscripts) to form the basis of The Children of Hurin, so if you already have that book be aware that you will find much of this material familiar. But still, it's a powerful story, the darkest thing Tolkien wrote set in Middle-earth, featuring lust, incest (though unwitting), war and the 'hero' bringing death and ruin to all those around him.  The next section of the book moves into the Second Age of Middle-earth, which Tolkien left somewhat vague and under-developed compared to the First Age (covered in The Silmarillion) and the Third (the setting for The Hobbit and Lord of the Rings). We start off with 'A Description of the Island of Numenor'. For fans of worldbuilding, Tolkien's description of the island empire and the accompanying map will be fascinating. However, it's the following story, 'Aldarion and Erendis', which is more intriguing. It depicts the marriage of the noble lady Erendis to Aldarion, later King of Numenor, and touches on larger aspects (such as Aldarion's re-opening of relations between Numenor and the elves of Middle-earth), but for the most part it's a strong character piece. For those who claim Tolkien is overly-romantic, this account of a failing relationship due to outside pressures (Aldarion's lengthy absences from home) is surprisingly realistic. The story breaks off towards the end, although this is more of a relationship study than a tense narrative, so is less grievous a loss than some of the other texts in the book.  Tolkien follows this up with an account of the Kings of Numenor and the major events of their reigns. This is again primarily of interest to worldbuilders, but Tolkien manages to put in some great details and elements that could have been mined to produce further stories, but sadly it was not to be. This is then succeeded by an account of the history of Galadriel and Celeborn, something that Lord of the Rings fans will be more interested in, but frustratingly is also the most 'unfinished' of all the works in the book. Tolkien conceived of several competing, but radically different possibilities for the couple's backstory and reached no firm conclusions before his death, leaving several versions which are mutually contradictory. Christopher Tolkien suggests appreciating these contradictions as part of the literary effect of having a fictional history and mythology, which may be the best approach. Even in their differences, these versions reveal more fascinating information on Sauron's activities in the Second Age and characters briefly mentioned in Lord of the Rings, such as Celebrimbor, Nimrodel and Amroth.  The final sections of the book deals with the Third Age and consists mainly of finished essays and narratives, though in some cases with competing drafts which the editor takes pains to clarify. This section begins with an account of the Battle of the Gladden Fields (the engagement where Isildur lost the Ring), here revealed to be a much larger conflict than the brief skirmish suggested by Lord of the Rings and depicted as such in the films (by necessity, since Peter Jackson did not have the film rights to Unfinished Tales he could not use the account of the conflict here). He follows this up with the history of the Rohirrim, the development of the relationship between the Rohirrim and people of Gondor, and the founding of Rohan itself, again depicting worldbuilding information through a story (here the friendship of King Cirion of Gondor and Eorl, founder of Rohan).  This is followed by sections fleshing out The Lord of the Rings. 'The Quest of Erebor' explains how Gandalf came to join forces with Thorin and the dwarves and how he convinced them to recruit Bilbo Baggins to join their quest. This was actually a chapter from The Lord of the Rings, written as part of Tolkien's attempts to better-connect The Hobbitand the later work, but was wisely exorcised for killing the pace of the novel (it was supposed to be a discussion between Gandalf and Frodo between the victory over Sauron and the Scouring of the Shire, where it would have been ill-suited). However, as a stand-alone narrative it's a valuable - and enjoyable - asset in clarifying the relationship between the two books. This is followed up by 'The Hunt for the Ring', a detailed account of how the Ringwraiths set out in search of the Ring after losing track of Gollum (who had been captured by Aragorn). Though rather brief, this short piece does feature a memorable confrontation between Saruman and the Witch-King of Angmar. Rounding off this section is 'The Battles of the Fords of Isen', revealing in detail the battles fought by Rohan against Isengard on the Isen (alluded to but unseen in The Lord of the Rings). Again, it's not essential but does help flesh out a side-element of The Lord of the Rings.  Rounding off the book are three complete essays on three separate topics. The first expands on the Druedain or Woses, the wood-men who help the Rohirrim bypass Sauron's armies to reach the Pelennor Fields. Tolkien reveals in this essay that he was considering giving the Druedain a much bigger role in the backstory of Middle-earth, and even have them playing a role in The Silmarillion, but passed away before this idea could be fully fleshed-out. The second discusses the Istari, or the order of wizards that Gandalf, Radagast and Saruman belong to. We learn the names of the other two wizards who vanished into the east (Alatar and Pallando) and some interesting backstory emerges here. The third and final essay delves into the Palantiri, the magical seeing-stones which play a major role in The Lord of the Rings. This is atypical Tolkien, since normally he preferred to leave the magical elements of his world vague and mysterious, but here he delves into the capabilities of each palantir with the kind of magic system-buildingenthusiasm we now see with writers such as Brandon Sanderson.  Unfinished Tales (*****) is a fascinating book, representing a collection of writings by the most influential fantasist of all time extending over thirty years. Many of the individual stories and essays are excellent, certainly all are interesting and the only complaint that can be made is that several break off with no resolution. But then the book does tell you that on the cover, so it's hard to hold that against it. Unfinished Tales is available now, in numerous editions, in the UK and USA.
B0043URV5U|4.0|This is a good two disc set of the hits by Bob Segar.  He is one singer who can move me with a fast and a slow  song.  It contains classics like \\"Rock and Roll Never Forgets\\", \\"Against The Wind\\", \\"Night Moves\\",  \\"We've Got Tonight\\"  It also contains songs that I don't have on CD like the Christmas classic \\"Little Drummer Boy\\" and a relatively new song entitled \\"Wait For Me\\".  This collection also contains Segar's version of \\"Downtown Train\\", which I have never heard of before.  This song is pretty good.  I  I love other songs like \\"Shakedown\\" and \\"Katmandu\\".  These two songs really rock and pump me up.  I will give this collection four stars for the music that is included.  This collection is incomplete. It is missing some of his other best known hits like \\"Feel Like A Number\\" and the hit \\"Understanding\\".  I loved these songs growing up, and I still do. I wish these songs were on here. This is a good retrospective of Bob Segar's career though.
1451627289|5.0|I am a huge King fan and have read anything he ever wrote. No matter the story, he can bring characters to life like no other writer, and have you invested in a story and caring about the characters within the first few chapters.  That being said, this is the best book that SK has written in a long time.  I could not put it down.  I know that some people have written off Stephen King as a horror writer and can not get past the fantasy type stuff and the blood and gore that he seems to work into every book, but this book has a lot less of that than most of his writing and I think would appeal to any type of reader, even the ones who think they do not like Stephen King books.  It has so much of the personal connections and detailed characterization that I really think make SK stand out as one of the best writers of our time.  I just hope that this is a sign of more to come, and he can continue to produce books of this caliber until he is old and grey!

B003YL4LYI|2.0|If the author really wrote this book by splitting out half of the characters from the earlier book, wonder why it took him so long to publish this one!<br /><br />There are more cliffhangers in this book than in the entire season lineup of a TV channels suspense thrillers.  Problem is that you will probably have to wait for another 5 years to find out what happened.  Even cliffhangers from the previous book are not resolved.<br /><br />I wish I did not have to ready this book, but I just had to considering the amount of time that I had invested in the previous 4.<br /><br />And the fact does remain, that I really wanted to know what happens to the characters that the author has done such a good job creating.  It's just sad that one doesn't actually get to find out what happened, since he just keeps adding new twists and story lines without ever bothering to resolve the existing ones.<br /><br />God knows I will have to read the sixth one when it comes out too, clearly Mr Martin has got down to a fine art the way to milk his customers.

B006O5YHUY|4.0|*SPOILER ALERT*<br />I really l iked this movie and thought it was good. It was interesting. had the physical and emotional aspect of life, along with family ties. Basically what I got was it's about a family who's father was a drunk and abusive. The mom and youngest son tommy left them, and brendan the oldest son stayed behind. The father gets sober a little less than 3 years and tommy comes back from the marines only to say mom died....and then he wants his dad to train him to fight. Both of the sons through the whole movie most obviously hate the dad and have major resentment.<br />So the plot is all about this tournament winner takes all 5 million $. Brendan a physics teacher learns that he is in need of money due to his hosue being in danger of foreclosure, implicitly seen because of shady bank advice. So the retired ufc family man with 2 daughters thrust himself back into the mma world for some quick cash to save his house. meanwhile tommy is training with paddy the dad. I am only explaining all this because the movie built of tommy so much the ending threw me for a major negative loop although i like the ending I am sure it could have went a different route. So tommy always got the attention from paddy, the father, and was #1 state champ in wrestling for high school. A marine who even saved other marines in times of danger, gone awol because couldn't cope with the tragedy is trying to make some bucks so he can help his fallen comrade/ best friends family. So during training he knocks out the current middleweight mma champ tko in a sparring session, which lands him a ticket into spart, the 5 mil tourny. His first round he knocks the guy out with 1 punch. The second round was the mad dog , same guy as in the sparring session, but because mad dog was talking trash, he got knocked out in like 5 seconds with a ground and pound (face smash). That's all I remember up until his final fight with his brother. So the movie built him up as the mega ultimate fighter who defeats all opponents in like 5 seconds. It's known his dad is a war vet and a talented trainer.<br />so tommy's brother brendan is now a physics teacher out the game, out of shape and married with children. Soft as it is. He asks an old friend to train him to make money to safe his house. I think he gets around 5 weeks. During the training he shows major improvement and even bests the the fighter chosen to go to sparta.his old friend, the manager, now replaces the #1 guy due to injury with brendan as a request or all by chance/ luck. So in all brendans matches he is the underdog and gets beat up, smashed, pounded, mashed, thrown around, and pulverized, but he manages in all 3 matches to tap them out. Even the russian undefeated champ. So here's why i wrote all that. The family man who by luck rises to the final round is up agianst his ultimate warrior marine brother. and again no contest but brendan slips a move and dislocates his bro's shoulder and goes on to win. Now I love the ending because he gets to keep his house and will probably help tommy's best friend's family out but come on. This is no david and goliath here. I mean i would have believed it mroe if brendan was a Godly man who won because of the power of God because other than that it seems like luck. The movie built tommy up so much there simply was no room in the script for him to loose and I was disappointed. All this said I am still happy with the movie and the ending and think it's better than the fighter! Not sure if it will ahve a sequel but it was so good it could have one! Merry Christmas! Godbless.

1451627289|5.0|I give Stephen King huge kudos.  I haven't enjoyed a book like this in I don't know how long.  I have had to ration my reading so I don't finish it too quickly.  I love the concept of time travel and I love revisiting my childhood memories.  I was nine when President Kennedy was assasinated and remember that day vividly.  I can't normally read Stephen Kings work, because it creeps me out too much, but this has been a treat to read.
B004GCPJDQ|5.0|Is there anything more frustrating than when your mouse batteries die in the middle of a deadline?  With this device it will never happen again.<br /><br />I've seen both good and bad reviews on this device, but after seeing how well it worked for a coworker, and my own frustrations with dead batteries in my Magic Mouse, I took the plunge and I don't regret it.  Now I couldn't get along without it!  It works so well I bought a second one for home and a third in my laptop bag (no issues on any of them).  It does require that the USB has consistent power during charging (duh), but it's never failed to charge quickly and effectively.  Never once has the battery pack popped out as I've seen in other reviews.  It feels and acts exactly as it does right from Apple, but you never have to worry about changing the batteries.  This should be stock from Apple, as it never seemed like a \\"magic\\" mouse until now.

B005Q1W10A|3.0|Julian Fellowes has once again proven he is absolutely shameless when it comes to pinching plot lines or re-hashing the cliched storylines that have gone before.<br />Yes, Downton Abbey is back with series two, ....oh, and don't worry, there's a definite lead-in to a third series at the end of this one. After all there must be at least two more cliches Fellowes hasn't rehashed just yet, but they'll pop up I'm sure.<br />Okay, so what's it like?<br />Well its still very lush in its set dressing , but the photography with its over use of steadycam zooming and circling about in very long takes will make those of you who suffer vertigo more than a little dizzy at times.<br />We are still largely confined to Downton Abbey, with very brief scenes in the \\"designer\\" trenches with some very obvious photoshopping to provide the shattered landscape that is supposedly The Somme.<br />There's a little blood, but one never really gets the feeling that it's anything but a set piece.<br /><br />The acting is once again good, with the VERY noticeable exception of Elizabeth McGovern, who gives the most bizarre performance as the wife. Now she's an American actress playing an American, which shouldn't be all that hard a stretch you would imagine, ....BUT her \\"style\\", (if I may call it that), seems to consist of constantly cocking her head at an odd angle, gazing intensely just off to the side of camera and going cross-eyed!<br />I kid you not! AND she does it all the time, in just about every situation other than when she is supposed to be dying of the Spanish 'flu.<br />(Aside: Spanish 'flu was VERY contagious and yet despite all the cast being shown in very close contact with the designated victims, no one else ever seems to catch it!)<br /><br />I can only suggest McGovern normally wears glasses in life, but has removed them to play her character and now has to squint to read her lines off a cue card held just off camera? You will not miss this strange affectation I assure you, ......she looks like a myopic beagle at times.<br /><br />There are deaths of some characters, ...but they are the \\"disposable\\" ones, .....or those whose demise creates a very convenient advantage for the plot, .....AND you'll see all of them coming long before the last dying gasp. As I said above, the writing is FAR from being full of any surprises. It's strictly \\"paint-by-number\\" as far as plot goes.<br />There are also some noticeable gaps where a quite interesting sub-plot is begun, then just abandoned completely without any resolution or further mention. The re-appearance of an extremely facially disfigured \\"true\\" heir who supposedly perished on the Titanic at the beginning of series one is a point in question. Is he an impostor or the real deal? He just leaves and is written out and we never find out. Maybe it's left for the proposed third season?<br /><br />The \\"villain\\" Thomas once again turns up like the proverbial bad penny and lords it over everyone when he is appointed to army staff in charge of Downton Abbey's military hospital and is no longer a servant, ......yes, the Abbey becomes a hospital, but really more of a \\"designer rest home\\" so don't expect any severe war wounds or dying soldiers. Most of 'em look like they are smart young chaps at a house party, leaping about playing ping-pong rather than suffering any of the vicissitudes of war!<br />Our arrogant Thomas also makes a disastrous foray into the black market, but rather than suffer any disgrace, despite palming off adulterated foodstuffs to the Downton kitchens,  again manages to land on his feet and remain at the Abbey rather than be dismissed for his many crimes. They are obviously very sympathetic employers, considering there were no unfair dismissal laws in force at the time! There is a most convenient plotline for Thomas, which has most of the serving staff get sick and the Abbey become short-staffed. Well, down to it's last ten or so servants to look after five people anyway!

B003K1EYM6|5.0|Some reviewers have complained about iOS 4.2's inability use the camera kit's usb adapter to connect non-camera usb devices to the iPad.  With iOS 5, most usb devices are usable once again. I have a 1st generation iPad running iOS 5.1, and using the usb adapter I am able to connect usb keyboards, a CF card reader, and a Marshall USB microphone (which GarageBand discovers easily). Some high-powered devices like USB audio interfaces (I have a creative X-FI 5.1 usb surround card) still need a powered USB hub to work with iPad, but most of the devices that worked before 4.2 are functioning again in 5.1.
B003Y7AR4K|3.0|Technically brilliant, lushly presented, but artistically inferior to the 2001 Royal Ballet's setting of The Nutcracker ([[ASIN:B00005S6KS The Nutcracker/ Cojocaru, Dowell, Royal Ballet]]<br /><br />· Pacing and tempos seem brisk, bordering on rushed.<br />· Silly overuse of thrown handfuls of glitter.<br />· Overlong Act I makes Act II seem rushed and downsized.<br />· Use of elaborate scrims and falling curtains distracts from ballet.<br />· Casting short, grotesquely over-leg muscled Nutcracker and Cavalier leads does make for technically flawless solos and pas de deux -- but it also becomes hard to watch and dramatically uninteresting.<br />· Long depth of field and extreme detail in the HD videography and Blu-Ray format combine to make it visually hard to concentrate on the primary action.<br />· Nine years on, Miyako Yoshida may or may not feel that she owns the role of Sugar Plum Fairy; some seem to think so. But the protesting-too-much defense of her casting probably foreshadows Yoshida-san's dignified and hopefully upcoming standing down to let more youthful dancers have a go.<br />· Iohna Loots is not compelling or quite believable as Clara.<br />· Drosselmeier seems to have become a control freak in the Land of Sweets, personally directing almost all action and entertainments. Distracting and stalls the action.<br />· Choreographer clears to a blank stage at one point in the Snowflakes sequence. Maybe this is meant to heighten anticipation... but it becomes ridiculous and irritating as the music plays and plays with no action except falling-confetti snow. And when the Showflakes do appear, we get less ballet and more hand-twinkles and flutters.<br /><br />Been trying to find more positive points to mention, but that might take a while. I guess the upshot is that I bought this 2009 production to see what The Royal Ballet have done since 2001 with their setting. The flash and sensation seem greater, and the visual elements richer and no doubt morecostly.<br /><br />But the dance art and presentation seem to have suffered loss of focus and clarity in many small ways, perhaps by cumulative errors and choreographic tweaking introduced each time roles are handed off to new artists.<br /><br />The effort feels akin to an old Christmas toy, repainted and retouched yearly but with underlying accumulated dings and scratches and half the corners rounded off. Found myself slipping into ho-hum while watching.

0385344325|4.0|My favorite Reacher novels are ones where he is still in the military.  I think \\"The Enemy\\" is about my all time favorite, because I enjoy seeing Reacher working at his old cop job as opposed to being a drifter.  I agree with another reviewer that the \\"Reacher in Small Town\\" formula was getting a bit tired.  I'd love to see more of his prequels in the future.  Also love to read more about his relationship with Joe, and get more detail on Joe as a character.<br /><br />As for the specifics of this book, I wasn't able to figure out all the plot twists 50 pages in advance.  Some Reacher books are easier to crack, this one was tougher.  As usual, Reacher is crazy for murder and has no trouble executing anyone he believes is guilty of a serious crime.  In fact, I'm not so sure Reacher has ever actually arrested anyone.  He determines who is guilty, and goes and:  (i) breaks their neck; (ii) heart punches them; (iii) shoots them in the face/forehead; and/or (iv) beats them to death.  I'm sure cops love him.  He clears murders in bunches all without the necessity of a forensic investigation or a trial.<br /><br />FYI, if you are a big fan you might want to re-read The Enemy before reading this.  Next book in timeline is Killing Floor, with Reacher in Georgia.  The author drops subtle clues that shows he must have a cohesive timeline all worked up.<br /><br />Good read

My one wish would be for the song selection to be simpler for kids - bigger buttons, larger text and maybe a few more keys. I have this on my Xoom and the keys are pretty big. A good app.
B0034G4P94|5.0|I am stunned at how great this movie was.  I just watched a rented copy of it and promtply logged in to Amazon to buy it.  Rent it or buy it, just watch it!  Truly one of the best movies I have seen!
B004HEXSLI|5.0|Dr Jill Bolte takes us along with her on her personal journey while she's having the stroke and fascinates us with her insights during and after the incident. Great book!
0345360338|5.0|I read all the negative reviews about this book and I just can't understand them. I read all of Elizabeth Chadwick's books and I can tell a difference between both writers... Both are GREAT in their own way! Sharon Kay Penman's books are so full of history that they are hard to follow if you are not paying enough attention. She also provides you with very detailed explanations about some customs and traditions of Medieval England, France and Wales and THAT to me is what makes these books so valuable. That she \\"creates\\" dialogues and situations that we don't truly know if they existed, well, that's part of writing a historical fiction book, you have to do it, and otherwise you would end up with a bunch of historical facts written in any reference book.<br />Simon de Monfort was really ahead of his time and I think he was too cocky sometimes but he stood against the King of England even knowing he didn't have a chance... either he was too idealistic or too stupid, I don't know. I was so sorry about the way he and his sons died but it was something to be expected. I don't think Nell was a snob, she WAS a King's niece and later cousin! At that time she was almost equal to untouchable, she must have been very proud and very used to having people obey her without rebelling but Sharon Kay gives her a very human frame, that of a devoted wife and caring mom, two things very hard to find in a noble woman at that time...<br />So if you enjoy history go get this book. It's worth it! (and don't hesitate to buy the third one, is great too!).
B005OLF6BI|4.0|I liked Taylor Swift from the first time I heard her. And yes, she was never the best singer, but from hearing her first live performance on Ellen, she has improved enormously. I don't care if she is categorised as \\"bubble gum pop\\" - she IS a good writer/story teller - and from such a young age.  I won't analyse the hell out of this cd/dvd - if you're a Taylor Swift fan you'll LOVE it.  My only criticism is of the CD - I would like to hear the artist and the band - not thousands of screaming fans through every song. That just became annoying.... seeing/hearing that in a DVD is different - it brings the realism of a concert to your lounge room. At times though, the constant screaming is PAINFUL - as if they are competing with her and the band for audio volume!  A respectful \\"scream\\" after each song is fine... but they should have been told \\"we are recording this - please keep it down for fans who want to hear Taylor and her band\\".  Again, if you are a Swift fan, you'll love it.
0897502027|5.0|The publishers did an excellent job of repackaging the original version. The updated layout and increased size of Bruce Lee's sketches makes it much easier to read.  I did not care for the additional comments by Linda Lee Caldwell, Shannon Lee and others who were not very subtle in pushing their political agenda in the on-going Lee family verse the Inosanto Concepts group saga. Other than that minor speed bump in the road I really like the updated release of this classic book.   Here are my top three reasons to recommend the new edition:  1.  The layout of the material is improved and easier to read thanks to a new font type.   2.  The illustrations are much clearer and larger than the original version  3.  Newly added translations from some of the Chinese that was not translated well or at all in the original book adds to the value of this edition.
1907360212|3.0|Shame on me I did not read the dimensions of the book.  Book is small around 6 x 4 inches.  Makes it a little hard to read.
B0043KK4N6|5.0|I have been wanting this CD forever. I couldn't wait to play it and have  not stopped. I am wearing it out !! Thanks so much  =0)
B0050PYNO4|5.0|From the first scene, my husband and I were laughing. I rented this movie first, not sure if we were going to like it, but as soon I watched it, I knew I had to have it in the collection. If you like other movies with these actors, you will love this one.
0316098515|5.0|Was very impressed with the book. The pictures are amazing and the book is very easy to follow. The recipes are unique and easy to understand. I have been following Eleven Madison Park for a long time and I am very glad to see this book come out. It is great even though a lot of reviews talk about the difficulty of locating the ingredients for cooking. (Thank you Amazon, because I can find any ingredient on line.) If I am serious about cooking, I would plan on what I would like to make that weekend or later in the month, order the ingredients and then cook. I love it !!
6305428387|5.0|Cool Runnings is a great movie. Based on a true story, it is both funny and inspirational about a Jamaica bob-sled team that goes to the Olympics. You will enjoy this, as it not only shows a great team effort, but also shows something about life in Jamaica. I can testify that it really does this, as I have spent 24 years of regular trips to Jamaica.
0446585025|4.0|Although I have not read this book, the seller/shipper was very prompt in sending it and in great condition.  This is a gift for my mother who is a very big Ellen DeGeneres fan.
B000S0GYRU|5.0|Well known to hardcore horror fans, obscure to all the rest, here is Dario Argento's masterpiece. It's thick atmosphere of dread is only matched by it's beautiful cinematography. A true text book example of style over substance, yet enough substance to make this one of the best horror films ever made!<br /><br />Terrifying!
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|I love this app, I really love Angry Birds and I'm not going to lie, this one is my favorite Angry Birds app.
B000HIVIOW|5.0|I have wanted to recapture the enjoyment of this simple and delightful story ever since hiring it out for my own children some 15 years ago!  Now I have a two year old grandchild so what better excuse then to indulge my wish!  This is the charming entertainment all small children (and their grandmas) should quietly enjoy.  Lovely pastel animations and no spoken word enables exchange between child and adult.  The beautiful music and choir carry you off on the adventure with animations well matched to the musical movements.  A lovely watch or equally background sound track for introducing a child to classical music.
1419702238|5.0|I bought this book for my five grandchildren because they love the series of the Diary of the Wimpy Kid. They have read all the rest of the books in this series so I knew it would make a perfect Christmas gift to give them even with the variance in the range of ages.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Very enjoyable, I kill a lot of time on this. I like the options it gives, fun game. Check it out if you haven't.
B005KJZDXK|3.0|I am a fan of Zooey Deschanel and wanted so badly to absolutely love this album. However, as many other reviewers pointed out, it very much under-whelmed. The songs seemed to all have a similar tune with little variation and the vocals were uninspired; almost as if they were bored when recording this album. There was an emptiness about it...something maybe a little more enthusiasm could have fixed. I have listened to the full album twice to give it a good chance, but I'm sorry to say, it just didn't grab me.<br /><br />Best Songs<br />1. The Christmas Waltz<br />2. Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas<br />3. I'll be home for Christmas<br />4. The Christmas Song
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|My husband and I absolutely love this series!  It's one that we both enjoy watching and look forward to new episodes each week.  We love that there is finally something that we both enjoy and that we can't predict the end of before the show has even really started.  Witty, well-thought-out, and keeps you guessing: a refreshing show that doesn't have a ton of language, crude humor, etc.
B0055V0GQC|5.0|When you've got a Great, Big, Bug-a-lugs John Bonham drum sound & style AND you've got a singer that looks like a young Jim Morrison & sounds like 'Plant meets Rodgers' AND Groovy Riffage & melodic hooks in all the right places...it's Gotta be good right?? Well AWESOMELY Good is what it is. Besides the obvious nurturing these boys have had growin' up being spoonfed Classic-Rock, you can hear Janis & Big Brother & the Holding Co. would be Rasing a Glass to these guys as well. Another bonus is they've captured the early 70s productoin feel-(but with More sonnics obviously) Ahhh the Glory Days, when Bands were stripped back to Just Raw, Bleeding Passion!!! Bands like these are Flyin' the Flag & Keepin' the Faith in this age of \\"computerised machine noise\\"
B002VPE1WK|2.0|This is a fairly ok constructed backpak. However, that being said, it is SMALL. i am 6'6\\" tall and this looks like my 8 year old should be wearing it. Luckily it came free with my purchase, or i would be returning it. as i said, the construction is fair, but the size is ridiculous!!!
0895260131|5.0|Robert Spencer is the indispensable leader in explaining Islam to Westerners.  There can be no separation of political and religious Islam unless there are changes in the interpretations of the major works of Islam, and Spencer, both here and on his website, Jihad Watch, makes no bones about what the religion and political philosophy teach.  For those who want to stick their heads in the sand and pretend that there is no violent aspect to Islam, or that it really was (and is) a \\"religion of peace\\" feel free to avoid this book.  For those who want historical context, and to understand what it is in Islamic teachings that drives those who want to destroy the West, this is your one stop shop, though by all means, there are many other places teaching you about the goals of this political movement, if you're willing and not too scared, to look.
0670022705|4.0|****<br />\\"Dr MacGregor all along modestly emphasized collegiality and collectivity in the making of the radio series, but ... Only he could have persuaded a galaxy of talking heads, ... crafted this very particular, idiosyncratic and tendentious, inevitably, but also transcendently humane, history.\\" --Paul Cartledge, AG leventis professor, Cambridge University<br />*<br /><br />The history of the world isn't one of separate civilizations - we're all linked, we all interact, and always have done, remarked the Nobel Prize-winning economist Amartya Sen. This work would be a great place to start, by picking out 100 objects from the British Museum, to tell \\"a\\" history of the world.  Day by day a new treasure unearths, each one loaded with meaning. MacGregor and his museum colleagues to choose 100 objects \\"that had to range in date from the beginning of human history around two million years ago and come right up to the present day. The objects had to cover the whole world, as far as possible equally. All this is probably just nit-picking, but amazingly interesting.<br /><br />Neil MacGregor relates the history of the world by reference to 100 objects that can be just found in the British Museum, which he is director. Gloriously unfamiliar objects such as the sphinx of Tarharqo: 680 BC, and Tang Tomb figurines: AD 728, were brought alive and placed in their historical and cultural milieu in an amusing and often exciting way. There are several underlying themes, most important of which McG stated on the first exhibit, the mummy of Horned-jitef, an Egyptian priest from the Temple of Karnak, who reminds the world of our common heritage. A map of the heavens on the inner coffin lid, as habitual in the Egyptian belief, was meant to guide the Egyptian through the after life.<br /><br />That mankind has always tried to express itself artistically is one of the lessons we take from McG efforts. Mostly, the powerful have tried to dishonestly apply art for political propaganda, as was well illustrated by a Turkish coin with the head of Alexander the Great, or the bronze statue of the emperor Augustus, which was discovered in the Sudan. MacGregor comments sarcastically, \\"A thoughtful alien handling the banknotes of China and the United States today, might well assume that one was ruled by Mao and the other by George Washington.\\" While AG leventis professor, Paul Cartledge believes that the book arising from Radio 4's popular history series is a valuable artifact in itself.<br /><br />Another intellectual lesson in our global culture, is that events that we think at the epicenter to history might not be just the same in the estimation of our grandchildren or their children. MacGregor delights in the fact that among his objects, \\"Canonical events - the making of the Roman Empire, the Mongol destruction of Baghdad, the European Renaissance, the Napoleonic wars, the bombing of Hiroshima, ...\\"  are not central stage. If there is an evident bias in his selections, it is for the losers in history's great struggles; McG's  enjoys to make champions of underdogs whose societies were eclipsed centuries ago, and thereby coaches us to think of our own real place in the history of global civilization.in with the head of Alexander the Great, or the bronze statue of the emperor Augustus, which was discovered in the Sudan.

B003VANOFY|4.0|I bought this headset around 3 months ago for my birthday and it was awesome. Clear when listening to music and gaming and love the bass on the headset. I liked everything about the headset except for a couple of things. The USB is really fragile , the headset falls off my head when looking down, and the mic doesnt stay up anymore after 2 months after purchase. Other than that, the headset is amazing.
B001M5UDGS|5.0|Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog;  A must for any comedic cult collection.  Possibly the best low budget movie of the last 20 years
B004IY6API|5.0|Stained Class is a masterpiece throughout. They change direction here, it's a heavier than their earlier music and it's also a very influential metal album. Very progressive and complex. The one thing that I don't understand is why Judas Priest weren't as popular in the late '70s as they were in the '80s and on 1990 Painkiller. Maybe because it isn't very accessible and harder to get into, lyrics are darker and the music is very complex. Lyrically and musically it isn't very accessible but once I got into it, it became a classic and never gets old. Painkiller is still a great song but it's just fast drumming and guitar. It lacks the talented guitar solos and the songwriting. The lyrics lack depth and aren't that great. Same with British Steel, the guitar solos are real short and the album's extremely commercial. Stained Class isn't made for the radio, it's an album that the band wanted to make and it's a masterpiece. White Heat Red Hot and Beyond The Realms of Death are the best and are my favorite JP songs.
B000077VR3|5.0|Is as described, works well, looks new, definitely what i was looking for at a very low price.  Good to know that there are people who will still do true business.
B0013FXWU6|5.0|It does not come in a hard cover case. It is in a thiner paper one. Doesn't matter much to me, but in case anyone needed to know.
B004I8WD6E|5.0|So far i haven't had this case too long, probably 3 weeks, but so far it has held up fine and definitely is what i was looking for.  Looks good on my iPhone, fits very snugly but not too hard to take off.  Definitely a good buy.
B0041KKYBA|5.0|This is a great dvd that was recommended to me. So I bought it because it was such a great deal on amazon. It explains a lot about the current economic status of our country.
B005UBNKZG|5.0|This processor is great performance for your dollar.  This and its big brother the FX8150 performed very well on high end gaming (matched with a HD6870).  The only problem with the 8150 is they are hard to get due to demand.  This one was a little easier to get and cheaper without too steep of a  drop in performance.  They perform at the level of an i7 2600s and 2600 respectively, but at a substancially lower cost.  And the Turbo core is great, allowing you to kinda have the best of both worlds.  The multi-cores are great when you need them, but in applications that don't use them all, some will slow down to allow an increase in the clock speed of the ones you are using when you need just speed. A great thing for gaming. I have built a couple of these with 9 series AMD based motherboards using DDR3 1866 ram and they are fast and stable.  I have not tried any overclocking yet, but I hear that they can't be beat in overclocking (in fact at the time of this writing the 8150 holds the overclocking record).  You can build a really fast system at a very reasonable price with this setup.  The only possible negative I see is that the 8 cores appear to share four sets of cache (2 cores for each).  This seems like a possible bottleneck.  Obviously it still performs very well, but could likely perform much better if each core had its own cache.  I expect this will be corrected in future versions of the processor. But even with this possible issue, they are still the best high end performance for your dollar available.
B0064BCNA4|2.0|lags too much to be enjoyable on the kindle fire. might be fun for kids, but not adults. And probably not anybody else with musical inclinations.
B000CCD0HQ|5.0|Z Z Top / Tres Hombres (bonus live tracks version):  This is a great album.  They hadn't even been around long enough to grow the full beards yet, but they made one of the best albums of their careers.  Highly Recommended.  Five Stars
B003ZSJ212|5.0|They are BR Discs. They played when I put them in my BR Player. They did not try to sleep with my wife. Nuff said.
B000002JSJ|4.0|Led Zeppelin / Presence:  This is not their best album.  \\"Achilles' Last Stand\\" is the high point.  The pseudo-disco \\"Royal Orleans\\" is particularly disruptive and is nearly fatal to the album.  However, the rest of the songs are good, but they do not match the high standards of their previous albums.  There is just enough here to give the album Four Stars (I like it but I do not love it).
B002MQYOFW|4.0|A few friends recommended this trilogy to me and I was hesitant at first because of one reviewers use of the word \\"brutal\\" concerning the book. I don't like reading violent material. Reluctantly I gave it a try with the mind-set that if it was too violent I would just stop reading and remove it from my device.<br />I was pleasantly surprised to find it was not at all what I was thinking. The violence was not descriptive to the point I would even use the word \\"brutal\\" to describe it. REVIEWERS PLEASE BE CAREFUL WHAT YOU SAY, I ALMOST DIDN'T READ THIS BOOK BECAUSE OF THAT, WHICH HURTS THE AUTHOR'S OPPORTUNITIES TO MARKET HER BOOK TO A WIDER AUDIENCE.<br /><br />The Hunger Games, to me, focused more on how Katniss trys to survive the game by using her wits rather than the other option. Plus it does have a bit of a love story entwined.<br /><br />If you are on the fence as I was - give it a try. I think you will be glad you did, I was!
B000001FV1|5.0|Traffic / Shoot Out at the Fantasy Factory:  Traffic's gentle Blues/Jazz fusion is on perfect display in this Great album.  This is a real delight to listen to.  Five Stars
B0052UZIFA|5.0|This game works awesome on my EVO 4g . never froze crashed or rebooted it never lost data. this app needs update really badly though because compared to Apple this has nothing even close to the original
B000002J1O|5.0|Genesis / Selling England by the Pound:  This is a beautiful album.  Gabriel and company have obviously learned from their (largely successful) experimental albums and have given us a set of magnificent songs in Selling England by the Pound.  Five Stars
B004LWZW4M|4.0|I thought the movie was great, although it doesn't follow the original movie series (from the planet of the apes).  The writer missed that one or may be was hoping you would not remember.  I will not go into details as if I did, then you would most likely not buy the movie, unless you are just a collector and just want to be entertained.  The CGI work on this movie was awesome, only a very small number of errors in there design on closeup shots (to clean & perfect) that took away from the apes, but because of the fast action about half-way through the movie, you may not catch that. All in all this is only entertainment and a good one at that and I would still purchase this one again.
B000002J0B|5.0|Led Zeppelin / Houses Of The Holy:  Sure, \\"The Crunge\\" may make you cringe, but the rest of the album has enough great work to give this Five Stars.
B001UV4XJ2|5.0|There's not much to say but another great movie just like the the other7 movies so if you don't have them get them
B000PFFXOS|5.0|Jethro Tull / Aqualung (1984 CD - no bonus tracks, thank god):  Jethro Tull's Aqualung album is a Masterpiece.  The songs here are all fascinating, challenging, and beautiful.  A truly remarkable achievement in Rock history.  This one easily earns Five Stars.  If you don't have it, get it.
B003XCVQ3C|5.0|I'm using with a new (late 2011) MacBook Pro 17. This works as advertised, video and audio, with several of my HDMI displays. No hidden problems. If you're looking for HDMI from your MacBook, this is a good solution.
B00005CDUE|4.0|Roxy Music / The best of... :  The band had several good and entertaining hits in the 1970's with a style that greatly influenced many bands in the 1980's.  This CD has those hits, and several of their lesser songs.  Eighteen songs in a single Hits CD is pretty good, but for this band, eighteen is too many.  Four Stars
B005TZFZJC|1.0|I thinks its obvious that her fans have very LOW standards for music if some of these ratings are anything to go by, (Along with their IQs). Only about 5 of these songs are even half way Decent. It was obviously Rushed: recycled beats, Weak production, horrible lyrics and all. I thought loud was just AVG but compared to this it was an fing Masterpiece!! But maybe it was strategy, create an album so bad that it makes Loud look like a Classic by comparison!!<br /><br />Loud: 3.5/5<br /><br />TTT: 2/5 (being nice!)<br /><br />She herself is not be but her music is just beyond overrated. smh
B000002GYW|4.0|Eagles / Desperado: This one has some classic Eagles hits, but the rest of the album is just ok.  This is one I like, but not love.  A strong Four Star album.
1451648537|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. It was entertaining, enlightening, and inspiring. I've never enjoyed a biography as much. Highly recommended for anyone who likes reading about smart people.
B000002U82|5.0|Pink Floyd / Dark Side of The Moon (1994 EMI CD):  To state the obvious, this album is a Masterpiece.  There is no mystery to this album, the lyrics are clear enough for anyone to understand.  The music is a sonic pleasure.  Every track on it is brilliant.  This is one of the finest albums ever made.  This 1994 CD has the album, and just the album.  No bonus cuts, no endless bits of useless garbage.  This is the album as it ought to be heard.  This album should be given a Sixth Star.
B005MYEPXC|5.0|I'm simply here to add more praise to this wonderful film. I went in knowing little about this film, and ended up leaving the theater with a big smile on my face. Woody Allen writes and directs Midnight in Paris, with a stellar cast of Owen Wilson, Rachel McAdam, Michael Sheen, and Marion Cotillard.   Allen is able to make an enchanting tale that sets his Gil (Wilson) on a journey of self-discovery, by having him explore Paris at midnight. I don't want to give much away, but he is able to visit the Paris of his dream--the 1920's with some of the greatest intellectuals of the 20th century. He's on a journey of self-discovery, and on a journey to answer the \\"why\\" in his life. Why didn't he stay in Paris in his youth, when he had a chance? Why does he feel like there's something missing from his life? Little does he know that someone from the past will shed light on the answer that was always there.   This is not a film you should miss, nor should Allen's personal life detract you from watching it. I promise it's a great film, that will have you laughing and smiling. Pay no attention to reviewers who consider Allen's portrayal of the historical figures as \\"cardboard cutouts.\\" Ultimately, this is Allen's film set during magical nights in Paris, so his aim for historical accuracy of how the character's of the past should have ABSOLUTELY acted was not on his mind. But even biopics don't get that right, and no one is ever happy. Oh well, I feel sorry for them.   And take my word for it, this film would will be nominated for plenty of Oscar's.   4.5/5  **I will update this review with a review of the Blu-ray's audio and video quality.
B0029XFNA8|2.0|Unfortunately in the case of Miracle on 34th Street, the higher resolution of Blu-ray translates into an overly contrasty image with a lot of noise (I mean a lot of noise)  It is a shame that such a classic movie was not properly remastered.  The image quality, to my eye almost unwatchable.  The softer image of the dvd version is a little better.  The standard for quality Blu-ray black and white reissue of a classic movie is Casa Blanca.  This is an example of the kind of result possible when people actually care about quality.
098357670X|5.0|I found Tom Richmond's site a couple years ago and have been awed by the sheer amount of information that he shares. This book gives you top-notch information from a master in the field of art and caricature, teaching you how to *think* like an artist, not just copy lines or follow formulas.
B00664AM5C|2.0|I think the writer did a good job researching CDC protocols and virus microbiology, fruitbat as the vector, etc., but the subplots tended to be irritating. The overblown storyline about the blogger stands out the most, but even fishburn's bit with the janitor's son, or the microbiologist savior's kissing scene with her dad just made it seem like an over-dramatized made-for-tv movie.   Like a CSI episode it is as if the writer learned some tidbits of information about the virus pathology industry during research, then makes up some hacked together supervirus, packaged with some flashy microbiology terms to give the impression of subject mastery.  Also the happy 'realistic' ending seemed ridiculous, given the nature of the virus they were dealing with. In a similar vein, I  suppose Steve will make a movie about the EPA stopping global warming next.   Being a Soderbergh film you will see a lot of imho over-dramatised imagery and acting, complete with actors giving 'naturalistic' pauses, stammers, reactions, misspeaks, etc. Perhaps i've grown cynical, but it comes off as very self-indulgent.  Traversing the globe just to get establishing shots of chinese provinces, empty airpots and empty cities must be where the 50 million dollar budget went. 2.4 rounds down to 2 stars!

0439023521|1.0|Need more be said? Violence is not appealing. And worse, there's no redeeming factor to the book. No moral lesson. Perplexed by the popularity of these books. I do not want my kids reading these. Would prefer no one read these.
B0001Z52RU|5.0|I bought this movie because my girlfriend had never seen it and I have always enjoyed this movie. So natuarally, it made a good fit to my movie collection. This movie is very well done with a gripping plot, great acting, and good writing that will have you guessing till the end. I highly recommend this to anyone who needs a good movie to watch
1466311649|1.0|Being an artist for twenty plus years...I had low expectations for this book. However insightful, the one glaring drawback is that on several pages the art and the text are very poorly printed. Otherwise this book would be a great addition to the library of any artist.
B0063IH60K|5.0|so nice to have deals that are solvable and fast silky smooth graphics.  entertainment for hours.  great way to pass wasted time like @ the airport
1451629184|5.0|Fantastic, easy read. I saw this story on 20/20 and bought the book shortly there after. I started reading it when I went to bed one night and stayed up easily past 4am reading it. I finished it that following afternoon and lent it to a friend who also couldn't put it down. It was quite a compelling story. Dugard writes in an easy to understand manner that describes her endeavors in a compassionate and concise manner. She delivers the harsh details in a descriptive but not \\"gory\\" way. Definitely an uplifting account of how hope and good prevails. GREAT READ!

His name is in the credits.  I remember him talking about this. His last few months on earth this is all he talked about. Watching this is like sitting next to him in the hospital on his last few days listening to him rant about this and that.   He later became a city cop for Harrisburg, Pa.   He passed on very proud of his work in the army and very proud of the men he was there with. We are very proud of him as well and thankful to all the men and women who served over there and over here to fight for the freedom of europe and bring down the men who commited such atrocities to sociecty and mankind.
B002RLYF2Y|2.0|The mic's appearance is amazing. It looks very professional and it's very bulky, not made very cheap. The bundle comes with no instructions and it's very complex to put together. The sound is pretty well, if you like background noise. I have additional filters for it and they didn't help, even in a sound proofed studio you can still detect lots of backing noise. It's impossible to hide the noise. The mic is great quality though, vocal volumes come out very mixed though and you'll have to add many EQ's and Compressor's to what you've recorded to equalize the vocals volume. It's an okay mic. For a cheap price you get a cheap mic.
B005MYEQ4U|3.0|While I share Woody Allen's take on conservative Republicans, pretentious intellectuals and vapid, materialistic twentysomethings, he's set up those straw figures so often that they reek of shtick. The first twenty minutes or so of this movie, where we establish Gil Pender as a \\"real, authentic writer\\" surrounded by by a bunch of phonies (including his fiancee) made me squirm in  my seat. As soon as Gil has the first of his many forays into the Paris of the early 20th century, that's when MIDNIGHT IN PARIS finally gets traction and becomes a lot of fun. Gil is clearly having the time of his life living in the past, and each time he goes back to \\"the present,\\" I found myself wondering why on earth FOR? Owen Wilson makes as acceptable a Woody Allen stand-in as John Cusack was in BULLETS OVER BROADWAY...every mannerism he makes in this film screams \\"Woody!,\\" but it's not a distraction. The movie resolves itself about as you would expect it to, making this a pleasant experience on the level of EVERYONE SAYS I LOVE YOU, if not to the calibre of HANNAH AND HER SISTERS.<br /><br />In my opinion, MIDNIGHT IN PARIS is the best movie Woody Allen's made since SWEET AND LOWDOWN over 10 years ago. Take that however you want.
B000KKPN5C|5.0|I have a Nikon 3100, and I was looking for a flash that was better than the built in flash, but did not want a huge bulky SB type of flash.  Most importantly I am an amateur / professional / but not professional photographer. Therefore, I did not want to spend $400 on a flash that would need a lot of setting up.  This flash is plug and play.  I used the very expensive Energizer lithium batteries, and the flash is as fast as the camera. Also the batteries lasted longer than the Camera's rechargeable battery.  I have only two cons to this flash.  The flash is not powerful enough to use a soft box, or at least in my amateur experience it wasn't.  Also the flash does tilt up and down for the bounce off the ceiling effect, but it does not rotate, therefore you loose that ability when doing portrait pics. Yes, I know the fancy flashes do that, but this flash is awesome.  If you have a Nikon 3100, you should buy this flash!

It was a book filled with pages of enticing, forbidden love between a wolf and human. I recalled the love that Sam and Grace had for one another it made me cry. I remember it made me want to believe in love again.<br /><br />Disclosure: I participated in Books for Review Club and a copy was provided to me by the author. No payment was received by me in exchange for this review. There was not any obligation to write a positive review.

This disclosure is in accordance with the Federal Trade Commission's 16 CFR, Part 255, Guides Concerning the Use of Endorsements and Testimonials in Advertising.<br /><br />When my reading club moderators announced that we would be reading The Wolves of Mercy Falls Series, I was ecstatic. I had always wanted to share the story with my daughter and luckily she was now eleven and we could share the story together.<br /><br />Unfortunately, reading Shiver with my daughter did not go as well as I had anticipated. Instead of her falling madly in love with the book as I had with the book the first few pages; I was bombarded with question after question.<br /><br />She has asked so many questions that I really could not answer without giving away the story. Though I enjoyed reading, the book again alongside my daughter, I saw the book in a completely new light. Grace's love for Sam the wolf and Sam the wolf as well as Sam the young man confused my daughter.<br /><br />I had never noticed that Shiver's supernatural story line skirted a thin line with bestiality. Not wanting my daughter to broach the subject of bestiality with my eleven-year-old daughter I was quick to make the choice of revealing to her that when Grace was bitten she too was changed into a werewolf that has never shifted, so it is the wolf within her that is attracted to Sam the wolf. Though Grace never crossed the line with Sam the wolf, it was evident that throughout the story from beginning to end that Grace's love for Sam, transcended the beyond that of animal or human.<br /><br />We both love the tenderness of both Sam and Grace. However, as the story unfolds, Grace and Sam explore their feelings for one another as the tension in the small town of Mercy Falls grows when the attack of a fellow classmate puts the town on edge and Sam in danger.<br /><br />It took me more time explaining the story to my daughter than it did reading so, that she would understand the authors frame of mind for her characters. I know it has a rating of ages 12-17. However, I would not allow my daughter to read this on her own nor in the accompany of her ill informed friends. It can raise questions that parents should take the time to answer. I am in my 30's and I love the book; though I feel the age range should be raised from 12 and up to 16 and up. Only because by age 16 most children who have not had the facts of life talk with their own parents should have had sex education in the public school system.reading, the book again alongside my daughter, I saw the book in a completely new light.

0307593312|5.0|I just finish 1Q84 and I like it! A lot! Truly Haruki Murakami! Dream, reality - or to put it right - realities....  all beautifully crafted together. Reading, and your mind will come to remember strange images from  A Wild Sheep Chase, Hard Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World, maybe not in the same ruthlessly bizarre stile but a somehow in a more refined manner. If I have know how good 1Q84 was I would keep it  to read over the Christmas holiday.
0061537969|5.0|This was a great book; I love hearing the story from the dogs perspective...something all dog lovers wonder about. It's true, you will laugh and cry at same time, but what I really took away from this book...is the reminder to keep fighting and never give up.
1423140591|5.0|This book is totally Riordan's best book so far! Although gorgons acting as Bargain Mart greeters giving out tasty samples of Crispy Cheese'n' Wieners try to destroy Percy, he escapes to camp Jupiter to join the Roman demigods and fulfill his destiny. Joined by Frank Zhang, who can be anything he wants to be, and Hazel, who has died and lives again, Percy's adventures take him across the US with a few detours, like the one with the screaming and the weed whackers, through the headquarters of Amazon.com which is of course, run by Amazons, to Alaska, where the gods have no power, to kill a son of Gaea, restore death and - oh, by the way, the gods now have i-Pads and skype - and to save camp Jupiter from an assortment of monsters and grain spirits and another son of Gaea. This is a fantastic and rather funny adventure and I really think it is Riordan's best book that I have read yet. I look forward to the next book in this series!<br />flag
0865478570|2.0|Having spent twenty-five years as a professional translator (Russian-English), I was excited when this book was recommended to me, but I was very disappointed by it. The book is long-winded, poorly organized, and the author's views are bizarre and unconvincing. I'll cite a couple of examples.  Have you ever repeated the old canard \\"The Eskimo have a hundred words for snow\\"? What did you mean by that? \\"Well, see, Eskimos know way more than we do about snow, so their language would reflect ...\\" NO! You lie! This book will tell you what you \\"actually\\" meant:  \\"The 'concrete' languages of the non-Western world were not just the reflection of the lower degree of civilization of the peoples who spoke then but the root cause of their backward state. By the dawn of the twentieth century, 'too many concrete nouns' and 'not enough abstractions' became the conventional qualities of 'primitive' tongues.   That's what people actually mean when they repeat the story about Eskimo words for snow...\\"  So, you are \\"actually\\" the conscious agent of a long-discredited, patronizing, century-old linguistic theory. You are a dupe of the evil \\"Great Eskimo Vocabulary Hoax\\"... I'd tell you more, but my eyes glazed over at this point. This might have been meaningful fifty or sixty years ago. (And, in fact, Inuit being a polysynthetic language, one could well argue that the number of \\"Eskimo words for snow\\" is practically infinite).  This book also makes light of the often insurmountable problems of translating poetry. It is reported that Vladimir Nabokov struggled for years with the possibility of translating Pushkin's \\"Onegin\\" into English, finally concluding that a real translation was not possible. Bellos opines that this means only that \\"Nabokov didn't want to try\\" (as if any \\"try\\" counts as a translation). So, David Bellos presumes to straighten out Vladimir Nabokov regarding translation of Pushkin? I'm sorry, David. No.  You can read the book if this sort of stuff strikes you as funny.I was not amused.
1423124960|4.0|The book itself is really great. There are about 2-3 stories per princess, and every princess is included. I would have no complaints about the book, but when I opened it to take a peek inside before wrapping it for my 3-year old cousin, the first three pages fell out upon turning them. The book itself is so nice! The edges of the pages are silver, so it looks nice on the shelf. It's pretty heavy and the outer cover is very sturdy. I was so disappointed when I opened the book, and I was left with pages in my hands! Still, I think that in my case, I just repaired the book on my own. I needed it for Christmas, and I knew that my cousin would never know the difference, and she would really love the book. Still, buy at your own risk! If you are not willing to fix the book on your own, you may be forced to return it. Enjoy!

1439153663|5.0|As I read this book I was reminded of the Victorian novels I read as a young girl, in which the heroine always faced the most awful circumstances but was rescued by a hero at various turns in her life, each one with a secret that tormented him or her and caused the story to twist and turn until it resolved itself in some way, at the end, with consequences that could not be avoided or altered.<br /><br />This book is a saga well worth the read. I listened to an audio version and the reader did a spectacular job speaking in many voices and never confusing any of the characters. Her expression was spot-on. It was almost like watching a show playing out in my mind. The well developed characters are gentler and wiser than those far more educated and worldly, and they will endear themselves to you. Those that do not are typical of the cruel monsters we often encounter in life and ascribe their tormented souls to their environment or their experience, but whatever the reason, they are the dregs of the universe.<br /><br />The opening horror-filled scene is quickly moved into the background as the story begins on a beautiful plantation in the 1700's, a time when slavery was accepted and people were property.<br /><br />A young child, Lavinia, is brought home to a plantation by the master of the property, the Captain, and she is placed in the Kitchen House to work alongside the slaves, although she is Caucasian. Her brother has been sold, her parents are dead, and she is alone in the world.<br /><br />Blacks who are enslaved and without free papers are doomed to a life of unbearable bondage, poor housing, insufficient food, overwork and constant fear of being beaten, used or sold and separated from those they loved. In spite of their hardships, they forge a community and care for each other, taking pleasure in life's simple joys. They embrace Lavinia, regardless of her color, and nurse her back to health.<br /><br />This is Lavinia's story. She grows up \\"colorblind\\" and is not aware of her different station in life or of the fact that she will be free some day, and she loves her home and her family, Mama Mae, Papa George, Uncle Jacob, Belle, the twins, and all the family that surrounds her. She wants to remain with them forever. Her days are work filled and pleasant, once she grows used to her surroundings and responsibilities. She thrives and is actually happy, working and enjoying the friendship of other children her age. As young as she is, she cares for those younger and learns to love.<br /><br />This is the story of her plight, which although in sharp contrast with the plight of slaves, is almost as dreadful. even though only for a finite term, of which she is unaware. They are all owned. It is the story of her innocence, her ignorance and naïvet&eacute; which leads to dramatic events, some happy and some tragic.<br /><br />The secrets and mysteries of life on the plantation move the tale in numerous twists and turns. Knowing the truth would have made circumstances turn out in a happier fashion, but these were times when many things were not discussed openly, and women had limited power and freedom. Women belonged to their husbands as much as slaves belonged to their masters, albeit they lived in better circumstances.<br /><br />The author has done a commendable job capturing the idea of what it meant to be a \\"slave\\" and a \\"master\\" from both perspectives, as well as how enslaved a wife was, even though she was \\"free\\". The author has captured the mood of the times, the hardships, total helplessness and hopelessness and the need for utter obedience and humility in order to survive the most distasteful circumstances and in order to put up with the most cruel and despicable people. The lives of slaves were incidental, unimportant to the masters, simply property. There was no justice, no recourse and  utterly no regard for their needs or their humanity. They were unable to fight back and had to witness and bear the most awful punishments and deprivations, sometimes just at the whim of the master.<br /><br />Through Lavinia's eyes, we experience the life of a slave and a free woman in the same body. The lesson we learn from Lavinia is that one's color does not make a difference. Like \\"The Boy In The Striped Pajamas\\", when stripped to our souls we are the same, only some of us are cruel and some of us are kind and it is not our color or religion that determines that, but the sickness in one's mind.es, we experience the life of a slave and a free woman in the same body.

0756405890|5.0|I don't know how I missed the buzz around this debut novel four years ago.  I'm not a huge reader of fantasy, but I must have been asleep or something.  However, with the excitement over the release of book 2 earlier this year, not even I could ignore the buzz.  Too many people were raving too loudly.<br /><br />I'm happy to report the raves were well-founded.  In the whopping first volume of this series, Patrick Rothfuss has done a fantastic job of setting up the tale of an epic hero named Kvothe.  In the present day of the novel, he's living modestly, essentially disguised as a quiet innkeeper.  Only his assistant knows his true identity until Chronicler shows up asking questions and wanting to record Kvothe's life story.  The bulk of the novel is comprised of Kvothe recounting his traumatic childhood through his first year at university.  It's an amazing story, and truly the beginning of an epic tale.<br /><br />The Name of the Wind is an exceptionally accomplished debut novel.  To start with, Rothfuss has done an excellent job of world-building.  He does a great job of creating a time, place, and multiple cultures.  Additionally, he's created an interesting, consistent, and nearly believable system of magic.  Kvothe is a great character, more than strong enough to build this tale upon, but the secondary characters are terrific as well.  And finally, it's a terrific story!  This first volume comprises a full arc and comes to a very satisfying conclusion, but leaves the reader anxious to continue on.<br /><br />I'm lucky to have avoided the four-year wait the early adopters of this series had.  Alas, having now read both of the published volumes (And book 2 is even better!), I'm in the same boat as everyone else waiting for the conclusion.
B005NFJAZS|5.0|We ordered three musicals on DVD from Amazon to give as a birthday gift.  This one is a favorite.

1423389387|5.0|I was late coming to this series.  In fact, it was all the excitement over the publication of this second book that inspired me to start the series.  And it was the excellence of book 1 that inspired me to continue with these doorstoppers.  As much as I enjoyed the first book, the second was exponentially better.<br /><br />Book 2 continues the life story of the hero Kvothe as it is being told to Chronicler.  As in the first book, Kvothe relates his tale in his own words, with occasional interludes set in the novel's present at the inn.  I'm not going to try to summarize 1,000 pages of epic.  What I will say is that book 2 opens in the immediate wake of the events of book 1.  As noted in the novel's title, it is the second of three days in which Kvothe is going to be telling his tale.  In the present, more than ever it's clear that the current Kvothe is a diminished version of his former self.  This book continues the story of Kvothe's education at the university, and all of the relationships--good and bad--that were introduced in book 1.  But this volume takes Kvothe on adventures far beyond his comfort zone at the university.<br /><br />One of the reasons I think this second novel is so successful is that Rothfuss did a great job building the world and establishing rich characters in the first novel.  With all of that in place, the reader can jump right back into the story and be fully immersed without a lot of build-up.  Unless, of course, the reader is like me, and forgets every novel they read as soon as they've finished it.  Here again, I have to give props to Rothfuss.  Without a lot of repetition or regurgitation of past plot, he gracefully exposits exactly what the reader needs to get back into the story.  I remembered everything that I needed to.<br /><br />It's difficult to maintain reader interest over 1,000 pages.  Rothfuss does a great job with plot and pacing.  He keeps things interesting and moving along briskly.  I was never bored and my interest never flagged.  That said, the scenes at the university are always my favorite because I'm in love with all the characters that inhabit that world, from Kvothe's many friends, the diverse professors, and the townsfolk he interacts with.  Each is an individual, and maybe this is an artifact of sheer page count, but they all have such well-developed personalities and seem so real--which strikes me as especially impressive in a work of fantasy.  This is also due to the tremendous talent of reader Nick Podehl who performed the audiobook and gave each character a distinctive voice, accent, and personality.<br /><br />Considering the great length of these novels, you can't complain too much about the four years between books 1 and 2.  Noneheless, I'm hoping that the wait for book 3 will be somewhat shorter.  I think middle books of trilogies are incredible hard to pull off.  Given Mr. Rothfuss's success here, my expectations for the conclusion are sky high.cenes at the university are always my favorite because I'm in love with all the characters that inhabit that world, from Kvothe's many friends, the diverse professors, and the townsfolk he interacts with.

While there, he finds that he can go back into the 1920s, his favorite era--filled with the writers and artists he idolizes--as soon as the clock strikes midnight on a certain little street.  Then he wants to go every night, while the rest of his group wonders where he is all night long.  As one can imagine, this leads to conflicts between him and his fiancee, who does not share his vision of being a writer living and working in Paris; she wants to go back to their native Pasadena/Hollywood existence.<br /><br />A treat for those who enjoy the Roaring 20s and Allen films.

B003XF1OJK|5.0|I have been a Halo video game fan for many years. But I thought a book based on a game would be corny. With this book I was very surprised. It was very well written and goes in to deep history of Master Chief and explains how the Spartans became Spartans and why. I would recommend this book to anyone that likes science fiction because of the writing. But it is extremely enjoyable to Halo fans because it tell the story of the early days of the Spartans and answers some questions about Master Chief.
B005V4FJC4|4.0|I purchased this as on a whim while Amazon was having a $5 sale on many Christmas albums ... I had never even heard a single She & Him song, with my only exposure to Zooey Deschanel's voice being her quirky \\"band\\" in the movie Yes Man.<br /><br />Rare is the occasion upon which I enjoy an entire Christmas album by a single artist or band (with the exceptions of Josh Groban's Noel and the Trans-Siberian Orchestra's Christmas Eve and Other Stories, I prefer compilation albums), so this could have easily gone wrong for me.  However, from the moment I finished 'The Christmas Waltz' (which, I agree with other reviewers, is one of the best tracks on the album), I was hooked.  Once I finished the entire album, I inevitably went to find and procure She & Him's other two albums.  Like some other reviewers, I did feel 'Baby It's Cold Outside' was a weak spot (but in their defense, not many artists manage to pull this one off capably).<br /><br />I typically only add 1-2 new Christmas albums to my collection per holiday season, so I like ones that age well.  This one has a great blend of reverence for the old classics and a certain fearlessness for putting their own spin on things to keep them fresh and new.  I have a feeling we will be enjoying this one for many seasons to come.
B000U27BLO|3.0|Tries to be a kid's book starring Sophie which covers the history of philosophy, but instead ends up being a book known for covering the history of philosophies.  At least that's how it was talked-up to me.  I didn't find the narrative pacing very compelling, but it is good for philosophic fundamentals.  Did the name 'Sophie' come from the \\"sophic\\" in 'philosophic'?    Anyway, acted like a philosophical refresher course for me.  While not a bad reading experience, it read more like non-fiction than fiction.
B003UYV08E|4.0|First, I want to say that this review is for the movie and not the box. I hate it when you read a review and some idiot starts out by reviewing the damn box the movie came in. I guess if I dropped a turd in a cute little box and sealed it up good that's enough for a 5 star review. Give me a break!<br /><br />I really enjoyed the original Iron Man more the 2nd time around. I started the sequel but never finished it. I recently came back to it with a fresher perspective and I really enjoyed it. In a nutshell, the sequel pits Iron Man against 3 foes: a vengeful Russian named Ivan (Mickey Rourke), a rival battle-suit maker played by Sam Rockwell, and finally himself as the hardware in the middle of his chest supporting his body is going bad. The story was decent enough for the world that this film takes place in. The action scenes and special effects were well done. If I had a choice between Don Cheadle and Terrence Howard I'd take Howard only because I believe that his charisma matches up with Downey's.<br /><br />This film was definitely not as good as the first film in the story department but the action was as good if not better. And I think the film set up next year's Avengers movie well. I wonder if the Hulk's going to be in that film? Anyway, like I said, Iron Man 2 is a good, not great, sequel and if you go into it with realistic expectations you will like the film.

His words depicting the  human interactions of a 2011 person with those in the late 1950s make for captivating reading. For those folks who have not been King  disciples but who would like to wonder about possible consequences of journeying through a time tunnel and specifically wondering about  the dark deed in Dallas, this novel is awesome.

B001AW156U|4.0|These trigger attachments are great, they fit my fingers better, and make it less likely that I will accidentally trigger one of the shoulder buttons when I put my controller down.  Unfortunately, they only clip on, and over time will not be as secure as they should be.  This is mostly due to the fact that a PS3 controller is abused.  I drop it, step on it, it falls off of tables and chairs, and frankly I'm surprised the controller even works any more.  Maybe if they included some better way to secure it I would give it 5 stars, but as it stands, it falls off a lot, and the only way to secure it is to glue it in place.<br /><br />Still, these are more comfortable than the default triggers, and are worth it.

0061174793|5.0|Who doesn't love the mouse books?  They are cute and funny and fun not only for my daughter but for me as well!  And this is such a great set, I am a big fan of board books. These are small enough that my daughter can hold them herself and try to flip through them on her own.  If you are a fan of the mouse books, or even new to them, I definitely recommend these books!
B005D9MUWY|5.0|We use this all the time and love it.  We bought it for each of the family phones. We sing its praise everywhere.
098357670X|5.0|This is the book I was waiting to be written. It was quite a hassle to get it here in the UK, but with patience you can move the mountains.  It is perfect to me and for my drawing needs. My 4 yo daughter loves it and she is ecstatic when it comes about to draw the funny faces.   Thank you Tom.
B001JNNDGA|5.0|If you Love the Lord Jesus Christ then this is the movie for you rest assured,i bought the regular version but this blu-ray beats it,Thank You.
1401324029|5.0|This is really a good book.  I have read all 3 of these books written by Richard Castle and have enjoyed each one.  They are in excellent condition and I always get speedy delivery.  Amazon does an amazing job.  Thank you, Amazon - Keep up the good work.  I will continue to purchase items from you in the future.
B0019O6IWU|5.0|I read this book and every page of it is a gift. I loved it and learned a lot with it. I have already changed some of my behaviors and responses due to the teachings it has. The world would be different if more people would read it and follow its teachings.  Thanks Rosenberg for this precious book. The examples help a lot to clarify the concepts. And by reading this book I reflected a lot on personal examples and imagined new ways to approach those situations. Hope to be able to transform my communication with these precious teachings.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This series kept me reading long into the night. I really enjoyed the unique story and the constant action. Although it was sad, it was a great story. I cant wait for the movie!
0143038419|5.0|I have received the book as a Christmas gift from a friend who told me that she had two options: read it to understand me or give it to me so that I could know someone just like me :)  I really enjoyed the book and read it in 2 days. Elizabeth writes in a colorfull way. Her journey is indeed more than a journey and because I felt much like her I appreciated every piece of it.  The italian part is like a preparation part. Could almost be like a \\"Sex and the City episode\\" or something like that. The second part in India is absolutely lovely!!!!! Her transformation is incredible and it really made me rethink some of my options, including getting back to yoga. And the best part is that everyone can do that, and doesn't need to go to India. Finding oneself, acquiring calm and knowing our deep selves is possible if we just stop our everyday seeking life and start doing simple things like meditating, chanting mantras, etc. I also enjoyed her explanations about the concepts that are strange to the most part of the people. She presents yoga and buddhism concepts in such a simple way and integrates them so well in her story that sometimes I felt like I was also meditating with her.  The last part I found less appealing but at the same time it makes us wonder that love is just around the corner if we are open to see it!!!!!!!
B0063IH60K|5.0|Smooth running. Never had it force close on me. Lots of options to choose from. really Great app. Droid X.
B004I744AS|5.0|I like it!
B0040UAYI4|4.0|It works with the ps3, software out of the box version 2.0  seems to have slight delay, keys work 95% of the time. every now and then when i use the key designated for crouching in the game  it doesnt respond with the first tap of the key, reload key responds the same. moving seems to be ok but cant strafe left and move forward at the same time, but can strafe right and move forward ok.  UPDATE FIRMWARE TO VERSION 3.0  ,AND UPDATE THE DRIVERS , watch the video on advanced calibration 3.0   works GREAT.  LOVE IT.
1451648537|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  As a business owner, it made me think of ways to make my business better for my clients.  Jobs will certainly go down as one of the best inventors of our time and I am grateful he took time to collaborate with Walter Isaacson on this book.  Paul W. Hamilton  Attorney at Law  Nashville, GA
B004I8WD6E|5.0|Just this week I purchased this case for my wife's brand new iPhone 4s that I am giving to her as a Christmas present.  I just couldn't wait to give it to her, so I broke down and gave it to her a few days early because her old Android would barely even make calls anymore.  I received this case in the mail a day later and was pleasantly surprised how perfectly it fits.  The material is a pliable rubber material, but is not squishy and soft like many other inferior cases for iPhone.  It is flexible enough to attach easily and fit tightly around the phone, but also rigid enough to protect the phone from most drops.  My wife generally keeps her phone in her purse which exposes it to all kinds of scratches from keys and other assorted objects she keeps in there, so the screen protector included with this case was an added bonus.  It also fit perfectly and was applied with little effort.  It also does a great job of protecting the screen and seems almost exactly like other products of its kind like Zagg or Ghost Armor.  The bottom line is that this is exactly the product I was looking for, and it exceeded all of my expectations.  Get it...you'll love it!
B0015DROBO|5.0|If you arent super into technicalities in writing and \\"masterpieces\\", anyone who gave this a low score is a bit snobby. Its a very enjoyable read for the average reader. Its one of the best books ive ever read.
B005QYKE2Y|1.0|As usual in this series, the writing was a joke. The effects were spectacular, but I winced several times at the cheesy dialogue and woeful exposition.  The animated move from the 80's is a much better story.  I'd heard that this installment was much better than the first two, but I was just as dissapointed.  I also thought we might have less women walking around looking like expensive call girls with Megan Fox's exit, but there was even more gratuitous butt and boob exposure than in the others.  I should have known better than to waste my 4 dollars and 2 and a half hours.  Don't let your kids watch this!
B0052UZIFA|1.0|my wife has the game on her ipod and she has the zine garden, Minnie game, and the puzzle and this version does not have it
B005J4TLN4|5.0|Amazing! This movie is a great movie, it makes you cry and laugh! By the end you will love the characters! This moie is amazing so quit reading the reviews and go watch it right now!
B001HN6918|2.0|Nowhere near as good as the first one.   The first one was funny, witty, clever, and fun.   This movie is just a lot of animated kung fu, and fight scenes that seem endless (not in a good way).   I rarely write reviews, but I was truly anticipating watching this movie with my kids - we had so much fun watching, and re-watching, the original Kung Fu Panda. Sure, there's a little back story about Po, but there is none of the newness of the first. In short, skip it - unless you are really into the kung fu - in which case you'll appreciate the long long long fight scenes.   For my money, I'll re watch the first one, or any of the solid older films in the genre (Incredibles, Madagascar (1 or 2), Ratatouille, etc)...
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book was excellent! My first thought after finishing was, \\"I hope there's more than one of these.\\" My second thought was, \\"This would be a really good movie.\\" I was in luck! This is the first book of the Hunger Games Trilogy and the movie is set to release in March 2012.   The overall premise of the book is kind of disturbing, but the author writes it in a way that is not too graphic, while still being extremely exciting. Although these are kids, some as young as 12, battling to the death, she writes them in a way that makes them appear much older. It is very easy to sort of put yourself in the shoes of the main character and feel the same fear that she must have felt when she is being prepared for the arena.  This book was excellent, and it did not take me too much longer to read the entire trilogy! I recommend all three books, you will be satisfied!
B0063IH60K|4.0|Lots of fun. time killer.  enjoy the many different settings this has to offer. i have my family asthe back ground anf the kids as the cards.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This game is so addicting! Lots of fun, a great way to pass the time and well worth the download. I play this all the time - I wish I could give it 10 stars!!
B0019N8P2W|4.0|Everyone and their mother already know about the music issue with this series - MTV couldn't get it, they're not there, we cope.  To me, while the music was awesome and really just underlined what Daria was as a series, it's not a deal breaker. I love these DVDs almost as much as if the music had been there - the characters, humor, and funny plot lines are still there and definitely worth a second, third, and fourth watch. This is one of the all-time greatest things that ever came from MTV, and if there were more series like this one aired on TV today, I'd probably watch a lot more.  As it is, I'll deal with it by putting on some Daria when the world just becomes too annoying - this was the first show that taught me that it's okay being different; it's even preferable, even if it is hard sometimes. This series serves to remind me of this and helps me celebrate it.
B004U52VPS|4.0|My little ones love it as well as myself. You can spend hours trying to beat the game. Just be sure you limit the playing time.
1442419814|4.0|I resisted reading this for a long time. I don't really know why...maybe it was the ugly/pretty idea in a teen novel. I was afraid it would be very 'teen' in tone (if you've read enough YA fiction, you'll know what I mean. Some YA books have a very immature tone and usually have pop culture references, idiotic slang and huge leaps in logic. I greatly dislike these types of YA books).  I neededn't have worried, though. Uglies isn't anything like I thought it would be. It's a dystopian world with a very interesting twist. Some of the slang is a little confusing at first, but it is explained as the novel progresses. Personally, I found the first book to be a little slow (there are large sections where not much happens, but because this is the first of four novels, the author needed time to build the world so I was OK with the slightly slower pace). I liked Tally's voice and her character. She was believable and grew in a logical way. I also liked David. I'm hoping Shay and Peris (hate that name, sorry) become stronger characters in the next novel ('Pretties').  I'd say if you're on the fence about this series, you should give it a try. It's better than I expected and I'm eager for the next book.
B0043URV5U|5.0|Great, was a good mix of songs. Could have done without the Little Drummer Boy. Good CD to rock to in the car.
B003L77GRO|2.0|The video was very pixelated.  I suppose I should have realized that the price would indicate the quality of the product.
0375851569|5.0|I bought this set as a Xmas gift for my 5yr old son. The set arrived promptly and in perfect condition. The books are so interesting that my 5yr old son became so engrossed in reading. He picked up book by book and read them aloud all by himself. It is awesome! I can hear him laughing to himself as he reads aloud. The books are easy to read, funny, capture children's attention and makes them want to read aloud as the words rhyme. A great collection indeed!
0316056863|5.0|BUY THIS book! It was one of the funniest books I have read in a long time. I couldn't even keep a straight face. I even purchased the audiobook, which was read by her, and it was even better than the book. Tina Fey is one of the funniest women comedians of our time.
B003XSSR4W|5.0|The other day when my original \\"Straight Up\\" 8 track tape (no I'm not kidding) got eaten by my 8 track player, I was beside myself, this was always one of my favorites.  A log of old \\"albums\\" are no longer made with the same songs as the originals, even though they don't change the names and many old albums are not even available, all you can find is the \\"best of\\" set.  Not only does this contain all the original tracks, digitally remastered, but they have added bonus tracks.  The original tracks are even more amazing than the original 8 track version and the bonus track are an added gift.  This is a must have for anyone of every had an 8 track tape deck, or wondered what one was.  No classic rock collection is complete without it.
B00632HWOG|5.0|its so easy to check my email daily, and I love it! easy access to read and delete mail, not to mention taking me to the other web sites as needed.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|I can watch all of my videos from Itunes, and dvds on my kindle fire from where ever I want! It's pretty awesome, and is well worth the .99$
1594744475|5.0|There are so many fun ideas to do for kids. They also provide a detailed list of tools that you may need/want to have to help you make the things in the book.   It is not just pictures of the Bento's they have made they provide recipes as well as directions on how to make the items.
B005HSL626|5.0|This game is addictive! Great fun for both adults and children alike. I love the fact that you can change your blade and the background. I've been playing this game for quite a while now (I've unlocked every background and all but two blades) and still haven't found myself bored of it. My favorite mode is Arcade. Try it out, you'll love it. :)
0439023483|3.0|While I cannot stand the Twilight books - I am not a huge fan of the Hunger Games books, either. I do not think the books were well written, I do not feel that most of the characters were developed, and I think the author dove into heavy subjects with little regard to the general YA audience. An example of this that comes to mind is how the author does not deal with morality the same from character to character and while, at 25 I understand the book is fiction, a young adult will certainly have problems. I hope that all parents that see their children reading these books will read them to be able to discuss the topics with them.  I also did not like Katniss. I did not find her as a strong character (given, no one can portray a weak female lead as Stephanie Meyer does, \\"oh Edward, oh Edward - I cannot live without you!\\"). I did, however, love Peeta but I feel as if his character was not developed well, at all. I felt as if I barely knew him and it might be because it was written in present tense.  Part of my negative analysis might have to do with the hype, that I expected too much. I have a feeling that my undying love for Lois Lowry's The Giver (a YA book that I read yearly) and Huxley's Brave New World (along with Orwell's 1984) has to do with my negative opinion. I am extremely interested in topics relating to a future society and I feel as if the Hunger Games left some gaping holes and could not hold up to these classics. (Gaping hole - you really want me to believe they'd have the ability to do invisible hovercrafts but not install better surveillance?)
B001UV4XI8|3.0|after long awaiting to watch this movie I found out that it was not quite as good as I expected. The movie is way over hyped but it is watchable.
B001AP11L6|5.0|Brilliant CD that rocks the daylights out of you. Enjoying every moment of it since it came. Super music and speedy delivery. Thanks so much, again!
B005FMZWD8|5.0|This is a big watch. I just opened my Christmas early! I couldn't be more satisfied with the aesthetics of this big piece of jewelry, yes this is more than a watch.  I haven't owned this watch very long to determine the performance or durability but everything works great.  It has some weight which may indicate quality materials. I have the black strap with leather backing and silver case with blue dial...so hard. This is a mans man watch.
B005F8CL1S|5.0|Of course, my first complaint is that set us not a complete discography with additional, never-before-released songs, etc.  but with the forthcoming release of \\"Old Ideas\\" it would just not be complete now would it?  Aside from that this is a brilliant collection which mimics all of the vinyl releases of the albums but in CD format.  The mastering of the CDs is as sound as their original cd release.  Some of the remastered re-releases have alternate takes of some songs as wellas additional tracks but those who might take a purist approach this is a great compendium.<br /><br />For those new to Leonard Cohen this is an inexpensive investment into the musical world of Leonard Cohen.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|Very good movies! Good plot, action, but the quality could be better idk it maybe that my TV isn't good with night scenes. Get this movie it's worth it!
B0042U94UQ|5.0|both my girls love this movie and at $7.99 it was cheaper than walmart 3 bucks plus no tax so even more savings and no lines to wait in
B0052UZIFA|1.0|not playable on ics on galaxy nexus.  would think such a popular game would have strong development behind it....guess not.
B006C45MRE|4.0|Combining genres is not easy and often results in corny, pretentious and contrived \\"works of art\\".  One might think that mixing Western and Sci-Fi topics would be a recipe for disaster yet this well done film manages to pull it off. Excellent acting, scenography, cinematography; exquisitely detailed representations of aliens and their technology; innovative mix of characters that include cattle ranchers, townspeople, Chiricahua Apaches, alien saviours & gold-digging \\"demons\\" from other planets. A touch of the spiritual with a peyote-like ceremony; the film also teaches an effective method for stopping one's mind.<br /><br />Attention to detail is everywhere. From the cursory flick of the camera to Indian scalps on frontiersman's saddle at the beginning of the film, to the intricate design of the \\"arm-laser gun\\" and the space ship. The amazing Western landscapes (Escalante?) had my undivided attention. I liked how the director played with genre cliches, always using a light touch and a sense of humor. This is the XXIst century's answer to the often dark and surreal 'comedies of the absurd'; to Bunuel, Burroughs and Monthy Python - and I have to say I much prefer CAAs to The Exterminating Angel.<br /><br />In other words, this is a well done, produced and directed film that works from a  weak script .  For us, it brought great visuals and an entertaining  couple of hours.  Can't go wrong on this one.
0071762345|5.0|I just finished 'Likeable social media' by Dave Kerpen and I have to say what a great book. The book gave a refreshing look at social media and a new perspective about the future of marketing and public relations.  The book gives an overall review of both content strategy and the 'rules of engagement' for social media (more specifically Facebook). Dave Kerpen gives some fresh ideas on how to be more 'likeable' on Facebook. The thought behind this is that your Facebook community is looking to connect with you in an authentic way and they are not simply there to digest the traditional broadcast messages that are characteristic of traditional media.   Kerpen does a great job taking the reader step by step through the connecting process. He adds an additional appendix at the end of the book to review the current social media tools and how best to use them. The book was well researched. It took me a while to read because of the all great examples in the book that I constantly looked up.  The book was enjoyable to read and had really great insight.
B005WY8YZW|1.0|This is not the actual CD, this is a CD-R on demand made by amazon that only resembles the actual CD on the low resolution copy of the cover. The insert is simply a track listing and the cd has none of the original artwork, if you just want an inferior quality copy to play in your car, then this will work for you, if you want an actual copy of this CD, go someplace beside Amazon. Highly disappointed. Honestly it looked like something you would buy from a Chinese bootlegger, I had to double check when I got it in the mail to see if I bought it from a 3rd party who sent a bootlegged copy, but to my surprise I ordered it from Amazon who put about as much effort into this reproduction as a 3rd grader doing a finger painting. I'll never buy another CD off Amazon again.
0385344325|5.0|As usual, Jack Reacher the character is suspensful, realistic and educational. I cant get enough. My husband (who is a stud) and I both love this series and he's pryor military . Lee Child does a great job and does his research very well. I would recommend anything with the Jack Reacher character
B005K2YRVG|1.0|I received the timbuk2 envelope sleeve, sku# 631364507692, today.  It looks and feels tough.  The only problem is that it is about 1/4-1/2in to small for my kindle with the keyboard.  It fits the kindle touch.  It states on the label: \\"Designed to fit Kindle (and 6\\" eReaders).\\"
B005JZBP8W|3.0|I would like to add another issue about mixing information about DVDs and Blu-rays.  I also want to know how the extra features on Blu-rays and DVDs differ.  This will help me decide whether to order the Blu-ray as I don't wan't to buy it if it doesn't have all the extra features that I have on my DVD for a particular movie.  This is really annoying!
B005K2XRYE|5.0|I noticed there really wasn't much of a selection of Kindle Fire cases, and this one was pretty cheap.  When it came I was impressed that the product was sturdy and my Kindle fit really nicely in it.  Not to mention it easily slips in and out of the case.  The Gunmetal/White/Robin colors are very nice also!
B005HSL626|5.0|Very fun and additive, gotten popular so that they made a game on Xbox for it.  Yep...it is very fun, played it, just remember don't hit the bombs....
0425241505|5.0|I read about 2-3 books a week, so I tend to run out of material.  I searched the word dragon and downloaded several samples from different authors.  I bought the book, after reading the sample, and it just kept getting better and better.  The characters came alive and I laughed out loud at their antics.  I highly recommend this book and am off to purchase the rest of the series.
0300169787|3.0|This is a decent catalog and it might be good for people who never saw the museum show, but it is no substitute.
B0043URV5U|5.0|It may be his old songs, but, the sound is unbelievable. I haven't stopped listening to it yet. Great album. It was received fast and in perfect shape.
B0053YGYO4|5.0|LOVE this CD.  My opinion:  this is their best effort since \\"Parachutes\\" first turned my head several years ago.  The sound is layered, rich, and a rainbow of melodies/harmonies.  Every song is a gem.  If you're a Coldplay fan, grab a copy of this CD.  Even if you're not (yet) a fan, grab one.... you won't regret it.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I love this app , use it on the go it is awesome,like having my kindle even when I don\\"t ,readers dream come true.
B004HW7JMO|5.0|I recieved my order promptly and had no problems. I love the Spartacus series and I purchased the 1st season last year thru Amazon also.
0439023521|5.0|This is the first series that both my son (age 11) and I (age 36) enjoyed.  He  finished all three books in less than a week.  I thought for him to put down the video games and read for a week straight, these MUST be good books!  I started them shortly after and to my shock I couldn't put them down!  Now we can't wait for the movie!
0786956291|1.0|This kit is no replacement for the real handbooks.  The information is scattered about making it impossible to know how to set up a character or start a game.  You're better off finding someone who knows how to play.  Or assume that you'll need to have the handbooks too.  The claim that this kit has everything you need is flat out a lie.
B004H7QICG|4.0|The P183 is top-rated for those looking to build a silent PC with plenty of room for performance components.  Excellent sound dampening, ventilation and cable management.  Pair it up with the CP-850 power supply.  After putting the work getting all my cables routed and tucked cleanly inside the case, I encounter Antec's vision for a USB3 front-panel connector...the other side of this cable needs to be routed out the back from the lower part of the case and into one of the rear *external* USB3 connectors.  To me that was a complete head-scratcher: Antec targets the silence and functionally-obsessed, and offers this completely separate model of the P183 specifically with a front-panel USB3, yet goes rookie with a cable mouse-tail out the back of the case and over all my audio/video connectors, taking up one of ony two rear USB3's, while the motherboard's header lies unused.  The offending cable will interfere for the life of my case. A bit of a speechless moment right there...like Beethoven ending a great Symphony with loud flatulence.  There's some gizmo from a different company that can be purchased to convert the internal USB header into the external kind and somehow keep this cable inside but c'mon.
B00007E8O5|5.0|I loved \\"Boggy Depot\\" so I figured I'd give \\"Degradation Trip\\" Volumes 1 and 2 a try. Wow, Mr. Cantrell certainly didn't disappoint me with these two outstanding CD's.  Without a question, DT is a bit heavier than Boggy but hey, that's right up my alley. Sure, some songs are stronger than others but the overall product is awesome.  If you loved Alice in Chains, you'll love the \\"Trips\\". Thanks, Jerry, for many hours of listening pleasure.
B002GZQY6Q|2.0|Bought The Incident when it first came out.  I gave it a few spins and was unimpressed.  But, as with other PT cd's, I knew it would likely take time to grow on me (was not a big fan of FOABP when I first listened, love it now.)  After a couple of years and a few more listens, and after seeing PT play the whole thing live, I'm still not a fan.  I guess the thing that bothers me the most is the muddy production.  Also, the minute-and-a-half songs.    Now, the included EP I like.  It's produced much brighter, and I like the songs better.  I have every PT disc and some bootlegs, too...The Incident just never gets played.
B004K4AVAG|5.0|UNBELIEVABLE!!! This cd is amazing. I am def a little monster - Every song has a good beat and a true artistic nature behind it. Nowadays, you don't see many artists writing their own music and every song was written by Lady Gaga. I am not sure why some other's didn't like this album but to each their own. This, by far, is my favorite Lady Gaga album. If you love Lady Gaga's upbeat, dancy, and DIFFERENT nature.....this album is for you!<br />Happy shopping!!
B005K17RU0|1.0|very limited and confusing interface. just wanted to have it refresh network connection automatically, but it would not do anything other the typical android app....  no quit or restart etc. menu lacking tools etc
B004EBZX6W|5.0|This app provide S/N ratio for all the Wifi network. And it is very good to show each wifi source has been S/N. It really helps a lot.
B0013FSL3E|1.0|the DVD arrived. but the package was damaged. Is a Christmas gift. and I send the package back once because it was damaged. the same DVD. I see that doing DVD's with amazon may not be a good thing. No time to send it back before Christmas. May send it back anyway.
B0059XTUVI|4.0|I saw The Iron Lady right before it was widely released, and felt that expectations that Meryl Streep's performance would be incredible were fully justified.  Having seen her in many roles, this was not surprising--she's widely regarded as one of the greatest living actresses--but her transformation here into an elderly woman, including the accent, the makeup, the attitudes and personality, is nothing short of astonishing.  Thatcher's very conservative politics and abrasive manner are of course very controversial--and this portrayal of them is very timely.  To be sure, if you're very sympathetic to Thatcher's politics, you may find this portrayal of her unsympathetic or even offensive; some clearly have. But regardless of the viewer's politics, I can't imagine anyone watching this and not feeling he or she has seen something remarkable.<br /><br />The story of Thatcher's life is told through a series of flashbacks experienced by the woman long after she left office as the British prime minister with the longest tenure of the 20th century, and its first woman PM.  We see how she entered politics, met her husband, rose to power, earned the Iron Lady nickname, and was pushed from office by her own party.  For those unfamiliar with her life and politics, it's educational, at least superficially.  An attempt is made to deviate from the straightforward biopic format by having Thatcher's mind failing during her old age, resulting in hallucinations about her deceased husband punctuating the film.  This device is effective, but still, this is not a great film. It's a not-quite-conventional movie about the life of one historical figure, made interesting primarily by Streep's stunning ability to inhabit her subject, and thereby not only cause us to appreciate Streep's art, but also feel at least a little compassion for an aging woman no longer in power.
B004BSIJ9Q|5.0|I don't think Kanye will make an album as great as this album, coming off an off year from that controversial Taylor Swift VMA's moment. He came back with fire. Every song from beginning to end is a 5 out of 5 star song. This album was surprisingly better than Graduation. All Kanye West albums are great, but this one had a very mature sound for him as an artists. This album deserved at least an Album of the Year Grammy nomination, it was snubbed.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|I loved this game on my iPhone so I bought it for my Galaxy Nexus.  It locks up after it starts. Probably ICS system update is in order for this game.
B005JLN9ZI|5.0|The album was more together than Thank Me Later although Thank Me Later songs individually were better. No track on Take Care really stands out like Thank Me Later. Thank Me Later sounding like a greatest hits cd compared to Take Care, Take Care was an album. The production Take Care sounded uniform through the whole probably probably cause Noah 40 Shebib produced practically every track
B0063IH60K|5.0|Good for passing time whether at work or you just have nothing to do. Simple and ready to use. Great app!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|An awesome app that works flawlessly and smoothly. I love it. The Bible selection is broad. The multitude of reading plans is very nice. Best of all it is free!
030726999X|5.0|Hated to get to the end of the book.  Kept me guessing from start to finish.  Too bad there will be no more.
B0063IH60K|5.0|if you enjoy playing Klondike solitaire you'll surely love this version.  Unlimited undos, one click/tap card placement and very intuitive.  Hints work well if you're stuck and if you get on a losing streak just deal a &quot;Winning Hand&quot; to renew your confidence.
1594744769|5.0|I am not an avid reader but I enjoy a good book. My 11 year old and I found this one at a book fair for her and she started reading it. She noticed some bad language and I decided to read it first. I absolutely could not put it down. I loved it! There is some bad language and adult saying that she will hopefully not understand but I am going to let her read it. She is a very good reader, better than me and really enjoys books. I think she will love this one. My sister, who LOVES to read is borrowing it first. Any suggestions on more books like this for my 11 year old?
B001BWQVSG|5.0|The cost of this marvelous collection of Argerich's work is unbelievable.  As other reviewers have stated this is a fantastic set of great recordings that were hitherto only available on vinyl or as single CDs.  I found her Schumann and Chopin works exceptional.  The quality of the recordings is good.  My only cavil is that there is no booklet included so as to give one some history of the recordings.  But after listening to just the Bach CD I forgave this shortcoming instantly.  Needless to say the music here is beautiful and Martha Argerich's interpretation is awe inspiring.<br /><br />I am so glad I bought this set especially since I am taking an online course in 'music interpretation'.  Excellent value, excellent music, excellent musicianship.  Very highly recommended.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Great game. It's free and fun to play. People that are complaining about a free game need to go \\"occupy\\" songs bs city and shut up.
B00127RAJY|3.0|This DVD is very popular. There are lots of very high impact moves like jumping jacks. If you are not in very good shape, be careful and don't hurt yourself. Take it at your own pace and don't let Jillian bully you into injuring yourself. The warm up and cool downs are very short and I feel inadequate for what she has you doing, but it is only a 20 minute session so I understand why they are so short.  I used the DVD's 1st phase workout for about 1.5 weeks, every other day. I followed the \\"beginners modifications\\" for the moves, but there aren't very many offered. Mostly she just says stuff like \\"No modification for this move! If you're looking for a modified jumping jack you're not going to find it here!\\" During the first week it hurt my back quite a bit, but I thought I'd tough it out. By the end of the 2nd week my back completely seized up and I was layed up for a solid two weeks before I could even walk without severe discomfort.   You can shut her voice off. That is a nice feature.  I MAY try to do the workout again when I'm in better shape because I do like the idea of circuit-type training, and I already spent the 10 bucks on this one. I'll just shut her voice off and be much more careful.
0802798225|4.0|I read this book in a day.  I had just come off reading another love story and was trying to relive the awesomeness of that book.  I didn't quite get all that awesomeness again but I did feel really good and satisfied after reading this book.  I wasn't too enthused with the whole gang member stuff that was Alex, but it made for some good suspense.  This book was way more than a love story; it was about the characters Alex and Brittany being able to discover their true selves and not be ashamed of it.  Alex and Brittany together enabled each other to not be afraid of who they really were.  They didn't have to hide their true selves when they were with each other and in the end it helped them become better people.  I personally didn't connect to these characters as much as I usually do but perhaps it was because I read it really really fast.  One of my favorite parts of the book was the Epilogue.  I had read in another review that they didn't like it; but I thought it was fun and it made me really happpy.  I would love to see the author expand more on the Epilogue and perhaps write a whole other book on it.  Although I did have trouble connecting to the characters, I really enjoyed this book and it made me really happy while reading it.  I really enjoy when authors alternate POVs, I really enjoy being able to have insight to more than one character.  I will be reading the next two books in the series, possibly starting the second book today.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Excellent App with an outstanding UI . The Organization of documents beats the PC. version by far. Download it and enjoy the cloud.
B005DOKK7Q|5.0|Before I bought it, I read many reviews saying that it smells.  I'm not sure what people were smelling besides the new smell of items which is not the greatest odor but absolutly normal.   It works great for me and I sure recommend it.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|Have not used it but it arrived on time and the packaging looks good. Looking forward to seeing what it does
B005I6EU7U|5.0|I was so excited when i recieved my tan cover. I ordered it on Dec 7th and it said it would be sometime in Jan or Feb for delivery. The red was in stock but the tan was taking longer to ship for some reason. I guess it was really popular. But I did get it way before expected and it is so beautiful. It looks like a vintage book. Its so soft and classy and it does fit the kindle fire.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|I'm a big Harry Potter fan, so this box set is perfect. I definitely had a Potter-thon the day it came. They're movies that I can watch over and over without getting tired of them. I like how compact the box is. In fact, I wish all my favorite movie series came like this.
B0055V6EZE|5.0|I am not a big Blues fan, but love House and Hugh Laurie.  Wonderful music and well done as this from a non-Jazz and Blues fan.
B004OBQQPY|5.0|This is a great movie. Well made and I enjoyed watching it. It sort of carries you into this amazing world of Ayrton's racing life in a beautiful way. The soundtrack is amazing too and matches this great movie.<br /><br />If you watch it on a morning, your whole day will go thinking about it. It moves you in a way hard to describe.<br /><br />This movie is a must watch for all.
B001KVZ6FW|5.0|this movie is one of the best ive seen... ever!  it is thoughtfull, creative, and extremely well done and beautiful to watch.  I love that there is nothing offensive in it at all and its not the usual characters; it shows the journey of two people who start out as young children.  they meet and grow up together, get married, have a life, and grow old together.  the elderly man from that relationship is the main charector in this CHILDRENS film!  finally a film brings the relevance of the older generation back to the youth!  so much focus is placed on children \\"playing\\", and - face it - in movies the \\"older generation\\" is either boring or villains.  the older gentleman and a young boy unwillingly partner up for a great adventure, learn to bridge the gap between their ages, and discover that they can identify with one another and become friends.   I would recommend this movie to ANYONE and honestly believe you are missing out if you DONT see it!
B0052UZIFA|2.0|This is a terrific game, but it freezes on the Samsung Galaxy Nexus.  It makes it very frustrating to play.
B002BWP49M|5.0|By far this was the best Twilight movie. I loved it! I saw it twice. It was funny, sad and exciting. I believe it was true to the book. I would even have to go as far as to say it was better than the book. I thought the sex scene would be horrible because it was PG-13 ( and I am 34) but they did a great job at capturing what needed to be captured and did it in a tasteful way. Pattinson is adorable! Stewart did an outstanding job! I cant wait to get my DVD copy!
B005ZUR724|5.0|Was not expecting much at all.  I was amazed. Huge download on the front end but so worth it. Great graphics, fun multiplayer and the controls are actually useable.  I had no issues downloading or playing. Just make sure you are on a decent connection because it is not some puny little 30meg download.  only complaint I have is I can play for 3 months then there is a monthly fee. wtf???!! they should be a little more upfront about the eventual subscription. If I wanted that I would WOW it on pc. otherwise this is a great game. hell I think its the only mmo on kindle. And no this is not one of those retarded trying-to-pass-it-off-as-an-mmorpg Facebook b.s. games like Mafia wars or that vampire one.  the real deal here.  I bought it for $6.99 and its well worth it. I see its now. 99cents. you have no excuse for not getting it.

B003V40SGS|5.0|Going through my movie collection recently, I found the 1979 Disney movie The Black Hole and decided to watch it. For those who may not know it, Disney currently has plans to remake The Black Hole with \\"Tron: Legacy\\" director Joseph Kosinski in charge of the project. If you watched Tron: Legacy, during the beginning of the film in young Sam Flynn's bedroom you will notice on the wall a movie poster for the original Black Hole movie. They were giving us all a sly wink, nod and glimpse of things to come.<br /><br />While out on a deep space exploration mission, the USS Palomino discovers a black hole. If this discovery wasn't fantastic enough, they also discover a huge spaceship that sits precariously within reach of the gravitational forces of the black hole on it's outskirts, yet sits unaffected and motionless without disturbance. The Palomino crew decides to take a closer look at this ship that they soon find out is the missing USS Cygnus, which is another exploratory ship that was thought to be long ago lost decades earlier. The Cygnus seems to be dark and derelict but upon closer inspection, the ship is found to contain lifeforms aboard it. The crew of the Palomino docks their craft and investigates the Cygnus and soon are amazed to find that a Doctor by the name of Hans Reinhardt, played by Maximilian Schell, is still living aboard the ship, along with many robots that he has created to help keep the ship's vital functions operating. Reinhardt claims that the rest of the crew returned to Earth long ago while he stayed onboard the Cygnus to conduct studies and learn more about the black hole.<br /><br />Dr. Reinhardt who seems more than a little megalomaniacal, has plans to fly directly into the black hole. The Palomino crew is shocked by this admission, but one crewmember by the name of Alex Durant, played by Anthony Perkins, wishes to accompany the Dr. on this fantastic journey.<br /><br />Will Dr. Reinhardt travel into the black hole, and if so, what will he discover? For the answer to that, you will just have to watch the movie.<br /><br />The Black Hole has always been a favorite movie of mine because it is a film that makes you feel like you are right there, in a fantastic situation, deep in outer space, on the brink of total destruction with no help from anyone to come and save you. You can feel the eeriness, the desperation, and fascination of what it would be like if you actually were on a vessel in deep space all alone with just a small crew of explorers in the vast unknown far reaches of outer space.<br /><br />The film does have its fair share of cheesy moments here and there though, namely with the scenes involving its answer to the Star Wars movies popular droids, R2-D2 and C-3PO; this one features silly robots named V.I.N.C.E.N.T and old B.O.B., the Cygnus' maintenace robots.<br /><br />And while some of the special effects may seem rather outdated by todays standards, they are still very effective at conveying feelings of loneliness and desolation when it comes to the black hole itself, as the Cygnus floats precariously on its outer fringes.<br /><br />You've also gotta admire the awesome and menacing threat of Dr. Reinhardt's lead robot, the very intimidating Maximillian--probably the most scariest robot ever put to celluloid, and certainly one of the most memorable.<br /><br />The Black Hole is a movie that I find myself going back to time and time again, and I look forward to seeing what the upcoming remake has in store for us when it is finally released by Disney.iscover?

B000B8L6LI|5.0|For theprice, you cannot beat it. If you had more money to spend on it, I would go with the diamond hones, but for $20 its great. Its compact enough to take with you anywhere. I am in scouts and I take it on campouts and charge people $2 to sharpen their knives, and I have made my money back in it. puts a nice edge on the blades that holds for quite awhile, even for as brutal as I am on my knives.
1419702238|5.0|My son (11) loves all the books but I have to say this one is much better than the last one. I was chuckling through the whole thing as we read together.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Using this on my Kindle Fire.  Love it! Very nicely laid out and works smoothly with the slightest touch. It's my &quot;go to&quot; game whenever I have a free moment.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|I was so worried for Bella when the pillows got torn apart. But it all turned out great. Also worried when the birth scene happened, again, all clear! Nice happy ending in the little cottage and I felt soo better.  Also a big fan of Marja healy, as are others passing around the HYPNOTIC link.  Paperback or .99 ebook...[[ASIN:B005M55UGM HYPNOTIC, a teen vampire romance]].    If you love Mrs. Meyers, check it out.
B0063IH60K|4.0|this is easy to play. I like the options of difficulty. I also like the tap feature instead of dragging cards across the screen.
0061743526|5.0|At the December 2011 meeting, a very nice sized group met at the NYC LGBT Center to discuss \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" by Harper Lee.<br /><br />We had a dozen readers (but no new members, which surprised me) to discuss \\"To Kill a Mockingbird.\\" About half the group had read the book before (usually in high school) and about half had seen the movie in the past few years. We originally put the book on the list because I read that it was often viewed as a lesbian coming of age story - but it didn't pan out that way.<br /><br />Everyone either liked the book a lot or loved it. Everyone was clearly charmed by the language and the story. There was some discussion about how Scout expressed herself - can any child be that smart? General agreement was that the novel is actually in three parts: (1) Scout's growing up with her brother Jem and Dill (Truman Capote in real life); (2) Atticus' trial and its aftermath, and (3) life in a small Southern town with Aunt Alexandra and various neighbors (including Boo \\"Arthur\\" Radley). While the novel centers around Atticus' defense of the clearly innocent Tom Robinson, two episodic minor events stand out in the narrative: a snow day in Alabama and Atticus shooting a mad dog. But the three sections of the novel melt together like a confection during a hot Southern summer so that they cannot be separated.<br /><br />I think that the book is full of new-found and evolving sexual knowledge as Scout learns to act (but not necessarily be) a woman. I persuaded absolutely no one that Scout is a gender-variant young woman (lesbian? FTM transgender youth? butch transvestite?) coming of age in a traditional setting that could not quite accept her difference but loved her anyway. (I think that Atticus' unmarried brother, Jack, is also gay, which Atticus recognizes and serves as another reason why he goes so easy on Scout's tomboy ways.)<br /><br />This a charming book with little gay content (but it's there- look for it) and plenty of character and excellent writing for young or mature readers.cellent writing for young or mature readers.
B004LWZWEC|5.0|Excellent item quality!!! Fast shipping! Well packaged! I was really surprised by seeing this item coming in so early! It was labeled as \\"used\\", where you can see some small bumps on the black tin box. Regardless, what it is most important is the discs' quality! They look brand-new! Thank you for a great 5-star service!
B000J5XS3C|4.0|This mixer is lightweight, easy to use, has a NICE EQ, and no extra noise coming through! I love ponies, so I make tons of pony remixes using this, and when I play songs like \\"Rainbow Dash Loves Girls\\" by Renard, or \\"Flutterwonder\\" by PinkiePieSwear; NO SOUND! Great for live shows in my experience. If you want more inputs: try getting the larger models! This is a great bundle for only ~$45. Definitely recommend.
1584233494|5.0|Not much to add that previous reviews haven't already covered. This was purchased as a gift and the recipient loved it. I do as well actually. There's a lot of really great art in this book. End of story.
B005URRCNQ|5.0|I have been a fan of the black keys since 2004 and have seen them 6 times live.... i love all of their albums in their own right with attack and release being my least favorite although it is still well made... truth of the matter is that el camino is their BEST album from start to finish by far... now, that being said i must vent to some of those who call themselves fans of the black keys but have a problem with this album and the fact that brian burton helped produce it... this album is not over produced, it is well made with tight sounds and great flow, sorry that you are too much of a hipster to realize this... i too laugh when someone asks me if i have heard the black keys then proceed to tell me thefirst album they heard of them was brothers only because they have been putting out great music for soo long before... i freaking love the big come up just love it... but there is no possible way if you have a good ear for music can tell me honestly that it is a better made album than el camino sorry you are allowing your ego to get in the way... FACE IT the black keys are becoming popular and you too now like a \\"POP\\" band, that is what the term pop stems from remember years ago the beatles were \\"pop\\"... the black keys are the best band of my generation and el camino is an awesome freaking album period
B0036IGJ1C|5.0|I saw the halmark hall of fame movie of the same title.  So I ordered the book. I loved both.  The book does a masterful job of strengthening your faith without being preachy.
1612680011|4.0|This book has its flaws, but it delivers a strong message and makes you think in a whole new way.  It gives a brand new perspective on investing that most people have never considered -- which is pretty much right on the money.  The only drawback is that it doesn't go into specifics, and just makes you want to buy the rest of his series of books... can't really fault him for that though.
B004O3YGMC|1.0|Would not install. Thanks splashtop and amazon, kick rocks. No refund button? I will never spend money in amazon's app store again.
B0034G4P9E|5.0|Warrior has to be one of the best fighting action packed movie I have seen in a real long time. I like the sibling rivalry and how the story unfolded. The plot was well organized and it is like nothing you would expect. Great movie!
B005OCFGTO|5.0|At last: the whole she bang in one box. A marvellous experience to see the characters grow as the actors age, follow the story from a children's book to real adultworth stuff. Wonderful to see the development of CGI over the years. Most of all in a mere eight evenings the whole story so you won't loose track
B004NELBPC|1.0|if you want a roadmap to a socialist society this is it.  they left loons are ruining this great nation.
B005HSG3U6|3.0|This cover should work -- it's not my favorite but my favorite is out of stock.  If you're just ordering/receiving a Kindle Fire you definitely need a cover--protect the screen!  This fits well, and looks as if it will work.  Shipped quickly; packed well.  Good communications from shipper.  The usual good customer support from Amazon.

B004LWZVZC|4.0|It was a contagious film that drew the fantasy and the reality closer together in each scene until the ghastly finale.  Were they guilty?  Prpobably.  Did they receive a fair trial?  Certainly not.  Should they have been afforded their civil rights?  Most certainly!rights
B005FVFWOI|4.0|I'd been reading about the 40th anniversary release of Tull's Aqualung for a while, and, while I couldn't afford to get the whole kit and kaboodle (including surround sound digital copies on Blu Ray and on re-mixed vinyl - sorry kids, we have to eat macaroni and cheese for two weeks... Dad's gotta feed his classic rock habit) I had heard great stuff even about the Redbook CD release of the re-mastered work.  And it is great. I have the old Mobile Fidelity Sound Labs re-mastered disk on vinyl and while that certainly sounds great, it's always felt like there was something lacking. Just a certain oomph, especially on Martin Barre's guitar parts and, interestingly, on some of Ian Anderson's vocal work.  Not any more. Barre's guitar and Anderson's voice have been brought much more up front, and are now more in your face. It's like they raised the levels on these parts to the point where they were over-saturated, and then backed them down just a bit.  Even though I just have the Redbook CD version, it's been beautifully re-maixed. The recording stands up nicely, especially at loud volumes (and is there really any other way to listen to Locomotive Breath or Cross-Eyed Mary?). Really loud volumes. When I run things in stereo, I bi-amp and bi-wire my main speakers and put 130 watts to the tweeters and mid-ranges each, and another 130 watts to each of the woofers... and another 600 watts to my subwoofer. I can run my system pretty loud without the sound breaking up. And this recording is amazing at very high levels.   When Anderson starts jamming on his flute, all those funky grunts he does as he grabs a fresh breath... it's like he's right in the room with you (I know, I know, I know; it's a terrible cliche). You feel the body of the guitar on Barre's acoustic guitar parts. The impact of the bass has a much more visceral presence.  My only beef is with the \\"extras\\" disk. It's not really all that interesting. It might be if you're a serious devotee of Tull, but I look at itthis way: I'd've bought the disk without the extras, and they're kind of a nice little bonus, but without the love and care that went into the re-mastering of the main disk, they just aren't all that interesting. To me anyways.  Now if I didn't feel like such a guilty fossil when I listen to it. Though, to be fair, there's no real sense that this is music from the early 70s. I suppose that the biggest reason this makes me feel like a dinosaur is because I've heard the album, or at least certain tracks off it, so many times that it feels like a very comfortable, well-made pair of shoes.
B005HSL626|4.0|A great game with excellent graphics and accurate controls! Highly recommend to anyone. Really don't care for the OpenFeint multiplayer system though.
B0052UZIFA|2.0|this is a great game but out always crashes it is so annoying I expect an app that it's higher priced to perform better than this. it is frustrating to the point you just stop playing out. Samsung epic touch.
B002NZK5TG|5.0|This movie is a classic, funny, awesome musical for anyone who likes musicals!  Yes its kind of cheesy and corny but most musicals are that way and thats part of the charm!
0452287022|5.0|Girl With a Pearl Earring is the fictionalized story behind the girl in Johannes Vermeer's famous painting with the same title. Very little is known about Vermeer's real life and no one knows who the real Girl With a Pearl Earring is so most all of the plot is from Tracy Chevalier's imagination.<br /><br />Sixteen year old Griet is from a poor Protestant family living in 1660s Holland. She goes to work as a housekeeper for the Vermeer family so she can help contribute to her family's dire financial situation. The work is hard and the days are long. Because of her attention to detail, Griet is given the job of cleaning Vermeer's studio and leaving everything in exactly the same place it was before she cleaned. This makes Vermeer's wife jealous - she's not even allowed in the studio because she is so clumsy.<br /><br />I could not put this book down. Griet is a great character. She is strong but recognizes the limitations of being a woman in the 17th century. She's smart enough to work with the social confines of her situation to survive and thrive. The relationship between Vermeer and Griet was complex, at times it seemed like a parent/child dynamic and other times it seemed to have more romantic tension. The author did a great job of putting the reader right in the middle of Delft, the town in Holland where the story takes place. I highly recommend this book.

B000T433CO|3.0|I found it cute and entertaining.  Maybe I was in the right mood, but it was enjoyable.  Especially for $.99.  A good underlying holiday message to not sit around and complain about your life.  If there were half stars, I would have given it 3 and a half.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|Love this cover. It is extremely light weight but offers great protection (I've dropped my kindle twice, no damage).  Doesn't use up any extra room in my bags.  I can prop my kindle up on a desk, but it isn't incredibly sturdy in that position, however since I'm not pounding on it it works fine for me.
B0040UAYI4|3.0|I got this product last week and I like it; but not love it. It has some problems with slower DPi mouses. I am using a Mouse with 800DPi on it, which does not help with aiming at all. It is near imposable to make small adjustments with this DPi.   Getting a Logitech G500 Mouse with 5,000PDi this week. If it improves the aiming I will have to give this product 4 stars and not 5. Reason being is that I didnt know this product was going to be a $127.00 investment (Had to get new Keyboard and mouse)   Just keep this in mind when buying this....Make sure you have a Gaming mouse and not a cheep laser mouse; or you will be really disappointed.
B005KDWUFA|5.0|This is the most powerful album of all 5 efforts.  If you love the voices of Carlos and David, then this album shows their magnificent voices and range.  While I love every song on every album, this album is my favorite.  Amazing Grace, Don't Cry for Me Argentina, Time to Say Goodbye, and all the others are purely magnificent and show the true quality of all their voices.  I have introduced Il Divo to all my friends without one complaint...just the opposite.  Being a lover of the baritone and tenor voices, this album is beyond awe inspiring.  Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful...and keeps me asking for more and more from them!
B001UV4XHY|5.0|This was and it a great movie! I bought the wrong one, I was supposed to get part 2. I did not have a problem keeping this for myself and watching it all over again! Thanks!

Occasionally there was a drag for me, or a device that I wondered about,but he really does an amazing job of keeping all the \\"strings\\" going.  I don't want to spoiler anything,but I will say that the ending...my one agenda with King..is completely satisfying to me.  yay,steve.
B004EPYZT4|5.0|The video arrived in great shape. Thanks for sending it so promptly. Amazon continues to be the number<br />one source for shopping on the internet.
B0068AWQQ2|5.0|Maybe the jaded horror fan wouldn't like it, but I thought it had just enough scare without the disgusting gorefest. And, it's funny :)
B004V5QWU2|2.0|Do not buy - HUGE gaps as EVERY sound loops. Yes it has a lot of sounds, but only a few would be any good for sleep. If you try to use this, all your brain can focus on is when the next loop gap is coming. It's like Chinese water torture! At least with Relax and Sleep you can select way more than 3 sounds and you can control the volume of each sound individually. Relax's interface is much better and much easier to use. Wish I could delete this and get a refund.  :(
0307279189|5.0|\\" There's something so universal about the sensation, the way running unites our two most primal impulses: fear and pleasure. We run when we're scared, we run when we're ecstatic, we run away from our problems and run around for a good time.\\"  So says Christopher McDougall, author of Born to Run.  This may have been the most entertaining and inspiring book I read all year.  In fact, soon after I finished I ran a half marathon barefoot, with very little barefoot experience prior.  Odds are this book  - many times while you are reading it - will inspire you to go out and run, maybe even in minimal or no footwear.   I wasn't sure what to expect with this book.  Many people had asked me about it or recommended it since they knew I had an interest in barefoot and minimal footwear running.  Indeed I am. Interestingly, my journey there was not via this book. It was largely through doing my own research and talking to others who knew a bit about the activity.  So I finally read the book when a gracious friend allowed me to borrow it.    I can hardly give a high recommendation.  You will learn about anatomy, human history, a hidden tribe in the Copper Canyon, and some pretty amazing (and crazy) characters who run ultra-marathons.  The book is a page turner from page one. McDougall begins with his original frustration of doctors telling him he couldn't run due to injuries.  Hence begins his quest to see if that was really true.  Incidentally, people can run hundreds of miles nonstop with very little or no footwear.  And it's our foot wear (and by extension posture and form) that happens to be causing all the running injuries you're hearing about.  A fascinating read. Do make an effort to put this on your lest and get a chapter a day. It'll be hard for you to do less than that.
B0053VKP8S|5.0|I purchased this along with a \\"2 x RCA Male / 1 x 3.5mm Stereo Female, Y-Cable, 6 inch\\" and a \\"RiteAV Digital Optical Toslink Cable 6ft\\" because my TV(in the bedroom) speakers were barely adequate. I already had a Creative Labs 2.1 powered speaker set that I haved owned for years as my computer speakers. Since I have my living room computer hooked up to my HD TV and surround system now, I don't use the speaker set anymore. I didn't want to spend $200 on a digital soundbar. My Toshiba 40E21OU only has an audio optical out so I needed a converter and the 2 cables. TV optical to Converter, RCA male/3.5 mm out of Converter to Creative labs speaker system. I had to change the audio setting on my Toshiba from 'Dolby Digital' to 'PCM'. It worked GREAT!! All for only $32. The tv and audio is in perfect sync. The only flaw is that the volume on the tv does not control the speaker system. I have to adjust the volume on the speaker set. It comes with a 6 foot cord that I place in front of the tv. I set the volume and leave it at that. The volume on the TV itself isn't that bad, but sometimes you just want a little more bass pulsing sound.
B0044KU7KU|3.0|i have to say i was a little dissapointed when this albume came out. even though their first three albumes were different from each other they were still dark. danger days on the other hand is totaly different. thought just because its happier doesnt mean its bad. some songs like na na na, bulletproof heart,the only hope for me is you, sing, and save yourself ill hold em back are great songs and i like them as much as i like some of the songs on their other albumes. but the rest of them? eh, not so much, parts of planetary go that arent goofey are good, i just dont like party poision, destroyas alright at best, the kids from yesterday, scarecrow and sumertime sound too alike. vampire money is too generic for me. its okay but i feel like its not the best way to end the albume. i didnt realy hate any of those songs but they just dont have anything special about them.the wole albume felt like it was missing that solid, edgy, chaotic, emotional feel. because there were enough songs on it i loved i didnt hate this albume but there were enough songs that felt boring or cheesy to me that i dont love it either. well thats what i have to say about that. oh and sorry for any spelling errors. its late and im tired.
0763644765|5.0|My daughter is not quite ready for the potty yet but I saw this book and thought it would be good to get her at least familiar with the idea.  This book is adorable and definitely seems like a good starter.
B001UV4XIS|2.0|okay i had a few major problems with this film that completly ruined the movie. i dont understand how pert 2 could have nailed it and pert 2 just seemed lazy. first off i dont care if the movie isnt exactly the same as the book.i didnt think twice about how we didnt hear any background storys about dumbledores family or little things like that that could go with out. id change parts too if i were making a movie. but in this case there were parts i just found unforgivable. the first thing ill talk about was how belletrix died. in the book she had a normal death. the movie on the other hand was just weak. mollys tripping over he own feet then out of nowhere she just makes belletrix all skiiney and frozen and then blows her to a million cgi looking pieces. that was ridickuless looking. then there was nevels \\"big moment\\" this is one change i couldnt stand. in the book he shows more b@wlzs then steve martin at a syfi convention and then pulls the sword out of the hat, kills the snake and shocks the world by it. in the movie hes not doing anything. hes just standing there like herp derp and the hats like \\"eh, why not kid. heres the sword of gryffindor. go get 'em\\". then at his moment he pulls out the sword and harry steals the spot light. he ends up killing the snake in front of ron and hermoine. ill admit i kinda liked how the snake fought with voldemort at the end but cmon. it would have been a thousand times better if that one scene followed the book. another peeve i had with the movie was how when harry was reveald to be dead in the forest it skips the death eaters reaction. i was looking foreward to that scene of all the death eaters cheering and possible hagrids emotional moment. but i suppose that scene wasnt all that important...i guess. all those could have been over looked if it werent for my biggest issue. this i dont understand one bit nor do i understand how anyone could have found it to be a good ending with out this scene. wtf, was up with no reaction to voldemorts death? are you people who gave this movie 5 stars realy happy with out that? harry kills voldemort, everyones moody in the great hall. sure you can argue that thats more realistic cause alot of people died. but theres no argueing that thats a better way to end it then the actaul epic, joyful, reaction we get in the book. i left the theater speachless that it ended with not a soul seeing harry beat voldemort (spare for maby a few sillhouettes in the background, big whoop)nor even caring that he was dead. the most we got was a wink from mrs weasly and a hug from hagrid. everyone else seemed like they didnt even care. the dark lord was dead and everythings back to normal! i wanted to yell at them to be happy!or at least look at harry like a hero. no i couldnt believe the director ended things like that and nobody seemed to even care that that was left out. i could have made a better ending then that. the whole series led up to that one point and the lest amount of time was actualy spent and making that scene look goo. we got more of a reaction from cedrics death. if anyone can explain how this movie was good with out that id love to hear it.

B001CQ67Z8|5.0|Just discovered this genre of music and loving it.  I'm 53 but find that this music provides great energy working in my art studio.  I'm collecting other works by this artist and E.S.

B004I2K4DY|5.0|I had this video on my Wish List, and received it for Xmas this year. I'd seen it on PBS and knew I wanted to own it. It brings out an emotional reaction to me each time I watch it. The reunion at the end of the original cast from 1985 with the current ones in 2010, and singing their songs together, brought tears to my eyes. This is worth watching over and over, and you really get your money's worth.
B0063GORYU|5.0|love it! I'm losing sleep because I have to WIN. I play way too much and can't put it down.
B0002F6BRE|5.0|I love this movie.  My wife loves this movie.  We watch this movie at anytime during the year because it is so funny.  Will Farrell pulls off the naive, sheltered adult so well.  The part when he first gets to New York City is amazing. James Caan is a great schmuck.  He plays an executive that only cares about money and advancing his career.  Zooey Deschanel is very strong in her role as the love interest.  She accepts Buddy for who he is and doesn't question the fact that he's essentially a giant 5 y/o (which works in this context).<br /><br />There are some things in this movie that are a little inappropriate for small children.  Consider yourself warned.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|It works great on the kindle fire...  It has: 1. Decent graphics 2. Unobtrusive advertisements 3. Various styles of levels 4. Various difficulty levels Definitely worth the money ;-)

B002KAOSEW|4.0|Nothing to Lose by Lee Child is another in the Reacher series.  I have read over half the series, but not all.  After looking over the reviews I was left wondering what the other reviewers wanted that I had obviously not missed at all.  The story was pure Reacher.  He's hitch hiking across the country and stops for a cup of coffee between the towns of Hope and Despair.  The people ignore him, then try to beat him up (big mistake), then the sheriff steps in and dumps him back at Hope's county line.  So Reacher asks around and still can't make sense of what happened.  He sneaks back to Despair and takes a good look at the metal recycling plant that employs the town.  That doesn't make sense either.  The place has more security than the president.  Staying away from the road on his way back to Hope, he encounters a body, which disappears.  And that doesn't make sense.  Every time Reacher thinks he's about to grasp what's going on, it slips away and that only makes him more determined to satisfy his curiosity.  Taken together none of it makes sense, but then Reacher starts looking at the pieces instead of the puzzle.  I like stories when I can't figure out the ending and I like series to have the main character, keep to character and the situations to change.  Not the other way around.  Reacher is a favorite of mine because he can be dropped anywhere, with only his toothbrush and still take control of any situation he encounters.  Loved the story.
B000001ES9|5.0|By 1974 when Rush released their self-titled debut, they had been playing for quite a bit of time together. Geddy Lee, Alex Lifeson and John Rutsey were then a very promising Canadian act which had already built a strong following.   The eight tracks on the album are all very well crafted with a rawer, bluesy edge not found anywhere on their subsequent releases. Although Neil Peart was soon to come into the fold and genuinely help elevate Rush to the stratosphere of rock, this self-produced 1st album has its charm and that alone is worth the price of admission. 'RUSH' is the very foundation for everything that came after and the elements which are so recognizable to their sound are already very much in place - Geddy Lee and Alex Lifeson truly shine here and you can sense all their full potential beginning to blossom from the great opener 'Finding My Way' on to 'Take A Friend', 'Here Again', 'What You're Doing' and, of course, 'Working Man'. 'Before And After is also interesting with that long intro build-up while 'Need Some Love' and 'In The Mood' are excellent rockers that only confirm what a distinctive voice Geddy Lee brought forward into rock.  There are quite a lot of reissues of this album so it's kinda hard to suggest one but, if you're not that picky, the 1997 Rush Remasters should do the job nicely.
0553801473|5.0|In my opinion, people who didn't enjoy this book simply aren't a fan of Martin. It seems the biggest problem is the creation of alternate story lines and focusing most of the book on what happens away from Kings Landing. That is actually what I enjoy most about Martin's books. He creates an entire world with so many intricate pieces and doesn't focus on one single small area.<br /><br />I have absolutely no problems with this book as a setup, and it was necessary to the overall plot of the series. I enjoyed most of the additional characters introduced in this book and Martin created some good cliffhangers for the Winds of Winter. After A Game of Thrones, this may be my favorite of the series.
B005I0BR0E|5.0|I JUST LOVE THE MUSIC AND VOCALS OF HER SONGS, I CAN LISTEN OVER AND OVER AGAIN. JUST LOVE RIHANNA'S MUSIC
B005MYEQ4U|5.0|This movie isn't what I expected when I saw it for the first time, it was actually much better than anticipated. I was assuming it would be just another stupid, generic romantic comedy but it turned out to be SO much more. It's really more accurate to call this an experience rather than a movie, because it just envelops you from beginning to end- much like the movie's plot itself. It's truly magical though and is now on my list of favorite movies. I truly enjoyed it and can watch it over and over again without getting sick of it. Plus- great soundtrack and generally just a really good time. Highly recommend it!!!
030788743X|4.0|Okay if you like 70s D&D and Rush and 80s video games and pop culture, this book is your crack. This is a really good book! I don't know if I can give a 100% spoiler free review so read at your own risk: there is a huge puzzle in a virtual reality world with the whole world as the prize, and to crack the code the people and corporations of the future are immersing themselves in the singular creator's passions, which are all completely retro - Dungeons and Dragons, Trash 80 text only games, 80s movies, etc. I liked the CHARACTERS even if they were broadly drawn. I liked the bad guys, they always surprised me with how evil they could get while very much resembling the constantly-excused corporate overlords of today. The near future world of energy crisis and indentured servitude to corporations for unpaid debts was one of my favorite parts of the book. And while you're reading, it'll all fly by and you'll love every word. Until after the book. The biggest problem I have is this massive puzzle, built by a genius, which took five years to get a crack in the armor, then devolved into a fairly 'easy' scavenger hunt. I guessed at the first clue for the first key before the main character did. I like books where I am amazed at how smart the author is and he's always 10 steps ahead of me, but I didn't feel like that with the puzzle aspect of this book. That is a quibble, nitpicking for sure, because the experience of reading was great. 4 stars.
B00656C6KK|5.0|Doris Day is the type of person one could write about endlessly. She embodies so many of the qualities we as humans should honor and strive for: compassion, goodness, sincerity, caring, integrity...but the list goes on and on. And, that's not even talking about her artistic capabilities and accomplishments which most of us \\"baby boomers\\" are quite familiar with.   This newly released recording was sent to me by my dear friend Bob who knows how much I love Doris and how much I appreciate all she has done for us with her music and for our very best friends, dogs, with her animal foundation. Listening to \\"My Heart\\" is truly a great joy anytime of the year but most especially at Christmas time. It is a reminder of all that was good and full of \\"heart\\" when we were all growing up in the 50's...and, every single song is performed flawlessly in Doris' unmistakably beautiful voice and inimitable style. I would rate this CD as one of her most beautiful collections of songs ever.   Listen to \\"Life is just a bowl of cherries\\" and let all your cares slip away this holiday season!
B004EPYZSK|4.0|I enjoyed this film although I had hoped it would be much better. The concept is original and I'm surprised it hasn't been done before (that I know of). All of the cast are very good and the special effects are excellent too. Overall it's a good film but it probably could have been a lot more fun with a slightly better plot.
B005K17RU0|4.0|Love this app just wish I could see the high for the current day not just the current temp. Love the up to date video forecast.though. It does give the in depth daily forecast.
1401924751|5.0|I love these cards. I've never seen anything like them. They give your insite to your life's purpose;  what you should do; what your talents are.
0060873027|3.0|Maybe we should let sleeping authors lie (dead authors too).  This is a book that should have never been finished.  That's not saying that Richard Preston is not a talented author in his own right - but this book seemed weak and silly from the start.<br /><br />A group of young scientists go to Hawaii as guests of a central casting type villain so diabolical and over the top he could only be played by Dr. Smith of the old Lost in Space series. The company is Nanigen MicroTechnologies that specializes in shrinking folks down to half an inch.  In this diminutive state, it turns out, people can run, jump and hit a lot faster, higher, harder than in their original state.  The problem is that there is about a 3 to 4 day life expectancy for these pocket sized science students.<br /><br />The hot squeeze of \\"Dr. Smith\\" saves the students one minute only to dump them in the wilds the next minute.  From here they have to find their way back to the laboratory where it turns out there may possibly be a little bitty control panel that will allow them to un-shrink themselves.  On the journey back they run into all manner of creepy crawlies and we are treated to ghoulish descriptions of the encounters.<br /><br />I listened to the audio book and the narrator was top rate and I'll even give him extra points for not giggling at some of the more ridiculous parts.  It's not a bad book but should be left until after a natural disaster when your choices of reading material wind down to a residual few.
B005ARYEPK|5.0|So excited to receive this dvd and what memories of the eighties it brought back! Such a feel good movie! Item as described with rapid shipment! Thanks

B003NTMREM|4.0|Really liked this first episode- sets up an interesting world with good characters and fun sci-fi stuff.  A nice starter, as it makes you want to see more of this series.
006016848X|1.0|Bad science, bad book. Not something I'd recommend to any couple.<br />John Gray seems like a gullible man at best, and a conniving scammer at worst.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I admit I was skeptical of reading [[ASIN:B002MQYOFW The Hunger Games]]. I heard they were Young Adult (YA) books, children's books, teen books, etc. It kind of turned me off from reading it.   I started a chapter here or there, then put it down for a few months because I was so busy with life.   Then I picked it up one night after I saw the movie trailer for The Hunger Games--Holy crap.   Now I HAD to read the books because the trailer convinced me it looked good! (Yes...I'm that shallow).   So I pick up my [[ASIN:B005890G8O Kindle Touch 3G, Free 3G + Wi-Fi, 6\\" E Ink Display - includes Special Offers & Sponsored Screensavers]] and begin reading.   O-M-G.  I LOVED IT.  I couldn't stop reading! I read it in 3 or 4 days, and that's including a VERY busy work schedule!   Just the names that the author used in [[ASIN:B002MQYOFW The Hunger Games]] were so unique.   Peeta. Prim. Katniss. Gale. Rue.   They're fun names--easy to remember and unique enough to stand out.  The way the author created her world was handled very well. The book is VERY well written for a YA novel.   I'm a picky reader and I was impressed.   I also love how the author doesn't give us a year (at least I don't remember one) to go by for the Dystopian world, and leaves it to our imagination.  I pictured Capitol as the only futuristic city left in \\"Panem,\\" and someone else I talked to said they pictured it as an upscale downtown metropolitan area.  So the world is described well, but still leaves room for plenty of imagination.   I devoured this book. It's has so much substance and uniqueness. There are some brutal and sad scenes--and kissing--won't spoil anything...so I would recommend this for kids 12 and up. This would be at least PG-13 in theaters.  Definitely give [[ASIN:B002MQYOFW The Hunger Games]] a chance! It's a Dystopian sci-fi adventure!   Note for Kindle Edition:  1) Great format--it's perfect!  2) Includes page numbers & location.  3) Table of Contents included.  4) No errors (I could notfind any or notice any).
B00004TS0E|1.0|D as a gift - we opened it last night to watch it and it doesn't work.  It stops for no reason, then skips back to the 'loading' phase at the very beginning. Very disappointing.  Can I exchange it for another one that hopefully will play?
0061474347|5.0|I read this book before I was in high school, and every time I reread it, I promise myself to someday read it again! In my opinion, this is the best of Garth Nix's Abhorsen trilogy books, but all are extremely well-written and amazing! The world Garth Nix creates in this book is very complex and interesting, and the plot and characters presented throughout the book are stunningly developed and authentic. This is a rare find among fantasy fiction!
B003O86FMW|5.0|I am a new fan of The Hunger Games and I've been so drawn into the story that I bought the 2nd and third book as soon as I finished the first. I have no regrets! I saw comments about the pacing of the book but I did not feel that it was necessarily a slow read. Collins whets the appetite just enough that it'll be difficult to put this book down once started.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|I truly enjoyed this movie. It is important to note that you should take the story for what it is and view it as a fictional peice of work. Thinking too hard into any sort of controversy or nonfictional comparisons will ruin your enjoyment. Just relax and enjoy!
0061969656|4.0|\\"I would kill them instead.\\"<br /><br />This according to narrator Uhtred of Bebbanburg as the action picks up in this the sixth of Bernard Cornwell's Saxon Tales.<br /><br />So what else is new?<br /><br />There's a lot of killing going on, that's for sure.<br /><br />The context is the aftermath of the reign of Alfred the Great, and the maneuvering for power by various factions, both English and Danish.<br /><br />Cornwell is, as always, the weaver of a captivating historical story. He's particularly adept at bringing to life the battle scenes and describing the brutality of medieval conflict.<br /><br />I wish, however, that his quest for a sense of historical authenticity would not extend to the use of period place and other names. What is gained by calling Nottingham, Snotengaham, or referring to Dorset as Thornsaeta? It quickly gets confusing, especially given that a sense of the local geography is necessary to sort out much of the strategy of the various battles and other action.<br /><br />The characters are similarly complexified, as the reader must differentiate between the likes of Aethelred, Aethelflaed, Aelfadell, Aethelwold, Aethelstan, Aethelnoth, and others.<br /><br />My feeling is that this use of period names makes the book feel less authentic rather than more, as it is juxtaposed with thoroughly modern dialogue and narration.<br /><br />Nevertheless, it's an enjoyable book and I'm looking forward to the next in the series, sure to come out in another couple of years.
B0053Q9DHW|4.0|I liked the film for the freshness of its interpretation. Mia W. was brilliant in the role of Jane. This version for me highlighted the fact that this is not just a story of hardship and love, but also a subtle tale of revenge...The cruel Aunt dies of a broken heart after seeing her son, her favourite, waste the family's fortune and then kill himself. In order to avoid the fires off hell she must confess to Jane, hated little Jane, that she lied and connived out of spite. The snotty cousins are humiliated.  Even Rochester gets his comeuppance at the end, when he find himself in reduced circumstances, and blind, and she comes back to him rich, and sure of herself. He did  tease and \\"test\\" poor Jane quite cruelly by exposing her to the charming attentions of Bianca and the other \\"ladies\\", to feelings of jealousy and  hopelessness  which she could not express ..and  she certainly could not retaliate as she was not their equal in their eyes and in the eyes of society.That she felt herself so, was then a rather revolutionary idea, since people were supposed to accept their place, as God decided.   All through the book ( which I read at least 20 times) the theme of retribution is a thin but visible red thread.. re-read it for yourself and see!!Otherwise, if I was the caster, I would have perhaps chosen Jamie Bell as Rochester, the handsome chappie is far too handsome to be credible, in the book he normally has to pay for his pleasures ( Adèle's Mum was not very complimentary about his looks....)
B0069UP2PI|5.0|As a close follower of health news with some background in science reporting, I found this film utterly frightening in its realism.  From a combination of factors - perhaps statistically inevitable, just like a nuclear accident - a new disease emerges.  It is the product of a mix of DNA, bred in a factory farm in Asia by a freak occurrence.  When transmitted, it grows explosively due to modern transportation; unbelievably deadly, it kills up to 30% of those infected.  Their deaths are horrible to witness.  As a result, within a month, modern society suffers a near-complete breakdown, with panic, rising lawlessness, and in the end mayhem.<br /><br />The plot progresses through a number of characters, some normal people, some remarkable public servants, some self-seeking charlatans.  Paltrow is one of the first victims, a strange elimination but also the perfect vehicle to retrace her steps throughout the film.  Damon is her husband, a good man out of work whose life is thrown into painful turmoil and a struggle for survival.  Cottilard, Winslet, and several others are dedicated officials, whose desperate actions form a fascinating quest to contain and then cure the disease; it is good to see bureaucrats portrayed with realistic and deserved respect.  I will not go on as this could spoil the plot.<br /><br />I watched this twice in a row while on an airplane.  It is an important reminder of a possible near-future, but also truly great storytelling.  Recommended with the greatest enthusiasm.  This is hard scifi at its intelligent best.
B005V20JKI|4.0|This game is one of the most fun and addicting I have played, but I have constant issues with it freezing upand lagging. Sometimes I have to pull my battery because I can't quit the frozen app. These issues are especially prevalent on WiFi.
B004LROUW2|5.0|Haruki Murakami's great three volume novel is enjoyable on several levels, in several dimensions. Written in a simple and direct style, the translations seem flawless; the first two volumes are translated by Jay Rubin and the last book by Philip Gabriel. The story is evenly paced throughout the novel, and the reader is not faced with any challenge of getting through one chapter in order to read the more interesting next section. There is good action and insightful character development.<br /><br />The novel can be placed in a number of genres: science fiction, romance, adventure, mystery, religion, and fantasy. The narrative can be described as realism applied to surrealistic accounts of people, events, and environments. The novel reminds me of some of Stephen King's work in which contemporary products, food, living quarters, clothing, and mores are used to make the reader feel comfortable with unusual happenings. Then, as in good surrealist paintings and literature, the reader is surprised by insights into the scenes and characters and gets unexpected glimpses of her own unconscious processes. In this way, Murakami is like the French surrealist writer, Andre Breton, whose characters and situations \\"haunt\\" the reader stretching out her insight from reading to living.<br /><br />The main theme that threads the novel is that there is only one reality, but it takes a free ranging imagination to fully understand it. To reach this literary freedom, Murakami lets his story become independent of a linear view of time. By including Marcel Proust's novel In Search of Lost Time in the 1Q84 story, the author shows that it does not really matter what time/date it is if the present focus of attention is written truly in just enough detail for the reader's imagination to expand beyond the words on the page. The novel's timed events experienced by the characters are independent of sequence and are combined in the consciousness of the reader in many dimensions not just a single time line. The reader is convincingly there and elsewhere at the \\"real time\\" of reading. This can be experienced in reading Proust's writing, and also in Ernest Hemingway's work, particularly The Sun Also Rises.<br /><br />Set in Tokyo, the reader gets a feel for the culture by reading careful realistic descriptions, sensing freedom from time constraints, and awareness of designed omission of explicit connections. As with Breton, Proust, and Hemingway, Murakami allows the reader to understand the behavior, motivation, emotion, morality, and existential philosophy of the characters and the culture they are embedded in with minimalist color strokes. The characters seem to float easily from one dimension to another, from reality to unreality, forward and backward. The locations in Tokyo seem like clean, well-lighted scenes suggesting a Japanese culture of otherworldly refinement.<br /><br />The dominant theme of imagination leading to reality has a larger background content related to George Orwell's novel, 1984. There is a sense of \\"powerlessness,\\" a grand threat of Big Brother, \\"little people\\" always watching and limiting the thoughts and behaviors of the characters. There is also the knowledge the reader has of 1984 actually having occurred, and Orwell's account of the future is now in the reader's past but in 1Q84 characters' present. The reader is comfortable with all of this, setting the stage for many Breton like \\"surprises.\\" As in Anton Chekov's short stories, the reader is taken to places that can only be imagined. Yet, once there, she has very real experiences of personal insight. Life's threats and joys are always with people, but they can understand ways to protect and reinforce themselves and ultimately thrive in reality with imaginative insight.<br /><br />Murakami writes a love story in 1Q84 that involves two people leaving an orderly world of loneliness and reaching for a relationship that exists mostly in imagination. There is a perception that true lovemay not fit long term imaginative scenarios, it may be different. Can it be better in the one and only reality or will it be a disappointment? The characters will never know without the courage to change their points of view and move toward reality with the acceptance and independence of the past allowed by imagination.may not fit long term imaginative scenarios, it may be different.

141694737X|5.0|I got this book for my daughter when she was 3 months old.  Even then we could tell she loved reading it.  The pages don't have too much text and there is a fun flap on every other page that she used to love watching us lift.  Now she is 13 months old and of course can lift the flaps herself.  She still loves it and often giggles when she lifts one of the flaps and finds a different animal underneath. I read it to her at least twice a day.  Its a smaller book and I bring it often in our diaper bag because it is such a favorite.  Its even become one of my go to books for baby showers.  The fact that she reads it that often is something since my daughter has many many books!
B00067BBQE|5.0|the product Evanescence - Anywhere But Home dvd arrived quickly and factory sealed -very pleased would buy from again thanks :)
B005JSM5YW|3.0|Its a slow movie - I only got it because I like Emma Stone, but she doesn't have a big role in the movie. It was an OK movie
B004NJDJYS|5.0|I just finished this book over the weekend and had to sit back for a few minutes to absorb the enormity of the story. This is one of those books that can speak to everyone, regardless of your marital or parental status. The author is a gifted writer with a strong command of language which she uses to tell this amazing story. It's one of the best books I've read in several years.
B004EPYZQ2|4.0|If you liked \\"The Sandlot\\", \\"Stand By Me\\" & \\"Goonies\\" - this is the movie for you cuz this one rolls all 3 of those movies into one.
B003DF4582|5.0|Excellent value considering it was an after thought. Two quality movies on blu ray at such a bargain price how could can I go wrong. That was my reason for the impulse purchase, and I couldn't be happier. Keep it up, the more specials like this the better. Thanks again.
B002ECJZ76|5.0|I just watched this movie & feel like it is such a special story of Santa Claus. The warmth it leaves me with is beyond words. The English over dubbing is off but didn't distract me from the story like some that may have taken a star away just because of that. I suggest you to take this movie in to your holiday season. I know I'm making it a yearly tradition.
B005QBKXOQ|5.0|Wednesday 21st December, an ordinary morning like most have been this week. Morning tasks checked off the TDL, time to check amazon for some new music. Chair squeakingly exciting...Daughtry have a new album out. Suddenly the morning is far from normal. Based in Canada and so unable to purchase online MP3's from Amazon.com, brilliant business model there Amazon. Brilliant. You don't get my % of revenue today then. Course change and glide my magic mouse pointer South to iTunes isle hidden in the dock and it springs into life like a dazzled marmot. Store, search, Daughtry. Break the Spell is there and ready for me to preview (much longer previews than Amazon's clips in any case). Ok I hear myself musing, let's just preview a few and maybe buy 4/5 tracks, the wallet has already taken a few anvil size blows this week with yule approaching. Not a chance in hades. After previewing all tracks, I'm £16 down and it's the best purchase of the festive season as far as I'm concerned.  Another little masterpiece from Chris Daughtry and crew. I have been pretty reasonably excited (enough to distract me from morning Nutella on toast snacks) upon the premise that there may be a Christmas album release from you guys. A genuinely sparkling mix of melodic rock and classic rifts, in the saucepan, with a sumptuously well delivered side of pitch heavenly vocals from the American Idol spawned superstar. It's not better or worse than albums previous because, well, it's pretty pointless to compare albums from an artist. This is a splendid little ripper - you deserve all your successes guys, you made my Christmas and I'm sure a few others.  Dye that beard white and throw on a Santa hat Chrissy, this year, you're my Claus.  D
B002PMV9FG|1.0|The Half-Blood Prince Movie was a HUGE disappointment. It was utter nonsense... *spoiler alert*<br /><br />The whole subway/train thing in the beginning was stupid. To change to that from the important book opening with the Other Minister? It makes no sense and is unrelated to plot...<br /><br />A major negative was the whole Burrow-catches-on-fire-scene. What was that all about? It had nothing at all to do with the plot; it didn't contribute anything! Plus, the movie was called the HALF-BLOOD PRINCE, but where was the book?!! They briefly showed it. The part with the Room of Requirement was wrong, too. Ginny did not accompany Harry there so that he would never find the book again. Actually in the book, Harry went there to hide the book from Snape after the Sectumsempra incident with Malfoy. That was a crucial scene in explaining how Harry finds the diadem of Ravenclaw in the 7th book.<br /><br />& To those who defend that \\"movie's must be adapted,\\" well, J.K. Rowling's books were masterpieces that would have been brilliant left alone. They entirely skipped the battle scene and funeral - two huge chunks of the book's ending. I mean, really -- how can you DO that? The editors could have chosen to delete un-needed scenes, but to get rid of some of the most important ones and to add entirely fake scenes that didn't develop the plot in any way was just plain stupid. The movie gets most its viewers from fans of the BOOKS. It's called HARRY POTTER AND THE HALF-BLOOD PRINCE because it is supposed to represent the BOOK.<br /><br />The whole movie was extremely dark and gloomy - very gray and dull. Instead of trying to be overly artistic, they should have added more color... it was hard to tell when it was day and night. Undeniably the weakest Harry Potter film.
B006FLGBGA|2.0|This is one of those movies that gets your mind hooked onto the plot and you can't wait for the next part of the series. I'm not gonna go into details and ruin the movie for you.... I gave the movie a 2/5 for the Poor quality of the rental. I expected more out of amazon and got quality that you can barely call standard definition. The picture was terribly blocky but was watchable as long as the apes didnt move to far away and look like black blobs..

B004LWZW9C|5.0|I liked Valentine's Day, a film \\"related\\" to this one so I was very excited when I found out that a New Year film would be made too. I just fell in love with it since the beginning, because it's not only about the holidays, it gives an amazing message to all the people.<br />Full of dreams, and maybe sometimes cheesy, \\"New Year's Eve\\" delivers the thing that the movie is made for: light entertainment, but somehow it made my heart melt.<br />The cast was amazing, some plots were strong (Robert DeNiro) and some others weak (Lea Michele/Ashton Kutcher) but the Michelle Pfeiffer story was my favorite one.<br />Anyway, I can't wait to buy this film! If you are reading this review right now go to the movies and watch it, you won't regret. Ignore the professional reviews.
B006FTCH2E|1.0|This film felt like the first draft of a screenplay. There were huge leaps of logic, slow points, weak dialog and even more slow points. Most importantly, it was impossible to connect with either of the main characters, so what could have been an interesting exploration into how they understand and forgive each other becomes a snoozy stare-fest that competes with Drive for 2011's Most Overuse of Staring Award. Did I mention the slow points?<br /><br />There's also a very two-dimensional aspect to the entire setup which may be due to the lack of supporting characters in the film. It's hard to imagine the man as a father because we never get to know what he's like in that role. It's hard to see Brit as an inspired, intelligent student whose life is ruined by drinking and driving (don't do it, kids) because it's all rushed through with exposition. So in the end, it seems more like a play with two people with no real depth or engagement.<br /><br />I'm all for watching thoughtful, introverted movies but this one missed the mark by the mile. If you want existential-done-well, try watching Danny Boyle's Sunshine for an example of how this should have turned out.
1575666286|5.0|This book really goes into depth in laymans terms about a lot of the effects a proper diet has on your health. It over-laps information so that you can understand the connections that are inherant in the body. A wealth of knowledge for the ill and those not wanting to be ill. Bravo!
B004EPYZTE|2.0|Was this the right Conan ? Was what I was thinking throughout this movie. It wasn't terrible, although the thought of a new Conan ( not Arnold ) didn't work for me very well. Every time I heard his name I was looking for someone else. Sorry I guess seeing the original Conan what, some 30 years ago has spoiled me for any future Conan actors. Unless they come up with a incredible movie, which this is not, to clear my mind of the character actor.  The opening scene where the boy Conan gets surrounded by those 4 or 5 invaders and beats them all down and chops off their heads? Yeah, that would of happened in real life, a 10 year old boy destroying 5 invaders by himself. That kind of lost me right there. But I  bought the movie and i'll keep it and watch it again once in a while. But this new Conan movie didn't even come close to beating the original Conan the Barbarian.
B005LJK3AC|1.0|Oh this was bad. Let's just say this. I only paid 99 cents for it and I still felt ripped off. I don't mind bad language when it is used in a way to make the dialogue more humorous, but it was throughout the entire movie which did not make it very funny.

B004UXUUDA|4.0|Ordered the DVD because I totally enjoyed the book.  Though the movie was good, I found it somewhat lacking.  Enjoyed the book a whole lot more but this is probably the case in most \\"books turned into movie\\" scenarios.
B000S1M9LY|5.0|I came dangerously close to not finishing this book the first time I read it.  The plot seemed so amorphous, the characters too psychologically parsimonious...and the title seemed like it was mocking me.  \\"Infinite Jest.\\"  Big joke.  Unfortunately, it seemed like the joke was on me.  It was Wallace's stylistic abilities that kept me going.  This man can write a chapter about a little handicapped girl getting raped and make me laugh...physically laugh...out loud while reading it.  He can make me care about a 29 year old ex-Demerol-and-Percocet junkie who has murdered several people.  Reading David Foster Wallace feels like a sociological murder mystery.  The experience is akin to, say, a citizen of Soviet Russia piecing through hundreds of survivor accounts of the Siberian gulags after a life of relative ideological comfort, and learning that something is profoundly wrong.  People called this book outrageously funny.  It is not funny.  It is sad.  It characterizes the forces that have shaped our society and our world.  It tells us that we are all addicted to something, and that the only way out is addiction to something marginally less harmful in the short term.  The plot does agglutinate into something more centralized after about 400 pages, but this man makes the silences more powerful than the words.  Much is left unexplained by the end of the book, but the good news is that Wallace is one of those rare authors who is better the second go around.  I have now read \\"Infinite Jest\\" six times, and likely will do so continually.      Don't believe me yet?  Okay.  Read the first chapter.  If you've ever experienced depression in your life, place it in that context, and you will start to see it for what it is.  It is an epitaph, a testament, a eulogy of the greatest writer of modern times.      Is it dense in places?  It will seem so at first.  But, bear with it.  This book is the gift that keeps on giving.  And, guess what?  Those of you with Kindles have no excuse not to read it, because you no longer have to flip back and forth between the primary text and footnotes.  You also have a built-in dictionary, so those of you who need to look up some of the words won't have a problem.  5/5.
B006C45MRE|1.0|I think this is one of the worst movies I have purchased in many years.  The plot was poor, and the acting was not up to any of their potential.  The special effects?? Not well done at all.
B005ZHBA9I|3.0|When I was watching Breaking Dawn Part 1 the first time I wanted to have the whole instrumental and a few other songs at that very moment. I was searching, browsing, listening and found Carter Burwell (I'm in love with his music from the very first movie, The Twilight, Bella's Lullaby is really amazing) and when I found Burwell's Love Death Birth I've almost died so happy I was. And I couldn't help myself - I've ordered this soundtrack for myself for Christmas. And I can't say I'm sorry - on the contrary, music is beautiful and everthing, it's just ... I don't know it seems that almost all of 25 song on soundtrack derive from one song - Love Death Birth (and Bella's Lullaby)... which are amazing, so ... Like I said, I'm not dissappointed but maybe I was expecting something new, something that I haven't heard/noticed yet. At least I've finally got A Nova Vida, so cool in two scenes in movie but without picture perhaps little emptier? However, if you noticed music in this movie (and wasn't 100% in the screen), you'll probably like this soundtrack.

Then when I turned 17 I had to have it for my car so I bought the 8 track , they phased out 8 tracks so I bought the cassette . Now there's something called a CD ...bought Aqualung ( and everything else by Tull ) on Cd . Then they came out with a 25th Anniversary 'Digitally Remastered Special Edition ' with an interview and 5 ' bonus ' tracks ..bought it . Then they released Aqualung Live ..hadda get that too . I'll probably wind up buying this just like I bought the anniversary editions of This Was , Stand Up and TAABrick<br />, but where does it end ? ...I mean you know there's going to be a 45th anniversary edition

B005HSG3VK|5.0|I looked into some of the covers they had for it at Best Buy, and just wasn't impressed. The price also wasn't where I wanted it to be. I wanted something sleek that just did the job of protecting my Kindle Fire. I also wanted something that would prop the Kindle Fire up for easier reading and game playing. This was the best of everything and even though the price wasn't quite what I wanted, I caved anyway because I needed something that would protect my KF. I would absolutely recommend this to anyone looking for this type of product. I also love the hot pink color it comes in!

B002ZB26AO|5.0|I read this book prior to Kim Jung Il's death, after a recent trip to South Korea and then China, realizing I did not know much about North Korea.  This book was one of the most eye-opening, life changing stories I have ever read.  We have all heard about the horrors that have occurred during the Holocaust, or Mao's Great Famine- but little is known about what truly goes on in North Korea.  This book was horrifying but beautifully written, and almost impossible to put down.  I tend not to be too much of a non-fiction reader but this book captivated me.  The author does a fabulous job of capturing \\"ordinary\\" lives in North Korea and really makes you feel for the characters in the book.    After hearing the news on Kim Jung Il's death- I strongly encourage ANYONE who is following the news stories to read this book to gain a true understanding of what is happening in North Korea.  This book provides insight that can't be seen elsewhere, that is so hidden from the rest of the world.  This book puts the situation into a whole new perspective.  Many thanks to Demick for writing this.  My heart goes out to the people of North Korea.

1153737566|5.0|Even though this novel was written 164 years ago, there is much in it that still applies today.  Thackeray describes Vanity Fair as \\"a very vain, wicked place, full of all sorts of humbugs and falseness and pretensions.\\"  In this novel Thackeray skewers a world full of endless social climbing and people acting solely out of self interest.  He lets us see what an empty exercise this is as the false friends made one day will easily turn and disavow you the next.  We see the amount of pain that ricochets around when people act soley out of greed and self seeking.  It is this artificial world that emphasizes parties and social status that Thackeray seeks to satirize.<br /><br />When I began to read about the life of Thackeray, I was fascinated to learn of the biographical elements in Vanity Fair.  Thackeray himself fell in love with a married woman named Jane and tried for years to woo her away from her husband.  The character of Dobbins was essentially his alter ego.  Both were described as physically ungainly men with a hesitancy around women.  Thackeray felt Jane's husband was a cold, brutish thug who was unworthy of her.  He wrote many letters to Jane and gave her many gifts in the hope of enlightening her that he was the better man and enticing her to return his affection.  Jane accepted the gifts and the letters, and seemed to encourage him.  She and her husband were not in a good financial situation and at one time Thackeray told them they could move into his house with him.  This did not happen and Thackeray said he later realized it was not a good idea.  Thackeray's infatuation with this woman was going on the whole time he was writing Vanity Fair.  Is it any surprise that there are three characters in the novel named Jane or Janey, and they are some of the few truly good people in the novel?  One biographer of Thackeray stated that he felt Thackeray wrote the novel to Jane in an veiled attempt to convince her to quit her life with her husband and take up with him.  The biographer wrote that it was clear to Jane and the people that knew them both, how the Dobbins and Amelia situation paralleled their own.  Understandably, Jane's husband got fed up with this situation, and had Jane put an end to the relationship three years after the novel was published.  Thackeray said he had by this time realized it was a hopeless cause himself.<br /><br />There are two themes of this novel that have a significant connection to Thackeray's life.  One theme is a son's separation from his mother (both little Rawdon and Georgie) and the second theme is parents who attempt to thwart or sabotage the marriage plans of their children (both the Osbornes and the Crawleys).  When Thackeray's mother was 19 she fell in love with a man that her family felt was not of a suitable status for her to marry.  To thwart the relationship, her grandmother told her that this young man had died and that she must now travel to India with her mother.  The grandmother then told the young man that her granddaughter was no longer interested in him.  The next year Thackeray's mother met Thackeray's father and married him in India.  Thackeray was born the next year.  Four months later, Thackeray's father invited a young man to dinner, and you guessed it, this man was Thackeray's mother's old love.  Conveniently for the newly reacquainted couple, Thackeray's father died four years later from some sort of fever.  Thackeray's mother was then free to marry her former courter.  What proved to be difficult for the young five year old Thackeray was that his mother then sent him away to England to attend a boarding school.  Thackeray wrote that this had a long term traumatic affect on him as the school was quite tyrannical and horrible, and he didn't see his mother again fpr 3 1/2 years.<br /><br />I also found it interesting was that Thackeray was born a gentleman and received an excellent education at Cambridge.  At age 21 he received his inheritance which he then promptlysquandered.  He had extensive gambling losses plus he invested in two newspapers which later proved to be scams.  With these losses, Thackeray learned what it was like to suffer poverty and the accompanying loss of status and esteem from people.  He was said to be resentful of the unfairness of this experience because he felt he essentially was still the same person.  He thus could create this devastating loss of social esteem that Amelia and her family go through.<br /><br />One last biographical note is that Thackeray admitted that the character of Miss Crawley, the wealthy aunt that everyone was trying to ingratiate themselves with in hopes of becoming her heir, was based on his own sharp tongued and snobbish grandmother.  The amusing part is that his grandmother saw herself in the portrait of this character and was flattered.<br /><br />I think that what I liked best about this novel were the witty asides by the narator.  The running commentary he provides on human nature is often insightful and damning.  A couple examples I noted are \\"What a charming reconciler and peacemaker money is\\".  Another is:  \\"If a man has committed a wrong in his life, I don't know any moralist more anxious to point his errors out to the world than his own relations\\".  I also liked the line where Becky says \\"I could have been a good woman if I had 5000 pounds a year\\".  She goes on to say how she could have been have been a good person who sat by the fire, did needlework and inquired about a relative's arthritis.  However, we know that Becky's personality is such that she was far too restless and scheming ever to have lived this life.  This goes along with the anecdote of how Becky would pretend to be knitting a sweater for her son whenever she had company and she wanted to appear to be a contented and caring mother.  The only problem was that she worked on it so little that her son had already far outgrown it.<br /><br />This novel proved to be hugely successful for Thackeray.

B000JMLFLW|5.0|i finnaly decided to read this classic because i have heard so much about it. I absolutly loved it! i didnt think i would enjoy it as much as i did since it was written a long time ago but i have read it 2 times since downloading it!
B0048LPRCS|5.0|This film deserves every ounce of praise it recieves, another opportunity for Gaspar Noe to outdo himself, and he completely goes above and beyond all expectation.  I am a huge fan of the films of his I've seen, \\"I Stand Alone\\" and \\"Irreversible\\" have both been essential additions to my film collection.  This film takes a whole new direction and runs well with a completely unique version of first point of view cinematography.  This film is spaced out, and paced slowly with extended shots of our protagonists' drug induced hallucinations but this is all done with the upmost discretion and artistic taste.  Some might find it pretentious... I find it absolutely necessary to convey the hypnotic allure this timeless film so vividly captures.  Excellent stuff!

B001TW69J4|5.0|I bought Animals As Leaders' second album \\"Weightless\\" first simply because after hearing a snippet on YouTube, I knew something new and exciting was happening, and it was the only CD in the store.  Of course, it didn't take any time to order the debut \\"Animals As Leaders\\", and between the two I'm declaring Tosin Abasi the most exciting, refreshing and innovative guitar genius since Stanley Jordan's revolutionary approach a few decades ago.  He follows in groundbreaking territory that only the greatest players ever achieved, such as Jeff Beck, Hendrix, Eddie Van Halen, Denis d' Amour, aka Piggy from Voivod,  Robert Fripp and the aforementioned Stanley Jordan.  Each of these players broke the rules of guitar playing and moved it into the next level, each building on the previous player's foundations.  Abasi could not have been the master musician he is without these pioneers, but what a leap he has taken.<br />  Animals As Leaders sounds much like jazz fusion but from a different dimension and universe.  The closest comparison, and don't we all have to have one, perhaps is Fredrick Thordendahl, the twisted genius behind Meshuggah, who is probably Abasi's only contemporary at this time.  Weird time signatures abound, and we get some tricky moves that indeed are reminiscent of Meshuggah, but this debut is considerably more melodic and at times more mellow than the follow-up, \\"Weightless\\".  This gives the listener the opportunity to soak up the spacey ambience on one CD and dig the heavy but still mind blowing excursions on \\"Weightless\\".<br />  Creating instrumental music that appeals to non-musicians is not an easy task and only the best with good ears for hooks and melody have ever enjoyed success past a cult level.  As an example, my wife, who is forced to listen to tons of metal and other music I have in my rather large collection, and does so with grace and patience, bless her heart, even perked her ears up at \\"Animals As Leaders\\".  She does not play music and considers most instrumental music boring beyond belief unless it has real hooks.<br />  There aren't enough good things I can say about this amazing talented young man, other than to keep it up and hopefully force some of these heavy metal guitarists who downtune their guitars and only play a few bar chords over and over to either learn how to play or get out of the way.iders most instrumental music boring beyond belief unless it has real hooks.<br />  There aren't enough good things I can say about this amazing talented young man, other than to keep it up and hopefully force some of these heavy metal guitarists who downtune their guitars and only play a few bar chords over and over to either learn how to play or get out of the way.
1852424672|2.0|What is a potentially an incredibly interesting subject was done an injustice by Shriver's writing style. I found it to be self involved, pretentious and frankly hard work. The result of this is that it left me feeling completely disengaged with the characters.   The first half of the book is like swimming through treacle but the second half goes on to redeem itself slightly as the plot picks up the pace.  I persevered with this book as a friend highly recommended it, so as is clear from the division in the reviews placed here I would read a sample before committing to buying.
B004EPYZSK|2.0|There is nothing original or very entertaining in this movie. I've seen those aliens in other movies. They are always slimy. They are technologically advanced, but really stupid and we can easily defeat them. There is always a space ship that has a core which has to be blown up. Of course, wrist weapon is a must, aliens' version of Spiderman weapon. Craig is good for a hero. Ford's face say \\"angry\\" and too tired to walk more than 10 steps.
B004EPYZTE|1.0|...It's just the movie that sucks!! Very, very disappointing movie. I normally don't buy movies without watching them out in theaters or at least renting them, but with this being in my Quik picks section for a dollar off and after reading some of the positive reviews on here, I thought hey, why not. Not even the 3D (which was also bad) could save this film. The first scenes are ok/good. But once Conan comes of age, you may as well hit eject! Do NOT buy this movie for yourself, for your family or for your friends....but I guess it'd be okay to pick up for your enemies!  ;D  p.s. I wish i could give it a negative star review

0439023521|5.0|Like almost everybody on this planet, I've read The Hunger Games trilogy, and if you haven't, you must have been living under a rock or something. I'll admit when I first read them last summer, I was hesitant. The cover looked awesome, the synopsis was sick, so what could it be that had me so worried? I honestly don't remember!  It was forgotten because of the awesomeness that is The Hunger Games.   For those of you who don't know about it, The Hunger Games is based in a world where the only remaining country left is North America. North America has been split up into twelve (it used to be thirteen) districts and the ringmaster is the Capitol where the annual Hunger Games is played. A Hunger Game is when two children (one male, one female), between the ages of twelve and eighteen, are chosen to represent their district by battling other contenders for the title of Victor. It isn't a friendly challenge either. It's a futuristic Gladiator battle to the death...think...Survivor (but to the death) meets Lord of the Flies (but to the death), any relationships should be cut off- how can you kill somebody you care about?  Anyways, Katniss who lives in district twelve has learned that her sister, Prim, has been chosen to battle in the Hunger Games. Being a heroic big sister, Katniss volunteers in Prim's spot, now becoming a contender. The male contender for district 12? Peeta, who Katniss knows for giving her some burned bread for survival (love at first sight). The two are probably going to die. I won't be shocked. All of district twelve's contenders have died except for Haymitch Abernathy who is now a rich drunk who has to mentor both of the contenders. I, for one, found Haymitch to be one of my favorite characters in this whole story, he was funny and came up with the whole 'star-crossed lovers idea'.  The whole beginning of the novel kept up a fun pace, explaining some of the futuristic people and the technology. Some of the people we meet are Katniss's  stylists like Cinna, who invents her girl on fire persona, and the dress that explodes at one point in the story. Cinna, who I imagined for some reason as Jay Manuel from America's Next Top Model, was one of the most down to earth characters in the novel, and I thought of him as more than just a character but an actual person. Just like some of the other contenders, like Rue and Cato, one of the two becomes Katniss's friend while the other will stop at nothing to murder her during the games.  The novel was split into three parts, which I always find cool, and during the middle part they all enter the games where Katniss has a bow as her weapon while everybody else begins murdering each other. Lovely. The details of the games going on was amazing, I could picture Katniss overhearing Peeta talking with the other district contenders, I could imagine the interaction between the contestants, and of course the saddest scene in the whole novel that involved ... let's just say that I bawled my eyes out.  The rest of the novel has Katniss finally acting like a real player in the Hunger Games and the evolvement of Katniss and Peeta...  Do they fall in love? Do they hate each other? Do they not fall in love? I don't know. Well I do, but why would I tell you? Of course there's also Gale who Katniss left back at District twelve...  My one hope  for the film adaption is not to make it like Twilight with the 'team' thing. It's just something that I've been thinking a lot about lately. The novel is about the need for survival that Katniss has, The Hunger Games wasn't about romance, but about how she has to play strategically to survive and live on.  How does it end? With a bombshell... only one can win after all and the Game Makers need a Victor. I'll tell you how it ends... but then again maybe I won't. If you haven't already read The Hunger Games, get on it! The novels get better with time.  I finished them all within a week, and had to wait out in the rain for Mockingjay. That's how good the series was. I waited in the rain on release day. Awesomeness meter= through the roof.

0393064476|4.0|A wonderfully informative book reading like an engrossing detective novel tracing the main \\"character\\" (Lucretius'epic poem) back thousands of years.  Steven Greenblatt is a master of almost prose writing. Articles in New Yorker, The Week & Charlie Rose interview was noted by Amazon and quickly recommended to me. Thank you!
B003YL4LYI|4.0|Not as good as SOS but much better than Clash of Kings. If I could I would rate this at 3.5 but only 4 is available. After the big letdown of a COK this is a bit of a return to old form. There is way too much time with Dany - who is sadly becoming a shadow of her former self - gone is the ascertive leader; she as been replaced by a moppy mothering indecisive lovestruck bore. But I was happy to see some movement in the Wall storyline and Arya storyline.

B004UC4HCG|5.0|I have purchased over 6 Shuttle \\"bare bones\\" kits with ZERO failures of any kind.  Each of my Shuttle barebones systems have been easy to assemple and highly reliable from their initial power on thru years of reliable, cool and quiet operation.  Their styling is also excellent; the black brushed metal finish and from panel hardware reflect quality, good taste and elegant simplicity.  Because Shuttle systems are very compact, quiet and well cooled, reliabilty has always been superb.  They also use 30 to 40% less power than conventional systems.   I have successfully used my Shuttles in the following high usage applications:  - Primary workstation for graphic intensive design use.    I am a marketing exec that happens to create my own Web designs.  - Home Theater PC with absolutely great results.  - International Travel Temporary Office use: While I carry a laptop like everyone else, the compaq size of the Shuttle designs allow me to also take a complete    system with me in order to use it in Client offices in lobger colsulting assignments.    carry a complete system as carry-on.   Highly recommended.  A.W. White  San Francisco, CA.
B005OCFHHK|4.0|Preface: Love,love, LOVE Harry Potter. This was a sweet deal at about 80$, that's 10$ per each blu-ray dvd, which is a steal. Quality was great but on the second disk (HP and the Chamber of secrets) there's about a 7 minute lapse, basically the disk just fast forwards the 7 minutes regardless of what you do. It's not a huge deal, and it's the only problem out of all eight disks so I'm not gonna bother sending it back.

B0012GMVQC|4.0|I am a big Jeff Beck fan and this is one of his most rocking efforts. Terry Bozzio is a great drummer and Tony Hymas and Jeff have done a lot of great music together. They pretty much invented their own style of instrumental rock. Jeff has always managed to sell well and that is due to the music not being complicated or jazzy, it's just rock and roll and I like it. If your a fan of Jeff and have never heard this: Buy it now.  \\"Guitar Shop\\": From the first beat of Terry Bozzio's drums, you know your in for a rock and roll treat. Then we get some great Jeff Beck licks and goofy talking lyrics in the vein of Frank Zappa. Good start to the CD. 4 stars  \\"Savoy\\": Just a simple rock and roll song, played with one of the best drummers in the biz and Mr. Beck. Who needs vocals? 5 stars  \\"Behind the Veil\\": He slows it down a little here, this song is as good as Jeff gets. He makes the guitar sing. 5stars  \\"Big Block\\": Again this is just rock and roll folks and Big Block is heavy. 4 stars  \\"Where Were You\\": I just love this one, man can he make that thing sing. Like a great horn player his guitar carries the song and takes you places. Hymas is excellent on this one as well, setting the background. 5 stars.  \\"Stand On It\\": Back to the hard rock sound of drums and guitar, with Tony setting the background with his keyboards. The guitar and drum sound had to influence the two piece band of today. 4 stars  \\"A Day In The House\\": Don't really like Terry's lame vocals and nothing should have been done. 3 stars  \\"Two Rivers\\": Keyboard dominated song much like his later stuff. Tony and Jeff are great on this one and this is what Jeff Beck is all about. 5 stars  \\"Sling Shot\\": The CD ends like it starts with a Jeff Beck rocker. 4 stars  Summary: A classic rock and roll album with only some lame vocals by Terry Bozzio, who is a great drummer and his presence is really felt throughout the CD. A couple 5 star Beck numbers, some 4 star rockers and one bad tune. All in all a great one for fansof great guitar and drums. You don't need to be a music snob to like it either. This CD rocks. I give it a light 4 stars because of 1 bad song.

B000PMG16U|3.0|These movies will never be as good as the classic movies were. That being said, they are still pretty good. Although I would have done a few things differently. The plot is at times confusing. Episode 1 and 2 plots were not explained well at times and sometimes plots changed from the classic trilogy. Episode 3 had the best plot of the prequels. Episode 1's beginning could have been more clear on why the jedi were there in the first place to investigate. Jar Jar binks was pointless and he largely disappears in episode 2 and 3 which begs the question why was he such a prominent character in episode 1. And Qui-Gon and Darth Maul dieing was just a poor way to end the first movie, after all the movie is named about Darth Maul...<br /><br /> The thing that the movies struggled with was all the random villains that kept appearing and dieing, and I feel that detracted from the plot lines. Darth maul dies. Then in episode 2 count dooku comes in without ever being shown in episode 1. Then jango fett comes in and dies in episode 2. Then count dooku dies in episode 3 and general Grevious comes in, we never saw him in episode 1 or 2 and dies in episode 3. My problem is that the films feel disconnected with each other. In episode 2 I kept wondering who master safadias was... that was never explained well at all. Also in episode 2, Count dooku says that qui-gon was his master. it would have been nice to see qui-gons ghost in the room or something, or at least have qui-gon mention that to obiwan in the previous movie. Also anakins journey to the darkside was not the main part of the movies even though George Lucas said it is. Theres way too much focus on politics and not enough on other important plot lines. Also the death star plans are never elaborated on in episode 2 and are only shown briefly and we never see the emperor even mention the plans in episode 3 yet they are building the death star at the end of the movie... There also wasn't enough focus on anakin and the emperor because of that anakins turn to the darkside in episode 3 feels forced since he just started to interact with him in that episode. Also in the classic trilogy yoda was trainer of obi-wan however in the prequel trilogy count dooku is yodas apprentice...come on George...I love you for creating star wars but come on at least keep your own story lines true to the originals that were made first.<br /><br />Changes I would make<br /><br />-explain the trade federations deal with the emperor better in episode 1<br />-darth maul doesn't die in episode 1<br />-get rid of Jar-Jar<br />-Obi-wan doesn't kill Darth Maul in episode 1(I get how he did it, he used his rage and anger to kill him, a dark side tactic, however the average viewer isn't going to get that since it wasn't explained)<br />- Mention Count Dooku in episode 1<br />-have qui-gon come back in episode 2 and 3 as a force ghost to talk to anakin and obi-wan<br />-talk about the death star plans more in episode 2<br />-flesh out who master safadias was and how he died in episode 2 and explain the deal better regarding the clone army that was set up<br />- focus more on anakins dark side impulse struggle<br />- have anakin interact more with palpatine throughout episode 1 and 2 (felt too forced to have anakin be that loyal to him in just episode 3)<br />-at least mention general grevious in episode 2.<br />-Darth Maul is the one who kills the children jedi. (doesn't make any sense that anakin kills the children, completely ruined his character because no one wants to like a child killer<br />-Obi-wan kills darth maul in episode 3 after Darth maul wipes out the jedi temple.<br />-Obi-wan should find out now that Darth Maul is working for Palpatine<br />-Obi-wan should be the one to warn the Jedi Council rather than Anakin because then after they go to arrest Palpatine anakin will think the jedi are the bad ones trying to overthrow the republic.<br />-anakin never finds out that the emperor gave order 66 to kill the jediand younglings at the jedi temple. (the whole point was that anakin thought the jedi were the ones trying to overthrow the republic; anakin killing the younglings at the jedi temple just didn't make sense)<br />-anakin doesn't find out the empeor is a sith until the end of the movie, yet anakin stays loyal to the emperor to save padmethe ones trying to overthrow the republic; anakin killing the younglings at the jedi temple just didn't make sense)  -anakin doesn't find out the empeor is a sith until the end of the movie, yet anakin stays loyal to the emperor to save padme
B0055SWM08|4.0|I love this game, great puzzles, pretty graphics, soothing music, in all very zen.  The only  reason I didn't give this game 5 stars is that there is no way to \\"save\\" your own spot in the game.

Also, her dancers bought a lot of energy to her overall performance. This dvd is a great buy.

B002H3F7F6|5.0|This is a fabulous album!  I am so disappointed to read all the many negative review's that appear on Amazon.  This is the kind of record that makes you look forward to the cold, wintery weather returning each year.

A classic of our time.

B000PC6Z48|5.0|I bought this movie after having run out of Sergio Leone westerns to watch.  Upon my first viewing, I was amused, but very disappointed in the film.  The picture quality is great.  The sound and dubbing are good by Spaghetti Western standards.  But something just wasn't right.  I moved on and began watching as many other spaghetti westerns as I could get my hands on.  Eventually I stumbled across one of Sergio Corbucci's other films 'The Great Silence'.  I was floored.  I decided to give Django another shot.  When viewed outside the lens of Leone films and measured by it's own merits, Django is a fantastic film, and one of the great Spaghetti Westerns.  It has everything a red blooded man needs in a movie.  It's smart, violent, and slightly cheesy at times (something tells me it's not as bad in italian). And if you are a Quentin Tarantino fan as am I, you'll quickly notice just how much this movie and the genre inspired him.  So, in short, It's no Sergio Leone film... but then again, what is?

Alas, the film betrays its pasting of a new script in about the first 30 minutes to an adaptation of the stage play for the remainder. The sparkle of Smart Talk that began the film is traded for fast-paced action. Smart Talk deployed in the battle of the sexes when two equals clash is famously found in Much Ado's Beatrice and Benedick scenes. Their wordplay is breathtaking. While the villain Prince John darkens that comedy, as a critic noted, no shadow of evil falls on Wilde's masterpiece. His is a unique thing, an artistic farce where talk raises the absurd to \\"a verbal earthly paradise\\" (W H Auden).
B00080DIWE|5.0|I have had mine for about 8 years, and I can't imagine building models without it.  It gives you so many options to hold parts and bodies while spray painting them, and allows you to easily paint from all angles.  The only problem I have had is that the top and base sometimes come apart, and I have taped them together to remove the possibility that I will drop a just-painted part.  Yes, you can make something out of wood and coat-hanger wire that does the same thing, but this is just better and easier, and it will last forever.

B005ISQEF4|2.0|The ending of the movie had an interesting twist and tied up some lose ends making this movie not completely a waste of time. However, between the first hour leaving everything to be desired and the middle being an utterly ridiculous series of events without any real meaning, this movie leaves a lot to be desired. Actors all did a good job portraying what the movie had to offer, the script just offered little. It took me three sittings to get through this one.

B003INBNXO|5.0|I gather from a brief reading of the background of this film that it is quasi-historical in its depiction of the WWII and immediately pre-WWII life of the protagonist of the title--who may be identified as the mentor of Bruce Lee.  Regardless of the degree of fidelity to the life of the historical Ip Man to which this treatment may aspire, to me it is wonderful.  I see this as a work evoking an aristocratic ideal with which we Westerners can identify--and I assume is meaningful to Eastern cultures as well.  The protagonist, born to rank and privilege, devotes himself to the martial arts tradition of southern China (that is, Canton).  Only reluctantly does he allow himself to be drawn into the fray populated by lesser beings--be they thugs and robbers, or the rapacious Japanese occupiers.  He meets each challenge, in turn, with a superior calm--his most severe gesture being that of rolling up his sleeve a few inches.  His reserve, compassion, and graceful dispatching of his opponents evokes an ideal so potent that even high-ranking officers devoted to the fanatical cult of the Japanese Emperor are cowed by the moral victory he achieves in a martial arts duel with an arrogant (though somewhat gallant) Japanese General.

0307959856|4.0|Imagining disturbing events that might have occurred following the conclusion of Jane Austen's 19th century novel, \\"Pride and Prejudice,\\" P.D. James, queen of British mystery, puts her literary talents to work.  In \\"Death Comes to Pemberly,\\" James imagines a dark turn of events following the marriages of three of the five Bennett sisters to husbands of various wealth, position and character.  The result is not only a tribute to Austen's masterpiece but also to authors of early mysteries such as those of Wilkie Collins.  In the woods surrounding Pemberly, the great Derbyshire estate belonging to Mr. Darcy, there are opportunities for mystery and mayhem.    To refresh the reader, James wisely begins with a review of the characters and story of \\"Pride and Prejudice.\\"  The plot of the mystery itself begins on the eve of a grand ball at Pemberly House, hosted by Darcy and his beloved, the former Elizabeth Bennett. They are dining with guests, one of whom, Colonel Fitzwilliam, makes a sudden post-dinner departure, ostensibly to get some \\"nightly exercise.\\"  Meanwhile, a coach carrying the youngest Bennett sister, Lydia, her husband, the rakish Lieutenant Wickham, and his friend, Captain Denny, is making its way to Pemberly to deliver Lydia who will  attend the ball, although without Wickham, who is not received.  Wickham and Denny quarrel, and when Denny bolts into the woods, Wickham pursues him.  After a few minutes, gunshots are heard, and Lydia orders to coachman to drive straight to Pemberly.  Darcy, his brother-in-law, Bingham, and Colonel Fitzwilliam hurry to the woods where they find a body covered in blood.    No more can be said without compromising the mystery of \\"Death Comes to Pemberly.\\"  Some readers may be challenged by the 19th century idioms and vocabulary.  Others may find James's writing convoluted as she deliberately obfuscates the reader with a maze of occurrences and names that are quite confusing to remember.  Nevertheless, for those who appreciate the dark charm of a gothic mystery, this is an enjoyable read.
B0058VW36U|5.0|Wonderful game and terrible update service! After so many complaints about the \\"no update\\" issue, finally an update appears on some amazon costumer's cell phone but still no update on my kindle fire.  Five stars for the game itself but one star withdraw for the terriblly delay of update. Amazon, please take care of your kindle fire users!!We have been waited for almost one month and still no update. That's outrageous.  Update  Finally got an update on Christmas Eve. Be aware, Amazon loves wifi so much so you need wifi for most of your apps.

B005HSG3TC|5.0|This Kindle Fire cover is very nice.  The surface is textured, which makes for easy gripping.  The strap to keep the front cover over your Fire when not in use is easy to use and a nice touch. The material is sturdy and well made.  And I like the black and gray design which makes it look very sleek.  Its a fine product and worth the price.

B0000584V3|1.0|Alright. Where to begin...<br /><br />I very much dislike this Band and album. I paid 15$ for this CD at a music store that was going out of business. I got the deluxe edition with the extra songs and whatnot, because it was recommended to me.<br /><br />A friend, who I thought knew my tastes in music, and whom I thought HAD taste in music, said this band's following was akin to Tool. Said' that they were a very thoughtful, artsy band. \\"As artsy as metal can get\\", they said.<br /><br />This is garbage. The singer is trying to be early slayer, and they are trying to sound like genius, only fall flat on their faces. This is for the metal-geek with too much time on his hands. To compare this band to Tool is a slap in the face.<br /><br />I now have not only a drink rest, but a deluxe edition drink rest, at that. Thanks assholeselfinduced.
B0058VW36U|5.0|I find it ironic that all the 1 star reviews are from people who love the game so much that they are indignant that the Amazon version is a couple weeks outdated. You people don't hurt Amazon with your 1-star reviews, you hurt the developer and reduce the chance that other customers will find this amazingly cute and fun game.
B00015YVD6|1.0|Although the movie worked just fine (I tested it) the packaging of the DVD box itself was horrible.  The cover was wrinkled and crumbled and had half of the protective plastic hanging off of it.  This was a Christmas gift for my husband, but I instead gave it to him early so that if he decided not to keep it, the choice would be his.  He decided that since the movie played well we would keep it.  I don't think anyone should have to receive a gift that looked all wrinkled like that.
B003YGSLDA|5.0|I loved this movie as a kid, and was lamenting that I couldn't find it on tv anymore. Then I realized that I should at least check to see if it was on DVD. When I found it on BluRay, I ordered it right away, and watched it as soon as it arrived. (While wrapping Christmas presents...how perfect!)   Now, as you might imagine, there's not a lot of call for a movie this old to be on BluRay, but I was really happy with the picture and sound quality. The special features are also a lot of fun, and well worth watching. My favorite is the documentary about the making of the movie (did you know they got the Real Santa Claus to play himself in the film?!)

B0034G4P4O|4.0|The Adventures of Tintin was a film I wasn't sure what to think of. Another motion capture CG animated film? Haven't we gotten enough of those from Robert Zemeckis? Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull really soured my opinion of an already faulty foundation known as Steven Spielberg's more recently directed films. However there was an upside: both the outstanding Edgar Wright and writer/director of Attack the Block Joe Cornish contributed to the writing of the film. The cast was also incredible and the film had a reputation amongst critics who had already seen it as being this nonstop action adventure. Tintin sounded like money going into it; BIG money. The final product turns out to be rather good, but isn't quite as spectacular as the hype lets on.<br /><br />You're pretty much thrown into this mystery right from the start. This isn't an origin story. It's a continuation of a character most people either are already familiar with and/or immensely love. Tintin (voiced by Jamie Bell) buys a model ship at an outdoor market known as The Unicorn, but things become strange very quickly. Two men try to obtain the ship from him right after he purchases it: the first one warning him to get rid of it as soon as he can and the other, a man named Ivanovich Sakharine (voiced by Daniel Craig) offering him any price he'd like. Politely declining, Tintin takes the ship home and eventually discovers that something is hidden inside the ship. As a journalist always hungry for a story, Tintin embarks on an incredible adventure accompanied by his dog Snowy and a sea captain named Captain Haddock (voiced by Andy Serkis).<br /><br />The opening credits are amazing. It's traditional 2D animation, so it stands out from the rest of the film. There's this mini mystery solved during the duration of the opening credits. The pace is perfect and it's easily one of the best film openings of the year. You'll probably also notice the incredible score by John Williams right out the gate. It captures the atmosphere of crime and noir films perfectly and makes full use of a wide range of orchestral instruments. It's just an extraordinary score all around.<br /><br />Peter Jackson once described the film's look as \\"photorealistic; the fibers of their clothing, the pores of their skin and each individual hair. They look exactly like real people - but real Herge people!\\" This is a really exceptional quote to fall back on when trying to describe how the film looks. Textures, hair, and the way character's mouths move are all very realistic. Despite sharing motion capture qualities with recent Robert Zemeckis films such as A Christmas Carol, Beowulf, and The Polar Express, Tintin looks better. It could be due to the characters looking more like the actual characters and not the actors who portray them, but Tintin pays ridiculous attention to detail which is probably just as much a blessing as it is a curse.<br /><br />There are two action scenes in the film that are worth the price of admission alone; Captain Haddock's pirate flashback and the motorcycle chase scene. The pirate ship battle makes it seem like the Pirates of the Caribbean films failed miserably at anything remotely resembling action. Tintin has this fantastic use of perspective in that it's dynamic, but it doesn't get too experimental or crazy. It's like you're always in the right place at the right time. You can clearly make out what's going on at all times, which is something Michael Bay isn't able to claim the majority of the time. The motorcycle chase is my favorite of the two since it's nonstop. The pirate scene cuts back and forth between what Haddock is remembering and what's transpiring in the real world. The motorcycle chase is just in your face the entire time, lasts around six minutes, and puts you on the edge of your seat.<br /><br />Tintin does have its shortcomings though. It does feature two of the year's best action scenes, but it also drags quite a bit in the middle. Youget a little bored at times watching Tintin and Haddock be stranded out at sea, stumble through the desert, and Haddock's incessant rambling of never having enough booze. It results in the film feeling longer than it is. There was also a big deal about seeing this on screen. \\"It MUST be seen in 3D,\\" is what we were told. As you can imagine, the 3D isn't really mandatory for enjoying the film. Aside from one scene, I don't recall a huge use of it anyway. A lot of the action was also extremely unrealistic, as well. I know, it's Hollywood, it's Steven Spielberg, you're supposed to already have this suspension of disbelief anyway. If I get to the point where I notice that this couldn't happen in reality though, then I feel like the movie hasn't effectively done its job; not completely anyway. That feeling was almost overbearing at times with Tintin.<br /><br />The Adventures of Tintin does seem to fall a bit short of the painting critics have painted for it, but is still well worth the price of admission. This year has also been an amazing year for movies featuring dogs: The Artist had Jack, Beginners had Arthur, and Tintin has Snowy. Snowy is easily the most entertaining of the three, but he's also the most animated and the most fictional. Tintin may be a bit slow at times, but visually it's freaking spectacular and the score is an easy contender for one of the best of the year. As far as animated films go, it's films like The Adventures of Tintin that movie lovers live for.ddock be stranded out at sea, stumble through the desert, and Haddock's incessant rambling of never having enough booze.

B0063IH60K|1.0|I downloaded this free app for my kindle fire and just as I would suspect it wasn't worth the money I didn't pay to get it. At first the occasional ad in between games was easy to ignore, then the game would randomly pop open my browser and direct me to a full screen trailer for \\"girl with the dragon tattoo.\\" At first I thought it was a fluke or a glitch, then it happened 2 more times; while it seemed random it usually happened when I was moving cards. I do not know if the developers threw in a line of code as a joke or if they are shilling for the movie; either way I'm never playing this version of solitaire again.

0385534639|1.0|I don't understand the people that are giving this book more than 1 star. Honestly is the most poorly written, most underdeveloped book I've ever read. We don't get to know any of the characters, or the plot or anything for that matter. In the end we are left with nothing. I rarely feel this strongly negative about a book but I have to say it's just terrible. The one good attribute is the cover art...I liked that part. The author should pursue other interests as writing is clearly not her forte.

B003Y5HWMW|4.0|Sweeping across a disquieting clockwork map, an epic score swelling in the background, the opening sequence of HBO's Game of Thrones promises viewers another quasi-historical show. Perhaps in the vein of the Tudors or the Borgias - with a bit of the fantastic added for spice. It is HBO, so we are anticipating alot of skin and carnage. But as readers of the book it is adapted from know, Game of Thrones frequently subverts the expected with a vengeance, karma is consistently thwarted, and the best laid plans crumble to dust.<br /><br />Based on A Song of Ice and Fire by George R.R. Martin, Game of Thrones Season 1 closely follows the first installment of that series. Weaving a capacious Dune-like cast of characters into its tapestry and boasting a rich backstory, GoT can be daunting to the uninitiated. But it's quickly apparent this epic is eerily familiar, more modern than medieval in outlook, often painfully so. It is the bastard child of an Arthurian mythology and a realpolitik mindset. The screenplay was adapted by David Benioff* and Dan Weiss, who have been remarkably faithful considering the length of the source material.<br /><br />Set in a land called Westeros, where winters and summers last years and time seems vaguely out of joint, King Robert Baratheon (played by boisterous, scene-chewing Mark Addy - whose mood swings recall Robert Shaw's Henry VIII in A Man for All Seasons) nominally rules over the Seven Kingdoms, a politically divided set of fiefdoms which were once independent realms. Robert led a successful rebellion that overthrew the ancient Targaryen dynasty over a decade ago, and now everyone senses that the throne is potentially up for grabs. With the legitimacy and rule of law the Targaryens enforced gone forever, the realm is choked by those with the money and power to get their way. The Great Houses** have begun scheming to settle old grudges and secure new ambitions. King Robert, perhaps sensing his increasing lack of control, turns to drinking and whoring, hoping his problems will disappear - while his old and feeble assistant, Hand of the King Jon Arryn, tries to maintain some semblance of justice. But when his Hand dies suddenly, Robert is in real trouble.  Realizing he is surrounded by sycophants and enemies, without any true ally, Robert turns to an old friend for help.<br /><br />Can there be any man with a sense of honor and duty left in Westeros? Is anyone interested in the common good anymore? Only one man can save this situation. Lord Eddard Stark of Winterfell, played with icy nobility by Sean Bean, reluctantly accepts the King's commission as new Hand. Bean's Stark is a family man from the hardy northlands, committed to his sense of justice, but tempered with a knowledge of his own past faults. Stark has a loving wife, Catelyn (Michelle Fairley), five children by her. . . and one bastard by another woman. Jon Snow (as he cannot take his father's noble name of Stark) lives among the Starks but is not one of them. Jon (Kit Harington) is given no motherly affection from Catelyn, who reviles him as a symbol of Lord Stark's infidelity. With a chip on his shoulder, and having no place in his father's domain of Winterfell, he casts his eyes further North, to the edge of the world, desperate for glory in the fabled Night's Watch. Jon wants to escape the limbo he feels his low birth has placed him in, and wishes to exceed whatever his father had imagined for him.<br /><br />It is Lord Stark's limited imagination which makes him slow to realize just how bad things have become in the Seven Kingdoms. For the principle blights on the face of the realm are the Queen, played with surprising subtlety by the beautiful Lena Headey, and her rich and unscrupulous family: the Lannisters. Blonde, beautiful, and malevolent, both Queen Cersei and her twin brother Jaime, one of the King's bodyguards, seem primarily interested in the advancement of their own House. Nikolaj Coster-Waldau stars as the unscrupulous, brazen Jaime Lannister. Nicknamed the \\"Kingslayer,\\" Jaime betrayed and assassinated the last Targaryen king, who he had sworn an oath to protect. His honor shredded, Jaime still belongs to the richest family in Westeros, so he can laugh the nickname off and give the world the finger. The twins appear to be the series' main antagonists.<br /><br />The twins' younger brother is a dwarf named Tyrion Lannister (not a traditional fantasy dwarf, rather, a little person), cast brilliantly as Peter Dinklage. Though he is supposed to be hideous, Dinklage's roguish mug is rather handsome. But all is forgiven when he delivers the character's infamous knock out lines, that leave commoner and noble alike tongue-tied. As a dwarf, Tyrion is used to being reviled by most everyone, including his own father - but he has learned to play on people's expectations, speaking truth Cassandra-like when others won't or can't, and is probably one of the few sane men in this insane world. Despite his love of whores and his venomous family, he has a sympathy for the lives of the downtrodden and grotesque, as he is one himself. Peter Dinklage brings the perfect blend of snarkiness, empathy, and potential ruthlessness. Ironically, Tyrion's only real ally in the world is his amoral brother, Jaime the Kingslayer.<br /><br />However, as it turns out, the Kingslayer did not kill all the Targaryens. Across the sea, the proud but penniless Viserys Targaryen (played a bit over the top by Harry Lloyd), survivor of a defunct House, plots to bring it back to power. By marrying his little sister Daenerys (Emilia Clarke) to a Mongol-like warlord, he plans to use this warlord's hordes to invade Westeros, bringing fire and vengeance. But the seemingly meek Daenerys, who has lived her entire life in fear of assassins and the abuse of her brother, is about to show that she too can be strong.<br /><br />Overall the cast is superb, and even manages to bring in quality child actors for the Stark kids (Isaac Hempstead-Wright as woobie Bran Stark comes to mind). Other notable performances: Lena Headey(!), who brings depth to a character she could easily have made into a one-dimensional harpy. She quietly dominates as Cersei Lannister, and brings a regal quality to this femme fatale character. Her cold-fury style is the medieval answer to Double Indemnity's Barbara Stanwyk. Tragically, the Queen has the instincts of a mother but a suspicious, cruel heart. Alfie Allen's Theon Greyjoy is appropriately unctuous as Lord Stark's ward (read: political prisoner) and gets more screen time than the book allows him.  Likely to set up next season where he becomes a more important character. The Greyjoys, incidentally, with their piratical instincts, kraken heraldry, and weird cult of the Drowned God are a pretty obvious homage to Lovecraft. Finally, Aiden Gillen incarnates the indisputably charming, Machiavellian Master of Coin known as Littlefinger.<br /><br />Two issues I had with this beginning season, so far. The first is the fairly flat performance of Sophie Turner as Sansa Stark, who will be a major character in the next season.  She salvages a bit of this in the final episode.  The second is the new relationship dynamic between the king's brother, Renly Baratheon (Gethin Anthony), and Loras Tyrell (Finn Jones), which in the books was much more discreet. It appears to be far more obvious in the televison series. The new focus has made Renly into a reluctant, submissive character, and Loras Tyrell into the dominant instigator of his ambitions. This is a whole new characterization - and although it seems to be working so far, it might be a problem in season 2.<br /><br />Since events in this series occur in many distant environments, the set designers took care to make the locations distinct. I never had trouble immediately discerning which of the three main story arcs was being followed (whether it be the harsh white climes braved by Jon Snow at the Night's Watch, the palmy luxury of the capital city, or the Targaryen's exotic exile in Pentos, and later the grassy plains of the Dothraki). I think the choice to make some episodes center on one sphere of events while ignoring others has mixed results. On the one hand, it helps keep the narrative brisk and uncluttered, but it may leave viewers who've skipped an episode reeling, as they'll have missed a great deal of plot developments. I do appreciate the way that new characters are introduced by defining actions instead of being assigned informed attributes by dialogue, which is often a problem with adapted works. For example, Arya Stark's (Maisie Williams) introduction as a tomboy was deftly done.<br /><br />Despite its reputation, Game of Thrones is not filled with brutality for the sake of giving offense, of being \\"dark\\" or \\"edgy.\\" With Martin, it's all about the delivery of defied expectations, of anti-climax, preceded by build-ups brimming with potential. This bait-and-switch quality pervades his work. His tone is elegiac, but at the same time, ruthlessly realistic.  In the book, one world-weary courtier explained to an ingenue who still believes in chivalry, virtue, and knights in shining armor: \\"Life is not a song, sweet one. You may learn that one day, to your sorrow.\\"  That about sums it up.  The much ballyhooed \\"sexposition\\" scene and other displays of sensuality were notably uncomfortable, but I believe that was part of the point.  It is certainly channeling the novels in this  way.<br /><br />In this world of might makes right, fantasy is robbed of its escapist qualities. Tropes such as the \\"Damsel in Distress,\\" \\"the Rightful King,\\" and the \\"Ancient Prophecy\\" are all ripped apart, and then, miraculously, resurrected in interesting ways. Timeless issues of family, honor, and warfare are addressed, and often with a great deal of dark humor. The violence is HBO, and this is medieval warfare, so the queasy can expect some high octane nightmare fuel. For the rest of us, it's all decapitated horses and eyeball gouging. With magic used sparingly, Game of Thrones creates an air of wonder sometimes more akin to magical realism than fantasy.  This sense of real danger surrounding magic is rare in some of its fantasy cousins, in which spellcraft can become as mundane as picking up the groceries. The idea that the dead still dominate the lives of the living is a recurring theme in the story. Despite their best intentions, everyone is dancing on the strings of the past.

B005EXA8LY|5.0|Disclosure: I haven't been very impressed with what we broadly call \\"popular music\\" in the new millennium. Most of it sounds, to my ears, overproduced, emotionally barren, broken in some fundamental way and, because of all that, pointless.<br /><br />Steven Wilson's \\"Grace for Drowning\\" is such an amazing remedy to that feeling that I just cannot stop listening to it. This is EASILY the best record I have heard in the last decade.<br /><br />I've read a little about Wilson, and one thing he has said is that he's been inspired by some of the music from the 1960s and '70s. I can hear that here, but he's also very much his own man. OK, do I also hear some King Crimson on this wonderful disc? Sure, especially great Crimso stuff such as \\"In the Court of the Crimson King,\\" \\"Starless and Bible Black\\" and \\"Red.\\" It's no coincidence -- Wilson is the guy who's been working on the Crimson 40th Anniversary remixes, and those are pure genius. Dealing with those, I'm sure, has influenced him, but he also applies his own sensibility to that influence. Tough as Crimson was in those days, there's a more modern sheen here, and perhaps a heavier, darker one. There's something very haunting about this record; I wish I could put my finger on it but I can't. Do I also hear some Nine Inch Nails here? Possibly.<br /><br />And the way Wilson has structured this whole thing obviously owes a lot to the \\"concept albums\\" of the late 1960s and early to mid-1970s. These aren't so much songs as they are soundscapes that flow, one into the other, in a very beautiful way. Yet while The Who's \\"Tommy\\" and \\"Quadrophenia\\" aspired to narrative, and Pink Floyd's \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\" and \\"Wish You Were Here\\" both had a dominant theme, Wilson's approach is more open and abstract. The overall mood, in fact, is one of exploration, in my opinion -- exploration of the human soul and the world with which the individual psyche must grapple. As Wilson sings on \\"Deform to Form a Star\\":<br /><br />\\"The way we uncoil<br />Return to the soil<br />Flaws are everything and chaos reigns\\"<br /><br />There's an obvious acceptance of mortality here, and of imperfection, but Wilson delivers these lines with such conviction, and with such soaring musical accompaniment, that the starkness and sadness of the lines is tempered by a sense of awe, and of the majesty of existence.<br /><br />The album is divided into two parts, or suites: \\"Deform To Form A Star\\" features that song plus six others, while \\"Like Dust I Have Cleared From My Eye\\" consists of five pieces. \\"Deform to Form\\" is the more successful or perhaps cohesive of the two; \\"Like Dust\\" rambles a bit, partly because of the 23-minute \\"Raider II.\\" But both elements of the album, when it's all sung and done, astound. This is ambitious, wide-ranging music and poetry that seeks nothing less than the transcendence of the ordinary.<br /><br />I strongly recommend the Blu-ray Audio surround mix. Wilson's superb work with the King Crimson remixes for 5.1 has given him the ability to make great decisions as to where in the mix each part should be located. He has a tremendously gifted ear for harmonic structure, and that gift is put to excellent use on the surround version of this music.<br /><br />OK, I know this is a bit over the top. But this is music that matters. Buy it. THIS is genius at work.thing and chaos reigns\\"  There's an obvious acceptance of mortality here, and of imperfection, but Wilson delivers these lines with such conviction, and with such soaring musical accompaniment, that the starkness and sadness of the lines is tempered by a sense of awe, and of the majesty of existence.

B004LWZWE2|5.0|This has been a great couple of years for re-releases of great rock `n' roll concert films - first the little-seen \\"Ladies and Gentlemen, the Rolling Stones\\", and now AC/DC's classic \\"Let There Be Rock.\\" Awesome!<br /><br />The film starts off with some pretensions of offering a backstage look, and there are mini-interviews with the band. There is a bit with the tractor-trailer trucks pulling into town, the crew setting up the wall of Marshall amps, roadies playing soccer in the pit, then the band backstage getting ready for the show. The PA has 3,000 watts, the lights 300,000 watts! Judas Priest was the opening band (?!!!!!?). Pre-concert, we see the band getting psyched up, Malcolm changes his shirt in the men's room, Angus plays guitar, Bon does a photo session, the rhythm section (Phil and Cliff) duct-tape their own hands. There's the dodgy anti-Star Wars \\"Let There Be Rock\\" scrolling intro, which looks like it was done on pre-TSR 80-level graphics. Flames (of course - it's AC/DC!). Finally, we see the darkened stage, hear the low rumble of \\"Live Wire\\" - those magical three chords - and then you see Angus on the top of the amps, he jumps, and off they go.<br /><br />The audience is alive and sings along with \\"Shot Down In Flames\\" from the start. Angus has his first guitar solo spaz here (he has three more stage-munching incidents ahead of him). Part of \\"Sin City\\" is a chilled out blues buzz, but then it just mounts back into insanity - there's nothing else where AC/DC is concerned.<br /><br />The directors break in here with a weird interview section. \\"Are you waiting for the third world war?\\" Bon answers: \\"That's a good question...\\" He believes that musicians always do well during wartime. Far out... The other guys give slightly less coherent answers. There's a brief flip-out as the band goes to visit World War I biplanes, with Phil Rudd driving a Ferarri onto the airstrip, they fly around in a biplane, Malcolm is a co-pilot, and Bon does a little dance on a snowy tarmac next to a lake...<br /><br />Angus and Malcolm are still young in this movie. Bon will always be young (the film ends with a big \\"To Bon\\" card).<br /><br />In \\"Bad Boy Boodie,\\" Angus does his striptease. There's a great blues solo jam, crazy. Scene of Malcolm playing soccer, kicking the ball with one foot and drinking beer with one hand (AUGHHH!!!). Everyone in his interview has either a drink or a cigarette (or both) going. Angus sketches out his Angus devil cartoon. Bon signs autographs for les boys, then tells story about how he was a chauffeur who got the word that AC/DC were auditioning for a lead singer, so he went from being a chauffeur to being a singer (yes, he conveniently forgets to mention that he had already been a pop star before he was a chauffeur, singing in other Australian bands like The Valentines and Fraternity...). Admits that he drinks too much (famous last words...). The interviewer tries to coax him out of the closet, doesn't quite work. The boys are de-corking their champagne, doesn't work too well, even with a cutlass.<br /><br />Camera is on Angus onstage as he switches guitar in \\"Whole Lotta Rosie\\". Music seems off and overdubbed at times. Weird slo-mo editing during one part. At one point in \\"Rocker\\", Bon goes backstage, he looks like he disappears in thin air, but it's just the lighting. Angus goes off to the side-stage for oxygen (they put a hospital-grade mask over his face) and water, then heads out into the audience on the shoulders of a roadie, playing furiously, then he come onstage and plays from Bon's shoulders; eventually, he rolls on the ground in a furious solo, finally climbing on top of the Marshall stacks to finish the thing off., doing a magnificent one-hand solo. YEAH! The guitar talks, the audience responds - I've never seen anything like it!<br />The packaging is crappy - no booklet!!!Angus and Malcolm are still young in this movie.

B005MYEPXC|3.0|I love this movie but the blue ray I got has its white balance turned so warm, people and the environment are all glowing orange. That might have worked OK on film to be projected in theaters but on at least one of my LCD TVs it looks awful. I'll try it later on my Plasma TV and report on that also. Confirmed. The super-strong warmth makes everyone glow red/orange on the Plasma TV too. I know I could turn down the saturation to make it look more natural but no other blue rays I ever bought were so different than the big screen versions before.<br /><br />Don't dislike my review based on this. It's a clearly technical problem with the blue-ray version of the movie and people should be aware of it. I'm reviewing this version and not the movie content. It needs to be fixed and I intend to return what I consider to be a defective blue ray port.
B004ZNARH4|5.0|I'm a sucker for this sort of thing... and not only is Dark Side of the Moon one of my favourite all-time releases, I really really love box sets! This is one of the very good ones, as it comes with all sorts of goodies, with three regular CD recordings, audio and video on DVD, and audio and video on Blu-Ray, presenting all together ten different versions of the classic album in different formats and different mixes (CD, DVD and Blu-Ray). The sound part of the box include the regular release, a 1974 concert of The Dark Side of the Moon, and extra audio tracks that are linked to the release - this is a hodge podge that includes an early mix by Alan Parsons of the whole album, a song from the abandoned post-Dark Side of The Moon project \\"Household Objects\\", and various live sequences that bridged album songs but are not on the album, along with an early demo of \\"Money\\" with Roy Harper singing.<br /><br />The video material shows two pre-Dark Side of the Moon songs performed live (hodge-podge territory again here - it's \\"Careful With That Axe, Eugene\\" and \\"Set The Controls For The Heart Of The Sun\\"), a 25-minute documentary on the recording of Dark Side of the Moon, as well as the concert screens (animation, colours, patterns) shown at parts of the concert, but changed for various tours; three tours are shown here - the British Tour of 1974, the French tour of 1974, and the North American tour of 1975. Groovy.<br /><br />Music review<br /><br />Dark Side of the Moon (original release) (42 minutes long) - The 1972 release with the pretentious themes (life, death, war, money) is a truly insane recording, starting off with heartbeats (\\"Speak To Me\\"), pop (\\"Breathe In The Air\\"), nutty dogfight and plane crash sequences a la electronica (\\"On The Run\\"), weird booming bass and clock sounds and rock (\\"Time\\"), a long WHOOOOAH-WOOOOOOOOAHHH-WOOOOOOAHHHHHH gospel piece that mimics the last minutes of life (\\"The Great Gig in the Sky\\") as the continuous tapestry of the first side. The second side gives the \\"Time\\" treatment to the concept of money (\\"Money\\") with sound effects, and then rock, lovely piano bits that also soar in a song about the madness of war (\\"Us and Them\\"), the weird synthesizer bridge \\"Any Colour You Like\\" (also the longest track on the album), the guitar pop of \\"Brain Damage\\", and finally the sweeping crescendo of \\"Eclipse\\" and its chants. The most complex piece on the album is \\"Time\\", with its sound effects, booming bass, and three-part act that ends with... magic... and leads into the haunting wordless threnody. I listen to the album constantly and am not sick of it. But I've never owned my own copy, which makes this the right time to buy it and in the right and complete form. Unfortunately, curiosity in the additional bits is only that, and they neither truly improve or supplement the pleasures that the album itself holds.<br /><br />The Dark Side of the Moon live at Wembley, 1974 (55 minutes long) - As the album fades in with \\"Speak To Me\\", the live version introduces new sounds, a voice sample, and other strange noises, ticking clocks (to hint at \\"Time\\", which is to come later), ghostly voices come in, and finally... \\"Breathe In The Air\\", which has new guitar parts. David Gilmour sings it more gruffly and huskily than it is on the recording. Being a live concert, there's no need to take a break between sides, and before \\"The Great Gig In The Sky\\" is over, you already hear the coins of \\"Money\\" coming in, and the song takes off. In \\"Us and Them\\", the echo is provided by the backup singers, a bit cagey. \\"Any Colour You Like\\" goes off very differently than the studio version, sounding at times very Tangerine Dream-like, but with a bit of a drum beat. Great big long spacey guitar meander.<br /><br />Most of the songs, especially the instrumental bits, are longer live (this means \\"Speak To Me\\", \\"On The Run\\" and \\"The Great Gig In The Sky\\", while \\"Any Colour You Like\\" is more than twice as long), as are \\"Money\\" and \\"Us And Them.<br /><br />Extra audio tracks - First up is the original and early mix, which is 40 minutes long. The 1972 early mix of Dark Side of the Moon by Alan Parsons is largely the same as the final product, although sounding a bit rougher with some of the transitions and drum fills feeling unfamiliar. The initial \\"Speak To Me\\" intro is appended to some simple sound effects that only last 25 minutes, rather than the slow, silent heartbeat buildup that lasts just over one minute. \\"Breathe In The Air\\" sounds like the final version, albeit a bit stripped down, with the odd extra sound to it. The transition to \\"On The Run\\" is stark and doesn't sound very well-mixed, but the track is very similar to the final version, except slightly shorter and perhaps with more emphasis on the running sounds, more airplane sounds, fewer voices, and no spectacular plane crash at the end, just a simple blend into \\"Time\\", which sounds the same, albeit the chiming clocks at the intro are less intense and dramatic. The biggest difference in the recording is the absence of Clare Torry (and the final version's sound samples) from \\"The Great Gig in the Sky\\"; here she is replaced by the voice of Neil Armstrong's speech from the moon. While it sounds odd for people like me who have listened to Dark Side of the Moon hundreds of times, but it does give a nice opportunity to concentrate a bit more on the instrumental bits that were blasted to pieces by Torry's splendid wailing! The new arrangement with Torry also lengthened the track, probably due to the passion and sophistication of Torry's composition. \\"Money\\" is fairly faithful to the final mix, although it is half a minute shorter, with the final bit containing some slightly different guitar parts. \\"Us And Them\\" is also very different from the final version, being much more a duet between piano and saxophone, with an extended intro. It is nearly a minute shorter than the final version. Weird vocal echoing in the mix, much different from the final version in the \\"Up... and down\\" verse. In \\"Brain Damage\\", the manic laughter is different, and in this case highly fake-sounding and annoying, like some hellish circus clown trying to drive someone insane; it enters the song at two points. The final version is way better. It is the only really startling thing about this mix. \\"Eclipse\\" has a guitar part on it that is not used in the final, where the pounding vocals are supremely high in the mix.<br /><br />After Alan Parson's early mix of Dark Side of the Moon, there's a mish-mash of various songs and fragments, all instrumental until the last track, a demo of \\"Money\\" with Roy Harper, rather than Roger Waters, singing. \\"The Hard Way\\", not really part of the Dark Side of the Moon project at all, is a trippy blend of hand claps and deep bass boogie, augmented later by spooky percussive and chiming sounds and echoing chatter, really trippy. The band wanted to make a whole album of sounds produced by household objects, if every song had come out like this one it would have really worked! But I understand that they only really laid down two songs (the other one is on the Wish You Were Here box) before they moved on to other things. Although it doesn't really belong here, it's nice that it was included. \\"Us And Them\\" is a light piano piece by Richard Wright from the Zabriskie Point film project that was never released as a soundtrack, it's sweet but a little boring, and the ear strains to hear the brilliant vocals in the final album version. \\"The Travel Sequence\\" is echoey guitar that sounds more like something from The Wall than of this era, although there's a little bit of jazz keyboard and piano there too. Nice jam. \\"The Mortality Sequence\\" sounds like an intro to \\"Us And Them\\", but with more droning keyboard sounds, and new voice samples, such as an invocation from a priest, or someone speaking in a hospital. It goes into the sound of clinking coins, possibly as a setup to Money. \\"Any Colour You Like\\" is there too, froma live show in Berlin, but it's baffling that they'd include just a fragment of a whole concert - where's the rest of the show? What was so special about this short version of the classic cut from Dark Side of the Moon? It sounds great, but it also leaves you hanging. \\"The Travel Sequence\\" is jazzy, poppy instrumental funk with some swelling electronic burbles. Finally, the demo of \\"Money\\" with Roy Harper singing is interesting, as are the prototype money sounds that the song puts just after the middle, very different, of course, from the final version.<br /><br />The set also comes with an audio-only DVD that contains five mixes: 5.1 Surround, 448kbps (2003), 5.1 Surround, 640kbps (2003), LPCM Stereo (1973), 4.0 Quad 448kbps (1973) and 4.0 Quad 640kbps (1973). I listened to them all in a full surround sound version, it was good fun. And loud! I liked the Quad mixes the best.<br /><br />Video review<br /><br />The live songs - In \\"Careful With That Axe, Eugene\\", Roger Waters has the main role, firing up his bass and cooing the strange tics and howls of a madman, playing with a burning cigarette in the strings at the head of his bass, howling evilly, very scary whispering and cackling through a toothy, tight-lipped grin, great keyboard swells, fires ablaze, smoke pots burning. In \\"Set The Controls For The Heart Of The Sun\\", Waters sings without playing bass, then at the crescendo of the song he dons the bass but doesn't play it. Smashes the gong again, it burns around the edges! Waters plays bass finally, and then the live video breaks into nature scenes, for some reason: scenes of lava, golden ripcurls, etc.<br /><br />The documentary - Mainly going song-for-song throughout the album with explanation and discussion, the four band members talking about what went on during the recording sessions for Dark Side of the Moon. \\"On The Run\\" is about the fear of death, the fear of flying, with Roger's lyrics finally really coming of age as they discuss the pressures of life. Mature themes. Rick Wright explains that \\"The Great Gig In The Sky\\" goes from B minor through a series of changes, to finally end in B flat. No mention of Clare Torry at all (she had sued for co-songwriting credits and settled out of court, they probably don't like her very much any more)! Waters descries his potter wife's metal mixing bowl and how he put a mic and coins in the mixing bowl to get the sounds at the beginning of \\"Money\\". Describes weird process, and then says \\"and that was it\\", as if it was all very easy to do. \\"It was a dream fulfilled\\", he says about the album, noting that if the band had any guts, they would have called it a day right there (and not produced Wish You Were Here, Animals or The Wall, of course). \\"But it's a good thing we didn't, because out of all the anxieties and enmities that were left in the rubble of the explosion and all the success [of Dark Side of the Moon] came all sorts of wounded creatures that had their own stories to tell.\\" Roger Waters hadn't listened to Dark Side of the Moon in 20 years until this mix, but says he's very happy with it (of course). Wright notes that \\"Us and Them\\" stands the test of time better than others, on account of what it can say about \\"this punitive war in Iraq.\\" There's also an interview with Storm Thorgerson, who designed the iconic cover of the album, with him telling the tale of coming up with several ideas for the cover, but anyone who looked at them was immediately drawn to the prism and there was no discussing any of the other ideas - much to Thorgerson's frustration. I wonder what they were, though, the band and everyone else is very silent on the topic (they must be around here somewhere... of course Thogerson may have also recycled them for other groups' album covers over the years). Then he goes to explain how he did the various other covers for the re-releases over the years, etc.<br /><br />The onstage screen visuals These are somewhat interesting, and there are clips of the films that were played together with the live performance of songs during three various tours: British Tour 1974 (six clips, 16:16), French Tour 1974 (seven clips, 18:27) and North America Tour 1974 (seven clips, 23:45). For the British Tour 1974, the videos open up with animated and beat-driven spectrum-influenced animation. the colours seem burned away and not crisp. There's an exploding bookshelf, TV, fridge - which results in a flying chicken carcass. The French Tour of 1974 favoured fire, and has video for \\"The Great Gig In The Sky\\" showing a priest, then a burning cross. There's an unusual clip here for \\"Assorted Lunatics\\", which is just a sound collage of the spoken bits already familiar on the album, and then there's solar flares for \\"Eclipse.\\" In the North America Tour of 1975, there's more literal interpretation, with an ambulance, hospital hall, surgery, and scared eyes. While Clare Torry is singing, there are crashing waves, with some spectacular sun-through-lip-of-water shots. \\"Money\\" has a naked model and scenes of the old and the poor to juxtapose decadent wealth and youth with crushing poverty and age. There are also weird slow motions scenes of a squad of office workers walking down the street, their bodies twisting to a strange rhythm, scenes also of their pant cuffs and shoes moving in rubbery half-step.<br /><br />The box set also comes with a Blu-Ray disc that contains all of the audio visual material, along with the five mixes found on a DVD in this set.<br /><br />Packaging<br /><br />One of the main points about Pink Floyd is packaging - lyrics sheets, gatefolds, big images, colours, design, architecture, it's all there. This has it all too. To describe what you get it is:<br />- the box, which is heavy and durable and big enough to contain LPs, although it doesn't contain LPs'<br />- three marbles in a black velvet sack: the over-sized marbles show the endless circle of the white light becoming its six colours through one pyramid, and then re-melding into white light through another. Groovy... there are three people in my family, so I feel that this is special; if I collect the three Immersion sets (Dark Side of the Moon, Wish You Were Here, The Wall), I will have 3×3 marbles, how nice'<br />- Disc 5 and disc 6 in their own cardboard cases (each disc has its own triangle/light design) with groovy triangle/light motifs on their covers, but each in its own concept. I like disc 6, with its Magritte splotch concept, very nice.'<br />- a scarf that is 1.5 metres long, with the six colours/heartbeat (in the green zone of the red-yellow-orange-green-blue-violet spectrum), nice feel to it'<br />- a 12-page grey booklet of credits'<br />- an immersion \\"memorabilia\\" envelope, which contains a Pink Floyd Tour 1973 sticker, and a ticket stub for Friday, February 18th, the Rainbow Theatre, Astoria, Finsbury Park, London, seat A29, Block C, whatever that means.'<br />- a series of nine beer coasters, with the letters P-I-N-K-F-L-O-Y-D, and nice illustrations on the other side'<br />- an envelope containing four cards of a series of cards; I got numbers 7 (horse on head), 21 (airmen), 42 (sand swimmer) and 55 (echoes). They are also very nice.'<br />- a giant A4-sized envelope with a hand-written card describing the process of gathering the ideas bandied about by about the voices on Dark Side of the Moon. Was it, perhaps, written by Alan Parsons?'<br />- there's a beautiful Dark Side of the Moon \\"Liechtenstein\\" lithograph (but... what's a lithograph?)'<br />- a beautiful 36-page that includes all things triangular and light-like, meaning that there's the original cover of the album on the cover of the booklet, then there's the lyrics and some pretty pictures, there's some of the original images from the album release (band pictures, etc), and then some pics of Dark Side of the Moon-inspired automobiles, fashion, design, stained glass, word art, tour posters, real pyramids at Giza from many many views, and an essay on the album cover design by Storm Thorgerson.'<br />- a 24-page booklet of photos of the band from that era, including the great Clare Torrey, who sang backup, and who took over \\"The Great Gig In The Sky\\"; pics taken from 1972-1974.anges, to finally end in B flat.

To describe what you get it is:  - the box, which is heavy and durable and big enough to contain LPs, although it doesn't contain LPs  - three marbles in a black velvet sack: the over-sized marbles show the endless circle of the white light becoming its six colours through one pyramid, and then re-melding into white light through another. Groovy... there are three people in my family, so I feel that this is special; if I collect the three Immersion sets (Dark Side of the Moon, Wish You Were Here, The Wall), I will have 3×3 marbles, how nice  - Disc 5 and disc 6 in their own cardboard cases (each disc has its own triangle/light design) with groovy triangle/light motifs on their covers, but each in its own concept. I like disc 6, with its Magritte splotch concept, very nice.  - a scarf that is 1.5 metres long, with the six colours/heartbeat (in the green zone of the red-yellow-orange-green-blue-violet spectrum), nice feel to it  - a 12-page grey booklet of credits  - an immersion \\"memorabilia\\" envelope, which contains a Pink Floyd Tour 1973 sticker, and a ticket stub for Friday, February 18th, the Rainbow Theatre, Astoria, Finsbury Park, London, seat A29, Block C, whatever that means.  - a series of nine beer coasters, with the letters P-I-N-K-F-L-O-Y-D, and nice illustrations on the other side  - an envelope containing four cards of a series of cards; I got numbers 7 (horse on head), 21 (airmen), 42 (sand swimmer) and 55 (echoes). They are also very nice.  - a giant A4-sized envelope with a hand-written card describing the process of gathering the ideas bandied about by about the voices on Dark Side of the Moon. Was it, perhaps, written by Alan Parsons?  - there's a beautiful Dark Side of the Moon \\"Liechtenstein\\" lithograph (but... what's a lithograph?)  - a beautiful 36-page that includes all things triangular and light-like, meaning that there's the original cover of the album on the cover of the booklet, then there's the lyrics and some pretty pictures, there's some of the original images from the album release (band pictures, etc), and then some pics of Dark Side of the Moon-inspired automobiles, fashion, design, stained glass, word art, tour posters, real pyramids at Giza from many many views, and an essay on the album cover design by Storm Thorgerson.  - a 24-page booklet of photos of the band from that era, including the great Clare Torrey, who sang backup, and who took over \\"The Great Gig In The Sky\\"; pics taken from 1972-1974.

B004EPYZPS|1.0|Initially, I was going to just buy this, but I saw it at Redbox the other day and decided to rent it instead.  There's $1.20 absolutely wasted.<br /><br />I had relatively high expectations of this movie.  With Abrams and Spielberg working collaboratively, I figured it would have to be good in some ways.  I was wrong.<br /><br />I don't know if it could have been more hokey, cheesy, or cliche if they tried.  Poor sullen kid loses mom, and dad has to finally be a parent (ooh. gripping.).  The drunk neighbor is ridiculous.  Ooh.  Again.  \\"Stay away from my daughter\\".  Lame.  Then we have the sad alien who only wants to return home (ET, but more angry and on steroids?).  Amazingly, everyone comes away from a full on-train derailment with barely a scratch.  The person who DRIVES A TRUCK HEAD ON into it miraculously lived long enough to be killed by the USAF.<br /><br />Lovely.<br /><br />Stupid 'tween puppy love? Check.<br />Ridiculous story line?  Check.<br />Utterly predictable ending?  Check.<br />1 hour and 50 some minutes of my life I'll never get back?  Check.<br /><br />Those who rave must have seen another movie or are just blinded by the names attached to this movie.  Bottom line:  It was awful.

1591843790|2.0|I attended Guy's talk when he came to my office (a large Silicon Valley company), and I thought he was a great speaker. The content, on the other hand, was nothing more than feel good mumbo jumbo and trickery. While this was a good approach to more esoteric topics like founding and funding startups, it misses the mark when applied to being likable. It was actually funny that you could see Guy applying his own technique during the talk (exaggerated eye smile, dress code, body language). More than properly demonstrating the art, it made him seem insincere. Since then, I've become a bit more cynical and wary of overly friendly people who are in a position to benefit from interacting with me. That's why I gave the book two stars instead of one. At least it's useful in helping to catch the smell of a hidden agenda.
B004LWZW8S|5.0|Tarsem Singh is truly a genius when it comes to artistic movie-making, as done before in his film \\"The Fall,\\" which was one of the best dramas i have ever seen. Mickey Rourke was just incredible as the evil and merciless Hyperion, who just about brutally murdered everyone in his way. Henry Cavill was convincing as Theseus but could have done a bit better. Luke Evans was great as a younger-looking Zeus, and Freida Pinto was just beautiful eye candy as Phaedra, one of Hyperion's virgin oracles. As this film is impossible to not be compared to 300, i have to say, i think this one wins the war; 300 was a very incredible ACTION movie, but not as a whole complete film. It gave us a tiny bit of story in the beginning, little character development, and all action throughout the second and third acts of the film. Immortals on the other hand, mixed the action with story, carefully pacing the awesome visuals and fighting with dialogue and confrontations between characters. The visuals, by the way, were top-notch and i have no idea why it didn't make it onto the list for Best Visual Effects for the Oscars. I have to say though, it was mainly disappointing because of its short run time, but if they release a sequel, i am fully on-board for it, as a sequel is needed to complete this large and expanding story that preserves the classic \\"Gods needing a mortal hero\\" story line.<br /><br />4.5/5 Stars***

B003QSBYNK|3.0|My wife and my mother (age 87) liked this movie a lot and wanted to rate it four stars.  I would have rated it two stars.  So we compromised on three.  It was a long, long movie, and very, very little actually happened.  The queen wanted to not react to Diana's death and the PM convinced her to make a speech, after ninety minutes of persuasion.  So she gave the speech and the movie ended. At least the movie wasn't a whole week long.

The kindle fire will turn the screen properly to the left or to the right, whichever way I please, but this game forces me to only play with the plug on the right, tuis game will not flip the other way around, I, of course, need the plug on the left side, especially while playing thus game as the Fire battery does not last that well when playing this game.

B0052VUNHC|1.0|So this book had 240 something 5 stars and very little of else. Something must be terribly wrong with all the people that gave it 5 stars. Let's start with all that is wrong with this book:  1) ALL of the characters are flat and look a like. There is no depth to them and they are completely one dimensional. If it didn't say the name of the person talking or some characteristic that she gave them all (giggling, walking around in a towel, etc) you wouldn't be able to tell the characters apart.  2) The plot line is horrific and makes no sense at all. The main character has this big back story that only comes up halfway the book and has nothing to do with her up till then.  3) Most of the situations make NO SENSE at all.... how is mr Tatooed guy a straight A student? How is he not expelled for REGULARLY beating up people at school? How is it that she is so in love with him, but keeps pretending she isn't or that he isn't with her? How come she keeps breaking up with him and going back to him? It is all RIDICULOUS  4) The relationship is abusive and one sided.   In short: the book is crap, while it started out good, the writer should have taken a few classes and gotten a good editor (and a better spell checker) before publishing this work.
B000RZIGVS|1.0|Reader, I GOT VERY lucky and found this on eBay brand new for $129. I can't believe this cheap piece of dung is normally sold at $450+. The packaging is so bad I'll have to spend more money just so I have a  GOOD WAY to protect my disks.  1) First this thing has a plastic base that has one of those flimsy clear covers to go over it.  2) Clear flimsy cover (as said above).  3) The disks are in a cheap like plastic holder like you would find in packaging to hold headphones in until you open it and throw it away. Even better description would be that kind of cheap plastic found in marshmallow candies that is holding the candy.  4) The above DVD holders are then TAPED together (8 total) which acts as the hing.  I'm going to have to buy and/or find at least 7 DVD cases that can hold 6 DVDs (6 disks per season) just to keep the disks from getting all busted in the cheap packaging.

0393064476|3.0|When will book publishers return to the practice of sewing bindings? It is a waste of paper and printing, and dishonest to the consumer to glue pages on the edge, put a hardcover on it and sell it as something useful.  This book stupidly has a glued binding. This is just WRONG. Anyone who has read a hardback book with a glued binding more than a few times knows that pages loosen pretty soon. I'm very disappointed that this book will not last through repeated uses.
B005Y423ZC|5.0|Nothing more needs to be said about the Adele Live at the Royal Albert Hall DVD/CD than IT'S ADELE AT HER VERY BEST!!!  From the first song until the last where she enjoys teasing her audience about no encore, this is hands down one of the very best DVD/CD's I've ever heard.  Adele has been on top of the charts since she first appeared on the music scene and at 23 years of age, it's amazing to hear how mature her voice has already become.  When she talks to her sold out audience, you can hear the Cockney accent loud and strong but when she sings, it's mesmerizing.  This is an upbeat, excellently produced DVD that you will want to watch over and over again.  We pre-ordered our copy from AMAZON with the easy one-click process and it arrived exactly as promised.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Easy to play. Minimal ads for a fee app it's great. Only drawback is sensitivity of screen, sometimes only part of a column moves. Overall it's. fun and easy to play.

I do like the elastic strap but I really wanted a way to prop the thing up so I wouldn't have to hold it.  This doesn't do the trick.  I'll be looking for a sturdier stand/cover.    Also - this in no way influenced my review but I thought you cat owners out there might find this information useful: the inside of the cover is a cat fur magnet.  It's a little embarrassing...

You can't believe how disappointed I am in all this.  I will still see them when they go on tour this year.

0307474275|5.0|The Da Vinci Code<br />One of the most popular controversial mystery novels of the Twenty-First Century which invites the reader to investigate and open one's eyes to symbolism is The Da Vinci Code, written by Dan Brown. The title alone gives the reader insight that they will be exploring one of humanities' greatest minds, Leonardo Da Vinci and some of his most famous pieces to decode symbols that are hidden within. However, the title alone does not prepare the reader for the intense adventure, suspense and unique symbolism Brown takes the reader on throughout this page turning novel.<br />Brown introduces the two main characters early, starting the novel's suspenseful journey in France. Robert Langdon, a Harvard Professor, teaches iconology specializing in religious symbolism. To aide Langdon, an underestimated female, Sophie Neveu, a red haired cryptologist, is also established early on to the reader and Langdon. The two combine their specialties to solve the puzzles set within.<br />Given Langdon's background the reader begins to understand his role quickly and why he is chosen. The title of the novel and the introduction of the main characters allow the reader to prepare themselves for what Brown is about to introduce to them; a lesson on history that is neither told nor understood. What captures the reader's attention and would ignite controversy for years to come is the absolutely brilliant way Brown was able to take famous works, which most people have common knowledge of in some respect or another and completely redirect their thinking of what their \\"true\\" meaning was.  The multiple mysteries in The Last Supper painting are a prime example of how Brown takes popular Renaissance work and shows the reader hidden clues that are not well known.  This redirect in his writing is what makes this story plausible, realistic and so captivating to the reader.<br /> Brown's extensive and unique use of symbolism is what makes this novel so credible and engulfing.  The symbolism presented in Da Vinci's paintings, historical churches, and even a secret group known as The Priory of Scion, all hold subtle clues and secrets. After examining multiple paintings such as The Last Supper, the reader comes to find that the main characters overlook a small detail that in fact represents the climax of the novel, it is the defining symbol that ties the thesis, the suspense, and all supporting symbolism together: the color red.<br /> By the last page the reader develops an insight never before experienced in the subjects of religion and art history. Concluding The Da Vinci Code, remains controversial and continues to challenge the reader to determine what symbols Da Vinci left are derived from historical truth and which ones remain a mystery. Furthermore, not only does Brown force the reader to question the plausibility behind Da Vinci's work on religion and art history, but by the end he also encourages the reader to look closer at the characters and locations throughout the novel to see if Brown himself left hidden clues or messages for the reader to decipher.<br /><br />  Works Cited<br />Brown, Dan.

B004MC8CA2|1.0|As far a children's fairy books go this one lacked even a kernel of believability. Stick with the classics like &quot;The Grimm Brothers&quot;.
B00005JKDR|4.0|***This review may contain spoilers***<br /><br />When \\"Monsters, Inc.\\"first came out, some perceived a rivalry with \\"Shrek\\".  I simply want to conclude that I enjoyed both heartily and own both DVDS, and that both are highly accomplished animated features. On the old \\"Ebert and Roeper\\" TV show, I remember that critic Richard Roeper somewhat dismissed the film as something the kids would enjoy, but something where the adults would be glancing at their watches every few minutes. I can assure Mr. Roeper that my eyes did not stray ONCE during the film; the poor fellow must have been jaded by so-called sophisticated movies.<br /><br />I will not rehash the plot. I will say that all elements that constitute a movie, from background to characterization, were dazzling, convincing, and comprehensive. Monstropolis emerges as a fully fleshed out dimension uncannily mirroring our own - even up to the minute, with the simultaneously uproarious but sobering scene where a monster returns from the human dimension with a child's sock stuck to his back and he is manhandled (monster-handled) by decontamination crew members. Mike Waslowski (Billy Crystal) and James P. (\\"Sully\\") Sullivan (Goodman) move easily through this world. While the \\"Odd Couple\\" pairing is obviously not new (as admittedly, the plot - BUT WHO CARES?), Crystal and Goodman add spicy spin to their camaraderie. Despite Crystal's comedic presence, Goodman anchors this movie with his hulking and massive but ultimately sensitive and caring character, well, at least a good part of the time. Boo gives Sully a run for his money in the presence department.<br /><br />Despite superficial plot similarities to Toy Story (especially in the climactic dimensional door pursuit - yes, a potential Disney theme ride) and yes, even a smidgen of \\"King Kong), \\"Monsters, Inc.\\" stands on its own as a fascinating, well-rendered, multi-faceted piece of work. It is NOT a sickeningly cloying, sweet movie. Its moments of tenderness are balanced with some unsettling moments (e.g., Sully's scare demonstration (scared me, too) which terrifies Boo, Boo's restraint in the \\"Scream Suction\\" device by the unctuously reptilian Randall, and Sully's/Randall's fight, where Sully is being strangled by his invisible enemy). Sully's and Boo's developing relationship mixed in both laughter and tears. The dialogue and presence of the supporting characters was natural, matter-of-fact, and all the more funny for it.<br /><br />In short, \\"Monster, Inc.\\"'s plan came wonderfully together. Despite some commentators' views, the movie DOES have messages, not only of love and devotion and self-acceptance, but also about having the courage to risk altering a lifetime of conditioned thinking and behavior when it proves to be misguided. Pixar, you've done it again. Keep doing it...please!<br /><br />ONE QUIBBLE: Boo spends a considerable amount of time in the Monstropolis dimension. I wonder what her parents were thinking when she went missing. Perhaps the Monstropolis dimension is on a different time line, where hours there are the equivalent of minutes in our dimension (time relativity and all).(e.g., Sully's scare demonstration (scared me, too) which terrifies Boo, Boo's restraint in the \\"Scream Suction\\" device by the unctuously reptilian Randall, and Sully's/Randall's fight, where Sully is being strangled by his invisible enemy).

B002N5N4M6|5.0|The Big Bang Theory is one of the most well-written, funny, great shows on television right now. The actors are wonderful, the writing is excellent. It is a show that I will not miss. It is intelligent yet hysterical. The jokes don't pander to the dumbness that is so prevalent today. It is not predictable like most of the shows on TV today.  I am not a TV watcher at all, but I tune in every Thursday to watch the new episode and now I have found it in syndication, so I watch it once a day. I think you will love it also.
1451627289|5.0|This is the first book I've ever read that after I was finished, despite it being a daunting 850 pages, I wanted to immediately start over at the beginning. Now normally, I'm not a huge Stephen King fan. Not into demonic possessions and stuff like that. But this is a book filled with suspense, drama, action, science-fiction, romance, and pretty much everything else you can imagine.   Along with the obvious coolness of time-travel, it adds a whole new dimension with the question of-If you go back in time with the intention of accomplishing a job and going back, what do you do if you fall in love? It gives you an interesting look into the period of time that most of the book was written in if, like me, you weren't born yet. King's characters were well crafted, and he gave a rather interesting idea of what it would be like to a person of THIS generation living in 1960. But the most gripping aspect to me was how time was literally trying to prevent itself from being changed throughout the book.  Interesting, thrilling, nail-biting, whatever you want to call it, add it to your collection immediately or I will personally hunt down each and every one of you who read this review and don't buy 11-22-63 and beat you with all of its 850 pages until you fall over unconscious.

B0034G4P80|4.0|*** This review may contain spoilers ***<br /><br />I saw \\"Thor\\" on Monday, May 16, 2011 and I was generally pleased. Consequently, I should forget filing a future Mensa membership application. So be it. The movie probably lacks that precious moralistic profundity the Academy Award Committee purports to seek in its cinematic viewings. Nevertheless, I found it intelligent, competent, engrossing, AND respectful of its source material - namely Stan Lee's interpretation of Norse Mythology.<br /><br />\\"Thor\\" is not a mindless fantasy romp. It addresses various themes such as simmering sibling rivalry, filial fealty, overweening presumption and haughtiness that comes with power, resentment, self-sacrifice, and the wisdom of self-restraint. The overbearing, overreaching warrior Thor is thrust upon the road to humble self-redemption, and what better place to do so than upon an unassuming New Mexico hamlet on Midgard. Perhaps a tad too quickly (but that's all right), he learns of a warrior's, a god's, a being's true worth - forgiveness (of Loki's tortured treachery) and self-sacrifice (to protect Jane, her friends, and the New Mexico town) from the Destroyer juggernaut. In short, I found \\"Thor\\" ultimately uplifting.<br /><br />Flaws do exist. Occasionally the luscious, staggering Asgardian and cosmic backgrounds seemed like scale-model work. Thor becomes acclimated to Midgard customs a bit too easily; more \\"Fish Out of Water\\" encounters would have rectified this. Some of the S.H.I.E.L.D. security personnels' behavior was implausibly lenient. Nevertheless, \\"Thor\\" serves as a more than adequate introduction to the God of Thunder and Lightning, the devious but surprisingly conflicted God of Mischief and Evil Loki, the imperious but circumspect Asgardian lord Odin, the Asgardian dimension (NOT planet) and the richness of Norse mythology. It takes itself seriously enough, but not too seriously, because it's a rollicking, energetic adventure, too.<br /><br />Furthermore, the very last end credit whetted my appetite for \\"The Avengers\\" movie. Overall, \\"Thor\\" is a quite satisfactory accomplishment.\\"The Avengers\\" movie. Overall, \\"Thor\\" is a quite satisfactory accomplishment.
B005GNIX32|5.0|I bought this book on the recommendation of a review in Natural History magazine.  I gave it to my fourteen year old grandson, and then downloaded it to my own kindle.  We have agreed that the author is leading us further than we had ever gone before in exploring the wonders of our world and universe.  We are also agreed that it is a fascinating journey led by a skilled and imaginative teacher who shares himself as well as his knowledge in this very readable book.
B00005N6KG|5.0|I have read through some of the reviews of this product and see that some people have had problems with the sound going out of one side.  I have had the same problem. I am up to about my 4th headset in about 20 years. Yep, 20 years.  For the past 10 of those I have used these headsets for all my runs (I run 3 - 6 times a week), they have flown back and forth in carry-on luggage between the US and Australia many times and they have been hauled all over the country.  I think the people who have had less luck are really unlucky (or I am just very lucky).  I wrap the wires around the buds to store in my bag so I am not exactly treating them carefully. I pull my iPod out of my bag by my headset all the time.  I am not qualified to comment on the sound quality, although the sound is great to my ears!  What I can comment on is that these are the only ear buds that work for me.  I must have small ears because the standard ear buds do not stay in my ears, even if I am not running or working out.  When I stumbled across these many years ago, I was delighted.  I really wanted something small so I could exercise with them and all of the ear buds I had tried would hurt my ears or just fall out.  I even tried the sound proof earplug ones, which also worked but I didn't like being so cut off from my surroundings while running alone on a trail.  I always have a back up set just in case, but, fortunately, I haven't needed the back up very often. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend these even knowing that there might be a problem with the wires. If mine had broken as often as some of the others who have reviewed the product, I wouldn't be giving these a 5 star rating.  But for me, they are perfect.

B00005JKC3|4.0|Ludicrous as it may seem to some, reviewing \\"(The Incredible) Hulk\\" (movie, comic, or otherwise) is like sampling every course in a smorgasbord. It abounds with numerous substantial themes, some classical, some Shakespearean, others mythological.  \\"Hulk\\" also dives into psychological trauma from Oedipal and paternal conflict,  emotional and psychological abuse and repression. It even explores the essence of true identity  - is \\"Bruce Banner\\" merely the facade, and \\"Hulk\\" the real personality, as his own megalomaniacal father Dr. David Banner (Nick Nolte) mentions late in the film- and the intoxicating freedom of self-discovery. The movie is a skillfully constructed blend of other literary and cinematic works, from the obvious (\\"Frankenstein\\", \\"Beauty and the Beast\\", \\"Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde\\") to the more arcane, bizarre, and obscure (\\"Altered States,\\" \\"The Island of Dr. Moreau,\\" \\"Swamp Thing!\\", and yes, I do dare declare it, \\"Superman: the Movie\\"). Ang Lee has attempted to create an epic drama from a deceptively simplistic and superficial \\"creature\\" and has succeeded admirably. All the characters reveal vulnerability, dimension, and soul. I was transfixed watching this spectacle, and the Hulk, come to triumphant life.<br /><br />Anyone, I believe, caring to invest a bit of thought and interest in the movie's unfolding should not have had any reason to be bored. In this buffet of a movie, the first 45 minutes of exposition were not merely filler, but the essential meat fleshing out the enigma that the reserved, diffident, frustrated, and emotionally constipated Bruce Banner is. Eric Bana managed to convey this emotional repression and yet still evoke my sympathy, just as David Jansen did as Richard Kimble in \\"The Fugitive\\", yet another inspiration. His interaction with Betty Ross (Jennifer Connelly) was fascinating and seminal because although she claimed to be disillusioned with Bruce's impassivity, inevitably she could never cut herself away from him because, as the backdrop of her life demonstrated, she, too, is Bruce's alter ego and soulmate, destined to help in his healing and salvation.<br /><br />Despite the various themes swirling around, I feel \\"Hulk\\" is ultimately a movie dealing with the triumph of self-discovery, catharsis, and redemption. Bruce was doomed to an eternal prison of self-ignorance and loneliness inflicted by his wildly iconoclastic, obsessed father. Ironically, the gamma radiation gives him the key, because, like the potion in \\"Swamp Thing\\", the rays did not transform him so much as made him more of what he truly is. It is as the Hulk that Bruce salvages lost memories of his traumatic childhood. It is as the Hulk that Bruce retaliates against specific tormentors, rather than indiscrimately attack everyone in sight (as a truly mindless monster will). It is as the Hulk that Bruce embraces the heady feeling of power and freedom and begins to examine himself at the same time. Hulk is often described as a \\"tragic figure\\" and ample evidence exists of that in the movie, with his anguished roars of wrath and pain, his innocent, soulful stares when he is relatively calm, and, yes, his attempts to put his power to good use (e.g., saving Betty from the freakish Hulk dogs and trying to save the jet from crashing into the Golden Gate Bridge. I think Ang Lee was trying to chronicle the birth of a new \\"Superman\\", crude, terrifying, and unrelenting at first, but striving to become a true, caring, FORGIVING, superhero (as he demonstrates when he shakes the soldiers out of the tank turret before destroying it and during his climactic battle with his berserk, \\"Absorbing Man\\" father). Ultimately, Ang Lee transcends the tragedy of the Hulk's origin to suggest that, with luck, Bruce/Hulk will overcome their horrific legacy and the uncomprehending hostility of mankind to become a fully contributory and valuable member (not just a scientific genius) of the world.<br /><br />As you can see, I could turn the \\"Hulk\\" into a Ph.ddissertation. I am sure some graduate student already has. Yet, lest you think I am some verbose intellectual snob, let me assure you I also enjoyed the Hulk's visceral as well as cerebral pleasure. The entire desert/San Francisco battle sequence was taut, exciting, and exhilarating. The CGI behemoth, I felt, was utterly convincing and compelling, both in close-up and during his prodigious, soaring leaps. Hulk's phenomenal powers themselves are not a curse, as Roger Ebert mentioned in his review, but a blessing in an \\"inhuman disguise\\". Hulk revels in his power; during one of his stratospheric leaps, he actually reminded me of Superman in the 1978 movie just soaring through the air for the sheer joy of it.<br /><br />In conclusion, I believe Ang Lee successfully delivered both an intellectual and emotionally stimulating and evocative movie and created a respectful homage to Stan Lee and Jack Kirby's classically archetypal character.

B004EBZX6W|5.0|I've used this App for many months on my original Droid and again on the Kindle Fire.  This is easily one of the best apps I've found in the Android Market.  Perhaps the most useful feature is the ability to view signal strength of all nearby access points on a nice chart listing all of the available channels, making it very easy to see when two or more access points are interfering with each other, and demonstrating which channels would be available for use to reduce such interference in the future.

B005J29HCQ|5.0|Finally, the most anticipated album of all time has been officially released! Yes, I have heard (and own) almost everything on here, but there were a few nice surprises. I am excited about this release. What musician hasn't collected the myriad bootlegs that go around? This album is legend and most of the big time artists I have either talked to or heard on a documentary refer to having listened to this stuff for decades. There's inspiration within and Brian was riding the wave of creativity. The Heroes and Villains theme throughout this version was a surprise. I haven't heard it this way before and it never dawned on me that this was a segue-way weaving in and out of the different songs. It makes me like H&V even more. While God Only Knows from Pet Sounds remains my favorite song, I believe Good Vibrations is the most masterful  piece ever recorded. What would the Beatles have done after Sgt. Pepper's had this been released in 67? Even more intriguing is to wonder what Brian would have done next. This is one no musician can ever tire of. It gets better and better with each listen and starts those creative juices flowing. Thanks Brian for such a masterpiece.  As a group, the Beach Boys turn 50 and give us this wonderful gift. The box set is even more fantastic! A must own!
B003JR1USM|4.0|If you're looking for old school Nightwish, you will be disappointed.  There's no operatic sopranos here, and they're a bit light on the metal.  Think more like some of the folk songs off of Meredead, by Leave's Eyes for the closest comparison.  That said,  I enjoyed the atypical melodies--it was nice to hear something different--and the quirky vocals.  The lyrics are also quite thoughtful.  Our singer here is a bit nasal, but I honestly think that might be partly the accent (I actually went to school with a Finnish girl, and she sounded very similar).  I've heard more talented vocalists, but it's an interesting and high energy mix.  Most of the album made me want to dance. (and I don't dance.)
B005KJZDXK|2.0|Just by the \\"Little Saint Nick\\" and \\"Baby, It's Cold Outside\\" tracks and you'll be set. Like other reviewers, I was disappointed to not hear as much M. Ward as I had anticipated, thought I really like Zoey D.'s voice.
B0028KGD8I|1.0|The show is great, unfortunately Amazon's support of the on-line video is not so great.  They would rather put all their computer resources / servers toward selling us this stuff instead of actually making it work.  So, if you have a choice of buying on Itunes and downloading it you would probably be better off than going through the disappointment.  Of course, if Amazon would give me my money back I might not have to tell you all these nasty things about them.  They are like the Wizard of Oz, pulling all these little levers, but really they are just scared little people who don't know what else to do with their time.  They live in a cold, dark place where it rains all the time, and even the Canadians won't go there.  So with that, have a great Christmas and tell Amazon that Best Buy is still better than they are.

B005FMZX9Q|4.0|My first impression was how much I liked the black and white detail of the dial but at the same time I realized the white tipped hands were a poor choice for this execution.  I have often found in my experience that the pictures don't accurately portray the contrast of the hands, many times offering more contrast in person.  But in this case the picture is accurate and properly displays the poor contrast of the white tipped hands against the white dial.  This is not an at a glance watch which ironically considering this is supposed to be a pilot style design is supposed to be at a glance.  With experience you find your eye drawn to the black of the hands to read the time.<br /><br />Everything else about this watch I love!  I really mean that, it has caused me to reconsider purchases in the future because of things about this watch that I really like that in the past would not be a selling point for me or even caused me not to consider a watch.  First, typically I am not a fan of white dials and have dismissed possible purchases because of a white dial, but no more and am even now on the hunt for white dial watches.  I can't explain it but the white dial just looks good on the wrist.<br /><br />Second, this is the first watch that I have ever had that has the combination canvas upper and leather lower strap.  I love this strap and will now look for watches with it and even buy some straps for my other watches.  Third, this is my first lefty and in retrospect probably shouldn't be since I am right handed and like to wear my watches close to the hand.  If you are right-handed you normally wear your watch on your left wrist which means the crown is aimed at the hand and if you like to wear your watches close to your hand the crown can often dig in but the lefty design of the watch means the crown is aimed up the arm and makes it perfect for those that like to wear their watch close to the hand.<br /><br />A couple of other really nice things about this watch is the luminescence and the movement.  All the hands except the big second hand have luminescence even the sub dial hands but the real star of the show here is the Arabic numerals all glow which makes for a great night shot.  This makes a great movie watch.<br /><br />The watch did not include any specific movement description but I believe it has a Seiko VD57, another great quartz chronograph movement.  What makes this particular movement desirable is the second hand.  Typically chronographs use a sub dial to display the constantly running second hand and the big second hand is the chronograph second hand.  The VD57 has a constantly running big second hand and the sub dial at the 12 position is the chronograph second hand.  Another thing about the watch is because it is a lefty the function pushers are reversed, now the start/stop is on the bottom and the reset is on the top.<br /><br />45mm case size that wears and looks bigger because of the small bezel and big crown. Very comfortable and looks great on my 6 1/2 inch wrist. I have mixed feelings about this I Force, the hands are almost a deal breaker but I love everything else about the watch, so much so that it has changed my opinion about a few things in watches.  In the end I guess I would get the watch again so highly recommended with a caveat as long as you understand what you are getting with the poor contrast of the minute and hour hands.

Each had been a work-in-progress until they joined forces to become CSN.

B0034G4P94|5.0|If you have any doubts about seeing this film ... don't.  There's a reason it has received such high praise from critics and moviegoers.  It's terrific.  With outstanding acting ... Tom Hardy, Joel Edgerton, Nick Nolte, Jennifer Morrison, Frank Grillo, Maximiliano Hernandez ... it's the kind of movie that stays with you.  It offers that satisfying conclusion where you're stunned and just say 'wow'.  But every step along the way is special, in a tightly constructed plot, with great cinematography.  See it.  Enjoy it.  It's special and will touch you, while offering thrilling fight scenes.  Gavin O'Connor gave moviegoers a gift with this movie, and managed to fulfill his vision, while the acting carries a knockout punch.  With searing moments of inner pain, redemption and hope carry the day.  As for the DVD extras, they're worth the price of the DVD.  Behind-the-scenes footage of fight training camp, with comments by O'Connor and the actors is fascinating.  The one deleted scene is masterful ... Nolte got an ovation from the crew, and it was the first scene shot in the film.  I wish there were more deleted scenes, but this one is top-notch.  And the anatomy of the final fight scene is terrific, with story boards and great cuts of the actual fight, with rehearsal footage.  It's a thoughtful DVD extra package, worthy of a great film.

B006C45MRE|5.0|I loved this movie!  True, it's not great art and the aliens looked like a cross between Predators and the monster from BUGS BUNNY (except for the white Converse high tops... \\"Monsters are such IN-teresting people!\\") BUT I enjoyed it from start to finish. This was my first view of Daniel Craig (I'm not a James Bond kind of person) and the character was VERY good.  It was all such tongue-in-cheek and had so many really amusing quirks and twists!  My personal favorite was Paul Dano as Percy -- his characters are usually so moody/emo/dark-and-twisted that it was a pleasure to see his face light up in a smile AND his reaction to Jake Lonergan was hilarious.  Going from spoiled rotten kid to mewling, terrified kid in the jail allowed him to really show his stuff!  True, Harrison Ford's character was predictable but the characters were allowed to grow.  Don't take it too seriously -- it doesn't take itself at ALL seriously -- and I think you'll like it.  BTW, is there anyone else who wondered how that HUGE alien got into that teeny-tiny X-wing ripoff fighter?

0446573019|5.0|Zero Day is the first in David Baldacci's newest series with introducing John Puller, an Army investigator with larger than life strength and skills.  John Puller, reminds me a bit of one of my favorite detective heroes,  Lee Child's Jack Reacher.  There are obvious similarities between the two. Both are large, exceptionally strong and powerful men -- likely in the top 1 percentile in physical strength.  Both are well trained investigators with a strong sense of justice. They have faith in their country even as the people and institutions that they trust and rely on let them down.  They are both highly decorated soldiers -- just the type that the Army needs and wants to promote.<br /><br />Neither John Puller nor Jack Reacher are interested in becoming generals or career officers.  They are disillusioned by the Army and they respond in different ways.  While Reacher leaves the U.S. Army to travel the world without a suitcase, John Puller has strong ties.  Remember that Reacher refuses to be tied down by a home, family, mortgage or even a suitcase and a change of clothes.  Instead he buys something new and disposable each time.  In contrast, John Puller  -- he has been shaped by his father and his brother.  The two most important men in his life were highly respected and decorated Army men.  And while Puller's brother is now in prison for treason and his father the two star general is suffering from dementia, Puller spends time with both of them every week.<br /><br />Puller conducts both the investigative work and the CSI work when he handles an Army investigation.  As Puller performs these investigations for the Army, he works within the system and is deeply sensitive to its hierarchy and bureaucracy.  Puller faces greater restraints than Reacher  as he follows the government's strict rules, but Puller respects these constraints and shows his ability to read a situation and the people around him. Puller has a strong moral center - and it comes out in the best possible way.  Puller is the sort of detective hero that you can't help but root for.<br /><br />In Zero Day, David Baldacci introduces a new hero and an investigator that will surely capture the hearts of readers everywhere.  John Puller is on my top ten list of investigators - can't wait until the next Jack Puller adventure.<br /><br />ISBN-10: 0446573019 Hardcover $27.99<br />Publisher: Grand Central Publishing (October 31, 2011), 448 pages.<br />Review copy provided by the publisher.the sort of detective hero that you can't help but root for.

1451648537|5.0|After reading this remarkable biography, I can say that Steve Jobs was an enigma to everyone around him. From his days at college until his last days at home, one gets to know the peaks and valleys of his world. At times Steve is portrayed as, brilliant, rude, loving, caring and tyrannical.  The book makes you cry, laugh, feel loathsome and amazed at how one man made such a difference in millions of lives throughout the world.  Walter Isaacson has written a tour de force about a man who would be king of the tech world. Isaacson, weaves carefully throughout Steve's life giving you a deep inside look at what made this man such a driven human being. Not only is the book filled with so many emotional roller-coaster rides, it is written with fluidity. You feel as if you are walking on the smoothest sand any beach could offer while experiencing the emotional storm called Steve Jobs around you.  At times, I felt disgusted in the way Jobs behaved towards, family, friends, colleagues, business partners and subordinates. One minute Steve would think you're a brilliant person, and then the next minute, he would fire you for no apparent reason. Steve felt it was his right to steal your ideas as his without any reservations.  I really enjoyed the notion that Steve was driven by expecting excellence in everyone who worked for him at all levels. Steve only wanted \\"A\\" players around him at all times; including his family.  In accomplishing what he did over the 35 years prior to his death, Steve Jobs was responsible for not only creating some of the greatest technological discoveries, but he set the bench mark for future generations to strive for in being only the best at what you do every day.   His ambition, drive and single-mindedness for perfection came at a dear price. He succumbed to pancreatic cancer from many fronts; poor dieting, overworking, and not following doctors' advices on taking care of his immediate medical needs. These and other factors contributed to his demise.Isaacson has written a marvelous work and did not hold back and/or pull any punches in portraying Steve Jobs for what and who he really was to everyone.  Isaacson has written a book that you can revisit 10 years from now and still enjoy it and learn something new about the ma;, how the business world operates, what to do and not to do to succeed in all aspects of life.  The reader will not be disappointed in this sensational book of the Apple icon himself. Steve put the \\"i\\" in Apple products which now outsell anything else in the world.
B00004T0US|5.0|In 1956 Elvis entered the world with \\"Heartbreak Hotel\\", though he had been changing the music scene at large forever a few years before with \\"That's allright, mama\\". Seek out that important chapter. The cd \\"Elvis at Sun\\" is a good place to start.  Few could have imagined that this word \\"heartbreak\\" would be so imperative to both his life and career, it has yet to be recognized by both the press and public at large.  This word drips through every recording of 1976. Other reviewers have already explained the circumstances in which these recordings took place, so i am going to add some other thoughts on these sessions.   These two sessions became known as the \\"Jungle Room Sessions\\" and an album with this name is available on the FTD label. There you will find alternative takes of these songs, sans overdubs and post production: Elvis recorded everything live! Yes, you read correctly, Elvis recorded everything live, also in the studio. He would work on a song till he was satisfied. So, if a mistake was made halfway the song and it would be disturbing, they would have to start over again.   Elvis was de facto his own producer, an oft overlooked fact. He deserves industrial recognition imho for that, because he made some world changing records in the fifties and made some astounding ones in the sixties and seventies.  Back to these sessions: a very depressed and heartbroken Elvis (\\"emotional SOB, i get carried away very easily\\", he said of himself during these sessions) gives you an insight to his heart and soul as he plunges through heartbreak song after heartbreak song. He cried out very loudly in 1976. But nobody noticed.  This is not an album which will make you feel good, yet it will support you when life is dark and difficult. There is someone out there who understood what you are going through and his voice will put an arm around your shoulder and look at your heart and soul and recognize the damage done.  The USA should be proud of this man. It seems that he is better understood outside his own country. He is not a laughing matter, he is not a joke. He was a real human being who changed the world on so many levels. Maybe you have to step outside the box to recognize that, but he deserves so much more than he is getting. Look up the interview with Ann-Margret on this matter. (Just google: \\"ann margret interview elvis\\" and the 1st result will help you.)  Are you aware that Elvis received the lifetime achievement Grammy award in 1971? And are you aware of the groundbreaking meaning of Aloha? Not only a satellite telecast as early as 1973, but also a benefit show! Seek it out.  I would love for America to finally and totally embrace this genius who gave so much to the US and the world. To me, it is a laughing matter to see the total number of Grammy's Elvis received. This still can be rectified. And it would send out the signal that the US finally understood what Elvis told you since 1954. You and i are still harvesting what he sowed.  (P.S. To know what Elvis thought of the USA, seek out \\"An American Trilogy\\", i.e. as performed during the Aloha telecast. And in 1976, Elvis spent most of time touring, grueling schedules. But it was America's Bicentennial Year and Elvis performed \\"America The Beautiful\\" on almost every show, sometimes turning it out into a vocal show stopper).
B000R8YC18|5.0|Yep, that's right, I think this is Martin Scorcese's best movie.  Even better than Goodfellas, Casino, or Raging Bull (all fantastic movies, mind you).<br /><br />I first came across Taxi Driver back in December of 2006 when it was on AMC, and while I only caught about the last 60% of the movie, I was captivated by the gritty cinematography and central character, Travis Bickle.  It wasn't long before I requested it as a Christmas gift, and this is one Christmas gift that hasn't been returned or will ever be returned.<br /><br />STORY<br /><br />The story for Taxi Driver is centered around Travis Bickle (Robert DeNiro), a lonely and socially-isolated man honorably discharged from the Marine Corps, who takes a job as a taxi driver because of his chronic insomnia (his motto is \\"If I can't sleep, I might as well get paid for it.\\").  As time progresses, Travis becomes increasingly disgusted with the \\"scum\\" infesting the streets of New York City, and hopes to \\"make a difference\\" one day.  In his life, he hopes to bond with a woman named Betsy (Cybill Shephard), whom he considers \\"an angel in a city of filth,\\" and later gets involved with a young prostitute named Iris (played by a then 12 year-old Jody Foster) and her slimy pimp, Matt (Harvey Keitel).<br /><br />CHARACTERS<br /><br />Taxi Driver only has one highly-developed character, and that's Travis.  I don't really see this as a problem since like the Michael Caine masterpiece Get Carter (1971), Taxi Driver is really all about Travis.  Travis isn't a really a guy to look up to (he's a sociopath), but at the same time, his darker qualities aren't at all forced.  Probably because of the Vietnam War, Travis is socially-detached from everyone else, and it really shows when he tries to establish a romantic relationship with Betsy.  His relationship ends pretty swiftly when he takes her to a porn theater, thinking that when she said \\"go to the movies,\\" that she'd want to see those types of films (Travis frequently goes to these theaters, and isn't too familiar with \\"regular\\" movies).  Because NYC is infamous for crime (especially during the time it was set and filmed, which was 1976), Travis's disgust with the slimy people walking the streets is totally understandable.  Travis's character is also very creative, because when he plans out his \\"finest hour\\" near the end of the movie, you see him take apart the railings from a shelf and lamp, to create a sliding mechanism on his right arm that pops out a gun from under his sleeve.<br /><br />The supporting cast is in top form as well.  Shepard does a great job as Betsy, and despite Travis's eventual disillusionment with her and his conclusion of her being \\"just like all the others,\\" we can't really look down upon her for leaving him.  Foster did a great job with her role as Iris, as she really wants out of her deplorable life, but is also afraid to leave, and shows this by pretending to like the life she has.  Keitel is excellent as Matt since he's a slimy pimp, but his character doesn't seem forced at all.  While his appearance was small, Peter Boyle was great as \\"the Wizard,\\" a seasoned cabbie whom the other cabbies Travis hangs around with seek knowledge and interesting stories about the business.<br /><br />SETTING<br /><br />New York City circa the 1970's was the perfect setting for this movie, since as stated before, the 70's was a decade of crime and NYC is known for lots of crime.  The cinematography was top-notch as well, as it captured all the filthiest corners of the city, helping to flesh out Travis's resentment of the \\"filth\\" infesting the city.  Also, with this being a movie made 35 years ago, the film's age shows in the picture quality, giving it a naturally-grainy look to it.<br /><br />SOUNDTRACK<br /><br />Bernard Herrmann made a fantastic soundtrack for this movie.  The main theme is loaded with dread, and perfectly matches the tone of the movie.  The other for the movie also breath life into it, almost making a snapshot of what NYC was like in the 70's.<br /><br />MATURE CONTENT<br /><br />This isn't a movie for the kids because it rightly deserves its R-rating.  Towards the end, there's a good deal of brutal violence and even before that, there's a good deal of salty language (some of it is strongly sexual) and when Travis goes to the porn theaters in two scenes, there's footage of the erotic movies he's watching (one of them being the Swedish sexual film, Language of Love).  Not to spoil any parts of the film containing the brutal violence, there's one scene where a man gets his hand blown off with a .44 magnum, and it's not pretty.<br /><br />FINAL WORD<br /><br />For once, I agree with most critics with their assertion on a \\"classic\\" movie.  Taxi Driver is truly a masterpiece in the psychological-thriller genre, and I think it's Scorcese's crowning jewel.  If you want a classic film with an excellent portrayal of a sociopath in a city of slime on the verge of madness, then this movie is a must-watch.htly deserves its R-rating.

B000MD9UJC|5.0|I just bought one of these from a local store.  The light is MUCH brighter and better than the incandescent bulb.  I am going to replace all my regular Mag Lights with these.  Testing the bulbs side by side (I have one with the LED conversion kit and one without) the difference is very obvious.  The LED is way easier to work with.  I highly recommend you give it a try.
0385335997|4.0|Fans like me will love this novel as much as the previous ones in this series.  As close to perfection as it gets in historical and adventurous romance.  Already dreading the end of the series.  I wish Jamie and Claire could go on forever.
B0015AARJI|1.0|The control does not load properly and was scratched, I can't ensure it was new, on the contrary I can assure that is not new.
B005O64VH8|3.0|I agree with other reviewers that Secret Garden is losing its creativity.  Generic sound and melodies make this album non-memorable.  Not that this album is bad, but it almost sounds like it's a remix of their earlier albums - with songs added to cover up the mixing.  Unlike other reviewers, I actually like the Earth Song album - particularly Sleepsound and Lotus.
B004WKOCP8|5.0|This is mostly a mellower cd than what they've done in the past. At first I was a little shocked as to how mellow the songs are. But the lyrics are so good, and the songs have a nice flow to them. I honestly think that this is a great cd once you've opened up and accepted the fact that this band is not going to make the same cd twice. This cd proves that these guys are evolving as musicians and that the lyrics are really good and the music supports the mood.   Look at the guy on the cover, walking the tightrope. He knows he's taking a chance at something that he needs to concentrate and take his steps slowly in order to successfully get to the other side. This cover describes how the band thought about making this type of album. They knew they were taking a chance. Most people would rather see a football game versus a man walking a tightrope. I see beauty in both and the more you listen to this album the more you hear how great it is.
B003E6K1VK|1.0|Purchased this on the 9th of december received it on the 15th of December. Worked fine with my macbook pro and my advices with a fiio l9 LOD with my SRH750DJ. Morning of December 20th sound began fading in and out and by the end of the day no sound at all  from any of the outputs. Now I'm stuck with it not working under 30 days and amazon will only do a return and won't even exchange it or replace it, so I had to send an email to fiio about replacing it. Just a side note the seller doesn't have any con act info so get ready in case anything goes wrong
1610452607|5.0|As much as I like to read, I always sell myself short on reading \\"true literature\\" . . . especially books that were written pre-20th century. Listening to the audio version was a wonderful re-introduction to Dickens! It was incredibly easy to follow along, and the story came alive. It was magical.  The narrator impressed me with all of the voices that he did. In scenes when multiple characters were conversing, it was easy to follow along due to the unique voices that he gave each character. His British accent made me feel as though Dickens himself could be narrating the story.  Listening to this book together would be a wonderful family tradition! Both young and old will love this story! Don't miss out on this moving story!  I received a free copy of this audio book from christianaudio in exchange for my fair and honest review.
0757302661|5.0|I didn't read this book until I was pregnant with my 3rd child. I had already had 2 unmedicated births following the Bradley method. I believe that Hypnobirthing combined with Bradley leads to the best birth experience. I labored the entire time in silence, in the \\"zone\\" and free of pain. The only true/intense discomfort I felt was right before pushing - when I had to adjust my position. As long as I stayed in one position, no pain! Seriously, this works. AND - to the critics, I never took birth classes, did home study only, and had 3 blissful unmedicated births. The 2nd birth was less painful than the 1st and the 3rd was truly a bliss - I was high for days....loved it.
B005OCFHHK|4.0|Comes in a great case, sturdy and thick. the discs are nicely displayed. Looks great when watched. My problems are that it is wide screen, which you can't tell from looking at the box, and that disc 7 part 1 has no cover art. While the other movies have a picture of Harry/Ron/Hermione, 7 part 1 is totally black and says \\"harry potter movie\\". I have not seen the actual disc for 7 part 1 and it is definitely possible that it never had a cover art. I would have been disappointed if I had paid full price, but I got this one on sale for $80. Seeing as in my town it can only be found 1-7 part 1 for $140 this was a great deal. Love the series! Overall I have recommended this to many and would continue to do so!
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|This is a great cover.  It's not cheap or flimsy at all.  It matches the look of the kindle nicely. If you are hoping for something fancy looking than go get a nice leather cover not this one.  The stand works ok but isn't fantastic, if that feature is very important to you select a different cover.

B0034G4P94|5.0|It's great to see a movie that has everything a movie should have! I'm no film critic but I know when I have witnessed something special and this was certainly it. There's a very believable plot with realistic present day dilemma's that include the war abroad and the housing crisis in America. Best of all there's the much needed build to a great finish that is so much better than you will envision because you are inside the cage fighting [and bawling] for each fighter.<br /><br />No blood, no real violence, and no sex keeps this movie close and intimate for every viewer whether they're into mixed martial arts or not. Hate to do the five star thing since this is my first review of a movie on Amazon but dang on it, the performances are so five star! I'll make it my only review of a film here to prove there isn't a better one in this genre. Should I come across one that is I will delete this review and tap out another for that film.<br /><br />* * * * *<br /><br />P.S.<br />QUESTION FOR A CAR ENTHUSIAST:<br />What is the make & model of Coach's vehicle parked in the hospital parking garage when Brendan pursues him to become the replacement in Sparta?

B0067AC5KA|5.0|This series was amazingly captivating once one gets beyond the about the first four chapters of the first book.  The reader meets Lisbeth and is immediately inclined to dislike her, however, once we become more acquainted with her, we realize that there is more to her than her appearance.  I warn those with weak constitutions that this series is very graphic and does treats many social taboos as common place. Upon beginning the first book, it can seem boring and meticulous in it's detail, however, I can't stress this enough...KEEP READING! It keeps getting better and more devious as you continue.  There are a few sections of these books that are sexual and violent to the extremes of the terms, however, they have purpose as they act to illustrate certain aspects of the characters and their stories.  The mysteries of all three keep one turning the pages to find out what happens next, especially the ending of the second book.  Before the complete edition came into being I had to buy each book separately...by the end of the second book It was somewhere around two in the morning and I had to buy the third one and begin reading it before I could allow myself to go to bed. All in all the books are extremely well written and keep you guessing until the very end.  My only qualm with the series is the abundance of Swedish jargon that can be confusing at times, especially the currency that is meaningless in the beginning unless one has a complete knowledge of the currency conversions. (more power to you)
B004WR125O|2.0|The Onkyo Wifi Adapter was pretty poor when I used it.  It would take forever to connect and would constantly disconnect.  I followed the advice of another reviewer on here and bought the TP-Link TL-WN722N, hoping I could get a better connection.  The TP-Link has been far and away superior to the Onkyo wifi adapter.  It connects several times faster and doesn't disconnect constantly like the Onkyo unit.  Don't waste your money on the Onkyo

B000089QEN|4.0|After reading many of the reviews at the Amazon website, I was a bit wary to actually get and watch the BBC version of Thackery's best novel. Fortunately, my curiosity overcame my hestitation, thank goodness! This is a splendid production! Andrew Davies did a wonderful job of adapting/simplifying an 800+ page book into a 300 minute series. Granted some of the scores of characters you meet in the book didn't make their appearance in this production, but I can't think of a single one of them that would have made a significant difference in the storyline had they been included. Thackery's book was a satire in the mid-nineteenth century British life, as so many of his works were. This series faithfully follows that theme, with a cast of several self-serving, conniving types interspersed with a couple of really warm hearted, if not almost idealistically naive, ones. The book's subtitle was \\" A Novel without a Hero\\", yet there was one, in fact: William Dobbin. The series very subtly points this out.   I think the acting was excellent, as was the casting. So many of the people looked and acted like Thackery described them! Natasha Little as Becky Sharp was outstanding: a beautiful woman capturing both the allure and the selfishness of her character. Philip Glenistar as William Dobbin, portrayed him as I would have liked him portrayed, more of a quiet, gentle, intelligent man with strong feelings. In the book, Thackery's Dobbin was at times almost a clumsy dolt; this seemed out of character for the person who ultimately was THE true hero. But! no need to go on - the point is that this production was very well done and the actors/actresses well chosen.  I gave the series a 4 star, rather than  5 star, rating because I had trouble hearing some of the dialogue over the raucous background music and because of the many closeups of people's faces. The latter I can't explain at all; unless filmmakers now-a-days do this. The loud brass music I felt was to emphasize the 'fair' nature of the title - Vanity Fair. Thackery referred to the vanity fair that his characters were part of many times throughout the book. I take it that the music was chosen to indirectly point this out. It brought to mind the fair, or carnival, parade and its music at the end of the BBC's Persuasion film.  I believe that those who don't sit down to watch this production with preconceived notions or with too much of a abolutist, critical eye, will find the tale as told most enchanting.
B006DRVFRQ|3.0|This is a nice app for the most part; easy, fully featured, powerful, but streaming podcasts doesn't work on the Fire.  If you click the podcast button then press stream, nothing happens. The mp3 link should be picked up by the Amazon's music player but it's ignored.  You can't download them either unless you upgrade to the \\"Pro\\" version, which doesn't seam to exist.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|This is exactly what my husband wanted for his Christmas gift. We used to have all of the videos, but somehow or other some got borrowed and not returned. We will keep this set all together! Great buy for what you get!  I would do it over again in a heart beat!
0060723513|1.0|I picked this book up at a thrift store (and I'm glad I only spent 50 cents on it).  The back cover blurb was sort of interesting.    I won't go into how poorly the book is written, as other reviewers have done a good job on that.  Suffice it to say that it sounded like a fifth grader was writing a \\"how I spent my summer\\" essay.  And the trite, cliched new age \\"truths\\" that are liberally sprinkled throughout are cringe-making.  Besides, reading it, it just sounded too \\"easy.\\"  Oh, yes, let's trek across the interior of Australia and the only hardship is sore feet and body odor.  Everything else sounded like a picnic. (And, indeed, the author does use the term picnic to describe an afternoon.)  And it somehow didn't ring true to me.  After I finished the book, I googled Marlo Morgan and found that it is indeed a fantasy, a fraud, a self-serving manipulation.  Somehow I am not surprised.  At least I wasn't taken in by the new age silliness as some seem to have been.  Final note: Generally when I'm done with a book I'll donate it to the library, the senior center, or another thrift store.  I ripped this one up and threw it in the recycle bin.  I did this so that no one else would be inadvertently subjected to it.

B004K4IZ54|5.0|I'm a fan of the original and it's wonderful to remember it having not seen it in years. I never got around to buying it on Blu-ray or VHS so now was a great time to experience it in HD. The new movie is also quite decent and having just bought a Sony 3DTV it looks quite nice in 3D, i actually find it hard to watch in 2D now. Some 3D movies tend to give me a slight headache, but TRON Legacy is very easy on the 3D eye it seems. One of the best 3D releases along with Coraline which is also amazing in 3D.

From cover to cover, this book is full of inspiration, business building strategies and examples of how one idea can change a life!<br />From a corporate perspective I thoroughly appreciated Blake's description on the qualities that are essential in a team and leadership: trust, autonomy, engagement, creating champions and partnerships, and the foundation of corporate giving (in more ways than just money).<br />From the community service perspective, I valued Blake's examples of the many ways in which an idea can help millions, and how giving creates a cycle of reciprocity. Blake stressed the importance of having a story and sharing your story, this is critical for any project, and business. His tips on creating, sharing and living your story will make a difference in how I approach my next big project.<br />A book that will definitely make a difference in our world!<br />Charmaine Hammond,<br />Author, On Toby's Terms

B0057R5XRG|3.0|The Jurassic park trilogy comes with superb audio in all three films. The video does not measure up to the audio. It is solid but not in the top range. This is not a demo disk in any sense of the word. People differ on the stories, but the box office tells the tale of declining public interest. Jurassic Park had a box office of $357 million in 1993, The Lost World grossed $229 million in 1997 and Jurassic Park III $181 million in 2001. The figures are not adjusted for inflation. The failure of either of the sequels to come near to the original shows that the screenwriters could not develop a gripping story line for these films. Give this Trilogy a pass and rent the first film. It is not one you will want to see more than once.

B005DOKL3E|4.0|I already owned a kindle and love it, but wanted to upgrade to the fire for the color screen.  I love it, have had cataract surgery so being able to adjust font size for reading books is a great plus for me.  The only issue i have had is having to reinstall the Words with Friends game which i finally just deleted as it would not work properly on my fire.  The video quality is great as well as the sound for listening to music.  It is very easy to use.  I am glad i did not invest money in other products even though they may have more bells and whistles.  The Kindle Fire is just right for me.

B005HV6Y5W|1.0|I watched this movie in the theater and could not believe that it had received so many positive reviews from the critics.  There were a lot of disjointed visuals, and a lot of cheesy dramatic whispering of dialog.  I guess this is supposed to make me feel moved?  It was one of the most blatant attempts to be an \\"artsy\\" movie that I have seen... yet being that obvious about it made it not art, but just bad.  As serious as the tone of this movie was, I found myself laughing at moments that I found unbelievably ridiculous.  Just wait for the dinosaurs and you'll know what I mean.  That's right... I said dinosaurs.  I very much do appreciate movies that break the mold of traditional films, but I came out of this movie feeling like I wasted my money and my time.
B003Y5H54W|4.0|Red Riding Hood is a pretty good horror flick with only a few things preventing it from being perfect.   Those who compare this film to the Twilight series are in fact correct- the overdramatic acting, the sense of mystery and fairy tale, and the presentation is spot-on 100% identical.  This film is basically what you THINK it's about in relation to the popular childrens book story. A big bad wolf occasionally (depending on the moon) comes out and kills people.  Alright so that's not exactly how the story book went, haha. But this IS a horror movie so some adjustments had to be made.  Red Riding Hood is a BEAUTIFUL young woman who is stuck in a tricky situation between which two guys she'd like to marry. Actually it's more like she prefers one guy, but the other guy is hand-picked and recommended by her family, so... you'll see what happens.   I LOVE how frightening the wolf looks in the movie. He attacks at lightning speed, he's extremely agile, he looks WAY more intimidating compared to a regular wolf, and even the storyline about how the villagers believed they killed the wolf only to be completely taken by surprise is another winning element to this great movie.  Speaking of surprises, it's up to you to guess who exactly is the big bad wolf. It turns out it's actually a person in disguise. I'm not patting myself on the back, but I had it figured out since the beginning based on a certain demeanor. That's all I'm saying so as not to spoil anything!  My only complaint is the ending. It's not bad, but the ending loses the horror aspect and focuses more on sentimental storytelling. You'll see what I mean. Not a bad way to conclude a pretty interesting storyline though, so I won't complain.  Overall, some would argue this isn't really a horror because it's only actually scary SOME of the time, and there's not really much in the way of atmosphere either (well... other than a few instances) but I don't know, it made me feel pretty terrified.
B001IHJ97E|5.0|I had been looking for this movie for several years and just recently my daughter told me to try to find it on Amazon. I immediately found the movie, ordered and received it promptly. I am very pleased and plan on checking on Amazon first whenever I'm looking for something
B0000067L2|5.0|The kids nowadays in high school wear shirts that showcase the doors, zeppelin, pink floyd, sometimes even the beatles. It is a sad fact that Cream is never showcased or advertised. So many people have never even heard of this great band. But they will recognize the songs.   This is their best album. Buy it.
B004LROMSO|5.0|First of all, the product came how it was suppost to come. Now about how they changed the story and what not. I think its up to people to work their minds see it from another point of view and If you're a fan of the original story maybe it'll get you kind of upset but atleast it gives you another way to look at it.  Recieved on estimated time so its a + for the Seller;).  Hope good for all of you and happy holydays. ;)  Sincerly,  Suifon.
B005HSG3TC|4.0|The Fire is a great product.  The speed is wonderful, the list of can do items is extensive.  The increased weight over my original Kindle tool minimal time getting used to, but is less heavy than Nook.  What keeps me from giving it a five star rating is both the screen glare (I like to read outside) and the difficulty of use that some applications have.

B000HT3PPG|5.0|If you haven't seen this movie, you have really been missing something special. It is the original and the best. It should be everyone's way to kick off the holiday season. It's a classic. Natalie Wood is so adorable and believable. A must have for any movie library.
0547258305|5.0|I saw this as the 99 cent kindle offering and wanted to put in a good word for this book.  I read it about a year or so ago, but it has not left my memory.  Characters are well crafted and this is a particularly good book for teenage women who may be able to identify with the main character.  Further, it raises judgement and moral questions that can be both personal and universal.  In other words, I believe it is an entertaining book that makes you think!  I recommend!!
B0039N74CW|5.0|Such a cute movie for all ages. Finding the 1st Shrek isn't all that easy. My little grandson is really into all things Shrek. One of the few words he can say. This was a great price so I got two copies. One for my house and one for his.
B005EHQGTS|5.0|I've long been intrigued by the remote control apps, but wasn't willing to pay a premium to learn whether they'd meet my needs. In the interim, as a teacher, I've used Dropbox to ensure that I have the files I need in the classroom available. This app should allow me to greatly expand my use of files on my laptop, especially in those situations where the classroom discussion takes us down a path that I didn't expect. The streaming aspect works great, and it opens programs that I've wanted on my Acer Iconia (but that don't have Android versions)seamlessly. This could make a number of Android desktop software apps obsolete...
B0015AARJI|1.0|Service was great no no complaints as far as that goes but the product was a fake and doesnt work anymore  Should of sent it back but didnt want to go through the hassle just a heads up
B004O3YGMC|5.0|I can't believe how easy this is to use on the Kindle Fire. Worth every cent when you don't feel like going to your Pc.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Mobility Ware's Solitaire app is a good example of a free app done RIGHT. The ads are just noticeable enough to make serious users ponder getting a paid version, but are easily ignored by casual users who don't intend to upgrade.  The controls are responsive and intuitive. The backgrounds and card backs are really a nice touch. You can even use your own graphics! What an excellent add-on.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Love this awesome time waster (and I mean that in the best possible way!).  Quick and easy with enough options to change it up every so often.
B005HSL626|3.0|I'm giving this game three stars, because it IS pretty fun and a clever use of Android's touchscreen capabilities.  However, it loses one star for the obtrusive ads. I've seen worse, mind you, but I've also seen ads done MUCH better. I get that developers want you to want the paid version and semi-annoying ads will do that for them - BUT it's hard to get into a game enough to WANT the paid version when you're too busy being annoyed by the ads to enjoy the free version you're trying out!  I'm also removing one star because this game isn't really the best for resistive screens - which is what my Android device has. Those on capacitive screens are likely to get more enjoyment out of it.
B0064BCNA4|4.0|This app really reminds me of the scene from BIG with Tom Hanks and the piano keyboard on the floor when they play chopsticks. If you like to \\"tinkle on the keys\\" or have small children who like to play a bit, it is a great app. On the Kindle Fire I cannot get more than 2 keys to play at the same time. Not sure if that is a Fire issue or the app. Also, either the app or the Fire is not very responsive, I would tend to blame the hardware, but you will not play anything fast with this - at least not on a Fire. I had downloaded the free version, but when I saw the Pro as the free app of the day, I upgraded. It is fine for simple songs, and for fun. I mainly downloaded it originally to use it to tune my guitar (later found am app JUST for that that works better) but the point is still there - it would work for that. This won't turn your device into a $2000 KORG synth, but it is well priced, and fun. As far as the single octave goes, if you tried to fit many more keys on the screen, it would not work well on such small screens. If you have a 10\\" screen, good for you, but I believe this app was designed to fit the average screen sizes of 7\\" or less so it would be portable and fun.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|A great classic game - The one and only Angry Birds! The Ad-supported Free version is a great way to test out the waters and see if this game is up your alley OR to enjoy the game for free if it's only an occasional diversion for you. The ads are unobtrusive and don't get in the way or annoy you. I highly recommend you give this game a try. What have you got to lose?
B005H0IW6W|5.0|\\"The Christmas holidays have always been my favorite time of year. Each Christmas I am brought back to warm childhood memories, of family, friends and people all over the world being a little kinder. As a kid I remember Bing Crosby's Christmas record being played over and over again in our house throughout the holidays. Truth to be told, it was a record that introduced me to jazz and inspired me to become a musician.\\" ~ Michael Buble ~<br /><br />Between 2001 and 2011, Michael Buble and his remarkable albums have garnered nominations for various awards such as Grammy for Best Traditional Pop Vocal Album which he won in 2008 for [[ASIN:B000NVIXDW Call Me Irresponsible]] and in 2010 for [[ASIN:B0028T6XXY Michael Buble Meets Madison Square Garden (CD/DVD)]]. The other non-Grammy nominations and awards include Juno, American Music Award, National Jazz Award, Billboard Music Award, and the list goes on. After the release of his recent Christmas album, he has been very visible on TV shows promoting his latest seasonal offering. His Christmas Special at NBC was aired last week and will be shown again on the 21st of this month. He was also a guest at Saturday Night Live where he performed one of the liveliest songs here, \\"Holly Jolly Christmas.\\"<br /><br />This recording is another fabulous project spearheaded by uber producer David Foster with the support of Humberto Gatica, Bob Rock, Al Schmitt, Alan Broadbent, Pat Williams, Don Sebesky, a roster of great musicians, guest singers like The Puppini Sisters, Shania Twain and Thalia.<br /><br />The disc's most appealing tracks include ingenious Big-Band-reworked Christmas staples such as \\"Blue Christmas,\\" \\"Santa Claus Is Coming To Town\\" and a splendid version of \\"Jingle Bells\\" performed with The Puppini Sisters. And also mellow and contemplative deliveries of \\"Ave Maria,\\" \\"Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas,\\" \\"It's Beginning To Look A Lot Like Christmas,\\" \\"I'll Be Home For Christmas\\" and \\"Silent Night\\" which features a Children's Choir.<br /><br />In his 2007 Christmas album, [[ASIN:B000VE4DPS Let It Snow]],  Michael Buble's \\"Grown Up Christmas List\\" includes...\\"No more lives torn apart, that wars would never start, time would heal our hearts, every man would have a friend, that right would always win, and love would never end...\\" But in this album, his Christmas list to \\"Santa Baby\\" (Buddy/Pally) includes a \\"Rolex, '65 Blue Convertible, Yacht, Deed to Platinum mine, Canucks (hooray!)

B000244FDW|4.0|This 1980 BBC miniseries adaptation of Jane Austen's classic romance novel \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" offers nearly five hours of good costume drama, location shooting in the English countryside, and a solid cast led by Elizabeth Garvie as the spirited Lizzie Bennet, whose feud with the proud Mr. Darcy (David Rintoul) is the core of the story.<br /><br />As fans know, the story begins with the arrival of the young, wealthy and single Mr. Bingley and his friends to take possession of the estate of Netherfield Park.  Their near-neighbors the Bennets, with five unmarried daughters, are anxious to meet Mr. Bingley and his friend Mr. Darcy at a country dance.  Misadventure at the dance lays the groundwork for a complicated relationship between Lizzie and Mr. Darcy.<br /><br />The length of the mini-series allows for inclusion of most of the dialogue from the novel, especially the interactions among the Bennets.  The series is perhaps a little challenged in delivering Lizzie's internal dialogue, while the stiff and silent Mr. Darcy doesn't get much chance to earn the sympathy of the audience until late in the production.  Inevitably, this production gets compared with the 1995 Grenada TV version with Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle, and with the 2005 movie version starring Kiera Knightley and Matthew McFaydon.  Fans of the novel should take this BBC version on its own merits; recommended.
B005UDD1R6|4.0|The design of this player is really good.  However, when used on the Kindle Fire to play my own mp4 files of films and shows there is a major problem. The problem is that mp4-encoded films that are in widescreen format are force-fitted to the Fire's screen in a way that messes up the displayed aspect ratio.  All the films that I have tried to play were rendered with an aspect ratio that was about 16% too \\"tall\\", causing everything to look stretched vertically. For instance, a film with a true aspect ratio (correctly rendered from the same mp4 file as 2.385:1 on my PC and on an iPad) was rendered on the Fire as 2.068:1.  Another film that had a true aspect ratio of 2.237:1 was rendered as 1.987:1. I find this \\"squeezing\\" of the image to be so annoying that I have given up trying to watch films on the Fire using my own mp4 files.  (Amazon-coded films, bought from Amazon, do not suffer from this problem.)  I suspect that the root cause lies within Amazon's code, not in this particular app, since the same problem occurs with the Fire's native video player.  However, I make this comment here in the hope that the developer of this app will put pressure on Amazon to either (a) fix the underlying problem, or (b) tell them how to correct for the issue within the video player app.
B000056JYC|5.0|... but I never really stopped listening to the lp album then the original release cd.  You know how listening to music can take you back in time and link up with other explorations of the songs?  This new release melds with the good times of the past and forges new memories as it includes extra songs and the sound quality is superb.

1907360425|1.0|Hello Amazon,  im sorry but your website presentation while shopping for books is useless. All I wanted was a paperback set of Jane Austen books. Seems simple enough. Apparently not, the first set brought up says paperback in the title but way later the actual description claims it is an audio book???<br /><br />The customer reviews, supposedly for this book, were a mix of reviews from 6 different Jane Austen products. Hardback, paperback, video, etc.<br /><br />The actual description of the title was so buried in screen after screen of add ons, reviews, additional suggestions, etc it took awhile to find and then it was not a review of the product but an overall review of Jane Austen books. Most of the Jane Austen sets and compilations did not even list what titles were included. Come on folks!  You would think that would be common sense information.<br /><br />Amazon Management - Please Read This. Thanks
B006FE17Q6|5.0|I loved Season 1, but I have to say that Season 2 is even better. I love how it is more character driven rather than simple shock value.  This is my favorite series on TV right now.
B00005B1W5|5.0|A truely outstanding performance combining two special places (the Taj Mahal and the Forbidden City) together with the artistry of Yanni. It all makes for a special one of a kind DVD.

The poem at the end of the chapter about my north node has been a mantra for me that has gotten me through some tough times.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|The Harry Potter complete 8 Film Collection truly is awesome.  The DVD's itself come in one package that hold all 8 films, almost like a book.  The individual films have the same look as the original film covers.  The first 5 or so have no previous, which is nice and the special features on the DVD's are the ones that are on the original DVD's as well.  There areno extra DVD with special features included, which is totally fine with us.  There are rumors that another collection will come out with more special features, but we can only recommend this product!  You will definitely enjoy it.

B004IK8Q86|4.0|This is strictly a review of the Kindle edition of W. Somerset Maugham's 1943 novel, The Razor's Edge, which I read when I was in High School, after seeing the Hollywood version, starring Tyrone Power, when Tyrone Power was still making movies. I knew immediately that it was first published during WW II because our family copy was printed in a fashion which used as little paper as possible, to preserve that resource for the war effort. This is not great fiction, but it is good fiction, well worth reading as a description of American expatriots between the wars, in Paris. A nice counterpoint to Hemingway's The Sun Also Rises (Power stars in the film of that one too).<br /><br />This is a very good Kindle edition, which appears to have been converted to electronic from by the publisher, Random House. That may explain the high price. It is unusual to see the Kindle edition be more expensive than the paperback. Even for new books, it is usually the other way around. I bought this edition because I wanted to use a quote from in in a paper I was writing, and this edition had the hard copy page numbers (Official Academia, in the form of The Chicago Manual of Style, has not yet come to terms with electronic editions which do not have page numbers.) As usual, I had a quote which I thought was from this novel, and wanted to search this to cite it in my work.<br /><br />As luck would have it, either I simply did not remember the context well enough to find it, or, it was a line in the film which was not in the book, or it was in a different book / film entirely. But, I enjoyed the search, rereading large chunks of the novel.<br /><br />If you are price conscious, I suggest you get the Vintage paperback. If you must have the Kindle version, this one has no blemishes I could find.
B0068AWQQ2|2.0|This is the first movie I've rented/streamed online from the Amazon website. $1.99 was just fine: cheaper, of course, than a DVD rental or seeing it in the theatres. Nevertheless, I'm disappointed in the flick and didn't have fun with it.  Here are some various thoughts:  - I think it's fine that Peter Vincent was a magician/illusionist....but I was very-much hoping that that would be a part of it in someway. I was picturing a creative illusion or trickery that, in some way, fooled at least one of the vampires and led to its demise. I think that would have been awesome. Even though that didn't happen, lil' Petey's just a foul mouthed jerk and totally unlikable. A full-of-himself, ignorant, gross, alcoholic worm -- the worst part of the flick and totally opposite of the awesome Roddy McDowell and his distinguished representation of Mr. Vincent.  - My favourite part here was actually quite tame: when Jerry was wanting Charlie's beer, but he couldn't come into the house since he wasn't invited. Charlie was 'testing' him...and Jerry couldn't even stick his hand in the doorway to reach for the beer, making it more obvious that something was amiss.  - Jerry causing the house of the Brewster's to explode because he couldn't get invited in (and nobody in the neighbourhood noticing). Give me a break. As well, the Brewster's didn't even seem to care much afterwards that they lost everything!  - Amy is just eye-candy, as is the mom. For the women in the audience, Jerry would be as well...but they are all disposable characters that are boring and smile too much.  - Ed (aka 'Evil') was just a normal nerd and within the first few minutes he comes out and tells Charlie that Jerry is a vampire. It was better when Charlie was trying to convince 'Evil' and others that there was a a vampire living next to him. What about Ed's evidence? I saw Charlie checking it out on the Ed's computer after Ed was killed -- but it seemed to show nothing of interest. Ed should have had more of a part,as he was kinda cool to this nerd.  - They say that Chris Sarandon (the original Jerry in the 1985 version) made an appearance but I didn't notice. Oh well. 12.21 UPDATE: He's the driver who pulled-up to see what was going on and was bitten by the new Jerry Dandrige. I had no clue; of course he didn't look like he did over 25 years ago, yet he didn't sound the same either.  - Dandrige was duller than a lone razor in a barber shop. He didn't change form into a bat or wolf, which vampires did in the original; had no scary/appropriate voice; died fast and bored  me even faster. Well, at least he still eats the apples. An apple a day keeps the dentist away (that's how the saying should go, as I've learned that's more accurate). Does he go to a nighttime dentist if there's such a thing? Do vampires get cavities? That's one question I'd love to have answered and another expectation that was a letdown in this flick. (Don't be ridiculous and take that serious).  - Charlie 'gearing-up' was cool and his idea which came to fruition at the end was pretty-cool. It was the only thing of originality. I liked how it ended Dandridge and it was worthwhile -- yet it all happened too quickly and there wasn't much suspense. The CGI looked like garbage, too, throughout the flick and some of the other vampire's endings were very \\"Buffy, the Vampire Slayer\\"-like (of course, being written by Marti Noxon as well, I think that would be expected).     Anyway, \\"Welcome to 'Fright Night'...for fake.\\" should be the tag line for this. Go ahead and rent it online. It can be passable at occasional moments, but I didn't enjoy it. CGI is not good for this re-imagining and non-computer effects would have been better. It's completely not a horror flick and barely makes two stars.
B0034G4P9E|5.0|There wasn't a lot of buzz for this movie, but I knew that it was going to be good, just based on the dvd promo that I saw. It was more than good. The action is off the charts, it looks so real that it feels like your watching a live mma fight taking place. The movie is wrought with emotions. Taking you from fear, to Hatred, to Love, and finally forgiveness. Instantly one of my favorite movies.
B000ATQYT2|5.0|I was so pleased to receive this movie so quick! I wanted it to be a surprise for my children, but wasn't sure if it would arrive on time for our trip for them to watch it in the car!

B001AQR3JY|5.0|This dvd is great highly recommended for all ages.  I never saw the broadway show or the movie when it came to movie theathers or was on tv it is just great.  even my four year old niece will sit through it.
B004EPYZT4|5.0|First let me say I'm not a \\"Professional Movie Reviewer\\" as some here appear to be or think they are .  I'm just an old guy who read the series years ago and has seen all the older movies where Conan is portrayed as a BIG DUMB blood thirsty guy . I found this movie very entertaining, had no trouble following the plot (it does have one too)  or scene changes, as some appear to have had . Momoa portrays a Conan who really could have existed, and does a great job doing it . If you watch this movie without the expectation of seeing the overblown blood splashes of the early films, or a BIG DUMB Conan stumbling along, I think you will really enjoy this one more than any of the  others .
B0008ENHUI|3.0|This is a masterpiece no doubt. The acting is fantastic. The story intelligent. The setting amazing. I'm only giving it 3 stars because if I was asked by a close friend if s/he should watch this I would say no - because it's too painful. There's enough pain in the world already.
B006NXIO0Q|5.0|I always saw Zoe in other movies and never thought this character fit her.  Well I gave it a five star so check it out!!  very good movie with strong points!
B003R4ZMNQ|5.0|I was a fan of the original series. When the new series aired, it was more bolder than the original. It will stand at he same level as the original. There are few seies that can be remade, and be just as sucessful as the Original Series, and Hawaii Five O is one of them.
B0063IH60K|5.0|this is such an easy and quick game to play while waiting in lines or just killing time. I'd recommend it to anyone who likes solitaire.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|This is another amazing movie from the Kendrick brothers and Sherwood pictures. I honestly wasn't convinced initially by the trailer I saw, and probably would have passed it up were it not for the fact that I wanted to support these guys because I have appreciated all of their other movies, and I figured that even if this one fell a bit flat, I still wanted to support their work. Well, turns out this is, in my opinion, their most powerful movie yet. If you go into viewing the movie as a critic, you will undoubtedly come up with finding all kinds of flaws. But if you go to receive, with an open heart and mind to God, this can be life changing, as it was for me, especially if you read The Resolution afterward! (also by the Kendricks, with Randy Alcorn). (By the way, if you want confirmation of what I'm saying here by numbers, you need go no further than Rotten Tomatoes, which currently has \\"the critics'\\" score at 37%, as opposed to 93% for the viewing population as a whole).
1419702238|5.0|I bought this book as a stocking stuffer for my 10 year-old son. I read it before wrapping it and thought it was really good. Very funny and entertaining. [[ASIN:1432743406 Smitty's Cave Adventures]]
B0036T32LQ|5.0|I watched this moving without reading too much of what is was about ahead of time but I knew right from the start something weird was going to happen.  This was a great move. I love the way the story unfolded and even the ending was a bit of a surprise. If you like thrillers and a bit of mystery than I think you will enjoy this movie.

0385534639|4.0|Although I usually read \\"historical fiction\\", and generally avoid \\"fantasy\\", I really enjoyed this story. It is well written, as well. Although I did not have a strong attachment to the characters, I did not find that as important as I usually do concerning most books I read.
B006N0YWGY|5.0|Works great in kindle  fire. Fun game, silly premise. Hours of entertainment. The graphics are well done, the music is annoying but I mute almost all games.

B003Z0D4SM|1.0|This is a comment to the publisher: why are your eBook prices higher than the paperback? I could buy the hardcover edition for the same price as the Kindle copy. C'mon. This is not the way to encourage digital sales. Your eBook prices should be half the cost of the real deal. I remain disappointed with such exploitive pricing.
0439023521|1.0|I ran across this book online and got caught up in the story, so I purchased it so I could finish it. I was sooo disappointed. Not in the ending (which it doesn't really even have), but in the way it was written. There was so much room for suspense that was simply written off. Yes, there was a lot of excitement, but I hated the situation with Cato at the end of the Games - mostly because of the wolf-humans. That just didn't flow with the rest of the book. I get the mockingjays, and those killer insects, but not the wolf-humans. That was just dumb. I also didn't like that there were so many of the characters that were never fully developed. I understand that there are arguments for each of the things that I don't really care for, but this is just my opinion. I also expected to hear more from the sponsors. There was a lot built up about them, but then they really didn't do much. The confrontation with the packs with each district's number on it was disappointing as well. It all went by too quickly. They would have spent more time trying to figure out how to catch each other getting their packs. I was also hoping to see more ingeniuity used as far as traps and things go - just from how she led up to the games talking about it so much - at least more than one net and one booby trap using land mines.   I guess I wanted the book to be longer and more detailed, focusing on the time spent on the woods. Sometimes it seemed like the author just wanted to say that they were dead and move on.  Did anyone else see it this way?
B005CRQ2IU|5.0|First off this is a review of the \\"Kindle Only\\" version, not the comic itself which amazingly perfect. I highly recommend the comic to everyone.<br /><br />However DO NOT purchase this flawed Kindle version. As an owner of an iPad 2 I do not wish to purchase a Kindle, and I probably never will purchase one. The Kindle app does everything the Kindle fire does as far as reading books, so WHY in Amazon's infinite brilliance decide to make this and a number of other comics Kindle Fire only?<br /><br />I was SO excited to see this was now available for the Kindle only to have my excitement stomped on by a stupid and idiotic mistake on Amazon's part.<br /><br />Hey Amazon,my iPad 2 looks, works, and is better than your \\"Fire\\" allow me to read comics on MY device not your crippled and hobbled android clone.<br /><br />***UPDATE 6/20/12***<br /><br />I have updated the review to give 5-stars after Amazon realized their error (or wanted more money, lol) and have begun selling graphic novels inside the iPad Kindle app.<br /><br />After working with Amazon tech support I was able to download and reread the book again. It looks amazing in digital, and now I can read this amazing novel where ever I go!!<br /><br />Thank you for offering this Amazon!!
B005CW5E3E|5.0|Back when Winters was doing Rock and Blues was always the best of his music, have been a fan for 44 years now, his recording career began when he was just fifteen, when his first serious band \\"Johnny and the Jammers\\" released a single \\"School Day Blues\\" on a Houston record label.During this same period, he was able to see performances by classic blues artists from and around the State, such as Muddy Waters, B.B. King, Howlin' Wolf and Bobby \\"Blue\\" Bland. In the early days Winter would sometimes sit in with Roy Head and The Traits when they performed in the Beaumont, Texas area (where he was born), and in 1967 he released his first album under a local Austin, Tx label (Sonobeat), his band was then called \\"The Progressive Experiment\\". When he was playing live in the many, many clubs on 6th street (from which one can see the Capital Building and The University of Texas), Edgar would sit in with the band once in a while, always enjoyed Johnny's style than when his brother would lead the band.   With Roots, that is exactly what he has gone back to, the Blues, this new album reminds me of those days, then later when he recorded \\"Tobacco Road\\" a very nice rendition of and older blues songs. This new release is based on the Blues with the help of some extraordinary musicians, I highly recommend this CD!
B000MR9D5E|5.0|I bought this set for my autistic cousin who is around 8 years old.  He loves them.  He can hum all the music throughout the whole movie.  I wish I could write more about the actual movies but it was a gift and I haven't seen all of them.  All I can say is he loves dinosaurs and he was going to be learning about other animals in school.  We decided to get this set to show him about different species.  He sits down and watches them all the time, over and over again, and he can tell you about any animal on there.  I did watch one of them and its not normally my thing, but I was so hooked!  So glad we got these!
1451648537|3.0|I received this book, bought for a gift, and found that a group of pages were not cut properly.  This does not present a good image to the person for whom it was bought.  I chose not to cut the pages for fear of \\"messing\\" them up.  Very disappointed!
B0018TLRTK|5.0|I've loved Billy Idol since I was young. Heard the song John Wayne when he was on Kimmel or Leno and knew it was him right away! Got the album and then went to see him in concert in Chicago. The new songs are great! Speed is fantastic, Super Overdrive is incredible and New Future Weapon he wrote when watching a documentary about the F22 Raptor! Worth a listen.
B0044IJ1S6|4.0|I'll start by saying, I'm not a Die Hard Depeche Mode fan. I grew up and love them, but..  After watching this a many times now..(can't help myself), I am appreciating DM more and more...   These guys have been around for so long and still amazing at what they do.   This performance of 'Come Back' is so beautiful and amazing.. It's better than any other I have heard. 'Wrong' is also one of my favorite on this DVD.  However, I couldn't appreciate some of Martin's solo stuff as much..  The music and performance was 100% wonderful and wished I was there in person to witness after seeing/hearing it...  Now, for the actual Video / Audio production..For such renown powerful artists to have gotten this opportunity screwed by sloppy production work.. amazes me that they weren't sued.   The video work for this concert was terrible.. . I would have sued them.   To much behind the crowd effect. It's alright once in a while, but... after seeing peoples hands in your face all the time makes you think ..\\"Why?\\". Most importantly, the video/lighting/closeups made David look really bad in some songs.. . Especially Martin..   The Audio just doesn't sound as good as it should/could. It's not terrible, but iv'e got many options for my audio decoder and nothings really sounds that great...   This is the part that gets me the most, when DM are playing songs with the crowds singing, you can't hear the crowd and it looks like he can't get them to sing. You'll see what I mean.  Was the DVD worth buying?...  101% YES  Could the Audio/Video been better? 100% YEs  I collect Blue-ray concerts..Im comparing it to 'U2 at the Rose bowl', 'Incubus Alive at Red Rocks', 'Jon Mayer' amazing performances...(All a must own-if you like them)  Dave Mathews (SUCKED*) I gave that Blue-ray away...   Hope this info helped someone decide...
0525951652|5.0|Fall of Giants is an amazing read! If you like history and you like fiction this book is one for you. While many of the characters, places, and events existed there are also many of the same elements created to go along with the flow of the book. The details are amazing and the characters are well developed and seem almost alive. I can't wait for the two books that are to follow and only hope that they are just as good as the first one.
B0019HQIFE|5.0|I have this one back home in USA... Im buying another here because it was such a nice performance to watch.  The sound in this was very nicely done. The video is also good.

B003ELOQD4|5.0|110% worth getting in Blue-ray...   I collect Blue-ray concerts.  They did a fabulous performance. It's up there with the best.. The sound is amazing.   Mine got stolen on a trip and will be buying it again.
B006O5Y0SS|4.0|If you like well written, acted, and directed fantasies, this is a  movie for you.

Great casting also!
1933633867|5.0|Former Yales professor David Graeber takes issue with traditional economists' assumptions about theories of money and debt, which assumes that money rose out of barter, and debt rose out of money. This highly readable history, taken from the perspective of anthropology, shows that debt is as old as human society and predates the more modern concept of money as a means of exchange. Graeber shows how debt is an inherent aspect of our most basic human interactions and how currency evolved out of the need for exchange between strangers or enemies. Most interestingly, the invention of coinage seems to have coincided with professional armies and the emergence of our familiar ethical and moral systems of thought. This is a great read for those who prefer to sniff suspiciously at some of the treasured axioms of neoclassical economics.

0307279189|5.0|I can not begin to say how many great feelings I got from reading this amazing story of adventure and research. If you are not a runner, then you may want to try something that you always hated and begin to understand the true definition of the utimate runners high after reading this book. This book simply changed my perspective on so many things about running. I have been runnning for 20 years and this book came to me at the right time. The barefoot running part of this book is something that has changed the sneaker industry, but is really a small part of what is important about this book. It reminds us what it is that is really important about running and what is important about humans as people that makes us all very interesting.  It helped me turn the page of measuring my runs with time over distance and just enjoying the exploration of running, especially when it comes to getting off the roads. I could attempt a long philosophical explanation as to why I love this book, but I won't. Lets say that this is a story about a great adventure and if you happen to be a runner while reading it, you will enjoy it that much more.
B000TPZJNE|4.0|The sound of this pressing is very high quality and worth the money if you're really into analog sound and have a setup that can do this justice. While I can't tell much of a difference between this remaster and the 2003 remaster that went onto SACD, it is certainly a welcome addition to the collection since I never had DSOTM on an analog source before.   The only gripe I have is that the free download is only offered in the inferior MP3 format. This makes no sense to me, as I assume that anyone who is willing to shell out $30+ for an album on 180 gram audiophile grade vinyl is probably someone who cares very much about the quality of their audio sources. Does it make sense to sell the highest possible quality record with a free download that is of less than CD quality? They couldn't either include a free CD or maybe a .flac download instead? That is kind of confusing and a bit insulting to my audiophile intelligence.  But otherwise, a must buy for the lover of analog.
B0065IA4F2|2.0|After Thank Me Later I knew Drake was going to bring the heat. But unfortunatly i did not feel any heat on this album just a bunch of jibberish and repetitiveness. This is my honest review, I became a huge drake fan after hearing his mix tape then hearing his debut album. I can't pretend to like Take Care when I don't. I think drake maybe has gotten too big headed, I think he needs to go back to the drawing board and remember the music and lyrics that made him popular to begin with.  I don't feel any of the magic that I got from Thank Me Later, obviously alot of others like it but i think once time has passed I don't think this album will age as well as Thank Me Later...

1593072937|5.0|This is the first and best of Frank Miller's Sin City graphic novels. Originally published in 1992, the first edition was simply entitled Sin City. It was later named The Hard Goodbye to distinguish it from the later stories in the series. Here we are introduced to the incomparable character of Marv--a big ugly psychotic lowlife with a heart of gold. Marv wakes up next to a dead hooker who just gave him the night of his life. In gratitude for his good fortune he vows to track down her murderer, even if he has to torture and kill everyone who stands in his way. Miller plucks the choicest cliches from every gritty noir thriller of the past three-quarters of a century, then exaggerates and magnifies them until they meld into something totally original and exhilarating. Miller simultaneously critiques and revels in America's love affair with violence in pop culture. Through Marv's interior monologue we are allowed entrance into the mind of this brutal antihero who possesses the mind of a child, the loyalty of a faithful dog, and the blood lust of a maniac. It is a testament both to Miller's skill as a writer and to the depravity of our violence-jaded culture that we can root so enthusiastically for this demented sadist. The effect is truly liberating. Reading The Hard Goodbye is a ride like no other.  In the past two decades so many artists have copied Miller's stark black and white art that it's difficult to remember just how shockingly original this style was when these comics first came out. I remember seeing this book for the first time, as someone who had enjoyed superhero comics for most of my life, and thinking it was like nothing I had ever seen before. Miller's work still stands as superior to all his imitators. The art of Sin City pays homage to the classic newspaper comics of masters like Milton Caniff and Will Eisner, yet Miller pares down the imagery to its sparsest elements, distilling each panel until it resembles something like a Japanese woodblock print. Though he takes plenty of liberties with human anatomy, Miller's ingenious manipulation of positive and negative space would make this book an excellent supplemental text for an undergraduate drawing course. Of course, it wouldn't be politically correct to use the book for such a purpose because the story is so delightfully perverse.  Judging from Miller's art, I always thought Marv was a black man until Mickey Rourke was cast to play him in the movie. Rourke turned out to be an excellent choice, and the movie did justice to this great story. There's still a few scenes here that never made it into the film, however, and Miller's fabulous art alone makes it worthwhile to experience this story in its original form. For comics enthusiasts, this is one of those modern masterpieces you must own. Even if you don't normally read comics, if you like hard-boiled crime stories of any media, you'll love this book. Of all Frank Miller's Sin City stories, this is the one essential must-have.
0062112430|3.0|I liked this book, but it's not the kind of book you read in one sitting. There really wasn't much urgency to it, and the plot seemed to meander until the last fifty or so pages. But I was able to enjoy the story while I read it and thought the love-is-a-disease twist was a bit catchy.
B0052UZIFA|2.0|I love the game, but it freezes on the Galaxy Nexus. Please fix this as soon as possible! Otherwise it's 5 stars!

0385523904|5.0|I am a voracious reader of the internet on a daily basis, but rarely to I dig completely into a book.  I came across this book in reading articles about Kim Jong-Il's passing, went to Amazon and read the first chapter and had to have it.  I read it in roughly a day and devoured it.  I just could NOT put it down.  First book I've read in ages.  The humanity of the stories are soul crushing and the heart of the people is undeniable.  The genius of this book is the way the non-fictional realities of North Korea are woven into the humanity of each of the characters, transporting the reader, not just to a list of disheartening governmental oppression, but into the reality of day to day North Korean existence.  It's nearly impossible to not feel you are in this socialist country, burdened by totalitarian hardship, somewhat fearful both for the fates of the characters and yourself!  Thank you Ms. Demick for such a rare gift:  A truly personal look into the mysterious world of North Korea and a glance behind the window of some of the darkness of humanity itself.
0062014951|2.0|I was not very familiar with Patti Smith or the cultural atmosphere around her art, and picked this book with much hopeful and exciting anticipation.  I must say that there parts, i.e., her poems particularly, that really shine, and got me excited, and I was very impressed by her natural talent and innocent dedication to her arts as well as her heartbreaking and complex relationship with Maplethorp. There are alot of facts about the time, place and people in the world of her transformation into an intriguing artist but they are written rather dry and boring, almost like a list after list.  My discontent lies in the lack of depth and exploration into her personal and artistic psyche, almost feels as if she was witholding something intentionally.  Although you get the sense about their relationship, she doesn't really invite you to the deeper level of understanding.  And....so much routine name dropping...some parts read like the first chapter of the gospel according to Matthew---so and so was there, and so and so and so and so....  If you don't know who they are, then it doesn't matter, and if you do, it doesn't matter either, because you already know. I was disappointed in the end, and barely got through the book.
B0063IH60K|4.0|really a good app. ads are not annoying to deal with on free version.  glad there's an auto complete button
B001UV4XIS|5.0|Enjoyed it thoroughly!!  Better than the first part!! i felt as though I was a part of the action, helping out!!!
B005HSG3U6|4.0|I like this cover.  It is lightweight as promised, which is nice because the Kindle Fire is heavier than I thought it would be.  It holds the kindle in it nicely.  I like the elastic strap to close the cover.  It does seem to leave a mark on the screen where the crack of the top cover is, hoping that will be not as noticable when I get the screen protector put on.
B002QKZLZ6|5.0|I really like this case for my Plantronics Bluetooth headset. The problem with the Voyager Pro is that it is easily damaged unless you have it in the case to protect it. For example the earpiece on my Voyager Pro broke a couple of times. This is because I am always putting it in and taking them out of my backpack, and throwing it around in my car.  I ordered this little case the other day hoping that it would protect my Voyager Pro and make it easier to find. I tend to lose Bluetooth headsets. Anyway, this case fits the Voyager Pro perfectly. I could not be happier. It also has a belt clip on it so you can clip it to your belt, but I like it because I can put it in my backpack and I do not have to worry about breaking my Bluetooth again. It also helps me keep up with my Bluetooth because I just keep it with my keys or my backpack and with the clip on the back of it, I can clip it to my visor in the car. That way my Bluetooth is not falling between the seats with me breaking the earpiece again.  I do not think you can go wrong with this case, especially considering how expensive the Plantronics Voyager Pro is.
B005COO1X6|4.0|I would've given this 3.5 stars if that were possible but I rounded up being that I am a truly devoted King fan.  I really enjoyed this story and it's classic horror, everything's not what it seems plot line. But the ending left me feeling let down and agitated. I want to know more!  It's just not enough for me to feel like I \\"finished\\" the story.  If there was a sequel I'd be much happier; but as it stands it just left me feeling empty on the last page. However, up until that point, it's a good read and King is still an awesome story teller.
B005V1WVPA|5.0|This is the second time man! Anyways, I wont use any curse words, that was my bad.. this album is superb..very Kornish..beem a fan since the beginning (hardcore fan). Even if You are new to this stuff (my gan&ster friends lol) you should like it..its just appealing..I am a lifelong fan of Korn, with the exception of 2 albums, I thinK korn is the best band in the world..But everyone won't agree, but who cares what they think, buy the album 4 whatever.. It is appealing to ALL types of people :)  Whether your a thug, metal head,  newbie or whatever..  Yes I bought this from b*** B** the place thay sells cd players etc lol
B001F12J0C|5.0|These three movies are so great!  Full of action, mystery even a little romance! I would definately recommend the three to anyone that likes action, adventure movies. Matt is so handsome and is right in the middle of all the action!!! Get it! Get it! Everything I have purchased from Amazon has been Top-Notch!
B005IZLPMY|5.0|WOW, what a great movie to watch on a pizza night.Great character development. I would recommend this movie for a large range of different ages. THis opinion is from a fifteen year old.
145551389X|3.0|Although this is a beautiful book, there are a few things that stop it being as fabulous as it could have been. There is no text - no dates, no comments, nothing! Just the occasional note from Gaga would have made it a much more worthwhile buy. Also, there is the problematic notion of supporting Terry Richardson, a photographer with a reputation that's not exactly sterling. If you want a big, beautiful book that's also informative I would suggest [[ASIN:1402788924 Gaga]]- it doesn't have the hipster cache of this one, but it has just as many great shots and a lot more information.
B005KJZDXK|1.0|Zooey had a great opportunity to create a Christmas album to coincide with the movie ELF. She had many fans like myself who have been waiting for years for a Christmas album with all the great songs from the movie. I myself was looking forward to a recording of Auld Lang Syne which was never part of the original soundtrack. Instead, Zooey decided to take Christmas classics and convert them into guitar hippie songs. There is only so much you can tweak Christmas songs before they become ruined. Baby It's Cold Outside is probably the worst song on the CD. I'm not even sure how that's possible. This album is a classic example of what NOT to do when recording a Christmas album. Zooey needs to re-evaluate her singing career. Her voice is perfect for jazzy, blues, old time music. Until she figures that out, she has no business recording CD's  This album could have become a Christmas classic. Instead, it's going in the trash.

B006L15THG|5.0|Love this show but can't always get to watch it on Sunday nights. Yay for Amazon Instant video. Well worth the $1.99 investment so I can view whenever it's convenient but what sort of techno glitch happened at the end of this episode. It just seemed to stop in the middle of the last scene, not a good thing for a show that relies on the last scenes to set you up for the next episode. Not very worth the $1.99 to be left hanging
B0055SWM08|5.0|Love the music to this game. Very relaxing but your mind is in total consentration with this soothing music in the background. Worth more then $.99
B005KDWUFA|5.0|This is my new favorite IL DIVO cd with my new favorite song- Crying.  The whole sound of the cd seems different, with sort of a \\"cathedral echo\\".  While all of the voices are beautiful, as always; Sebastien fans, especially, are in for a treat!
B005LCYR7Y|5.0|I only started reading King about a year ago with Under the Dome, and have slowly been getting though some of his other works. I realise what I've been missing, initially thinking King's works were only horror/supernatural, I now know that he a a master story teller of the dystopian genre.  I downloaded 11.22.63 on holiday (being an Aussie/Brit, I have to think about the title and translate it from 22.11.63 in my mind!. I wasn't disappointed, and loved the references to early 60s culture (I was a toddler when JFK was shot) as well as the pure fantasy theme of time travel. Meticulously researched, great to read, and lots of unexpected turns. Well recommended. [[ASIN:B005LCYR7Y 11.22.63]]

B005ELQVGW|2.0|I am a huge fan of Bjork's earlier albums, but for me, this one was a step too far and I just didn't quite get it.  There is no doubting that Bjork as always deserves praise for her ambition and the fact she is always willing to try something new.  The concept of the album and the lengths she has gone to to push the boundaries of what we think of as an album are really impressive.  However, musically, this just isn't for me.    Based on the other reviews of the album on here, I am in the minority and as a Bjork fan, I am pleased that she still commands such a dedicated following, but Biophilia just didn't quite move me in the same way she has in the past.
0811879542|5.0|The book Press Here is delightful and fun. I was impressed with the creativity of the author. In fact because of that, I purchased several more books by the same author. My grandson is a bit too young for them now. Soon he will have the imagination to enjoy them.
B004EPZ084|5.0|This movie was unexpectedly funny, close up there with other classic comedies.  I would highly recomend this to anyone that is looking for a great laugh.  Jennifer Anniston may have stole the show with her \\"out of character\\" acting....overall - HYSTERICAL!

0446569909|4.0|This is a very entertaining book. Ozzy is very down to earth and his honesty is refreshing. We finally get his version of the dove and bat incidents. And I love the fact that he blames no one else on his poor decision making thru his life. I really only have two criticisms. I understand that he writes the way he talks (which is the way it should be), but do we really need to read 5 F-bombs on virtually every page? Just sayin'. And there is hardly any mention of where the musical ideas came from, either with Black Sabbath or as a solo artist. I would have liked MUCH more of that.
B005KJZDXK|5.0|After listening to the preview songs, I had to have this CD. Each of these classics are sung with Matt & Zooeys unique style. Love it!

B005N0PJJO|5.0|Second Books in series usually dont do it for me, they are usually a filler book and dont really have much of a point, however, Fifty Shades Darker DID NOT DISAPPOINT. It picked up right where it left off, after Ana left Christian and his weird sexual world making her decision that she is not cut out for his lifestyle. \\"Appearances can be deceptive,\\" he says quietly. \\"I'm anything but fine. I feel like the sun has set and not risen for five days, Ana. I'm in perpetual night here.\\"<br /><br />Christian approaches Ana with another proposition that she cant refuse. Christian and Ana's relationship blossoms in this book and Christian lets Ana on his biggest secret to prove his love to her. Ana knocks down some of Christian's well built walls and Christian finally learns to love. He is still possessive and bossy and wants things his way but he is trying...for Ana to change.<br /><br />Ana on the otherhand isnt sure that she can be all that Christian will ever need or want, no matter how much he tells her he has changed she just inst sure.\\"I thought--\\" He stops. \\"This is me, Ana. All of me... and I'm all yours. What do I have to do to make you realize that? To make you see that I want you any way I can get you.

0446614459|3.0|decent if one reads the book at least twice (* i'm on my second reading )   given ; it is maybe 200  pages too long , too many back and forth plot and sub plots as happens with many of mr   baldacci's books..   to all readers : don't blame the author so vehemently , many times the author sketches out the story line and may have a ghost writer   and editor do finishing up work , many times the author simply looks over finished manuscript without looking for detail..   mr baldacci should trim his books , and cut repetitions , saving about 90 pages..( see SixTH mAN - ANOTHER kING AND maxwell novel )   suggest mr baldacci hire a new editor who cares about his or her job ..   a bit surprised that many of his novels have only gotten 2 1/2 * ratings   though convoluted and contrived are used often , books should be read for simple pleasure , not cohesiveness , which is badly lacking    in many of mr baldacci's books..   mr baldacci's main problem is he writes a few too many series without thinking of ending them before they've run out of gas..   i.e. the camel club , king and maxwell series , the two volume whole truth /deliver us from evil , and now a potential new   series zero day ?..   suggest he finish off two of the above three series before he wanders off onto a new thriller series..   considering there are still some loose ends nedding conclusions in all 3 earlier series   i'll give mr baldacci credit though , he's not afraid to continue writing ...hopefully he doesn't take all negative  comments too   seriously , but many of his series could have been neatly tied up and finished in 3 books instead of 5-6..
B0009DBXXG|5.0|Being a life-long West Side Story fan, I was only able to view this documentary in pieces on YouTube. I find myself in tears every time Jose & Kiri sing 'One Hand, One Heart' because it is simply breathtaking.    If you have someone in your family that has an interest in music, musicals, opera, conducting, Broadway, Leonard Bernstein, West Side Story, ANY OF THE ABOVE, then get this for them. You will certainly make their year!
B005LZW8FO|5.0|...change you. All you have to do is look closer.   It was, by far, one of the most ethereal and captivating motion pictures I've seen recently. I like what it stood for, what the relationship between the two main characters paralleled with the appearance of a sudden, looming second Earth. I like how, while a sci-fi movie, and a rather inaccurate one at that, the \\"science\\" of it was more of the undertone of the story. That the premise was more about the universe to be found within our own selves, whether it's the prisons of guilt we lock ourselves behind or the fantasies we construct to escape. It truly immersed me into its layers...
B0061JPYX2|4.0|I only discovered Amy Winehouse's music after she died and was only vaguely aware of her before I heard the announcement of her death on NPR. I don't know why, but I then became interested and looked into her online. I was totally blown away by \\"Back to Black,\\" first the song, then the album, and after becoming convinced it was one of my favorite albums of all time, I listened to her debut album \\"Frank,\\" which I initially liked but have grown to love, at least many of the songs on the album, almost all of those her original material. As my title states, I haven't bought \\"Lioness: Hidden Treasures\\" yet, but I will because I've heard all the songs on it, and while I agree completely with buyers complaining that the album is poor when compared to her earlier masterpieces, hopefully, the money generated from sales of the album will go to a good cause, The Amy Winehouse Foundation, which, according to the Foundation's website, \\"has been set up in Amy's memory to support charitable activities in both the UK and abroad that provide help, support or care for young people, especially those who are in need by reason of ill health, disability, nancial disadvantage or addiction,\\" and I think most listeners will find something to like. I acknowledge that most of her fans consider the version of \\"Tears Dry on Their Own\\" on \\"Back to Black\\" the superior version, but I actually prefer her original take on the song, which is the version on \\"Lioness.\\" Finally, I think the album is worth having because it's a recording of Amy Winehouse and for me, even when she's not at her best, she's still pretty amazing.

B001VNB54A|3.0|After watching Band of Brothers a historic story of the European Campaign of Army's Easy Company I was more than excited when I heard there would be a series following the Marine Corps Island Hopping Campaign. Having served in the Marine Corps Infantry myself from 91'-98' we studied and heard the wars stories of \\"Chesty Puller\\" and the battles in Guadalcanal 1/1, Pelilu (sp). The series just doesn't do a great job of capturing the war at all. It jumps around quite a bit and spends too much in my opinion outside of the combat theater. I was disappointed it just followed the lives of just 3 Marines. I wanted a series I could watch over and over like I do with band of brothers. This was a one time series for me. I guess it was just too hard to follow in the \\"combat\\" boots of the first series.     I want to love it, just couldn't.  Semper Fi
0811879631|5.0|This book is simply gorgeous. The color scripts, as well as the concept artwork, are wonderful to look at and compare across time and to the final product in the movie. A must-have for any Pixar fan -- which should be all of us.
B004VYYA2K|3.0|I bought this item on this very site in October. I paid around $15.00. The item is fine for what it is - a plastic box to dump a pile of Barbies in and clear out some clutter. On the right day during the right sale you can get the Barbie vacation house for between $30.00 - $40.00 instead of this. Don't get taken just because it's Christmas.
B004I744AS|5.0|A good dictionary and free. The off-line mode means that I can use it even when I'm not online. Good dictionary. Good app. It also includes a very good thesaurus as well. What a deal!
B0063IH60K|5.0|Free version is great; small ad between each game is no big deal.  That's why it's free.  Plays easily - no tricks to learn to get the hang of it. It's just plain Solitaire and very enjoyable to play.  Smooth, easy, super.
B005GVW05Q|5.0|For the most part, the songs here are on the mellow side. We're treated to the passion Ryan Adams brings to every song. The combination of his voice, the lyrics, and the music stir my soul. This is not a CD I play for background music. This one demands and gets my full attention with each listen.
0026009102|5.0|I bought this as a gift for my son, and was impressed by the excellent condition (I swore it was brand new), and wanted to express my appreciation!  Thanks :)
B0063IH60K|4.0|this game is so much fun. I play nonstop. I just wish there were achievements like there are for the ipad.
0446573019|4.0|My title says it all.  There are a few new twists on a fairly common theme - a nuclear bomb, where it is and why it is there (hope I didn't ruin the plot for anyone).  I recommend this book for all readers but would refer readers new to Baldacci to The Camel Club.  And we have a new character somewhat different from his previous characters.
B00000JGOJ|5.0|I was introduced to Angelina Jolie in this film and was hooked. She's fabulous as the youngest daughter of Sean Connery and Gena Rowlands. Marital complications, personal apprehensions and wonderfully HUGE dogs and a one-eyed cat add to this quilt of family members' lives that segway through beautifully utilized sunrises and sunsets w/John Barry's flowing music. Madeline Stowe, Dennis Quaid, Jon Stewart, and several other castmembers round out a complex group of players dealing with careers, relationships and personal insecurities.  This is a keeper.  PS. Remember this, the next time you run for an elevator ;)
030726999X|5.0|Fast-paced, and well thought-out. You know Larsson had more of these coming. I wonder how many more books there would have been. I was alerted by the mention of Lisbeth's twin sister, and I feel like she was going to make an appearance further on in the series if they continued. All in all a brilliant story and protagonist, who I'm jealous I didn't come up with as a writer.<br /><br />Nicole Trilivas (Author of PRETTY GIRLS MAKE GRAVES: a pretty girl's ugly story told in borrowed voices)
B005MAHWN6|5.0|I don't know how it can be, but I first listened to this album in 2009 (more or less) about two years before it was published. It was in a kind of bar and I didn´t know the artist's name. The next day I googled for some of the songs I still could remember having heard the night before and came across the name Karen Souza. Since then every now and then I listened to her on Spotify and I repeatedly looked for an album of her, but it wasn`t until September 2011, that the announcement of Essentials reached me. I immedeately ordered the CD that was to be published in October, but due to some problems didn't get it until late November. After having waited for two years, this couldn't have bothered me less.  Essentials is a collection of always interesting and often surprising jazzy cover versions of carefully chosen great songs, that in original version are not jazzy at all. In my opinion some of them are true masterpieces, Radiohead's \\"Creep\\" and The Beatles' \\"Strawberry Fields\\" should be mentioned here. Versions of Soft Cell's \\"Tainted Love\\" and Depeche Mode's \\"Personal Jesus\\" are great as well. In my opinion, no cover versions should be made from already perfect songs, but Karen always manages to add something. This way you never have the feeling that she tried herself at songs too big for her. And in every single song on this album her extraordinarily warm and soft voice fills the room with a most comfortable atmosphere.    The only thing I sometimes miss is her freaking out a bit, just a little bit, but I guess I have to wait for her next studio album. I patiently will.  This album makes a perfect present too. Whether you give it to someone interested in Jazz, to someone who likes the original versions (easy), to someone who likes listening to relaxing music or just because of the special atmosphere the album builds up, I'm pretty sure people will like it. And it still seems to be sort of an inside-tip!
B0067Q42BY|5.0|I absolutely love this game!  Nice graphics, great story line, and it's a blast to play. :) I highly. recommend
B004SBX112|3.0|Can't believe that such a great game is crippled by requiring a wi-fi connection to download levels.  I'm not always near a hot spot.  Incredibly inconvenient.  Is Rovio in cahoots with the service providers?
0439023521|3.0|Without a doubt this is a great book. You will not regret purchasing this book. It's a page turner from beginning to end. It's my favorite out of the trilogy.
0394721780|5.0|Julia is Julia is Julia!  I can hear her voice as I puruse this book, it's techniques and the recipes.  For those who grew up believing the only good food is French - ergo learning to cook means learning classical French Cordon Bleu methods - Julia absolutely epitomizes the best and simplest of French styles.  The book is an excellent read just for the fun of it, too, peppered with anecdotes that also bring Julia's voice to my ears.  Thoroughly enjoyable!
1603420398|4.0|I enjoyed this book for several reasons.  First, there are lots of books with patterns for squares, but other motifs in unusual shapes are harder to find.  This book is full of them.  Also, the patterns are easy to follow and the instructions are clear.  There are plenty of motifs for the beginner and more challenging motifs for the more advanced.<br /><br />I, too, would have liked to see some examples of completed projects, particularly for the unusual shapes.<br /><br />Still, this book is worth your money and time if you're looking for some creative variety.
1609611543|5.0|Absolutely fabulous!  I follow the paleo diet and I continue to research healthy eating, such as coconut products and  fermented vegetables, and kefir.  This book goes into every detail imaginable to explain how wheat effects us from our heart to our brains and obviously what it can do to our weight.  I am not overweight and do not eat any grains but love to read books that educate me on medical issues that effect the body.  This book has so much information to help me prove to others, what wheat does to you EVERY TIME you eat it, and why I do not eat wheat or any other grains.  Now I have ammunition when someone says,\\"but you need grains\\", I know can not only defend my diet but help them understand how to help themselves from following my diet.  I always think it is weird when someone who is 20 or more pounds overweight tries to tell me how to eat anyway( I am 5'4\\" and 105 lbs.).  I stopped eating grains after reading the Paleo Solution Diet( a highly recommended read) and went from 120 lbs. to 105lbs. in 2 weeks, and my husband lost 20 lbs in 3 weeks!  We thought we were eating right before, but we were wrong.  I exercised 6 times a week and could not lose the weight before grain exemption.  Now I only work out 30 minutes 3 times a week and my weight remains a stable 105lbs, it changed my life!  I also have three kids and would suggest all post pregnancy moms give this a try, and read these two books!
1603425381|5.0|This book is terrific! Not only are the corner patterns well written and easy to follow, but they give you enough information to modify them in lots of ways so you can let your creative side shine through. I also liked the fact that, even though I am a beginner/intermediate crocheter, this book shows me how to make some borders that look really fancy and intricate.<br /><br />I have made a few of these borders and they all look very nice. I highly recommend this book.
B0015AARJI|4.0|Does it's job just like the Dualshock 2 and the original Dualshock before that. Motion control is annoying at best. I wish all games came with the option to turn it off.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Very fun &amp; entertaining application. Simple &amp; straightforward to play with no problems in fuctionality. Highly recommended for all ages &amp; skill levels.
B005J7K964|4.0|For so long I have been waiting for this and finally its available.<br /><br />Unlike a lot of purists I prefer the Moroder version with its contemporary soundtrack. Sure the film is grainy and dark in parts compared to other versions and it is colourised which may not to be to everyone's taste but the total experience is fantastic.<br /><br /> The 5.1 soundtrack is excellent but it's relating to this that I could only give it four stars out of five. One of my pet peeves with DVDs & Blu-rays is when a film has a 5.1 soundtrack but the rear speakers are only used for reflected sound and emphasis so you end up with essentially a \\"wide stereo\\" sound and unfortunately this is what has been done with the Moroder version of Metropolis. There is no discrete use of the rear speakers at all so its not much different from stereo. So what you get essentially is a great stereo DTS-HD MA soundtrack which sounds much much better the PCM Stereo track.
B000I0QKDS|5.0|\\"Truth\\" is one of those rare albums in my collection that I can listen from start to finish, and enjoy every song. The standout track is  \\"I Ain't Superstitious\\" with Jeff Beck's biting guitar, Rod Stewart's growling vocals, and Micky Waller's thumping drums. Running a close second is a sublime version of \\"Ol' Man River,\\" by Rod Stewart with his shimmering vocals punctuated by slashing guitar riffs from Jeff Beck, and backed by rumbling tympani played by an uncredited Keith Moon. Beck's playing shines on this album because he works with the band, rather than trying to dominate them. Rod's singing demonstrates why he has been labeled one of rock's finest vocalists. The bonus tracks offer an additional view into the band's early work. Two singles from the era featuring Beck's vocals are included, and he does a credible job of singing on \\"Tallyman\\" and \\"Hi Ho Silver Lining.\\" As I wrote in my review of \\"Beck-Ola,\\" the follow-up album to \\"Truth,\\" if you are hoping for more of the same golden sound found on \\"Truth,\\" you won't find it on \\"Beck-Ola,\\" an album of loud, thrashing music. I instead recommend listening to \\"Truth\\" another time.
0312430000|5.0|This book really was a great and easy read, hard to put down and so informative! To think that a check list can do so much, just read and find out! I actually also saw Atul speak at a local University recently and his presentation was just as gripping as his book!
159562015X|5.0|The book is in excellent condition, especially being a used item with a very low price. However, I was disappointed that the book, being used, had a used \\"unique access code.\\" (In reading the book description on Amazon, I hadn't realized that this code was needed or that it would be lacking.) So, I am unable to access the online StrengthsFinder assessment and other online features, such as the Strengths Discovery and Action-Planning Guide. (Note: those are not part of the hard-copy book.) I called the Gallup group to ask if one could purchase an access code separately, but was told that a new book must be purchased [[ASIN:159562015X StrengthsFinder 2.0]] for that purpose. So, if you'd like to do more than read about the 34 themes, be sure to purchase a NEW book!
B004EWFV9K|5.0|This is the last of the Kurt Wallander series, and if you're a fan of the others, it is a must-read. Plenty of plot twists, as usual, but it also offers perhaps the deepest look into Wallander's psyche--depressing though that might be. And even daughter Linda, who is not a personal favorite of mine, becomes more interesting in this book. A fitting way to end an excellent series.   Once you're done reading the Wallander books, I highly recommend some of Henning Mankell's other works which do not feature Kurt Wallander but are equally absorbing.
B004LWZW24|4.0|Insidious is a genuinely scary movie that depends on mood and sounds to send a chill up your spine. One needs to have a good surround system to truly understand what made cinema-goers so scared that it became the biggest hit of 2011 on a gross cost to net profit ratio.<br />This is a film that is grounded in earlier films such as Ghostbusters, Poltergeist and Paranormal Activity but still has originality in terms of treatment and scares. A family moves in to a old house and needless to say that all hell starts breaking loose, at the beginning it is very discreet but the horror soon engulfs the entire family. This is the film that makes for very tense edge of the seat  because the sequences are edgy and the scares bloodcurdling owing to the novel use of sound and background music. Finally a movie that relies on direction, ambiance and music, witness the song ` Walking through the Tulips' by Tiny Tim and the piano theme by  Ludovico Einaudi  - Nuvole Bianche,rather than CGI to deliver entertainment. I recommend this film to be watched, if possible on Blu-Ray, with the sound cranked  up high and in the company of people, who will scream when afraid. This will enhance and double your pleasure. 4 stars. 12/21/2011
B006O3MU96|5.0|It's our beloved Doodle Jump in a new HD version for the Kindle Fire. The HD graphics are superb on the Fire's screen. Don't miss the Grinch on the menu page. Touch him, and... well, you'll see what happens (it's electrifying).<br /><br />The Options page gives you several choices, such as to use OpenFeint, to post scores on Facebook, sound on/off, snow on/off, and to turn directional shooting on or off. There's also a Calibrate option - auto or manual.<br /><br />Playing this version of Doodle Jump is pretty much like other versions. The goal here is to take the Doodler to the North Pole. I haven't reached there yet (I don't know if you can ever reach it - the game is endless, I think), but it's challenging fun trying to improve your best score. The accelerometer in the Kindle Fire works well in guiding the Doodler when you tilt the Fire. In this Christmas version, the Doodler is shooting snowballs at the baddies. As with other versions of Doodle Jump, you're looking for power-ups like springs, trampolines, and jetpacks, and trying to either avoid the monsters or kill them.<br /><br />This is a definite \\"must have\\" app for Doodle Jump fans with Kindle Fires.
B0058VW36U|5.0|Fun. The right amount of effort and cost. The art work is superb as well. It continuously have newer levels. The achievements are fun to try.

0811875040|5.0|We LOVE,LOVE,LOVE this book. My daughter has made almost everything in this book. The Tom Boy cake is fantastic and so are the homemade grahm crackers! I totally reccomend this book if you like to bake and enjoy making special things for special people. If you don't want to put in the effort to bake something nice, go buy a box cake mix~ this isn't for you.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|I love this film and I really expected to hate this adaptation. I am a direhard fan of the Colin Firth version with Jennifer Ehles and I didn't think anything could come close but this really does. I would not say it surpasses it but it has its own lovely atmosphere and aesthetics and touches that differentiate it from the Colin Firth version and make it tear at your heart strings over a story I am sure like myself you have read and watched several times before.<br /><br />I am so happy that the Blu-ray version is out and I will be snatching it up now but this perfect DVD version was the first one I bought and I was very pleased with it. And with the current price at less than $10, it is really a complete utter steal!
B0058VW36U|2.0|Why does this game want to know my location and phone call data?  When I see these unnecessary permissions for a paid app, I get suspicious.
B00364K6YW|5.0|I own both the blu-ray and this restored edition and I love them. Unfortunately, my restored edition was defective and after many years of P&P marathons, when we went to play it again we found that the mini-series was completely washed out in, of all colors, white! Everything had this ethereal angelic shocking bright glow that made it impossible to watch. Because this wasn't my first restored edition (I regifted the first after using it), I imagine and hope that my own was defected.<br /><br />So, of course, I bought myself (and friends and family) the restored version and the blu-ray version depending on their taste. You really don't need the blu-ray version. But if you're a collector of all things Austen, I recommend purchasing this and the blu-ray! If you notice the difference, you have a better eye than me.
B004LZF2LW|5.0|This is one of my favorite apps. I can check up on the times where my family and colleagues are, and when travelling the alarm clock works flawlessly no matter where I am. It looks great and has lots or helpful info. I bought it full price and do not regret it at all. On of my favorite apps and a very friendly developer who responds right away to any questions.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|Get over the ads people. This game is super fun and free. Works perfect on my Galaxy S and my Fire
B003X2O6KW|5.0|This album was very creative.  Something I've come to expect and respect from Kanye west.  I did not like nor appreciate Watch the Throne.  My review was very bold and brass about that album and the work on that album.  Him and Jayz are like vodka and milk, they don't mix well.  They are 2 different artist.  Kanye is creative, artistic, and think outside the box type of individual.  Jayz is very common, and one of the least interesting people in Rap/hip hop, due to his commonality amongst most artist. Not his talent, but his nature and content, for the most part.  Kanye actually raps better with Common, Talib, Mos, and Lupe.  I think he raps worse with JayZ.  When your creative, you have to and should work with other creative minds, which is why he sounds better collaborating with 4 artist I named a line ago, versus's with people who are not very creative, i.e. Jayz, Freeway, etc.  Basically stay in your lane.  If MC hammer did a album with the RZA back when Hammer was hot, that would of been hot garbage.  Vodka and Milk.  But solo, Kanye delivered on this album.  Tremendously.  The production was tight, the creativeness of the record was unparalleled.  I've listen to the album close to 50 times if not more since buying it.  Never gets old.  The only track I don't like, is the last track.  I don't like that auto-tune stuff.  I think that's over done and just plain weak.  This is probably album of the year for me.  Was thinking it would probably go to Lupe, but then his CD came out, and I was sadly mistaken.    This a little off track but, whatever is happening at Lupe's record, I hope he leaves if they can't get their creattive differences ironed.  Cause I can't buy that hip pop he's putting out now.  For now I guess I'll just keep rocking The Cool.  Peace.
B0043URV5U|4.0|A good collection for Bob Seger fans of some of his hits. The price was very reasonable and I really liked that his Little Drummer Boy song was included in this collection.
B004SEVPWQ|5.0|Great graphics and fun to play. It might not be for people who are just looking for a game to play, but pool players should love it. So realistic.
B005UKJX4E|1.0|I can't believe that Brad Pitt would be associated with this tripe.  If this movie was made in the 60's then people would have understood it while under the influence of drugs.  Don't waste your money and time on this loser of a movie.  Zero stars
0439023513|5.0|Wow, I tore through the Hunger Games trilogy quickly. I found the second book to be my least favorite--good--but not nearly as good as the first and last. I will leave plot details to other readers, but \\"Mockingjay\\" builds from a pleasant lull in the beginning to a frantic pace and a truly unexpected ending. As I got down to the last pages of \\"Mockingjay\\" I became more and more impressed by Suzanne Collins' ability to take an incredibly complex topic--war--and give it realistic facets despite the fact that this is a book aimed at younger readers. It is to the author's credit that she does not take the 'easy way' out and turn this into a happily-ever-after tale.  She allows the weighty toll of everything that occurs throughout the three books to ultimately define the characters and who they become; they cannot run from what has happened so they adapt to how the hunger games, the revolution, and war change them.  This book specifically addresses the shades of gray that are the reality of war.  There is no purely evil Capitol and no purely good District 13/Revolution.  Human nature has the capacity for both incredible kindness and cruelty, \\"Mockingjay\\" is a book about human nature and how we wrestle with questions of humanity and compassion in the face of violence, terror, and war.
B0018QPPXW|3.0|A somewhat dark 80,s teenage movie, the mood is seroius,very coming of age,unlike    other films, from same time period,(Sixteen Candles).etc,somewhat haunting music    is played off and on through the movie,but fits the style of the show,pretty good    chase scene with a Porsche 928,if your a fan of 80,s sports cars,very good     performance,s by a young Tom Cruise,and co-stars.
0545403359|5.0|I never knew this book ever existed, until I saw the trailer to the movie on facebook. Saw this at kmart the other day, and decided to pick it up. Boy am I ever glad I did. Although short, its an excellent read, with a very powerful, anti-war message. Took me a couple of days to finish it, and I am not disappointed. I also liked that the book was not totally biased against the enemy, and showed that some of the germans Joey encountered were compassionate human beings, who also despised the war, and didn't want to be there. The coin toss between (friendly)enemies, to determine Joeys ownership in the end was also awesome.   I will definitely read this again, and I can't wait to see the movie!
B0063IH60K|3.0|fun game sometimes I feel like it lets you win other than that it is a very basic game to play
B000F0UV0E|5.0|This is a very good CD. I already had this and bought another copy as a Christmas gift for a family member that heard it at my house.
B0043URV5U|5.0|Bob Seger is one of a kind!  The CD is mostly his older songs and I love it.  I have it on cassette from a long time ago but can only play it in the basement.  The CD I can play in the living room and in the car.  I love it.
B005LRWRZ8|3.0|I think the album is just OK. There are not any songs that I dislike but there are no songs that blow me away either.   There are 2 well defined Megadeths I think - the more commercial, easy to listen, radio friendly Megadeth (born with Cowntdown...) and the more relentless, aggressive, more technical Megadeth (being Rust In Peace its maximum expression); I like this Megadeth a lot more. I've been a Megadeth fan for over 20 years, a couple of albums before Countdown, so when Countdown came out it was disappointing to me.  In Endgame, for instance, my favorite tracks are This Day We Fight and Headcrusher, followed by 1,320 and Endgame. There are other songs that I like a lot like 44 Minutes or How The Story Ends, but I enjoy these songs as a way to cool down from the heavier songs and to get ready for the next merciless attack. Th1rt3en is made solely of these radio friendly songs and so there's no excitement for me. There are songs that I was able to remember completely after the first couple of listens (Public Enemy # 1, Wrecker) and that in itself is a bad sign for me, means that the song is too easy. Easy comes, easy goes.  Most of the songs follow the easiest and most predictable song structure of intro, 2 verses, sometimes a bridge, chorus, repeat, solo, chorus, end. Fast Lane does not by incorporating a total change towards the end for the solos, but this part is way too similar to Wake Up Dead, so I wasn't all that happy with it. Maybe this is one of the most particular characteristics in this album - it's even, no ups and downs like in Endgame or United Abominations; it's even all across like Rust in Peace or Countdown. But if I could choose, I prefer an album with killer songs (Headcrusher in Endgame, Washington Is Next in United Abominations) even if there are some crappy ones (The Hardest Part in Endgame, A Tout Le Monde in UA).  Lyrical content - I usually don't pay attention to the lyrical value of the songs, but I enjoy excellent lyrics as a bonus feature and I find bad lyrics a big turn-off. Whose Life... is the perfect example - the song could be better, but the lyrics are so dumb that bring the song down. Fast Lane is yet another song about driving fast (like 1,320, 502, etc); no need for that. I like the lyrics to New World Order and Millennium (though not new) and to We The People; still miles away from Washington Is Next, United Abominations and Gears of War.  If I have to choose the highs in this album (again, not easy since it's pretty much all the same style) I'd choose New World Order (but it's not a new song, I already had it and knew it), Public Enemy (nice galloping riff), Whose Life (if it had different lyrics), Sudden Death (if it wasn't for the almost cheesy chorus) and Deadly Nightshade. The lows (not by much) are 13 and Millennium Of The Blind.   I was skeptical about this album before listening to it. The fact that they didn't work with Andy Sneap, who had produced the 2 previous albums that I like so much, and went with Johnny K, a producer that had worked solely with bands that I dislike (Disturbed, Plain White T's, Machine Head, and others) made me raise an eyebrow. Then I learned that they had only 2 months to put the album together and this reminded me that it was the last album in Megadeth's contract with RoadRunner, a label that Mustaine had criticized heavily during the release of Endgame, so it seemed that they released the album because they were forced to. And to top it all, 5 of the 13 songs were rehashed, some were as old as 17 years old. So by the time the CD got to me I wasn't all that excited. Maybe prejudice didn't let me open my mind enough? I do see that a huge majority loved this album. I just hope that Mustaine doesn't pay much attention to all these positive reviews and goes back to some more intricate song writing.  P.S. - if the return of David Ellefson has anything to do with this outcome, then he can go back to retirement and please bring James Lomenzo back.
B005K0HDGE|3.0|Just saw the nook ebook for 14 dollars on their site.  That is a large price difference.  Have no idea why this happens.  There.  Did I get to 20 words not counting repeats?
B006BZ8WAI|5.0|The two songs from this album that i have heard on the radio do not over shadow the whole album like i was worried it might. Every song in this album is great and worth listening to.

0439813786|5.0|Bought this book for my 7 year old son who loves to read.  I wanted him to read the book before seeing the movie.  At first glance, he was intimidated by the size of the book - it is THICK.  But then he realized that a good portion of the book was filled with wonderful drawings that made the story even more magical.  He LOVED it.  It is in a place of honor on his bookshelf and he has read it twice already.
B004ZY0VHY|3.0|I came across a mention of the upcoming theatrical release based on this novel, and decided after seeing the trailer that I wanted to read the book. The novel is written in one voice using a specific format: a wife (Eva) writing letters to her husband about things past. Much has already been said about the pitfalls of the author's choice to use this approach; I won't be able to add anything that hasn't already been observed by more capable reviewers. But the narration of the novel was problematic for me, in that Eva took a very long time to grow on me. Her voice and personality were well-drawn by the author; the problem was that I intensely disliked the woman...and the whole of the novel is told in her words alone. Those words are often unnecessarily frilly and show-offish, and as a reader I wondered if I should dislike Eva or the author herself for Eva's fanciful verboseness and ceaseless, insipid navel-gazing. When Eva reveals that she would've preferred a decrepit Victorian home over the modern ranch her husband chooses for them, it seemed ruefully appropriate that her character would value ostentatious architectural adornment in the form of dumbwaiters and such. Every two-dollar word chosen by the author when a more accessible and equally descriptive one would suffice had the unfortunate effect on me of delayed appreciation for my interest in the story itself. (The Kindle's built-in dictionary was made for a novel like this! When, late in the book, the author uses the word \\"pellucidity\\" I had to smile because, back in 1987, my junior year English literature teacher had a good-natured laugh over my choice to include the word \\"pellucid\\" in an essay. It was pretentious then, and it's pretentious now. It was also telling that the Kindle's dictionary had no suggestions whatsoever for the meaning of the word. So be warned: this novel is chockablock with arcane vocabulary.) However, I do feel that Eva being such an unlikeable character added dimension to the who's-at-fault-here questions the readers are likely to ask themselves.  The novel does have fine aspects, and the plot hit its stride for me somewhere in the middle. Eva may be sneeringly intelligent, but she *is* intelligent and through her the author makes some thoughtful observations about parenthood, grief and exclusion, among other things. I think most readers will guess the 'surprise' ending shortly after the halfway point, but knowing it did not diminish my enjoyment of the story as it unfolded. The author uses the timeline of the late 1990s through 2001 to address larger themes that include real-life crimes and politics of the moment, and in a few cases it added something of value to the story. Still, I've read too many novels in the recent past wherein the author's own politics come through loud and clear. I don't know if this is egregiously obvious in \\"We Need To Talk About Kevin\\", but I'd be willing to wager a hefty sum on  Ms. Shriver's general political leanings, nonetheless. I felt this takes the reader outside the immediate story, which is never a good thing. Another small point of regret for me is when Eva references a real-life school shooting and informs the reader that she has committed the names of the victims - who are too often forgotten - to memory. Unfortunately, Ms. Shriver has misspelled the name of one of these real-life victims.  Other reviewers have commented that the book is perhaps better categorized as a good ol' horror story, and to do so benefits the book enormously by allowing the reader to suspend substantial amounts of disbelief along the way. Ms. Shriver has chosen to write a very intimate tale of motherhood and children, and it shows immediately that she has no personal experience in these arenas. It is violent and graphic, and potential readers should probably have a taste for that, too.  If your vocabulary is expansive and/or you don't mind learning new words along the way and if your expectations are flexible, by all means, give \\"WeNeed To Talk About Kevin\\" a try. If you find yourself disliking Eva, I'd still recommend that you keep going. Despite its flaws, the book is a tense ride (if utterly unbelievable throughout) on a number of levels and I can honestly say it fascinated me despite its numerous, petty annoyances. In perusing the one and two-star reviews of this title, most of them make solid critiques of the book's shortcomings, and those low-rating reviews are worth checking out before you decide to part with your hard-earned money, as the author's style *and* point of view are downright polarizing.
B001P06GX4|4.0|What a waste of packaging.  This game is a standard board-game size, came in a box that could have fit a dozen of them.  Waste of resources.  The rest was filled with air pillows.
B0063GORYU|5.0|This. was one of the first apps I downloaded for the Kindle fire. It is a great game design and runs very smooth. You can't beat the price either!
B005HSG3VK|5.0|I love this cover! I bought this for my daughters kindle and it works perfectly. Think it's great that the kindle snaps down inside it and holds it securely.  The front cover is light and soft and there's a strap to keep it closed. Overall it does not make the kindle more bulky.  Great buy!
B005JABSB6|4.0|These work great with my Sharp Aquos 3D television: http://www.amazon.com/Sharp-LC52LE925UN-52-inch-Quattron-3D-Compatible/dp/B003QPOB92<br /><br />Drawbacks are the price (normally priced $100, but caught on sale for $75) and they feel like they are slipping or could easily slide off my nose. They come with 2 nose pieces and I found the second nose piece worked well enough to keep them. These are also way lighter than the Xpand Universal 3D glasses I bought, that take batteries.<br /><br />Pros are weight and rechargeable battery. They came charged too.

B003Y5H54W|1.0|I love stories about wolves, vampires, and other monsters, but I was very disappointed with this movie.  I believe it has a great concept, however, it was lost in translation.  The visual scenery was very beautiful, but the storyline was way lacking.  It jumped around too much for my taste, and the choice of music used at the celebration didn't fit the dark ages or 15th century.  I am glad I didn't purchase this movie because I would have been very upset that I wasted my hard-earn money, however, if you want to have your own personal \\"Razzie\\" award show, then this is the movie for you.
B004QZ9PLU|2.0|The first half of the book is good but the last half was terribly sad, predictable, too similar to others he's written & very disappointing!!
0316098329|5.0|Emma Donoghue created the feeling of claustrophobia befitting of the characters situation in the early stages of the book to such an extent that I had almost reached screaming pitch. Just as I could take no more the book changed pace and direction.   This story is very cleverly written and took me on a roller coaster of emotions. I thoroughly enjoyed it
1439192812|5.0|\\"The Magic of Reality\\" is the greatest book I have read this year. I was confident that I was very scientifically literate before I read this book. However I was still entertained very much while I was reading it and learned lot from it. I am a big Richard Dawkins fan. I am trying to complete my reading all his books.
0385341008|5.0|I loved the style, the pace, the language and the characterisation.<br /><br />The only issue that I had with this book was that it was too short. I found myself reading increasingly slower as I neared the end so as to savour every last moment!
145551389X|5.0|You already must be Goo-Goo for GaGa if you ordered this book and disappointed you will NOT be! Terry Richardson's work is always sublime but consider who he's shooting, how could it be anything less?!
B005MYEQ4U|2.0|The Good: It was interesting, smart and funny.  Not funny like Hangover: full of sexual jokes and bad language.<br />The Bad: Since the very beginning of the movie, they insert left-wing politics in the dialogue.  Jokes against Bush, the war in Iraq and the teaparty people appear throughout the movie. The director describes a republican family as rich, materialistic and closed-minded.  While Gill (the main character) is described as open to political dialogue and a dreamer that puts his artistic ambitions ahead of any financial decision.<br />But overall, it is a decent movie you can watch with your family. Something that has been lost nowadays.
0756655307|4.0|Awesome book.  I got this for my boss for Secret Santa at my office.  He loved it.  He's a huge comic fan. I'm a huge Marvel fan too and used to have all the old school Marvel Universes.  I'm sure it's not as comprehensive as those collections but I thumbed through it and looked pretty good; great art, tons of peeps you'll recognize, and decent info.  It's an especially great deal for only $26 on Amazon Prime.  I'll probably pick one up for myself some time soon.  If you dig Marvel, you won't be sorry.

B005NGKMOU|5.0|Well done in all respects.  The scenery is fantastic, acting is excellent, story is great, and everything works.  It will pull you in and keep your attention like a good book.  Really liked this one.  Try it, I think you'll like it.

B0051UP5NQ|4.0|Have tried a few 'viewers', and lite edition office apps, but this one is by far, the best.  Especially like the fact that I can use a lot of the more advanced functions within Excel app. Works without issue on my Android phone, Kindle Fire, and Android Tablet.  I originally got this one from the free app of the day from Amazon, but I would have paid for it if I had known about it beforehand.
B006FLGBGA|4.0|Great CGI and acting.  Very action packed. My wife and I loved this movie, and we weren't really expecting much.
0385534639|5.0|Read this book after a friend's recommendation without having heard any of the hype and I loved it. After reading the Kindle version I immediately bought the hardcover for another friend's birthday.
B005HSG3U6|3.0|The only \\"but\\" is the following: The dirt adheres very easily to the white microshell cover, making it look sort of neglected, and it is extremely difficult to remove the dirt from it.
B0041KKYBA|5.0|As those who WILL NOT SEE!  As the reviews titled \\"Hypocrisy\\", \\"A Shoddy Piece of Work\\" (although I have NEVER seen, nor ever expected to, Michael Moore AND Fox News [the EPITOMY of UNFair and UNBalanced \\"News\\" Reporting] offered in the SAME breath as being on the SAME SIDE of ANY difference of opinion), \\"Propaganda From the Left\\", and \\"Gotcha Journalism\\" amply demonstrate, some people are congenitally INCAPABLE of recognizing the dangers, if not outright criminal, behavior of those who are on the same political side as themselves.  Like the apologists for the new title-holder of Worst President EVER, Jr, these writers ascribe the filmmakers argument to mere \\"leftist\\" propaganda, unworthy of even consideration on its merits.  Usually, when someone offers such a facetious and fallacious argument (in logic, resorting to ANY of the FALLACIES, such as ad hominem, ad valorem, ad popularum, et al, NEGATES ones argument as FALLACIOUS, at BEST; specious, in probability), it means they realize the DAMAGE such a charge to be, and are scurrying, like rats deserting a sinking ship, to head off as much mud as they can from attaching to themselves.    The MANY abuses of the system that occurred during the last 30 years are prime examples of CRIMINAL behavior, NOT \\"business acumen\\"!  In times past, somehow, men, and women, ACCUMULATED large fortunes WITHOUT bankrupting the COUNTRY, although there were repeated attempts by less scrupulous operators, to circumvent the rules, and/or violate the laws, but the shenanigans of the perpetrators of this latest scam, the descent into speculation on, and distribution of \\"derivatives\\", outdoes ALL previous breaches of honesty.  After the debacle of the Barclay's Bank scandal of the '90s, one would have thought cooler heads would have prevailed and the market would have foresworn such foolish,  ridiculous, and unpredictable, forms of financial speculation.  Instead, companies built on old-fashioned values, over long spans, were lured into a quagmire of deception and trickery, a swamp that eventually sank more than one venerable Wall Street firm, in the end, and cost the TAXPAYER more than $750 BILLION.  To ADD INSULT to INJURY, those same firms, banks, mortgage companies and stock brokers alike, ISSUED OBSCENE BONUSES, IMPOSSIBLY HUGE SALARIES, and other REWARDS to the CEOs, \\"consultants\\", and executives of those same companies, as the ONLY INCOME coming IN was TAXPAYER BAILOUTS!  I recall watching one such pinhead INSISTING if they DIDN'T continue one \\"consultant's\\" $1 MILLION PER MONTH \\"retainer\\" he would \\"go elsewhere\\".  WHERE WOULD HE GO, in an \\"industry\\" (that DOESN'T \\"make\\" ANYTHING!) ON THE ROPES?  Personally, I would have shown him the DOOR, and said, \\"GO FOR IT!\\"  That's just me, and I'm an old fuddy-duddy, more aligned with John Gielgud's famous dictum for SmithBarney, \\"We EARN it!\\"  ALL that's resulted from the Ray-Gun Revolution of the last 30 years is that THINGS COST MORE!  Wall Street FUNDED the DESTRUCTION of HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF JOBS, with the \\"Junk Bond Kings\\", LOOTING companies WHOSE ONLY SIN was to NOT MAKE WALL STREET ENOUGH money!  Those criminals EMPTIED PENSION FUNDS, retirement accounts set up for long-term employees, TO PAY the BALLOON PAYMENTS on the Junk Bonds, DUMPING RESPONSIBILITY on the TAXPAYERS!  Michael Milken walked away with ENOUGH TO PAY A $600 MILLION FINE, and STILL BE VERY WEALTHY!  Meanwhile, Wall Street went on GOBBLING up American businesses, and spitting out the carcasses.    Then, we got the great Savings & Loan Swindle, with another $300 BILLION in LOSSES dumped on the TAXPAYERS!  The MANTRA these days, from the VERY WEALTHY, is they shouldn't pay taxes, but WHY NOT?  THEIR WEALTH CAME from deals like these that COST THE US GOVERNMENT, the taxpayers, MORE THAN $1 TRILLION--IN JUST THOSE TWO INSTANCES, the S&L SCANDAL, and the WALL STREET BAILOUT!  In ANY other enterprise, RUNNING a business into the ground, either bankruptcy or insolvency, would result in BEING FIRED, at least, IF NOT criminal charges!  I can pretty much guarantee you, IF you were to DO the SAME to ANY OF THE PARTICIPANTS in EITHER of these FRAUDS, they'd have HAD YOU IN COURT, in a NEW YORK MINUTE!  Brought up on the MOST SEVERE CHARGES they could arrange!  Working for ANY of these same bozos would have PAID THE LEAST POSSIBLE salary, because these people BELIEVE MONEY WAS CREATED FOR THEIR USE, ONLY!  If you're NOT a peer, one of the circle they are IN, or WANT TO BE IN, then you are NOTHING, and can be treated with the UTMOST disregard, since you are a NOBODY!  WHATEVER YOUR BELIEF, that is the LEAST AMERICAN belief of all.  People who THINK like that are from a DIFFERENT CULTURE--ONE THIS COUNTRY WAS CREATED TO GET AWAY FROM!  Before you accuse me of being a \\"leftie\\" or ANY SUCH ad hominem attack, I was a CONSERVATIVE LONG BEFORE ANY OF YOU WAS EVEN AWARE OF THE WORD!  I am a VietNam veteran, with combat service, and I raised TWO CHILDREN BY MYSELF, without HELP FROM ANYONE, including their mother.  I operated a reasonably successful (for my own purposes--NOT WS) BUSINESS for 30 YEARS, but after 2008, IT WAS AS IF SOMEONE HAD TURNED OFF A TAP!  The phone DID NOT RING, for THREE YEARS!  My clients, who for decades, could find a piece of land, go to the bank, get a construction loan, build a house, sell it, take their profit and invest it in another piece of land and repeat the process!  NOT SINCE 2008!  Those banks, GIVING THE EXECS those super BONUSES, NO LONGER MADE LOANS to the average person, regardless of credit-worthiness.  AND, to ADD FURTHER INSULT to injury, IF that individual COULD get a LOAN, THERE WERE NO BUYERS!  Because THOSE individuals COULD NOT GET A LOAN!  So WHY, exactly, were BANK EXECS getting HUGE BONUSES?  For credit card fees, charges, interest rates.  I mean, a B-School MBA is NECESSARY to tell someone that RAISING FEES/INTEREST/CHARGES to generate income is a GOOD IDEA?  Personally, IF I hired an individual, and THAT was the BEST IDEA they could come up with, I WOULD FIRE THEM!  I certainly wouldn't want to PAY them an outrageous salary, MUCH LESS a \\"bonus\\".  However, the CEOs we've gotten STUCK WITH are as MORIBUND and PEDESTRIAN as those individuals suggesting such \\"ideas\\".  It's like the Emperor's NEW CLOTHES, everyone is caught up in a \\"hipness\\" game, stuck between the Devil and the Deep Blue Sea of unemployment, required to GO ALONG with the SCAM!  Oh, YES, I SEE THEM (the \\"miracle threads\\" that ONLY the MOST DISCERNING can see!)  Yes!  They are SO ELEGANT and BEAUTIFUL!    You see, the RISING TIDE OF IGNORANCE has CAUGHT UP with Wall Street.  The trend that started in the early 70s, when the IMPACT of \\"Johnny Can't Read\\" began to HIT HOME, has come to ROOST WITH A VENGEANCE.  The average Wall Street trader/broker/GLORIFIED SALESMAN is suffering from \\"Too-Hip\\"ism, enmeshed in the SAME self-destructive downward spiral that has essentially destroyed the Automobile Industry--causing them to so routinely turn out lemons, CONSUMERS KNOW NOT TO BUY CARS PRODUCED ON FRIDAY OR MONDAY!  When you have reached a \\"plateau\\" of such a negatively-connoted location, you SHOULD KNOW you are IN SERIOUS TROUBLE!  Thanks almost entirely to the culture of excessive greed spawned by the Ray-Gun Revolution, America has transitioned from the GREATEST Superpower the WORLD HAS KNOWN, a CREDITOR NATION of UNBELIEVEABLE WEALTH, to a DEBTOR NATION, deeply in hock with no hope of paying off the debt, thanks to a political party OWNED, lock-stock-and-double-barrelled, by Wall Street!   The PROBLEM is that EVENTUALLY, the downtrodden, those you turn your nose up at, as you whiz by in your quarter-million-dollar-armored-limosine, is that they DO NOT STAY DOWN.  One day, not too long coming, now, they will do JUST WHAT THE POOR PEOPLE OF FRANCE DID--you know it, you learned it in school, even if you didn't actually GRASP the IMPORT of the lesson.  They ROSE UP AND SLAUGHTERED AN ENTIRE CLASS OF PEOPLE!  I know some of you are relying on your gated estates, the police, the Army/National Guard/Private Security, but SO DID THOSE UNFORTUNATES!  The saddest fact of all?  IF the greedy wealthy WEREN'T so greedy, and DIDN'T try to get someone to WORK FOR THE VERY LEAST POSSIBLE, we COULD HAVE an economy that ECLIPSED ALL OTHERS, EVER!  WE COULD HAVE TRILLIONAIRES!  Money is MEANT as a MEANS OF EXCHANGE, NOT ACCUMULATION!  WHEN people clog up the system, by TAKING AS MUCH AS THEY CAN GET THEIR GRUBBY FINGERS ON, the system DOESN'T WORK!  THAT'S what we are SEEING NOW!  We will CONTINUE TO SEE it, UNTIL someone COMES TO THEIR SENSES, or until a lot of people LOSE their heads!  I wonder if we could travel back, to visit some of the nobility of 1785, and TELL THEM OF THEIR FUTURE, WOULD they wake up?  Probably not--it's HUMAN NATURE, just as it's human nature to think because you dress a pig in silks, it's a BETTER pig.  It doesn't matter the QUALITY of the SILK, if you START with a PIG, you END UP with a PIG!  We have TOO MANY WEALTHY PIGS, unfortunately, and they prove the validity of that statement on a daily basis!  I think that is why we use the word to indicate someone who takes MORE THAN THEIR SHARE.  If the CEO is WORTH 400+ TIMES MORE than the average worker, he SHOULD DO 400+ TIMES the WORK!  IF he DOESN'T, he ISN'T worth the money!  JUST BECAUSE HE'S HOLDING A GUN to your head doesn't make him deserving, it makes him a CRIMINAL!    So, GO BACK AND WATCH THIS MOVIE, and TAKE YOUR BLINDERS OFF!  You WILL see a PARADE OF PIGS, obfuscating, rationalizing and DOING THEIR VERY BEST BOGART, insisting they \\"deserve\\" MORE THAN ANYONE ELSE, MORE THAN THEY EARNED, MORE THAN THEIR EFFORTS CREATED, just like the \\"pigs\\" they are.  Not \\"financial wizards\\", \\"gurus\\" or EVEN \\"good business managers\\", JUST PIGS.
B0068AWQQ2|4.0|I have more respect for Colin Farrell after seeing this movie.  I think I would like to have a beer with him and talk about stuff.  Mr Farrell is a good actor, but by doing this movie he proved he is also a person.  I believe that he did this for fun (okay maybe he did it for money) anyway he made a good modern day vampire.  In his lines he kind of channeled a couple of actors.  The one I recognized very quickly was Christopher Walken.  I couldn't pin down the next one but it came with the line \\"Because there are a lot of bad people out there Charlie.\\"  \\"Thanks for the beer\\"  .  May have been Clint Eastwood.  It's a humorous and entertaining movie.  No it's not frightening.
B003VJTGLQ|1.0|The movie itself is great; the blu-ray DISC itself is great too.  The one star is for the misleading listing.  Though the customer image shows a slipcover and blu-ray.com says so, Amazon.com told me that they simply don't have it and that photo is not accountable.  I initially did not care about the cover too much but now think this causes such a false expectation and disappointment.
B006NXIO0Q|1.0|Zoe Saldana, let's face it, she is hot, she can act, but she can't carry this movie.  This movie just drones on and on.  If you have seen the TV show Nikita twice, you have seen this whole movie twice.  I have watched this movie for 1 and a half hours and had to stop.  It just sucked.  Not to give anything away, but she kills someone.  Wow.  They try to throw in a boyfriend to create some kind of sympathy for her emotional sacrifice, just doesn't work.  Why would I care, she a psychopathic killer.  Everything builds her up to this.  Someone should have told the writers to let it go, and just let her be a darn good looking badass.    It just didn't work, by the end I didn't care who she killed or didn't kill.  Buy the poster, nevermind,poster is to expensive, but there are some scenes in here that you can freeze frame that are awesome.  Did I mention that Zoe Saldana is hot?
B005CAAXXM|5.0|Album number three from this Norwegian progressive band is simply impressive! Every song has something intriguing and unpredictable, you don't know what to expect.

B0057R5XRG|5.0|I love this classic trilogy and even more so on Blu-ray! The picture is amazing and the surround sound output is ear shattering, especially with the T-Rex's roar and his thunderous stomps. Must-own for any Jurassic Park fan!
B005OCFGTO|3.0|The process of ordering and receiving the collection was very smooth and prompt.  Things went south during the viewing of Deathly Hallows, which we viewed first from the set.  Several times the screen became very dark, and in some places we had to guess what was happening.  We don't know if if is a problem with the quality of the disks, or of our player, but it occurred with one or two of the others, too.  It somewhat dampened our enthusiasm and enjoyment of the videos.
B002ZG98UK|5.0|First of all, if you have a 3D TV, this is a must have.  The 3D effects are by far the best I've seen to date.  I haven't seen Avatar in 3D though (since it's not released main stream yet) but since they use the same camaras to create the 3D effects while filming I'm sure they're on par with eachother.  GET THIS for the 3D alone.
B003V4AK8E|5.0|I've been using this controller now for about 6 months and overall have been very happy with it. For the most part I play platformers (Ratchet and Clank, Little Big Planet) and the occasional first person game (ok, just Portal).<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Materials feel nice and the grips are more comfortable than the OEM controller<br />- Controller start-up is very fast compared to the bluetooth OEM controller<br />- LED lighted buttons are a nice touch and useful (I'm guessing) for those that are still learning where the buttons are<br />- Trigger buttons feel nicer than OEM controller<br />- Left analog stick is positioned at the top right. Take a bit if getting used to but ultimately a nice location for it<br />- Battery life seems to be great, but I am a fairly light player<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Not bluetooth, so the IR receiver will occupy one of your USB ports<br />- Will not wake the console as you can with an OEM controller<br />- Analog sticks are not as smooth to operate as the OEM controller. Noticeable when very fine control is needed<br /><br />Overall, I'd say this is a great choice if you need an extra controller for a second player. At the price, you can't beat and you may find that you use it as your primary controller like I do.
B002SSUQFG|5.0|An exceptional value for $65. All the little detail has the Seiko precision. One classic looking watch. It takes a 19 mm leather band.

1451629184|5.0|This was an incredible story, and gave me more insight into what predators do to victims.  I wish there had been even more detail at certain points- so that we all know the full depths of insanity and aberration that can occur, and what things to look for in our immediate environments.    Thank-you so much Jaycee for sharing your story.  I hope you write another later.    Even though Jaycee finds fault with herself for not doing something more to free herself, I can now understand more about why she didn't.  And truthfully, she kept her integrity and her beliefs in the face of a horrid and completely degrading situation.  She may not have acted on those beliefs, but she kept them pure.  That to me, is saying a lot.    Thanks again, Jaycee.  I would be totally willing to help you out in any endeavor you ever wanted to undertake.  You are deserving of anyone's help.    Dorothy
0061537969|3.0|I found this book engaging and enjoyed reading it, but I didn't feel that it was one that contained a lot of depth or even really made me think. It was well-written enough, though it wasn't particularly clever or witty. It's a fast read, but a sad story, so I wouldn't recommend it for a light-hearted vacation read.

6305428042|5.0|The collection would be to have one of the three ^ ^: The US dvd, since it is the country of origin of the film, UK dvd, as it offers a different picture for the cover and an interactive menu different, and the French dvd (2005 version with english, french and spanish languages), since it provides an HD version of the film, with sharper color. Without forgetting that the film refers to France at times, and it is likely that the Sanderson sisters from the UK, since Salem was settled by English Puritans.
B004LWZW4M|5.0|I expected a good movie considering how much time and money went into it.  I did not expect it to be this good.  The acting was outstanding. The CGI surpassed anything I have seen.  All I can really say is \\"WOW\\".
0345529057|3.0|So - you have watched the show on HBO, and now - you can't wait to the 2nd season!  You rush online, look franticly for the books on Amazon, You found this set of 4 books, and you want to dive right in, right?  Before you buy - let me tell you a little story:  Once upon a time (1996) there was a brilliant author who wrote and published a magical book.  All the people who have read this book were bewitched by it: as if under a spell, they could not let it down until it was finished.  They neglected their families and friends, they skipped school, they did not do any homework, laundry, cooking or cleaning while they were so enthralled with it's suspenseful plot, believable characters and general awesomeness. When they were done reading, all the people hailed the author and crowned him as the best fantasy writer since JRR Tolkien.  When the second book came out, The spell was even stronger.  Book no. 3 was equally great, and the masses of followers grew and grew in numbers. Then - book no.4 was about to come out: the devouted were anxiously waiting. They have pre-ordered it online a year ahead. They have cleared their schedule. They were standing in bookstores, shaking and trembling with anticipation, until they could get their hands on the coveted book.  But Alas!  -  as they read on the book, the magic was gone. The plot was tedious, the suspense was gone, and instead of adventures and adrenalin, they got more and more, unimportant and uninteresting new characters. Some kept on reading, some just put it aside and went to do their laundry instead.  The years went by, and the 5th book was published. It's name was \\"Dance with dragons\\", but there was no dancing among the ranks of the devouted, for again, they have tasted the bitter taste of disappointment.  That, my friends, Is the sad, sad story of \\"song of ice and fire\\", and it's cult of disappointed followers. A series 15 years in the making - and still NO WAY NEAR the end. After 3 awesome books: \\"Game of thrones\\" \\"clash of kings\\" \\"storm of swords\\", came the overwhelmingly boring and repetitive sequels - \\"feast for crows\\" and \\"Dance with dragons\\". In this two books, You will wonder aimlessly through the pages, much like the characters, looking for some actual plot. I just wanted to tell you, my young friends, do not buy this boxed set.  I know it is tempting , but believe me - Only the first 3 books are worth your time and money.You do not need to buy book 4 and 5. They are nothing like their older siblings. I know it is hard to believe they can be so bad that you should not even bother to read them - but it is, sadly, true.  GRR Martin has either lost his vision for his epic saga, or he is just shamelessly stalling and milking his fans for more money, for more and more bad books that do not advance the story line.  I dare say that after this  last 2 books, no one hails him as the new Tolkien any more. Tolkien had integrity as a writer. Can you Imagine Tolkien publishing the first two books and then saying - \\"Hey, people really dig this stuff! Maybe I can make a few more shillings out of it. Why don't I let Frodo and Sam take the scenic road to mordor, meet some new people, have a few loughs,  and add 1000 page or so\\".    Unfortunately - this is exactly what happened here. Why would you buy a boxed set of an unfinished book series? Save your money people. Borrow this books from a library, borrow from a friend , buy second hand. Do not put more money Into GRRM pocket before he proves he has integrety and ethics as a writer.

B0063IH60K|4.0|This is a refined version of solitaire. The graphics are crisp and the movement is slick. The developer did a good job creating this app.<br /><br />I did take off a star because I don't like the fact that you have to choose what type of game you want every single time you click new game; Random deal, winning deal, or replay deal. Also, with it being a free app expect ads. You will see 1 ad prior to each new game you start.<br /><br />I'm using a Droid X running 2.3.3.
1439102732|5.0|Jodi Picoult never disappoints! Wonderful book! My only problem with the story was I found it difficult to believe Zoe would so quickly embrace her new lifestyle. She seemed like such a thoughtful, contemporary woman, that I feel she would have likely struggled with her new-found sexuality & questioned her choices more before making the leap to marriage. That would probably have provided enough copy to fill up the entire book, so perhaps Picoult kind of skipped over it in the interest of time & space. That said, I loved the story, the characters, and the ending.
1400069181|4.0|I have a lot of friends that want to start something that matters. From prison ministries to mentoring programs to churches to community. I think that most of us have this abstract idea of what should be. Great ideas. Sticky ideas. Ideas for the common good.  But simultaneously, most of us have trouble getting these ideas any more concrete than a few idealistic conversations. Fears of failure. Fears of bankruptcy. Fears of inadequacy.  Blake Mycoskie had an idea. A shoe company. One with an uncharted business concept. A company that gives away a pair of shoes for every pair they sell. Five years later, they sell sunglasses. For every pair of sunglasses they sell, they provide medical eye treatment for someone in the world suffering from blindness.  Blake has written a book that acts as a road map and inspiration to my dreamer friends. He writes more than a biography of his company, TOMS. He writes to help change the current paradigm of for-profit business. He writes to encourage philanthropy.  A few weeks after finishing this book, I see the strengths and weaknesses of Start Something That Matters.  My main concern is that there are a lot of business start-up books out there. One of my favorites is Tribes, by Seth Godin. There are tons of inspirational books as well. The market is flooded with business start ups and business inspirationals.  I think Blake excels in creative philanthropy. Philanthropy is not just for the wealthy. Philanthropy can be for anybody motivated enough who wants to make a difference. And everyday people will buy your product or give to your organization if it helps support a significant and unique cause.  One of my favorite features of this book is Blake's lists of creative organizations. Several of which has grasped my attention, and will get my business or donations.  Kiva.org  Kiva is a micro-loan organization that connects you (the bank) with someone who wants to start a business. So instead of them going to a loan shark, you loan $25 toget them started. Kiva has an impressive 98.96% repayment rate!  charity: water  One of my biggest reservations on donating money is not knowing exactly where my money is going. How much of what I give goes to salaries, websites and traveling expenses? Is my money even going to the cause? Blake has introduced me to charity: water, where 100% of public donations goes to 1 thing: getting people water. All other business expenses are covered by private donors. So I can go on their website, use their google map function, zoom in and see water well construction.  Half of the proceeds from the book Start Something That Matters goes towards just that, towards helping start organizations that matter. So when you buy the book, you're also buying something else that matters.
B00338QENI|5.0|Fascinating and thought-provoking! Wow, I think this should be required reading. I'm not usually a fan of non-fiction (mainly because I use reading as an escape)... but this is just a phenomenal book. Rebecca Skloot did a wonderful job of explaining the medical advances made possible by using the cells of Henrietta Lacks, while telling the story of Henrietta and the Lacks family in a way that read like fiction. She tackled many ethical issues objectively, and there were times that I had to put the book down because my mind was stuck thinking about what I had just read.<br /><br />I'm grateful that my neighborhood book club selected this book, as I'm not sure I would have picked it up on my own. I recommend this book to everyone!

0307888681|3.0|Max Brooks World War Z is a very interesting take of Zombpocalypse from a macro level, 10,000 foot view. He does a very good job in researching such entities as the World Health Organization and standard govt/military procedures to global emergencies and quarantine shut downs. The result is a highly realistic zombie novel that feels more eerie than outright grisly. The writing is competent but there are no memorable characters and as such I can't recommend this as top shelf zombie fiction. Those laurels belong to I AM LEGEND, HANDLING THE UNDEAD by John Lindqvist and a very demented, newly minted genetic science take on the genre called BLUE BLOODBATH by Katrina Von Kessel, which i highly recommend.

0307586901|3.0|Here's the Scoop:'<br />There is no question that Martha Stewart has long been the reigning queen of DIY home crafts and decorations.  In this holiday-centered book, she has gathered the best of her ideas, giving us up-close and fully realized directions on how to create extraordinary crafts and gifts for home, family and friends. Martha doesn't disappoint her fans, and anyone is bound to find something beautiful to create in this holiday crafting book.<br /><br />Major holidays are segmented and ideas for crafts, home decorating and gift giving are shown for each one:  New Year's, Valentine's Day, Easter, July 4th, Halloween, Thanksgiving, Christmas...and all others in between!  The large spread photographs are lovely, the ideas are not expensive, but are easily accessible; and, the resulting crafts present bright, festive, magical, and even enchanting pieces.<br /><br />Here's What I Liked:<br /><br />Valentine's Day:<br />Red tulips in double glass vases with red cinnamon candy hearts were vibrant, beautiful and made an easy presentation for a dinner arrangement. Also, a carnation heart made of multiples of pink carnations on floral foam to make a centerpiece is quick and gorgeous!<br /><br />Easter:<br />Fabulous egg-dyeing techniques using natural formulas made from coffee, cabbage, blueberries, beets and spices made incredibly beautiful and exotic eggs.  And, Martha gives specific directions for marbleizing eggs!  Actually, most of her egg crafting was exceptional.<br /><br />Thanksgiving:<br />Gourd candles made from hollowed out mini gourds with colored, melted candles are just amazing little jewels!  Pumpkin carving is fabulous!<br /><br />Christmas:<br />I loved the cookie cutter ornament ideas made from various paper goods, family pictures and such.  The gilded, and verdigris Polish inspired eggs, and the ribbon poinsettia wreath was just to die for.<br /><br />Hanukkah:<br />Paper packages, a menorah, and satin stars are glowing and sparkling in Martha's hands.<br /><br />Here's what I found lacking:<br /><br />Often the crafts are more complex than one would want to become engaged in.<br /><br />The directions are not clear cut; that is, they are not in a \\"recipe/materials\\" format, but are listed in text, which I found to be more difficult to follow.  I needed to break it down for myself on my own paper.<br /><br />Diagrams sometimes took too much for granted, or at least seemed to expect the more experienced crafter could \\"fill in the blanks.\\"  I wasn't up to some of that!<br /><br />Several projects were quite time-consuming for very little return or impact.<br /><br />And, finally, I found the pictures too small in the working segments.<br /><br />Overall Rating:  3 stars ~ I can't hightly recommend it, but it's a good book to check out of the library...to become engaged in.

B000GKHM2S|3.0|I purchased a DVD from Amazon and found out when I got it that it was formatted to only play in Russia, Eastern Europe and Africa. I live in the USA and was still sent the purchase. I was told there was a disclaimer that there was a region code on it. I had to truly hunt to find that information! In my opinion it is not good business to sell with that type of info so hidden.
B003L77FYS|5.0|Wow.  Many of the reviews I've read here were dead on.  One thing that's occurred to me both in the series & personally, is that sometimes the friendship is so deep that it just doesn't need the \\"consummation\\" aspect.  Rick's certainly had many many women; does the relationship have to be sexual to be fulfilling?  I don't think so...sex can just become a physical act without really meaning much.  What do YOU think?
B004FOA84A|4.0|it's a great 1-2 hour game for fun. it was pretty challenging yet doable! good story and music, the last game was so hard though and the ending was strange..but worth the fun!
B000ICM5MG|5.0|Just thought someone should inform editorial reviewer J. Shannon that:<br />1.) Sly Stallone HAS INDEED had a respectable career, and<br />2.) The name of Rocky Balboa's manager isn't \\"Gus,\\" but Mickey Goldmill.<br />.<br /><br />Widely released on 12/3/76 and very much a Christmas film, the story of ROCKY occurs entirely during a holiday season. It begins on November 25th, with club boxer Rocky Balboa barely defeating a \\"tomato\\" named Spider Rico. Minus \\"expenses,\\" Rocky's winner's take is a poor day's wage.<br /><br />Holiday connections:<br />1.) There's an argument at Paulie's and Adrian's during Thanksgiving that ends with Paulie Pennino tossing the turkey Adrian prepared into the backyard. This leads to Balboa's first date with terminally shy Adrian: a memorable 10 minutes at an otherwise empty skating rink, then Adrian's tentative visit to Rocky's sad one-room apartment, and their first tender kiss.<br /><br />2.) Just before Christmas, a raging, drunken Paulie throws his sister out for good, and she moves in with Rocky, who's hard in training for the historic and epic Balboa/Creed bout, which takes place at the Philadelphia Spectrum on New Year's Day.<br /><br />ROCKY is in plain terms one of the greatest pictures ever made. For those who weren't there so long ago, you cannot imagine the emotional impact it had on theater audiences, all thanks to the melding of a beautiful love story, intense, skillfully photographed and edited fight scenes, plus perfect music. We were moved by the triumph of a perennial \\"loser\\" over the odds and his past; we cheered him wildly at story's end. Seeing nearly 30-year-old \\"spinster\\" Adrian and rudderless Rocky find each other, bond deeply and grow as people was and still is inspiring.<br /><br />By contrast, the only growth that Paulie experiences is the addition to his wardrobe of one garish blue sports jacket, paid for with part of the money he received for selling advertising space on Rocky's ring robe.<br /><br />At times a cartoonish caricature of Muhammad Ali, by the conclusion of their grueling 15 round battle, Apollo Creed seems a very real man, bloodied, exhausted and shaken to the core by the indomitable spirit and pulverizing left hand of his previously unknown opponent, Rocky Balboa.<br /><br />And get this: Not ONE vulgarity in the movie! How amazing is that?<br /><br />I watch ROCKY every holiday season, and always will. It's a story that never grows old.cartoonish caricature of Muhammad Ali, by the conclusion of their grueling 15 round battle, Apollo Creed seems a very real man, bloodied, exhausted and shaken to the core by the indomitable spirit and pulverizing left hand of his previously unknown opponent, Rocky Balboa.<br /><br />And get this: Not ONE vulgarity in the movie!

B0034G4P9E|5.0|\\"Warrior\\" is great! This is how the story goes: An ex-Marine haunted by a tragic past, Tommy Riordan returns to his hometown of Pittsburgh and enlists his father, a recovered alcoholic and his former coach, to train him for a mixed martial arts tournament awarding the biggest purse in the history of the sport. As Tommy blazes a violent path towards the title prize, his brother, Brendan, a former MMA fighter unable to make ends meet as a public school teacher, returns to the amateur ring to provide for his family. Even though years have passed, recriminations and past betrayals keep Brendan bitterly estranged from both Tommy and his father. But when Brendan's unlikely rise as an underdog sets him on a collision course with Tommy, the two brothers must finally confront the forces that tore them apart, all the while waging the most intense, winner-takes-all battle of their lives.  The cast led by Tom Hardy (as Tommy), Joel Edgerton (as Brendan) & Nick Nolte (in a terrific Oscar-worthy performance as Paddy Conlon) is great. The directing by Gavin O'Connor (who also co-wrote the story & screenplay and makes an appearance as J.J. Riley) is great. The story by O'Connor & Cliff Dorfman & the screenplay by O'Connor, Dorfman & Anthony Tambakis (who also co-produced) is great.  The music by Mark Isham is great. The cinematography by Masanobu Takayanagi is great. The film editing by Sean Albertson, Matt Chesse, John Gilroy & Aaron Marshall is great. The casting by Randi Hiller is great. The production design by Dan Leigh is great. The art direction by James Donahue is great. The set decoration by Ron von Blomberg is great. The costume design by Abigail Murray is great.  This is a great and well-made movie that is entertaining and well-crafted. This is also a heartwrenching film that keeps your mind thinking while your heart is racing. Tom Hardy & Joel Edgerton are terrific. This is one of the best films of the year.

B000002KKK|5.0|ZZ Top realized that it was time for a break after the grueling World Texas tour of 1976. They took an unofficial hiatus, during this time Gibbons traveled to Europe, Beard went to Jamaica, and Hill went down south to Mexico. When they finally came back in 1979, all but Beard had chest length beards. And thus, the popular phase of ZZ Top began with Deguello, Spanish for \\"no quarter.\\" It certainly sounds like a band with nothing to lose. Deguello had harder, sleeker, and nastier grooves than previous albums, and while the album had a slicker production, it amplified their humor and down-right perverseness.<br /><br />This album contains some of their biggest hits that they still play in concert, such as the Issac Hayes-penned I Thank You, the 12-bar blues of She Loves My Automobile and Dust My Broom, the smooth Cheap Sunglasses, and the sexiness of Fool For Your Stockings. Deguello broke into the Top 40, peaking at #24. Soon, they were heading over to Europe for the first time.<br /><br />This album also has a few curveballs as well, what with the VERY ODD Manic Mechanic. Dear Lord, that sounds like something Zappa would write! There's also some added saxophone played by all 3 members of the band.<br /><br />This is probably the last fully consistent album by ZZ Top. After this, the albums would slowly start to suffer more and more (Recycler comes to mind). So, enjoy it while you can.

B001B1UO6W|2.0|On the 8th day of christmas 2011 Im going to review...Child's Play. There are so many plotholes in this film that I can't type them all in one sitting. The acting is terrible at best. The premise is preposterous & stupid. The devices that made Chucky look like he was real are faulty at best. Worst of all,even thought the cast saids that Chucky's body is becoming more human,he can still move & LIVE without a head,with one arm and with only one leg. They to shoot it like a million times before he goes down for the count for good. Overall,while it is scary for some people,it's dated at best. I give this movie a 2 and a half out of 10.
B003OY91HW|4.0|I bought this recipe book mostly because I love Magnolias' cupcakes and I wanted to recreate, in Ohio, my favorite NYC indulgence.  I was also familiar with the Torey's other recipe books because my sister makes desserts quite often from another one.  I was disappointed to find that the recipes in this book are generally the exact same ones in my sisters'.  There is no doubt that there are some amazing recipes in this book, as I've received many rave reviews for a few desserts that I've made.  The cupcake recipe is also very authentic, as I replicate the exact flavor profile of the cupcakes I get in NYC.  However, I've found that I've really had to modify many of the recipes to improve on them.  I also find that I won't try recipes that are ridiculously unhealthy.  There is a raspberry bar that calls for about 8 sticks of butter for two dozen bars.  Also, Torey is not the original creator of most recipes, as I've grown up on many items in the book, like the cream cheese pudding bars, etc.  It just seems that she replaces milk rations for cream rations, and very much loves to overdo it on the shortbread crusts.  I have also taken several desserts to parties that weren't well received.  So, all in all, there are a few major keepers and the rest is mediocre, like most books.
B003LQMZS0|5.0|My son, now almost 7 months, loves this toy!  He started noticing it LONG before he noticed his other toys and it was the ONLY toy he played with in the beginning.  It is nice that the velcro is larger so that I can hook it to something and have the ability to let it hang a little lower or higher, depending on what he is in need of.  He is now to the point that I don't hang it on anything usually because he he perfers it on the floor or in his lap where he can manipulate it how he wants and chew on it if he would like.  I love all the different tectures and the main reason I got it, the black and white on it.  Which I have been told and read about that it is the best thing for babies under 6 months.  I would definetly recommend this toy for a friend!

Witty and well-paced, I could relate to both Emma and Dex in all their various incarnations. Maybe because I was so amused and entertained I didn't see the end coming, though some others have labelled it a cliche. A happy, enjoyable, unpretentious read and highly recommended.
0811879542|5.0|This is an amazing and clever book for pre-school children up to even adults. I love the interaction of the book's illustrations with the reader. I also like to watch the anticipation of the reader as each page is turned to reveal the action in the book.  It's amazing how adults become the children when reading it.  The simple water color dots make it a wonderful visual treat that keeps moving from page to page. The curious and the inquisitive always love to see the words, \\"Press Here\\",and they have to do it. As an educator and children's librarian, each year I always try to find the best-of-the-best children's book, recommend it and buy multiple copies from Amazon.com to give away. My favorite book of 2011 is Press Here by Herve Tullet.<br />Thank you,<br />Carol Fauth, Educator
B0054W4JQK|1.0|I seriously don't understand the extraordinary press this novel has received, nor its worldwide popularity. I found the entire premise very hard to run with, and all the tiresome little hooks and clues and plot devices amateurish at best. I only kept turning over each plodding page to see if the story/writing got any better. It didn't. Not being a fan of the 'thriller' genre (and I use this term charitably), I can only assume that I don't have a sufficiently seasoned palate to appreciate this kind of yarn. But really, the big 'twist' at the end was so telegraphed even I could see it coming a long way from the merciful end. If a dear friend had handed me this manuscript and asked for my opinion before shopping it around to publishers, I would have suggested a significant rewrite. Kindly, of course. But there it is - a screaming success, film rights sold, author feted at international book fairs, etc. So what do I know? Just not my cup of tea, I suppose.
B005HSG3VK|5.0|I love the folio cover that i purchased for my kindle fire.  It is lightweight and easy to use.  I recommend it for anyone who has a kindle fire.
B003PPDBQ2|2.0|I bought this (with one-click) based on all the great reviews as I had never heard of Rosamund Lupton before. I really wanted to like this book (doesn't one always want to love one's latest book?) but I found it supremely annoying. The character of Beatrice was just plain irritating. Her habit of 'naming' other characters according to their physical appearance or their mannerisms (e.g. Miss Crush Secretary) has been 'old' for some time now. And Ms Lupton uses this device repeatedly throughout the novel. Discovering who the bad guy was at the end of the novel packed all the thrill of an episode of Midsomer Murders. As for the big twist...for once I'd like to read a 'thriller' so assured it doesn't need The Big Twist at the end. I'm all for attempts at fusing genres, by the way (Cormac MacCarthy being the ultimate purveyor of such genre-morphing perfection; Stephen King also manages it well on a different plane), and I think this is what Ms Lupton has tried to do - meld a whodunit with a bit of literary drama; but it fails dismally in this endeavour. My one-click finger won't be rushing to download another of Ms Lupton's efforts any time soon.
B00364K6YW|5.0|I purchased this first in Video tapes and wore them out. I now have the DVD and still love watching Colin Firth & Jennifer Ehle, they are both great in their parts, as was the entire cast. It's a beautiful production!
B005LY4B0A|5.0|awesome app. need more videos for each level. also possibly a different mode? i.e. bugs fight back etc but other than that great app.
B0052UZIFA|2.0|Not compatible with my Droid 1. Just upgraded to a Galaxy Nexus, and it's constantly freezing. I guess I missed the window of phones that will actually run this game.
0439023521|5.0|This may be a young adult book, but it is certainly enjoyable for adults too. I was sucked into this series and read them all in about a week. The love triangle between three of the main characters gets a little annoying at moments, a little \\"Twilighty\\". Other than that, however, this series definitely deserves 5 stars!
B002SRQ214|5.0|I have had this processor since January, and it has done everything I have asked it to do...........Quickly.  I use my PC for video encoding(Power Director 10), DVD authoring(PD10), music recording/mixing/mastering(Sonar X1), gaming, word processing, and graphic design with with the Adobe Suite CS4. This little gem as helped me do all of those tasks quickly, for a good price. I have this paired with a GTX 460 from MSI, a 500 GB HD for the programs, and a separate 1TB drive for storage, and this PC rocks! It should suit me well for the next several years......and considering many programs today have yet to utilize more than 2 cores, it should suit many folks for a while.   I've got it overclocked to 4.2 on a Gigabyte board..it is a 4+1 phase MB, and hasn't killed this board since I have it OC'd, so it isn't sucking TOO much extra juice. Meaning, that you can probably get a basic, \\"cheap\\" board, and run this baby at stock, or even a slight overclock, without damaging your motherboard.   I'd recommend ANY of the Phenom 11 X4 series CPU's, they are plenty for my needs, and I'm suspecting, the needs of many others.  MY current Specs  Gigabyte 880gm-Ud2H  Phenom II X4 965 BE  MSI N460GTX 1GB cyclone  500 GB Caviar Blue (programs)  1 TB Seagate Barracuda (storage), 5900 RPM drive  ASUS DVD burner  Lite-ON DVD Burner  OCZ 700 MODXSTREAM PRO PSU   P236 Acer Monitor,  Logitech 100 mouse/wireless keyboard combo.

1419702238|5.0|The book is very interesting, my son like it so much. This is the last one of the series. We wish the new book of this series will come out soon. Thank the author.
0671027344|5.0|Absolutely fabulous story about the struggles of adolescence. Very moving, and a quick read. This book got me interested in reading again, as I hadn't picked up a leisure book since starting college. I definitely recommend it!
0201433079|5.0|Two things I like about this book are<br /><br />1. The book focuses heavily on standards and portability. Throughout the book, API and implementations are described according to the SUS or XSI standards.  However, to book maintains a firm grasp on reality by tracking 4 real Unix-like systems, Solaris, Linux, Mac OS X, and FreeBSD throughout and noting implementation specific exceptions and extensions where applicable.<br /><br />2. A lot of illustrative example code is included.  In some cases API functions are re-implemented to make it clear exactly how it works.<br /><br />APUEv2 reads quite easily as a beginner's introduction to programming in the Unix environment.  However it also includes a great deal of tables, charts, and figures to make it suitable as a reference for the more experienced programmer, useful as a back-up in case the local man pages are not available.<br /><br />As mentioned in the foreword, readers should be comfortable with the C language itself before attempting to dive in to Unix programming.
B001KZIRL8|5.0|Fast shipment and product was as described without any damage. I would buy products from this person again. Thanks for the DVD!
0307405095|5.0|I enjoy shopping Amazon. It is not as complicated some sights are.  I do not like being asked personal questions when I shop, nor do I like pop-up ads some sites put you through.  I know exactly what I want before I order and do not like jumping through hoops to get there.  I originally went to E-Bay several years ago, and could not navigate establishing credit with them. I did not have a problem with Amazon in this way and that I appreciate.  I have been with you ever since. (And I have a great credit rating).
0891419063|5.0|This is a fabulous first-person account of the later campaigns in the Pacific theater of WWII.  I'd recommend it to anyone interested.
006112429X|5.0|This chilling story does not resolve the old question of whether some people are born bad or become so through inappropriate upbringing but it gives us some ideas to think about.  It also reminds us that, while someone intent on murder will always find some sort of weapon, the easy availability of guns makes it possible for the assassin to turn murder into a massacre.
B005V2EVBQ|4.0|When I purchased a Kindle Fire, I immediately sought out a case to protect my newest electronic. I found the Versa cases first that were around $40 and were designed to look like antique books. I loved their design so bought one. It arrived 1 wk before my Kindle Fire but when I went to put my K Fire into the case it wouldn't fit. The product description was for a Fire but it was obviously made for other Kindle ereaders and then re-sold for Fires as well. I immediately sought out returning it and set out to find another case. This case is $10 cheaper, more durable, has a band to hold the cover on or off, and it can morph into a stand for hands-free use. Although not as stylish as other cases, it does the job of protection which is what matters most. I hope that one day they can create graphic designs onto this product. Very recommendable.
B00129H7VS|5.0|Incredible, emotional, action filled, intense drama, that will have you on your seat and make you feel like you are there along side the soldiers.
1451627289|5.0|This book is one of the best I've read in awhile.  Being the first Steven King novel that I've read, I must say that this is an excellent author.  The way he describes the scenes and the characters is top notch (I'd be afraid to read his horror stories- with the ability to describe the scene this well, they must be terrifying).<br /><br />The characters in this book are believable and ones that you grow attached to.  The lead character is a complex individual who is often conflicted and alone- it makes the reader relate to him since, as we are thinking \\"what would I do if I went back in time in this situation?\\" so is he.  The lead character Jake/George (real name/alternate name he takes in the past) is the narrator, and this provides a unique glimpse into his thought processes and mindset.<br /><br />The time travel mechanism in this story is quite original, and lends itself to different scenarios than say 'Back to the Future' or other stories where the protagonist readily has a time machine at his or her disposal.  Since the nature of the time mechanism is slowly revealed over the story, and discussing it in detail would require some spoilers, it suffices to say that it is an interesting take on the time travel genre.<br /><br />While the time travel is interesting, I don't think that the main audience of this book is sci-fi junkies.  Rather, the strength lies in the characters and their relationships with one another.  The bonds that Jake/George forges with the other characters are something quite special and memorable.  When the main characters experience triumph or hardship, you feel happy or sad respectively.  They aren't simply one dimensional characters without attachment.<br /><br />Those who want to debate the book on the \\"what if\\" scenarios it creates due to changing certain events in history, I believe, have missed the mark.  King even admits in the epilogue that some of the events that unfold are only 'one of many' and not the 'only' possible outcome to the changing of certain events.<br /><br />I have read criticisms about this book based around its ending.  I will not include spoilers, but I must say that the ending was a necessary part of the story, not a disjointed separation from the rest of the story (as some have claimed).  One of the beauties of this book is that it keeps you guessing for most of the time- Up until about 90% of the way through, it is still very unclear how the story will turn out.<br /><br />Overall, this book is a masterpiece.  While King does do a decent job explaining the events surrounding the JFK assassination, I did find internet pages describing the assassination to be quite helpful in providing more details to the history of the story, as well as actual footage (readily available online) of JFK in Florida on Nov 18, 1963 (4 days before the assassination) and video of the JFK motorcade on the actual day of 11/22/63.  Such extra sources are not necessary to understand this book, but do provide greater historical perspective and thus give a greater appreciation for this book.  This book is 850+ pages, but it is one of the fastest reads I've had in a long time, especially considering the length of the book.  I couldn't put it down.  I highly recommend this book to anyone with the time to read it.the changing of certain events.<br /><br />I have read criticisms about this book based around its ending.

B005IZLPMY|4.0|This is exactly as expected.  A fun movie that will entertain and make you proud to be an American.  It's not a classic or award worthy.  It's just entertaining.
B003V99B16|4.0|I purchased the entire album in MP3 and play it on the Amazon Cloud, I love the music and the quality of the music, but some of the songs got cut short as they are continuous to the next song, and therefore, if you don't play them in sequence, it will appear the music is cut.

B0054VVRBQ|5.0|I purchased this reader to replace the stock card reader on my 2008 Toshiba Satellite Laptop running Windows Vista 32 bit. The stock card reader was giving me read/write times maxing out at 25Mb/s with a very fast Sandisk Extreme SDHC Class 10 UHS-1 4GB card(the max GB that Vista ReadyBoost will allow). This Transcend reader installed, flush with the port, in a snap. After a quick driver download from Transcend's website, I plugged the reader into my laptop's Expressport 34/54 slot(which uses a very fast PCI-Express bus) and vavoom; plug and play drivers installed and ready to go. The difference in performance was immediate. I was now clocking speeds almost up to 50Mb/s on the same Sandisk 4MB card(which also inserted flush into the Transcend card reader). The practical improvement in the Vista OS due to the ReadyBoost improvement was also, immediately noticeable. The laptop now runs faster than it did when I first purchased it back in late 2008.     If you have an older laptop/card reader and wish to bring to back the speed; this Transcend card reader is the way to go. It's reasonably priced and works just as well as it claims it does. This turned out to be a much better(and more practical/cosmetically feasible) alternative for a Windows laptop ReadyBoost speed enhacement than using a \\"fast\\" USB flash thumb drive(which is a slower bus than the Expresscard's PCI-express bus) which inconveniently juts out of the side of the laptop(making it impossible to pick up and go easily).
B003Y5H574|3.0|***SPOILERS*** PLEASE DO NOT READ IF YOU WANT TO BE TOTALLY SURPRISED WHEN YOU WATCH THE MOVIE YOURSELF<br /><br />The casting for this movie is superb. The plot is realistic. The screenplay is smart. I laughed a lot. I cried a little. I loved all the characters. My problem was that this movie got a PG-13 rating even though it involved a 17-year-old taking nude photos of herself with the intent of giving them to a 40-year-old man (don't worry, she gives them to the 13-year-old she babysits instead), and a bit of \\"sexting\\" involving the 13-year-old. Not to mention the whole story is laced with careless sex. I would NOT want my teenager to watch this movie at all, but if they did I would want to have watched it myself and be able to talk about these things.
B000UVT3OI|5.0|What a value! A DVD of Garth and company performing his greatest hits, mostly live, and two CDs full of the same songs--who could ask for more? Classics like Shameless and The Dance, and many other fun songs are included.
B000BJ7BCK|5.0|This movie rocks! It's totally fun! And hilarious! Subtle jokes abound, along with laugh out loud scenes. And the DVD was only $5.99!
