B0064TVQ5E|4.0|fun and frustrating when you are sucked on a level and can not get all three stars for a long period of time.
B0086700CM|1.0|I downloaded this app, and I right away uninstalled it. It was soo glitchy, and slowed down my kindle. The one I downloaded from a link at youtube was better. SUCKS!

B0086700CM|5.0|I very much enjoy Temple run. it is fast paced an very addictive. i am frustrated when i cant win but cant wait to keep playing.
B004SBQGHS|1.0|What a pita Amazon apps are. You must type in your user name and password to use most of them. I've uninstalled all of them and will no longer be using my Amazon account including the storage space I paid 20 bucks for. By the way Angry birds is fine.
B0088RQ4X4|4.0|The title of this review says it all. Science fiction's movie canon goes unchallenged, but still, this movie was good enough. Blade Runner, Gattica, Contact, these are still my favorites, but nonetheless I'm not displeased with my rental of John Carter. I was sufficiently entertained.
B0086700CM|4.0|pretty good game,  could have been better. but I have to say it is addictive! I was very happy it was free too :)  I've been waiting since I got my kindle to get this game!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|keeps me occupied! at least they are games that aren't to hard to pick up on.<br />people will enjoy it while waiting
B006H8BIIM|1.0|these greedy garbage apps are starting to become an amazon staple. is this how amazon wants to define itself? less a game than a money pit...
B006H8BIIM|1.0|In Space Station: Frontier, you are in command of a mining station.  You build out a power network and connect mining drones, power generators and weapons, while trying to defend the power grid and station against incoming fighters, destroyers and battleships.<br /><br />This is a 5 star game.  The graphics are great, it has a good story line, and the gameplay is excellent.  Unfortunately, it is completely ruined by In-App Purchasing.  The developer has chosen to make it impossible to proceed in the campaign mode until you have purchased upgrades.  You can spend real cash to get the upgrades, or grind for hours to earn enough credits.<br /><br />After the third level, the game advises you to play endless mode to earn more credits and upgrade your station before continuing in campaign mode.  I played for 15 minutes before I got bored and let the enemy win, and in all that time I'd managed to accumulate just 120 credits.  Let's see what that would buy....  The Missile Launcher is 300 credits, so I'd need to play for at least another 20 minutes before I could buy that.  The Interceptor Laser is 150 credits, so I can't buy that one yet either.  A Rail Cannon is 500 points, that's probably around 45 minutes more play.  Power Generator, 300 credits, Power Storage is 150, Repair Stations, 400.  Proton Torpedoes cost a whopping 2000 credits, that's well over 4 hours of mind-numbing play to earn those.  And there are other station upgrades that speed up your energy recharge or capacity, health, and other stats; all of these have 2 to 20 levels each.<br /><br />To upgrade everything requires just shy of 15,000 credits.  At about 120 credits for 15 minutes of \\"endless\\" play, it would require over 31 hours to earn enough to fully upgrade the station.  And it is very difficult to complete the campaign mode without all the upgrades.<br /><br />In-App Purchasing in a paid game is bad enough, but when the developer makes it nearly impossible to finish the game without spending more money, it's just downright greedy.<br /><br />The app used to have OpenFeint, but it was allegedly removed.  It still has Full Internet Access and Modify/Delete SD Card Contents permissions, however.<br /><br />5 stars, minus 1 star for questionable permissions, minus infinity stars for blatantly evil use of IAP.money, it's just downright greedy.<br /><br />The app used to have OpenFeint, but it was allegedly removed.

B0054JZC6E|5.0|I think the game is really fun although some of the games are next to impossible to actually beat but its a fun game overall.
1439153663|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed most of this novel; however, I was very disappointed with the ending. It seemed rushed, and little care was taken to thoroughly describe the events and the effects on the characters. I was looking for a totally satisfying taste of revenge, but it was quickly sketched over and left me wanting more. As mentioned in some other reviews, the accents were not always accurate (Lavinia's Irish accent totally neglected.) The rest of the book, however, kept me turning pages, and I loved the two perspectives from which the tale was told.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I love this game!!! though its hard at times,its awesome to play when bored and it works great on my kindle fire!!! you should absolutely get it!!!
B004T2QZL8|5.0|Doodle God is one of the best apps I've ever played. it was so fun and sometimes id laugh at what made what. if u don't like this app then you are crazy. sometimes id have to use hints because I didn't know what to do next even though id really prefer not to and do it myself. please do me a tabor and get this app. s
B005HSL626|5.0|I love this game. it is preparing me for when I'm older and I'm battling my own fruit in the kitchen who knows a bomb could be stored in my fruit!! :)
B007I2BZIE|5.0|This is a great album that Rush has put out. It has the complete thought and story line that I felt Snakes and Arrows was lacking. The sound is almost uniquely Rush's with mixes of some modern influences lightly placed.<br /><br />It is absolutely necessary to read the lyrics and storyline provided in the liner notes to understand the story in the album fully. So make sure and buy this in CD form to get the booklet.
B008AG3PK8|5.0|I know this series is a male oriented one, but I find the females much more compelling and interesting. Hopefully they will dive in with the upcoming 60's and women's lib and all.I think the writers must either have an axe to grind with the Betty, or the actress playing her to diminish her so much and make her so pathetic and mean.<br />Lanes wife standing up to Don was poetic, along with Megan's mother. Poor Joan, the only way to get to the top was to well, you know. Unlike Peggy who is on to bigger and better things. What a great storyline for next season...I hope!<br />I will miss Lane also. Another bullet to Dons chest. Roger I find more and more entertaining. He is always the party. It was good chemistry between him and his ex wife (the 1st one) and of course Megans mom. But with Joan getting divorced and having his baby...that could be very interesting as well!<br />Not sure what that whole scene with Don hooking up with a former gf and then choking her to death, and pushing her under the bed was all about. I know it wasnt real, but what was the point?<br />I love this series, even as low as these boys go, I still watch!
B0083GOPSG|3.0|Good quality streaming movie. The contenent itself was rather dull. Too bad, the story had potential. I liked the mock-u-mentarty style though.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|awesome waffles and a good op time yo.  I like it playing this game I also like gummy bears. fun game lots of endless times.
B005LAIGJQ|1.0|I like most of Eddie Murphy's movies, but this is horrible.  I never understood the plot or if there was one.  After I dozed off once, I turned it off about half the way through.
159413586X|5.0|It was the best book of the series (3)!  I did not want to put it down. Well done, Suzanne Collins!
B000006JQ5|5.0|This was the best collection of all time Maiden, perfect piece of rarity, recommended to all fans who want Iron complete your collection, run, it is rare.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This book took a hold of me in a way that only the best fiction books can.  I was immersed from the 3rd page of the omnibus and from that point on I had to finish it.  A day and a half later I completed the wonderful task and I can say without a doubt that Mr. Hugh Howey is a world class story teller.<br /><br />It is definitely worth your time, your money, and your interest.  You won't be disappointed.
B0063GORYU|4.0|Spider is a great game to play for fun or relaxation and its appropriate for the whole family. Rated G.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|lots of fun<br />have not stopped playing. since I started. going to have to stop sometime. lol. like the characters. and the clear picture.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|This book was am amazing read. I was very skeptical at first but fell in love with the characters. It wasnt a hard read by any means nut i loved it.
B007I2BZIE|4.0|This latest (and hopefully not last) incarnation of Rush might not be my favorite, but I don't dislike it at all. What they have wrought in these past two albums with Booujzhe is what happens when true fans of music get together and have fun. I'm energized by the eager enthusiasm & anything-goes spirit infusing these songs.<br /><br />These may not be the trio's strongest songs in the discography but they are certainly well-built with beefy melodies and retro-good hooks. Rush still have the musical chops they had in the 70's. I'm not even sure if their younger versions could keep up!<br /><br />While lyrically a concept album, each song stands on its own musically. This is not the 2012 Overture. And it's no 2112 Overture either (it's no instant classic) but it is another solid piece of work by the band. And if steampunk has a sound, then this is what it sounds like.
B002WEQHU4|4.0|Like almost every cinematic bio, Michael Mann's ALI is necessarily episodic and contains a number of factual errors. The most glaring: Howard Cosell didn't call the Rumble in the Jungle (it was David Frost). The \\"Ali comes out to meet Frazier, Frazier starts to retreat...\\" doggerel was actually recited prior to the first Sonny Liston fight. Belinda's argument with Muhammad over his GF happened in Manila, not Zaire.<br /><br />Although he little resembles the brawnier Ali, Will Smith has the champ's vocal inflections down and he does a credible job in ring sequences. Jon Voight really channels Howard Cosell. The voice is so right, close your eyes when this actor speaks and it's as if Howard lives again.<br /><br />This two-and-a half-plus hour film covers Ali's life and boxing career up to his 1974 underdog victory in Zaire over a much-younger George Foreman. The Liston fights are here, plus Ernie Terrell's \\"What's my name?\\"thrubbing by Ali, the bloodying of Jerry Quarry and extended recreations of the first match with Joe Frazier. There's fragments of their second bout, but that's about it for ring scenes. No Thrilla in Manila or Jimmy Ellis breaking Ali's jaw. Nothing on George Chuvalo<br /><br />The script doesn't shy away from Ali's marriage troubles, and makes clear that he knew both Herbert Muhammad and Don King were opportunistic money grubbers. Ali's dealings with Malcolm X are here, as is that activist's public murder. The champ's opposition to the Vietnam War, charges of draft dodging that resulted in a 3½ year suspension from boxing and loss of his title are also of primary importance.<br /><br />In the boxing bio genre there's only a handful of films that are this one's superior. Among them are [[ASIN:B00062IVKS RAGING BULL]] (1980), the Jake LaMotta story starring Robert DeNiro, [[ASIN:B00066FABM THE GREAT WHITE HOPE]] (1970), a play adaptation with James Earl Jones as Jack Johnson (first black heavyweight champ), and [[ASIN:B0006GAO8Q ROCKY MARCIANO]] (1999) with Jon Favreau, a TV movie about the only undefeated heavyweight champion.<br /><br />Parenthetical number preceding title is a 1 to 10 IMDb viewer poll rating.<br /><br />(6.7) Ali (2001) - Will Smith/Jamie Foxx/Jon Voight/Mario Van Peebles/Ron Silver/Jeffrey Wright/Jada Pinkett Smith/Paul Rodriguez/Bruce McGill/Giancarlo Esposito/LeVar Burton/Michael Dorn(1999) with Jon Favreau, a TV movie about the only undefeated heavyweight champion.<br /><br />Parenthetical number preceding title is a 1 to 10 IMDb viewer poll rating.<br /><br />(6.7) Ali (2001) - Will Smith/Jamie Foxx/Jon Voight/Mario Van Peebles/Ron Silver/Jeffrey Wright/Jada Pinkett Smith/Paul Rodriguez/Bruce McGill/Giancarlo Esposito/LeVar Burton/Michael Dorn
B001RMYWG8|4.0|Uh, I WOULD like to review it if I could see it.  It's advertised as a PRIME movie, but when you click to see it, you have to rent it.  Payday is in two days and I'm obviously low on funds now.....but there are several movies advertised as prime movies that aren't.  I've seen most of this movie and just wanted to \\"finish it up\\" so to speak.  Purple Rain (Prince) is also advertised as prime and you have to rent that one too.
B0088RQ4X4|5.0|This movie was much better than I expected given all of the publicity about how much money it lost at the box office.  The story line held my interest and although no one will be receiving academy award nominations for acting, the graphics and special effects were noteworthy.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I love how you never run out of games. Every games different and hard .I thought that it's a cool game all together
B006R8GK2Q|4.0|strange in the first minutes, the story became more interesting with time. try it and you will make your own opinion on this game.

B0071XO8RA|4.0|I was apartment-sitting for a friend and found this on his bookshelf. 24 hours later, I had read all 535 pages. A fun story set in a world that only grows richer and more detailed as you go. Definitely worth buying, especially if you get the Kindle edition.

B0086700CM|4.0|this game is a lot of fun and very additive. it some times doesn't sense the swipes and you can fall off the edge from it but other than that its fun.
B007UXSPK2|5.0|Really like this movie. Jeremy renner is great in it. The M:I franchise never gets old to me. Tom cruise is truly a movie star.

God has truly blessed this young lady with a most beautiful voice.  You will not be disappointed when you buy this one!
B0086700CM|5.0|A great game like this should be ATLEAST 0.99. The graphics and gameplay are much better than the iphone version. The iphone version lags while the kindle version doesn't. This is a great game everyone should get.
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|love the game.  would love it even more if you would update it!  I have friends playing on Apple products and they have updated word lists and get more coins.  would give it five stars if updated!
B0086700CM|5.0|finally on android.  love it on my fire.  I remember looking all over for this game when I saw it on my cousin's ipad.  finally I can get in on the fun too!

B004MC8CA2|5.0|this is a great app with lots of translations.  it is easy to navigate, even for my children and the younger ones enjoy the read aloud feature.  I like this app so much I had it on nh phone, too.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I am a fan of Lifechurch.tv and when I saw that this was their Bible app, I had to get it. They offer so many FREE translations and reading plans, I could not contain myself! I am a youth pastor and this resource allows me to be able to seemlessly swap through different Bibles to be able to find the right words so my kids can understand the topic at hand. This is a must have for anyone in the ministry!

B0086700CM|4.0|interesting design and easy to play no money required.<br />I like the game play and although the plot is simple its still fun to play.
0375869026|5.0|I'm the mother of two young children and an avid reader. Someone in the children's section of a bookstore mentioned this book to me and although it's too advanced for my children's reading level I decided to read it myself. I am happy that I did. I will save this title for when my they are older and I will recommend it to everyone I know, as well purchase a copy for our school library. It is a beautifully written book with an important, ageless and universal message. Thank you R.J. Palacio..
B0086700CM|5.0|this app is great. I know what u r thinking - how is running away from evil demon monkeys fun - it is because u r not just beating a high score - u r earning coins and bonuses along the way. best game ever!
B0064JV4LU|4.0|\\"The Intouchables\\" (2011 movie from France; 112 min.) brings the real life story (more on that later) of Philippe, a wealthy tetraplegic, and Driss, a young and poor man from the ghettos, who is hired as his live-in carer. Driss seems to not care about much but himself, although he is also dealing with family issues in parts of the movie. But Driss and Philippe strike a bond, and become closer as the movie develops. I don't want to give more away from the plot as you'll just have to see how it all plays out, but I will say there are some surprises.<br /><br />That said, this is a great mocie, and as such the \\"feel good\\" movie of the year so far. It was a packed house when I saw it this weekend at my local indie theatre here in Cincinnati, and the crowd just loved it, laughing at many occasions. But the movie really didn't hit home for me until the credits rolled and, low and behold, it brought some actual footage from the real Philippe and Driss in one of the scenes recreated in the movie. Moreover, we are then also told what happened to these guys in real life since then.<br /><br />François Cluzet (as Philippe) and Omar Sy (as Driss) provide superb performances, and in fact Sy won the French equivalent of the Oscar for Best Actor, and rightfully so. In all, this is a great movie. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
B005LAIHGI|4.0|\\"You lied to me and your wanted for war crimes!\\" General Admiral Alladeen (Cohen) has the perfect life. He is the dictator of an oil rich country and all he has to do is make a signal and people die. He is a multiple gold medal winning athlete and can pretty much but whatever or whoever he wants. When he refuses to let UN inspectors into his country to look for weapons the US threatens attacks. While in New York to talk to the UN his second in command tries to have him killed and institute democracy in his country. Alladeen tries everything to make sure that doesn't happen. I have to say that I think Cohen is the Andy Kaufman of this generation. His comedy is the type where it makes you a little uncomfortable and you laugh but also wish he would stop and that you never saw it. If you have seen \\"Borat\\" you know what I mean. For me he is usually a little too much and crosses the line from funny to obscene. I didn't think that \\"Bruno\\" was that funny and in that one he seemed to just try and make people mad more then laugh. All that said this is far and away his best movie. There are the scenes in this where you laugh as you look away and thing you laugh at that you know you shouldn't but for the most part this is pretty mainstream (for him). I will say this is not for the easily offended though but there are some really really funny lines in this. This is another movie where if you like Cohen you will watch and if you don't you won't but this is his best movie so far and more like \\"Borat\\" then \\"Bruno\\". Overall, very very funny, somewhat offensive but I think very much worth watching. I laughed really hard many times. I give it a B+.
B003UESJH4|2.0|This is one movie that really does not live up to the hype surrounding it. I had heard from multiple sources that it was a great film, so, in spite of my skepticism, I decided to watch it. I was not impressed. The only reason why I rated this a two-star movie instead of a one-star flick is that Colin Firth did a decent job of his acting. Other than that, I have a major problem with the subject of the movie. How many people have speech impediments (and insecurity problems) and NEVER get the help that they need? Why is this story more worthwhile than any other because the main character (who was inflicted with a speech impediment and insecurity) was a king? I'm sorry, but it is hard for me to pity a snob whose sole claim to fame is being born into a royal family no matter what his insecurities are. Everyone has problems, there's no denying that, but the vast majority of us do not have millions of tax dollars (or pounds sterling, in this case) and the whole world's obsequious deference thrown at us for no real reason. People who love this movie seem to have conveniently forgotten that the real political leader and speaker who guided the British people through WWII was Winston Churchill (who had to overcome his own speech impediments). I wonder, what does the hype over this movie say about class issues to this very day?
B0083SBMBM|4.0|\\"There was an idea to bring together a group of remarkable people, so when we needed them, they could fight the battles that we never could.\\" After the God Loki finds his way to Earth, steals the powerful Tesseract and is close to fulfilling his goal of destroying the planet there is only one group that can stop him. After years of recruiting Nick Fury's (Jackson) team is ready. This is a movie that people will pretty much just watch without any prompting or reading reviews because of the hype and build up but I'll do one anyway. I have to start by saying that I never was a huge comic book movie person. When they first started being made it was pretty much just how much stuff can we explode and how cool can we make it look. Over the years they have been getting better and better and I think the success of the \\"Batman\\" movies by Christopher Nolan has raised the bar. He has shown that a real story, plot and great acting can make a typical \\"popcorn\\" movie into a legitimate movie. All the years of honing the genre have led to this. Not only is this a fun movie to watch but it is also a great acted movie and everyone is perfectly cast. Downey is the leader but is in no way overpowering and this has the feel of a real ensemble cast movie in the way that \\"Crash\\" did. After years of movies like the \\"Fantastic 4\\" and \\"Spiderman\\" they finally realized the key to not just making a good comic book movie, but a great movie period. Good acting and writing are needed. Both are on display here. I have said for years that I am not a comic book movie fan...this movie may have changed my mind. Overall, not just a good and fun comic book movie but a good a fun movie...period. I give it an A-.
B007VGXS8M|2.0|I don't even know what happens in the game because I had to install someting .so I didn't even get a chance to play.so i cant really give a review on the game.
B004MC8CA2|3.0|I enjoy having this bible app. It's so handy to have at my fingertip. Having the ability to carry all 66 books on my phone and my internet pad makes me very Happy.
B004QOB8SO|5.0|This new take on Sir Arthur Conan-Doyle's master slueth is terriffic!  Benedict Cumberbatch is supurb as Sherlock, who is a 21st Century \\"consulting detective,\\" snd is reffered to as \\"the freak\\" by some of the Scotland Yard detectives.  Martin Freeman plays Dr. John Watson, a combat veteran of Afghanistan who blogs about the adventures of his roommate, and is constantly trying to defend himself against the suggestions that the two are \\"a couple\\".<br />Make no mistake, I am a huge fan of Conan-Doyle, and still enjoy reading one of the original stories, but in the modern version, Sherlock's genius is even more impressive when played against the current technologies.  Technology, in as far as the making of modern movies, is where these 90-minute gems excell.  As Sherlock observes, titles are briefly provided to help the viewer \\"see\\" what Sherlock sees.  The result is a very enjoyable season of intrigue, murder, and shocking twists.<br />Well Well worth the price.
B007JM4CWY|5.0|Great game. Gets you thinking, which I love. I also like how new puzzle keep getting added. Actually thinking of purchasing to get colors.
0375842381|3.0|Compared to ice and fire series. It is a mediocre series.  A great book is about describing characters. The world this book created does not fully make sense. Maybe good for teenagers. But if you need something with more depth, this is not the book series for you.
B0041D843M|5.0|I became interested in becoming a \\"no oil vegan\\" after seeing the video \\"Forks Over Knives\\" last year.  I am 63 years old with my father dying last year and his older brother, my uncle, dying in 2005.  Father lived to be 95 while uncle lived to be 94.  Both drank heavily, much more than 3-4 drinks per day (both favored gin for the last 20 years of their lives).  After finishing The China Study, I can better see differences between my father and my uncle and try to improve my own life.  They had the same body type and the same parents, but not much else in common, other than the love for gin and tobacco.  They both smoked.  My father a pipe and my uncle his cigarettes.  Both gave it up about the same time - perhaps 20 years before they died.  Neither quit the alcohol until death.<br />My father loved sausages, bologna and liverwurst.  We always had eggs and bacon or sausage with usually grits (with butter) and always whole milk for breakfast.  Meat was always served for dinner, with sandwiches for lunch.  Velveeta was the cheese of choice.  There were no legumes that I can remember except for the black eyed peas in Hoppin John  on New Year's day.  Some vegetables were eaten, but very little fruit, except by my mother.  I could write pages on her, but figured that the two brothers would be more related to The China Study.  Vegetables were usually cooked with some sort of pork, and cooked way too long as is prevalent in the south.  My parents lived near Charleston, SC all of their lives, while uncle lived in the city.  Father had open heart surgery twice, one in his 70's and the other in his late 80's.  I know of at least two pacemakers that were installed.  Father had macular degeneration and was legally blind by his late 80's.  He had many skin cancers removed.  He could barely climb five stairs the last five years of his life.  He was taking eight prescription drugs, plus many more over the counter, for the last five years of his life.  My mother was taking more.  Ican't tell you how hard it is to keep track of pills.  Looking back, the surgeons, doctors and prescription drugs kept both parents alive, even though the quality of life left much to be desired.  My parents needed help the last 5 years of their lives.  Phrase to describe father:  Lived to be only in shorts worshiping the sun.<br />Uncle on the other hand took no drugs (not counting that gin) except hydrocodone for arthritis pain.  Most in the family have arthritis.  He had no major surgery and ate less animal products than my family did.  He did have milk with his cereal (instead of our bacon/eggs/grits), but ate very little meat.  He also ate lots of legumes.  Both brothers liked various Campbell's soups.  When uncle died, we found things like rice crackers and the like in his apartment.  The refrigerator did not have the Velveeta, sausages and liverwurst that were always  in my parents' house.  We had whole milk with every meal, uncle only had skim milk (after it was available) with his breakfast.  He was living alone, and driving some of the not so fortunate in his apartment complex to doctors, etc.  He was self sufficient, to include driving, until he died.  Phrase to describe uncle:  Never ate in a restaurant his whole life, always in long pants, long sleeve shirt, sunglasses and hat.<br />I didn't put the difference into perspective until reading The China Study.  I started taking a statin in 2003 when my cholesterol was 265.  I was then eating no legumes or fruit, almost no vegetables, but lots of grilled steak, fried chicken and fish, with white rice or potatoes.  If I had to pick favorite foods, fried chicken or a Velveeta sandwich with Dukes mayonnaise on white bread with cold milk would have been at the top of the list.  The statin immediately dropped my cholesterol to the 150 range.  No doctors asked what I was eating, so I continued to eat the same way.  And I was thanking my lucky stars that I wouldn't have to have all those heart operations due to the magic pill.  Blood pressure readings did however start to go up a bit in the last 5 years.  Course there are pills for that too.  Last year I started having what may have been some side effects from the statin, but perhaps just aging problems.  After reading The China Study and doing a bit of research, I have serious doubts that pills will keep my arteries in top notch condition, and am now convinced that eating plants is the way to go.  I would hate to think that a statin or other pill might be causing problems as I age.<br />Since January 2012 my wife and I have been eating plant based with no added oils or salt, and only straying, but not much, and no more than once a week when eating out.  The statin was stopped when I went plant based.  My cholesterol spiked up to 211 after 3 weeks, but dropped to 150 after five months - no drugs except for gin, and I feel 10 years younger.<br />The other night I had a dream; my father told me that he would have done as we are doing had he only known.  I wish someone had told him.  Thank you Dr. Campbell for telling me.  Thank you for The China Study.  john
B0077SGMXM|5.0|Got this game as the faotd. Lots of courses to play. Very challenging game that makes you think before you hit. Great time waster.

B0086700CM|3.0|this game is awesome until it starts malfunctioning then its no fun. I have a kindle fire and I love this game but I was so disappointed when it started malfunctioning. I waited forever for it to come out and I was so happy when it did. so I gave it three stars because its a good game but it malfunctions I tried uninstalling it but it didn't work.
B0086700CM|3.0|great game gets kinda boring at times but usually fun.<br />but for some reason on the kindle fire everytime I collect coins it get all glitchy.really annoying.

0345803485|1.0|I teach English and Literature at the 11th and 12th grade level. My boyfriend heard about this book and recommended that I read it. Luckily I found them at a yard sale for .50 each because had I paid more I would be rather upset. Just read the first three sentences, you'll then understand. Honestly I think my teen students would love this writing; but any mature adult reader will be bored in the first paragraph.
B007D2XSW0|4.0|good app for editing. kinda wish it had more filters to choose from.but other than that its great<br />love it
B006M4RN3U|5.0|I am honestly totally in love with this album. I highly recommend it to anyone that would like good music to add to their collection :D
B000VSAEYI|5.0|This pool is great fun. It's shallow and well sized. The sprinkler feature is an added plus. Just remember to close the valve to make sure air doesn't leak out. The pool's built-in inflatable slide is a bit of a joke. It's really just for the littlest ones. Older kids (2+ will sink in rather than be able to slide). The biggest design flaw I found is that the slide is fused to the bottom of the pool. Now in its third summer, our pool got a rip at the bottom right where the slide is attached, clearly a result of using the slide. Overall I would definitely recommend this product. It's fun for the kids and hey, we got two full summers out of it. But I must say that I got it from Amazon for in the low thirties, much cheaper than it is now!
B006Z20976|5.0|A must see for all men.  This has opened my eyes further and I am ready to step up and help mentor children with out a father figure in their life.
B00881VLCE|5.0|I love putting puzzles together, could spend hours doing it.  Love the fact that you can downlowd free puzzles, &amp; can play 4 different levels.
B007V508CC|1.0|I have been a fan of Maroon 5 since the beginning and in my eyes they could do no wrong. This was the worse CD of the year. I understand wanting to change, but this was bad for them. Maybe it is time for them to take a break because they are overexposed.Maybe if Adam wasn't busy doing that singing show he could come up with a decent song cos everything on it was shit. I knew I wouldn't like the CD when I didn't really care for PayPhone or whatever it's call. It's ok without the rapper. I always love the singles and it makes me excited for the CD, but I liked nothing.<br /><br />In short, Maroon 5 take 2 years off and go back to the drawing board.
B005QI4TP8|5.0|This is a completely differant ball game then Lungs. I like where it is going. She has this Sinead O' conner and cranberries vibe going on. The songs all gave me good memories.  What the water gave me , helped me write a story. Heartlines, reminded me of African tribal music and made me dance. Number four reminded me of the first time  I saw New York. Spectrum made me think of these two glass people who fall together and become and start painting each other differant colors. I listened it while working, for hours and didn't even noticed so much time slipped away. Coworker's asked me what I lisening to, cuz I was so productive.One lady was like, this is too beautiful. She was crying real tears. The librarian did not like it all. The heavy drums and the lyrics kind of scared her. Another person thought she sounded like she was howling or sounded like she was giving birth. But to me it sounds like heaven, especially with all the choir and harp music.
B002MQYOFW|3.0|Quick read.  Fairly entertaining.  Classic formula.  Very Gone with the Windesque with survival being key and the main character fighting to deny herself in the name of strength and stability.  Similar in content to Wind but Collins's writing pales in comparison to that of Margaret Mitchell.  The political setting is similar to that of modern day Corporate America, live dying or be eaten.  Nothing unique or unparalleled in this story.
B00723NWJE|4.0|I listened to this while working on a very humid day.Her voice took me away from all that to this mod looking 60's kitchen with air conditioning. She channels Eartha Kitt and Suzanne Vega with that breathy sensual voice. All of the songs have interesting beginnings. Like one opening sounds as if they are marakas playing against the jazz. Quite a few had the beat of an old Dave Clark five or Nancy Sinatra mixed in. Happy pills literally sounds like the instruments and Norah are saying nah nah nah nah nah, I'm gonna getcha. Miriam is so haunting and creepy, but the way she executes it makes you want to cry. The writing of the songs is sharp. Like one line is She's 22, does she make you happy, I want you happy. And my ultimate fav you don't have to tell the truth ,because if you do. I will tell it too. I like when music gets in between your bones like this.
0440246016|4.0|Bad Luck and Trouble is one of a series of thrillers starring the heroic loner, Reacher. I have never read anything by Lee Child before and only came across this as it was part of a compilation of 4 novels in a free book I received via a book club as part of the introductory offer. Sometimes, such gifts prove more serendipitous than expected. This was one such occasion.<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed the story and found it difficult to put down. I've never lived in the USA, have no experience of the US military, don't gamble in casinos, and I live a happily married life with a wonderful wife and daughter. So, on the face of it, I have no points of contact with the protagonist. But Child has a way of making his hero into a well-rounded human, almost in spite of his rough tough exterior. This isn't the formulaic easiness of the soft-centred giant. Reacher is considerably more complex. He's a man with principles and, although he can act with necessary brutality and kill in ways that seem almost casual, beneath this toughness lies a moral mind and heart that takes a no-nonsense approach to the realities of life. He is an honest hero, honest even with himself most of the time, an unusual human trait.<br /><br />I won't attempt to give a synopsis of the novel, though the plot could be outlined in a page. The whole point of a thriller is the way the plot takes the reader through the various barriers to success, or failure, and pits the hero against odds most would find impossible. It's a piece of fun escapism. But, in common with many of the better written thrillers, this one has an underlying theme of morality, a concern with right and wrong. Child avoids those excesses so prevalent in the genre; the easy solutions to complex problems, the ready subjugation of moral considerations in the name of expediency or plot development. He eschews such lazy routes to denouement and instead employs real dilemmas and proper human concerns in resolving the issues raised by the story.<br /><br />His characters, the protagonists, are well drawn and we know enough about them to understand their motives and actions. The villains could be seen as a little stereotypical, a little lacking in depth of development. But, hell, we're reading this to root for the good guys, aren't we? So bad villains are acceptable. I don't read thrillers for detailed explanation of character; like most readers, I pick up a thriller to be entertained, to be taken on a wild ride of escapism. And Child delivers.<br /><br />Would I recommend the book? Without doubt. And I'll be reading more of this author's work, once I've read the 180 titles in my `to read' list!<br /><br />His characters, the protagonists, are well drawn and we know enough about them to understand their motives and actions.

0345803485|3.0|I don't see what's so great about *50 Shades of Grey (Don't everyone throw stones at me all at once; It's just my personal opinion).<br />  For one, it seemed like the story took forever to really take off.  The sex scenes launch pretty quick, but as far as an real substance, it's seriously lacking.<br />  Next, the author seemed very grammatically confused.  On one hand, she seemed anxious to whip out her thesaurus and employ words that I've never heard anyone use before.  But then she also made a bad habit out of over-utilize simple words like \\"murmur\\" or \\"my sex\\" (apparently she couldn't think of any other words for the female anatomy)<br />  So all-in-all, it just didn't do it for me.  Yeah, the sex scenes were steamy.  Other than that, it's nothing more than the typical virgin-meets-bad-boy love story.<br />  *However, I did find 50 Shades Darker more enjoyable, and so far, 50 Shades Freed is pretty interesting (I'm halfway through).
B005LAIGNC|4.0|I had heard quite a bit about this film before it hit the theaters and really wanted to see it, as fate would have it the run was short and didn't get there but blue ray, hd tv and surround sound was almost as good. Very good portrayal of this group of flying heroes.
B003L77G10|5.0|The second season of The Good Wife was excellent! Enjoyed every episode . Especially Eli. Great actor. Can't wait to purchase season three.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love the Bible app. there are so many reading plans to choose from. There are different translations and even reminders to stay reading. I think this is a great app to keep you in the Word even when you are on the go. I would recommend it to anyone and I am more than glad I gave it a chance. This app has so much to offer, and then some.
B004T2QZL8|4.0|Doodle God is a very hard but fun game. Creating new things for the earth can be tough. Even though it is called Doodle God it doesn't have much to do with drawing. I really injoy this game. If you don't have it I recommend it to you.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I luv this game! I go to bed with my Kindle Fire and the Angry Birds every night.  This is the funest free thing I have done in a long time. The ads are so small I don't even notice them. This game is never boring. It is funny and challenging.  So much so that I got Seasons and Rio  so there is plenty of different themes to keep my interest. I havn't decided if I like the monkeys yet. But I like the concept so far.  Once again I LUV ANGRY BIRDS FREE! I WOULD RE COMEND IT TO ANYONE TO TRY FOR FREE. Play for awhile then decide if you want to pay for ad free or the other games.,
B006H8BIIM|1.0|Let me be clear that I have not played this game...and the reason is that there is no way that I am gonna pay for an app then have to pay some more to progress the levels. This habit of IAP are doing nothing but hurting this industry. Would you buy a pair of jeans then pay everytime you wore them? The idea would be ridiculous.<br /><br />This pay then pay again format these devs are doing is LAUGHABLE.
B007N0AEWY|4.0|I first heard \\"Say I wanna know\\" on an Acura commercial.  Shazaamed it and immediately bought the album on Amazon.  It has been in heavy rotation and has been powering my summer evenings.  I mix this with Raphael Saadiq, some drinks, and it's on.  Listen and enjoy.
B001AQO3QA|3.0|I was really excited to order the Alien Anthology on blu ray, since I already own the same anthology on DVD. I was expecting it to surpass the video and audio quality compared to the DVD set. However, I see nothing exceptional about the blu ray version. I am glad I have it on blu ray, but it just feels like to me that little effort was put into taking advantage of blu ray technology, other than an update to the menu. A little disappointed, but I still love the anthology.
B007D2XSW0|5.0|It has a me me set up. awesomeness :) and i needed an blemish effect too! I couldn't ask for more.. Or could I lol
B0045I3EJC|5.0|I'm adding this to my top 10 favorite movies list. Mr. Nobody is one of those rare films that sticks with you for day's to come after watching. The performances were very good and it was visually beautiful but the story and ideas presented are what really got me. A truly original concept that leaves you thinking. Other movies I would put in this category worth checking out are; youth without youth, and the man from earth.
B004T2QZL8|5.0|I love playing this app with my friends, but the forceclose was a big ruined. its tons of fun. however after you make a certain number of elements, it closes.
B007UQ5Z1G|4.0|The guys are back to form.  I felt Minutes to Midnight only had a few worthy tracks and I traded Thousand Sons away it was so awful.<br />This is a return to form with evolution.  Showing their maturity and complexity.  Definitely one to keep in the catalog.
B007M45PMU|5.0|I love pleasant surprises and this album falls solidly in the category of solid surprises. I've enjoyed this album from first track to last.
B006H8BIIM|1.0|I see exactly what the others are talking about... pay for the game and then it is impractical to go very far without spending more. I'm sick of this double pricing model.  I'm sick of games that can end up costing far more than a quality desktop game over the long run.
B0085776BG|4.0|Action packed traditional film with romance,tragedy, aspirt de corps and a very well presented time line of people, places, and events. A  true story with plenty of footage of Mustags and bomber groups in acrion over Germany. Red Tail is a move worth watching.
030758836X|5.0|I woke up early, stayed up late, and snuck off to corners during the day to read a few more pages. Yes, it's good, and a perfect thriller to mow through on a summer's day, and think about for days after.<br /><br />Amy and Nick, a couple young rising New Yorkers, relocate to the Midwest, pulled by family duty and pushed along from the city when they both lose their jobs. Amy goes missing, and mounting evidence suggests Nick was involved. Without giving away too  away, you've got two very unreliable narrators here, and, to me, a couple pretty unlikable characters. Nick's nature and possible secrets come in pieces, and Amy's diary stands in for her side of the story. Add in a trust fund, an affair, and an admirer/stalker from the past, and you've got an ideal modern mystery.<br /><br />Here's what else you get: a slow reveal, a couple switcheroos, and a serves-you-right ending, all told with quick, smart, culturally aware writing that is absolute fun to read.  This book brought to mind the film *Fatal Attraction* from back in the late '80s. Besides being hugely entertaining, that movie served as a cautionary tale for cheating husbands across the country. While before they might have been afraid of being found out; after that movie they were just plain afraid. This book has a similar sense of menace. It might serve as a warning to naughty husbands and wives with roving eyes, especially if it gets made into a movie (fingers crossed).
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Good game for killing time or just to check every once in a while. Really easy controls. Works fluently on kindle fire with no long load times.
0060855924|4.0|Im pretty excited at the notion of 30- some odd series circulating around Discworld. Fun & entertaining fantasy world with lots of twists and cOmedy.
B0063IH60K|5.0|No need to drag the cards - tap them and they will move!  Liked it so much on my phone I added to my Kindle Fire.
0061692042|5.0|Mr. Ford seems to have graduated from the travails of Frank Bascombe, the hopeful protagonist in the his Pulitzer Prize winning \\"Independence Day\\" and moved deeper among the puzzles of \\"everyman's\\" journey through life. \\"Canada\\" is, without argument, one of the most spellbinding reads on the shelf - adventure, introspection and subtle advice laid unceremoniously on the table for us to look over, a feast from his author-eye that embodies our existence in its raw, unadorned, and often ragged, unpredictable goings-on.<br /><br />His view, first through that of a youngish but observing boy of fifteen, in odd but believable surrounds, who escapes one erratic situation to find himself immediately in quite another; and then as a seasoned, settled man and teacher attempting the adventure's meaning for his class and then ultimately for himself.<br /><br />The characters are fascinating: their utterances and actions, their deeply carved lives, their apparent ends; and what to make of them all will cause you no end of contemplation about your own. Once entering this world, I could not exit until hours after turning the last page.<br /><br />The \\"boys\\" who decide the big prize must be wondering now if they acted too hastely, or perhaps if it's passable to award yet another to Richard Ford so soon - one of the top yarn-spinners of our day. Congratulations to him, I am certain, from any of us who open this book.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game so much its so addicting plus I think u should play this its so fun wow
B007D2XSW0|5.0|PicShop was helpful for my Kindle Fire! My favorite thing is that you can save the quality and change what colors you want to &quot;pop&quot;. You can add cute stickers and frames to your picture and crop out whatever you don't want.
B006H8BIIM|1.0|Greedy greedy greedy dev with the in app purchases. Completely uncalled for. Not gonna happen. Really hope they read the reviews and get the point.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love it if you like solitaire I think you can pay for a better version with more game types<br /><br />Jade out
B0062NAX1U|5.0|I plan to give this to all my family members as a present. I have never seen my husband cry at any movie, except this one. It's such a touching and moving story. With  great family lessons to be learned. Yes, it has strong Christian over tones, something I won't get into, but, I love this movie!!! I need see \\"Fire Proof\\", the 1st. in this series.<br />You will not be disappointed in this movie.
B007T2XC7A|5.0|I love this album.  When Amazon recommends \\"Albums like ...Little Broken Hearts,\\" I get slightly offended because there are no albums like this one.  Songs like 'Miriam' so a darker side of the Danger Mouse/Norah Jones duo.  Unlike most audio productions, listening to this album sounds more personal;  it's like being invited into a private session deep within the mellow, dark portions of the artists' work.<br /><br />--Dedrick
085786078X|5.0|Of the 4 Simon's Cat books I bought, this is my favorite.  For those of you who share space with, and pay attention to, the antics of cats/kittens, this book really hits the nail on the head!  I giggled all the way through the book as I thought about how it had looked and how I had enjoyed watching when MY cats did the same things.  Simon doesn't use any dialog but none is needed--his pictures do a great job of telling the stories!
B0086213XW|5.0|A young woman must make a choice between her loving husband and her New flame. This intriguing movie portrays the 'power of love' and what can happen if you lose it. There are funny moments, serious moments, and thought-provoking moments. Acting Performance Excellent and the story grabs your attention in the beginning. A powerfully moving drama, enjoyable from start to finish. Highly Recommended!
0307592731|4.0|This is not a typical kind of book I read.  I picked it up because of all the positive reviews.  I enjoyed it.  It isn't earth shattering, but it held my interest and I was moved and proud of her journey.  Her poor feet!  Take a look!
B006H8BIIM|1.0|If you have to keep buying upgrades,then why is this free. sorry....I will pass. NO IN APP PURCHASES WITH FREE APPS THRU HERE.
B004QL7K6Q|1.0|Raunchy, vulgar, disgusting, and not all that funny. I like Jennifer Aniston (usually), but this one was not so great.
B007SGM084|2.0|This series was a let down. Its main draw is that it is a very quick read - I was able to read the entire series in a couple days. Of course, it might have been a quick read for me because I skipped quite a bit of the sex scenes. I really don't need that many details about characters sex lives, even if they are tying each other up and using crops, clips, and canes.<br /><br />I can boil my main concerns down to three points:<br /><br />1. There is very little in the way of action in this series until the last book. The main movement is through dialog and narrative angst. It's relatively decent dialog, but I like it when there's also action to back it up. Of course, there's lots of sex to back everything up. Honestly though, if I wanted to read that many sex scenes, I'd shop the erotic department. There are chapters in this book that read more like a how-to-guide on sub/dom relationships then like an actual story. It's overly graphic and excessive in its detail. On the other hand, I suppose if the majority of your book is sex, you really don't need to worry too much about a decent plot.<br /><br />2. When I open a book I expect that the main character is going to change in some way between the first page and last. Ana never does, she is young, weak, and immature through the whole series. Even in the last book when she actually takes action, it's because she thinks she is better equipped to handle a situation simply because she has fired a weapon before. This evidently makes her an expert in dealing with all potentially violent situations, more so than trained guards with military experience. I personally see nothing about Ana that would draw someone like Christian. She cries nonstop, never listens to logical suggestions, and doesn't trust the man she \\"loves\\" to help her with anything. Christian is the only character that changes in this book and we don't get to really appreciate it because we spend all of our time in Ana's head.<br /><br />3. And speaking of Christian, he is way too mercurial. I know that's suppose to be one of his defining characteristics but honestly, unless I know his thought process for why he's going from seriously menacing one moment to cheerful and playful another, I tend to get irritated and kind of disturbed. I keep thinking that he's got serious mental issues and is bipolar or something even worse. I've known people like that and it's not endearing, it's scary. I want to check him into a psych ward and get him on some mood stabilizing drugs.
B005LAIGP0|1.0|Daniel Radcliffe is struggling to act in this movie. It is not scary, the plot is lame, and the ending is just dumb. Phltttt.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|I don't usually read Stephen King since he scares me! But this book wasn't his typical horror read.  I enjoyed it since it made you think \\"what if?\\"....I would recommend it highly. The time travel plot was fascinating....he did a great job researching how it was back in the 50's (when I was growing up) Do more like this one Stephen!
B007L96SI6|5.0|To be honest, I wasn't quite sure what to think about the album the first time I listened to it.  Didn't particularly like all the back up singers on various tracks but then again, the contrast and diversity of the album was good.  Now that we've played it a few times, it is out of this world fantastic.  All are solid songs - #5 will make you cry if you listen to it fairly loud, #8 and #9 are exceptional. There's talent there for sure.  Here's hoping Haley has a very long and successful career so we can enjoy more of her great music.  : )
B00013F35I|5.0|i have them all.  this far surpasses of any.  absosutely the best that the boss has ever let me view. oh, and Patty just gets better with age. I honestly dont know how many times I have bought this, and loaned it.  Then bought it again.
B006R8GK2Q|5.0|Great game, lots of different levels to go through, well worth the money! Had lots of fun playing with my 10 year old.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|really addicting game its pretty good so far I thought it would be boring or too cheesy of a game but it actually isn't it serves its purpose and not only do I enjoy it but my five year old son enjoys this game as well.
B007V2UGPE|4.0|its a great way to kill time or for a long car or plane trip or just to play around the house<br />.
B006H8BIIM|1.0|Another game that makes you pay real money just to beat it. You think that'd be rolled into the cost of the game.
B000E1ZBGS|4.0|This nineteenth century setting by author Jane Austen stands as a memorable love story for the ages. Keira Knightley and Rosamund Pike (sisters of the English Bennet family) find their lives intertwining with the men they will marry.<br /><br />The Bennet parents (Donald Sutherland and Brenda Blethyn) struggle to find the right suitors for their five daughters, as the girls discover the ups and downs of the right engagements.<br /><br />Without the reading of the book, I cannot compare but loved the movie and recommend it.
B005PMNBNG|5.0|Finally a group with real meaning behind its lyrics. Great tracks, vocals and they're even better live. Forget the rest buy the best, M83 is here to stay.
B007V508CC|5.0|Just got the cd today and have listened to it a bunch of times already. Absolutely love this cd!! Standout tracks are One More Night, Lady Killer, Tickets, Doin' Dirt and Wipe Your Eyes (bonus track). The only song I don't really like is Fortune Teller. Fans that loved the \\"Hands All Over\\" cd will love this one as well. $13.99 well spent! =)
034580404X|5.0|I really enjoyed this trilogy. I lost quite a bit of sleep finishing up the books. It is a fun, and furious ride. They are sexy, if not a bit smutty but the story and the characters leave me wanting for more.
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is a fun enjoyable app. I recommend it to everyone. I am positive all ages will enjoy it if not fall in love with it.
0545265355|5.0|This trilogy is a must read for everyone. It is a violent and gripping tale of a girl and her family. The Hunger Games books were refreshing and new with the love story as a secondary or even tertiary role.  It has very nail-biting action with cliff hangers at the end of each book, which prompted me to read each book in one days time.  I could not bear to put them down until I finished the entire story.
B004MC8CA2|1.0|this shouldn't be an app if u have to make it free for people to get it why should they get it its just a book a greedy king twisted to make his people scared
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. It took me about 3 days to complete it. I couldn't put it town. Some parts were a little too detailed for me but I liked the overall book. (Now on to the second book)
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|This book is so touching, you can feel emotion pouring out of its pages.<br />I laughed and cried and it felt so real, like I was watching it for real, in real life.<br />I really recomend this book it has every quality in every genre. love, death, hope. It amazes me that a man in his thirties can describe, and create a sixteen-year-old, so well.<br />Please read.
B006H8BIIM|1.0|good try buy in app purchases kill it... If u.need.more.detail. read others reviews.below. no point of downloading sucha a game
B0086213XW|4.0|There may be spoilers!<br /><br />An accomplished actress, Sarah Polley steps behind the camera for only the second time, 6 years removed from the critically acclaimed but little seen, \\"Away from Her.\\"  Returning to her hometown of Toronto, Polley assembles an interesting cast including Seth Rogen and Sarah Silverman as brother and sister in dramatic roles.  The reason to see this movie however is another remarkable performance by Michelle Williams as Margot, Lou's (Rogen) stay at home wife.<br /><br />He's working on a new cookbook entitled, \\"It Taste Like Chicken,\\" and is constantly trying out new recipes.  Lou and Margo love each other and tell each other all the time.  But Margo is bored.  Lou isn't.  Margo wants kids.  Lou wants a dog.  They have sex, but it's pretty straight forward and at Lou's discretion.  You get the picture.  Margo, returning from a brief trip to Nova Scotia, meets Daniel (Luke Kirby) and a little playful flirtation allows them to share a cab home from the airport.  Coincidently, he just moved in across the street.  Neither is interested in an adulterous affair but they start hanging out so we all know where this is going.<br /><br />She falls hard and so does he, but he does the honorable thing and moves.  Nothing much new here but Polley, who also wrote the screenplay, doesn't pull any punches, either with the dialog or with the complications of a fading marriage.  Unfortunately Polley fumbles the ending.  After Margo finds Daniel, their relationship takes a full-on physical and sexually experimental phase.  This includes 3-ways (both options), all of which is pulled off on-screen, albeit briefly.  This brilliant sequence is filmed in a stylistic 360 degree camera sweep over a long period to the baritone voice of Leonard Cohen singing his \\"Take This Waltz.\\"  The scene ends with Margo snuggling up to Daniel from behind just like she did with Lou.  And like Lou, he shrugs her off.  A brilliant ending I thought.<br /><br />But, the movie goes on when Margo is called back to Lou's house.  This needless finale appears to have been shot just to give Sarah Silverman and extended dramatic scene.  In spite of this hiccup, the film has a mature, passionate resonance and is certainly worth seeking out.es on when Margo is called back to Lou's house.

B0073LWEXK|1.0|this game makes no scence and is boring I'm not gonna give away answers so u sick lost city or stupid city
B006H8BIIM|1.0|First off, the game is impossible to win without purchasing in app content, or grinding away a full day I'd you're life. permissions are excessive, and open feint ruins many great games. if i were a developer, i would create two versions of an app, one with feint, and one without.<br /><br />Overall decent game ruined by greed and bad permission requirements.<br /><br />This is my very first review of an app ever, that should speak volumes about how I feel about this.
B006H8BIIM|3.0|UPDATED 8/30/12: I hear OF has been removed.  I think that is enough for me to give this game another chance.  Still, I upped my rating from two to three stars for this fact alone.  I'll follow with another update.<br /><br />ORIGINAL 7/1/12 (2 stars): And when perpetrated by the same party, it's just exponentially more wrong. the game is a great idea and I'm sure I'd Love to play, at least at first. but in what world does it seem reasonable to pay to access then continue to pay just to be able to progress? if I pay for a game it needs to be well worth it and I don't wanna have to keep paying for it. how is that even fair?<br />then to top it all off is OpenFeint which I personally don't want on my phone. I really like some of the games that use it too, so it's really a shame. ultimately there's just too much wrong to be right for me. uninstalled.
B005LAIIRQ|5.0|This is a good movie. I was expecting a scary movie. Instead, it was a very deep movie. Liam Neeson is a great actor!
B00006LWSF|3.0|Way to introduce 50 to the general public and continue to showcase your lyrical ability with Em's songs paralleling the movie...as for the others...
B007YOC4RW|5.0|Really, really like this one. Gotta say this is the best up-tempo blues purchase I've made in years. I'm a self taught guitar player and have played and studied blues rock for decades. Recently began looking for good examples of dominant 7th blues licks. This means blues with a major, more positive sound rather than the typical minor 7th sound. Well, this is it... I'm hooked. Though other important artists may play tracks with this dom7 style, none master it as Bonamassa does. The enery here is beyond just blues, and clearly into what we used to call 'hard rock'. Oh, and he can sing, too. ;) Technically awesome.
B005D9MUWY|4.0|swift key 3 is still the best predictive keyboard. new version makes getting to the ?  harder.  Still wish numbers on the numeric keyboard were larger.  Room for improvement, but still the best.
B0077ATSSQ|5.0|I purchased this item on amazon.  Great movie!  As a responder to 9/11 I am still looking for my own understanding of \\"the worst day\\".  As for Frank's Great Deals...they were fast in shipping and anxious to make sure I was pleased with my purchase...I am. I experienced a minor problem with the digital download and this seller offered a replacement product with no need for me to send back the original...I am very pleased.
B000W94FIW|5.0|This is a classic Coelho story that is very insightful and inspirational.<br />If you apply it to yourself you will gain some insight about love and how we all react to love based on our own upbringing.
B007ELN8Y8|5.0|This film is a beautiful homage to a bygone era of films and filmmaking.  Without going so far overboard that it becomes pretentious, this film hits all the right marks.  It's worthy of all the awards it has received!  Beautiful casting!

B007J4T2G8|3.0|This first book in the series is enough for me and I won't buy the others. I see this as an adolescent romance with the main focus on how to become sexually astute and learn about the connection of being submissive (and let your boy friend decide for you in all ways possible) and winning him over so he will love you. The message overall is not a good one in my view and I would prefer to see a more realistic view of s&m instead of mixing it up with love. But, as we as women, or should I qualify that to \\"a lot of women\\" tend to mix up love with sex and are still yearning for the knight in shining armor who will save us from ourselves and gives us everything we want, this book gives us what we want, or think we want.<br />If it reignited the sex lives of many stale marriages, it at least fulfills some purpose and can't be all bad.<br />I already knew that the north Americans do not like sex that much, or feel guilty about having it,  or have been less than forthright about their sex lives with others, or might be stuck in the prudish fundamentalist  attitudes and do it with the light off once a week if you're lucky. If this books opens opportunities for a healthier sex life, all the more power to it.<br />On a literary point of view, not well written, too many repeats of lip biting and murmuring and all of that nonsense, and really, the focus is very, very narrow and resembles the musings of a 16 year old, not so much those of an adult with a literary degree as the protagonist, Ana, is supposed to be. Should be a read for 15 to 19 year olds.
B00846REIS|2.0|For me, compared to Fifty Shade of Gray, this book just doesn't cut it.  Sure maybe the writing was more grammatically correct and sophisticated but the story was very less appealing.
0425263908|5.0|I haven't read for many years. Someone at work recommended Fifty Shades of Grey...and I loved it!!!!  I normally read mysteries with some romance thrown in.  Bared to Me is a love story with a little mystery thrown in about the characters.  You ride the ups and downs of Eva and Gideons lives together and apart!  When I started reading it, I didn't know that the sequel doesn't come out until Oct and December.  I can hardly wait to see what happens next!!!!!  This book and Fifty make you care about the characters and I found myself smiling and anxious during parts of the story!  I've already read it twice.  It is an easy read!
B006H8BIIM|5.0|It only costs 99 cents to get a fully upgraded station with all blueprints! HOW IS THAT A BAD DEAL? Today is free app of the day so regularly you have to pay 2 dollars with the original price of $1.25. Tell me where the greed is and I'll gladly edit this review.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Although this book caught my attention from the first chapter, and held it throughout, until the end, I cannot rate it more than 3 stars.  The ending seemed dashed off and was very unsatisfying after being intriguing and well-written until that point.  What a disappointment after tearing happily through the book anticipating and wondering what could possibly happen next.
B007UXSPK2|4.0|This was the right mix of action and humor for our movie night. My husband and I enjoyed watching it.
B000IBEN1I|5.0|No idea what the other reviewer had been watching. This series is great and if you look at individual episodes they all get great reviews!!
B007V5CF5K|5.0|this puzzle game is the best ive eva played. eva!!!!!!!!it challenged me even when I played it with the smartest friend eva shes ma bestie!!!!!
B00846TRHY|5.0|This guy that this movie is about spoke at our church. It's a true story and he appears just as tough (and kind hearted) in person as he does in the movie, and he does really have a heart for the kids that he's trying to help. The truuthfulness of the story on the screen rings true to the personality we heard speak at our church.
B006H8BIIM|1.0|unfortunately, this app gets ruined by the in app purchase trick. it makes a upgrades  way too expensive  and time consuming  in order to trick you into buying credits instead of wasting time buying them.
B0079J28NC|5.0|Wonderful to see this re-vamped movie once again and relive the moment. The colors are bright and the movie just jumps off the screen, great to hear the music and watch the blue meanies!

B0076NAWWA|5.0|excellent album, the highly effective mixture of sounds and voice artists and high-level,to buy and listen, it helps the imagination
B007P6VLRS|1.0|I have one moderately nice thing to say about this record.  See the \\"Quasar\\" note.  Otherwise it's gonna get rough so read on at your peril.  You've been forewarned!<br /><br />Instead of \\"Oceania\\" this record should be titled \\"Bill Corgan's pathetic wimp and whine egofest 2012.\\"  Well, OK -- if you're tiring of Justin Bieber because you just recently went through puberty and want something that you think will pad your pop culture ego as a little \\"edgier\\" or even (gasp) \\"retro,\\" by all means waste your money on this record (newsflash: it won't work) .  Oceania is yet another irrelevant, straight-out-of-the-pop-vending-machine formulaic piece of crap, but plenty of people will buy it anyway -- which is the only reason I can think of for why Bill released this record.  I mean, he can't possibly need the money, so why tarnish his name and his legacy with this stinky unemptied colon of a project?  It would be much more appropriate if it just came free with a happy meal -- but I'd still rather have a cheap plastic Spiderman toy that broke the first time I took it out of the box.<br /><br />To be a little more specific, you can just *tell* where the songs are going to go -- and despite how much you don't want the train to wreck it's inevitable.  I mean, you can just hear the stupid, standard sappy guitar solo around the corner and then BAM -- it happens.  You can anticipate the stupid keyboard and bass hooks (coupled with emo strings) coming up and then, just like turds in a litterbox, they appear (see The Celestials, 1:16 in).  Similarly, you start to think, \\"huh, I haven't heard Bill whine for awhile,\\" and then, just like garbage on the beach, it rolls in predictably.  And man, what boring, standard drum work -- constant highhat/ride cymbals and hackneyed tom rolls pretty well covers it.  I've said it before and I'll say it again:  THIS is what passes for \\"creativity\\"?  Don't be fooled!  You don't have to accept anything that's meant for Applebee's background music, or as a soundtrack to a movie that no one wants to see.  There actually IS good music out there, but you've got to wade through so much cookie-cutter nonsense that sometimes you lose hope.<br /><br />Some even more specific notes:<br /><br />Quasar:  I didn't have high expectations for this record.  But between 0:20 and 0:58 the song actually, ahem, kind of rocks!  I like the guitar work in that 38 seconds, and I thought I might be pleasantly surprised by the whole record [end the one nice thing].  That's when the whole record collapses.  The bellwether of the descent into the toilet?  The mantra at 0:59 in, whatever it means.  I don't care, I just know that mantras and rock songs DON'T MIX!  You don't need to add anything to your resume of pretentious douchebaggery, Bill -- it's stuffed to the gills.  And 38 seconds of decent rock isn't worth the price of this turkey.<br /><br />The Celestials:  \\"I will be special k.\\"  That's a real lyric in this song -- look it up in the liner notes.  A question, Bill:  you don't want to be a better cereal?  I mean, you're so rich, you could sit around in a kiddie pool full of any cereal you want for the rest of your life, stuffing face and watching TV nonstop!  Might I suggest Lucky Charms, Fruity Pebbles, or even Frosted Cheerios at least?  I get it -- you're getting older and needed the extra fibre in Special K to address your creative constipation.  But don't forget -- despite what you think, not everyone likes the smell of your musical farts.<br /><br />Violet Rays:  stupid keyboards introduce even stupider guitar.<br /><br />My Love Is Winter:  Another predictable melody underneath boring, tired lyrics.  1:14 in cue the stupid keyboards.  Did he hire a toddler to write songs or something?  Can't you just see, say, Barney dancing with the letter \\"A\\" 1:14 in?  Did Bill write the soundtrack to a forthcoming Barney epic masterpiece?<br /><br />One Diamond One Heart:  more stupid keyboards!  Did he use a preset pattern set to charmsichord?  Wimpy, predictable, boring drums.  LOVE the electronic pan flute, Bill.<br /><br />Pinwheels:  wait, am I playing a video game?  Wait, 0:38 in -- am I listening to a bastardized ripoff of Spacemen 3?<br /><br />Oceania:  6:38 in, perfect example of crappy, standard, wuss guitar.  8:20 in another terrible solo.  the only way to close a song this bad is to fade out.  and guess what?<br /><br />Pale Horse:  the pop music machine suggested picking one word and repeating it over and over like a moron.  Bill obliged.  LOVE the melody, too:  dee dee dee dee dee dee, dee dee dee dee dee dee ... dee dee ... dee dee.  In case you're pining for another song structured around repeating one word in a failed attempt to be deep, don't worry -- you only have to wait until Wildflower.<br /><br />The Chimera:  \\"if I'm wrong I'm right.\\"  WOAH, deep!  I gotta catch my breath, my mind is blowing!!!<br /><br />Glissandra:  more stupid guitar work right from the start, followed by another video game keyboard twiddle and the awesomely outrageous lyric \\"la-la-la-la-la.\\"  I guess four la's wasn't enough, but 6 was too many.  Genius.<br /><br />Inkless:  1:27 in, perfect example of a trite and idiotic guitar solo.  What software came up with that one, Bill?  The refrain:  \\"The stars are out tonight.\\"  It's more like Bill's mooning us, but we can't tell if we're staring at his rear or his head.  That pretty well sums up this album for me.<br /><br />Wildflower:  the last song on the record is a *real* gem.  In case you didn't get enough of Bill's nasal complaining, cue the wimpy whining Bill Corgatron-5000, masquerading as artistic!  3:25, splice in the stupid guitar solo!  And what an ending!  Did Bill just get tired, uninspired and say, \\"screw it -- let's just repeat the word 'wildflower' over and over.  People will eat it up and think it's deep and musical.  Let's pinch this loaf off once and for all and serve it up for all to smell!\\"  Cause that's what happens.  What I wonder is this:  how did Bill decide on 9 times to repeat the word?  Why not 8, why not 10?  Oh no, 8 wouldn't be enough -- we need at *least* one more \\"wildflower\\" to drive it home!  I GET IT BILL, WILDFLOWER.  Now gimme my $9 back!<br /><br />Honestly *this* is the best Bill can do in 5 years?!  If I puked in a guitar and sent it to the monkey house for 5 years I'd get a better album.  Disappointing and embarrassing, Bill.ichord?  Wimpy, predictable, boring drums.  LOVE the electronic pan flute, Bill.<br /><br />Pinwheels:  wait, am I playing a video game?

B007IXWKUK|4.0|I enjoyed reading part 2 of this series almost as much as the third and final book.  3rd book was best for me. Tied up all the questions I had into the psyche of the subject matter.  At least in this characters case.  Made it all seem more normal than abnormal.  Well written for a romance novel.  Read it in 2-3 days, so easy a read, intense in parts.
0345803485|2.0|Save your money and get this at the library. I was expecting to like this book, because of all the media hype; however, it was quite unbelievable and silly. A 22 year old college student near the top of her class and she doesn't own a laptop or have an email address? She's never had a crush, boyfriend or even a sexual attraction to any male? She wears little to no makeup and considers herself plain, yet the 26 year old billionaire (really?) handsome bachelor falls for her at first sight? And does anyone these days reach 22 without having had sex? Christian claims he is not a hearts and flowers guy, yet he showers her with expensive gifts, drops everything to run to her side after any puzzling email she sends, cuddles in bed to sleep, sends her champagne, flies to her side to meet her mother, emails and texts her constantly, and pampers her left and right. Isn't that hearts and flowers - taking care of her and her feelings?? Then there's the ubiquitous use of various phrases - biting her lip (now why does that give him an erection?), blushing, flushing, geez, oh my, peeking out from under her lashes, laters baby (dumb phrase), rolling eyes, the inner goddess. Then all the control he wants over her, plus wanting to punish her which gives him pleasure, fisting, binding and gagging... gads. Seems like a messed up guy. I don't understand why some women liked this book so much.
B006H8BIIM|1.0|The game requires you to spend real money just to advance.  Only suckers would fall for this all too common deceitful ploy.<br />Remember their Name - Origin8 Technologies - NEVER Support their Products!!! They are just taking advantage of their customers.

B0062GM6FS|1.0|I was always a big fan of the Rolling Stones and their music.  The first album I ever bought was Sticky Fingers followed by Goat's Head Soup.  I had a chance to see them in July of 1978 in which they only played for about an hour.  After reading Life, I was disappointed by its content.  The title should have been, \\"My Life on Drugs with The Rolling Stones.\\"  If you enjoy reading books about drugs, rock and roll, and living excessively, you will probably like this book.  Yeah, I get it.  I know Keith loved to party and enjoyed using lots of drugs.  However, this book spent too much time with redundant episodes of of drug-fueled parties and soul searching about drugs.  Life could have been a great read if Keith dealt more with the relationships of the other band members and not always about Mick although I know he was closer to him than the rest of the band.  Keith could have given the reader a more insightful journey about what it was like on tours and the period of the 1980s to the present but seemed to not write much about that time frame.  The book was poorly written, incoherent, and bordering grammatically close to being a train wreck which probably is more of a reflection on Keith's lack of a formal education.<br />  The Rolling Stones wrote some great music up through the Some Girls album.  Unfortunately, they lost their way unless you were a preteen going through puberty.  Their music from the 1980s on had more of a pop theme and feel which I realize is what sells and pays the bills.  Keith would say that it was never about the money but about making music.  If that were true, why would they release 4 albums that were nothing more than their greatest hits and release music that was received mostly by the top 40.<br />  You will find some humor in this book especially when Keith embellishes many of his encounters with characters who cross his path in which he has a problem with or whom he disagrees with.  He leads the reader to believe that his skills as a fighter with knives, guns, and muscle have put him in the ranks of the SAS (Speical Air Service).  Also, Keith would say something like: \\"I could never understand why all these beautiful women always wanted to be with me.\\"  Hmmmm...I'm sure it had nothing to do with a little fame and money.  Maybe its the charming British dental work that melted their hearts.  At the end of the book, I came to the conclusion that it was just Keith's imagination running away with him.
B007N8RULO|5.0|this game is amazing. I play it all day, every day. I would pay for this if I had to.
B003IY48PS|5.0|This movie set the standards for B movies of the genre Horror.Not only does it introduce us to Sam Raimi,but also Bruce Campbell,a very under appreciated actor.I will be the first to admit he isn't the best actor,but he brings something that a lot better actors fail to bring,charisma.This movie is funny and brings a new standard for B movies in special effects,I'm not going to bore you anymore,if you like Horror Movies,you will like this movie.And if you don't,I would say you don't like Horror movies(or one of those people who nitpick a movie).This is a must for serious collectors of horror movie fans.Now the Blue Ray VS Regular DVD,Blue Ray takes away from the effects some,but if your use to this from Blue Ray,then the blood looking like red paint won't bother you.It's the only thing bad about Blue Ray and older movies,the Directors didn't know that film would be seen in such crispness,you have to remember that VHS was basically new,and when this came out Beta was still around(barely).But this movie belongs in any list of the top 25 best Horror movies of all time.

B007Y36K46|4.0|I found John Carter hard to like at first because of his attitude of just wanting his cave of gold back on Earth. His stubbornness to help for the first half was just not likable, although I realize it was due to losing his wife and child. The movie did not emphasise this problem enough in the beginning to let me sympathize (until much later when more details were brought out about the loss) Then there was the continual beatings he took that were on the ridiculous side. Most of them because he was so stubborn. Also the situation between the different groups on Mars were confusing at first.<br /><br />When Carter finally came around and wanted to help by the second half, I started to like him. The movie got better the longer it went on. The ending was especially good. It was nice to see him transform into someone who cared about others. I enjoyed the special effects and the airships. I would watch the sequel if they make one. I'm giving this movie 3.5 Stars.

Whilst the charactors are college students (and I'm a grown woman) I found the book hard to put down. It made me laugh, it made me angry (Abby was just so self centred some times that it was to the point of annoying!!!), it made me cry (something that Shades didn't) and it made me appreciated that the road to love is not always simple.<br /><br />Like Shades, it is written from the view of the female lead but I am also reading that there may be asecond book from the POV of bad boy Travis. I do have to say that would be interesting.<br /><br />Read it........I know you want to!
B004UID2LC|5.0|This app is amazing. It gives any video to you. You can download your favorite music without paying for it by amazon. I love this app because I get free content off one my favorite Internet resources: Youtube. I seriously recommend this app to anyone who likes to watch their favorite videos without wi-fi.
B007SGM084|2.0|With all the hype behind this trilogy I was expecting so much more!  It was a huge disappoint me. Sometimes less is more. The pages of sexual content left nothing to the imagination. I wish I wouldn't have purchased all 3 before reading the first one.
0696204800|3.0|The first couple pages were great.  The book had a pattern with the dimensions to follow, and then the remainder of the book goes through different appliques with no real guidance or directions on how to make or prepare.  But the graphics are great.

B005MRUCAY|4.0|I watched this show on tv and tought it was a good show I dont know why it went off air. but I guess I was one of the few people that liked it. I am into old sword and sheild movies and this one being I think it was on HBO was a good show. had a good story line,sex and violence that makes for good tv. but Like I said it's not on anymore so if you want to watch it you will have to buy the season disks. I now watch Game of Thrones with is another camelot like show on HBO but with a little more sci-fi it more and a sword and sorcery type show than camelot was but it also has a good story line, sex, violence and of course magic. so both are good shows and are worth watching just not with your kids.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book was a little rough for me at first, but the story line became addicting. I wanted to know more.  I couldn't wait to get to each chapter. I bought the second at 3 in the morning and the third before I finished the second.
B000HZEE64|5.0|Coach Carter is a fantastic movie, to me, it is a classic. but the best part about buying he digital version from amazon video is that i can watch it on my kindle fire, my roku tv box, my computer, etc whenever i want.  All i need is an internet connection and its a simple click to watch anywhere i want.  Plus i can always download it to a device beforehand if i will be somewhere without access to the internet.  The flexibility is great

B002PKMERU|3.0|Only about 50% of the songs have Donovan's real magic. The others lack spark. Some sound like children's sing-a-longs. Then most all of them are Variable Bit Rate (VBR) rips from the CD, and the quality suffers here and there on any one single track. Constant Bit Rate (CBR) delivers the best quality, and uniformly over a track and all tracks. Amazon is making a big mistake by offering up VBR mp3s and not telling it's customers this before they buy.<br /><br />The CD is marvelous here and there. About 50% of the songs have the magic that is Donovan's. But then the quality of the songs suffer now and then because they are VBR rips to save disk space and bandwidth. Cutting costs for amazon and delivering poorer than expected quality isn't a good business practice. Still, these good songs are truly marvelous, but now, should I buy the CD and rip them myself? I don't like paying twice for something!<br /><br />Boo hiss! Both Donovan and Amazon fail on this CD. 'Tisn't fair to the customer. I don't mind finding a few tracks that aren't quite what I expected, but I have complete disdain for tracks that are good, but ripped into VBR that lowers the overall quality of a good song.

B004W2UBYW|5.0|This book outlines the complex life and childhood of Steve Jobs and provides great insight into the things that drove him to perfection as an adult.  His need to have things perfect in his life, for example, precluded him from  buying any furniture for his home.  None of it was either designed or crafted perfectly.<br /><br />  This quest for perfection coupled with his inate salemanship helped him sharply focus Apple on its future but his arrogance ulitmately led to his downfall.<br /><br />If you ever wondered about the look of the Iphone, the design of the Mac, the evolution of ITunes then this book is a must read.

B004LWZW7O|2.0|(Possible Spoilers)<br /><br />In the future through the miracle of science everyone is engineered to stop growing old after the age of 25, but only live 1 year past said age unless they buy time by working or the case of the bad guys here they steal it from people to keep on living. In other words, when your clock reaches 0:00, you're dead.<br /><br />When a hard working man named Will Salas (Justin Timberlake, \\"Black Snake Moan\\") doesn't get all the time he feels he worked for, he goes to a club and helps a drunk Henry Hamilton (USA's \\"White Collar\\") who has lots of time on his hand (I mean that literally since their life clock is displayed on a person's arm).<br /><br />Said drunk gives Will his time while he's asleep then jumps off of a bridge and dies face first in a creek, so Will now has all the time in the world (bad pun I know). First he gives some to his best friend then his mother dies right before he's about to give her more time. Once Henry is fished out of the creek some agents of sorts (one is Cillian Murphy, \\"Batman Begins\\") and they start to follow the trail of time.<br /><br />From here on out its Will eluding the agents, heading to the capital to bring them down, oh and there's a beautiful rich woman (Amanda Seyfried \\"Red Riding Hood\\") who comes along with him on his mission. There's some good action, Timberlake makes for a good hero, Seyfried is simply stunning and Murphy is quite unlikeable as the villain.<br /><br />While the concept is good, the rest of the film is pretty basic and kinda just drags on in parts and the film overall is predictable. Sure it looks good, cool effects and all that, but its pretty hollow and dull in all other areas. *1/2 out of 4 stars.

B005FISC52|5.0|I lived in Wilmington, NC, where One Tree Hill was filmed, and I was fortunate to get an in-depth, behind-the-scenes look at what made the show so special.<br /><br />First, the production value was tremendous. You have never seen a group of people so meticulous in their craft. Every scene had to have exactly the right lighting, and every nano-nugget of dialogue had to be repeated thousands of times until the nuance was just... perfect, so that when Peyton said \\"why hello,\\" you knew she meant it, and it struck you on some primal level.<br /><br />I also overheard some of the discussions in the writers' room. It was phenomenal, like being in a beehive of genius, where every little writer bee would cross-pollinate the ideas of the others, and they would work relentlessly all in the service of the Queen. You. You are the queen. The 12-18-y-o girls who watch One Tree Hill are the queen, the honey to their comb. I've seen some of the writer bees at home with their wives and, seriously, all they can think about is you. It's kind of creepy. (Needless to say, this makes the wives a little fidgety, but they put up with it because they know it's only 9 seasons.)<br /><br />Just to paint the writers' room for you, one writer bee would say something like, \\"How about `oh but Lucas, you are the sun to my stars'?\\" and another writer bee would fire back, \\"Are you kidding? 12-18-y-o girls don't go for that. They want real dialogue, not cheesy bedtime fairytales. How about `oh but Lucas, you know I won't go for that--I'm a tough, modern gal who can buy her own iPods'?\\" and another writer bee would fire back, \\"Gal? Really? Is this the 19th Century?\\" And so on.<br /><br />I wish you could have seen the way the crew operated on set. Utter professionals. None of them were blessed with movie star good-looks - most of them had a saggy gut and were balding, and for some odd reason they were almost always carrying a half-peeled Snickers Bar - but you've never seen a group of guys so in tune with the modern young-female psyche. Even during their off hours, you'd find them reading pre-teen fashion blogs, trying to understand you, your essence. Such devotion to craft.<br /><br />One time - and I think this says it all - I walked in on the \\"testing\\" room, where they had a small horde of young females stationed in front of a TV and hooked up to galvanic skin response sensors. The crew would present various scenarios on the TV - Chad Michael Murray with a varsity jacket, Chad Michael Murray without a varsity jacket; Rape scene in a basement, Rape scene at the prom - and then they'd scientifically analyze the results from the skin sensors to determine which permutations elicited the highest physiological arousal. The whole point, you see, was to maximize arousal, to make you as lustful or as disturbed as possible. And what really made One Tree Hill unique was the professionalism and dedication, the almost clinical way in which they went about their business. It's why the show will go down in the pantheon of not just the greatest shows ever, but of the greatest artistic productions period. Customer is queen!with the modern young-female psyche.

B006H8BIIM|1.0|probably makes you pay to see the credits at the end, too. Plus, its not that fun anyways. It would be like paying to go to sleep in my own bed. lame!
B002MQYOFW|3.0|well written compelling reading as an adventure story - but you have to stomach the context of a world in which abuse of teenagers is the norm and happens throughout the book series - teen heroine glimpses that this is wrong  but at end there is no compelling reason to believe the system for the future will be better.  Running the world like a video game or reality show is shown up as vacuous and ugly but this book is overhyped as having a major message.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|I like that it's not an &quot;on line&quot; play. I don't always have wifi. I don't like how hard it is to win acorns,  but up dates helped a little.
0380715430|3.0|Interesting book but as other reviewers have noted, there are many points in which I question the research.  That said, I did enjoy learning about the history of the English language and the many twists and turns language has taken over the centuries.  The decline and disappearance of so many languages, including Manx, the language of my ancestors, is documented, reminding us of the fragility of the spoken and written word.  Amusing and entertaining.
B007L3BMGA|2.0|\\"50 shades of grey\\" was recommended to me by someone I'd just met.  That is puzzing, I wouldn't recommend a book like that to anyone, it would give away too much.  It would be like recommending \\"[[ASIN:B00008MIZ3 Baise Moi [Region 2]]]\\" - well you just wouldn't, well I wouldn't anyway.<br /><br />What I didn't like was basically most things...<br /><br />The 2D characters, the innocent virgin who does't realize she is super-hot and the rich business man, the best friend etc - all so stereotyped. The plot, what plot? An innocent girl meets S&M king and lots of sex ensues - hardly a plot.  The writing is so simplistic.<br /><br />I am amazed this became a best seller.
B004T2QZL8|5.0|This is an amazing game its so much fun to play!!!I seriously can't stop playing it...thats how much fun it is!;) People should definitely play this game.The thing I really like about this game is that it gets your imagination really going ..I definitely LOVE this game!!!!!

B0086700CM|5.0|it is really fun and addicting.I very much enjoyed playing it. Its a great pooping game and use it like that a lot.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|I absolutely loved te first half of this book, and near the middle things changed. You saw sides of characters that may not have been expected. Many people say that this book gives a bad message with the destructive relationship but honestly, its not that bad. These things do happen in real life so why not write about them. Just because it might be a bad subject doesn't mean it should be avoided. That said, I felt so many different emotions while reading this. I loved an hated characters, I had to put it down because of frustration, and other times I just downright couldn't help but grin. To me, a book has to do these things to be really great. Which this was. I don't want a book that is simple all happy and the end. This book delivered the ups and downs which I thought was great. Some people disagree with a lot of things that happened in this book, but I think you need that. What fun is there in reading something you don't want to question? To close, I will just say to take a chance on this book, personally I loved it an. You may hate it, but don't be deterred because of a few stuck up reviews.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|I just love this case. It is sleak, fits the Kindle like a glove, doesn't add any bulk.<br />This light weight case is great. It also protects really well. I just went on a trip and used my Kindle a lot everyday.The stand makes it perfect for watching movies on the plane. I dropped it a couple of times,got it wet a couple of times ( not submerged obviously). It still looks new. Other cases add some serious bulk, but this one keeps the KIndle looking sleak, and cool! I would definately recomend this case.
B005LAIH2W|5.0|The story was strong, the special affects epic, just beautiful cinematography.  It was mesmerizing. Anybody who says the plot is confusing was because they can't pay attention. It's has a deep plot with lots of detail which makes it all more interesting. If you want simplistic cartoon plots, go see a good  Spielberg movie.  I thought it was the best action/SiFi movie of the year until I saw The Avengers. Okay. So it's the second best action/SIFI movies of the year. I am amazed that few went to see it. As time goes by this movie will be better appreciated. Remember The Wizard of Oz was initially a flop as well. I'd give it 10 stars if I could.
B002KKCVVO|5.0|Look and feel great. If they last half as long as my last pair, which where leather and i had for 17 years, i will be very happy.

B0086DBE62|1.0|Someone on the Mirror Mirror team should have watched the highly successful, modern day fairytale, Enchanted (starring Amy Adams and Patrick Dempsey) before putting pen to paper in this mess of a movie.  Mirror Mirror is so incredibly painful to watch that if the viewer is insistent on seeing it to the end, it would be hugely helpful to simultaneously clean shelves, drawers and closets while watching.  This will at least make the experience seem somewhat productive.  From the beginning of the film, it was obvious there would be problems ahead.  And they continued throughout, but I'm happy to report that my shelves and drawers are clean and organized.  I'll finish the closets during the next disaster.
B008DR258W|5.0|Love this show! One of the few that my husband and I can watch together.  Very funny, intelligent writing and a great cast.  This show stands out as one of our favorites.  Would love to see its seasons extended to fall and spring, instead of being stuck in the dog days of summer.  You should totally watch SUITS, you won't regret it!

B007J4T2G8|1.0|I quit reading the book at 33%.  I could not believe this  woman could be attracted to such a self centered man and continue to be so.  I just got tired of reading all the intimate details.  Sex is not a spectator sport.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|This book was decent as far as racy romance goes, but I expected more. The second book was the same, but a tad redundant. I've read romance books for years, it wasn't anything I hadn't read before in the first two books. The third book was a total waist of time. Want to read a really good book with suspense and great characters? Keep looking, or pick up a Sandra Brown or Jude Deveraux book.
B0086700CM|5.0|My favorite games are the ones that don't sick up all your free time. You can play a little or a lot on this game and always feel entertained!
B007IXWKUK|3.0|For a second book this was just okay. Lots of repeating themes (biting her lip drives him crazy, laters babe, and clearly we can't forget how handsome Christian Gray is even though EVERY female who contacts him wants him.) A little rough in the writing area, but decent.
B006H8BIIM|1.0|There are many things that in app purchasing is great for. This game just abuses it and requires either hours of mind numbing play to earn enough credits to go further, or pay for it. This makes for a horibble game experience.
B007IXWL2C|1.0|The first two books were decent, but this book wasn't that great. I found myself skipping pages and paragraphs and really not engaged. The plot was poorly written and thought out. The characters were almost stale. 10 dollars per book made an expensive read, and this third book wasn't worth it. I was just not impressed.
B004QOB8SO|5.0|I watched the first season's show on PBS\\" Masterpiece. I sent that DVD to my son in Vietnam, who is equally an AC Doyle fan. He showed it to his class and they loved it. I ordered season two to complete the series for him and to show his new class in China.<br /><br />Only Hollywood can screw up AC Doyle writings but often they get it right too.
B006H8BIIM|1.0|Most devs at least give this garbage away for free, THEN they get you later when you're hooked on the game. The fact that they're charging up front for this tells me they don't have the confidence in their own game enough to think people will keep it long enough to actually make an IAP. Just more junk from greedy devs.
B006H8BIIM|1.0|But this is BS. A paid app should be beatable without spending more money (or spending an insane amount of time grinding). Not cool, not fun.<br />And why is it that every FAOTD lately is just like this one?
B0054JZC6E|5.0|even for a middle aged mom with the attention span of a gnat---this app offers many types of games.  i highly recommend it'!!!!!!
B0068FZ0GK|5.0|wonderful entertainment. this is one of the best movies ever. i will recommend it to any age. not good at writing this. just buy one you will not be sorry.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I'm sorry. I can't deny I read all three. Wasted money on all three. Lost Two weeks of my life on all three. But at the end of all three I was ready to dig my eyes out. If I read shy,wry,amused,bemused, angry mr grey miss steal one more time I was going to scream. Towards the end I even skipped the steamy parts ( they also became repetitiv ) and what I don't get is that it had all the makings for a steamy action packed thriller. But the antagonist were blah and the protagonist were blah-er. And the story was the blah-ist. I can only blame myself for wanting to see what the hype was about, and I am a fan of corny lifetime flicks. But if you are a reader of all genres like me...skip it
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|This is a fast processor... Takes a heavy load of work, and doesn't heat up like its older brothers.<br /><br />I have been an AMD fanboy since I got my first K6/2-450, and haven't had an Intel chip since 1998. At first, I was inclined to get a AMD Bulldozer FX-8150 to replace my Phenon 9850 that recently passed away. Its 8 cores should be better than the 4 cores found on these i5 chips, right? Not exactly... AMD must have missed out on something, or they must be trying some new technology that isn't quite tuned yet. The i5 single processor output is *a lot* faster than Bulldozer's. I have seen both, doing the same jobs, side by side, in a similar setup, and there is a notable difference in performance. This 3570K baby finished its tasks ages before the FX-8150.<br /><br />Kudos for Intel for making a solid performer! It brings out the WOW factor!<br /><br />Bottom line: couple this i5 with a decent Z77 motherboard, a couple of RAM sticks and a good video card, and you'll have a great machine that will last you for at least some 4 years.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|First of all I have to confess I am an Alien fan, so my opinion may be a little subjective. Anyhow, this collection is GREAT. The quality of the video is breathtaking (specially Alien and Aliens), the audio is great and best of all to me are the tons of extras for each movie. I did not have the chance to see Alien in the theaters when it first came out in 1979 (I was yet to be in my parents plans), but I did watch the re-release of the Director's cut in 2003 and also bought the Alien Quadrology. The quality of the Blu-Ray surpasses by far the DVD's. This collection will satisfy any Alien fan and also serves as a perfect opportunity for people who saw Prometheus and were intrigued enough to plunge into the Alien universe. You will not be disappointed with if you purchase this collection.
B0088RQ4X4|4.0|Having read all the bad press I was intrigued by the high ratings viewers gave this movie on Amazon. I have to say this was really enjoyable! Good vs. evil, and the guy gets the gal. I don't need a sermon when I just want to be entertained and escape into another world. The CGI was great! I found the plot easy to follow - despite the reviews. The characters well-rounded and engaging and, dare I say, far more appealing than some of the CGI (and human) creations in Star Wars I, II, and  III! Great holiday movie when you want to forget how much turkey you ate!
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book and think everyone should read it. I also bought a sweatshirt supporting the SEALS and Adam's military foundation.
086571701X|5.0|I love this book.  Just a quick explanation in case you are wondering what aquaponics is all about.  Hydroponics is similar - growing plants without conventional soils.  The big difference is that while hydroponics usually involves a lot of chemicals (pretty much forget organics) and frequent changes of the water used, aquaponics is a much more natural approach.  You use the excrement from fish you are growing to fertilize your plants.  The plants generate conditions that clean up the water for the fish.  Life is good.  You don't waste water, you grow your plants quickly in a balanced and stable closed loop system, requiring a lot less maintenance than hydroponics.<br /><br />I had just finished reading \\"Mini-Farming: Self-Sufficiency on ¼ acre\\", and was ready to get my greenhouse started.  In the midst of applying the material in that first rate book (you should read it and Maximizing Your Mini Farm: Self-Sufficiency on 1/4 Acre as well), I got started on the aquaponics book.  The books, gardening styles, and logic mesh well together.  SO, while I have not yet gotten the aquaponics installation up and running (one thing that does not come with the books is time), that is where all of this reading and preparation is heading.<br /><br />Especially if you are inclined toward organics, this is the book you want to read.  The author doesn't just provide instructions, she explains what is going on and why.  She also provides alternatives.  You end up with the information you need, enabling you to make informed decisions.  Especially if the weather in your area is unpredictable, this can let you grow your crops in stable and controlled conditions.  That's a good thing....
B005K17RU0|5.0|Works great. Use it all the time. Really like the 15 day forecast. I have never had a problem with it.

B005LAIGSC|2.0|Watching once, but then knowing in advance how it ends, is not worth waiting for, again.<br /><br />Why anyone was entertained by this film enough to say that they'd watch it again, must mean that either you don't have a lot of other movies to watch, or you just wanna look cool, having a new currently released movie. (\\"Hey, look what I got!\\")<br /><br />This Blu-ray (or DVD) is likely to be selling for about $4.99 within the next year or so.<br /><br />Yes, I know this isn't really a review of the movie.  It's more about my experience of watching it. I would not bother to watch this semi-yawner again.
B003WWDFUU|2.0|I first read DADoES in my late teens and loved it, but now, more than 30 years later, the story feels rushed to me. It is too long to be a short story but not long enough for a novel. I felt no real connection to any of the characters. They were not fleshed out and their world was not convincing.<br /><br />The protagonist, Rick Deckard, seems just as emotionally stunted as the androids he \\"retires\\" for a living. I kept wondering when the empathy test was last administered to him - and if he would pass it again. Given his lack of emotional response to the discovery of an alternate police station (supposedly \\"infested with andys\\") and the death of his pet, I seriously doubt it!

B00782O7IY|5.0|I saw THE ARTIST in a theater in Fairfax, VA, in January, and the audience loved it so much that they stood up and cheered at the end, which I haven't seen in a movie theater in many a year.  I'm so glad that the film is finally out on DVD and Blu-ray.<br /><br />The film, which deservedly won the Oscar for Best Picture, is set in late 1920s-early 1930s Hollywood.  It follows the career of silent-film vaudevillian George Valentin (Jean Dujardin), once a big star at Kinograph Studios, as he struggles with the transition to talking pictures. He also seems to be more devoted to his dog (Uggie), than to his wife, Doris (Penelope Ann Miller).  Along the way, he meets a young film extra, Peppy Miller (Bérénice Bejo), at a premiere.  When Variety, the show-biz paper (then and now), prints a picture of Peppy kissing George, Doris is fit to be tied, and that incident, along with his excessive devotion to his dog, eventually leads to the breakup of his marriage.<br /><br />When Kinograph Studios phases out silent films in favor of talkies, George blows them off, saying that talkies are a gimmick that will never catch on, and leaves the studio to produce his own independent silent film (which flops).  Meanwhile, Peppy signs with Kinograph and becomes a huge star in the early talkies.  George has a nightmare about sound films in which the extras laugh at him (the only sound sequence until the end of the film), his marriage is over, he is forced to fire his longtime butler (James Cromwell), and he becomes despondent and attempts suicide by burning his silent-film collection (which sets his house on fire).  Fortunately, the dog escapes from the house and manages to get his master rescued.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Peppy, who has fallen in love with George, offers him a place to stay at her house to enable him to recover from his injuries.  After blackmailing the executives at Kinograph Studios, she convinces them to give Valentin the script for the studio's new musical.  Valentin still does not want to do it, and attempts suicide again (this time with a gun) while Peppy is at the studio.  Fortunately, the attempt is unsuccessful, and Peppy arrives at the house, insisting that she help him.  Although George finally realizes that Peppy loves him (and vice versa), he still believes that no one wants to hear him talk, but she insists that he try something and asks him to trust her.  Back at Kinograph Studios, the two perform a stunning tap-dance number, and the studio executives love it, which brings the film to a satisfying conclusion that brought the theater's audience to its feet.  Dujardin and Bejo, who are not professionally trained dancers, took five months of intensive tap instruction to learn the two-minute routine, yet they look like they have danced their whole lives.  The routine reminds me of Fred Astaire and Eleanor Powell's famous tap duet, which appeared originally in [[ASIN:B00008AOWK Broadway Melody of 1940]], and was also featured in [[ASIN:B0002OXVD2 That's Entertainment]], although the Dujardin-Bejo number is not as long as the Astaire-Powell number, and does not have an \\"a cappella\\" sequence.<br /><br />Dujardin and Bejo are superb, as are the rest of the film's cast, including Cromwell, Miller, Uggie the dog, John Goodman, Missi Pyle, and others.  The film's soundtrack (which I discuss in my review of  [[ASIN:B005LL4U54 The Artist]] CD) is absolutely marvelous.<br /><br />Extras on the DVD include three featurettes, a blooper reel, and a very interesting Q&A session with some of the cast members.<br /><br />Purchase of this film is an absolute must, and the soundtrack CD is recommended also.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Loved this book, would definitely recommend it. Am currently reading the second book in the series, it is just as good.  Can't wait until the last one.
B005LL4U54|5.0|Although I saw THE ARTIST in the theater in January and loved it, I decided to hold off on purchasing the soundtrack CD until the film was issued on [[ASIN:B00782O7IY DVD]], so I could purchase both simultaneously.<br /><br />The soundtrack to this wonderful film - more important for this film than most movies because the film is silent - is excellent in itself.  Most of the selections are composed by Ludovic Bource (except for \\"Estancia Op. 8\\") and performed by the Brussels Philharmonic, and they envoke the essence of old-style Hollywood film music of the '20s and '30s.  There are also three vintage jazz recordings: Red Nichols and His Five Pennies' \\"Imagination\\" (not the song that Frank Sinatra and Tommy Dorsey recorded years later), Duke Ellington's \\"Jubilee Stomp,\\" and Rose \\"Chi-Chi\\" Murphy's version of \\"Pennies from Heaven.\\"  Murphy is not credited on either the CD or the film; I don't know why - legal reasons, perhaps.  The jazzy closing number, \\"Peppy and George,\\" is reminiscent of Benny Goodman's \\"Sing, Sing, Sing,\\" and is used in the film's closing tap-dance sequence with George Valentin (Jean Dujardin) and Peppy Miller (Bérénice Bejo).<br /><br />This CD is a must-have, but don't buy it unless you get the film also.

030758836X|5.0|This book may make some people feel uncomfortable in parts....my kind of book! Not only does it give amazing insights into the \\"man/woman struggle\\", it is so layered. It takes you on a journey you have been on before (he said/she said) in a unique and engaging way. It was very hard to put this book down even for a second! This is the first book I have read by this author and am now starting another tonight! Those who complain about the ending may be a bit confused. It was perfect!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I initially heard about this book on the \\"Dr. Drew\\" show on HLN and then my daughter read it and suggested I give it a try. Don't waste your time or your money--this is DRIVEL. Ridiculous storyline, unbelievable characters who use fussy, formal speech patterns, sickening sex scenes, and redundancy throughout...I've read better Harlequin Romances when I was a teen.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|I don't really write reviews but I felt compelled to write one for this trash.. Yes Trash. I only read this book as most of my friends were telling I really needed to read this book but I'm sorry I really do not see what the appeal is. Why are women, so enamored by this is beyond me - did they actually read the same thing I did or am I missing something.  I found it demeaning and degrading to women especially the thought of someone having to sign a contract and basically do as she is told or be severely punished by a man.. I'm sorry I just don't get it..<br /><br />It's a sad world when this person is making millions off of something so horrible

B00782O7IY|4.0|Yes - I am old fashioned.  This dvd was a charming relief to the usual movie fare - black and white, silent with a fantastic musical score, fresh faces, simple. tap dancing (love!).  But when one character gave the 3 finger salute with one finger to another character, it just swept some of the magic away for me.  If the 'bird' was around in the late 20s I doubt it was included in movies of that era.  Seemed a little classless and unnecessary.
B00772M1F6|5.0|\\"Signs & Signifiers\\"  is a breath of fresh air for classic rock & roll. These guys are really making an effort to embody all of the good parts of rock & roll<br />into their new music.
B004GEB9UQ|5.0|Loren Cordain's book is just as accurate now as when it was originally published a decade ago. This book is very well-written and contains a wealth of information on the Paleo lifestyle. Cordain explains how to abandon the Standard American Diet (SAD) in favor of one that our ancestors followed.<br /><br />After my wife's diabetes diagnosis last year, we've scoured the internet to find better food & lifestyle options. Dr. Cordain's book is one of the best we've found. It lays out everything one needs to do to eat better, lose weight (rather easily, I have to say), and improve one's overall health.<br /><br />I cannot recommend this book high enough! It's great!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is a really good game you should get it some time. I bet you would like it. peace out.

034580404X|5.0|Everyone in my office was reading this book and talking about Christain and Ana. So, feeling left out I purchased this set and once I got started I couldn't stop! I read all 3  books in 8 days... When do I have time? Well I spent no time on facebook ;) and I read every morning on my way to work and home...plus everynight before bed. I loved Freed it had alot of suprises and now I find myself sad that it is over and I so want more...I hear that Bared To You is like 50? So, I am considering purchasing it to fill this now void I have..LOL!! Enjoy!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I wasn't sure how much I'd like this game at first, but after playing through the first 3 levels of games I am a big fan.  Some of the games are easy and others require a bit more skill, but overall it's a fun challenge to get lots of points to unlock more. The ads didn't start showing up until recently, but not too terribly annoying and I can easily avoid them by hitting the back button on my Kindle.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|Sorry this was delayed because I did not replace it  until this week. I was very satisfied with the response time, the cable fit perfect and was exactly what I needed.  I would not hesitate to deal with Amazon again for anything. Everyone I had contact with was very accomadating and a PLEASURE TO WORK WITH.
B006R8GK2Q|5.0|Really enjoyed the story and game, addicting!  I played and finished and played again. Would recommend for ling shifts, makes time go by.
B00095NX9G|5.0|WHAT MAKES THIS DVD SPECIAL - The learning/drilling method is new for me. Now that I have seen Irina's DVD ([[ASIN:B00095MBQ2 The Bellydance Tribal Fusion Workout]]), I find the method similar. The isolations are layered from the start, some of them are quite difficult, since the lower body and the upper body move in opposite directions or at different speeds. If you are a beginner you can stay with the specific isolation/shimmy that is being drilled, whereas if you are more advanced you can try to layer the steps/arms combinations to it. This can be quite challenging, since it is difficult to ignore the other movements and just stick for example to your chest circle and not move your feet; so you feel you cannot follow. But at some point you manage to stick to one movement and at some next point and without really noticing it, you will add the feet in one combination (some are quite intuitive moves, so you get into the steps gradually and at your own pace). Same applies to the choreographies, they are complete choreos as an advanced dancer would perform them, but you can leave out the hip shimmies that accompany some footwork or undulation. Your dance will not look as \\"rounded\\" but simple steps performed elegantly and with precision also look good. This method allows you to \\"grow\\" with the DVD, so you can use it for a long time period.<br /><br />YOGA BONUS -I was not the yoga type, I thought it would be boring, but after doing this DVD and observing the results, I would say that only for the 1st yoga practise I would pay the price of this 2 DVD set. (Please note that I do not have any other yoga DVD to compare with). The yoga session is not fun, but somehow it is also not boring. I have workout DVD's (Gym-style with weights, etc.) and all I can think of is when they will finish. With the yoga session, although it is slow paced and repetitive I can go through it quite ok. The session is perfectly doable by anybody (nothing complicated, just alternating down dogs, planks, child poses and similar), but still the day after I did it, I felt completely different. Posture and carriage improved, my back, abs and hips felt terrific, I was energized...For one week I only did the 1st yoga practise and my dance improved significantly without even dancing, I can do the hip drops faster, my shimmy's are a bit better and without pain afterwards... The only DVD's of which I can say I noticed immediate results are: [[ASIN:B000ZZT7BS Fat Burning Fusion]] which makes you feel immediately energized and is fun to do and [[ASIN:B00077BD7A Winsor Pilates Basic 3 DVD Workout Set (Basics Step-By-Step/20 Minute Workout/Accelerated Body Sculpting)]] of which only by doing the step-by-sep instruction- not even the real 20 minute workout- my back felt right where it should be and I slept like a baby (better than with yoga). However, the Winsor Pilates DVD is boring to such an extent that I have only done it twice, even though I really think it helps. On the other hand, this yoga session is easier to do and shorter than almost anything I have tried and it combines the benefits of the other 2 - energy + correct alignment of spine and abs support, plus it is the only one in which I also feel my hips sit in the proper place to support the upper body. Although it should not surprise me, it's ancient wisdom after all...<br /><br />CARDIO CHALLENGE: From low to high, depending on the section  TONING: Medium  CHOREOGRAPHY DIFFICULTY: Advanced Beginner to Advanced Intermediate  INSTRUCTIONAL QUALITY: Very good  MUSIC: Very good  FUN FACTOR: High<br /><br />CONTENT:<br />1ST DVD - DRILLS:<br />1) Yoga practise (this is a full yoga section, not a brief warm-up)<br />2) Leg strengthening - has a classy look: simple steps combined with elegant arm postures. In this section Rachel teaches you some footwork that will be used later in the choreographies.<br />3) Shoulders/Ribs/hips isolations - drilled at different tempos (1/4, 2/4, 8/4 and 16/4 notes, this latter on releve). In the ribcage section you start layering these on top of four different travel steps.<br />4) Shimmy session - Best shimmy layering section in my collection. It definitely increases your heart rate (cardio element) and it is fun to do. In this section be prepared for a lot of layering, since here you practise everything you have learned before (arm trajectories, shoulders, ribcage, mayas, etc.), but layered on top of your shimmies, travel steps and turns (quite challenging).<br />5) Yoga cool down (this is a full yoga section, not a brief cool down)<br /><br />2ND DVD - CHOREOGRAPHIES:<br />1) Yoga for backbending<br />2) 2 Choreographies (step by step break down/Practise loops/Full Choreography) - Nice choreographies explained in detail in the step-by-step section, drilled extensively in the loops section, where each segment is repeated indefinitely until you manually stop it. You can also play the full choreography non-stop. The choreographies consist in four combinations each containing four 8-counts. This is almost as long as other choreographies, only these seem more difficult, because everything is completely layered on top of travelling shimmies and many are also on relevee. Even though it has no popping and ticking the layering is difficult.<br />3) 5 Mini-lessons (Arm movement, Steps, Technique for backbending, rythm, yoga breathing) - of these, the technique for backbending and the rythm lessons are the best, the others are nothing special.<br />4) Yoga cool down (exactly the same as the one in disc 1)<br />5) 2 performances<br /><br />MUSIC: Very good choice<br />1st DVD, mainly drums to mark the beat for the isolations (excellent decision to my opinion)<br />2nd DVD one slow and one fast tempo, for each choreography (nice pieces, I specially like the fast one)<br /><br />EMPHASIS:<br />Good overall emphasis, you have simply everything in this DVD-set.<br /><br />WHAT IS BETTER THAN IN OTHER DVD's:<br />Shimmies, drills, music selection, nice choreographies, yoga sections, arm embellishments - I specially like the tribal style signature arms and hips (almost everything is excellent).<br />With this specific DVD I will rather put the very few things I would have liked different:<br />1) One of the yoga sessions should be smaller, so as to really use it as a warm-up/cool down, the space in the second DVD dedicated to repeat the yoga cool down from disc 1 could have been used for 2 smaller independent sessions.<br />2) The tutorial part is not so good as in other DVD's, but this is also not the main focus of this DVD. If you would like a tutorial for absolute beginners, I recommend [[ASIN:B000FSL8WQ Bellydance Basics and Beyond: Technique for a Solid Foundation]] or [[ASIN:B001TZ70DU Love Potion - The Bellydance Workout]].

0307352145|3.0|\\"Quiet\\" by Susan Cain focuses the impact introverts have and can make on society, only if the extroverts would listen more to them!<br /><br />I consider myself an \\"ambivert\\" - about equally part introvert and extrovert:<br /><br />1.  Enjoy being with people, usually in a smaller group (I regularly meet with about 3-6 other men in a fellowship and accountability group.  I can get energized by being around the right kind of people for me.<br /><br />2.  Also enjoy being alone with the Lord or in my own thoughts - usually get more engergized by reading a good book, walking on the beach, or visiting an historical place rather than spending time in meaningless conversation with people with whom I have no connection with.<br /><br />Among the topics covered include:<br /><br />1.  Differences between introverts and extroverts.<br /><br />2.  Visiting places that supposedly enhance tendencies towards extroversion while potentially turning off introverts (more about this later).<br /><br />3.  Brainstorming and multi-tasking are overrated and often are not productive (amen to that!).<br /><br />4.  Much of your best work may be done in solitude than in groups (also more about this later).<br /><br />5.  Understanding your sweet spot can increase your effectiveness in all areas in your life.<br /><br />6.  Historical examples of introverts and extroverts.<br /><br />7.  Suggestions for living as an introvert in a society that appears to value extroversion more.<br /><br />I heartily agree with Cain's conclusion that your best work may be done in solitude instead of in a group setting.  Many of the best ideas I had in my jobs were done in solitude.  Another example happened in college when I was in a group of fellow Air Force ROTC cadets assigned a project by our Professor of Aerospace Studies.  Several of my ideas were \\"shot down\\" by the group and I determined to incorporate my ideas into the project regardless of what others thought.  When the papers were graded and returned, guess who got the best grade?<br /><br />I have to disagree with Cain's conclusion that based on her visit to Saddleback Community Church led by Rick Warren, that megachurches feed extroversion while apparently putting introversion on a lower priority.  First of all, she bases way too much of her conclusion on just one visit.  As a follower of Jesus Christ, I do not know what her religious beliefs or background are (possibly Jewish, since one of her grandfathers was a rabbi?).  Having been a member of 3 different megachurches the past 24 years, there is certainly room for introverts!  Indeed, many pastors and members I have known in megachurches have certainly had tendencies towards introversion.  Also, the sermon preached by a guest pastor today focuses on creating margin in your life where you proactively make time to be by yourself or with a small group (family, friends, etc.) and seek solitude with God.<br /><br />Cain's book starts strong but some of her conclusions I have to disagree with.  Perhaps as a Princeton and Harvard Law School graduate, she should have analyzed her findings a bit more.<br /><br />Still, the book is a good read and encouragement for introverts and the extroverts who can learn to slow down and listen long enough to get to know the introverts in their lives.ned, guess who got the best grade?<br /><br />I have to disagree with Cain's conclusion that based on her visit to Saddleback Community Church led by Rick Warren, that megachurches feed extroversion while apparently putting introversion on a lower priority.

030758836X|5.0|This novel is a maze of zingers, both Amy and Nick are clever and self-aware, yet their course winds through a sultry hell that binds and breaks.  So they reject redemption for the sake of seeing whither/wither Extremity beckons, predictably downhill.  Ultimately, they do not escape their confines; consciousness/analysis is inadequate and has no metaphysical perspective.  Such are the trappings/emotional-content of civilization, mankind as manipulated into being manipulative.  The cure is Conscience, but the game is too far gone, too addictive, so humanity marches/stumbles along until a looming Judgment Day settles the issue, so it can start up again.

The interface works better than any other example of the genre I've tried on Fire, and the plot/dialog, while corny, don't detract from the game pplay like they often tend to do.  All in all, a decent game.

My only problem was not with the book..it was what in the WORLD can I possibly read following this great story? Honestly, I had trouble finding something to read after this one..nothing appealed to me - nothing held my interest. It was an 'act' that was impossible to follow. Great book.

0374275637|5.0|If you enjoyed Moneyball and Freakonomics, you owe it to youself to read this book. 'Fast and Slow' gets under the hood, where Lewis and Levitt/Dubner just kicked the tires and drove around the block. It is written directly **at** you. Kahneman, a Nobel Laureate, basically the Edison of behavioral economics, includes a test in every chapter - very simple 'choose A or B.' The tests aren't hard; in fact, they are so EASY. And, then, you realize...Kahneman got me again. If you make your living on 'intuition' or depend on someone who does, and you don't read this book ...shame on you and your future.

You get paid time at your job, selling items at a pawn shop, and you can even get loans. You can also give time to people and steal time from people. The rich have plenty of time to live, but others struggle to stay alive in this show which is what brings us to the plot. Will Salas(JUSTIN TIMBELAKE) is hunted down for killing a man he didn't kill. When found he takes a hostage named Sylvia Weis(AMANDA SEYFRIED) who soon becomes his partner in stealing time from banks and other places and sharing it with everyone. They are hunted down by a timekeeper named Raymnd Leon(CILLIAN MURPHY) as they continue to keep stealing more time! This is an excellent movie to watch.

Then I had to find out what else Denise Grover Swank wrote because there had to be more.  Happy happy joy joy there IS more. I gotta go read twenty nine and a half.....

B007STXHTM|2.0|This is not a great housing. The large rectangular glass covering the lens also obstructs the view of the front screen. If you are filming underwater and then surface, you can count on water droplets messing up your shot with the increased surface area. Before I purchased this I was using a third party replacement flat lens that fit right in my original housing by removing the screws and bubble lens, and replacing it with a flat lens. It had worked great for the past year, but the housing buttons recently started sticking and the lens had minor scuffs. It seemed cheaper and more convenient to get the official Gopro dive housing, instead of a new original housing and flat lens, and I'm sorry I did. There are better alternatives.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This book is so awful, so terrible that it forced me to do two things I've never done before, write a review (I feel it's my duty as a human being to warn people to avoid the crap that is this book) and return, yes return the book!!!  A friend, whose opinion I will never trust again, recommended this book as an amazing erotic story and how the character of Christian Grey was just the perfect guy and once I started reading this book, I wouldn't be able to put it down.  So I looked the book up and when I saw that it was inspired from the Twilight books, rather than listen to my gut or the very, very accurate negative reviews, I went ahead and downloaded the book. I couldn't even finish the book. The writing is terrible, the characters are flat, unbelievable and you don't care about them not one little bit. I hoped maybe the erotic bits of the book would make up for this but no! They are laughable and reminded me of the really bad harlequin romance novels I read when I was 13. Please don't believe the hype with this book.  If you don't understand/hate the whole Twilight phenomena avoid this book like the plague.
B004QSQML8|5.0|Legend was a bit of a departure for Ridley Scott after his phenomenal Alien and Blade Runner (now considered landmarks in modern science fiction cinema with significant and lasting affects on the genre), but I enjoyed it tremendously.  I recently watched the DVD version of The Director's Cut to experience the alternate soundtrack by Jerry Goldsmith and the additional 24 minutes with Ridley's tweaks and changes.  I was quite disappointed, however; for me, it seemed to drag in places and the music was flat compared to the mood-enhancing, mystical quality of the Tangerine Dream soundtrack.  (I've always preferred the versions of films I first fell in love with in the movie theater.  The Final Cut of Blade Runner on Blu-ray is an exception . . .)<br /><br />It was good to be reminded of the splendor of the marvelous visual production (one of Ridley Scott's artistic specialties), so I ordered the Blu-ray Ultimate Edition and just watched the original US Theatrical version.  THAT'S the movie I love!  And Ridley's textual introductions to both Blu-ray versions indicate (as shown in the two additional images for the product here at Amazon) that the US Theatrical version is \\"from the film's inter-negative\\" and is a better-quality transfer than The Director's Cut version from a lost \\"pristine answer print\\".<br /><br />Ridley says \\"that each version of LEGEND has its own strengths\\" and he leaves it up to us to decide which one we \\"think is best\\".  I say the original US Theatrical version!

I'm not going off on some long winded diatribe comparing this release to previous ones but I'll sum it up and say 90% of \\"Living Things\\" is good. Real good.

0345803485|1.0|I can't even believe I stuck it out and finished this book. I abhor romance novels in general but given the \\"best seller\\" status and a few recommendations from friends I thought I would give it a go.  The main character, Christian Grey is so UNBELIEVABLE it is comical.  Billionaire, young, built, sex god, philanthropist trying to solve world hunger, generous, helicopter pilot, with a dark side. Right.....<br /><br />And then there's Ana who is continually over fretting EVERYTHING while chewing on her lip. I wanted to smack her.<br /><br />If you are a romance novel reader and you want some racy (albeit unbelievable sex) you might find it amusing. If you would rather read something a bit more challenging.....save your money and RUN elsewhere!
078322933X|2.0|\\"Fear\\" is beautifully photographed in the Pacific Northwest and the dark clouds and foggy forests make the perfect background for an otherwise middling film. Sweet, dim-witted Nicole (Reese Witherspoon) meets hunky David (Mark Wahlberg)and falls for his perfect pecs and filtered toughness, much to the dismay of her Father (a pre-CSI and surprisingly buffed William Petersen). Daddy dislikes David instantly but Nicole's stepmom (Amy Brenneman) and best friend Margo (Alyssa Milano) try to convince Steve(Petersen) that he's got it all wrong. Poor dumb Nicole should have listened to her father. David turns out to be menace, complete with a nasty \\"entourage,\\" and his list of victims grows to include the Sheriff and the family dog, among others. \\"Fear\\" has some suspense but few redeeming qualities. Witherspoon, in her pre-\\"Legally Blond\\" period, is vapid and annoying. She played nearly an identical, though smaller, character in \\"American Psycho\\" where she was blown off the screen by Christian Bale. Wahlberg is equally unsuccessful here - his evil scowl and vulgar demeanor seem like posing instead of acting. Only Petersen gives a decent performance, but he is hampered by a script full of gratuitous violence, homophobia, and Witherspoon's shrill, synthetic personna.

034580404X|3.0|Quick and easy reads. The first book sets the tone for the rest. At times, it felt like there was more pages about (bondage)  sex than substantive character development or even a plot. There wasn't much for the 2 main characters to overcome. They are young, beautiful, he is very wealthy, a CEO who has time to email her every 15 mins, buy her designer clothes and a brand-new car, transport her in his own aircraft. Like a typical romance novel, he is experienced while she is initially a virgin. He is always ready to have sex and is able to satisfy her every time. In my opinion, there was never a serious threat to their relationship after the beginning of the 2nd book.
0143119680|4.0|Diana was born a witch but, after the death of her parents, has sworn of witchcraft. While doing research on the history of alchemy she stumbles across a manuscript that has been lost for years, a manuscript that was never supposed to be found.  Now Diana finds herself in the middle of a fight for the manuscript between witches, vampires, and daemons and for the first time in her life she needs her witchcraft to survive.  Throw in a romance with dashing vampire Matthew and Harkness has a the recipe for a very entertaining novel.<br /><br />While reading \\"A Discovery of Witches\\" I found myself vaguely reminded of Elizabeth Kostova's \\"The Historian\\" and while the books are very different in plot and content there are some elements they share.  Both take an ancient legend and transform it into something that fits into a more modern world while having heroines who spend most of their time in the library researching through old manuscripts.  That being said I think Harkness's novel has a less serious tone and it reads like pure entertainment.  The plot is complex and there are enough new twists thrown into the text that keeps it from reading like the majority of vampire/supernatural creature fiction out today.  I particularly enjoyed the scientific elements Harkness includes and the DNA investigations of witches' powers.<br /><br />The relationships Diana has with her aunts and the other witches seem realistic, but I found her relationship with Matthew to be odd at times, with far too time spent discussing the consummation of their relationship and the vampire's desire to \\"take things slow.\\"  Other than the somewhat stereotypical vampire-warm blood relationship plot points I thought the novel took some interesting twists and set up a good foundation for the rest of the series.<br /><br />I really enjoyed this book and even at over 500 pages it makes a light summer read.  I finished it in just a couple days and never felt that the plot lagged or had to force myself to get through pages.  Harkness does a good job with pacing and this makes the book feel shorter than it is.  I'm looking forward to the next book in the trilogy coming this July.through pages.

030758836X|5.0|\\"Gone Girl\\" was absolutely brilliant from start to unbelievable finish. Until now Edward Albee's George and Martha  (Whose afraid of Virginia Woolf?) were probably the epitome of toxic couples in fiction.  Not any longer.<br /><br />Amy and Nick are celebrating their 5th wedding Anniversary in Carthage Missouri.  (Ironically the University where George was a professor of History). The only problem with this scenario is that Amy is missing, it appears that Nick may have had something to do with her disappearance, and the police suspect foul play.  Nick and Amy's disintegrating marriage is explored in alternating chapters.  Nick's POV is written in the present while we learn about Amy from her diary.  Just when you think you know where this book is heading it veers in a direction that was totally unpredictable.<br /><br />There are so many topics for book clubs to discuss you could probably spend three weeks and not scratch the surface. (The media's role in manipulating the public's view on a  defendants guilt or innocence, the games people need to play in order to feel worthy of love).  The secondary characters were so well written they could warrant their own books.  Equal parts psychological thriller and social satire the Dunne's emotional dependance upon each other gives new meaning to the words \\"until death do us part\\".<br /><br />If you read one book this summer - this is the one.

0345803493|4.0|So book 2, I know I said on my review of Fifty Shades of Grey that I wasn't sure I'd read the other two books in the trilogy let alone go and buy them, well that lasted all of about three days. I couldn't resist this new addiction I appear to have.<br /><br />In Darker, we rejoin Christian Grey and Anastasia Steele within just a few days from where book 1 ended. (don't read on if you haven't read book 1 - whilst I won't give any spoilers to this book, I don't want to spoil book 1 for you!) All the troubles they have experienced together just can't stop them for needing each other. Whether it is her need to try to help him recover from his past or just the raw physical attraction/needs she has , she can't stay away. This is lust taken to the extreme.<br /><br />I found in this book there is much more of a story and less sex (unless I am now immune to it!!) It still is a very erotic read in places and will make you blush if you are reading it on the train (that was me!) but you learn a bit more about Christian and why he is like he is. Whilst I can see he is extremely damaged and a Jekyll and Hyde character, we see a venerable side to him that makes Ana's decision and actions a little bit more understandable.<br /><br />There is repetition in the book and I am starting to dislike the saying \\"my inner goddess\\" more than I should but for a book that everyone is talking about (and you know my views on  'IT' books), I can understand it and I'm not ashamed to say, I am already on book 3!<br /><br />They may not be the greatest written books but they have something that makes me want to pick them up at every spare opportunity I have and as a reviewer, I can't ask for more.

B005HS00V4|2.0|I love Peter Gabriel's music, particularly when he wraps his sometimes rather pretentious lyrics around driving, complex African rhythms.  Take away the drums and what's left?  Pretentious lyrics with a bland background.  Sort of like Chinese food without the MSG, there does not seem to be much point.  Now, I really like classical music but Shock the Monkey is no concerto either, so it lacks the complexity of that genre, and unlike the late Freddy Mercury, Peter Gabriel cannot do opera.  If you like bland music, this is the disk for you.

B006RUJST6|1.0|After reading other reviews i was excited to read this book. Although it is a quick read due to the uncomplicated writing style, the author leaves no mystery,or rather anything to deduce, with the thorough, oversimplistic internal ruminations of what seems to be an insecure girl. It lacks creativity. Also the chemistry between the characters is lack luster at best. For better romance and character development read the Divergent series.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I do not understand why this book became so popular. The writing is awful, with the same bad adjectives used over and over. I'm not opposed to the graphic depiction of sexuality, or even that some of it is deviant.  What bothers me most about this book is the poor quality. It's like something written by an 8th grader with a heavy handed use of their thesaurus. The repetitive nature of the dialogue and descriptions makes even the graphic descriptions of S&M boring by the end!  If you want to read something erotic, and a little bit dark, try Kushiel's Dart by Jacquiline Carey!!

B003EYVXVY|2.0|This is one of the dopiest movies ever made.  Sure, the special effects are cool, so that gives it a 2+ star.  Otherwise this movie is full of stereo-typical  groups of people, military, evil corporations,  the entire enchilada.

Eva is a strong, sensuous, smart female lead, and Gideon, although also rich and famous and hot at such a young age (which those aspects of this genre are hard for me to buy into), seems more realistic and treats her better than that 50 Shades idiot (I already can't even remember his first name!). Day tackles child sexual abuse here, giving the storyline more depth and purpose than your typical \\"smut.\\" The sex scenes are HOT, and the characters are all likable, making it great summer beach reading for anyone wanting to take a break from thinking too much in this heat!

I found this book to be very easy to read, fun and stimulating in terms of vocabulary building (and much more).  I love learning new vocab words and I love that my kindle fire allows me to highlight unknown words to look up the definition as I'm reading.  This trilogy is chocked full of fun vocabulary words.  In terms of storyline, I expected this book to be much more violently raunchy but was pleasantly surprised at the yummy love story intertwined into the kinky business.  If you need a little spice and action in your summer,  this is the book to read!  Laters!
B007ZZKWHY|3.0|The publicity material for this film might give some the false impression that it is to some extent an adventure movie, if a tongue-in-cheek one. It isn't. \\"Iron Sky\\" is black comedy from beginning to end. It has moments of genuine comic genius, though to get to them you have to watch a fair amount of material that is very silly indeed.<br /><br />Any supporters of the GOP \\"Tea Party\\" or fans of Governor Sarah Palin should probably avoid this unless your sense of humour is extremely good at laughing with or at people who are ridiculing things you believe in. And anyone who had assumed, from the way this film is advertised as a battle against a nazi threat, that it would be an opportunity to enjoy a guilt-free heroic battle against a dangerous and utterly evil foe - a bit like a film version of David Drake's novel \\"[[ASIN:0812536207 Fortress]]\\" which was recently republished in \\"[[ASIN:1451637942 Loose Cannon: The Tom Kelly Novels]]\\" may be rather disappointed.<br /><br />We are told at the beginning of the film that it is 2018. There is a new female US President, (played by Stephanie Paul), who is in the middle of her first term and campaigning for re-election. Stephanie Paul and the producers of the film go out of their way to indicate in almost every possible way other than actually using her name, that the President is based on Sarah Palin. It would probably be fairer to say, on a caricature of Sarah Palin as those who are least fond of the former Alaska governor might see her.<br /><br />The President has re-started the Apollo programme, and the U.S. astronauts who land on the far side of the moon are horrified to run into a moonbase full of nazis.<br /><br />Apparently in 1945 elements of Hitler's third reich escaped to the moon, and for seventy years have been rebuilding their strength, ready to strike back ...<br /><br />Don't switch off before the end of the credits. When the camera starts to pan out as the hero and heroine embrace at the end of the film, their location is seen from further and further away, e.g. from out in space. As the first credits appear on the screen something rather important can be seen happening if you watch the earth closely. At the very end of the credits another image appears in the camera view which appears to be meant as a hint about where the future of the human race lies.<br /><br />Several of the best jokes in the film are inspired by the Charlie Chaplain film \\"[[ASIN:B004DHNQGQ The Great Dictator]]\\" which is openly referred to in \\"The Iron Sky.\\" There is also an obvious parody of the section of the film \\"[[ASIN:B001BHTN90 Downfall [Blu-ray]]]\\" which has inspired a thousand Youtube spoofs.<br /><br />The film sends up politicians in general, not just openly Nazi ones - partly by drawing attention to the parallels between the actions of world leaders in general and those of NSDAP leaders.<br /><br />I don't want to give away the jokes in the film, but another point to watch out for is that the viewer should watch closely, immediately after the President gives the name of the USA's space warship, for the way that name is written on the side of the ship.<br /><br />In more than one place in \\"The Iron Sky\\" there were things which would clearly have been a mistake or bad acting in a more serious film, but I wasn't sure whether the people who made this one were sending themselves up as a joke. For example, Gotz Otto, who plays the main Nazi character in the film, deputy fuhrer Klaus Adler, appears to have modelled his performance on the nazis from the UK TV show \\"Allo Allo\\" (Link: [[ASIN:B001B3LIQU 'Allo 'Allo! The Complete Collection]]) set in occupied France, particularly Herr Flick.<br /><br />Indeed, all the actors who play the Nazis from the moon in this film seem to have modelled their performances on characters from \\"Allo Allo.\\"<br /><br />The special effects are reasonably well done, though again I wasn't certain whether the film-makers had overlooked certain basic laws of physics orwere sending themselves up. one example would be spaceships which were converted Zeppelins. The example I gave in the first draft of this review, which has sparked a vigorous debate in the comments (see below) was that handguns which appear identical to WWII german luger pistols appear to work perfectly well on the moon - in extremely low temperatures, one sixth gravity, and the absence of an atmosphere. And with the recoil not affecting those who fire them in the moon's one sixth gravity any differently from how it would on earth. There are an amazing range of comments on this from people who probably know a lot more about guns than I do, though I'm not aware than any of the Apollo missions tested it by firing a gun on the moon. I had the impression that the creators of this film were not aiming at realistic depiction of the science of such issues, they were simply having a laugh.<br /><br />Whatever else you may say about it, this film is certainly different. There were points while watching it when I was quite literally rolling around laughing. There were other points when I was on the verge of getting up and turning it off. I suspect this will be one of those films which some people love and others hate.

B007UQ5Z1G|1.0|I love Linkin Park; they are one of the best and most talented bands around. However, this (Living Things) is there absolute worst album ever. The first 4 CD's were great, this one awful. I couldn't find one song that I really liked. They're trying to be to techno or something and it just sounds terrible.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|When I was a kid, I had a small collection of comic books that was predominantly Captain America issues. I began collecting comics when I was 5, and sort of fell out of it when I was around ten or eleven. My parents quit buying them, and, to be honest, the comic book medium has never engaged me as much as it has some of my friends. I do enjoy a graphic novel now and again, but in general, I don't go out of my way to read or read about them. But the movies? Oh, I go to the movies. I don't think I've missed a single Marvel Studios movie yet at the big screen, and generally, I haven't been disappointed.<br /><br />So I've been around to see Marvel Studios President Kevin Fiege and his companions weave the Avengers together with subtle references and post-credits teasers. It's been a long time coming, The Avengers, and it's a wonder that it ever happened at all. Considering that the last superhero movie I can think of that had more than one superhero and one super villain in it was X-Men 3: Rise of the Backlog References, I didn't expect it to ever happen again. But here we are, with Joss Whedon at the helm, Fiege as a producer, and an all-star cast including Robert Downey Jr, Samuel MF Jackson, Mark Ruffalo, Johnny Storm, Chris Hemsworth, and Scarlett Johansson. And despite having that much talent on screen, it almost always feels natural and indeed almost logical that these beautiful people would come together to kick the ass of some to-be-disclosed villain(s).<br /><br />Actually, that last bit of snarky was serious--the Avengers, Tony Stark tells his partner Pepper Pots in the first act of the movie, was an initiative of talented individuals put together by Fury and S.H.I.E.L.D. to protect the earth against super-powered threats. But it's dead. When the movie begins, the Avengers Initiative has been shut down by government leaders as a waste of time and a misguided program. Instead, S.H.I.E.L.D. has focused its efforts on the development of Hydra-based weapons ala the Captain America movie. But they've kept tabs on the Avengers themselves, so when Loki shows up after the Cosmic Cube stargates him out onto a dais, Fury can quickly assemble the team.<br /><br />The nature of Loki's plan is never very clearly developed--he will lead an alien army to Earth and let them run rampant, and then somehow become king of the Earth. This deal is shown in some shady scenes with \\"the Other,\\" who looks like something that stop-motion crawled out of a Guillermo Del Toro movie. They're interesting scenes, but astronomically don't make any sense, which bothered me. But that's OK. I don't think Loki really knew what was going on, either, and so when Thor pile-drives him into the ground and criticizes his lack of foresight, it makes total sense. Loki is the demented, anxious, and ambitious little brother/frost-giant adoptee of the God of Thunder. When would he have time to plan?<br /><br />In any case, while Loki traipses the world with the Cube and a mysterious scepter that allows him to project illusions, cast lighting, and brain-wash people, the Avengers assemble and chase him in an absolutely breathtaking rendition of the Helicarrier. While it's in the air, the Avengers are cooped up together, which makes for some great dialogue (and arguments), as well as a long lead-up to Ruffalo losing it and hulking out.<br /><br />I didn't think it would be true, but it turns out that Ruffalo might be the best hulk I've ever seen. Where Bana was a bit cross-eyed and pensive and Norton was too... Norton*, Ruffalo makes for an excellent banner with a handsome-but-real look, awkward, nerdy smiles and jokes that feel authentic, and a bit of a recovering-alcoholic air about him that totally begs to be messed with. This, of course, happens, by none other than Tony Stark. Throughout the first act, Stark shocks, pokes, prods, mocks, and teases Banner (to Captain America's ire) in an attempt to get him to \\"let the big guy out.\\" In fact, one of the movie's best lines comes out of this banter, when Stark says, \\"Bruce, you've been tip-toeing around all these years. I think it's time to strut,\\" which evokes some sultry and strange images of an eight foot green behemoth walking like Scarlett Johansson...<br /><br />... who does an incredible job as the Black Widow. Whedon opted to not play up her attributes, and let her act rather than show off.

The hulk/widow dynamic is perhaps my favorite scene in the film, and needs to be experienced on the big screen. It's incredible.

There's no excuse anymore.<br /><br />And no excuse not to see this movie. DO IT!es comes out of this banter, when Stark says, \\"Bruce, you've been tip-toeing around all these years.

B007UXSPK2|4.0|I am not a Mission Impossible fan. I was watching this with my husband as a birthday present, because he likes action movies way more than I do - and was shocked to find myself enjoying it. It has a plot you can follow, even though it's as implausible as all the other Impossible Missions I've seen, for some reason, I bought this one. The acting is superb across the board. Even the strong, aggressive woman wasn't overdone, as they usually are. And wonder of wonder, it even had a touching ending. Go Tom!
B005LAIHXQ|3.0|In a movie theater, everyone can hear you scream. In frustration.<br /><br />Prometheus is one of those movies you hear about whose pedigree alone is enough to get your blood pumping. Directed by Ridley Scott, the creator and director of the first Alien film, and set up as a self-contained and whole-new story parallel to the other Alien films, it had a lot going for it out of the gate. That also means it had high expectations to deliver on  from fans and critics alike. After all, Aliens was the first action film to win an Academy Award (citation needed). Sigourney Weaver, who played Lieutenant Ripley in the other movies, almost set up an archetype on her own. And let's not forget, the Alien films have had an unquantifiable influence on video games.<br /><br />There is a lot to be said for Prometheus. It had a remarkable production value, and a strong cast of talented actors. It had an excellent cannon mythology to draw from, and, of course, the adoration of millions. It is a shame then that so much went wrong to produce one of the series' more unforgettable entries.<br />Warning: Spoilers below. Proceed at your own caution.<br /><br />Let me begin with the good. The movie is remarkably well-shot, but then, we expect that from a Ridley Scott film. The cinematography is full of gorgeous landscapes that expand beyond the typical helicopter pans. The few shots in space are exceptional as well, ands of course, the dripping, dank corridors under the \\"pyramid\\" are happily reminiscent of the true-blooded Alien films. It's important to keep in mind that almost all of the indoor sets are \\"practical effects,\\" which is an impressive feat of its own.<br /><br />Scott uses an excellent design aesthetic to establish a brightly-colored and suitably neon futurist look. Underground, he sticks to what works: cramped, shadowy and uncomfortably organic halls and corridors that bend just enough that they might hide a monster behind them.<br /><br />But that's the problem with this movie. It isn't a creature feature. Instead of following the tried and true formula of unassuming blue collar people making a horrendous discovery,  fighting, and dying horribly to stop the alien from spreading, Prometheus tries to tell a creation story. Therefore, since we know that there are aliens, and from the opening scene we know what they look like, it gets weird. Indeed, the crew of Prometheus, the (titular) ship, are going to find them after discovering an identical array of stars on several ancient cave paintings. This is the first of the film's many drops of logic, as we learn from the founder of the film's nefarious Weyland Corporation, Peter Weyland (played, for some reason I can't fathom, by a badly-made up Guy Pearce) that the trip isn't a mining expedition, it's an archeological/contact mission!<br /><br />This, naturally, upsets the crew of geologists and miners, who are in disbelief. So are the viewers, who already knew it wasn't a mining expedition. Why are we wasting time with a seemingly pointless lie? Why were the miners tricked into coming along? Who are these two \\"biologists\\" spreading nonsense about humanity being \\"engineered\\"? In fact, one of the characters goes so far as to ask, \\"How do you explain three hundred years of Dawinian Evolution?\\"<br /><br />The answer is, you don't, as the film forgets that question like a toddler amped on sugar. But it's OK, because the unbeliever gets his faceplate melted onto his head by a cobra-like variant for the xenomorph. Serves him right for asking questions, no? F**k the scientific method.<br /><br />The inability to answer--and in some cases even remember--the questions Prometheus raises is the lynch-pin problem of the movie. As a film, it has a collective memory of about two minutes. For example, in the second act, after the engineers are officially \\"discovered,\\" one of the lead \\"scientists\\" descends into a juvenile, brooding drunken depression, because he didn't find any of the \\"engineers\\" alive. BUT THEY'VE ONLY BEEN ON LV-223 FOR A DAY. A SINGLE EARTH DAY. Likewise, when one of the crew is resurrected as a zombie (or something?) and kills a bunch of the unnamed blue collar maintenance dudes, the captain calmly destroys it, no one ever mentions it again, and that's that.<br /><br />This ignorant bliss plagues the movie from start to finish. In fact, Prometheus is one of those unfortunate films that really suffers from the loose-thread (or chin-scratching question-raising) problem: when you tug at one stray end, the entire carpet unravels. For some films, tugging one stray thread leads to a long and interesting discussion about technique, metaphor , or narrative. Not so here. This is hugely unfortunate, because the movie is ambitious. Scott and company were clearly trying to do something new with the source material,but they stepped too far and fell right on their plate glass helmets.<br /><br />Which reminds me: for some reason, the explorers have space suits that break and smash with the slightest impact. This doesn't make any sense, given that we have better technology right now. In fact, we have since the 1950s. But that is the unfortunate bad science that you have to swallow from Prometheus. Bad tech and nonsense science are as common as are the many unanswered questions. One last nerve-grating example: using an electric wand to \\"trick a two thousand year old corpse into thinking its alive,\\" thereby failing to properly observe standard and common quarantine rules the world over, and put the entire entire crew at risk. It's also just stupid.<br /><br />I could rant for a long time about the quarrels and qualms I had with this film, but its just a waste of breath. Ultimately, despite the stupid inconsistencies and errors, I did enjoy it. Mostly. I've never been a huge fan of Ridley Scott's films as narrative vehicles anyway: its his cinematic sense that catches me. They are strangely and startlingly beautiful pieces, each in their own way, that establish unique aesthetic grooves for the future of their respective genres. Take for instance the importance of the slick, oily, and cramped vision of LA in Blade Runner, and compare that to the sci-fi movies that followed. Compare Alien to the dozens of knock-off ET creature features; Gladiator to the dozens of Roman-inspired films. And as a movie, Prometheus is a visual masterpiece, one which I really hope that future sci-fi directors take a strong cue from in the visual department. The contrasting colors, the stark and grim caverns, and the obsessive attention to detail are wonderful. Watch it for that experience alone, but do not expect a follow-up (or lead-up, anyway) to Alien that matches the 1979 masterpiece for tone, vibe, or intelligence.<br /><br />And don't expect to have many questions answered, either. Also, to paraphrase a friend, future space-explorer underwear is incredibly boring. Shaw haw nothing on Ripley.Y'VE ONLY BEEN ON LV-223 FOR A DAY. A SINGLE EARTH DAY.

0307719219|5.0|We tend to believe that the People and the Land make up the Nation - and hence the ability of the people and the quality of the land whether it is the geography or the availability of natural resources that determines whether a Nation will succeed or fail. But in this well researched book the authors show that it is the nature of the political and economic institutions  which a nation creates that determines success or failure.<br /><br />Authoritarian political institutions and extractive economics institutions are recipes for failure. But why do some countries or even adjacent cities develop them while their neighbors get democracy and inclusive economic institutions? Small initial differences going back hundreds of years which divert nations in different directions, contingent events, calamities, great personalities all explain the destinies of nations.<br /><br />Covering countries from the West and the East, from Africa to Indonesia, from Australia to Antartica, the authors have a done a great job covering history, politics and economics and providing such insights that the book is a pleasure to read. There have never been a doubt that with free markets and equal opportunity, people from all backgrounds and nationalities can do well. For many decades we have seen immigrants from the world over get to the shores of the United States and do exceedingly well. But it had been difficult to understand why America developed they way it did while neighboring Mexico went down the other way. Or countries like China and India with ancient civilizations and colorful histories ended up being poor nations with millions on impoverished people. And why are they able to now rise back? And which model will succeed?  Read the book to find out - you will not regret the effort.<br /><br />I wish they can make this a compulsory read for all politicians......

B005FVNIW6|5.0|There's frankly no words left to say for this book. This is a modern masterpiece and a classic must read. Whether you are a science fiction fan or not, this book is a must read.<br /><br />The first time I bought this book was in 2007. Never read it, didn't even open it. Gave it to a friend (R.I.P.) and never took it back. Then, last month I decided to give it another try and boy did I kick myself for not reading it before. Ender's game delves deep into the psyche of man and OSC gives all of us a collective kick in the pants with the way the book shapes in the end. The characters evoke empathy, excitement, sympathy, anger, protectiveness and apathy and a range of emotions that are the mark of a good read. The story is tightly written, making it almost feel like the author never took his pen off the paper when he was writing the book. A definitive series and a 5 star rating is the least I can give for such a fantastic book.<br /><br />PLEASE READ THIS BOOK!
B007JMW46U|5.0|As I sat at my study I heard a knock at the door. There, to my surprise stood my dear friend, Sherlock Holmes. \\"May I come in, Watson? I have a puzzling problem that I need your help solving.\\" \\"Certainly,\\" I replied. Sherlock entered and began to tell me of his plight. He had been contacted by Strand magazine to record some of his most interesting cases. But having no writing skills was in a quandary as to whom to ask to tackle his momentious task. Of course I accepted the duty with great relish (and enjoyment, I must add). After the prodigious job was completed I queried, \\"Who will illustrate your work, my dear Sherlock?\\" \\"It's elementary, my dear Watson,\\" he exclaimed. \\"Only Sidney Padget is up to the task!\\"  And the rest is, as they say, history.
B000W965QW|4.0|When I first started reading High Fidelity, the first thing that struck me was that this is not the kind of book I normally read. This brought a little disappointment and made me hesitate about reading further. I even kept my kindle (,therefore the book,) down. When I picked it up again and started reading. I figured that this is exactly the kind of book I read. A well written, funny, involving and absorbing book.<br /><br />High Fidelity is equal parts funny and serious, tight and wayward, fiction and reality. It reminds you of people you know, people you could have been. Lets face it, we've all *almost* become a librarian or DVD store owner or even vinyl shop proprietor. I almost became a struggling musician. The book was equal parts what could have been and a very real depiction of how life can be for a couple.<br /><br />Highly recommended for those looking for a fun, fast, relaxed and absorbing read. Top notch work.

B007IXWKUK|4.0|I finally caved in and read 50 Shades of Gray because I wanted to see what all the hype was about.  About 25% in I was done for.  I told a close friend of mine that my overall reaction at that time was that the emperor had on no clothes and I really wish someone would get that old fat dude a robe.  But I kept reading since I'd already bought the damn book.  And in the end, the plot was nonexistent, Christian is an absurd character (a 27 year old billionaire???  Why on earth....), the writing (and I also have to blame the editing here) was unforgivable, but the sex was hot.  And often.  And that's why you read it.  Fine.<br /><br />While on my commute to work, I sat down next to another woman who was reading one of the later books, and saw a scene that definitely piqued my interest.  I probably would not have read book 2 otherwise.  But I did, and I must say it's better.<br /><br />In book 2, something happens that you would never expect - character development!!!  You get a better understanding of why Christian is the way he is.  Yes, there are still some holes in his background, and some things don't make sense, but somehow this self-proclaimed bad writer managed to make me connect to him.  Christian is severely damaged because of his past, and is learning, or trying to learn, better coping mechanisms.  Sure it's cheesy that this one random college graduate is better at helping him with this than his therapist.  Sure, the past seems a little overdone.  Sure, it sounds like his therapist isn't very good.  But in the end, he knows he's messed up and is trying to change.  And who among us can't relate to that?<br /><br />The best scenes for me are where Christian is allowing Ana to help him get over his biggest fears (I'm trying to write this without giving anything away).  Christian has a severe fear of X, and he let's Ana do X to him, even though it is brutally (emotionally) scary for him.  Somehow, this writer has really made you feel his pain, and his bravery in even allowing himself to go there.  Honestly, those few scenes might have made the book totally worth it for me.<br /><br />I don't know if the writing has improved or if I've just gotten used to it.  They still have way too much sex (I'm pretty sure they go at it 2-3 times a day. Every day! Really???)  There is still awkward language.  But, I can kind of understand one of the characters.  And that's enough.<br /><br />Pride wants me to give this 3.5 stars.  To say I \\"like\\" it is a pretty big jump.  But I'm feeling generous today!

0345803485|1.0|I have been an avid reader for 40 years or more and read every genre from romance novels to the classics. I can without any hesitation state that this is the worst book I have ever read in my life. I started off reading Harlequin Romances and blaxpoitation novels. All of them are works of art compared to this book I had high hopes for this book after hearing all the buzz but that should have been my first warning. I can not believe that anyone could write 3 books about such mealy mouthed dull characters. The constant holy craps and lip biting from the female character were enough to make me want to scream. I was only able to get through the first 100 pages before I had to stop. I have never read such a poorly written novel. I tried to read it as a comedy but the writing is so bad that it is not even funny. Whoever this author is, if she is a serious writer I don't know how she can hold her head up among her peers without being ashamed, unless her goal was to write the world's worst novel and fool millions into buying it. In that aspect she was a stunning success. I wish I could give this novel a negative 5 stars on the scale.
B0081L37Z0|1.0|Not worth your time or money, its a horrible movie!!! The only funny and good parts of it are on the pre-view..... its garbage, cheap dumb humor, JUST FOR LITTLE KIDS to watch so they can actually enjoy it and laugh!!!
B004GFN11A|3.0|The Wordpress App is good in a bind, but I wouldn't use it regularly to post.  New posts can be written in WYSIWYG, but when I go back to edit, I can only do  it in HTML.  Pages don't display like they do on other browsers.  How do I know what to edit if I don't know what it looks like?<br /><br />Other problems include a clunky interface and an inability to schedule posts.<br /><br />Some good points: I can easily jump between my blogs.  Site stats are minimal but easy to read.  The reader is quick and efficient at fetching new posts, much better than Firefox on my computer.  Still not enough of a draw for me.
B008COD5OO|1.0|Another dumb movie, it has like two good scenes, its just another one of those movies that you wish you could've just watch the preview which happens to have the only good parts of the movie, just for dumb kids to watch, i think directors should come with better scrips

B007J4T2G8|4.0|This book is a bit like a romance novel, however, the characters are complicated and well developed. But let's just be honest, it's what my twenty-two year old daughter has dubbed \\"Mommy Porn\\". It looks like a perfectly normal book, but it's all about sexual acts that are described in minute detail. I bet there are many grateful husbands and boyfriends out there. It's a fun read and I enjoyed it, but don't read it in public if you blush easily, because you will be beet red through most of the book.
B005HS00NW|3.0|I saw this band live at Moogfest 2011 and they were fantastic great! The sound was FAT! However this album sounds tepid in comparison.,, and the sound is a lot thinner. Also, there were 6 or seven people performing onstage but the credits on the album seem to credit just 2 people? so I guess I saw a touring band and the core band is 2 guys?  Insufficient data. Live, I loved the girl on the keyboards but she isn't even mentioned on the album. It's not a BAD album, just mediocre in comparison to the live show I saw. It could have been a really solid single disc rather than a double disc with a lot of filler tracks.... I tend not to trust bands that give so little information about the band and the music.
0679722610|5.0|Originally published in 1929, Red Harvest is a classic crime novel that helped established the hard-boiled genre. This is most definitely not a polite, parlor mystery where most of the blood is spilled off of the page. As the title suggests, this book is filled with mayhem and the bodies are falling left and right.<br /><br />The main protagonist is the Continental Op, who doesn't remotely resemble the genteel Hercule Poirot or any of the other fictional detectives who were so popular in the 1920s. The Op is certainly smart and skilled, but he's a squat, overweight man who's more than willing to cut whatever corners are necessary in order to achieve what he believes to be the greater good.<br /><br />The Op, who is employed by the Continental Detective Agency in San Francisco, is detailed to the Personville, a mining town known to most as Poisonville. The town was, for a long time, under the thumb of Elihu Willsson who owned the Personville Mining Corporation, the local newspapers, and a number of other businesses as well. He also controlled all of the politicians of any consequence, up to and including the state governor.<br /><br />During the First World War, Willsson had made whatever deals were necessary with the miners' unions to ensure that the company's operations were unimpeded. But once the war ended, he determined to break the unions and in doing so, invited in a number of thugs and crooks to assist him. The unions were effectively cowed, but the thugs and crooks stayed in town and carved out interests for themselves, effectively reducing Willsson's authority.<br /><br />As the book opens, Elihu's son, Donald, has asked the Continental Detective Agency for assistance. Elihu has now turned the town's newspapers over to his son and the son is something of a reformer. But before the Op can even meet with Donald, Donald is murdered. The Op believes that it is his obligation to identify the killer. As he attempts to do so, old Elihu Willsson offers the Op $10,000.00 to clean up Personville. In reality, he wants to get rid of the gangs that are competing for control of the town so that he can dominate it unchallenged once again.<br /><br />The Op is repulsed by the level of corruption in the town and by Elihu himself.

B003ZJUIGO|5.0|Whilst the two best additions are, in order, the DVD and the booklet to this classic collection of Deep purple songs/tunes, the mixes are palpably different. It is not clear if Paice was the arbiter of the collection in the 30th Anniversary edition, or if the EMI group did that job. Some elements that are very clear, is that I never knew that the solo in Speed King was a bass guitar solo ( I have heard guitar solos that sound like that, however, since the way Glover uses his bass differs in some songs such that it is more in the treble range, and closer to being the way Jon Lord Pushed the Hammond sound to be closer to Blackmores guitar sound , case in point, Black Night, and, HighWay Star etc).<br />The one thing I loved about this Collection was that it was almost totally a driving CD or Tape, collection that could go with other material that could get myself amped up to drive. I would definitely give this as an introduction to Deep Purple, and then let whom-ever select what they like from their. Whilst the albums have some separate superior cuts, the broad selection represented in DEEPEST PURPLE is brilliant. The sounds on the DVD for Burn is Awesome, if this is live, it looks great and sounds excellent. Hughes bass is brilliant. Probably the one difference in element that Glover seems to have at points with Hughes is that the bass for Glover is more for the Virtuoso side of what he did, whilst Hughes did something different, not a bad thing, but still a different side of what Mach 3 and 4 did. I also suspect that a contributing factor in the anniversary issues is that the discs are made in the EU. Outside of Japanese pressings, the German re-issues ( if these are german re-issues for the discs) are far superior to the discs made elsewhere, and I have deliberately sought out EU versions. I would recommend the same, since if you decide to start collecting the albums after hearing DEEPEST PURPLE 30th Anniversary, you will hear the influence of Glover and others inthe albums.<br />I avoided the track by track comments since it makes more sense in the album versions: Jon Lords comments speak for themselves, and as one of 3 who made it through all versions of the band, it seems better for him to have the word on the collection, but the most unusual part of the Deep Purple history I hear little of is the So called \\"Scandinavian Nights leg of the tour with the tour touted as the last work of Mach 3; Its an interesting work since I don't know exactly what the role of who was in this transition from mach3 to mach 4.
B00881VLCE|2.0|I loved this app.It was so much fun, I played it all the time. Then I got an update and now it is horrible. Now I can only rotate pieces in one corner, and that gets reallyconfusing when the edge is already put tohether. If you don't hit it just right the whole puzzel turns. The pieces don't stay where you put them,  they jump around when you &quot;let go&quot; of them, usually covering up other pieces. Before you could have the picture displayed while you work, now it freezes the pieces until you close the picture. I have had to re-download twice since getting upgrade because it stops working. A few times I didn't even get all the edge pieces. As I said loved it before, but now it has too many glitches and it is not fun anymore. Please fix and I will go back to being a very loyal fan.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|when I go to church this is what I use on my kindle fire it helps cause it is better to find stuff then looking in a book
0345803485|1.0|The most significant reaction I have to this book, and its popularity, is crushing disappointment. Primarily, disappointment that our society is so ill-read at this point, and so borderline illiterate, that people are swooning over this \\"amazing\\" book. I read this \\"#1 Bestseller\\" waiting to get to the \\"amazing\\" part. Unfortunately I got to the last page without ever encountering anything palatable whatsoever.<br /><br />This book should be used in writing courses at the high school and community college level. When students ask how to develop great characters, how to develop an intriguing and well-paced plot, and how to build a reader's interest and investment, their instructors should simply throw this paperback at them and advise, \\"Not like this.\\"<br /><br />Terrible book, an insult to good writing, and a sad statement as to what qualifies as a \\"page-turner.\\"
B004GYNPL2|5.0|Best part is sync and share....this is perfect... I have so many passwords and this app manages all of them
1400049628|4.0|Very interesting and funny to read. As you read this book you almost believe there is a zombie epidemic that is out there, that we the people, are kept in the dark about. Stock up your supplies.
B000006UD8|5.0|Wall to wall this is a great work.The amount of light and shade that comes out on the tracks is superb, and if you can use a 5.1 playback, then this becomes abundantly clear on the last 2 tracks of disc 2. The first disc with Rogers inclusion of studio sound, and not fading out the material is great, makes you feel very there. There are of course the songs that are well known,1, 5 and 7. The remaster on disc 2 is great. The versions of \\"when a Blind man cries\\" is very evocative and indicative of the skill the band has in tone and variation. Make sure you listen  to tracks 9 and 10 on disc 2 in a 5.1 system since the spatial variation is superb. This also goes for the whole 2 discs, but more so for disc 2 with the tracks mixed in quad. I upped the sound on all playback and the bass becomes more prevalent, but only to a relative degree.<br />  Outside of the discs, the real love and care in the history of the band at the time, and the notes by Roger Glover  is superb. Signing , as he does \\"a fan\\", it is very clear he is , since he lets the other fans in on the production and its well worth the disc. In this double disc in particular, they do not skimp, and it is well worth it, even with headphone, or earbuds, but you get the most on a  open sound system where the mix and master is just made for the listening.<br />Totally brilliant album, CD ,and superb care with the work.
B0058P7KUA|5.0|1ghz phone needed for good performance, big app but tons of fun. Teen humor, good controls, creative levels and will stay on my phone until I upgrade. Kudos to the Devs!
B000O8OTNC|1.0|Tried this on some older pocket knives, some dull, some with nic's in the blades.<br /><br />This 'sharpener' did not restore an edge, or fix any damage. If anything...it made them worse... (was used correctly, per instruction on package)<br /><br />Can't say much about the diamond rod either. It's there, it rubs the metal.<br /><br />If you need something to sharpen, just get a cheap stone. They can be found for under 15...and they work. I wouldn't even say this is worth throwing in a bug out bag.
B006H8BIIM|1.0|Pay for the game to be granted the privilege of paying for upgrades once I start playing. No thanks you can keep this one.
B000641D2Y|2.0|Pure uninspired slapstick. The \\"bad guys\\" get hurt over and over again. If you want to teach your kid to have no compassion for other people, this movie will help you do it.
B006H8BIIM|1.0|I don't mind in-app purchasing, but only if the app is free. A paid app should cover the costs, you shouldn't have to pay twice, that is complete greed. And for those who say that the in-app purchasing is optional, get real. You either pay for the upgrades that you need or grind (read - not fun) for a good THIRTY hours just to be able to continue the game. Completely unacceptable.
B006LSZECO|2.0|Whew - what a relief that's done. This book's premise is very clever, plotting pretty good, writing and phrasing really good although there are a number of grammatical errors a good editor should have caught. What was really awful was that I couldn't get an iota of interest in any of the characters, the most likeable of which was dead. Amy's dead? who cares? Nick did it? so what? There needs to be a sympathetic character somewhere for fiction to work and this book failed miserably in that regard.
B00785P2QC|5.0|I like it. It is a very good game when u r bored and have nothing to do. Would recommend it
B0054JZC6E|3.0|This game is ok if your looking for something to do but, after a while it gets boring. in this game you play mini games and collect point. once you've collected enough points, then you buy more mini games. I guess what I'm trying to is that, this game gets boring. It's. not really worth buying.
B007KAJG3K|1.0|the first sherlock holmes is my opinion a fantastic movie...if you expect to find something similar..stop dreaming'...nothing you can compare...talkin'.. talking' in old fashioned english british style ...poor action..a real pain..
B0050PYNO4|5.0|First off, it looks great.  The bigger thing is that this is a wonderful movie. I loved Simon Pegg and Nick Frost in SHAUN OF THE DEAD but I love this movie more.  It looks great on Blu Ray and has an alternate cut -- whose differences are in early scenes -- but the story is the thing and it is a really fun movie.  I am not crazy about Seth Rogen but as PAUL he rocks.  So many good actors in this.  I saw this on HBO and knew I had to own it.  Extras about the movie are really interesting. Hey, an Alien with three tits -- you have to see the movie to know what I am talking about -- \\"awesome\\".  If you love Simon Pegg, Nick Frost movies ( SHAUN OF THE DEAD, HOT FUZZ) YOU WILL LOVE THIS!  You just have to kinda trust me on this one. Others will go into spoilers  -- like you wanted to know the whole damned story before you got to see it.  I refuse to do that.  This one is worth your time and a keeper.
B000SEGMBO|5.0|This is a really good book. If you are interested in know how to write better code in C++ you must read this book.
B0086700CM|4.0|this game is berg amazing it is the most fin hale ive ever played an Im thankful that who ever made it did or I wouldn't know what to do without it.
030758836X|5.0|I'm an avid mystery/thriller reader, and I have to say that this book was PHENOMENAL. I've only felt compelled to review maybe 1 or 2 other books.  I read it in about 2 days, it was so well written.  A well deserved 5 stars.
B005LAIHXQ|4.0|I saw the movie in the theatre and came away with mixed emotions. It is in essence a prequel for the Aliens franchise. In that regard I would rank it third in the series behind the original Alien and the follow up Aliens, but ahead of Alien 3.<br />The production quality is strong, though I'm not a fan of 3D. At this time I still find it clumsy and clunky to always have to wear the glasses and readjust them on my face through out a movie. I look forward to the eventual day when 3D movies will be viewed without glasses at all. Till then, I'd just as soon stick with 2D.<br />The directions is generally good and the charactors and acting is good. The story however has a few holes and as always some of the charactors do the dumbest things you can imagine when faced with life threatening situations. You'd think they'd have more sense - but of course if they weren't that stupid, they wouldn't get killed in the first place and the movie would lose much of it's pop.<br />I liked the \\"origin\\" aspect and the exestential questions the movie asks, very good.<br />I take one star away for the writting of some of the charactors parts and their actions/reactions in certain scenes.<br />I will buy the DVD/Blue Ray, and will of course watch it again at home of the wide screen. 4 Stars, could have been 5 but needed the script to be tighter.
B00881VLCE|5.0|Vivid puzzles in every area you can imagine. I love the nature ones and the ones of different countries and cites. also a good time passer
B006R8GK2Q|4.0|It a well done game and I enjoy playing it to pass time. The story for it really makes it fun.
1400069289|3.0|This book is very disappointing.  There is good information but not enough to fill a book.  An article would have been better.  Only the last chapter attempts to pull things together; however, he does a poor job.  The author spent too much time on too many anecdotes and each anecdote.  He dwelt too long on each story ...to the extent that I often wondered what the anecdote had to do with the topic, \\"habits.\\"  The author is a good story teller and should consider a fiction; however, this is a non-fiction. If you can find a summary of this book that is a better way to go.
0425241505|4.0|The two main characters, Dragos and Pia, have a lot of chemistry together which results in some very witty, silly, snarky and tender dialogues. Dragos and Pia are complete opposites, down to him being a strict carnivore and her being 100% vegan, It was a little bit difficult for me to believe that Dragos, who was created at the beginning of civilization and so worldly, sophisticated, intelligent, wealthy and powerful could truly find someone of Pia's age and experience interesting much less his soul mate, but Harrison manages to beautifully pull it off. There is the requisite \\"bad guy\\" which adds some, but not a whole lot, of action to the story line as well as the usual details that are needed in order to build the groundwork for a new series. Overall, it is a very simple and enjoyable read about two very different people in a new relationship.
B007XF0X6G|1.0|I buy movies with digital copies intentionally and even though I'm not a big UltraViolet fan, I can still download the movies and watch on my many trips away from home when I don't always have internet to stream.  Flixster's website has given me problems redeeming the code for this and upon sending a \\"help ticket\\" asking for an iTunes compatible version because of website problems, I was simply told that WB Flixster will only do UltraViolet on this movie.<br /><br />They did not resolve the problem in the way I had asked and hoped for but more problematic is that they did not even comment on the actual problem of their website not allowing me to redeem the movie in the first place.  Disappointing outcome from WB and Flixster, especially after Clash of the Titans was a Mac and WIndows compatible download.<br /><br />AS for the movie, it's not great and the first was better but it really depends on what you like.  I was only wanting some good special effects and action sequences so plot was not as important for this particular movie.
B008ASLK8A|5.0|I'm a big Sherlock Holmes fan and have collected most all versions, both feature films and made for TV that have been produced. The Robert Downey franchise is entertaining and enjoyable. Script is tight, though not as humorous as the first film. Moriarty is well depicted and quite well played. The relationship between Holmes and Watson is equally well defined and a treat to watch. Due to the ending of this adventure I'm wondering what the future of the franchise will be? I'd love to see a 3rd and 4th film based around other classic Holmes stories.
B000HA4WTI|3.0|I loved the car scenes (I mean, who doesn't, it's what the series is about!) & I am personally a huge fan of drifting. This movie could have been a lot better as far as the actor's. It felt very forced & fake to me...  All in all a good movie though. The drama is good =D And Han :( Well I wont spoil it for those going to watch it but I really liked him in this.
B006R8GK2Q|4.0|Yes it does want you to log into Facebook but I canceled the posts as to not spam my page, no problem.  The details aren't so accurate like another reviewer stated about calling something different than it was. YES the searches for the transparent items were difficult because they're transparent &amp; some items shadings were bad to start with making me click the wrong things but I had tons of hints that I found along the way &amp; still had like 80 at the end so its very possible to beat.  The last 2 wire games were impossible for me to beat but thankfully I could skip them.  It did start to feel too repetative &amp; the story line was stupid but I like the search games &amp; this did keep me occupied but it was the FAOTD I wouldn't pay $5 for it PERIOD!  $1.99 tops is it.

B000FC0OOU|5.0|Ernest Hemingway does not write inferior books. Having just read a book concerning the Spanish Civil War, I was interested in learning his outlook as he was present in Spain at that time. He was also able to give some insight into the lives of some, (real or imaginary), participants in the conflict. It is an enjoyable book, and one that is easily read.
B006MVJ2L4|5.0|It was perfect.<br /><br />I love Adam Lambert and the cd was so brand new, on perfect condition.<br /><br />I recommend this.
B00782O7IY|5.0|I liked this film a lot. It was very refreshing to find a modern film unafraid to turn back the clock and embrace \\"silent cinema\\" and black and white media.  The story itself is good and the acting is fine and entertaining. It's great to see some originality instead of another knock off movie treatment of some outdated TV show or remake of a good movie that should never be remade. Hollywood lacks originality usually and I applaud fresh ideas and concepts even when they're turning back the clock. Great job, great film.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This is a great game.I love it.I play it on my kindle fire every day.Its good cause its a variety. of choices to chose from.

0307887960|5.0|After many years of dieting, walking, aerobics and yo-yo eating I decided to try the Dukan Diet.  My doctor has been after me to loose weight, borderline everything, for years.<br />I have worked in a stressful job for 35 years and found myself consuming sugar constantly.  40-50 pounds later I could not move well, and experienced depression.<br />I have followed  many diet books,  joined gyms for a while and group meetings.  I could never loose more than 5 pounds.  I would become disinterested and start eating again.<br /><br />I bought both the Dukan Diet Book and Dukan Cookbook from Amazon.  The food is easy to obtain,  you can  eat as often as you want  and if you follow the diet and consume  1/2<br />gallon of liquid a day you will watch your body change.  I lost 10 pounds in the first 3 weeks.  I am now on the second stage of rotating complete protein days with protein-veg<br />days.  I feel very comfortable on this plan, much  happier,  clearer thinking and I don't constantly think about  making cookies and brownies after work.  I have retired and am<br />serious about loosing the weight.  A year ago I experienced chest and back pains and I was told in the ER to loose 10  percent of my weight soon  or  I would most likely experience<br />a full heart attack. I did not have a choice.  I had to find the answer for me.
B0086700CM|5.0|simple yet fun and addictive and not overly challenging or difficult.  This is one of the few games I can keep coming back to over and over on my Kindle Fire. Thanks!
B000H1RFKU|5.0|4.6 stars<br /><br />Having seen this a half dozen times over the last decade, it just keeps getting better, entirely due to Washington's dead-on turn as the nastiest villain around, who just happens to be a cop. What are the odds?<br /><br />Hawke is decent and a solid foil, but this one is all Denzel all the time. His diner scene is so amazingly edgy, and funny in all the wrong ways, as are so many others here. He sells this guy to perfection, or whatever the opposite of that is. Along with a fine script that's all too believable, and some tight direction, he takes this flick into places few Hollywood movies dare go. Hawke's Serpico Jr. is at his best in the kitchen/bathtub scene, a true classic; those are some good bad guys, ese.<br /><br />The blu-ray features a good transfer and a nice little doc on the film as well as 12 minutes of occasionally great deleted scenes, a few of which should have stayed in the movie, the beer scene especially. Also included is a crisp commentary by director Fuqua that answers lots of questions, and poses a few more.<br /><br />The only niggles in Training Day are a few weak continuity moments, like the three bullet holes in the back window. So where'd they exit? They all missed the two guysin front, and also didn't go out the front window after leaving one inch entry holes? In a film this real-feeling, stuff like that dulls the edge. But just a bit.<br /><br />Denzel is a great good guy, we all know that. But here he's also one of cinema's best bad guys. And while we all want Luke to win, let's face it: Darth is more fun to watch!
B00881VLCE|3.0|its fun when it works it freezes up from time to time but when its working I have loads of with it.
B008ASLK8A|4.0|I will agree with any amount of praise that gets heaped on this film on the subject of:<br /><br />(a) Robert Downey Junior and Jude Law as a fantastic Holmes & Watson. Their performances in both the first and second film are sometimes jaw-droppingly good, with Sherlock as damaged as he is brilliant and Watson his tough but personally insightful anchor to humanity.<br /><br />(b) Cinematography and style. Although my son sat next to me looking up inventions and weapons on his iphone through the whole film crying \\"anachronistic\\" I thought the sets, costumes, and props all combined into a very slightly steampunk Victorian Europe that's just huge fun.<br /><br />(c) Music - love the music and special effects.<br /><br />What brought this film down to 4 stars for me is that it has almost no plot at all, and what little there is is painfully silly. We follow H&W around England, France, Germany, & Switzerland with almost NO idea what they're doing or why (though things are explained after the fact in flashback) - and once we do know, I found it very hard to see why H&W were important to...well, anything except the audience...and the nudge nudge are they or aren't they a couple byplay felt a little too over the top.<br /><br />Good fun, but disappointing that they didn't work a little harder to make the story interesting.

B005LAIGWS|1.0|I first want to say that when I saw the trailer for the Ghost Rider, I had no idea it was a comic book series. I'm not into comic books by any means, but I do love Marvel and DC movies. For the most part, they're well produced and packed with action. The greatest comic based movies are the ones in which the main character first discovers or receives his or her powers (Ghost Rider, Iron Man, etc). I love the often comedic, awkward transition from regular, every day person to super human.<br /><br />I'm a huge fan of heavy metal music, and you'll usually find me adorned with skulls in one way or another, and I have a motorcycle, so naturally, I was pumped to see a movie about a flaming skeleton who rode a sick, flaming motorcycle, and hunted demons. The first Ghost Rider movie grossly exceeded my expectations. I loved every minute of it, and I've nearly worn out my blu-ray copy of it. I didn't get a chance to see Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance in theaters, but when it came out on blu-ray, I bought a copy believing that it would be just as enjoyable, for me, as the first one was. Only a few minutes in, I knew it was going to be horrible, and after suffering through the entire movie I felt compelled to read some reviews to see what other people thought.<br /><br />Apparently Ghost Rider was a comic book series from the 70's (I was born in 1985), and Spirit of Vengeance closely followed the story line presented in those comics, so the people who are really into those comic books hated Ghost Rider and loved Spirit of Vengeance. As I mentioned before, I wasn't aware it was a comic book series, so whether or not the movie followed that series was of no matter to me.<br /><br />Right off the bat, Spirit of Vengeance brings it's viewers up to speed on the Ghost Rider story in a wannabe-Tarantino style, but instead of using cut scenes from the first movie, they reenacted scenes from Ghost Rider using different actors, in different situations. As I watched I found myself saying, \\"Wait, that's not how it happend...\\" The movie goes through a few major plot points of Ghost Rider, then tells another story of how he changed how he felt about being the Ghost Rider, then tells the story about how he \\"fled to Europe,\\" all in the opening two minutes. As the movie begins, we find a completely changed Ghost Rider character, with a different bike, a different outfit (what happened to the \\"nice jacket?\\"), in a different country, and with a different outlook on life. And when Nicholas Cage changes into the Ghost Rider, the skull is different, the flames are different, the bike doesn't change much (except for some flames coming out of it in a few places), and he's basically wearing charred, black leather pants and a charred, black leather jacket. Already, the awesomeness of the character has been reduced to nothing special. And now, anything he rides changes into a \\"Ghost vehicle\\" that he can wield however he pleases.<br /><br />These are all minor points, nit picking I suppose, but overall the movie was just horrible. The acting was terrible, the plot was ridiculous, the characters were never properly introduced, I could go on and on. It may sound like no big deal when I say the Ghost Rider's appearance was different, but imagine if you watched Iron Man, as it is, then watched Iron Man 2 to find that Robert Downy Jr. wore a green suit and never mentioned any sort of reason for the change. After reading the reviews of this movie, I can say one thing for sure. If you loved the comic book series, and hated Ghost Rider for being so apart from the comics, you'll probably like this movie. If you loved Ghost Rider, however, I can almost guarantee you'll hate Spirit of Vengeance. It's not Ghost Rider 2 by any means. It's someone else's idea of how the Ghost Rider comic book series should've been portrayed in a movie.

As is the case with many SF novels reflects environmental dilemmas. Highly recommend.

B007J4T2G8|4.0|If you are looking for a sex packed book, look no further. I did find it annoying that Ana would search her \\"inner goddess\\" continuously throughout the book, but honestly that's not what most readers are looking for anyway.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I finished \\"50 shades of lame\\" as I like to say yesterday evening. I decided to read this book after several co-workers suggested it to me. I should have known something wasn't right since one girl has been single for over twenty years and the other was in a horrible marriage.<br /><br />No matter, I plunged into the book. I was interested in this Christian Grey character when he was just a millionaire business man. But, when the author added, he could pilot a helicopter, play piano, have sex three times in a row, says all the right things, buys his new \\"girlfriend\\" an Audi, a Macbook and a Blackberry I lost it!<br />I REALLY lost it when Mr. Grey decided to track Ana's period and set an alarm on his Blackberry to remind HER to take her birth control pill. Mind you this was after the forever thoughtful Grey set up a private gyno visit at his residence for Ana.<br /><br />I became confused while reading this book. One minute the author is writing about what every tween would find desirable in a boyfriend. The constant e-mails, the texts, the arriving at your house late at night, \\"just to stop by\\" and randomly showing up at your folks house across the country while home for a visit (let's admit as the author repeats over and over, Mr. Grey is a stalker)... then one paragraph later the author was discussing extreme sexual acts (that which by the way never happended). Was this erotica or Twilight?<br /><br />I skimmed over the last 40 pages as I caught on to the plot early on. However, I stupidly  kept waiting for something good to happen, but the same crap was written over and over.<br /><br />Here's the plot in just a few sentences...A virgin girl having sex with an semi-older highly sexual man. Mr. Grey initially wanted Ana to be his submissive and subject herself to a \\"playroom\\" full of whips, chains and the like. However, Mr. Grey falls for Ana and decides he can \\"try\\" to be more than a dominant lover. **Spoileer** And in the end (ready..) a newly deflowered virgindecides being whipped and beat isn't her idea of a good relationship?! What a surprise. How two more books are written about such a lame couple I have no idea.<br /><br />Overall this was just awful!! I am not sure what the hype was all about. There were two well written sex scenes,(but if you've had sex it wasn't anything to get excited about) but that's about it.<br /><br />If you are interested in reliving your childhood desires for the perfect boyfriend or are a Twilight fan, then this is the book for you. If not, I would steer clear of \\"50 shades of Lame\\".

B0086700CM|3.0|Fun but I lose all my progress with every update.  Game is too fast for the  processor on my  LG Revolution.  That makes it unresponsive at times, which is annoying.
B004BLJQOK|5.0|TO ME THIS MOVIE HAVE A LITTLE OF EVERYTHING YOU CAN WANT,THRILL'S,SYMPATHY,COMPASSION,HORROR AND EVEN LOVE ALL WRAP IN THIS GEM OF A MOVIE. GREAT SERVICE FROM SELLER AND FAST TRANSACTION, WILL BUY FROM SELLER AGAIN.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|I don't write reviews very often but this book deserves it. Most books below 7.99 are kind of hit and miss, and usually if they are good, they are not great. This book though, amazing.  I am no literary critic so I can not break down all the points that make this book grreat but I will definately buy the next installment.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I just wish it gave you more points when you win the games instead of playing the same one over and over again
0062060562|3.0|Read it this weekend. Not *the best book ever* but kept my interest and could easily jump in an out of it.
1932907009|5.0|Based on the cover I purchased this book expecting an adventure about a wacky cat and his family attempting to get him back in time for Christmas.  Instead this is a book on screenwriting.  I should probably ready the product summaries more often.
B001C08RHA|4.0|We think that this movie was exciting, it has realy cool computors stuff. The suit that he started out with was pretty cool at first but when he came up with the new suit, it really was hi-tec and cooler than cool. the excitment in this movie was way better then part two. That's my opinion anyways, so buy it and check it out for yourself.  Michael
6304493681|4.0|its the original dvd, with only one extra clip about the original release that happened in theaters. I wasnt impressed with the extras at all, but you dont order this one for the extras. You order it for the movie. The movie as always is great.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|fun time waster. since it's free I don't mind the ads but I docked a star because sometimes the ads pop up in the middle of a game.
B007DIQC90|5.0|I was really smitten with \\"Little Talks\\" as soon as I heard it on the radio, so I gambled on this album, and it paid off. The song-writing is excellent: catchy, intriguing, and occasionally a touch heartbreaking. The lyrics are fun and quirky, even when they're dealing with themes of mental anguish and unrequited love. Plus, I adore her lilting Icelandic accent. Love this album!
B006H8BIIM|1.0|I don't even care how good or bad the game is. A developer who is greedy enough to keep charging for regular game play and has no shame adding fake 5-star reviews, shouldn't be supported. Just say no.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|Had a blast playing this.  Need more games like this!  Breaks up the monotony of the day!  Love to play at work!
B004LWZW4M|5.0|We thought the movie was very well acted, has you thinking that people are not so great. Athoritise not so kind when it comes to animals, it makes you feel sad, happy & maybe even think about being nicer to animals of all kinds. Even be more thoughtful of your parents if sick... Michael
B004W4N55C|5.0|App is great, but ever since my phone got updated to ICS, i open it, goes from app to homescreen a couple times then closes completely.
1400069289|4.0|There is an obvious connection between the right habits and success .We have come a long way from what has been said about habits in the autobiography of Benjamin Franklin .But many questions remain.Why some people  people change their\\" bad \\"habits while others fail to do so?Why we want to fall for temptations and do wrong things?Why are our desires disordered?What is the relationship between habits and mindsets?How habits are important tools for change at individual , corporate and societal levels?What is the role of will power in changing habits?What is the relationship of will power with neurology?Is there something in the  working of our brains which does not let our will power prevail over habits?How beliefs are created and what is the role of beliefs in habit creation and change?Do we believe in a free will?<br />  I read my first book on habits called  \\"Seven Habits of highly effective people\\"by Stephen Covey  (which has sold  more than 25 million copies worldwide since its first publication in 1989)  for the  first time in 1994,  then in 2003 and again  in 2007.It is one of the best  self help books on habits.But it suffers from two major omissions:<br />1.It fails to mention the role of emotions and emotional intelligence in  life.<br />2.It does not tell how to create  desired  habits in oneself  , in order to be effective .It is one thing to know what the seven habits of highly effective people are .  It is quite another to create these habits in self .This makes the book less practical  .Ever since my first reading of this book , I was on the look out of a book  , which could tell  the process of creating and retaining new habits , and  to eradicate the undesirable habits .<br />  Recently I came across  \\"The Power of Habit. . .Why we do what we do in life and business\\" by Charles Duhigg , a book published in 2012, and I decided to read it to find answer to the  questions  which Covey left unanswered in his book and some of the above questions regarding habits  which came up in my mind from time to time .This book  is a page turner and a riveting read .Duhigg has an interesting style of telling stories.I read this book of 372 pages  in  about ten hours .Duhigg is a reporter for New York Times , and the book has an obvious journalistic style .It is not a book written by an expert on applied  psychology or neurology.It is an entertaining and breezy reading .It succeeds in  sensitizing us about  the way we look at our actions , routines , habits and mindsets .It  has opened up several aspects of habits which I did not know .It describes the habits of individuals , of successful organizations and of societies as also the neurology of free will .<br />  Some Habits can emerge without our permission and continue.We can also create new habits by putting together a cue/trigger/spark / craving , a routine and a reward(The Habit Loop).Duhigg  says that we cannot extinguish or eradicate a bad habit . we can only change/replace it with a new habit.He says that old habits don't die.Even if we change our habits , old habits still exist in the neural pathways of our  brain but remain dormant to new habit .\\"If you want to change a habit, you must find an alternative routine and your odds of success go up automatically when you commit to changing as a part of a group.Belief is essential and it grows out of  a communal experience, even if that community is only as large as two people.\\"He gives the example of how people with certain brain damage could still perform certain tasks through the power of habits<br />  But my personal experiences contradict what Duhigg says .Golden Rule of habit change i.e. substitution is not true , at least not always true.I was a \\"chain smoker\\" for about 20 years  from 1973 to 1993 .I decided to give up smoking cigarettes on march 13, 1993 .At the time of giving up , I was smoking , on an average , forty cigarettes a day .Here is how I gave up the smoking :<br />1.A  doctor friend of mine asked me to get X rays of the chest taken .X-rays report indicated some affected portion of the lungs .It was a warning signal of breathing difficulties in future .<br />2.I began to visualize smoking as equivalent of consuming  poisonous gases , and committing slow suicide .I had started this visualization for about a month before I actually gave up .<br />3.I decided to kill the desire to smoke , focusing on very little pleasure it was giving and looking at it as a self imposed habit deserving to be eradicated .I reflected on this daily for about a month before the day of actual quitting .This was reinforced by my recitation of a stanza from Bhagwat Geeta relating to the killing of desires.<br />4.I had realized that reducing smoking by degrees , by reducing the number of cigarettes smoked daily , will not work .I had tried it earlier and failed.The habit had to be killed in one go .<br />I must share that there were no with drawl symptoms , no craving for a substitute , no looking back .It is now more than 19 years and I think , my habit of smoking is extinguished .This is contrary to what \\"science of habit\\" cited by Duhigg have us to believe .<br />  The first major premise of Duhigg that you can can  change an old habit only by substituting it by a new one , is not really born out by my experience , and I am inclined to disagree with ,notwithstanding the evidence that neural pathways of old habit remain in the brain .<br /><br />  Duhigg analyses  the 12 steps of Alcoholics Anonymous  as a\\" group therapy\\".The 12 steps of AA are as below(for convenience):<br />  The 12 Steps<br />  Step1- We admitted we were powerless over our addiction - that our lives  had become unmanageable<br />Step2- Came to believe that a Power greater than ourselves could restore us to sanity<br />Step3- Made a decision to turn our will and our lives over to the care of God as we understood God<br />Step4- Made a searching and fearless moral inventory of ourselves<br />Step5- Admitted to God, to ourselves and to another human being the exact nature of our wrongs<br />Step6- Were entirely ready to have God remove all these defects of character<br />Step7- Humbly asked God to remove our shortcomings<br />Step8- Made a list of all persons we had harmed, and became willing to make amends to them all<br />Step9- Made direct amends to such people wherever possible, except when to do so would injure them or others<br />Step10- Continued to take personal inventory and when we were wrong promptly admitted it<br />Step11- Sought through prayer and meditation to improve our conscious contact with God as we understood God, praying only for knowledge of God's will for us and the power to carry that out<br />Step12- Having had a spiritual awakening as the result of these steps, we tried to carry this message to other addicts, and to practice these principles in all our affairs.<br />  Duhigg recounts how when researchers asked recovering alcoholics what made their new habits take hold so that they were able to stay sober even under the direst of circumstances, their answer was always the same :God.It reflects the view that humans are material and spiritual beings.Reject the latter and you end up treating men and women  in controlled experiments the way you treat mice .But being subjects and not only objects,  humans have their own idea of what is going on inside them .Duhigg and the researchers that he quotes tweak the spiritual out and replace it with belief in them selves.While AA seems alcoholism as  a three fold \\"disease\\" physical , mental and spiritual , Duhigg admits to the first two .\\"A system of meetings and companionship that strives to offer as much escape, distraction and catharsis as a Friday night bender.\\" On the other hand , in AA philosophy ,\\"Not Drinking\\" is only first in AA in a process leading to \\"Spiritual awakening\\".<br /><br />While step 3 deals with will , the step 4 deals with making a moral inventory of them selves.It is not only the circumstantial habits o surrounding their drinking but character and emotional habits that cause the harm that they  do to them selves and to others.In step 5 , alcoholics  admit their  wrongs and develop exterior habits of self examination and admission of wrongs to other human beings  .At the same time , they  acquire interior habits or character traits such as  honesty , humility and forgiveness.They proceed from spiritual awakening which transforms the prescriptions and concerns which drive our old habits .They  try to practice these new habits daily in all they  do and through repeated action, the traits are generally ingrained in their minds and brains and develop into habitual dispositions .Right thinking , right feeling and right action slowly become second nature to them .This is the understanding of the habit formation that underlies the 12 steps of AA and is distilled in the phrase\\"practice these principles.\\"<br /> AA is  nurturing such a fruitful tradition of coperation between science , religion and the spiritual , a tradition Chrles Duhigg has chosen not to follow.Duhigg tries to fit 12 steps of AA by bending them out of shape  so that they will fit into his \\"habit loop\\" scheme of Cue , routine and reward.<br />  The mind can shape the brain , and modify behaviour, habits included.  The book  describes the biology of habit but leaves out morality and spirituality of habits , ostensibly in the name of science.It goes into the moral consequences of our habits but avoids going into the moral , emotional and spiritual origins of our habits .It says that we need to have beliefs but does not say what we are supposed to believe in.Is it God or power of visualization?It describes how habits work on and shape us and also how we shape our habits .It is in shaping of habits that we get  an unclear and somewhat incomplete picture.It also talks very little about habit shaping skills .Excluding morality and spirituality in the name of science , is the second major weakness of the Duhigg's book.<br />  If you want to realize the vision you desire for your self ,you need to create habits to match your vision .The idea of keeping a journal of one's keystone habits helps keep one mindful of the source of one's actions.The power of goal setting  by simply writing things down is demonstrated.<br />  Habits play an important role in changing the culture of an organization .Duhigg gives an example of Star bucks habits.The book then goes on to describe how habits are responsible for the social movements , like the Montgomery Bus Boycott movement led by Rosa Parks.While it is difficult to fully agree that social movements are caused by habits , it may be relevant to concede some role for habits in mass movements.In order to really take hold and spread, the movement must be  guided by an effective leader who lays down new habits for the movement's adherents in a way that allows them to gain  a sense of identity.The role of leadership in the context of habit formation of followers and self is relevant .But support to a social movement does not come out of habits of people who support such movements.It seems that Duhigg has used his habit model as a hammer and every story he tells is a nail.Developing a \\"model\\" and trying to explain every situation according to that model , is another weakness of the book .<br />  Duhigg rightly draws our attention to the fact that habits can be manipulated by others.The book is a manual for corporate mind control.It tells how  corporates  manipulate our habits and can  use this information  for dark purposes. The others may like to develop and encourage us to have certain habits .This is the dark side of habits practiced , among others , by the advertising firms and marketers.They wield the power of habit to manipulate the consumers and others .Corporate retail houses can act like Big Brother , intruding the privacy of common customers or individuals .The dark over lords (Corporates)know this already .I am glad we  ordinary  people  too get to know it now .The book makes us aware of our buying habits.It is a powerful insight.<br />  The book gives two new concepts of small words  and weak ties .Small words are small changes leveraged in the present so that bigger changes can be enacted later on .But then , why put effort to maintain will power when you can step back to examine the tiny impulses that drive your desires and behaviours.Weak ties are described in the context of movements .Weak ties are the rational bonds between the people .People you may know of but not very well(Friends of friends).Movements are born and political campaigns are won using these weak ties.It remind us of the bridging social capital described by Robert Putnam in his book \\"Bowling Alone\\".There is a lot of weight in what Duigg says on the important role of weak ties.<br />  The book ignores or poorly covers the following areas:<br />1.Role of past experiences and social expectations in habit formation .<br />2.Depression and other emotional issues that drive an addiction in a person.<br />3.Examples of successful self help people or groups.Self help by individuals and also by groups ,  can result in major changes in habits as in life .<br />4. Need for empathy , caring and  love as a type of reward in habit formation .The self respect and guidance from well wishers in a positive environment .<br />5. People change when they embrace values more important to them than the rewards of a self destructive habit .(Why people change by Allen Wheelis).<br />6.The emotional intelligence that allows one to develop the will power for more positive feedback loops is poorly explored.<br /> It seems that the book has good stories but poor guidance.<br /><br /> Despite all its\\"flaws\\" and weknesses,I have enjoyed reading this book .I am quite impressed by the 12 steps approach followed by Alcoholics Anonymous(AA), especially making  moral inventory , will power,prayer , meditation and spiritual awakening .I am fascinated by the role of  habits, described by Duigg in organizations , social movements and leadership at different levels.Manipulation of ordinary individuals through habits and mind contorl by the Corporates , is a new insight.The importance of weak ties for leaders , is a very important area introduced by Duigg to his readers .<br />Despite my strong disagreements with some of the major areas of Duhigg's book , I recommend you to read this fascinating book , for the reason that it compellingly  provokes you to think and find your own solutions .<br />  Your habits are what you choose them to be.its o surrounding their drinking but character and emotional habits that cause the harm that they  do to them selves and to others.In step 5 , alcoholics  admit their  wrongs and develop exterior habits of self examination and admission of wrongs to other human beings  .At the same time , they  acquire interior habits or character traits such as  honesty , humility and forgiveness.They proceed from spiritual awakening which transforms the prescriptions and concerns which drive our old habits .They  try to practice these new habits daily in all they  do and through repeated action, the traits are generally ingrained in their minds and brains and develop into habitual dispositions .Right thinking , right feeling and right action slowly become second nature to them .This is the understanding of the habit formation that underlies the 12 steps of AA and is distilled in the phrase\\"practice these principles.\\"<br /> AA is  nurturing such a fruitful tradition of coperation between science , religion and the spiritual , a tradition Chrles Duhigg has chosen not to follow.Duhigg tries to fit 12 steps of AA by bending them out of shape  so that they will fit into his \\"habit loop\\" scheme of Cue , routine and reward.<br />  The mind can shape the brain , and modify behaviour, habits included.

0312641893|4.0|This is a really interesting and original sci-fi reworking of the Cinderella tale. It's fascinating and even beautiful. I'm hooked. I'm already starving for the next one, which won't be coming until 2013. The only issue I have with this book is that it's predictable. You figure out the upcoming twists pretty early, and get frustrated waiting for the characters to see the obvious. That said, they're good twists. And the ending is crazy awesome. Like I said, you'll be tearing your hair for the next one. I'm usually pretty critical of fairy tale adaptations, but this one got me quick and good. I'm sure the author's foreshadowing/predictability will improve in future installments.

B007Z9R69M|1.0|Gina is neither hot nor is she a great fighter on screen.  she is no Zoe Bell as far as stuntwomen go and she totally has no screen presence.  Her body makes her movement like a sausage spinning on it's end.  I may be fussy, I work at a gymnastics academy, but her build is short limbed and her balance is poor.  She moves with the grace and power of a three legged dog.<br /><br />She has no sense of comedic timing and delivers her lines with little presence or affect.  She doesn't really do much with the dialogue.  I could go on but the movie was bad enough.<br /><br />Don't rent this, even if you have trouble sleeping.
0345803485|1.0|I had heard a great deal of buzz regarding this book and ordered it before I knew what it was about. I was not put off by the subject matter, but only by the writer's handling of it. As in so many other reviews of this book, I thought the writing was insipid. I teach high school English and I know several 12th graders who could write rings around Ms. James. It's not sexy, not favorable to thinking women, not realistic, not worth the money or the time wasted on finding out that the book that created the buzz was a total bust. Oh my....

B0071XO8RA|5.0|The writing is top notch and the story very inventive.  Howey sucks you in with his wonderful prose, and makes you stick around with his powerful story.  You'll find a grim world, but don't lose hope, there is still something to root for.  The characters are rich, the conflict great, and the overarching theme is one that resonates now and the days far ahead.  Humanity is not lost, it is just under siege.  Great job, Howey!  You've got a fan.

B005DC68NI|5.0|No one can tell what the publishing landscape will look like next year, but as of 2012 this one book contains just about everything you need to understand about the world of self-publishing. It defines the current situation, explains why self-publishing is such an intriguing option for authors, and how to go about it. The numbers and examples are getting a little dated and many of them are anecdotal, but that's really the only kind of data available so it's no fault of Gaughran's. He writes engagingly and accessibly, takes nothing for granted, and covers his subject completely. I read the whole book in one day. After following the digital revolution of the publishing industry for the last four years, I can say that Gaughran sums it all up concisely and accurately. A great introduction and reference tool that I'll be using repeatedly as I self-publish.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I tried really hard to like this book. I had three girlfriends rave about it to me.  They said I \\"had\\" to read it. I'm so grateful I didn't download the entire trilogy. I kept slugging it out, trying to overlook the poor writing and just enjoy the story, but not even the titillating content could hold me. After the seventh time the main character referred to her \\"inner goddess\\" stomping her little foot or her hands on her little hips, I had to give it up. If I'd been reading a dead tree book I would have thrown it against the wall. And how many times can you ask your main character to sigh without risking them fainting?<br /><br />I understand the author isn't from the U.S., and maybe some of the childish writing devices she uses are cute somewhere else, but to most readers the cliches are just tired and downright insulting.<br /><br />Yes, the sex is interesting... if you've never had a sex life yourself and you need to read how it can be done. But it's nowhere near enough to keep the reader's attention.<br /><br />I felt so brain-dead after reading 65% of this book, I picked up a classic and immediately felt relief.<br /><br />I apologize if this review sounds like a literature snob, trust me I am not. I enjoyed the Hunger Games. But this drivel is indicative of our declining level of intelligence on the planet.
B002NZK5VY|1.0|that two people who were so hilarious together on the publicity circuit for this film have no chemistry whatsoever onscreen?  Could it be the writing?  The whole boring, predictable premise?  The Directing?  Yes, yes and yes.

B0001XAOLQ|5.0|Das Boot is no doubt my favorite war and foreign language film, let alone my favorite film, period. The five hour version has its dull moments, as in combat conditions. The combat scenes, especially the convoy attack, are spectacular. I have put Das Boot along with 1993's Stalingrad and 2004's Downfall as the ONLY WWII films I recommend. None of these films are rousing salutes to the troops or one sided Hollywood nonsense. They are what war is-ordinary people put into a life threatening situation and simply trying to survive.
B004GCPJDQ|2.0|*** ORIGINAL UNIT ***<br /><br />I read the mixed reviews before purchasing, convinced that the complaints were the result of improper installation, and confident that I, an engineer, could follow directions and install it correctly.  However, no matter what I did I couldn't get the mouse to power on.<br /><br />I unpacked the components, plugged the base into my computer, placed the battery pack on the base and let it fully charge.  I then installed the battery pack, being very careful to make sure it was snug and the locking tab fully engaged.  No joy.  The pack is so snug I had to pry it out with a tiny screwdriver (scraping the mouse).  I've repeatedly removed and re-inserted the battery pack but am unable to get it to work.  What a frustrating day!<br /><br />*** REPLACEMENT UNIT ***<br /><br />After finally giving up with my original unit, I concluded the unit must be defective and requested an exchange from Amazon.  When the new unit arrived, I unpacked it, plugged the charger base into my computer, placed the batter pack on the charger, and waited for the light to stop blinking (I did this before going to bed, and in the morning it was fully charged).  This unit slid right in to the mouse, no muss, no fuss, no screaming in frustration.  So far, it works perfectly.<br /><br />Conclusion: perhaps due to manufacturing issues (pure conjecture on my part), it seems that some units are defective and don't fit into the mouse properly and/or won't provide power to the mouse, while other units are fine.<br /><br />*** UPDATE AFTER TWO MONTHS ***<br /><br />The unit stopped working after two months.  This has been extremely frustrating.  I really wanted this product to work, and have spent a lot of time and effort on it.

B007KCG7MQ|4.0|Joe Walsh's new album is maybe not a classic but is very easy to listen to with a few catchy guitar riffs thrown in for good measure. You need to listen to the songs more than once and let the songs wash over you a few times to really appreciate this album. After 20 years this album is a good solid effort and another follow up album in the future would consolidate Joe's return.

B000005EJL|4.0|I have always enjoyed Supertramp's music, their superb musicianship, their imaginative music, their pure eccentricity and exuberance.  Sadly, they lost Roger Hodgson to a solo career, but the equally talented Rick Davies stayed on and helps provide the best moments on this 1997 release.That comfortable feel of the 70s Supertramp is manifested in tracks like the lengthy but joyous IT'S A HARD WORLD, YOU WIN I LOSE, C'EST WHAT, the infectious GET YOUR ACT TOGETHER and the buoyant title track.  While I admire the band's desire to try new approaches, I'm not fond of their R&B efforts like HELP ME DOWN THIS ROAD or the gospel influenced WHERE THERE's A WILL and why the \\"hidden track?\\"<br />Overall, this release has enough of what I like about SUPERTRAMP with the aforementioned disappointing tunes don't really make SOME THINGS an unworthy addition to the band's repertoire.

B004I2K4E8|3.0|As I'm sure gazillion other reviewers have already mentioned, this would've been a great, great performance had it not been for that one glaring weakness that is Nick Jonas.<br /><br />Les Miserables is one of my all-time favorite musicals, and I've watched it many times in different parts of the world.  I was SO ready to love this performance, especially since Alfie Boe has an unbelievable voice!  To me, Colm Wilkinson will forever be THE one and only Jean Valjean, but Boe comes pretty dang close.  It's not only the voice; he is extremely charismatic and can convey much with his eyes alone.<br /><br />Actually, the cast is overall great -- except Nick Jonas as Marius.  I have nothing against him personally, but he is so out of his league here that it's painful to watch (and to listen).  After trying to find something good in his performance several times, I just gave up and now fast forward every time he sings (which means anything after Look Down is shot).  It is truly annoying to be able to enjoy such beautiful songs as Red and Black, Do You Hear the People Sing, and Drink with Me only 75% of the way through.  I haven't a clue what the casting director was thinking!<br /><br />Of course, if you tolerate the Jonas Brother and make it to the end, you will be rewarded by a lovely finale.  Not one, not two, not three, but FOUR Jean Valjeans (including THE Colm Wilkinson)sing Bring Him Home -- absolutely breathtaking.  And then, the original London cast appears and they sing One Day More.  Yes, Michael Ball is Marius.  He shows the world how it's done.  It feels as if order has been restored in the world.<br /><br />Even though this concert is more elaborate and has some stronger singers, I prefer the 10th Anniversary Concert(TAC) to  this because TAC, after all, has no obvious weak link in the cast, which allows me to watch the entire show without having to touch the remote.  Whoever cast Nick Jonas should never be allowed to work in musical theater ever again.  AndI'd say release the TAC on Blu-ray and get it over and done with.  That's the one you want to own and watch over and over again.
B001B2CPH2|3.0|I enjoyed a lot more the first time I watched it. I was a lot younger and more interested in the romance, Patrick Swayzee and the music. This time I realized how corny it was with the evil ghouls taking the bad guys away. Patrick Swazee was cute but couldn't act. Whoopie Goldberg was really funny as usual and made the movie tolerable.

B005LAIHY0|3.0|One of my favorite things about the first two Alien movies is the seamless way they managed to merge the horror and scifi genres, something that many writers and directors have stumbled with since then.  This movie, however, is not a cross-genre masterpiece, it's strictly a scifi movie with some gross moments, like a rated R episode of Star Trek or something.  There is also little in the way of sympathetic characters, with probably Theron (who is a coward, but trying to fight against her natural instincts to, just once, impress probably the only person she cares about besides herself, so is maybe the most human of the characters) and Elba being the only ones with truly three dimensional characterization.<br /><br />The plot is very reminiscent of Dead Space, particularly the first cartoon movie.  It also doesn't seem to entirely know what it wants to be.  There are different threads picked up, or at least hinted at, and then thrown away, as the movie eventually approaches a conclusion that is full of holes, which many of the rabid fans will say either don't exist (by offering made-up explanations that are hardly supported by the movie) or that we don't understand because we're not intelligent enough to do so (generally the fall back of people who feel stupid while watching movies).  The 'main' tie-in to the rest of the franchise (which is spoiler-y so I'm not going to go into detail) is also just ridiculous, the very existence of it so convoluted and weird that it makes me hate that it was even there, especially since it seemed to be fan service more than anything else.<br /><br />Is this a good movie on its own, looking at it without the franchise?  Not really.  It's a mediocre movie that looks very nice and has some very big names.  If it didn't have the pedigree it has, it would probably have very little attention and make money only if it was the only genre choice the weeks it was out.  In many ways it reminds me of the movie Sunshine, including the way the writing falls apart in the last act.<br /><br />I'm hoping the Blu Ray will include footage of the concept and set design, as I've read articles on it and the process does sound fascinating.  The best part about the movie was how it looked, so if you're into the visual aspect of movies, I do recommend seeing it.  It's also, I guess, worth seeing if you're a fan of the franchise and can deal with the way this messes up the timeline and leaves you with questions that you never even wanted.  I'll update once I've looked through the blu-ray and watched the extras, which will hopefully make watching the movie yet again worth it.
030758836X|2.0|While I must admit this book began as an interesting premise and method of writing, I put it down several times.  I came back only to finish the book and ended up disappointed.  The wrap-up was totally unbelievable, like some movie where the bad guys are always, always three steps ahead, with no credible explanation as to how they managed it (except the writer can make anything happen). I prefer my books to be a bit more realistic, unless I know I am reading a vampire book or science fiction.  If you decide to read it, be prepared for a big let-down in the final chapters and no happy ending.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Nice relaxing music.  very easy to play.  really helps to beat the stress.  Nice graphics.  lots of levels to keep you from being bored.
0345803493|4.0|Here are my impressions about this book after literally just finishing it for the first time: it's erotic, sexy and mature; has excellent character development and constant plot (unique in anything \\"erotic\\" and becoming rare-er in the romance genre); it's sweet, heart touching, and stirs the senses; it has a modern, literature-nerd, classic-music aficionado voice...and I couldn't put it down. Would I recommend it? Oh, yes.<br /><br />Who should stay away? People who don't understand colloquial writing styles, grammar Nazi's and people who don't like to read explicit sex. Ms. James is VERY detailed about sex and is not shy about A-N-Y-T-H-I-N-G regardless of how dark or kinky... in fact at some point the term \\"kinky f---ery\\" comes up and becomes an inside joke, but it is very apropos. I've read many of the reviews that are negative because of the writer's style... and I say, you've got to let it go. Why? Because the author is writing from the 1st person POV and chooses to write the way she feels the narrator would talk/think/experience the world. And, for Heaven's sake, there are things that people do ALL THE TIME - even lip biting. You don't have enough friends if you don't know that people have their unique \\"-isms\\" that drive others to laughter, distraction and near-violence. My husband taps... Ana bites her lip. Get over it.<br /><br />So what's this story about? It's about redemption and second chances. There's \\"kinky f---ery\\", a wicked awesome gliding scene, a bunch of drama that romance seems to necessitate, and some serious loving. I love that the dark protagonist finds himself... even though he seems so self-assured to the outside world. Like a kinky Mr. Darcy.
B007HC3LHS|4.0|I gave this 4 stars because once it really got going, it was quite good. Unfortunately, I felt it dragged a bit & I grew impatient midway through as Cathy's OCD was wearing on me. At times I honestly think scenarios were repeated in series of six just like Cathy favored. Perhaps this was done on purpose by the author or is par for the course when you go into a story knowing that something terrible happened & the main character is recovering from it, so I won't call it a failure. I must admit that I had to keep myself at it because I was intent on finding out the details of just what Lee did to Cathy that landed him in prison. I couldn't leave until that big moment & then when it's revealed, the timelines merge into one & the end in the present is fast coming.<br /><br />Now to the characters & story. I liked Cathy but found her tiresome. I don't think that's bad as Cathy finds herself so. She had problems & it was very interesting to find out where the roots sprang from & took hold. I liked that it wasn't just the attack she endured that gave her reason to have these issues. I really liked Stuart & wanted more of him but as this story was in the first person POV through Cathy, there's only so much to get in, I suppose. I admit freely that the POV is not my favorite for such reasons. I did feel that the ending was super rushed with regard to Stuart. We never find out exactly what injuries he suffered in the final confrontation & then we zip forward to court where he's fine. After going day by day with Cathy's recitations of the past & present, it felt like very short shrift at the very end. More like tying up ends not a natural progression. I did like the resolutions, but felt that they were hurried along & I wanted a better pay off for having stayed through the deadly slow bits.<br /><br />I thought Lee was done very well but I would have liked to know where his particular brand of crazy stemmed from. It was so specific & vicious. I was hoping for him to be deceased by the end but I have to admit that the ending given was certainly creepier. It was interesting to watch him as a character take over little by little & Cathy acquiesce & capitulate over & again until she was so far gone, she couldn't get out. Many times, I found myself wondering if she would have taken any of the signals given that he wasn't quite right (the following, the showing up inside her home unannounced, I don't care if he was making dinner, etc.) if he weren't so handsome, charming & solvent. I still don't understand why she seemed to need the validation of her friends to tell her it was okay to leave or break up. I know it stems from more than Cathy's relationship with Lee (going back possibly further than her parents deaths), but I found it quite curious. It was as though she never had much a sense of self & was just lost without the support of others to tell her her own mind. In the end though, I was very glad that little by little & then by a lot, she found herself & the strength to save herself & take back her life. Looking back, it may be my favorite thing about the book, watching that evolution.<br /><br />And speaking of Cathy's friends, I didn't really feel they came across as such good friends to begin with. They were good for going out & had been since college but none of them ever seemed to be the BFF sort. I don't think they were bad \\"friends\\" to Cathy, especially as Cathy didn't strike me as so very into them either. They were young & self-centered, all of them, so I don't blame any of them for being so self-involved as to not have really been listening to what Cathy was trying (admittedly, poorly) to tell them. In the story, we're never given any indication that Cathy has any more than a surface knowledge of her friend's relationships, so if the situations were reversed, would she have been any better? I did like the way the bit with Sylvia played out & that was a good moment of growth & bonding between she & Cathy. As I can't even recall the names of the other friends, they obviously didn't make much of an impression on me, so that's all that needs to be said about them.<br /><br />Overall, this was a good book. I wouldn't call it a beach or vacay read as the subject matter is a bit heavy & nothing close to fun. Still, I would read another by this author & would recommend it.he names of the other friends, they obviously didn't make much of an impression on me, so that's all that needs to be said about them.<br /><br />Overall, this was a good book.

0307352145|4.0|When I first heard of Susan Cain's book Quiet, I immediately felt that a book had been written for my kind, to explain and possibly justify my kind to itself as well as the rest of the extroverted world. When I finally read it, however, I realized that it wasn't quite the book that I had hoped it would be.<br />I must say up front that I am not blaming the book itself for not being what I thought it would be. Susan Cain does set out to explain the cultural and, to a certain extent, biological framework of the introvert and gives them their time in the spotlight, whether they want to step into it or not. In order to lend scientific credibility she quotes numerous psychologists and social experiments to open the door to questions regarding what determines whether one becomes an introvert as well as the variations on the theme.<br />There are brilliant passages, including a spot on true/false quiz for determining where one falls on the introvert/extrovert spectrum. The explanations of over stimulation and high reactivity also resonate with this introvert. There is a fascinating account of a weekend gathering for `highly sensitive people' which the author attended. This event in which everyone was in his/her comfort zone, free to think, write, read or engage in introspective conversations on intimate topics initially seemed like Heaven to the author. She had thought that she would be in her element, `a world in which everyone speaks softly and no one carries a big stick.' On the contrary, she missed her extrovert husband and the sense of balance that he provides in her life and kept hoping someone would lighten the mood of the proceedings with some jokes and alcohol.<br />However, for my taste too much of the book is spent on the differences in behaviors between introverts and extroverts regarding business investments and stock market speculation. She claims that the economic crash of 2008 happened because reckless extroverts overruled cautious introverts and failed toheed warning signs, instead taking greater risks.<br />She does cite plenty of introverts who exhibited great courage in the service of the cause of social justice--Rosa Parks, Gandhi--as well as highly successful business people--Bill Gates, Warren Buffet--and offers plenty of anecdotes to explain how they accomplished what they did because, not in spite of, their introversion. She also discourages the use of the word `shy' which carries a stigma and a negative connotation that exacerbates the social struggles of the introvert.<br />I am attempting to evaluate this book objectively and transcend my personal disappointment that it was not the book I expected it to be. It is a book that I feel needed to be written and it drags the introverts out of the closet for the respect she feels they're due. However, for me, it was too much the work of an introvert. It needed the fire and passion of an extrovert to liven up the proceedings. I felt similar to how Susan Cain felt at the retreat for `highly sensitive people' and kept waiting for some spice and intense flavor to help the dry concepts, theorizing and psychosocial experiments go down more easily.
0763644765|4.0|Leslie Patricelli is hit or miss with me. Some of her books are great, and others I think are really stupid (ie \\"Higher Higher\\"). At first this book fell into the latter category and I did not like it at all. It seemed way too watered down and simple with too many \\"vague\\" pages (like a two-page spread of the baby holding himself going \\"Eeee, Mmm, Ahh, Ooo\\") and not enough explanation about what is happening (example: no mention of the words `pee' or `poo' or any other words of the sort aside from \\"potty\\" which most babies are associating with the toilet seat themselves, yet there are FOUR pages on \\"Where does kitty go? [turn page] Oh. Where does doggy go?...\\" with simply a picture of the cat by itself and then the cat standing in a [liter] box. I mean, really? You have to come to so many conclusions on your own on so many pages, a toddler under two is not able to draw those when these are first time experiences). Anyway, sure enough, my little one (maybe 15 months at the time) didn't like it either at first. He became bored instantly. So I had plans to return it, but because I put it out of sight, it fell out of mind very quickly. So after finally printing the return packing slip and putting it in a box a couple months later, I thought I'd give it another whirl before shipping it off, and whaddayaknow, the tot loves it now! (17 months). And of course his favorite page?... the two page spread of the baby holding himself going \\"Eeee, Mmm, Ahh, Ooo\\". And now I just improvise with the words and take the liberties of adding my own explanations where one is lacking (the whole book) (final pages: baby sitting on potty trying, waiting, turn page, waiting, bored, asleep, turn page, perks up \\"what's that?\\", turn page, *tinkle tinkle toot* \\"I did it!\\" turn page, *undies*!)...weird. But he likes it and the pics are obviously cute, so I guess that's all that matters is that it's working.

B00393SFU2|5.0|Honestly, after reading some of the wonderfully written reviews here I cannot see myself even attempting to better this excellence.  Just going to say I watched it today and was astounded.  I originally started to watch it in English but as soon as Lorre came on, realized he didn't do his own voice-over. Stopped and begin the subtitled version. The imagery in this film will blow you away. Lorre is perfect in the part.  I've mostly seen him in comedic roles, the exception being CASSABLANCA, so this was a good opportunity to watch him strut his dramatic chops.<br /><br />On a lesser note, I enoyed seeing life in the 30's Germany. The washboard and the wash tub, the way the rooms looked as well as the way people dressed.<br /><br />Now, go read some of the other reviews. You won't be sorry.
B006H8BIIM|5.0|Everybody crying about the in app purchase can't see a good game beyond their bellyaching. The game is actually pretty well balanced. No you can't dive in and breeze through the levels, where is the challenge in that anyway? But if you take the time to learn the game, credit collection comes in fast, and at a reasonable rate you can upgrade your station and advance through the game.<br /><br />As for people's credit accumulation of roughly 150 credits per 15 minutes, that's early on in the game. I've logged just over 1.5 hrs in the game and have over 1600 credits to show for it, based on my credit purchases. This comes out to roughly 100 credits every 6 minutes.<br /><br />But anyway a complete station upgrade appears to be the end game. If you start off there (which is what the in app purchase appears to provide for only a buck, I've seen much steeper rates in better reviewed games.) then the game would be beatable in no time, thus leaving no time to enjoy the game. Gamers ultimately look for challenging games which provide replayability. If all the IAP moaners had their way of an super easy game, then &quot;gaming&quot; as we know it would be dead. A good FAOTD only comes about once a week, so why do you want to ace it in a sitting?<br /><br />Sadly in the time it took to write this several more people who played the game for 10 minutes then left a 'one star IAP games suck' review, which will give this truely enjoyable game a poor rating.

1594203334|5.0|The people that say this book makess overly broad generalizations are missing the point.  This is the author's perspective on French parenting. If you want a balanced and complete study you should buy a book written by a sociologist written on the subject.<br /><br />Having said that, I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I read it over a weekend and it is an extremely easy read. Some of the chapters could have been organized better, but each chapter has an obvious theme and point which I liked.<br /><br />I am pregnant with my first child and I had heard good things about the book. I have found myself annoyed and disgusted with things I have seen my fellow American parents do with their children, and I have continued to read and research ways to do it differently with my son when he arrives. The book definitely gives another prospective for consideration.  It gives a good comparison between some French and American child rearing philosophies in an easy and fun way to digest.

B003EY7IRC|4.0|I read the first book Nov. 2011, rated it 2 stars, but downloaded the second book on my kindle.  I got around to reading it last week (7 months later) while on a plane.  The second book was better than the first, so I read books 3 and 4 -- and those two I really liked.  I was excited to start reading Shadowfever yesterday, and overall, I rate the series a 3.5.  I agree with others about Shadowfever.  Lots of sex, which really didn't add a whole lot to the book.  And, honestly, I STILL have trouble with the Mac and Barron thing.  He's so old in comparison to her...and I just don't get the attraction.  I can't relate to her at all.  In all fairness to the author, I probably would have rated this a little higher had I never read her Highlander series.  But, I also understand that I liked that series better, so that is coloring my judgement.  I do think the sexual component might have been a bow to her fans who like that -- as well as the strong alpha male -- in her stories.  She's a great writer, so I'll read the other two she writes about Mac and Barrons.  But, I KNOW I'll never read the Dani book(s).  NO interest in that story thread at all....But, honestly, I am not waiting with bated breath....

B005L38QK2|4.0|This mouse is sensitive and reacts fast. But I could not find an owner's manual anywhere and did not know how to set it up. You would think that a mouse that costs $70 dollars would tell you how to use it. There are several videos showing how wonderful the mouse is. How about taking one of those videos and show how to set the thing up. Finally I figured out that you program the buttons using macros. Then I had to learn how to do that. Nice mouse once you figure out how to get the buttons to do what you want them to do.
B0082RYR7A|5.0|this was a gift to my mother who is over 60 years old.  she truly loved all 3 books and couldn't put the books down.  she finished all 3 books in less than a week.
B003XF1XOQ|1.0|the first and second to the series was good, it held my attention. Third book struggled for a form, jumped around too much and had a fizzle ending. I felt cheated of an explosive ending.
0061692042|4.0|Couldn't put it down. It seemed like two books - the first and second parts were quite different. The first part felt like dead-reckoned realism, the humble, painful and raw telling of the everyday details of a life catapulting blindly toward despair. The second part felt like a fairytale, an intricate telling of an improbable adventure, lacking the innocent details of everyday life that made the first half so real and heartbreaking; the unfolding of a life as perhaps only a child could conjure. I love Ford's writing, it is very, very good, extremely skillful and thoughtful, he clearly researches his subjects and characters in tremendous depth. His prose is little eccentric occasionally, and he gets away with it - which I suspect happens when no one dares to correct a really good writer. And all is forgiven a hundred times over when the author powerfully creates a world that makes you want to read, read and read some more -- though you are not sad when it's over as happens when you read a truly life-changing book. And yet, scenes from the book float up into consciousness again and again, like a dream you keep remembering, surely the sign of a very good book. All in all, CANADA is a wonderfully written, memorable book, very worth reading.

B007IXWL2C|5.0|The trilogy is worth reading.  I honestly like the third book the best.  The story comes together more and starts toward a great ending.  The first book was more shocking and the second book had some drama, but the third book to me was the more satisfying read.  Give it a try.  The story is good, but you have to have all the sex to made this story work,

These are Windows versions and I am playing them with Parallels 8 beta (running Windows 7) on a MacPro (circa 2008) on Snow Leopard 10.6.8. Even HOMM 1 runs fine on this configuration! I have been waiting YEARS to be able to find a system that could run these old games again! Thank You Mastertronic!<br /><br />Heroes of Might & Magic has to be one of the funnest series of Fantasy Strategy games EVER and is highly recommended! Even my young kids enjoy these games!
B005LAII1C|5.0|Except, maybe the advertising should be a little more explicit. This is not for kids. That took some of the fun out of it for me. There were two couples in the theater with children around 8 or 9. The trailers are so cute with a cuddly teddy bear, but for sure this is adult pleasure. I feel that maybe if they did not realize how mature this was, they should have taken their children and left.

0788737244|4.0|When John Steinbeck wasn't trying too hard to propagandize (as in, say, The Pearl, or The Grapes of Wrath), sometimes he could tell a really good story.  That is certainly the case in Of Mice and Men, which has excellent characterization and the closest thing to a plot that Steinbeck got until much later in his career.  While it has many of the same thematic elements as his other books from this period, it can best be read as a story about friendship, having someone else with whom to share the joys and sorrows of life.  Of course, for Steinbeck, it is mostly sorrows---it is a tragedy, after all, and a particularly depressing one.  One could argue that the ending isn't entirely bitter, but bittersweet, since Lenny's end is at least a happy one (or at least as happy as George is able to contrive for him given the circumstances)...but the real tragedy lies in George's fate.  Still, this is a somewhat remarkable novel from Steinbeck, well crafted and immensely powerful.  This is one that you will keep coming back to, as I have a couple of times since I first read it in school (one of the very few books I had to read for school that I actually enjoyed).  Steinbeck surpassed Of Mice and Man probably only with East of Eden.

B004W4CK44|5.0|I bought the soundtrack as soon as I got home from the movie. I had seen Pina's troupe 30 years ago in Australia and had eagerly awaited the Wim Wenders movie. It was even better than I expected due to this glorious soundtrack. It was my introduction to exciting new artists like Jun Miyake and Hazmat Modine. I highly recommend the entire soundtrack. I just wish the movie distributors would make the 3D Bluray video available in the US so I can relive the dance performances.

B00782O7IY|5.0|A love story not only between our two main actors but also between the audience and film. The importance of film in creating a fantasy escape still plays out in parts of the world where the impoverished have little or no hope for a better life such as in India, Nigeria, Mexico.<br /><br />A change story of the challenges in adaptive change and the consequences when you fail. In this case the silent actors who had relied on expression to communicate found the microphone and/or their voice to be a difficult hurdle in the new world of talkies.<br /><br />A history story in that we don't really know a subject until we know it's history. The stars of the silents either succeeded or failed to adapt in the early '30s to the world of sound. Clara Bow (about talkies, \\"they're stiff and limiting\\"), Mary Pickford, Garbo, Fairbanks, Chaplin, Valentino.<br /><br />When we lose the crutch of language to simplify the task of understanding then how much more our brains have to search out other clues; to be alert to nuances of gesture and expression. \\"The Artist\\" is an exercise in utilizing those dormant areas of our brains.<br /><br />After a short while you might not notice that it's black & white with little dialogue.<br />Similar to another, somewhat, dialogue free and thoughtful film \\"Le Quattro Volte\\".

B005LAII0I|5.0|I wanted to see this on the big screen but had to wait to rent -- So excited to watch it finally. I won't spoil the movie for anyone so will just lay out a few things. Here they lay this great story out from start to finish and it is complete, makes sense, all fits well together nicely, of course there is a happy ending. They do change some things around such as the dwarfs names etc. Not everything is EXACT. For me, it was a good change. There is many twists in the story and it is funny. It is quirky and dark. My whole family liked it a lot, will buy when it gets cheaper. I would recommend to anyone except perhaps really young kids who scare easily. No curse words, clean film.
1609611543|4.0|I discovered this book because it was recommended over 20 times by John McLean in his excellent book \\"Low Carb Revolution\\". So I read \\"Wheat Belly\\" from cover-to-cover, based on John McLean's recommendation.<br /><br />It turns out that \\"Wheat Belly\\" is mostly fantastic & an excellent read & an almost-perfect book, with a few problems that bothered me:<br /><br />1. William Davis gets way too technical in multiple chapters throughout the book. Therefore, I highly recommend reading John McLean's \\"Low Carb Revolution\\" FIRST before reading \\"Wheat Belly\\", because McLean explains (in simple & easy-to-understand & layperson terms) the roles of insulin & glucagon & other hormones in the body. Unfortunately, William Davis assumes that you have a technical background in medicine for many parts of his book, and doesn't grasp how to explain things clearly to a layperson. On the other hand, John McLean excels at this, so luckily, if you read McLean's book first, you'll at least be able to understand what Davis is talking about during the technical portions of this book.<br /><br />2. William Davis goes on & on & on about how to live a healthy lifestyle, but then he ends the entire book by telling you to use a **MICROWAVE** for most of his recipes!! Um, what, William? Are you kidding me?!?! I stopped using a microwave 15 years ago, and the terrible effects that microwaves have on food molecules & the body have been widely documented. How do you expect us to take you seriously as a health expert if you're advising everybody to use a microwave?? Not a great way to end your book, after taking us along for an entire journey that was pretty outstanding. I would NEVER advise ANYBODY ANYWHERE to EVER use a microwave for ANYTHING. Absolutely poor way to end the book.<br /><br />3. William Davis gives sugar a \\"get out of jail free\\" pass throughout the book to focus solely on wheat. In reality, the perfect diet isn't just a wheat-free diet, but actually a \\"low-glycemic diet\\", which eliminates modern society's 2 evils: BOTH wheat AND sugar. The effects of sugar on the bloodstream & human health are ALMOST as bad as wheat, but Davis chooses not to point any fingers at sugar. If you just eliminated wheat from your diet but continued to drink coca-cola every day, you're going to be in SERIOUS SERIOUS trouble. So Davis is about 80% of the way there, but he really needed to come down harder on sugar, too.<br /><br />Besides those 3 things, \\"Wheat Belly\\" is a very fast read, it is very informative, and it will be life-changing to just about every single human being that reads it. I highly recommend \\"Wheat Belly\\", but be sure to give yourself a well-rounded education by supplementing this book with other books advocating low-glycemic & low-insulinemic diets. Then, you will have the complete picture!!ates modern society's 2 evils: BOTH wheat AND sugar.

B007VTVGAQ|4.0|Upon my first listen to this album, I wasn't immediately enthralled. Like her previous album, it took a few listens. But after a while, it really grows on you.<br /><br />Besides, it's safe to say, Fiona's only truly \\"catchy\\" album (music with prominent choruses and melodic hooks) was really just her first album. She is also definitely an artist that \\"grows\\" and evolves. After listening to this album, I revisited her discography and was amazed at how different her music and lyrics are, in comparison to now. Make no mistake--she has a unique musical identity that is consistent along with all her albums, but yet--she grows on each one.<br /><br />Time will tell for me, but I do think this is one of her strongest, if not the strongest. She pares down her instruments and production to the barest essentials, and it actually strengthens her music. She has always been a gifted lyricist who can nail home a point, while being deep and opaque.<br /><br />To liken it to a metaphor, these songs are not just minor musical excursions, but they flow like a conversation set to music! Or music, set to a conversation. I mean that in the best possible way: it just sounds so natural! And with definite purpose, of course--her lyrics are enthralling and forceful. Listening to this album on repeat, I feel like I'm listening to stories being told to me, in a conversation, while having coffee and pastries... just sit back and enjoy the mental foreplay.<br /><br />Standout tracks for me are \\"Every Single Night\\", \\"Daredevil\\"; among the more musically accessible tracks are the rollicking \\"Jonathan\\", the lovely coo-ing \\"Regret\\", and the feisty \\"Anything We Want\\".
B006H8BIIM|1.0|Ok I don't type bad reviews just for the fun of it but this one deserves it. The game itself is good and well made and it WAS fun, until the point when you need to upgrade then you need to grind in endless mode for 26+ hours to get said upgrades or fork out real cash. I have no problem with devs making money on apps but next time charge a flat fair price for your work. I would have cheerfully paid $4 or $5 for it but this blatant money grab has soured me and many other potential buyers. Sorry Orgin8 but I wont give any of your current apps or future ones a try if this is how you conduct your business.
0823095223|5.0|Great book! This book has been a big help in my first project. I am actually finishing my sculptcher today and currently researching materials I want to use for the mold&resin process. I highly recommend this book along with Mark Alfrey sculpting dvd's.
0393316041|4.0|Finished reading June 30th 2012<br /><br />Wow, Feynman, I think you had a great life, filled with achievement and fun. And I love it that you captured a bunch of it in this book. I am happy I read the book. I wish I had read it in college and did more of the experiments you did. I would definitely recommend this to my young friends.<br /><br />Feynman must have kept a detailed journal, because the stories have a good amount of detail and helps show his inquisitive personality. And his back to the fundamentals, deductive logical thinking is put out there in words and will inspire people to ask simple questions and be brave about trying new things (and to keep a journal, just in case!).<br /><br />Also interesting to learn about Feynman's talents outside of the world of theoretical physics. While his scientific brain cannot but be nature's gift, his accomplishments in performance and fine arts are all about an open mind and tireless effort. The effort he put into music and painting, and the recognition he got, is for me, the true lesson of this book. The guy was smart (and a smart ass) of course, but he probably did not have artistic talents. He however did pretty good here based on effort, and I believe it's this combination of effort and his scientific brain that made his a rock star physicist. The lesson for all the talented folks - Use your skills, work hard, have fun and be persistent.<br /><br />There's not a lot not to like about this book, but there's always some. The language isn't the best, and Feynman could have done with better editing of his journal like story-telling. Also, I sensed a degree of smugness, which I am never a fan of (i associate greatness with humbleness), but I can see the challenge. How else do you write about the highlights and stories of your life (esp. one as colorful as Feynman's), and not appear a little bit of a snob?<br /><br />Anecdotes - Yes<br />Quotes - No<br />Read again - No<br />Recommend - Yes<br /><br />Srikanth

B00008G7UJ|1.0|Titling this movie _William Shakespeare's Romeo & Juliet_ is either provoking or hilarious, depending on your point of view. Not since Sam Taylor's _The Taming of the Shrew_ in 1929 has an English-language Shakespeare movie used such a small percentage of Shakespeare's text. Rarely since then have Shakespeare's words been as ineptly spoken or, for that matter, as unconvincingly acted on screen as they are here. And as for plot:<br /><br />In Shakespeare's tragedy, Juliet is a 13-year-old girl (and Lady Capulet still in her twenties). The most famous scene shows Romeo paying court to Juliet as she stands above him on her moonlit balcony, which serves as a potent visual symbol of their budding relationship; no matter how he longs to touch her, she is inaccessible, out of reach. The following night, her Nurse supplies a rope ladder so that Romeo can ascend to be with his bride. In the final scene, Romeo forces open the Capulets' tomb, kills Paris in combat there, then kills himself before Juliet awakens from her deathlike sleep. After talking with Romeo's page, Friar Laurence rushes in, hoping to prevent such a tragedy, but he loses his nerve and runs out, whereupon Juliet stabs herself. The warring families come to the cemetery--without Lady Montague, who has died of grief--and achieve a shamefaced reconciliation as they contemplate their losses.<br /><br />These statements are not spoilers, however, because not one of them matches what happens in the movie. How then is it William Shakespeare's _Romeo and Juliet_?<br /><br />In an updated California treatment like this one, we can of course count on Baz Luhrmann for an unprecedented number of gimmicks per minute. In one light, he is working in the visually opulent, operatically overblown, and spectacularly, unapologetically tasteless style of earlier music-loving movie directors like Franco Zeffirelli and Ken Russell. In fact, many aspects of Luhrmann's film have inescapable parallels with Zeffirelli's equally overrated _Romeo and Juliet_, so popular with teen audiences in 1968 and '69. Among other examples, we encounter:<br /><br />--a younger Nurse than typically found in traditional productions;<br />--a Juliet who lives in fear of an abusive father;<br />--a Capulet fest interrupted by an interpolated song about love;<br />--a scene-stealing, flamboyantly overemotional Mercutio, portrayed as an angry sort of misfit who clearly seems to be in love with Romeo;<br />--at least one character dunking his head in a fountain;<br />--one camera shot where a key actor is totally unable to cry convincingly on cue;<br />--the superfluous repetition of a phrase like \\"All are punished\\" (with that last word wrongly pronounced as three syllables);<br />--and, again, text that has been thoroughly mangled, first by drastic editing and then by photogenic young actors who truly do not seem to understand the lines they are mouthing.<br /><br />Zeffirelli's leads are more successful at looking pretty while wearing a variety of earnest expressions, but Luhrmann's American actors definitely win the prize for sounding clueless and uncomprehending. Without rewriting as outrageously as his predecessor, Luhrmann does sanction a handful of brainless changes in Shakespeare's text (\\"a rose by any other WORD\\"?)<br /><br />Those who feel inclined are welcome to trace the similarities between the Luhrmann movie and _West Side Story_, with its contemporary street gangs and Hispanic version of the Capulets. (If you want a _West Side Story_ rewrite, seek out the superior Spanish film _Los Tarantos_.)<br /><br />Only one aspect of Luhrmann's vision is genuinely thought-provoking. What DiCaprio's Romeo appears to like best about Juliet is simply that she is so *available*, so eagerly receptive to his embraces. Adding to her attraction, no doubt, is the fact that when they first begin making out, Romeo is just coming down from the effects of a mind-altering drug, while Juliet is literally dressed like an angel. Friar Laurence seems quite right to worry that just as Romeo has lost interest in Rosaline, he will not remain faithful to Juliet for long. Whatever headstrong despair he registers at the thought of her death reflects, to this viewer, more of guilt than deathless love.<br /><br />The most satisfying sequence for me, however, involves Romeo's attempt to make peace with Tybalt (the former briefly sounding sincere and mature), only to have Tybalt turn on him and beat him up. This is not what Shakespeare had in mind, but it fully justifies Mercutio's outrage at Romeo's refusal to defend himself.<br /><br />Though my wife refuses to watch the movie, I know she would enjoy the car chase in the final act, where Romeo is seriously guilty of surpassing the speed limit. This, too, is not what Shakespeare had in mind, but it is well calibrated to reinvigorate those viewers who have been growing bored since the deaths of Mercutio and Tybalt.<br /><br />There is just one moment that really surprised me. According to the closing credits, Luhrmann actually paid a certain Lilene Mansell to serve as \\"dialogue and speech coach.\\" Amid all the shouting and sniffling and mumbling and murmuring--where the assumption seems to be that the audience is not going to pay much attention to what the characters are saying anyway--we might at least have dreamt that this hip-hop generation would have some sensitivity to the underlying beat of Shakespeare's text. No such luck. For instance, DiCaprio and company don't even recognize that to fit the verse meter, the heroine's name must be two syllables (JOOL-yet) and not three (they persist in calling her \\"joo-lee-YET\\").<br /><br />Anyhow, that's the least of this movie's problems. I could give it two stars, on the grounds that it's entertaining in a kitschy, implausible way (and sometimes tense without becoming nauseatingly violent), but I won't. When the final gunshot was followed by some of the closing phrases of _Tristan und Isolde_, I found myselfthinking, \\"Right! Similar story! I should have listened to Wagner's opera instead.\\"<br /><br />To end with a SPOILER: This film does have one point in common with Shakespeare: Romeo and Juliet both die. Over the centuries, there have been adaptations where they didn't. Some of those, in fact, were probably more faithful to Shakespeare than this.<br /><br />UPDATE. I've belatedly listened to the audio commentary track, where Baz Luhrmann and three of his colleagues duplicate several of my own observations (including the idea that in their view, it doesn't really matter whether you can understand the lines the characters are saying). But let's allow Luhrmann to have the last word:<br /><br />\\"Believe you me, I am not the first to butcher Shakespeare.\\"

0345803485|2.0|What sounded like an interesting premise just didn't materialize in E L James \\"Fifty Shades of Grey' although the 500+ page paperback novel certainly provided ample length for her to accomplish that goal in this #1 NY Times Bestseller.  James' Anastasia Steele is neither compelling nor believable as a young woman experiencing her first taste of illicit love.  Her annoying habits that include giving way too much credence to her inner goddess' observations, striving to be as obstinate as possible in a weak attempt to show independence, and waffling continually between truly caring for her lover, Christian Grey, while truly abhorring his lifestyle allows the reader to become less than empathetic with her plight.  I understand her conflict but I don't want to be beat over the head with it every time I turn the page.  We all have our doubts but we don't have to let them occupy our thoughts and ultimately our lives 24/7.  Although conflict is necessary to the story line, constant conflict wears on a reader until they become so numb to it that it loses its impact.  Nor is it realistic to expect that sex is the answer to every problem that surfaces in a relationship, especially problems stemming from the coming together of two such divergent characters who have little in common.  I am not exaggerating when I say this couple engaged in more sex than conversation and if you are looking for intelligent dialogue or gripping observations, you will need to go elsewhere.  I could easily understand why Christian Grey would possess such a \\"mercurial\\" personality but referring to it in every scene as a way to keep the sexual tension up wore me out.  I will say that James did a better job developing his character and making him believable than she did with Anastasia's.  Wondering about why Christian was the way he was, what caused him to become the person he himself loathed, was what kept me reading the book.  The sex scenes were, with a few exceptions, rather blase'.  I would ratherhave a few sentences that were creatively well-written depicting the forbidden pleasures that  the two indulged in rather than page upon page of nondescript and repetitive dialogue, emotions and actions.  50 Shades was one of those books that I kept on reading hoping it would get better.  Unfortunately, for me, that never happened.
1934609625|3.0|Disappointingly Campion only makes brief appearances in this adventure. A standard perfect murder plot.  The two romantic leads were dull. The best thing about this are Gerry and Mrs Tassie. Their relationship was credible, touching and chilling in the last few chapters.  Worth a read.

B004JHY8A8|5.0|This is a well written and executed story that will touch you deeply. I was totally engrossed in this book, not wanting to put it down. The characters and plot were well thought out. The timeline between the past events and the present melded well so that you did not get lost or confused as so often happens with stories that jump from one time frame to another. I would highly  recommend this book.
B004LWZW9M|5.0|This movie has a multi-dimensional cast and is fun and enjoyable to watch. It's got the music and the different plots going together all at the same time and it just works. Just like Valentines Day worked, this works. You want to watch it again right after it's over.
0393064476|5.0|There is nothing new under the sun, right? Move aside Einstein and the modern scientists:Democritus, Epicurus and Lucretius had already imagined the atom.<br />What would our modern world be without the re-discovery of the classical books?<br />That's how the Renaissance came about and lets be thankful for it.<br />I bought \\"The Swerve\\" because the proposition that the discovery in the 1400's of Lucretius' book \\"De Rerum Natura\\"  was one of the enlightning moments in the Renaissance interested me.<br />I was not disappointed.The Swerve is well researched and written and I would recommend it to anybody interested in the birth of Renaissance thinking, Italy and the ambience of the intellectuals of that time.<br />The philosophy part comes in the last chapters after an exhaustive description of the corruption of the Papacy and the Catholic priesthood. This part is very informative and interesting especially for those who know Italian history (and I am one of them) but I would have liked not to have gone through almost all the book before getting to Lucretius.
B000H6SXMY|5.0|I see a lot of people are on here leaving product reviews when they bought it from a different website. Personally I think you should just leave a review on the website you bought it from mostly because I almost didn't buy it because I saw all the poor ratings without reading the actual reviews but on the plus after reading those reviews I will never buy DVD's from Ebay.<br /><br />I bought my Friends: The Complete Series Collection from Amazon and it's fantastic. All the disks play perfectly. I loved the book it came with, it's not much it just gives the episode name and a short description of each episode but the pictures are what I liked the most.<br /><br /> I would complain about is the shape of the box set. At first when I got it I loved it but then I watched all the episodes and I had to find a place to put it. It's long and skinny so I had to find a special place to store it because it didn't fit with the rest of my DVDs. This is a very minor problem and I would buy it again without thinking twice.  The other thing I didn't care for is that the disks aren't labeled with the season, you would either have to check the book or play the DVD to find out what season it's from. Season 5 is by far my favorite, I love when Chandler and Monica were hiding their relationship so I watch that season more often then the others.<br /><br />Overall this is a excellent buy. I would say to hold out for the price to decrease I bought mine for $93.10 but when I came to write this review I see the price is at $115.00 just two weeks later. I would still buy it for that price there will never be a show like this again. The cast is amazing and every episode is memorable.
B005LAIH5O|4.0|If you are looking for a lot of great acting and dialogue, you'll probably be disappointed. But if you like Greek mythology, especially the mythical creatures like Chimera, Cyclops, etc., and a lot of action, I think you will really like this movie. The special effects are very well done and the sound on the blu ray is very rich and full. The high definition picture quality is also very crisp and clear. I really enjoyed the scenes of Tartarus and Kronos. The only thing I think this movie was missing was some beautiful and scantily clad Greek maidens. But other than that, if you like Greek mythology I think you will really like this movie. Get it on blu ray though.
B0080R7P8A|5.0|This collection of unreleased tracks is SO GOOD, it almost makes their regular albums sound like outtakes.  With this much quality material, the only surprising thing here is why, (like Tago Mago), all of their releases weren't double albums.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|A gifted author who kept me on the edge of my seat throughout the entire novel!  Hovey created a truly believable story with characters I longed to live and succeed, hoping with them at every turn.

B003Y5HWMW|5.0|I've really enjoyed watching the first season, great characters & storyline. If you can find the BluRay, there is so much background materials about the families, lands & lore.

B005SFS4ZU|5.0|The quality of Blu Ray is put to great use with this video. The emotion felt by the cast (tears!) and sheer joy employed in portraying this tragic, classic story is transferred right off my home screen. I was totally enthralled immediately. It was difficult to believe I was not actually in the great Albert Hall with the rest of the audience, except my seat was infinitely better, even, than first row :-D! WOW! Great production, performances, staging and total-all-around evening at the opera. The signature tunes, especially \\"Music of The Night,\\" live up to any staged production I can imagine--plus they totally blew me away with the \\"surprise guests!!!!!!\\"

B0051UP5NQ|5.0|I LOVE this app!  All the other writing apps came with a limited number of stories (xWriter) and the one that came with the kindle (Quick Office)  was fourteen dollars, and you couldn't add documents.

Also, the app doesn't let me upload to fanfiction.net, which is the reason I purchased it...
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I was very worried about reading this book .I am not a sexual reader and I have never been a love story reader. But not since Stephen Kings Bag Of Bones or James Pattersons Kiss The Girls have I been so captivated by a novel. Thank you the reading was great . And from the little sex kitten in me the sexual experieces were interesting to say the least.This trilogy drew me in from page one in book one right thru the last page in book three.Ana and Christian are amazing together and I must say with all the abuse aside I think I am quite smitten with Christian . The mother in me wanted to hold him tight and tell him everything will be ok and the woman in me wanted to visit the red room of pain.I do have to wonder what this couple would be like in fifty years just a thought for the next novel.I would and have reccommended this book to everyone I have talked to.However I probably should have been on vacation when I started thi trilogy because reading three books in two days and working full time was tiring. thank you again this novel was a great reading book .

B007I1TFK0|5.0|I finally got the Blu-ray edition of Evita and it is simply superb! I wasn't exactly happy about the sound quality of the DVD edition but now, with even sharper images and brilliant sound, this modern classic gets the treatment it deserves on Blu-ray. Plus, there is a 42-minute movie-in-the-making, the wonderful teaser trailer of the film (I was entranced when I first saw this in theaters 16 years ago) and the video of the Oscar-winninng \\"You Must Love Me\\" which were not available in the DVD edition.<br /><br />With the fantastic audio-visuals of this timeless musical, I was so enthralled in watching Evita all over again and Madonna was simply brilliant in her final balcony scene and death scene that she succeeded in moving me to tears once again much like when I first saw this film on the wide screen. Making \\"Evita\\" was one of the best decisions Madonna ever made in her movie career since playing Eva Peron was truly the role of a lifetime. It is, therefore, an injustice that she was not even nominated for an Oscar and the film and director too. She deserved the Oscar that year! Nevertheless, Madonna's Golden Globe win as Best Actress was really much deserved and getting to play Evita (with so many acting and music highlights plus 90 beautiful costume changes) was already a reward in itself. Evita also won the Golden Globe for Best Picture and Best Song and was one of the year's Ten Best Films of the National Board of Review in 1996. Those awards were real affirmations of the film's excellence.<br /><br />For all lovers of musicals, please add Evita on Blu-ray in your list of must-haves. Madonna fans should be proud that Evita finally got the treatment it deserves on Blu-ray after 16 long years! Antonio Banderas and Jonathan Pryce also deserve special mention for also showing their best as Che and Juan Peron respectively. They were both brilliant in their roles. Kudos to Alan Parker for your vision and inspired direction. Evita will always be one of my favorite films of all time!
B0081HLM2E|4.0|This one is a killer-diller! Wow! The person who recommended this one to me deserves a medal. Hodejegerne, an R-rated Norwegian crime thriller (English captions), is exciting, involving, unpredictable and intelligent. It has relatable characters, a wonderful plot and is beautifully acted. We in the audience left the theater happily talking to ourselves.<br /><br />A skilled art thief hears of a priceless Rubens, stolen during WWII and kept in a private collection all these years. He realizes this could be the deal that puts him and his wife on easy street for the rest of their lives. Thus begins our story.<br /><br />We see:<br />  * Aksel Hennie (&quot;Age of Heroes&quot;) is our pint-sized cat burglar, impeccably groomed, smart as a whip and always trying to improve his theft of high-end art. His day job is to find and interview applicants for new executive positions.<br />  * Synnøve Macody Lund (TV roles) is his statuesque wife, blonde, successful and longing to have a baby. She owns an art gallery.<br />  * Nikolaj Coster-Waldau (&quot;Game of Thrones&quot;) is a former hi-tech special ops guy who wants the job as CEO of a company our hero represents. He has come to Norway to settle his aunt's estate.<br />  * Eivind Sander (&quot;Cupid's Balls&quot;) is our hero's fence and inside man for those pesky burglar alarms. Problem is, he rarely uses the brain in his big head. He and his libido entertain thousands on the Internet.<br />  * Reidar Sørensen (&quot;Home for Christmas&quot;) is the brilliant and politically astute detective who gets involved in the situation.<br /><br />This fast-moving plot sucks you in before you know it. There is tension, surprise, and impressive use of modern technology: GPS, cell phones and the Internet. Expect guns, knives, cars, trucks, attack dogs, and a farm tractor, plus a couple of really gross bits. There is little or no profanity or blowie uppie stuff. The two antagonists are Norwegian versions of the Energizer Bunny: they just won't quit! And I LOVE watching smart people try to outwit other smart people.<br /><br />This comes out on DVD at Amazon on 08-28-12. Brace yourself!
B0000CNY27|5.0|I really enjoyed receiving this product.  I have L.A. and New York and they both are very well very acted movies.
B007MAETA8|5.0|Ok, I must admit I was skeptical at first when I heard \\"Born & Raised\\" sounded a bit \\"country\\" to me...But I got it anyway since John Mayer has always been a favorite to me ever since I really sat down & listened to his lyrics. Does anyone else relate as intensely as I do to \\"Stop This Train\\" or \\"I Don't Trust Myself\\"? (Yes, Continuum is the album that hooked me forever on this musical mastermind...) But just listen to his words now on \\"Whiskey, Whiskey, Whiskey\\" & \\"If I Ever Get Around To Living\\" & you'll fall in love all over again with the magic that is John Mayer! His music is like nothing I've ever heard, it just takes you to a place you've never been before & you never want to leave...It's amazing to me that one person can keep coming up with such great music & lyrics, album after album...Such a rare talent, & we should all thank our lucky stars that this genious found the right outlet to share his talent with the rest of us! All I can say at this point is, WOW! HE DID IT AGAIN! But I'm really not surprised!!! Bottom line...BUY THIS ALBUM!!!

B004SJ3BCI|5.0|It is a challenging and fun game to play. Angry birds becomes a very addictive game. The levels get progressively harder.
B0000CBHOI|3.0|Scorsese is a genius. Sometimes he bites off more than he can chew. The Blues is not a story that can be told from a single perspective. Scorsese tells a great tale, excellent interviews and decent performances - but it's not the whole story, at best it's a great 'white mans history' of the blues.<br /><br />I watched in terror as the British artists pulled out their big gun 'Big Bill Broonzy'.  Broonzy influenced John Mayall and his disciples, a sweet blues player, but not the Moses of the blues that the British blues men believed him to be. Excuse the rant. Broonzy was a WWI veteran and a talented musician with a broad set of non- blues influences, thank heavens his take on the Blues landed in good hands.<br /><br />The side trips on skiffle (sorry mates, not purely British) were excellent, but Scorsese fails to clearly put the genre in context of the key subject matter - a sad omission.<br /><br />Back to reality - if you don't know where to start (who does?) this is a great spot. Take notes, read up on the artist and dig deeper. The Blues is a journey without end.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Terrible. This is $30 I wish I could get back. This so-called controversial trilogy is nothing but cheap smut. There's no depth to the plot; the plot is, in fact, extremely predictable. The characters have no depth, either. Both main characters are nothing but one cliche right after the other. Overly wealthy, super hot, damaged man unexplicably falls in love with a 20 something co-ed virgin who has no hobbies, no backbone, and no real beauty or wealth of her own? Yeah, right. All three books are full of shallow, uninteresting dialog followed by roughly 10 pages of perfectly choreographed sex that happens almost the same way every time. BORING! I could go on and on about how much I hated these books, but the point is this: if you're looking for a well written, well thought-out read, STEER CLEAR! If I could give this trilogy less than 1 star, I would.

B003Y5H5B0|1.0|To be honest, as of this writing I've only seen 33 minutes of the DVD, as I've had to force myself to watch that much (at three different viewings). I can't take more than a few minutes of this total piece of garbage before I just have to shut it off - I wish I could give it 0 stars (or less).<br />1. The two main actors are NOT funny (actually, they're irritating).<br />2. If you watch the trailer, it appears you've already seen all the humorous parts in this film?<br />3. Someone apparently decided stringing together long / numerous obscenities, childish sexual references, and unfunny slapstick passes as humor - I (along with a lot of other reviewers) do not.<br />4. Even though it's obviously not for adults, since young kids shouldn't watch it based on point 3 above, exactly who is this film's target audience?<br /><br />At this point, it's only 33 minutes of my life I'll never get back - I keep telling myself to give it a few more minutes, but at this point I don't know if I can stomach any more.<br />I'm embarrassed to use this disc as a coaster - target practice would be a more appropriate end for it.<br /><br />EDIT: Well I managed to slug through the entire thing, but it never gets better than my 33 minute review.
B005HHSXP0|5.0|The second book brings adventure fantasy and action which makes me never wanting to stop reading it. Its even so good that im always tired in the morning because i read it until like one Oclock in the morning which is very late.

B006FO3ERQ|3.0|I'm only a few chapters into this book but I felt I must speak up on behalf of twins, identical twins in particular. The author states, through the voice of his 1st-person main character, that he and his sister are fraternal twins, a distinction which is obvious since there aren't any opposite-sex identical twins. Being the twin snob that I am, I can't understand why fraternal twins are considered so unusual; they're simply brothers and sisters who share a birthday. They didn't share a placenta; they weren't a single egg at the time of conception, splitting into two only afterwards, which is a huge difference from two eggs being fertilized at different times (even if that difference is a few seconds, minutes, or hours apart). Do they really feel the same weird 'twin-ness' that real (identical) twins do? I know this will probably spark outrage amongst readers who are fraternal twins, but I just can't believe the main character and his sister really have all that much in common, so their relationship doesn't ring true for me. This is probably completely unrelated to the flow of the story for most readers but I couldn't ignore it. Other than that, the book is interesting so far.
B006H8BIIM|1.0|A game that is free should be completely free, and not have hiddien IAPs in them. Devs should ask for money straight up, without all the garbage with the IAPs.

0345803485|1.0|Wow, I thought I was the only woman on the planet who hated this piece of trash.  I couldn't wait to read it, even after Dr. Drew said it set women back 50 years, because all the women I talked to LOVED it, read them all, and were so sad that the series was over.  I downloaded it in March, 2012, because we were going on a cruise and I thought it would be the perfect vacation book.  After reading a few chapters I needed a vacation from the book.  Tried reading more of it a month later, because several friends said it would get better, but I still hated it.  I started thinking there was something wrong with me, because so many reviews said it \\"changed women's love lives\\", \\"it was a love story\\", blah, blah, blah.<br /><br />It was poorly written, like something that I would have done in high school.  I was on a plane, trying one more time to read this crap, when I decided that, if Ana mentioned her \\"inner goddess\\" one more time I was done.  Not only did she mention it once, but she mentioned it twice on the next two pages.  DONE!  I haven't picked it up since, and will be deleting it from my Kindle.<br /><br />What do women see appealing about whipping, bondage, contracts, controlling, and pain?  Nothing about it is sexy or \\"hot\\", at least not to this woman.

B000VUQ4HW|5.0|This is a powerful film, one which influenced many later ones -- and not just vampire movies*.  Its atmosphere and filming techniques have been much imitated.<br /><br />Interesting and amusing items that I happen to know:<br /><br />-- Many English speakers, learning that one of the things \\"schreck\\" means in German is \\"terror\\", presumed that \\"Max Schreck\\" was a stage name used only for this production.  From there, it grew into a \\"mystery\\" as to who really played the vampire (there was even a movie, \\"Mark of the Vampire\\", which proposed that Count Orlok was played by a real vampire).  In reality, Max Schreck was a popular leading man in early German films.<br /><br />-- The corporatist villain in \\"Batman Returns\\" was also called Max Schreck.<br /><br />-- The rats in the ship's hold have \\"hooded\\" pelts, meaning they are a domestic breed.<br /><br />*[SPOILER] Why do vampires die in Sunlight?

B004QOB8SO|5.0|got the first season and was completly hooked by the plot and the actors who protray Sherlock Holmes and Watson...their chemistry is believable and you sense the friendship and the respect for what each brings to the relationship and is a wonderful nod to the Holmes legacy by bringing it to modern times without losing any of the Holmes charm and mannerisms unique to Holmes..can't see it first run where I live so I have to wait until the DVDS come out and they don't disappoint, well worth the wait..I can't stress how good this is and would be a great piece to anyone's DVD collection.
0142403873|5.0|After \\"The Gruffalo\\" and \\"Snail and the Whale\\", I can say with confidence that we are Julia Donaldson fans.  The Gruffalo is the most entertaining children's book we've read in the two years that we've been reading children's books to our two-year-old daughter.  Clever and funny, we enjoy reading this book again and again - literally (no pun intended), our daughter wants to read the same book over and over again right now, and if you are going to incessantly read the same book over and over again, The Gruffalo and Julia Donaldson are as good as it gets!!<br />PS - We've read enough crappy children's books to believe any yahoo can have a children's book published, Julia Donaldson really does stand out as exceptional.
B006H8BIIM|2.0|This is a good looking game! The HD graphics are top notch and look very smooth on my Tablets.<br /><br />The game makes a reasonable attempt at a plot with a fairly predictable,yet, reasonably engaging story about aliens attacking. Nothing groundbreaking, but , still better than no storyline.<br /><br />The gameplay is fairly bland. The basic, ultra-repetitive &quot;Tower Defense&quot; game mechanic that drives this game is exactly what you would expect from this kind of game. Events transpire a little too slowly in the game for it to ever feelexciting,however,the thin plotline and better than average graphics are enough incentive to drive a player to complete the game.<br /><br />This would be a solid 4 star game were it not for the integrated IAP, which certainly does not belong in a paid app,but,also would utterly nullify any challenge or enjoyment the game might offer if purchased.<br /><br />The IAP garbage that this greedy scumbag double-dipper of a developer has integrated into this otherwise decent game does NOT sell anything that cannot be earned through gameplay, and the game is not balanced in a way that tries to force the user to commit IAP, so, it is not gamebreaking.<br /><br />4 stars for graphics,  gameplay,  sound ,story and fun factor.<br /><br />-2 Stars for integrated IAP ripoff scam

B006G2124E|5.0|Ten stars are too few!  I have watched this video 5 or 6 times now and still feel deeply inspired by it each time.  I haven't read the book, and usually I find movies adapted from books to come up way short.  But I can't imagine the book being any more remarkable or profound than this performance is.  The acting is truly outstanding and the story told long overdue.  Bravo and thank you to all who had a hand in it.

B005G4TJUC|4.0|This movie was just as good as the other 2! Some plot twists...some surprises. I only had 2 complaints. One is that Optimus Prime was a little weird in this one. Needed a little more time with his character. During the action I did not find myself saying where is Optimus...why isn't he helping in the fight...then all of a sudden he shows up and \\"saves\\" the day. If we had spent just a few minutes with him to know his internal struggle we would have cheered when he showed up after disappearing from the fight so long. At the very least we should have flashed over to his struggle in the wires a few times to see how hard he was fighting to help his autobots. The second complaint is the prevalence of language in this one. Really...was all the cursing really necessary? It wasn't necessary in the first 2 movies. What's the deal?
B000066C6Z|5.0|This little gem of a comedy was passed over by most critics but I find it hilarious.

B006LSZECO|2.0|This was a great book.. couldn't put it down!  Ummm... then the end was near and I was hoping for something clever, so much of the book is clever, I swore it would come.  It never did.  I had guessed two or three other shocking and juicy endings, which would have fit with the rest of the book, but I reached the last page and yelled, \\"That's it?!?!\\"... Okay, I didn't yell, but my brain screamed.<br /><br />All along I was thinking of my friends that would love this read... but I can't recommend it, the ending is so lame, unbelievable for those characters.
B001NEXEEG|5.0|I first saw this film as a little girl, and I've watched it probably dozens of times since then.  I have the dialogue almost memorized--there are so many classic lines!  (\\"I'll teach you law...western law!\\")  The acting is great, and though it's a serious film about serious subjects, there's a lot of humor.  But at the same time, it gives you a lot to think about.<br /><br />Kudos to Amazon for making this available free through their streaming Prime movies program.
B008CJ0KEM|5.0|On the grimy streets of Toronto, there are magical, ancient beings that humans are not even aware of.<br /><br />And as a young succubus named Bo discovers, a life among them is a dangerous, weird one. \\"Lost Girl Season 1\\" is a brilliant premiere season for a very unique, sexy and gritty series, which imagines all mythical creatures as various breeds of fae -- and between the strong cast and witty writing, it's an absolute joy.<br /><br />For years, Bo (Anna Silk) has drifted from city to city, sucking the life-force from people via sex/kisses. But after she rescues a young thief named Kenzi (Ksenia Solo) by killing an attempted rapist, she is captured by the Fae leaders, the Ash (light Fae) and the Morrigan (dark Fae). Since she has no idea who she is, they put her to an ancient test.<br /><br />But Bo chooses neither the Light nor the Dark. She still gets some allies among the Fae, including werewolf cop Dyson (Kristen Holden-Ried), human doctor Lauren (Zoie Palmer) and the pleasant but mysterious bartender Trick (Rick Howland).<br /><br />Because she belongs to neither side, Bo and Kenzi turn out to be perfect supernatural detectives: missing college girls, a jealous fury, missing treasure, a body-hopping Hsien, a fae-killing toxin, a crooked country club, a spider with a deadly power, a family feud, a string of supernatural suicides, and Dyson being accused of murder. And while she does this, Bo searches for her mysterious origins -- only to find that the truth is much worse than she could have imagined.<br /><br />A show about the adventures of a beautiful young succubus sounds... well, like the premise for a porn movie, not a fantasy-noir series. But while it has some steaminess (sometimes played for laughs), \\"Lost Girl\\" is mainly about Bo solving various odd cases among the Fae, even as she searches for her family.<br /><br />But it has a lot of deliciously funny moments, usually from Kenzi (\\"Best case scenario: I am a toe-sucking cannibal!\\") and there's a running love triangle between Bo, Lauren and Dyson. And the setting has a gritty, punky urban feel, with Bo and Kenzi living in a boarded-up \\"crack shack\\" and and dressing in lots of leather.<br /><br />And the cast of this series is really superb -- Silk manages to be sensual without being cartoonish, especially since Bo is a genuinely nice person with deep-rooted morals. Holden-Ried is amazing as the hard-nosed cop who falls completely in love with her; and Howland is AWESOME -- half kindly bartender, half hidden power. The one actor I couldn't quite connect with was Palmer, who always has a weird half-smirk on her face.<br /><br />But the star of the series is Ksenia Solo. She steals every scene she's in with her quirky, clever, sometimes light-fingered Kenzi, who manages to stay afloat in Fae society despite being human.<br /><br />\\"Lost Girl Season 1\\" is one of the best urban-fantasy series of recent years -- gritty and magical, sexy and spooky.

B000MDHJFE|3.0|If you enjoy jazz and Duke Ellington (who wrote and performed the score, and even did a cameo), you will love the music to this film.  But even then, the music is way too loud (often obscuring dialogue), omnipresent, and distractingly mismatched with the storyline.  If the film had been set in New Orleans, it would have made more sense.  But Upper Peninsula Michigan??  And, since I hate jazz, it made it difficult for me to sit through much of the film.<br /><br />The story itself is okay.  I know that experts rate this as one of the best trial films ever made, but I don't see it.  And what makes for accuracy doesn't always translate to entertainment.  Still, the pacing isn't too bad, and the court scenes are okay, but it's nothing special.<br /><br />The one shining aspect of this film is the acting.  Jimmy Stewart is excellent, as always, Lee Remick is younger than I've ever seen her, and George C. Scott, even at this early point in his career, is showing the brilliance he had ahead.<br /><br />Overall, it wasn't a bad film, and the actors make up for the shortcomings.
1455518999|4.0|It starts off kind of slow and then it begins its creep. Better than half way through you are still wondering where you are headed but there is somewhat of an inkling where he is taking you. Suddenly all things begin to fall in place and you grasp exactly what is coming. It's enough to make you fearful. Knowing this is fiction it still gives you the feeling that the possibility could be there. The last fifty pages really rounds off the book and leaves you well satisfied with a great novel. I have read most of his novels and this rates right up with his best. Keep them coming David,your a excellent writer.

B007NYODBS|1.0|I enjoy watching movies and I like just about any genre, but this is one of the worst movies I have seen.  The entire movie is one afternoon with two couples.  I rented it because of the stars, but I am so very sorry I did.  It is not worth the .99 or $1.99 I paided for it.  Save yourself the 2 hours it took to watch it.

B007V508CC|3.0|It is crazy to believe that 10 years ago the world was introduced to a new innovative sound in music know as Maroon 5. Since then, this quintet has been one of the true staples of fantastic music in a world that is currently lost to pop, meaningless music. Little did I know that I was going to be surprised with Maroon 5's 4th release earlier than anticipated.<br /><br />The best way to describe `Overexposed' is imagine if the song `Moves Like Jagger' had 10 bastard children. Now, I am by no means saying that this album is terrible, but it is just not Maroon 5. The past three records that they have given us are soulful and beautiful, a true breath of fresh air next to the mainstream we are with today. Now, they have officially joined that mass collective and gave us an extremely poppy and catchy album that makes me wonder why. There are some hints of the old Maroon 5 soul in this album, with songs like `Sad' & `Beautiful Goodbye'. Also the deluxe edition comes with 3 great bonus tracks including a truly original recreation of Princes' hit `Kiss'. The rest of this album is just pop music taboo that easily sucks you in and makes you listen to the songs over and over again because you just can't get them out of your head. When I first heard `Harder To Breathe' I will admit I was not a fan, but the rest of `Songs About Jane' was just so amazing they grew on me.  Again, the songs on `Overexposed' are not terrible, but knowing where Maroon 5 came from, I hope I don't end getting pushed away from them.<br /><br />I don't know why Maroon 5 needed to head in this direction. I doubt it is for relevance, because they have been ever since they emerged onto the scene. Whatever message they are trying to send, I don't like it and I am hoping that this new sound they are giving us isn't permanent.
B0058YPG2K|5.0|This is the best current running show on tv so I can't give it a bad rating.<br />The finale was the best I have ever seen.<br />The BlueRay DVD is off somewhat  though. The subtitles are not automatically on.<br />When you switch it on from the main menu, all English and Spanish subtitles come on.<br />This is a hassle that you should not have to deal with. If the show was run on AMC with subtitles on for Spanish than that's what we should see when we buy the DVD.<br />Other than that I have nothing bad to say.<br />The best show on tv.

B00845PV16|1.0|I couldn't even stand to watch more than an hour of this and I just turned it off. I mean WTF?! I LOVED the first one, but this one was just terrible!!! I would not waste my money on this if I were you, infact I feel pretty horrible that I spent $1.00 on this as a rental. If they wanted to make a second one they should have stuck with the same producer, because this new guy just screwed the story up completely. And the worst part is that Cage is usually an okay actor, but he was terrible in this film. Absolutely HORRIBLE!! Don't waste your money. I would have given it zero stars if I could.
0812973992|4.0|Someone once said that a pessimistic economist is so much more likely bo be perceived as \\"serious\\" than one who is more optimistic. I wonder if the same thinking applies to fiction. Are serious/high-brow novels sort of expected to be pessimistic or, rather, grittily realistic?<br /><br />I wish we had more great works of fiction that would abandon the beautiful-loser/missed-opportunity/tortured-soul path in favour of some grandiose and possibly humourous storytelling (no, I don't have statistics about the exact percentages of the two).<br /><br />Colum McCann's \\"Let the Great World Spin\\" is a greatly accomplished novel, as the cover blurb is eager to point out. Yet it's also one of those melancholic books that I was mentioning just before.<br /><br />The language is beautiful, and if write this too often is simply because I tend to read beautifully-written novels, the plot is engaging but...everything is sad and it eventually made me think about so many novels of this kind and, conversely, so few of the happy-variety, ultimately get awards. Of course McCann isn't to be blamed, he just happened to be the tipping point in my thinking.<br /><br />\\"Let The Great World...\\" is about several interlocking narratives, all of which are set  in 1974, when Philippe Petit, a French tighrope walker, famously crossed the empty space between the Twin Towers. Petit is the only real-life character in the novel and he appears only briefly but he somehow sets in motion (\\"spinning\\", you could say) the other facts narrated in the book.<br /><br />A radical Irish Monk, a mother-daughter prostitute duo, a judge, a failed artist, etc. Those are the main characters whom McCann uses to tell the story of NYC in a specific time. As I wrote, enjoyable and very elegantly done. Now give me some humour, please.
B003MOHX8S|5.0|This CD is in my \\"Top-10 Favorite CD's\\" of all-time.<br /><br />I wanted to find strong, epic music, that I could listen to at work.  I did not want any music with singing, because it's distracting and I can't concentrate. This CD is absolutely excellent.  Every single song is fantastic.  If you want hard, strong, soundtracks that have hardcore emotions, then this CD will do it for you.  I never get tired of listening to this music.  And depending on which song is playing, I end-up typing faster and doing my work stronger than ever, because of the rhythm and sound of the song.  I love this CD.  It's one of the best buys that I've made in several years.  Several people at work asked me what I was listening to, because they thought the music was great.  They went and bought this CD, and they've thanked me several times (or they wouldn't have known about it).  DO I RECOMMEND IT:  absolutely, hands-down.  Excellent music. Simply excellent.  If you want singing, mushy, love songs or pop music, don't buy this CD or any of it's songs.

0765316994|4.0|John Scalzi's Redshirts has an interesting premise based on what has become a humorous standard in the Star Trek universe.  Every fan of the show knows that the last thing you want to wear in an episode is the dreaded \\"red shirt.\\"  Traditionally throughout the show, the red shirts die episode after episode.  They get obliterated by death rays, eaten by creatures, die from toxic poisons and diseases, etc.<br /><br />Scalzi makes the \\"death sentence\\" a real thing in his latest novel, and he does it with such tongue-in-cheek humor that I was laughing out loud during several scenarios.  I dare you to read the opening chapter and not be intrigued enough to see how far the writer goes with his premise.  Scalzi twists and bends and just takes the idea so far out there that you'll find yourself turning pages just to see which Star Trek trope gets outed next.<br /><br />Andrew Dahl, the main character, is the perfect vehicle for this story.  As a character, he's just deep enough to get a clear view of the field and all the players, and is a great catalyst to just keep moving things along.  I loved his background and the way he became disenchanted with different past experiences and ultimately ended up in the Universal Union.  Yet, it's these past experiences that allow Dahl to ultimately see what's going on and to save the day.<br /><br />Scalzi has always had a great ear for dialogue, but in this novel he truly excels.  Reading the book is effortless, and the conversations between the characters really scintillate, providing comic relief and a deeper understanding of the scenes.<br /><br />The novel reads very episodically in places, but that can't be helped.  Without those episodic pieces, the true gist of the lampooning of Star Trek (though I feel this was done with a loving hand) wouldn't be the same.<br /><br />Redshirts is a lot different from his other books in many regards.  Old Man's War sucked me in and wouldn't let me go until the final page, and I enjoyed the sequels as well.  Scalzi fans looking for something like that won't find that otherworldliness and sense of adventure in these pages.  Still, the book is an enjoyable and diverting read.  Think of it as a Scalzi sorbet, something to cleanse the palate after serious reading.  Or maybe as the \\"reset\\" button in those old Star Trek episodes.omething like that won't find that otherworldliness and sense of adventure in these pages.

Good news is I'm not crazy. Bad news is I just spent like $15 on something that my 17 year old cousin could have written. How the heck is this on New York Time's Bestseller list? Is America really THAT impressed with freaky sex that they'll completely forgoe good writing? Truly disappointing, but that'll teach me to do some research before buying the next \\"hot\\" new Bestseller.

I could defineately see the Twilight similarities but it was a very good read.  I enjoyed all the characters whether it was love or dislike.  If you are looking for an enjoyable kind of trashy read you'll love it.  Let's face it we read to escape to a different place for a little while and I did enjoy being in Christian Grey's world for a little while.  I say again I loved this book and the rest of the series.  I will tell you if you read this you need to have the second book handy it's a must read.  All I can say is read it, enjoy it and don't take offense to a fictional story.

The firebrand of 410HZ was being carried in a litter with a slave on either side to fan him as he played his lute. A baggage-train trooped behind him. Ahead of them strode Cato, his trusty man-servant who was hacking his way through the jungle with a machete.<br /><br />\\"The Mayans were chronometers of Eternity,\\" the cleric added in falsetto. \\"Time and space are foundational concepts in music. Such a pyramid, if indeed it exists, must be dedicated to the Lord of these Realms. It could very well redefine our understanding of music and refute all that 19th century gibberish!\\"<br /><br />Cato paused in the one-hundred percent humidity to regain his breath.<br /><br />\\"Don't dawdle, my trusty man-servant! Choppy, choppy!\\"<br /><br />Cato looked longingly at his machete.  After bestowing a glare on his master, he resumed his thankless task. One hour later, just as he was about to collapse on the spot, they entered a semi-clearing where the vegetation was thinner. Much to their astonishment, the outlines of a pyramid were visible in the undergrowth.<br /><br />\\"I was right all along,\\" Father Melchizedek whooped from his litter. \\"Roll over Howard Carter! Immortality becomes me! Cato, don't just stand there with your mouth open! Fetch me some water and my crosier!\\"<br /><br />The pyramid was clearly Mayan. Hieroglyphs covered much of its surface. The main entrance had been sealed off and covered by many a vine; as they were cleared away, an inscription emerged above the lintel. Above it was a spandrel: it depicted a bald-headed man sitting at some sort of keyboard and holding a scroll or diploma. His visage was sacerdotal.<br /><br />\\"The Mayans can't have been that prophetic,\\" Cato murmured in wonder. \\"Why, that's Anton Br - !\\"<br /><br />\\"Tut, tut, my trusty man-servant ! I will hear none of that `Heldenwhine and Heldenwhoop'! Besides the gentleman in question is clearly a Mayan practitioner of HIP, seated at a harpsichord which plays at the so-called French pitch (a 396)! Now Cato I pay you for your brawn and not your brain but sometimes the latter comes in handy. Translate that inscription for me!\\"<br /><br />Cato stared up at the script.<br /><br />\\"There appears to be nine separate incantations. The High Priest is a notary called Eugen Jaguar-King. The edifice is indeed dedicated to Time and Eternity. He says there are two pyramids: one red, the other yellow.  This is the latter and the more imposing of the two (the red pyramid is brusque in design and crumbly at that [[ASIN:B00004YA0T Bruckner: The Complete Symphonies]]). The First Incantation is strongly magical with the exception of the last quartile which appears to be somewhat rushed. The Second Incantation could use a more fulsome script - I have seen the text before and it appears that the High Priest has excised some key passages, particularly in the last quartile - but the third quartile of the Incantation is marvellous in its invocation of cosmic longing. I have seen the Third Incantation elsewhere; it is a highly dramatic spell though its author could never make up his mind as to a definitive sacred text. Here, an abridged version is used and stunningly at that. The Fourth Incantation is dedicated to the Gods of the Forest. It is lyrical and powerful - I would not say that it shades other such renditions. The Fifth Incantation is consecrated to the Cosmos. It was inscribed at an earlier date than its companions - therefore the sacred script is somewhat thin. Even so, in its majesty and power it has few rivals. The Sixth Incantation packs a real punch. It is quieter and more reposed than usual - not that there is anything wrong with that. Its last quartile can ramble on but here it is succinctly held together. The Seventh Incantation - wow, look at that - is clearly the most potent spell here. Everything about it seems right. The coda at the end of the first quartile is rendered with immense skill and subtlety. This Seventh Incantation contains an elegy - how magisterially it is conveyed here. I don't like the look of the Eighth Incantation. There is something wrong; the script lacks assurance; it meanders if not warbles along. I have seen this prayer elsewhere in a more authoritative text - the script in use here is an inferior one. All in all, it is the most feeble incantation here and a critical slip at that. The Ninth Incantation is dedicated to the Mayan Underworld and the Sky-God. It is powerful and brooding. The Incantation breaks off at the end - it lacks a fourth quartile - but the third quartile is valedictory enough to wind up proceedings. All in all, I am impressed. I have visited the Red Pyramid in person. Its architecture was loud and brash; it was shoddily rendered and the elements have eroded it away. Here, the pyramid is far more stout. It may not outlast eternity - like all things, it has an appointed end - but it is a suitable enough hymn to its nemesis. The script itself is written in a flowing manner - it jumps around less than its counterpart at the Red Pyramid.\\"<br /><br />\\"Yes, yes, yes: that's all very interesting my trusty man-servant! The real question is to what extent the music of the Mayans was shaped by dance steps and rhythms: corants, allmains, sarabands, morris dances, and stately pavins, interspersed with more contrapuntal `aires' and `fantazys'. And the more I think about it, that's Giovanni Battista Bassani in the spandrel!\\"<br /><br />While Father Melchizedek was trumpeting these words of wisdom, Cato ran a hand over the masonry. Something clicked, and the door which led into the heart of the pyramid swung open.<br /><br />\\"Master, here is your great opportunity!\\" Cato whispered seductively. \\"What if they buried the Jaguar King with lutes and recorders made of gold ! It's `finders - keepers' if you ask me!\\"<br /><br />A glazed look came over the pinched face of the cleric. Without so much of a word of thanks, he trotted pig-like into the heart of the pyramid. Cato quickly felt out the masonry and the door shut resoundingly behind the cleric. He then turned to the native porters:<br /><br />\\"Now, who's up for a beer?\\"n usual - not that there is anything wrong with that.

B003Y5H5HY|2.0|For those of you who have been out of the loop re the Millennium series recently, it was announced as far back as January 2010 that Fincher would be attached to the American Dragon Tattoo film. This sparked a mixed reaction, from people who even love Fincher like there's no tomorrow. Well, it looks like people are still high off their wankery over The Social Network, another mediocre and spectacularly overrated movie. So it seems obvious the circle jerk would continue in the wake of the recent Dragon Tattoo adaptation.<br /><br />Problem is, there seems to be Two David Finchers. The one who made amazing movies Like Se7en, The Game, Fight Club, Panic Room and The Zodiac. Then there's the Fincher who gave us the horrid Benjamin Button, the overrated above mentioned Social Network, and now this.<br /><br />Thing is, I for one wasn't too opposed the idea of an English language adaptation. I mean, sure it wouldn't be as authentic as the original Swedish version, nor the book. But it could still work. Craig still had the face and Mara has very striking facial features. Reznor has a unique way of scoring a film, and Fincher has a great eye for a shot, hell, he practically made a whole career our of that kind of thing.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the movie is nowhere near as interesting as the Swedish movie. And here's why.<br /><br />The Swedish movie does a good job at staying close to the source material, however, it doesn't just mindlessly piggyback off of the source material- it perfectly balanced everything out. Those who haven't read the book would be able to follow it and find it entertaining. It took its time too- it had a nice, steady, easy going pace. It was 2.5 hours, but the movie was so interesting, it went by fast and you couldn't tell.<br /><br />The Yank version is pretty much an exact adaptation of the book, yes. Pretty much 98% of the book was in the movie. That's NOT a good thing; to me it came off as nothing more than desperate to please the fans. It was like Zallian said \\"Alright, we have to mindlessly piggyback the book. I'm super scared of pissing the fans off, and so let's not edit anything down. There is no such thing as 'What may work on page doesn't necessarily work on film.'\\". Except... there is.<br /><br />Let me explain why.<br /><br />Niels' film showed RESTRAINT and SUBTLETY, the two things this film lacked. It focused more on the characters than every single tiny little plot device of the book. This film felt rushed and blew its way through everything. For example, the opening scene. In Niels' film, it's very powerful. The way he looks at the plant then breaks down is simply... stunning. Here? We got a half assed phone call and a shot of the plant.<br /><br />The opening credits, however, are class. Pointless, overly flashy and a bit gimmicky? Yes, but class, and the images fit very nicely over the Immigrant Song. I loved the shout outs to the sequels too.<br /><br />Unfortunately it stops there, the writer Zallian is so obsessed with capturing every event that he senselessly skips over CHARACTER DETAILS!!!!! We get no hint to the fact that Lisbeth is possibly autistic. Instead we get a scenery chewing girl who we want to punch in the face every time we see her. The whole libel thing goes over our heads completely too.<br /><br />And that's just the beginning.<br /><br />Several of the scenes are over before they even begin. It's frustrating. The rape scene was underwhelming even. In the book it was a disturbing and powerful scene. Here it's just a \\"lol wut\\" moment.<br /><br />As for the acting. Noomi Rapace simply cannot be replaced. She played Lisbeth exactly how the books describe her. Tough as nails, arrogant, and dangerous to herself, but with an air of special childlike innocence. Mara? She confuses good acting for chewing the scenery. She always glares and says every line like someone asked her the square root of an insanely large number. Nyqvist not only played Blomkvist just like Larsson wrotehim, but he also LOOKED like the book described. Here, Craig just seems to be stuck in his Bond phase. Nothing special whatsoever.<br /><br />Also, for parts 2 and 3, someone needs to hire a better dialect coach. I lost count of all the times they went from American to British to a Europeanoid accent. What a joke.<br /><br />I wish I could recommend this, but it's a big mess. Avoid if you haven't watched the Swedish and just watch that instead.<br /><br />Fincher, thou hast ruined Lisbeth Salander for me.him, but he also LOOKED like the book described.

B0076NAWWA|5.0|I dig just about everything on this album including the second song released for radio consumption, Shoulda Coulda Woulda, but it doesn't seem to be consistent with the rest of the CD. As far as a description, one might think Steve Winwood meets Toto on steroids.  In my world of crossover Prog, it rocks, although there's a jazzy bent to some of the songs that keep grabbing my attention. I particularly dig Kayla that comes complete with a Yes-ian vocal interlude and in my reality would be a radio hit. For some of you, some of the songs may seem like pop, but if pop were like this album, I wouldn't have quit listening to the radio many years ago.  There's plenty of variety, styles and textures, including the 10cc-like poppy Love Is What I'm Waiting For that sounds like a 70's AM radio hit.  It's followed up with the anthemic Everything Changes featuring Santana-ish guitar throughout the song. Better than walking Away pulls on the heart strings with harmonies and a style reminiscent of Journey.  All Falls Down seemingly was included to fulfill the short technical program to verify musicianship by all group members.  There's a Elvin Bishop quality to Fool In My Heart that reminds me of Fooled around and Fell in Love.  BTW, my favorite track is probably the opening song, Blue Ocean that could have been the theme for Winwood's next album.  The album culminates in a 12 minute long program Infinite Fire, just to prove these guys are Progladytes.  It rocks.  It fuses.  It jazzes.  It is prog.  It may not break any new ground, but it massages the landscape with flying colors.

0393080269|5.0|There were some very detailed reviews on the book so the only thing remaining is to join the 5 star chorus. Again, I am not a professional economist and consider myself rather illiterate in this area.  The point is that a professional may have a different point of view on many subjects including commodity prices, future growth of China and such (compare to Peter Schif, for example).  Why this book was interesting for me it is the unusual and unorthodox approach to many things like, for example, some time positive role of authoritarian regimes in economic development of their respective countries.  The other (practical) conclusion is a confirmation of the old advice to avoid excessive risk and overexposure to asset classes which one doesn't actually understand (stick to target retirement funds, everybody:-).
B007MAETA8|5.0|This album is something unlike anything I have heard from John Mayer.  It is kind of country with a subtle folk sound.  I enjoy this album thoroughly, especially Queen of California. It's a must for any soft music fan.

B007SBZ0YU|5.0|This CD has it all... The first track sets the tone of the album and flows nicely into nice a lyrical melody that resembles something like the work of the Fleet Foxes. other tracks remind me of T.V. on the Radio with some kind of African influence. Throughout the CD there are thick guitar riffs, heavy beats and beautiful lyrical tones that remind me at times of Thom Yorke (Radiohead). Some songs like \\"Breezeblocks\\" are catchy and fun while others like \\"Bloodfood\\" are ambient and full of intricate and subtle textures. \\"Fitzpleasure\\" (to me) is the gem of the album with an almost Dub/ Folk sound that is like nothing I have ever heard before.  The final track of the album reiterates the diversity of this young and upcoming band by taking us into a Bollywood type groove that is beautifully constructed. This album does not have a single bad track on it and has very quickly entered my top 20 list for all time albums. A must have!!!
0345803493|2.0|I don't know what all the hype is about.  I read the first and was slightly interested enough to buy the second.  But after a few chapters I gave it up.  If you cannot feel any thing for the characters, why read it?  Perhaps my own imagination is rich enough not to care about the sexual fantasy of the books because I find it down right boring.

I loved it I didn't think I would love a good more than fifty shades of grey but it did the trick I so can't wait for the second book to come out in october that is the only thing that I was disappointed in having to wait! but I can tell you the book ended in a manner that I was good.  Highly recommend!! read more on my blog iloveladyporn.com

I would not recommend it to anyone who has read previous books. Might be good for my kids once they get older though.

Cal suddenly single and clueless turns to a ladykiller named Jacob (Ryan Gosling) who enables him to become like him. Jacob, in turn, doesn't know that HE is truly looking for something of what Cal HAD in his marriage until he meets Hannah (Emma Stone)who also seems adrift in her own relationship.

159514188X|4.0|Upon returning home from school one afternoon, Clay Jenkins discovers a box of cassette tapes in which his crush Hannah Baker explains the thirteen reasons why she committed suicide. Over the course of one night, Clay's perception of life morphs as he reacts to Hannah's tragic story. I was prepared to be annoyed at this book--I thought it would glorify vengeful suicide. However, I was pleasantly surprised. I was immediately drawn in to Hannah's story. I could hardly put it down. I was impressed that there was very little bitter vengefulness expressed. Mostly, she just wanted to be understood. Her story shows the reader in horrifying detail how the little not-so-nice things we do might have a huge impact on others. It's a story that tells us to look at the way we treat other people...and to pay attention to the signals that they're sending. It is a heartrending story, and was emotionally difficult for me to get through, but I think it has the potential to change the way teenagers view their own actions. It's also an amazing hard-to-put-down story.
B0056BU3I2|3.0|This review is just about the Blu-ray disc itself. For me this is an excruciating poor BD to navigate.<br />I have an older Panasonic BD30 player, and I realize that that might make things extra slow for me.<br />But this disc is slow to load and as happens on Blu-ray Discs at their worst, I pay a steep penalty for watching a feature on the extras menu - at the end of every feature I have to wait what seems like a really long time for the disc to return me the the previous menu. Also, pausing the disc too long puts me into some sort of Universal wallpaper that offers no clue as to how to get back to where I was. It was trial and error to find a remote sequence that worked, and in one case I just had to power down/power up the player to get off this screen. Super annoying, and I know this can be part of BDs in general bit this disc is as bad as I've seen in that regard.<br />There is a lot of interesting extra content to watch, but the super-annoying BD process wastes a lot of time in between them. Sometimes I like to browse these or skim them to see if they are interesting to me. Or if I'm short on time, power watch the extras. But there's no way to get through these fast and that's BD at its most annoying.

B004VQFQ2Q|5.0|When this came out many loyal Sabbath fans hated it. I personally loved it. Thing is I knew better than to judge it as a stereotypical \\"Sabbath\\" record. When Ozzy left many Sabbath fans hated Dio in them as it brought a whole new sound to the band. Then after a few yrs. the new Sabbath got itself a whole new fan-base -sure some of the past but mainly ones that loved the new more-so than the old. Then when Dio split and Ian Gillan entered the same was about to happen except as we all know the marriage lasted but a short time. As a heavy album it is awesome. This is DEFINITELY Sabbath but just not TYPICAL Sabbath with any stereotypes attached if you're expecting the \\"Ozzyesque\\" type of Sabbath or the Dio style either. It is a great Sabbath album in its own right and deserves much more credit than it was given.<br /> The original recording was not a big seller and was found on all of the clearance racks quick. Then when CDs came out someone made the mistake of putting this one to CD and again... nobody bought it so it was again found on all of the $5 racks that one would see in convenience stores or record shops. Recently when I got the urge to hear this I realized I had lost my copy through the years somewhere and went to find it at the local used CD shop all but positive that I would find it there - cheap. Yet - over a course of a year it never showed. Finally I checked the local mall - not there and then I went to Ebay and they wanted over $25... then to Amazon and again with shipping almost $20 for the cheapest! I was shocked! Where was the cheap CD everyone hated I asked!? Well come to find out they remastered it in 2011 and this version was the only one found now. I thought how terrible the original production was and thought how good could they have fixed what was bad from the get-go and I was pleasantly surprised. The production on this remaster is MUCH better than the original and it was GREAT to hear all of these hidden gems again. If anything as a 40yr old adult I appreciate it more now than I ever did. From the balls to the wall \\"TRASHED\\" to the bone-chilling scream at the entrance of \\"Disturbing the Priest\\" and the heavy bass and drums that give a beat as a heartbeat of some type of demon throughout the song to the best song on the album \\"Born Again\\" - one of the best Sabbath songs EVER made in my opinion. Top three for me actually. That song is as \\"Sabbath\\" as the song Black Sabbath is but more mature -dark and well... evil. NO other singer BUT Ian Gillan could have possibly done that song any better. In fact the same could be said of that whole album. The biggest shame about this album is that it ends without a follow up album but the second disk in this giving me more after all of these years was like a gift from... well I'd say God but I am not sure it fits so well in this case (and I dare say nobody else!). To hear \\"The Fallen\\" a previously unreleased song and then the extended version of \\"Stonehenge\\" was so great! It is like a Metallica fan hearing after all of these years a new version of say \\"(Anesthesia) - Pulling Teeth\\" before slamming into WHIPLASH... it is making what is already a classic and a pillar of perfection into something even better... to make it ....almost holy! (Did I just say that referring to Sabbath?)and THEN as an added bonus to hear live Hot Line - War Pigs - Black Sabbath - The Dark - Zero the Hero (another GREAT song) - Digital Bitch - Iron Man - SMoke On the Water (from when Ian Gillan was the singer with Deep Purple for any youth out there that may have no clue who Ian Gillan is) and then Paranoid. I personally would have liked to have heard him sing more of the better Sabbath songs and not the ones played out so much by every radio station known to man but hey... a gift is a gift! In the end I would have spent $40 for this CD as it is well worth it in my opinion... and coming from someone who is so frugal that I usually NEVER buy any CD new rather used through my local used CD shop orhere on Amazon that is saying QUITE a bit. My ol' lady on the other hand wasn't as impressed with the album... or maybe her attitude was because I was blasting it at 6am this Sunday morning... but hey... it's SABBATH! Who can blame me?<br /> Bottom Line: GET THE REMASTERED VERSION put out in 2011 it is WELL worth the money they are asking!

0439023521|4.0|In the future, North America has transformed itself into a country known as Panem.  Twelve districts, whose populations are in general underfed, produce different products (coal, agricultural goods, etc.) to serve the needs of the central city known as Capitol.  To keep the twelve outlying districts under Capitol's heel, every year each of the districts is required to select two tributes -- one boy and one girl between the ages of twelve and eighteen -- to fight it out in a televised to-the-death free-for-all known as the Hunger Games.  Twenty-four kids placed in an arena disguised to look like a natural landscape spend approximately two weeks hunting each other down until only one survives.  The winner, along with their home district, are lavished with wealth and prizes.<br /><br />The Hunger Games were created by Capitol after it suppressed an organized uprising of the districts many decades before.  The author makes it clear that the Games are generally reviled by the inhabitants of the outlying districts.  But under the memory of the failed rebellion and Capitol's continued repression, there is little the districts appear to be able to do.<br /><br />Enter Katniss Everdeen.  After her younger sister is selected for the Games, Katniss volunteers to take her place.  Thrust into the myriad preparations for the games, Katniss must cope with the alien environment of Capitol and must quickly adapt to navigate her way through the Games' preparations.  As if this is not enough, Katniss must also cope with some mixed feelings about her district's male tribute, Peeta Mellark.<br /><br />But Capitol and its many differences to her home district along with any mixed feelings she has about Peeta quickly fade when the twenty-four tributes enter the arena.  Because in the arena, everyone is an enemy and Katniss will have to keep all of her wits about her to try and stay alive...<br /><br />I'll admit, Hunger Games turned about better than I was expecting it to be.  The characters are engaging and believable.  Katniss is a strong heroine.  And where the author really went right with this book is that we get to know Katniss so well that when she is thrust into the horrific environment of the arena the vile nature of the games is graphically emphasized.  How can anyone do this to kids??  But the author left the story wanting in other areas.  Primarily, I really wanted to get to know Katniss's home district -- District 12 -- better before she was pulled from it and thrust into the bewildering environment of Capitol.  I wanted more about its people and its past...perhaps some enticing tidbits about their role in the rebelling decades earlier that led to the Games and would serve as a strong connection to home when Katniss is fighting for her life in the arena.  Instead, the entire focus is on the Games for much of the book and Panem's -- as well District 12's -- history is left by the wayside, hopefully to be picked up again and fleshed out in much greater detail in the subsequent books of the trilogy.  Nonetheless, the story of Panem is thoroughly engaging and I can easily understand why it has connected with so many readers already.  I look forward to picking up the next two books in the near future.

B006H8BIIM|4.0|Others have mentioned the amount of endless play needed and I agree around 30 hours needed but on the lower difficulties.  I have been playing on medium and getting about 100 credits for 5 minutes.  So depending on the difficulty you choose, it could be between 10 - 15 hours for all upgrades.<br /><br />I do enjoy the game so 5 star game minus 2 for long grinding and adding 1 to offset other reviews.  I don't mind in app purchases to &quot;cheat&quot; but would like to see a little less grind for those that don't want to.  Maybe as I get more upgrades so I can increase the endless mode difficulty and the grinding will get shorter.
0321344758|5.0|Krug gives a great deal of information on how a site needs to be designed for better usability. I think most people do have a sense of using the web, as a result I found some of the topics mentioned in the book to be extremely basic and naive, but are none-the-less important points and count for improving usability.<br /><br />The authors' study on web usability is highly commendable and the book itself is a very good read.<br /><br />\\"The Back button is the most-used feature of Web browsers.\\"
B0081L37Z0|4.0|A pleasant surprise with plenty of laughs and a good performance by Ice Cube to boot.<br /><br />This film never took itself seriously and kept the action flowing. Not the stuff of legend, just a movie that served up funny scene after funny scene and was first-class entertainment.<br /><br />Jonah Hill is a recognized and extremely competent comedic actor but Channing Tatum - who knew? I guess he did because he is first-rate funny throughout.<br /><br />Ice Cube's take on the classic cranky chief from 70's and 80's flicks was great - over the top, but still in control. Rob Riggle follows up his performance in \\"The Other Guys\\" with another great role as the arrogant jerk whom makes you laugh until you want to beat the junk out of him.<br /><br />The film fell a little bit short in some of the details and some of the other supporting characters are two-dimensional but those issues are small potatoes within the feast of yuks you get along the way.<br /><br />**SPOILER ALERT**<br /><br />The non-explosions during the car chase are small bits of genius and setup the big bang that comes up later perfectly.<br /><br />A great movie to forget your cares while also not insulting your intelligence (too much.) It merited three-and-a-half stars but as a math nerd, I rounded it up!

Overall excellent. Watch it!

B005LAIIRQ|3.0|The other reviewers do a good job pointing out the problem with this movie .<br />It seemed to fight with itself to decide what kind of movie it wanted to be .<br /><br />a) Serious survival story<br /><br />-or-<br /><br />b) Unrealistic supernatural CG! wolf-monster movie<br /><br />--or--<br /><br />c)  Symbolic movie about soul searching and self redemption<br /><br />Perhaps by trying to be three movies at once, it never quite succeeded at reaching its full potential on any of the levels.<br /><br />It was beautifully shot.<br />Great acting by all involved.<br />Well written dialog.<br /><br />Did a fair job of pulling you into their situation .........<br />BUT ............<br /><br />SOMETHING just didn't work and the film never really touches or grabs you.<br /><br />It's like a well done technical movie ... but missing a soul or spirit that gets to you.<br /><br />It's hard to place a finger on what exactly was missing in the movie, but it just kind of lumbered along ---- ended ...... and then was pretty forgetable.<br /><br />My wife just looked at me and went ......  \\"Hmmmmmm,  that's it ?\\"

0984999302|5.0|\\"The Startup Owner's Manual\\" is an incredibly useful and usable book. In fact, it might be the most useful business book ever written. If you are serious about being an entrepreneur and launching your own successful business, you must read this book. I also strongly recommend reading \\"Four Steps to the Epiphany,\\" Steve's earlier book that sets the stage for \\"The Startup Owner's Manual.\\" These books aren't written for dummies -- they are the real deal. Read these two books and you will have earned the equivalent of a Stanford MBA. This stuff is pure gold. Kudos to Steve and Bob for their generosity and willingness to share their amazingly valuable knowledge with the world! They are much more than just two highly successful entrepreneurs -- they are role models, and their book is an excellent example of how you can create good karma by sharing with others the knowledge and truths that you have acquired!
B005LAIHZY|3.0|A critic described this movie as being \\"more Disney than Pixar\\". I have to agree. In the theater viewing the two things I enjoyed the most were the short called Luna (not certain if it is included with this dvd) and the princess' hair. Apparently each hair strand was distinctly animated. What the movie lacks is a good storyline. It starts out promisingly with the princess rebelling against a forced marriage but then descends into a typical Disney fairytale complete with comic relief characters, adults behaving childishly and the like. This is a good movie but it pales in comparison with classics like Spirited Away, Monsters Inc, and Toy Story.
0807014273|5.0|As a spiritual author, I was recently asked by one of my readers whether one could successfully maintain a sense of higher values in the midst of especially horrific circumstances--such as extremely tortuous prison conditions.  Wouldn't one inevitably be reduced to a base, animalistic state?  I started to answer her question, but stopped, because I have never personally experienced a circumstance like that. So anything I have to say on the subject would mostly be conjecture.  And then it dawned on me.  Wasn't there a book written by a man who had experienced life in a Nazi Concentration Camp--a book with an uplifting message about man's indomitable spirit?  It only took seconds via Google to find Viktor Frankl's \\"Man's Search for Meaning.\\"  And there was the \\"proof\\" I was seeking.  After reading Frankl's book, I can now say with conviction that one can, indeed, maintain a sense of higher values in horrific conditions. One can retain his or her human dignity, an appreciation for art, beauty, and creativity, and even grow from the experience.  Perhaps only one person in a thousand will do so.  But Frankl demonstrated that it is possible.  Thank you, Viktor, for sharing your trials and triumphs with us all. What a profound inspiration your book is, and shall continue to be, as long as people are suffering in this world.<br /><br />Steven Lane Taylor, author \\"Row, Row, Row Your Boat: A Guide for Living Life in the Divine Flow\\"
B0006ZFQNA|5.0|Carmen is the paradigm of the ideal Opera. A truly great masterwork. It has some great achievements in its<br />discography. However, this Abbado´s 1977 performance conducting the LSO, is arguably the best rounded of them<br />all. Admirably judged and conducted by a young Abbado, it also includes the ideal vocal staff: a remarkable but<br />perhaps a bit polished Teresa Berganza performing Carmen; an uncomparable and outstanding Plácido Domingo, a<br />moving Ileana Cotrubas and an imposing Sherill Milnes. The best recommendation for anyone who is looking for<br />just one reference recording. An essential.
B00846REIS|4.0|Sylvia Day made me want to go into a room, lock the door, curl up into a ball and read this story from cover to cover. This book has it all - dark pasts, controlling men, beautiful people, wealth and power. The story features Eva Tramell, a twenty-something college graduate from a wealthy and influential family that wants to make her way in the world based on her own merits. Eva is no virgin, and comes with her own dark past. Eva lives with her bisexual best friend, Cary, with whom she has a completely platonic relationship with. Cary is beautiful, and an aspiring model with a penchant for falling in love with the \\"right\\" guys and then screwing up those relationships with the \\"wrong\\" woman or man. Cary shares with Eva a dark and disturbed past.<br /><br />Before Eva's first day on her new job at an advertising agency, she scopes out her place of work.  She accidentally bumps into a tall, dark and beautiful man.  This is our first introduction to Gideon Cross.  Unbeknownst at the time to Eva, Gideon Cross is the owner of the building she works in, The Crossfire Building.  Immediately, Gideon's demeanor changes when he looks at Eva.  Something happens between them, leaving Eva breathless and Gideon on the hunt, so to speak.  Gideon is magnetic. He's full of maleness and confidence and immediately enthralls Eva with his looks and his grace. Eva is no shrinking violet. The first thing she thinks about after she meets Gideon is what it would be like to have sex with him. Her thoughts include the words \\"primal\\" and sheet-clawing.\\"<br /><br />Eva's second day of work brings her interesting news - her boss explains that he received a request for proposal (RFA) from Kingsman Vodka, a company owned by Crossfire Industries.  Eva is invited to the pitch, and the pull between Eva and Gideon begins in earnest.  Eva and Gideon's relationship begins, him by wanting nothing more than to have sex with her, and her playing hard to get.  Eva might like sex, but she's nobody's toy.  There are lunch meetings and dates, and their relationship progresses.  Eva demands that sex with her be personal.  She says that there doesn't necessarily need to be romance, but she requires friendliness and respect.  I like Eva very much because she doesn't give in to Cross like a doe-eyed little girl caught in the headlights of a rich and powerful man.  Eva's from a similar background to Cross - she wants Cross, but she's going to do it on her terms.  Although Gideon sees Eva as \\"trouble\\" for him, he is drawn to her and cannot let her go. When Eva rejects Cross' suggestion of no-strings-attached sex, he is the one willing to \\"revisit and revise\\" what he wants from a relationship with her.<br /><br />So Eva and Gideon begin a friendly relationship.  Eva learns that Gideon has a dark and tortured past.  This is a plus for me as a reader, because there are few things I adore more than dark and twisted pasts.  I love tortured and vulnerable characters, making this book like a drug for me.  Gideon makes many mistakes along the way, which I chalk up to him not knowing how to deal with Eva.  He's falling in love with a woman against his better judgment.  He doesn't really know how to be in a normal relationship.  We see the darkness in Gideon several times, but Eva does her best to stand by her man.  We discover Eva's twisted secrets, but Gideon's run deeper and darker.  He is very disturbed by something that happened in his past.<br /><br />My only problem with Eva is that her answer to any problem with Gideon is to run away.  If she's feeling hurt, used, pissed, jealous or any negative emotion, her answer is to take off without a word.  The first time she does this, I can understand her fears.  But by the end of the book, I had had enough of that behavior.  Eva has a few moments where she really can't make up her mind about what she really wants from Gideon.  One minute, Eva thinks Gideon only wants sex from her.  When he shows the world that he's in an actual relationship with her, she's not quite happy with that, either.<br /><br />There are a few places in this book where Gideon deserves Eva's anger, no more so than at the end with the introduction of someone from Gideon's past.  But to be fair, Gideon is very up front with Eva, and I believe that he really does want and love Eva.  However, both of these characters have dark and desperate pasts to deal with, and until they do that, they will continue to hurt one another.  I especially enjoyed when Eva put her foot down concerning Gideon's ex calling him every day.  Gideon, like many men, cannot see why or how this would bother Eva to the degree that it does.  Ha!  I love how Eva plays him at the end of the book - telling him that if he doesn't put an immediate end to his ex's infatuation with him, that she will take his cue while dealing with her own ex-boyfriends.  This is just the type of thing to drive Gideon crazy!  Gideon, though, is able to show his vulnerabilities to Eva, which is a big start for him.<br /><br />Like I stated earlier, I'm a sucker for dark and tortured characters.  This book delivers on several characters that can fit this description.  From Eva and Gideon, to Cary and even Magdalene and Corinne (both ex-lovers of Gideon).  I think we're going to see a lot of drama in the next book.  I think that Corinne is going to play a bigger role in aggravating Eva, and I think that Corinne isn't all that she appears.  I think Gideon is going to make progress on his past issues, and that Eva will be there with him, until she can't handle the jealousy that she will undoubtedly have because of his ex-lovers.  I think Deeper into You is going to be an emotional roller coaster, and I'm just happy to say that I will most definitely be along for the ride!

B004H4XLR4|2.0|After the rave reviews, I was totally disappointed. The plastic seems fairly flimsy, and I am not sure whether it will survive really active play.  My grandson does like the storage compartment with the cars that I also purchased, but I think that may be all he uses this for. He loves planes, so I thought this would be great for him. Now I think it was really a waste of money. The string to tow the cars into the back is hard to pull out, and then it takes forever to turn the knob on the back of one of the engines, to get the car into the jet. I would not recommend this.

0307730697|5.0|The story of Adam Brown's life is like a Roller Coaster Ride, first it takes you up and then it plunges you down, not just once but over and over again. It is a true American life story told without any holds barred and with Adam's permission, of a boy with high expectations, personal failures and the determination to overcome whatever life had in store for him. Like many of us, his family is affected by his actions and suffers their own doubts and fears until they turn to a local Pastor who shares some of their experience.  When Adam meets Kelley,  who is adrift herself, she see's something in Adam that is special and a bond is formed which becomes his lifeline. Adam and Kelley find the importance of faith in their lives as they struggle to make their marriage work and to free Adam from his addictions. With the  help of an old family friend and against all odds, Adam not only gets into the United States Navy but sets his sights high, on the Seals and makes it. Not just the Seals but Seal Team Six in spite of injuries that could have allowed him to receive a medical discharge. Adam's story is told by his family, friends and fellow Seals who were anxious to tell of their friends willingness to volunteer for the tough assignments, to struggle on even when wounded and his strong team spirit all which made him a fearless hero in their eyes. His wife Kelley relates with humor how the warrior in Adam could turn off when he returned home and the loving husband and father took over.  FEARLESS is the story of Adam Brown a real American Hero, it is a book you don't want to put down but you do want to share.

B007549W62|2.0|Directed by Xavier Gens (who made his name with a horror \\"Frontier(s)\\" back in 2007) \\"The Divide\\" attempts to do two things at once. The film starts out as a post-apocalyptic thriller about a small group of survivors after a nuke attack on New York City; it also intends to be a psychological drama of these \\"lucky\\" people under the claustrophobic situations. The premise may remind us of Vincenzo Natali's psychological thriller \\"Cube,\\" in which scientific elements serve as a set-up for the story about the characters trapped in a small space.<br /><br />The idea is good, if not very original. Unfortunately, the filmmakers failed to develop it into a compelling narrative. \\"The Divide\\" tries to be a grim, uncompromising thriller by repeatedly using graphic violence. Though I do not disagree with the idea itself, I still find it annoying and pointless when violence is the only thing the director seems interested in.<br /><br />What is strange about \\"The Divide\\" is that no one in the film (and the filmmakers) seems to care the details of the situation. The film seems unaware of such things as water, air ventilation and radioactive matters that will affect the lives of the characters. The director seems only interested in how those survivors descend into a hellish condition, being deprived of last vestige of humanity.<br /><br />By the time the film's thin story comes to the conclusion, I stopped caring what is going on inside of the basement, even though the film has a decent cast including Rosanna Arquette, Michael Biehn, Lauren German, Courtney B. Vance and Milo Ventimiglia. While watching this mess, I remembered that Rosanna Arquette was in \\"Pulp Fiction,\\" possibly the best film of the 1990s. That made me really sad.

B003Y5H53S|2.0|In a house with two younger kids, we watch our share of animated movies. We just finished watching Rango and I have to say that I wish I hadn't seen it.<br /><br />While it was professionally animated, the characters and dialogue were really odd.<br /><br />The main character, Rango, is cool enough, but Bean is (as my 8 year old says) 'creepy' with ringlets and bloodshot eyes. The rest of characters are a modge podge assortment of things that are often hard to discern. They live in the town of Dirt where water is just about non-existent. So how do they all survive? Really? Day after day of no water. They should all be dead. But I guess I'm too literal on this one since, let's face it, it's a movie about talking critters.<br /><br />The town mayor is creepy and easily set-up as the bad guy. Animals are killed all throughout the movie - good characters and bad. There's a comment about having an enlarged prostate and a character whips out his latex glove and asks, 'Who's ready?'<br /><br />But the line that really got me was when the rattle snake grabs Bean and screams, \\"Sign the damn paper woman.\\" Now I know the snake is supposed to be a bad guy but this line was really over the top for me. There were a lot of small swear words and way too much gunfire and violence for my liking.<br /><br />Not a movie I would ever watch again.
0812550706|4.0|Ender's Game is an engaging sci-fi/YA story of child prodigy, Ender Wiggin, and the world's dependence on his skill as a military commander to save the world from alien domination. Written in 1977, EG was ahead of its time, predicting a world with an internet. The story strikes a lot of similarities with the hero arc of Harry Potter: a young boy with special abilities who goes off to a special school under the pressure of having to save the world. Along his journey, Ender is haunted by dreams and faces bullying from jealous schoolmates. He is also used (tricked?) by his mentor in the similar \\"the end justify the means\\" way that Dumbledore never quite told Harry the truth about his purpose in life. It all climaxes in a finale that left this reader just a bit underwhelmed given all the buildup. That adults would entrust the future of the world to a child is hard to believe. I also didn't care for the political posturing that failed to connect with the main story. But it's hard not to root for Ender as a young boy grappling to come to terms with the daunting task thrust upon him. The best part of the book is how other kid's that Ender meets along the way come back to launch into battle with him, with Ender as their undisputed leader, a heartwarming display of loyalty and respect. A great read for anyone.

B0041D843M|5.0|This is an excellent book on a study from a researcher who has been involved in nutrition and food studies for many years, including government agencies which seem to cover many things up. It's nice this guy came out of the corporate closet to reveal the many truths about eating meat. Most striking is that in China, those living in the rich areas, who are wealthy...which means they can afford and do eat meat, are getting sick much more than those on plant diets. So maybe being poor is a blessing if you can't afford to eat meat...at least you will still have your health!<br /><br />Meat will kill you in time. You can get all the toxins in the world in your body, but without meat, the cancer can't activate. Avoiding meat is the only way to handle our toxic world. You say your ancestors ate meat and lived a long healthy life? Well, that was before they started using so many chemicals to treat our foods, environment and animals. It's your only way to survive this planet right now.<br /><br />Read this book and open your eyes to the importance of a vegetarian diet. If you need science and research from a credible source, this is your book.

The picture clarity/quality just doesn't do this show justice. But it is an awesome concert.
B004EPZ00C|5.0|Usually I get disappointed seeing a second part of a movie that I enjoyed.<br /><br />So I very seldom really enjoy the second version as much as the first one.<br /><br />this time...different..<br /><br />I absolutely recommend this movie to everyone. Doesn't matter if you saw Nr. 1 or not, it's a great comedy! Don't miss it.

B00003CXD5|5.0|I have many of the Bogart movies, this just recently having been given to me as a Fathers Day gift. This is one that I enjoy watching over and over again about once a year.  The story line is excellent and to think they made these movies at the rate of one a week. Bogart was a real life character. He had an appeal that almost can't be explained.  He had that rugged look, but his on screen personality is what made him.  I also found it interesting that John Houston plays the cameo part in the movie.  Walter Houston and Tim Holt also had outstanding performances and actually outdid Bogart in this movie. This movie will always be remembered for the classic line by the Mexican bandit, \\"We don't need no stinkin badges.\\"  If you had a nickel for everytime that  line has been repeated you would be reach.  The movie also tells the story of human greed and how fate can deal you a swift kick in the butt, but also how in the end Tim Holt and Walter Houston can realize that there is more to life the being wealthy. I place this as one of my favorite movies along with Casablanca and The Maltese Falcon. But let's not forget the other great actors of this era, Erol Flynn and Tyrone Power.  I have grown up with these \\"old\\" movies, but will always love them with the stories they impart about people and our lives and the fragile nature of life.  PS And don't forget how great the music is that accompanies the picture....just greatness all around.
B0081L37Z0|1.0|Don't waste your money!!!This movie is terrible, not funny and completely stupid!!! We thought it would be like the tv show and even the cameos were pathetic!!!
B000I186FW|5.0|It took me years to finally sit down and watch it (like most movies), but now I'm kicking myself for waiting so long. I had seen a couple minutes of it when it had aired on tv, liked what I saw and looked it up on Amazon. I loved the fact that Amazon lets you stream it for 48 hours while waiting for the actual blu-ray to arrive. I streamed it twice thru my blu-ray player, and then still watched it again when I got my shipment. I would definitely suggest watching it a few times as there were different things I would notice each time I watched it. The cinematography was amazing, and the soundtrack was beautiful and I purchased it the following day. Great movie, even better message.
B000JQUZCI|5.0|OK -<br />So you might have had to read this in high school.<br />You might have skipped this in high school.<br />You might BE in high school.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and READ this novel.<br /><br />Mary Wollenstonecraft Shelley's masterpiece<br />is worth a second read.  Or first read - so you will<br />understand what all the fuss is about.<br /><br />DO IT!

B006H8BIIM|1.0|Quit whining about IAPs, This game just sucks! If you can't afford IAPs, then get a better job... Like slinging crack rocks or jacking banks... maybe rob you dear old granny, she'll love the attention too! The only thing you should NOT do is sell your body on the street corner, you won't get laid, only mugged or busted by the five-O.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book was intoxicating from beginning to end. I have since completed the entire series and I still want more! A fun, sexy thriller.
B007IXWKUK|1.0|Here's a short and sweet review.  This book is worse than book 1. I was on the fence for book 1 and hoped against hope that this book would go somewhere and that an editor had been found (lurking in a closet somewhere?).  Nope.  I finished the book in a feat of self-discipline.<br /><br />Remember how I said she writes a good sex scene?  Well, she likes it enough to write the same thing over and over.  So essentially nothing new in this book, save youself some $ and time and go read something else.
0345803485|1.0|I'm a happily married mother & lawyer with a very satisfactory sex life.  This is THE FIRST BOOK REVIEW I've ever taken the time to write. I downloaded this book b/c so many people I know are reading it and talking about it, and I'm a voracious reader. What a waste of money. I've read some very bad books in my time, and finished many of them, simply b/c I dislike leaving things undone, but this drivel is unreadable. And it TRULY makes me wonder about the sex life of the modern American woman!  I've heard and read comments from women that the sex scenes \\"helped their marriage.\\" REALLY?!? That is both sad and disturbing. Dont get me wrong. I'm all in favor of good sex scenes in my books, but you won't find them in this idiotic, boring, unbelievable book. I'm embarrassed that I've added to the author's wealth. Can one \\"return\\" a nook<br />purchase?

0596805527|4.0|As a C#/C++ developer I bought this book to learn basics of JavaScript. I don't plan to develop Web apps, but because JavaScript effectively became 'the language of the web' it's nearly inevitable to know at least basic syntax and semantic of this language.<br /><br />In my opinion, this book is the same to JavaScript as Bjarne Stroustrup's The C++ Programming Language to C++. The book is divided into 4 parts. First part is dedicated to core JS features. Writing style, depth of explanations, examples, all strongly resemble Stroustrup's book. Flanagan goes into great depth, he explains all problematic parts of JS itself (honestly JS syntax and semantic is sometimes bizarre) and differences between JS implementations. Especially the attention he pays to JS semantic 'quirks' (for instance automatic conversions of numbers, arrays, objects, string) that are so different to C-like languages was very useful for me. Also I like that sample programs didn't bother with any HTML code (the results are just written in comments). It's a great idea not to mix HTML and JS in these early stages of study. Only thing I didn't like was Chapter 6. I think author should have merged this chapter with chapter 9 and he could have presented object-oriented aspects of JS (especially prototype inheritance) together with the presentation of objects.<br /><br />Second part is all about JS integration with web browsers. Once again author gives in-depth coverage, with many details about differences between browser implementations. Many samples contain utility functions that helps you to overcome these disparities. Chapter 19 contains good intro into jQuery and last chapter covers some new HTML 5 features like client side DB or Web Sockets.<br /><br />Last two parts (about 300 pages) are JS references covering all important JS functions and classes. To be honest, this part of book was unnecessary for me. If you have Internet, you don't need this printed version of JS reference. It just makes the book thicker and heavier.<br /><br />To sum up. JS The Definitive Guide is useful book for experienced developers who know some other object oriented language and want to learn JS. It's not the best IT book I have ever read but still it gave me good intro into JS.ok thicker and heavier.<br /><br />To sum up. JS The Definitive Guide is useful book for experienced developers who know some other object oriented language and want to learn JS. It's not the best IT book I have ever read but still it gave me good intro into JS.

B006H8BIIM|4.0|if you play the campaign you get lots of credits and it doesn't take very long to get them therefore you don't need to spend money if you spend five minutes on the game
B006H8BIIM|1.0|I reviewed this product earlier this morning but apparently it's not appropriate to say that you 'hate' something. Well, I do hate this thing. I hate it for multiple specific reasons: OpenFeint. That reason alone is enough to not only pass on the game but also to boycott the developer (maybe not really 'boycott'... but, heck, why not... there are a million better choices so why not just put them in the 'ignore forever' bucket). I also hate it because it's a paid app that simultaneously charges for in-app content. Devs: one or the other, not both; otherwise it's inexcusable crappy behavior. There, I think that pretty much hits my lame 20-word requirement. But, a bonus comment free of charge: Amazon is getting worse and worse on this FAOTD concept. I have been a huge fan of Amazon as a customer; I truly hated working there as a Dev and it remains the worst job I've had in 25 years. But, I still prefer shopping on Amazon regardless of what it's like to work there. FAOTD is making me lose faith. I might be better off just uninstalling the Amazon Android App store and sticking with Google Play. Amazon is supposed to bring some added value to the App store formula. Things like trustworthy reviews (but they are not, the devs get their moms and cousins all throughout India to write phony 5-star reviews for crappy apps), and this FAOTD is supposed to be some fun differentiator but instead it just annoys and demonstrates that Amazon is NOT listening to it's customer base. Whatever... General Purpose Lame.
B002I0J5FG|5.0|I played shadow of the Colussus on the PS2 many years ago and it was an amazing experience.

Looking forward to playing it too.

0316153834|5.0|Michael Connelly does such a great job of developing the Harry Bosch character.  This book, like most of Mr. Connelly's was captivating and a real mystery.  It's a \\"keep you up all night\\" kind of book.  Loved it.
B000KIPT30|4.0|I'm building a project studio at home and made the decision because I needed a cheap headphone amp quickly. I read reviews and bought mainly on the price.<br />Quite a number of people seem to hate Behringer and although I had some issues with one of their products in the past, my Truths were repaired and they still give me what I want so I'm willing to take the chance on the brand.<br /><br />I used the HA400 for an entire week to break in four new headphones at the same time(one of them is the KRK KNS6400 which I bought on Amazon).<br />Let me emphasize that after 7 days, 24 hours a day, each channel has the same volume and balance left to right. I can crank each channel all the way up and there's no crackling or popping and very little distortion at the top.<br />The second channel's control gets a little stiff as it approaches midway but for $22 who's going to complain?<br /><br />I bought the HA400 because I have a few people coming to do a backup vocal track together so I thought \\"I'll just buy this and replace in a month or two.\\"<br />\\"Uhmmm... This lil baby is working out so well that I think I'll keep it until I'm ready for a headphone amp with separate EQ for each channel and more than one input!\\"<br /><br />Goods sold directly from Amazon which I have bought, I have received quickly and in good order, including this Nice lil Device!
B0087OSP0S|5.0|This installment clearly is an appetizer for the main course to follow as new characters are introduced, mysteries hinted at and some old favorites reveal some of their secret (or not so secret) traits. The Riddler has left Sanctuary, though perhaps abandoned would be a closer description for those who remain. Sanctuary seems somehow devoid of magic, though there is plenty of darkness still there. Tempus has left a curious blend behind with vague orders about policing the populace. He has taken most of his army with him and those left in place to question whether they are being tested, punished, or both. Critias investigates dark mysteries while evaluating his relationships with Strat and Kama, trusting neither and pondering his need for both. Many dark forces are at work and former enemies must at least pretend to act as allies.<br /><br /> The Wake of the Riddler is a great sampling of these ancient world tales and perhaps serves the new comer to these stories a great entry point into the saga. The style of the narrative is classic literary and it reads as wonderfully rhythmic prose. The writing has a kind of authority perhaps only found in works by those with a good deal of classic literature background. Yet it is easily followed. I especially liked the descriptions of the horses. Very important to create vivid equestrian images in a sword and horse fantasy and Norris is superb in her description of Crit's gray and Strat's profoundly disturbing \\"Ghost Horse.\\"<br /><br /> Excellent sword and horse fantasy and a refreshing diversion from the normal epic length of continuous battle scenes so common in the genre. This reads almost like a detective thriller and I found the mysteries, subplots and characters created a wonderfully entertaining little \\"snack\\" of wizardry, ancient weaponry, and good old fashion lust.
B00846REIS|4.0|this book was actually pretty good, but it was basically exactly like the Fifty series but I didnt connect with these 2 as much as christian and ana. I will read the other books in the series when they come out though, but only to pass the time to wait until a fifty shades movie comes out?! :) although in this movie, I do like how it shows Eva's independence and lets her stand up for herself & not be so controlled over her man though, which is the one thing that I didnt like about the 50 series. overall, 4 stars for Bared to You!
B007JM4CWY|5.0|I have really enjoyed this game so far. I've done nearly 150 of the puzzles and I never seem to tire of it.  no complaints with the controls or game play.  well done.
0345803507|5.0|While not greatly written, it's still an addictive book. I'm a fan of fanfiction - but when I found out this book was originally written as a Bella/Edward fanfiction, I was hesitant about reading it. Half the people I know kept going on and on about it - the other half kept saying it was a horrible book and you shouldn't believe the hype. Well, I like to judge things for myself. I bought the first book yesterday and the second book last night because I'd finished the first one, now I'm done the second book and I'm ready for the third but our walmart doesn't have it.<br /><br />Sure, it's unrealistic in a way. As a fan of Clark and Lex fanfiction though, I love it because it's like them, only if Clark was a girl. I loved it!
0439023513|2.0|Okay... I get it. War is hell. Bad things happen in war. I accept that people are going to die. Even some we really like. It's pretty much the theme of this whole series. Just a scant few chapters into the very first book we know that all of the tributes are going to die except Katniss.<br /><br />In Mockingjay, however, by the time Collins shows us the climactic last death of the war, we don't care. It should have been the most impactful death scene of the whole series - the one that makes you put the book down and run outside sobbing for half an hour - it wasn't. The circumstances around the scene made so little sense that I initially thought the next chapter was a dream sequence. Why on earth would the rebels, who have all but won the war, fought the Capitol back to their very last building, start deploying child soldiers to the front line? Why would they deploy them ANYWHERE? It's as if characters are being killed off in the story in the morbid hope that one of them makes an impression on the reader. I felt pretty cheated by the story at this point. All pretense of adventure was lost - I realized I was not reading an entertaining piece of science fiction, I was reading a sermon on the evils of war.<br /><br />The death wasn't necessary to the story; Katniss would have acted the same in response to all of the other senseless carnage. She still would have carried out her final assassination. She still would have faded gloomily into the hills Appalachia; haunted for the rest of her life by the games and the war. It was a believable, if somewhat sad, end to her tale.<br /><br />Why put that last war-time death of a main character in the story? I guess because Collins really, really wants to drive home how terrible war is. We were clear on this topic already, but one more over-the-top death just had to be thrown in - in case you forgot to shout \\"Amen\\" at the previous death of a main character.
0142000671|4.0|Since this book was on my list of classics, I ordered it (was curious too). The reviews I read concerning this book mention it's directness and compliment the author the simple writing style that takes you away from the first to the last page. Well...it's all true. I truly liked this book. Simply written but with so much meaning and depth. One of the books everyone should've read!
B0000DYKET|3.0|I bought a pair of Keen sandals because pretty much everyone I know wears them and they looked really comfortable. Overall, I like them, but I've had better sandals for less money than I paid for my Keens:<br /><br />Pros: Comfort. I can walk all day in these sandals without foot fatigue, heel pain, or irritation from the straps. I ended up getting a half size larger because I wanted to be able to wear them with socks when it's cooler. You may look like a geek, but this is by far the most comfortable way to wear the Keens. A good, synthetic or wool hiking sock with these feel great, because your feet don't feel sweaty. They hold up well after repeated washes. I really like the protective toe cap. If you work somewhere that doesn't allow open-toed shoes, you may be able to get around that policy with these shoes. Perhaps that's why all my coworkers own a pair.<br /><br />Cons: Man I sweat like a pig with these sandals in hot weather. I don't care that they have an \\"anti-microbial footbed\\" these sandals will stink to high heaven with continued wear. I've washed them numerous times and the smell always comes back. This particular model has a leather footbed and is not marketed as a water shoe. I would not recommend getting them wet while wearing them. I was walking my dog when I got caught in torrential downpour that soaked my clothes and sandals. The best way I can describe the slipperiness of the insides of these sandals when wet is like a dog's rawhide chew toy or strips of raw bacon. Needless to say it's hard to run when your feet are sliding around inside your sandal.

B0088W80HC|4.0|>>CORRECTED!&lt;&lt; As of the date of this review, the episode description is incorrect (NOW CORRECT...such as it is).  The following paragraph is my synopsis [NO spoilers]; remaining paragraphs are my review [also no spoilers]:<br /><br />In the episode \\"Thirty-eight Minutes,\\" Major Sheppard has been immobilized by a chihuahua-sized insect and is dying. The puddle jumper transporting him back to Atlantis becomes stuck half way through the stargate. Since stargates can remain open only 38 minutes, Dr. McKay, also aboard the puddle jumper, works to free it while other crew members Teyla and Lt. Ford work with Dr. Beckett (who is on Atlantis) to save Major Sheppard in the unlikely event they should make it through the stargate before it closes, killing them all.<br /><br />It should be noted that I am an unabashed fan of this series, but I didn't like this episode when I first saw it because it takes place primarily in a confined space. This is a personal peeve of mine because I see this style of plot as a \\"money-saver\\" episode designed to skimp on the costs of effects, new props, and on-location shoots. At this stage in the series, it was way too early, in my mind at the time, to be subjecting us to this type of penny pinching.<br /><br />Now that I've had some time between my first viewing and my second, I can appreciate it for its true merits. The episode is suspenseful yet the script is typical of the witty banter evinced throughout the series despite the seriousness of the situation. The \\"science\\" that drove the plot was handled effectively (although I don't know if it violated any known laws at the time of its airing since I didn't see it when it first aired) yet didn't interfere with the story (although, I must admit I have fairly low standards where this type of thing is concerned since I love techno-babble). The actors had their characters well in hand (unlike the pilot).<br /><br />All in all it was a decent story and worth the hour spent watching it. I still don't prefer these types of episodes, but I did enjoy it more the second time I watched it than I did the first; which is saying something, since I almost skipped watching it because I had disliked it so much the first time.<br /><br />In fact, with my second viewing I realized that it did have several flashbacks which could have been explained without filming the scenes.  This made me wonder if there had originally been much more to the story that they ended up cutting for time constraints...in which case, I forgive them for subjecting us to the \\"money-saving\\" appearance of the episode...but now I wonder what the original story might have been...s, but I did enjoy it more the second time I watched it than I did the first; which is saying something, since I almost skipped watching it because I had disliked it so much the first time.

Beside Stormlight, Mistborn is definitely my favorite and I'm reading fantasy books for a while now.<br />Sanderson established himself as one of the greatest even thou his best time is yet to come (Stormlight Archive and new Mistborn series among others).<br /><br />If you haven't read Mistborn yet then surely you are missing one of the best high/epic fantasy books out there!!

B005LAII1C|5.0|\\"Ted\\" is great! This is how the story goes: John Bennett is a grown man who must deal with the cherished teddy bear who came to live as the result of a childhood wish... and has refused to leave his side ever since.<br /><br />The cast led by Mark Wahlberg (as John), Mila Kunis (as Lori) & Seth MacFarlane (terrific as Ted, who also directed, produced, wrote the story & co-wrote the screenplay) is great. The directing by MacFarlane is great. The story by MacFarlane & the screenplay by MacFarlane, Alec Sulkin & Wellesley Wild (who also produced) is great.<br /><br />The music by Walter Murphy is great. The cinematography by Michael Barrett is great. The film editing by Jeff Freeman is great. The casting by Sheila Jaffe is great. The production design by Stephen J. Lineweaver is great. The art direction by E. David Cosier & assistant art direction by Bryan Felty is great. The set decoration by Kyra Friedman & assistant set decoration by Amy Morrison is great. The set dressings by Shadya H. Ballug, Mickey Carter, Cosmas A. Demetriou, Jack O'Neil, John Pungitore, William C. Salter, Christopher Sawtelle & Cleo Wang is great. The special effects by Matt Corrigan is great. The visual effects supervised by Blair Clark & Scott Liedtka, coordinated by Magdalena Bisogni, Wendy Maestracci, Whitney Richman, Pippa Sheen, Georgia Smith & Pip Wright is great. The stunts coordinated by Kyle Woods are great.<br /><br />This is a funny and great movie that is entertaining and keeps you laughing until the very end. It is also well-made, as well. Seth MacFarlane does a great job, not only in directing the movie and writing the story & screenplay, but, in voicing Ted, he is (again) terrific. It also proves that he has a future outside television. He & Mark Wahlberg also have terrific chemistry together, as does Wahlberg & Mila Kunis. This is also one of the best movies of the summer season.
B00005OC0G|3.0|That Mutter goes her own way here is undeniable and apparently infuriating to some listeners. DG turns every Mutter release into an event, and for decades she maintained a glamorous Hollywood-like profile that few, if any, older female violinists had. She seems determined to hold up the notion that every performance must be an event, too.  To that end, she makes the Beethoven concerto sound different from bar to bar, sometimes effectively, sometimes quizzically, a when she enters a stretch of sustained pianissimo with a marked Slowdown in the first movement. Is this perversity or artistry of a unique kind?<br /><br />I find myself on Mutter's side for two reasons - I want interpretations to be as individual and free as possible (on this ground, see Mikhail Pletnev's highly eccentric but vital Beethoven), and I recognize the frustration of a soloist like Mutter who must have played the Beethoven concerto a hundred times without deviating far from standard issue.  Certainly Masur provides standard-issue orchestral accompaniments here; he's the opposite of the domineering  von Karajan who oversaw Mutter's first recording of this work as a teenager. Masur is content to trail passively behind his soloist, which is a shame.  Bruno Walter and Szigeti shows what can happen when both sides of the equation are strongly original.<br /><br />In its tut-tutting review the Gramophone points out, rightly, I suppose, that Mutter's \\"sophisticated aura\\" is at odds with the music. Beethoven is never less than earnest, even in a predominantly lyrical work like his violin concerto. The soloist does best by reaching deep for emotional transcendence; it's a mysterious goal, but Menuhin achieved it twice with Furtwangler to judge by their recordings on EMI and Audite. Mutter shows more concern for herself than reverence for Beethoven, so I must give her detractors their due.<br /><br />At 27 min. the first movement is very slow and allows Mutter to indulge in too many fancy change-ups. Mutter seems intently focused in the cadenza, which is held under a charismatic spotlight - it's wild and impressive. I like the Grmaophone's reference to her \\"smoochy slides\\" even if I don't quite know what it means. In the end, you do wonder if Mutter has gone off the rails; she didn't have to make so many odd points everywhere she turned. The main theme of the Larghetto, played as a true Largo with no lightness at all, leads to an attention-grabbing pianissimo. There's not as much room for funny business in the finale, but here Mutter feels a bit slack and uninterested. All told, a grandstanding event that is likely to win the hearts of only true believers.ter seems intently focused in the cadenza, which is held under a charismatic spotlight - it's wild and impressive.

B004WCTLNY|5.0|The big difference between the devil and God is succinctly told in Matthew 4.  The devil is all about 'adjusting' life for us humans, to 'encourage' us to go in the 'right' (meaning his own) direction.  Of course, since it is the devil's plan and not God's, here in this movie it's presented (without names) as God's.<br /><br />Wonderful story, to be sure. Wonderful script, great ensemble cast, subtle disparaging remarks about 'upstairs' throughout, lying 'angels', weird tricks with hats and suits, all preoccupied with gaining something in the world (all three temptations in Matt4);  well worth watching over and over.  I love this movie, truly five stars.  But again, it's the devil's plan, not God's, being depicted.<br /><br />Freedom doesn't need shaving.  God doesn't push you like they do in the movies.
B0086700CM|4.0|I have an I phone and I have this game but, I can't download it on my kindle fire .
B0086700CM|5.0|This game has great graphics, is nearly impossible to put down and runs great on my 2 year old droid x. It's not so hard that it's frustrating for a fumble-fingered beginner, but it's not easy either, so no boredom. Perfect mix! Thank you, imanji studios for your well designed work.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book was hands down one of the best I've ever read.. Once you start reading you literally cannot put it down. I finished in just a few days. This is a must read, as well as the rest of the series.
B007N8RULO|4.0|this game is fun and easy to use. its great that u do not need wifi to play it like some games and its a fun game if u want to play alone or be alone.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|i read these books and they were some of the best books ive ever  read! these books are beast!:-) you should really read these books!!!!!!!!!! i could not put my kindle down after i started. sometimes i stayed up until twelve a.m. still reading!! :) :) :) :) :) :)
B001W63DX2|2.0|My first impression of this DVD was severe disappointment, because of the ridiculous over-editing, and the bad choices:  too many shots of a musician's back, way too many crowd shots, etc.<br /><br />It took a year for me to give a second viewing, and now I would bump my review up to 3 stars.<br /><br />What's good about this video:<br /><br />* The music<br /><br />* The energy of the shows<br /><br />* Showing each song from a different town.<br /><br />This is a good video to work out to, because the sweaty energy is contagious, and of course, jeez, it's Maiden.
B004T2QZL8|5.0|I loved this game. For. 99¢, I thought it was worth it. Too bad it had to end. It was challenging, but I like that (Most of the time I had to use hints.).
B007PTJOV0|5.0|this game is pretty cool. its cool because its just like Mario and there isn't a Mario game on this kindle or an iphone
B00005AQE8|5.0|Great album one of the greatest if not the greatest 2pac albums. This album has alot of his famous hits! Great for any 90s hip-hop fan or collector. Fast shipping, great service and CD had 0 scratches and the art and booklet was in great condition, the only flaw was a cracked case on the front, but other than that 5/5
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I'm no prude and have been \\"around the block\\" a few times. Because I'm only on the first book of the trilogy of Fify Shades of Grey, I fail to understand how there is any sign of a normal relationship. All the kinky and constant sex gets old after pages of such activity. Although I enjoy a sexy read, I find the story and writing lacking. Perhaps the next two books will improve, but am not certain I will bother reading them. I may just check with my daughter and married granddaughter for a synopsis of them. Rather than a 'turn-on' the book is a 'turn-off' for me.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I hate that I succumbed to reading this book. I fell victim to the hype, but I am thankful that I purchased the first, and not all three, volumes.<br />I am a writer. Not on anyone's Top Ten list, but an amateur struggling to find a place for plain truth in this age of sensationalism.<br />This book is not exceptionally well written, nor is it socially conscious or of any significant substance. I can understand the fun-read, \\"guilty pleasure\\" factor here, and the license this book gives the women of suburbia to read, and talk about, what amounts to pornography. It gives us permission to be dirty; not that there's anything wrong with that, but it chaps my fanny that someone is getting filthy rich off of our voyeurism.<br />As for the social analysis taking place everywhere you look; about how women just want to be dominated, and to have a break from their hectic lives- really, People, you couldn't come up with that on your own? Despite the horny heatwave that has ensued from consumption of this book, I doubt if there is a lot of nipple-whipping going on.<br />If you have not yet succumbed to the hype, I bid you ignore it.<br />Use your imagination.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This just goes to show you that a best seller only means that lots of sheep all read the same idiot book.  Think Sarah Palin but even less intellectual.  Is that possible you ask?  It is now.  I can't spend anymore energy being amazed at how ridiculous this book is, so I'm going to defer you to the other negative reviews.  They cover most of its poor quality and immature writing, but they are more humane than I could ever be.  If you're 15 yo with a learning disability you may like this book.  So there is hope.
B007L3BMGA|2.0|Don't understand what the fuss is all about. Far from satisfactory to my mind.  Poorly written and an insult to one's intellect.
B00158K0S8|5.0|Let's face it, Hollywood hates Patton because he was one of the first to suggest that Stalin was a worse than Stalin.  If it were not for all the Nazi films of their attrocities, we  have seen them all.  Howver, had we seen films of the Japanesse atrocities in China, or Mao , or the death by starvation of many millions more of Ukranians, ethnic Germans living in Russia, or Jews ( Trotsky being the most famous Soviet Jew, who was killed shortly after Stalin had to behave himself getting rid of his political enemies and taking over Eastern Europe.  Patton was the American's greatest General during WWII, although MacArthur could be argued to be the best. His problem with today's worshipers of FDR and Truman, was that he was a potential political rival.  Bill Maudlin, the favorite cartoonist of Stars and Stripes hated Paton because he was a General whose philosphy clashed with the civilians whom he had to make into soldiers. The famous slap of the shell shocked soldier was not as bad as the countless mistakes caused by inferior generals who caused their lives to be lost.  Patton's slap was not fatal, he was not a social worker who knew or cared much for battle fatique.  A lot of soldiers caused self inflicted wounds. If Patton allowed such actions, indeed, if any General allowed such actions, Hitler would never been defeated.  That Patton or MacArthur were not perfect men, is not debatable. Howver, General Bradley, the \\"soldiers's soldier lived to write his own history. He never slapped a soldier, but he probably cost more lives to be lost than Patton or MacArthur.  And as for Patton's negative remarks about Stalin, as we look back in hindsight, was Eisenhower, Bradley or FDR correct in thier misjudgement about Communism and Stalin.<br />Hollywood seems to forget that Hitler was in power for 13 years, and was more or less elected into office.  Stalin was a Dictator for half a century, and became our enemy. Thanks to Hollywood, Hitler has become the villan of the century, while Stalin somehow comes in second as the Devil of the 20th Century. yes, the Nazi death camps were horrible, but were they any worse than those of the communists? We just do not have films, nor were the Western Allies allowed to see the communists attocities.  This is not deny the ridiculous arguments made by Iran, that the Holocaust did not exist. But it is a shamefull error to ignore the fact that Stalin started the war against the West, and stole our secrets fo half a century. Meanwhile, Germany has become one of our best allies.
B001B2CPH2|5.0|superb acting.<br />believable.<br />relative to those current times yet continues to touch the heart in the future too.<br />true love shown in many ways thru multiple actions.
1587613379|1.0|It's disrespectful and there's  enough compartmentalizing of people going around as it is.<br />This creates and leaves a lot of broken hearts in a pile.  Not an improvement.
B001NKI60W|5.0|Good interactive story about relationships between a mother and daughter, friends of both male and female, cross-culture similarities and the absolute fantastical waya the songs went with almost every sub plot of the movie.  Always adored ABBA.  Like them more now.

B000IZ6URY|5.0|THIS IS NOT A MOVIE FOR KIDS.<br /><br />You have to like South Park to really get into this.  There are puns that make you really groan, and if you are watching the DVD version, the puppet sex scene is much longer and frankly sickeningly funny.  The sarcasism is as thick as the stereotypes.  I would like to think that writers were downloading the story line from Darth Cheney's darkest fantasy.<br /><br />It is funny in a mindless over the top way and is good viewing if you need a few good laughs at some really bad stereotpes and jokes.  In other words this so bad it is down-right funny.

B003ASLJPY|5.0|Recommended viewing.  Should be incorporated in American History course education. A most entertaining and informative film. A truthful and accurate depiction of a significant event in America's history that also revels the sickness of America social constructs.
B006H8BIIM|5.0|Honestly one of the best strategy games i've seen on Amazon. Kudos to the developers. Game modes are well defined, quick to understand.
B007U1FEJE|3.0|Just an OK CD. Sounds are great but the lyrics are a little lacking. Will have to listen some more to see if it gets better....
B007SGM084|5.0|Great books- downloaded to Kindle app for iphone so I could read it wherever and whenever!  Love the trilogy although the last book isn't nearly as interesting as the first.
B003TJR2HS|5.0|I bought this converter after my iPhone 4S would not fit into my speaker docks once I put my Otterbox Defender case on.  Since I use one speaker as an alarm clock and another to play music throughout the house, I was really disappointed when I thought I wouldn't be able to use them anymore (and couldn't really live without the Otterbox Defender with a  20-month-old running around).  Enter, this adapter!  Now, I can easily dock my iPhone on my speakers.  Takes about 5 seconds to attach, and I'm ordering a 2nd one so that I can keep an adapter with each of my speaker docks instead of carrying it back and forth from room to room.  Very, very pleased with this product.  Sounds quality is unaffected by the adaptor (tested putting the phone without the Otterbox on the speaker just to make sure and couldn't tell a difference in sound volume or quality).  Highly recommended for this use!
1442419814|5.0|i really loved this book i could not set it down! i wish more people would read! i mean if you find books like this you would really want to read more! i mostly read romance and stuff but this book is awesome i have read the whole series i would recamend this book to anyone
B007P6VM04|5.0|I listen to this cd in the car all the time. It sings in my head when I'm not driving. Wonderful music, voices. Smashing cd!
0440178002|5.0|I am an avid reader, often 10+ novels a year, and I don't often re-read any book - but this one is worth re-reading.<br />There is intrigue, conspiracy, interesting narrative, and a main hero-type plot which is never too cliche. A highly enjoyable piece of historical fiction, worth reading all 1,100 pages.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game! love the graphics., very well put together.  very easy concept., run from the monkeys don't trip or get caught. very addictive
B007SYWFRM|5.0|my kids play it all the time... never had any problems with it... they poke that it shows a preview of the next movie
B0034G4P8A|5.0|Thor is a brilliantly directed movie and it is also visually appealing. The actors are superb and their all the Marvel films, it is probably the best directed and beat written. This is a buy you won't regret.

B006JPS1OM|1.0|ordered three of these G5 games after playing Paranormal but it's a good thing none of them cost me anything as all THREE WON'T DOWNLOAD to my Kindle Fire. Useless.
B007I2BZIE|5.0|As most rush albums for me it takes some listening to before I become a believer. When I first listened to this album I felt like this may be a bad album. I love rush so much that I really get dissapointed when for even a moment I'm not feeling their work at all. But then it happens, I force myself to keep listening and low and behold it becomes clear. Almost like a miracle this album went from a great dissapointment to my favorite album since signals. This album in my opinion is in the top five of all rush albums. Rush is so dynamic that you can't even compare some albums to the others. Like their first six albums can be compared amongst each other but not to the rest of their work. You can't compare caress of steel to power windows,two totally different albums yet each album is a five star album. Clockwork angels is a five star album like vapor trails,power windows,signals,permanent waves. Different from five star albums like hemispheres , a farewell to kings, fly by night 2112. This album after you keep listening and listening reading along with the lyrics will prove itself of greatness. In my opinion if you have a 12song album 7 of those songs need to be great in order for the album to be a five star album. The great songs are bu2b,clockwork angels,carnies,the anarchist,seven cities of gold,the wreckers, wish them well and the garden which is a top twenty all time rush song maybe top ten man.thats eight great songs the other four are very good songs as well, not one weak song I love this album I haven't been as excited since moving pictures

B0088RQ4X4|3.0|and it was what it is,,,a little bit better than OK Sci-Fi and well worth the rental price.<br />Would I watch again or buy it? No.
B007SGM084|5.0|I enjoyed reading the trilogy, in fact I had a hard time putting it down.  Yes it is full of sex, not sure I wanted to learn about all those details, but I eagerly kept on reading.  It was interesting to see how her love for him changed him from the role of the sex master to a loving husband. I was fascinated by the story and could hardly wait to find out what was going to happen next. I'm so glad I bought the trilogy as I did't have to wait to get the next book, I could just keep on reading.
B005UBNL0A|5.0|This CUP can feed my 6950 2gb card with unlocked shaders and over clocked. Not much else has to be said. Why spend more on a CUP? If your are building a gaming rig you will be better off spending more money on your GPU and running this bad boy over clocked. Will run 4.0 ghz with stock cooler, will go higher with good setup but really it is not going to help much with in game performance.

B0054JZC6E|4.0|it is a good game. really great fun to pass time. but it can become quite tedious when trying to get the points for more games.
B006R8GK2Q|5.0|This game is very addictive.  Lots of levels in each chapter.  Very challenging.  Story is interesting.  Great app for free.  Recommend highly for anyone who likes hidden object games.
1594744769|4.0|This book was entertaining, but not what I was expecting. The pictures are indeed creepy, at best. Peculiar at their worst. Some of them are downright unsettling. The story itself will hold your attention, but it isn't scary in the sense of Horror. It felt like the author was really stretching sometimes to make the story fit the strange vintage photos, and it fell flat at times. It would've been better if the story was allowed to be the main theme with less of the photos used. The writing style felt more like Harry Potter, and would be suitable for teens.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This bible app has everything I need. Also when I submit issues they fix them very quickly. I feel So blessed to have my bible even where I go.
B0060FXBNM|5.0|This is an excellent deal.  I'm never interested in bonus disks and this gives me the 3-pack Transformers bluray collection at the cost of a single Transformers bluray at the shops!
081095415X|5.0|Words cannot describe the beauty of the photos in this book. If you love animals, Africa or photography it is a MUST-have!!
B007MDB71O|5.0|The movie starts out with the great swashbuckling battles scene, however the sailing ships are in the sky and everything looks science fiction techie. Those resettled in for what looks to be a great sci-fi movie we are soon transported to New York City in 1881; there we find a man in a crowd trying to elude a different man. A telegram sent. And a mysterious message is received by none other than Edgar Rice Burroughs.<br /><br />I will not give you a blow by blow description of the movie as that's why you're going to watch it and see how it unfolds. For people like me that have read the 11 books in the Barsoom series it is almost impossible to convert to a movie. And they've tried this story before with such luscious actresses as Tracy Lords in Princess of Mars (2009 video). At least they got one thing right in that movie a \\"blond haired princess\\". Luckily they put more money and time and CGI mixed with actors' expressions in this movie. Keeping in mind this is a movie many of the timelines and activities needed to be rearranged for one coherent viewing.<br /><br />Again I'm not going to go into details of the makings of the movie, location, or unique sets. If you get one of the many DVD versions they will assuredly have the standard DVD extras. If you don't watch all the extras, be sure to use the voiceover commentary.<br /><br />Even if it hits you strangely in the opening of this movie hang in there because as it goes on you will become more intrigued and realize that the movie itself separate from the books and separate from previous attempts is a great standalone introduction to what hopefully will be a series of movies.
B005LAIGW8|1.0|I didn't listen to the oppressed masses and rented this.  It was terrible.  Nicolas Cage proves, once again, that he is without talent. Since I couldn't wait for it to end, I just returned it.  Peter Fonda isn't in this film so they just show Satan's mouth.  It seems that the rest of the cast also dropped out.
B0079J28NC|5.0|In my case that was 1969. That's when I saw this in a double billing with Barbarella (1968) at West Point, NY.<br /><br />The music is great and it brings back a part of history. Can the Beatles save Pepperland? Remember we all live in a Yellow Submarine. Instead of just buying the soundtrack, buy the movie and you have them both. I guess I will have to buy it also to hear &quot;Hey, Bulldog!&quot;  Of course as with most movies there will always be someone one that prefers the original and knows that it was cut that way on purpose.<br /><br />And now it is time for a whole new generation to enjoy.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|fun game. I like that the games are challenging. but hats that some costs so many coins. wish they could cost less
B007C3TVNA|1.0|I was REALLY looking forward to this movie. Rave reviews, suspense, and Tilda Swinton. How could it go wrong? OMG, I was not prepared for how horribly wrong it could go. I gave two hours of my life (that I can't get back) to an inexperienced writer and director. (sigh)<br /><br />*****SPOILER ALERT*****<br /><br />Working in the mental health field makes it hard to enjoy psychological thrillers because so often, the writers don't do their research. They create characters that don't exist in nature. Kevin was one such character. His behavior didn't match any diagnosis, so I could only conclude that he was born evil. That makes this a horror movie, not a psychological thriller. That also meant that he didn't have to have any reason for his decisions. It was totally random, which is emotionally unsatisfactory. I just spent 2 hours trying to get to know these people. I don't want to feel like everything happened, \\"just because.\\"<br /><br />Kevin's method for doing what he did (trying not to totally spoil it) is inexplicable. I do what he does. He didn't have the appropriate equipment to complete the task. His \\"efforts\\" weren't lethal. He could have easily been taken down if there were a lot of people in the gym. He would not have been unscathed or the only one standing. Again, poor research or incomplete information (or the film didn't show enough to overcome these observations).<br /><br />The plot advances largely from thoughts inside Mommer's head. Unfortunately, it takes a while to catch on that you are inside Mommer's head, so it just feels like the action is randomly jumping forward and back. I was 30-40 minutes into the film before I had any idea what was going on. Even then, it was only a vague understanding of the story. I get that sometimes things don't come together for a while, but since this movie really didn't make it there, in retrospect, I feel like I should have used that first 30 minutes as a clue to to give up and move on.<br /><br />It feels like someone said, \\"Wow, we've got some great raw material to work with and show off all my artistic creativity.\\" Unfortunately, all the artsy tricks can't make up for lack of research, poor writing, and just not filling in the blanks.  This movie doesn't answer the question of what happened to Kevin? What was his motivation? Why was the community so hateful to the MOM? What did SHE do? You don't get any sense of who the victims were or why they were chosen. Without that information, it all just seems senseless. While I am not heartless, my reaction is, \\"So what?\\" There was nothing here to make me care about any of these people.
B001PBEJL4|5.0|The quality of the DVD is excellent, sharp, clear and the color vivid.  All in all a most delightful musical movie. Judith
B007VTVGAQ|4.0|Listening to this album now several times, every listen has been different; as in the lyrics for example. Emotionally deep and passionate, that which resonates from Apple's haunting and angelic voice. This seems very much to be a deeply personal album for Fiona, singing of her relationships and feeling low in life, expressing it wonderfully in each of her songs.<br /><br />My favorite track - \\"Left Alone\\",(with a sweet swing style on the keys), she sings, 'How can I ask anyone to love me, When all I do is beg to be left alone.'<br /><br />Her piano is at its best on this album, hitting those low notes, deep bass and songs that have a tribal feel, great background instruments add depth to each song.<br /><br />This is a fantastic album, well produced and for fans, should be a treasure.<br /><br />Favorites include:<br />- Left Alone<br />- Periphery<br />- Daredevil<br />- Jonathan<br />- Valentine
B006H8BIIM|5.0|The reviews that are less than four stars make no sense at all to me. This is a deep, good-looking, well-designed and fun game. Honestly, try it and see.
1451648537|5.0|This book was EXCELLENT.  Isaacson manages to bring Steve Jobs to life --an intense, brilliant, creative, intuitive, often obsessive and &uuml;ber-controlling leader who built one of the modern world's most valuable companies by focussing on THE PRODUCT, thus bringing about innovations that changed the world, again and again and again.  He was a difficult guy to live with and work under: demanding, unreserved and sometimes abusive, but in the end he usually succeeded in achieving what he wanted: the best technological products, encased in simplicity and beauty.  Ultimately this book reminded me that \\"what you can dream you can achieve\\", because even when engineers claimed it couldn't work, when business managers complained about costs, and when designers balked about redoing their work because of time constraints, Jobs made it happen, through sheer belief that EVERYTHING is possible.  I am now a (reaffirmed) Apple and Pixar fan forever!

0307592731|2.0|I know what Cheryl felt like on the Pacific Crest Trail because I felt like that reading her book. Neverending. Arduous. But without that whole enlightenment part.<br /><br />[Warning: Spoilers] Wahhh, I did heroin and cheated on my husband and my life's a mess. Wahhh I'm too tired to even masturbate. Wah! I slept without protection and got an abortion! I lost my toenailz. Had sex anywayz. I'm a feminist but my bookbag is SO heavy. I have godzilla skin on my hips because my backpack weighs so much! Did you know I like sex?! Seriously: she had this problem with sleeping around with men and toward the end of her trek she's STILL sleeping with strangers. Her body made all these changes but she's STILL the same person on the inside!! So pardon me for not finding that inspirational.<br /><br />Her mom died and I feel super bad about that. But I couldnt really follow Cheryl on her journey because I just can't connect with someone who refuses to learn from their own mistakes. It's fitting that she had a hard time reading a real compass because her moral compass was also off-kilter.<br /><br />Should have read about Bill Bryson's trek across the Appalachian Trail instead.
0446547654|4.0|Another good read by Sparks. Ending was a little sad, but sweet. This book was good but I was not blown away by it. I figured out the ending well before the end and I was hoping for a happily ever after but was not the case.
B006H8BIIM|1.0|Every day I check to see what free app has. A few days ago it was apps with dangerous Stickybroadcast twice in a row! Now they all seem to have in-app purchasing! This game would be great if you didn't have to spend money. The game design is very fun. I can not stand the IAP, though. It should only be in always-free apps, not apps that are free for a day.
B003YCI1O8|5.0|Hello, if you have not yet had the pleasure of watching this  early nineties classic than get ready for quite a ride! Tremors is a film that embodies the spirit of the 1950's Monsters Invade a Small Town type of movies.<br />A small town comes under attack by creatures that can only be described as the character's describe them: GRABOIDS!!!! Part of the fun of the movie is that while some scientific language is thrown around to try and<br />explain the creatures behaviour, ultimately the characters do not spend a lot of time discussing where they came from and instead concentrate on how the hell they are going to get rid of them. If any of you are Kevin<br />Bacon fans, this film is one of his best comedic/action roles. His line deliveries as a good old boy are hilarious and completely believable. Fred Ward plays his friend and the two of them have a great chemistry going on<br />in this picture. The supporting characters are also outstanding especially Michael Gross(you'll never think of Family Ties again), and Reba McEntire(you'll recognize that lovely country twang in her speech) who play some<br />of the greatest monster hunters in all of movie history (you'll have to see their first encounter with a beast to believe it).<br /><br />I'm not sure what else I can say to convince you to watch this movie, except for the fact that it alsocontains a great supporting performance from 80's genre superstar Victor Wong (Big Trouble in Little China,<br />The Golden Child, The Last Emperor). He is very funny and I believed that a man like Walter Chang could have actually started up a food and supplies store in a small town in Nevada. I would say this movie<br />would be OK for children aged 11 and up. The younger ones might get a bit scared at a few of the more suspenseful scenes. Oh, did I mention that the practical effects are incredible, yes there is a slight cheesiness<br /> to some to the shots but that is part of the movie's charm. However, most of the effects, including the monster's POV, are spot onand totally believable. You will believe there are underground monsters hunting<br />the good citizens of Perfection, Nevada! I would strongly recommend this film for it's liberal use of comedy, sprinkled with just a bit of horror, and a healthy amount of buddy movie thrown in.<br />Do yourself a favor and watch it immediately!

B0086700CM|5.0|I saw this game on my nephews kindle and quickly became addicted. now I play it all the time on my kindle. tons of fun!!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|these are awesome games that keep me interested...... they never get boring and they are really challenging but not to the point to where I don't want to play them anymore..... I would really recommend this app to anyone
B007V2UGPE|5.0|lots of fun. wish I could upgrade to the version on my aneroid phone where it tells the background stories.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I love this game!!!! reminds me of grade school.  there are lots of interesting and fun activities to do while playing this game.
B0083GQKQG|5.0|This is not a film about a psychopathic child, this is a film about the mother of a psychopathic child, its her story. Imagine what it must be like to be the mother of one of the Columbine shooters, imagine the guilt, this film deals how a woman lives with the sins of her son after he commits a heinous act.  We know from science that psychopaths are born not made and good decent parents can raise a psychopathic child but this woman, played brilliantly by Tilda Swinton, blames herself because she never liked her son, she didn't want him from the beginning.  The character blames herself because she knew all along that there was something wrong with her boy.  She goes on to punish herself by remaining in the town where everyone knows her story, taking a job that's beneath her and even eating her son's favorite sandwich ( strawberry jelly on white bread).  By the time this film ends you'll be exhausted by the weight of this woman's guilt, you'll feel the pressure of her anxiety and soul crushing loss.  Its not a terrifying film, its subtle and nuanced drawing a profile of the mother's existence and her choices.  Only Tilda Swinton could have tackled this role.  The child is depicted a pure evil and its impossible to have any sympathy or empathy for him except at the very end of the film when you realize he doesn't understand himself and didn't understand the motivations of his own actions.  Its only at the end do you question whether the child is really a psychopath or just a boy he reacted to the knowledge that he was never loved by his own mother.  The final scene brings up a lot of doubt as to whether he was really evil or behaving so because he knew his mother thought that of him.  Every action on his part seems designed to hurt his mother which is why he makes sure she's left alive to live with his actions.  This is a very intelligent script and not your pedestrian gore fest nor horror type movie highlighting the exploits of a psychopathic killer.
B007D2XSW0|5.0|I downloaded this a while ago &amp; just tried it, but rest assured I will be using it a lot more. It's quick &amp; clean doing just what it's supposed to do, edit. My only regret is that I didn't use it sooner :-)
B005LAIHRC|5.0|I just saw this the other day and feel it will be worth the money.  Screen adaptations of Broadway shows are never the same as the stage version, so you have to keep it in mind.  It is a really great story, though told in a comical way(and sometimes slightly disturbing), with the core of it being true to yourself and never giving up on dreams.  That is what being an artist is about, and considering I am an actor and musician, I know.  I feel that this is an encouraging and uplifting story.  It actually reminded me of why I started writing music in the first place.  As far as the characters, they are brilliantly portrayed, but the absolute best portrayals are the two leads, played by Julianne Hough(who plays Sherri Christian) and Diego Boneta(who plays Drew).  Tom Cruise was ok in his performance, but I could have thought of better actors for that role.  Alec Baldwin was surprisingly good as the ex-rocker turned bar owner, and Russell Brand, who I rarely like, was actually quite good.  Paul Giamatti's portrayal of the sleaze ball manager just wanted to make me jump on the screen and knock him out.  Overall, this is a really great comedy musical.  While I know I will not likely get to see it on Broadway anytime soon, I know I will be going to the production on NCL's Norwegian Breakaway, since I am sold on the show now(top 3 favorite musicals of all time).
0307279189|5.0|This book was everything I was hoping for, and then some. I initially read this to learn more about minimalistic running and ended up getting caught up in a very interesting and compelling story. You won't be disappointed. I did not know of Caballo Blanco's passing until after reading this book; this book is a great tribute to what they did.
0345803485|5.0|This is one of those books that is hit or miss with specific audiences. I am not a die hard erotica fan, nor am I a prude stubborn reader, but this book grasped me. I made the mistake of purchasing it and choosing to open it up around midnight one night, which left me awake till 6:30 am still reading! I could not put it down! I was incredibly sad when the first book ended, and all I can do is be anxious while I am waiting for the second book! While a lot of people are claiming it is like twilight-- I see no resemblance. Also, a lot of readers have claimed it is repetitive; which I will agree some words are repeated often, but the story and the erotic scenes make up for that more than enough. I desperately want Ana and Christian together. I can say my only disappointment is that I did not find it \\"too S&M\\" during the first book. Christian demonstrates \\"the worst he can do\\" during the ending, and I was left thinking: \\"that's it?\\" I guess that's why there is 5 books! I can't wait to read the rest, and I know that Universal bought the movie rights, so I can't wait!! Wonderful book, beginning the second now.
B006R8GK2Q|5.0|I have been playing this game through a variety of levels,and have yet to get bored or frustrated. the story line is interesting, not gory or violent, and could even be used as a vocabulary builder for younger kids. thanks G5!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this app is a lot of fun the only problem I have with it is that I cant stop playing!!!
B006H8BIIM|1.0|Greed.  That's the only reason I'm giving this app one star.  The game itself is slightly better than this rating would suggest, but the outrageous greed of the developer deserves to be highlighted and frowned upon by all thinking members of Amazon's app store.<br /><br />The amount of in app purchases required to progress in this game is outrageous and the base cost of $1.25 should be more than sufficient compensation for the work the developer put into this game.  Forcing players to pay in order to make progress in a game they already paid for is nothing short of a thinly veiled cash-grab by a greedy developer who doesn't deserve a dime of your money.  Amazon needs to stop putting horrible apps like this up as their Free App of the Day.  It gives off the impression that they just don't care about their customers.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|great app. lots to do. never bored playing. everyone should get it. Games are challenging and fun. easy to earn points to unlock new games
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Angry Birds Rio is an awesome game with many levels of play and fantastic themes and music.  I expected an entertaining game but 'Rio' completely exceeded my expectations.  Good job to the developers.
B00785P2QC|4.0|it was a really fun game. cool graphics. very entertaining. good for quick gameplay during the day. super fun time.
0061478784|5.0|It came in great condition, shipping I wish I could have had it shipped faster, only because I adore this book. I finished in within a week of getting it in the mail. It is such a timeless classic. IF you want to compare the cartoon and the book, don't even bother. the movie was adapted from the book, I think the book is way better by all means. the cartoon though is adorable in it's own way and I own that too. I could read this book over and over again. It's got love, adventure, a vain but kind wizard, a fire demon and a young woman cursed to be old by the witch of the waste. IT's a great book about their journey together and how the wizard and the cursed woman fall in love. No swearing, no sex and no horrible violence. It's a great book for adults and kids. It's family friendly to be sure.
B006OCM0G0|2.0|Yes its fun. The more you play the makers of the game start making things that were free cost gems that cost money.
B000HT3P7E|5.0|How I Met Your Mother is such a funny show, and it was great to be able to start watching it from the beginning.  Buying it used, I had some concerns.  However, the DVDs and packaging arrived in great condition, and the seller was nice enough to include a note saying that they hoped I enjoyed the DVDs, which was much more than I expected. Amazing. :)

B007D2XSW0|5.0|I have been looking for an ap like this and was happy to see the free version offered to us Kindle Fire users. It does everything I need it to do and more.
B006H8BIIM|1.0|A double whammy on this one... well actully triple. when are developers going to learn that openfeint is pretty much universally hated and just stop using it already? And a full version game with in app purchases? Just say no! In app purchases with free games is 1 thing but in a full version game? No way. No how. Not ever. I don't even care of those purchases are optional, they shouldn't be there. If I'm paying for a game I better get the full game otherwise the developer is simply double dipping and I will not stand for it and I will vote with my wallet and they will never see a dime from me.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This was the best of the 3 books and I loved them all!  Great story and women will love the combination of passion, strength, raw emotion, trust, devotion and vulnerability.
030788743X|1.0|Total popcorn. After you are done reading, the only thing left over is an empty stomach and a craving for a real meal. My brain will never forgive me for reading all of this \\"book.\\"  My only excuse is that I kept reading in hope that it would eventually say something worthwhile.
B005OT2YVA|2.0|No surprises left, and a highly predictable plot. But great action scenes and spectacular special effects. Tires hard to reinvigorate the first episode, but lacks the suspense and drama. My 8 years olds got a kick out of it. I got bored.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|quick game for killing time,simple controls,fun to play.<br />fun fun fun.just like the classic nintendo game we all know and love from the beginning.

B0063IH60K|4.0|The cards are too small when I hold my tablet horizontaly, but they're just right when held verticaly. I like the fact you csn replay a deal. I've always wanted that option in a solitair game. It seems to have all the options, and I don't think the ads are very intrusive.
B006JPS1OM|5.0|I think it is a very good game because I like games where I have to find things and solve mysteries
B005DN7W4G|4.0|Indeed a good flick to watch on Bluray. PQ and AQ is good.<br /><br />Wait to buy it at the lowest price you can find.<br />I did that before but later I traded it in for a gift card<br />since I knew I would not own it any longer.<br /><br />but all in all- good movie with good PQ/AQ although they could<br />have done better, maybe? =)

0345803507|5.0|The Fifty Shades Trilogy is the best series I've read. I couldn't put the books down. Read all 3 in 8 days. Some people don't like it because of all the sex but it's more than just a sex trilogy. I highly recommend this trilogy.
B007RXC3A8|2.0|This album that sounds like an American alternative-rock/pop-rock band. I listen to European metal because it does NOT sound like American \\"metal\\".<br /><br />Not a fan.
B006H8BIIM|5.0|The point of games is to have fun, and Space Frontier delivered that to me. Try the game out is my reccomendation. The base upgrades are cheap enough that you can upgrade after about every mission, the tutorial gives 30 credits after the first completion and can be ran through (grinding) about 3 times a minute. So do not listen to unfair ' grinding ' reviewers, I do not reccomend playing survival for credits, 25 mins and I only made 150credits, stick with the tutorial. Either way, the graphics are amazing ( the game includes an HD mode). Survival is great fun. You can buy a maxed out base, but I did not. Again, if u want a Maxed  out base then you'll have to grind, but the game is fun without being maxed. I've beaten the campaign without paying cash in 2 Hours. Solid game, would reccomend to everyone.
B004T2QZL8|4.0|Despite all the bad reviews, I went ahead and bought this app. It's super fun! I played for a little while and it didn't crash once. It's a really interesting app, and I would definitely recommend it. The only downside is that it can  get a bit repetive at times, but aside from that, I love it, and I'm going to go back to playing.
B002RV01Q8|5.0|This dvd is just great. It was the first time I had listened to songs by Enya and was not disappointed. It is a very relaxful dvd and is very sooyhing to listen to.
B004SBS8LA|2.0|The version on Google Play has been updated for months. Installing this one from Amazon causes Google Play to prompt me to update, which then causes Amazon to prompt to update. Very frustrating endless loop and Rovio still hasn't provided the update to Amazon.
0143038419|2.0|I am giving this book 2 stars because the author writes fairly well, and with humor.  I won't, however, be recommending it to anyone.  This book is a narcissistic trip through life as told by the author, who wants us to empathize with her as she leaves her moneyed lifestyle in the wake of her divorce....and has the luxury of traveling the world as she works through her angst.<br /><br />The navel-gazing became too much for me.  I can only wonder what might have happened if Ms. Gilbert had gone to Rome, India, and Bali to serve other people less fortunate than her.  That would have made for a much more interesting story, and perhaps she would have grown as a person.  As it was, coming along with her while she spent endless amounts of time contemplating herself was a true bore.<br /><br />Don't bother.
B000P7V45S|5.0|I,m really pleased with my purchase from Amazon. A Trick of the Tail by Genesis CD/DVD. It was delivered really quick after I,d ordered it. This is just one of the great Genesis Albums which originally came out February 1976. This Digitally Re-Mastered CD plus the DVD is a must for any Genesis fan. I would Recommend the service of Amazon to anyone shopping online. Thanks again.
B003Y5H5FG|4.0|I love horror movies and after reading the reviews when the movie was at the theater I fully expected to hate this one but I was very pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />It is not a strict remake, the movie has similar characters to the first movie but it actually is almost as good as the original but in a different way. It is much more of a straight up \\"bad vampire\\" movie, with Colin Farrell being about as un-sparkly as it is possible to be.<br /><br />It's hard to beat Roddy McDowell as Peter Vincent but David Tennant does a good job of bringing the character into the 21st century and I wish there would have been more of him in the movie. The same with Christopher Mintz-Plasse as Ed. This kid is great in everything he plays.<br /><br />Also, a big thumbs up for the cameo by Chris Sarandon, I love it when they use original stars in the new movies.<br /><br />Overall, it's a strong 4 star movie. Very fun to watch and just scary enough to even be watchable by the wusses in the family.
B004SEUJ82|4.0|My son was recommended this movie from school.  I thought it would be good to rent and see it with him.  This movie was really good.  The acting was superb.  However, I found it a bit awkward that the little Jewish boy had a touch of an English accent.  I don't know, maybe it was just me.  I think the actor that played the father, although he was quite good as an actor, I didn't buy his German character.  Now if they got someone like Liam Neeson, man that would've been much better.<br /><br />What I like about this story is that it doesn't give you everything right up front.  It leads you to various conclusions that you put together yourself.  Although it may or may not be the case, it does leave it plausible.  I won't go into details with some examples because I don't wish to give things away.<br /><br />The movie was very well filmed and the music was beautiful.  I won't comment on the ending, but in my opinion, it was very strong.
030758836X|4.0|I like the twists and turns although I didn't think it was so gripping that I couldn't put it down. The ending however was hugely unsatisfying. HUGELY. Might have been a best seller with the \\"right\\" ending. If you've read it, I think you know what that right ending would have been...
B001AQO3QA|5.0|What's not to love about this product.  It has all 4 Alien movies each with the original and director's cut / extended scenes versions.  So you get 8 'movies' and 2 bonus discs; \\"Making the Alien Anthology\\" & \\"The Alient Anthology Archives\\".  I'm not always a fan of extra discs as they can take up extra space but this whole anthology with all 6 discs is barely wider than an original VHS tape and the regular height for a blu-ray.  The discs are all in a glossy cardboard book within the outer glossy hard cardboard case. Has everything you would want with the Alien Series and great packaging which is why I refer to it as a 'PERFECT' set. So far the best blu-ray movie set I own by far. 10/10.
B005K0HDGE|3.0|My main criticism is that it is way, way too long. Rather then enhance the story, it detracts from it. \\"Let's get on with it,\\" was my thinking throughout.<br /><br />Too much time was spent on details about houses, surveillance devices and bookie joints. That time could have been better served (and with less prose) on character development.  I liked the main character - Jake/George. I liked the characters in Jodie and in Jake's hometown.<br /><br />However, I never quite understood why Jake undertook this task. Idealism? Curiosity? A sense of duty? Desire to do good?<br />I didn't mind the love story that got dropped into the middle of the narrative. It humanized Jake but, at the same time, it also didn't quite fit with his determination to \\"do the deed.\\" With his motivation unexplained, I kept wondering why a normal guy would abandon happiness for the unknown.<br /><br />I was completely bored by the time spent on the details of the Oswalds' life. It wasn't enlightening; it didn't help me to understand Oswald further. (Can much else really be said about him?) Who, then, was the focus of this story - Jake or Oswald?<br /><br />This book is in need of an editor: cut out about 300 pages and eliminate the words \\"obdurate\\" and \\"harmonize.\\" Make this a tighter, more focused story. Right now, its just another mediocre tale of time travel.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|my whole family lives the game a few suck when screen freezes or now it wont let us buy any more 720 or million dollar games but we still play beat ones
B007IXWL2C|1.0|How did this book even get published? Don't publishing houses have copy editors and other such staff to make sure poorly written manuscripts (such as 50 Shades of Grey) get published?  This book really seems like someone wrote this in a weekend and self-published the following Monday.  If that is the case, well, hey, congrats!<br /><br />The story line is actually somewhat compelling.  If you are so inclined to read this because of all the hype then find someone who has a hardback/paperback and borrow it.  Don't spend your $ on this.  You will be thoroughly disappointed.
B003XE1DM4|5.0|These are the most comfortable shoes, I ended up buying 2 pairs total.  They do run a tad short so buy 1 size larger.  The fit is more narrow then the typical Croc so your foot will not slide around.  I mainly bought these for watering the grass or walking my dogs when the grass was wet, but I found they are so versatile and comfy I wear them shopping and to work on causal Fridays.  I have high arches and these seem to give me the support I need.  You can get pebbles in them so if that bothers you wear a pair of cute anklets if you are walking through gravel.  Highly recommend!!!!  Get them while you can because Crocs is always changing their product line.
145162445X|3.0|I give this book credit for an interesting idea, namely, that \\"nothing\\" is a concept and not just a word. On this basis Krauss argues that physics is in harking range of fulfilling the age-old quest for an explanation of how something -- indeed, everything -- could have come from nothing. For by \\"nothing\\" Krauss intends a specific physical notion, which current physics prefigures and future physics may peg. Krauss criticizes both theologians and philosophers who insist that any concept of nothing that gives it a specific content is not really a concept of nothing but of something. I have to admit to being - or to having been - a philosopher of this stripe, until reading Krauss's book. Now I am intrigued by his claim.<br /><br />Both Krauss and the philosophers seem to agree on this point: Something (and in particular the universe we know and love) cannot come from absolutely nothing. From this Krauss would seem to rightly infer that the only kind of nothing it's worth talking about as the source of everything (not to mention, something) is a nothing that is something.<br /><br />But are not the philosophers still justified to wonder about this? At the very least, is there not a genuine puzzle here? Let me clarify exactly what I mean. I can see no fault in Krauss's procedure of requiring something, rather than absolutely nothing, as a starting point; and yet I cannot see how it follows that there is no further question to be asked. So note that I am not saying that the puzzle is how could something come from nothing; instead - as a result of reading Krauss - I now feel that the puzzle is how to reconcile the intuition that something cannot come from absolutely nothing with the intuition that clearly something DID \\"come from\\" absolutely nothing.<br /><br />I, like Krauss (and Dawkins), am rejecting out of hand that \\"God did it\\" is any kind of helpful answer. But one \\"reconciliation\\" of the two intuitions would be that the nothing-that-is-something has just always been - it did not need to \\"come from\\" absolutely nothing. But would it still not be a legitimate question to ask why or how this could be the case? Or if it is not a legitimate or necessary question, why isn't it? Note again: I'm not saying I expect Krauss to have the answer - only to acknowledge that there is a puzzle.<br /><br />Why did I not give the book a higher rating? Two reasons. First, it's not enough for a book to present an interesting idea. A work of writing intended for a certain audience should be fully intelligible to that audience, and this book is not. It certainly touches on utterly fascinating prospects (in addition to the aforementioned idea). But I was left with the impression that this book was written in haste and somewhat sloppily.<br /><br />Second, it is filled with lazy diatribes against the know-nothings (so to speak!). (That such an excellent writer as Richard Dawkins gives this book high praise boggles the mind. I can only account for that as an expression of enthusiasm for a fellow religion-basher.) The puzzle I have attempted to articulate above is a more refined puzzle than the one that motivated me to read the book in the first place. So I give credit to Krauss for that. But he shows little patience with those who remain puzzled at all. This I find an unnecessary intolerance and lack of intellectual humility on his part.<br /><br />It's too bad, because Krauss is discussing the Ultimate, and he has undoubted authority in doing so, and certainly also the requisite Sagan-like emotion to motivate him to explain it all to the rest of us. But he has allowed negativity to prevail over enlightenment, thus resulting in an inferior and disappointing product.<br /><br />By the way, Jim Holt's book, Why Does the World Exist?, provides everything one's heart could desire in an intelligent and  comprehensive discussion of the question: Why is there something rather than nothing?- it did not need to \\"come from\\" absolutely nothing. But would it still not be a legitimate question to ask why or how this could be the case? Or if it is not a legitimate or necessary question, why isn't it?

0307272702|5.0|After years of struggling to loose weight and not understanding why diets cannot work, I read this book.  It opened up a whole new world.  The pounds are melting off of me and most importantly, I do not fell any hunger between meals.  I am Type 2 diabetic, and because of this book, I have been able with my doctor's blessing to stop taking both my diabetic and blood pressure medications.  The key appears to be that a low carb diet does not trigger the starvation response and the pounds just keep going away.  Great book!!!
B000UR9QGW|5.0|Product Came as described. Movie was new as stated, seller had it packaged very well, and the shipping was extremely fast. Got the product way before the estimated time. Price was very reasonable. I would buy from the seller again and is highly recommended.<br /><br />It is an awesome film. I highly recommend watching. It is a low budget film but dont let that detour you from this great flick. The sound is amazing for an older movie, picture quality is really good. Audio=10 video=9
B0086700CM|5.0|I heard girls on my Goddaughter's softball team talking about Temple Run and I was like what is that? so when I got home downloaded the app for my kindle fire, and now I am glued!!

B006H8BIIM|1.0|this game is absolutely terrible. I wouldn't even call it a game. you can not even buy upgrades without using real money.
B0086700CM|2.0|I started playing and it is a fun game. But when I restarted a level my kindle fire crashed. Good game, but it can crab your kindle fire.
B007Z9QWVK|3.0|I had heard mostly negative reviews of this movie, so it was not my highest priority when selecting movies to watch on an 8 hour flight back from Europe.  I watched it after \\"Young Adult\\"(very good) and \\"Chronicle\\" (stupid) and of course it was free to me.  I was glad I did not pay to watch.  I have to admit that from a visual point of view the part of the movie that revolves around Wallis and Edward, rather than Wallie and whatever her husband's name was, is visually stunning (particularly the costumes, makeup, hair).  The contemporary part is flat and monochromatic and frankly all I could think of through most of it was \\"Snap out of it and leave him for Pete's sake!\\"  That was a marriage that was beyond dysfunctional.  I suppose Madonna was trying to send some message about smart women who nonetheless find themselves in controlling relationships, but it fell flat with me.  As for any historical interest in the Wallis and Edward part, you can forget about it - it is highly superficial (providing only a platform for the previously mentioned costumes, makeup, hair) and there were certain aspects that really bothered me (eg the height difference between the actors playing Wallis and Edward - in real life the difference was not that great and in the movie he towers over her).  As to whether the couple were fascist sympathizers or simply freeloaders who went wherever room, board and glamor beckoned is something I frankly don't care about - they certainly had poor judgment about where they went and who they were photographed with.<br /><br />The real standout in this movie and what made it absolutely worth watching was the romantic soundtrack by Abel Korzeniowski.  After I got back home I bought the soundtrack & I highly recommend it (but I also recommend either seeing the movie free or with a cheap rental and low expectations).
B005VT42BS|4.0|It is a really nice little program. Lists all the clients on the connection. Good for tracking down who's who. Doesnt clear old connections though. I'd like to see that feature..
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Easy to navigate and offline versions are really convenient! Live events are a great tool for churches to engage younger crowds with the ability to take notes and follow along during messages within the app.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|this app is very good because its just like having a Bible in your lap but instead its right here on ur device.
B005K17RU0|3.0|Fine i recieved this app from amazon.com and i have not been able to use it yet hope to be using it more now on thos new phone
B006H8BIIM|5.0|This is a fun space tower defense game, full of upgrades and strategies. There is an option, costing 99c, allowing you to acquire all the upgrades instantly. The majority of 1-star reviews are because of this IAP. Those reviewers are morons. Play the game (for free), review it based on how much you enjoyed it, and pay for the extra if you want to support the developer, whose time is NOT free.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|Just a pleasure to view this movies, 100% recommended , looking for more titles Like this, also predator related movies
B007SYWFRM|5.0|its ok for little kids<br />but be sure to keep an eye on the its very easy to buy items on this game without a credit card
B007D2XSW0|5.0|one of the best editing apps I've used and I'm so glad I got it as the free app of the day
B0086700CM|4.0|Temple Run is the new Angry Birds. It's fun and addicting, plus it's great for when you have nothing to do.
1567184855|4.0|The narrator was poorly chosen.  He's narrating the book like a drama or action-packed thriller.  A book of this type should be read very differently even when quoting the Dr's patients.  Sometimes the color he adds to the listening of the book brings the focus away from the importance of what is being heard.  Not criticizing the narrator who likely has great talent for other types of books---His narration is not a deal breaker but when paying $$ to know and understand information its better received without the &#34;drama&#34;.  Monotone reading would have complimented it better.  I won't rate the book as I have not finished it yet...but I already have come to the conclusion 40 minutes into it that I wish they chose another narrator.  Narrators CAN make or break a book.  10/25/2015  I HAVE FINISHED...it took a long time yes, but I read and study so much and many things it just took that long.  The book is worth your time and study indeed.  will keep this in my study for a while.  A note on the narrator,...I got used to him and about a qtrs. ways through listening, my dissatisfaction was neutral and not an issue anymore.  ps I had to rate it or else they would not have let me publish my opinion...so I gave it a 3 for now;)
B0063IH60K|5.0|I like this app because it lets you play a random set or you can try one that has been won before and challenge yourself to beat other people's times. The commercials are annoying but they do give you the option to skip them after no more than five seconds. It is a great app for free. I know I may be a little nutty but I also really like the sound the cards make.
B005ANZN3G|3.0|Lang Lang played some good music recorded in the Blu-ray.  The sound was good and the performance, from what I can see, is good.  However, the same could not be said about the video editing.  The scenes are no longer than 2 seconds.  I suppose the person who did the video editing thought that this is a rap/pop/dance concert and kept on cutting between different cameras.  That makes watching the virtuoso performance very difficult.  This technique is used in that pop culture to hide the fact all those movements since the music is simple and the dancing repetitive.  It would be hard to say what the viewing experience would be like should a more conventional video editing technique is used.
B007712XAU|3.0|Love Downton Abbey! The seller was great, but we got two season 1. NOT the seller's fault, whomever packaged the set made the mistake. What can I say about Downton...the acting is very good, the plot lines are well written. If you enjoy period drama, this is for you.
B005HSG3TC|3.0|Over all I think the cover is good, but not worth the price. The front cover and hinge is way too flimsy. One slight crack on the cover hinge will render the whole thing useless. I give it maybe a month or 2 of daily use before the hinge cracks. Not worth the price. Need to reconstruct the hinge design.
