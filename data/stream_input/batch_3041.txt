B005T87QCI|1.0|This update made my game download so I lost all my robots! Now I can't play as all the robots I paid real money for.
B008C20TDG|5.0|After struggling with paleo for the past year, I finally found a book that has kept me focused. Something as simple as the butter I consumed could have been keeping my gut distressed and I never even thought about it until reading this book. I would like any struggling individual to purchase this great book. Their approach to a whole foods lifestyle is like no other.
B00D7Z4GQY|3.0|It seemed to drag in spots but was a ok book.  Wouldn't re read it or suggest it to friends.
B00DJ80VLS|4.0|I won't deny it, when I first heard the album preview the band released I was not thrilled. I felt it lacked the proverbial knock-out punch. Still, I got the CD and when I listened to it again... this is their best release since 6DOIT. It has that feel, more musical and round around the edges so to speak. Where the band was favoring heavy riffs and shared vocals under Portnoy that were making me miss their earlier days- this release is way more melodic. Once I began listening with an open mind, I saw its brilliance. The way I can describe it is this CD is a 'musical whole'- it is no longer \\"great solo\\" or \\"great prog section\\" to describe the songs. The songs are 'whole' where every instrument is an integral part of the total. Thus, this roundness is a sharp contrast to even ADTOE. It's like the band was able to merge for this one!<br /><br />Again, I scoffed at the record the first time I heard it, so the fact that I like it so much is a testament to its brilliance.<br /><br />Illumination theory is a work of art, so is the rest of the CD.<br /><br />Also, James's vocals sound better than ever.<br /><br />The CD sounds as if each member was free to be themselves.<br /><br />As far as mix levels, etc. I'll let others bother themselves with that- I am glad this album was released, I can begin buying DT albums again!
B0041KKYDI|3.0|sometimes this movie is entertaining & sometimes its slow.  but its a good movie to watch if you have never seen it, you'll get a lot of shock & awe in this movie.
B002ZG97EC|5.0|It was exactly as advertised. It came with three different types of media. Blu-Ray, DVD and PC. It arrived quicker than I anticipated.
B0089LOG02|5.0|This was a wonderful book comparing the Foster system of today with the 1920's Orphan trains.  The 2 characters were well developed and described their situations.
B00CAUHF6U|4.0|Having just returned from South Africa and feeling the love the people have for this wonderful man it has been a pleasure to read his beginnings and developement.  Delightful!!
B00EY8BRGU|2.0|Nothing new here. Nothing believable, least of all the magic. But, Morgan Freeman seems like a nice guy so I guess it's good to throw him  few pennies by renting this. Mark Ruffalo in &#34;The Brothers Bloom&#34; is a better magic movie, but it's a little darker and won't deliver that bland American cheese taste that squishes out of &#34;Now You See Me.&#34; When I watch movies like this one, I have the same wasted feeling as I get from &#34;dinner&#34; at McDonalds.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I was hooked from the very second he was dropped by his fellow minions, had to MAKE myself put it down!! Absolutely love this app!! It's so cute and addictive!! Would've gave 10 stars ********** :-)!!
B000W8HC8I|5.0|Great book, reads like you would think a book on high flying, money and drugs would read.  A tour de force on Wall Street where the book is actually hones in something not related to money. It's a sad look into Jordan's life - rise and fall. Hope the movie knocks it outo of the park but I cant see them nailing this story.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I have so much about this book I finally decided to read it for myself.  The story line was good but I think the sex scenes could have been minimalized.  I am interested to see the movie.
1589946634|5.0|This is a great, cheap, travel sized card game I am always getting requests for when I attend game nights. Great balanced co-op game (we win 40-50% of the time) with variety and enough space to fit all four expansions. It's as good solo as it is for six.<br /><br />As for those who think the rules are bad all I say is sit down with the game and do a test run. It's easy once you get started. I'm no genius and I had no problem understanding the rules.
B0083ZBW2Y|3.0|It's okay and for teens i would not recommend this so that s that okay now. That s why i give it three stars
B002MQYOFW|5.0|...you're going to love the book.  After hearing that teenaged girls were gaga over this, I expected a fairly lightweight read.  But the main character, Katniss, is interesting and fairly complex.  Strong, and yet at times, vulnerable, she and Peeta bring morality and thoughtfulness to the issue of how to survive this year's annual televised gladiatorial bloodbath.  This interesting dytopian view of the world is set sometime in the future, yet I couldn't help wondering while reading, are today's reality shows so very far from this?
B008KYOCA2|5.0|This calendar is nicer than the one on the Kindle.  Does what is necessary for medium load calendar data.  Runs great!
B004DLPXAO|3.0|Clear and convenient, but not as comfortable, manageable or satisfying as I'd hoped.<br /><br />I'm a book lover, and find the tech version of publications rather like the CD was to the LP.<br /><br />Advantages are too dehumanizing for my taste.
1593272839|1.0|This is an awful book, albeït not awful in the manner of some earlier books on Haskell.<br /><br />When last I surveyed the literature, Haskell suffered mightily from a lack of accessible presentations.  Authors tended to use concepts well in advance of passably explaining them, such that presentations were dreadful knots.  If one were already familiar with the lambda calculus and with the notion of the monad, then one might still be able to learn Haskell quickly; otherwise it was a matter of moving back and forth through and across presentations, to untangle the aforementioned knots.<br /><br />Perhaps, in this context, LYAH seems like a good book to some people.  I believe that if one simply read the the book from start to finish, one could actually learn to program in Haskell.<br /><br />But, in presenting the material, the author displays very poor impulse control.  The reader is incessantly confronted with half-baked intuitions and pre-adolescent buffoonery which pads-out the length of the presentation to about eight times the length that it would otherwise be. (Most annoying, though mercifully few, are the attempts at language snobbery by someone who hasn't quite mastered the language.) So, most of it is verbal muck, and reading it is like moving through swamp.<br /><br />I would fear to work for or with anyone who kept this book on his or her bookshelf, except ironically.
B00EEDJM2Q|3.0|A bright and colorful game, &#34;Buttons & Scissors&#34; has a lot to recommend it.  But along with the good idea, its mechanical responses and challenge prove disappointing.<br />Free amusement however so it is worth the cost.
B0091WNK8M|1.0|Not something I would recommend unless you like idiocy and not much of a fun time. Very disappointed indeed!  Don't waste your time.
B008RKKUZ0|4.0|This was a very Good Movie!!  My 8 year old daughter loved it as well....  Will watch it again soon!!
B002SF9YNO|5.0|I have bought this movie as a gift for many friends. This movie is a &#34;must see&#34; movie for anyone and has been added to my timeless favorite movie list. This movie is not light and may be controversial for those who avoid the topic of death. Brilliantly filmed with beautiful cello music.
B001F6ZIXW|5.0|Very exciting show!  Charlie Hunnam rocks! You must definitely watch every season.  It keeps you completely engaged, you do not want to stop watching.
B008SO9M8Q|1.0|This book is a rant.  Style is uber heavy.  Reasoning specious.  The writer should find a new line of work.
B00F35B8F8|4.0|It was exactly what I expected from the next movie in the series.  Somewhat predictable, but overall quite enjoyable. On more word so I can submit this.
B00F35B8F8|5.0|When I saw the preview of the Enterprise crashing, my heart sank! Now I watching the movie as the Enterprise is approaching Earth to burn up in the atmosphere, I said to myself &#34;Here it comes&#34;. And low and behold the Renegade Enterprise come speeding by just missing the Enterprise to make the films signature crash into Earth!! Gr8 Movie!!
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|This is a delightful book and a poignant look at life, death, and aging.  It is a flawless book-- beginning to end
0802473156|5.0|Wonderful book to read for married couples or anyone else interested in finding out how to communicate with someone you love who most likely has a different love language. Valuable information that actually should be taught in school - I feel it would help our relationships in society as well.
B0013F1D02|5.0|I thought it was the perfect movie for a quiet evening at home.  I would most definitely recommend it to others.
B00280LYIM|5.0|I love this book. Percy Jackson and the Olympians is a great book to read. The author Rick Riordan has outdone himself once again.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|this game.<br />I did the timed puzzle for a long time, and then moved to stationary camera. My score on timing was great, but can't break my own record, no matter how much I try. This is a perfect game for me. REALLY love.
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|excellent game I like how you can buy the power ups and how you can be on the bird side or the pork side
B009KS4XRO|1.0|I am not buying points or wing dings. I guess it's the downfall of free games. I thought it would be fun but I was disappointed pretty quickly.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|awesome really cool game the one little problem wasn't anoph to take away a star but the coin regeneration thing kind of bugs me
B00CTSDDVO|5.0|You don't have to be a Star Trek fan to enjoy this movie.  If you are a Star Trek fan you will love it.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Loved reading this book!! The way it's written its so realistic. Makes it feel like that's really how we all would act, talk, feel, after a war with zombies. I'm dying for new information and have a few questions unanswered but overall an amazing book.
B00EXVZW6E|3.0|It's fun and definitely something to pass the time. I play on my phone and so it's a little small, but I found that there's a magnifying glass so that helps.
B00CFYAT6O|5.0|We saw them in concert in Richmond recently and wow, what a show they put on. They did most of the cuts from this CD and it's fantastic. If you can see them live, get tickets. It's interesting how the audience rocks out with Susan but gets quiet and respectful when Derek plays. Just a beautiful thing.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|very addictive, for the most part enjoyable, and then very fruststraiting, when you get stuck on a level you can't beat
B007R3AZNK|5.0|Can't wait to see this guy in concert in November! Great vibe to this recording - it's really fantastic overall. You won't be disappointed.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|you get to talk to people,and catch up with family that lives far away. lots of food to try. love it
B00F33E3C0|4.0|This is a very good German language learning tool for the intermediate student. Its selection of vocabulary is sensible and although its is written largely in the preterit,  it contains enough dialogue to give exposure to everyday usage.
B0082Z447U|4.0|This is another mystery that should be read by all aspiring mystery writers.  Collins is the master of the genre of English &#34;lord and lady&#34; mysteries.  In this book he changes narrators, so you have the information being given from various points of view.  Each narrator divulges a new secret or twist in the plot.  You as the reader start to put these clues into a pattern, lies? truth?  You are right in the story as it is told through each character's eyes.  It is masterful.  A long book but a satisfying read.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I love this series.  Have watched the entire series recently, and I can't wait for the next one to begin - in January.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|This a GREAT movie. Loved it in the theater and love it at home! Blu-Ray is awesome and DVD is great. The digital copy? Even more great and awesome!!!!!
B00AYB1KHW|4.0|Great fun little flick with lots of stars before they were stars. Great movie for scary movie night.  Kind of a twist on the Body Snatchers story line.
B00APDABX8|5.0|Excellent read. Never a dull moment.very well crafted. Talked so much about this interesting story that my husband is now enjoying this clever story.
B00FEN000S|4.0|This movie has a lot of action and would definitely recommend this for anyone who enjoys some action movies. Love it.
B00CH3DBNQ|5.0|Malala paints a beautiful story from a terrible tragedy. The poetic way she speaks about her home would make anyone want to visit. Her deep understanding of the political divide that tears families, towns, communities apart gives many who thought they knew what was going on a completely new perspective on Pakistan. I wish this book had a thousand more pages so I could keep reading and learning  about Malala's journey.
B00BRUQ3PS|5.0|This trilogy is going to haunt me for a long time.Some characters still make me laugh out loud, others sobering.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|this calculator is accurate and easy to use and it's a free download.  it's quick to find and use and is with me at all times.
B009YP9L7U|3.0|Waking up Married by Mira Kelly was a fun contemporary read. I liked the idea of the story, but was not impressed by the full carry through of the story.The beginning was well formed, and then it got a little confusing when we were going back a certain number of hours, back to before they were married. Then the confusion cleared up the story slowed down and it made for a decent story.<br /><br />I know my explanation is a little confusing, however, for the price you can't go wrong, try this story and if you don't like it then you will have lost nothing. If you do like it then you will have gained a good book.
B003G4W49C|5.0|The characters are deep and well developed. The plot is engaging. The physics are intriguing. The philosophies are profound. Best of all, just knowing Ender and his thoughts and feelings through his struggles makes me a better person. Mr Card has written a more beautiful and profound work than most authors can dream of.
B005CAPS0K|5.0|Very freaky. Great twist in the end. Need to see to get the second movie. Two thumbs up. 👍 👍
B0095MVOMC|5.0|Fun, fun, fun!  Well hidden numbers. Loved each scenery!  A challenge at times. These games are entertaining.  I say it again and again but it's true.
B00FEHXCIG|5.0|Robert Downey Jr. is amazing in all the Iron Man movies. We especially liked the uniqueness of this movie. Of the 3 I think this was our fave. Pepper is wow! in the one which took this over the top. Must see!
B00ESY77LO|5.0|Very entertaining...I loved seeing all the old cars.  I once had one of them that I was restoring.  Brings back fond memories.
B003Z49LYO|4.0|Loved the costumes and staging,, it was great to see this Tom Hardy novel ome to life? Will probably watch it again
B00005O3VC|5.0|Monte Python has created many unforgettable performances over the years.  The best of all of these is the Holy Grail.  When you come across people who have seen it (which is very often), they can invariably quote the script.
B008602KQI|4.0|An entertaining story of an alternate, future world with a heroic young boy and girl. Looking forward to watching the sequel!
B000HL2J0G|5.0|MacGyver is the baddest S.O.B. that ever lived. Besides that he is a beacon and a bench mark for the 80's and how cool we were.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|Easy to use to clear caches and more. Sends reminder if you forget. From start to finish of the 4 processes it provides takes no more that a few minutes.
B00B5HQKNI|4.0|Liked this Bond movie.  Full of action with great stunts which kept the film flowing.  Liked the song and introduction too.
B008FRFN7A|4.0|but....I can now print from my kindle to my HP E-printer!!  It's not that intuitive but, I figured it out and can print docs/pix and web pages (took me awhile to figure out how to copy and paste!).
0425263908|5.0|Got the 3 books at once and was very pleased. Happy I got them all together and in great condition.
B007SGLZP8|1.0|I have loved all Grisham's books, mysteries and novels, and was surprised to be so disappointed with his one. He is not a caper kinda writer and this book attempts to bring us a mighty big $$$ caper. He lacks the juice and the light touch for it. But the worst part was that the lead characters were so utterly humorless and unappealing. Even so, I look forward to Grisham's next.
0425263924|5.0|I could not have waited patiently for this book to arrive. So happy I got them all at once! Awesome!
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I have been waiting for this book to come out and to say I was excited when it popped up on my kindle last night is not a lie. I have no words. I am so sad and disappointed. Four is one of my book boyfriends and I was so looking forward to getting his POV. That little treat did not help how I feel about what happened in this book. I loved the first two, and will let everyone I know not to read this one because the first two will be ruined as was this series. Why Veronica? I don't get it?
0425263916|5.0|These books are good and have a nice plot. I have the whole set! Nice addition to my library! Awesome!
B00F8GYC1Y|5.0|Including this iteration, I have only played three forms of Angry Birds.<br />I loved the gravity mechanics in galaxy and was glad to see that they appeared in this game as well. It just made sense after all.<br />I also like the challenge presented by each character's tap ability. I recommend this version wholeheartedly.
B00FVZAPB8|5.0|I'm sure Paul knows how his fans feel about him. I called and had this CD/DVD put on hold for me and drove across town to pick it up. For some reason, I had to have it on the same day as release. Odd...because I felt the same way in the early '70's. The DVD is excellent and if you can choose, this is the version of \\"New\\" to get. I feel lucky to have seen him in Las Vegas and Paul is a joy to watch and listen to! He seems to do everything so effortlessly and makes sure you get your moneys worth by giving you a 3 hour concert!!! Sometimes you feel like you're in shock, especially when you see a stage full of fire! Most of his fans sing and dance and his concerts are so much fun. I'm not going to break down any meanings in his songs or go into detail because I think most people that do that interpret things wrong. You KNOW a musical genius when you hear one. Paul...XOXO from your millions of fans and we hope you have ever-lasting happiness. Rock on!
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|Chromecast was very disappointing. The picture was jumping and the audio was not in sync with the video. Don't waste your time and money buying this product.
0785153942|3.0|I was really hoping for more on the Kaiju. Decent backstory. Definitely not a necessary read to enjoy the movie.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|After reading the trilogy of Hunger Games, there was no doubt a movie would be made. I was surprised that the movie and book  were so similar. The actors and action scenes were Excellent !! I can't wait for the next movie.
B00ARHAAZ6|5.0|I picked up Steelheart after reading Way of Kings, and fully expected nothing less than epicness. I was not disappointed.
B00002ZMNV|5.0|For all music lovers, this show is unbelievable!<br /><br />Metallica combines perfectly hard rock and orchestra sounds!<br /><br />I just lov it!
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|I truly enjoyed playing this game. It's really fun and a little bit more than a regular hidden object game. If you like a challenge, you will really like this fun and interesting game. Be aware that you may need to spend a little bit of money, not on the game itself,but during gameplay. I am the type of player who likes to accomplish as many levels as I can as soon as possible. This is why I felt it was necessary to spend money on this game.
B007ZGBZHE|4.0|Preston and Child's books are always my favorites but the hero appears to be super human and a bit unbelievable.  Still the novel was good and I enjoyed the read.
B00005JLKB|4.0|Superman is my favorite and i enjoyed this incarnation, but do not be fooled into thinking that this is a show for adults. This is a teen show. But don't get me wrong, this is still a really good show. its fun and exciting and the characters are all charming in their own ways to keep you watching.
B002QE3CTY|4.0|From the first page to the last this story hooks you .I look forward to reading the next in the series.
B00ADS98FC|5.0|This film is so much fun. I lived with a college acapella group through college and loved it and though they did change up how easy it is for songs to come together (as was necessary for the cohesion of the movie) it otherwise reminds me so much of that time and those people. Singing through every day really does make the day better.<br />I hope this inspires more people to be involved with acapella singing.
B002SJKWZ4|5.0|Works perfectly as described and very easy to program. Only pet peeve is the vibrations that confirm which motion you have just done, therefore, if you just nudge it or are constantly moving it, it will keep vibrating because it thinks you are performing a motion/trick. It's a small price to pay though, for such a cool item. Purchased 7 of these and everyone loved them.
B009JZPH32|4.0|Well done with a wonderful cast and an interesting story. It's well shot and there's never a time when you are sure of whats going to happen. Though there is some stuff i wish desperately hadn't been in the movie, that's more personal opinion than anything else.
B00ELE8D4Q|2.0|I was expecting that this would be her best album ever, based on the hype.  It did not live up to expectations, and certainly not to the hype.  The music is okay, but nothing special.  If you are a dedicated Cher fan, then you might want this to complete your collection; but it will not be in the same class as the &#34;Best of&#34; album.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|great stories, amazing acting, interesting characters, and although the plot goes all over the place it is such an interesting season, which makes it well worth the craziness and confusion that is typical of this series thus far.
B005PK56TA|5.0|Season one is the best season in my opinion! It is very suspenseful, comedic, and kept me on the edge of my seat. I watched the first season in one day and I'm not a big TV watcher!
B001O5LVPI|5.0|if you don't have it, you need to get it. this movie is charming and has one of the more wonderful messages about family.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I LOVE THIS GAME &quot;CANDY CRUSH&quot; IT'S A VERY ADDICTING GAME  I ALWAYS PLAY IT ON MY CELL PHONE NOW I GET TO PLAY IT ON MY &quot;AMAZON KINDLE FIRE HD&quot; IT HAS GOOD VIEW &amp; I CAN SEE IT WAY BETTER ON MY DEVICE I LOVE THIS GAME SO MUCH &amp; I'M 22YRS OLD I THINK IT'S MORE FOR TEEN'S &amp; GROWN ADULTS LOVE IT ITS GREAT ! ! (:
B0010Z32OA|5.0|this movie is full of beauty and magic and the story of a love so true that we all (no matter how cynical) wish to have something like that at some point during our lives.
B00F5FBE82|4.0|Drake hasn't failed me yet. Money well spend. I like every single song on the entire album. Just wish he wouldnt make them so long.
B00CWVG1Z8|2.0|other than having a few good actors (not the 2 main characters), and some pretty effects this film is a waste.
B00CA6WLAE|5.0|I loved this book so much . It was great !!! Chris Colfer is a great author and a very creative person. My favorite character was Alex but I also liked Goldielocks and Froggy . I recommend this book to any creative ,imaginative,fantasy filled mind  .
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I hate for it to end! I love Stephen King, he can do no wrong.<br />He entertains me every single time. I wish he could write faster.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Being able to use this gadget on pretty much anything with a HDMI from my computer or android device, It has pretty much replaced my cable TV.  I love the computer version better because you can use it on tons more stuff but the android keeps getting updated and better.<br /><br />TO MAKE THINGS CLEAR<br />It requires you plug it into a usb or plug for power.<br />From android you have only a handful of apps available right now.<br />If you do it from a computer it's through a extension in Chrome, so anything inside a browser can be streamed.<br /><br />I am running it over a wireless-N network with no issues<br />If they added a screen function to android, I would get rid of my cable boxes haha
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love it,I hate it. I cant put it down. Very addictive. Very nice game for the whole famiily. Very pleased.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|The Fault in Our Stars by John Green is absolutely brilliant. From personal experience  with cancer in my family and having recently dealt with a loss from it, this novel helped to heal and gain perspective on the impact cancer has on people's lives.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|A very engaging novel that returns familiar characters but also adds a new and myterious dimension to a world in which some people Shine. It is powerful enough to make you care about the characters and suspenseful enough that you are never sure how it will turn out. By the end you will be mezmorized and glad you experienced what will certainly be an instant classic.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|First of all, I have never read a book by Stephen King that I didn't like, some better than others of course.  This paints an excellent picture of a recovering alcoholic with his many temptations.  I don't think this is the main purpose of the book, but it gives a good look into the mind of an alcoholic who is struggling to recover.  Dr. Sleep is a compassionate man who is able to calm the fears of very ill people, alopng with the help of a very intuitive cat.  Excellent reading.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love this game keeps me up all night occasionally.... If you have not played I advise you not to start as a warning cuz it's highly addictive! 😉
B001BANK32|5.0|I came back to read the Shining again after finishing Doctor Sleep, just to travel back to Danny's childhood. No other author brings characters to life like Stephen King. His books are just as engrossing the fifth time, as the first!
B00FWLDHSY|3.0|Great effects, terrible acting and dialogue.I would give it two stars but the premise and effects were worth watching. .
1600242197|5.0|audiobook-i drive a lot. compelling story and very well read by the actor.  luttrell also has a comfortable writing style-like he is having a conversation with you.  if you liked chris kyle's american sniper, you should like luttrell. then, if you like lone survivor, you will like service even more.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|love the game as it  test your ability to  solve the puzzles each time.  all of my friends play this and we compare where we are and on the levely it self.  thanks for creating this game
B00E1SM5UA|5.0|If you want to hear fantastic jazz covers of Beatles' classics, this is what you need. Meola is totally on fire, and completely on top of things. Being the virtuoso that he is, I'm not surprised that he could capture these classics and make them his own in a very unique way. Fans of the Beatles and jazz, pick this up for sure!
B00AYB0TOW|5.0|Excellent movie. Not necessarily even an homage to Judge Freed. Just a great cyberpunkish action packed blood bath. Two thumbs up
B00004Y6O9|4.0|Fine quality remaster. Really took me back to the days when I played along to these songs on cassette (yeah, cassette). So, the sound quality has definitely been upgraded.
1401922732|5.0|We have different sets of cards also. These prove to be different and enlightening. Happy to have added the set to our reflections.
B003TNM2K6|5.0|This movie is off the hook scary, with a horrific ending that will shock the heck out of you.  A must see!!
B009LDCXNY|5.0|There are no words that can justify this series! Been watching this show from the beginning and each episode is superb! Creativity and tremendous actors make this show thrilling and engaging! Jensen, Jared, Misha and Crowley are extremely talented!!! I have every season thus far!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Spend hours playing this fun addicting game.  You can't wait for those lives so you can reach the next level to find yourself stuck for days and days. Then suddenly you achieve the challenge and find yourself awaiting lives again. Loads of fun and challenging.
B00BGI086Q|5.0|Huge fan of Arrow! Can't get enough of Arrow! Therefore, I will continue to purchase every season to come! Magnificently written! Acting quality of the cast is superb!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|This book was purchased for my husband, and he had nothing but good things to say.  He enjoyed the read very much.
B001E75QH0|5.0|Our family is a big Harrison Ford fan.  This complete Indiana Jones collection was offered at a great price & with our Prime membership it was delivered in 2 days.  Perfect for family movie night!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I really like playing candy crush.  So glad candy crush is finally on Kindle.  I was disappointed, when I could not use my Kindle to play this game, so glad I can now.
B00947N6D8|4.0|Came on time and my son was happy.  It cost less than in the stores. I was a little hesitant to purchase this item but I am happy I did.
B007WEQ3K8|1.0|Please remove that new age yoga background, so I can use it .It is ruining the whole application.. otherwise looks good.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Awesome game if I say so myself and a really fun awesome gr8 game!  U should totally buy this game!
B00FFRAKRG|4.0|best korn album in years, i really dig this one, its easy to listen to the hole album, if ever your a korn fan you will like this one.
B005SDMDRW|5.0|There is a common problem with all Michael Connelly short stories, they are to short. He sets the hook early and gets you turning the pages, there just isn't enough of them.
B00E03ULJS|5.0|It's a Krewella album, what do you expect? It is a truly great album. The only problem is it leaves you wanting even more!
0894803123|5.0|It is a great book. Fun and easy to read. Instructions clear and good introduction of how B n J was set up
B00FAX6XQC|1.0|will not install on kindle fire or smartphone. disappointed. Icon is on but will not come off. app needs an upgrade.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I've been waiting for this app to come to the Amazon Appstore.<br />My brother plays it on his iPod all the time! The thing I don't like about the game is most of the levels are based on moves. It is a amazing game though!!:)
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|FUN GAME YOU CAN GET A LOT OF GUNS PRETTY QUICK DOWNSIDE ITS ENERGY TO PLAY WHICH SUCKS BUT OVERALL ITS A 5 star
B0053O89KG|5.0|I really enjoy watching these series, and seeing the partnership between the two main characters.<br />Looking forward to the next one.
B000Z27HLS|4.0|The girl liked like a girl and you know what is happening when her imagination is going astray.  The picture seems to quicken at the end..  Will have to read book.
B009ZE27US|1.0|Doesn't  work at all because it's a scanner and scanners suck because they don't work as well as games I prefer you get minion rush!
B004XVMCMQ|3.0|Frances plays her part well, The book will have to be read before I can tell what the real character and story are for sure.
B006YZHEB8|5.0|Item was received on time and in excellent condition.  It was well packaged.  This movie is very well know.  It is excellent and I recommend it to everyone.
B004SIP7AS|3.0|It is a modernized version, with a few good laughs.  Gwyneth whines a bit much for me.  She does appear to be young and that is a plus.
B00D7Z4GQY|2.0|Maybe it's me...but maybe again it's not. Is this a novel for people who may perhaps read just one or two lightweight books a year? This one was barely worth the effort. Slight of character development, those who populated this far-fetched and ridiculous plot could scarcely be told apart. May I suggest thatin future one vet a book first by glancing down the Pulitzer Prize list. So many ghastly books out there...this ranks up there with &#34;Gone Girl.&#34;  And why on Earth was such a fuss made about the day of &#34;The Truth&#34; coinciding with Good Friday? And all the mixing in of the very buttery hot cross buns? Again, meh.
0767020308|2.0|She belongs on todays sitcoms.  The other characters were fine, but she was so modernly caustic, if this can be said.
B00E9E4EC8|2.0|I ordered this album with the hopes of it being really good since it was Alan Jackson....Its just not my kind of music...
B000FC1MCS|5.0|Loved the book! So heart-warming and emotional, yet quite amusing. I'm so glad I read it, and would highly recommend it to anyone.
0762449306|5.0|I bought this for my brother for his birthday, and I wanted to keep it for myself. It's perfect for any whovian who wants a little TARDIS of their own. ＾● ᴥ ●＾
B00F91SCXC|2.0|Brad should have passed on this one annnnd the next! Hey Brad, it's NOT too late... simply return the check NOW and tell the studio the virus took your character out before the script for the sequel arrived! Run Brad, ruuuuun!!! LOL Perhaps the content that ended up on the cutting room floor was actually supposed to make it to the screen. This movie was D.O.A.  All hype no delivery. It NEVER developed... too predictable. 'Nuf said. *yawn*
B00FQAZ7PW|5.0|Lightning Bolt is another great album from Pearl Jam. I love the mix of upbeat and slower songs, with no 2 songs sounding the same.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Great book that will both make you laugh and cry at the same time. I am really looking forward to reading more books from him.
B000FCJZ3G|5.0|I've been doing some mind change rethinking.  You see when we think the wrong way, it shows in our life.  One of the reasons people stay broke in their lives is because they do not appropriate millionaire mindset thoughts and practices on a daily basis.  T. Harv Eker shows us how to begin to act and think like millionaires.  He gives us 17 lessons and activities that, if followed, will definitely help us to reprogram our thinking and get us on the path to certain wealth principles that can give us beneficial results when applied.  Everyone aught to read this book.
B004QOB8SO|5.0|I bought this as a gift for someone who would rate it 5 stars.  They like everything about the show and will be very pleased to get this.
B0058YPGVQ|5.0|Best bang for the buck. Great show. Great writing and acting. Product arrived perfect condition as advertised. Will order thru them again.
B00FQAZ7PW|5.0|Great album love the songs favorite album so far sirens is an incredible song can't wait to see them in concert
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Seem like a life time, been waiting patiently. Love this game, lots of fun. Enjoy the different levels and the pretty colors.
B00FJTYDKK|4.0|Great, funny family movie. A cool way that they mixed up the animals half this and half that, my kids guessing what animals they are. And the mother in law who never dies just teases that she will.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Great game but can be addictive.  Can. Be free if you urge the resistance to buy extras.  Just takes patience but all levels are possible without buying helps.
B000I55YV2|4.0|It is a classic. A lot of action. One of the only things that bothers me is that it is pretty slow in some parts.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|I was a little surprised to see some of my business short comings mentioned in this book.  I got a lot of great ideas on how to overcome situations and lean in.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I would recommend this game to anyone.  The graphics and directions are the easiest to follow.  Love, love, love it!!!
B00FWLSLJ4|2.0|Good if you're 13 y/o boy who is into mindless action with a cliche plot. Hosam Mansour loved it. Avoid
B00BYM5I1O|5.0|I don't know how the tunes just keep rolling out of Guy Clarks' head, but I'm sure glad they do, Although I take exception to the line about Telluride in &#34;Rain In Durango&#34;. The train runs from Silverton, my birthplace.
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|This is one that was a surprise when you got it! Enjoyed it. Started slow but then it seemed like the movie was over picked up fast.
B005GFPZYK|4.0|Interesting look from the eyes of one who's been there. Although it bounced around a bit too much, still a good read.
B00ERIUO02|3.0|The new Katy Perry album is another great pop production but the overall mood is significantly different from her last two albums.  Prism also doesn't have too many contenders that look like they will be immediate #1 hit singles on Billboard (like Teenage Dream did).  I would say the best options for chart hits on this album are the initially released promo track \\"Dark Horse\\",\\"Birthday\\" and \\"This is How We Do\\" which I actually dislike due to the boring monotonous chorus but would probably be a hit on radio today.  This album has themes of redemption, strength, overcoming, inspiration and there are more than a few religious references.<br /><br />My favorites tracks which all happen to have an air of feel-good anthems are:<br /><br />\\"Double Rainbow\\"<br />\\"It Takes Two\\"<br />\\"Roar\\"<br />\\"By The Grace of God\\"<br /><br />The feel-good accessible fun pop tracks are:<br />\\"Birthday\\"<br />\\"Walking on Air\\"<br />\\"This Is How We Do\\"<br />\\"International Smile\\"<br />\\"Dark Horse\\"<br /><br />I also want to call out \\"Spiritual\\" - it has elements of 90's Moby, EMF's \\"Unbelievable\\" and U2's \\"Mysterious Ways.\\"  It's a pretty awesome track with really airy ethereal vocals from Katy.  \\"Legendary Lovers\\" also has a unique middle eastern pop rock sound so definitely worth checking out.<br /><br />The remaining tracks are standard pop tracks which don't standout to me and will most likely not stay on my ipod for too long.  Im somewhat confused by how they chose which tracks were going to be on the deluxe version and also confused by why \\"Unconditionally\\" was chosen as second single.  It's a good song but will be surprised if it even becomes a top 10 hit for Katy much less a number 1.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I love Candy Crush.  What I hate is having to have people give us lives to proceed to a next level.  That is very very frustrating.  I use to play Hidden Express but had to quit cause I couldn't get anyone to give me lives for the next level.<br /><br />Otherwise I love Candy Crush!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Marathon watched this show and now I am impatiently awaiting season 4, if its still on.  Julian Fellowes, January 2014?  I will be there.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|He will read a whole book in a day.  Great series.  We bought all of them and more from the same author.
B007THA4FI|3.0|This book is about small town political back biting and scheming. The book is set in England and has numerous English words i had never heard before and had to figure out from the context of the sentences they were in. It's interesting but if J K Rowling hadn't been the author, I probably wouldn't have bought it.
B005HEFB6M|3.0|The plot seems very weak it's nothing new about what's being said all the technology is a bit dated and a lot of the theme seem not to be at all progressive it will do in a pinch
B00FN811SY|5.0|This new app for the Bible is amazing.  I am learning how to use it, but it is making my reading and studying so easy to understand.  This is a true gift.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|OMG its here I didnt know they had it on kindle fire hd I'm so happy gonna be a gammer on this
B000LYPM4Y|5.0|A great set of songs by the Fab Four! It really shows them in top form both vocally and instruments. The mixing is supurb.  The album arrived earlier than expected and was packaged very securely. The condition of the album was excellent as stated by the seller. I would add this seller to your list of preferred sellers
B00991TCOG|5.0|I love this girl!  She is amazing and this CD is great!<br />I have been a fan of her for years
B00F56AZK4|3.0|I was very disappointed that most of the puzzles required a purchase and also if you wanted to adjust the pieces<br />to &#34;rotate&#34; mode.
B004XWMXW4|5.0|I have been listening to these guys on YouTube for over a year.  It's great to have them on demand in my car now
B005544TRQ|5.0|Season 1 of Suits was a guilty pleasure not only is the dialogue quick and whitty but the character development is relatable and entertaining.  Seaon 1 made me very excited to keep up w/ the series and to watch Season 2.
B00DNDR29I|5.0|Beautiful album with lots of variety to the music, an uplifting great album!  It is an album you want to play again and again.
B00785P2QC|5.0|This is a really great time waster so cool just get passed the ads and constant whining to buy stuff from them
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|candy crush is a super awesome game with fun yet tricky levels that require you to use your brain.....its a game that's sure ti get you addicted....
B00EQ0CKRQ|5.0|This is the coolest game ever! The only problem is that there are no Porsche.<br /><br />Thanks for the update.<br /><br />Connor.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|The Dark Knight Rises was one of the greatest trilogy finales of this generation. The way they incorporated other characters subtlety with their own agendas was one of the many aspects that made this movie great. Besides from the main character, Batman, you can see how other heroes in the movie grow and become the person they were always meant to be. Without the other heroes in the movie, it would not have been the epic movie that is, The Dark Knight Rises.<br />I personally loved how they incorporated the comic into real life circumstances. They meshed the comic and real life together so well, that it is almost believable, but somehow impossible. I didn't, however, like that they kind of drifted from the main story line in the comic, but still made it a great movie to watch.<br />If you have already seen this movie, but never payed real close attention to the other heroes, I would suggest that you do. It makes the story more than it already is. You will begin to realize the severity of their roles and how it helps paint the bigger picture.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Starts out a little bit slow but really is a great read with a mystery that keeps unraveling.  Really enjoyed it.
B00FAX6XQC|1.0|The game froze and no matter what I do, I can't get it to resume. I've reinstalled it and it frozen at the same spot.
B00ARHAAZ6|5.0|Dystopian heroes. Not the usual telling. Great characters and exciting story. Look forward to more in this series. Powers of corruption and redemption.  Good stuff!
B00CSYRHG6|5.0|If you like Studio Ghibli, then you are already familiar with the quality animation of their films. This film does not disappoint - it's full of character, color, and emotion. It's a slice-of-life film that makes you appreciate friends and family.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Very challenging like most g5 games. Not so hard as to be discouraging. Looking forward to playing more g5 games in the future.
B000X2H8G4|2.0|I FOUND THIS AMPLIFIER TOO WEAK FOR MY NEEDS.<br /> NO OTHER DEFECTS WERE NOTED EXCEPT THAT THE DIRECTIONAL SOUND RECEIVER PROJECTION SEEMED PRETENTIOUS OR NON-FUNCTIONAL.<br /> OVERALL, THE OBJECT CONCEIVABLY MIGHT BE OF SOME POSSIBLE USE TO SOMEONE WITH A VERY MILD HEARING IMPAIRMENT
B00ESY7QXI|3.0|Loved the photography and the costumes.  The time period made for a great back drop and the cars were great
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Thanks to Stephen King for providing an interesting answer to a long ago question about what happened to little Danny. The story was great, well told, and suspenseful.  I loved it!!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Whew....I've been avoiding &#34;50 Shades&#34; quite continuously since it's release in '11...mostly because I usually swim upstream of the 'trends'! I finally caved whilst in the mood for something 'light' (??) and devoured the first tome in one night which led to a late night kindle d/l of the second volume and subsequently the third one the following day. I'm immensely pleased I waiting until all three were published so as to not be left hanging after the end of the first tome!! My tastes are all over the map when it comes to books & literature (gothic, classics, Renaissance, historical, scientific, etc.) but I have to say, though some of the sexcapades were repetitive, the Trilogy certainly was entertaining though in a fictional fairytale manner but the quasi 'murder for hire' thrown in for good measure was a welcome tangent...I enjoyed the marathon read!
B009RX7IX8|5.0|Had to complete our series and stay current with that is happening with Castle and Beckett!  Great interaction and plots.
B005QYKE2Y|5.0|I watch at least 3 to 4 hours of Transformers a day ... literally. So this is one of my favorite movies of all time. My other favorites are the other Transformers movies.
B0053O89KG|5.0|Stumbled upon this show well into the Fourth season so ended up going back and watching from Season 1.  My family loves the interaction among the characters.  Castle is such a &#34;real&#34; character and is hilarious.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|I wasn't sure about this, but oh man, is Homeland great. I was actually nervous during the season finale. That rarely happens. This show has just enough twists and turns to keep me hooked. Can't wait to start season 2.<br /><br />At the very beginning, I had a  hard time seeing Danes as an adult. I kept thinking back to My So Called Life. I got over that by episode 2.
B00915G6MG|5.0|WE love Gibbs and crew.  Season 10 completes our collection - to date.  When we feel like we need to see justice - NCIS is what we grab!
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Terrific hidden object game with rewards given for completing  hidden object games..able to use rewards for completing collections and using completed collections to complete artifact collections.  This game is challenging and never boring. I would recommend it to any fan of hidden object  games.
B009LDD1X0|5.0|Crazy and funny show that we watch when we need to laugh.  The interaction of the characters is entertaining and fun to watch it develop.
B005GHN2GG|4.0|It was a bit confusing at first, being thrown into a new world with not much background information but once you get past that it is a great book.
B008PZZYB2|2.0|Not one of Ben stillers best movies did not keep my interest.  Maybe others liked the movie but I have seen Ben<br />In a lot funnier movies
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I could not this book fast enough. Grisham writes great stories, realistic characters and  complicated plots  I loved this book!
0375842209|5.0|insight in what it was like growing up in Germany during WWII.  unique way of telling the story from death's perspective
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|Seasons getting crazy early! Can't wait to see what unfolds! If you haven't seen it I highly recommend watching it from season 1!!!!
B00FPH3YQA|4.0|LOVED 1 and 2 this was meh I'm glad I didn't buy it and just rented it. I would have been ticked.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Sometimes it is nice to play a game that requires little thought. The music and colors add a sense of happiness.
B006PIXKVW|5.0|This was a wonderfully written movie! Great for any age group. Eleanor Bron is a wonderful actress. Very heartwarming. I give it 5 stars.
B00APJLEGA|5.0|Very entertaining to Children and Adults!  Love the characters chosen for this movie.  My child watched it on our vacation.
B00F8GYC1Y|5.0|Its fun and stress relief<br />I like how you can be both birds and pigs<br />What's up Jedi Master of doom
0142405809|5.0|My 5yo granddaughter fell so in love with Room on the Broom that I thought I would try the Whale book.  We love it too.  It is not as special to us yet as Room on the Broom but I'm sure it will be.  Love the details in the illustration.  We have the Room on the Broom video and an-so-lute-ly recommend it.  It has so many little touches that make it fabulous.  For instance, I love the way the broom takes off - it glides perfectly, just as a good broom should.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Some of the puzzles are quite easy but others not so much.  This game draws me in and I really enjoy it.
B00CL0J99K|4.0|I liked iron man 2 better. I am sure this will not be the last one so I want give up thinking they could have a better storyline than this one.
B00CFNUMD0|5.0|Oh Shaun is our very favorite! Sure wish there were more seasons of these! We have had some quality family time while spending it with Shaun!
B00EMGUST6|5.0|One of the greatest albums of the year and one of the most solid Motorhead releases to date. Lemmy and company bring it with more energy, raw power, and musicianship than many younger bands these days. There's really not much more to say, this album is rock solid, well done, high energy, fun, and all Motorhead.
B00ARHAAZ6|5.0|What an incredible inventive mind he must have.  This is a very different story of the future, and it includes comic book type heros and villians without being childish.  There is also mystery and lots of action.  You will really enjoy this book.  I can't wait for the sequel.  Buy it for your Kindle.
B00009R6H2|5.0|I only received one quick release adapter plate.The item description advertises two. When will I receive the otherI only received one quick release adapter plate.The item description advertises two. When will I receive the other?
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|Full of interesting plots and great characters. I watched from the pilot through season two, and I cannot wait for season three.
B004TI5N38|5.0|I'm a Baldacci fan and Zero Day stands up to his classics. I would definitely recommend Zero Day to a friend
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Cheap, setup is a few easy steps.  I'm not completely sure it's going to change the world, or even my living room, but for the price this gives you some nice wireless options for sharing the things on your small screens when you gather around the large screen with the people you care about.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I don't spend money on my games. I know the companies wish I would, but reaching level 30000 isn't that important to me. Great fun and a blast to play.
B00COGZ8FU|2.0|Tom needs another Magnolia instead of this desperation to still be believable and appealing as an action star.  Take a lesson from Stallone and Schwarzenegger who actually developed a sense of humor over time, Tom; we all get old.
B004W1GCNC|3.0|Huge fan of Downton Abby - This is good but not as riveting.  It is worth continuing to watch the next season.
B0083EY9EI|5.0|Where did Emeli Sande come from? She has an incredible voice and her emotional depth in this song inspires everyone to sing along like it's their life experience. WOW hardly describes how powerful this song is.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I so would reccomend this game for anyone who would like to Candy Crush. For the very first time this is available on my Kindle Fire and I very much enjoy playing Candy Crush.
B000F0V0LI|2.0|The dvd is defective and cannot be repaired. Very disappointed as this was a favorite John Wayne movie that I had looked forward to owning.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Seriously, such a great series!  Love the plot and the characters.  I'm not sure they know the meaning of happy endings, but the rest of the story makes up for it.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|The casting and directing of this movie brought the screen to life and this is a MUSICAL! I was surprised by it. This cast singing?<br />Another surprise and also quite good. I didn't know any of these actors could sing except Anne Hathaway. Good movie! Good plot.
B00ATDOVNK|1.0|If you delete this app and try to get it again don't it's stupid it will freeze and you will never UN download it
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|Encourages me to do more research. I plan to try and verify these ideas. Mr. Aslan certainly puts a different spin than what I was raised on.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I'm addicted to Candy Crush I love it I can't put it down I stay up all night playing the game.
B00FRCNNVY|5.0|I found some of Anoushka's previous albums to fall short of what I felt was their full potential.  This album finally reaches the heights that I had previously hoped her music would reach.  Anoushka has always been a phenomenal sitar player, however some of her previous albums had a bit of a cheesy feel to them in their attempts to blend traditional Indian sounds with other genres.<br /><br />This album is a seamless blend of the enchanting sounds of the sitar, piano, guitar, tabla, and the vocals of Norah Jones.  I assume that some adjustments were made to the tuning of the sitar to allow it to blend so phenomenally with the scales and tunings of the western instruments on display.  I absolutely recommend this album to anyone with even a passing interest in Indian music or world music.  It is incredibly beautiful and soothing to the soul.  I cannot wait to hear her next efforts, based on her musical progression thus far.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|it was good and i enjoyed playing it. i hope that it is not just 10 rooms.give it a try
B008XGFZRQ|5.0|It is the best thing to happen to my family since the birth of the neighbor's squirrel. None of them knew they were robots.
B00B7Y0206|5.0|I love music and I can find any song I may need I also love to laugh so YouTube was perfect
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|Item was too difficult to set up and not compatible with my wifi system.  Manufacturer truly overstates the complexity of setting the system up.  Delivery and product were as described.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Flow free is fun to play and addictive. I enjoy the ease of use and the games are challenging .
B007IXWL2C|5.0|It's a great ending that keeps you wanting more!!! :) Another book about their life as a family would be wonderful! :)
B004SD5GZ4|4.0|Adobe Reader opened the information quickly with no problems. I enjoyed the ease of use and how simple it is.
B00ARHAAZ6|5.0|I have read many, many books.  I've tried to read Sanderson's other books but I felt as if I couldn't get a purchase on the underlying environment of the stories which were so fantastic that I couldn't relate.  For example, the Mistborn series which deals with so many far flung magical concepts that I couldn't focus on the characters.<br /><br />This book is quite different.  It's written in the first person.  The environment was not too fantastical.  There were roughly five to ten characters of interest.  The depth of the characters were extraordinary.<br /><br />Each of the characters developed in ways that I could relate to and which in some cases came as an incredible shock.  On a very basic level this is a story about the strengths and weaknesses of all of us.  They way the characters interacted, and matured along the way makes this a very enjoyable experience and causes reflections on our own strengths and weaknesses.<br /><br />This was the best book I've read this year hands down.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I would give this book 5 stars!!! It was such a enjoyable reading I couldn't put the book down. Recommending it!!
B000FBFMFW|2.0|I was disappointed by the second book in the &#34;royal assassin&#34; lineup.  The book seemed like it did nothing more than discuss politic of the characters.  Also, the main character conformed to his environment.  I read fantasy for inspiration or perhaps to escape my often mundane life.  This book just follows the main character as he conforms to societal expectations.  I kept wanting the character to develop in some way but I was disappointed.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I have enjoyed John Grisham for years.  But as you know, just because an author tells one good story or even many stories, this next one could be a flop.  I'm always a little hesitant to purchase a new book by a known artist or one I've enjoyed in the past, and it was so with &#34;The Racketeer.&#34;  However, once into it, I couldn't put it down and finished it in 2 days.  In other reviews, I've talked about reading stories I wished would go on, never-ending.  This is one of those stories.  I wished there was more; I didn't want the enjoyment to end.<br />A great book!!
B00EEDJM2Q|5.0|This grame is so much fun to play. You can reset the level if you get stuck. I'm totally addicted ! 1500 levels:-) you won't be bored!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is terribly addictive! It gives you puzzles to solve in different ways and times also.  But you can't put it down! ! It's a good thing it gives you only a few lives to work with at a time or you would never put it down! !
B000GWE44U|3.0|In watching this movie for the 2nd time after not really caring much for it the first time, I enjoyed Jack's &#34;campy&#34; portrayal of a deranged killer- I'm not sure Jack's portrayal of the killer was King's idea of him when he wrote the book, but, maybe. The wife and child are equally unbelievable, and I suppose that is what Kubrick wanted- All in all, the casting was weird, but ultimately worked.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I really appreciated knowing that and how Danny lived. Never disappointed. King has created a new generation of those special people.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|I like the speed of the jeep and the flight time<br />. the ability to do neck tricks is very cool.  a fun game to play
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I have been waiting for this app to be available for kindle users!  I haven't had a problem with this app and just love it!
B002HK9IDQ|4.0|I bought it for my French daughter-in-law. Its story line should interest anyone learning to speak English. The differences in American and British culture add to the humor.
B002E0HJTY|5.0|One of my favorites; having suffered similar emotional conditions I can relate to what goes through Path Adams mind and heart
B004GJYRA0|4.0|One of the best coming of age stories ever and a bonus as a look at how overcoming negative attitudes can improve relationships.
B0042EJD8A|4.0|Josh Fox captures the visceral effects of a widely touted energy extraction process showing the impact on land, water and people from documented first-hand cases.  The film shows the effects of suspension of the Safe Drinking Water Act that allowed the broad use of hydraulic fracturing for natural gas extraction. The episodes show a marked contrast to the romanticized versions in the TV ads for the industry.<br /><br />The film raises questions about control of land use policy, public health priorities, and the rights of citizens vs the rights of corporations.  It raises troubling questions about the fracturing of policy decisions, and the burden of proof of harm.  It raises questions about protecting our life support system: safe water, clean air, fertile ground and the biodiversity of species that support life on Earth.<br /><br />The film suffers from a rough production style, and has less impact than it might due to an &#34;amateurish&#34; appearance.<br /><br />The content is critical for people to know before they make decisions about land use. I have used it as a discussion base for both community development groups and for environmental policy classes.
B0045HCJRG|4.0|A funny spoof of the cold war, public morals and religion. Non-threatening satire, should be funny to all ages. Well done.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|So amazing about this novel ...<br />I see the hbo program but only three seasons<br />So I buy the kindle version for the next ...
B0000UJDLM|3.0|Humorous Sci-fi with a non-threatening subliminal pitch for tolerance, a child's view of adult authority gone astray, and a happy outcome. Early adolescent fare.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Fun at first, but very frustrating to get stuck on a level. Sometimes seems as if game causes stylus to stick. I haven't given up yet, but I am putting it aside for longer periods of time. Do like the colors and the action.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|I loved the book. It only toke me two days to read I could not put it down. Love it. Please make another
B002BIULQ2|5.0|We all thought it was a great family film because it had comedy and music and dancing... everything we love.  We love the songs, very inspirational, and we could relate to them because of things in our own lives.  I have country roots in my family and music also, so we all just loved it.  The butterfly song touched us so much.  We watched it last year at Christmas cause my friend was over for the holidays.  Her husband always called her his beautiful butterfly.  They are raising two little ones and going through some tough times, so the songs were very inspirational.  I always get chills on It's the climb too.  That's why I order extra copies for gifts.  We love Hannah Montana/Miley Cyrus and her family, and all her songs and movies have brought a lot of entertainment and joy into our lives.  Love, from the Mattera family, Elizabeth, 51, Mark 51, Mitchel, 11, and Claire, 8  You go, girl, and have a happy birthday on Nov. 23
B00BMKH5NW|5.0|Cather and Wren are starting college. A new life for each of the twins. Cath's experiences are beautifully offset by the Simon Snow excerpts and the fan fiction.
B003DT19F0|5.0|One of the best ever!!!!  Enchanting and very, very magical.  We all loved it!!!!  The script and animation was phenomenal.  Such creative writers and animators!<br /><br />Thank you for the magic!!!
B00ESY7QXI|4.0|The movie was very glitzy.  Worth watching for that reason alone.  I thought I'd have a problem accepting Dicaprio as Jay Gatsby.  Surprisingly, he fit the role.  Didn't expect that!  Had a hard time 'not' compairing it to the original movie with Robert Redford.  Hard not to do.  I have to say that I liked the Redford version better.
0823004325|5.0|The author is methodical in analyzing facial expressions without limiting his subject.  He uses skull structure and musculature to illustrate his points and teach the expressions.  It works very well.  I've been using the book for practice drawing faces and to learn facial expressions for caricature.  The book has an abundance of illustrations that work great for that.  I highly recommend it.
B0055B7IPE|4.0|I am a grandmother and I love this movie. It is so poignant. I definitely can Identify with it. Sweet all the way through.
B00ECU34ZM|5.0|Thought provoking movie, with good plot, & cool action.  My whole family liked it.  Not too intense for kids either.
B009LDD4V4|5.0|crazy ending to the series but kept us on the edge of our seat truly waiting for the new series episodes.  We ended up buying the online episodes just to find out if they could resume for marriage.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|It keeps your attention  and so close to the reeeaaall  stuff.......AND...... YUP.... BELIEVE IT..... REALLY....  NO..I MEAN... NO COMMERCIALS...........LOVE IT !!!!!
B0052GACNM|5.0|I was not syrprised at the folks on this CD wanted to &#34;Duet&#34; with Tony. time is running out and his voice is still great, If I was a talent of today I would certinally want to record with this icon before he re-tires or leaves us-GET It Today You won't regret spending the $
0385351399|2.0|I admit it, I only read the sample of this book. I can't be bothered to go on, the writing is shocking. I've read trashy magazine articles written better than that. Hold on. Actually it reads exactly like a trashy magazine - a cliche in every second sentence, whole paragraphs made up of common sayings instead of the writer using his own original language, clumsy character introductions....bad bad bad.
B00EQ0CKRQ|5.0|this game is freaking awesome i can hardly describe how beast this game is. people,please encourage gameloft too make better games and dont be mean because gameloft probably put a lot of time and effort into this. Thanks
B004EF65QA|5.0|very good, clean, enjoyable movie for the whole family to watch together. Enjoyed the time period and setting of the story also
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love that i can play a friendly yet competitive game with my friends who aren't bound to one device !!! That's a BIG reason why i like it...it's also more difficult than the average game of this sort. That's the reason i gave a five star rating for this game !!
B007EC27QM|5.0|i like the large face of it and is easy to use.  i gave away my other calculators.  i misplace things and always know where my kindle is
B007WEQ3K8|5.0|This is one of the best apps I ever got. It really trains my brain. Lucky it was the free paid app of the day.
B00006F2WY|5.0|Very pleased with the service and the product. This concert is very unique and I love it. It is a must hear for all.
031624662X|5.0|A surprising first novel that intrigued me not just by its intense detail driven approach to world building but also the strength of its core characters.  The narrative structure was also a unique touch that offered a truly different take on AI driven collective consciousness from a character driven point of view.
B00CKOYVG8|4.0|It says there is a new version of this game, but when I go to the app store it only says PLAY not UPDATE?  How do I get the updated version?
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Love this drama.  It never disappoints.  The characters are flawed and perfect at the same time.  Great writing and acting.
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|I am a HUGE fan of the show and the comics. I am glad I started the comics after the show though, die hard comic fans can be brutal when things don't follow exactly as they want them to. I've watched all the seasons multiple times and so far this has been my favorite (although we're just starting up) with season 3 a close second. It's not all zombies, the story is wonderful too, but if you like zombies you'll like it. I'm not a huge horror/Gore/scary movie kind of girl but I just love this. My only problem is, and it has NOTHING to do with the show, that Amazon seems to take forever to put the episodes up this season. I don't have cable and I have to buy the show, lat season I would wake up at five or six an  I would be able to get my precious walking dead. Lately I have to wait what seems like forever and people are already giving the last episode away! Ugh! I just hope next week I can wake up and watch it before work, since its my only &#34;me time&#34; lol. But I love the show!
B004EFYZ1C|5.0|In the past almost all calendars had the moon phases printed on the dates.  None of my present calendars have this information, but it takes just seconds to find out when the next new moon will happen with this program.
B00EXVZW6E|3.0|It's fun, but there's no real challenge and no adventure to this game. It's good if you have time to kill and don't want to pay for a hidden object game.
B00EGMQIJ0|2.0|This book portrays how a huge and seemingly benevolent Internet company called \\"The Circle\\" can destroy privacy and take over the world, apparently because virtually none of the characters seem to have any common sense.<br /><br />We're asked to believe that every time The Circle introduces a new product or service that intrudes further into people's lives (such as pervasive video surveillance even in people's homes, viewable by anyone), essentially everyone simply accepts it as fantastic and never thinks of - let alone examines - potential downsides.<br /><br />That is just nuts.<br /><br />There are only a handful characters in the book who ever seem to have a negative opinion about what The Circle is up to, and all but one only come to this realization extremely late in the game.<br /><br />It doesn't help that none of the characters are particularly deep or engaging; you never really end up caring about any of them.<br /><br />This book may be a worthwhile read for people who need to better understand the privacy-invading potential of today's technology, but there's nothing eye-opening here for technophiles, and the characters and events are too unreal to make for a convincing or engaging story.
B00D41AJ7G|4.0|My sixty year old mother told me about this game and I didn't think I'd like it, but I humored her. I think it's fun and sometimes very challenging. You have to actually your brain for this game, wow who would've thought of that! My husband and I both have kindled and challenge each other to see who has beat more levels, because we're weird like that. Little kids won't liked it.
140006922X|4.0|The TV interview stirred a lot of stuff up, but it was overblown. The book is pretty good, but it is not groundbreaking nor original. Still, it does make an interesting case for Jesus as anti-Roman revolutionary.
B00D1DBO1C|4.0|Works great, easy to use, and a good tool for people on the go but it does take some to enter each event.
B00ERIUO02|2.0|Her first two albums were very enjoyable to listen to the entire album.  This third release is lacking in that regard.  You will enjoy a couple tracks and add them to a playlist, but you won't find yourself listening to the remainder.  Buy a couple tracks off the album and skip the rest.
B00CL0J99K|5.0|My daughter enjoys movies and wanted this one for her collection of Blu-Ray DVDs.  After working all day she needs to relax and this is the way she does by watching movies.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|FINALLY able to get it for the Kindle.  Been waiting way too long for it to finally be available.  Thank You.
B000NDIAWY|5.0|great music.She has a beautiful voice. Very relaxing. This singer is now on my play list.listen to her often daily.
B00C33M2EE|5.0|i have bought the second dvd just to have it, but it is even better than the first one. i recommend both.
B00E1SM5UA|5.0|I'm here to write a short review, I follow Al Di Meola works and lives projects since 2001, I heard the whole discography and I can say<br />without any doubt this work have a special soul. Is like something is still playing inside your mind even after you close the cd player.<br />Because is clear that Al know and feel this compositions from him personal point of view and lived path.<br />Of course, all this stuff is played like only Al Di Meola can do, through him incredible syncopated sense of rhythm and him virtuoso technique.<br />This cd is a must have.
B007ZGBZHE|2.0|Too gruesome, too unbelievable, too long, too many Nazis.  I've read all the Pendergast books and this was just too much!
B002361MLA|4.0|Tolle has great ideas about the importance of the NOW. This book can be considered as a pragmatic guide to serenity rather than a speculative spiritual book.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|I just love those little gooey guys.<br /><br />You just have to see what trouble they get into next....<br /><br />A must have.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Stephen King did not disappoint! The character development of Doc from the timid (but brave) little boy in The Shining to the troubled man forced to &#34;dig deep&#34; was very compelling...I could not put this book down!
B00C5ZORES|5.0|This is a great CD. Their best since under the cork tree.  The guest artists like Elton john add some amazing vocals.
B004G5ZY7E|4.0|Very suspenseful!! A true rollercoaster ride!! So many suspects...the possibilities were a bit staggering. Never a dull moment with countless twists and turns...
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I'm so very happy that I can play it on my Kindle. I used to play on my computer but I'm sick so it's much easier to play now. I've had no issues what so ever, so now I can waste many hours playing.
B002CLBJPK|5.0|Years ago, I purchased this DVD from a store but currently, can't find it. So I had to repurchase it! That's how much I like this film! Its a really fun ole school flick that will have you wishing some stuff could really happen.A bed that can travel? Wow that's a pretty cool idea!
B002NEFL8W|5.0|It obviously doubles the battery life, best thing about using this battery grip is that it literally allows you to get a better grip on your camera.  Always had one on my last Canon so when upgrading to the 7D, this was the first thing I bought.  My opinion is this in a necessity for the perfect balance required to use the camera comfortably.<br /><br />In addition, if you shoot vertically (and most people should, more than they do), it helps immensely.  The additional shutter release and exposure wheel makes it much easier to do so.<br /><br />Grip does add some girth and weight to the camera, but that actually makes the camera easier to use.  If I get the same life from this as I did the one on my 60D, (over 5 years so far) I will be happy!
B00DKY4LBW|4.0|I really liked cd a lot more than I thought I would. There's the catchy sexy song that keeps being played on main stream radio right now and surprisingly the rest of cd is good! I was thinking maybe I should buy just the song so I don't up buying a cd for one song but like I said I was surprised! Good move for me and my happy ears and dark soul...jk.
B006AZZPCM|2.0|It worked great before the update. When it doesn't force close, it plays the sound without the videos. Wish I hadn't updated it
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|Love it! Such an awesome series! lots of blood and gore in this season, can't wait to see  what awaits us!!
B008EL25LE|1.0|Didn't get it.  Network interrupted download and failed to download again.  Maybe I'll rate it after I can download it next time.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|This game really is fun to play. Very realistic. Great graphics. Reminds me of the good old days back in MO when I used to go hunting.
B007A6XLDU|5.0|It is an awesome app it is good for when you need to.make some edits on the go or create doccuments wordspreads and presentations
B000FBJAEG|4.0|Baldacci always satisfies.  Surprises and twists keep you on your toes. Keeps you in suspense all the way to the final chapter.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Really easy read with real characters.... I would give it a 4.5 if we could give. 1/2 stars.  Interesting characters, and plot twists keep you interested from start to finish .
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|I have always loved this game.<br />Glad to see it on line. Now I can play with the gamers all around the world.
B006GLM5EQ|5.0|I absolutely love this series. I can't wait to purchase the remaining seasons. The dynamics of the characters are intriguing and I am very excited to see where the story goes from here.
B0086700CM|5.0|My girls and husband are addicted to this game.  So we need to limit the girls time on it.  Very fun.
B00821OX98|4.0|I like the show so far. It's a bit confusing with the dynamics of the aliens and the kids but I'm really hoping to have these answered or explained in further detail and the show goes on. I'm only on the Sanctuary Part 2 episode but overall and pleased with the show.
B00009V7PJ|5.0|This was a really great show.  Saw her live in Phoenix, one of the best shows I have ever seen!
B00FAX6XQC|1.0|Not really a free game as they say it is.  After you start they let you fire a single easy shot and then they take you straight away to the &#34;gun shop&#34; where you HAVE to BUY at least one gun before you can continue playing. I was so incensed by this practice that I didn't even try to investigate any more.  I came out of the app and deleted it inmediately.  As far as I could see with this app the only thing that you can do for free is to download it, After that you have to start spending money to be able to play it.  I felt cheated!
B002DQDV6Y|5.0|This is an exceptional movie based on a classic piece of literature. I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to learn about friendship,  loyalty and values.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Superbly well written. The story takes hold and won't let go!  Deceptively simple, it rolls along and just works. Didn't expect to even like it,  but read it nonstop in two days- was so hooked I could hardly put it down.  10/10.
B002DQLGHU|5.0|This is an exceptional movie based on a classic piece of literature. I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to learn about friendship,  loyalty and values.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So glad candy crush is finally available for my Kindle HD! Been waiting for what seems like forever to play it on here rather than my phone. :)
B00B5QGPZC|5.0|I absolutely love his songs and performance is the best . The songs are uplifting ,and inspirational.<br />He is a A STAR ,thank you<br />Regards<br />Biljana
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|The game holds my interest and makes me want to clear the board.  It is simple and straight forward in the concept and allows you to challenge yourself and friends that share the same passion for the game.  Addictive is the one word I would use to describe the game.
B00633W614|5.0|This was an intriguing story, with historical background, of how lives crisscross over the years.<br />There are many twists and turns.  When the book comes to a close, it leaves you wanting more.<br />The reader is in luck, because the chronicles go on with the lives of the characters.<br /><br />Many years ago, I read a brilliant book by this same author (Kane and Abel) that has stayed with<br />me all these years.  That book also was about how lives intersect, and how history can shape lives.<br /><br />This week, I will begin the next book in the Clifton Chronicles and am really looking forward to it!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is great!  I am so glad you finally gave us Candy Crush.  This game is so much fun and I can finally play it on my favorite device.  The game comes through so large and clear not like those small devices.  Amazon and Kindle Fire you did it again!!!
B0084B5TK8|3.0|Very intetesting to see where it all began. Interesting writing format. The climax of the book seemed to be a bit lacking.
B009WUBERW|4.0|A bunch of &#34;back in the day&#34; action hero's.  Shooting, kicking whatever it takes to get the job done.  Get it now!
B008P1EWIM|5.0|GOOD app for the weather, easy to adjust for location and great to have multiple locations at your finger tips
B00FJTYDKK|4.0|I guess the preview really made it to be a lot more than what I actually viewed.  My kids really enjoyed the movie so that's alright with me.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is the best game I have played and my kids like this game as wellxcycgxgxgdgxydyxgxgxgcychchcf duff dug tags gov d. D
B000IJ79UW|4.0|this will complete my shows for superman. I was surprise that the second superman movie has an extra 10 minutes on it.
B001EU79F4|5.0|Not a huge fan of Tom's overly theatrical stuff but on this, his debut album, he really shines as songwriter and musician. Feels like you're sitting in a dim-lit, smokey bar in New Orleans watching him play. Own it on vinyl as well
B0019IB0II|4.0|If you know someone who has had a stroke, this is a 'must read' book.  Jill Bolte Taylor gives a fascinating insight into the mind of stroke victims experience firsthand.  She analyses the physiology of what happens when you have a hemorrhagic stroke and how it affected her.  Very enlightening book and easy to read.
0525478817|3.0|This is a hard review for me to write. I knew this was a super sad book before I read it. It's obvious that someone dies. My daughter read this book in a couple of hours and told me how much she cried and how amazing this book was. It took me three days. I just couldn't reach that part that made me not want to put it down. The most interesting thing about the whole book was hunting this author down that they love so much. I can see me doing that. Other than that it wasn't that good. It was drown in pretty words that no teenagers speak in real life. If they didn't talk pretty and I wasn't wondering who was going to die the whole time I don't think it would have been that great of a book. I did cry but I didn't cry as much as every one else I know who read it. Maybe I am this horrible unfeeling person but maybe it's because I just can't relate. I'm not saying it wasn't a good book because there were things that I did like. There were quotes that actually made sense and there were things and people that I liked. I liked van houten. He was real to me. I like Isaac. I was not in love with Augustus waters. I don't know. I do know that to me, a great book is one where after I put it down, I can't stop thinking about it. I think about it for days and can't pick up another book. This one was not like that. I read, I cried, I was done, I put it down and I was over it.
B00ECU34ZM|5.0|Yes, this is another post apocolyptic movie. But do not under estimate this movie, if you are a scifi fan like myself, just be patient.<br /><br />The story takes place 60 years after earth demise, aliens invaded the planet leaving the human race hanging by a thread. It may not seem like it but the humans won the war.  Tom Cruise character is joined by his girlfriend and coworker as the two remaining human on earth to rid the planet of lingering aliens.<br /><br />While Cruise is left on his bounty hunting expedentions his gal pal is left at the home base watching a far, until Cruise discovers the truth.<br /><br />This movie is extremely scifi!! But this is a HUGE twist that will draw you into the movie even more.<br /><br />Good movie!!
B00FX8FQ76|5.0|I was sketchy about this whole new era and how she would follow up the massive success that her album Teenage Dream was but PRISM is definitely pure genius. Literally every song is a hit that could become her next single and climb up the charts to #1.
B00ADS98FC|5.0|Love this movie and the singing! It's one if those movies that will never get old! I will be watching this movie for years to come!
B003VPC72K|5.0|received the package in a super fast time, right before my girlfriend's birthday! this is one of the best album's from deftones in my opinion, and I'm glad i was able to share it with my significant other. Seller is awesome!
B005PK56TA|5.0|Love it .I am a prime amazon member so I get to watch no comercials .The show has lots of creepy parts and the suspence of whats going to happens next is driving me to watch.
B00ARN0ZF0|4.0|It's very very similar to the other movies, yet still manages to be scar. It's something that you feel like could happen to you today, which makes it scary. The streaming quality and speed was pretty top notch, there were no network or buffering issues at all.
B002VRNR1Y|5.0|Great film, awesome to be able to rent it online for instant viewing. I hope awards were issued to the stars of this show.
B007HB5TN8|5.0|I had to restart this book a second time because I just couldn't get into it at first and I'm so glad I did! It's a great book and Jane Austen knows just how to drag you in. I look forward to reading more of her work!
1609611543|5.0|It was very informing on wheat in a diet. Good to read if you are having problems with wheat it exlains why you might be having problems.
B002ITWSUQ|5.0|I went to the bathroom while watching this. I laughed so hard that I lost my mind then I smoked a log. Would you like it too?
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Fast paced and as always scary..... read with the lights on<br />always wondered what happened to Danny and it was worth the wait....
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|Already had Angry Birds Seasons & Space but wanted to try earlier version. Just as challenging and entertaining. So simple a five year old beats me consistently. Great family fun!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Dr Sleep is a very entertaining read.  I found myself thinking of the story throughout the day.  Every chapter seemed to end as a cliff hanger.  Stephen King still on top of his game.
B009CF3MEK|3.0|Good movie!!Was my first time seeing the oroginal i I saw the new one but this version pretty good as well!! A must see movie,
B004OR1XGK|5.0|This book is the bible of software development. It is well written and gives solid advice on constructing code well.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Very addictive!! Great game to take up some spare time during the day or night, Sweet n tasty lol!! Have you got what it takes to get to the top!!
B00FEN000S|4.0|Exellent 'godzilla' type movie. Lots of great special effects and decent music.  Action packed and very American styled. Loved it so much!
0140177396|4.0|It was for an English class overall the book was wonderful. Love the ending and can't wait for my next purchase.
B00FPH6M82|2.0|1) Did not find the dialogue between Will and Jayden flowed well.  It felt forced.<br />2) The evolution of the animals was not well highlighted,  since it was said that everything had evolved to kill humans, the only thing that really showed that was the leech.  A troop of angry baboons is just as dangerous now. Also why would the eagle save him after catching him for food, then he failed saving its chicks... makes no sense.<br />3) Jayden Smith maintained the same constipated facial expression throughout the entire film.  No excuse for that!<br />4) The special effects left much to be desired
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Go read this book right now person lol holo pokemon! It's really good take my word for it bro lol
B000N5F6OW|5.0|A Great Movie For The Whole Family!! John Wayne Is The Man!! Sit Back & Enjoy The Duke Along With A Great Cast In A Great Movie!!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Absolutely an enjoyable experience. The characters  fit the time and their acting draws you in. Watching it uninterrupted is the way to go.
0812550706|5.0|i really liked the novel - it is well written and ahead of its time. Good job, author Orson Scott Card
0545265355|5.0|Great buy! books came exactly like they look in the picture, They came in that box and were in great quality. For anyone who hasn't read these they are a MUST READ!!!
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|Amazing movie!!!!! Enjoyed it from start to end. Almost as good as the first one but thats hard to top.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Loved it! When I started the first one, wasn't sure it was for me. But, then it got better. The second book was even better - hard to put down. Really felt like you were part of the story. Highly recommend!
B001TH16DI|5.0|Though I may never unwrap or watch these, I will be leaving them to my Nephew who is also an avid Star Trek fan! They arrive in a very timely manner and well packed. &#34;Live Long and Prosper!&#34;
B00AATFJK2|4.0|This is an oldie but a goody. It's an interesting idea for a Sci-Fi story, its fun to watch. I gave it four stars, even though the acting seems a little contrived, because I enjoyed it so much when it was first released.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So happy this game is finally available on Kindle!  It is just a simple match 3 sort of game but addictive -- and frustrating.  Thankfully I have other matching games to go to when this one puts me in 'time out'.
B007V65R54|4.0|I enjoyed the book and thought it bright new ideas to the forecasting profession.  As a forecasting professional, it made me think again about my approach.  I'm excited to try the Bayesian approach in what I do and to see how it works!
B00FPH6AXE|1.0|Let me start by saying that I'm a big fan of the Sci Fi genre - not dress like Han Solo and go &#34;trick-o-treeting&#34; when it's not even Halloween, but a fan. I enjoy the stories. That being said, this was one of the worst movies ever. Even Will Smith's usual charisma (which gets killed here anyway by his character who is supposed to be this emotionless military type) couldn't pull this movie out of the depths of mediocrity. I appreciate that Will Smith was trying to create a major bonding experience by making a movie with his son here...and that's commendable, but boy was Jaden the wrong kid for this role! Maybe my opinion is unique, but that was the worst $5 that I've spent on a movie. It Sucked!
B00E3IZIM0|4.0|One of the reasons I loved this movie so much is because it tapped into some of my greatest childhood fears.  If you ever had those sweat induced nightmares of giant monsters chasing you relentlessly, you'll feel a reminiscent thrill of foreboding in multiple scenes that will conjure up your old nightmares.<br /><br />Why this movie was not a bigger hit here in the States when it was released in theaters is a mystery to me.  But I can say that a lot of Americans who love action movies are going to kick themselves for not watching this outstanding Action/Adventure movie on the Big Screen when they see it for the first time on a humble TV.  This movie was made for the Big Screen!  The scale of giant robots and monsters were simply breathtaking on the Imax movie screen.  The 3D gives the movie a greater sense of perspective but it was not filmed to be an 'in your face' style 3D movie.  If you can shell out the few extra bucks for 3D, go ahead and do it.  If you're tight on funds, you're really not going to lose much in the way of visual experience without the 3D.<br /><br />As far as the story-line goes, it is the perfect 'us versus them' popcorn thriller.  The movie is a 5-star movie but I simply cannot give the Blu-ray 5 stars because you lose a bit of the 'Awesome' experience when watching the movie on a TV versus Theater screen. There are only a handful of movies I would actually say that about.  Of course, if you were one of the many people who didn't go see this movie on the big screen, you won't really know what you missed out on, but for me, there was a definite difference in seeing it on the two different mediums.  I will say however that you do notice more of the details of the movie with the Blu-ray version than I did on the Imax big screen.  This is both good and bad depending on the quality of the CGI in any given scene.<br /><br />The 3d cover of the Blu-ray is one of the better ones I've seen.  Anyone rummaging through your 3d movie collection will likely stop and stare at this cover.  My wife, who is not a fan of the big blockbuster action movie, was surprised that she actually liked this movie.  The character acting is done in more of an 'Anime' style that actually works.  Anime tends to be a bit over the top when it comes to its characters, but Guillermo del Toro did an excellent job of finding the right balance between live action and anime for the actors and they were fun and engaging to watch. If I had a criticism, I agree with other reviewers, I wish that the other Jaeger (Big Robot) pilots had been fleshed out a little more.<br /><br />Del Toro's love for the anime genre comes across in so many ways with this movie and I personally applaud him for the incredible job that he did.  If you love the Big Budget action thriller, you can't go wrong with this movie.
B0084P9202|5.0|A different kind of album, but this is in a good way because Valtari may be a bit more Pink Floydish than other Sigur Ros works. I think every one of their albums is a masterpiece. It's like they had a lot of ideas and stress to get out of the way before crafting the next trip up Iceland way, Kviekur. It certainly lays a mossy path on the way to their next lp, Kveikur (which I think is one of their top 3studio albums).<br />Five stars in relation to other music, but if rated in comparison to other Sigur Ros discs then it is a four.

B009YMNZJS|4.0|Story line leading into PoA is believable.  Virus spread to human race a bit simplistic and straight from Outbreak (though only a minor point to the movie).
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It's about time this is available on the Kindle!! I'm ecstatic, been playing on my phone forever, jealous of my friends that were able to use on thru iPad, now, I'm no longer jealous....lol, and I don't have to use my glasses to play!! Woohoo!
B008YU0AOE|5.0|Have this app for my iPhone and it works just the same on my Kindle Fire HD. Gives me a quick ability to run through costs and percentage off pricing which is mainly what I use it for when shopping.<br /><br />Great app, does what it is supposed to do, calculate.
B00E1SJDSW|5.0|I highly recommend buying this album on vinyl.  If you're a fan of Bill Callahan, it's definitely worth it. Yes.
0143039431|5.0|An older wiser me enjoyed it much much more than when I read it as a high school student. I assume age and experience were the major factors in my decision.
B001TH16DI|5.0|Item came as shipped. Perfect condition. It was a great price to get the whole collection. I especially wanted the extra disc with the Captains' Summit.

B00ECU34ZM|2.0|The only interesting thing about this movie was knowing that he was filming it when Katie Holmes devised her brilliant scheme to leave him.  Now THAT'S the kind of movie I WOULD LOVE to see.
B0089LOG02|4.0|Some years back I met an elderly man who rode one of these trains, and heard of the mistreatment he suffered.<br />This book sounds like his story. Thank you Cristina Baker Kline, for the interesting book.
B001EC0OMW|4.0|Hammer films does well again. Peter Cushing is great. If you like early horror films this is a good one. I definitely recommend it.
B004SEUJ82|2.0|Unable to watch as my players can't read it. Any suggestions on what I can do. This has also been the case with all four DVD I have purchased
B004HWYTP4|4.0|Great movie but could have done without the f word. one whoso three four five six seven eight nine ten.
006212725X|5.0|Loved it.  Really liked reading about Pete's influences and life.  He is very forthright about his life.  Perhaps there is a bit too much detail at points, but I think that's what you get with a &#34;no-holds-barred&#34; autobiography.
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|Great version of Angry Birds.  Cool new birds.  You gotta love Jar jar. Its fun and challenging. A great way to kill downtime.
B004HO6I4M|5.0|The grandparents in our family love it as much as the grandkids.  We have watched it many times and it never gets old.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|The theme seemed silly to me until I played it. The gameplay is fun and whimsical. It is deeper strategically than I thought. The theme now is strangely nostalgic to me now and the candy looks real enough to actually crave candy while playing.
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|Life's hurts & pains can either crust over & fossilize our hearts, or be chipped away one step at a time. Harold' s pilgrimage does just that. Beautiful piece of literature.
B00FEHXCIG|4.0|Same actors, same plot - saving the world, but I guess that's  what you come to expect with Marvel movies.
1490313370|3.0|Okay, so yes, some of what you write I agree with; sometimes you make those sweeping statements that leave me saying and thinking, &#34;Wait a minute.&#34; I do love your image of our having to keep our internal fires burning: that image alone and how you communicate it are worth the price of the book.
B00FPGSPQU|3.0|This movie wasn't bad.  I'm definitely not wasting my money buying it.  Would likely only watch it again if it were on Netflix or the Dish.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|This is a very good app it is wayyyyyyyyyyyy better than dear Hunter reloaded. You can do a lot of stuff. It is totally worth it. It's free to.
B00CD7ICBW|5.0|Well made film. Don't like the idea of teens killing teens but is a good look at the future we are headed towards. Everyone needs to watch this then look at the daily headlines.
B004MC0FO8|4.0|I love music in special old records from 80's or 70's and many times it was difficult to identify who was singing and which was the song, now this is a job for Shazam, Shazam helps me to identify and then take note of the song in order to buy it later.<br /><br />Excellent program and better android application
B0040YR546|5.0|This movie shows how much trouble social media sight's can create for someone. Still, a hero comes to pass and finds out that being a hero sometimes comes from within without powers. Well acted and nicely produced. One of my favorites.
B00FEHXCIG|3.0|Third installment was more than disappointing, if there is a fourth? Hope it's better than the last one, maybe !!!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love, love, love this game. I am so hooked on it. I am happy that I can finally play it on my Kindle. Great game, very addictive.
B0078XGEK2|4.0|I great book. If you are trying to figure out things in your life, this book might help. 4 stars because it gets a little wordy at the end
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Loved all three seasons, I can't wait for the 4th season in January, I wish there were more shows as this.
0385350864|5.0|The truth of the matter is: my mom ruined this book for me. No sooner had I learned of its eminent publication, and had ordered it with great anticipation, than my mom blurted out: \\"Oh yes, I hear what's-his-name leaves her or dies, and she had to raise his kids!\\" Gaaah! I am a person who likes to be surprised completely. I wanted to stomp on my mom's toes, but I didn't.<br /><br />I was of course disappointed to learn that Mark Darcy meets his demise in book three. However, I feel it was very daring for Fielding to take on this new phase for Bridget Jones. Both Fielding and Jones deal with what people don't like to think about: death. Fans can whine about the loss, but to me, it shows maturity and a dedication to identify with real people, and THAT is what the saga of Bridget Jones has always done. I think it's brilliant.<br /><br />In all, this book has equally accomplished what the first two books in the series have done, and that is: let Bridget give people hope. Just because she ages doesn't mean she suddenly becomes peaceful, perfect and serene. If you're truly in tune with yourself, you'll know that many of your frailties only get worse as you get older. Like many, Bridget is weak, vulnerable, distracted, insecure, regretfully multi-tasking and multi-tasked, obsessive and tormented. But her stalwart qualities of being a devoted friend, a kind stranger, and an open-hearted, beautifully lonely individual, give her strength to know all that is good within herself, as well as all that is broken, yet can be healed. I love this character, I love that Fielding has been fearless in making her real. I love that my friend, Bridget Jones, forges through life and all its disappointments just as erratically and as blunderingly as I would, but gives me more hope than I can give myself. Bridget remains an inspiration and a gem, and Fielding is a fantastic writer to say the least. Three cheers for the Singleton at 50-something. I am renewed and refreshed, and I'm still justa delicate, young 47-year-old. XoXo Helen!!!<br /><br />p.s. The New York Times review of \\"Mad About The Boy\\" is dippy. And no one has mentioned the nod to Jane Eyre in the final scenes of the book. ... Assuming of course that Jane and Mr. Rochester did not exactly devour one another on a fluffy hearth rug when she returns to him and he is of course maimed and embittered and blind ... Or did they? ;)
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Finally this game is available!!! I love playing this game. It is so addictive. You will not be disappointed, great download.
B00FEX2ZFG|5.0|Best &#34;paranormal&#34; movie I've ever seen!!!! I would highly recommend this movie to everyone that wants to be scared! Great movie!
B0027MJU00|4.0|I liked this book-I'd enjoyed Gone Girl but wasn't thrilled with the ending.  I think this book had a better finish, but there were still some unanswered questions-can't put them here, don't want any spoilers.  I also like the way the story was divided among the characters, it gave it a better perspective than only being Libby's point of view.  I'd recommend this one.
B00FHNBDC4|5.0|This is a &#34;great&#34; album for just hanging out and chillin'. It is a really diverse lineup of songs and has great sound quality. It is such a unique and balanced blend of country, blues and soul that it only seems natural that Amazon would call it pop.<br />I really like Amos Lee a lot and this is a great example of his ever evolving sound.
B007REV4YI|5.0|I love the new series of James Bond films.  The path and production quality is so much better than the last two sets of Bond films.  Daniel Craig is real and the action is more intense!
0060837020|5.0|For a used book, it looks like new! I was surprised to get it in such a good quality! Satisfy!
0143122010|5.0|Review of Pinker's \\"The better angels of our nature\\" by Paul F. Ross<br /><br /> Steven Pinker's book came to my attention as I read Schmidt's and Cohen's The new digital age (2013) in which they spend half their book treating what they see as the role of \\"the digital age\\" in revolution, terrorism, conflict, and combat.  Schmidt and Cohen mentioned, in passing, that Pinker<br />___________________________________________________________________________________<br /><br />Pinker, Steven  The better angels of our nature: Why violence has declined  2011, Viking, New York NY, xxix + 802 pages<br />___________________________________________________________________________________<br /><br />observes that human violence is declining!  It meant, of course, that the Schmidt-Cohen concern about terrorism and inter-state conflict potentially had less relevance to the world's future.  On seeing the reference, I knew that I had to read Pinker.  And that's what I've done.<br /><br /> This book by Pinker is one of the most important reads I've had in a very long while!  His thesis is that violence by humans has been in long term decline and is at the lowest level now ever experienced in all - he means all - of human history.  Take a moment to absorb that idea.<br /><br /> Pinker gathers data from archaeology, anthropology, psychology, political science, economics, evolution, neurology, paleontology, game theory, criminology, and every other discipline he can find to examine his thesis.  Pinker himself works in psychology at Harvard University.  He presents nearly 100 graphs in which an indicator of the frequency of violence is plotted on the vertical axis and time is plotted on the horizontal axis.  All his graphs display slopes showing high violence rates in the past and low violence rates recently.  You think he's manipulating his numbers?  He's not.  The rate - very carefully understand \\"rate\\" and capture its meaning - of violence (say the count of the number of incidents per 100,000 people per year) shows a decrease in every instance.  Well ... perhaps not every instance.  He has graphs that show brief upticks in violence in the latter half of the 20th century which then turn to further declines.  Pinker's major thesis is well supported in the view of this reader.  He's a numbers guy, and this reader respects numbers.  What kind of violence, you ask.  Every kind.  Murders, genocides, deaths caused by wars, beatings, violence against women, violence and neglect against children, violence against people because of their race or sexual preference, violence by children against children, even human violence against pets and other animals.<br /><br /> People refuse to believe Pinker's thesis.  In conversations over dinner with friends, I'll advance Pinker's main thesis and everyone at the table will ask me what I've been smoking.  They don't believe it.  It's nearly certain that my discussants are not going to read Pinker, thus challenging their own beliefs!  \\"Do you believe it?\\" they ask.  I say that I do.  My conversationalists continue in their disbelief.  \\"No one respects the behavioral and management sciences!\\" I complain, seeing myself as having at least some of the tickets for a claim that I'm an authority.  A friend, widely experienced in this world's affairs, an engineer, turned to my wife and said: \\"Paul's right about one thing.  No one respects the behavioral and management sciences.\\"  It seems to me views of this kind reveal an important shortfall in our K-12 and university educational programs, its graduates having failed to learn the characteristics of a science.  Science is science.  Engage seriously in reviewing scientific works offered for publication or proposed for funding and you'll learn well enough that good science in any discipline is difficult to achieve (see \\"Communication in science\\" [2013], \\"How science goes wrong\\" [2013], and \\"Trouble in the lab\\" [2013] ). You'll see that good science shares similar characteristics, all winning respect.  Science is science.  But the sciences are not all counted as equals among even the well educated.  Rolling back willful narrow mindedness is a Sisyphean task.<br /><br /> Having announced and supported his thesis, Pinker turns to the more difficult and very interesting task of explaining why violence has declined ... the major effort in this tome.  Since evolution works its changes over the course of millennia, evolutionary change in humans cannot be an important part of the explanation for the declines in violence over the last fifty centuries.  Pinker turns to changes wrought by social organization and the impact of ideas!  As the son of teachers, and having given my five decade career to doing behavioral and management science, seeking to share their meanings and benefits with those living their daily lives around me, I rejoice in Pinker's speculations.  We, the human species, do learn ... having learned to be less violent as we see in Pinker's pyramids of data.  Our behavior does not depend wholly on being guided robotically by our genes.  We do not have to wait for evolution to rescue us from traits that lead to pain, anguish, and injustice.  Individuals and societies can improve their practices.  Humans can learn not only to commit less violence against each other but learn the importance, gaining the rewards, of pursuing cooperative activities and building social norms.<br /><br /> Perhaps, hearing Pinker's thesis, one of the reasons folks resist accepting it is that violence today (of all kinds) is still too frequent in their view (as in mine).  They fear that accepting Pinker's thesis will cause societies to reduce their efforts to reduce violence.  Pinker himself warns readers against that thought.  If his explanations are accurate, his insights can guide us in further reducing violence.  Pinker's explanations are worth understanding and investigating further.<br /><br /> In my view, Pinker's burrowing pursuit of his topic reduces the effectiveness of his message.  He seeks neurological bases for explaining violent and self-indulgent behavior.  How can these explanations help?  Evolution takes a very long time to modify our brains.  Isn't education a faster and more hopeful way to think about additional changes in the direction of less violence, more peace, and more interpersonal and inter-society cooperation?  Pinker rehearses speculations from game theory and describes many, many \\"what if\\" games that professors cause their college students to play as participants in research, presenting us with a whole body of science based on (glorious? clever?)  \\"experiments\\" in social behavior and judgment.  From this reader's perspective, these sections of his 700 page text drag on and detract from the punch, clarity, and reasonableness of his explanations.  It may be that Pinker lacks clarity about the audience for whom he is writing.  Sometimes I think he's writing for the well-educated, responsible social and organizational leader.  Sometimes I think he's writing for undergraduates or graduate students in the behavioral and management sciences.  Just occasionally I think he's writing for colleagues across a broad swath of behavioral and management sciences who see themselves as building theory.  These audiences need their explanations at different levels of intensity and in different styles of presentation.<br /><br />Pinker deserves high praise for \\"looking over the wall\\" into sciences outside his own field of psychology.  Naming just one example, the work in political science that examines the circumstances and outcomes for wars and other forms of violence across a sample of hundreds of conflicts is exciting reading.

B00DR0PDNE|2.0|Works great, but only set up for netflix and YouTube... Need amazon streaming, watchESPN, redbox streaming, etc. to actually be useful.
B00E1SM5UA|5.0|I found that Al has created the perfect mood for each song. He has truly created a masterpiece for Beatles and non-Beatles fans!
B003U4UPTE|5.0|Great show. Intense and always keeps you guessing. Writing and acting are first rate. I look forward to every episode.
B00FEN000S|5.0|Amazingly done movie with lots of action and well done computer generated graphics.  The storyline is super interesting and keeps you in the action from start to finish.
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|Pretty good stuff.  I stayed interested through the whole season and I am looking forward to Season 4.  Bring it on!
B00FPH6PRK|5.0|This story is wickedly frightful and sucks you into the nightmare the family is living.  The actors did an awesome job and their fear is palpitable!  It was also neat to see the real Loraine Warren in a small cameo appearence!
B004L0NGEC|4.0|Helpful app for our recent vacation in Colorado. Learning curve very tolerable. I have not used it enough to know everything it can do but it is very helpful for uploading albums.
B00EP0KYDO|5.0|This movie has a grip on you from the opening frame.  Will smith is great as usual and his son is doing well cutting his teeth as an actor with big shoes to fill.  Images are breathtaking and the struggle of a young boy trying to live up to his fathers expectations is something many of us can relate to and so you find yourself  rootung for the boy
B00FAEPX9Y|5.0|Lorde is probably one of the most talented people i have come across. Signed at only age 12 after singing in a talent show, she has come a far way. At age 16 she now how one of the top songs in America and it was held that spot for a lon time already. All of the songs in her album are different from anything I've ever heard before. Her songs range from slow, to fast, to high, to low, giving it everything she's got. She sends great messages to teens everywere who listen to her music and the fact that she can be herself while being famous is hard to do. While some artists sing about sex and drugs because they think it will make them money, Lorde introduces meaningful lyrics that come from the heart. This is definitely an album to buy, you will never get sick of it because you are either turned on by the careful, thought-out words, or by her unique and talented young voice.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|There are no actually stated spoilers in this review, yet they can be inferred.<br /><br />I devoured the first two books in this series when they were released by Harper Collins 18 months ago. They are both wordy and overlong, but I loved them anyway. They were amateur, but that's okay. I enjoy plenty of \\"amateur\\" books. You know the ones, the ones where the author is untried, hasn't quite found her groove, isn't quite sure how to get her point across.<br /><br />One of the things I loved the most was that the typical formula in YA dystopian books was that the heroine is depressed in the third book and it's painful to get through. Why is that good? Because Insurgent was that book for the Divergent Trilogy. Tris was a wreck in that story. She made foolish decisions, put herself in danger, teased death at every turn. It was depression, hopelessness, recklessness. It was painful, but I was hopeful because if we saw that behaviour in book 2, then book 3 was something to be excited about. There would be growth.<br /><br />Then I was even more excited when I saw that this story was categorized as Teen Romance. So, not only would we see Tris' emotional growth, but there would be relationship growth for Tris and Tobias. After all, romances have \\"rules\\". They may be unwritten, but they are understood. And people who read romances are ticked if those rules aren't followed.<br /><br />I read the first 12 chapters of Allegiant before I pottered off to bed. I was enjoying it. Getting inside Four's head was a lovely surprise and it seemed that he and Tris were going to figure things out. Before I had a chance to come back to the book I started hearing about negative reviews for the book. One or two and I don't think much of them. But that number was rapidly rising as my morning continued forward. While at the grocery store I stopped before the wall of hardcovers and couldn't stop myself from nabbing one off the shelf. I thumbed to the epilogue, skimmed enough to tell me what wasgoing on, put the book back on the shelf, and then my emotions warred  between anger and hurt.<br /><br />Miss Roth broke one of the cardinal rules of romances. And she broke my trust. I don't care about realism. Life is emotional and sucks as it is. A story can be written where it's realistic in some areas, yet still allows us to hope in others. Quite frankly, life isn't worth it without there being hope. Can hope be argued in this story? Sure. Was the final scene poignant? Yes. I GET it. But that doesn't make it enjoyable. When I read a single book that drags my emotions through the mud, I want a payoff at the end. Something to make it all \\"worth it\\". Well, that goes triple when I'm dragged through a trilogy. As a reader, you're waiting for that moment. That payoff. Those words that leap off the page as if the author is saying, \\"See? You just had to trust me. I made you sad and hurt and ache before, but it's all worth it! See? See!\\"<br /><br />Yeah. This book? Not worth it and makes me feel as if I wasted my time rereading Divergent and Insurgent this last week. Wasted my time being excited for MONTHS for Allegiant to come out. Wasted my breath when I told my family and friends about this series. And I never want to feel as if I wasted my time on a book. Do I always like the final installment in a series? No. I can name several where I wasn't thrilled with how a series ended, but Allegiant trumps them all.<br /><br />If you want realism, look out the window and at the world around you. I returned my Kindle copy before getting past chapter 12 and I sure as heck don't want my daughters to read this. I'm deleting the other two books. I will not be watching the film when it's released in the spring. And I will not buy or read another book by this author.
B0027MJU00|5.0|This is a well written thriller that keeps you reading.  Not quite like Gone Girl it is much darker but has the same twisty quality.  I loved reading it and found it better than Gone Girl.
B00E8B1P9M|2.0|Action - yes. Good plot - kinda. Wished the old characters didn't have to die to bring life to these... the first was so good I wanted to see more of what happened to them. This was some good old fashioned kick butt fun but I think I spent more time on Pinterest than actually watching the movie.
B00C7TAF3Y|1.0|This game is one of the best games for the kindle fire hd. It puts all those other 'escape the room' type puzzlers to shame.
B00FPH6AXE|5.0|It's not an action movie although there is action. This is a human story about how it is human nature to try to control our feelings in order to keep moving forward. Part of growing up is learning how to handle adversity. This is a story of two extremes, the father who has controlled his feelings and been made a great figure in his society by doing so and his son who feels everything including judgement for being so emotive when all he wants is his father's acceptance and most of all love. This movie plays on the stereotype of what a man should be and how our society promotes the &#34;story&#34; that a man is weak for showing emotion. I thought it was a beautiful story and was touched by the journey each character made within themselves that ultimately helped them find each other.
B0034DGPEU|4.0|I thought the book was very good and held my interest the entire time.  The main character got a little annoying when she  progressively made bad decisions, but for the most part I found it  entertaining.
B00ESY7QXI|5.0|I loved the book, Robert Redford's version and this brings a whole new life to the film that my 12 year daughter even enjoyed! Great visually, awesome music, the story timeless and characters so alive that the emotional roller coaster is one you want to ride over and over again!
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I'm a very high strung person, that's just who I am. I tend to juggle a lot just so I won't have a moment of downtime. I sat down and started messing with the settings on this app. I selected rain, wind, and night on low volume and activated the light sleep frequency. Now my face is tingly and heavy, focusing on this review is staggeringly difficult, and I think I'll just take a nap. Yep.
B00CZ1TMUQ|2.0|I absolutely loved &#34;Together&#34;, and had high hopes for Perhaps Love. Right when I received the CD from the UK, I popped it into my computer and ripped it down to mp3. The first thing I noticed was that the songs are not all &#34;Jonathan & Charlotte&#34;. Rather, only seven songs are duets; the rest are split between individual solos.<br /><br />In the thank you note section, Jonathan thanks Charlotte, and wishes her success in whatever her future endeavors are. I took that to mean this will be their last album together; perhaps Jonathan finally listened to Simon when he asked if he thought Charlotte would hold him back. Too bad!<br /><br />Lastly, the song choices. These managers who get involved in groups and want them to &#34;mature&#34; or &#34;become relevant&#34; or whatever just drive me nuts. The reason I loved Together so much was that it was a new take on OPERA, not crappy adult contemporary songs! &#34;You've Got the Love&#34; is just horrible.<br /><br />I'm so sorry Jonathan and Charlotte, I won't be listening to this album very often. I will definitely listen to your future individual projects, provided they are true to &#34;Together&#34;, the style with which I fell in love. There is no question that Jonathan is star in opera, and that Charlotte can be wonderful as well, provided her song choices mesh well with her voice!<br /><br />I wish you both luck in the future!
B001EVNMTK|5.0|I was so happy to find this product.  I had searched the local retailers, even the one where we purchased the shaver, but was unable to find the product.  The price was reasonable and the delivery was quick.
B00BRUQ7ZY|3.0|Bishop Sponge' s Reclaiming the Bible dealt similarly with Bible/Jesus and was far more interesting.<br />I had expected more provocative material.<br />Those troubled by this book are only ones who are lock-jawed into religions demanding faith when faced<br />With science and facts.
B0070Y46UY|3.0|I don't think it is as good as people are making it out to be. Interesting concepts and the story itself is captivating but too slow. I read so that I can compare with movie. I hope the movie did the book justice.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|A great game...challenging but not frustrating.  Can' t wait for new levels. Loved the graphics.  Good to exercise the brain.
B00DJWV11I|5.0|I love that this story is written from the man's perspective! It was truly enjoyable and an easy read! More of this story to come.
0689835604|5.0|Bought this for a baby shower to build the baby's library.  Wonderful book and will get read often to the new little one.
0385528787|5.0|Margaret Atwood could well be the greatest living novelist. She continues to produce thought-provoking, funny, and well-crafted novels. Her social satire is subtle and on-target. This third book in her trilogy is strong. I was concerned that after two other novels with the same concepts and characters, I might be bored, but she continued to surprise and interest me. Anyone who appreciates top-notch fiction and hasn't read the series can have the great pleasure of starting with Oryx and Crake.
B00EY8BRGU|2.0|Honestly stopped watching 3/4 through the movie. Jumped all over the place.  Consider myself an intelligent person & couldn't understand it.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Always loved the show but now was able to catch up on missed episodes as well as watching commercial free.  Gotta love this show.
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|This book was well written with a pace that complemented the pace of the story.  Also, the protagonist was an interesting and intelligent observer of his surroundings whether it be people or situations.
B0094BB4TW|2.0|same as the other fb hopefully time will fix it will try again another day and hope its fixed, i love fb
B00D6DVSAE|5.0|I just love hearing this CD while driving in my car.  It is not loud and intrusive but melodious and provocative.  Each time I hear this CD, I gain another facet of his messages.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|great game lots of fun and so far works great, sure hope it keeps working well, can get addicted very easily
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I waited to play this game because every one told me it was so addictive. Well now I wish I hadn't downloaded it! Lots of fun and works your brain.
B00AFCEIB0|1.0|Cant you just search on the web for Google? It took up room and I don't use it. The End.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I absolutely loved this book!!!!!  Kept me hooked.  I finished it in a day.  I never heard of the author, but I was glad I previewed the book.
B004SOR4H6|1.0|And this doesn't work good on Kindle.<br />It messed my viewing up.<br />And signing in and just about everything.<br />I hope this was free because I uninstalled it..
B007SSDBBM|5.0|This was an adorable romantic comedy; free from all the sexual stuff.<br />I enjoyed this movie because the relationship was about falling in love with one's character, not their countenance.
B00280LYIC|5.0|it was amazing. I loved this book. the action is intense, and nothing too tragic happens. I love this book!!!!!!!!
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|You have to know the Shinning well to get all the references in this story. The two are closely tied together. But well worth the read.
B0011Z76RS|1.0|I bought this on the recommendation of a male friend.  It's not for me. I don't really care for that angry sound.
B00F91G5BS|5.0|A great movie that has all the elements for a good scary ride and it is just that, a Good Scary Ride.<br /><br /> It seems that most of these reviews are based on a television show I found boring and derivative; \\"Walking Dead\\".<br /><br /> I'm guessing that fans of that show also think vampires are like the ones in that \\"Dawn\\" series.<br /><br /> * Since I didn't read the book, I'm basing this review upon the movie itself. *<br /><br /> Apparently the movie's biggest letdown, was that it used the book's title. Dollars, per usual, made that dumb<br /><br />non-artistic decision. Personally I wish PR departments weren't so damned lazy that they just threw money at a<br /><br />problem and then sit back comfortably, after having made their overpaid decisions. But, it did put a lot of<br /><br />disappointed butts into theatre seats AND made a lot of stockholders very happy.<br /><br /> Plot holes: They ONLY needed one infected person. Wrong.<br /><br /> Firstly, zombies have taken over. As in, zombies are everywhere. A semi-working lab wasn't found until near the<br /><br />end of the movie and it wasn't functioning very well. Should a cure have been discovered at a local Kinkos that<br /><br />hadn't been overrun by zombies or maybe in a WalMart pharmacy department?<br /><br /> I've read about the physics of zombie stacking here and it's wrong. Was it shown correctly in the movie? No; the<br /><br />bottom tiers should have been crushed under the weight, BUT, that wouldn't stop a horde of mindless zombies, on<br /><br />full blown adrenal rush, from scaling a wall without any regard for their own individual well being, let alone the<br /><br />well being of another zombie. Of course this is all based upon my assuming, that they wouldn't even realize that<br /><br />their are any other entities, other than their own selfish, self-centered, selves.<br /><br /> You know, 'zombies be spoiled'.<br /><br /> Why? You may ask? Because (1 zombies are mindless entities that do not care about harming themselves; (2 Army ants<br /><br />can do it to bridge areas, to get to where they want to go; (3 Zombies do not have to move like Frankenstein's<br /><br />monster; (4 if zombies that don't just plod along some road in America, or are moving seemingly too fast, then<br /><br />maybe you were actually scared. And, rather than admit this, you decided that the movie was all wrong; that Brad<br /><br />Pitt leads too privileged a life; that he's married to Angelina Jolie... et. al.<br /><br /> \\"What was that noise?\\"not care about harming themselves; (2 Army ants<br /><br />can do it to bridge areas, to get to where they want to go; (3 Zombies do not have to move like Frankenstein's<br /><br />monster; (4 if zombies that don't just plod along some road in America, or are moving seemingly too fast, then<br /><br />maybe you were actually scared.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|This is one of the best trio of books I have read in a long time. So intense, so sexual and so loving by the end of it.  I will read this again sometime down the road..
0316322407|2.0|Malala has the greatest respect in Pakistan.<br /><br />Not because she is a:<br /><br />Pakistani historian.<br />Social scientist.<br />Expert on warfare or war history.<br />Religious Scholar.<br /><br />She is respected because she took stand against one most brutal/cruel force on the earth. Taliban.<br /><br />Now in the book a 15 year old girls is doing commentary on all I have mentioned above.<br /><br />Its more like poor malala got hit again, this time by Christina Lamb. A journalist who lingered around in troubled areas of pakistan(like balochistan) to find the story. And finally she got one.<br /><br />Still hats off to malala, I hope one day she writes a book her self.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|I never tire of watching the sparing that goes on between the two different personalities: one a closer the other a newbie.  My favorite character this season is Donna.  Her know-it-all demeanor fits well as secretary to Harvey, the ultimate know-it-all.  Louis on the other hand grates on  my nerves, but whoever plays that part is spot on.  What I do like is that you have to be quick to catch all the sharp dialogue going  on between the major characters.
B00D48BSBA|4.0|A rarity in books now days - difficult to put down. Good adventures in exotic places and so close to the truth.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is my sons favorite app. I love that he can can play with friends. This has quickly become his favorite game.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I enjoy this type of game. It keeps my mind active.<br />I wish I coulod get this app down loaded., but I can not find it after I bought it.
B003G8Y4QO|5.0|This is a great first season for Matt. It's hard to get used to him at first, especially for the people whose Doctor is Tennant, but the dynamic between The Doctor, Amy, and Rory is pretty great. Because the production style is so much closer to current times, if you aren't used to old school low-budget shows, this is a good season for anyone New-to-Who, though I highly recommend starting with the Eccleston series.
B000NVIXDW|5.0|I listen to this in my car every time I drive-it is so soothing to listen to while I am in nerve wracking traffic!
B0095VPBM2|4.0|I like this APU.  I ordered it as part of a HTPC build I started from scratch.  I am not overclocking or doing any gaming on it.  I am running Ubuntu 13.10 on this currently and it performs as expected, which is well.  It is not as quick as some of the higher priced APU's/CPU's as expected, but that's not why I got it.  It is not slow by any means either, is very responsive compared to other old hardware I have had, and have lying around.  The integrated graphics and price of the APU are the main reasons I purchased this.  The graphics work just as well as I need for simply streaming media from the internet and general playback of files on the computer.  I can not comment on much else as that's really all I use it for.  I think it is a solid CPU that will last a while and has a lot of good features for the price! I would recommend this item!<br /><br />For what it's worth, my computer build is as follows:<br />-Case - Rosewill Micro-ATX mini tower<br />-PSU - Corsair 430W CX430 R<br />-Motherboard - MSI socket FM2/AMD A75<br />-CPU - AMD A4-5300 APU<br />-Ram - this Kingston Hyper X Blu 4gb module<br />-HDD - Spare 100 GB HDD I had lying around.
B00AW57L96|4.0|I found it an easy read. The characters were real and the descriptions of places and events very good. I recommended it to friends.
B0060AY6FO|3.0|It wasn't amazing but it wasn't too horrible - made for a good rainy day read once you got past the history of the Darcys and the Bennetts.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It is so nice to not have to be on Facebook to play this game. I love to hate this one. Stuck for days but I keep coming back to try and beat it the next day. Works great with the touch screen to move the candies. Can't beat this free game.
006202406X|5.0|I loved Divergent. I loved Insurgent. Maybe it's just me (and it seems to be) but I love Allegiant even more.<br /><br />I get it wasn't the perfect, tied in a bow, happy ever after most people wanted, but this ending was SO fitting for the characters. I sobbed, I grieved, I hugged the book. My heart still aches for them, but it is what it is. The writing was as beautiful as ever, and I love Four just as much now as I did the moment Tris stepped off the net in Divergent.
B0064MGU98|5.0|This is a wonderful, well written and brilliantly acted! Every woman will understand this show and enjoy it!  Love it!!
B0035JNTA6|1.0|I couldn't even finish this movie.  I had heard that it is very funny, but I just could not get into it.  The characters are dumb, and the plot is ridiculous.  I realize that it is satire, but I really didn't care what happened to the characters at all.  I maybe chuckled once or twice, but then I found myself realizing that I had much better things to do than to watch this boring film.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Great for my 9 year old to play when on the go. She loves the card game but perfect to play in the car now.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|The little ones really enjoy this game.  It  is a very good game for the price.<br />I would recommend this.
B0083Z614S|4.0|I enjoyed reading this book and to see the different cultures come together. This book took me  a long time to read because it did not grab my attention right away. Seeing a little girl turn the life around of a little boy who thought he was very ill. Turns out he just needed a push from another child to see what he was missing.
B00FAPF5U0|1.0|The version on Amazon does not work properly with a Nexus 7 (animations are just shown in magenta boxes).  The play store version works fine.
B00B7ERH04|1.0|There are no instructions and I don't even know how to adjust anything. I don't use it at all since it is so unfriendly.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|I love this game and so happy it's finally available to play on my Kindle Fire HD, but why won't it let me connect to FB so I can receive lives from my friends? This is the only thing that upsets me, but it works great on my kindle
B0088P2A7A|5.0|I use it for all my research on just about any subject.  It's great.  I have even sent them money, which should say it all!
B005529EI2|5.0|If you are wondering if it is worth the price to buy the extended edition... Yes it is worth it. I am excited with my purchase of the extended edition as it keeps the movie fresh with the extra content and extended fight sequences.
B004J4WLB4|4.0|A well written story and great character development.  I have learned so much about flowers and their individual meanings which would be fun to incorporate in my life.
B004ZGI1V0|3.0|This is an average film. Like Taken this was not expected to be the best movie during filming but it achieves in areas. As a Liam film it falls between Taken and The Grey. I enjoyed it but it is not exactly something to brag about.
B004OZOTSQ|2.0|The maker of this app assumes most users are familiar with outdated network commands, which of course is not true (most today is plug and go),  His directions smack of sarcasm and are more confusing than anything else.  I have been unable to use this software although I paid for it.  Its not worth the trouble
B0054SMIH6|4.0|Love hate with Mr. McConaughey. He adopts the southern lawyer role easily and performs to the scripts standard. I believe he delivered what was asked of him in this thriller. Not the best movie of the year but you will be satisfied with watching.
B000JMKQX0|2.0|Sadly, the novel is wholly underwhelming in terms of narrative, but grossly melodramatic in its prose. How it became such a phenomenon is beyond me; perhaps, it was simply at the right place at the right time in the cultural zeitgeist.
B000OLRH10|5.0|Fabulous movie. Leo does a great job with the accent and goes through the perturbations of emotions throughout the film as he attempts to land a huge score. This is a must watch film!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I'm so glad that Candy Crush Saga is available for Kindle now. My whole family has had a blast playing this game.
B0068TJLSY|5.0|8mm film is a lost art re-explored with JJ Abrams and Spielberg. This movie is entertaining and lets you see the creature. Good build up, climax and execution of the conclusion. You will enjoy this movie.
B00F8L2VO4|5.0|I love the different activites in each lesson. easy enough for middle school students right up to older adults. I feel it will help me learn a language I always wanted to speak!
B00BD99JMW|2.0|i have waited for this book to come out for a long time and stayed up till midnight to download i was so excited. I feel somewhat betrayed by the author. Why she would have you go through all the stuff these characers go through just to end it like she did is beyond me.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|fast paced - great graphics and sound. easy for all ages 9 to 99, and the best part is was free!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game keeps me going. Just when you think your on a roll you get another challenge. I have it on my phone and was so excited when I found out I could get it on my Kindle. Who ever came up with this game is Good
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Could benefit from some hints. Otherwise a great game for all ages.Waiting for more levels to come out to play again.
0345803493|5.0|It was interesting to read and I highly recommend it to anybody who lives to read. And a gud buy
0385351399|1.0|I've read both AHWOSG and YSKOV. I especially enjoyed YSKOV which was a genuinely funny story. So with these expectations I was giddy with anticipation vis-a-vie The Circle. Ultimately I found it to be a great let down. I couldn't stand Mae at all. I guess maybe that was the point? She was so vacuous I just couldn't relate to her at all. And what was up with that bizarre fish tank and that demonic shark? And why do people keep comparing it to 1984? That's doing a complete injustice to the brilliance that was displayed by George Orwell.
B009SJ3H8Q|5.0|I love how disturbing and dark this show is. IT is addictive.You can't watch just one episodes because they suck you into the insanity.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This is my new obsession!  Watching Downton Abbey!  Historical, exciting and great characters!  What's not to like?  I can't wait until I get the next season!
B002UHSDUK|5.0|I like Foo Fighters, I like Dave Grohl, I listen to this album more then some I've had since the 90's.
B0050DZ8J0|2.0|It doesn't do anything for me.  I've never received anything relevant on LinkedIn.  The only thing anyone says is they are Linkedin, but that doesn't mean anything to me.
B002VPE1WK|2.0|Although its big, the space doesn't fit the camera. It will not keep the camera steady in the bag. Every time I took the camera outside, its location changed.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So excited to be able to play candy crush on my kindle. Like winning the lottery. My favorite game. Finally on my kindle.
B0058UXHHK|5.0|This book was a lot of fun.. I loved the main character and especially The dog- I found this book hard to put down.. I also enjoyed the list on the receipt.. Clever..
0451419243|5.0|I loved these first two books. Excellent historical facts in some cases.<br />The one thing I hated was the explicit sexual episodes...unnecessary.<br />I loved the English locals as I have visited England twice this year...<br />loved it, and it is nice to be able to picture the English scenes in my<br />mind.<br /><br />Hate that I had to wait so long between paperbacks.  Hope I live to see<br />the next one in Fall 2014 !!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So glad that amazon finally got this app. Love this game. Very addictive. Plays really well on the kindle fire. No glitches so far.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Fun way to pass the time. Enjoyed playing this game . The pictures are nice and hidden games fun and very colorful<br /> And creative also
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|i love this game it is very addicting and fun and finally its on the kindle so i dont have to get on the computer to play it. I love it but some levels take awhile to to win but it is great.
B00F91G5BS|2.0|WW Z has to be about the worst zombie movie EVER! Walking Dead its not. The movie has the typical zombie story line, unknown virus takes over the planet etc etc.. Branjolina naturally is the only person that can save the world and of course he works for the UN who cant save themselves from each other and he zooms around the planet looking for a solution to the zombie menace. And then the zombies are super zombies who can leap tall buildings with a single bound and do their thing at speeds that are eye blurring. There is virtually no story line and this film is nothing but a bunch of action scenes loosely tied together. Granted some of the scenes are interesting. But I am happy I didn't waste the money to see this in the theatre.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I started playing this game over a year ago. Luckily, it wasn't a huge sensation then. After playing the first few levels, I was hooked! It's a game that I can sit down and play whenever. Since it's finally available on Kindle Fire, I'll be spending a lot more time using it on here rather than my computer. I highly recommend this game! However, it's extremely addictive so play at your own risk.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is a fun great game that keeps you thinking. Not complicated but keeps you interested. I totally love it.
B001BZRUR4|5.0|I loved this book. I just put it down and I want to start at the beginning and read it again. Markus is a fabulous writer. This is the second book I've read of his..the other is The Book Thief. I'm anxious to see what else he has written. I can't imagine anyone not enjoying either story.
B009MB682W|5.0|I think this is a great collection at a great price.  Now I need to figurre out how to complete with the most recent and furure James Bobd films.
1567184855|4.0|This book gives a glimpse into the afterlife.  I believe it is as accurate as the human instrument can interpret.  For me this book was a gentle reminder that earth is not my home and my true essence is source energy.  I look forward to reading Destiny of Souls.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I never thought I'd like this series, I don't care for the Era, not do I prefer to watch things of the past, but I love it
B00FPH6AXE|1.0|Love Will Smith, but this was really a bore, tried watching twice but could not stay awake, acting was good, just poorly directed.
B007WEQ3K8|5.0|Thus app functions smoothly. There is a clean interface without clutter. The sub games load without unnecessary tapping and the keyboards appear as numbers when they should. Clearly this app was tested well and polished.
B00DJ80VLS|5.0|Album was a gift for my brother and he said it was awesome. The only issue he had was that the DVD wouldn't play. I am contacting Amazon to try and get a replacement DVD. He said the new music was awesome though.
B00594XOZU|1.0|Ok so kik use to work for a loooooong time and . Now all I get is &quot; it's taking to long . Try again in a lil bit-.- .  I have waited 3days how long do u want me to wait?!
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|Perhaps I should have thought about fidelity and noise when considering a device that uses only Wifi for communication, but perhaps I was simply optimistic. Regardless, the facts are these:<br /><br />I live in canada, which means that for the foreseeable future, I will be using the Chromecast exclusively with my Chrome browser, and no apps.<br />I primarily want to stream local media from my pc, not netflix (I would rather have 1080P Netflix from my xbox, than 720P Netflix from a device that I don't have a remote for).<br />Local media being played through my browser only works correctly with certain filetypes, but stutters and jumps. It's laggy.<br /><br />I've connected my pc through the lan, and that has alleviated much of the issue, but the playback framerate is still not perfect. I can deal with a little blocking or quality loss, but awkward stopping and starting of playback is unacceptable.<br /><br />Having said what I have said, I will be keeping the device, getting updates, and hoping support for canada and everyone improves.
B007WEQ3K8|4.0|Brain training is one of the best challenges for your mind. It staves off dementia. Use of the brain games puzzles are very entertaining and rewarding.
B0091REZMW|3.0|This game is really fun. My problem is loading take awhile... on my kindle... and on occasion it will just freeze up or just quit and go back to my home page.
1476734941|5.0|In my second week and I've lost 3.7kg without being hungry at all - so easy as it's only 2 meals twice a week to worry about, the rest of the weeks is normal eating, although I've cut down on my 'naughty' things a bit.
B002GYI9C4|5.0|This book is such a great first book in a trilogy.  You get to meet the characters and grow to love them.  I felt their joy, their frustrations and their triumphs, as if I knew them personally. I can't wait to read the following books to see where the storyline takes them and their struggles.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game its really fun and soo addicting! plus its FREE?! Heck yeah i love it! &lt;3.  Get it and try it trust me u wont be disappointed
0670024856|2.0|I so enjoyed the beginning of this book and Gilbert's raucous, intelligent beginning.  Once she starts to write about Alma, though, the depth gives way to a silly, almost juvenile tone.  I suspect Gilbert's strengths are in the non-fiction realm, in which she may describe factual discoveries without the strain of creating human characters, with full inner lives.  The characters here become caricatures, owning one defining characteristic and that's all.  They are not fully rounded people and become tiresome very quickly. I don't understand why Gilbert introduces new characters from chapter to chapter -- I suspect she painted herself into a corner with just Alma and her parents and was forced to keep inventing new characters to give herself somewhere to go.  This is very disappointing after the first 50 pages.  As usual, the New York Times book review was terrific hyperbole.
0345511468|3.0|Every review here is true, this is an outstanding view at the making of one of the best movie fantasies ever.<br />Ok, here are some negative points:<br /><br />- Jabba. Yes, where is he? There is very little about the making of Jabba. He is still one of the best animatronic creatures<br />ever done for a movie, so I expected much more about him.<br /><br />- There isnt much either about the other monsters.<br /><br />- The cover photo is... unimpressive. I would have preferred a much sharper photo.<br /><br />- The book is BIG and HEAVY, so it is not easy to hold and read.<br /><br />All in all, still the definitive look behind ROTJ. But I miss an in depth look at making of these amazing creatures.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|I like that it keeps me logged in. If I had to log in everytime, I might miss a bid!
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Excellent read.  It was hard to put down, so I rarely did!  It was worth losing some sleep to just get to the next chapter.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Classic Stephen King!  Great to find out more about the shining and what happened to Danny and Wendy.  A page turner from the very beginning.
B00DWZHTRW|5.0|To be right up front with it - I love magic, and I love a good caper. With a little misdirection, a little flair, and a lot of heart, 'Now You See Me' manages to be both.<br /><br />What I love most about magic is the capacity to delight. By giving in just a little to the possibility of something wonderful, a good magician can create something that enchants and mystifies, something we can talk about later and tell our friends, &#34;wasn't that amazing?&#34; I had the same feeling after leaving the theatre after seeing 'Now You See Me' - I wanted to share this experience with my friends, to tell them about what made it so special, to encourage them to see it for themselves.<br /><br />And the caper angle is right there too - four solo magicians, each with different talents, who come together to make an astonishing claim: in front of a packed Las Vegas audience, they're going to rob a bank. What follows is fun, exciting, mystifying, full of unexpected twists and turns, and packing a surprising emotional punch at the end. Carried by solid, believable performances from Jesse Eisenberg, Isla Fisher, Woody Harrelson, Mark Ruffalo, and the always-delightful Morgan Freeman, and shot in a dynamic style that made me feel like I was front row center for every trick, 'Now You See Me' carried me willingly along for the ride from beginning to end.<br /><br />The Blu-ray edition of the movie follows a trend I like to see, including both the original theatrical cut and an Extended cut (adding about 10 minutes of footage in) on the blu-ray disc, and also including a separate DVD of just the theatrical version - giving us different viewing options depending on the equipment available. The blu-ray movie looks and sounds great, and the extra 10 minutes of movie in the extended cut aren't essential, but flesh out a couple scenes nicely.  All in all, a great package.<br /><br />The only movie I can think to compare 'Now You See Me' to is one of my all-time favorites: 'Sneakers' - another caper movie with a killer ensemble cast, a great sense of humor, and an interesting story to tell. Remove the high-tech trappings of 'Sneakers' and replace it with the flourish of a little old-fashioned sleight-of-hand - keep the fun and the action and the surprises coming, and you'll come close to the experience of 'Now You See Me.'<br /><br />&#34;What is magic? Magic is deception, but deception designed to delight, to entertain, to inspire. It is about belief. Faith.&#34;<br /><br />'Now You See Me' is delightful, entertaining, inspiring, and even gives me a little glimmer of faith in the spell it casts.

B00AQ71FLK|2.0|The game play is right up there with DotA and LoL.  The developers seem to release new characters often enough but more often then not the new characters cost real money(over to five dollars each) and a skin for a character can cost 800 runes/gems/whatever which is more than the cost of any hero.  I've noticed a few balance issues like the sand walker who at level 3 can kill a level 12 dragon creep.  The in game store itself is buggy and if it times out during a transaction the game eats your money.  I had no luck with Game Loft and had to call Amazon to get a refund.  The game itself is great but the obvious money dump ploy and poor customer service for those willing to spend a few bucks bring my score down.<br /><br />Ps<br />I'm aware the company exists to make money but the prices are ridiculous.  Combine with poor service and there you go.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game fun to play its like tempal run but cooler because instead of a guy running there's a minion.Tempal run is where they got the idea to make his game minion rush.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This was a great story. Good ending for the hunger games. Mans goodwill wins out. Good wins over evil always.
B0040HO01Y|5.0|Excellent BBC series that I'm watching on my kindle. Highly recommend this series. Well done.<br />The characters are very endearing and the story line is based on a series of books.
B003M6EAXM|5.0|The most amazing show I have watched in my  life.  This show is a combination of many great shows and spices it up with some extraordinary people.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|I gave this book 5 stars because it has a different perspective on Slavery in the South. What would it be lime to lbe a white servant on a Southern Plantation?<br />I thought it was rather naive to believe that the plantation owner's son and heir would marry an indentured servant, but everything else was believable.
1442366621|2.0|I never saw that it was a cd, I wanted the book not a cd. Cost to return<br />it is to high.
B0029LCJJS|5.0|The sets, costumes, writing, and story are only outdone by the cast of actors themselves.  Absolutely Riveting!  Must Watch Television.
B0063M22QO|5.0|I'm been waiting to buy the right one, I have to say I finally found it.You will not waste your money on this one.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Fun game, very addictive, this type of game you can't put down. I highly recommend this game plus its free.
B008EEZ64Y|4.0|I had to read this book for my English assignment and I liked almost everything about this book, I just was a bit confused on the ending. It's a great book by  in my opinion the conclusion is very important an  that's the only part I did t like, otherwise it's an amazing book!
B00D2ZF3GQ|1.0|I really like sci movies and I really wanted to like this movie since W. Smith was in it but I was asleep during the movie and up just in time for the ending, that didn't happen to me since Cloud Atlas. lucky it was a rental.
B00F9A903O|3.0|Like the original green farm much better. Wish it were still available but I guess this will have to do.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|The 3rd installment of this series did not disappoint. It was shocking but stayed true to the greater message and integrity of the series. I think Veronica Roth made brave choices in this book which kept it from being predictable.
B000I3UMKM|5.0|I love this movie so much! Timeless classic. Holly Golightly is one of my favorite cinematic characters of all time.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|I got this item so that my wife could watch some of streaming videos of shows posted by the network web sites. The intent was to cast from the browser tab. It is very laggy when you try this though. It is fine with youtube because the content is not being served by your computer but rather from the origin server. Tab casting basically mirrors the tab and you need 1) a fast machine and 2) a fast WiFi connection. My wife's laptop is not that slow, an Intel i5 CPU but I need to connect it to the 100Gb ethernet and that helps a little. The Google docs do warn about these limitations but I hope this will improve at some point because it is pretty useless at the moment for browser tab casting.
B00BWBHIUG|3.0|I love this app, but now it will not load. Very far in the game. Do not want to reload it and start over!!!!!!
B00D7NWTSI|5.0|I didn't see it in the theaters (hardly ever &#34;go out&#34; anymore because of the noisy kids in most theaters these days) but my wife and I enjoyed watching it in 3D the day it was released in our home cinema.
B002I9Z8I0|5.0|Can't go wrong here.  Great quality DVD, tons of fun extras, and a great way to spend a weekend with fellow fans, or a way to make new ones. :D
B003G4W49C|5.0|I don't like that Amazon requires me to write 20 words when the title does it all.  This book WAS FANTASTIC.  I already bought the next two in the series and am looking forward to some quiet reading time for the coming holidays to dive into them.  Also can't wait for the movie.
B002HWRYJE|5.0|Nothing like the originals and yet it's still a good watch, mainly as the changes in events/personalities are explained via the whole timeline thing.  That's a plus when most remakes just demolish everything without explanation.
B00CTSDDVO|5.0|JJ's adaptation of the Star Trek Universe is just awesome.<br /><br />Most people that decry his two movies are just so married to the Roddenberry universe they can't let these movies stand on their own.
B007ME5BUG|5.0|If you really want to understand the global politics and strategies of this time period you should read this book. After reading this all the details of specific events or theaters of action during this conflict will have a better prospective. Even students of thsi time will gain insight from this book.
B009LDD1X0|4.0|Look forward to it every Thursday night, and when I travel, all six seasons (stored digitally) come with me everywhere I go.
0007466064|2.0|Read all 4 prior to this book. Some sections are extracts from them and the story doesn't move along. Enjoyed reading but was very repetitive. Was really waiting for this and I'm deeply disappointed.
B00EH0K9H8|3.0|I live in Australia and own an OPPO BDP-105 Blu-ray player.<br /><br />This release has a \\"region free\\" marker on it. It does play in my \\"region B\\" player.<br /><br />If this disc was restricted by the \\"region code\\", it would not play. A message would come up, advising of the restriction.<br /><br />The Stereo soundtrack plays fine. The DTS-HD MA 5.1 audio leans terribly to the right (it is not centred).<br /><br />The performance is good, and if this product was not faulty, I'd give 4 stars (I reserve 5 stars for my favorites).
B003R0MF1W|3.0|When I first started watching this, it was interesting -- & the Mentalist had a biting sense of humor as he pursued the villain . However, as the seasons progressed, the lead character (Mentalist) became so condescending and &#34;know-it all&#34; that I almost wanted HIM to be a victim!  In my opinion, the writers had a good idea but ended up with scripts made the Mentalist a unlikeable character.  I finally gave it up mid-way thru the last season of discs.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I was so excited when it finally came out on kindle!!! I finally joined the candy crush fanatics! Its great! I recommend this if you have some spare time on your hands!!!
B00F880BWG|5.0|This show is Awesome.Even if you are not a zombie fan, the plot is very interesting and the show keeps you on edge of your seat.Great special effects,and the best looking zombie makeup ever!! Thanks,Can't wait for Season 4 episode 3.
0316017930|4.0|\\"Outliers\\" is a fun read.  It discusses some interesting concepts -- many of which are common sense -- regarding how success is found at the intersection of opportunity and execution.  It's a bit like one of those motivational posters that you might see in the hallways of a decaying US company.  In any case, there's enough variety in the book to keep things engaging.  The chapters cover a diverse set of topics, ranging from Bill Gates, to Canadian youth hockey, to public education, and famously, Korean pilots.  You'll know quickly if this book isn't for you.  If the first chapter doesn't interest you, then put it down and move on.<br /><br />I'd definitely rate \\"Outliers\\" five stars for the quality and clarity of the writing.  Gladwell certainly has a knack for writing clean and thoughtful prose.  That said, it's all applied to chapters that are a bit inconsistent in their depth and relevance.  The analysis of ethnicity as a predictor of math skill feels somewhat thin.  And the \\"aha\\" moment of the nurse discovering that the slope of a vertical line is undefined is a head-scratcher, at best.  Finally, I read the book because I wanted to learn about Gladwell's conclusions regarding pilot safety and nationality.  The causal relationship makes sense, but the remedies were not explained very well, in my opinion.<br /><br />Given the success of \\"The Tipping Point\\" and \\"Blink\\", I think it's fair to hold the author to a high standard.  This book didn't quite live up to my high hopes.  But still it was interesting and thought-provoking, making it well worth the read.
B008OOYALE|5.0|Thud game is one of my favourite game's to play on my kindle fire . It is so fun raising the dragon's. So I would get the game if I were you.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game sounds like a kids game, but many adults are addicted to it, as it challenges the mind. . .  I play whenever I have the opportunity and when it frustrates, as it is apt to do, I put it down for a while. . .
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I was so excited that it's on Amazon finally. I have been playing it on my phone. With the Kindle HD it is so much bigger to see. Some of the levels are hard to complete in the moves they want you to do. I hate the fact I have to wait because my lives have been depleted.  I refuse to pay money for more moves. It is very addictive.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|One of my favorite games, I'm glad I was able to get it on my kindle and not just an iPhone.
B005HEK3JW|5.0|With a name like Star Trek you know they they are just trying to get as many stars as possible for their show. Oh, and the subliminal messaging of calling it Season 5. In other words, we are on a journey for 5 star reviews. Well there. I gave you your five star review. Are you happy now?
B00BD99JMW|2.0|I wanted to like this book, I really did... in fact, I liked most of it. Until the end. It was a completely unnecessary ending and I understand that maybe the author was trying to be different and not end the book in an obvious way... however, it ruined the book for me and the series as a whole. Not spoiling anything, just expect that at one point in the book you will want to throw your Kindle across the room and be mad at Veronica Roth.<br /><br />I'm so disappointed, I loved the first book, liked the second.. and I was enjoying this book until she ruined it for me. I even recommended the series to many of my friends, who were also big fans. But then for the author to just ruin it with the ending she did... unnecessary. I read Divergent 3 or 4 times, Insurgent twice... I'm not reading this book again. It could've been so much more, she could've focused on more important things... but instead she tried to be bold and just ended up writing a book I wish I could forget.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Another unbelievably touching story from Mr. King. Scary, gross, and heartbreaking, an awesome sequel to one of my favorite books of all time. Now... if he would just write a sequel for Pet Semetary.
B000W8HC8I|4.0|A fast paced and entertaining story. As incredible as it was, I believe every word. Not the best written book I've ever read, but the author's persona shines through and that makes it tough to put down. It's worth reading.
B0028R3NCU|5.0|This is the best solution I've found for carrying around a bootable USB drive. It's super-nice that I can also use it to transfer pics from my camera to devices lacking an SD slot.
B00FJTYDKK|5.0|Dreamworks has done it again with a wonderful film.  The Croods are entertaining from the start and it features the classic 'never give up' message.
B008EL25LE|5.0|I found this game hard to put down. Each level was achievable. Choice of power ups helped to create varied strategies to complete each level. Puzzles were fun to solve. The sad thing is that I completed the journey. I wanted more! Music was pleasant and increased tempo as time was running out. Winner!
B00DJZR46G|5.0|Producer T-Bone Burnett has produced a classic acoustic album that's quite reminiscent of Elton's early work. It is definitely Elton's best 21st century album, if not the best of his entire career. The string of strong and superb albums has begun with Songs From The West Coast (2001), followed by Peachtree Road (2004), The Captain And The Kid (2006) and the brilliant The Union (2010). The Diving Board is Elton at his best - musically and vocally, with a strong set of songs, diverse in musical styles (rock, blues, gospel, jazz, country and even waltz) and lyrical themes. Thumbs up for this truly masterpiece!
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I've been waiting for Kindle to get Candy Crush Saga. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because the game is entirely too addictive.
B004I744AS|5.0|This by far is the best dictionary I have ever used. It has so much information and it is fun to read. This is my go to  place when playing Word with Friends
031237593X|3.0|I was so excited to see a huge book getting good reviews that told King Richard III's story.  Very disappointed that it wasn't all about Richard.  In fact, I think Richard was the most undeveloped character in the book.  I neither loved or hated him in the book.  I'm a huge Richard III fan from other novels that believe him to have been a great person. If I hadn't already read other books about Richard, then I don't think I would have had any feelings about him other than Penman felt he was wronged.  Out of 900+ pages, only the last 300 pages start to give Richard some major \\"attention\\" in the story.  I think it was a good book about  all of Richard's family, the Nevilles, Warwick, the Woodvilles, and the War of the Roses, but I don't see how everyone is calling this a book about Richard III. Just because Richard III was the last of the three brothers to wear the crown, and she ends the book pretty much there, does not make this a book about Richard III.  I feel he was a small character in this gigantic book.  Penman did a good job of telling history.  I love her belief that Richard III was indeed a good man, but I don't think she allows the reader to fall in love with him. Penman does a good job of writing about a lot of characters, and does a good job of bringing that time period to life, but life without a lot of emotion.  It was a good \\"narrative\\".  I suppose I would have been more gracious with the stars had this book been marketed as a book about the War of the Roses.
B00395ZYVS|4.0|Gowda's novel is a wonderful saga of people who are building a family through adoption. Our book club will enjoy a heartfelt discussion of Gowda's clearly created characters and their love of family and culture.
B00FPH3YQA|3.0|Movie was not about Hangover until the end. It lost the feel of original movie. It was all about the guy with the beard.
B00DYFCYSO|5.0|I fell in love with this CD the first time I heard it . I listen to it everyday while at work , several times ! I bought this CD because I heard & really loved &#34;All of Me '' , which I think is a great wedding song . But , all the other songs are equally as good .  I am looking into buying others from this artist .
B00594XOZU|1.0|Ok. So I'm really mad with Kik. I need it fixed!  Haha I wish it would work, because right now, it's been doing the same thing that everyone else has problems with. But now it shows up in the app store as currently unavailable. It would be great to have my kik back because my old friends and I only talk on kik, please fix soon.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|Wasn't crazy about this CD when I first bought it , but after really listening to it  , I loved it . What a powerful voice & very heartfelt lyrics ! Highly recommend !
B005XUC398|2.0|I was actually shocked at how this stellar cast was even compelled to do this movie.  The movie lacked anything to make it interesting - thrill, action, plot that makes sense...  anything.
1423124960|5.0|Its go great pics and I am so happy with it. Thanks Hippo Books and AMAZON. we are thrilled with the book.
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|Found this show through reviews of Justified. I loved everything about Walton Goggins' character and acting in Justified so I started watching the Shield to see if his other work is as strong. It's grittier than most other shows I like but I'm hooked and now in the middle of Season 3. Michael Chiklis' character gets a lot more likable as his character develops and I also really enjoy the acting by other characters (notably CCH Pounder, Jay Karnes, & Catherine Dent). Not appropriate for kids (frankly I don't think it's great even for older teens) due to the subject matter, but obviously the show is marketed to adults so I give it 5 stars.
B00F8L2VO4|5.0|This is a truly great product!  It is very easy to follow and would be excellent for any child or adult!
B0013ND36G|5.0|Arnold is back as the terminator. This is good cause the special effects, adds to the classic terminator movies. I'll be back
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love the game and am so happy I can get it on my kindle fire. Its a lot if fun.
B001TH16DI|5.0|I got really lucky and this went on sale.  I only paid $30 for this whole series.  Even at full price it's worth the  money if your a Star Trek fan.  The movies look and sound great! I'm glad it's the original theatrical release.  I hate when they make extended cuts for re-releases.  This gives me the same movie experience I had when I first watched them.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This is a great game! It is very addictive. Can be frustrating to clear levels sometimes! But lots of great fun.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|Well I never realized having followed the narrative of Tris that this was a series about Tobias. The final book is well paced and I enjoyed the character development. I am disappointed in the ending but I suppose that it is a way to show transformation through gut wrenching grief. I would not like to continue on any storylines in this world past this book.
B00F91SCXC|5.0|My wife usually falls asleep when we watch a movie, but she was on the edge of her seat for this movie.
B002KJX4IE|5.0|Always great, first time kids watched it, language is a bit bad for my 7  & 10 yr old kids.  They had no problem with it being scary.
B00DHHWYAW|5.0|nice as present.<br />to see it in 3d is an amazing experience.<br />recomanded for all ages.<br />Leonardo Di Caprio is a great actor.
B00AHSMDQY|3.0|Ok the Batman series is great...but I am not sure I guess since they are not using Christian Bale anymore they were making the Batman role a bit weak....but it was ok...the first one in this series was the best in my opinion
B00AB0Z88S|5.0|A second avatar, an extraordinary story good.<br />No a days in scholls there is no learning about real life.<br />Story as Avatar and Life of PI can pass better to young people.
B00EEDJM2Q|4.0|The graphics in this game are adorable. What I thought was a cute little time killer really does stump you in the higher levels.
B007SVPZMW|1.0|The animation is cute at first, but as you wait for it on each and every turn, it becomes cumbersome.  No way to &#34;click through&#34; it.<br /><br />If you are going to play vs. computer, this game's &#34;hard&#34; logic is easy to beat.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|WOW!! This book is amazing. So good that you hate for it to end, even though it has taken over your life for a week. Well, back to less entertaining books...
B007HUD6OS|3.0|Good, but best for a younger reader.  It was pretty easy to anticipate most of what was going to happen.
B005MLOOJA|5.0|This show is great.  It's fast-paced, has intriguing story lines and interesting characters.  Like Season 1, the season builds throughout.Looking forward to seasons 3-5.
B00BRUQ3PS|4.0|I think the beginning of this is a bit slow, but overall, this was an enjoyable, interesting conclusion to the MaddAddam Trilogy.
B00EHMG358|5.0|This one is going to be one hell of a ride I cant wait, Agent Pendergast is one of the coolest characters in a series of books ever.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|These people outdo each other on a minute by minute basis. Very quick repartee, smart and soooo entertaining. Love this show!
B0042KZJR8|5.0|Michael Buble is an energetic performer who reminds me of Frank Sinatra, Harry Connick and Mel Torme.  If not the best, this CD is in my opinion among his very best. Michael is an energetic performer with fantastic singing and performing skills!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I've been playing this game for a while. I'm on level 303. It progressively gets harder. But some levels are impossible to complete without buying cheats. I'm glad I can finally play it on my Kindle. When are the other King saga games going to be available, I.e. Pet Rescue and Bubble Witch?
B005WUHAX8|3.0|I guess I should be happy that it's not the phone that broke.  However, the bottom right corner has already broken off.  This phone is well taken care of and is not subject to rough wear and tear.  Was told by others with the same case that it is a defect and can be replaced at no charge.  However, who wants to go through all that?  I just need something that holds up and protects my device.
B009JZSC9S|5.0|Best show yet!  I totally love Will and Alicia.  The connection between them is awesome!  Can't wait to continue to season 5!
B002361MLA|5.0|I have a scientific bent of mind and for me Eckhart's introduction to being in the present resonated quite well with me. This book also made me become aware of the lost mystical and spiritual nature of a few main stream religions.
0307386171|4.0|It’s pre-Sexual Revolution England, the early 1960s, and Florence and Edward are in a hotel room in southern England about to consummate their marriage. He seems keen, she not so much. The author uses a series of flashbacks to show what came before this fateful night, and he does so with sparse, crisp prose and by realistically setting his fiction against the climate and history of the times. It’s hard, really, to say any more about the novel without including a spoiler, so I’ll just say that I enjoyed and recommend it. This was my first Ian McEwan novel. I picked it up without knowing anything about it except that it was one of his more recent efforts. I will try to read more of McEwan’s work in the future. He’s a very good writer and yarn spinner.<br /><br />Troy Parfitt is the author of Why China Will Never Rule the World
B001XV3LSS|4.0|Of course not as good as the book but still worth a watch.  I still miss Carl Sagan.<br />Take the time to view more than once, to catch the background details.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It is A lot of fun. Keep in touch with friends.Good competition. Drawback......It is addictive..I willrecommend to other family and friends.
B008JFUO0Y|5.0|I was in no way expecting this movie to nearly as good as it was and it far surpassed everything i assumed it would be!!!!! It blows your mind with insane horror and suspense. Still keeping the humor involved with out it destroying the movie. An epic event with in its own, standing apart from the original. Loved it. already watched it 4 times. When your done watching it you feel like you should be running around with your head on fire its so damn good. MUST SEE!
B00F8GYC1Y|4.0|this is a very fun game to play. The only thing I don't like is that you run out of missions to get power ups. Other than that it's a great game!
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|Even though I just got this app, I can tell that this is the best dictionary ever, and I am serious my happy that I got this app!
B001EC2ISA|5.0|I loved Beetlejuice as a kid in both the movie and cartoon form. Rewatching it as an adult it's still just as fun and now even better as I comprehend a few jokes that were over my head then. Burton's early work shows what an innovator he was for the time period and his set pieces are absolutely stunning. Add to that Catherine O'Hara's hysterically shrieking performance and and wonderfully angsty teen Winona and you just can't lose.
B00BEIYMAG|2.0|America is raising a generation of idiots. No, the so-called true story is nothing like the movie and the so-called true story is questionable at best, and an out and out lie at worst. The few accounts of this so-called haunting has no credible witnesses who weren't looking for 15 minutes of fame. COME ON AMERICA, ARE WE REALLY THIS STUPID TO BELIEVE THIS MOVIE COULD POSSIBLY BE TRUE?! If you want to see real evil, read the news, because that is scarier than anything in this film.<br /><br />The actors are brilliantly wasted in this film. This movie has the same formula used in the 1960's Vincent Price film, except the actors are better and the settings cost more money. Nothing new here people. May I quote Albert Einstein: \\"Only two things are infinite, the universe and human stupidity, and I'm not sure about the former.\\"<br /><br />P.S. Whenever Hollywood uses the words \\"based on\\" it means 1% what they were told and 99% creative license. Just look up what \\"Captain Phillips\\" shipmates had to say about that movie versus the reality of the real incident and the Captain himself. You're killing me people -- just killing me. Is there no hope for us?!
B009LK6JS2|5.0|Very addictive! Realistic, no ads, no bugs, Great way to pass some time.  Would like to see even more types of planes.
B00FFHG6KQ|5.0|I really enjoyed this game because of its realistic features. When you play you get the feeling this is the actual Xbox game
B001TH16DI|5.0|I had these movies on DVD and hadn't planned on replacing them with the Blu-Ray versions. Saw this set on sale and couldn't pass it up. Glad I jumped on it and was able to add all the Star Trek movies to my collection at such a low price.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I've been waiting for the Android edition and worth the wait. Addictive. Challenging. Fun! Like sharing extra lives with FB friends.
B00COGXGNQ|3.0|It didn't follow the book as closely as I would have liked, but I enjoyed it. I would recommend it.
B003G4W49C|5.0|A riveting story with compelling, finely drawn characters set against an epic backdrop. Impossible to put down, whether being read for the first time, or the fifth.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|Fast paced book that let's us know Jack Reacher from the beginning.  I really don't see how Tom Cruise played this part... he was the wrong guy totally!
B0088W7VNG|5.0|Stargate Atlantis was entertaining, keeps you guessing as to what is going to happen. The writing is excellent.  I wish there was another season or two.
B0089LOG02|5.0|I really don't know what I was expecting, but the book surprised me.  It was historical fiction which I didn't realize when I got the book. The pace was not fast, but steady and it held my interest.  Good story.
B0036S4B6M|3.0|What its like to be in jail, Piper gives her eyeopening view of life there.  I don't want to go there.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I never though I would be into a zombie movie.. just not the paranormal type. But this show is good.  It is very character driven, so we really get into the lives of the cast.  I am pushing 60, and a librarian, so don't think you are too old to enjoy.  Watch it from the beginning to understand all the characters.
630471193X|5.0|What can I say about this movie.  It touches your heart and all of your emotions I was overwhelmed with so many emotions of joy sadness, happiness, sorrow, and laughter.  Great movie
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I enjoyed the book and wanted to pick it up for more. Interesting dilemma and outcome.  I like the way the book comes back around to the beginning and the way it affects everyone's lives.  Things are not always what they appear.
B0026P40NU|3.0|Nothing wrong at all with the acting, direction or technical aspects but I found myself a little disappointed that the characters in the story seemed so superficial and self-involved.  Lacking in warm, truly human moments.  The supposedly humorous bits didn't really amuse me much.  It gave me little reason to cultivate an interest in the work or lives of the artists being portrayed.  On the other hand, the extras and bonus footage was sometimes more interesting than the program itself.
0545626382|5.0|Love the books, was so glad I read before watching the first movie.  Excellent series of books and author to read.
B00005JLPK|5.0|Interesting portrayal.  Less on her political and social role in society than on her personal journey, which fed her politics and activities.  Powerful, meaningful life.
B009WJ14FA|4.0|Nice to find a band that plays rock n roll. Good beat and you can dance to it! A plus!
B008LXZFH6|1.0|Steve Carell's character was the only redeeming thing in this movie. I love Will Ferrell, but this was a swing and a miss.
B004KBSQBA|5.0|I have always loved this music and somewhere in life I  lost my CD.  It had to be replaced.  Everyone should listen to this music.
0385350864|4.0|Spoiler Alert:  I know alot of people wanted the book to begin where the last left off, but it fast forwards to Bridget at 51.  I had to put away all the preconcieved notions I had going into the book.  I really enjoyed it.  At times it was sad and dark, but other times I laughed aloud.  I had pre-ordered the book; and before I read it, I checked the reviews.  I started to worry, but please give this book a try.  Go into it with an open mind.  Bridget is still the same, crazy, scatter-brained woman from the other books, just dealing with the loss of Mark. I don't agree with the others saying the writing was bad.  It WAS written in diary style, but easy to follow.  I recommend the book!
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|I love this game, it is very mysteriously fun.....I like any kind of hidden object, this one is wonderfully amazing.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|A very addictive game. I am so happy it finally came out for kindle fire. Now I can play even more.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|Arrived on time. It was everything the seller said and at  great price. I gave it as a gift and my husband was very excited about it!
B009KWU6Q2|5.0|Watched it with my gramdson. Really fun! We will defintely watch this movie again.  The movie is age appropriate for kids.
B004JN1D2I|4.0|I couldn't stop reading. It has lot's of twists and turns. Many plots and sub plots. It just keeps going on and on
B00E00GCF8|5.0|I'll be honest, I always liked Countdown to Extinction but it was never my favorite Megadeth album.  That honor would have to be a toss up between either Rust in Peace or Peace Sells...But Who's Buying?  both of which are Megadeth's speed metal masterpieces.  Although I'm more impressed by the jaw dropping musicianship of the band on those two albums, Countdown really is one of Megadeth's best and more than deserves its own special pillar in the Megadeth catalogue.<br /><br />Now to put it in perspective, Countdown to Extinction most definitely followed the trend set by Metallica in the early 90s, which was to streamline their sound, lessening the blistering thrash metal assault and aiming for a wider mass appeal by slowing down tempos and adding more melody, songwriting, and grooves to the music.  Now that being said and also admitting that Countdown was a huge change from Rust in Peace, it still sounds like Megadeth.  Even though the technical wizardry is less on CTE, it sounds like a proper evolution of the bands sound.  The tempos may be slowed but the snarling cynicism of Mustaine and post apocalyptic sound crafted by the band still come across well and in some respects even better than previous Megadeth albums because the songwriting is so much more mature on this album.  In other words what I'm saying is that Megadeth may have turned down the intensity with Countdown but they certainly didn't soften their sound.  There's really no \\"pop\\" songs on this album.  Sweating Bullets and Symphony of Destruction may have great, catchy hooks, but the lyrical content and tone of the music is anything but poppy.<br /><br />It was that evolution of Megadeth on Countdown that really earned my respect.  Although it was much different than Rust in Peace, the songs were still fantastic and it sounded like a genuine evolution of the band rather than a cheap attempt to sell out.  A true sign of growth and maturity from an often underapreciated band(due to their controversial frontman) that really showed what Megadeth was capable of as musicians.  That kind of seriousness, talent, and professionalism seem all but gone in today's music scene.<br /><br />So intro aside, how's the DVD?  Great!  5/5!  Sound quality is excellent, set list is terrific and the band are all on top of their game.  It sounds like they play the whole show in E flat or maybe even D (musicians help me out here) probably to compensate for Mustaine's aging voice, but it sounds vicious!  Great to hear underrated songs like Architecture of Aggression, This Was My Life, Psychotron, and Captive Honour played live.  The video set up that goes with each song fits the music perfectly and the band knocks each song out of the park.  A must have for any Megadeth fan!  Now if only they would play Peace Sells in it's entirety...but THAT is another matter!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I was skeptical about buying this game..I saw the reviews getting higher and higher..then I got it and I am amazed..the graphics storyline is excellent..very mind boggling..worth it..Yes recommended the best game I played
B00FEHXCIG|2.0|What had a been a smash and grab all out assault of awesomeness with Ironman 1 and 2 now has the brash and very sure Tony Stark twisted into a pathetic weak mental case...the director of this movie is now in a place in my mind I held for those most deserving of contempt...like the guy who ruined Indiana Jones with aliens...you know of whom I speak. And one last comment (warning on spoiler ahead !)...was the fire breathing bit really necessary ? Ironman 3 ?...you'd be better off watching the last Indiana Jones movie.
006202406X|3.0|I  think that it wasn't fault in the book it was the fault in thinking of veronica roth while writing allegiant and as u know she always used to say that she thinks she is selfless and all when in uk cover I guessed about she must make her final choice to save people and one choice will define that she is more n more selfless then divergent veronica s life must be changed after the college writing divergent a book that can chills ors spine literally to this one ad all and veronica roth's one loving thought about jk Rowling I hate she says that if jk killed Harry potter in the book it would be a great act of sacrifice and she will respect more harry potter than she does now I deny her belief b/c actually avid readers may have noticed in HP main character protagonist selfless unlucky true lover hardworker jerk was snape who saved Harry by gettin himself killed when Harry should be and that means jk already had killed main protgnasit without even letting her fans angered and also made a sacrifice of godfather Sirius mentor lupin n dumbledore lupins spouse tonks George bro Fred and a darkest but epic end ! Which was or wasn't here still this is cool and veronica see my advice and don't kill people who haven't lived their lives !
B001EC2IT4|5.0|I watched this when I was younger and still watch it now that I am older. Still one of my favorites from the old days!
B006PIXKVW|4.0|Great movie to watch as a family.  A little scary in a few parts, but my 6 year old daughter loved the movie.
B0033AI48Y|5.0|Roberto Benigni knows how to capture a person's heart. This poignant story will lift your spirits and remind you that even amidst great suffering and tragedy there lies a capacity to hold onto hope and light-heartedness.<br /><br />A lot of stories about WWII are overwhelming sad due to the content and the nature of the historical event. But this movie allows a person to understand the tragedy while also seeing just how beautiful and precious life is and how we should keep it that way for our children as long as possible.<br /><br />I prefer to watch this movie in the Italian, but the English Dub uses the original actors voices in most situations, so it's watchable for sure in English too.
B00EF1PKJQ|5.0|The sounds on Sarah's third album are even more well-honed than the second. She keeps learning and growing as an artist. I can't wait to find out what's next, but at least I will have some great music to listen to while I wait.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is a lot of fun and challengeing as well.  I am glad to have it on my Kindle I have been playing it on my phone since June on this is great. Once you start playing you can't put it down.
B0089LOG02|4.0|Orphan Train was thoroughly enjoyable as well as very informative about a pivotal time in American history.  The parallels of the elderly Irish woman who had lost her family to a fire in early New York and the young teen from the present day who had been abandoned by her family was very effect in delivering the plot.  If you enjoy reading about the lives of early immigrants or about the lives of discarded children, like stories about the Bernardo Boys, you will enjoy this.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|My grandson loves this game.He finds it to be a challenge and fun.  He loves it. He likes the bonus ponits you can earn.
B00D7Z4GQY|2.0|Too many  what-if's. The story was convoluted. Interesting in clumps but hard to follow so many threads, never mind that then we learn that the supposed murderer wasn't', that only a few would know what he did in the first place, that the girl he supposedly murdered would have died from other causes and....d'you see what I mean? What-if doesn't count, not unless it actually changes the character's life and story for real. This was interesting but far from satisfying. And the typos.....oh my!
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|This game works flawlessly on my samsung. It stops in the middle of levels and shuts off constantly on my kindle. When I'm home I'm always on WiFi on my phone so I don't think it can be the connection
B00FWLDHSY|5.0|I really enjoyed watching this movie! It was intense! I found myself holding my breath! I would watch it again and again.
B000Q9ISSQ|5.0|It kept me laughing ...I had to keep reading funny and interesting parts to my husband. Too good not to share.
B00ARHAAZ6|5.0|absolutely awesome read!! i couldn't put the book down!! The story is intense. Not predictable. I loved it. Would read it again and again
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Challenging but not too hard! Really enjoyed all of the levels but would like more levels please! :) Great game!
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|Love walking dead....but hate paying for it. only thing that would make it better is having it available on hulu plus.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I have been waiting for this to be available on the Kindle! I love this game! Very addicting!  AWESOME! Thanks Kindle!!!!!
B000JMKQX0|3.0|I enjoyed this book, but it's not exactly a classic.  Then again, it doesn't have to be.  The main problem I had with it was that every single story is told in the same voice.  Many of the stories are interesting, but it doesn't matter if the person being &#34;interviewed&#34; is supposed to be an 80-year-old Kenyan woman or a 20-year old American soldier, they all sound exactly the same.  The only minor variation (and it is very minor indeed) is the Brit castle scholar. Everyone other character speaks with the exact same syntax and sentence structure.<br /><br />If you're buying this expecting some sort of action-packed adventure novel, you'll surely be disappointed.  That's not what it is at all.  However, if you accept it on it's own terms, and read it knowing that it's not particularly original or exciting, then you'll probably enjoy it.
B00BFBSV72|5.0|I love playing Sonic games as I am a sonic fan I really love this Sonic Jump game my favorite<br />Best jump game ever super-well worth the money you'll agree and would love this game too if you're a Sonic fan.<br />I'd recommend this game to all who love Sonic games they'll enjoy and hopefully just as much as I enjoyed it.<br />Five Stars.
B00A285OOW|4.0|I like the ribald and rowdy history of England, and Gregory always offers a bit of the salacious, an intimate view of the underside of reigning powers.<br /><br />Her story held my interest and made me feel compassion for a queen who learned the hard way that being #1 isn't ever all it promises.<br /><br />As Elizabeth fights to keep Henry VII's mother from exercising too much control over the embattled king, she falls in love, only to be rejected for another woman, the \\"pretender's\\" wife.  The woman is Elizabeth's sister-in-law, but she can't name her such, and as the white princess watches her brother, the \\"pretender\\" come so close to taking Henry's reign, we see Elizabeth's divided loyalties between York and Tudor bring her unending grief. It seems for a young woman raised at the throne's edge, Elizabeth never takes her seat with ease.  Gregory shows us how awful Elizabeth's emotional life must have been despite the immense wealth and privilege.<br /><br />The tie in of the curse from _The White Queen_ adds a supernatural flair, and I enjoyed following the through-line.<br /><br />Not as great as _The Boleyn Girl_, but _The White Princess_ is quite good.
0439023491|5.0|Excellent writing, interesting story, an expansion of the first book with detailed character development. Once you begin with this book you will not be able to put it down till you have finished it. I lost a lot of sleep staying up at night reading this book.
B00DXPC1U6|2.0|In all honesty most of Season 8 isn't as bad as many fans say (except for the final episode, which we'll come back to.) However even taking the most optimistic of viewpoints it's a very poor fit for a final season. Simply put the feel of the final season should have been along the lines of Season 2, that feeling of the world closing in on Dexter and that he was going to get caught. Unfortunately since that material had already been mined fans were instead left with a somewhat generic serial killer hunt and family dysfunction storyline that just felt like a retread of earlier seasons.<br /><br />(MINOR SPOILERS FOLLOW)<br /><br />There's some interesting things going on with the introduction of Dr. Vogel as a surrogate mother figure. This also gives some very interesting ideas as to whether or not Dexter is unique or if his code can in fact be tought. Dexter has let various people in on his homocidal side but has never truly taken on an apprentice or tried to instill Harry's Code on another. It's an interesting notion, though sadly it's also cut short before it really gets good.<br /><br />What's going on with Deb throughout the season feels largely obligatory. Obviously she couldn't just be ok with how things ended the previous season, but except for one or two key moments there's nothing very unexpected about her downward spiral. Largely the season as a whole feels obligatory and not climactic.<br /><br />(SPOILERS END)<br /><br />It would have been just an OK finish if not for the final episode. The choices made and the way they are presented are simply mind boggling. Very little of what happens is satisfying and it's presented in a way completely devoid of the tension that Dexter has always been about as a show. It feels like it was made by completely different people who'd never seen an episode of Dexter before. If it weren't for this final episode most would shrug this off, but the actual finale is wrong on so many levels it taints not only this season but the show as a whole.show as a whole.
0439023521|5.0|Let it be said the movie does not do this book justice, if you have watched the first installment you will quickly notice how important it is to read the book before or after.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I absolutely love Stephen King & could not be more thrilled with his ending to the Torrance Family Saga!!!  Great Read, especially on a kindle
0439023513|5.0|The final piece of the Hunger Games comes to an end. While others may complain about the ending, you have to remember that Katniss and Peeta are two individuals people in a world we cannot even begin to fathom. With this known, it's the best ending possible, for two, who have been through so much.
006202406X|1.0|I was late to the game when I first read Divergent and I was quite taken with the book, the second book still had my attention but it was waning, but I didn't give up and I was anxious about the third book. I downloaded the book (Thank God I only paid $6.99 because its not worth even a penny more) and was so excited that I was half-way through before I went to bed. I found the book slow, although I did like hearing from Tobias, however I found this book to be lacking in so many areas and so many parts were unncessary. Then when the ending came, I thought it was all just a dream, for Ms. Roth to write what she did was appalling and left this reader sad, heartbroken and very disappointing. If you are a fan of this series stop reading after Insurgent, if you don't want to subject yourself to the heartbreak that is this book.
B001XVD2Z0|5.0|I haven't watched The Matrix in a long time. I ordered this movie for an assignment I'm doing for class, but the very first shot reminded me of how much I love this movie! It's so well crafted and paced. It hasn't really aged much either, a few giveaways such as the cell phones date the film, but it all works so well in the context of the world. Such a good movie!
B0064MGU98|5.0|My wife and I have been eagerly viewing and enjoying this series; it's hard to watch just one episode. The writing is fantastic, as are the acting and casting. The outcome of each gripping episode is unpredictable but totally makes sense. This is television at its best.
0525953728|5.0|Book was purchased for my husband he liked it . if you are into war you will probably like it too
B00A757EFW|4.0|Back to the 80's. All that's lacking is a joystick. Seems that nothing was changed from the original game in an Atari console.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|Enjoyed this  pageturner but glad when it was over as the characters were getting a little one dimensional an  unreal.

B002361MLA|5.0|I am feeling like not reading anymore books after reading this one. Do not take it negatively. Everything required for living our life beautifully is in this book.

B009HXG9UQ|5.0|This film is sheer genius.  I can't think of one bad, or even mediocre, aspect of the movie.  The story is highly original, beautifully scripted, magnificently acted, brilliantly directed, and visually stunning.  If there were any award more prestigious than the Oscar, I would give it to Moonrise Kingdom in all categories.  After watching it tens of times on cable, I had to buy it so that I would always have it with me.  They just don't come any better than this.
B003PJ6UHA|5.0|This is in fact a life changing book. My life is now much more beautiful after reading this book.  No more words!!!<br /><br />Regards<br />Vaithee

B001F6ZIXW|5.0|I missed season 1 so it was great to go back and see how things were from the beginning. 5 Stars
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Grisham never disappoints.  Great fiction intertwined with current and historical events, sympathetic and well-written characters and amusing plot twists.  Great clean read.  Never have to be embarrassed if someone looks over my shoulder to see what I'm reading.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Gillian Flynn does a good job of making some rather loathsome characters in Gone Girl, but the surprise twists will keep you turning the pages well into the night. We read this for our book club; and while everyone hated some of the characters with their flaws and personality quirks, the plot was intriguing and kept you guessing until the last page. It was a good book, but not a light read by any means due to the moral heavy content.  I really enjoyed the author's writing style as well. She had a way of describing scenes so you felt you could see them clearly through the pages of the book. The plot was also well thought out and with several mysteries that kept me intrigued throughout the book. I look forward to the movie in 2015.
B009AMANBA|3.0|good acting but too talky and too lengthy. couldn't finish viewing, never seemed to end. could have been better in edited.
B00ECU34ZM|5.0|The movie was great, very entertaining, enjoyed the special effects.  The combination of Freeman and Cruise made this movie.  I will see it again.
B008Y5UADK|2.0|I never watched it .I started playing but it was so slugies  I stopped & watched something else . A movie has be faster paced for me.<br />'
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|First, I didn't see the movie &#34;The Shining&#34;.  Secondly, I didn't read the book.  The cover and title of this book did not alert me that there may be a relationship between the Shining and Doctor Sleep.<br /><br />I only mention the above because in the early pages of the book I had difficulty putting things together.  If this book is indeed  a sequel to The Shining, think I would have read The Shining First.<br /><br />Having said that, once I got &#34;settled in&#34; to my perception of what was going on I enjoyed it and it was a real page turner.<br /><br />I'm a fan, so I would have given it a 5th star if the cover had indicated it was a sequel.<br /><br />Now if Stephen could only restrain himself from attributing disdain if not hatred by his characters for Republicans.
B00APUYN0I|5.0|I watched this movie with my tween daughter. She and I both liked Pitch Perfect very much. Yes, I agree the sexual references could have been toned down a lot. But it is nothing more than what kids now hear on an almost daily basis at school.  The movie was cute and the music was great!
B0090EHVMC|5.0|I love this Dr. Seuss' The Lorax, not only the artist did a good job also teach you to be a good nature lover.

B00DF6L25S|3.0|Has a lot of potential, but did not include the templates they showed on the ad, and the support is near zero.  I've emailed support, and even joined the forum, no answers..
B00BB3UYS8|5.0|Outview is a supernatural murder mystery that reconnects the reader back into their own childhood where we all still ponder those unexplainable coincidences, those fleeting visions, and most memorably, the dreams. The visions and dreams that float so freely in the mind of a child. Lost loved ones revisiting us, nightmares of death experiences, visions of lives and places that were not of our time nor our own homes.<br /><br />What impressed me the most was the way Brandt merged ancient mysticism with a modern day conspiracy. A very modern<br />conspiracy theory about a small group of greedy and maniacal people who steal the authority of a government and use the full might of a nations resources for their own purposes; turning it against it's own people. Brandt's conspiracy theory taps directly into today's far reaching Homeland Security and our own personal fears that it could one day become the very Nazi Fatherland that our grandfathers fought so hard to extinguish. In summary, the merging of ancient mysticism and modern day conspiracy adds contrast to the story which deepens and enriches the readers experience.<br /><br />With regard to character development, scene setting, scene transitioning, and overall writing style, Brandt has achieved a wonderful story which is well crafted and nicely written. The characters are warm and caring in this story where our hero is a true 'underdog' compared to his enemy.<br /><br />I highly recommend this story to anyone who enjoys a good mystery, a good thrill ride, and a passion for the supernatural.
B007EC27QM|5.0|Very clean interface, very good, one of the best I have seen.  It works well on my Nexus 7 tablet
B0089LOG02|5.0|This is a well written book. Although fiction, it shared information about the orphan train I knew nothing about.  It was an enjoyable read.
B008Y7N7JW|2.0|Not a realistic movie. The premise is real, but the various gadgets, sponsors, etc, makes it entertaining but not believable.
B0093QHWLC|5.0|liked it a lot, a lot of plot twists andd totally unexpected ending! Don't know how I never saw this movie before!
B00EZPCZ5O|4.0|This is a very solid effort from AFI. I just don't feel it's as good as Sing the Sorrow or Decemberunderground. If you're an afi fan though, I highly recommend this album. It's a nice return. My favorites are \\"A Deep Slow Panic,\\" \\"No Resurrection,\\" and \\"17 Crimes.\\"
B00BD99JMW|5.0|Veronica Roth has really made this conclusion to the Divergent Trilogy worth the wait.  No spoilers here, but set aside all your theories about how the series will end.  I'm willing to bet your theory is wrong.<br /><br />Roth continues to show her knowledge of Chicago and the surrounding areas.  She also explores the meaning of love, choices, heredity versus environment, and self-sacrifice.  There is joy, romance, grief, conflict, forgiveness, and resignation--sometimes all at once, it seems.  As a writer, I'm amazed at all the things she had to keep straight in her head and  astounded at the way she was able to tie up loose ends so brilliantly.<br /><br />That's all I can say without spoilers.  Enjoy! And keep some tissues nearby for a few chapters.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|This adds a function that the Kindle Fire sorely lacks.  It lets you move and delete files with ease.  It will be my go to file manager for anything Android related.  Keep up the good work ES Mobile!
B003G4W49C|5.0|In my opinion this was a sleeping giant.  It took a long time for a lot of years for it to get the attention it deserves.  I love reading this book.  I've read it every couple of years for the past ten years now and I never get bored of it.  My teenagers like it too.
B005LAII4E|3.0|The first joe was so much better but this one was good to I just didn't like the fact that my main character died
B000JMKQX0|3.0|It was a good book but it didn't quite meet the hype.  I guess it would have been better if I wasn't expecting more.
B004SMDJ9U|5.0|Haven to me is also different and interesting but also leave you wanting more that's why I gave it 5 stars
B003H4I4JU|4.0|Not quite as good as Ender's Game but its a must read after you finish Ender's Game.  It's best to order both at the same time because you won't be able to put down Ender's Game and you will will want to read this book without waiting for it to show up.
B002LB7S10|5.0|Great movie love the way it ended love the action and drama also sad but overall it was a great movie
B005NFVZTM|1.0|Can't believe I paid to rent this movie. What rubbish.<br />I love the X-men franchise so was looking forward to this movie.<br />No character development, not as you should see between Xavier and Erik, as is hinted at in the trilogy. And it even contradicts already created facts and scenarios within the movies, places, times, powers. Dumb.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|It was sent to me due to my original one had quit working. Problem solved by the on line tech support .
B0010VD7EO|4.0|I was familiar with about 5 of the tracks previously and love those, but a lot of the other songs on this cd were surprisingly folksy and almost bluesy, which is not my thing.  Really prefer the electronic, poppy stuff by MGMT but that's totally personal taste.  Very good album!
B009XHAM8G|4.0|A sweet little story. Over too quick but we'll read it over and over again. My eight year old and I will take turns reading it to each other.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This series takes you inside the two &#34;families&#34; that live in Downton.  You feel like an observer of a real live everyday drama there.
B004SIP7AS|5.0|I know they did not keep to Jane Austen's Emma, but I felt this version could stand on it's own. It has become one of my top 50 movies of all time.
B0044C3RB4|5.0|This series is not only about new ideas and sci fi trips but also has complex character development. Each episode can stand on its own. There is some backstory that helps to understand and identify with the characters but is not indispensable to the enjoyment of individual episodes. All the actors are convincing and the relationships between them are as compelling as the development of the story line.
0800141660|5.0|I could say nothing negative about this version of Sense & Sensibility. I was in love the entire time and watched it over again right away at the end.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|it's fun and addictive. lately when i finish a level it will say i failed and i will have to replay it. that is annoying. other than making me replay already passed levels. i love to play :]
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|its such an addictive game I cant stop playing it I recommend it to anyone who likes to pass the time.

B00AKKS278|5.0|This book is a must read for all young people and those who want to create a character to achieve constant success in life in all areas of life and living.<br />The author, Hal Elrod, has a wealth of experience and knowledge of principles he's applied in his life. His book the \\"Miracle Morning\\" has helped many of my own colleagues to succeed in their work and personal life matters.  It's a miracle. It works.<br />Read this book and DO it.
B006ZDS7CE|5.0|Lana Del Ray has a voice like Amy Winehouse only more angelic.  Other reviewers have said there isn't a bad song on this album and they were absolutely right.  My favorite song is one I have not heard on the radio (as of yet), Off To The Races.  That song might be a little long and complex for a radio single, but it shows off her entire vocal range and it tells a great story.  She sings with emotion on every song.  Best album from first to last that I have ever heard and my music taste run the gamut from Slipknot to The Righteous Brothers.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is the best game i have ever played. It is so fun. You should get this game. I love this game so get it now.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|I would recommend to anyone who likes to nose around in the Android file system. Terrific for removing the aftermath of removed applications.
B005MLOOJA|5.0|The acting was superb and the story line was full of intrigue!  Anybody that's interested in how the law works will become addicted to this series, and the interpersonal drama is the icing on the cake.
B005544V6A|5.0|Love, love this attorney/law TV show. And the main characters in those suits, oh my goodness. Harvey is way too cool for his shoes! And Mike's brain, are you kidding? Wow!
B000065V42|4.0|It was OK;  the only observation is that the picture came only in english; no subtitles and no other options for the languages; and this ítem was a gift for a person that doesn´t read in english.
B00F7YHDWC|5.0|This game s the absolute best! My friend had it in her ipod and I wanted it to come out on here so bad because she never let me play... lol..... If I could give this more than 5 stars I DEFINETLY would...
0786838655|5.0|My family homeschools and we read books together each night. This month we are doing a unit study on Ancient Greece so we thought it would be fun to read this book. I planned for us to finish it over two weeks but we just could not put it down. We read nightly, in the car, during the day...you name it. Great fun for the whole family. My kids are age 11 and 6.
B00AEFY5TI|3.0|I was told that this edition comes in a mini leather jacket, which it didn't.  I am upset because I paid extra for this edition and now I am broke and without a cute leather jacket :(
B00A4YVHXQ|4.0|Good for keeping kids busy for a short while, sometimes use prior to bed for concentration to s kindergarteners down
0345803507|5.0|Wonderful series, so very erotically romantic. Fires on all emotional cylinders that involve love and lust. This tale brings two people together against all odds.
B008XBHIEY|3.0|My children heard about this and wanted to see it. I remember when it came out, the special effects were cutting edge. Jaws, the fish, looks fake by modern standards. I only watched a few snippets and my children were not overly impressed.
B005TBN3EU|1.0|hangover 2 was not funny at all. hangover1 had comedy , but hangover 2 had a bunch of stupidity and it sounded like canned laughter.
B00BU18U82|4.0|The game is awesome driving tractors and everything but the only problem is it cost money and my dad does not let me get it because that it should be free
B009UX2YAC|5.0|The perfect game for someone who hates real running XD<br />It's a great game that me and my friends play all the time. I crave every new update.
B00DV9QHB8|5.0|The overheated PR blurb for this CD makes it seem as if two oceans are colliding at the meeting of Rattle and Lang Lang, and commercially that may be true, given Lang Lang's superstar status and the pre-eminence of the Berliners. But the pianist's most recent concerto recording, the Rachmaninov Second with Gergiev, was a bit clumsy and clattery. I also feared a kind of one size fits all virtuosity that misses the special flavor of Bartok and Prokofiev. On the plus side, Rattle's early Prokofiev recordings from Birmingham were sterling, and it would be a pleasure to hear what the Berliners could do with the sparkling, mercurial orchestral writing in the Third Piano Cto.<br /><br />Happily, my positive expectation have been fulfilled. Aided by exquisitely detailed recorded sound, the playing by the Berlin Phil. is colorful and alert, as dazzling technically as anyone might wish. I can't recall a Prokofiev Third that sounds this fresh and alive so far as the accompaniment goes, and Rattle isn't blandly corporate or fussy, two failings he is liable to. The pianist has a higher bar to meet, with rivals on the order of Gary Graffman, Evgeny Kissin, and Martha Argerich, to name a few personal favorites.  Lang Lang isn't as individual as any of them, as overpowering as Argerich, as richly Russian as Kissin, or as crystalline and modernist-sounding as Graffman.  But we're standing at the caviar counter trying to choose between beluga and osetra. His pianism is brilliant and exuberant throughout, delicate where it should be and technically commanding.  There's no question about Lang Lang's musicality, either. He has carefully considered the score and tried to say things that matter. When you throw in the lovely sound of the piano, this performance ranks among his best.<br /><br />A few years ago he toured with the Bartok  Second Cto., and when I encountered it in concert with the Vienna Phil. under Barenboim,  Lang Lang's playing was breathtaking in its sweep and confidence, even though he didn't have the ideal accompaniment from a conductor who didn't seem completely at home in Bartok (a surprise, since Barenboim is definitely a modernist).  Here the match of conducting and playing is very sympathetic - consider the mysterious, hushed atmosphere they create in the second movement. Bartok's orchestration has been tweaked out in every detail by Rattle and the recording engineers - we are miles ahead of the muddy sound on Pollini's notable account with Abbado on DG. Lang Lang takes pains not to batter the keyboard, making each line as clear as he can. The Bartok Second reveals touches of slinky orientalism I never noticed before, reminiscent of The Miraculous Mandarin.<br /><br />Any flaws for the detractors to throw around?  Rattle slows down very romantically for the luscious tune in the middle of the finale of the Prokofiev, risking schmaltz.  Lang Lang misses Prokofiev's wittiness compared with some performers. The Bartok could be more percussive in its approach to the composer's deliberately abrasive piano style.  These are matters of taste, naturally, not actual drawbacks. Of the two performances, I'd say that the Bartok makes the most headway, in that we get such brilliant orchestral playing and assured conducting, where the Prokofiev has been recorded so often that even this bravura reading doesn't conquer the field. All told, however, anyone who wants these two classics of twentieth-century piano writing could easily make Lang Lang's new recording a first choice, especially if there's a desire for updated sound.even though he didn't have the ideal accompaniment from a conductor who didn't seem completely at home in Bartok (a surprise, since Barenboim is definitely a modernist).

B006GLN3WY|5.0|Sex and the city is still a great show, even if it is nearly 15 years old... Best  ever after break ups
0385350864|3.0|Bridget Jones books are some of the few that actually make me laugh. I've re-read the first two multiple times, and still find myself thinking \\"v. good\\" when something goes well. So when this book arrived, I read it through in one go.<br />I'm honestly still not sure what to make of it. It was so sad in parts that I cried. It was heartbreaking on the topic of relationships. It was snide on the topic of parents and schools, and mildly scathing about the movie industry. The ending was sweet and good, but also sad to me. So much of it spoke of what is left after trauma and how one can't get through life alone.<br />Some themes from the earlier books are clearly rehashed, and it is quite formulaic in many ways. Still, unexpectedly touching.
B000AJIF4E|3.0|Not as good as beats quality, dont stay on on my motorcycle even with windscreen,sound OK when in car blocking out kids.
B000VDUWMC|5.0|Truly unique perspectives from a genuine polymath - in a very easily digestible format<br /><br />Diamond's analysis is exhaustive and conclusive<br /><br />I love the way he makes the analysis of even pre-history development truly interesting
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|i have been patiently waiting to play on my kindle fire.  Love this game! Fun, addicting, and challenging puzzle game.

B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is very challenging and highly addictive. I thoroughly enjoyed playing it. Would recommend to my friends. Blah blah blah
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Most of my FB friends were playing it so I decided to download it to my Kindle Fire and give it a try.  Right now I'm only on level 21 and they're all in the 200's or higher but as you progress from level to level it gets more challenging which is something I like.  Of course it helps if you know what happens when you match candies and what you can get by matching as many as possible.  I had a little help from my daughter and now I know alot more than I did as I didn't see any explanation of how to play anywhere.  There may have been and I didn't see it.  Candy Crush Saga is a fun game to play.  Just don't get sucked into &#34;buying&#34; help.  That could be as addicting if you like to win.
B00ESY7QXI|1.0|Watch the old one. This is a terrible Busby Berkley wannabe. It would have been OK if it was 15 minutes long.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Thank you for finally getting Candy Crush Saga for Kindle...i have been playing on my phone for awhile, but kindle is much larger and it makes it even better to play.  So far, i have not encountered any problems or glitches during download or while playing....thank you and please continue to bring us all such fun and entertaining games!  I hope everyone else is as pleased as i am...game on!
B0091REZMW|4.0|This game is nice. The scenes are nice. The only complaint I have is that the pictures are too dark. More light would help to see the objects better. I haven't been playing very long, but it seems to be one that can keep you well entertained.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|I downloaded it for my Kindle HD and it works great!!!!!!<br /><br />I had no problems so far to open .PDF files from any site.<br /><br />I'll recommended it to Kindle HD users.

I recommended it to my husband, daughter, and son; they rolled their eyes, but gave it a try and each one agrees how great it is. My daughter freely admitted she went into it determined not to like it, but states, &#34;I was hooked within five minutes!&#34;
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|GREAT SEQUEL! If you're looking to get lost in a good book, this would be a great choice! :) :)

B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Great stuff  , it make regular tv into a smart tv ! Just waiting for more applications to come  ! To really enjoy
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Fun game that changes what is needed each level.  It is fun to watch your friends pass you by or outscore them on a level.  The only thing I could say is that I hate waiting for more lives, but it makes me go do other things instead of playing it all the time.
B001BANK32|5.0|I decided to read The Shining recently, as I wanted to read Doctor Sleep (and wanted King's version since this is a sequel).  I knew I wouldn't be disappointed, but I didn't realize I would still be so enthralled after having seen the movie so many times.  I also didn't realize the ending was so utterly different.  Sorry, Kubrick...King wins this one!
B00ERIUO02|3.0|This one's my first Katy Perry cd, so I don't have anything else to judge it against other than what it sounds like to my uninitiated ears.  And what I'm hearing is a lot of Autotunes and ProTools filtering, layering and remixing on every track.  And it doesn't help that nearly every track ends the same way with an extended reverberating echoed tone or note.  I'm not sure if there's even any actual instruments used on this one.<br /><br />All the tracks are pretty short- only a handful make the four-minute mark- and utterly formulaic.  You can practically tell what's gonna happen when- when the bridge is gonna hit, when the reverb will kick in, etc- which starts to get boring fast.  There's kind of a flow as the later tracks sound more mature and introspective and much less glam and glitz.<br /><br />Some highlights:<br />Roar- by now we all know this one.  Catchy, with a good hook yet still like something more along the lines of Selena Gomez' teen queen stuff.<br /><br />Birthday- definitely an early 80s New Wave/R&B feel to it; more old skool yet still fully computerized.  Good cheesy fun to nod your head to.<br /><br />Walking On Air- straight EDM/House with an 80s/90s club vibe, this one's like some Taylor Dane or Cece Peniston.  Even Perry's treated voice sounds similar to them on it.<br /><br />Unconditionally- finally something resembling a song from a grown woman.  Lyrically it reminds me of Alanis Morrisette, and thanks to the engineering some of Perry's high notes sound a lot like her as well, which really ain't bad a thing here.<br /><br />Dark Horse (feat. Juicy J)- did Kanye West produce this one?  No?  You sure?  Cause thanks to that rap they inserted in it really kinda bites.<br /><br />This Is How We Do- remember Jamie Foxx's Blame It On The Alcohol?  Take it down a few notches and rework it into a teen friendly anthem of a club vamp.  The beats are alright; it kind of grows on you.<br /><br />International Smile- some Daft Punk stuff going on here.  Synths and vocorder are really popping on this one and her voice is mixed well with it.  Another one that gets your head nodding.<br /><br />Double Rainbow- slower, moodier pulses and beats on this one are a nice change of pace.  And I really like the lyrical sentiment of two souls in harmony on this one.<br /><br />By The Grace Of God- mostly piano based at first, it morphs into another attempt at overproduced maturity, which is what drags it down.<br /><br />It Takes Two- sharing responsibility when things go wrong is difficult.  But this song makes it a little easier to ask for forgiveness and shoulder your part of the blame.  Not so much techno-filtering and the more emotional lyrics in this one makes for one of the better tracks on the cd.<br /><br />All in all Prism ain't bad; like Miley Cyrus' Bangerz, it's an absolute reflection of the state of popular music, but infinitely better than that thing.  But it also shows what's wrong with it: too much reliance on tricks, smoke and mirrors instead of vocals, instruments and lyrics, plus still trying to straddle the line between tween girl and club queen like Britney Spears tried to do. Which is a shame because I get the impression Perry really doesn't have to rely on either one of those if she doesn't want to.Synths and vocorder are really popping on this one and her voice is mixed well with it.

6300215717|5.0|Has been so long since I've seen this, I couldn't remember it. What a lovely lovely movie. Hits the right note all through.
B005544TRQ|5.0|All Characters are well portrayed and story keeps moving fast with incidences. its quite interesting. a good watch for the entire family
B008602KQI|4.0|It was very strange but intriguing.  There was a disconnect for me with the story of the relationship between the lead actress and her mom.  Overall interesting.  I'd watch again.
006202406X|1.0|*Spoilers<br />In a nutshell, this book was just disappointing. And no, it's not just because Tris died. My disgust with the book goes even deeper than this.<br /><br />The writing style of this book wasn't even the same as the first two. Instead of just reading Tris's POV and enjoying the blurbs of Four here and there and in the mini books, each chapter goes back and forth. It's hard to follow who you're reading especially when you have to take frequent breaks.<br /><br />There's no passion behind the pen. The story is cold, harsh, and boring. It didn't flow, and by the time the drama started, I didn't even care. That's right, I didn't even care when Tris died. I was simply still reading because I can't stop reading a book, no matter how awful it is. I kept hoping I'd see a whisper of the first two book styles in it, but it never happened. In fact, you could probably just read this book and still get the overall plot of the trilogy because it echoed a lot of what Insurgent and Divergent already covered, just with no feeling.<br /><br />The best I can come up with is that Roth was bored with the trilogy by this book. She was bored of the characters, bored of the plot, and just wanted to uphold her contract and finish it. Sometimes an author ought to break contract instead of diappointing so many fans.<br /><br />Later Edit--<br />I've spent the last 24 hours reflecting on this book, and even pulled it back out. I'm still utterly confused. Why is there a need for a chapter that is basically one huge run on sentence? And why is there more than just one chapter like this? That's a waste of talent and trees. There's no flow to it, I'm still confused and can barely figure out what the sculpture at O'Hare really looks like. Tris and Four both had major personality changes. Compare reading Divergent to Free Four and there is obviously a different voice to both characters. You can TELL who is telling the story. But in Allegiant, there isn't a difference. Like someone said,it's so mono-toned. I was bored. And there's nothing more heartbreaking to me than not being able to care that the lead heroine died. This book just KILLED the potential the movies had. In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if the third book isn't ever made into a movie. Or that someone re-writes the entire thing. Or that the movie is released straight to DVD.
B00E0SX118|5.0|This is the first movie in a long time that my whole family wants to watch over and over again! Highly recommend.
B0094K1MH2|4.0|Good movie. The entire family will enjoy watching it. Lots of excitement and good humor. Get out the popcorn! You'll love it.
B00881VLCE|1.0|If my first puzzle was an indication of what was in store it's NOT good.  I had spent time on a puzzle, getting it about 1/2 completed when it crashed and I lost everything.  I deleted the app.
B009NX1YT6|5.0|One of the best musicals ever!  I could watch it over and over!  Travolta does some of his best work in this classic!
B00ESB6GBY|4.0|Still funny. Barney carries the show as usual. Ted is whiney as ever, and Lilly is getting a little weird too. Show is getting boring, good thing they are tying it up.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I just love this game so hooked on it play it all the time have many friends that play it to even my niece that is only seven plays it
B00EHMG358|5.0|Didn't think I would like going with a side lined character from Pendergast, but Preston & Child performed their magic and made Swanson into a likeable and interesting  addition.
B00F91RYL8|2.0|Disappointed.  Not enough storyline. It was recommended to me by my son who raved about it.  Maybe I'm too old but it didn't seem to go anywhere.
B000MR1V22|2.0|This just wasn't a very good movie. Character development was very predictable. Nothing really extraordinary about this movie. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.
B00DXP0QV2|4.0|Same great Album with many extras!! Love the demos and instrumentals!  The conert CD + DVD is great!  Nivana is missed.
1616550414|5.0|This book is amazing! I love the history of the Zelda game system, love all of the games, and this book helps so much to fill in gaps between games. I bought one for me, and one as a gift for a friend. Awesome book!
B00E8KC5HY|5.0|I will be brief.  It would seem that no praise too high can be bestowed on this magnificent reading of this Passion.  It is simply mesmerizing, compelling, stunning, incomparable, and UTTERLY BEAUTIFUL.
B0000DZ3IG|5.0|I loved the movie and the soundtrack. It's so good. All songs are clear. Thank you so much for this wonderful product. Will be buying from amazon again soon.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I can't wait for Sylvia Day to write the next book!!!! I hope it comes out soon... Love this series!
B00005RYKU|2.0|It was just an okay movie for me. It got off to a slow start and never really went where it could have as far as suspense and thrill are concerned. I gave it a two star rating because the actors were at least believable, the price was great as usual, the shipping was quick, and when I opened the package there were no surprises which is always nice.
B00846REIS|5.0|This trilogy is better than 50 shades! I highly recommend you to read this book! Love, love, love it! Gideon Cross and Eva Trammel..
B00E3IZIM0|4.0|***Please note, review is based on the 3D version***<br />-So I saw this movie available when I was strolling through a BestBuy Store, read the back of the cover and thought to a myself, \\"would this be something I like?\\". I decided to read some reviews on amazon. While the reviews are a mixed bag of positives and negatives. I kept reading about \\"Guillermo del Toro\\" who I believe directed the film but I couldn't match the name with a face. then I read that this movie is made by the same person who made Hellboy into a movie. Let me start off by saying, Hellboy was not something I liked at all, nor any of his other movies. For Example, the story, characters and feel of Hellboy and other movies by Del Torro are in my mind, extremely cheesy, and often annoying. This movie seemed to have a bit of a different feel, and after reading more on what the 3D version is like, I decided it would be worth buying to add to my ever expanding collection of bluray 3D movies. I watched this movie last night, without high expectations. I popped in the movie, grabbed a soda and some munchies, and watched with amazement. The 3D effects and CGI are truly top notch. There were parts when I thought to myself, \\"now this is what 3D movies need to look like\\", IMHO.  With the sound cranked up, feeding my ears with awesome sounds and my eyes gazing into the amazing CGI and incredibly dazzling 3D graphics, I was very happy and excited.<br />When the main actor of this movie came on, I was a little put off by seeing some \\"overacting\\" that was more annoying than enticing. Throughout the movie, there are parts where I wished they would just cut out the story, and just get to the cool parts where the CGI and 3D blend to make an extraordinary visual explosion to the eyes and mind. The actor who played Hellboy is in this movie, who is another person I cannot Stand watching - Ron Perlman. There are the good guys, who have to battle these incredibly large monsters coming from another dimension. The great part about the monsters is, they don't cut anything out as far as the full presentation of the monsters body, size and overall look. It's all there which is too cool. Often in movies like Godzilla, King Kong, and even the recent Hobbit movie where there is no actual scene that shows Smaug the dragon in his entirety, this movie does not leave you wishing you could see more of what these monsters look like. They don't make you use your imagination to fill in the blanks. In 3D, these monsters are popping out at you and look nothing short of incredible. The monsters are taken on by the good guys that use somewhat matching size Mech machines as shown on the cover of this movie. The Mech Machines are also dazzling to watch, and look incredible while combating against these evil monsters.<br />Looking at this movie from all perspectives, there were many things that make this movie worth watching again and again. This movie is so beautiful and the 3D is so good, that it's tough to rival compared to any other 3D movie I have seen at home (vs. in the theater or via IMAX). The 3D effects and stunning visuals alone makes me happy I purchased this film. The story itself, is not bad either. Is it great? Absolutely not, but trust me, it could have been a lot worse. It's got a good premises and although far fetched, it's exciting and makes you think a bit, which is what tells me a movie is good (from a story standpoint). The acting? Well, that depends on one's definition of acting. Most of it was tough to watch and you want to laugh at some scenes because the acting is way overplayed and comes off as lame for the most part. Acting aside, the actual actors in this movie are so-so. Del Torro makes his appearance, which to me was a real downer since I can't stand watching this guy. The main characters otherwise are not going to win any awards for this movie, I can asure you. This is an action movie, and there is no doubt that this is truly action packed. Some reviews state that the movie drags on, but I didn't feel that. It wasn't too short, and it is by no means a long film like any of the lord of the rings movies. There is not enough story and detail with characters and overall environment to support anymore time than the actual film dispays. There could have been some scenes that were shortened to keep the action scenes a little tighter, but overall the length of the film is appropriate in my opinion.<br />This movie, by far, will not be for everyone. My wife didn't watch this, but I can guarantee she would have rolled her eyes at the end of this film and would say \\"wow, that was really lame\\". Other reviews on this site for this movie have pegged it down pretty well. If you like old style Japanese movies with Godzilla and King Kong where there is mass destruction with every swing the bad guys take, then this is for you. If you like action packed films with fairly poor acting (almost comparable to B films with poor acting but decent story - for example movies on the Sci-Fy channel) then you will probably enjoy this. The major different between budget films and this is solely based on the amount of work that's gone into the CGI and overall effects. They are truly, truly amazing. This film could have been so much more, but for what it's worth, its a good flick for the action junkies, the nerds, the manga and Japanese Monster lovers, and for anyone with an open mind that can tune out the negatives, and see the movie for what is really is - an action packed, visually stunning and phenomenal 3D flick that will not leave you disappointed. If I were to see this in the standard Blu-ray edition, I think I would rate this somewhere between 2 & 3 stars. But, I got the 3D version, and am very happy I did. For this version, I would rate this a high 3 or low 4. Many will like this, however, many will find it an absolute joke. The question is, where will/do you stand???? See it for yourself, going in with low expectations and you might just be surprised.

B004J4WLB4|4.0|Enjoyed it. Theme of emotions through nature was interesting.  A woman's book. Doubt my husband would have liked it at all.

B000VEA38E|5.0|My grandsons who are 6 and 8 absolutely love this gift.  They both love music especially the younger one.  I chose it because I know they have a lot of star wars toys.  This is great music and my daughter says they want to listen all the time while they play with their toys.  They hum the music when out side playing .
B00F91SCXC|2.0|The movie could have been a lot better if things were explained better. Some parts where things were highlighted had no reason for them.
B00514HDNW|3.0|Very interesting to see the story behind both I Am Legend & first two versions of the movie.  Quick read...  Didn't expect the story to echo so much of the social/racial issues occurring at the time.  More than a horror book..
B007J4T2G8|5.0|LOVE LOVE LOVED IT!!!! Perfect sequencing and dialogue. Kept you wondering till the end. ..now I'm Sad it had to end....
B00CWY76CC|4.0|There are no instructions. They need to add hints or something,but you can figure it out in time. You don't want to stop once you pass one level you just got to beet the next.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|It is fun and challenging, but how about adding some clues.  Being stuck one level 7 for days and have no idea what I need to do.
B00ECU2RGY|4.0|Definitely a cool twist. Tom Cruise does a good job, as always in these types of movies. That man sure can run! Lots of good action scenes, and some good uestions at the end on identity and existence.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|A simple easy to read, easy to use calculator that is just right for a senior citizen with less than perfect eyesight and not-so-nimble fingers.
B00FPH6M82|2.0|It could have been really good, but it just wasn't. There wasn't enough exploration of future Earth and the animals, which resulted in us not finding it to be an interesting setting. Setting is so important in future negative utopia! The thing that happens with the bird is so unbelievable and just not right. I don't want to say more to avoid spoilers. Also, Jayden isn't as good an actor as his father. Poor kid, that's a lot to live up to. We love sci-fi, even bad sci-Fi, but this didn't even meet our requirements.
B0095ZQ36G|4.0|Light reading about a much simpler time when men had honor and every war event was not on the 6:00 news.
B008G12ERC|5.0|I will say just one thing : The four equal notes played by the bass player  after the chorus  &#34;follow me, you will follow me&#34;  are a punch on my chest !!!

B000FVQYYK|3.0|I bought here in Brasil, in these year,  all the five Cds recorded by  MUSE.<br />I am 55 years old and a rocker since 1970, and I am  trying to discover new sounds. Muse  sometimes is great !!! Maybe the best rock-pop since the  2000 'years.  But I think this is not the best Muse'Cd. It seems to sound more techno.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game! It is very addictive and I can't stop playing! I just wish the coins were a little easier to get without having to pay for them.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Each Season gets better and better!  Tremendous story lines; rich characters; edge-of-your seat drama. It makes me wish I lived at Downton!

B00190OHD6|5.0|This movie was so sweet, I have just become a Gerard Butler fan, he has great comedic timing and Hilary Swank is also great in this movie. Kathy Bates, Lisa Kudrow were also great.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|The game is fun,but I don't like having to keep purchasing more time just to keep going. I purchased once and thought that was the end of purchasing, but it just keeps asking for more.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|My family loves this game.  Each  level is different and never the same.  It keeps one's attention and never gets boring.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I like the writing and the story line but this is a really sick story and they both deserve each other! not sure if I want to read more of her books
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|this is my fave game so addicting friends and family like it also cant wait to get more lives to play against
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love having Candy crush on my Kindle, long awaited and now I can enjoy playing anywhere. Thanks Kindle and Candy Crush
B0011UBDTK|1.0|I usually never write a review but this deserved one.THe packaging was okay but I didnt really care about the looks. There wasnt a single disc that wasn't defective. THere was atleast one episode on every disc that wouldnt play. It was so bad I actually thought that it may have been my player so I tried another one. It wasnt the equipment, it was the discs!
0761169253|5.0|If you are a creative person, and often have the &#34;non creative&#34; feeling going on, learn to steal and you can make your life much easier!<br /><br />Great read!
B00FAPF5U0|1.0|I discoverd that there is no way to move past about level 23 without buying stuff to win so I deleted it. Then i saw all the bits on TV news confirming that this is a good proffit center for the seller which was designed to make it impossible to &#34;win&#34; without buying stuff to aid in moving up the levels. Oh well, at least I didn't fall for it
B009LMTDL0|5.0|This book i read at the perfect time in my life, 10 years into my tech career, and she hit home. I needed this! Thank you Sheryl Sandberg!
B0038OY6DW|4.0|Very well set for Victorian England, this is a really good version of the classic Holmes story! Plenty of action, and plenty of puzzle solving, with a mix of friendship and love to smooth things over. Great balance and fun dialog.
B00181JGI2|1.0|This movie was recommended by a friend as a great movie to watch.  We couldn't get through the first 15 minutes without hearing the &#34;f&#34; word no less than 50 times.  Not something I wanted to hear while trying to enjoy a relaxing evening with my wife.
B00E1L9N8E|5.0|If you thought Redford gave Gatsby an overly dramatic tinge, here you go.<br />Di Caprio is excellent in this rendering of the great Fitzgerald's novel; and the whole work is brought up to speed and into the 21st century. T Maguire and the other characters are great, awesome effects and really cool soundtrack!
B0089LOG02|4.0|loved the book for introducing me to a part of history that I did not know about. The treatment of the orphans was a disgrace.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Addictive!!!! Next thing to do is make Bubble Witch available on android tablets & life will be greater!<br />Love this game!
B00899F0G8|5.0|I am seriously in love with this show! It constantly keeps you on the edge of your seat not knowing what will happen next. I hope they keep this show going for many more seaons!
0810983915|5.0|This author makes reading fun because kids can relate to the kids in the book. My kids enjoyed the series of Diary of a Wimpy Kid alot.
B00FPH3YQA|3.0|The first one is still the best. This one is better than the second one though. You have to like Chow somewhat though cause this movie has a lot of him in it. Good but not great.
B00D48BSBA|5.0|riveting from beginning to end. A great read. Not too farfetched and good imagery. Hope there is a follow up on this one
B0058SNI5S|3.0|I feel like the 3 bears... the first pair I ordered were too small & the size 10 were to large. But they are cute!
B00A6CCF0K|3.0|I enjoyed this book as a follow up to &#34;The Shining.&#34;  I enjoyed the story line, but it did seem to have some holes in it.  I didnot enjoy the unnecessary frequesnt referrences to AA recovery.  I think that this is personal experience of the author.  Just knowing that he was handling his drinking problem was enough. Overall a worthwhile read.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Candy Crush is a very great addicting game!  Ive been playing it for a year now.  I love Candy Crush!
B00DJ80VLS|2.0|I'm very disappointed with this record. The sound is crap (Mangini's drums sound awful. Especially the snare drum) Where is the so called &#34;guitar sound as thick as a layered chocolate cake&#34; per Pertrucci's comments on the web updates ? How about Jordan Rudess? He barely shines and I only counted 4 solos all record long. This album would have shine 25 years ago, but in 2013 it barely gets 5 out of 10. I hope they come back to this decade and release a note worthy record once again. Don't bother buying it. Borrow it from a friend instead.
B004TE6V4M|5.0|i collect only the most amazing pop-up books and this certainly a favorite. such a great story and the book has so much detail... highly recommended
0553384775|1.0|I knew this book was going to be a little over the top and I love reading about Wall Street and I love the glitz, glamour and I'm a Republican!!!!!!  But geez, after a while, how much can you read about JB and his asinine world?  Ugh, I stopped half way, after what they did to the gay butler he hired!!!!!!!!  Threw the book right in the garbage and got a refund.  So depressing...
B0002NRQTI|5.0|Counterparts was a hard record for me to get into, but I did get into it. And loved it. Now it's just hard knowing it came out 20 years ago this month.<br /><br />Animate, the opening track, was particularly hard at first: That droning Hammond organ distracted from the rest of the performance - too up front in the mix for me, but eventually, after enough listens it falls back. I loved the rhythm of the song, carrying a sort of masculine, `every man's' groove to it. And then the solo veers in, breaking the song's intentional pace down as if the song itself is deferring to its own feminine nature.<br /><br />Stick It Out is a fun but assertive track -- to me, really more of a Rushified rock/metal song in response to the rock of that period. Rush seems to say 'this is how it oughtta be done.' And in some ways, a response to their prior three or four records that were heavier on synths.<br /><br />Cut to the Chase is absolutely brilliant! Rush hadn't had a song like this, sonically, before - nor have they since. It's truly a bright gem in their collection and NEEDS TO BE PERFORMED LIVE. My second favorite track on the record, it creeps in with a quiet, suspecting rhythm that builds up to a locomotive chorus, graced by one of the most articulate guitar solos in Lifeson's history.<br /><br />Nobody's Hero has a certain degree of spirit and character to it, akin to Rush anthems like Closer to the Heart (from `78s Hemispheres) and Resist (from `96s Test for Echo), not because of the prominence of the acoustic guitar, but just the nature of the music and lyrics and how well they suit one another. Despite its melodic, easy-to-sing-along quality it's uncomfortable in its lyrical themes around heroism in the midst of tragedy.<br /><br />Between Sun and Moon is a 'love it or hate it' song, with some nice nods to The Who and The Rolling Stones, among other influences. I'm closer to the later camp, though I do give it the occasional listen to shake things up. My guess as to why this song works well might be because they were having too much fun making it.<br /><br />Alien Shore is another amazing, energetic, \\"step on the gas\\" song: The dynamics ebb and flow from this manic intensity to a sort of fun, conniving reserve in the verses, only to break loose again going into the choruses. And that solo - for some reason it feels like it's drawing sonic influences out of the 1970s (in general). It glides along initially with the ensemble, then jumps up and crackles in more of a vocalist manner than that of a 90s-era shredder.  It's one of my favorite understated solos - that's hard to achieve, and Alex masterfully does so. This song has a lot of 'light and shade' in my opinion, something Jimmy Page said of Zep's music. But that's just my take, not his.<br /><br />The Speed of Love is a zen-like cleansing breath on the record. Half-way in, the guys give us a track that seems to be inspired by Bravado's unusual, inspiring and endearing composition, but one that is more hypnotic and introspective. Even mystical. Unfortunately, I find the rolling snare drum portion coming out the bridge totally out of place with the rest of the song. Further, it's awkwardly positioned right before the most oddball song on the record, which makes listening to it even harder in album order.<br /><br />Double Agent: One of the last songs recorded for the record and written by `The Rockin' Constructivists' (if I remember correctly). This is not a song, it's an event. The concert video for this song - which I haven't seen in 20 years - haunts me still, but this `event' shows how effortlessly these guys can abandon their comfort zones and create something harsh and beautiful. I like this track, but again only on occasion. I don't want to get used to it. It's just too bold for casual listening, and it's worthy of setting aside to savor.<br /><br />Leave That Thing Alone, the instrumental, should've swapped places with Double Agent to lead us out of Speed of Love a bit more gracefully. Alas. This is just a cool, jazzy instrumental, pulling the organ back into the mix (which I think is a cool contrast to Presto's piano, btw). Here it percolates with the rhythm section throughout, but blasting the way forward in advance of another Lifeson masterful solo. There's a proper and welcomed simplicity to the song, one that accentuates the more complex passages and riffs that come along. It's the un-YYZ, and if both songs were people they'd be best of friends (probably singing Alien Shore or Chemistry to each other).<br /><br />Cold Fire (I'm sorry, why isn't this track #2 on the record?) A great song that, like Alien Shore, ebbs and flows between emotional exploration and grinding intent. It's uptempo with melancholic soft spots in the melody that set us up for a rich, intense, this-is-how-it-is chorus. Very radio-friendly, and I loved the counterpoint background vocals in the chorus - different, and cool.<br /><br />Everyday Hero is breathtaking, rich, and triumphant. It's truly an amazing song. And it's an exceptional way to close an exceptional record: This symphonic track masterfully blends drama and concern with optimism and hope. \\"No matter what they say.\\" Lee just keeps saying it over and over, as if to say that this record is full of relationships - within self, with adversaries, with opportunity, with loved ones, with reality, with those who are different, with our mate, with our fears, and now with our circumstances. \\"No matter what they say.\\" Whoever \\"they\\" are, \\"we\\" are here too, and there is a balance to be achieved in all that is said and done. And for better or for worse, there is hope and a reason for optimism. But we're the ones who have to fly. Sonically it's gorgeous and appropriately captures so much of what came before on the record. It ties it all together and sends us off with that message, that each of us has an everyday glory waiting to be pursued. And it does so with such powerful, engaging music.<br /><br />I'm pleasedthese songs - all of them - were crafted and conveyed to us on a record that was fresh and bold. (And as with all records, remember my rule: Three listens, each at a different time of day and in a different setting over three days. Then and only then will your heart make up your mind for you.)
B00FWLDHSY|4.0|It's a good update of the old Japanese monster movies with a good bit of action a decent cast and the average story line.
1577312082|5.0|This book is an essential read for people everywhere.  It can change our world, our planet, by changing people inside!
B00A8ECU24|4.0|My daughter and I have been playing this game for nearly a year. We love it!  Despite our setbacks of having to restart, we continue to play.  I have found the customer support at GameLoft very helpful when things go wrong.  We definately suggest giving it a try!
B00F35B8F8|5.0|Without giving away any of the plot (for those who have not already seen it) Star Trek Into the Darkness does not fail to thrill and entertain!  J.J. Abrams ability and vision (especially with this story, and remember, the Star Trek universe is now changed!) can only be compared to Steven Spielberg, which is probably the highest compliment I can pay.  ALL of the cast is amazing, and I can hardly wait for part three.  History seems to bear out that the second picture in a series always seems to be a little lacking (with a few exceptions) this is definitely not the case with Star Trek Into the Darkness.  If you liked the first one, you will love this one!
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|This is the continuation of a great series. Those who have watched the earlier seasons are undoubtedly hooked, but you'll want to start with earlier seasons if you've just started watching. So far, this season has lacked the nerve-racking episode endings that have you anxiously anticipating the next episode. Don't get me wrong, the endings have been good, but have yet to be on par with earlier seasons. The main cause is due to the difference between immediate and general threat (e.g. this zombie will eat me or there's a zombie out there that wants to eat me).
B00DXP0QV2|5.0|I bought the Nevermind Super-Deluxe Edition 20th anniversary box set, so I had high expectations for this one and i was not disappointed. 2 new songs (well jams really but who cares, it NEW Nirvana) and the DVD is over 2 hours of footage.  Must have for any serious fan and collector.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|I just downloaded this game onto my new kindle and it is very fun. I am an older adult and this game suits me just fine.

072325804X|5.0|Good quality. Child loved it. Great for gifts. Will probably be buying one for my son when he is old enough to read this.
B002SR2PKG|2.0|Of Stephen King's many excellent books, this is one of the true greats. Every page is entertaining in its own right. Unfortunately, the Kindle version is rife with errors which appear to be related to OCR conversion. For example, nearly every closing quotation mark is preceded by a space. Words are misspelled. Stray characters appear. I don't recall such issues being present in the print version. These errors are distracting and make it difficult to get lost in the story. Such an important book should have been proofed more carefully.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Online I have access to upgrades that I can't use on all. Would be nice to have them. I like the program overall.
B00EY8A6BC|5.0|Totally was not expecting the ending! What a great and well done flick!  I loved it very much.  You won't be sorry.

B00FDSV4TA|5.0|Upgrade to Wieland, Bennington is great! Only con is it's not a full album, but highly recommend, hope he stays with them.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Game is great and fun to play. But does require missions and tasks to go to next level. plus if you fail one you lose a life then eventually have to wait for more lives.
B005PK56TA|5.0|I just found this show. Watched entire season in just a few days. The one word that comes to mind to describe this show: TWISTED.

B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love Candy Crush! Super happy it's on kindle now! I've had it on my phone for a while and have been hoping it'd come to kindle!
B000FC1HBY|4.0|I had not seen the HBO special on this book but had read reviews, etc.  This challenged my imagination in trying to picture the locale of the drama taking place.  I liked that the chapters were entitled with the character's name and then told his/her story but then brought it all together.  And the ending was spectacular!  I have to admit I didn't quite see that coming.<br /><br />It's a long book, and I sometimes had trouble keeping the characters straight.  The glossary at the end was helpful but as I read this on my Kindle I didn't know it was there until I got there.  However, I am now more familiar with the characters and am reading the second book in the series.  I recommend this book for imaginative fantasy, sci-fi enjoyment.
B002QVZ71I|5.0|I don't watch movies more that once. I have seen this four or five times. It drives my wife nuts because I will quote lines from it for the next month.
B00F2362IE|1.0|App just doesn't work work at all, my 3yr old son is disappointed every time he clicks on it, im trying to figure out how to reinstall without payin again.
B009VIZDLI|5.0|The book was a joy to read from start to finish. I loved the characters and laughed out loud almost every chapter.
B00ARHAAZ6|5.0|I would highly recommend this book to those who enjoy a fast-paced, action packed story with a great plot. Funny at times too. All the main characters of the story have very distinctive personalities. I love all the characters, and especially the protagonist, David. David is a strong-willed, smart and funny character, who likes to give really funny metaphors! You pretty much know the gist of the story right from the beginning but there are few surprises here and there throughout the story, and at the end of the book, all the bit and pieces come together perfectly! I enjoy reading this book tremendously!
B00933JF74|5.0|This game is the best but I wish you could shoot geese and the rabbits and more types of buildings were able to be built , like a barracks so you could fight other players but they can't invade , say like  make a leader board of who has the best army and stuff . the only thing that sucks is that you run out of wood a oddly fast. Other than that most best sim game in the app store
B001I45UFC|5.0|I haven't read the Chronicles in many years but I am enjoying rereading them more than I thought I would. Lewis' timeless writing and skillful storytelling is a delight. These books are also delightful with their wonderful illustrations. In black and white on my Kindle and in color on my Mac they enhance the books perfectly.
B00EGMQIJ0|4.0|A great read. Captures well the potential dangers of a fully &#34;transparent&#34; world created through social media. A must read for anyone concerned about the erosion of their privacy in the digital age.
B004132HZS|5.0|As some previous comments have stated, I was reluctant to watch yet another version of this crime solver.  But one day I found myself bored and decided to take the plunge.  Boy was I in for a treat.  It was intriguing the way they portray Sherlock, he's funny but brutally sarcastic, a high functioning sociopath is how he describes himself.  And its set to modern times, how refreshing.  The chemistry between Benedict and Martin is uncanny!  A true bromance, borderline homoerotic at times...its with no surprise that the fandom is obsessed with terms like shiplocked and johnlocked.... The rest of the cast is superb as well! I simply adore the actor who plays Mycroft (Sherlock's brother), Ms. Hudson, Molly and the greatest villain EVER, Moriarty (Andrew Scott).  In summation, I can admit I am a HUGE, NON APOLOGETIC fan of this show.  I couldn't recommend it enough.  I have watch season 1 and 2 about 3 - 4 times now.  And because of this show, I have now followed both Ben's and Martin's career from The Hobbit to Star Trek to anything Cumberbatch is in...truly excellent acting on both actors.  Don't wait any longer, rent or buy this series
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|My husband and I are hooked on this series. The characters have become real for us and the acting is brilliant. We like the time period and the bit of history/current events thrown in!

B00EP0KBXM|1.0|Will Smith and Jayden make a good team,  they seem to be great together.  Some of the stunts were a little out of reason but I realize it was a futuristic movie.  Worth watching for sure.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Thanks for fimally bringing CCS to Kindle..<br />thought it would never come. The app is great and runs great...got it free, but would habe been happy to pay for it! And so glad for the facebook interface! Love it!

B006LR0XLM|5.0|For those of us who have a lot of things to store off computer, this is another great cloud storage facility, with the added advantage that you can store items that you want to share with other people while using other storage sites for 'sensitive' material.
B00FWLSLJ4|5.0|Love it. Monsters fighting GIANT Robots. Story is a little silly but come on, it's got Monstera fighting GIANT Robots. If you don't love it you've lost the wonder that makes childhood amazing.

B00FAX6XQC|5.0|The graphics are outstanding and most real. I love it and it most challenging, especially the duck hunting .I would like to see more games like this, maybe one dealing with fishing if possible.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|Great story, great music, especially Anne Hathaway's heart-breaking performance, wonderful acting.  If you only see one musical about post-Revolution France starring major movie stars, this is the one to see!
B000WS4PCO|5.0|We had this CD for years & it finally stopped working.  Very happy to replace it with one of great quality sound.
B005HSL626|4.0|This app is an all day lover and will keep you going. It is fun and a joy for all ages.
B0000029DD|5.0|This CD is a pleasure to listen to from start to finish ~ a bit moody & lovely.  But I'd buy it for &#34;Grace&#34; alone too!
B002VKE1K2|1.0|wow...i was really not expecting this to be anywhere near as scary as those ridiculous commercials made it out to be.  those people sitting in the theatre, pressed back as far into their seats as they could get, clenched fists up to their faces, jumping and screaming...what movie were they watching?  and i wasn't disappointed.  not scary, even a little.<br /><br />supposédly filmed as a documentary, it couldn't have looked less like one.  i was so bored, i played pokémon Y through just about the whole thing.  i can attest that it is scarier than this movie.<br /><br />seriously, what is so frightening about some \\"low humming\\" or \\"footsteps\\" or a shadow you can barely see on the bedroom door or the girl standing for 2 hours FFed so WE wouldn't have to stand for 2 hours?  nuthin', that's what.<br /><br />thankfully, the girl never gave in to the idiot boyfriend's numerous attempts to film them phuqing, although this may have brought some real terror to the move.<br /><br />i kept saying, out loud, to the tv, \\"kill him\\" and \\"when is the demon going to kill him?\\".  then, we're gypped by not even getting to see him die.  i love psychological horror.  this is not even that.  nothing implied made me worry about what was going to happen.<br /><br />the only realistic part was the girl's reaction to the boyfriend's numerous attempts to film them phuqing, which progressively got more and more disgusted, and her reactions to his meddling which, had this been real, would've been the whole reason the demon was messing with them.<br /><br />avoid this movie.  even 1.99$ is too much to pay for this trash.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Addicting fun game highly recommend to play and enjoy the excitement that each level brings to the table. Good fun
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|So, far I like the book a lot.  I like most mysteries.  The book reminds me of those old crime movies like The Maltese Falcon.
B0036S4B6M|5.0|One of the best books I've read in a long time. It is a fascinating look inside the women's prison system. But it is also a testament to the power of female friendship. If you are at all curious about Piper Kerman's story this is totally worth your time.
B001TH16DI|5.0|Fantastic Blue Ray STOS Movie Collection. The picture and Sound Quality are great. Lots of good and fun bonus features on each disk. A must have for any ST Fan.
B00AYB1TP0|5.0|This app truly is the best way to learn the English alphabet. It uses fun puzzle games that allow children to learn, while making them feel like they're just playing a game. My kids cannot get enough of it. I'm so glad that this app exists to not only entertain my children when I'm busy, but to also provide an exercise for cognitive ability. My children will play on this app for as long as they can without ever getting bored. This is an amazing quality of an app, since my kids are most always jumping from task to task. Sometimes they can be hard to keep up with, but this app allows them to settle down for a change.<br /><br />From a development standpoint, this app is of a very high quality. It always runs smoothly and never crashes. It is quite remarkable that it has been made to suit children very well and allow the to independently use it.<br /><br />If you are a parent, you want this app. It's entertainment qualities combined with learning capabilities make it perfect for every parent to have for their children. I wholeheartedly recommend this app.
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|Lee Child is a well trained writer and his skill is apparent in this finely tuned story. The book flows very well and will keep your attention and interest. I'll read a lot more Jack Reacher tales.
B008JFUUQ2|5.0|A great musically charged comedy that entertains while making you laugh out loud ! The performances are awesome and memorable

B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I resisted watching this one because it seemed like it would be such a cliche, with everyone else watching it.  However, its a wonderful series.....grabs you from the very first episode.  Maggie Smith is delightful in the role of matriarch of the family.  I highly recommend it for men and women alike.
B00B99KJR0|5.0|I love this game!!!  Money well spent. I play it over and over and it never gets boring to me.
B0036EDVS0|2.0|Kinda slow. Christopher Walken was pretty terrifying though! Well acted movie. Follows the book fairly closely and that makes it a bit drawn out.
0345529057|5.0|They were better than expected for paperback, and after a few read throughs they're still holding up their shape.  Love them!
B00FQAZ7PW|5.0|Best album in a long time, and that says a lot coming from a band such as this! Definitely worth listening to!

B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I have a hard time putting this game down no other game is as challenging even though some levels are so hard

B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I thought I had this book figured out - not true!  It kept me up a few nights until I could finish it. I have already recommended it to several of my friends
B003QSS2VW|5.0|Family friendly. Very enjoyeable to watch. No cussing or using God's name in vain. A single Mom cat with kittens gets kidnapped by their Butler so he can get the owner's inheritance. Mom cat meets an alley cat who helps to get her and her kittens back to her owner and defend the family against the butler.
B00FFL8ZMY|5.0|Every recording they have are as good as the one prior! Love Alter Bridge! Somehow as great as they've ever recorded! Impressive!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I love the attention to details and the complexity of the story line. It makes you feel as though you are indeed a part of the lives being portrayed.
B004FRX0MY|5.0|Easy to use, keeps my music organized and easily available.  I love all amazon applications. Amazon cares about it's customers and offers many free items.  Highly recommend~
B007SGLZP8|3.0|while is was an entertaining story, i would normally expect a little more meat from Grisham.  Even in his comments at the end, John seemed to indicate that the effort was a less than normal.
B00ENTDDGW|3.0|Have only tried to play once. Didn't do very well. I have not had enough time to hone my skills on this game. Seems ok, but only time will tell. Since it was free I will not be too concerned with the outcome.
B00AB7HESI|4.0|I got this for my nephew and he seems to really like it. It kept his attention for some time which is good for a 10 year old.
B00CZ1HELA|4.0|I enjoy puzzles.  This is not a hard game, but it is entertaining.  The solutions are interesting.  It is never the same twice.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|Got into these with my grandspn, and have thoroughly enjoyed watching the different action movies.  I would put this one right up there.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Stephen King has done it again.  A novel that makes you think and scares the crap out of you all at the same time.
B00F35BV64|5.0|Interesting to see the different takes on how it all began!  You won;t be sorry you watched this.  Hope you enjoy it as much as we did.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love horses so this game allows me to take care of one for free. I don't like how it works on real world time but it's still fun.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is sooo much fun. I have a hard time putting it down. I have installed it on my smart phone, so I can play it everywhere.
B002G917ZK|5.0|A perennial favorite, you'll enjoy the story along with the lovely New York backdrop of the upper East Side and Miss Hepburn showing off Hubert du Givenchy and some of the best little black dresses we've ever seen. It's also got some anachronisms courtesy of Mickey Rooney that show us how far we've come.<br /><br />You can't help but think that this was New York when it was at its zenith after WWII...a city on top, embued with the optimism that sad people needed to remake themselves in a new world. Is the film as gritty as the book? No.  But it doesn't really matter.<br /><br />It stands all by itself just fine.
030745455X|5.0|Couldn't put it down. Palms still sweaty.  Took a couple of attempts to get in to first book, and so glad I bought all three before starting this trilogy.
B009949RKC|5.0|Frightening time capsule of a film that shows us what happens to bullies when they mess with the wrong chick!  The opening scene would NEVER make it into a film these days.  Shocking in ways you'd never anticipate....
B00985E3UG|5.0|An excellent book revealing how big agra business controls the government and controls what's in the stores for us to purchase. Luckily we live in a free country and we don't have to purchase all these heavily infused foods with sugar, fat, and salt.
B00AECDDYY|5.0|Is simple yet random so gameplay is varied enough to want to play a few times. Fun little strategy game.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Finally on my kindle!!!! I have this app on my phone and I'm waiting for next update! Love this game...I swear it's gonna end my marriage ! Lol
B004GHNIRK|3.0|Not the version I remember...like the comment from Hugo at the end<br />Great story if you do not know storyline
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Google has done it again. Simple, seamless and very solid construction. For the occasional streamer to the hardcore TV viewer this is the perfect device
B00AKKTDJY|5.0|I play it all the time. I even purchased the extra buildings so I could play them also. If you purchase the game I'm telling people now, it's not a full game. You have to purchase the other buildings in order to play them all.
B00EZPCZ5O|5.0|AFI have changed their sound a bit over the years and personally I like the progression and enjoy their new stuff as much as their earlier tunes. And that being said I must say AFI's new album Burials is a really strong album of hard rocking and versatile Goth Rock tunes. There's not one bad or weak song on the album and if you like this band's current sound then you should really enjoy this disc. The band is as tight as ever with Davey Havok delivering his usual melodic and sometimes haunting vocals, Jade Puget on guitar, Hunter Burgan on bass and Adam Carson on drums and all three providing backing vocals. The production from Gil Norton is top notch with the each song mixed to maximum effect from both lead and backing vocals and the instruments supporting them to the SPFX which are well used yet not overbearing thus creating songs with melodic impact but, not overproducing them. From the gloomy opening tune \\"The Sinking Night\\" that has an almost Goth Pink Floyd vibe to it, to the intense \\"I Hope You Suffer\\", to the fast paced and morbid \\"17 Crimes\\" this is an album that seems to indicate a band getting back to their more intense and darker side after the well made and satisfying but, somewhat lighter toned Crash Love. Even when the album does lighten up a bit like on the slower paced \\"Heart Stops\\" the band's darkly whimsical lyrics are present to tell this tale of a broken heart. But, the album rarely slows down and when the band does have a little fun like on the slightly more upbeat \\"Greater Then 84″ there is always still a touch of the morbid to remind us that they haven't forgotten their roots or influences and we won't be getting hearts and flowers anytime soon. And we wouldn't want it any other way. The first studio album from AFI in 4 years is definitely worth the wait and is a solid 13 track album that should satisfy fans of this Goth/ Rock/ Punk band and maybe earn them a few new ones in the process. A really solid and hard rocking album from AFI and highly recommended if you are a fan of theirs or Goth Rock in general. Great to have them back and in top form! A really good album!ghly recommended if you are a fan of theirs or Goth Rock in general. Great to have them back and in top form! A really good album!
B0043GAZYS|5.0|Michael Cera's boring-ass attitude pays off in this movie since that is what Scott is like. It's not as good as the books, but it is still pretty good.
B00ESY7QXI|3.0|The original Gatsby is better.  Robert Redford plays a more modest Gatsy.  I prefer Mia Farrow in the role of Daisy.  Gatsy was set in the 1920s; hence, the music of the roaring 20s fits better with the movie than the hip hop tunes of the new version.
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|I'm. Excited to read series. I enjoyed all of this book. I loved all harry potter books and this series kind of seems along the same lines on how in depth the author gets. I'm pretty sure after city of ashes, I'm gonna start believing these people exist haha
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is very addictive!  It utilizes your thinking skills and therefore improves brain power.  I don't think I'll ever stop playing.  The only time I pause is when I've exhausted my game lives.<br /><br />Merle
B007REV4T8|5.0|Loved it James Bond Movie alot of action and Daniel Craig is very good actor. I was surprised by the ending . But I guess all things come to an end.  ENJOY !
B006PHD0RW|5.0|Super addicting game.. can't put it down! The characters and the sound makes it worth it. I feel my brain working.
B008YWY0HK|4.0|This movie is very good. I was touched by the theme. Really teaches kids what a desire can do if it is the wrong one.
006202406X|5.0|As I write this review, I'm still in shock. Not because Allegiant was horrible, but quite the opposite--it was good, it was realistic, it was unexpected, and oh my goodness, it was emotional. I'm still reeling from the ending. Just my saying that might have some of you guessing at what the ending could be, but you'll probably still be surprised (well, unless you already read a spoiler somewhere, of course). I was entirely shocked--I'm not sure I've ever encountered a YA novel that ended quite like Allegiant did. Does it sound arrogant to say I'm proud of Veronica Roth for writing it the way she did? I hope not, because I truly mean it as a compliment. So many authors either avoid reality or plunge too far into it, turning it so tasteless that it's like trying to swallow bitter ash. But Allegiant walks a fine line of bringing those moments that make us giddy and happy, and then reminding us of the seriousness of being a real person in real life.<br /><br />Dang, I loved this book.<br /><br />I wasn't sure at first. Insurgent was good, but not as amazing as Divergent, and of course Allegiant started off in yet another different way, so I had no idea how it would go. Whereas Divergent was almost insta-love, Allegiant was more like falling in love with a best friend who just sort of crept up on you...unexpectedly in some ways, but yet, not so unexpected.<br /><br />I suppose I should actually mention the plot, beyond all these vague hints. I don't want to give too much away, and I think the summary covers the plot just fine, so what I'll do is I'll talk about the questions that are addressed in this book. If you want to know absolutely nothing about the plot and what is answered, stop reading here!<br /><br />So...for the rest of you. Yes, Tris and Tobias finally learn what's outside of their city. They learn where they are, what's been going on in the outside world, and how their faction system originally got set up. We also see what happens to the city they're from, so it's not like the city's totally been left behind. Tris and Tobias have to again make decisions about their values and morals, and they are wonderfully true to character. And I don't mean they keep making the same decisions no matter what, I mean that they change, grow, and make decisions based on both old values and new realizations. Just like any person does. We also get a little bit of an epilogue, which is nice. I'm glad the book didn't just end--I hate when stories do that. Especially considering this ending...yes, it is extremely sad. It will probably have you in tears. You may hate Veronica Roth for a while. But...the fact that the book makes you care so much about the end? I think that's the mark of a good writer.<br /><br />If someone's looking for critiques, the best I can give you is that Tobias has changed from who he was in Divergent, and some fans may not like that, who knows. He's a little less mysterious since the POV switches between him and Tris, and some people might not love seeing more of his tortured soul. Also, some of the science/ scientific ideals seem a little unbelievable to me, but I suppose you have to sort of take that in stride when you're reading a dystopian.<br /><br />But all that aside, it was the writing style, message, and characters that mattered more to me, and I loved all those. So a definite five stars for Allegiant, and I can't wait to see what Veronica Roth comes up with next!o it's not like the city's totally been left behind.

B00BAXFECK|5.0|The intricate construction of this book creates a rainbow edge of its own.  At the same time, a traditional plot summary becomes impossible without wordiness and spoilers.  I get a sense of just how good the writing is when I try to para phrase it.  I began caring about Theo, a young boy as the novel opens, from the outset.  His observations bear that Tartt trademark of wisdom without precious worldliness.  Through his eyes unrolls a plot which captures the reader as tightly as it has our Theo.  the peripheral characters are jewels on their own, and combined with Theo create a series of dyads and triads that bring the reader closer to the world in which, \\"we cannot choose what we want and don't want and that's the hard lonely truth.<br /><br />The settings play their own role and many of them serve as characters on their own.  The interiors of the rooms enmesh themselves in our perceptions.  For example, the high society apartment in which he lives is lovely, but it is a touch off.  There is no natural light to speak of and this slight murkiness reflects the opaqueness which can appear in its family.  As Theo travels, he sees the world in context and this vision is given to us.  Another example would be the Las Vegas location with its harsh light and unforgiving vistas.<br /><br />through the book, the painting of the goldfinch serves as an enigmatic observer and commentator.  Is the bird a glimpse of freedom or does he tell us of our chains with the little gauntlet on his ankle.<br /><br />I like a good long book to pull me in and entrance me.  This book has filled that job with wit and insight.
B005RYF5JA|5.0|I started watching the X-Files that came soon after the Star Trek movie series so I am currently watching the X-Files and haven 't, as yet, even started with Star Trek.
B00821OX98|4.0|The acting is better than average and quality of production is good for a television show.  I look forward to getting around to the following seasons.

B00CAJMGDI|5.0|I am a recent subscriber to Slacker Radio electronic channel and couldn't help but stop what I was doing when \\"Crystallize\\" came on. I had never heard the song before, let alone artist Lindsey Stirling. The album is also called Lindsey Stirling, so it's likely a debut album, but her fusion of classical violin with electronic, and, dub step, is nothing short of mesmerizing and inspirational. And when I looked through the rest of the songs, and heard the rest of the songs, I became an instant fan. Lindsey Stirling's music bears a lot of resemblance to the violin quartet Bond. So if you enjoy songs on this album like Shadows, Elements, Moon Trance, and Zi-Zi's Journey, you'll be a fan of Bond. I purchased the mp3 album of Lindsey Stirling, and am listening to it while I'm writing this review. It's very rare for me to find a song, let alone an album, that I like we'll enough to make time to write about, but I hope you'll give songs like Crystallize, Stars Align and Minimal Beat a chance. If you have similar taste in music, you'll download \\"Lindsey Stirling\\" yourself.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|I'm going to say that I loved Divergent, liked Insurgent and I'm still debating with Allegiant. WTH just happened here? Although, I enjoyed the descriptions and in depth explanations the story went too slow and I found myself skipping pages/paragraphs. I was highly disappointed in the use (or lack of) of the secondary characters and of course the too dramatic ending. I feel that from book 1 we all knew that this was a story of self sacrifice, values and how we all have bad and good qualities, so the ending was a bit too much. Yes, I wanted a happy ending...duh, if I didn't I wouldn't be reading a YA book!!! The ending felt like an attempt to inject reality in an fantasy story with the purpose of getting the self-sacrificing point across. Well, now back to the City of Heavenly fire countdown. ...don't know if I'll watch the move =/
1569242739|5.0|Not actually, but that is what it feels like.  Lent to a friend of a friend for their vegan to be lost and replaced with Babycakes. This is akin to replacing something you love with something you and everyone in your family and all of your friends loathe.<br />Guy Montag<br />We cannot give away Babycakes. The sad thing is that since it is a book it will not be burned.  Though I am certain that Guy Montag would assure me that the book has no value and Faber would agree.  So I am stuck with Babycakes.<br /><br />Vegan Cupcakes on the other hand, should be committed to memory.  It is a joy to read and the creations are delicious.  If you like cupcakes--period this is a must have for your collection.  Hands down the book that started a movement.  It is best until something better comes along.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Great book Stephen King had done it again.  I hope this becomes a movie as well.  Great great book.  Stephen King the master
B002T9H2ME|5.0|Moon is an outstanding movie. It's a movie about extreme loneliness and has some twists and turns that I guarentee you will not expect. Go into this movie blind. Please. It makes the experience all the better.<br /><br />Kevin Spacey as Gerty 3000, an AI computer, is the sole companion to Sam, a man who is tasked to stay on the moon for three years and provide energy to the earth by regulating the moon's energy harvest. It's a very dull job, and he can only communicate back to Earth with one way satellite messages. As his final two weeks of his term creep in, Sam starts to feel a large sense of paranoia as he slowly figures out there is something really wrong with this space station.<br /><br />For those who enjoyed 2001: A Space Odyssey, I would highly recommend this one. It's a very intelligent story and it keeps you guessing throughout. Sam Rockwell mostly runs a one man show here, and he does this extremely well. He is entertaining and energetic, but at the same time knows how to pull the audience's heart strings when a serious moment arises.<br /><br />Don't miss this one.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Way too addictive, fun and relaxing!!  Good fun, without a lot of thinking.  Nice to play after a stressful day at work!
B007X4ECLY|4.0|It's a pretty stupid movie actually but Guy Pierce is awesome as per usual.  Entertaining, not strictly &#34;good.&#34;  Enjoy your viewing experience.
B00ARHAAZ6|4.0|Another totally interesting story from Brandon Sanderson. His own unique take on &#34;superheroes&#34;. Mr. Sanderson seems to have boundless imagination for reimagining the traditional fantasy story.
B005CGI4EG|5.0|I bought it as a gift for my daughter for Christmas and I am so glad you had it offered. Thanks
B00BB8Q13A|2.0|Predicable.  Not the best acting and not an engaging story.  Very hard to warm up to most of the characters.
B008MM9630|5.0|Very fun. Wish they would give more crystals and not keep jumping the amount for more land. But very easy to use.
B003Y5HWJU|5.0|Love the show but ran into a bad DVD.<br /><br />Best gangster show since the Sopranos!<br /><br />Check all of your DVD's!
B00EMAGCJM|2.0|Controversy aside, Miley can actually sing and I liked her single wrecking ball. So I thought I would give the album a try and it was the most irritating thing to listen to. I felt like her voice didn't match the production. This album for a lot of people will be &#34;hit or miss&#34;<br />For me it was definitely a mess of an album.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I'm so happy that I can finally play Candy Crush on my Kindle instead of the lame generic game!!!! Thank you!!!!!!
B002SF9YNO|5.0|If you have not watch this great foriegn film it's a must see. It's heart warming,funny and makes you appreciate life.
B009YBTZ8O|5.0|I really like this book and read it for the nth time. Its full of fun and magic.  Its worth my time and my money.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|Cubistry is a great game.  I play it almost every day.  It has challenge, is fun, uses concentration, just for starters, and I challenge myself to see how fast I can clear the cube.  I thoroughly enjoy this game.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I couldn't put it down.  The characters and plot were well written, real , sometimes happy, somttimes not.  I would recommend it to anyone who loves a good story.  Wonderful book.
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|This app is so awesome I play it alot... its good to play when you you want make time fly
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|The husbands secret was a very captivating read. It's twists and turns kept me turning pages. With a surprisingly simple cast it kept up a very good pace. The intimate parts were portrayed tastefully and I thank the author for that. Very nice for a change. Read a d enjoy.
B00A6TYCNQ|4.0|Great game. It's the first paid game I buy for no kindle. And I having bought another one yet. The traffics on the kindle r great. It's a good role player an  u get to Lancelot.
1451695195|3.0|The book was motivating and encouraging but I felt it needed more description.  The description of the actual NDE experience seemed lacking.  Although he tried to weave it into the overall story it seemed to be just an aside to the overall story of what physically happened to the author, his life, his NDE, his renewed faith in the end but the actual description of what took place during his NDE seemed brief and matter of fact.  Maybe that is the reality of the NDE experience that it is not easy to place into writing what the actual experience is.  Overall it was a decent read but at the end I felt the actual NDE part was lacking descriptiveness.
B00ARHAAZ6|4.0|Not one of his best work, but in all consideration it's his first time trying a superhero novel.<br />I am definitely going to read the series through.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|First book I've read by John green and won't be my last. So sad, so good, so real. Cried, laughed, all more than once.
B004A8ZWWO|5.0|This is a really fun movie. Our whole family (teens and adults) enjoyed it. A few instances of crude humor not suitable for younger kids.
B005LLSNNE|5.0|The best series EVER!! ;)<br />I love the storylines in this show, often unpredictable and keeps me locked to the screen! Thank you for carrying this series!!
B00EXVZW6E|5.0|I've always liked hidden search and find the difference games as a means to sharpen my proofing and editing skills. It's a fun way to stay at the height of my game. However, I had tired of the genre with the added social gaming structure that defers progress until you unlock or add or build. This FAOTD brought the joy of the game back to me again. High quality graphics and quick zoom allow you to search every nook and cranny of the screen. 24 episodes and several game types give you a seemingly endless supply of searching fun to play again and again. Play against yourself to get your own highest score while getting lost in spooky landscapes and sharpen your mind in the process. There's even a kid's version, though I think you'd be hard pressed to share this one.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Love the game and am so happy it's on my Kindle Fire.  Just sometimes hard to stay hooked up to Facebook.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It's fun to play on the Kindle as well as on the PC Facebook link. It's just big enough on the Kindle to make it easy to play - any smaller though like on my IPhone & I would have issues trying to hit the right blocks.
B00EJYGL8S|5.0|The Piano Guys - \\"A Family Christmas\\" is such a wonderful instrumental to add to your christmas cd collection. It sets the mood for the holidays and most of all the album is GREAT! LOVE IT! NO REGRETS PURCHASING WHATSOEVER!
B00FIYGYKS|5.0|I am enjoying the new album and how the band's sound is evolving over time. It sounds really great. It Rocks!!!

1490313370|5.0|This book makes me happy to be alive. Sometimes I get a little bogged down in the daily routine of life. This book gives me a fresh perspective and excitement about the future may hold for me!
B00F91H15W|1.0|Didn't even finish watching it. That's says a lot considering I paid to watch it Found it hard to watch.
B001NLL93W|5.0|Love love love this book!!! Each one gets better- I can't get enough of The mortal instruments and I am loving all the characters- new and old!!
B007V9N5R8|5.0|I do a lot of Photoshop work and have always struggled with getting the color & contrast of the display to match what comes out of the printer and, more importantly, what comes back from the print services I use.  I put off purchasing a color calibrator thinking they were too expensive or complicated to maintain.  Well, ColorMunki Display and Passport Bundle has been the solution to my problems.  The display software and color calibrator is easy to install, runs in 'easy' mode with outstanding results and provides a perfect match (true color & contrast) between my display, local printer, and print services for big enlargements.  The Passport color calibration tool for your camera (a Canon EOS60 in my case) worked as advertised and has greatly simplified the task of getting true color balance in critical shoots.  If you shoot in raw and use Adobe Bridge, you'll like how this works for color balance.<br /><br />Wish I had purchased these sooner, especially the Munki Display.
B002JXK5VU|5.0|This is a very interesting premise and I am quite enjoying watching the whole series starting from the Pilot.  Love all the quirky people and the poor ordinary sheriff who is still able to solve problems with his mediocre IQ.  Fun show.
0670022411|5.0|Deborah Harkness is a gifted author who blends history and imagination into a fun read.  Her creativity and attention to detail transcend the witch/vampire genre.
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|Hands down this is the start of another great season of WD! Best show on TV. Thank You to AMC.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|I loved this book the experiments work<br />the writing was clear and easy to understand<br />I could not put it down I looked forward to reading it<br />I so enjoyed this book opens up the mind
B0089LOG02|5.0|I couldn't put this book down. Hands down it was one of the best books I've read. Hoping they make this book in to a movie.
B0089LOG02|5.0|Brilliant!  I never knew about the orphan train.<br />This book kept my total interest.<br />Great ending…. And a great read!
B009HQ9UHC|1.0|while this game looks like fun, there are way too many ads that are a drain on my web time. i will not be playing or recommending this game to anyone.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I enjoy this app it's a fun and easy way to waste time. My boyfriend and I enjoy laying on the couch playing together it's a fun time.
B00FXEL00W|5.0|I loved the characters and the way it was written. It was a great coming out story. I totally recommend it.
B0089LOG02|5.0|I visited the orphan train museum in Concordia (KS) several years ago, so I had some background knowledge of this period of time in our country's history, but this well-researched novel brought children of this era to life. I thoroughly enjoyed the novel and highly recommend it.JulY
B007WEQ3K8|4.0|This is a good game to make your brain work. The only issue I've found is that it will force close during sudoku. I'm using a Galaxy Nexus running Jelly Bean.
B008AIGWVA|5.0|I love Ben he's the life of ladies night. He answers the questions truthfully, and everyone laughs. Ben girl's night best friend
0143124544|5.0|This book made me cry in the best sense. I breezed through it on a plane ride from NY to LA and I'm so sad that it's over. It's sweet and emotional and now has a special place in my heart.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|The game keeps my attention. The graphics are good. So much fun! I have tried candy swipe and this is so much better.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|Okay people have to get over the fact that this book has a sad ending. Life isn't perfect, and I feel like this was kind of the author's point. I loved every book of this trilogy, and this one was no exception. It kept me turning the page (or swiping my finger, since I read it on a Kindle Fire) and was so well thought out and emotional, but not over the top. People, don't take it personally. Veronica Roth wrote this book this way on purpose and the ending makes sense if you understand the real theme of the trilogy. If you want to read a book that ends with rainbows and smiles, go write your own! If you loved the first two books, you will love this one too.
0762445262|5.0|I just received this item and i am very happy with it, yes it is a small toy but I did know that when I purchased it, no complains about that, fast delivery and very cool mini bat-signal to have on my desk
B003YL4LYI|1.0|I will not pay $12 for the kindle edition of volume 5 of the series. Are you kidding? I will borrow the hardback from a friend and deny you your grubby profit!
B00BAXFCPO|5.0|For a change, we have a book that is well researched and references provided. So much of what is written in the diet marketplace and even health in general seems anecdotal. A must read if you are dealing with another with Alzheimer's or have a family history. With no cure in sight, this is about as good as info gets
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Exceptional writing, great plot lines, what a way to live!  No foul language or innuendo, just good clean fun. Outstanding!
B00BBA6FOI|4.0|It's not perfectly written, and comes across as a bit self-centred at times, but this is a good book for any woman wanting a career and a family.  I think that she makes some very good points and some of the research she cites is very compelling.  Lean in.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Wow! All us Kindlers out there are in our GLORY!  We have finally got the big CCS game to enjoy. A big THANKS to Amazon.
B007EC27QM|4.0|A nice basic calculator with some nice features such as an extra row of buttons you can slide over to show. If you are looking for a scientific one though, look elsewhere.
B004X2M9VY|5.0|It is Who-mazing! The writing is unbelievably creative; the acting is superb; the production values are very high. Another great job by the BBC.
B00BPDR3F6|5.0|I could not put this down.  It takes you to another era and you feel as though you're living there. Wonderful characters and the historical information was amazing.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|In the beginning, it's pretty simple. As you move from level 3 to 4, the amt of tools you need to get out grows. You need one tool to make another tool work. A thinking game.
B007REV4YI|5.0|I was skeptical when they hired Daniel Craig to fill the role of James Bond. I still miss Brosnan but after 3 films Craig has made a believer out of me.
B007SVPZMW|5.0|It has been fun so far.  I haven't taken time to play the extras in this game because I enjoy playing the traditional tic tac toe. I would recommend this game to anyone that remembers the days when we would draw our own tic tac toe board and everyone who just wants a fun challenge.
0762439009|5.0|Revel in the slack! This kit is all strikes and no gutters. If you don't like it, you're out of your element!
