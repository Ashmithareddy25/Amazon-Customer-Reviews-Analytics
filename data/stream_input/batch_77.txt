B00WID0OEE|5|This squeegee is well made and works well on our shower glass
B00C5RBRA8|5|Great value, stores and holds compressed without any external device holding it.
B001A5SQJ6|5|Very nice quality sun shade
B004AIJ8S8|4|pretty easy install
B00OQS8GC6|4|Very good replacements.  Easy to install.  Vendor provides good installation support and how-to videos.
B00HSHW0VK|5|Very nice lights !
B00T8AA13O|5|I love this! You stick the decal where you want it, and then peel off the premask so it is just the letters! It looks amazing and fits me so well.
B00523AV54|5|These filters are great for my Rv to make sure not so clean water when camping does not get in pump
B004ZG7TT0|5|Just what I was looking for. Great price great look and fit, easy to put on and take off and when folded will fit back in the bag. O and it keeps ole Red my Goldwing 1800 Trike dry.
B000CFRL32|5|I was highly surprised by how well this radiator fit. Most multi-row radiators seem to have poor reviews due to fitment, but this one had absolutely no issues fitting.
B0076378FO|5|Very cute! Goes well with my other cat stickers on my car :)
B00CCIM1YQ|5|great
B0002SQUTU|5|I wouldn't want to do a brake job again without this tool. It does a really great job of spreading the caliper pistons back out so you can slip in new pads.<br /><br />The design could be a bit better. The black piece turns down into the caliper which is perfect, but the other piece comes out straight from the tool which is a little clunky but usable. 5 stars nonetheless. This tool made the job of changing pads/rotors on my 2006 Ford Expedition a pleasure.
B00NX1KMM4|2|Doesn't connect well with the stem.  I end up losing up to 3lbs of pressure before it finally connects.  Seems to be well made outside of this little quirk but overall I'm not happy with the purchase.
B000BGHYJS|5|Fit easily in my RV and fixes the small little drip that I used to get.
B007KC0KDS|3|They look great but are very difficult to keep on the wheels. I used 3M double sided wall hanger tape applied to the black foam pads on the wheel covers to stick them to the wheel. Use the ones that do not mark walls. It's the only to keep them from flying off while you are driving.
B005FL6M6A|5|Brakes work well on 2007 4Runner.
B00ELSIZIG|5|it's good stuff
B00PY1ZDYS|5|Got here early and looks great on my bike.
B001MP2RRG|5|It's a correct fit. Come with bulbs.
B001Q3AZGO|5|a+
B00TRS3NXW|5|Fast shipping,very nice item. Thanks!
B002MY6ZZG|5|a+
B00CS421CG|5|Love them, just unfortunate it doesn't have locks on them
B003D50K9A|5|worked just right
B0101A86FO|4|The product is great along with good support from the supplier. I originally had a problem with the product not coming off the backing paper and when I mentioned it to Advanced Product Design, they sent me another set of foil socket labels that were fine. I use my tools everyday and what a great benefit to me with old eyes. Thank you APD.
B000C9KKT0|5|I have replaced the multi port fuel injection 3 times with rebuilt units and had trouble with all of them and decided to try a brand new one this time.  So far it is working ok.
B001QUJBS0|5|This is my second shield, they work really well and fit the K3 perfectly - easy to get on and off the helmet. I like the fit on the helmet as it stay's open to various degrees and seals well. The visor is dark so no-one will see your face at all but they are not too dark to see perferctly fine in good light, probably not something you would want to ride around in at night though. I actually crashed my first one but it stood up well, it didn't crack or break off - just got scraped up and is still actually usable.
B0013FW7Y8|5|Since I was installing the multi port fuel injection, I installed the inlet and outlet fuel lines at the same time.
B00QRHDIPY|5|Awesome product, quick shipping*** ten stars***
B00DJSRSSM|5|Was good
B0040ZEFLG|1|Product does not fit the back windows.  The front fit but the adhesive tape is not the best.  One really hot day and they are loose and flapping in the wind.
B00B8B8BOW|5|The fit was perfect. Doing the job myself with my wife's help, as well as the low cost of your part saved me over $400 compared to an estimate I had from a shop.
B0041MCLHS|5|2004 Ford Focus ZX3 2.3l perfect fit.  I tried the lazy route and using an air wrench and one of those kits to pull the existing bearings (OE @ 200k) off while still attached to the car but I was not able to do so. So pulled the whole knuckle and took it to a shop to press out and press these in.  Made the subtle grinding noises quit, got rid of shimmy at 70 MPH, but didn't give me the better mileage I was hoping for - oh well the other things were worth it, anyway.  You might as well replace the sway bars and tie ends since you have to mess with them, too, and refresh the whole front end.  These have been on my car for a little over a month and are doing fine so far.
B000P16XHS|3|IT is ok for light work
B00KC85GXG|5|Perfect fit !!!!!<br />One happy daughter without sunvisor in face.
B004J9JLUS|4|works great on my trunk lid would buy again
B00XIGSDUW|4|Bought this for my 2015 Polaris Sportsman 1000 to try & cure my glowing hot exhaust problem,takes a little time & patience for the actual installation but tuning is simple,all said & done after some slight tweaking it cured my exhaust heat issue,no noticeable gain in power but worked for what I needed.
B005AM43TW|5|was very good
B000C9GNLE|5|Haven't installed yet but anticipate no issues based on purchase and installation and function of the other O2 sensor purchased at the same time.
B0085DXQSC|4|great
B00KQXKG46|5|Bright light that lights up the narrow road in the mountains. Used this on my Ranger and it is great. Works when running roads at night and will light up the area when I get to parking area.
B00UNYO2RU|5|Have it on my car now.
B000BUQODG|3|Little to No airflow.  Does help hot air escape and does keep the rain out.
B008OOMHLO|1|Sized Small
B001W0JOS6|5|Worked in my 2006 Trailblazer to clear the engine codes.  Haven't had any issues since.
B00VVFKOI6|1|They told me that it fit on the Honda Accord '04. It doesnt, I should've looked at the part first but yes, it did not fit.
B00MGSC2IW|5|Yes
B004Y9YJ0A|5|Just as the description says and shows
B008CQ8C8Q|4|fit good  sounds good
B0035JG0GQ|5|Was exactly what I wanted - thank you thank you thank you 😄😄😄
B00VURO2TC|1|The item I received was not what is pictured. The frame looked NOTHING like what is advertised. The letters were cheap stickers that weren't even in the same font as the &#34;Challenger&#34; logo (as pictured). I quickly returned the item a month ago and still haven't received my refund!!!!!
B00QBMBWNU|1|Junk!  The chrome plating is so thin in certain areas, the base material shows through.  In the trash!
B007TZBJI6|5|Very nice, as advertised therefore as expected. It is a high quality patch.
B00IJQOJ7M|5|Hasn't broken seal like plastic ones can't really tell if it runs cooler
B000WJGPF8|5|If you are looking for a stock turn signal this is a good one.  I believe this is for the right side (sitting on the bike).  You could use it for the left but you would have the bottom screw facing up.  My only downside to this was when I installed it the bulb blew out in the first 10 minutes of riding the bike.  I figured its been siting in a warehouse for a long time.  Thankfully I had a spare bulb.
B00O2AXTHK|4|Having a tough time getting them adjusted in the front.
B00GSAUHB8|5|Item as described, great value, and the seller shipped promptly.  This fit great in my SUV window.  This is an excellent sun shade and keeps my car cool in the southern sun!
B002ET692I|5|Fine as expected
B00G6WRLWQ|5|I get lots of compliments on this, it's super-cute!
B00A3UNYW8|5|Worked as advertised on 2015 GMC Sierra 2500HD
B00144CYIM|2|The squeegee worked good till the blade fell off in the lake now all I have is a very expansive pole and a squeegee handle with no blade.
B00020CB2S|5|love it
B00AT0YR3M|5|Just what I wanted :)
B001KS4CX2|5|Perfect fit
B00B76TMGY|2|Well the connector did not fit my current unit.  I had to modify it with new model
B008YFTB4E|5|Product works great on my 2003 Dodge Ram with the added purchase of the anti flicker resistors. Very simple installation.
B00Q3Q2JL8|4|Shipping was slow but liked what I received
B006WQSN46|5|corrected the problem
B009S30W9O|5|Exact item I needed, was easy to find and arrived exactly on the day mentioned when I ordered.  This door handle was extremely easy to install.  Thank You
B00FDUPVUG|1|worked for a couple of months, and it the lights went out
B005SB0JJS|5|Works great
B000CODTA2|3|So, I ordered this knowing that they would look good, and boy did they. They gave my truck a whole new look and it was awesome. I had planned on painting them red to match my truck, but decided not to. They still looked awesome. But being who I am, I like change on occasion. So, I decided to take them off. Well, was I surprised. First, let me start by saying that when you order these, they come with black rubber trimming to go around the part of the fender flares that make contact with the body to protect the paint. So, I thought I was in the clear from damaging the paint. Boy I was shocked, I had only had them on for about one year and where every fender flare was, there were lines where they had rubbed through the clear coat and down to the metal in some places. Another reason I thought this would not happen is because during the installation it was a very stressed fit meaning the wholes that the rivets go in are out a bit more than the actual holes on the fenders. So there is a lot of pressure forcing them onto the body, which is actually a good thing, because they won't move around as much from the vibration and bumps from the road etc. But what I've learned is no matter how good the product is made, it will always rub paint off if it's a similar application as this.
B004NPUNQO|1|Just unpacked these, don't buy them!  The bottles are alright, but certainly not worth 17.65 each... The sprayers were packed in a Ziploc bag, and the tubes were kinked up and taped to the sprayers.  They now have a permanent hard kink, actually two or three of them in each tube. Worse, they were clearly used before, they were all leaking out some kind of fluid.  I took a picture of the kinked tubing.  The pump action has a flimsy feel to it, and sputters probably because of the kinks.  I often reuse sprayers that come with a cleaning product, for free,  and the quality difference between those and these is not significant. Not $17.65 worth for sure.  I haven't made up my mind if I'm returning these but they definitely are low quality and way overpriced.
B00C4B1F7U|5|good trailer hitch easy to install
B00C0SQ8KG|5|Put it on my atv... Super bright and love it!
B00D1CQVIY|5|Exactly what I was looking for
B00M1O1JFI|5|EXECELENTE
B004BCJBKS|5|Great product.  They are working great.
B0024NSYWM|4|The pretty much fit and work well illuminating the road compared to the opaque lenses on the car previously.  Exactly what I was expecting.  Thanks
B001GKHKE2|5|Unit is exactly as pictured.<br />My research says it's exactly what I need for my wife's '08 Tribute.<br />I'm 74 and can't get around well, so I still have to get under the vehicle to install it, or get someone to do it for me.
B010VUZDC8|4|This is so cute on my car! So far it has held up through two car washes and almost 2k miles. When its clean and the sun shines on it, ooooh the sparkle. Love it!
B007ZDDUCK|5|Amazing product! Makes my expensive designer purse look like new again! My purse is in burgundy pink color, although it picks up a bit of the color off the leather, but I don't mind it as long as it cleanses the dirt and stain away without ruining the leather. Good buy.
B00M5OKSQ0|5|Bright and shiny as I expected.
B00IBG2C9W|4|Nice and sleek like I wanted. Super easy install great look. Would recommend this product.
B00K1PG4E0|5|Excellent product!!!
B008VL2PZS|5|Does the job, helped me hook up the rear LED's because they wouldn't reach the control box in the front of vehicle
B001879CUS|5|fast shipping great product, will defiantly come back shopping again....
B00945SINS|5|Perfect replacement for my belt sander, arrived prime fast.

B00LDNGSN6|5|Great spare
B000O0HOT6|5|fits just right
B00KSYUKFS|2|Not that good for curvy stuff. Too hard to work with.
B007ZGKKMA|5|Good
B00FYX2WEU|3|They are good but not fit perfectly for my 2011 Toyoya Camry LE.That's why I give 3 stars..
B000FUKQC2|5|Great looking plate. I First placed this plate on our car almost a year ago.  Today, nearly 17,000 miles later, it looks as good as new.  can't go wrong for the price.
B006H34BUY|4|Works very well. I was surprised. I would purchase it again.
B001DRJO3S|5|Perfect fit at a great price! This was for a 2007 Acura TL (non Type-S)
B001TNMWBM|2|Maybe I received a bad can, but it sprayed &#34;dusty&#34; with light coatings (as instructed on the can). When I tried to spray a thick coating, it filmed/hazed up and did not go away, even after it dried for days in a low humidity area.
B00U3CS4CQ|5|The order worked out better than I expected. Very satisfied.
B006RXYA7I|5|Great, heavy duty.
B000C8PC9O|1|I received this item on May 8th of 2015 and installed it same day.  Today, August 18, 2015 it failed during rush hour traffic on I285.  The cable pulled out of the connector that attaches to the throttle arm, leaving me with no throttle, other than utilizing the cruise control to accel/decel until I found a safe place to pull over.  I was able to make a temporary repair and didn't have to get towed.  The connector is crimped over the plastic sleeve and the cable simply pulled out of the connector/sleeve.  A very poor design to say the least.<br /><br />I don't even want to think of what could have happened had this failure occurred when crossing a busy intersection, etc.
B000H01NFY|5|this really work for street motorcycle is all ready 3 time I buy because is good
B001C9WTUC|5|My dad had it installed on his 2004 Impala, and the right front wheel has thus far continued to turn and has stayed securely fastened to the car.  Can't speak to the &#34;Professional Grade&#34; part, but for commuting and driving to the movies it's working just fine.
B00Z515O5K|5|Garry's has the best follow up of any company I have dealt with thus far!  Excellent product for the price and simple need. Excellent customer service. Give them a chance, you won't be sorry!
B000JLL01I|5|Great Product!
B003K1JSJ0|5|very good
B00K889FCI|5|works amazingly well
B007L2JNT4|5|This a cheap way to go to get extra vision on your sides. Have used them over the last year and they work great with little vibration. I traded my truck in and they also fit on my new 2014. The great thing is that they snap right on and can be removed just as fast.
B003ALQC3U|5|it worked great !!!
B007PP27KY|5|Love it
B001DR9VHW|5|The Best breaks!
B00SIOAT74|1|The rubber bands broke not even a month after i put them on (both side)...  I would love to get more rubber bands
B003UEABCA|4|Exact fit great price compare to other suppliers
B000TYVLF0|5|Fast delivery in great product. Happy customer here.
B000C9U126|5|1999 grand prix. Car is 15 years old so gasket on original cap dried out and I would get check engine light every once in a while. This fixed the problem and you can feel it sealing tighter than old cap.
B00ICV9QQS|5|As expected; just what I wanted.
B000F6F99G|5|I use this in my garage to position two vehicles accurately every time.  Easy installation.  Light stays on only about 30 seconds, which is adequate for parking purposes, but doesn't burn all day if you're walking in and out of your garage.  It is motion activated.
B000HAB9LM|5|This was great for a trip in which I used a soft luggage carrier on the roof of my SUV that only had side bars.  I used it across the front to act as a horizontal front bar.  Held tight and worked great.
B001DCJ3NO|5|Both fit very well..
B0066QWDUW|5|Cheap, and it works on my 750Li<br />beats the dealership price by a mile
B000C55MWE|5|works great!!!
B001NCHVK6|5|Used them once on an unexpectedly bad snowy road, and are excellent! SO much easier and better for vehicle than chains, and meet WA DOT approval for all the passes!!
B00L32KKMC|4|works great
B00CFRQQCM|5|Item arrived fast and secure. Though somewhat costly, a well made product that mounts a swing arm bag cleanly and solidly. A much better fit and look than using straps for mounting. Definitely the way to go!!
B009B6IN9E|5|Excellent look
B00HQZB4I4|4|Great product but there is one important item that you need to know when ordering that is not disclosed in the description! The product description needs to disclose that the interior trim piece (the &#34;garnish&#34;) is only 4.5&#34; in height and the corners are square, and some RV vent inserts require a 6&#34; height interior trim piece.  There ought to be an option for the customer to be able to order the correct size part they need for this product.  Here’s why:  I ordered this fan and received it very quickly. Unfortunately, the garnish didn't fit properly, as our previous vent interior trim piece is 6&#34; high and has rounded corners; the vent/fan part has squared corners, so our old trim wouldn't fit. I tried calling the number provided in their reference document shipped with the package to see if I could exchange the trim piece (with no success--on hold for at least 40 minutes). I had to leave a voice mail for a call back (which I didn't get).  I also went onto the Fan-tastic vent website and was able to leave an email asking about exchanging the part. I did get a reply to my email within 24 hours, but they were not able to ship a part because of the shipping costs; however, they directed me to another company to see about ordering the part.  I didn’t need to do that, though, because in the meantime, my husband fixed the problem by using our old 6&#34; interior trim piece and cutting down each corner so that squared portion of the vent/fan part allowed the garnish to be able to be inserted for a  tight installation (with a little caulking to cover up the cut portions). In the end, my husband saved the day and the fan/vent is great otherwise.  A better description in the product details and an option for the customer to purchase either a 4.5” or a 6” interior trim piece would earn this vent/fan a 5-star rating.
B00J58PP1C|2|not very shiney
B000CSW3SM|1|The one I received was used. I am guessing this is not a common issue.
B0002YR83Q|5|I bought the Schumacher SE-1010-2 Battery Charger specifically to use in an electrolysis set up I have for cleaning rusted metal antique engine parts.  Because it is Manual and not Automatic it is perfect for my needs. I have reduced my cleaning time by 50%.
B00YI3IGA6|5|My 7-yr-old really likes it because it covered the entire window!  Have replaced many different shades throughout his years. The suctions don't work for long & leave an ugly mark, the plastic hooks break off when my automatic windows go up, the cling ones didn't stick well, and the rectangle film which did work-- only covered part of the window. Putting it on is very simple and like a sock. I do tuck the edges in when I pull the shades over my Jetta window frames so that it is smooth and doesn't show the seam or very slight excess on top. Not sure how long the material will last, but so far it does a good job of blocking the sun. Now, if I can only find a solution for the driver side...
B000BZGCWY|5|Just like OEM. works good so far.
B000C7ZT3E|5|Did the job
B000E323F8|5|good
B009DJRX90|5|This was plug and play, very easy to install and came with a new circuit board and bulbs.
B003CXB77W|1|Fits 2006 MX5 miata PERFECTLY!  follow up to my initial feedback this cover is a piece of garbage! if you leave it on the car even over night you have a horrible clay like residue all over the vehicle that requires total hand washing and waxing to restore the shine. i will never ever purchase another item made by this company! trash!!!
B000C9Q6NY|5|Very well made for installation at front of drive shaft at the transmission yoke. Ball joint press is best tool for R/R.
B00MMJZP0M|5|Outstanding floor mats.  I literally spilled a growler of kombucha in my front seat the day after putting these in.  I simply lifted the mat out and dumped it on the side of the road.  The smell of the bucha lasted too long in my car, but that's my issue.  The mats worked great.
B002GU4SN2|5|The absolute best for your engines. I've used this for years and I swear by it
B00E16M1L0|5|Great battery so far, will it hold up for a minimum of 5years? Time will tell
B006N96KX8|5|Parts are exactly as described
B00RW7WBR4|5|These wipers are phenomenal! I love in Florida and we get a LOT of rain. If you've never driven through an afternoon thunderstorm in Florida, it can probably be best described as a wetter version of James Cameron's Titanic. These blades keep my windows completely clear and streak-free in the heaviest of storms. The blades themselves are high-quality and stand up well to the other Florida weather condition, absolutely stupid hot. With other lower-quality wiper blades, the sun can damage the rubber on the wipers. These have been in direct sunlight for weeks and look as good as new.<br /><br />Installation was really simple. The wipers come with a neon-colored plastic protector over the blades which slide off without much effort. If you don't remove it, you'll certainly look cool with your neon wipers but you probably won't be able to see very well when needed.<br /><br />Installed on a 2009 Nissan Altima
B000GZQOAE|5|worked great at a good price.
B00KAWGQD8|1|Has anyone used this with the 2015 Camaro fob?
B0028321V8|5|It looks like it came with the car from the factory.
B00098PO3G|5|I used this product on my interior pieces on my mk4 20th ae GTI. I ended removing the &#34;soft-touch&#34; that VW put all over the interior. After 10+ years it ends up getting sticky and peals off also in &#34;high traffic areas&#34; there were nicks and gouges in the  soft-touch.<br /><br />If your a mk4 owner you know what im talking about. I wont go through the DIY (found it on google/vwvortex) but after hours of scrubbn that soft-touch off every piece. This was the end result after using this product &#34;see photos&#34;<br /><br />The paint it self applied easily (the fan tip is a plus) Just take your time and apply even coats. Paint dried pretty quickly all in all im very happy with the end result
B003ANMNLI|5|Great product! 45 minute install is pushing the envelope pretty far though.
B00C3OCJF0|5|Good quality leather. Not nearly as stiff as other vests I've purchased when new.  The three swat style side straps are much more adjustable and comfortable than leather lace I've had in other vests.  High neck and normal size arm holes keeps wind (and chill) out. Lining is good quality.  Note that it comes with the side straps adjusted for a fairly trim man.  I'm not trim at all, so let the straps out a fair bit.  Plenty left to adjust differently if I desire in the future.
B00503KYF8|5|This review is for install on a 2008 Ram 1500 4x4 with 43K miles.  Glad I went the quick strut route as the rust on the top strut bolt would have prevented removing the spring to install on the new strut without a lot of effort. Quick strut install on the drivers side took about 2 hours (watch the you tube videos posted out there for reference and tips) the second side actually took 3 hours.  Yup, you guessed it, the lower bolt was frozen to the bushing. Many coats liquid wrench stuff and heating the bolt three times it finally gave way to the big sledge. This was harder than breaking the front rotors off my Expedition which ended up in three pieces. Back to the Ram - I left the nut on the end of the bolt for good surface to heat along with the bolt head on the other end.  Torching top down you won't melt your shaft boot.  Don't let the flame hit the bushing either just heat the bolt head and nut.  In the end, I had to grind down the end of the bolt to back the nut off as the hammer peened it over pretty good.  Anyhow, the truck rides like it was factory fresh once again.  Very happy with the product and put the Reflex shocks in the back.  The truck used to skip over half a lane anytime I hit washboard bumps - not any more. She sits about 1&#34; taller up front too.
B0002UEPI6|4|Great winch, my only dislike is the length of the handle. It's really long. Other then that, it has great pulling power.
B005C1Y9D6|5|Mine came with 15 LED's.  I haven't figured out where the last two go yet.  These made a huge difference.  Think of the difference between white incandescent & LED Christmas Lights.  It makes the inside of the vehicle look like new.  The value is great also, I highly recommend them.
B00CM4QY3O|5|Easy to wire up and bright enough for summer glare in San Diego.
B001TFE38A|5|I was hesitant at first but I went ahead and bought it when I tried it out, I was so happy with the product. It is everything I expected , easy to apply and easy to remove... Follow all the directions to achieve maximum protection. I really is the best of the best... After putting many hours detailing my cars I use Jet Seal to protect the finish product and the next time I clean my cars it just that much less I need to do. See it puts a protective layer between the finish of your car and the elements that last 8-12 months. So far premium results with this and all of the other CHEMOCAL GUYS products...
B005HJMX4U|1|The magnet strength is very weak. I doubt it will mange to stay on the car.
B00F1IP0P6|5|The decal is very high quality.  All the letters are free standing, meaning it's not one giant decal.  Each letter is separate.  The picture here is a little misleading as the decal is a little larger.  Application is very simple.
B000O1C47M|5|Works great, I use this in the HVAC trade (part time), it replaces a 40 year old pump that weighed about 55 pounds. I can normally reach under 500 microns in about one tenth the time of the old pump and without breaking the back lugging the old boat anchor around the job site.
B000VAW4XK|5|Direct fit for subaru outback..
B002935IV2|5|Worked just great
B0038AX6W8|5|These.  Are.  Awesome!  Made my Toyota look completely different.  New heavy lights with a little black plasti dip went a long way. I didn't trust myself to put them in but it was only $70 for a pro to put them in.  Worth it in every way.
B00E8CZAWY|1|USB first DOA.  Replacement failed within 6 months.  Excellent replacement service but second one failed outside replacement period.  Should have returned for refund but wanted to give the product a second chance due to great replacement service.<br />Additionally, the red LED is far too bright for night use.
B00FY81BUQ|4|fits ram 1500
B00QFY2BCK|5|Work great and we love it.  thanks seller
B00OZ5OIFE|5|Well made. Charges fast and consistently. Has a  small blue light so you know its on but it wont blind you in your car at night like so many other chargers. Very happy with this charger.
B00IPGBC80|5|Was the wrong size.
B0023001O0|4|Not a perfect fit for Yamaha Stryker but I bought some spacers and made it work nice :)
B00HZOCAJ8|1|The reare set fits perfectly  but the front ones (driver and passenger ) barley sticm to their place and i had to cut a little piece of the driver passenger mat because the clutch paddle kept stuck on it, iam not happy with this product , its very expensive compared  to any thing else and its disappointing to end up cutting a little piece.
B004O1YTLW|2|I wired correctly and tested with engine off and all works well, but when engine is running the flasher can't handle the higher voltage and does not flash (solid on). Solution was to add a resistor to knock down the voltage a bit, but shouldn't be necessary.
B00MG9D1G8|1|If you're looking at these piece of s*** clamps.... DO NOT BUY THEM!!!!! They advertise to fit a 1\\" bar and they DO NOT FIT. They're way too loose. I bought a 42\\" Creed light bar and mounted it on my brand new Yakima \\"Mega Warrior\\" cage that's on my 2012 Jeep Grand Cherokee  using these clamps (please keep in mind that I used FOUR of these clamps to mount this light bar... which should totally be able to hold a 10 pound light bar...). The second I drove down the road, the clamps immediately twisted and the light bar smashed into the roof of my Jeep. These clamps use rubber on the inside to grip whatever you're trying to attach them to... and the rubber absolutely does NOT work. This product comes with different rubber inserts to fit a 1-1.75\\" bar. I used the largest rubber inserts to fit my 1\\" bar to try and get a tight seal and no matter how tight you tighten the clamps, you can still move them around. To try and fix this problem, I tried inserting more thin, rubber grips inside of the clamp to try and get a tighter seal. I still could not get the clamps tight enough where they wouldn't move, and the rubber was holding onto the bar so tight that it was pushing out the sides of the clamps. I have spent HOURS trying everything to get these clamps to cooperate, and I would highly suggest running as far away as you can from purchasing these clamps. If 4 large clamps can't hold a 10 pound light bar, I think that there's a big problem with the product.
B00JSW6956|5|Love this upgrade sounds awesome when you get on its easy to install money well spent.
B00EKN8FXC|5|Nice light
B009KTAZF2|5|Love met standards protects my face from getting beat up by bugs on the bike and keep my face warm when it's cold
B006OQ35GU|5|Good price and product.
B003TODXQW|5|Such an awesome tool. This is a must for car audio installations. It allows you to do so much more as far as mounting locations go. It is worth the price and painfully easy to use! Thanks for Mark from CarAudioFabrication for using it so I could see how much I needed it.
B007PVHXMK|5|These worked great for my Toyota Highlander - I suppose I could've put them in myself but a quick $5 to my neighborhood mechanic saved me the trouble
B009B4CJJQ|5|Ordered 5 of these for my 2005 Chevy Trailblazer. They were installed on 8/15/15 and so far appear to work just as well as the one I purchased from a local auto parts store, however, these are a fraction of the price! With the two day shipping, I was able to get these in the same amount of time it would have taken the local store to get the quantity I needed! Will post an update if any problems are encountered!<br />Update 2/4/17- Still no issues with the coils.
B00K35F5XO|5|GREAT
B000HNAA8W|5|works like it should
B000VKRQBA|5|Item received as described, thanks.
B002ZS4QCS|5|Great for backpacks when you take kids to school. They will not leave next to them or on the floor of the vehicle. It is right up in there face.
B001G8AIMU|5|Works Great
B00QVODY1G|4|This was a good kit for the price.  The only negatives I found was that where the wires come out of the plug the lengths are a little uneven which makes for kind of a sloppy appearing installation.  The lights themselves are fine the wiring feels a little cheap., but I think I got what I paid for.
B000C841GO|1|Does NOT fit 2006 Impreza 2.5i, the barb is too large.
B011QXQ8D2|4|You can really get creative with these cool lights. Well worth the price, I just wish they had a template for cutting the hole you will need to make to mount them. I already ordered more for other projects vehicles.
B00BUPSE52|5|Very cute product. Arrived on time and is exactly as described. I haven't put this product to use yet but looks great in packaging.
B007XE8C74|5|good
B000C2EFMU|5|Have them installed now and it is almost a year has passed. No issue at all.
B00SH1SN6C|5|Good product, shipping fash, great seller, will buy more in future
B00J4TW2SQ|1|Nothing but problems since i got it, now it wont even start. I got it and the parts would not even match to put it together, now im having problems with the battery and a short or something, it diesnt stay charged, or now it doesnt start
B00480J4JG|5|These Hid bulbs are the best, they work very well. I believe they are the OEM Hids for most cars they fit into. I recommend them for the Acura TSX 04, and 05, maybe even 06 as well.
B00497YB1E|5|Direct replacement for my '98 Legacy with a 2.2, no leaks
B00WBF8VY4|5|Great light
B000Q753B8|2|Keeps items cool for a few hours i had to buy reusable ice cubes to help with the cooling factor. Also the bag oulls away from the cooling unit it appears to be a defect in the manufacturing process that they eyelets are not getting punched correctly and the cooling unit fell out on me after 4 days of use. I do carry it to work daily and use it to keep my food and drinks cool. Maybe it was not intended for that use. Currently looking for a better quality one.
B001KO84I0|5|Handy little tool to tigheten up loose valve stems on your bike and other items.  This seems solid and well made, no issues using it.
B00TDMZB00|2|Light output is less than OE standard bulbs but OE bulbs were destroyed in removing them from housing, so I decided to keep these.
B00757IGYS|5|Fit and look better on my Sienna 2012 XLE AWD
B0077HE8PM|5|My 2007 Sienna rear hatch had started to not be able to remain open on it's own. This was easily fixed by propping it open with a broom handle, but this didn't seem like a good long term fix. I checked around and everyone was saying this would cost over 600 dollars to have a dealer install. So i decided to try and tackle it myself. This was so easy to install. The broom handle did some in handy to hold door open while i installed the two struts by myself. All i needed was a small screw driver.
B003S59WBW|5|This has all that you need for replacing the intake manifold. The price on here is cheaper by a significant amount than any brick and mortar store in our area, for the same exact kit. Worth the little bit extra if you're going to be tearing into the vehicle anyway, may as well replace and maintain all you can so you don't have to do it twice.
B000CAVDHC|1|This is not for a 94 Previa SC
B00KAWGQDI|5|It fit well and my wife likes the color.  What more can you ask?
B00WPW6BAE|4|It works fine under iOS using wifi.  Was able to disable an annoying reverse beep with this gadget and an an app.<br /><br />It is small and not at all in the way of drivers legs and invisible behind the dash.  I just wish it had a power button so I didn't have to unplug it all the time.<br /><br />Using this device kills cellular data which is why I will use a Bluetooth low energy (low energy only for iPhone) long term.
B000MDB6NK|5|👍👍
B00UNTU3VO|5|OK shipping time / Good Quality item / I like it.
B007R4UCW8|1|Cheap, Cheap, Cheap...Did I mention &#34;CHEAP&#34;?
B004P9L4UC|4|I've had these on my 2002 4Runner along with the OME 60028 rear shocks and OME 2881 front coil and 90004 shock for about 2 years and they have not disappointed. My 4Runner has custom steel plate front and rear bumpers with a tire carrier and these handle the added weight perfectly. Body roll is almost non-existent and overall handling has greatly improved compared to the stock suspension. My only complaint is the rough ride and bumpiness at slow speeds in town, but that's expected with a firm suspension that gives a 2&#34; lift all around.  No issues at highway speeds.
B00R09TFBO|4|Nice print love the tin but the color on print could be a little darker only reason is not a 5 star
B000AOMQ80|5|Fantastic price.
B000IZ4OQ8|1|Junk did not fit
B006N97YCE|5|Got rid of famous clunking sound and general slopp on my 2004 Ford Focus ZX3.  If your Ford makes clunking sounds on bumps, this will likely fix it.
B001DRI5LA|5|2 minutes to install. Super easy, didn't need the dealership to do this for me at a 500% mark up.
B000ONZXPK|5|right item for the price,work as described.
B013TM6LWG|5|The quality of these are wonderful, especially for the price! The shipping is excellent as well!
B000IYIW4E|5|I previously bought another cheaper aftermarket brand and was unimpressed with the hard, inflexible GPT wire that was connected to it.<br />This one is expensive, but comes with very nice wire and even includes butt connectors and Raychem branded heat shrink. Good quality stuff here. You get what you pay for.
B00HJ6O4A0|5|great
B004ZF3ALM|5|I ABSOLUTELY LOVE MY NEW LIGHTS. IT WAS EXACTLY AS DESCRIBED. JUST NEED THE HIGH BEAMS NOW!
B00F3J2FW4|5|great mats!!
B000CNJAMO|5|nice
B002PQQD30|5|Worked just like they said they would. Easy install. No issues thus far.
B005BNP7YU|4|Very cool.  Plastic but lights up nicely. You'll have to do some running of the wire to hide it from the rear.
B00FI7U1UY|3|Looks ok...... Not an exact fit....
B00381OTZA|5|Love it you can definitely feel the throttle response change
B004I12F0A|5|Great quality. Went on nicely
B00J3JIHI6|5|Perfect fit and saved me $262.00 of local Ford dealership parts department.
B003Z9WMWC|3|Installed on my 2013 Toyota Tundra Crewmax 5.5 bed, sticks out a bit towards the back tailgate of the truck. Does not fit the contour of tailgate, very flat edged while the truck has a slight curve, seems to me it was made to fit the 2014 and newer Tundra Crewmax not the 2013 and older like the description states. Besides this the quality and mounting system is good.
B00QK40ZSM|1|These wiper blades did not fit my 2007 Mercury montego which I thought would work for me I felt betrayed buying this piece of crap
B005BWI9SC|5|A+ Great sale, Great and Fast shipping
B002W1OXW6|5|Awesome polish
B0048J2OFS|5|It's good! Arrived quickly. Works fine.
B00AC6SAZE|1|No it did not  The headset  will pick up the call but no one can hear  you most of the time..... You have to call them back and it will  work then..... When picking up calls  most of the time it will drop the call. and has to be repaired a lot.... Bought another brand and it worked great to this time.....
B000COTXEI|5|Great product, siphon works very well and the output stream is strong.  I used it on my engine with purple power and it came out clean.
B000HBGH3G|5|The delivery was fast but I ended up not being able to find it when installing my brakes.  I don't know if this stuff works or not because when I did find it, it was smashed under some tools and leaking all over the place.
B005NLQAHS|5|This OBDII bluetooth adapter works exactly as described.  I've even left it plugged in with the vehicles off with no noticeable drain on the vehicle battery.  Works well with the Torque Pro app.
B00HPANLVS|5|Colorful and good size for a 21' Trophy
B004TB3QAC|5|Great product and a great price
B00UXO1OTO|5|Work perfect
B001EP0GMW|5|Yes it fit perfectly. Accept my 2&#34; recovery is sloppy.  In it. The wire harnes. Worked. Great
B00C30727O|5|Awesome grips, quality material, look killer on my harley 883 low
B000EDUUJ4|5|Worked as described
B00686K9PG|5|Pretty nice shift knob. Looks good feels good. Shopping was a bit slow tho.
B0002M6ZBY|5|works great,would buy again.gauges installed in dirt sprint car
B005JPJMI2|5|great stuff...use a microfiber towel and apply on final drying and it makes things a lot easier and leaves a nice spotless shine...almost like a good wax n buff...not bad at all !!! this is the SECRET to a detailers tricks!
B00QN95LTW|5|Perfect
B00192QB3I|5|great buy
B006JXSTC8|5|Great quality
B000RNW5NK|5|Fit perfectly and only took 10 minutes to install. Looks good and not bulky.
B00UZOGEQU|5|Great job
B0002CSQ70|5|i bought these to replace the same ones that were timeworn. they are perfect, and make lots of people smile too.
B0009JKGJW|5|My introduction to Marvel Mystery Oil came about in the 1960's.  My mother's Ford Galaxy 500 developed noisy valves and rough idle.  My mom was worried something major was wrong with the engine.  I took it to the dealership for her but the head mechanic (we called them &#34;mechanics&#34; back in the 60's, not &#34;technicians&#34;) told me to buy a bottle of MMO and give it a try.  He said he could repair the engine but it would be costly and he thought MMO would do the same thing for a couple of bucks.  I did as he said and the engine smoothed out and quieted down almost immediately.  I've been a believer ever since.<br /><br />My current vehicle is a diesel Ram 3500.  I add a few ounces of MMO and Power Service Diesel Kleen every time I fill up.  The truck is over 10 years old now and runs perfectly.  I also noticed an improvement in mileage when I started using my additive cocktail.<br /><br />It may not cure the common cold or make you head of the class but this stuff does a pretty good job of cleaning the engine and fuel system of vehicles.
B00B2AFVRY|1|Had a shop installing a SYE on my jeep and purchased this to replace my old skid. I have a rough country long arm and it won't bolt up. Not sure why but it's a no go.
B00CMP3Z1C|4|Very handy.  Have not needed to use.  Keep for emergency
B00801RJXC|5|Got it as seller promised and this is a GREAT deal, now my 1995 camry drives like brand new!!!!
B000B68V6I|5|Great!
B00G620ZVU|4|Very bright for the size and well built.
B00HFNEUZG|5|these came very fast and were as expected
B00UZE8878|5|Delivered amazing shine on both of my cats and absolutely loved it for our large motohome. ..cleans fast leaving a perfect high shine.
B001JT0CRC|5|Like other Surf City Garage products, this works well.
B00BDEP5ZM|5|Works best yet!
B002CNK62K|5|Very nice
B00EP499CC|5|Great quality bulbs
B00UXX245I|4|Pros: Cover seats well with only small areas where dirt can still get in (seat belts). For my daughter who thought the fabric seats were too &#34;scratchy&#34; these are softer and add a little more cushion.<br /><br />Cons: While these are relatively simple to install, small fingers are a big plus, as is attempting installation when you're not rushed. One under seat tie broke off during installation, but it wasn't crucial,  and one zipper split but was repairable (not sure how well it will hold up). Stronger zippers would be nice. And I actually wish the covers were a little more snug.
B001RVEJSU|5|good product worked as advertised fast shipping
B002OIFB7S|4|works as expected
B00B22OI3A|5|Excellent quality!  Great price, tons of room.
B00SSCXZ5O|5|Makes the car look brand new. Very high quality.
B007FMTTFS|5|High quality, half of what the dealer wanted, easy install, just unbolt , replace and done. Stopped my ABS light, and jerking when braking, on my 2008 Nissan Xterra, Highly recommend, it's been 2 months, and a few hundred miles and no problems.
B006B2YI6S|5|Best shade I've ever bought-fit is perfect.
B00CNEQZHS|5|Fit and works perfectly.
B00M75LOPG|5|The Car was new to me,2002 (my Son) Got a check Engine light ,and found #2 Cyc. was intermittent. Old coils looked 100% But swapped out all 6 . Gas Millage and performance was  Better Than Ever, And no light after 1200 miles to date....Easy to change and worth the time and effort,and Money.
B0002NYDZI|5|Just what I was looking for.  I had a mini grease gun that was a pain.  I use this on my lawn tractor and it works great.  Seems prety sturdy too.  Should last forever.
B008G1Z3J8|5|Nice taillights- look oem
B004WMF8SG|4|Fit fine .. just find a YouTube video to fully explain the install.  One of the mounting points was cracked but NOT badly enough to impair the installation.  Otherwise I would have rated five-star.  Great light projection.  Unfortunately the right side did NOT survive the stealth &#34;deer attack&#34; that got the grille and parking light as well.
8900700138|5|Great value!
B00M3ENQXE|5|Worked great! No problems at all.
B009Z1QVYE|5|Worked great. Fittings worked for me and my turbo leak stopped. Received package timely too.
B000C5FYMC|5|they fit perfict and work very good
B00KIF58I6|4|This item is good, i use it a lot on my security partol car, i like the light and how much it shin out for others to see position. It is not bright, yet very visible to others, even in day time, very bright at night, easy to setup and easy to clean.<br /><br />Bad part is that the item does not work on every car, it is design for certain dash car, nor hanging on the window with suction cups, the metal that bent to which ever position need to be replace, it does not look good when the flash bleeds back into the patrol car while in use, it get hot when turn on less than 2 minutes. It would be good if there more flash style for it and has three LED section and not two.
B000GAS2WW|2|Sent it back.
B003L0AO20|5|Replacement piece.
B006B27UGI|5|I bought these brake pads for my '07 BMW G650 XChallenge, and am very pleased with them.  They grab much better than the OEM ones.  I just put them on yesterday, so don't know about longevity.  But they seem to be of very high quality. No brake squeel so far, they have been perfectly quiet. Install took 5 minutes.
B006MX8196|2|I bought these seat covers for my 2006 Frod F-150 truck and they DO NOT fit well at all!!!
B001V8U12M|5|great price, does the job so far. Another item we have several of (just in case)
B00DE2EFOS|5|As expected
B00Y171URU|4|Difficult to install because heat sink doesn't come all the way off and then you have aim bulbs correctly, they can be turned the wrong way. The bright white light is worth the hassle and the price was great.
B00C7ND744|4|Bumper was as promised! Beautiful finish, exact fit, high quality and worth the money. The bad: The shipment was lost and took 3 times longer then estimated. The bumper is heavy and requires additional packaging as mine arrived beat up! Holes in the box, falling apart which resulted in damage to the finish on the brand new bumper. Im also disappointed no chain hook up points. I had to buy some additional hardware from the local store to fabricate some anchor points for the chains.
B00EECM5FI|5|When my xenon lights needed replacement, I couldn't justify the price of the OEM bulbs and took a chance on the Kensun 6000k.  They were packaged very securely, fit perfectly in a Saab 9-3 Aero, and are much brighter than the somewhat aged bulbs they replaced.  Will the Kensun last as long as the more expensive alternatives?  I hope so, but so far they are everything I hoped for when ordering.
B000S31LVG|5|Fit my 2013 Expedition EL perfectly.  Easy to install in a few minutes.
B0065KKXL0|5|This makes applying decals to an RV an easy task. If you are tackling a decal application project this is a must.
B004GEWMFC|5|Fits great.
B00C3OCQ7Q|5|The smell, the feel, the weight says it all. No complaints
B0082365AQ|3|Tires do not hold air well
B001S2TQ0O|5|Exact fit works great
B009B6IQHS|4|Mine didn't come with the adapters ... Looked like someone took it out from the box
B0009JB7GI|5|Good
B00DMWF666|5|Was a gift , he loved it
B00UEMH5L6|3|Peel and stick not the easiest to install if your grill is plastic, plus I'm surprised that they have not blown off in the hydro spray
B00L841DG2|3|Great lights but they are not fog, they are black, be cautious when buying
B000HHGOOM|4|It does exactly what it is supposed to do.  I have two such tools now, this flexible model and a ridged one.  I don't need either one all the time, but nothing else serves as well when I do.
B005TA07Q8|5|Cute as a button! Great size, looks good on the window.
B00G1Y285Y|3|Looks great with these blue levers
B0000AXY62|5|Easy to use. Just used once so far but seems to secure my bike rack very well.
B0061XFPPA|5|One of the best work lights yet for the money
B0085KGOIE|5|great price
B000CEQGA2|5|it was exactly what I wanted
B005J43I56|4|Fit my 2013 Moto Guzzi Stelvio perfectly with the shortest screw that came with it. I feel like the ball and the shaft the ball is on are kinda cheap. Almost plastic-y. But it fit on there well and it seems pretty snug. It's a great system.
B005CW9LGU|5|IT WORKED PERFECTLY AND WAS SHIPPED QUICKLY.
B003YMRNV0|5|Exactly what I needed at the most amazing price around. Perfect fit on my 2002 Tundra SR5.
B00MN9AKGA|3|Had bought this to add a fun look to the garage where I park my XFR. (Would never consider drilling into my XFR's door the way they're marketed) But the image is disappointingly blurry. I doubt I'll ever use them.
B00VGL6XKI|5|This seems to be a well-made mount.  It certainly makes it easier to switch from one size ball to another.
B004ZF35O4|5|This conversion kit is great. The choices of bulb colors (in Kelvin) and the choices of bulb types made it very nice when ordering. They were easy to install, and if in doubt the direction book provided is very helpful.I replaced my HID's from 2004 with this new Kensun set. The only additional item I recommend to get is the Kensun &#34;Computer Warning Canceller & Anti Flicker&#34; units. They come in a pair. One for each bulb. Even the case that they are shipped in is nice.  I store the bulbs that I took out in them.
B00QQTR2E6|5|Worked great!
B00CYSKL1E|5|Perfect and easy to install.  Thanks for saving me $200 over the dealer putting these four stickers on my car.
B002NEUOGG|3|It works good but on the 3rd or 4th use, one of the pins broke loose and shot out during the tire deflation
B000GU7GN8|5|What can you say...it fills the gap.  From the factory Harley left an exposed area between the heat shields that over time became quite ugly.  Kuryakyn's 9196 Heat Shield bridges that gap with a quality piece of chrome that matches and solves the problem affordably.
B000W0RQ8C|2|The product works fine but like most other folks with toyotas have said IT DOESNT FIT....2014 tacoma NO...2013 tundra NO...dont buy this is you have a toyota!!!
B001AQZI64|2|I got this for my camper, tested it when I got it worked ok, used one more time, worked fine. Used once more almost 1 year later worked, pulled out of outlet metal spring clip on one side fell out broken in 2 pieces. more dead Chinese garbage.
B0035RZ280|3|works good
B000630D62|5|Better than the plastic lens
B00139FQSS|4|Haven't had a chance to test it in the lab yet, but build quality feels good.
B00651CBO6|5|Looks and performs GREAT!
B00TW267MW|5|Great little pocket screwdriver set with different size bits for flat and phillips screws.  I got it to carry in my camera bag not only for eye glasses, but also to use to tighten screws in my camera gear.
B004981TRM|4|PERFECT
B009AQS40S|5|I got this to go along with a reflective border.  I honestly didn't expect these to be overly refelective (as they are small caps), but I was really surprised.  These are as good as bike or vehicle reflectors.  I've had them on for about 3 months now.  I purchased two packs, because I expected that a few ends would ultimately fall off.  I haven't lost any so far, so the spares are just sitting in a hidden nook inside my trunk.  They fit over any existing bolts or screws, but don't come with any.  For what I wanted, they look great!<br />Update:  It's almost 2 years later.  They are still attached, and I haven't lost any to carwashes.  I actually bought two sets so I'd have some spares, and I haven't needed them. When people have their headlights on behind us, they think we have LED lighting.
B003JSO1X2|4|Easy installation and working well
B00OAJO6E8|5|good
B00F2OOI52|3|The high pressure hose holding pressure after a few times of use.
B00MVN6WLU|5|works fine very good like
B00D3298A0|5|Happy, Happy Thanks A+++++++
B000GTY6A0|5|Secure, timely delivery. Excellent, well made product that fits and looks great! A++!!
B011VNB75Q|5|Fantastic handy bar! This has a nice rubberized grip and can be oriented either sideways or straight out to the road, whichever meets your needs. I use this to exit the vehicle on the passenger side and push away as to not crush my phone on the hip. The only handy bar that's priced right and free shipping as well. While it includes no light or seatbelt cutter, it's hunky metal end could easily break a window in an emergency.  A solid purchase for those that require good leverage when exiting a vehicle. A real buy!
B00KTI0D96|1|I have had this product for a few months, they worked great at first and slowly started having issues. I thought maybe the battery was dying so I attempted to change and found the metal connection that connects the battery was broken off. I switched to the second fob and it worked for about a month and then the same thing happened, I opened it up and the metal piece is broken off. I currently have both fobs with the piece taped in place to work.  My truck is now reading the replacement fobs as either a &#34;damaged key&#34; or &#34;wrong key&#34; I have received both errors. I have attempted contact with the company, but have received no response.
B00JDEPGWQ|5|Están muy bien :-)
B005C1Y9D6|5|Great! Simple lights to install, had all the pieces - front overhead lights, mid overhead lights, back overhead lights, even the two trunk hatch lights as well as all four door lights AND had two extra for the license plate lights. SUPER bright, have had others comment on what a difference it makes, and they add a modern look to the car!
B00AWE0FPE|5|the best of the best very good product, I really recommendit!!!
B007KOSOZ2|2|I ordered the front lift stand and received the rear lift stand instead... Very un satisfied :-(
B00EI6CKVE|4|A lot of fun, but challenging to apply properly because of all the small details. Make sure you let it dry fully before peeling off the backing and you should be fine. My wife loves it!
B00DBEMVMM|4|ok
B003PB9S8G|5|Great fan! The left fan was pulling just over 30 amps on startup and had to switch to a 35-40Amp fuse. Keeps my 7MGTE powered rock crawler cool on the hottest days.
B008HR6J0S|5|I love it! Works perfect. Easy instructions. Had read a couple reviews that made it sound complicated to program but was very easy.
B00C7I4XQ0|3|Very small- about 2&#34; long all together. I must not have looked at the size when purchasing. I was looking for something small, but not this small. Looks like it would be great for backpacking.
B00DNX6GT0|1|Doesn't play the entire tune and not very loud. You can hear it if your going under 30 but can't hear it faster than that - was hoping to be heard on the freeway - disappointed.
B00MH5RERI|5|Delivery was prompt.  The rabbit air fresheners look cute and smell nice in the car.
B00JN0U4SQ|4|Looks kind of cheap but looks decent from far away
B00123496A|4|I Loved watching Rugrats growing up so I was looking for a decal for my car and this sticker/decal popped up. It was the only Rugrats anything I found on Amazon so I bought it. It is a sticker not a decal that description is misleading a little. I think if you live in rainy areas you'd be best just sticking it on your laptop or something else because it seems like it will fade pretty quickly. Other than that I think it is an awesome way to celebrate growing up in the 90's.
B00SBRTX0W|5|I've owned my 2001 S10 since 2002 and have replaced this 3rd door handle at least 5 times with the original GM all plastic part and each time they broke.  The last one took a little more than 4 years to snap.  This new unit seems to have corrected the flaw by changing the pull handle to metal.  It looks like the original part, color and texture are correct.  The snaps that connect to the rods are a little larger but are made better.  Time will be the test but so far so good.
B011K35YAQ|3|THE PRICE WAS RIGHT,BUT THE NEEDLE AND SEAT WERE INOPERATIVE!
B001AWDX92|5|Genuine Yuasa quality.  Works great, just like the original that came in my motorcycle from the factory.
B000C9JAGE|5|Delivered new and works perfectly
B0031HCOEY|1|Please be careful. I bought this alternator April 18th. 3 months later I lost my new $200 optima battery<br />This alternator overcharged and my battery exploded Acid was everywhere.<br />Warranty was only 30 days. They gave me credit, Thank You but I am very mad because this is not right<br />what they sell. This alternator cost me my battery,towing my time cleaning engine. NEVER EVER!!!!!!<br />People please buy only NEW original stuff,
B00BQE5IKG|5|These things are so Cool! They work great on a 12v system. Stick to almost anything besides rust and grime. All 4 Looked great underneath my little truck! Just be careful not to zip-tie them too tight! I broke one by zip tying them on my motorcycle right near one of its little circuits and I heard it Crack inside and it stopped working. However the other Three work fantastic and really bright! One is stuck by the 3M backing underneath my rear fender well after cleaning it with alcohol, and its still there!! SO they work great if you yourself do not damage them hahahah
B00NNGJHI4|4|Is good light.i not have two contac.
B001AIZ5HY|4|works great.<br />Probably, the gritty pad need 2nd one.<br />Best to buy an extra sheet at local home depot, in case you need to do more than 2 headlights.<br /><br />It does take some time.<br />Make sure to tape off the area before working.<br />Mask would be helpful, as you can breath in some of the dusk.
B00KQXKG46|4|Its good for what I needed
B00GR8IAWO|5|I was very satisfied when I got my key chain.
B007Y0N3L2|4|Nice quality ramps, have used several times with good results.  the length makes transporting more difficult than folding ramps, but they are rock solid - worth the trade off for me.
B01127IGU0|4|works as advertised good value.
B004PL6NVA|5|Looks great!
B00CYLETLY|5|Wonderful
B00G6KGPFM|4|Works great
B00JWZJSQ6|5|Just as expected.
B00CZEZNGU|5|I bought this unit to illuminate my command center during a power outage. The current draw is only 300 mA with both lights switched on. I will be getting several more of these.
B000BGJWA2|5|A plus perfit and better than anyother hinge is strong strong.......
B003FYKF9Y|4|Improved gas mileage from 12.9 to 14.2 so well worth it quick install.
B00J8QIFDG|5|It came quick, priced right, no issues
B00NQCPD9W|5|switch feels good, and when it is lit it looks good. Thanks.
B001RBCU90|5|Adorable. I love it. Perfect size. It is white and clear, not white and black.
B00C8084OY|5|Looks great, fits nice, can't complain
B007JMTS14|4|Just what I was looking for.
B001DVY060|4|Pretty cool stuff even made my charger have a super charger noise wen you step on it not pretty sure it woke up the beast as well easy installation
B00KTIR1V4|1|I bought two of these about a year ago and was initially very happy.  They are an outstanding savings.  Then - one broke - well the base cracked and it would not stay together.  That happened when I was at a drive in movie theater.  Then about 4 months later the other one bork as well - that one the metal key actually became separated from the plastic body.  So I went on line and bought a refurbished key.
B00NW7RA10|5|Great product if you can wait about three weeks for product to arrive.
B004MZXZHO|5|Parts came ahead of time and work just fine. Would buy again.
B00O4ILZ6M|1|do yourself a favor and don't buy. it has very cheep adhesive on the back
B00Q34CQ8G|5|I love it goes really good with my car
B0040CVTE0|5|Fit perfectly
B00MB0EXGE|4|Love it !  I have had for a few months and it's still looks like new.
B00JIDY4R0|1|Extremely small for the price...
B00QUHVCTU|5|Great for the price. It is not extremely sporty, just right for my sport tourer. It is in the right form the does not make my hand cramp.<br /><br />Plenty of protection :)
B0049HCWEC|5|Very pleased with this purchase and associated services for delivery.  Thank you.
B00XM7JEGO|3|They are ok
B00UCNCSJ6|5|Great product.
B00RPGWE9C|5|way better then factory mats
B0066REBME|3|After few weeks of using this part I have to change my opinion. Part had a factory defect, but after mail conversation with URO Parts they checked that other hoses in warehouse were OK. Amazon refunded money, so maybe it was just bad luck...
B0027V59FG|5|A++++++
B008OOSRAO|2|Very well packaged and delivered fast. Top broke off the very next time I was removing it. Will not buy again.
B000BRCKAU|5|great value for the price
B008IYHFD0|5|Easy-to-use! Just plain simple
B00KGZ25KW|5|Great deal, installed easy and work great.
B00NPKEOZY|2|Does not keep the heat out
B005BHEMWE|4|Tiny but good. Great for small places, not TONS of light, but well worth the price. I will buy more when I find another place for them.
B0027I88VQ|5|GREAT PRODUCT
B004PHR7TG|5|Take your time installing these. Start with a clean surface and start with the smallest towards the front of the car and ending with the longest at the rear. They are labeled according to which side that they go on  1-2-3 and A-B-C. A section of painter tape on the top helps keep them straight since the bottom line is what gets longer. Remember, when the adhesive back touches the car, you can't remove it without damaging it or the paint! So slow and easy does the trick! If you look at the pictures that they have here you will see what they look like when you don't put them in the correct sequence. ALL  numbers on one side, and ALL letters on the other. Don't mix together   or it won't look good!
B00HJ6O4A0|3|Like it
B00UIDJ942|5|Perfect replace ment for  my 1999  xp.
B00XEXJ9Z2|5|Fits nicely. Like it better because it's not plastic.
B00JBQQZMQ|3|The resivoir fit perfectly, however the pump did not work.  Luckily, my old pump was still working.  Apparently other reviewers are experiencing the same thing.
B00EA0ZB7I|5|Awesome product
B000C5I4ME|5|Note that this piece was a perfect fit for my 4 cylider valve cover hose and it is listed only for the 6 cylinder.
B00SM2JWZW|5|worked great
B001SHJL22|5|Good stuff, Maynard
B005FK4CDG|5|Installation is as easy as any other brake job. Fantastic brakes, plenty of stopping power, silky smooth, and no noise. Will not be outfitting anything other than these from here on out. Also, check Power Stop's website for fitment. On the Amazon page it says these do not fit an 06 Impreza 2.5i, I can assure you that they fit quite well.
B001L5IJ0G|5|Replaced the dead battery in my TRIPP-LITE uninterruptible power supply (UPS). Easy installation, works well.
B00LB7UYRA|4|Good quality for the price. A little small for the back seat of the Subaru crosstrex .
B008CE0W5Y|5|I installed these on a small boat trailer when the old light became unreliable.  These LED lights seem to be twice as bright as the old standard bulb fixtures.  I'm very happy with them.
B0002SQYTG|5|These are nice quality US made gauges. They are lot more substantial than the flimsy things sold in auto part stores.
B00IGIZ9NG|5|Looks very good on front of car!
B003A523MA|2|It didn't work for a 2013 Audi A6.  I tried numerous times, asked for advice, researched online, etc... it would not establish a connection with the car.  I give it high marks for simplicity and easy to operate menus.
B008J52L32|5|Fits my Pontiac G8 GT perfectly!
B00FPL0LV2|5|Great buy. Will purchase passenger window to keep up with my new one !
B00AEJDASQ|5|Fast shipping and perfect fit.
B00ANZHG7C|3|Not quite thick enough for my liking. Just okay.
B002NEWXWO|5|Works as intended, used on the headlights on my truck.
B0037UJ0MY|5|Just as I expected!
B001DRH7YG|5|Price was really good, installation was really easy, fitting was perfect.  I had to replace a leading cylinder with this one.  I will buy more if I have too, but I only needed two.  Thanks for ACDelco and the company for the decent product and reasonable price.
B004RNR9QY|5|Was nice for the RV seem durable
B0015PJE0Q|5|I bought this because we had a small LP gas leak that the HVAC guy couldn't find. He said it was so small that we did not need to worry about it. Frankly, I didn't like the answer. As soon as I received the detector, I charged it as per the included instructions. After charging, I tested it outside and found it seemed to work OK, so I took it to the furnace and within seconds I had pinpointed the leak to a location on a fitting on the gas valve. I called the HVAC rep and reported my findings. He replaced the gas valve and no more leak. I have used it to check for leaks at our LP tank and used it when I reconnected our gas range and again when replacing with a gas cooktop. It performed the tests with no issues, and in fact I was able to find a small leak where I had not tightened the coupling under the cooktop. I knew the leak was there as I could smell the gas, and this detector helped me locate the precise source immediately. I am very pleased with its performance. I have had it over a year now and have used it multiple times. The HVAC rep was so impressed he bought one as well and is now able to better serve his other customers.
B00BR05EEY|5|matches perfect!
B00DTBUNE0|4|Like the styling.  Mirrors are a little smallish.
B000AA30DE|5|I bought these for my 1964 Silver Eagle Apache pop up trailer but won't use them as they are way too big, They look tacky so i never opened the package.  I wish they were a little smaller.  Used to be able to buy the smaller ones but not anymore. Sad those would be perfect
B00C0XD37W|5|Great product
B00IPQWDGA|4|Thinner than I expected
B001S8GOVM|5|The hot/cold knob went out on my 2010 Hummer H3.  While the unit still functioned properly I could not live with a light being out.  OCD<br />I looked up online how to change the bulbs on these things and really don’t have the time these days.  So I ordered through Amazon and I have to say it is working flawlessly – so far.  This item came in the ACDELCO box and was not open box – it was new.  Hopefully it will outlast the last one.<br />It will take you anywhere from 5 to 10 minutes to replace.<br />FIRST, insert the key then turn but don’t start and pull the shifter lever all the way back.  Now, disconnect the negative battery terminal.  Put on some latex gloves if you wish. Open the two car charger covers just below the HVAC unit, stick your fingers in and pull out and up.  Once dislodged pop out the upper portion but do so with care so you don’t break anything.  There are three wires/connectors leading to the back of the  HVAC unit – disconnect them.  Now remove the 4 screws holding the HVAC unit in place – use a small ratchet if you have one.  Save the screws, remove the old unit, replace the new unit, screw in, connect the wires and then push the assembly back into place with care.  Now reconnect the negative battery terminal, turn the key and place shifter into the park position.  Start the vehicle and test – it may blink a few times.  Lastly, reprogram the clock if you have the stock radio <br />Done!
B0002RQ5DC|5|Very good. Amarok installed in the lid to bring motocross with the lid open.
B00CEKCEAS|2|Did not fit the garage completely I had to buy a doorway magic mesh to complete the garage ..at least keeps the bugs out
B001G6MOG0|5|just right
B003XMQFDI|5|very pleased wiyh order
B004VRD0XM|5|Original California car duster works great.  Second one I have purchased.  Love it.
B000M3V95U|5|Great stuff!  I prefer this to the aerosol. I use it on my car windshield and windows and it makes the glass crystal clear.  I usually use vinegar, but like another reviewer wrote, this does a much better job (i cringe admitting this bc vinegar is one of my fav things for cleaning) I have one for home and one in my car!  Really like this Invisible Glass Window Cleaner!
B004VBY8LQ|5|Worked just as it says.  Probably should have bought 2 gal, as one was just  barely enough to establish circulation to clean out the block passages and hoses etc.  But got it done, and in the end water was under 2% which was just fine.
B008FQ6D8E|5|Prompt delivery of the correct part that fit and was easily installed
B009FUFBTG|5|awesome items A+
B00S8FSKCY|5|Works great for the price.
B003ZAGI9E|4|Worked as advertised...
B000JWKE2I|4|Good shock for the price
B00173U7D4|5|Best product ever used natural and that what I wanted these artificial products . THIS IS THE BEST
B004PXWKLA|5|Beautiful!
B00EDSTV00|4|Paint flecks accumulated fairly quickly. Possible due to poor installation the wires broke after about a month.
B00I0H27EW|5|I love it
B000OCH4YO|5|good product
B007TWPV0G|5|AWESOME
B00801RLI0|5|Got it as seller promised and this is a GREAT deal, now my 1995 camry drives like brand new!!!!
B004LX3AS6|5|Simple, small system.
B00U5OKH22|3|Kind of flimsy, small eyelid. Gives it a good look for a cheap buck though.
B00Q8SJDJC|3|looks good but difficult to use
B000B8LKVY|5|Fits perfect and it's a brand I can trust.
B0085KGOIE|4|Came ready to use out of the box. The whole thing feels sturdy from the body to the wheels. You don't really need a bobber to tell you when it's getting full. You can see thru the air valve. So save your self the money.
B009F590L6|5|EASY INSTALL WORKS THE WAY IT SHOULD
B004I14YWM|5|Fit perfectly and the wire harness was set up exactly like the original.
B00WRITTJ6|5|It looks great on my car...

B0031OQN0S|5|Kawasaki 3010. Fit good. Two person job especially on seat back. Very snug. Looks really good.
B001C99XCY|5|Great fit and great quality.
B00KPQYV0E|5|Installation was no problem, works as described.
B00L4TF32G|4|I put it on all my rubber and it seems to have put a nice protective coating on the exposed rubber(tires) but I am unable to tell at this time how it did or did not do on door rubber if not exposed. I was unable to put it on some spots because of the inability to reach the rubber at this time.
B008KZKJBM|5|Fits great in my 2015 Tuscon. Very happy with the purchase! has been holding things without issue despite being over the 30lb suggested weight limit.
B00ANWV6C6|5|They fit perfectly and made the van look great.  We were selling it and as soon as we put the new hubcaps on it, it sold for our asking price within days after having been on the market for several weeks.
B00TBNG6RI|5|upgraded my golf cart to a Merc with one sticker
B000C17GPE|5|3 months parked and used twice no problems thumbs up
B0055Q1LWU|5|Great product! Just what we needed.
B00KQU1DWI|5|LIFE SAVER! Nothing that couldn't be replicated with some do-it-yourself wiring, but the price and ease of installation this provided was WELL worth the low cost. It is ALMOST plug and play and got all my lights working. Thanks!
B00B01MI76|5|So far so good!!!!!  Lets see if they hold up!
B005UK3AWU|5|Excelente
B00NT770HM|2|The antenna does not get very good reception.
B0051WT774|5|It's really amazing, it sticks partner and saved me this summer on the coast during the frequent rain showers and high winds. Great patch when you dont have time to replace.
B00UFMO8GK|1|It's not fit in my car
B0009V1WTS|5|It worked awesome on my truck and trailor with fast delivery time Thank You Ernie L
B00BKACQWY|5|Plug and play!
B007USCM7E|5|A little more accurate way of adding refrigerant to a system than just guessing. Standards 12oz cans can be used but don't have the leak detector and oil.
B006CT2URE|5|Worked perfectly
B001BN76IE|5|The truck had rough idle, and no power, also there was a raw fuel smell. After changing plugs & coils truck runs like new..
B0006Z9SQ6|5|Quick shipping, great price
B000BQWJFW|5|Works great!
B0029TQDLA|5|Good value, quality and does the job!
B00C66ALNW|4|nice price, a little small and insufficiently convex but quite affordable and fast.
B003V57NUQ|2|They don't fit my hummer.
B0045LCU80|5|Have found nothing better for the windscreen on the bike
B0083UBYO0|5|Simply awesome. When used with Sonax Polymer Net Shield, it's just awesome.
B00IPS4APU|4|We got a crack in Front windshield in our car and we used Rain-X to fix it. It absolutly working. 80% of the cracks gone.
B00JYLQQ4K|4|Good value. Thanks
B0002Q80GS|5|Easy to install made it look professional
B00SA5VA7E|5|Purchased for my son as his school backpack (his second Ogio pack!).  VERY well made and colors are great.  Shipping was right on time as estimated.  Very happy with the product and seller.
B006WQSLEI|5|The hub assembly did a great job fit perfect
B0002SRL20|5|good
B00DO382IW|5|Best quality and perfect fit and got here before the date
B009IF1V1K|5|Best possible solution for a 1999 F150.  Took 2 hrs to install.
B0044B0ZEW|5|Perfect fit , perfect price and ONE quality.What more could you ask for.
B007KPERVG|5|I wish I would have bought these several years ago. I can see three times the distance as the old yellowed stock lights. I did have to adjust them down considerably. The adjustments are found through the holes in the radiator support. When you begin the job of changing this kit, take the turn signals out first so you will have access to where the bottom of the grill clips into the filler panel. The corner lenses were slightly larger than stock but I didn't have to do any trimming as someone stated they did. The entire job took less than an hour. I couldn't believe the bargain. The bulbs are included with the headlights. Those alone would've cost $40.00-$50.00 at a parts store. No regrets in buying these so far. Been running them for a couple months now.
B00AXLWSVU|5|Matches the interior of my 2010 Avalanache pretty good (not an exact match).  These covers are very well made and cover the entire seat well.  About every month, however, they need snugging up (only the seat bottoms) to keep them in place covering the whole seat.
B00OABYBJG|5|Perfect for my needs. I like the longer spouts.
B009RC2HVC|5|All parts fit ,quick delivery
B002R4U72I|5|I wrapped the exhaust on my polaris ranger. It was easy to install and I double wrapped it. The wrap worked as advertised and I've had that exhaust through plenty of mud and water since and the wrap seems to be holding up well. The wrap definitely improved the heat issues with my ranger. Be sure to properly clean and prep the exhaust system prior to putting this wrap on. Wouldn't hesitate to buy again.
B011SJC2V6|5|Great product and looks great on my car!!
B00OV7HKA6|5|Jumps my 4 12 volt battery bank on my 34 boat every time it's needed. In addition to charging everyone's phones while in the water.
B00BCRMA9Y|2|They are cute but very cheap! I should return, would love to. Front seats in two pieces....slides. Back seat not a proper fit. Not for the Cabrio 😕 it says they fit a Cabrio, but the back seat doesn't fit. Put a couple extra $$$ and buy a better quality set.
B005JPJMI2|5|Great product. I saw it on a YouTube car care video. I use it after every wash. You can use it on most of the surfaces on the<br />truck. It looks good and protects. Even on glass!!
B00MWQ6J7S|5|Very well built and excellent product!
B000EDQQE2|5|Super!
B00JIIZCM6|1|did not take stain out of my gray couch
B007NPK5IC|2|Doesn't look genuine at all!!

B001AVE79S|5|works great
B004SCV4Z6|5|Perfectly lowered look and great handling. Would recommend megan racing springs!
B00OL4PPJM|3|the rubber trim wont  stay on
B004BR5U9Y|2|FM Stations do not come in as clear as the normal antenna it look good but but that's all it does. The reception need to be much better from this antenna I might go back to the factory antenna.
B00GIKBPOG|5|works great -- fast shipping
B00SJTW570|5|good fit look nice.
B000TTNZTU|5|I love it .
B002E3Z3L2|5|took about 30 mins to install. worked perfect.

B007JNVP28|5|Look Nice Work Good
B002E2UK8O|5|It is indeed a good product, but I had to return it for it does not on my car.
B000C5M1VY|5|Loved it
B00BV6UKV6|5|Fixed my 2004 Saturn Ion's old broken wiper transmission. Also, it was indeed metal. It took a bit of work to install (3 hours) and seems a few degrees off for the driver side arm but the spring on my wiper arms makes the effect insignificant. The wiper arms work once more!
B000C5EAWM|3|The screw is not very tight which could cause metal parts to fall inside your engine - use extreme caution and tighten the screw and use thread lock.
B000MD4YKM|5|Good product
B006N9H1CW|5|Parts are exactly as described
B000EW0LP8|5|Excellent quality
B00E1SO30A|5|Right part. Super fast shipping. Installed and can actually hear myself think in the car now. Seems to be good quality so much so that I've already ordered one for the front.
B003DNL8ZC|4|just what i needed fit perfect side opening a nice surpize
B00GZWEKB2|5|I KOVE IT
B005WGR22Q|4|very useful device, the only minus is the shipping time-over a month !!
B0024GUMR4|1|The Black & Decker name used to mean something. This one dead after 6 months and was kept charged and maintained, clean and dry. Looking for something better.
B00G3BRNZ0|5|Love this oil..
B006OILZZG|5|Just long enough to block the sun during the morning commute if I tilt my head down al little. Despite other comments about it rattling, mine fits fine on the snaps of a scooter helmet.
B002L1AKGU|5|Factory direct replacement. No issues at all.
B00T6IYN0A|5|Great piece, works great, and feels good!
B00BPZ30R4|5|Installed perfectly on 02 crown vic lx sport
B000B5QFE4|3|don't  really use them
B00KL3ALGO|1|dont stick to windows for s***
B00D3YEGO6|5|Love it!! Very sparkly and feels heavy duty.
B00Q3WE7TY|5|Fast shipment, works great!
B000F335B8|4|This dash mat is exactly what I needed to protect my dashboard. It stays in place on my dash without using the supplied fastening strips. Would surely recommend
B0048J4PKK|5|Worked perfectly. Super fast shipping
B000C9MEW6|5|South Florida resident, LOTS of under-hood heat [especially in a Chrysler 3.8L mini-van with AC running like mad]. Severe running conditions.<br /><br />I can testify to this belt running quietly until inevitable heat glazing happened, and this belt lasted 2.5+ years [compared to &#60;1 year for the mis-named DuraLast products...]<br /><br />Happily reordering a replacement right now...<br /><br />Recommended.
B000H8XL8I|5|Great fit!!!!!
B00F17Q87G|5|Bought to use as extension for my RV - works great! Good quality...
B003DNL8YI|1|I live in San Diego, CA. I bought it  July 6, 2014 and now I have to throw it away because it's tearing apart every time I want to take it out. When it was new it was sturdy but not any more.
B000NLYJA8|5|Much easier install than I expected.<br />It only took me 45 minutes to install and I have a shoulder injury which makes it difficult to hold up much weight or to reach very far.<br />Very well built and they look great.
B00ASB0CBI|5|Perfect.
B0128J4UDI|1|Does not fit 2015 M4!  Very cheap flimsy plastic.  No durability at all...Disappointed!
B00AQTAWEY|5|I really liked the product. I found the charging times to be as stated in your product description. The best feature is its small size for the power output. The accessories are better quality than others I've seen. The only suggestion I would have is the carrying case is a bit big for the product. If you could modify to smaller carrying case for transport and storage - maybe more the size of the charger, it would make it all the more friendly.
B00I7EKSQM|5|A++++++
B000XLXWQ0|4|I like this bag a lot, however it was pretty big for my hitch.  Was able to fit some other things in there, so it was fine...  Does what it's supposed to, and my hitch doesn't slide all over the back of our suv.
B0019C17AA|5|Added a great, aggressive look to the car. Bolted straight on, no problems. Installation took about 30 seconds, only 4 screws and you're done. Fastest, easiest modification I have made yet, and looks wicked.
B009F4JHHO|1|would not transmit signal
B00QG8YKJC|5|I had the EXO 410 with my previous bike, but sold it all a couple of years ago. I just got another V-Strom and decided on this one because it is Fiberglass. The helmet is comfortable, has good air flow, and is a great value!<br /><br />Highly recommended!!
B00EM11A84|5|worked great!  Little scrubbing when it was time for them to come off window and not problems.  Live in Arizona and they did not fade in 115 degree plus weather
B00C5SSYTO|5|Fast shiping works great. Thank
B00EEQIGUW|5|worked great!  Little scrubbing when it was time for them to come off window and not problems.  Live in Arizona and they did not fade in 115 degree plus weather on black car!
B008Y3K9S8|5|Truck looks very nice
B002ZBPX4A|2|The product has left lint on everything I've used it on.
B00KOEOWMY|5|The individual flowers have enough spaces between them to be cut separately and arranged in the formation you like - which I did.  I have the flowers wrapped around the back of my visor.  Enjoy, the sticker quality is sturdy and the flowers are beautiful!
B004LELY6K|5|Works Great Looks Great. Thanks
B004A2YS48|4|FTW! This was super easy to install. The only issue I saw, was the screws that mount the unit are a slightly smaller size, and will strip out the holes, so even the old screws don't work (the four 1/4&#34; hex head machine screws) so be sure to ditch the new ones from this kit, or be prepared to drill new holes or use self tapping zip screws. By the way, I ordered this, because the battery charger section in mine did not work.
B00UZQUCM0|5|It arrived on time every thing was in place and the price was amazing cheaper ..i would recommend anyone to get it now my Altima runs just fine
B00RW53170|5|Great!!
B0049Z2WMQ|5|nice!
B0041FCNU0|5|Was going to use them to replace the old stem in my lawn tractor tire.  Decided to have it done at a garage.  They put a new stem in as part of the tire change.  They look just like any other rubber stem so seems fine to me.  Did not use.
B000221H08|5|Sprayed all the patio cushions, including the gazebo top.  Works great!  Highly recommended.
B008H3YG7A|5|got here on time work great
B003S1RQ2S|5|No problem
B0075UQ4NK|2|[[VIDEOID:9ddedcce8c1bab00047c8b9761d28e31]]I was pleased with smell however I probably got less than half of what I paid for. JUST LOOK at the picture. ALL of them look like this except the first one. Maybe these people thought. &#34;Put a good one on the top and put all the old ones in the bottom.&#34; Its a shame because I like the product. Just perhaps will consider buying from another seller.
B001F212OK|5|great
B002NF13RY|5|Works as intended, used on the headlights on my truck.
B00DBEMYPQ|5|Love them  my whole truck has gone LED now.
B001B5E5XQ|5|Made a HUGE difference (as expected) in my old Subaru.  Very smooth!  Only problem I had was the TOB; at one point a &#34;collar&#34; was put on the shaft of my transmission due to the excessive wear of a previous bearing (look up the kit others sell online) and rendered the TOB in the kit useless.  I went to Advance and they had the same one as the kit, so it was correct for my car, just not my circumstance.  Since most people (myself included) won't take their car apart prior to ordering this kit; you may or may not get lucky especially if you bought the Subie used and do not know it's history.  I will include a picture of the new &#34;kit&#34; TOB and the (not OEM) bearing I pulled out doing the job.  Look at the difference in thickness in the very center and you will see the issue I had.  The modified TOB had a metal interior ring because it was so thin, the new ones are plastic.  I ground down CAREFULLY to match the diameter of the shaft, but the plastic is very thin and I am sure will not last as long as it should now, but time will tell.  Be sure to order new clips for the fork as well!!!  Subaru p/n# 30539AA000....mine were GONE and added even more time to the job.  Otherwise all went together smoothly and I am very satisfied with the results.
B006R5LND0|5|Item received as described, thanks.
B000YOH16I|5|This thing is a life saver when out on the road with a travel trailer. It is very sturdy and makes sure you have no need to use jacks. Just loosen the lug nuts then drive up onto it with the good tire. Your blown/flat tire will be dangling nicely in the air for the tire change. Just make sure you loosen the lugs first or you will have to back off and loosen them. Great product.
B00C50NHJO|5|Worked perfectly
B00ELHT3PG|5|Royal Purple Motor Oil is worth every penny.  Just traded my 2005 Chrysler 300C with 210K miles on it and they wanted to know how many miles when since the engine was overhauled.  It had never been overhauled, just maintained and started using Royal Purple on the first oil change.  The engine was very strong and responsive, even on the day I traded it.  Five of the dealers mechanics and the service manager drove the car at the time of the trade in.  They just could not believe the engine had not been rebuilt.
B00JFTC0T6|3|Shipping was fast and easily installed. But it does not fit perfectly on my 2015 Wrangler. It is loose and easily shifts when you touch it. It does look exactly like the pic.
B004AHCRKA|4|Came in timely fashion. Installed easily and works well.
B00CBKOP7G|5|Worked like a charm...
B000BZABEO|5|as expected
B00ID7EDRI|5|Super easy to install. Plug and play. Took me 20 mins to install
B0016NBBQW|5|Replaced the sensor on an 02 4runner. It comes with a little packet of anti-seize so you don't have to buy any.
B002LNGKU8|5|Love the smell and looks good
B002YPRL9C|3|Nice to have​ everything in one bag and it fits in my hard bag nicely but tool quality is subpar.
B00H6XPZN6|5|Good product, perfect size for rear seat windows.  Good construction and durable material.
B00B3D0U4Y|2|Hard to find spearfishing sticker, and when you find one it's either too small or low quality.  Other than that, I still want to represent.
B00DM9RXBA|5|THE QUALITY IS GOOD. NO COMPLAINTS
B00QJRYMFC|4|It works with my iPhone 5s running iOS 8.1.x.  It showed up in a bag with no instructions.  It doesn't connect through the Bluetooth settings but in whatever app you will be using.  I need to do some tests to see what kind of battery draw this has if left plugged in.  I wish it had a power switch.<br /><br />I have purchased the Engine Link app for $5.99 from the App Store.  Was a little annoyed they want another $6.99 for the iPad for the same app.  If I had it to do over I'd probably get OBD Fusion.  I don't own DashCommand so can't comment if it works.  They do list Bluetooth support in the description.
B000RFT9SW|1|came without nose cone or weight
B008XMBGSW|5|Great
B00PSPSC20|5|Perfect design and easy installation.  Very attractive too.  What's not to love.
B00E4CQGVW|1|Way too big for my face so waste of money but they are very comfy!!!
B000VI4ZGQ|2|The function is okay. But I don't like the finishing on the surface. The prodcut looks as if it got whity ash, or got some chemical fluid on it..
B009D3F1TU|5|Very high quality, perfect fit, and Italian engineering and quality as well. I will update on efficiency after I put some miles on my bike. My decision to buy was based on: if most of the race teams are using them the filter should be good enough for me.
B00XKY89AG|4|Nice size and useful.  Fold up if needed and has adjustable compartments.  Holds a lot of stuff.  Works for what i needed it  for.  Its just a bit flimsy, wish it was a bit sturdier. but still works, thus the four stars not five.
B00EYTXHDA|5|Excellent product
B000182FG8|5|I have had this bull bar on my 2003 Dodge Dakota for about a year and a half now, and it has pulled its weight and then some. Many people have been saying that it is made of thin material be that as it may, the design (in association with the design of the bracket) allows it to provide protection to your vehicle.<br />I have bottomed-out the front of my truck twice now, once in a creek and once on a rock pile, and each time the brackets have shifted position (and the bar has not been damaged) just as they are designed to do. You will have to straighten the bracket mount out which might require you to remove your bumper, but it is much more worth it to do the work than to buy a new bumper.
B002LOP5IA|5|Does it job, expensive IMO but it's apart of the detailing biz.. Gotta pay to get paid...
B00JBIRBYA|3|BMW 525i fog light, Regular bulbs lights better, looks nice but luminosity is very important to me, not just an ornament.
B006VFR2LS|5|Mounted this to the roll cage on my 2010 Polaris 800 RZRs using hose clamps from Home Depot.  I have a 4lb extinguisher and it holds securely.  Did try it with a 2.5lb and a 5 lb and they worked fine also.  There is a little bit of rattle but a couple strips of gaff tape helped mitigate it.  Still a little bit of rattle when the going gets rough but then again all the stuff bouncing around in the bed makes noise to.  Function is perfect, fortunately I have not had to try out the quick disconnect in an emergency situation but when doing dry runs the system works great.  It does move the extinguisher a bit off of the cage so mounting options became a bit limited as opposed to some mounts that fit a bit more flush against the cage.  I have bounced the vehicle around pretty hard and the mount held firm, no fear that I may lose the extinguisher should I jolt the vehicle.  Happy with my purchase.
B000AS3D3S|4|Perfect fit for my motorhome.
B001TI5IIQ|3|it works but too much physical work is required to achieve results. and u will almost all the cream and spray remaining but no more sandpaper!! thats a bummer for me!
B002PQOIYG|5|They look exactly like the OEM product. I didn't realize how foggy my originals were and these look great on the vehicle.
B0002U2V1Y|4|For the price...SURE!....The clay it self isn't the best i've used but if you NOT a professional detailer I wouldn't buy this as the clay itself isn't the greatest i've used.<br />If your just someone looking to get the best out of your car wash and don't want to spend $$$ on a detailer this is the way to go. Don't worry if you run out of the detailer...Just use soap and water as a glide/Lube and it work perfectly.
B00VUCF0AC|2|There were scratches  you should know the part that was dented
B000CPI5Z0|4|3 Ounces did the trick on my well taken care of ZX-6r Supersport.
B00CAKIM6M|5|fits great on a Jeep Grand Cherokee 2014
B004PXAUGC|4|One of the stepper motors was broken
B00D36A17A|2|really flexible, so they tend to bunch up on the floor.
B001JT1FJ6|5|Good price
B00JJ195MU|5|Awesome product. The responsiveness is progressive; gradual acceleration is greatly improved but flooring it from a dead stop yeilds little difference. Very easy to install. I'd buy three more just to have if I could.
B00F0VOA8M|5|I truly believe this is the best car wax made!  I have been waxing cars for over 40 years and this is the best wax I have ever used.  I have a totally black car which sometimes can be a pain to wax.  This wax is very easy to use, easy on and easy off. The key is to not leave the wax on the car longer than recommended.  Do small areas and as soon as the wax hazes over,  rub it off.  It brought out the beautiful black color on my car  to a shiny bright deep black.  This wax does a beautiful job.
B000C0UP3A|5|GREAT
B0045T4PP8|1|Not the right product. I wanted invest lashes
B00YRHHDAW|5|Just what I was looking for! I needed a quick and easy way to keep my car key separate from my abundance of keychains.
B00UOSKT18|5|Verry good.
B00LCHVIJW|5|Awesome super bright
B00BHI9NFC|5|It fits perfectly. Once the straight pipe that attaches to the cat was positioned correctly it matched up to the factory hangers. If the exhaust doesn't hang in position just reverse the ends on the straight pipe. Align all the flanges to each other and it fit exactly where it should. Great quality and not that much more money than the  oem galvanized that restricts exhaust flow.
B00144B32A|5|Great luggage
B00U0GWJBM|5|They fit really nice
B00CNXQ4U2|5|Cool
B00SSNXLQ6|5|Right one .fix thanks
B004647BEO|5|Exceeded expectation
B007G7Z8C0|1|Very crappy metal. Bought these one year ago, and the &#34;slag&#34; under the surface started appearing about 6 months in. They are now rough and chewing up my pads. Will have to replace at just over 1 year. Raybestos used to be good stuff.... no more apparently.<br /><br />FYI, I bought AcDelco brand for the front, almost a year before I bought these for the back, and the AC delco are still in good shape and smooth. I will be buying them for the back when I re-do these in a month or so.
B00BD4PY1C|4|I needed to trim it a little, but looks nice overall.
B00GXNN71W|5|Love the diamond plate look. My 17 year old son recommended them. Smell is great and he says they last a while.
B000C31XM4|5|Best traditional wiper blades on the market - hands down.
B00DDYT7Y0|5|One hundred stars fantastic
B004XNUYJ2|5|Great quality and build! Looks fantastic
B003VAREXC|4|The sunscreen has worked out very well and it pretty easily to set up. The easiest is to have two people to slide it in the track. The plastic stakes that come with it are garbage and broke first time trying to put them in the ground.
B007AKA7ME|3|Works great
B00VL4NSCQ|5|These black highway pegs look as good as they function. Extra wide pegs provide added comfort.
B00IN52JF8|5|Great Find!
B000P3YYTK|5|Great item just what I needed to fill the hole I n my receiver. Lot cheaper than 1-1/4 ball.
B00KN0UOEE|4|Very easy to apply. Don't use it in direct sun. My boat seats were pretty faded but the shine was restored after a couple applications. Not like new but definitely much improved. And kept the shine after several days of heavy sun. Wish I had gotten this years ago.
B00UHXXOJE|4|Speakers sound great and seem to be good quality. Mounts did not have much adjustment but worked out OK.
B00AEEGZLK|4|Needed some trimming to fit my aftermarket bumper, specifically the lower width portion, not BMW's fault of course.  Would have given it 5 starts but for a snap-in piece of plastic, no...
B00EIGEK4Y|5|great item love it
B00BYRKYRC|4|I bought this as a present for my father. This helmet was the exact one he wanted. He seems to like it very much. It also came on time.
B001C6NTR2|5|The price of this product was right in our budget, We are so satisfied,we give it five stars.
B004OI7O08|4|Work great for 2001 wrangler
B00UHD4HJA|4|Bro these Stickers are the BOMB but I didn't see no YouTube Sticker.. But there all different from what it suppose to look, still good and I got 51 stickers which at least is good
B009461IUW|5|Fit my 2007 yamaha vino perfectly.
B007V2BDWY|5|It's a little pricey, but very substantial in it's construction.  It fits the window perfectly.  Time will tell if it lasts.
B009144TZS|4|Driver  side  could not get on. The seat no where to place hooks?
B0002SRL20|5|works great, very durable totally recommend
B001GC2LVM|5|As represented
B0073J97NC|1|did not work with my bike. The OEM part from the dealer did. For what I paid it was worth a shot.
B008NO5QDQ|4|I added this with the volant powercore intake... The throttle response is noticeable... You can really tell the gas consumption when on highway... Not so much around city. This is a worthy investment...
B009OTW646|5|Great soap.  I've had it for a few week and every time I use it, it rains!
B007V6JVR4|5|Beutiful
B00029WSXQ|5|Great!
B00HVHKB8G|5|Perfect protection for your car keys...fast shipping...awesome deal !!!
B00GBBCGZO|5|Perfect fit
B00RHP255O|1|Month latet and the light in switch has already gone out....
B004RCURIC|5|Was straight forward to install and use. 360 degree swivel made it a cinch to hook up. Will suggest purchase to anyone who wants a user friendly tow set up that works smoothly for men or women.
B00CLMBE5A|4|Cheap and very good hitch. Got it installed by pro's for $50<br />I'm not towing and mainly use it to hook-up my bike rack from Thule.<br />Only negative point: Amazon shipped the hitch not properly packed and some of the paint was damaged.
B000RFUYQI|5|Quick ship and low price on a high quality tool.
B00INVEUFO|3|The wire is fine but I never did receive the white. The label on it says &#34;white&#34; but the wire is clearly black. Which would be amusing if it didn't happen twice.
B007RZ2A8Q|1|Humorous to pinths, I imagine.
B00206Y198|5|Perfect fit. Noticeable difference in heat in car. Not just a thin reflector like some sun shades, but also provides insolation to absorb heat. Only negative is that it takes up more room.
B00CHT340A|5|Good jacket.
B00UFERZKO|5|This unit is a life-saver on long road trips and for camping. Works as advertised and plenty of wattage to power projectors, laptops and air pumps (though not all at the same time). You don't even have to turn it on to charge phones and tablets via the USB ports. I chose this over other larger capacity inverters because of it's compact size and quiet performance. Build quality is good too.
B0002YQSQ4|5|Already had to change filter after getting contaminated(water) fuel...It worked like advertised and saved me from getting in trouble with water in fuel system...Don't put together a diesel system without one!
B001SG7U2G|4|good
B0088BBQOC|4|nice
B004I1CRGM|5|Exact replacement and works great.
B00JBJ3QAW|5|Perfect
B0002NUNVG|5|It's 3M  great product.
B00ICSP98U|4|Some little paint flaws, overall I'm happy with the fit and look of the product.
B007WR25KW|5|Worked great with the Rightgear 100S10 rooftop carrier that we purchased and used. Traveled 690 miles each way. Easy installation, stays in place. Great option for using when you do not have a roof rack.
B0022XG3WM|5|Love this bag.  we got it to go on our 2014 Harley tri glide, fit perfectly.....Gives us easy on and off bag for the road trips we take.  So handy and secure!!!
B000OKT7GY|5|fit great worked as advertised no complants,replaced the 1972 modle in one of my older RVs
B00QW3N4GQ|5|Handle came as expected in a timely fashion
B0055AW0N0|1|Not deep enough to keep the water bottle/Coke/cup from spilling.
B0085L4GW4|4|The product was fine.  The vendor was fine. My only complaint is the cord is shorter than the original even though it's OEM.
B000TYQ9GQ|4|Even though bads reviews I had read about this item I bought it because an ACDelco reservoir I had bought before got broken in few months.<br />Two things I like most:<br />  1) It comes with a  cap (More value for my money).<br />  2) It is transparent (Because I use only water to cool my car engine, I am able to see water level easily)<br />One think I do not like:<br />  It is not so easy to thread the cap.
B00FEZKENY|5|Sticking in there...just fine...
B000CCBMEY|5|Very solid and stable bike rack.  Exactly what we were looking for!  Great quality and security to transport your bikes.
B00QH4IA0A|1|that was not worth anything that i have bought on amazon,never illuminated the purpose i thought it would do.
B00DNKQ88M|1|it is cute, however, it is not made of a rubber as in a car tire or a sneaker, but rather it feels like a hard plastic.  The bottom of it feels as slippery as plastic.  Had I known it was plastic-like, I would have purchased one of the other products that are focused on functionality versus cuteness.<br /><br />I wanted something made of rubber so that it would have better traction on different surfaces.  However, this is not what I was hoping for.<br /><br />On the positive side, I can slide it into my jeans rear pocket, and so it is portable.
B003SG7PU6|4|For the price paid for these seat covers...they do the job. I have a new 2015 Toyota Corolla and my seats are a very light khaki/beige color. To avoid getting them destroyed by my kids on our family road trip vacation...I ordered these to take the brunt of it. These seat covers are obviously not meant to last forever and a little lesser quality however, they do the job, protect my actual seats and they look really good in my car. Matches perfectly because my interior is beige and black. Looks sharp!! :)
B001DRHMMS|5|price is fine. installing is simple
B008B5X5GC|4|Very pleased
B000X1E59S|5|Good oil
B00EB40FPQ|5|Great product, fit perfectly and easy to use
B00UH9PWDY|5|This is the definition of bang for the buck! None of the videos do it justice. This is some high quality textile with all the bells and whistles of a much more expensive jacket at a very affordable price.<br />Pros: Very high quality for the price. Looks nice and professional. Comes with armor (again, the low price for what you get is incredible. Very comfortable.<br />Cons: Runs a little small for the measurements listed. I will probably never use the included hood so I wish you could hide the zipper used to attach it.<br />I highly recommend this jacket. I bought the orange and it's a very tasteful color with the benefits of hi-vis. I love it.
B004JB78WO|5|This product saved my vehicle!
B004LX3AS6|5|Perfect, it does what is says it will do.  It is truly set it an forget it.
B000JFHNG0|4|works fine
B0002JMLEM|1|Written 8/18/15<br /><br />If the people at Littelfuse posted the picture you see of multi colored fuses, well, myself I avoid people like them.  Amazon picked up the slack though.<br /><br />I don't know about the other reviewers here, but the picture of the item I needed were fuses like these.  YES, I see now in re-reading the description that the item they send you will be 25 (solid, not see-through, baby BLUE colored) - 15 Amp fuses.<br /><br />Looking at the picture of 6 different colored fuses after searching high and low to make sure I had the correct fuse for my particular vehicle, I think you can see where the confusion and relief that after all that searching I found what I needed.  I DIDN'T.  The picture is misleading.<br /><br />Okay, if you came across this item first in your search  AND read the description you might see that you will only be receiving the 15 amp fuses I described above:  25 of them.  Everybody orders that, right?<br /><br />I was at a point that it appeared in my mind that I would be receiving an assortment of various amperage fuses.  I was wrong.  If you make the same mistake, at least Amazon will make good on the return; by going to Your Orders, click on Return, they guide you through from there.
B0099S559U|4|Great just what I was looking for but Tue price of shipping is too high
B00USXF4VO|4|OK
B000143LHY|5|wORKS WELL!
B00IKQ2LKI|5|Product came so quick. It was in great shape. Easy to put on.
B004TXVOSG|2|bottle seemed to be half full...  only enough product to do 2 coats on a small vette top<br /><br />product worked well JUST wasn't a good value in my opinion<br /><br />very dissapointed
B0013TM0Z0|5|keeps me warm in my tractor-cab.
B00GYY2Q5I|5|Couldn't ask for easier installation.  You just plug the kit into the factory bulb connector and it works!
B00DZ357ES|5|Battery has performed without any issues. Great price, fast shipping, no complaints.
B00EUHTCX0|1|Did not fit properly, cheap made, tried to return them but the seller made it so difficult I had to keep the fender flares. I would have lost $90 on shipping.
B004R3CBX0|4|Worked well but the Four Port Trailer wire was too short and I had to use an extension.
B0009IQXMC|5|works great and is lungs of engine.
B006H34BUY|2|Doesn't work well. Just moves the dust from one place to the next
B010JRJYFK|4|EASY TO INSTALL
B00G09VDQU|5|easy to install. Save a lot of money by not going to the dealer for do ing this simple job.
B003I822AW|5|OMG Great Quality, BBK 78mm throttle body bbk cold air intake also. 2004  mustang 5 speed fixed pegging issue
B000CQI270|5|Works as expected
B004CIK5YC|5|Excellent product. Sounds and looks a lot better than the stock exhaust. The sound isn't too &#34;ricey&#34;, it has a nice deep pitch to it that isn't unnecessarily loud. I couldn't get too bolts off of the stock exhaust so I had to go to a shop and pay $30 (which isn't bad). No real performance or MPG gains as to be expected with just an axle back system. Overall a great product with a great sound to it.
B000CGCFFA|5|was more than 80% cheaper than what repair shop tried to charge me, and they work great!!
B00HR0BCZI|5|Fits 2013 Chevy Cruze
B000CCZ4IE|5|works great and 80% cheaper than what repair shop tried to charge me!!
B000182EWS|4|Not as dark as some but look good overall :)
B00D2QL0DU|1|Configured as directed. Nothing happens. Doesn't work. Waste of money.
B007X48RV0|5|They look like  they were made  for my mini cooper, I get so many compliments from ladies, and men  she is adorable with her lashes!!!
B00EYK50UC|1|Way too dim. Can't see during the day. Can't see the color with lights on. And worSt part was they melted over night. I didn't even turn on my lights!!!! Except for testing to see if I can see them for less than 30 secs
B000C59WHA|5|Great factory replacements. Installed on a 2005 Chevy Tahoe 4x4.
B00Z0KQ3OM|5|The mirror provides a great rear view that cover a lot of area.  Exactly what I wanted.
B000EQB6XA|5|Fits perfectly and looks like a quality filter.
B00DJ5KEF4|5|Works perfectly
B000FPZRP8|3|Wasn't what I thought it was, but now I have a spare!
B00FZQ2S7M|5|Fit perfectly
B00WAMRMLQ|1|Timing chain was stretched when it was delivered, tensioner was seized in the bore . Very poorly made product.  Dont waste your money
B009DIWO3G|5|This was easy to install and seems to have improved my performance noticeably, though I was replacing the stock filter that was dirty. I have not determined if I am getting better gas mileage yet, but I am sure it will be better with the performance increase as long as I stay off the pedal! Goodbye K & N, I am now a Spectre customer!
B00BITR7GM|5|was a perfect fit for my truck!
B007Y86KTG|5|Great product. Great price! Great shopping speed 😊
B001PIKCS6|1|Did not work at all
B0045WBVUM|1|This was not compatible with my bike. It had nothing to do with the product just the design of my seat did not allow it to perform correctly.
B00MOKLRS8|5|Fit perfectly and install was easy on my 2014 Silverado Crew Cab. Took about at hour and I only needed a socket wrench.
B00XN15RU6|1|Part broke 3rd day it was on
B008L5FEUC|5|good!
B00AC6Y6XY|4|It fit my Hypermotard really well easy to install and it doesn't move around I'm pretty happy with it.
B001AHI1U8|5|Works great on my camper. Holds USA, State of Mississippi, and USN flags proudly
B00WC757DO|5|I am satisfied with the look and the quality!
B004ZF3I2I|5|The bulb fit perfectly into the headlight housing of my 2006 crv. I've had other kits that I had to return because the bulbs were too wide or too long.<br />I did have to make two small modification for installation.<br /><br />1) I fabricated a ring so the wire bracket on the headlight would hold the bulb in flush. I just used the plastic rings that it shipped with which hold the bulbs in the plastic container. Just trimmed it to fit with a dremel.<br /><br />2) I had to pull 2 wires through the rubber diaphragm and connect the wires to the ballasts on the outside of the headlight housing. Not sure why they were inside, maybe that's the set up for other vehicles.<br /><br />I ordered the 4300k kit and it looks great. Not an instant on, but maybe a 5 seconds warm up to full brightness. The color was perfect for a stock look. The beam pattern (not do to the kit) is a little splotchy but it covers a ridiculous amount of area and has very little glare which was a big worry for me. Much safer for me and oncoming traffic than my stock bulbs which would burn out every few months and often require me to drive around with the brights on.<br /><br />The packaging seems nice on the outside, but the bulbs are just kinda of squished into the box, with no real order. The ballasts are nice and slim, so it's easy to install in all sorts of tight areas. I have already recommended this product to friends who have been thinking of upgrading their headlights for a while.
B00LX2296M|2|Not water proof. One fogged up inthe first rain, another had the back discolor, turned a white/gray.
B007IPKTNS|5|Thanks battery works great loved the price
B00NAJ0V1Q|3|met expectations
B00XDURYSA|5|Good bulbs at a great deal.
B00R7ZP6OQ|5|Great looking piece....just wish i.could find similar items like this of other cool emblems...
B00D619OGQ|5|Best wire harness you will get from Amazon. I ordered this for my 54&#34; bar and a cheap harness for my 20&#34; bar. There is a significant quality difference in every piece of the product.
B00E0LH8I2|5|excellent
B00U5OMBJ4|5|Attached to the front of my BobCat Zero Turn mower and it works great.  I ordered this light with the recommended wiring kit.  Went to Lowes and bought a metal bit, and it mounted and hooked up easily.  Used zip ties to fasten the extra wiring to the mower's frame under the seat.<br /><br />I mow about 6 acres.  The mounting bracket has been very sturdy even though I've banged around my yard all summer - it has taken the beating.  I have a home in a field in the country and never rolled it - it's a pretty rough mow, and the light and brackets have been great.<br /><br />You'd think the light would attract bugs, but it doesn't.<br /><br />I mow around white pines at full speed and the branches whack the front of the mower where I have the light mounted and everything has been fine.<br /><br />Not the traditional use for a light bar, but it sure is nice for a mower in the twilight hours where you need to see the edge you've cut to finish up a mow.<br /><br />Would buy again for sure.
B004M7VF2O|5|Very good
B00G620ZVU|4|Worth the money.
B003UWTJ2A|3|it works good 50/50 mix
B0099V02EA|5|I LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!  MY LIL STUBBY HELPS ME GET ALL MY FAVORITE RADIO STATIONS!!!!!!!!!!!
B00XIYFAT6|5|Worked well
B012JHUQ82|4|Nice, high quality vinyl. Seems as if they needed to be a tad bigger.
B005GYAKVO|3|Okay, on the Passat dash there is that small lip that goes right up to the windshield.  Because of this lip, this product does not fit precisely.  I make it work with a little shoving.  Actually the more I use it the easier it gets to contort it to fit.
B002LYQALQ|3|doesn't work well.  oil wont despense without a lot of effort
B000HZRTDE|5|great
B000BQSIWK|5|Great product. Has saved me many times. Still works great after 2 years.
B0002SQU9K|4|Much better built than the one that broke from Harbor Freight.<br />If it had a socket fitting instead of a handle I would have given it 5 Star rating.
B00U7B3KXG|5|Right price - fast shipping - Chain was easy to get on and is  Cranking right up now with no problems.Great buy!
B0002TDUW4|5|Perfect product for anything that needs strengthening
B00GWFOSRS|5|Very easy to read and use.
B000NUBH22|5|Great anti seize and an even better price.
B00MQ7C2TC|3|Cute but overpriced. Oh well.
B002IPODA8|5|Delivered on time. Fits perfect on my 98' blazer.
B000EVYGZA|5|Great multimeter!  Easy to use controls, and the probes are easy to nest into the frame of the unit for storage.<br /><br />The digital read out has nice large numbers that are very easy to read.<br /><br />It doesn't do as much as a more expensive unit, but for the price this is a great tool.
B00ZCVKZG6|5|I needed a tire pressure gauge to keep in my truck, this one looked sturdy and so I got it.<br /><br />I like that the gauge is larger in my hand than the usual pencil shaped gauges.  It is much easier to hold and control.  The rubber case will help it withstand shock and aided in making it easy to hold.<br /><br />The pressure reading is maintained until you push the reset button.  This is a great feature, lets me take a reading then bring it close so I can read it!<br /><br />That this does not look like a pencil and is bright red, I doubt I will misplace this one all the others I have ever had, great design.<br /><br />I received this product at a Discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased review
B00RCEJ7JW|5|Perfect!!
B00GUI4JWQ|5|Exact replacement for my 2007 Escalade EXT, Mexico built. Works in many other similar GM vehicles. It was easy to install thanks to YouTube college. Used on the left (drivers side) rear door that wasn't popping the lock up at all times. This is a common Governmet Motors part failure and was much cheaper to install myself instead of taking it to the trucks doctor.
B00EFBF5O6|5|Super cute and goes great on my HP laptop. I love this little sleeping pikachu it's so cute!
B00KGGTF9U|4|It fits well on the windshield of our CX-5. However, my husband does not like that there is no notch for the rearview mirror (makes it a little challenging to stay up or attach).
B003N7MHPI|5|A++++++
B001445IZ8|5|Best way to change your oil EVER.  Was skeptical at first, but made a believer of me on the first use. No need to climb under the car anymore....
B008HL7T0I|5|Fit great works great
B00KTIYXLU|3|slow to respond vs factory. but they do work
B00EDORMWI|5|Some of the best lights i have ever purchased
B0073V1KEO|5|Used so many times I've lost count. Great purchase. Even works on 4/0 gauge wire if you do two cuts!
B00LNJI1KI|5|Love it!
B00M9NX9MC|5|Perfect fit for a 2004 Vw Passat Glx V6
B009NGGSRG|5|The style fit my Tiger well. The unit was easy to bolt on. The pipe provides just enough growl without be obnoxious.  The bike shed about 10 lbs from the stock exhaust. A recommend buy.
B00MBCAUPU|5|They look awesome in my 2003 mini cooper s. The install was kinda troublesome. I had to do some drilling into the brake pedal and i had to buy different screws but all in all i still give 5 stars because of how awesome it look when its done and because it was way cheeper than than the brand name pedals. delivery was a lot faster than it estimated also. very happy :)
B00CB8WM2S|4|Works great have not used yet ...
B00IRBPCEI|4|This is a solid, quality product.  It's exactly as advertised and I have found all the tools useful and effective.  This product is a great way to carry around a wide variety of common tools in a single package, much more convenient than trying to keep track of various screwdrivers, pliers, etc.<br /><br />The only minor drawbacks are weight (a bit on the heavy side, although that also makes it feel very sturdy) and the fact that its compact design makes it slightly awkward to use versus, say, a standard screwdriver.  For example. I wouldn't want to try to unscrew dozens of screws using this tool, but it works well for a few when you don't have a regular screwdriver available.  For me, having all these tools readily available definitely outweighs the awkwardness.<br /><br />Also, this tool seems to be TSA-friendly, although it will get you a little extra attention.  There aren't any blades on it, and it passed the detailed scrutiny of a TSA agent when I went through airport security last week.  However, they are likely to want to pull it out for a closer look since they can't tell whether it's &#34;safe&#34; or not in its folded up form.  To simplify and expedite screening, I'd recommend pulling it out of your bag separately just like a laptop.
B003TTL0TE|5|This is a great product, soft enough not to scratch your car and it does the job
B007J7DZH2|5|Love the matts. These sit on top of my car matts to have double protection on whatever these matts don't cover
B003AW1J0U|5|love
B00TEG2NJC|5|Beautiful and great quality!
B00LUPOSD4|5|Very strong. I like it.<br />Some pieces a little bit big.
B00OKVNE26|5|Excellent carb. Put it on my 96 xr200r. I took it on a 77 mile test drive. Worked great!
B00K3OS2A8|4|Could be better designed. But overall good.
B001CDIKWE|5|packs small, decent quality
B001DKT0DO|4|A little small than my previous ones, but works.
B00OO2L2K2|4|did its job
B004PC49ZQ|4|Nice little lights, and at a good value. I've seen a little better quality but the price can not be beat. Arrived on time, just what I needed. I will order more for other projects now that I know they will work for me.
B004ALJWDQ|5|Great product. Steering feels very firm and responsive now. Highly recommend.
B0040CU2Y8|5|Can;t go wrong with a few extras if you plan to work on you GM
B005C1Y9D6|5|Best money I've ever spent.  Super cheap way, to upgrade the car.
B00K1C1WC2|5|Good quality.  Would purchase again.
B005ESNRL2|5|She loves it!
B003CKOFZ6|4|The gasket set fit my Honda XL600R, and the price on Amazon was cheaper than at my local Honda dealer.<br /><br />The gaskets seem quality and well made.  After assembling and running my motor, I didn't have any leaks.  There isn't much else to say about a gasket set...<br /><br />I took off 1 star, because $90 still seems like too much money for a few gaskets, but its a nice set.
B00APL7O4Y|5|Very stylish on my '93 corolla. My friends no longer call it a piece of s*** because they're too proud of my taste. Only problem is that one of the clips broke off when I put the last one on, just be careful popping them to your rim.
B00KM18P5Y|5|Works exactly as advertised. I have not yet used all of the diagnostic functions. The fast charge and start cycle is amazing.
B00WNFQ8D8|5|very happy easy install. :)
B00CEX4L9W|5|Everyone looks at this fuel cover and says how awesome it is! At first, I would tell people that I purchased it separately (Little Ms. Honesty) but I got tired of explaining it so when someone says they love it I just say thanks.
B00KGICTLO|4|It is what I wanted
B00FZPNIKY|5|Thermostat arrived on time and fit perfectly.  Took longer to access the part on the car than to actually change it out.  I would recommend you buy the lower hose as well when you order the part.  Access is easier when you remove the lower hose and since it is off any way you might as well replace it too.
B007Y3NV4I|3|It's not waterproof.
B000COC67E|5|works perfect
B000E4JLM0|5|right item for the price,work as described.
B000NCOKZQ|5|works good
B012TXES1C|5|Is way better than the others
B004HPSI6M|4|Just what it's supposed to be.
B001GN0HSA|5|Hitch went on fairly easily, there was one bolt that was a pain that I had to drill out the hole on the frame so be prepared (drivers side).<br />I decided to cut out the plastic fascia and reinstall it.  If you do, install the inner plastic clips first, it will make your work easier.  Great hitch.  Took me about an hour to install and about an hour to install the fascia.
B000GRQIFI|5|Very well made
B0007ZL174|3|Eh. It works, but I stil need to buy a presure clip to make it work better.
B003VAUFKG|5|Worked well, when I needed extension for the tow bar.
B0006IX896|2|This item is recommended for the suburban anode rod I purchased.  However it does not fit the rod and is actually for a residential water heater not an RV.
B004OXRETE|4|Easy to set up and works great.....time will tell
B0002SR88C|5|good reach and control
B00BVB6G82|5|It works.
B00QMWQOHS|3|Is not that nice, I have to put it outside my backyard to let the plastic smell gone before I packed it into the box. Haven't use in on my car so far.
B00E63TI32|5|Love this bottle!!! I work long hours and was tired of drinking room temperature water. This bottle truly delivers as promised, at the end of my long day, my water still is ICE COLD 😀 I love it !!!!
B005CLLXG2|5|Great product.
B00B5LMBXW|5|These look great, high quality look and feel like real leather.
B00EHIO5QG|5|Great quality product. Easy to install.  Super friendly customer service.
B00M74WROE|5|Good product and it fit a 2001 Honda CRV. But the screws in the connecting piece between the muffler and resonator are weak. They easily snap.
B000Q0VU8A|5|Quality
B000A0CALC|5|Easy install and fit to a T.
B00GJXM0DC|5|Prefect replacement
B0052SF0LO|4|So far, so good.
B004I0J8O2|5|Fit perfectly and looks great
B009IFIKCI|5|Exactly what I needed.
B000E28C7M|5|BEST FILTER OUT THERE!
B004R38RXS|3|Good product, but a bit hard to get tight.  I'd probably just use one of the transom kwik-lok tie downs if I had to do it again.
B00KCQSM9S|3|It was okay.
B00SNWNUAE|5|Had to do alittle fabrication to the grille with a dremel but other than that it fit great! And looks awesome!
B00HSHVVXI|4|LED lights work nice.  Could have used some instructions, as some of the bulbs needed to be tweaked in order to fit in the Honda Odyssey sockets.  Seller clarified, and it worked out fine.
B00PT18QAQ|5|Took a chance on this never having heard of this brand.  Extremely satisfied.  My husband said he would happily buy from this company again
B0010ECXYG|1|Set screw on back does not lock in place, aweful design, it rattled right off and now the multi position seat it one position!!!!!
B00EF2HQOC|5|Bumper looks great and goes on easy, however my package did not arrive with mounting bolts, just brackets. I ended up using 1/2 inch bolts that were 7&#34; to 8&#34;  inches long.
B00SK5ETTA|5|Best investment
B009B65K0E|5|Perfect, just like advertised. Very bright light.
B000C11JMA|5|Works great!
B00FVE9Z6U|5|Perfect for my BMW i3.
B007WIBR50|5|Fit exactly with every curve on the dash.
B00AMMCE3C|5|For some reason I thought that because it looks metallic, it would be made of metal but it's not, it's made of some kind of rubber mixed with something else. It does the job and I like how it brightens up the floors of my car. It does its job well by covering all necessary areas.
B0031GR4LI|5|GREAT
B0093Y1N14|5|Perfect fit
B00Z6KLT2C|4|would prefer a ball instead of a flap, but it works well
B000C9J3L6|4|Seems to wear faster than previous rotors
B008CLNYPC|5|Great holder for a jerrycan
B00NJSA96U|5|Great spoiler! Easy to install. Fast service. Looks great!
B0060ZB43G|5|Loud and clear, I am hoping this brand will last longer on my motorcycle than the crappy quality &#34;bad boy&#34; air horns I had used before.
B00GO7TESW|1|The bolts fall off easily and there is a gap between the front and back panel , water can easily flow in.
B00XM0W3L4|5|Nice wheel and rotors. Complete package is top notch.
B00CIWOK3Q|5|Wasn't a perfect match but wasn't expecting that, they never saw the car and red metallic is tough to match anyway!!!
B005C5EW8Y|5|Good quality & fits well
B00AQ4VFE0|5|I always use OEM oil and filters. Right product, right price. I'm satisfied
B004QJH91E|4|This is a very sturdy bag and I'm pleased that I purchased it. I bought the small one for a 2008 Prius which worked great. I was able to fit myself and three kids and camping supplies for a six-day trip into this little car. (Ok, it was very tight, but it worked.) I gave it 4 stars just because it is a bit hard to zip up and use, but that's probably true for most of these types of bags.
B006B26F7S|5|I bought these brake pads for my '07 BMW G650 XChallenge, and am very pleased with them.  They grab much better than the OEM ones.  I just put them on yesterday, so don't know about longevity.  But they seem to be of very high quality. No brake squeel so far, they have been perfectly quiet. Install took 5 minutes.
B00CMFF1AA|5|Worked just fine in my 2007 4Runner, for the climate control/fuel mileage LCD screen. These bulbs are slightly larger than the 4Runner's OE bulbs, but it makes no difference. The plastic bulb housing is the same so it snapped right in. Used both of these to replace both OE bulbs - even though only one was burnt - and kept the good OE as a backup.
B0093XZDS4|5|Works as advertised.  Engine runs much smoother with much less vibration even when running the AC.
B0009OR9AG|3|Good color & fits the gloves I use (Black Mamba X-Large) no problem. The magnets are not very strong though. I peeled them off and glued stronger magnets on.
B000GZLAIK|5|Combined with the DG exhaust this old bike is like new!! Easy installation.
B00FYX2RF4|3|I wish it were more custom.  However, it does is job.
B003MRXS8E|5|This is really nice and actualley ordered for both my cars.
B000C10E1W|4|Perfect !!!
B001NZ6I6G|5|Works great!
B00B1ZEDB0|3|Nice sticker with great color. But it's not well cut. I needed a scissor to get it off the backing
B00D96TWC4|5|My gurl love it
B0084UI7CG|3|Nice concept but rear portion did not fit contour of trunk floor leaving gaps at the sides.
B009IFIEQK|5|LOOKS GREAT AND EASY TO REPLACE.
B000E4JLM0|5|Fit like OEM.
B000LOLWZW|5|It was exactley what needed with quick delivery Than You Ernie L
B00O83U3UW|5|In liked the product and it arrived on schudle and in pefert shape ,it was a bargin.
B00X6DDXPC|5|Works great but is really hot when removing, just like any other window visor.  But I really appreciate the design and color.  Very vibrant and different!
B00230OCGS|4|Nice quality and good fit after finding a place to put it...
B007QC2MSI|1|Do not work it would not put it it does fall right out very unhappy
B00AFVRF8Y|5|Nice heavy duty truck hitch fits my 91 dodge perfectly only had to drill 2 holes
B000FOIJXQ|5|Bought and applied 6 years ago, I'd say the amazing affects of this product last a solid 4 years.  That's 4 years of sun, snow, car washes, rain etc.  Quite impressive! I purchased a second set to reapply.  Used on VW Cabrio lower bumper and now on Subaru Forester hard plastic &#34;mud flaps&#34;. Soaks in and dyes as it promises rather than just a temporary filmy shine that easily washes off.
B0016IVQE4|4|Works as it should. The o-rings that came with it were way off. Had to get the o-ring/seal kit for the car anyway so just used the ones that came with the kit. Currently driving around with a.c. in my 2000 corvette
B001L9KI56|5|Great for not having to change the grip.
B00KYBOIGC|5|Works great
B001PY3SRC|5|Perfect fit for 2000 ranger
B00F64RTTU|5|Love the slush mats! Second Jeep..second set of mats!
B001L9VTMW|5|This one went on the wife's kia soul. Looks good.
B001J8M80C|5|Great product fit my car very well and came with the clips to hold them didn't expect that
B000HBNV8U|5|I used it for my cars molding which came off in a car wash.. Works great for gaskets too!
B004J9HEWK|5|Easy installation-just what I needed.
B002ONTBMO|1|Not actual product.  Got product but was not actual.  Faded out and was not a actual replica of pic onsite.
B00U9YPXOU|2|It's ok. It wasn't made correctly. The window guards were too small for the front windows and way too big for the back windows. I had to cut the ones for the back windows to fit and there is about 2 inches missing from the front ones... I will be spending more money in the future for OEM ones.
B00851XSEG|5|These work great as a replacement for fixtures with failed ballasts.  Simple installation.
B00Z1RFENA|5|Very good manual.
B00D2C1TWQ|5|Everything I expected
B006SM6ZP8|5|Great install fast shipping
B00SISL36Q|3|The look of the horses seemed faded.You can't really see details in the design.Not as big as I'd imagined.I took the horse symbols and glued them on bigger center caps myself and threw away the ones that came.
B0096BBDNW|5|perfect fit, easy install on 2005 Eclipse Spyder, manual trans.  Working very well.
B00MQFHZOG|5|This is a quality piece and it works
B00HS5ILN8|5|I really like these rotors and brake pads. They make my 05 caddy look good.
B000CPCRHM|1|Don't like it at all.This spray nozzle was jam after initial spray.It was very hard to use the rest paint which was inside.
B000O1C47M|5|Great pump
B00GWFOPKS|1|Bent after one use...
B00VELE71W|5|Worked greate in very tough conditions
B00Y4K0DD6|5|This product is perfect
B001P22PIM|1|Meh....cheap.  Didn't like at all
B00873J0YY|5|My Kayak racks arrived when they said they would, the shipping took longer than I expected so order them early if, like me you need them right away.  Assembled and installed them in just a couple hours with minimal problem.  Someone more mechanical probably could have done it faster, but I am proof anyone can do it.  I was able to haul my two kayaks just under 900 miles without losing them.  I did stop half way and buy ratchet straps to replace the tension straps that came with them because the ones from that came with it kept working lose as we were passing bigger vehicles.  I would absolutely buy them again.
B000GTVE4G|4|Excellent fit for my 2003 ducati monster 620, even with the large stock side mirrors. Occasionally when handling i need to re-adjust them. Overall tough build.
B00BSEOTIG|5|It worked
B005BNG1U4|5|Perfect
B001W6LGGS|4|Works as advertised...
B000IYEMM0|5|A+
B00T9GC18K|5|Worth the money.
B0027URE1O|4|I mounted this on a 2014 Polaris sportsman 570 eps.  It worked well, only bug was that I had to grind a small notch on the back to clear the front differential.  It probably would have mounted without the clearance. The quality of the product is great and the mod only took a couple minutes.
B002LEM5BA|1|Never stay tucked in always straightening them thinking of putting in back seat
B0045WBVUM|5|Used this for my trip to Sturgis from Chicago and it worked great. It took a few times to find the right amount of air but once I found it, it felt great! Very comfortable.
B00S2AG6SU|2|LOOK GOOD CHEAPLY BUILD
B005T3PXNM|5|Appears to be more durable than other covers I have used. Fit my trailer well.
B004EDCR0U|5|They are great work great
B00J09QPI8|1|Total junk. Chrome peeled off with the plastic wrapper.
B00ED4JVUE|5|perfect fit and finish
B007ITXKWQ|5|Using this in a Gas Gas EC 300 to clean up the midrange on the throttle. The stock needle is garbage compared to this.
B00B5WL4HK|4|good product, very easy to use
B0093A9YXW|4|It fits the Prius!  Keeps car cool.  However, putting it on and removing it requires patience.
B007JN5HSQ|4|a must have for the metropolitan
B00BAZCIR2|1|Waste of money !!!
B00TXVNZQI|4|Works like a Charm on my MB E350 key.
B00C5SKHOY|5|Great price,fast delivery and fits perfect even with the factory bed liner.Very well made and looks great.Has cut outs for rear bed tie downs.
B000AO8ZA8|5|Looks awesome on truck!
B00F7NEREU|4|Very comfortable but moves too much on my Honda Civic
B00GZLMEPM|5|The kit arrived ahead of time. It completely cleared the yellowing on the headlight covers. Wow, a product that does what it promises.
B00MNQVBJ8|5|Well worth the money
B0083W16SM|5|Out the carb on and my Honda fired right up and runs great with no adjustment  Highly recommend
B00D2IK4FS|5|Easy to install, almost the same thing at a Honda dealership, the dealership wanted $230.
B00K2MYPMU|4|product is well built, was shipped quick, am please with how it works and the blue backlight
B00BSV76CU|4|A+
B00BV13YRS|5|Fits well to my '03 GL1800. Make sure you have appropriate tool to extract old bearings before you start. You may need internal bearing puller for that.
B00P4K2AOA|5|Very nice product!
B00HVHG8D8|5|Perfect.  Fast shipping. Thank you.
B002P8DHFK|4|Had to buy it after I foolishly tried to melt the 15 year old manufacturers glass adhesive off of the plastic on my stove. Haha.....<br /><br />Fit perfectly and works fine as a cheap replacement but it really shakes like hell (fine for intersection turns, very difficult for highway lane changes) when you're driving no matter how tight you screw it in. This may make it too annoying to have this permanently but I only had the truck another month after installing this so oh well.
B00L6XZU0A|5|I received my replacement keyless entry for my Rav4 2007 today.  I copied the key in Homedepot and I had a bit of a problem with the programming.  Anyway I used these instructions from you tube and in under 2 mins my key was programmed and working https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQmpLjYryRw .  I just ordered another.  If I could give you  10**** I would.  Thanks a million.
B008KZKGIS|5|These do fit a 2009 Hyundai Sonata perfectly, but the 2009 has only latch pin instead of two, no big deal.
B0015KR14C|1|This bottle arrived 1/2 empty, after reading the reviews it seems like this happens all the time.
B001G6K3SQ|5|Worked great.  I can park on hills now!
B00REAPZCC|5|super bright good fit
B00K8E0WAG|5|Good buy
B00W0S23R8|5|Great pruduct
B007KOC19C|5|This is the product to get if you have an etch mark or haziness on your windshield. Wet a Bounty paper towel, dab it in the powder and rub over the area. May take a few few minutes to clear the haziness.
B000C2YCI2|5|Great product !
B003NDFEC0|5|Made the inline conversion on my 2004 Land Rover Discovery II a snap.  Works great.
B000CRER3C|5|Great product !
B0060A9IDO|5|it was a perfect match and fit for a perfect price.
B00UHDU3FW|5|👍🏽
B000BEZNSO|5|I wish I put one of these on my RV a long time ago. Who care if the faucet is plastic. It works fine. Well worth the money.
B0055AZN3O|4|works good
B0002JMDFO|5|It just seems to shine my car.  It's not like any other detailer I've used.  I love it!  I really can't say how or why it works but, it does.  I use other spray waxes and paste wax.  This spray just really seems to compliment all of those.  My car looks beautiful.  :)  It is almost 8 years old.
B0013FXXGE|5|Perfect on my'06 GMC
B00PAIMXLQ|5|These suction cups  work exceptionally well. I can think of many other uses for them other than with the Gen-turi exhaust diverters. Good product and a fair price.
B0009N30GE|1|All it did was leave red pieces wherever I used it to dust in the car. I threw it away!
B00KYWJ460|3|This is for the H4 Engines, not H6. Please update amazon product fit. This said it was a fit for my 07 outback 3.0 h6 ll bean, but was not.
B00KY0B4FQ|5|Works so far. Exact match and a great price!
B007TYKFKU|5|Both the headlights and taillight fit like a glove and was a perfect match to the original lights.  I was very satisfied with both products.
B013HKDWLS|5|Ordered this grille to help enhance my factory grille.  I was a bit concerned of gaps or not fitting correctly.  I was very impressed by the quality and the final fit.  This grille made the truck look like it should had come off the assembly line this way.  In my opinion, the best looking overlay grille on the market for this truck.  And for the price, you can't go wrong.
B00N399XVW|5|seems well made does what it supposed too
B00882F9JE|3|Fades quickly in the sun and is a little grindy metal to metal. Overall I'm happy though considering the price.
B00QLDI9N0|5|Very nice
B00RKE6BYI|4|Works as expected.  Would have gotten 5 stars, but the units are not labeled on the display and no instructions or other documentation provided.
B00DM9SGZW|4|Putting the new bushing was easy because I went to Auto-Zone for a free rental bushing installation tool. Getting the old bushing out was HARD!
B00PJ4WTJW|5|Perfect! Peeled off easily onto my rear window and has held up great for the last few weeks. Just what I was looking for.
B005H12SZ2|5|look great, work well, easy to install
B003AMLKIQ|3|Does not come with O-ring!
B00GD6SS40|2|so small for the price
B0016KJ5MC|5|Wasn't a Reese however, almost identical and works well.
B00BWTW40W|5|fit great !
B000K05U1O|5|The  ac aelco 16181655 gm original Equipment front speaker was a perfect fit and has a perfect sound and was easy to install<br />and a lot cheaper than the gm dealer
B00L4HCMDG|4|High quality locking straps.  Smooth locking mechanism that locks easily when slight downward pressure is applied to the lock.
B00FADDOL4|5|I installed two of these, and learned different things in both installations. First, depending on the approach you take, you can put it just on the middle brake light, or you can have it flash all three. With my daughter's Jeep, I simply installed it in the middle brake light housing, and she was none the wiser. In my Prius, I tracked down the wires for the third brake light to the front driver's side kick panel just inside the door, and decided to install it there. What I didn't realize is that the wires that control the third brake light also control the other two, so I have all three blinking on my Prius. It is definitely more noticeable with all three LED brake lights flashing.<br /><br />In both cases I opted to program the module so that it blinks once briefly at full brightness, then stays on steady. I wanted a very brief flash, something that would get people's attention briefly, but not scream &#34;pull me over&#34; for having a red police strobe on the rear of my car.<br /><br />Like others, I soldered a cylindrical momentary contact switch on to the two white leads and wrapped it in electrical tape. (What can I say? We geeks have these things lying around.) I also inserted a two position switch (&#34;on on&#34; because you definitely don't want an &#34;on off&#34; or an &#34;on off on&#34; switch, cuz when it comes to brake lights, there shouldn't be an &#34;off&#34; position) in line, in case I get pulled over. I'll just switch it off and then say, &#34;Officer, you must have been seeing things, or maybe I double pumped the brake pedal. Seems to be all better now&#34; ;-)<br /><br />Finally, I want to clarify a comment made by another reviewer. It is true that the third option in the BIOS does not work according to the documentation. If it worked as the docs say it should, it would simply flash the LED at full brightness &#34;n&#34; number of times, where &#34;n&#34; is the setting you've chosen. What it does, however, is more intuitive: Each press of the white wires together results in the LED actually flashing at the intensity level you have chosen. Think of it as a WYSIWYG interface rather than a binary interface.<br /><br />Parting thoughts: 1. Provided they're configured like mine, they really shouldn't be against the law here in Connecticut or anywhere else for that matter, but as of August 17, 2015, they are. 2. If you don't have LED brake lights, don't bother with this. The rise time of incandescent bulbs is too slow to allow any kind of strobe effect. And 3. It really is small enough to mount anywhere, including a crowded wiring harness in a small car like the Prius.<br /><br />One more installation tip: The kit comes with two pairs of male and female shielded connectors, and if you're thoughtful about how you use them, you can make it very easy to uninstall this device. Simply use a female on one side of your brake light wire, and a male on the the other. Then, if you want to uninstall it, simply pull the spade terminal out of the wiretap on the ground, which remains completely shielded, and pull the relay from between the two ends of your brake wire. Then connect the two ends of the brake wire back together, (that connection is also fully insulated), and you've essentially returned your vehicle to factory condition without even using any tools. (People who put both males or both females on the relay, and both of the opposite gender on their car, are going to wish they had been a little more thoughtful when they go to uninstall.)<br /><br />Excellent product! I'll be buying more.lts in the LED actually flashing at the intensity level you have chosen. Think of it as a WYSIWYG interface rather than a binary interface.  Parting thoughts: 1.

B00EA0ZB7I|5|Very pleased bright both worked great. Shipped extremely fast. All around awesome. But.... I hope they have been sealed correctly and are water tight would hate to ruin another set the same way as my last ones but really good product great price would recommend.
B0002Z9KE0|5|Works great on my Fl70
B00HTA8O9S|1|This is a (WAY OVERPRICED) way to make a connection . If you plan to be hooking up a temporary electrical connection I guess it serves as a reusable crimp. does not make a good permanent solution though. And its made very cheaply VERY small and threads will strip easily if you try to tighten to much. Also the end caps you screw on to tighten the wires down are EXTREMELY small and easy to lose. And if you lose one of the caps the connector becomes USELESS and for a buck or more a piece that can become a real expensive problem....SAVE  your money these are way too expensive and M/O a bad choice for an electrical connection.
B00D9GUDVI|5|Works great so far after 2weeks
B00N6AT4YY|5|Very bright and clear, way better than any cheap LED light replacement for a 3157 bulb. It also fits snug and is of fantastic construction, worth every penny in my opinion.
B000FW4MNO|4|Seems like just as good as the Permatex but in a larger bottle at a far lower price per ml.
B001VC27G6|5|Previously had a very expensive roll-up metal cover.  It broke after 4 years.  In researching new types of covers, the Lorado Low-profile Roll-up looked easy to install, had good material warranties, was simple to operate, and has super clean lines.  It is easy to open and close, and I am very satisfied with the value and quality of the purchase.
B0007VFM8C|5|Exact fit!!
B007EF20GQ|5|Vinyl applies and smooths out easily and The fact that it is breathable and allows small bubbles to disipate is fantastic. Note that this vinyl is incredibly thin, almost to the point it feels fragile and easy to stretch. I did have scraps and they pull without tearing, but I would only use this to decorate/decal or cover things, not necessarily to protect.
B00TACQ6L6|4|Great quality solid brackets
B001Y8LA74|5|Used for the flooring in a gazebo
B007J3EF1G|5|Got here early love it perfect size
B005ZYFYH0|5|Perfect fit !!!!
B005J1UK6O|5|This is a good heavy duty jack.  We got 4 and replaced the crappy ones that came attached to our rv trailer.
B006T8L2KY|5|Works just fine!!!
B0009NUG66|3|Drove from Fort Collins Colorado to Minnesota.  We did have some small tears on the top near the back forming.  Had to put duck tape over them to continue the journey to North Carolina.
B00HXJKFZ6|5|Great helmet got a tinted visor and now everyone says it wicked people alway tell man that's like from halo
B005QIC9QE|4|So far so good. I like the access this helmet provides. It's comfortable and easy to use the features provided. The sunshield is cool and the comfort factor is a plus.
B009ZQ12F2|3|These work wonders for strapping things to the too of my car.  The rubber grips on the handles fell off when I touched them, but they aren't necessary for use.  Biggest complaint would be that the straps can fray and unravel if you get them too close to the sides.
B00HNA9ZYM|1|This scanner does not work with OSX, despite what the description says.  Rio Rand web site confirms this scanner does NOT work with OSX.
B003SNQYX8|4|Worked as it should. Inexpensive
B0094E0FGW|5|Highly recommended for the Bestem top boxes....it keeps my helmet from getting scratched and fits the top box perfectly!
B009NOZ5BI|5|Bought these along with other size festoon bulbs and T10 bulbs as a replacement for those Chinese grid-type LED lamps. While the Chinese LED lights made the car's interior way too bright, the Philips made it look more upscale. While light output is not as intense as before, it was enough to light up the car's interior. Color temp looks more like 5000K than 6000K, it was spot on for me. Overall a thumbs up for me.
B0044XHW6O|1|Pure garbage I ordered 2 first one broke while installing I thought week must have been my fault. But then the second one broke in car wash. I go to this car wash all the time it is bran new and has never damaged anything b4. Please don't waste your money on this garbage they will break
B00ISA47FI|5|Item received as described, thanks.
B000FW7V50|5|With most gas blends nowadays having less detergents and more and more vehicles having fuel injection, this product is almost indispensable.  We use it in all our vehicles and have not had the customary repairs that neighbors and friends have had on similar vehicles at similar mileages.  We take many longer trips and on those we take this fuel treatment to add in each gas fill up.  Some gas you obtain on the highways are not the best and this helps the gas to burn cleaner and keep the fuel injectors from clogging.  Anything such as this product which can reduce repair costs on your vehicle is an excellent idea, and to purchase it at gallon quantity and its volume savings, it is a very good idea.
B000765MHI|3|works great but the switch is totally cheesy and will break real easy.  but fan does blow really good.
B00M8L65JE|5|Awesome , brilliant , the brightens day and night are great . i recommend it for all edge owners much better than the original one
B00D3YEGO6|5|This frame is absolutely gorgeous!  The rhinestones sparkle like they are the highest quality (and I know rhinestones, I was a competition dance Mom for years) and they are set in the frame, not glued on top.  Very happy and pleased with this product and would recommend it to anyone!
