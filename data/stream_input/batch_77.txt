B00BOPMR2E|5|Awesome hat. Kind of wish the D on the side was a bit bigger or they had one on the other side, but that is fine. Great hat. Nice stitching, great quality hat. Looks better in person.
B00O8RQ73K|5|Super comfy and roomy for my little boy. I swear these are the only ones he can wear that he's not constantly yanking on. And they look WAY adorable.
B009FSVS8G|5|This dress was pretty true to size, even though some reviewers have noted small.  My daughter is pretty thin and it might be tight for someone who is in the growing stage where a little rounder.  Some have noted quality issues with the fabric.  The fabric had a cheaper feel to it when out of the package, but felt better after a cool water wash with delicate detergent.  It washed well and looked great.  It was a hit with my daughter, so it was a great spring pattern.
B00HEE9UCY|4|very good
B001G746A6|5|I got nothing but great remarks on the shirt
B00GS5RDOW|5|It was a hit...
B00S2B1WTW|3|Fabric very thin
B00551PZ68|5|Great comfortable bra that doesn't let you sag.<br />Keeps you shapely under all types of clothes.
B00DHGGIIW|4|The fabric is soft and comfortable.  I like my nightshirts roomy so I ordered the medium but returned it because it was huge.  I then ordered a small but wish I had chosen the extra small.  It is still quite big on me but I decided to keep it.  Definitely order at least one size down.
B005HG58R2|5|I liked these leggings very much even though they were too small. They were made out of very durable material and they were very stylish.
B00S5K0KVQ|5|Just got this in today and I love it! I had read in the comments that it fit small so I ordered a medium instead of a small (my normal size) and it fits very comfortably. I would recommend that you order a size up from your normal size. I ordered the Charcoal and it looks exactly like the picture. It's very soft and snuggly and a perfect sweater jacket for cool weather.
B00L4FUGMC|5|Loved this product. They fit my son and it was an affordable two pack. I was paying less for these two packs then I was for similar pajamas that are sold separately. I think they are slightly thinner though, but I live in Arizona so I don't need a whole lot of warmth, just some during the winter.
B0088FT3G6|3|Not bad but not quite what was expected. Larger than  as advertised. Acceptable
B009S3I8AE|3|I returned this dress. It's a great color but it doesn't fit well if you have large breasts. It zipped up except fir the last 3 - 4 inches of zipper. This dress was also quite long - I'm 5'7\\" and would either need to hem it or wear 4\\" heels. I think this would be perfect for a a/b cup bra wearers. 38 d not so much.<br />It was very easy to return, so it wasn't a problem!
B00A2Y1904|5|Functional and cute. It was right size for my 8 year old girl. She  loves it and enjoyed using it.
B00AJ35D5K|5|it is ok
B00FOMVA7Q|4|Nice quality sock.  Would get the Large for a size 9.5
B00BFQ3HU8|4|I thought I would try buying off the rack everyday jeans online.  The jeans are not top quality - I don't expect the pockets to last long as the material is very thin.  The button hole was too tight on arrival but I managed to loosen it up enough that it works now.  All in all, I think they're good enough for this price.  I think You'd have to pay a lot more to step up in quality.
B005L9DKLQ|4|these stitchings look pretty legit! used them for a Sally costume (nightmare before Xmas sally).
B00AY7T38O|3|The floral jacquard pattern on this dress is lovely, however, I expected the material to be more substantial than it was...at least for the price.  The material was somewhat lightweight, I thought it would be thicker.  It was lined with cheap looking flimsy lining. Anyhow, its a pretty dress.  But I expected more for the money.
B00MGSOD8Y|5|Love these dresses. Very soft and cute!
B00T018WDM|2|Waaaayyyyyy too small. He is 5 years old, 50 lbs, and it would of probably fit him when he was 3. I ordered a size 6 when he is wearing a 5 because I seen others say it ran small. Didn't realize it was that small. But the the design, that's why I gave it stars.
B00GBMC5KY|5|Came fast fits really good and looks amazing!
B009DJCJB2|5|You get two. The price is very good also.  I usually spend more on just one.  Great for some of my dresses I brought and the straps do not show on the back.  The color one is nice also.  Comfortable!  Love it!
B004SWJ22S|4|We love the jacket but large seems to be too small and we need 1 size bigger! Everything else is perfect!
B007KHEH2I|5|My recently turned 21 year olds love these for quick id cash holders for shopping and other activities.
B00LU2PPES|5|NO WRINKLES and comfortable.
B00EOAZTXK|4|as expected
B00DSNOG9W|4|Nice fit and looks good on my son. Not too big and not too smsll. He's gotten many compliments.  Good for the price.
B00AYQEJ3O|1|this dress isn't for women this dress is size for girl,<br />size isn't right<br />you offer for women and this dress is girl clothing<br />smaller and isn't apricot is gray color really i return and i want refund my money because i want a dress for women real size
B009SOHXOA|5|The wig looks exactly as does in the product pictures. It's easy to style and brush. It even came with a free wig cap! Definitely one of the best quality wigs I've ordered (and the cheapest).
B00IYI1FS6|4|Like it so much. Wearing it now actually.  Package arrived before scheduled date which is always a plus!
B001H0F6HO|3|Legs a little short
B00N9YLTHM|5|I read all the reviews to buy a size up. I did and it fit perfect! I normally wear a small but medium was perfect for this sweater.
B00F3LN3ZU|1|They were so cheap and way too big for my kids. The ear part covered the entire Side of their face and was not fitted enough to stay on. Definitely do NOT recommend.
B00ID4RG98|5|Most comfortable sox  ever owned.
B00FDMURU8|3|Button fell off as soon as i tried it on the first time. I saw some other people commented with the same issue. I also thought the bottom could be a little bit tighter for a small. I was also not a fan of the pads in the top part, it didn't look natural but i still think it's a cute swimsuit and I will still wear it.
B00128KJ82|5|Edit:  I have to change my mind on this bra, I am able to wear it comfortably now on my runs and I really do love it. It does run small, but I really am able to wear it and it holds everything in where it should be. I'm pretty happy with it now so I've changed my rating from 2 to 5 stars!
B00TSPXYWO|5|I have a sweating problem and still sweat with these on. They keep the sweat inside my armpits and none of it come through my shirt. I think it's worth the $25 dollars to to fix a problem some people struggle there entire lives with. Sweat all you want, but don't sweat at at work. 5/5.
B003SFYEOM|3|Finger tips starting to shed slightly,and I'm only using them to drive.Good fit and very soft,best feeling gloves I ever  had
B00ODOAPZ4|4|My husband normally wears a 2XLT or 3x in shirts, so I got him a 3x in this coat.  It's very large on him, but he's discovered that in the sub-zero windchills, the coat keeps him warm, and the too-long arms are also great for keeping his hands and wrists covered.  There isn't much thickness to the coat, but it seems to be sufficient for the person wearing it.  The parks looks great, and is certainly long enough to keep one's backside covered in the cold wind.
B003SL0O3G|5|well when I bought this key chain its actually cute when u see with Ur eyes. its an amazing product and i really like because I'm a Lucky Star fan and she's my favorite character. even if I'm a guy it doesn't matter, its great for anyone who's a fan.
B000KAFOH4|5|I was looking for a solid red tie for my husband for Christmas and this one was just wonderful.  Great quality and a lovely shade of red that looks great with dark grey, navy and black.  I would recommend this tie to anyone who wants to make a power statement in an interview.  Very classy!
B00GROHJHK|3|Too small! It fits more like a SMALL (where it was supposed to be a medium) If you're going to order I'd say order at least a size bigger than what you normally wear! Other than that big problem... it looks nice.!
B001RBD2JC|4|I certainly like these shorts but be careful when ordering. These seem to run a little big.
B002459NIO|4|I get compliments on this top all the time. Its very flattering. My only issues is that its not long enough in the back so when I bend over im constantly pulling it down and I hate the pocket... its like a hoodie pocket and everything falls the center and makes you look bulky.
B00ENLQ55G|5|Great product
B008YWF8KS|4|they are good, comfy
B001C1IREW|5|Love love love!
B002JP2VKQ|5|As NCIS is my favorite t.v. show, I was happy to see all the t-shirts that are for sale at Amazon.com.  I love this one of all the cast members.
B009NA6JF8|5|Fits well and wears long.
B00Q9BX26S|5|Great fit and a black that looks black. Goes with everything. Going to buy other colors.
B003VQQYDW|5|Great price for such a great pair of trousers. I bought them for my husband and they fit perfectly - true to size
B00P3GSNZA|5|My wife loves this blouse.
B002CF6IHU|4|I have to have socks with a mostly cotton content, so these were perfect for me.  I recently bought some vibram five fingers and wanted socks for them, but I find that I wear them all the time.  These have an arch band that hugs your foot.<br />I will definitely be buying more!<br /><br />Pros<br />* COTTON!<br />  I have sweaty feet (sorry I know, gross!), and they wick moisture like a dream!<br />* I have normal shaped feet and they fit me very well<br />* Variety of very nice colors<br /><br />Cons<br />* Not for extended wear<br />  I would not wear these if you have a lot of walking to do as they will probably move and cut into you somewhere.<br />* Because they wick, you cannot wear them everyday if you have dry feet.<br />* May not fit imperfect feet<br />  This is a downside to all toesocks
B002APVGKQ|5|Just like I used to buy at local big name clothing stores, but easier on the wallet. Will buy again when I wear these out. I only wear Docker slacks... these are first run, great qlality.
B00HF4NJ2U|5|The scarf was just as it was advertised. What I liked most was that it wasn't so bulky like some are.  The dots are super cute &  I will be able to pair it with plenty of things!
B00B6MZ9Y8|3|I had to return/refund this item the day that I got it, which was no big deal because it arrived ahead of schedule. If you're any bigger than a 32C I highly recommend you don't order this top. I am a 36C and it was entirely too small even though its a \\"large\\". Also, the clasping in the back is made of two plastic pieces that slide together to snap. Should be made of metal. The material was nice. The padding (that can be removed) is very nice, comparable to Victoria's Secret padding. I give it a three because of the unhelpful sizing and the plastic snap. Other then that it was a great top.
B00NEJZP1I|5|Great!
B00CMLRJJU|5|MY HUSBAND  REALLY REALLY.. LOVE IT!!!!!!!!.. I BUY MORE MORE .. ACTUALLY I BUY MORE NOW... :)<br />RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT GUYS.. I AM SURE U WILL LOVE IT TOO.. :)
B005GW0XDG|4|This is a nice tee shirt but I was hoping for something a bit thicker for fall, which I thought I got when I bought this because the sleeves were longer. However, this material is thin like a tee shirt. Sizing is good.
B00K00ZEBK|2|The sizing on this costume is misleading. I purchased the 3x/4x, but it looked like it would fit a 10/12(or even an 8.)I'm 5'5\\" and this costume was short enogh to be a shirt.And zipping it up..forget it! This costume is adorable,but if you're a 14 or more,then pass it up.
B000F32MXA|3|Bought this on a whim. It is pretty but not a good purse. It is basically a piece of pretty cloth with a zipper. If it had some more rigid structure and some separators, and a change holder I would like it better. Overall, it is a pretty buy and has attracted the attention of people when I pulled it out to pay something, but it is annoying searching for things in it.
B005PJ1TDS|4|Wear comfortable。Put on feeling betterve been wearing Levi 505's exclusively since the early 70's. They fit me perfect. I could just walk into a store and pick up my size and buy without trying them on. Best jeans around.
B004NIGF6I|5|Fits as expected, I purchased these in a small and I used to wear hanes size small underwear, for reference. They fit well with a good compromise between room and support.
B00INH5ZF2|5|Exactly what I was looking for! my Husband and I saw this in a small boutique and he fell in love with it! i went back later and they were sold out found it on amazon for cheaper than the store!
B00EMG3W12|5|a lit bit large, but for baby, i don't think it's a issue.
B00NKKJ25G|5|Great price
B00AVBFH9M|4|great for a costume
B00ACIG09K|4|Decent shirts but they look faded.
B00NO8SI9U|1|Cute mittens, however the liner of one of the mittens was SEWN IN BACKWARDS making the item unusable.<br /><br />I imagine this was a fluke, but this tells you something about the overall quality control of this item
B00AB7SUDG|5|Had the original glove from 5 years ago - lasted that long too.  Old gloves had silver e-tips on thumb and index fingers only and stopped &#34;working&#34; after 5 years.  The new design allows you to operate any phone using any finger, knuckles, or any surface of the glove.  Excellent fit and like that the gloves are a warmer design than the original.
B00ID1VREG|5|My daughter loves this coat.  It looks great and now my son wants one like it in blue or black.
B001GAD0YQ|4|the shape was what i was looking for and its right. loooking to buuuuy mooore haats thaats all<br />....bye next time
B00559Q4LU|5|I loved this for Halloween.  It fit me very well.  It has a tie so you can bring in some looseness...but it was a really easy, comfortable dress to wear.  The color was pretty much the same as the one in the picture.
B00QH75YTM|5|Good,I like
B00N5UNG7G|5|i love this!  I have the brief (which is more like a bikini) and the matching bra.  Both pieces are comfortable, and very attractive.  I really like the design, and the area over the hip is especially cute and comfortable.  Often panties cut in too much over the side of my hip/leg- but these are great!
B00FQE3YUS|4|I typically wear a large work or dress shirt (which can fit a little snug across my back), so after reading prior reviews, I decided I had better go a size larger than usual, so I got an XL.  It's not worth the hassle of exchanging, but it's definitely a size, or maybe even two, too big, and hangs off me with a wide neck opening.  And while the shirt is comfortable, as you can see from the product photo, it hangs loose and will be just about completely ineffective as a rash guard or a swim shirt.  Not sure if I'll purchase another one or look for a product that is more of a true rash guard.
B004WY8A5W|4|ii got the item sooner than i expected<br />but like it  will be using it soon when i get to the beach
B005UVTRFS|2|It is a cute shirt especially if you have a shorter torso.  For me, it was too short.  It is a really cute top and the crochet work is great but it's just shorter than I had expected.
B00CRMGUIU|1|Nowhere near the size I ordered. It's a shame too, because it was cute. I had to return it. 3XL? Maybe for ants. What a joke.
B006OL7WI2|5|I love this Dress! The quality, feel, style and more! I felt like a STAR for my party wearing this dress. I will use this company again!
B00HNN7JMY|5|nice tanks for boys
B0058ZR2CG|2|👍
B00OVBM2C8|5|Great product and design. Washed it and everything has stayed in tact :-)
B00OF27TEE|3|Not the best fit..
B00CF3C026|5|grandson was happy
B00D7VIADI|5|Great Merchant. Would use again.
B00NFDK5P4|4|The style is very nice, just as photo shows. The red is red-red, not pinkish, not maroon. It doesn't get 5 stars because it's not very wool-like. I think it's more polyester fleece than wool. There's nothing that indicates percentage of wool vs polyester. About the sizing. As indicated, the sizes DO run small. I normally wear a small or medium. I ordered a Large, and it fits--though SLIGHTLY snug through the shoulders, and a tad high in the waist. I am 5'4&#34; and weigh 125 lbs. I bought this to replace my black wool  Worthington coat of similar style, but it is not as warm. But then again a Worthington coat costs a fair amount more than this cute coat.
B00EC45JVK|5|The quality is very good, it is just what I need. Once again to buy this brand of something
B00CNCO6SK|5|I love this tiny outfit! And my husband does too! We have a stripper pole at home, so I put this on with some stripper high heels, and we have a great time! It is good-quality, comfortable – believe it or not, and I feel extremely sexy in it.
B00775JSRM|1|the pants and tutu fit great but the shirt seemed to be 2 sizes to small. I ordered a 6 and when it came both the pants and shirt said 6 but there was no way the shirt was a 6 my thin 5 year old could not even get it on. I would not recommenced this to others unless you could buy the shirt separately in a bigger size. piety so sad it was cute
B00DROR8OM|5|Awesome T-shirt
B000MWYBZ6|3|The cups were snug fitting, but DDD cup was as large a size that was offered on line so thought I would try it.
B002VFA8L8|5|Came early and was amazing quality. I'm really happy with the stitched in this. Wasn't quite sure how to put it on (whether it was iron on or not) so I just ended up sewing it on around the edges to avoid any problems with the stitches or the fabric of the shirt.
B00EXO5N9M|5|Very comfortable, good quality.
B00DF11Z00|3|I ordered this dress online but it was bigger than expected.  I ordered a new one and will update this post as soon as I have the next verdict.
B009M1QOBC|5|Perfection<br />MOLON LABE
B004Y6R5X6|4|I loved the way it didn't cling to my body but was flowy like it's supposed to be. The color is true to the picture (I ordered the brown dress) and it looks just like the pictures, the flowers are even in the exact same spot. The only thing that I dislike is that the tag is on the outside bottom left seam of the dress showing everyone rather than in the back hidden from view like most clothing. I can't wait for warmer weather to wear this out in the sun!
B00G3E66UU|5|Looks just as good in person. Got it as a gift for my boyfriend and he loves it.
B00A7G7MZI|5|Wanted to get this -- lots of great memories from my childhood at the Jersey Shore. Suggest everyone from our area get this shirt to support the cause.
B000MX3O8A|5|Good price.<br />Very comfortable, washes well, wears well and straps don't fall off the shoulders. Wide enough and comfortable back hooks.
B00CE32ATK|5|WONDERFUL I so comfortable
B000UJC2UW|4|Good
B003A8F92S|3|When I ordered the product I got a different item than what was pictured. If the plus size is different than the standard size, it should be at least noted somehere on the page, but wasn't. The product itself was put together well. It was a lot larger than I thought it would be. I returned it and got the standard size. That didn't fit but was taken out just enough for me. Be careful when buying that you are geting excalty what you ordered. The return was easy but when I ordered a new one, it took over a week just to have them take the money from my account and send out the new order.
B005FRKW88|4|not much really to say about these pants, they fit well and were nicely packaged, shipped timely fashion.  They were a little small, got a medium since that was the size I was told to get.  Turns out they run a little small, large would have been better for the gift recipient.  Knowing that, if you like sleep pants a little baggier, go up a size
B006SRTCTE|5|I purchased this for my son.  He said it was soft (not itchy).  He said it was the perfect weight.  It didn't make him feel strangled by added bulky clothing.
B001A40BPY|5|I bought these as a gift for my brother, which he loved!
B00JBEVO8S|2|Not boxer briefs, more like boy shorts style womens underwear.
B008XD3BAC|4|I wasn't sure when it first came out of the box, but after wearing it all over the place, I really like it.  it is very warm, has nice cuff and neck, and a great hood.  The only drawback are the big buttons on the front which are not easy to see in the picture.  The are like toggle bolts and not my favorite.  But overall, it was a good purchase and a great price.
B00J3D4XXU|5|fits good. ended buying more leggings. very comfortable
B00F1RN0MC|4|Slides up
B00DSY9G2S|5|Fit well. Comfy. I like the price. Came in the mail FAST and these will last a while. Very good deal.
B009NVYBHA|4|I bought this for my 12 yo son who is more like a size 10/11 and good thing I bought the 14 or I would have had to return it. They only last one year anyway(remember as it stretches it loses it's UPF so wash according to label) so I don't have expectations of keeping it longer than it would take for him to outgrow it. It is snug all over as it should be and the only drawback is it is a little long...better than a little short :)
B005A1JXL6|4|This is a lovely, comfortable bralette but at a size 32A it was too large in the cups for me. I would certainly recommend it for sizes 32B - 34C. Except for their Petites line, I find that Wacoal tends to run large in the cups.  It is also not very sexy in the nude color. I would recommend getting this in one of the brighter colors or in black, as this will compensate for the fact that it is generous in coverage compared to some of the younger fits in similar bras. The nude version looked sort of granny-pants on me, so I exchanged it for a black one.
B007FY1LNO|5|My kids loved their hats so warm and comfy!!!
B00BGGE6RU|4|My daughter loved it but it was too big. She wears Small but this looked like Medium.
B00MTW27FI|1|Great shirt but skinniest fit ive ever seen.  Seems sized wrong.
B004MNM87E|5|I love this shirt. I put it on and I can instantly feel the power of the Ford Mustang Cobra surge through my muscles.
B00CPUSQPO|4|Shrinks a little when washed in normal cycles so allow room for that when ordering but otherwise good product.
B00NB4QNJO|4|Beautiful romper, looks just like the photo--right down to the SUPER deep V. I will probably put a few stitches in it. I only gave it 4 stars because some of the stitching looks REALLY cheap and t showed up extremely wrinkled, which wouldn't normally bother me except there are no washing instructions on it either... It is very pretty but you get what you pay for.
B00EKQCG8E|4|I bought this for my husband. He's got a protruding rib so when he tries to ride any waves without wearing a rash guard, he gets pretty messed up and his ribs and belly end up pretty raw. He likes this particular top because of the color and the length of the sleeves.
B00EHPEN7A|5|These pants are exactly what I was looking for to wear with tunics and sweaters. They fit as I expected. I'm 5'4&#34; and 102lbs. I'm typically an XS or 00 so they're a tad roomy in the waist but not by much. They'll certainly work with long shirts. The material is great and can be dressed up or down:) love them!
B00IDO7NOG|5|This dress is beautiful
B000A3I3O2|5|This was a screamin' deal on a great jean-jacket. My old jean-jacket was becoming an embarrassment, and retail prices for one that fit well were crazy. Name brands selling for over $100.00. Found this Wrangler (good stuff) on Amazon at an outstanding price. It fits perfectly, and looks good. I am very pleased.
B00IO2RLIA|5|Great socks. They are light and not bulky and even have a brand name on them. They are 9.99 at Costco.
B006LTFV5I|5|I got this to wear to a comicon convention and based on the comments, it was a hit. Plus, bow ties are cool!
B00J5BD6KQ|5|After a medical skin peel on my hands, the skin is very photosensitive, and these gloves give the protection I need and don't look clinical. They have lasted through ten washings. I think I'll buy another pair right now.
B001W0ZH5K|5|These onesies are great!  I have other onesies that shrunk horribly when I washed them; the 3-6 month size wasn't any larger than the 0-3 month size.  The Spa Silk did shrink a little but are still true to size and really soft!  I recommend them.
B0104NU6WO|5|Very cute.
B00GTTJNM2|3|Rock on
B0073MLZ70|5|Wallet fits all i need an all the extra business cards i hang on to for whatever reason. Good quality, shipped promptly.
B00QF7L8G2|1|The picture in the listing is misleading. This Top is actually a &#34;jersey top&#34; cannot be work as a Jersey dress as in the Photo. I am 5 Ft 2inches and I bought an XL and it fits nicely but cannot be worn as a Jersey Dress even if I bought an XXL or XXXL this cannot be worn as a dress as it is made to be worn as a top.
B003CUQ7RK|1|The material is nice ,but for some reason they become completely shapeless after a few minutes of wear.These are nothing more then a pair of baggy boxers. The picture is very decieving,I should have sent them back. Subsequently I ordered a size smaller and the results were similar. The fiber they are using is not suitable for form fitting briefs.
B00ACIGVH6|5|Reasonably priced, and stylish too!
B00B796WAA|5|My daughter loves the BBC series Sherlock & was looking for a way to show her love to her fellow fans. This hoodie is it! it is very cozy & soft and great detail in the neckline, pocket stitching & drawstring... it's not your average hoodie- it's way cooler! and at a reasonable price! She loves it and now all her friends want one too!
B005SZK462|5|perfect
B00G2KE8C8|5|And covers the rear which I like
B0002UCES4|4|Postpardum use:  I have a squeem cincher, which works amazing and looks great, but I bought this to give me a rest from the tightness of the squeem. It's an okay alternative, but this makes me overheat and sometimes gives me stomachaches after eating. I loosened it, but it still gave me stomachaches -  not sure why. For the low cost, I still recommend as a nighttime postpartum girdle.
B00LLI1Y1Y|5|I love it
B00NBS2FM4|5|Very nice
B0053ER222|4|I recieved as ordered. Losing weight and wanted a lightweight workout top, material is comfortable, a little rolling up on bottom, and see through. I ordered an xxl and it fit me even though it fit me snug it still has some stretch to it so I can wear a sports bra under it. But that's okay because as I lose weight it will be looser, and have more flow to it. Its easy to throw a zip up or a light shrug over it if you want to wear it out. Looks great with workout pants or with a skirt. I would not put it in the dryer if you want it to hold its size. It's the type of material that shrinks in a hot dryer. But if you would like to wash it by hand or in the washing machine (remember) air dry it on by hanging it on a hanger or clothes rack. I bought these in several colors, I love to wear them. Just be aware of the laundering.
B00I1AM8DS|5|I posted a similar review recently for the hoodie version of this jacket. I found the XL to run a little big on the hoodie jacket and this was also the case with this XL non-hooded jacket, which makes me think I should size down if I wanted something more form fitting from this brand but the extra space leaves good room for layering. As with the hoodie version, this jacket also has the sherpa lining extend through the sleeves and in the pockets as well. If you zip it up all the way it'll cover your neck and part of your face if you really burrow into it, but it won't be snug as others have mentioned. The sand color was true to the picture and I look forward to many future occasions to wear it! (For reference, I am 5'11&#34;, 42/38/48 measurements. I generally wear 16/18 size tops, XL or 1X depending on the maker.)
B00ZX1C9NC|4|Fit better than I thought it would. Simple construction swimsuit. Little small for me on top and would have liked more padding but was perfect for the price.
B00LQNWRNS|3|The zipper is problematic.  It is tricky to get it to zip up or down and to engage at the bottom. The problem might be the pull.  It tends to get stuck in an off-center position and is difficult to straighten out.
B0037TMAZE|4|I loved the shirt - but I ended up returning it because it was GINORMOUS!!!  Didn't feel like waiting to exchange it.  Maybe I'll try another size some day because it was a cool shirt
B005VJUVWW|5|Great
B001C44FDG|4|Runs a little small, but otherwise seems like a high quality shirt. Haven't worn it much because it's one of those shirts you only wear once in a while but if I have any issues with it I'll update the review accordingly.
B00S62S3VW|5|Fit perfect!!  Company provided excellent communication and dress arrived quickly!!  Thank You!!
B002GRTXH6|3|THIS ITEM IS NOT AS LONG AS PORTRAYED IN THE PICTURE AND I AM NOT LONG WAISTED.  IT IS 100% COTTON AND I HAVE NOT WASHED IT YET BUT I HOPE IT DOES NOT SHRINK BECAUSE IT WILL NOT FIT ME THEN.
B00CZ6Q6DC|4|Great jean made in Romania. Great fitting legs, but a bit larger in the waist than the size specified  Over all great fit for slim muscular men.
B00M6DTB7C|5|This shirt was a huge success with our granddaughter. The graphic design of Elmo delivers just what a 2 yr old likes. The quality of the garmet is good. I would buy it again
B00JXRJHMS|3|It is ok I mean I don't love it but my daughter LOVES it so it is not my choice if you want it.
B00974AVI6|4|These seem to be of good quality.I have worn them for several weeks now and they are probably not quite a good as some that you pay 3 or 4 times as much for but,they are satisfactory for me.I will purchase more of them.
B00PVBUYH2|5|The t-shirt is very soft, being white they are a bit see through. The fitting is what we expected but we haven't washed it yet so I don't know if it will shrink later.
B008XL3LVS|5|was for my boyfriend and he loved it. he's a bigger guy so I got the larger size and it fit him really well
B00BM48FP0|5|I had shop for this specific shirt at several department stores without any luck. Similar items run around $45 to $45. Amazon provided me with what I was looking for at half the cost.
B0089DLVNA|5|This dress is cute and flattering, but $45 is overpriced in my opinion. It's a cotton-blend dress that is not really resistant to fading when washed. I've hand washed my dress everytime, and it still looks a little faded. I ordered black. My chest is a 36D and hips 39 inches, waist 29 inches. I love the way it fits. Hides my flaws. Love the pockets!!
B00NPV6GPO|5|Love it, went back and bought the white one. It looks really nice and fits perfectly.
B00A4H1IJG|5|Absolutely a great product, quick service!  I definitely recommend to anyone considering this purchase!!  Will order more for my grandson!
B00CR9TVAC|5|Love it
B00OS4B7AQ|3|Shows too much crotch for my taste. The back is super cute. if there were a style with more front coverage and same back coverage I would be love it.
B001O1UY1O|5|very cute
B00WBBA722|4|I love this thing. Yes its tight,  but I expected that!  It's bearable and doesn't bother me after the first day!
B0064YY8U4|2|Easy to put on and fit my bust ok, but there was zero control in the belly area. It was listed as firm control, but I would say its light control, if that. Lace and the rosewood color were pretty, though, but control is what I bought it for.
B00631VKNG|3|I have been looking for a cotton nightgown for ages and hoped this was the one.  Not to be.  Although the workmanship looks great and the details very pretty, the material is too thin for my comfort.  I would definitely need to put a robe on even to check on the kids at night.
B00QRBFJAC|4|A little bigger than I expected. I got these for my 10 year old, she is smaller framed so she is about the size of an average 8 year old, but these flop over when she wears them...even over her jeans.
B006ITNOQE|2|For the cost of this tote, you can get similar in the dollar store. Not worth its penny. It is small and advertise as true.
B00K7D2648|5|Very nice design and good looking fleece hoody.<br />Reasonable price and worth buying.
B00MHDXS48|1|I would give this shirt a 5 * review if a medium wasn't actually an extra extra small. I even checked the size chart to make sure I ordered the right size. Lame, so lame.
B007MFWRYI|2|I purchased two pair of these, and I can't wear them.  The quality seems to be okay, but the sizing is wrong.  I bought the same size I always buy, and they don't fit. They aren't just a little tight, either. They are too tight to button or zip.  Don't buy these unless you can try them on first.
B00OQIESDC|5|Bought for a teen....she loves the shirt. It is soft cotton, comfortable.
B008YGNSLK|1|This shirt was way to small . I've learned a lesson not to buy dress shirts online . I'm very disappointed and will<br />never buy another dress shirt online . There wasn't a return label and I gave the shirt to a buddy .
B006LN3HKU|5|I am a guy and I bought this for a friend of mines and she loved it and actually I loved it too so, Much so I couldnt wait till Christmas to give it to her so i did today. This got me so many cool points today.<br /><br />The Turquoise brought out her eye color and it is so vibrants ,the picture can capture how brilliant a color it is.<br /><br />The patterns are nice and its thick soft materials. She has worn it all day and has already used it in 3 different still.<br />You can actually wear the hood in the front and it looks likes it draped or a shawl/ cowl.<br /><br />Its cool and I am truly THE MAN!<br /><br />BTW I order it on Thursday Night and Got it today Sunday.
B008L56A3M|5|Very nice robe, well worth the money. It stays closed like it's supposed to, and the fabric is hefty enough to offer some warmth without being too bulky. I even sleep in it sometimes and I don't wake up sweating myself crazy in the middle of the night like I do with my fuzzy/overly warm polyester robe. The only thing to note that I was not expecting is that it is a *bit* baggy - but I am definitely a small, and as this is listed as a Small/Medium, I feel like I got what I bargained for. I actually prefer it this way, though. Makes me feel like I'm wearing a blanket. So, I'm not disappointed at all - just be aware that it'll be a little roomy if you're slight of frame.
B008MBOPJ6|5|Previously purchased this shirt in another color and love it. Needed a burgundy shirt for a special event and this was perfect. The shirt fits well and is very comfortable to wear. It also looks great with my suit.
B00822CPT2|5|I chose this size for my 4 year old granddaughter who is very slim. She wears them over her regular underwear when she wears dresses. We call them &#34;over pants&#34;.  The XL size is a very roomy fit for her but it still works fine.
B000V9P5TG|1|Worked great at first of course. They are hard to open but that was acceptable to me as I felt that it was more secure. After a month, one day I struggled to open one of the clips and the metal just bent. Now it doesn't even close.
B00HWX7ZLA|5|gift
B00PU0IVBU|2|The fit was TERRIBLE , Didn't fit at all .<br />And was a PAIN to return.<br />The company DID how ever nicely refund me , for less then i paid but I DID get a refund.<br />Just wasn't worth the hassle .<br />The dress how ever is BEAUTIFULLY made just , need better sizing.
B0081CZXU6|1|Bought it to go on vacation--had to wash it so many times to get the awful smell out of it--when I finally did it looked likeI wore it 10 times and never wore it once--wish I could just send it back--which is what I should of done as soon as I got it---
B00NY7HZTU|3|The material is thinner than I expected. Ordered a LARGE and it runs just a tad bit big, but I'm sure after washing and drying it will fit perfect.
B00E4GAE3E|5|Any little girl will love this dress, it is extremely full, she will look like a little princess. Haven't washed it yet, cannot comment on this aspect.
B004EF5GCY|4|No lines  or pressure on my husbands ankles. Only socks I've found like this besides diabetic socks , which are too loose GREAT!!!!!
B003ZJKMA6|5|Fits like a glove, the black is better than I expected
B00LQ98OFC|5|Nice fitting
B005PKPB7M|4|This little dress is very cute and appears to have been given attention to detail.  The fabric and trim is a good quality.  This dress costs a little more than some I have purchased from this same company.  I still feel it was a good value.
B00O542BAE|4|Good
B0065Q5WGK|5|This bra fits really well, has good support, and is very comfortable. The straps tend to curl a bit, but it's still my favorite.
B00E5PAIG2|4|Very cute and fun.  They were as expected and I am thinking about ordering a few more pairs.
B002D42TLO|3|Cute on! Comfy! But....<br /><br />Runs a bit tight at waist. If you do not wear junior sizes - many a misses size person do not buy these pants. Not made for a women shape, more teenage - no hip shape.
B00W1EDJXI|5|Give it to me in more colors PLEASE!!!!
B00FHO60P8|4|is nice
B002WV5SES|5|I love this hat not just during the winter months, but year round.  I get many compliments for it.  Also, the fur at the top interior portion of the hat creates extra warmth and isn't always found in other hats like it.  Definitely worth the extra money.
B0009GDA5C|5|A great pair of sweat pants at a great price.
B0054R2FXE|5|The wife loved it. I'll probably be ordering more in different colors. (Black was the first one I purchased.) Shipping speed i would rate as average.
B00M5J8RWC|4|Good quality material.
B004N0MEP2|5|I was really happy with the purchase,a and fast delivery!
B00FZK8HHI|2|It was really really big.  My mistake for buying clothes online.  I know I should have known better.  Amazon is an awesome place for jeans though.  So i am not bias.
B00GO0L0WW|5|These shorts fit perfectly. I am very happy with the way the fit and the fact that the material is light enough to not be hot. So many shorts that I find are thick and heavy, these are not. They are exactly what they are designed for, hot weather.
B007YLM8K8|4|Great feel. Soft. Size was spot on. Highly recommend.
B003U5V1VE|5|Product was exactly as described, received in excellent order and very quickly.  Very happy - will definately purchase again!
B0068EDHBQ|5|Arrived on time and was exactly as pictured and described.  It goes perfectly with the outfit I'm putting together to wear to a Renaissance Festival as well as a couple other dresses that I like to wear.  It's well made and holds tight.  Would definitely recommend it to others.
B00B2GENDG|5|I was looking for a tunic to go with leggings, and I was worried about this because the mixed reviews! But honestly, I ordered a large in the flowy style (055) Charcoal gray and it was delivered within 2 days. I was nervous to see it, but the shirt was perfect! The material is thick and the seams are solid (seems like it won't wear).<br />This is the cutest thing! I'm 5'9\\" and 175lbs so I got the Large. It fits me exactly how a tunic should, and the open shoulders and pointed ends are just too adorable. I was so excited that I got back on Amazon right after trying it on to order another one in a different color.<br />This was worth the money and I'm definitely going to wear it more than I should :)
B0051NHRI4|1|After the first week these jeans started ripping apart. Now they are completely unusable. Horrible horrible fabric. Please do yourself a favor and do not buy these. You will be sorry. My son wore them to school and came back and they are literally in shreds. I'd post a picture if I knew how to!!
B00KMZG4SA|3|The material and hat itself are pretty nice. The only issue is the size. It's a little small and even though it fits fine, after a while your head feels a bit squeezed.
B00CJGCH4U|5|This is a nice lb sweater! Very pretty and comfy! Love the feel and look.. And fits true to size!!
B000V6WNS0|5|would definitely buy again.
B00K0TSQW0|4|They fit great and the price was juuussst right.
B0078Z0TAQ|5|I'm not a small girl by any stretch. About 5'7&#34; and wear a size 18 pants. So, I was a little apprehensive about the &#34;one size&#34;....but it's perfect!
B00JB615GM|5|Fit very well
B009R8P1JQ|4|I bought this for our tacky Christmas Party. I am usually a medium in juniors sizes but I bought a large in this one and it was still a snug fit. I would recommend to go one size bigger than what you usually wear in juniors.
B00C40YDR0|4|Super confortable and fits great  Material is top quality.  Nice color, too and looks really great.  Not too tight and not too large.
B00BQA80ZA|3|Fit was fine but the pink color of the pants did not match any of the pink in the onesies.
B000AI5C46|5|Very nice soft leather. More stitches per inch than my old one. Nice grain and texture, not smooth and slippery like most wallets. I think this is a very good thing. Less likely to slip out of your pocket.<br />You get what you pay for. Three times the price of my old wallet. Seems worth it to me.
B00R4K6XYQ|5|satisfeira with the product
B00B1K2UME|5|Purchased this item for my 5 year old niece on her birthday.  The Cinderella Bridal dress was out-of-stock at the Disney Store and I was looking for a good/reasonably priced substitute.  After looking at many dresses, (loved many of the AMJ Designs), I choose this dress.  She loved it and it fit well.  I paired it with long child's gloves and a confirmation veil to complete the &#34;bride&#34; outfit.
B00A42J9LU|3|Good quality but they are not very long
B005Y14MH2|4|MY WIFE LOVES IT ON ME.  NOT RECOMMENDED FOR WEARING VERY LONG.  IT STARTS TO ICH.  BUT GOOD FOR FOREPLAY.
B009GERK5Y|5|The best bra ever. This bra is so soft, but still durable. I love it and it's pretty. I don't regret this purchase!
B00ACIGUBI|5|Perfect fit
B0085THIZS|5|My husband loves this shirt and it has replaced all of his ugly 'weekend' shirts.  Thank goodness.  He is always cold so the thickness also adds to his warmth.
B00D36O33I|5|Awesome glasses
B000QGFRZ6|5|great sock, fits correctly, great color, comfortable, looks great.
B000N64GGK|5|Been wearing Dickies unlined jackets for years.  Its a good lite durable jacket that keeps the wind off. I wear it riding my motorcycles, and also at work with a tie. Great for South Texas weather. Sizing was right on target.
B00ACIG09K|4|The shirts  are great just a little smaller than I thought
B009QSYIDC|4|I love the snap feature for changing diapers on this suit.  It means I can go to the pool with my daughter in her regular diaper and then easily change her to a swim diaper without the fuss of taking her suit off.  And, it's really cute on.
B0088B4V1M|5|This was a Christmas outfit for our little man and it worked out great! He looked handsome and you can't beat this price!
B001VNBA2M|3|I ordered a brown one. But what was my surprise to see a black one when i receive it. By the way, the label says brown!. I thought that in India people speaks english and would know what Brown means........
B0008EOR2U|5|We were a little worried that they would be too relaxed but they fit perfect!  We would definately buy these again.
B004OMKZV4|5|As a generously endowed beach-goer, I was looking for a supportive sports bra to wear under a tank-ini.  This was perfect - no bounce, good fit, doesn't itch or pull or poke or slip.  I recommend it.
B00LPAU2X4|5|This dress I love, it was somewhat small but I fixed it to suit my self thank u
B008ARIRW8|5|Perfect color,lite weight,feels like real leather
B00STNMTJ0|5|I am very happy with the quality and has a good price.
B00SQQTS6C|5|Great looks.....with plenty of pockets.....Love the retro look to the pants itself........just wish they'd make &#34;larger&#34; sizes for American waists......they would make Billions ! ! !
B00GO4JACK|4|I was looking for a sweater that was comfortable and no-muss. This is cotton, comfortable, it washes well, fits as I expected it to, and looks great on.
B008J1OBCA|1|No good Quality and it was really big was not for no babies or  toddlers  not happy with it bc I only put it on one on my baby and it even got even bigger that it was
B00JRME6N4|1|Shipping was fast but the size was way off mine didn't fit And cheaply made but you get what you pay for.
B006X132G4|5|Great feeling shirt.
B00C2URVE4|5|I dont know my head size but I think im a large. Probably a 7.5 or 7 for fitted hats. Either way its a snapback so you can change the size. But its an awesome hat and I get tons of compliments.
B004M6XUI2|5|I'm happy with it. I thought it would be bulky but it's quite slim and all the pockets for the cards is cool.
B00TCHUZOI|4|I'm 5'10&#34; and 152lbs. I bought the XL for my curves, after i read all reviews to buy up suze. Bottoms are crazy small, and I wear size 10. Top fits ok, but hoped it would be more flattering for my 36D. All and all I really like it.
B000LNE9R6|5|These work shorts are great.  Excellent cut for active working, loose enough to allow movement but not so loose as to get caught on things.  Plenty of pockets to hold your tools, phones, etc...  The leather cover on the pocket is a great idea to prevent wear from a tape measure or knife clip.
B00182DMSG|3|Too tight and small
B00IIK6T5O|1|Was wayyyy too small. Plus not enough hair on it. I do not recommend this wig
B00ARBTQA2|5|Love having a flexible belt for sitting.
B00B4HQ778|5|Love it. I was convinced I was Wonder Woman.
B007HC21E2|5|Grandfather is a retired fire fighter.  This was the perfect Christs gift!  Well put together, nice presentation, couldn't be happier
B00FSF0A02|5|The best product!!
B00126QOGA|4|good construction but they run a bit on the small side.great for showing off your&#34;stuff&#34;
B001AQNN0W|5|Product  Was More Than I Expected Iam. Very Happy With Product. Thanks !!
B00B17FI0I|2|This  sweatshirt was for me , but decided to give it as gift. It was much too large and the worst part is I purchased this because it was made in U.S.A. BUT  When received it was MADE IN CHINA!!!!
B00E0FHD38|5|bueno
B00B89YSZA|3|There is nothing wrong with the shirt. But the color shown here isn't the same as the color of the shirt I received. Close. But no cigar.
B002SDCEZG|4|I ordered these boots 8/27 and they arrived 8/30.  Fast shipping.  I normally wear an 8 so I ordered the medium (7/8) and they fit wonderfully.  I am so delighted that they arrived on time for my 70's cookout on 8/31.  They fit my calfs and I have muscular calfs.  I had not problem zipping them up
B0006U5HO8|5|Very comfortable and durable
B00LT7BVJM|5|Love these
B008KCK2VM|5|This was a Christmas gift for my father and he really loved it -- he opened it up and was wowed. He commented with pleasure that it fits just right, noting that when he buys jackets like this, the sleeves are usually too short, but not this time. Great item!
B00134AD54|5|I recieved this only two days after placing my order. It is beautiful, and was actually a little larger than I'd expected. The design is just delicate and very pretty. It was a great price and I recieved it very fast!
B00TUHDDOY|4|Great Product
B002YOVPLI|4|Fit as expected, warm and promptly delivered.
B00IRW8FVE|5|thanks
B00XZSGULC|2|..... The top is a scarf.... it's a cute scarf.... but it's not a top. Especially if ur a DD like me.
B00CQ6SUVC|5|ok
B00HX2CMXG|5|love the colour....and its really spacious inside for a medium sized laptop or tablet and couple of books. and if you want you can also take it for camping in the woods. giving it a 5 star review! :D
B006N11AOK|5|I have worn this item three times so far and have washed it once, I washed it by hand and air dried it to prevent shrinkage. there have been no tears or holes to show up in the fabric, this outfit is very comfortable and fit great.
B00BU8V4RO|5|Nice. Heavy fabric.
B00CB7TE4I|5|BELLISIMA
B003WC5QIO|4|Pros:  -Fits comfortably and has low profile even when full  -Soft, lined zipper pouches on both sides of exterior  -Does fit 15.6\\" laptop in laptop pouch despite that the eBags website says the laptop was too large (it gives a 15.4\\" max.)  -Several little compartments inside, including one that zips closed  -One easy access external pouch  -Fits at least a couple of regular sized textbooks and a binder   Cons:  -External pouch becoming unattractively frayed from Velcro closure  -Interior all black, hard to see contents  -The nice lime green color mostly in hidden areas  -Internal pouches sag inward and books can get caught on pens and whatnot while trying to put them into the pack  -No D-ring  -No external cell phone pouch on strap  -No external water bottle pouch (one would fit in lined pouch, but would have to be about 17 oz. or smaller which is not really very much water)    Overall, for about $30 this bag is a good deal and I'm happy with it.  I would not pay a penny more for it however.  I can't believe they initially sold this bag of a hundred bucks.  I would've been sorely disappointed and sent it straight back.  Since I feel like I got what I paid for I'll be using this bag hopefully for the next couple of years till I'm done with school.  As it is, I've only had it for about a month so I can't speak for its longevity, but it seems pretty durable.
B003EDRSTQ|5|This was a birthday present for a 7 yr old boy.  HE LOVES IT!  The fit is great and it washes well.
B0024YXG10|5|High quality leather. Stitching is perfect so the leather won't separate and tear.
B00CRXUTFY|5|Bought for Used at La Porte Indiana Little Theater Club
B003VEWDG6|5|My husband loves his pants......
B00BGORAYI|5|Beautiful soft comfy material
B004IK9CYS|5|I bought this dress for my high school commencement this year, and I was very impressed! It is very flattering; I just love the style. It is so hard to find a respectable dress these days. I was looking for a dress that had a decent neckline, wider straps, and a hemline that came to the knee. I love the scoop neckline, the straps are perfect- a very unusual style, and the length is perfect! I felt amazing in this dress, and it received approvals and compliments from my parents and grandmother. I hope I'll have another opportunity to wear it again soon; it was hidden under my gown for the entire ceremony, and I only got to show it off during dinner afterward. I LOVE this dress!
B00CBSYRG2|5|This little outfit is so cute. The fit is great and will be perfect for cooler weather. The quality is great and the price unbelievable!!!! It was a great buy!!!
B001D50GU0|5|just what I need out here in Alaska
B00D83XH56|5|Love it. Fits perfectly.
B00PKYVX48|5|Very comfortable, design is great, and so it the price. I'm really glad I got these.
B004ID2J2C|2|For one they slide around in your bra so unless you have a full coverage bra and/or a high cut shirt. for two idk about you but i dont think pointy boobs look Au Natural...having smaller boobs and wanting to look fuller/bigger i was expecting something totally different. Granit they do make them look &#34;bigger&#34; but when turned to the side they look pointy...Thats just not the look im going for.
B00SXKW9WG|4|Quality is pretty good, I'm satisfied.
B00I8MUOI0|4|love the material
B00JBAPVOA|3|Pants are fine but not great.  Ties to hold pants up are a joke.
B000IZ6W22|5|Made a great 'graduation' present for our child passing the Lifeguard swim test... Sturdy shirt with classic graphic that's survived many wears and washings!  Would recommend and buy again.
B00FQMUJNU|5|Just got this t-shirt and I really love it!  It's awesome!!!  The color is bright and lively.  The vest looks great!  And it feels super-soft.  I'll wear it this Christmas Eve and I'll look very chic and funny.
B005M7BBDQ|5|Son absolutely loved it
B00F2V7FHI|4|These leggins went pilly after the first wash. However, they are warm and I use them under my jeans in the winter. Even though they not look good, they keep me warm, so I'm relatively happy.
B00H8NSOJ6|4|The pants are great but run a little small
B00C9VN4ZG|2|Color was not as anticipated, and quality poor.  Does not cover ears
B000KK6964|5|Great product. Fits as expected. Nice weight. Don't even know you've got them on.
B0091EHGU8|5|Nice to have a new pair of shorts this late in the year. They arrived before you said they would and were the color I expected and I'm pleased with them.  I haven't washed them yet . Hope that  turns out okay
B00HUB0OYY|5|This was probably the most comfortable design I've ever tried on,. But, the band runs a little smaller than expected (I wear 34, but the largest hook on the 34 couldn't quite close). Still, too snug on the first try-on can be a good thing as the bra will conform to your shape over time, vs. the bands that ride up right away or stretch out over a few months. Loved the soft boning lines on the sides for extra support and keeping the bra in place.<br /><br />Cup was true to size for me, not too large. So, the D I ordered based on the reviews was too small (for comparison, I wear DD in Victoria's Secret & Maidenform). I would've ordered it in DD if they made it! So disappointed they don't carry such a common size in this design.<br /><br />If they have your size and you want a really comfy, supportive bra in a soft material, with a snug band that will stay in place and smooth any rib flare or back bits really well, order away! In your true size, though.
B00118VHF2|5|Great pair of pants & they do transition from work to leisure very nicely. I find it easier to find exactly the size style color etc I need thru Amazon
B002K6F7AA|5|This is my favorite sleep nursing bra! It's very comfortable and very easy to use. I find I don't have as much luck with it when in the side lying nursing position,  but every other position works very well.
B001D74GW2|3|This hat fits an adult, but is small and a little shallow to wear comfortably.  I love the look and style.  I'll still use it for the photo booth, but I think the sizing is off.
B000UPHZB2|1|Ridiculous waste of money.  Removed the cap from its plastic wrapper and read the instructions.  When I put my hands into cap as instructed, the entire thing ripped in half before I even got it to my head.  I did not pull too hard....it literally almost fell apart upon touching it.  Disappointing doesn't begin to describe this product.  Rip off is more like it.
B00J2UP86K|5|DEFINITELY RECOMMEND. It's VERY snuggly and warm, it came right on the estimated delivery date as well! Also, there was a baby kangaroo! But the baby was REALLLLLLY flat, almost like a washcloth. But that doesn't matter, I'm satisfied with my order! There WERE a lot of loose, white threads at the end though. I'm hoping it doesn't rip!!!!
B00D8RZKTS|3|I chose the black skirt for my daughter. The fabric is shiny, almost iridescent - diaphanous in effect. So lovely. However the waist is quite tight; it will have to be expanded to be wearable. Daughter is 5' 8, size 8/10, and the skirt falls an inch or two above her ankles.
B00AZGLU44|1|shows a lady wearing these belts but they fit my 8 year old grand daughter
B00CZ7U02E|5|A very comfortable, yet supportive wire free bra. I own several in this style and am always on the lookout for additional colors.
B008DS1M2Q|5|This was a gift to my sister, and she just loving this dress. She height around 1.65 and she love it
B002IRGO3U|4|My sister n law celebrated her 65th birthday with a 70s theme. When I recived my disco jumpsuit I was pleased but little did know I would win first place! I had fun thanks to my outfit.<br />The quality was good and fit well. Just a little too long.
B00MHGVO5K|5|The size 4 fits my average-size 3.5 year old well -- some room to grow, but snug enough due to drawstring. Nice turquoise color.
B00KC2QJFQ|5|Very Happy!
B00LO9EA2U|5|I got it last week! Forgot to put a review til now. I love it! Perfect and as I expected it would be. I'm a pretty small and petite asian girl. Though I had a feeling that if I picked the small size, it was going to be really small, so I picked large just incase. I wore it and it's pretty loose (I should have picked medium maybe) but I still like it very much. If you are like me, I would pick medium maybe, but if you are like me and like loose jackets, then I would pick large. Overall, very happy and satisfied. Thank you!
B0061U5P58|5|For the money, this hat is tops! VERY warm. Looks cool and fits great!<br />I love wearing it around town or working outside around the ranch.<br />Everybody should own one.
B00FSB5SBW|5|I'm height 6', weight 183 lbs., waistline 37\\" (measured at the navel). I workout almost daily (cardio and/or weights). My casual and dress slack size with most brands is waist 34\\" x inseam 34\\".<br /><br />A couple years ago I bought a new pair of Champion jersey pants in size large and color black. They had a nice, soft feel, but they were far too baggy for use other than for lounging inside the house. I also didn't like their white pockets, and considered their elastic ankles to be a bit dorky looking.<br /><br />Then, early last December I sent my wife the URL for this web store page, as she wanted ideas for my Christmas gifts. I suggested that she consider for me this open bottom version of those other pants, but this time not in size large. I asked her to get me size MEDIUM and color black. So 6 months after Christmas I'm still 90% satisfied with her gift.<br /><br />I'm dismayed to read that the cheap 2014 revision of these pants now has its elastic waist band unenclosed with fabric. I'm glad to have received 3 pairs of the earlier revision last Christmas. The elastic waist on my pants is completely enclosed in cloth. Unless Champion switches back to the previous revision (that I currently own), that could be a deal breaker for me when I need replacements several years from now.<br /><br />They make a perfect loose fit; not tight, not baggy. The material is so thin and pliable that the fabric kind of hangs close to the body. The previous pants that I mentioned earlier (size large) had just too much material to produce the same fit as these do in size medium. The elastic waist stretches comfortably on me with plenty of expansion to spare. It's not necessary for me to use the draw string at the waist. And the pockets are NOT stretched a bit open during wear. My version of the pants are cut such that when they are flat on a table:<br /><br />  Waist-to-crotch 13\\"<br />  Width of leg at crotch 13\\"<br />  Width of leg at knee 10 1/2\\"<br />  Waist, when stretched tothe maximum limit 22 1/4\\" (remember that's flattened out)<br /><br />Trust me, these MEDIUMS don't look like they have an oversized 45\\" waist when I wear them. They produce an athletic fit on me!<br /><br />So when I wear them at the normal level (not high like an old codger, nor low like a teenager) the crotch hangs with a couple inches of comfortable clearance, which is ideal for exercising, as I can do yoga type stretching to my maximum range of motion. I wear these pants to the gym and change out of them immediately afterwards.<br /><br />I'm careful to wash them only in cold water, and after the spin cycle I hang them out for air drying, in order to avoid shrinkage. Well, after all the washings, so far I've observed zero shrinkage and the fading has not been noticeable either.<br /><br />Despite the roominess in the crotch, the seams there began coming apart after about 50 gym days. I permanently rectified the problem after going over those seams with 100% nylon lock-stitching.<br /><br />I like the look/fit of these pants. They don't hug my cheeks or thighs yet there is just enough contact that the pants never look inflated. And although the inseam measures only 32 1/4\\", the crotch is low enough that the cuffs hang to the same proper points relative to my shoes as a great fitting pair of street slacks of inseam 34\\". Now when I go to the gym I don't look like a bozo, but instead like a fighting machine.<br /><br />I prefer to minimize sweating when I lift weights and do other forms of high intensity training. So its thin jersey fabric (labeled 100% cotton) well serves my purpose for them, as they provide minimal insulation and maximal permeability. Way better than either heavy cotton or lightweight synthetic sweatpants. Only 3-4 months per year need I switch to wearing shorts.<br /><br />Considering that they're made only of thin cotton, I have no unrealistic expectations about how long my 3 pairs will last before holes start wearing through them. Champion can't design for everything. I'm happy with the compromise they made.
B00FRA0LFC|5|Compliments everywhere I go with this hat. Great fit, top doesn't stand too tall like some New Era hats. Chicks digg it. Satisfied customer
B005EOWP1Y|4|The only thing I don't care for the how bright it is. I guess I was expecting a more pumpkin orange but I still like the sweatshirt.
B008X8YSIQ|5|Just awesome and great price!
B009BKWE9U|4|Overall, it's serving its purpose.  The threads began to unravel a couple days after using it, but it is still in one piece. I love the price and I don't dread having to switch bags anymore.
B00ACIGWJI|5|It's underwear.  Just like that you buy in store.  No issues.
B00HW1TQLE|1|Very different than the picture. I Did not like it.
B0050AFYOM|1|Grande
B0064OTRE6|2|The socks look as described with thick cushioning, however the opening to the sock doesn't stretch very good and is tight on calves.
B00NMBS1O6|5|After reading several reviews, I decided to purchase this sweater. Some of the reviews helped a bit but none were specific enough. I order the M and very happy I did. I am 5'4&#34; and weigh about 125. I am curvy in all the right places so the M was perfect for me. I have received many compliments. Thanks Patty!
B001AVC9E8|5|[...]    I like the shape, both the bill and the dome.  I like the color because it looks official.  It has a velcro adjustment band, which is easy to use.  The fit is just right.
B002EB06N4|3|The footie looks very cute but once it is on the kid you will notice that the snap closure is not made very well. The snaps are too far apart so the knee of my baby peaks out of the suite. I really don't like this and it makes it seem as it is very cheaply made. Would not buy this again.<br />Simila issue we have had wit Gerber footies. I really like ABSORBA  and LAMAZE footies they are well made, nice material with real sizing.
B000FAHJ3G|3|Low rating probably due to my not knowing the different size for each seller/brand. They were are not comfortable to wear, but maybe one day I will not require such a big size!
B005UN7XBG|4|This item fit just great, and worked really well for my halloween costume this year. It was not quite as long on me as it shows in the photo, however. I am 5'10&#34; This came about 2-3 inches below my knees. It wasn't an issue, but if a tall lady is looking for a truly tea length petticoat this might not be the one.
B004OP2IL6|4|I am a size smedium, leaning towards medium, and the medium fit me perfectly. Quality of the shirt is better than I expected, but does seem a little thin so we'll see how it holds up after an extended period of wearing and washing. I can say that after a couple of months it still looks great. Great deal for the price.
B00OABMS8M|5|Love this bathing suit top.  Very nice fit.  Strap comes in handy, but nice to take off to get an even tan.  Wish more colors.  T. Cykosky 47 yr. old female.
B004QDNX1A|5|The mask fit my two and four year old great. The only thing i would change is that it had a little more cushion. where it touchs the face.
B00LGS3ZXO|3|I like this comfortable sweater
B008TWUZ6U|5|These are the best support hose I've found yet and I've used different brands for the past 8 years that I've been a nurse.
B00062NHB6|4|As expected.
B00KM37NXC|5|These jeans are a great fit for my tall/lean 16 month old! We used them in a barn photo shoot and he wears them often. The elastic is nice and I really like the fit.
B00S4SO3BC|5|Love this t-shirt. Looks vintage. Color is a very dark grey. Not black and NOT brown as the picture looks on my monitor. I ordered a 3X thinking it would run small. It actually runs big. A 2X would have worked fine. Thin fabric, but not sheer enough to be see-through. Very soft.
B00KRO0AJK|5|Gift from his grandchildren . He loved it!!!!<br />Very nice quality shirt, great idea!
B008VVQW9I|5|perfect for credit cards and cash, elegant. it was an amazing gift for a friend. she uses all the time and love the looks
B0085BACWM|5|Muy confortable y abrigadora la medida va muy bien no como otras que tienes que subir o bajar esta corre perfecta
B0064ES4WM|3|Great quality pants and great color.  Wish they fit right.<br /><br />I am a true 34L in pants.  Every pants i own that are from different brands are 34L and for some reason these 34L pants feel like a 36L.  They are litterally dragging on the ground by an 1-2 inches.
B00A46JRZE|4|Wish i could purchase the bottoms. Love the color and fit. How can i find them ? My fav happy
B003YJBYPE|5|These socks are great!!!!! they are thick, soft, and extremely comfortable.
B00N2P4QVO|4|My grandaughter loves this shirt, the color is perfect for jeans.
B00KLXDRGU|5|I ordered a Large thinking  it may run small but it is very true to size. Haven't worn ot washed yet so maybe it will shrink a little.
B005W0LV88|5|This bra is VERY comfortable.  I use them as sleep bras, but don't wear them out.  I have consistently ordered XL and I think a L would provide better support, without being too tight.  Comfort is my number one priority with this bra, and it definitely meets that need.  I like that it has a back closure, so that it doesn't have to be pulled on over the head.  If you're looking for a comfortable bra and don't need much support, this is it!
B00MPVP91W|5|50's day today and my daughter looked so cute in this jacket!
B00AYOFQHO|5|Good. I liked it
B00JQ8D4CI|3|well i order a XL, but it look more like a medium. did not return will just give it to my sister. but it's a  nice jumpsuit. if you wear between a L to XL, don't bother, an XL will not fit. runs really small.
B0057X86ZG|3|Good value for the money, but man - they are LONG!!!<br /><br />I ordered the XL's and was expecting them to shrink like most T's.  I'm 180LB & 5 '11, but they run really long.  I fit Fruit of the Loom & Jersey's in XL perfectly once they have been washed, but these guys still hang below my finger tips after a wash/dry.<br /><br />The other thing I don't like is that they have the brand's name \\"KEY\\" printed on the outside of the T-Shirt's back.  Where the label should go on the inside...  The pocket tag, sure, fine, but come on!  On the OUTSIDE of the back??? It's not like they're some designer T!  Even if it was a designer T, I would hate it.
B00MHGPRPS|2|They were good but too small I returned them. Also I ordered one pair and received two and returned them both
B00KZZ92JK|5|I am so happy with my new Kenneth Cole coat.  It's a tiny bit snug but the next size would be much too big for me.  The additional plus was that I purchased it on Cyber Sunday at the Cyber Monday discount and I got a great buy.  The coat is made very well and is super warm.  I could not have made a better purchase.
B00BF3ELEM|5|I love it. My daughter looks amazing in it.
B008A76AF4|4|they fit nice  im tall and there was enough room
B00CS6REVW|5|This short is extremely comfortably to wear. It is very short and shows you quads well. Great for the gym or at home.
B001G6VVH8|4|Was a birthday gift for a friend. The quality of the shirt and its print came out exactly as expected.
B001PZCWNW|5|The Car's patch is very cute and the quality is very good. It would look great on any little boy's clothing.
B00595JZBG|3|Size options list was  not available on web site.... I had to return a X-large and hope that the medium would fit but it's a little big.
B00EOLGY4C|5|Thanks Spreadshirts and Amazon my son loves his Glo Gang T-shirt
B00HDKYL0K|3|The glitter was all over the shirt, and not just where it was supposed to be.
B0064YY2RI|4|Soft comfortable lace stays in place, not too stretchy, I  like it
B004J1OSZO|4|The shirt fit my fiance, but it was a tad short.  Not a major issue for he said he was comfortable in it.
B00T2S6R3K|5|5 stars for customer service. The item was too tight on my 3 year old but otherwise nice material and its replacement is holding up well.
B008VPQOCY|4|As others have said, these are very lightweight - lightweight enough that I'd bet white ones would be at least partly see-through (I got black) - very slippery, very stretchy, and very comfortable.<br /><br />I'm 6' 1\\" with a 33\\" waist. I got mediums. They fit fine in the waist but are a bit short...not way too short, but maybe around a half to one inch. (For PJs I'd rather have too short than too long; it's not like I'll be wearing them in public.) The legs are baggier than I'm used to seeing in sleep pants, but again, I didn't buy them to make a fashion statement.<br /><br />Really, these are very comfortable for a great price.
B00028NLTW|5|I am 5'0&#34; and weigh 90 lbs.  I am a mature, adult female.  I have to wear uniforms but the issue is my agency (Law Enforcement) can not find uniform pants that fit me.  I went in search of something that would work AND fit and was successful with this choice!  The look wonderful and fit beautifully!!
B00CIZZ6HM|4|even smaller than it was written in another's revies
B007X7WUG0|2|I am 5'8&#34; and 165 and the XL would not even button. It's a nice style but put together poorly.
B00VJDDYVY|5|Excelent
B006FDFJDO|5|Excellent
B00LC80022|1|So disappointed!<br /><br />My son has only been in school for two weeks and the strap is already ripping off! He's only in kindergarten so it's not as though he has much weight in it!<br /><br />Not even close to being happy with this!
B00L4FUOLU|5|Is good for ma children
B004XZPO4U|5|Wonderful quality and workmanship! I have used their wallets for years. I have never been disappointed. Five stars on this one.
B007KDH9Q8|5|I'm nearly 5'7&#34; with an athletic build, meaning bulky muscle but fit, and 155 lbs. I have large calves, muscular thighs and an ample bottom. As a result, I never ever wear workout pants that are fitted like this. But recently joining the local volleyball league made me realize my lulu lemon grooves were keeping me from wearing my knee pads with sufficient protection and I saw a friend, skinny and petite, wearing knee length compression pants. I decided to give the Spanx ones a try and found a cute LLL tops that were long enough to cover my butt. I love them! They look good, suck everything in, have a high waist that holds in the tummy and sculpts the waist, plus they are not shiny, and you can't see your panties through them. They also feel realllllllly good! So for Xmas I asked for the long version, and they don't disappoint either. I almost didn't give 5 stars just because the waist sometimes has to be folded back up, especially with all the bending over in barre classes, but this isn't a big problem. They also look great under a sweater dress or long tunic sweater with tall boots. I'm getting lots of use out of them! Great buy!
B001UN5YSY|2|The product was not a quality product, and I had to email the customer service to get my entire order. I was missing six out of the nine pairs of underwear. When I finally opened them and used them, they were not of quality construction. Before I even put them on, I noticed a pantyliner on the inside that was improperly sown on. Upon actual use, the lining came undone.
B00GKCAP20|4|I purchased this shirt to wear as a rash guard shirt in the pool as my skin is irritated from the chlorine.  So far, the shirt has worked well but I would prefer if the sleeves were a bit shorter, more like a cap sleeve than a short sleeve.  Over all, I would recommend this shirt.
B005JWGVO8|5|The belt kept my little brother's pants up on occasion where the belt was needed and thus I have no complaints of the functionality of this belt.
B008ATAQ66|4|Great as a starter bra for my daughter, the elastic does show under her shirts, but any bra would do that as well.  A flatter band of elastic underneath would be nicer though.
B00HI47MPW|3|It fit ok
B002QAWJAQ|5|Strong fabric, color fast, good fit, won't stretch or lose elasticity.  Very comfortable.  These socks are a great gift item
B004YKDHVQ|5|I am in the middle of buying dresses for my trip.<br /> This dress fit the bill!<br />The colors are vibrant and it fits perfectly.<br />The best part is you can just fold it up and it never wrinkles.<br />Perfect for my trip.
B000PYJZZW|5|This is a great gift for the new baby in your life
B008TQWF28|4|The belt was what I expected. I was very satisified with it. It fits well and is easy th reverse
B007CRBHTC|4|We are currently in the process of exchanging it for the next larger size.  It appears that HeadChange has a very reasonable exchange policy.
B00H7V0SA2|4|I like it but its to big I like because I can but things in the bag but not my laptop
B00CAA1QNI|5|A bit pricey but it was an excellent costume for my wife during Halloween.  Seems to be of good quality and very well made.
B008QNQOOO|3|Item was already stained when I received it.
B00FM07U4M|1|Horrible item and company in my opinion! Nice idea if you are looking for clothing that it so constricting it will make the baby pop out when you put it on. Seller will make you pay shipping on a return. BUYER BEWARE!!!!
B00L67P1RS|5|It is a bit fitted but looks so cute and I always get compliments when I wear it.
B00AQ1B7Q4|4|Love the camisole.  Would have liked it better if the camisole came with adjustable straps and was made of a heavier material.  Overall, pleased with the purchase.
B00MGRFTSS|5|Beautiful drees!
B005GNSIIC|5|I got the red one for my daughter and it is even prettier in person.  The rosettes are gorgeous and the draping effect of the skirt is lovely.  It has a simple elegance to it.
B000G7WC80|4|I really like these, and have NO hesitations about wearing Merino Wool in the summer or for physical activity/working out.<br /><br />These fit perfect, even in the instep with the elastic (which you can't even feel under your foot).<br /><br />I find the color kinda weird, I would have preferred black, but I guess that's a personal preference.<br /><br />I'm only giving this sock a 4-Star rating, because they're only guaranteed for 2 years, which seems like a lot. However their competitors, &#34;Darn Tough&#34; Vermont guarantees theirs FOR LIFE!  (Wigwarm, get behind your product as your competitor has and I'll change my rating to 5-Stars)
B0057X9URY|5|What's to say about a T-shirt?  It fits and feels good, is adequately made and well worth the money.  I was looking for comfort and utiity and this product supplied both.  It's a little longer than I expected but that's fine and better than the other way around.  The color selection was small in the larger size I ordered but that's to be expected.  I plan to get a few more and perhaps some for a gift.
B001A42I7I|5|I am a female and wear a size 7 1/2 shoe - I ordered the Medium and they fit perfectly.  These are the socks I wear with my tennis shoes for daily walking.  Although they are a bit pricey, they wash and wear well without shrinking.  I have had my other pairs for over a year and they look and feel as good as the new ones.  These are worth the money!
B006YFTH68|5|Excellent scrubs
B001AN1KY6|5|perfect!
B00VRZD6YE|5|Pay close attention to the product description, esp. the sizes and conversions.  This is made in Asian sizes, so my normal US size 16 is actually a 4XL in this suit.  That said, it fits well, is well made, and totally retro, which I love!
B007P3BJBE|5|Does it get any better than this? FUR SUREEEEEEEE.<br />Let's get weird tonight! I always receive compliments when wearing this.
B00EMG3X1Q|4|The Gerber mittens are the only ones I found that would stay on baby's hands for more than 2 minutes. The elastic is stronger, tighter than most others, but definitely doesn't hurt baby. I would recommend these if you have a kid with smaller limbs/wrists.
B0006UAUZO|1|I buy Dockers annually over the last eight years, so I am familiar with the product. I'm a big fan of wrinkle free pants as they require low maintenance and match my \\"on the go\\" life. I normally purchase the same measurements in different colors to replace the ones I purchased the prior year.     Last years batch, I should have returned immediately as I noticed prior to wearing there was bad stitching around the crotch area (2 sets) and pocket (1 set). As I hate taking items back, I quickly threaded the pants to repair the problem areas, although brand new and not worn.     I placed my annual order again this year. Boy was I shocked to find that my newly delivered pants had actually 'shrunk'. Same pants the prior 7 years by measurement, had actually shown up a full inch shorter by length(on 4 pairs). The front button at the waist line, was sewn extremely tight, so there was not sufficient spacing (not due to weight gain)for fastening (2 sets).     As they did not fit properly I sent them back. If your buy Dockers, make sure you try them on in the shop. I can no longer trust that the quality of their product will match the prior years. For now I'm staying away.    My Dockers purchases come from a major clothing retail store, so I assume they are authentic Dockers.
B005K70RQU|5|I was looking for a clean-elegant looking shirt that could fit me right and I found it.<br />This is the best well made shirt I've ever had. If you are 5'11 and slender, get a Large size and it will fit you perfectly. i should've bought 2 or 3 of this shirt.
B003KJMGYQ|4|OK - definitely made for adult women over 5'6&#34;.  Very sheer material.
B0018P1BW2|5|Since we no longer can find them in the store, it was wonderful
B00OKJS78E|5|Very nice .good cuality
B00EK93UOA|3|This dress is REALLY cute. However, it is too too big. I'm 115lbs & 5'4 I ordered a small based on the size chart & was worried it would be small, not the case.
B00OK1KUVY|2|It's too small
B003YJE75I|5|Excelent product
B00DY5MK6U|4|They are fine. They have a nice fit and feel. Not too tight. Not too lose. They don't fall down. I just wish they were all the same color! The brownish gray really doesn't go with much of anything. And the others are so close in color they are hard to sort. I think I will be wearing some mismatched socks since I am lazy!
B00H70TGHO|5|gracias
B004T4XTD8|5|My daughter loved it!  It fit well, she likes her shirts a little loose.
B008EQOID2|5|These have a wide band at the waist which does the trick to hold in my tummy, and the leggings are longer than other brands I have tried  and they did NOT shrink in the dryer!
B00BCZ18OE|3|This is the second time I've bought a Southpole shirt.  The first time it was too small, I thought by a size. I love the design. But it just didn't fit. I figured the sizes ran small.<br /><br />So this time it bought a size larger than I usually buy even though I've lost weight since the first purchase. Imagine my surprise when it turned out to be skin tight. There is no way I would wear it.<br /><br />This company is not accurately stating its sizes.  Why they would do that I cannot imagine.<br /><br />One size too small I can accept as a reasonable variation. But this shirt must be at least 3 sizes too small.<br /><br />This is inexcusable for a company selling clothes online. They must know that customers are depending on them to size their products accurately. If they cannot do better than this, they should quit.
B0009MZYEQ|5|These are great socks. I have been wearing Thorlo socks for 20 years. They wear well and are very comfortable. Eventually they do wear out but only after many many cycles of wear and wash. Because I am always adding new pairs to my inventory I came up with a system to avoid wearing a pair that are unevenly worn due to their age difference. When I unwrap a new pair I use a permanent marker to mark each sock with an identical identifying letter, ie: \\"A\\", \\"B\\", \\"C\\", etc. So after laundering several pairs together they are easy to match up.
B0036LU3WU|5|This coat is very comfortable. I highly recommend it, but order it a size or 2 larger than you normally would.  It is so warm, comfortable, and well worth the money.  I don't think I will ever own another kind of coat.
B00Q3J1DNA|5|Love these pajamas! They look adorable and cant wait for my 3 kids to wear them!
B0084DIQTW|4|This was a gift and was well received.  The outfit arrived quickly, was unique, well made, and very cute. I'm sure my niece will look adorable in it :)
B00EKG5KCS|5|Great bag - much larger and of better quality than we expected. Bought it for my teenage daughter. Need to consider one for myself!
B0036MWKHU|5|I love having some basic long sleeve tee shirts in my closet. I am a size small and it fit perfectly, the small is tight fitting which I like. If you want the shirt to be a little more roomy I would go with the medium.
B00E5NLRNW|3|looks like the picture but 2 of them came on a different necklace i don't like the color that was chosen for them. came when it we suppose to. were shipped in a neat little bag. its pretty but cant send them back because they wouldn't make it back before Christmas. They are a gift so i don't have to worry about wearing them
B00850X2GG|5|I just love these...........got a pair for each of the woman for the Woman's Retreat on our team.  They are so soft and cute.  The seller handled the selling with perfection and I would deal with them again.
B004VW55NA|5|I really like the look of this watch. It really looks good. I would buy another one. It looks expensive and is really light eeight wise.
B00SR5VT6Y|5|Great dress for the price. The material is nice, a little stretchy. It fits perfectly. It is for an outdoors wedding, I am a bridesmaid. I would actually wear this dress again! Very happy!!!
B00JF0G5RI|5|Great design on smooth fabric perfect fit
B006301DOI|5|Carter brand is my top pick in these sleep & plays!  They're very well made, fit true to size, the fabric is a very good quality knit, and most importantly they're incredibly soft on the inside. Be it the zip up or snap up, the seams don't bind or rub like many of the other brands.
B004LKBKMM|5|SUPER Fast shipment, beautiful dress! Would buy from this company again in a heartbeat. It's true to measurements indicated on size chart and fit snug and perfect. Very comfortable and supportive in the bra area.
B00847OAMA|5|I am 5'5&#34; and I wear lots of maxi dresses and skirts. This slip is the perfect length for me. It's a very well made product and fits right to size.
B004D56A70|5|cute, fit well, comfy and perfect for any outfit you requiring leggings to be worn. Fast shipping, happy with this product.
B00IX8WHFM|1|Bad
B0020HRSNS|1|This is the worst thing I've ever worn. First, it came so wrinkled I thought I'd never get them out. Had to steam the thing & then it took over an hour for them to start to relax. Second, I got it to wear to an out of town wedding. It came the day before I was to leave. By the time I got to my hotel & I brought it in my room, the thing had stretched out like you wouldn't believe. Just from being on the hanger. The arm holes were a mile wide. I had to take up the shoulders about 2\\" on each. I'm not kidding...the arm holes hung 1/2 way down my sides. After I did that, I had to lay it down, (very carefully, so as not to have it wrinkle again) But I was stuck..I had to wear it. I had nothing else. By the time the wedding was over, someone gave me a shall to wear, because it kept stretching as the night wore on. The ruffles on the dress are too heavy for the material & it just continues to stretch. I ended up leaving the wedding reception early because my under garments were starting to show at the chest! And this dress was not cheap. It was over $60.00 by the time you pay for shipping. Everyone dubbed it the Slinky dress. I was sooo uncomfortable the whole night, feeling like everything was hanging out. I couldn't get up & dance...any movement excelerated the stretching. VERY MUCH BAD!!!
B00FZR1FBQ|3|Fit very nice and I also like the variety of colors.
B0013Y6KGK|5|Works well as sleeping bra.
B00AC6W7TY|5|Very flattering dress! Incredibly comfortable!! I will be buying the other colors!
B006SU3G0M|2|These shorts look cute but because of the material get very heavy when wet.  Sand also really sticks to them.  I noticed the inside lining rubbed a raw red spot on my 2 year olds leg.
B003X26S6W|4|If the width could be a little bigger, it would be better.
B002JPPH0W|2|Not a great product. Doesn't keep you warm at all. It's oversized, so it don't fit like I thought. Just keep it in back of truck in case I need it. Not worth the money I paid for it.
B00FPSVXS0|5|I don't like to pay too much for T-necks that I replace every winter. I needed this (and I bought another color). It was fairly inexpensive and 1 size fits all. So it is clingy and not really loose but that is what I like as I wear vests and sweaters or cardigans over the most of the time. Nice buy for the money. If you are wanting a higher quality that will last years this is not for you. But it is a nice product, no complaints.
B00LY30O2Q|4|My daughter is almost ready to wear this! Not upset it was a little big because she grows quickly!
B00QVUQ7TQ|5|So comfortable and I get compliments every time I wear it.
B008FE35DM|4|I really like these shorts and the price is great. I bought some interlock running shorts from American Apparel for $22 and decided to do some searching online to see if I could find the same shorts for less money, that's when I found these. The price is right, but they run very small. I have a size medium in the ones from American Apparel (I typically wear size Small in clothes but I like some things a little loose so I figured a medium in these would be my best bet) and got a medium in these. They fit, but they are snug, a lot more snug than the medium from American Apparel. I still like them though, so I kept them, only wish they were a tad looser. Consider sizing up 1 or 2 sizes depending on how you prefer the fit!
B00BOST594|4|Purchased because these pajamas have pockets..  PJs are soft and feel as though they will soften more over time becoming a favorite pair.
B003200WNA|4|I bought two of these shirts in different colors (green and raspberry) for my wife's birthday.  The shirts are nicely made. Since they are all cotton, they look nice and are comfortable for her to wear in warm, muggy weather.  However, we noticed something odd about the two shirts.  Although they are the same size, the dimensions of one are noticeably bigger than the other.  If you lay one atop the other, there is at least an inch difference in the width going from one side seam to the other.  They both seem to fit her well enough, but the difference in the dimensions of the shirts seems a bit odd.
B00K59JQTM|5|my brother loved it. so dope!
B00F0HF9A4|2|Do not rely on the picture alone to believe that these are actually the size of thes knee high they were so small and tiny I was so dissapointed so the picture actually is not the right picture for the product I recieved .
B00076ZRI2|5|Very well made shirts I will be buying more they fit very well
B00LO1SD3K|5|I Like It Fits Perfect Came on Time no Complaints
B00IXKJX02|5|perfect panty for both sexes. They are light weight  and gives enough support for males.
B000RUJJAU|5|These look great and were very easy to mold to my teeth, no problem with them falling off either.  I am very happy with these and look forward to using them again.
B009F9Q8TO|5|I bought myself this belt for Christmas a couple years ago.  I have to say I loved it.  Easily adjustable, easy to get on and off and seems fairly sturdy. The only downfall is that it doesnt hold up to sliding across the cement, but I am not sure it was meant for that.
B00741CAWO|4|The length of the belt was easy to cut and adjust. Just as I expected, though I still have to see how it holds up after a long summer.
B007L6IDM8|5|I bought these for my granddaughter. As any teen, she is not easy to please BUT she loves the pants and now lives in them.They fit well and are comfortable. I'm so glad I bought two pair one with grey top and one with white top.
B00207RN5G|2|Picture showed as being slightly padded and it was not....
B00HVHKZ7S|4|Alittle small for a slouch hat... not much slouch!!
B000NSIHV8|4|I recently purchased the set of 10 shirts for my younger brother.  He is enjoying his first real career out of college.  The shirts and matching ties give him a variety of professional looks to wear to the office.  For the price, the quality is exceedingly well.  There were two \\"repeats\\", but he passed the identical shirt on to a friend.  And there was one \\"pimp by ride\\" shirt that my brother keeps out for wearing out with his friends.  Again, great value for the quantity and quality presented.
B00DW7I15E|5|I was highly satisfied with this purchase. The fit was excellent and it has washed up nicely .
B0002TORIU|5|Socks are good quality and fit well.
B00F8IDHRC|5|Nice shirt
B004SVOFG2|1|I did not like this. As soon as I got it out of the package it started shedding and I didn't think it would stop. I would not buy this again. I hope I can find another boa in time for my event.
B006O7JOD2|4|It is very cute especially for the price so I am not going to return it for a smaller size.  I wear size 10/12 jeans depending on brand, so for dance attire, I typically buy XL do to my hips and thighs - however this skirt is already a little large so when I lose some weight I may have to alter it!<br /><br />I would recommend buying a smaller size b/c it is a tie side skirt!
B00DQ3OED2|5|Got this for my wife for a costume party. Amazing.
B00KQ3AK9C|5|These yoga pants are great. Because they are described as 'junior' I went with a size Medium, I'm 5'-4&#34; 130 pounds and they fit perfectly. The pants are super stretchy and comfortable, although they are about 3&#34; too long for my short legs I still love them, will be easy enough to hem. Perfect to wear around the house or out running errands. At this low price I'll be purchasing additional pairs in different colors.
B0045V73UA|5|soft, fits great and is very warm
B00GUYD9VW|3|Pretty colors; very thin material.
B00IPEN09G|2|Pretty... but too small on top and billowy on the bottom.  Had to return it.
B00CHNNHQM|4|This hat is very visible (what I wanted) and really warm. It's nice and long so you can pull it over your ears or fold it back to uncover them. I would give it 5 stars but sometimes it tends to creep up and i have to pull it back down. Not horrible just a little annoying. So I gave it 4 stars. Otherwise, great hat.
B00HX2GD1I|4|great adjustment and never slips
B001WPIMTS|5|I bought the shirt for my little swimmer niece last year and she wore it all the time.  I think she will really love these capris to go with it.  They are very well made.
B001LRFY6G|3|My chest is bigger than most men from working out. My stomach is bigger because I eat too much. The result is that the vest looks awkward even though I ordered XX Large ( my normal size). It fits more like a life jacket than how it fits in the photo. The delivery guy did not leave paperwork or receipt. I'm screwed.
B00HFAHBDC|2|They are not true to size, I usually wear a medium, I selected the large (previous pair was large and fit very comfortable) and this pair arrived and fits like a medium, they do not allow for the easy fit and comfort.
B008KE540O|2|ordered 2 sizes larger, still too small.
B007NMYAXG|5|The item arrived on time in aneat packaging, not too much cardboartd and plastic.<br />The socks are great for wearing at home, are very warm and look good too.
B007WPNNFU|5|Well-made and with pride from Wisconsin; I have used the WigWam products for &#62; 30 years.  They retain their shape and do not wear out easily with repeated washings.
B005P9M9DC|3|I've been wearing heavy work boots for many years been through a lot of socks.you can find better deals out there.these are not bad .but not worth 25 bucks.
B00BN54UCU|4|I bought this when it was on a super cheap sale.  I wouldn't purchase this at full price, but it is nice.  The top is a tie it yourself halter, which helps with the sizing.  It is pretty short and the thong is pretty cheap, but that's standard with lingerie.  The product took a while to arrive and I believe it came from China, so don't expect it right away.  It is still a fine product though!
B00J0V1FG8|2|Cute and sized well. I just don't have the personality to wear the bold print. I ordered the feather muted blue one and will give other away.
B002208B8O|3|Fit as Expected around the band. the hair covering part is a little looser than I was expecting
B00092DKTM|5|I've been looking for such camisoles for a long time and I've finally found them! After a double mastectomy without reconstruction, I needed something that provided a bit of comfort in the surgical area as well as some coverage when wearing lower cut tops. These camis are the very best. I'm thrilled to have found them!
B00UC7REMI|3|It's OK. It didn't fit to tight on me and I'm a wrist size 26 size M. I wish it came with more options to tighten it.
B00AG3YI0E|5|Beautiful, Soft and sexy
B0072C6WM4|4|My son is obsessed with sea creatures, so I thought this would be right up his alley!  I was not disappointed.  It is a super soft t that has held up well to an 8 year old boy.  I would buy again.
B00F4OERMO|4|I have had two of these ripped off of me now, wonderful!  Would have gotten the full 5 stars except that the crotchless part could be a little wider.
B00IA82JNA|5|Great for my Green Day fan. Fits as expected. Has gone through several washes so far and still in good condition.<br /><br />One of the few Green Day shirts that meets school dress code, though might not do so at a super-strict school...
B00CSEX0X0|5|I was nervous due to some of the reviews but I'm so happy I ordered it. I'm 5'0 110 ish, it's a little tight on my calves but I like that it's snug and it only took a little over 2 wks to get very pleased def order another color soon
B000GKA5EA|1|I bought my first subway shirt in NYC in 2002 -- well made, heavy cotton, good fit.  Loved it.  I wore it a lot, even to work (warehouse, dock work) and it held up very well, received a lot of comments on it.  Ordered another one for my son a couple years later, same quality.  But when I finally had to replace my old shirt earlier this year, I received something completely different -- these things are now made about as cheaply as a shirt can be made.  No longer a heavy-duty cotton, but a flimsy material that feels more like gauze that an actual shirt.  You can feel the graphic right through the shirt, as though it were right against your skin.  The fit is much worse --  looser, thinner neckline and much too long.  The stitching doesn't hold up after a couple of washes.  I contacted the company to complain about the workmanship and the material, and they tried to tell me that the new shirts were actually a better material, a \\"brushed cotton,\\" and that the manufacturer had changed the style about a year before.  The older shirts were great.  It's too bad quality has so blatantly taken a back seat to the profit motive.
B00LLGTKHQ|1|Product was cheap the message was an iron on message.
B004S08HEE|3|Very soft and comfy but shows the details of the body not good for fat boys
B00DGFICRY|5|I bought for my daughter's 18th birthday.  She loved it, though it was too large and we have to return it and get a smaller size.
B0044VRS88|4|Too wide for my slimmer ties
B000783QK6|1|Disappointing!  This t-shirt shrank about five(!)inches in the length even though I followed laundering directions on the label.
B00EZWONZM|2|Did not look the same as the picture and the material was awful. #yougetwhatyoupayfor
B0097A8GLY|4|Great for summer and hot weather, but this is very tight in the arms although it does stretch. Likewise although tight, it is comfortable. It is not as long in the back, so if you want to cover you behind...this will not do it if you are above 5'3&#34; (I am 5'5&#34;). Still very cute and I like the stretchy lace.
B003BT2SMU|5|Great product, works as per the instructions.
B00KCVOV3E|5|Just what I expected.  Nice cotton undies.
B00KQB5WF6|3|for a 3x it's a bit snug
B0084MMZGS|5|It's very nice, looks style and feels great !!! Defiantly suggest to buy one. It's made in Europe. Very good quality.
B0056EVMOI|5|E x c e l e n t e !!, justo lo que estaba esperando y llego a tiempo, en excelentes condiciones
B00SLT8URC|1|Made cheaply. Won't ever wear. Look much different in person than in photo.
B005RD7I50|5|Comfortable casual pants
B00M79GJZ2|4|fit well very comfortable. I would order again
B007746ACO|5|If this is your type of shirt, it looks great.
B005MZZ4NQ|1|the first day, a thread came loose which ended up causing a huge hole in the elbow. definitely not impressed.
B007P8A2J4|5|Not too long. I really like the way it fits. I got a medium, & it is perfect. It is also very warm. I have 3 now, in different colors. It was a good value.
B00CSKFZT6|4|Really cute! Terrific for the price.
B00MZODD8A|2|First was the neck hole was too small for my head to fit in, second was the vest and arm pieces were far too big, Which made me think why there was such a big difference in size, I couldn't fit my head in so I had to cut the back of the neck cover and Open it up a bit. For what it is just don't expect the best out there.
B0064HGDC2|5|I've had no problems with this bra.  I am a 34DD and found the support good, clasp stayed put, good quality.  I usually don't get the front closure because they don't adjust or support well, but this is an exception.
B00NIVAEG8|5|Great quality and cool
B008M1WU66|5|I was pleasantly surprised, because it wasn't that expensive,  that this hat is of a very good quality. I bought it for my son-in-law to wear on an upcoming family trip to CA Adventure.
B00E1F02JY|4|Great pants. I would order them again.
B0051U1706|5|EXCELLENT LINER SOCK...
B004M6UD46|4|I'm not sure what everyone is yapping about. It's a nice wallet. Not too big, not too small. All of the slots for credit cards and IDs are perfectly sized. Someone must have been a serious weakling if they were unable to get their cards back out because the slots were too tight. They're not. Nice wallet for $12.
B003VCVIB4|5|My son liked this hat for Christmas!  Nice quality!
B0046O5Y3Y|3|The costume is very pretty, but... it is extremely itchy at the seams on the shoulder and elbows.  I'll have to figure something out to cover those seams because after having it on only a few minutes my skin was very red and irritated.  Be prepared to leave glitter wherever you go because it sheds.  I shook it out several times but the glitter is never ending.  If you're even a little busty this is a tight fit at the chest, and the neckline is very small.  I may have to make adjustments there or not zip it all the way.  I normally wear a size 10. As previously stated, the 'crown' is nothing as pictured.  The crown is a silver piece of stretchy foam that is sized for a child.  I cannot wear it, well, it's possible, but it looks ridiculous. If I hadn't waited until the last minute to order a costume, I would definitely send it back and try a different costume.  I may still send it back and buy locally.
B00ADLX0LC|5|Fits just as I hoped.
B00R7SRYIO|3|This is not very forgiving material. If you have some extra lady lumps you will need a good body smoother as this excentuates the good and the bad. Did fit comfortably.
B009TVWUOU|3|the product came as describe.... very comfortable and love the pockets especially.  One thing is that the length kinda shrinks a little when wash, so for other prospective buyers, you may want to consider ordering a larger size.
B001RL5L8M|5|nice shirt for layering or for early spring or fall.
B001U2Y44K|5|My daughter needed these for her dance class. She has not complained about them so I am going to say that they are just wonderful.
B00G2V04QQ|5|my granddaughter is two and she loves the frog
B00C6ZZKFW|5|Love these little shorts so much!  The adjustable waistband is great!  We tried them on our daughter and they fit perfectly.
B00MTFXF56|5|Very good
B00N1O95CG|5|nice
B003T9VLUM|4|Sturdy; 7 belt loops, not 5 like the so-called designer brands.  A functional watch pocket.  Fit great, look great. Ordered a 2nd pair.
B00RU388U4|1|#2 I'm Wearing This Shirt
B0058O0OYU|5|It's bad ass and I love it!! Lots of space and good quality! The straps were in the backpack and it even has a handy handle it u don't want it on ur back
B004RPMT94|5|Arrived on time; Exactly as described; Very Pleased with product.  Awesome T-shirt ... I Love it!
B009EF583Q|1|Unfortunately, I found this item to be of flimsy quality, the legs flare out rather than fitting snugly as they appear to do in the picture, and sizing was very difficult. Return policy includes restocking fees which along with shipping make it a waste to return.
B000SMXNI6|3|This bra is true to size, nice material - very smooth and soft, great support. I would buy more but the stitching is very irritating, especially where the shoulder straps joined the back strap, the ends of the shoulder straps are very sharp and hard so it's not comfortable.
B000JQI9MG|5|I ordered a very hard to find size: 36DDD. The coverage is perfect. This bra fits like a dream. I cannot even feel it during the day. I will definitely order more.
B00SF6Q8RK|1|It is a shirt not a jersey dress, it fits like a t-shirt.
B003ZN50A4|4|I bought these for my niece. She's 4 now and small for her age.<br />You can say she grew into them. After multiple washes, the colors are still bright and she loves trying to count the kitties.
B001CVI1PM|3|It is cheaply made, but get's the job done.  Wish it had a zipper instead of velcro.  I as afraid I would lose my items.  Thankfully, I never did.
B00LNRSEK2|5|Bought this shirt for my bf he loves it! Thanks again for shipping so fast and having the shirts look exactly like the shirts in the picture
B00HJ47JYU|3|Not bad, it took some time to get here. The adjustment belt on this gloves isn't the best.
B00SVLNY62|3|This dress is see through.
B004UQ8YR6|5|I love the feel of these briefs and the control they add. They are soft and feminine and available at a reasonable price.
B00CQ5PNJ0|5|Fit is perfect.  Nicely tight around the crotch and upper legs with the appropriate bootcut opening at the bottom.<br /><br />Now if they just made these in a different color, I would own more.
B00LWE7XIA|5|It's longer than expected.  But, its looks really nice for my 6 ft. boy.  Material is also good quality.
B0088FT3G6|5|Love this wallet...it is very slim and can be carried in my husbands front pocket which is exactly why I bought it for him.
B004EUYYTK|5|I am a child photographer and purchased 3 of these hats in different sizes. They fit beautifully and are quite comfortable for the babies wearing it. Photograph nicely and I am very happy with my purchases!
B0082BI7J0|4|I love the belt. It seems well made. The price was very reasonable. I get compliments every time I wear it.
B00GUBRNW6|1|Why does Disney make this dress a limited edition? They know so many children want it. People who bought them up and sell for this price should feel shameful!
B00EV5IWHI|5|it fits perfectly and is soft to the touch<br /><br />i have gotten so many complements wearing it &#60;3<br /><br />will be ordering another soon for my sister XD<br /><br />thanks
B004WJ2IYG|4|Kimonos are a great design for newborns with their cord stumps - more protective than a onesie.  The soft organic cotton is great.  The little strings have a way of coming undone, I wish it were velcro instead.
B00DRED1XE|5|beautiful dress & the onesie top could be used all winter.  this is a great holiday dress! my daughter wore it in her Christmas pictures and was complimented on it everywhere we went!
B001CL2PGI|5|This jacket is Amazing, and fits great. just a suggestion on the measuring chart. my measurements were a exact fit for a large, but you need the couple extra inches in the sleeves, and chest so if you are a large then order a XL. It's still by far the best buy for the price, and I have gotten nothing, but compliments. Thanx again.<br /><br />Cliff Scott
B00AZGWIC2|3|this nightgown is pretty comfortable and the fit is as described.  I would not say it is the most attractive nightgown, but it is comfy.
B00KVTGHC0|5|Wavy
B00ENNXD0O|4|Muuuuuuch lighter shade of gray than shown but great quality...😊
B000E7B1PW|5|For a $35 scarf, this is very nice. The color is vibrant. The length is long. It's a good value.
B00FRFUCOW|3|The material is thick like I expected from Carhartt, but it fit too small. I normally wear a size 14, kinda in between a 12 and 14 actually. That size usually fits loose, but I bought the 14 and they were tight, too tight to be comfortable.
B00MJU7F6G|1|The sash in front is way off center. Unfortunate, as other than that the dress fits nicely, but unwearable.
B00HWUC2WA|4|Very comfortable bra!  I have purchased 3 of these in different colors, after my final breast cancer surgeries were over and comfort was huge.  You have to get the right size though - the one that is a touch smaller than the others tends to open the top one or two clasp after wearing all day.  I think the larger ones have more clasps and stay shut.  It is the most comfortable bra I've ever owned, and I strongly recommend it as a post-surgical bra if you've had a mastectomy or breast reduction.
B00GOXH032|5|Nice and a little different style for me.
B0007CKMI6|5|I bought these jeans for son for x-mas! He loved them and needed them! What a great deal and price!
B006333J88|5|I love these panties and can hardly ever find them in the stores. Very happy with the product just a little disappointed with getting a pack of all white.
B00N0RZVW2|5|Love them!! Comfy mid rise so your butt doesn't hang out. Not flashy. Just a pair of great jeans!
B0071YCF88|5|I have to admit when I bought these shorts I had ulterior motives. Knowing what I knew about my girlfriend there was 90% chance she was never going to get something like these sexy shorts on her own. So after all the hinting and outright telling her I prefer a little trashy to a little classy, I had to take matters into my own hands. As soon as she put got the shorts and put them on it was instantly accentuating her curves and I think I had to check my shirt to see if I sprouted a chest hair.<br /><br />If you are a woman buy this to feel and look sexy, and if you are a man buy this for your wife or girlfriend and thank god you are a man. I bought three of these in different colors
B000N3V7QA|5|Decent work pants
B00M8C2LZ0|5|LOVE LOVE LOVE these socks!!!
B00JGSQFTC|5|grandson like it
B004JCT4WA|5|These are very nice. Unlike some &#34;premium&#34; socks, these don't shift around while you wear them. They are comfortable and keep your feet dry.
B000QW6LLE|5|Love this product I always order more.
B00D2IC45Q|5|So adorable! Exceded expectations!
B00B9X4XQ4|2|didn't fit as I was expecting..
B002ECZIJ0|3|nice design but thick fabric not as flowing as it looks in the picture.
B008G7N8NK|4|I generally like the item, but it's too big at the waist.  I have broad shoulders and a small waist. So, I need an XL.  But an XL is made for someone with a 40-inch and not a 34-inch waiste.  It would be good if Carhardtt had an atheletic cut size - for the money that they charge, you think that they would.
B00B7MR5SU|5|Feels good and provides a little support while doing some physical activity.
B00M0QYWP6|5|They're generally good. The only drawback is they are too thin in the fall of Michigan.
B00JU5JQUG|5|Love it! It matches my watch and now my hair too!
B00IUHC0AI|3|I like the material this is made out of but even though it is supposed to be a xs it is still too big.
B005DKB2K4|3|These gloves are nice looking and warm, but all of the buttons that hold the tops open fell right off.  I still wear them, but it is disappointing that the buttons were not attached well.
B00ACIG3ZG|5|Wanna look tough and keep cool at the same time - buy these!
B00DQEWPNC|5|I've been striking out a lot lately buying clothes on Amazon but love this skirt.  I am 5'5&#34; and 120lbs and a small is perfect.  Not too tight, not too loose in the waist and the drape is heavy enough to lie down but not so heavy as to grab onto the legs.  The little scallop detail is cute and dresses up what is otherwise a casual skirt.  I got the black and it isn't a super-dark black, more of a textured knit material with charcoal threads peeking through in the light.  I wish it came in more fall colors!!!  I would wear grey or burgundy or chocolate with tights and boots in a heartbeat.
B00MPTMGYM|5|Adorable and of good quality.  I recommend this product.
B00B1W81P2|5|Excellent leather....The best..!!!
B000J03P7Q|2|The gloves are really thin, and the symbol is already peeling off.   Wouldn't have bought them if I knew.
B00IA3LFRG|5|I buy a lot of dress socks for my bf and he is very particular on fit and patterns. He loves these!
B00BWJ2RW2|5|Love the way they feel...not too tight, but at the same time doing a great job.  I looked instantly slimmer.<br />next pair i purchased  will be long leg to mid calf.  Does what it says and really light
B00L5NP952|3|Didn't know I was looking at the back of the shirt when i ordered.  I guess I should've looked, but there's really no description.  It's really just a plain black T-shirt when you're wearing it.
B00IZMW5E4|3|This fits like a tennis skirt, form fitting, very tight at the waistband and around the mid section; there is no hiding that big meal you just had.
B00DDXI56M|5|It arrived on time. Kudos to that.<br />It fit great. I ordered a size bigger than mines based on the other comments.<br />Looks incredible.
B00KVUITRK|5|Love this headband. Bought it for my 11 month old and it fits with a little room to spare. It arrived perfectly flat, so I'm still trying to figure out a way to bend it a little to the shape of her head.
B001FC2LSG|5|I needed something durable that would fit my Droid X in the Otter Box Case.  No one seemed to know what to use so I took a shot at this pouch.  Perfect fit and very well made.  It protects my Droid X well as I crawl under vehicles and work on equipment.  Plenty of velcro on the strap to hold phone in securly.  Very happy with it.
B003N5P4D2|3|Im 5ft 7 , 135lbs , bust 35inch and ordered a medium. It was way too big and I had to carry it to a seamstress. It also wrinkles alot. However once ironed it looks great. The material is good as well.
B00A13MR98|4|Really nice suit - but it was too small - and I placed it aside (forgetting to send it back).  I'll gift it to a friend who has a younger daughter.
B000UMUGDY|3|The price and the quality of the costume are a little mismatched. It wasn't super expensive, but when I received it, the collar, headband and wristbands were SO CHEAPLY made I almost didn't want to wear them but I had nothing else to use. The wristbands had elastic but were clearly created for a giant. I needed to tape them with clear tape to make them fit around my wrists and lower arms. Could have made nicer ones myself. Had a hard time keeping the collar on. It doesn't really fit that well over your neck and shoulders because of the material that was used. Better to buy a separate collar (I found one for a kid that my daughter wore, and it's made of cloth, not a synthetic material.)  The dress itself is nice, but watch the sizing. This thing runs a little large, so err on the side of small if you want to have a fitted look. Not totally pleased with this costume, but it did its job for one night.
B003GDIDBQ|5|I love this bra! It is beautiful and very comfortable. Also figure flattering, thanks to the push up cups. I only own the white one, but I am going to get the black one too for sure.
B00MK0F3M8|5|A very comfy sweatshirt.  The more of a tight night sweater versus normal sweatshirt material.  But, it has a unique look and it's keeps me warm on chilly days!  I'm not sure why it says this is fleece... it looks nothing like fleece to me.
B00KYSGO5S|5|comfortable and does it's job well
B00EF9W21M|4|It fit me larger than I expected, but that's a good thing! I like that the skirt is very short, so my legs don't look too short, as they would if the skirt were longer.
B00D8H9HVK|5|Prompt delivery made one Dad very happy!  Thanks.  Garment does fit as expected and fabric is of quality as expected.
B00RL4K8EQ|5|The dress came in a small rectangular box that shows the dress being worn by a model.  You see both the front and the back of the model in the dress.  Truth be told, the dress is very sexy as I am sure it Is meant to be that way.  It's color is like fire red.  The dress has straps across the shoulders that do not adjust.  I think that as far as size, I believe that it's one of those concepts where it is labeled as a one size fits all. However, I am a 10/12 petite and I would be surprised if a woman size 12/14 and up would fit comfortably. The dress material appears to have 2 alternating fabrics. The dress is made in alternating material levels.  For instance, the first level  starting at the bottom is more of a solid red color.  It is also not as wide as the next level which is more of a fishnet type material (see-through) than it repeats back to the solid layer and then back to the fishnet layer again. It then continues to repeat that pattern/material until  the top section is reached. A pair of slightly stretching straps lay across each shoulder.  The straps are not adjustable.  The dress is super, super, soft and comfortable and it feels like you aren't really wearing much at all.  The thicker solid pieces need to be strategically placed so as to not give away too many ummm secrets.  For me, it fits snugly which actually ended up being a good thing for me as it will help keep things in places where they needed to be and stay in those places (a little boost to gravity.) I am actually in awe that when the dress came out of the box it appeared to be more like a sexy fishnet top.  However, just by putting it on, everything stretches around all your curves and stretches just as much as you need it to, to emphasize and enhance your shape. I would not be a brave enough soul to wear this by itself, however there are alternative ways to use this dress.  I could see is being a great bathing suit cover up or even a mesh type top to be wear over a camisole and pair of shorts.  I do photography and I would love to see if it would work on a pregnant mommy doing a photo shoot.  I think I would look amazing emphasizing and silhouetting a small baby belly bump.  This would also work really beautifully (since it's red) in a sexy boudoir valentine's shoot. This sexy little dress can help make many women feel that they are sexy and beautiful! I was fortunate to receive the Qossi Women's Lethal Dose Seamless Mini Dress for free in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.  ]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]
B00E6OPG7S|5|I ordered the bright rose with pinwheels and the colors are absolutely beautiful (not too bold and in your face!) My 8 year old daughter likes that it isn't bulky.  She loves it!
B000N8X6IW|5|nice fit well put together
B0044XIZKG|5|Fits perfectly! Arms are a little long but i can just take them up. Other than that, it looks great on. Very professional.
B00KFBI5YC|5|Shirt was really pretty and my daughter loved it!
B00E0FF49S|5|It was the first time I bought the brand little lass and I was hooked. It is an excellent choice for girls dress The colors are cute and very good fabric. I recommend it!
B00CX7KH6A|5|Fits great, and couldn't be happier with the artwork.  The stiching is professionally done and the waistband strectches to comform to my bulging waste.
B00FPKO5VK|5|This shirt had the expected fit for 3xl. Loose and comfortable, able to be active. I would buy again. Thanks.
B0030H83ZY|4|Received them in a short amount of time and they were exactly what I wanted. A little too expensive I think, but all in all, a good product.
B0041535B6|4|Exactly as advertised.
B006P9EF60|4|Love this romper! Love the thin, soft matterial and it's too cute! The price; a little harsh but it's a good piece of clothing!
B00C2NORF2|2|I bought these for a charity race that I am running in. I was very disappointed in the shoddy sewing. The seams don't match up, so my pelvis looks dislocated.
B004170WDI|5|Great non-slip comfortable and pretty.
B002UV7MAI|5|Awesome!!!
B00I2ZC78S|5|Perfect!
B00NAUNI1A|2|I bought a large, but the waist was teeny tiny.
B00N6ELQL4|5|Is soooo nice, I love it. Really cute.
B00IVEDLB2|5|The picture doesn't do it justice...there is a shadow dragon on the front, just as there is on the third season dvd set. It is well made and fits true to size.
B00H4QPS82|4|Received a lot of compliments when I wore the dress.
B00B1VRSI4|5|I love the uniwque style fo these.  they are not like anything else that I have had before and I love them.
B00HDA2U3K|5|good
B009TCFMO4|5|Mom likes them, seem thicker than the 8 dollar ones and more stretch.
B00IMV2XN6|3|not quite as pictured, the stripes are thicker and less of them. But overall a very cute, casual top!
B005OKTBFQ|5|Happy customer! I wear my shirt all the time! I love my shirt! SOA Collectables are awesome! Fits perfect and I can't want to buy more.
B00B9ZS6HY|5|I bough this tankini top recently and it's even cuter in person than in the photo. With most swimwear, I've found it runs small and usually people recommend sizing up. However with this top, definitely buy your correct size. I am 5'6\\" and a solid size 12 (can squeeze into a 10, 14 is baggy) and I sized up and ordered a 14. The 12 would have been a better fit. The 14 has a bit of a looser fit and actually now looks more like a cute looking tank top, rather than a swim top. This is fine since I bought it for laying out in the sun at the beach, but it's not really snug enough for swimming. If I was going to be jumping in and out of a pool, I would want a more swim-top tighter fit, and my normal size 12 would have been perfect.<br /><br />What's not shown in the photo is that the fabric has a neat texture to it. It's not slick and smooth, nor does is have a shiny finish to it. It's actually a thick material, and has a soft fabric finish to it. I'm guessing water doesn't bead off of it as well as something made of the slick, thin Lycra material, but this top is a lot better looking. Also, the fit and materiel will hide little lumps and bumps. It's much more forgiving to a less than flawless waistline, and I'm beyond impressed with how this looks. I love it!
B00K68D6TI|3|Too large, I would like to exchange for an xL. What are the directions for returning?
B0061U6EPI|2|The hat quality is good But I haven't listened to reviews which said it is too big.<br /><br />Firstly I don't know it is made for Human or giants from another worlds probably. I have never seen a person with such a big head so that this hat would fit... It is HUGE<br />Don't buy  it
B0089GK3D6|2|It.s so tall
B00D6U4L9M|5|excellent quality and a good price. I love it. As expected. I was perfect. Recommended for purchase,recommended for blindly buying
B0027P9Z6G|4|i got this on sale, and it was a great price for the product. delivery was quick and my husband looked great in it ;)
B00AIY3MHG|5|Very happy with this money clip. It is very slim and light and you don't even feel it in your pocket.
B00LXHER62|5|Nice
B00O0IO8DS|5|NICE
B00W36BDAK|5|Love these headbands! Good quality with felt backing. They look a little big on my 3 month old but can't wait until she is older to wear them!
B004SMD7T2|5|worth the price, highly recommended in red, looks really sharp, not too bulky and fits anywhere from 4-10 credit cards
B001LRMV9O|5|The vest is everything I was expecting from Carhartt. It is perfect for my activities as it keeps my core warm while giving me freedom of movement. I would caution that the sizes seem to run small. I normally wear a large, but ordered a X-large and it is a good fit. Would definitely recommend this product.
B0051CMJWE|5|Hubby loves these christian shirts here is a tip turn the shirt inside out before washing in cold water to keep it from peeling
B001FOR47C|5|nice looking orderd when i got new shoes they match great fits well and my pants dont fall down hey its a belt what more could you ask for!
B004RL0JQS|5|NICE AND THICK BELT...COOL BLUE AND SNAZZY SILVER THICK AGAIN BUCKLE<br />A COOL N BAD ASS BELT I LOVE IT
B0043O77YQ|1|The Original pant fit smaller and the material was very rigid in texture. Preferred the Men's Young Adult pant over this one.
B003D7YPEY|5|Love
B0073ZEM5E|5|Love this  wallet... it has so  much  room.  it has 16  credit card  holders  it's  small  and not  huge and  bulky.  it  is exactly what I  wanted and  I'm so  glad I  purchased  it!
B009E2ZTGA|3|These pj's are super soft and warm and VERY cute... unfortunately the fabric came apart under the arm after just one wash.
B00BF2206E|5|The shirt is light weight, which isn't good or bad. It just is.<br />Depending on where you live and the time of year, a light weight tee might be exactly what you want.<br />It's very comfortable.
B003DS2MDE|5|I used for my bachelorette party.  was a blast
B00JDAJ3O2|5|Beautiful.  As I like to change bands, I removed the black one.  The larger headbands work great and give more color.
B00795AA0O|5|one of the cutest and warmest jackets I've ever owned!!!oxit was the purchase of the year so light weight and lovable!
B008AUYAIA|5|I came across this sweater during a lightning deal last week and though I usually don't buy items without reviews, I decided to try it.  I can't tell you how glad I am that I did.  My only regret was not buying one in each color while they were at that price.<br /><br />This is incredibly warm, soft and comfortable.  When it came in, my wife was out of town.  I wore it to pick her up from the airport and the first thing she said to me (even before hello) was how much she loved the sweater I was wearing - and for her to notice at all says a lot.
B004QF0L7C|4|it's ok!!!
B002IRLDCW|5|Exactly what I was looking for. Fits perfectly.
B00G4BQOWC|2|The shirt it self is nice and cute, but I ordered a L size but received a S one. Now I have to reorder one, and the S one I am going to give it to my girl friend. I would rate it one star if the shirt itself isn't cute enough.
B00ECUFLHQ|4|Good quality.
B00565W1KG|3|They are a little snug and are my size so they must be the cut of the pants. Im pleased with my exchange and how fast the process was.
B002MGB5C2|4|They are fine -  as described and satisfactory yoga comfy pants -  price is very good.
B010EFNCTQ|5|Super cute!
B0059CVHRE|5|Fit perfect
B00DV3U2E2|1|It was like a size 6 it was extremely small
B002EDPWFO|3|Slips are a perfect length and color, however cut just a little bit small.  Fabric doesn't have much give to it.
B00DII3VPW|5|Came quickly, fit perfect, stayed on all day!
B0096R2A38|4|I have a giant head and this still fits but is streched out( a little smaller in lenght) when i wear it. Good Hat though.
B00375DH2S|5|Pants were of good quality. The pants were as described in quality. The pants shipped quickly and were very nice.
B00N3I15XM|1|Had this item and already the threads  are tearing out.
B001B2JICM|2|I'm not sure if i'm just the unlucky one, but i just received my second shirt after having to return the first one due to a hole in the seam on the left hand side. I immediately check my 2nd shirt for holes... and sure enough there is a hole in the same spot. I think i'm just going to sew it myself and deal with it. Overall I like the way it fits and the material used just the two shirts  i've received with holes are the reason for the low rating.
B004UUED5E|4|I bought this for Halloween.  It was a bit over-priced, but appropriate for a &#34;Mad Hatter&#34; costume.  I think that I will wear this again just because....
B00BS2JC8K|3|Everything checked out fine except for the brown strip of color is yellow. Like Amazon™ yellow. A little disappointing, but overall an OK buy.
B00E58YNEW|5|I would be really nice if it covers a little more and was padded.  Beautiful piece of work.
B001CCURAS|5|He lives in these
B006HT30VO|5|After paying 13.00 a shirt at Walmart this was a great find. Ordered 3 and just ordered 3 more. Not as long as I would like but long enough, at 3.64 who can complain.
B00DQZNF30|5|This Hat is very well made. The graphics are super and this is worth the money. Like the way the brim is bent
B00BBU512U|5|This is SUPER Cute, I can't belive how cheap it was. It is a soft material and not scratchy, which I'm always worried about when shopping online. Stretches so could fit a little bigger. And is slightly see-through and thin fabric but we have hot summers here that doesn't me!
B00BCYDRNK|5|Sweet for her first BDAY party. I bought for my grandbaby. I also purchased the matching hat and socks. So sweet and unusual. The pants are super darling with the flared bottoms! I luv Mud Pie clothing..
B00LAU3R18|5|Love these jeans -- perfect fit.
B004TG3M10|4|I received a bag of hand-me-down baby socks for my twins in a wide range of brands and none of them stayed on. (Sketchers, puma, carters, circo...) I finally picked up a pack of Robeez and I finally have socks that stay on my 8 month olds all day!<br /><br />I'm giving them 4 stars instead of 5 because I wish they had no slip grips.
B00E1ALO6E|4|For  what it  costs I think that this is a perfect fit dress for the  price  fit will and love the color which  was the wine color.
B004D38PNY|2|My husband normally wears this size & has other Haggar dress pants, but these particular pants run quite small.  The material seemed lightweight & the color was very nice.  Returning for a refund because this will be a tricky item to get the correct size & don't want to have to keep returning.
B009I03JP6|5|Whats not to like. Fun temporary tattoos that work  :-)
B004QF0TE2|5|Just as you would expect from &#34;Dickies&#34;...Quality work socks! With Cushioned soles for those hard long days on your feet.
B002YQ2FHO|1|My daughter used these for 2 ballet classes and they are torn completely up one side of the leg<br />not very happy
B002TNOCY6|5|Got this for my honeymoon and my husband loves it!!!!
B00J4N6XL4|5|this dress is very elegant, it looks better on than on the hanger! It is a little longer than I anticipated, but love the color!
B0020ML3DE|5|Socks are comfortable and fit well.
B003OQTT8G|5|I purchased this shirt for my husband.  This is made of a heavy, thick flannel.  Carhartt quality.  It is a well-made shirt.  It keeps him warm when he's working outside all day.  Nice looking shirt as well. Generously sized.  He would like to have another!
B00GGCE1NS|3|They fit as expected being Spanx but as other reviews stated.... They kept rolling down the whole time! Very annoying because they fit great other than the rolling issue! You can't be very active while wearing these...be warned!
B0079VL82W|5|really nice
B00RB5PQAG|5|Great hat at a great price.
B000SB6PJQ|5|I have very sensitive hands - even an air conditioner can be too cold for them - with these mittens/gloves, I never felt the cold and we had -30 temps this winter.  My hands actually sweated a couple times.  They stay dry inside, too.  I highly recommend these!
B00789UAUG|4|Waist line is high like other reviews. I ordered my normal size. Fits snug at first, then loosens up. Knee pockets are over my shins not my knees. Fabric and knee pocket material seems more durable then the blue Cat Trademark jeans. Pockets are nice. I like the inside outside front pocket/ tool holder.
B00655DN76|5|Love this robe! Yes, it's a splurge but sooooo worth it! Bought the black one several months ago and just had to have the gray. I'm a size 20-22 and the 3X fits very well even after several washes. So soft and very lightweight, I HATE being hot and this is perfect for me.  LOVE IT!!
B00ANV8JDQ|5|I was extremely pleased with the quality of this suit.  Without being able to try it on or see it in person before making the purchase scared me a little bit but I was pleasantly surprised.  The price with the quality was wonderful.  Great option when trying to find a size that is difficult to find at a reasonable price.
B00D83VBZE|1|Poor quality don't bother to buy or don't ever spend your money on this it's very ugly! Very different  look in actual ....hate it!!!!!!!!
B00GC08KDG|1|I don't even know why they even make the small sizes.
B00IHPLJ50|5|love the pink with black lace  wanting  to buy lite blue
B00FGL8DH0|5|I love this see through lace top.  It is great looking, good fitting, and a great price.  I found a mocha camisole to wear under this top and paired together they look great on me.  I am tall and I love the way this top fits, it has stretch to it and hugs my body nicely without being too tight and the sleeve length is long enough for me.  I would love to find this top in more colors, I would buy them all.<br /><br />As an Amazon Prime member this top qualified for free two day shipping and my top arrived on time.
B0096A13Z6|5|It came super new, you can tell the instant you get the shirt. Fits good and is a lot cheaper than affliction. I can't tell the difference it just looks like expensive designer clothing.
B00DPKFDLS|5|This is a fantastic product. Came very well packaged, almost two weeks before its arrival estimate! Made of high quality hair. If you want the EXACT style in the picture you will need to style it, but the cut is exactly as it looks. The tail is HUGE and mounted on a large hair clip to distribute colours properly. The bottom of the tail isn't as flat as in the picture but by turning the clip it can be if you want it to, although I like the layered style that matches the wig.so I don't. Best purchase on amazon so far. Will definitely purchase from this seller whenever I can.
B00BT17MUU|5|The little footies go around the toe, so dainty for a special summer occasion! Dressy for church with no sweaty baby feet. Very happy with product.
B00DN396H4|5|This hat is just adorable! The quality is very good, love the way it fits my baby boy! I feel I need to mention, my son is on the bigger side(5 month and almost 18 pounds), I got him size 12m and it fits very good now, so I wonder if they are a little on the small side. But I will totally get couple more of Zutano hats!
B004X809KG|5|It was given as a birthday gift and it was loved! Great thickness...between a shirt and jacket. Definitely appreciated by my friend.
B007HIHKRE|5|Item was as described. Looks awesome. Had a couple compliments on it at work. A little heavy,but it's stainless steel. That's why I bought it. Keep in my pocket with pens and leather still looks great after a month. Holds about 10 to 12 cards.
B000VWFK8O|5|Good quality. Fits as expected
B003CITSOQ|5|Love it!  Ordered just two days before Hween due to change of plans to attend a party.  I was so happy with this!  Great price and LOVE prime shipping!  I'm 5'9&#34; and slender.  The medium fit my height great and accommodated my D cup size without being too revealing.  I had SO many compliments and was still sexy without exposing too much.  I'll wear this for years to come :)
B009T3MBOC|1|THIS SHIRT COULD NOT BE ANYMORE CHEAPLY MADE. IT IS SO CHEAP THAT THE COLLAR HAS THE SAME MATERIAL AS THE MAIN PART OF THE SHIRT!<br />NOT AT ALL IMPRESSED
B00JV8C258|4|Both my kids love Star Wars (what they've been exposed to so far, at any rate) so when they needed new socks, I went hunting and found these.  They're surprisingly well-made; I'm used to rather flimsy kids' socks (maybe because kids grow out of them so quickly that manufacturers don't feel the need to make them especially durable?).  These have a good soft feel (great for kids with sensitive skin), are well-sewn at the toe, heel and ankle (so they can resist fraying and popping holes), and stretched well without pinching.  We are well-pleased with these socks!  (Now, if only they made grown-up Star Wars socks...)
B004HCU7KA|5|I saw this buckle online and decided to give it a try. I am pleased with the quality of this product.
B0096E59S4|1|This shirt is not a real nike product   I don't know what all these people are talking  about all nike emblems are all EXTREMELY fake  glued on by cheap machines even the tags are fake and the material feels extremely fake it's not as stretchy like all my other nike dri-fit shirts and the size is one size too big The rest of my nike dri-fit shirts have a tag on the side near the waist the tag on the real product feels silky and the tag on this fake one feels kind of stiff not silky will be looking out for this seller I WILL NEVER BUY ANY PRODUCT  FROM THIS SELLER Look at the front nike emblem it has a clear glue outline that gives it away right away none of my other one have this clear glue around emblems
B00JH0TD9S|5|good
B006926A8Y|5|It was exactly what my son wanted for his birthday, so was very glad to see in on Amazon, fits perfect.
B008H2ETBE|5|EXCELLENT SOCKS
B00CUK9B80|3|commonly
B000VK5VWG|5|This is a great sports bra for those of us that are curvaceous. Used their measurement chart to find the size and it was right on. Washes well and I'll continue to buy this bra. It also doesn't give you the dreaded uniboob.
B00QTFXSEK|5|very nice hat,perfect for when your facing into the sun...like the longer bill on the hat.very pretty on
B00EV5GB9O|4|Too small, I need size 32 please
B000UZAVIG|4|Love this sweater.  Very soft.  Have handwashed it at home and it has held up very well.  It does form those little sweater \\"pills\\"
B00JFB4L5A|5|I tried several different brands. This one did it! You can only tell when you touch it. Tick and incredibly absorbing hence it got me to the point posting this review!!!
B00CONNGVQ|2|I am an avid fitness lover and I do workout 7 days a week and eat a very clean diet. Now that I am over 40 and after two pregnancies, I have gained some weight (I am still small at 123) but gained 10 lbs over the last couple years and my waist is now about 4&#34; more than it was and I have trouble fitting into old clothes. After reading the great reviews here, I gave it a shot and actually bought two of them.  I have a size medium that I sleep in from time to time as it's not tight at all and then I have the size small that I wear sometimes up to 12 hours.  I wore both for over 3 months and really.... nothing. Sadly, I have to give this only 2 stars. I give it two because I did measurements over the 90 day sample time frame and I did see reductions from 1&#34; - 1.5&#34; inches, HOWEVER, this goes back immediately once you stop wearing the waist cincher. It is HIGHLY uncomfortable even after 3 months of wearing and I personally did not feel it was beneficial to my digestive system and rib cage. I would not recommend unless you want to wear it out to a party or an event just for an evening to have the appearance of a tiny, feminine waist. This is not beneficial as a long-term use for a smaller waist.
B00D7UIZ48|3|I did not expect the opening under the arms, so I had to send it back.  But it was very pretty and fit fairly well
B00FPW6QGU|5|xl is really a large, but I love the suit and wore it in hawaii for a week and it wore well.
B00Z3VAV9G|5|Love the colors, it fits great!
B008YI6XFQ|3|Very good and handsome but to small for my 14 year old this is for a one year old child but we love it .
B0002TOZ28|4|Just right.
B00CS181TG|5|My baby is big but cloths seems a little bit large anyways it loks great and quality is really good.
B00JMG1ZD4|5|Love it.
B003Z4YHZ2|5|Bursitis in my shoulder makes dressing a challenge at times so the front closure is a must have for me.  It is very comfortable but not lingerie I would wear outside of the house (&#34;... Leisure Sleep ...&#34;).
B001AQM5W4|5|What a bargain for the price. I used it with my Darth Wader Halloween costume and it was really nice. Half of the price charged on Halloween stores.
B00NNECJ9K|5|So cute and fit perfect
B00CFQIFM2|4|I just ordered 2 more !!
B00843CC10|5|I liked
B00NJV6902|5|Daughter absolutely loved this, especially the sash that you tie in the back of it (more elegant!).
B00DV0O0GG|4|Thank you
B004RQ33EI|5|I got this as a gift for my 72 year old dad.  Oh man, he LOVED it.  Hes got a quirky sense of humor and loves to dress up for Halloween to amuse his kids and grandkids.  He put it on immediately and he and my mom cracked up for about 5 minutes.  He also decided to wear it to dinner at my sisters house, well in advance of Halloween just because he knew my sister and her kids would get a kick out of it.  Haha thats my dad.<br /><br />He was also really impressed by the technology.  The waist band and elastic leg cuffs form an almost air tight seal, and a little intake fan, powered by a remote battery pack, sucks in air and keeps the costume inflated.  If you need to sit or drive a car, just turn off the switch, the fan stops, and the costume deflates.  Cool!  I suggest carrying spare batteries.  Totally worth the money just to see the smiles on everyone's faces.
B00B5WAK9S|4|Nice shirt
B00GSMVV84|5|Too long and where ties up kind of bunched up. Dress is beautiful and fits nicely just shorten it a bit beautiful red color just like picture
B0058YU102|4|just buy a smaller one, the quality and the style is unbeatable.
B000QWA2L4|4|Squeem does exactly what it says it will do. It is very comfortable to wear and slims me in all the right places. My only concern with the product is that I wish they would have put a fabric flap of the hook and latch system as it will show through your clothing if the garment is a bit snug. Overall, a great compression waist cincher.
B006MQGX1G|3|These panties are cute.  She really liked them. I however was not happy with the shrinkage issue.  If purchasing these order a size bigger.
B00774E4ZE|5|I loved this veil, it was the perfect fit for my wedding! The clip is sturdy and can clip into the hair or to a bobby pin. Well worth the cost! and shipped fast!
B00BSE0I3Q|5|I love it and I wear it a lot.. want to get more.
B000W4STTI|2|I owned a pair of these gloves for years, and unfortunately lost one. When I got the new ones, the fingers were very narrow (I have a size 4 ring finger, and the gloves still felt too tight), and the fingers were very long, too. They were just not at all comfortable to wear. The new gloves were also longer over the wrist than the old ones. Happy with Amazon's easy return and fast refund; not so happy with Isotoner.
B00HLQMPCW|5|Very comfortable.
B0009JTGQQ|5|Bought these in drent colors and glad i did. They fit well and hold up great after many washings. I would definitely buy them again when i need new ones.
B004EKDHXY|5|It's a pleasant fit 4 me. More comfortable than the other bras I've ordered in previous months. Will continue to do business with you. Thanks!
B0085VVY60|4|This was a gift but the feedback I got  about the Sweatshirt was very postive and very happy with this product.
B009YR5F50|1|Not a bad looking shirt, if the color wasn't so weird - to me, at least.  Neon coral, yikes.  I was looking for a tangerine, light orange - this is one of those colors that is not well represented online.  Back it went.
B00C2Q8RFU|4|This is my first time buying a maxi dress I love it .I'm short so I have to get heels
B007N71KQQ|5|As yoga pants go, these are perfect.  Good fit, they are very soft, and they are not too thick or thin.
B0009DPE72|5|I love this bra!!!  I have 2 of the nude and 1 of the black.  No other strapless bra I've ever worn compares to this.  It has this clear rubbery band around the top that completely stops it from slipping.  I wear a larger size, and it supports me wonderfully.  I'm now pregnant and ordering some in my new size.  I can't live without it!  This bra will change your wardrobe.
B00NNX0MIQ|5|Carter's is always a favorite!
B009YLKD80|5|My niece absolutely loved this hat! So did I actually!!  Great hat for the price!! Looks like a high quality, expensive hat!
B009YREYU2|5|VERY SATISFIED WITH THE QUALITY, PRICING AND DELIVERY OF MY JACKETS. BOTH JACKETS FITTED PERFECTLY.
B00IOGF7YG|5|My family is going to be Winnie the Pooh characters this Halloween.  I was a little trepidatious about ordering the Eeyore and Tigger costumes but I am so glad I did!  The reason I got them was because the price was great for a full body costume.  Since they ship from China, I figured I would be out of luck if they didn't work out.  They are both great costumes though.  The material is soft, substantial (not flimsy), and the characters are true to their Disney counterparts.  I am 5'5&#34; and the medium fits me well.  I got my husband XL because he is 6' and the XL fits him well too.  These would work for fuller sized people too since there is a lot of bagginess to them.  Our kid was so excited to see us in our costumes.  I am really happy that I bought these.  They take a while to get to you (so factor that in when you order) but not as long as you might expect from China.  I am really pleased with the quality, design and price of these.  I think if I purchased them in a Halloween store, they would have been expensive!  I am excited to wear them for Halloween.
B00MMM470S|5|I must tell you this is a great coat.  I love it!!!!  The size is XP and I have a small frame.  This is a beautiful coat...warm, and easy to care for.  I steamed it after unpacking (which was a great job the seller did....there was little or no effort on MY part to steam out wrinkles)  Great JOB AMAZON!!!
B00NCDGHD6|2|I am a solid small in almost every brand and maker and thsee tanks were extremely tight for even me.
B00FW2L4HY|3|I didn't realize these were work pants (scrubs), and they run large.  Otherwise, they were nice.
B007CRR82W|5|Similar to Carter's fit. Pretty long, not too wide. Good size head opening. Like the way the buttons are in the front. Good choice.
B00ATEFH4G|3|This is a white pant, so I expected it to show a little bit what I am wearing underneath.  It shows almost everything what I am wearing under.  I did not want to struggle to find the &#34;right&#34; underwear just for this pant.  I returned it.  By the way, this fits me nicely.  I am 5'1&#34;, 26&#34; waist and 37&#34; hip.
B00298JTL2|4|I love this bra!,<br />You have to order one size up. I'm a 36H, so I ordered a 38I, it fits perfectly and it's so comfortable and at the same time holds much support when I'm working out.
B00OWA5KBS|3|I thought the outfit was all in one but the feet where socks. It's ok for the purpose of wearing in the house.
B006HYN27Q|4|My daughter looks really good in this coat. The design is great and we both like it. I would defintely reccommend it.
B00JKWEVHC|5|Excellent shirts. And so very soft. Will buy again.
B00GPTFJVK|2|A waste of time, exaggerated and not practical.<br />And if somebody grabs your bulge... get ready to make excuses and escape!
B0007QMKJQ|2|In my experience, &#34;firm control&#34; panty girdles and body shapers only work on women who just have a few &#34;jiggly bits&#34; (as Bridget Jones would say). They don't even fit an overweight woman.  I normally wear about a 16W or occasionally a regular 18. I don't own anything that's a 2XL, except for one incredibly baggy sweater - and this supposed 2XL brief would maybe fit a size 12/14. I won't be buying anything like this again.
B00J2UEV0Y|4|I like them, but they are somewhat small, so in future I will order next size up
B002GCG3YM|5|great
B00EPO3FY0|4|They fit a bit small but are nice shorts.  I like the length and have a difficult time finding shorts that aren't too short.
B00ACIGM7U|5|Great quality, will definately be ordering some more of these.  Comfortable and hard wearing.  Hanes is my new go to Brand for underwear!
B004DULSDG|5|Just needed a plain black pair of bikini bottoms to go with a bunch of multi colored bikini tops. Bottoms were a perfect fit.
B00P458TK4|5|Excellent quality gloves that are comfortable to wear.
B001VNBAL8|5|This belt has a nice look to it. I'm not a fan of the popular reversible belts. I bought 2 inches larger than my waist, and this Dickies belt fits just right. The belt isn't heavy or light. In other words, it doesn't sag if you wear your belt a little loose, and doesn't have a cheap hollow buckle. Not sure why this isn't one of the top selling belts. Looks better than the image.
B00EYBFY3Y|5|Fit me perfectly!
B00JL3RAM8|5|Runs 2 sizes small !! So make sure you order larger size.
B00006IR68|5|I bought this for my 3 year old for her birthday. She is starting to get opinionated about her clothes! She loves it, and her mom and I think she looks absolutely adorable!!! The quality of the item is more than I imagined. The fleece is so soft, the detail of the set is incredible.  I will be back to buy more items on this site.
B0057903EW|2|This thing looks good but it is made of very flimsy plastic.  In another buyer's review, the handle was the 1st thing that broke, on mine the 1st thing that broke was the shield itself.  I ordered 2 shields and both had 3 to 4 one inch cracks along the edges when I took them out of the packaging.  Apparently, the package had been crushed in transit and that caused the cracks in the shields.  You know the veggie party platters you get in the supermarket?  These shield are weaker than those plastic trays that the hold the veggies in the party platters.  I say this because I don't think these shield would be strong enough to hold the weight of the veggies and the dip in them!  After half a day of playing, one handle separated from the shield.<br /><br />My kids didn't want to return them because it was almost Halloween.  So I decided to fix them.  Actually it was pretty easy fixing the handles.  I got some brass screws, black washers and nuts and put the handle back on the shield.  I sandwiched the shield between 2 washers so it is harder to pull the screw with the handle through the flimsy plastic shield.  In fact, I would strengthen the shields this way when you get your shields to prevent having to fix them later.  To repair the cracking edges, I applied 1\\" wide fiber tape on the inside edge of the shield.  This will give the shield extra strength and also keep the cracks from growing.
B00UFJSBQG|5|Beautiful!!
B008QZ9DHW|5|Great product, much better than scarves.  I liked it so much that everyone in my household now has one.
B00QMJOPYA|4|Love the look, love the fit. I really dig this hat. Very comfy (flex - fit awesome!) and looks as good as it fits.
B003GOSOUA|5|This flag I got for a add on item for $2 something for a birthday party decoration and it is a way better quality than I was expecting. Some of the reviews were discouraging, but this product would last outside for quite awhile. For the price th you can't go wrong this is a cute flag for all ages
B001GAP9MC|2|Bought two pair. One was 1 inch shorter than the other and one leg was half inch shorter than the other leg.
B00MRXCCJK|5|Stylish jacket for a great price.
B00VJXRNP2|5|Beautiful but somewhat large.
B001GBFIVI|5|So cute! My almost 3 year old loves it and can't wait to start ballet classes!
B000MXB1XA|4|Great comfortable bra.
B004Y6G992|5|I bought this knife for a movie me and my friends made. It worked perfectly the first 2 days but it broke. But all i had to do was open up the handle, superglue the piece that broke and superglue it back together. It was good as new and it never broke again. I really suggest this item if you want a bigger knife. It also looks real!
B00L3HKW02|4|The red letters really faded after first wash...and that was in cold water
B00KMYFXME|5|These pants are true tosize and have a perfect length....I just love them...just the right amount of stretch also
B00AFUEKGA|5|I agree with the other reviewer who said these were the best jeans ever. Levi's 529 Curvy jeans (straight and skinny) are the jeans I have been looking for my whole life. They don't gap in the waist, they're comfortable, the two button waistband looks cool, and the fade in the denim is miraculously flattering to thighs and hips, as is the construction of the back.<br /><br />If you can NEVER find jeans that fit right due to a smaller waist and bigger thighs/hips then you HAVE TO BUY THESE. I bought several extra pairs so I don't ever have to be without these jeans for the rest of my life. Because what if they stop making them? Please, Levis, never stop making these. But I'm buying a hoard anyway, just in case.
B000N8Q4WW|5|great
B00BBW7SOW|5|I do not tend to wear t-shirts as I am slightly over weight but this is my favorite shirt. I don't know how many t-shirts i ware and they make me look heavier than I am (especially in the chest)  I can ware this feeling confident at the gym. Recommended for slightly overweight guys to skinny guys!
B002U4PRRU|5|Pebbly texture that is soft and comfy warm.
B009S34TSE|5|Beautiful dress and so comfortable. I have received so many complements on this dress. Will definitely be buying from Ever Pretty again.
B00HESUB4Q|1|Too small
B004S9MNHC|1|This was used for a costume so it served its purpose - for a little while, but it is not built to last.  The metal buckle (that you slide to adjust the length) broke the night she wore it for her costume.  Since I didn't pay much for it I wasn't surprised but I had hoped it would at least last for one use!  I have no problem with the shipping and the condition it arrived in, which is why it even ranked one star.
B005WFKO54|5|Prompt service.  My grandson is going to James Madison University in the fall and this purple and gold tie is the school's colors.  He was thrilled with it and is looking forward to wearing it at school.
B0099P2W5S|1|Barely went over my knee and I am not a large person. Otherwise they were cute. On a stick person.
B008F0JJD6|4|Fits well. I like the design. But this rain jacket does not breathe and before you know you will be all wet, not from rain but sweat (especially here in FL). Overall, good quality. I like it.
B002JWF6OC|1|Cards could fall out' No latch or latch does not work. Decided to throw out. Could not take the chance my cards would fall out
B00L38JCT8|2|After just a few days of use, one of the Velcro tabs that hold the lunch box on has already started to rip/tear away from the backpack. I doubt it will be functional much longer.
B00OKB4J5C|5|Good quality
B00NXNZN26|5|Soft, warm, & comfortable
B00865EFPC|5|I was a little worried about the sizing and fit after reading some of the reviews but I just received my shirt and it fits perfectly! It is loose and flowy on the top but just a smidge tighter on the bottom. I am a medium in most tops and that is what I ordered and it worked out great. I also have fairly large hips and it didnt fit too tight or look unflattering in that area.
B00EO1VD0M|5|When I first opened these I thought for sure there was no way they were going to fit, because the elastic waistband looks TINY. But it is very stretchy and these are SOOOO comfortable. A little long for my short legs, but I'll be living in these for the next several months. I bought three pair, I wish I'd bought more.
B001RKKNQI|5|Happy with the looks.
B0061Q4922|2|bad quality
B002PU9X9C|5|Super cute costume! Fit my daughter perfectly, we were worried about that since she wasn't able to try it on. We used the size chart and it was spot on!
B00JQIIN4C|3|Bought it for my sister, who is a huge fan, and she loved it.
B00Q3L366K|1|I ordered these in the SML 6-8 size because in all my other maternity pants I wear a 4, 6 or 8. They are so hard to get on. They are tight and the fabric feels stiff. The panel is stretchy and fine, but the &#34;jean&#34; material is too small below the panel, it squeezes uncomfortable under my waist. The legs are also too tight, not something I'd wear all day...or ever. They are also way too long on me, but I am only 5'2&#34;. I am not sure its worth trying the next size up as the fabric feels too stiff/uncomfortable. I was really expecting a super stretchy comfy material since these are advertised as pajama jeans, I would never sleep in this type of fabric. On top of all that, so much blue dye comes off on your hands and nails as you're trying to tug and pull them on, I didn't even dare sit down on my furniture in them.
B000G7BF38|5|Totally Amazoning!
B001HLG9FQ|5|The hat is well made and looks nice. This was my first hat purchase other than a baseball cap. I ordered a small size and when it arrived, I shaped it how I wanted it and then tried it on only to discover it was too small. You can't return it after you've shaped it so I'm stuck with it. I think the hat is true to size, I've since measured my head and I see I'm a medium so it's my bad.
B000Z7F8W8|1|This item is confusing on the website!!!  Be aware that this product does not have a shoulder strap.  The one with a should strap is called &#34;Lug Jumper Overnight & Gym bag&#34;.  The vender (Matz Market) indicated via an email to me that they are the same dimensions,  same size - only difference is the shoulder strap. I wish they would have indicated that because now I am responsible to return it and I have to pay the postage.  Will order another with a strap but from a different vender.  Not a happy camper!!!!
B00N9UDUH8|1|I ordered this shirt and after waiting 2 months I received a hideous button down blouse with blue birds and butterflies. Annoyed!
B00917OX24|4|They run large so buy the smaller size. I'm hoping since they're 100% cotton they will shrink when washed and dryed.  The feel is very nice.
B00U63UGA0|5|beautiful suit
B00DZEPJ22|3|This sweater is comfortable, but very large. It goes down to the bottom of my bottom, while the sleeves on the other hand are kindof short.
B00EUG29E0|5|I love these socks. Length is great and the fit is perfect.
B006MRBQTE|5|This is awesome. I usually usually wear a 34G (Macy's bra)...it's hard for me to find support considering I'm small,  but top heavy. VS doesn't make my size,  so the last bra I bought was a 38DD from Torrid. It fit but the back was a little lose and straps are so wide and the back of the bras rise up my back.  THIS BRA HERE, is a dream come true. I  ordered a 36E...it holds my breasts up perfect, and the straps are in perfect place and STAYS in place and the back of the bra sits  low enough to wear a halter if you choose without being higher than the shirt. I'm definitely getting another color.
B00CXMZ6PC|1|The shirt is extremely thin material, like a shirt you have worn for 10-15 years.  The color, at least in cyan, is much darker than pictured.  The logo is barely visible on the shirt.  Extremely disappointed, the shirt looked so great in the the picture.
B00FKQLF7Q|3|The fabric is too thin.  I end up wearing a shirt under it to keep my bra from showing right through it.
B00NR6MNF4|5|Shirts are of good quality.  I cannot wait to give them as gift for the upcoming father's day.
B00QEVLIFK|5|I love this dress, and the price.
B00Q0M7D4S|5|X-files rules!
B00MOP2JYE|4|Wasnt sure of the sizes... My daught can sonetimes be a 12 and other times a 14.  But the 14 was wayyyyy to big for her.  The dress is beautiful.  Am waiting for the size 12 to arrive
B008LWXC9U|1|sent me wrong color. Shameful!
B00CH5UINA|5|I bought this for my husband it arrived the day before Christmas (earlier than expected) and fits great he loves it.  It's super soft too!!
B00FW3XV3I|3|Good
B00A0NO6TS|4|Just right
B0090CKIVA|5|The bra came on time and is exactly like the picture :) I ordered a normal b-cup and it fit me perfectly! Normally I wear a 34a-34b and the freebra fit me well. Thank you!
B00B6EAD1K|3|strange fit
B003ZKP9L2|3|It looks good, but if very unpliable, and hard to be made to fit snugly.  Needs to be a bit larger.
B00075ZYHM|5|Very comfortable and fits well
B00JAN9B5I|5|Perfect!
B00LAGWREA|5|My daughter was so happy with the shirt!
B00G322N22|5|Admittedly, I didn't buy these for comfort.  So imagine my surprise when, in addition to their obvious visual appeal, I realized that they were extremely comfortable.<br /><br />A couple of notes on the design:<br /><br />The images don't exactly match the item received.  The pair I got were somewhat...cheekier than those pictured.  They're cut a bit higher on the front as well, more a low-rise bikini than the brief pictured.<br /><br />In fact...overall, I like them, but as I read the description a bit more closely I realize that my liking them is perhaps a bit of luck.  Ah, well, assuming you get the same ones I got when I ordered these, they'll be comfy if nothing else.
B00F77M3YW|3|Although a cute dress, like others have mentioned, it runs short. My daughter is a very petite 9 year old and it was a little short on her. We ordered the 7/8.  The next size up would have been too wide.  Unfortunately we had to return it.
B005OFLS1Q|4|Tipically I use the M size, but the ones I got are too large, that even friends that use L don't want them... I will try to buy it smaller just because I liked the quality and model, let's see if this time it fit.<br /><br />SECOND REVIEM:<br /><br />I got them again now the S size and they are a lot better. They are a little baggy in the back, but maybe they shrink a little when I wash them. I will buy them again.
B00H97AD2M|3|The material was fine.  The sizing was off.  I ordered a small and it looked like a medium.  It was really loose so order one size smaller if you like to have a snug fit.
B00K8LZCPO|1|Far too small. Looked like it was made for a dachshund.... long, tiny, and tubular.  Purchased as newborn gift, but odd shaping and tiny size rendered it unusable. Returning.  Sad, as Carter was such a trusted, wonderful brand, but now all made in China apparently.  Quality diminished, materials thin.
B00SDDKAEM|5|Lovely bag, very natural coloring (online picture made it look more orange than it is). No obvious imperfections. Will definitely continue purchasing from this company.
B00D9OCT4O|5|perfect  great seller and great item
B003WIWGEA|4|The scarf is exactly what I was looking for. Visiting TN for the holidays and it kept me warm in 27 degrees. Loved the color red.
B00LEBVPOE|5|a little bigger then expected but very cute my my daughter loves it
B00N44OR4Y|4|They fit well and keep our daughters feet warm. I would have liked the velcro pads to have been a little bigger so that we could adjust them to fit for a little longer, though.
B00EAT54J4|4|My grandson was very please with this shirt. I'm not sure how long it will fit though. It is alittle shorter both in length and in the sleeves than I expected. I ordered the 14-16 - he usually wears a 14. Nextime I will order up.
B00BXF2GSU|4|pretty pattern.... a little short, but such a cute pattern I dont mind. Its fine for more simple ties....Buy with confidence.
B00N9897JA|4|My grandchildren really liked them and so did their Mom
B004JCQ518|5|Bought these socks for hubby before and he liked them not only for the fit but for the price too . So I reordered them for him.
B00KJ78RRC|4|Good for the price. Really cute
B00NQFM8DS|5|This has been my first purchase of clothing (pants) and I'm more than fine with my purchase. thanks
B00LYLR1UG|1|The backpack zipper broke the first day and the stitches are coming off.... It cost me $3.99 to ship it back for something my daughter could not use.
B00GV2FWMW|4|Comfortable but somewhat larger than I like. The waist is a little loose.
B00MK22H5W|5|Great pants
B00U39F1H0|5|The top is adorable. I got medium and am 5'7, 148 pounds. It's a little tight around the arms but I do have wide shoulders. I'm also slimming for summer. It will fit perfect once I lose a few more pounds!
B00IVLBG1C|4|It is a nice skirt, was not hemmed tho.
B00AKATK56|3|I love the way this top covers your stomach but the description of \\"full tankini\\" is wrong.  Of course if I had bothered to read the reviews I would have seen that the bottom does not come with this bathing suit.  Oh well, live and learn.  I know Amazon knows about this so I don't understand why the description is not changed!
B00SH2HGDC|5|I'm absolutely in love with this romper. It fits perfect. I do recommend if you are a small to go up to a medium and so on with other sizes. I love this romper!
B004W2G25O|4|Great fit! Comfortable and wrinkles come out easily. With Prime membership the response was fantastic. I'll probably get another pair.
B00M147BM8|5|Great company, great product. Wore these on Sunday & they made my shirt collar look much sharper. Looking forward to doing business with this company again!
B003VKQMO4|5|Great costume I got a lot of compliments on it! It was super cute. The only problem was the front had to be adjusted a little because I am a very busty girl and the top just wasn't fitting correctly. But As soon as it was fixed it was no problem. Good material and good packaging!
B00NTUTE9G|1|Fits nothing like picture, not slimming even with drawstrings tightened. Gray color was way off as well, almost a shade of dark gray/purple. Unbiased review.
B00EK93Z8Q|5|Came as expected.
B005UNW09G|2|I was terribly disappointed in this blouse.  The collar and lapels<br />were very wrinkled and they were pressed into the fabric.<br />It was not acceptable for my standards.
B00GRZMDQG|5|I ordered these to wear at an outdoor event in the winter for gogo dancing. They were a HUGE hit and looked so cool for the crowd. Everybody wanted pictures with us. I wear it every chance I get now.
B0083QB160|4|This outfit is totally cute!  The material for the shirt is softer than I anticipated, which was nice.  The tutu is nice and full and the suspenders are stitched at the shoulder so they don't fall off.  The only two minor complaints I have are that the hat is a little lopsided and doesn't sit well on my daughter's head with the headband (but it's still wearable), and there is no closure on the bottom (like a onsie).  Neither of these are a big deal and didn't affect how cute the outfit is or how much my daughter loved it.  It is a really sweet Halloween costume and a good buy for the money.
B00QT35KQ6|5|Very light weight and comfortable. Nice for hot summers
B008PD71AQ|4|The size is pretty accurate. The material was a little cheap but not too bad.  They are very warm and cute.
B009NVZUP2|4|Strong fabric, cuts low, but the cut was slightly irregular.  I did have to get it altered on one side only because the fabric was slightly bulging.  Overall very happy with this though.
B000J38X2A|4|i was looking for a black leather belt and this is perfect, its soft unlike some of the hard plastic ones and for the price i'm very happy with it
B00KZLRR2S|4|Darker than I thought it would be---looks black in a lot of lighting. Great fit and very comfortable!
B003U2G48W|3|I was so happy when this arrived and saw how brilliant the colors are, but after washing it,  the seam started to unravel. The terry cloth is extremely thin and the sewing is of poor quality. It might last a season at the pool, but do not be fooled into thinking this is a plush towel with which to snuggle up your children from the cold waters. The towel quickly saturates, and you are left with an adorable, bright, but shivering little flower.
B00H97ARHI|5|Very good quality, it fills like a real jersey. i highly recommended to anyone. i just wish they make it for adult.
B0083KN466|5|They are soft, well-made & fit my nickname. I will probably order at least one more set. They are so fun plus love the 100% Cotten.
B00TQ3DKOK|3|Very cute and nice color but came wrinkled. Looks like it was not pressed after sewing was finished. I ironed it and had to use a pressing cloth to keep from leaving shiny marks on the fabric.  Hopefully, now I can wear it to work.
B00OVKOZ10|5|I'm thrilled to receive this shirt.  It fits and looks good.  Many compliments to you.  THANK YOU!
B00JUEY850|5|Fits perfect
B00J2D7QVC|5|So comfortable, elegant and love love love them
B00GBT8QQE|5|The hat I got looks exactly like the picture. I was surprised that my hat looked like the picture because of the reviews it got but my hat is perfect.
B0040U60LY|5|This is a great looking shirt! The soft feel of it also a big plus.<br />Fits perfect and is one of my favorite shirts I bought from here.
B00MUII50C|4|I have always loved Rothschild products.  Glad they are still available.
B007KH6DFW|5|Bought for my niece....she loves cut the rope on kindle....she loved the shirt!!!  Even it it says for Boys....great for girls too!!!
B005FW59KO|1|Horrible fit.  I think they are learning how to sew.  I threw it away, it was badly made.  Awkward shape in neckline
B00AIEJC7A|5|I love the Christmas doggie shirt and everyone got a chuckle out of the images of the pups.  Very nice fabric.  Washed in machine and dried in dryer.  Comfy fit and well made.  Thanks!
B00MUIG45A|5|Kept kid warm all Winter - coldest days in MidAtl were met with this and a fleece
B00L7RYKK6|4|The material is cheaper than it looks in the picture but it does for nicely .... I do think it's a bit overpriced for the cheapness of the stitching and material.
B00H3WZ8LE|3|I usually wear a small, and ordered a size up. They still fit, but the material is so sheer I wish I would've ordered a large!
B00I2T1280|5|Robe ran big but not as issue as it is after all, a bathrobe!  Very heavyweight; soft; comfy!  Great for the Illinois winters!  Love it!
B00LXTJHTW|5|very good！
B00DYRMEPK|5|I am a slightly more athletic build than most people and this sweatshirt fits perfectly.  I ordered an XL and I am 5'10&#34; 175lbs of mostly muscle.  The sleeves are a little bit tighter than i expected but if you like a slim fit sweatshirt, this is perfect.  I have gotten many compliments on how it looks and how unbelievable soft it is.  Although it is fleece, I would recommend ordering a size larger than you actually wear.  I wear size large shirts comfortably and this sweatshirt has the perfect fit in size XL.  I would absolutely recommend this to anyone and I have had no problems with it at all.  All the stitching and fabric seems to be high quality. Excellent product.
B00L0L2TAW|5|l love it
B007ZZUYKO|5|This bathing suit is super cute. It fit well and had good coverage. I love the built-in swim diaper - we used a disposable swim diaper as well for double coverage and could totally relax in the pool.
B004OWSI1I|2|Was of inferior quality to the item I had hoped for, Will re-order an upgraded Carhartt coat
B005M0GTPI|5|Great jeans
B00CC74SXY|4|Very cute.  Nice fit and weight is just right for springtime sleeping.
B006JYG5OG|5|great price and great product!
B007W5T7UA|5|I am comercial pilot and i am very happy with this t-shirt. It is soft, fresch and mantain the color. Very good!
B004O0TPSU|5|These were just as advertised, just what I needed.  Fit well, well made, not too snug at the waist.  And a very good price.
B00J45YY7C|5|Great product. The adjustable slide is perfect for when you eat a little more than you should've. Get the perfect fit everytime. Ability to change buckles is pretty nice too.
B002KIA000|5|product arrived on time, size was perfect and item was exactly as in the picture.
B000XTLWOG|4|This wallet worked great for my recent trip - lots of compartments for credit cards or money to be divided up.
B00C5AL61K|2|Needs Improvement: Straps broke on a 1st time wear. Bra Does not stay or stick on if you sweat. Disappointed.
B00FDLXNUA|5|Very nice product
B004L8J0C6|5|Great deal for the money. A variety of sizes.
B00NC5DZK2|5|Nice quality.
B00CTLYJFK|1|These are too small and tight I want my money back. These are not the 508 I have worn before
B006WBX52G|5|This is my third set of bamboo rayon pjs but the first in this style.  I really like the cut and the fit is good.
B00DYP7858|4|Haven't had occasion to use it yet.  Have tried it on and it'll work.  It does have a sheen to it, not a dull red.
B0061KP1N4|4|It's somewhat large and I wish I would have ordered a medium as it's too big. It fits like an extra large, but other than that it's really cool and I get a lot of compliments about it from everybody! It looks just like my Dog Moxie!
B00OSXBVL2|5|like
B00AQW6W7W|5|Like the feel and the way it drapes. The color goes with so many things. Great buy.I got it for a gift for a friend and I know she will love it also.
B00HPLU9QW|2|The shirt does fit, don't get me wrong. The thing is though, both the tie and the pocket are an inch too wide (which makes the tie unwearable at least until wide ties are &#34;in&#34; again) and the material is very rough. I wouldn't recommend.
B00EZVKU28|4|I love how soft these socks are! They are great for relaxing around the house.  They provide a nice alternative to slippers.
B000WR84C2|5|Ecellent Value!
B00JQK9W04|5|Very nice shirt, I'm still wearing it even after the world cup
B0007YXVIM|5|great bra
B005TMSH40|5|The straps were a bit too loose on me and they are not adjustable so I had to sew them up a little. I am rather small in the bust (34a) so on someone larger it probably wouldn't be an issue.
B00ZBZIIVC|5|Exceptional  bag!  Beautifully made!  So happy with this purchase!
B00CPGUIUY|1|There was no mention the dress was completely see thru.  You need to wear something underneath.  I sent it back.
B002N3AMCS|5|This costume was very reasonable and well made. It's VERY cute. I've paid much more for other costumes and have been very disappointed in the quality. But not this one!!! Just make sure you have long black pants and long sleeve black shirt to go with it. You'll be all set to have a good time at your next Halloween party.
B00PO7ZL80|5|Haven't used extensively yet, but this is a great set, especially for the price.
B00BLO4COO|5|it does run one size larger. i just love it. and the fit doesn't bother me that much.
B00LPBYDYC|1|material was cheap and the top wasnt secured so it rides up my chest..very disappointed....
B005GPVGNE|5|This is a comfy &#34;long john top&#34;.  Not something that one would want to wear outside of the house, but it is warm and a replacement for a sweatshirt.
B008X06L5C|5|and she loves them. We wear scrubs at work and it's a nice change from always wearing long sleeves when it's chilly.
B007K9UVAI|5|Good deal
B008S2HGS6|5|love these jeans
B00N3OXP0C|4|I received a ton of compliments on this skirt so it looks pretty and a lot pricier than what I paid for it.<br /><br />cons: No care instructions<br />threads easily<br /><br />Pros<br />You can turn the pleats where ever you want
B00L0X3URG|5|soooo comfy
B007XD7IDY|2|These Zutano bodysuits are very cute and all cotton, however they are $8 at the large name red department store you know well. So, I think that $22 is pretty overpriced.
B00ZFE1YY2|4|Love this suit!! I just had a baby 6 months ago and wanted something that would cover my stretch marks but not look like a classic mom suit. This is perfect! The only bad thing is that it is really stretchy and does not have a lot of tummy control. I am a size 10 in jeans and originally ordered a 10 for this. Had to send it back for a size 8.
B004TF172C|5|Nice hat, very comfortable. I live in a hot sunny place and it keeps the sun out of my head and at the same time its meshy material permits some cool air in. And very elegant style too. Good buy
B00K57BITA|5|I love these underwear they have become my new favorites. I can see if you have larger thighs they might be a little tight. But they fit me perfect! The waist band is very comfortable an doesn't cut in which is a problem I have with most underwear.
B000MP0TL8|5|This is a very good quality hat.  Well made and if you have been in the servise this is the same hat as provided by the military.
B003L7T2TE|5|Fits perfectlly, fast shipping
B00QD4QHSQ|5|Bought this as a gift for my brother for the holidays. He loved it! Fantastic quality and so comfortable to the touch. I would buy this again instantly.
B000VDROUU|5|Wow! Too soft leather!<br />Good quality!<br />Sophisticated sewing!<br />I am so happy!
B00OZT4MGK|5|Wasn't sure what to expect with the low price of this top but I was pleasantly surprised. It fit well, is a  nice weight and appears to be well made. The trim adds a stylish touch. I haven't laundered it yet so not sure how it will do there.
B005UFE8H6|4|This shirt was a perfect way for me celebrate Halloween at work without being too dressed up and it also served as a conversation starter about veganism. The shirt was a little loose on me but that was probably because I lost weight since I ordered it. Since Halloween has passed, I have worn the shirt out in public and have received positive reactions as well as questions about veganism. When I wore it to see the last Twilight film, people commented on how cool the shirt was. I really liked the creativity used in shirt idea along with the design and would definitely buy another shirt from this seller in the future.
B00P9DHXU8|1|it sucks dont buy
B00AYQS6GA|5|Excellent...!!!
B0034G67H2|5|The boxer briefs are too long,<br />the underwear are too short,<br />the trunks are just right.<br /><br />No ride up issues.<br />Great for athletic types and those on the go.
B00EB11FZI|4|Nice pants and material! I'm around 145 lbs and I ordered my usual size 7 and it's a bit snug. It's not too tight but it's a little snug. They don't offer a size 7.5 which I might have needed. But a size 8 would have been too big. Also I'm 5'11&#34; and the length of the pants is a little shorter then I would like. I might have liked a 32 inch in seem instead of this 30 inch in seem. But all and all boot cut pants r supposed to be pretty much skin tight and up around the ankle... So I'm happy with what I got.
B00GIIIT60|5|More comfy than briefs for my little guy. He loves them!
B009796B30|4|Needed costumes for 3 women of similar sizes and this was flexible enough to fit all of us, low quality materials but fairly cute
B00B1BXIOC|5|The material is awesome. I got it for my interest whos been dying to get some. I found these for cheap and they look amazing... and sexy!
B00B81DIGS|5|I had a tough time finding black jeans that were all black - found them!! Straight, long leg. Black stitching on solid black denim ~ hurray!! These jeans could actually be worn for a dressy occasion due to the way they're made and what one pairs with them.
B00T2S6R3K|3|Delivered on time and in excellent condition yet very very small.  Ordered 5T yet it was more like a 3T size.
B00SW2F9HC|2|I thought it was a big and tall shirt, it's shirt compared to other shirts I have gotten.
B00PSVBBJ0|5|Love it!
B00BXEFDYA|1|Worn twice and top \\"leather\\" layer is already peeling off.  Looks ok brand new, but should not be destroyed after ten hours of wear.
B00FMMUWWW|5|I'm 42 waist and xl fits perfect
B00QTBDJI4|3|It really isn't what the picture shows. It's like the other pictures from customers. It's still cute but I really wanted a darker and longer shirt. It fits well but the sleeves are kinda tight and fitting at the bottom.
B009SH5PZQ|3|too big, but nice
B008MA165I|4|I like these.  They are comfy and good for working out.  They do seem a little thin, so hopefully after a few washes they don't wash away to nothing!
B00N3IK9MK|5|Very nice wig for my mannequin...fits perfectly
B0078TGPIW|5|Great quality product that fit just like it was advertised.
B00F3X7Z4I|5|Mask arrived on time. Very pleased with the quality of mask. It looks fantastic! It did sit to close to my lower eyelids. Stuck a small cushion/bumper on the inner nose area and all was fine. I got many compliments on the mask.
B002WJHD3O|5|These are a great pair of socks for when you need to be warmer than regular crew socks, but when a heavy wool pair of socks might be too warm. I typically have cold feet and hands, and wear the Under Armour ColdGear crew socks in the winter (mid-atlantic U.S. region - PA/MD/VA) when I want \\"in-between socks\\" that are not as heavy as thicker wool socks. These Timberland Outdoor Wool Blend Crew Socks are warmer than the UA ColdGear socks. They are soft on both the inside and out,  are not too thick and bulky, and also stay up well (below my calf) without falling down.
B00JR5B666|5|my daughter loves this wallet! It is small enough for your pocket, but still has a full size bill opening!
B00VDFBZSM|5|fit as expected.
B00L5LR9BG|2|Cute pjs but too size runs small
B00B30HIIS|1|This blouse was way too large.  I'm 5'4&#34; and typically wear a small/medium top.  I ordered a small, but it's way too large.  I'd return it, but the return shipping cost was not worth it.
B00FUWZY86|2|The waist on these pants was just a strip of elastic sewn inside the pants... not a stretchy material I expected to be a PART of the pants.  I didn't like the way they fit.
B00LAUB8IW|5|Its so comfy and warm but its a little small at the leg length but other then that its perfect
B00149YRB4|1|The frame broke in my diaper bag (and lens fell out) before I ever got a chance to use them. Really it wasn't that surprising, with the cheap quality of the plastic.
B00Q61ZLN8|5|I love this dress! The model in the picture must be very tall. I am 5 6' and the dress hit just below the knee which is very flattering. It arrived wrinkle free.
B00QSKSTXG|3|I would go with one size up.
B008N92U8A|5|I am the proud &#34;owner&#34; of a 15 year old daughter! We have been blessed and she is an amazing young lady who has many &#34;issues&#34; with today's &#34;styles&#34; for girls/women. We found this dress and she LOVED the &#34;twirlability&#34; and look. It was very modest and flattering. We ordered - and when it arrived, we couldn't get her out of it! She loved the material and the fit. We also bought the petticoat to wear underneath, so she has two different &#34;looks&#34; she can get out of wearing it.  We will definitely be ordering others like it!  They are a little pricey - but very worth the quality of the sewing it has!
B00KY9KXH2|4|So cute!  The baby tee is huge though, but he will eventually grow into it!  :)
B00138X2H6|3|The sleeves were way too tight, even at the forearm, and I'm not a big person. It was pretty, but I had to return it. This brand is apparently sized more for junior figures.
B008R6TX6G|5|These were perfect and you'd expect nothing less from Hanes.
B00APFDF52|4|It was love at first sight and the price just convinced me to get this dress. I needed it fast and with just one email it came within a week which gave me time to get it shortened. I'm not complaining about the dress but it is a little delicate. The material is very flowy and makes you feel like a princess. The details in the front and back on the straps are just gorgeous. I would def recommend this product just be a little careful, it is delicate and could rip. Overall though beautiful dress.
B004UD3US2|5|I use it everyday....and SHOW IT OFF!
B009DVD9BO|2|The seams down the sides are off center, and the gathering where the pants meet the waistband is uneven; so it looks strange on the hips.
B0008EOFWC|5|Most people put up with sloppy jeans that don't fit them.. and they don't look good in them.<br /><br />I'm a hard guy to fit at 5'6 and 125 lbs, 30W x 29L<br /><br />These jeans come in lots of colors and sizes, and they are comfortable.<br /><br />And they are very reasonably priced. I bought several colors and finishes just to have a more versatile stack of pants to wear.<br /><br />Hey some people collect T-Shirts.. I collect these Jeans
B00CJ5XNU8|5|Pros: as soft as PJ's but looks dressier<br />Beautiful rich color<br />Off shoulder can be worn with a cami or tank underneath. (Or not)<br />Great way to highlight shoulders if you like yours.<br /><br />Possible cons: not sure how it will hold up from washings!
B00R7447VA|5|Very sexy and comfortable
B00FHK4LC6|5|This is the most comfy, figure flattering little dress I've ever bought.  Its also very well made with very high quality cotton. Very comfy and fits just as you see in the pic. Note that I am only 5'3&#34;.
B00AARJRFW|5|Great pants! So cumfy and many compliments!
B00D6CONVG|5|This is my absolute favorite dress! It hits me at the perfect length. I am a 40C and it hugs me firmly and stays in place! The thing padding in the top allows me to go comfortably bra-less. The belt stays in place too! A MUST for thick curvy girls who LOVE a retro look!
B00EMG3X3O|5|They look nice
B00K8SCKI4|5|I love the look and the heavy stiching, the material is very comfortable. I would recommend this brand.
B00DJ24322|3|This shirt was nice and looked very much like the picture. The fit was a little small expecially in the arms.  Most of the shirts material was stretchy besides the lace and area around the arm pits.
B00FVRCHHQ|5|Very cool shorts!  Envy of all my son's friends.  I think they are all going to order a pair now!
B000FALDHE|4|I like the pajamas a lot especially since they are cotton. Very comfortable and my kids love when I wear them!
B00EVLQ46S|5|I love these stockings. They are cool and comfortable, and feel like quality. They arrived in a timely manner, and are just as cute on as in the picture.
B00CS1AFZY|5|Looks great! Very good quality, soft, comfortable. My baby like it.
B0002TORIU|4|Great socks! Hope they last as long as the ones I bought 10+years ago.
B00CTA4ZX2|2|Cute pants but poorly made, The  inner and outer side seams run at angle that puts them almost on the front of your leg!<br />Too bad because they are cute....I am using them as lounger pants for around the house ONLY.  I expected better from this Co.<br />Luckily I purchased them at a very LOW price.
B00HD6R1TW|5|Not too short, Not too long. Really cute with all the lace, and the belt accents the dress nicely. Wore it to a party and got complimented a lot on it.
B006FZ2JI0|5|I love my AC. They always fit perfect and are always sexy. They went great with the beaches of Maui HI in 2012
B00JHCOCF6|5|Good Product
B00DS0FAA4|5|very high quality material and super comfortable fit.  I will be buying more of these
B00BUL7FQK|5|Soft, comfy and nice details in the neckline.  Would recommend to a friend.  It has a little satin in the back neckline that's cute.
B00CKBY7L0|5|Good
B008P7ZCK8|5|I just love this little cardigan type thing. The animal print is bold, the jacket is light, and I'm very satisfied!
B00MCW99EW|3|Great belt, good material. Great for formal occasions
B00FGJFAX2|3|My daughter appears to like them.
B000VS2WJ8|4|Looked great!!!!!!
B00IPH4A8I|4|They were cute but to big on my daughter who is 2 1/2 months and fits in size 0-3 months :/
B004O4JKJK|5|Wallet is made from a high quality leather that seems durable so far. Very nice stitching and plenty of storage for a man's wallet. Wallet holds plenty of cards plus has a nice double billfold area to carry around extra cash, business cards, frequent visitor cards, etc. Comes with a nice photo holder that slides in if wanted. I have no way of testing the RFID Blocking capabilities, so I'll have to trust the other reviews.
B00Q88FSVE|2|Ehh, tight squeeze not gonna lie
B001AY2UJY|4|I love these. They are very comfy and have held up to a few washes already/ They are short but do not ride too much. I feel they should be cheaper though.
B004U2L1XY|5|iPlay makes some of the best swimwear for infants and toddlers out there. Their sizing makes complete sense, if you order it correctly. You can't just go by the age listed, but by the pounds of the baby. This is true for a lot of infant and toddler clothing manufacturers. Not all our babies are going to be the same size at the same age! The other review is clearly the mistake of a new mom. This will be the 4th rashguard shirt I've purchased for my son, and they all have fit according to his WEIGHT. We love the iPlay products at our house and will continue to use them until he no longer fits the sizes they make.
B00L6EQEKO|1|The product is good quality but beware of the size.  Europeans obviously think 4XLmeans a 40 inch waist.  These jammers run at least 2-3 sizes small.
B007EI0GGY|5|Love the price. Great Fix. Good Quality Fabric. Will order again when school starts back in the fall. Shorts were higher quality than the uniforms I find at the discount stores
B001F7PFMA|4|I have to say it's a pretty good belt, especially for the price. Leather is holding up nicely and none of the studs have fallen or popped out yet(unlike most studded belts) so I'm pretty pleased with the purchase. Only minor complaint is that studs don't go all away around the front. Just a minor complain though.
B002YQVJL2|4|This bag was sent to me from Jansport as a warranty replacement for the 30\\" Cargo Hold.  It's a well constructed duffel, I don't like it as well as the cargo hold but I can't argue with a free warranty replacement.  The bag is well made of durable nylon and rolls well.  The handle is adequate for my height (5'11\\").  The bag slopes on bothe ends so it takes a little ingenuity to pack it.  Using folders and cubes helps to pack the bag so contents don't shift or get crumpled.  Cons:  no cinch straps on the inside.  The 2 straps on the outside hlep, but if the bag is not packed level and solid if gets a little uneven.  Biggest complaint is the zippers do not have locking tabs.  I put a metal clip on the outside strap and was able to lock the bag using that and the zipper pulls.  This is not a great solution if you checking the bag on any of the airlines.  I'd expect to find the pulls broken off eventually.  But, the bag made it's first trip to Canada and made the trip in good condition.  I packed for a 5 day trip including binders, extra shoes, and some tools and had room to spare.  This will be a great bag for long road trips, I think a second time if buying for air travel exclusivley.
B0009GGT50|5|Exactly what I wanted. Thanks.
B007S0Z2VC|5|This t-shirt is soft and comfortable.  The material is light and thin and great to wear on 90 degree days.
B008MA0BWW|5|My husband liked a lot thanks!!
B00GGC9KAW|5|Great
B000VO746S|1|It's much smaller than I had expected
B00H3829TM|5|Love these underwear ,the fit great .I wear a size 8 in thongs and g-strings.Size 8 large in boy shorts.I got these in a 9.Figure it would fit me .Lucky they did :).Luv, Fruit Of The Loom underwear.I suggest be careful.With these because of the material. Easy snag kind of material.Fast shipping with Prime.
B001O9BEK6|5|I'm glad I read the reviews about how the sizing runs big, I bought the next size down and they are perfect.
B004UUJGHE|5|I thought this costume was well made although the gold paint could have been brighter.  I did go over some of the gold paint on headdress and it brightened it up a bit and looked better.  All in all it will be a good costume for church plays in years to come.
B00PO4TJRM|4|Cute, seems to be working good, i think the wrong one was sent i wanted the RAW unpolished necklace for my baby boy. The one i recieved is polished. Other then that, im very happy with the shipping time.
B004OVEM2I|4|Fits well and looks great. Nice material for cooler fall days ahead. Would buy again in another color next time.
B00UVR7LUO|5|Since I took a chance on this hat, with nary a review and nearly no details, I thought maybe I could help others considering the purchase.  I've never heard of this hat brand, although they claim to have been in business since 1951 (tag attached to hat)  I'm giving five stars because I am pleased with the quality and the styling of the hat.  My hat size is 7 3/8 so, using the sizing chart provided on the web page, I ordered the L/XL.  It seems just about right for me.  If you are a size 7, it might be a bit large, but I'm just guessing.  Still, the elastic inner band provides some give and take on size, not to mention comfort.<br /><br />The hat is not the customary stiffened hat, which I did not want.  I figured the one detail given--&#34;elastic&#34;-- suggested that this was a soft palm hat with an elastic inner headband, and that is exactly what it is.  For under $35, I think this is a good hat and a good buy.
B006M5AJ2Q|3|abit dissapointed as clip on strap has broken
B007X3AKWA|2|Whilst the colour in this T-shirt is brilliant and the knit drapes well it is NOT 100% cotton as listed; it is a polyester and cotton blend.  Quite a disappointment from Marc Ecko.
B004SKTE6O|1|My main complaint is that the black coating on the fake leather begins to wears off after about a month. I have had this wallet for several months now and half my wallet is a tan ish color. I looks pretty bad. I would suggest not buying this wallet.
B004RB37KS|5|Did not know what to expect, but the other positive reviews convinced me to buy it. I was not disappointed. The fan works great to keep it puffed up, very easy to put on and well make.
