B008AK8FHM|3.0|Kinda repetitious and boring after he regains consciousnous.  As a social worker I've heard many a story over the years re NDE's and maybe I'm jaded.  But maybe for newcomers it may be more interesting.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This game is pretty good. You can compete, train and take care of your horse. Also you can purchase other horses with money that you receive from competitions and taking care of your horse.
B002G1YPH0|1.0|No matter which direction you face it, the copper tubes do not ever seat properly on the CPU.  I can not quite figure out why, but I was not willing to attempt using it when it clearly is does not have a tight fit and moves around.  Wiggles.  It does not fit tight.
B007REV4YI|4.0|A solid return to form for the Bond franchise after a bit of instability in Quantum of Solace. Daniel Craig is still growing into the leading role, but he's begun to mix in little quirks and kinks to his performance that, taken together, make a big difference. The action sets, also, seem to be past their growing pains and strike a nice balance between the stark, modern realism of the two preceding pictures and the characteristic over-the-top absurdity of past chapters. Like its predecessors Skyfall struggles with pacing issues, dilly-dallying for most of the first act, but once Javier Bardem finally surfaces around the sixty-minute mark it gets to the point and presses pedal to metal the rest of the way. It's interesting that, while in previous films the villains have been momentary flashes of color meant to shine a brighter light on the hero, Bardem's role in Skyfall often actually eclipses that of Bond himself. He's a brilliant, charismatic, damaged bit of anarchy that's reminiscent of, if not quite as eccentric as, Heath Ledger's turn as the Joker, and Bardem is magnificently unnerving in the role. With the spirited new foil, the return of a few familiar monikers to the series and a dramatic, meaningful finale that's sure to reverberate through subsequent installments, I think it's safe to say James Bond is finally, firmly back in the saddle.

B00826B65M|5.0|Way too early to review whole works of H.deB., his output was staggering. But what I have read so far is truly great. One of my favourites is &#34;The Wild Ass's Skin&#34; (La Peau de Chagrin).<br />One of the early leaders of the Romantic Movement in French Literature.

1572816112|5.0|I use this deck regularly. I thought I was buying it as a collectors edition that I would use on rare occasion and show off the artwork to friends.  But this has turned out to have a surprising richness and depth of meaning.  Each card really draws you in and tells a story.  I find that I am easily able to get into the meditative state that I like when doing a good reading.  And if you want these for the artwork, you will not be disappointed.  These are art.  But I will point out that they might be uncomfortable for people with strong christian beliefs or who are highly superstitious. If you tend to be drawn to the unusual, then you will likely fall in love with these.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love this game!! it is much better than the 1st temple run! more than brave too!!! I love the new ideas they have!!!

B003ODIZL6|1.0|This makes no sense so don't read it I got confused on the very first word it was super weird so all the advise I give is DON'T READ IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1594745692|4.0|I enjoy this deck as a collectors item.  It is fun at parties.  It has that retro Zombie feel that you are probably looking for.  I do not use them regularly for serious readings. There is not the depth of meaning in the artwork that want for a regular deck.  Although the cards are not lacking in personality. For a deck with a twisted edge, but better for reading, I recommend the Deviant Moon deck, which I have also reviewed.
B007NG93CK|4.0|I enjoy Kathy Reich's blend of facts and fiction and her general writing style.  Bones are forever was no different to her other books, fast-paced and helped make my 12 hours at airports and on planes so much easier to cope with.  What I do have a problem with, is paying $15 for a kindle book.  That is absurd, seriously, something needs to be done about the amount of money bestselling authors are charging for the kindle versions of their books.  These days I usually refuse to pay that amount of money, and have discovered many great new Indie authors who are always reasonably priced.  It was only because I was going to have a long day's travel that I decided to treat myself to a bestseller by a favourite author.
B00846REIS|5.0|The story line is very interesting. Makes you wonder what Gideon is hiding from his past when he knows about Eva's past. Keeps you wondering if they will be able to make it as a couple.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Great quality and graphics  but once the score gets up in the millions and higher it shuts off and erases my score. Taking the gems used away and erasing all coins and score from the run. This usually doesn't happen unless the &quot;Save Me&quot; come  up. But otherwise this game is awesome
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|love the way it brings in different kind of ideas and makes them work together so well. Only wish there was more in the game or perhaps a more closed ending where you could see how everything wrapped up.

1143741013|1.0|This volume is indeed Les Misérables, and it is indeed French, but it's only one tiny excerpt of the novel. Not abridged, even -- just the incomplete. The description should be updated to reflect this. The positive user reviews describe different editions.

1451696191|2.0|This is a decent book but i don't think it is the best book about youth and high school angst that it was made out to be.<br /><br />WARNING MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS<br /><br />There were several good things about this book that i liked mainly the simplicity and structure. The structure of the book is in the form of letters that Charlie, the protagonist, writes to an unknown friend. This form makes it easy to transition from each section and makes the book a smooth and easy read. Some passages in the end are pretty good and i found some strong parts in the book.<br /><br />However there were many things that i did not like about the book.<br /><br />Firstly, it seemed like there was just way too many teen issues in the story. Charlie is in his freshman year of high school and somehow in the first 50-75 pages, there is sex, drugs, alcohol, suicide, etc involved. It just seems way too much to be plausible and feels contrived. It would have been good if these issues were explained more fully or if Charlie had more of an opinion on it. For the entirety of the book, only a few pages are devoted to these subjects. The first two pages of the book talk about the protagonist's friend, who committed suicide. We basically never read about the suicide ever again in the book. Charlie's sister has an abortion and one page later, shes magically fine after going to sleep.It was as if the author whipped out a checklist of typical teen problems and checked one after another off as it was thrown into the book. It just seemed incredibly contrived and unrealistic.<br /><br />Another criticism is that the protagonist is not very good or or the execution is just off. Even though he was lauded as a \\"genius\\" by his English teacher, i found that this was hardly the case. Charlie's writing did not seem to come off as a magnificent genius. He writes like a middle school student and not some amazing prodigy that he is supposed to be. Adding to this, he plows through many books that his English teacher gives him and churns out sophisticated essay about them, and yet does not know what \\"masturbation\\" is. Also Charlie does not seem to be a wallflower at all, he is just socially retarded. According to the Merriam-Webster dictionary, a wallflower is \\"a person who from shyness or unpopularity remains on the sidelines of a social activity (as a dance)\\". However Charlie seems to be in the middle of attention most of the time. He somehow manages to befriend a coupe of popular seniors who help him explore the world of drugs, beer, and sex in his freshman year. Charlie just comes off as a mess. His social skills are embarrassingly terrible, and he cries, a lot. Charlie cries literally all the time. He cries when is happy, when he is sad, and everything in between. Sometimes i want to reach through the book with my fist and sock Charlie in the face.<br /><br />I also found that the book had a arrogant aura surrounding it and that it was trying way too hard to be like JD Salinger's Catcher in the Rye. Some lines are taken straight out of Catcher in the Rye and the characters and situations are surprisingly similar. In both books we have two individuals who were troubled by a past event and then undergo some for of epiphany in the end of the story. However Catcher in the Rye conveys so much more emotion and description with its use of language while this book does not. The language and observations by Charlie are incredibly simplistic and Charlie comes off as almost one-dimensional at times. We may doubt that Charlie is such a great character but then we constantly reminded by Charlie's English teacher that he is one of the brightest people that he knows. Even Charlie's friends tell him that he is such a wonderful special kid. The protagonist comes off as a \\"God\\" character, displaying qualities whenever the author wants him to have at that moment. Charlie can be passive, loving, daring, edgy, brilliant, dumb, simple, etc whenever the situation calls for it. The book seemsto tell you what is cool and what is not due to the characters shifting in so many ways.<br /><br />The book is a decent read. It was short and simple so anyone could finish it in a short period. The story had some good points but mainly i found many parts lacking. I found this book to be very contrived and forced. I think the author focused on way too many concepts and I think the book could've been a lot better if there was some sort of overarching theme to connect the very loose structure of the story

B007BFSYMS|5.0|A lot of the reviews I am reading are saying how there is no stop button...press pause. I love the alarm feature and the many choices. I am also very happy about how many sounds come with the app. Many free apps of the day normally aren't that good... but this one is amazing. If I had the lite version I would have totally bought this but I got it for the free app of the day. Listening for waves right now. I honestly don't like all the color noises though. Very well made.

B006LSZECO|4.0|I don't normally read books that feature such dysfunctional people. I was drawn to this book because I really enjoy the genre mystery/thriller. The second half of this book is like watching or listening to a Tennessee  Williams play or watching \\"Who's afraid of Virginia Wolf\\"'. I kept wondering what the wicked witch of the West would plot next and so I kept reading to find out. Very disturbing on many levels but does make us ask questions of ourselves and to ourselves.

B004D5H2M2|5.0|I'm not really comfortable reviewing music, so I don't really do it. I will say that if you know what the Berlin School is, you already know that these are some of the most important, seminal, defining albums in the movement, worth having in your collection. Now that that aside is over, I'll say that I am comfortable talking about remaster quality, recording quality, etc. And these remasters are a notable improvement over my old TD CDs. I don't want to go into too much detail here, but I will pick out one example, from the piece that I'm most familiar with - the first track, the title track off of Phaedra. All through the piece, the noise is wonderfully low, and the overall dynamics are full and rich. But there is one specific point in the track where I had a real thankful moment. At about 11.45, what I will describe as 'bird noises' come in. On the old CD release, the track falls apart here briefly. The 'birds' sound clipped, and the background becomes muddy and torn. On this release, the '95 remaster, the 'birds' are presented with brilliant clarity, and the background tracks hold up under the pressure. This sort of opened up space for the sounds to breathe and come to life is present throughout the collection. I know that these '95 remasters are otherwise available, but I had never owned them before (I have owned the original CDs, cassettes, and vinyl releases of every album in this set, if that counts for anything) and the truth is that if you don't already own some of them, you probably should, and this set is the cheapest way to do it. A very valuable release, and I look forward to getting the next set soon.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|As always, a book that reminds you there is more to life than we ever see or experience. This book has it all, suspense,thrills,love,revenge,forgiveness,acceptance...
B00021R7CG|4.0|Excellent movie for this type of story. Good early acting role for Rebecca Demorney and an always good performance from Powers Boothe.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|I'm sure the author of this book went to great lengths to collect the vets' stories, since they don't usually like to talk about this stuff. These Special Ops guys spilled a lot of blood in Afghanistan. It's a useful and absorbing book that tells it straight, with no glossing over.<br />Dozens of previously unpublished stories about the war in Afghanistan told by Soviet soldiers are collected in the book \\"Soviet Afghanistan Veterans Share Their Stories, Make Predictions. Comparison of Soviet (1979-1989) and American battlefield experience in Afghanistan (Warfare in Afghanistan: Now and Then)\\".<br />It's Available available at Amazon http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00B5YFS66<br />It should be emphasized that this book collects stories by Soviet soldiers who all took part in the 1980s military campaign which have NEVER been published before.<br />And here's something that this Soviet soldier remembers to this day:<br />I'll tell you about something that's been tormenting and haunting me for years.<br />It happened in the end of November 1983 in Afghanistan. Our regiment was stationed outside Kabul, and the division headquarters was in Bagram. We had to fly to Bagram, so we took a chopper. There we hitched a ride to the division HQ, a Gaz-66. We rode standing up in the truck bed, leaning against the cab. We weren't armed--we had turned in our weapons, since we were going back to the USSR. There was such an awful lot of dust we couldn't see anything behind the truck. So we looked forward.<br />A marketplace. Merchants. Women in chador--it's like a sack from head to toe, with a netted slit for the eyes. A donkey drawing a cart--I guess you call it an araba--with huge wheels made of boards. My head was poking out from under the canvas over the truck bed.<br />Suddenly a little girl appears from behind the araba wheel and runs out right in front of our truck. I saw her and started hammering on the roof of the cab. The driver saw her, too. He brakes and twists the wheel to the right. It looked like it was going to be all right. But the girl ran faster, and I felt two bumps from beneath, felt them with all my body. We ran her over with the front and back wheels.<br />The truck stops. We jump down and start looking around. There were three of us in the truck bed, plus the CO in the cab. The Soviet field ambulance behind us also stops. It was another Gaz-66, only with a box and a red cross. The medics took out a stretcher and a medicine bag.<br />Then a warrant officer with medical insignia gets out. He takes the girl by her leg. He picks her up, looks her over, mutters, \\"There's nothing we can do for her anymore,\\" and with that casts her aside onto the shoulder. I was astonished.<br />Suddenly an awful wailing begins. It sounded like a pack of wolves howling. All those women with their faces covered raised their arms to the sky. Oh, how they wailed, throwing back their heads! What do you think they felt toward us?<br />For some reason I thought of the monument to the Soviet Liberator in Berlin, a soldier with a girl in his arms. And here we were, a group of peacekeepers, standing in the middle of Bagram above an innocent child's body...<br />Someone, or maybe it was all of us at once, said, \\"Out!\\" (meaning take off immediately). We jumped back into the truck bed and sped off before they started shooting at us. Remember, it was 1983. That same day I flew back to the USSR.<br />And since then I've had no rest. I have nightmares at night. Sometimes I have drinking binges. And it wasn't even my fault. But those wailing Afghani women! You can't forget a thing like that. I feel like we were cursed. And it will haunt us to our graves.<br />How old was I back then? 21? 23? And now I have to live my whole life with it.

B000NQRE9Q|5.0|I bought this set on sale before Christmas, and am very happy with it. It's cool to see such great movies in such high quality. The packaging was sturdy and adequate also.
B000PDYVVG|5.0|At a company Christmas dinner in December, my co-worker and I got on the topic of this book, and she couldn't believe I hadn't read it yet. I immediately got on my phone and sent the book to my Kindle to start on when I got home. HOW DID IT TAKE ME SO LONG TO READ THIS? Elizabeth Gilbert's writing is beautiful, her adventure is inspiring and provokes so many emotions. I was sad, I was happy, I was laughing, I was just completely enjoying every moment of this book. She also does an incredible TED Talk that I highly recommend you go look up.<br /><br />If you seriously have gone as long as I have without reading this book, buy it and read it already! It's an easy and quick read because you won't want to put it down. The short chapters make it so you &#34;just read ONE more...&#34; which turns into 10 more. Loved it!

B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Many games are in this app.  I haven't made it thru them all yet, but, so far, they are all challenging.
B000SEGUDE|4.0|Most readers already know the basic structure of Cloud Atlas, which consists of six overlapping stories: a mid-nineteenth-century journal written by Adam Ewing, an American lawyer on his way home from business in Australia; a series of letters from an ambitious young composer, Robert Frobisher, to his lover Rufus Sixsmith, about how he has apprenticed himself to an ailing composer, Vyvyan Ayrs, shortly before the rise of the Nazis; a pastiche of a 1970s reporter/detective novel in which feisty journalist Luisa Rey investigates corruption at a nuclear power plant; a contemporary piece about a small-time publisher, Timothy Cavendish, whose brother tricks him into entering a nursing home; a post-apocalyptic interview with an android, Sonmi-451, who has transcended her programming to become fully human; and campfire account told by Zachry, who lives in a tribal world set even further in the future, and focuses on his encounters with a woman named Meronym, whose people still possess advanced technology. Only the last narrative is told in full: each of the other stories is told in part, with Mitchell returning to each narrative in reverse sequence until the book ends, once again, with Ewing's account.<br /><br />I have mixed feelings about this book that have mostly to do with its technical execution. The success of the different accounts, for instance, varies greatly: some of them are quite dull in the first half, but pick up measurably in the second, and it is for this reason that the first-time reader should be somewhat patient with this book. It does drag at first, but as more connections start to appear, it definitely gets more interesting. Two sections in particular stand out for me: the Luisa Rey section is hilarious if you are familiar with 1970s culture, especially because of the hyperbolic way in which Mitchell frames the narrative as a knee-jerk reaction to the times, from the Three-Mile Island accident to Watergate. But the best parts of the book belong to Sonmi, both because she is the most sympathetic character and because Mitchell's technique seems at its smoothest here.<br /><br />Mitchell is a very good writer, but he still has some polishing to do before he becomes truly great. Like many other readers, I did not appreciate the silly flourishes he gives to the English language of the future, and my reading speed noticeably slowed in that sixth story because of it. However, the greater technical flaws lay for me in two other areas. First, Mitchell's characters are not always as interesting or developed as they might be, so that they sometimes seem to be ciphers for ideas rather than complex beings. Second, Mitchell's use of literary allusions can sometimes be *really* clumsy. When Cavendish is waking up from his apparent stroke, for instance, he thinks the words \\"speak, memory\\" in a very unsubtle allusion to Nabokov's autobiography. Similarly, there is Mitchell's decision to call the faceshaper Madam Ovid after the Roman author of The Metamorphoses because, you know, she *metamorphoses* people. Such references are too unrealistically close to the surface of the text, and as such they are jarring. I really wish authors would trust the intelligence of their readers rather than using such clumsy devices.<br /><br />Where Mitchell's novel really hits home, though, lies not so much in the writing, but in the probing questions it asks about human existence. The shifting time periods of the narratives is a calculated tool designed to push readers outside the received political and philosophical assumptions of our time. When we strip these away, Mitchell shows, what remains are the ineradicable differences between weak and strong, which express themselves in different ways throughout human history. Through a logic that is explicitly informed by Spinoza, Hegel, and Nietzsche, Mitchell argues for a qualified version of eternal recurrence: not that history repeats itself literally, but rather that it follows a cycle of birth, strength, decline, and fall in a way that applies equally to individuals, civilizations, and ideas. Mitchell aligns these ideas in the Timothy Cavendish story, which pointedly overlays Cavendish's decrepitude, both in terms of his physical weakness and his out-dated ideas and slang, with quotes from Gibbons's Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire. In terms of its ideas, Cloud Atlas delivers a brilliant, incisive blow to the modern reader's assumptions, a potential for greatness that, unfortunately, is not quite matched by Mitchell's technical skills as a writer.trength, decline, and fall in a way that applies equally to individuals, civilizations, and ideas.

B003VPWXRO|4.0|I actually really enjoyed this book. I don't have anorexia or bulimia, but I love memoirs and I love tales of coming up through a deep, dark hole and rising above it, since it's something I've done myself. I think Portia is absolutely hysterical on Arrested Development, and I had no idea that she'd struggled with something like this.<br /><br />As other reviewers say, she does spent a majority of the book on her habits as an anorexic, her hatred toward the fat on her own body, and the horrible things her &#34;drill sergeant&#34; told her. She does wrap the book up at the end very quickly, but it just shows the stark contrast between her old life and her new life with Ellen. It's almost as if she was two completely different people.<br /><br />Personally, I enjoyed the book and I give a lot of kudos to Portia for putting this all out in public. I think it could help a lot of men and women that have this issue.
B00A0R0CG0|5.0|This movie is very entertaining! It is a great family movie! I think you will enjoy it...give it a try. I purchased it on my Kindle Fire HD (Which I love!!!!!!!), and used my HDMI to connect to my television!!!!
B00AQMQBKK|2.0|Too much randomness in the game creates frustration way too often. I can burn through 4 clues and not get a single item I need.
B002I0J5FG|5.0|Classic, artful games. Very low price. HD, 3D. If you've never played Shadow of the Colossus, and have a PS3 - now's the time. beautiful experience.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|The game may seem silly at first glance but becomes really cool. As the virtual relationship between you and your horse becomes stronger so does your enjoyment of the app. My only problem is that I never have enough gems and I don't think it is right to make people waste money on them. At the very least you should have the option of buying everything with coins because at least you can earn them. Still it is addicting and challenging.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|mlp is the pony commander. that's right, bow before mlp its the wave of the future my buddies and el palerinos.
B007BFSYMS|4.0|It would be a five if I could add new sounds without having to get rid of the current sounds.
B0083ZBW2Y|5.0|I've loved this story since i was a kid. I haven't read it in thirty years and it still holds its charm.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Great book for young adults. It does get a bit heavy at times, just a warning. But overall a very good book.
B007M45PMU|5.0|Received a $5 dollar mp3 credit for purchasing text books & so I was looking for something to purchase within this limit. I saw this under best sellers so I purchased it. I was happy with the music. Great album to listen to while studying with the text books.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I play this game none stop! I love download it RIGHT NOW ! I play it til the battery runs out, when it charges back up I pay it again. Yes it's THAT AWSOME!
B0071T4BVC|3.0|I am a big McCartney fan and got this when it was on sale for $3-4 dollars. If you like that style of music and Sir Paul, then you will most likely enjoy this set of songs.
B00AO2P3GA|4.0|This game is pretty good with its graphics and huge selection of weapons. There is one thing about this game that REALY pisses me off though; for some reason, every time I exit an online match a random number of gold coins/credits will just disappear. I have lost about 50 US dollars worth of credits because of this
B000FC12SM|5.0|This book is just like watching a comic stand-up. Everything is quite true and it couldn't have been explained better.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|Easy to use and a recommended app for all those who are forgetful and want or need constant reminders like me.
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|This is a fun version of the Angry Birds series. O enjoyed it so much that I eventually bought the full version.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|I was very surprised by the twist and it stirred up some bad feelings for me. Otherwise, I loved the beautiful love story between the two main characters and the connection they shared.
B004SIP6LS|5.0|If you havn't seen this movie you need to it is funny,Especially when u consider it was made on a 15,000 dollar budget
B00AREIAI8|4.0|this app seems simple enough.  the graphics are pretty good and the activities are fun.  I like that my daughter enjoys learning about all the things involved with taking care of a horse.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|The one that started the Angry Birds series, not much more to say other than fun fun fun fun fun
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I like the game and its better than the first one there's a giant monkey thing chasing you an  its completely free and sure to keep you entertained
B001S86J2Q|4.0|This  blu ray is very nice, and the movie looks better than I have seen it before. Some parts appear a bit soft, but not so much to distract from the movie. The sound is very good, and overall, this makes the dvd release look pretty outdated. I really enjoyed this blu ray!
B0006OBPTA|4.0|My son really wanted these for Christmas and they were hard to find together. I am glad we found them.
B001NT057K|5.0|A fun movie and a great sound track to go along with it. Could not beat the price when it was one of the special deals.
1455508977|1.0|While I couldn't put this down while home sick, I still can't believe I spent 3 hours of my life reading this vapid dreck. Perfect man meets perfect yet wounded woman. All evildoers redeemed by end. Good G-d, have I lost my brains?
B003VS0CX8|5.0|I viewed this blu ray on a 73&#34; Mitsubishi DLP. This is an absolutely stunning blu ray... This movie has never looked so good! Detail in the picture is astounding, from the mountains and landscapes to the detail in fabric of clothing,it is nothing short of amazing. Color has been brought to life as never before, and the sound is superb. All in all, I would consider this a &#34;reference&#34; blu ray, one of the best I have seen to date!
B009E3EYS8|5.0|This CD is even better then I thought I would be.<br /> This is a must have CD for Zepplin fans
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|It's another installment of the Angry Birds series, not much more to say other than fun fun fun fun fun
B005MSD6GU|5.0|Year after year, Criminal Minds delivers.  During the graphic scenes, I simply put my hand over a portion of my iPad (seasoned fans of this program know when those scenes are coming).<br /><br />The characters (especial Dr. Spencer Reid) are good as are the actors who play them.  Quite a mix of personalities.<br /><br />Very educational program, as I have a feeling the basic theories presented are based on facts and then simply dramatized so we won't be bored to tears.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|It's a cute little game and.love that I can have my own horse and feed her and such. But the rams on my phone go up whenever I use the app.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|It is fun game, graphics are good sometime the screen is not reactive to the touch compared to temple run 1. Both are good.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is a pretty decent version of solitaire with a few variations of the game. A greta way to kill some time.
B00158K0S8|5.0|This is one hell of a movie. The script is fantastic. The camera work is awesome. The sound is amazing. And George C. Scott in his best role in a career of great performances. If you haven't seen it, plunk down the bucks and buy it and enjoy.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I saw the reviews for this book, and just had to read it!  I honestly can't put this book down.  When you think it can't get better, Colleen Hoover throws makes you keep reading the next chapter.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This is an AWESOME series...one of the best I have seen in a long time!  I canot wait to see what Season 3 will bring.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|An easy way to be able to read the Bible and have it with you. Nice for church and ouor church has used some of the apps features for services.
0984725113|3.0|No need to pay for this book, just download it for free after a google search.This is the digital error, after all.
B0046B1KHG|5.0|My 3 year old son loves this movie! It's kid-friendly but also funny enough for adults to enjoy too! We watch it over and over!
B000IYU9IG|5.0|Next to Donavan's Reef one of the Duke's best comedies.  I think this would have made for a great tv series back in the days of the western.
1577314808|5.0|this item has led me to realize what the &#34;come into the present momnet&#34; matters and to experience &#34;the spiritiual energy&#34; here and now
B00AYDC5HY|5.0|Love Tim Burton films and this was no different. Great story nicely done. Would watch it again if I owned it.
B00AYQNOFI|3.0|I struggled desperatly to stay awake.  There were beautiful scenes and wonderful photography but not something I would not re-watch or highly recommend.
B00005R5G9|5.0|This is one of those &#34;guilty pleasures&#34; that as a child of the 80's I can't help but like. McCarthy and Spade together and let's not forget Kim (before Sex in the City). It's fun, silly and stupid....but in a good way.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This was an elegantly written work of art. I fell deeply in love. I was absolutely blown away. It broke my heart.
B009JBZH54|5.0|Not just a great product itself, but also an unbeatable opportunity to update your &#34;DK Trilogy&#34; to Blu-Ray format at a reasonable price. Not only you get the 3 movies, but also all the extras in 2 additional discs (5 discs total). To me that is all you need. Of course, the art-book in pocket book format doesn't hurt either.<br /><br />So maybe the ultraviolet format doesn't work. At least that's what all other reviews claim. I don't know, I haven't even tried it yet. But honestly, I don't care. I paid for the movies and I got them in discs, so that's enough for me.
B009HV2JT8|1.0|This had potential and blew it.  It was possible to capitalize on Lincoln's great strength, historic time frame, and the vampire craze...but this movie missed the mark and came off as just plain ridiculous.
B008TMA1LY|5.0|This game is addicting, only thing is, it needs real money to hire new workers and to do upgrades for the cafe.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|If you haven't watched Homeland yet, you need to order this right now. Then as soon as it arrives, cancel all your appointments and sit and watch this show.<br /><br />THE BEST!!!
B008645YEE|5.0|Maybe you need to like the movie in order to like the soundtrack. I don't know for sure. But I did love the movie so I'm loving the music, too.<br /><br />Advice: Try using it as work out music once in a while.
B004EIZCPM|5.0|I loved this movie.  The acting and storyline was strong, funny, and believable even though the movie was very funny and had some silly moments.  Excellent re-watchability too!
B00005JKGZ|5.0|A great movie...a movie that will remain as a Classic. It has lots of bonus features. And it will never get old, no matter how much you watch it.
B009NQKPUW|3.0|Just cant get into the story.  Is it Scifi or Horror? Felt long with not much action.  Don't explain anything and the connection with Aliens.
1452101248|5.0|I love this cookbook. The recipes are unique and the pictures are beautiful. I highly recommend purchasing this book for yourself or to give as a gift.
B009NPKTN6|1.0|I had high hopes for this movie but it was terrible with a combination of mediocre acting, less than mediocre singing, a story line a 13 year old could have written, all wrapped up in an annoying package...and I was around and enjoing the rock scene in the 80's.  What a disappointment, skip it.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|wonderful it gives a great picture of English life before and during the 1st world war.  it also fortells what might happen post war.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Don't  want to have this type of adventure ever.  Loved the writing style, and the end. Keeps you wondering, learning.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Flow Free is fun and easy to play. It can be really addictive! The harder versions really make you think,, trying to finish. I would recommend this game to my friends.
B004QYTRRS|2.0|I expected this movie to have some thrills in it or intrigue, but it fell flat with a slow moving and predictable plot and lackluster performances by both Depp and Jolie.  Don't bother with this one.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|You will like it, has many  mini games,puzzles and strategy. It's intriguing, story line as good as a novel. And  Is not as difficult to pass from one level to another, if you get stock. There is  a hint bottom that will help you and a skip bottom for difficult puzzles.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|fun app. enjoy feeding and grooming horse. the graphics are good and the scenery is nice. my favorite part is mixing the seed.
B00873GRU4|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book, read it in two days.  Liked Hugh's turn of phrase, and life and loves of people caught up in a large conspiracy.
B00B49L7JY|5.0|It's a great and truly beautiful story, and captures the essence of art and creative work. The family is humble and refreshing to watch.
1402210795|5.0|I have read all of Georgette Heyer's books and this is the very best. All but one or two are excellent. She even threw in a few mysteries during her long writing career.
B009VB97EY|3.0|2 stars for acting and plot<br />5 stars for great bodys and sexy dancing<br />Overall was disappointed in the movie
B002RI9UBS|5.0|I have enjoyed reading this novel, and now I am off to see the movie in 3D. I highly recommend it.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Continued saga. However, just wish they would have combined the 2 threads and made two books out of it...having trouble keeping up.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|love this app.  its like you own a real horse or horses ... I would recommend it for any one who is a animal lover. and who would like to own a horse one day
B005LAIIPS|5.0|Great action. Good continuation of the series by introducing a new character. Sets up mtg. With M. Damon in next movie.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|As always Nicholas has done a great job.  A love story with a twist, you will love it  A real page turner that will keep you going till the end.
0316228532|4.0|In a perfect world, husbands and wives treat each other with respect, parents nurture and protect their children, and people understand and support each other.<br /><br />This book is not about that world.  The characters are real, and they're all suffering.  None are particularly likeable, but don't let that deter you from digging into the substance of the story.  Little nuggets of hope poke out here and there, and the ending left me wondering if maybe stark futility can indeed be changed.<br /><br />So if you're looking for a feel-good, happy story, don't pick this up.  But if you're interested in a profoundly human, compelling story, then go for it.  J.K. Rowling is a masterful writer, and I'm looking forward to more from her pen.
B0031RS2XG|5.0|The &#34;marketing mindset&#34; comes through very strongly (the recurrent theme of the SUCCESs checklist was particularly painful) but overall I really had my &#34;aha&#34; moment. The large amount of very interesting examples (e.g. about why urban legends stick) made this book one of my most memorable recent readings.
B005DOKM9M|5.0|I really like the sleeve. I only wished it was alittle bigger so I could put the power cord and adapter in it.
B006XF5BTG|5.0|Doesn't take long to read this book but it is packed with useful information. I've been following the books advice for 3 months now and it's working well for me. I'd definitely recommend this book.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|Good reading...interresting story...very well written..and story that makes you think about what you were taught about what is out there to beleive on
B00139XTG4|3.0|If I could summarize this book, I would say that normal (Gaussian) and power-law (fat tail) probability distributions are very different. While this is an important reminder and is definitely worth recalling when one uses a statistical method based on Gaussian distribution on a sample set where the preconditions of the normal distribution may not apply, it is too little content. The rest are stories, shallow philosophy, investment advices. Most of the text could be thrown out.
B002VPE1WK|4.0|this is the perfect bag to have as the compartments/dividers are soft and cushioning for each piece of camera equipment.  I actually store in this bag my 2 cameras, lens, tomtom, tiny tripod, cords, cds.. it's great to just have, grab n go.  my only. complaint is that it is bulky and looks goofy on my back.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I love temple run and I got temple run 2 when it came out. when I tried to play it on. my kindle fire. it would never open. please fix it
B0026IQYEA|5.0|Great movie about the beginning of Elizabeth the first's &#34;golden age&#34; Cate Blanchett gives an amazing performance supported by many other great actors.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is fun for no reason other than being fun. I haven't a clue why exactly because it's repetitive.
B001D0BLTA|4.0|I've loved this show for years.  Just recently I watched it with my teenage daughter, and she also thought it was a classic and asked why they didn't make teen movies like this anymore - John Hughes is the answer here!<br /><br />This time around I found I was rooting for Ducky, as was my daughter.
B000002OAZ|5.0|If you love delta blues, you need this. This is the album (now CD) that started it all for me.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|If the first Temple Run wasn't good enough, this has even more to get addicted to!  longer runs, new powers, new monster, same amount of hours enjoyed of endless chances to make away with that idol!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|A friend suggested I watch the show and now my entire family is hooked! The actors are superb and the mother is a hoot!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|the book reminds me so much of my own youth...falling in love..the<br />Author does an excellent job of not only keeping you in suspense<br />But also the girl in the story..really enjoying it..great to have it on my Kindle
B000005GWH|4.0|Richard Elliot is one of my favorite saxophonists.  There is absolutely nothing else to say about this artist except that he is brilliant.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|This is a fun game but when you trip the monkey catches up to you. Then when you jump you can't see anything
B007IXWKUK|2.0|The first book of the series had a very interesting story line.  This second book doesn't really engage in the same manner.  While it's an interesting read, it isn't very believable.  I'm embarrassed to tell anyone that I read this book!
B009HEJXFS|5.0|We thoroughly enjoy MIB3.  Great fun!  We especially enjoyed the way it wrapped things up but left us open for more!
B005XZHQKY|4.0|It really look so real that you are in the sea with those divers. Try it with 65&#34; TV Full HD with best results.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love temple run it is so fun I suggest you buy temple run it is so fun I just want to play it all day
B001BFFTO0|5.0|Super soft Leather, they feel like a Jacket would.  Stitching, Sole even the laces are all high quality. These have taken over as my daily throw on boots.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I absolutely love this game! The the graphics are better and there's so much more to it. I did find it a bit more visually distracting then the first one because of how much of an improvement this is to the first one which makes it a little more challenging but after about two or three rounds I got the hang of it. Buy it! -It's so much fun.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I really love this game!  I have become quite addicted as a matter of fact I cant believe I even stopped playing long enough to review it.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|One of the best games I've ever played. I've never been so a addicted to a game before. I love it!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is an app similar to temple run, but way better.it has a reason as to why the character is there and<br />What he/she is running from actually exists.
B006ATJXQW|5.0|it tells how it all started. I loved the trilogy and I loved this book. A good read for anyone.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|at first this app was so addicting and I couldn't stop playing fut now I'm very frustrated with the app because I click on the app it loads for a little and then goes back to my home page every single time I'm half tempted to uninstall it.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|Fun game for all ages adults and children great way to pass the time by the only thing i don't like it's a little slow
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|This is a pretty good game on Google play. Not bad to play on a lazy day.<br />Zumba zumba hey can we play more of this game?
1439156816|4.0|I really liked the fact that he started with a somewhat autobiography. Very interesting and it's nice to know the person behind not only this book, but multitudes of books. I like his tips on editing, writing in active tense, and allowing us to look at some of his first drafts that were, uh-hum, terribly written. Nice to see the master is human when it comes to a first draft.<br /><br />I was looking for a bit more knowledge about writing and I got it.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This app is great and FREE I love it. I think this is a new game my friend passed it on to me. hope you love it
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This  is the best book ever. The suspense in this book made me never put it down. Well written and very heartfelt
B002PEP4SC|4.0|I thought it was very impressive for a promotional book , very well written, I could almost see Castle and Beckett talking , they might as well not even bothered switching characters names around
B009H442DG|5.0|What can you say. After all these years Olivia still has the voice to sing anything she likes. John still has it too
B0070Y46UY|5.0|absolutely loved it. Beautiful and thought provoking. Would recommend to anyone who loves zoology, religion, adventure, or simply to read.
B008JFUUIA|5.0|best movie ever i love it so much if your reading this and your a teen u will love it
B0091REZMW|5.0|I love it. there's always a quest to do so you never get tired of playing it. when you complete a mission a little more coins wouldn't hurt.
B009M1QRM8|4.0|A good read, and leads on nicely from the last, good suspense and action, even if some of the storyline was a bit far fetched
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I was not expecting this book to be so good. I'm not a fan of twilight or Harry Potter . I thought this was going to be in the same  category. I was wrong. I couldn't put the book down.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|It was a sad story about two friends and their families who lived next<br />door to each other. Suicide is always a terrible  in my mind. I think<br />the girl in the story should have told her boyfriend she was pregnant.<br />I am glad the boy wasn't convicted of the crime. I was hoping that<br />the two families would once again be reunited but to no avail.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|well I would have to say its a little too much there is a lot of things when you will only see it for 3 seconds. I would recommend the app but its just a little slow as well. but the good side of it is there is a different app that is just like it because it is a really entertaining game!
B005HEDI3K|1.0|Though I'm a fan of anything Star Trek, these files do not play at full screen. It appears in a small square in the center of 1/4th the screen. There are no instructions or options to play at full screen.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|awesome great to help me go to bed. i wish the app had more sounds. well worth the money, buy it!!
B0091REZMW|4.0|I like this game. It is very addicting. Hidden object games are fun to play. Can't get enough of them.
B00AA7O22U|5.0|I thought it had a lot of action and some of the cute sayings they other movie stars would use.  &#34;I'll be&#34;  &#34;lone wolf&#34; etc
B007HACDLK|5.0|This is my first Vince Flynn book and now I see why he's gotten so much attention. Strong action, compelling characters and a superb understanding of his topic. More!
B005LAIH2C|5.0|My grandfather and I saw this film Saturday night. I knew I would enjoyed it but I really loved it! I loved the story line that after Hansel and Gretel encountered their first witch as children they make it their holy mission to be witch hunters.  And there was a twist with Hansel and Gretels mom. I also thought they picked great actors for the movie and Jeremy Renner and Gemma Arterton were of course the ones that shined. I was surprised critics hated this movie but don't go by what they said, if you like magical twists on fairytales go see it. I will warn you that this is not a movie for children. The witches were very frightening and they made me jump. And there's a lot of cursing and violence so it's not for the little ones. I hope you enjoy it like I did. This film I felt kicked Snow White and the Huntsmans butt by far.
B00APUYWYA|1.0|While the trailer shows some fun moments, the actual movie is dull and bland.<br /><br />What really upsets me is the portray of Asian students in this movie: They are unfriendly, wooden, and weird.<br />Nowadays it is politically incorrect to make fun of African Americans. But it is alright to make fun of Asian Americans, as this movie does so with no qualm.<br /><br />Either the writer of this movie has not seen enough Asian students who are fun and spontaneous, or he holds a strong prejudice against them. Such prejudice is blatantly shown in this movie, which adds to stereotypes of Asian Americans.<br /><br />In a society that promotes tolerance and denouncing racial discrimination, I am sad to see this movie carries such strong racism, and creates more racial intolerance.
B00A6N8F4Y|5.0|It was a very good movie and everyone played there part well.Lois of excitement. I like action movies and this was great action.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|My favorite author this book is just another great example to why. New topic great details loved it like always
141659521X|5.0|this book is awesome if you're a nerd for espionage and counter-terrorist stories.  luckily for Vince Flynn, i'm really a nerd for them and i especially like mitch rapp.  i doubt an actual person like him exists (kinda hope so though), but maybe one should.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Much better than old one liked the new monster and that there is only one no complaints just a really good game
B00A0SKFLG|5.0|I expected it to be a lot like the first Total Recall. It was as good as the first in its own way,.
030758836X|4.0|The plot is captivating.  I'm typically a slow reader, but finished this book in two days.  Gillian Flynn understands married life and puts a Alfred Hitchcockian twist to it.<br /><br />What is a bit strange about the writing is that while Amy is describing historical occurrences through her diary, she uses the present tense.  Diaries typically use the simple past and it would have been, in my opinion, the way to go.  Nick, who is describing what is happening \\"now\\", uses the past tense.  I would have liked his narrative to be in the present tense.
B005IU1OMA|5.0|This snowboarding video is awesome!! My family loves to get together and watch it! Out of all the ones I have, I have to say that this one is definitely the best!! Love Travis Rice and all the guys featured in this film!
B00AESN8XY|5.0|I don't have to much to say other than that its awesome and is worth buying and it really passes time
B009VB7QQA|4.0|It was a good movie and I love vampire movies. I think the way the movie had included the South in the Civil War was very good.<br />and added to the content of the movie.
B0079R8IYW|3.0|It needs to have a place to put the pointer/pen.  It does a good job of holding my kindle in place.
B0084IG8TM|5.0|For the most part, the casting for this movie was great.  I loved seeing what I had read on screen.  I really feel like the movie did the book justice!
B009X01GJ2|5.0|The case is exactly as advertised and works perfectly.  I really appreciate the ability to turn the device while it is in the case and to be able to charge it while the case is closed.
B003KRJNBW|5.0|I loved it. Densel Washington played a wonder part, he was ruthless but also very kind. I think put a thought into the making of this movie.
B003L20IHE|4.0|I have just watched this DVD and I found it very interesting on many levels.  However I do realise that it was meant for a younger audience and now I am going to forward it to my teenage godson who has just fallen in love for the first time as I am sure that he will enjoy it much more than I.<br /><br />All the actors in the movie are very charismatic ( I was surprised to see Ray Liota acting a nice part in it, as he always portrays a baddie, and it must be a nice change for him this time).  On the whole it is a pleasing movie with a moral to the story which I wont reveal for all those that intend to purchase this movie, but again I will state, that it is mainly for the young at heart or for the young in love, and viewers will not be disappointed in any way for purchasing Mr. Charlie St.Cloud and Zac Efron is very easy on the eyes as well, as any teenager will tell you.<br /><br />Sophia
B00APUQRPC|3.0|I'm not a Clint Eastwood fan, but I am a fan of Amy Adams and Justin Timberlake.  The movie was your run of the mill Hollywood movie.  Neither fantastic; nor bad.
B00B2V66VS|2.0|Temple run 2 is to hard for my own 34 year old son and daughter this is a very long time ago when I was in my late 40 &quot;s I used to play with my kindle and the game temple run 2 is harder than the game temple run the 1 st...
B009VB97EY|3.0|Not the worst movie I've seen - and I like a majority of the actors (Channing Tatum is beautiful of course) and seeing them 1/2 to 2/4 naked was nice - but overall it was just ok
B009XY97VC|4.0|I have archangel and invincible, and this is pretty much more of the same. It's the most epic workout music ever! You can always go another set because these songs make you feel like you're in a movie. My only gripe is that some of the songs have words, which just threw me off.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I've read all 3 books.  I couldn't put them down.  I was truly disappointed when I reached my last page.
B00B2V66VS|2.0|a few days after I got it on my kindle fire, it wouldn't load. I uninstalled it, and when I tried to download it again, it wouldn't work. now whenever I click on it, it goes to different apps.
B006GHA9VQ|4.0|It's a good sequel to Phantom of the Opera.  It does take a while to get into, but keep an eye out for all the references (visual and musical) to the original play.  It takes several surprising twists and turns, and you may gasp at the end.  The music is not as memorable as the original, but I was surprised to hear some strains of it in the PTO movie.  It is a good sucessor to Phantom of the Opera, and its' Blu Ray presentation is absolutely beautiful.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|Really enjoyed this book, but was puzzled by the ending. Wished it had been different, but don't know in what way.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|This game is totally fun. It teaches you how to take care of your own pets. You really should get it.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I like it but the bad thing is i want an update soon cause this game is fun please update soon so it can be like pc version so you can use chests ,eggs and make tnt detonater
B00AREIAI8|4.0|It's an interesting game. It's fun and keeps you thinking. I wish it gave more options in choosing horses and not needing to buy stuff to compete in events
0425252868|5.0|Once I started reading I could only put it down to eat and sleep, great story, great writing, a must read for any WWII, aviation or history enthusiast.
0345803485|5.0|My wife read this book in no time and I got the good end of the readings. Kinky kinky. Yes Yes.
B004L35GAQ|5.0|this is a funky album, not sure if I really like it, but it is ok. I dont mind having it in the changer. would not have bought it if I had heard it before. not good sound quality
B003O86FMW|5.0|This was a great series.  Enjoyed all three books and so easy to download.  Very convenient.  Have downloaded several books already.
B003NB8KE6|5.0|Really great For recovery... I've been using them daily after workouts for 8 hours or so.  Light compression isn't suffocating but substantial.  They seem durable enough to last well.  Shipped quickly
B008HK3XU4|5.0|Fits the kindle wonderfully for both reading and watching videos.... I have no trouble with both the earphone jack and the charging dock being open.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Easily gives you the weather where you are so you know whether to wear a coat and the weather at your destination - across town or across the country - so you''ll know what to take with you.  I use it every day and usually several times a day.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Not exactly the writer of the century, but the book was deeply engrossing.  I couldn't put it down.  Very grown up topic, though.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Awesome<br />We get gaff  gifts eggs grubby c.f. high. Hang ( did high gig Hugo igniting Hough if hi if h :-) high chin v c.f. gig. Church hugging hang. John Yves f2f h by high  though banging gang hmm uhh
B0013TTLDE|5.0|My second read novel from Kate Morton was no disappointment!!! Wow!!! Absolutely loved it! Great job!! now on to the third one!!
B003VR5PPY|5.0|I love this item. It's exactly what I wanted. I use it almost every day and I couldn't see myself without it now. Though I did find it a bit confusing at first.
B002RVZV9K|2.0|U2 is my favorite band, and The Edge is one of the reasons.  I saw a brief clip of this movie on Utube, profiling him..I thought, boy, a whole DVD profiling him and the other two musicians should really be awesome.  Watched it, and wished I could have got my $ back
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Imagine the joy of victory in obtaining the golden idle. You take it in you hands when a mammoth thing chases after you. One little trip and you will not have a nice fall for if the giant monster doesn't get you then gravity will. Addicting and awesome.
B008HK3XOU|4.0|Provides attractive protection for the Fire HD.  Especially like that it turns the Kindle on and off automatically when open and closing the cover.
B001J1K5IG|3.0|This movie is not the best, but is an accurate and interesting depiction of Wyatt Earp. If you are fan of his like me, I think you would enjoy this movie.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|Just wanted to give this set a five star you can read all the other reviews for the details i go youtube.
B00AQ3K8IU|2.0|Looking at the reviews I genuinely thought this was going to be a page-turner but it took all I had to keep reading it.  Not very interesting and by the time the &#34;secret&#34; is out I had lost interest.  Would maybe recommend to a teenager.
B0076DELIG|5.0|Connelly never fails to deliver. His characters are fully developed, the story always amazing. Can't wait for the next one.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Good game. Great graphics, challenging puzzles and entertaining story line. Wish it had been longer. But all and all it was worth the $2.99 price.
B009738XXM|5.0|....and that's a good thing<br /><br />-Light hearted tunes, upbeat, brightens my day anytime.<br />-Beautiful voice<br />-More than a memory describes almost every dating folly for 20 year olds now a days
B009EEFTMC|5.0|I find this game new and interesting everytime I play it.  Never the same pattern twice, so it's like a new game evey time I play.
B001EQ5ZJK|5.0|The mind can either make us or break us.  There are many good things in this book about over coming our mental blocks.
B0011NVCSO|4.0|It's very cliche to buy Bon Iver on vinyl isn't it?  It's a great album though.  The self-entitled release cannot compare to this one.  The songs are well written and beautifully executed.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|As soon as I got this book, I couldn't stop reading it! I'm almost done with it and I still can't get enough of it! Even though this book doesn't have a plot and it's literally all about sex, there's something about this book that hooks you into the series. A lot of readers say the writing is terrible, but honestly, I don't see how it is; in my opinion I think the writing is one of the best!
B0092MKFIY|4.0|Would have liked a little more variety but all the same very good. The singing is almost like the shins
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I love this series! I can't wait for the next one to come out in May. I will preorder! thanks
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this is the best game ive ever played.i have 2 horses beauty and spice. ive played it for weeks youll love it. if you like horses youll love it.i kmpw i do itis a great game.
B00AMBH70S|3.0|By and large, it is a good escape movie but Jeremy Renner is not Matt Damon so don't expect him to be.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|THIS APP IS BOSS!!!!!<br />The game is super addicting and i can not put it down. It seem that these dragons speak to me when i play. I even like that when it loads i get the tips from the creators on what not to do and what dragons you don't want to pet!(LOL)
1451695195|4.0|Good read, not sure I believe a coma is a NDE? But was glad to hear he saw dogs in Heaven!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This version is woo much better then the first Temple Run :) it works great on kindle fire. I have trouble putting it down it's so addicting. A must have app :D
B00AMBK0X4|2.0|I am being generous to give it 2 stars.  There were funny parts, but mostly just ridiculous.  Risqué, off color or just silly does not always translate into humor.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book was a more edgier read and having Peeta play a bigger part was great. I'm excited for book 3.
B006RXQDH8|2.0|I can put up with this director's questionable tendencies in other films he's made, because they are quite good. But this film was nowhere near the same caliber and was not just a waste of my time, it actually offended me in its treatment of Japanese cinema and thus helped me understand why some folks are refusing to see Django. In fact, it convinced me to boycott that film too
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|This game is a nice change from the original and lots of fun for my grandson.  We like taking turns to see who can win.
B007N5YIUS|5.0|Great for kids and adults the same.  Fun as always! and challenging which is fun for kids and adults....good job
B004JZBGWI|5.0|I use it all the time for quick notes and even work notes. I love that it automatically saves. It has text and checklist feature, and be easily sent to others.
B008ASLNN2|3.0|Nowhere near as witty, spontaneous or risk-taking as the first episode. Slapstick humor and mindless adventure is all that's required to entertain it seems
B007L3BMGA|3.0|It's indeed a well written book, but frankly I think it's quite 'normal'... yes, the plot is intresting, but I believe there is too much emphasis on the kinky parts, and not enough insights on the characters.
B007BFSYMS|4.0|It helps me sleep. Very good. I use it every night. I like some of the sounds. Goodnight. I had no choice but to write this reciew at 3:23 am.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|Me gusto mucho el producto, llegó con varios días de anticipación. Espero realizar más compras de este tipo en el futuro. Gracias
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Very user friendly! A must-have! Needed a calculator to do my budget and this was perfect. Thank you for making it free!
B0086700CM|4.0|I thought it was really awesome till I played temple run2{&bull;&infin;&bull;}:)also my sister and brother loved it:D its so fun
B007QXWV1U|1.0|This does not work. As soon as you open it it shuts right back down. it is a complete waste of money.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This is the best game I have ever played only if there were different places to pick like jungle or city that would make it cooler
B000001FDK|5.0|I love this movie!  I am glad to have the soundtrack as part of my collection now.  An oldie but a goodie :)
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I enjoyed them. They were great! I am totally enchanted with the series. I would definitely recommend all the seasons.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This is an amazing read! So suspenseful but romantic. Heart aches and tragedy that helps two hearts,  brings them together in the best ways.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|This is one of my favorite guilty pleasures on TV right now. Yes, it's gory, bloody, and everything else combined that makes for a good horror fest. The script, actors, filming, backgrounds, storyline all combined make for one heck of a good television show, definitely not for kids. This is late night stuff, and only if you're a horror fan. Jessica Lange is fabulous, and so are so many of the other stars in this high quality show. I definitely give this a two thumbs up. (By the way, when my husband walks into the living room and sees me watching this, he thinks there is something seriously wrong with me for liking this show. I disagree, I just think it's an excellently done, highly polished production, of which I am an avid admiror ;)  )
B005LAII80|5.0|Dredd is probably the best comic adaptation of 2012 and certainly the better Dredd movie of the two. It's a tightly focused film, with a great dynamic between the fully helmeted Karl Urban and Olivia Thirby, fantastic action, and a great soundtrack. It's a great throwback to '80s action films and definitely a must watch.<br /><br />Pros<br />-Movie is great and plays in VLC with no problems<br />-Special features include a nice little commentary on the history of Dredd<br />-Digital download is a code, not an extra disc<br /><br />Cons<br />-Slo-Mo scenes look a bit underwhelming in 2D<br />-There were some spots in the movie where there was a lot of red and green compression artifacts.<br />-Most of the special features are short
B00AECGQF2|5.0|I loooove toba boca apps, used them on iOs before and all of them were constantly used by my 7 year old and my 3 year old...great design and kid friendly!!
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Very challenging. I love trying to earn the stars for time. Like that it rearranges the tiles to get all your matches.
B00APUQH0W|5.0|Eastwood plays real, age appropriate roles & is still a &#34;tough&#34; guy in his own way. He is the genuine item.
B003O86FMW|5.0|easy, entertaining read. can't wait for the movie.  reread all three on my kindle to get ready. great book for young adults.
B009329ZF2|4.0|Moves fast.  Fun.  Action packed.  Rihanna is better than I expected.  Lots of action.  Other worldly fun.  Will there be Battleship 2?
B0097JYVAU|4.0|I am old [67]. I am tertiary educated from a sandstone University Uni of Queensland]. I love maths and I enjoy reading about predictions.<br /><br />The author is more right brain than left hence perplexing
B00B3EJ0OY|5.0|Although a movie set in the time of the holocast could be very depressing, this movie is a love story about the love of a man for his wife and his son.  It is such a beautifully written story, I could watch it over and over.  The father uses humor and game playing to get his family through time in a concentration camp when everything else seemed hopeless.  I would recommend the voiceover edition rather than the subtitles.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I think this version really makes you have to pay full attention, not much room for error.....enjoy it for hours!
B008M34INW|4.0|Movie was better than I expected.  Interesting & lots of action for male viewers in my life.  I would watch again.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|So extremely well done! Cast is incredible. Dialogue is precise; not an unnecessary word is spoken. We are completely caught up in the drama, and totally delighted with the occasional whiffs of humor.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|1.Shipped fast<br />2.In good shape.<br />3.I like the product<br />4. This was exactly what I was looking for<br /><br />Thanks for sending this so quickly.
B008K8VDPU|5.0|lots of fun! not so easy for one who is not musically inclined but I feel like I am learning how to play music.
B004RZGUBM|5.0|I had downloaded the free versions, but decided to buy this one, glad I did! There is an intro to each piece with a bit of history and that it was his 1st writing etc, and some other info. The content page is clickable, and there are illustrations!<br />This is my first time reading Dickens, so I really appreciate reading from the beginning as they did when his works were first published. I'm on the 3rd writing, just finished Oliver Twist which is a deep book and very thought provoking. There is a deep insight to people and different moral and immoral characters - a truly gifted author. Classic for a reason!
B00AYB0TOW|1.0|This is the kind of movie that is the root cause of today's massacres.  It glorifies brutality, public shoot outs, killing and maiming.  Really sick!
B0074B2F1K|4.0|SAM COOKE: 8 Classic Albums Plus Bonus Singles.<br />  This four CD set of songs, for the most part contains a mixture of old jazz standards and old rock songs.<br />  Disc One has old favorites like 1.) You Send Me,  2.) The Lonesome Road, 3.) Tammy, 4.) Ol' Man River, 5.) Moonlight in Vermont, 6.) Canadian Sunset, 7.) Summertime (Part 1), 9.) Ain't Misbehavin' 21.) Accentuate The Positive, 25.) My Foolish Heart, 28.) It's The Talk Of The Town.<br />  Disc Two contains familiar songs like 5.) Ain't  Nobodys  Bizness (If I Do), 8.) Let's Call The Whole Thing Off, 11.) They Can't Take That Away From Me, 13.) Only Sixteen, 15.) Everybody Loves To Cha Cha, 16.) Blue Moon, 19.) You Send Me,  25.) Summertime (Part 2), 26.) There I've Said It Again.<br />  Disc Three includes 6.) Under Paris Skies, 7.) South Of The Border, 8.) Bali Hai, 10.) Arrivederci Roma, 12.) Jamaica Farewell, 14.) Sweet Leilani, 19.) Wonderful World.<br />  Disc Four contains a number of  famous old songs, 2.) Mona Lisa, 4.) The Great Pretender, 6.) Unchained Melody, 7.) The Wayward Wind, 8.) Secret Love, 11.) Cry, 12.) Venus, 13.) Swing Low, Sweet Chariot, 15.) They Call The Wind Mariah, 18.) Chain Gang, 19.) Grandfathers Clock, 20.) I Dream Of Jeanie With The Light Brown Hair.<br />  There are a few minor sound glitches on a couple of songs, but no other problems. The sound is clear and the music is enjoyable. The only glaring problem with this CD set is the lack of any liner notes. That's kind of a second rate way of doing things.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I have not finished the book yet, but it has become really intense as I get toward the end.  Spakrs always writes such great books and you can never second guess his endings.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|This is such a great game. Wonderful design. Plays very well. No glitches. Very fun. Anyone who is a fan of My little pony or Farmville type games will love this app.
B00785P2QC|4.0|very addicting! just got this and can't put it down! sadly like most games these days you have to buy things with real money to get anywhere in the game, but it pays off because eventually your city income is quickly replenished by the different buildings you add and the more you upgrade items the faster you income increases. overall a well designed and smooth running game.
B0063IH60K|5.0|i dislike the fact that every new game starts with an add that is annoying but once it is off the screen and back to the game i love everything about the game!
B00APUQRPC|5.0|Whoever wrote this screenplay must have had serious issues with his or her father.  The father - daughter dialogues about her upbringing, or lack thereof, will break your heart. But, in the end, it is an uplifting motion picture.
B009JBWOU0|1.0|I bought this for my niece for Xmas. It arrived VERY late, and she has just settled down to watch it, only to find that it does not play in the UK!<br /><br />I paid a lot of money for this, and it's hopeless.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This was a great read - I couldn't put it down. I highly recommend it. Lots of twists that keep you guessing until the end.
B00A8SPNYW|3.0|Time killer, not great but not bad either. Got this app for free on amazon so I cant really complain.
B0083P1QUM|3.0|I found this to be one of the best Scarlett novels to date. I am looking forward to next one.<br />Kshafer
B0094U0RJQ|5.0|If you have listened to Dylan's last few albums and liked, then you are also going to want this one.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|I have not had an opportunity to use it yet but I am sure I will on my next trip.  The  variety is amazing and extra downloads are a huge plus to keep the app fresh.
B00A0SQBDM|5.0|so far I like this game...g5games always have good story and I like the fact you can zoom in or zoomout effect...plus this game has hints with no purchasing coins.  very interesting g story and good interaction with characters.
0743201140|1.0|There is a code that you need and it can only be used once, therefore this book is completely useless after the first 3 chapters.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love this game!!!!!My sister and I sit just and play this. there is so many opsticles to go through! this a must have app!!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I usually don't like games that require tilting the phone but since this game is so much fun I don't mind it at all.  I like the powerup rewards and it has made me keep playing to try to unlock them all!  I don't know if it's just me getting older but I have trouble keeping up once it starts getting fast!  :-)<br /><br />Great game.
B0091REZMW|4.0|wish more stuff to find at one time.  but good time killer. over all I like the game. I would download again.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Flow free was recommended by a friend.  it is a fun game and it takes skill to win each window.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|I especially loved the deep-frying turkey white noise. The ability to add more sounds was a great feature. Good job
B0097NGUJG|4.0|Heard this artist on All Songs Considered.  Loved the new sound from the group, and recommend looking at their videos on YouTube.  They are great compliments to darkish, Radiohead-like, smooth melodies with a twist.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book is by far the best written young romance novel I've read. The storyline is so thought out with unseen twists throughout. The writing is fantastic and each character is unique and well developed. I could not put this book down!!!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I love Angry  Birds Free and it plays so smoothly on the Kindle Fire HD.  Highly recommend it.  I  have only had my Kindle Fire for 2 days now but happy with the games performance.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Series three of Downton Abbey is just as good, if not better, than the others and I have recommended it to all of my friends. You will fall in love with all of these characters intermittently. It is a wonderful joyride.
B004OO4UFY|4.0|Picked this up on sale at Amazon based on samples.  Love it!  Some songs sound like James Brown, some like Soundgarden.  A mix of funk-rock that is a Friday afternoon fix.  I have and will continue to purchase their music in the future.<br /><br />Thanks Amazon, keep up the sales!
B00AJRQLTI|5.0|I bought this for my 14 year old son who was enthralled by the music in this production.  It has rapidly become his most listened to set of tracks.  Guess who manages his iPod?  This brings unexpected range to his listening, which is most welcome.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|This is a great show , watch season one on netflix . Have been addicted since that time . Purchase season two ,with no regrets . Would recommend
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This is a great sequal to the first temple run. More adventure and more upgrades! I've only had it for two days and I'm hooked!
B0073LWEXK|5.0|Really loved this Myst-like adventure.  Great graphics and challenging puzzles.  The best of smart phone Myst-like games I've played so far.
071815780X|5.0|Easy peasy as Jamie says on his show.... great book for trying foods that might be new.  Simple ideas in a different quick and healthy way.<br /><br />I wasn't so interested in the healthy bit, more the time, but this works both ways.  If you can have a look at the shows it will help too.<br /><br />Enjoy, eat well.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love this game it is the best game I have played in a long time so so so cool
B00AZRBLHO|5.0|The short version: The Phoenix Project is to IT what the best of the Harvard Business Review cases are to business. It's fictionalized, it's realistic, and it provides the best set of lessons on running a complex IT operations environment that I have seen anywhere. This should be required reading for senior level IT leadership everywhere.<br /><br />The book itself is very accessible (you do NOT need a deep technical background to appreciate the lessons!), the characters have depth, and the story is coherent and flows well. Most readers will see pieces of themselves in the characters' roles, personalities, and challenges.<br /><br />The tools and techniques discussed do require some real leadership and willingness to be an agent of change, but they do not require expensive or complex tools, long ramp-ups, or enterprise software. All you need for a Kanban board is a wall and a pack of post-it notes, good change management is really about process, and brainstorming and bottleneck analysis really just need everybody in a room, talking around a whiteboard.<br /><br />Again, if you're in any sort of leadership role (or would like to be in one) in an IT organization, just read it! If not, read it anyway, it's still a good story.
B009YU9J0E|2.0|This album kept coming up in my recommendations.  It was on sale and I thought I'd try it, but I didn't like it at all.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|This is a really great game and not hard to learn helps to pass time by if you are board. Graphic and sound is good and it is a very challenging game. I gave it 5 stars.
B001EC0OMM|4.0|I enjoyed the movie much better than the play.  Great acting from Jimmy stuart, Cary Grant and of course Kathryn Hepburn.  The young Dinah was also terrific.  You can't beat the old black and white films.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is entirely way too addicting. So many &quot;maps&quot; for being a free version. Such a great way to get your brain going!
B000ZM7VVO|5.0|I love Flogging Molly! They haven't put out an album that I haven't liked. I'm excited to finally see them in concert in February!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|it actually feelsnlike your on a farm and you have a responsibility<br /><br />jut tu th thu thh bicycle yfy ghfyj. yfyfjy fhyjhyncnb yjfj uknfnjy
B0063GORYU|5.0|I have always played this on my computor and now I can have it on my kindle fire HD in the car or elsewhere.  At night if I can't sleep, I'll get up and play some spider solitare.<br /><br />Really enjoy it!!!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|It is a book that I could not put down.  I read it in less than two days.  It is that awesome.  I really recommend it.  It will leave you wanting more.
B00973902K|5.0|This song is very catchy. You can't hear it once without it getting stuck in your head. One of my guilty pleasures for sure.
034580404X|5.0|I could not put this series down it was a great read and very well written enjoyed them emensly can't wait for her next book to come out
B0063IH60K|4.0|This is fun game but I like to play it with the real cards.  It's okay for on the road.
B001RT89UG|5.0|Have the original recording on CD and recently found out about this one, just had to get it! The extra songs just make it that much more enjoyable!! Highly recommended!!
B007R21JJK|4.0|I had a huge issue with an Asrock motherboard. 2 graphics card were fried before I realized it was the motherboard. Replaced it with this board. Great choice. There is one huge issue though... even though there are 4 case fan connectors, only one of them allows for voltage control (3 pin fans). The rest are PWM only (4 pin fans). 3 pin will still work but speed cannot be controlled. Quite ridiculous on a mid-range board.
B00B49L7JY|5.0|The story of Sixto Rodriguez is intriguing. Almost unbelievable. I would love to see a full concert on video. Does anyone know where to find one? Love his music!  This documentary is a real tear jerker with such a happy ending.  It's nice to know there are people like Rodriquez in this world.  My husband and I are going to watch the video again, just because it is so touching.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this video!
B004SGWYW4|5.0|I love Highschool of the Dead it's like one of the best series out there, like whats not to love, it's anime, Has zombies and a badass intro I love it!!! :D
B00866JL96|5.0|This is a great movie for a great price. I would not have any problems with even thinking about buying it again!
B009X01ELC|5.0|I love this case.  It is very durable.  Great quiality  Easy to snap Kindle into.  I bought the gray case.  Looks very stylish.
B00AYB20KI|4.0|It is an interesting suspense thriller, not spooky enough though. I would recommend watching it, time well spent. I give 4 *
B008476HBM|5.0|I'm like the details. The word neighborhood was spelled wrong. I'm liked the end.of the story where she said they deserved
B005OCFGTO|5.0|Should have ordered them Blu Ray -- but what a time rewatching the whole series.  No problems discovered.  Would recommend to Harry Potter lovers.
B00APUQT7I|4.0|This wasn't my favorite of all th Ice Age movies, but it was still very funny and definitely worth watching. My 2 year-old and 4 year-old thoroughly enjoyed it.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|Highly recommend this app got anyone wanting a white noise app. I've used others, but this us by far the best!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I am a temple run lover I love the first one and the second one I can't wait until they come out with a third one
B006MMX1GU|5.0|Fantastic album from Eric. He really came together in the late 60's. And this album proves it. Excellent.<br />As with all the albums done by Eric in this period.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|this is a pretty cool game for how realistic it is.  lots of things to do and make money.  a few tech glitches but pretty good
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|If you were born in the 60s, remember the 80s fondly, and have a single geeky bone in your body, this may be one of your favorite all time books. Get it, read it. Ready Player One.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|A very addictive game. All the new features make the game even better than the first!!  I recommend this game
B001O6W9QC|5.0|There is nothing funnier in the world than actors making fun of themselves. Tom Cruise's character alone is worth the view.
B001P7HUF0|4.0|Matt Damon and Danny De Vitto are really good together.  The film is not as hard edged as other Grisham movies, which suited our viewing needs.  An enjoyable movie.  Seeing Matt Damon and Claire Danes when they are younger before they became big stars shows their early talent.  Recommend viewing this movie.
B005LAII8K|3.0|Duh. Ending made no sense. None of that stuff would have happened with the actual ending. Blowing his hand off would have bought some time. Other than that the movie was good. Besides the really huge loose end. I thought maybe they would let love win and raise the boy in a loving 2 parent family but whatever. Raise him good. Problem solved. Also I kept waiting for Levitt to revert to his real face in the movie. But they kept it that way the whole time. Did he get a facelift? WHY?!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love this game,my little five year old brother and I play this awesome game all the time. We just can't get enough of this game. Don't get me wrong the original temple run its fun too, but I like this one better. In my opinion.
B000I62JAK|4.0|Ben Stiller is at his best here. I was skeptical at first, but I really enjoyed this!  I'd definitely watch it again.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Temple run was good but this is better with water falls ziplines and so much more I'm surprised this is free. Best temple run ever.
B007G8MMP0|4.0|This review is for the blu-ray transfer only and not the film itself.  This edition features a digitally restored version of the film, which is crisp in its detail, both in outdoor and indoor shots.  Night shots are also excellent.  The colors are a bit muted, however.  The film appears to have been shot in largely overcast conditions, so the skin tones are not alway warm, but rather somewhat washed out.  One exception to this is the color red, which really pops on the screen.  I am not sure if they did this for effect or what, but it is noticeable in many scenes.  The sound was excellent.  If you are considering an upgrade from DVD, it is worth it.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|This is precise infornation  and I like how you can choose hourly, daily, weekly reports. Also fun to check the weather in places that you will soon be traveling to.
B004HD61KE|4.0|I really enjoy books with and about places I have been. I too am a Catholic but have spent a lot of time with Norman friends and have done a fair amount of reading about them.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|I read this book on a whim. I didn't expect to like it as much as I did. Particularly,the including of  past characters. It almost makes time travel seem...plausible. It would be worth a read to any fans out there that may have had reservations on this novel.
B000IOM0WY|3.0|This is one of those heist films like Ocean's Eleven that has you rooting for the burglars who steal from the really bad guy.  While you do not approve of their actions, it is nevertheless satisfying to watch the bad guy get his comeuppance.  It is also fun to watch stunt drivers speeding around Los Angeles in Mini Coopers.<br /><br />The movie features solid performances from all of the principle players.  Characterization is good--each one stands out.  Good humor.  Fast pace.  It is a nice remake of the 1969 original, paying tribute to its predecessor without duplicating it outright.<br /><br />The blu-ray transfer was okay but not great.  Outdoor daytime scenes had remarkable detail and little film grain.  The same cannot be said for indoor or nighttime shots, however, which demonstrated considerable film grain.  The colors were muted just a bit overall, and the sound was not strong--I had to crank up the volume a few notches, which helped.  Not the worst blu-ray I have ever seen, but not the best either.<br /><br />Parental Advisory: The movie is rated PG-13 for language and some violence.  There are a couple of scenes featuring women who could have used more covering, but this was relatively tame by Hollywood standards.<br /><br />This is an entertaining heist film that is worth watching.  Just don't think too hard about the plot.  If you are considering an upgrade from DVD, it is a judgment call.  I would only upgrade if you are a serious fan of this movie and want the best possible edition.  Otherwise, you are probably fine with your DVD.

B000JMKTLO|4.0|This was a very intriguing book with a lot of different character plots.  Very impressive writing style.  Perfect for a book club group.
B0001I562I|5.0|I first saw Flight of the Navigator(1986) in 1988. The kids in the classroom cheered at the dogs catching frisbees and Alan Silvestri's intergalactic, energetic, synthesizer driven music score. This is a Norwegian production bought up by Walt Disney Pictures and it was directed by Randal Kleiser(Grease). In the 1980's, there was a mix of movies about aliens from outer space. The aliens in The Thing(1982) were hostile while E.T. in E.T. The Extra Terrestrial(1982) was benign. Flight of the Navigator flopped in 1986, but it found success on VCR's and TV. Joey Cramer played David Freeman, a boy living in Florida in 1978. He's kidnapped by aliens and dumped back on Earth in 1986. David is held captive in a NASA base and a UFO tries to help him get back home. Paul Reubens provided the voice of the robot \\"Max\\" under the name \\"Paul Mall\\". The first hour of Flight of the Navigator is a moody science fiction drama. The second hour turns into a funny, action packed family film. The film was packed with state of the art visual effects and early CGI. A young Sarah Jessica Parker plays an intern that befriends David.<br />David's brother is bratty in 1978 and sensitive and caring in 1986. This film isn't perfect. There's a romantic subplot with David and a girl in 1978 that goes nowhere. This film was a hit on VHS and TV; Walt Disney Pictures was unable or unwilling to produce a sequel. There are rumors about a remake in the works. Flight of the Navigator is an underrated classic from the 1980's.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|great game with beautiful graphics. love the story and strategy. will play this game over and over. something new in every scene.
B002QS1O36|5.0|Great movie if you enjoyed the stage play.  Some minor differences but the music is still great and the cinematography is beautiful.
0446580848|1.0|I've been a big fan for years, and I've read all DeMille's books.  However, this book leaves a lot to be desired.  Its slow, and Corey comes off as a bore.
B000002INJ|5.0|This is an old (1980's) album that I purchased so I could finally listen to it on my CD player in my truck.  Been a fan of this band for many, many years.  Into Glory Ride!
B00ATPVA78|5.0|superb game! love the graphics and story! i will continue to play this game over and over again. something new in every scene that i missed before.
1451695195|5.0|The story itself is great. You might think when you are reading it that there is extraneous information in it, but I found that it was tightly written. The whole story wraps up very nicely and it is one of those &#34;real-life&#34; events. I was very pleased with how easy it was to read and engaging the story was and it has affected my life for the better. I highly recommend that people read this book, especially if they are trying to figure out how God and science can co-exist (or actually be part of the same universe). I really appreciate the fact that the book is written as an interesting story as well as conveying a life-altering event.
1451695195|4.0|Eben Alexander hasn't produced a literary memoir. He is no writer. But you have to admire the gentleman for forging ahead with telling his remarkable story, because he believes in putting it out there to help his readers. Alexander is a neurosurgeon who basically collapsed one day in 2008, and ended up in a deep coma in the ICU for one week, with a terrible case of meningitis. He wasn't expected to regain consciousness. He did, and he emerges from his stupor with a vivid and detailed recollection of the beyond, one that contradicts his medical and scientific understanding.<br /><br />It's not giving too much away to say that Alexander comes out of his coma believing in God, but he doesn't \\"come around\\" to the teachings of a particular religion.<br /><br />In my favorite scene from the book, right after coming out of the coma, Alexander attends church with his family. He's open that he's never really believed in God, but shows up at the family's Episcopal church to keep his wife and kids happy. It's Christmas time. During the service, the minister calls Alexander to the front of the room, to \\"light the Advent candle.\\" Still weak from his illness, and barely able to walk, he gets up during the service and goes to light this candle on the side of a wreath. With real gratitude.<br /><br />This is a metaphor for our age. Weak and ragged, we use whatever tradition is at hand, to offer our thanks.<br /><br />I recommend this book.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|The graphics are awesome on this game and the kids love to play...just started playing but I think I'm going to have to buy them a new horse!!!
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Incredible story and very timely as it ties right into the real world.  Very well written with clarity and excitment on every page!
B00A77II0U|5.0|The only two problems with this game: it completely sucked a day from my life, and it ended too soon.
B0099Y2MYK|1.0|I wish I could give his most recent season 4 zero stars. Don't get me wrong. I loved Mr. Fellowes' clever and elegant view of his fun soap opera .. its words, its plot,mostly its brilliant actors (both genders) and its delightful contrasting views of Upstairs, Downstairs. That said, I suggest one sees the most recent season's last episodes for free on PBS before plunking down ones dollars. I always buy films for repeat viewing or sharing and this time, once was more than enough.<br />**Watching the final episodes wss like watching a formerly loving father devour his young. . . while saving his most vicious Hannibal Hector destruction of his most sympathetic character for the last moments.**<br /><br />So much for Mr.Fellowes brag in a personal interview in which he whined how his conservative Tory views damaged his forner acting career. In the same interview,he said, \\"I know how to take care of those little Socialist actors in my cast\\" and proved himself correct in this season's last mean scenes.<br />He also reveals in personal interviews (all online,BTW) his own bitterness over the struggle his court-found wife had getting a title or something equally earth shaking. Can this also have influenced his quite different interpreation of the Upstairs this time around. Or was he just bored with it all? In either case, he forgot the rule of writing. Remember your reader. Or,in this case, your product's loyal fans.<br />His demoliton of his own work left a decidedly bitter taste in this heart. Foolish little man.<br />[[ASIN:B009ZQI41C Downton Abbey Season 3 Preview [HD]]]
B003L7DK74|5.0|This came very quickly in the mail. Actually, before expected. We were very pleased. I have a warped sense of humor and this fit me to a tee.<br /> I had watched it while visiting my son in college and thought it was hysterical.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|The book was definitely gripping and took a turn for the worst but at the same time still had the best.
B000XKZQ74|4.0|The movie setting/plot: East Germans being stalked/harrassed by their country's security police--the stasi--before Berlin Wall falls--circa 70s/80s. Kinda gives you a Hollywood-esque glimpse behind the iron curtain back in those days. A guy and his girlfriend are the focus. They are caught up in the corrupt socialist regime. High ranking stasi wants to sleep with his girlfriend. She refuses. The officer then rats on her using her secrets against her to turn her in and she is used a pawn to flush out some pro-democracy/capitalists. The movie shows in a light way (avoiding the dark side of the beatings, killings, harsh imprisonments, etc) of how the stasi worked in the socialist regime. It even brings out some of their psychological tactics for the audience. How they break people. And it shows how people's every day lives are effected. How socialism is not a good thing. Something young Americans of today should know . . . be reminded of. The bigger plot is about how even the stasi are humans. . . how lonely doesn't just inspire spiteful mean behavior but can inspire people to behave in good ways . . . if the right person. The ending is touching. And the movie's surprises are not used to leave you hanging . . . everything is brought full circle.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This was a great book.  Once I started reading it, I had to finish it, which is unusual for me.  Can't wait for the movie in February!  The book was suspenseful and romantic.
B0019N8P2W|5.0|This show brings back a lot of fond memories and I look forward to sharing both the show and the memories with my daughter when she gets older.
B00ATSBIIG|5.0|This a very good game and even relaxing. I have the PC version of this and l have to say I like this one better. I love the music, this is one of the few games that I leave the sound. If the the two dollars isn't to expensive for an app, it's well worth it.
B0012HRJEA|1.0|Disliked:<br />Tybalt pointing gun in the face of a child<br />Obscene gestures<br />Glamorized gun violence<br />Romeo taking drug Mercutio offered him<br />Juliet shooting herself in the head<br />Glamorized teen suicide
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Great game a little difficult then the first. Recommend it to everyone to enjoy. Easy to play and challenging for all ages.
B004FHP9KA|5.0|Another great movie by Nolan. If you liked momento, this would be a great one for you.  Make sure you clear your schedule, 2:30 hours....
B007SSDS24|4.0|The Darkest Hour is a movie which came and went without fanfare or much notice. I avoided renting it for some time. Finally, a fit or boredom drove me to do so. I am glad I did. It is as movies should be--very entertainig. The budget must have been low which only proves that even with minimal budget a good and entertaining movie can still be made. Disclaimer: I never review movies and I always try to keep what I say at the level of I liked or disliked it. Renting this movie will not be a waste of time if you admire that actors can bring alive an almost totally CGI rendered world destroyed by an alien invasion. Thus, what I am saying is this: enjoy the craft of actors as they bring to life a completely imaginary world very convincingly. It is an action movie with little time wasted on exploring human reaction to a destroyed world. In my opinion the human reaction part of post apocalyptic movies rarely stikes true because who really knows what post apocalyptic human reaction would be. I especially object to post apocalyptic movies which paint mankind in stark black and white--good versus evil--contrast. What people might do to survive is the only element which rings true anything else is questionable. Bottomline: I liked this movie, finding it entertaining. The movie's only agenda was to be entertaining.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Pretty fun game to play. My kid loves watching me play it. Great graphics. Horse responds to touch, pretty neat feature.
B000IZ6FLK|1.0|Just. Plain. Awful. I want my 2 hours back plus interest and my 3 dollars. Not a lot of action. Pretty cheesy.
B008FYZIVY|1.0|Purchased on special sale prior to Christmas as gift.  Gave on New Year's Day.  Daughter found a disc cracked when began to watch late January.  Too late to replace.  A real bummer!!!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This is amazing as compared to other games on Amazon. The price (free) can't be beat either. It is very nicely laid out with plenty of graphics also.
B00AMBM9MO|1.0|This movie had some minimal laughs in it nothing special tho. I gave it 1 star because I paid $5 to watch it. If it came on Encore or Netlifx or something and I didn't have to shell out additional money to view it would have bumped it up to 2-3 stars. not worth renting in my opinion.
B005DOL0R0|5.0|Bought this for my husband to use with his Kindle Fire.  Nothing fancy but does a good job of protecting the Fire.  Great value.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|This book is dark and mystical . I cryed and felt scared at times.<br />I also couldn't put this book down.. Holder is a sweet and carrying young man.
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|Somebody can tell me if the dvd is coming with spanish subtitles?? My mom loves this serie in spanish!<br />Thanks!
1449417051|4.0|this was much enjoyed by the recipients as well as myself and other guests. works well for the cat lover.
B006M4RN3U|5.0|I love this CD. The band are amazing singers. My favorite songs are Some Nights and We are Young. I would reccomend this CD.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|I would recomend this book for anyone interested in Lincoln and American history. Very detailed and it moved along with ease.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|This game is great if you like temple run 1 you should try temple run 2 with new opstical and diffrent things you can buy and the saves now are great.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|this is one of those stories you get drawn into and find yourself thinking about randomly during the day or even showing up in your dreams. intruiging and well-written.
B00A50PE6K|5.0|I love Glee. I would reccomend this CD. Any fan of Glee would like this CD. They are all really good singers.

B00A9C3RB8|4.0|This movie takes a funny and heart-warming look at marriages after a &#34;few&#34; years. A must-see for any couple - young or old.
B004G5ZY7E|4.0|Good escapism. Will probably read more of these. (12 more words required. 8 more words required. 4 more words required.)
0307593312|5.0|It is Haruki Murakami at his best...but when is it not his best. It is another mystical roller coaster ride.
B004IM14RY|1.0|I have seen bad movies before, but I can almost always find a redeeming feature that justifies my time spent watching it. This movie has none. It is the worst movie ever. The ENTIRE movie is from within a box. NO SHOT exists outside the box. Please don't waste your time by watching this. I just lost 1.5 hours of my life.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I love it. It is simple and easy to use. You can chat and post messages and photos. You cant play facebook games though. All in all, this app is a fantastic one. If you have a facebook, get it.
B0069G5Z9K|3.0|We received this game for free on our Kindle HD and my 10-year old son has love it.  He said he would recommend it to his friends and has shared it when they were visiting.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|I really like this app. It does exactly what it says it will and has variety of sounds for you to select from. Include the various alarm settings, and it is a very useful app.
B00A9X9ORI|4.0|Not a bad movie, but very slow at times...Wish it had more special effects like other Bruce Willis' movies. Any takers?
B000VHXBIU|4.0|The pace is just a little on the slow side, and there are so many plot lines going, it's difficult to catch everything on a single showing. That being said, this movie is hilarious. Kevin Kline's performance is laugh-out-loud hysterical, and naturally the two Pythons help tremendously on the comedy front. I just watched this for the first time in several years and had forgotten how  side-splitting funny this is!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Glad to find a horse app with great graphic for my Fire. Fun to play and the stablehand is HOT!  Have had little issue with opening app after the day after download. Working now though.
B00B2V66VS|2.0|good graphics, better experience, and better perm's are the needs in this app.  giant monkey, not so much.  I guess the developers could have put in more time
B00B2V66VS|4.0|My kids never were interested in my Kindle Fire until I downloaded THIS game. I'm not sure who uses it more now, my kids or me!! Very addictive gameplay. A good way to pass the time while waiting at the doctors office.
B0094KF4WG|5.0|The onlyguy who was there who hs told the tale. Dont believe the hype, the politicians or the media. Read it from the guy who was there. A no bulls***, well told factual account. From a guy who doesnt blow his own trumpet.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Geat game i love it. Challenging and keeps on going and i love you can earn gems in the game not have to buy them.And also the keep going option is great.
0446573027|1.0|It's my own fault for not reading, or not wanting to believe, the reviews about the book being a rip-off of Lee Child's \\"Reacher\\" series.  Having read and enjoyed 95% of Baldacci's work, I wanted to like this book - but I hated it, felt ripped-off for spending money on it and lost a lot of respect for Baldacci.  Of course there's plenty of room for more ARMY CID type characters - but when the best you can come up with is John (Jack) Puller (Reacher) ...and with the same physical attributes too.  Are you serious?  Don't waste your money if you're a \\"Reacher\\" fan.  If you don't know \\"Reacher\\", you might like this book - but know that it's a fraud.
B002VX3RCW|5.0|Again, Lamaze and their wonderful toys for babies. Very colorful, lots of different visual spots to reach for and nice, easy on the ears sounds.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|The first season of American Horror Story was spectacular, but this season tops it by far with it's creative and original plot. Although many episodes were graphic this season is still a must see!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|its a good game, a good sequel and its fun. I would enjoy another one coming up just maybe a new genre.

B007XKEY6Q|3.0|At first when I got the game it was fun. now all of a sudden when I log in,  my password isn't right. and I have a kindle. so im somewhat liking-disliking the game :/
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I am eleven and I loved this book!!! I could not put the book down I read it in 3 days. I can't wait to read the other books. I want to watch the movie but it seems scary. I might watch it though. I could definitely put myself in the book. I can't wait to read the other books!!!
B0045HCJRG|5.0|This movie show once more why we love watching Christopher Walken.  Silly premise, but wonderful movie - Sissy Spacek is great as mom
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I loved this game on the computer and when I seen this app I was so excited. It is a game that racks your brain.
B007B6T3K4|5.0|One of the best symphonic metal albums of this era. Angelic voice, mystical instruments, pretty damn heavy. A must buy for people who loved the old Nightwish and similar songs.<br />Transaction on amazon was simple and easy. I could download the mp3 s for offline listening in subways. Even cloud player works on my phone.<br /><br />Update: After weeks of listening to it and many other symphonic metal bands, i still find there is simply nothing like this album in recent times. I often find myself getting bored with other albums in between, and my immediate reaction is play a random song from this album. Any random song from this album is enough to bring my mood back. Its extremely refreshing to listen to these songs after so many similar sounding bands start boring you. The combination of fast and beautiful guitar riffs, powerful operatic vocals and pure and heavy melodious instrumentation. This album is the definition of Symphonic metal!!!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is wonderful! I can read the Bible easier on this than the actual hard copy.  It was good to choose the translation I wanted.  The reading plan helps me keep up with my daily reading.
B009IQ0TGM|5.0|I hadn't heard of Ellie before.  So as her reviews started to build, I went back to this release and I truly listened.  Taken hook line and sinker.  She is one of the new line of singers putting together really great stuff.  As the title states:  Powerful, really powerful.
0765342294|5.0|It is required for a gen ed courses in college. I have not read it yet so I am not sure what the out come is going to be of the book.
1616960922|5.0|A great short story about a forgemaster whose work is reviled but when the empire is threatened she is called in and tasked. Add to that condescending enemies who are trying to both use and eliminate her. Treat yourself to this book. it is short and sweet.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I enjoy this game.  It has an easy visual layout.  It entertains me and keeps my mind occupied.  It challenges me.
B004SIIBGU|4.0|It could use a little more of what is on the mobile and/or main site. More options, more functions, etc... But otherwise it's good and I use it a lot!
B008XG1X18|5.0|I am addicted to pinterest. I don't believe there is a day that goes buy that I am not on it. There is so much neat stuff to find and see and the site.
B003VANOFY|4.0|I am blown away with the performance of this headset. Outstanding sound quality (I am a sound engineer, and without spending crazy money on reference 'phones, this is really quite good sound). The surround sound works wonderfully, Super easy to set up, especially if you already use other Logitech gaming products. My gaming partners say that the mic is excellent, and the noise reduction works quite well. The programming features and voice alterations are outstanding, flexible, and quite useful. The battery last plenty long between charges. The spool for the cables is a great feature for convenience. When I want the headset, I just plug the fob into the USB port on the spool base, and when I want the home theater system, I just yank the USB fob. Easy.<br /><br />The only thing I dislike is how bulky they are to store. At least the ear covers pivot so they lay flat.
B008476HBM|5.0|Jane Austen is the queen of female writers. Her prose is timeless. Her heroine is feisty,gutsey,witty, and unwilling to compromise. Her hero is often misunderstood. Her outcome is delightful.<br />She has not been surpassed in 200 years.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|great graphics and good game to keep you busy.  I am sure kids would love this game just as adults would.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I thought this was handy so I could check the weather on the kindle when I was not near a computer.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I like the game. I think that it is a very good game if you like to take care of something.
B003TSEEDY|3.0|I liked this book but wasn't sad when it was over. It's a very easy read. I was just expecting a little more.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Even though I need no convincing for myself of the existence of heaven I enjoyed reading this book from the experience of the medical professional. We are so dependent on the empirical method that reading of the mystical experience of a well trained medical doctor was refreshing. It all adds to my own dialogue!
B00AYDC5HY|5.0|Really a sweet tale of love for a pet and doing whatever it takes to save him. You may cry
B0057LUI0O|4.0|My kid's love this movie and I don't mind to watch it myself. All the colors and action keep their attention - ages 7, 5, and 3.
B0063IH60K|4.0|This is a game I play that really calms me down.  It is challenging as well, It will let you make sure you pick right cards especially when you select the winning deal rather than the random deal.  I have won with both.  I really enjoy it.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|What a well written story and a fun read. There are several imaginative stories within the one novel and each worthy of discussion. Great story line.
1591396190|3.0|This book was for school, can't say that i hated it or loved it. it was a necessary purchase. Sorry
B001AQO3QA|5.0|THis is a bad ass box set... theatrical releases and directors cut... very happy with this box set!, and for the price, booyaw!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is a wonderful app.  i can carry it with me when I don't have my  regular Bible.  I have the app on my smartphone, but having it on my Kindle makes it more readable with the large type and all the extras.
1936608898|5.0|I've never been convinced by the 'they used to do it this way a long time ago' reasoning to try anything, much less a drastic change in diet.  However this book described the 'why' and 'how' behind the theory, which I can get on board with.  It went beyond what foods make you healthy, but delved into the psychology of food and how we can begin to change our habits and unhealthy food relationships.  Highly recommended reading!  I'm on 'Day 22' and feeling great!
B007KQ6XYY|3.0|WAY less fun than the the first one! the first one isbbetter because its an original and this one is harder:( its not my favorite.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is very player friendly and easy to figure out. It has pretty good graphics and the horses look realistic. I enjoy this game very much.
B005Z271Y6|5.0|I loved how Adele gives a little background to her songs before singing them.  She is a straight from the heart artist and that is what I love about her and her music.  It was wonderful to see her at The Royal Albert Hall because this was obviously a goal of hers and how beautiful to see her enjoy every minute of her performance.  Well worth the purchase!
1426209584|5.0|The photographs of these extraordinary birds are so lifelike that one can almost hear their calls and see the males in motion as they boogie to catch the attention of the females.  I did have a problem with the text, this is just my eye sight, because there was not enough contrast between the text and the background, especially where it was black on white.  However the quality of the photos more than made up for this slight problem which I will find a way to overcome.  This book is well worth the cost.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Temple Run 2 is awesome! I would recommend this game to everyone! It has different things than the 1st one like ziplines, rivers, and caves!!!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|great app but wont always load. I try to open it but it refuses to load. when it finally does it is a great app.
B00A77II0U|4.0|Not getting any more of these...all the same....silly stories...some good puzzles...not quite solveable without the walkthrough or hints. worth what I paid for it...
B0069G5Z9K|3.0|My 10 year old grandson liked this game but said he got bored after a short while. Whether it was his ADHD talking or really a boring game, I'm not sure!! Okay for a freebie!
B001B3MCQK|5.0|Such a great find. Great lyrics, vocals and music!<br />It's a shame this guy got lost in the shuffle and is only just now being recognized!
B00A757EFW|5.0|People complaining about this app. are..........well I won't say. It works well on my ZTO tablet. I purchased the full version and it is great. You have the option of a virtual joystick or screen tapping for movement.
B0097GVJWQ|4.0|same as same as same as....good graphics, some good puzzles. silly story, not quite connected and not quite solveable. good for free or .99
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is addicting it's harder than regular temple run though but it makes it more fun you can move up levels and you can hang glide too!!!!!! Buy this app or you'll regret it
B001ZG4J00|5.0|Such a great find. Great lyrics, vocals and music!<br />It's a shame this guy got lost in the shuffle and is only just now being recognized!
B009K0OL06|5.0|One of the best TV shows I've watched in a long time. After 5 minutes of season 1 I was hooked.
B0055SWM08|4.0|Interesting and sometimes challenging puzzles. Good way to pass the time as a passenger on a trip! Like this game
B002Y0TGOU|4.0|Jim Kirk (Chris Pine) and young Mr. Spock (Zachery Quinto) are a bit too combative in different parts of the film. Mr. Spock should have had his emotions in check, up to the death of his mother, then all bets are off. In his words, within the film, \\" I\\"be been emotionally compromised over His mother's death \\". At this point, James Tiberius Kirk takes over command of the newest Starship in the fleet : N.C.C.- 1701, the U.S.S. Enterprise, to protect the ship and the ultimate fate of Earth. A good first effort by Director J.J. Abrams in the \\" Star Trek Universe \\". Excellent acting from the cast, especially Karl Urban as Dr. Leonard McCoy (Bones) and Simon Peggy as Montgomery Scott.<br />Watching the flim from Amazon Instant Video was very entertaining! The Video Transfer was alittle \\" soft \\" , it could have been a sharper image, in HD mode. The sound was absolutely flawless!!
B007IXWKUK|3.0|Kept on thinking there would be more of a story there,but there's not., oh well.  I'll see if there's more of a story in the 3rd book.  Now that I've read the first two, may as well continue. ..........
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game!! At first I was a little confused but it made sense 5 min later. Anyway, I highly recommend this game for horse lovers!
B007BFSYMS|4.0|I got this app for free and would recommend it to anyone wanting to try white noise for sleep. It really worked and I was able to sleep a whole four hours. You may think that is not long, but I usually only sleep 1-2 hours.<br />The one thing I thought strange was that when you use the link to go to download more sounds, it tells you that if you import it will overwrite any other sounds including what you already had.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It is an awesome way to help you understand a little bit about the horses. I've only played this app for a couple days but its still awesome.
B001KDQ4KQ|3.0|A bit depressing. Well written. Keeps you wondering where the author is going with this story.  Character relationships are well developed .
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I like having this game it is easy to play I love it  I have been playing it since I got it
B009VSW15Y|5.0|I haven't used the camera too many times yet, but each pic I've taken has come out very clear. It's very user friendly, too.
B009X01FJS|5.0|I love this because my tablet is protected.  The cover if functional with its stand, and the color is the bomb!!! : )
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|What a great game. Awesome graphics and kept me occupied. I am going to get more of your games soon,can you make a hungry tiger game?
B004FP1WX0|5.0|Had me hanging on the edge of my seat.  I could not stop watching.  Like a train wreck you can't look away.  Truly disturbing example of a human being.
B00008J2PG|5.0|This is a true story from Nazi-run Rome during Second World War. It shows the courage and convictions of the Underground, and what they were up against.
B0085LMFAE|5.0|If you lived back then and had the good fortune to purchase this album in 86/87, then you probably remember letting it play over and over because the tape deck worked best that way. Thanks Paul
B000069HK2|5.0|Recomiendo  mucho  este  disco  lo estoy  utilizando y me  parece  de  una  nitidez  extraordinaria ymi  hijo  lo e scucha  cada  dia, buenisimo
1575666286|5.0|If you haven't read this and you are a health practioner or just someone interested about living a more healthy lifestyle then you should read this.  It has cured so many different diseases and it just once again proves how much nutrition and our diet really shape the way our health will go.  Great read, great recipies, good overall buy!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|My grandson really enjoyed this game! He was getting a little &#34;itchy&#34;, and I turned on my Kindle, and he started playing, and was quiet until we were finished. Great game!
B009GEOLM4|5.0|Highly Recommended If you love Batman story must watch this series can't wait till the next one come out. A+
B00A8ECU24|5.0|this game is awesome its ponies duh I play this game on facebook too lol I love ponies ponies are awesome yo and unicorns are even better
1451695195|5.0|Very convincing report, even for an unbeliever like me.  Well organized and orderly said.  Looking forward to a follow up regarding the effect of his experience in his day-to-day life.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Facebook finally took the time to create a Kindle Fire compatible app that's an actual app instead of the awful web portal that comes preinstalled on the Kindle Fire.  My biggest complaint is that I can't delete the default app so this one sits right next to it and I routinely tap on the wrong one.  UGH!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book was just like my life. exactly. ! !! z sjd djc sb s s d d x x awesome in awsomeish language
B00B2V66VS|5.0|The screen tilts, (as you go around turns) you get to revive yourself however many times, and a bunch of other cool stuff! play it to find out!
B008HK3XKO|5.0|Fit the kindle fire hd perfectly. The black was good. You could charge it with the cover on. the strap made it handy so it stayed closed
B00881PPTO|4.0|I picked this app up for free when it was the Deal of the Day and have used it several times to look into ticket prices.  It's a nice, solid app but I couldn't see paying for it when there's a free, lite version as well as the original website.
B00005U122|5.0|I have always liked Roger Waters. This is a great DVD Concert. This concert has excellent video and sound quality and would recommend!
B00003CXA2|5.0|A wonderful story for all ages! I was happy to find a new copy to replace one I lent out and didn't get back.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Can't believe a show is being aired that is high quality and not highly sexualized.  I could easily allow my 14 yr old to watch it with me.  I hope that the success of this show will send a message that old fashioned values are still popular.
B006LSZECO|3.0|It took me a while to get into this book, but once I did, I was HOOKED!  I loved it....until I got to the end, then I regretted the time I spent reading it.
B00001ODGR|5.0|This is an excellent DVD of Styx. This is the only Styx DVD concert I have and feel this is well worth the money. If you like Styx, you'll like this DVD. Good video and sound quality.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Excellent storyline and production, characters well drawn, historical perspective makes it believable, multiple  and intersecting character developement add to depth.
B000XUBFE2|4.0|I am partial to books and movies about Nazi Germany and the atrocities of The Holocaust. This is a novel with a focus on children  &#34;coming of age&#34; in Munich during the early 1940's. The protagonist, Liesel Meminger (aka &#34;The Book Thief&#34;), although not Jewish, is an &#34;outsider&#34; by Nazi standards, evoking Anne Frank's precocious sensibility. The book is &#34;meant&#34; for adolescent readers. Although I am well beyond my adolescent years, I found the story compelling. The narrator is &#34;Death/The Grim Reaper&#34;, and I alternated being fascinated by this perspective on some occasions, but finding it contrived at other times. This led me to eliminate one star from my rating. Nevertheless I am glad my 13 year-old son accidentally left the book in my bedroom. Now I'm trying to convince him to read it!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Love this series. I have never read any book two times until these. If you haven't read this series you would are missing out.
B00092ZMDY|5.0|I didn't hesitate to purchase this DVD. It is an excellent concert, both video and sound quality are great. I would highly recommend!
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|This is an all around AMAZING mouse. Not to say this is only for Gamers, it is definitely engineered with gaming in mind. It's comfort, look, and feel would also make for a great \\"Standard User\\" mouse.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />* DPI comparable to mice 4-5x the price<br />* Massive amounts of customization, no need for numerous keyboard hotkeys with this mouse<br />* 4 mode DPI/speed control<br />* Design: Pulsating Blue LED's, comfortable natural fit<br />* Tangle free cord<br />* Removable weights for comfort and control<br />* 9 programmable buttons<br />* Software is intuitive<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />* I would not change anything functionally about this, but I would allow for LED colors to be changed on entire mouse
B00AE2IJIE|4.0|Your kids might actually be scared by this movie. Besides that, it was a very entertaining movie. Definitely worth the rental price.
0752860313|4.0|the book makes you look at your artist abilities in a new and different light so will enjoy it more
B00A80SHFM|5.0|I bought this soundtrack CD on returning home from seeing this movie. It was the first time I had seen Les Miserables, stage or screen. Can't believe it took me so long to see it, but have a strong feeling I saw the best production ever.  I loved the fact that the singing was live, not lip synced, even though some parts were a little rough.  The caliber of singing was great from people I didn't know could sing.  It's now on my computer, phone and iPod.  The CD is in my car stereo, and played anytime I go somewhere.  I saw the movie two days after Christmas, and I'm still not tired of the music.
B0031RS2HC|5.0|From start to finish you are never sure where Child will take you. Great read a thrill a minute. Sensational.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Its so much fun, you get to see what its like to own a horse. you brush it and feed it and enter the horse in competitions. its a lot of fun. definitely should get it
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|I haven't gotten very far but it's a fun game so far. I love games that have me progress and have me think instead of run around.
B004I744AS|5.0|I honestly do not know how you could want any more than what this dictionary/encyclopedia offers and it's free.  Lots of extras (trivia, etc.) too.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love to play my horse because its a great game for girls and I think you should try it because it very fun.
B0091REZMW|3.0|Paying real world money for in-game diamonds, etc., is a buzz kill. I would have  rather paid for the game up front and been able to clear all locations and not be nickled and dimed to death. I will not be spending any real money to buy additional diamonds. The game looks and plays great.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|Love it!  My daughter and I play it all the time!!  It's like a Tiny Village but for kids! We love that its free also!
B005H0IW6W|4.0|Nice christmas songs collection, amazing female chorus and but of course Michael's powerful voice comes out and you add the orchestra and the mix is nice you must have these item
B008HK3XYK|5.0|Great product...but wish it had a holder for a stylus. Also wish it zippered shut rather than strap. To hard to open and close all the time.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|When first heard about temple run 2, I knew it was gonna be at least $2, then I saw it was free,and had to get it because of my love for the original game. The map is different and very fun, especially the part when you're in the cart on the train tracks. And the best part is......ITS FREE! It's my new favorite game. Very satisfied! :)
B005IQ39AY|3.0|I don't know about this game.  I do like it, however when you get to about level 17, this is where I have the problem.<br />The game does not seem to generate random colors for the balls.  It only will give you colors that you don't need and cause you to use all the balls you have and eventually fail.<br />I understand the concept of making the upper levels harder, however this game goes out of it's way to make you lose.<br /><br />If we could get the color generation random that would be great.  Make the initial setup of the balls hard and it will be more enjoyable.
B0095R64AO|3.0|I wasn't super impressed with this movie. It was predictable and drawn out. Towards the middle the movie started to lag and never really recovered. Glad I only rented it and didn't but it. Such a shame as it held so much potential.
B0084AZXKK|4.0|A great story that I've always known of, but never read. A must read for any pirate story fan and adventure lover.
1467934925|5.0|A must have and a must read for anyone interested in economics or finance. Very inexpensive to buy, and still relevant.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|One of the best series on television. Season one was a little slow. Season two picked up the pace and now season three... amazing! The actors on this series are awesome. They do an amazing job making their characters real. The writing is excellent. Make up is superb. These zombies scare me. I noticed more gore in this season. I liked how this season is showing more of the human response to the zombie apocalypse. Not everyone who survives is going to be good. Not every good survivor will stay good. Writing this into the show makes it more realistic. I could say more but do not want to give out any spoilers. Overall this is an excellent series that just keeps getting better.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|There were so many charactors, locations, and twist and turns I found it hard to keep up with.  Need to reread it now. I've read many of J.G.'s books, but this was not my favorite.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|so entertaining! This is the best app! It is so fun. I cannot stop playing it. This game could be for adults as well as children.
0679720200|5.0|Great book about society and absurdism. Very reasonably priced. A quick and worthwhile read that I enjoyed and reconsidered my values and how they relate to those of society's.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|I love this series. I was expecting it to pick up from season 1 like all series do. I was surprised with a different horror story. I LOVE that! Season 2 was just as awesome as season 1. The episodes are well written and twisted. You never know what is going to happen. The acting is superb. I love Jessica Lange. Her acting has always been of the highest caliber. I am enjoying her in this series and hope she will be in future seasons. The setting in the asylum was creepy. I haven't always liked the flashing between times in a movie/tv show but it worked flawlessly here. Excellent viewing! I recommend this series.
B00AE2J5HI|3.0|Not enough time spent developing characters so that the ending falls short of what was intended. Somewhat disappointing. Would not recommend to a friend
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love this game it's fun and it gets me entertained and this game is new so that's my opinion keep posting reviews so people know what you think.
B008I43DYU|3.0|No big deal but it doesn't have % key.<br />It comes with 3 faces but same functions.  all three faces don't have % key.
B0091X2FNM|1.0|I purchased this movie in error, so I've never watched it.  The movie was very expensive.  I would have never purched a movie that cost so much.  I wish I could've deleted it ant received a refund, but by the time i figured out I had purched it, it was too late to reverse it.
1468179993|5.0|I had the privilege of both reading Jeremey Donovan's wonderful book, as well as attending one of his public-speaking trainings. Jeremey is a force of nature. His deep, nuanced, careful understanding of public speaking in particular, and of superior, story-driven communication  in general, is like a rock thrown into a pond, rippling out and enriching so many areas of one's life. If you want to be a TedTalk star, there's no better starting point than Jeremey's book.<br /><br />If TedTalking is not your thing, the book still offers a wealth of insight. If you regularly go to professional meetings, talk to clients on the phone or in person, pitch new business, attend (often noisy) networking events where you have to tell a persuasive story fast to make new friends and progress your career, this book is a brilliant, thoughtful guide. The book's helpful 2-part structure---content and delivery---will quickly reveal the magic scaffolding underneath persuasive communications, and focused, successful self-promotion.<br /><br />Thousands of business books  come into the world. Some offer a thoughtful, sincere intention, and invaluable advice. Jeremey's book is one such text. Read it and instantly transform how you communicate.
B0076DELIG|4.0|I love Connelly's writing and enjoy all of these in the series. I think his writing continues to improve steadily even though I think he has been great from the beginning.
B00785P2QC|3.0|I hate how much social media is involved and that they make some things impossible to do without paying.but it is a good time killer and good for the kindle fire.
B0051UP5NQ|4.0|it's ok, I deleted after a few week of havig it, it has too much of a storage on my phone
0061148512|5.0|Beautiful use of metaphors, easy to get lost in this one. This was my first Plath, looking forward to reading more of her work.
B005LAII8A|5.0|excellent sci fi movie.  Joseph gordon levitt and bruce willis are great together, the action is first rate, and the suprise twists make the movie really fun
1451695195|1.0|Dr Alexander was in a coma for days and then emerged with the unshakeable conviction that he had journeyed to \\"heaven.\\" Although his reported experiences were no more complex nor impressive than common, ordinary dream content experienced by millions daily during normal sleep he presents it as \\"proof\\" that HIS experience was a special journey into a supernatural realm filled with images reflecting ages old religious content that we can safely assume had long been stored in his memory. Well, maybe (to be generous), but his interpretation falls far short of \\"proof.\\" Sadly, it is much more likely that the unfortunate doctor, despite his impressive scientific credentials, has suffered cerebrocortical brain damage that has impaired his ability to distinguish a line between what is real and what is purely subjective. It is well known that such damage can blur that line, allowing the strong tendency of humans to believe what they merely want to believe despite the lack of any objective evidence to take over.<br /><br />William West, M.D.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book is my favorite Nicholas Sparks book and may be even my favorite book I've ever read. It's not cheesy, sappy, and hopelessly romantic like some other romance novels. It contains suspense, tension, realism, a dark mood, yet has the spark of love Nicholas is known for.
B005IQZB14|3.0|I heard that Oprah really championed this author.  This is her personal story of a hike she took on the Pacific Coast Trail; a hike of some thousands of miles, pretty much solo.  She's trying to move on from her past troubles by being in nature, being alone, being brave, and becoming physically strong enduring the rigorous challenges she meets along the way.  I thought the writing was okay, but I didn't find this book all that exciting. For someone who wants to read intricate details of a several months' long hike -- this would be a good book for them.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|This app is exactly as advertised! It is easy to setup and use. I've been using it to fall asleep to rainstorms every night. Worth every penny!
B00007E7K0|5.0|this is the actual lens cap for the standard lens that comes with the T2i, T3i and T4i. Buy this one.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|It's. awesome I love the new updates like the silliness and the mining carts toy should get it and its free<br /><br />BUY IT!!!!!
B001QFZADA|4.0|Here is a practical approach to connect more easily with singles by determining whether they have a preference for being helped (acts of service), whether gifts appeal to them the most, whether touch is of primary importance,  or whether they respond more strongly to their other senses being stimulated.  I think the approach is credible, valid, and practical. I found the book helpful.
B0000696I1|4.0|Looked like someone or maybe somebody opened it or I just got the one that person who opened the box with a box cutter, not that big of a deal.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this app. It is the best app that I have ever played in my life. I love it.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|temple run 2 is so much fun! I love love loveee it. it creates hours of fun. u never kno what's going to happen!
B000PC0S5K|5.0|Eckhart Tolle has taken old truths and written them in a very fluid, easily understandible fashion.  No, we don't need to read the old sacred spiritual texts.  He describes why and how we add to our own suffering, and what we can do to lessen it.  Once you have gone through this, and you may wish to purchase the Power Of Now (his first blockbuster book),  your way of thinking, looking at the world, looking at yourself, and seeing what really matters most in life will be changed profoundly.  This is the perfect book for a book club, where the members are interested in spirituality, finding an easier/better/more compassionate & meaningful way to live. It's the kind of book where you read a few paragraphs and sit with what you just read. In the book club, it is wonderful to discuss those few paragraphs or a chapter, at a time.  People never tire of re-reading Eckhart's books.  I know people who are back to reading the Power of Now for the third time and A New Earth for the second.  I am one of them.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Received it perfectly. It was great and got within a timely matter. All copies were included and I was able to give the none Blu-Ray version to family.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Very good book.  Always a page turner.  I like the way the author writes and keeps you interested in her books.
B006L9B6TI|5.0|Somebody told me about the secret, I'm not much of a reader but bought it anyway..it was a really good book.. Then, one day I was searching thru amazon, and saw they had the Magic! This is the second book to the secret.. I'm a real sceptic, but this book is incredible! I have done things that the author of the magic has told me to try to see if it really works, and so far I have been blown away! I say to myself, this is amazing! The things that I have done according to the book, have really worked.. I'm still reading it, but wow, this book is great! It is so good because I'm just an average everyday person, and this book has changed my life for the better! If your a sceptic, then all I can say is read this book, do exactly what the author says to do, and you will start to see immediately the changes in your life! It's so good, it's scary! A definite buy!!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|The App Is Awesome.It Really Comes Your Mind And Relaxes You. I Love It And It Has A Lot Of ''Fabulousity'' And Yeah
B004SH40BQ|5.0|La entrega fue a tiempo, la comunicación fue inmediata y atenta, el producto es tal cual como se esperaba, 100% recomendado.
B000VOC90Y|5.0|I bought this because my laptop won't fit in many other bags.<br />Not only my laptop fits this bag, I can carry more things and I can barely feel the weight!<br />One downside about this bag I find is that the my water bottle won't fit my side pocket. But it doesn't matter
B001974DG0|5.0|excellent entertainment , edge of your seat story, full of excitement and humor and compassion..............go go go go go go
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love this app so much it was was really fun. The graphics were extremely cool. I love all of the new features. The only thing was that the original had more characters and in the new one one of the characters sounded like a 5 year old.
B00AA0TJO8|4.0|This is a very fun and creative game. I think if I had a styles I would enjoy it more though.
B005OP2928|5.0|The instant video purchase appeared in my amazon library through my roku player within seconds of purchase. The streaming video worked great. It is hard to find your purchases if you dont know where to look, its not in my videos or streaming you have to scroll down to the tab \\"library\\" to find them, which is counterintuitive.
B007BFSYMS|4.0|Realistic sounds. I like the sleep timer functions, especially the fade out time options. I use a long fade which avoids that sudden sound stop which would jolt me awake.
B0017ANAZO|3.0|This is a \\"chick flik\\" in every sense of the word.<br /><br />Ladies, don't expect your boyfriend to sit through this. He won't.<br /><br />Actually, I'm glad I didn't review this on a prior occasion. I would have panned it, which would have been unfair. After seeing it a second time, I realize that it's a better movie than I remember. Diane English has tried to make Clare Booth Luce's mid-1930's Broadway Play relevant to the 21st Century and that is just an impossible task.<br /><br />Ms. Luce wrote the play during a period when her husband was positioned in New York City. She was writing about the spoiled, self-centered, catty, gossipy society dames she had come to know and, of whom, she obviuously disapproved. This type of woman no longer exists unless you count people like Paris Hilton and Tinsley Mortimer and, who cares about them anyway? In the 1930's, this type of women were celebrities with reputations to uphold.<br /><br />Here's what's missing:<br /><br />Sidney's (Elizabeth Arden's)<br />The Train to Reno. (We fly now).<br />Miriam Aarons. (absorbed into Crystal Allen who has become a Soap Opera  Actress).<br />The Dude Ranch (Replaced by a Health Spa).<br />Lucy (absorbed into Cloris Leachman's maid).<br />Buck Winston.<br />Peggy (the naive newlywed).<br />The Starlight Room.<br />The re-union with Steven.<br /><br />These women all work. They all like one another. The cat fight has now been reduced to an argument on a street corner.<br /><br />Sylvia Fowler is now a nice woman played by Annette Bening who is too old for the part.<br /><br />Meg Ryan is gorgeous, but, you knew that.<br /><br />Eva Mendes is spectacular looking! What man wouldn't run after her?<br /><br />Candace Bergen recycles Murphy Brown.<br /><br />Cloris Leachman is good as always but she has nothing funny to say.<br /><br />Debra Messing is funny and plays not too bright but she's not as stupid or as mean as Phyllis Povah was in the original movie.<br /><br />Bette Midler, who would have been fabulous as the Countess has now become a predatory talent agent.<br /><br />Where is the sniping, gossip, mud-slinging, back biting and hair-pulling?<br /><br />This story is now PC and heartwarming. If that's what you want, here it is.<br /><br />Jungle Beige anyone?
B008518MOW|5.0|This is a great movie, definitely recaptures what made the first movie great. Also does a great job in the 3D deparment.
B00A80SHFM|5.0|The music and sound recording are lovely.  Having seen the film, I appreciate having hte film soundtrack rather than the stage soundtrack.  I realize stage tracks generally have better sound quality but this is fine for me.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|fun for all ages right here in this epic game I would recommend. this to anyone who absolutely loves horses
B000OLTMQ8|4.0|Typical Rocky storyline but I still enjoyed it. Sylvester Stallone does a great job as usual in this character. If you love Rocky you will like it.
B008RXYOKY|5.0|This works well and with a firewire 800 to 400 adapter can be used between old IMAC G5 and newer IMACs
B003TSEEDY|3.0|Very confusing.  I will have to re-read it to completely understand it.  However, I did enjoy reading it although it is difficult.
B008XGFZRQ|5.0|Good ol movie from my childhood. Forget twilight. This is what its about. Bought this for my kindle fire hd and have no.complaints
B007WFTFG6|3.0|It's hard for my child and me to color in the lines with this ar as there isn't many sizes associated with the brushes. But it is good for what they say. Besides it was free...
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Lots of puzzles.  All can be solved with a little thought.  Same old objective in a different venue but still like it.  Sensible number of hidden object games without over boring you.  Keep them coming G5.
B004HD61KE|4.0|Entertaining, keeps you wanting to read more. Interesting subject, I found myself researching various th<br /><br />Interesting book, easy to read. I found myself researching various parts of the book, which in turn lead to some great reading
B007TXN4TK|2.0|I did enjoy this app for about 2 weeks until I lost the sound - it's not an app you can use without it.
B009O2XY12|5.0|Interesting fun game. I have this on my iphone and this is a fun game that will keep you entertained for a while. a bit challanging.
B00A8SPNYW|2.0|After playing through a few levels, I forgot about this game until I got the reminder to review it. I remember that my finger is too fat to draw an accurate line for the rat to follow. Basically, it didn't attract me to wasn't to play again.
B006LSZECO|2.0|Genuinely happy to be done with this book. Took half way to become remotely interesting and the end sucked. Dont know why this was rated highly at all.
B000HAB4KS|5.0|Great Movie.  Streaming was great too.  It was easy to order online and the video quality was good.  No issues
B009KS4XRO|4.0|Love this Bongo app,only disappointments is the last ball,never gives enough time to use it.I have lost quite a few Bingo's because of this,other wise satisfied with game.!!!
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. It kept my interest. The only thing I thought was strange is that she had a very vivid memory of the past for someone that was only 4 years old when all this happened to her, and so did her boyfriend and he was only 6 yrs old. it didn't seem likely that they could remember  because they were so young. Otherwise I loved it.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|she had a wiled imagination.  I hate to think a young girl would go that far with any man good or bad
B00AOMR2S2|5.0|Great CD and a great movie!! Every time I listen to the CD it brings back the scenes of the movie.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|Perfect movie, my daughter LOVES it. Disc came pristine and has been watched many times. She opened it and screamed, &#34;MY FEELS, MY BABIES, MY FEELS!&#34;  I guess that's a good thing....
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|Just as long as you focus on land acquisition early, when it's cheap, you'll have a ball. Remember to ditch your low level buildings as soon as you can, because base space is a premium. Have fun!
B0052RDHTM|5.0|I have always enjoyed historical fiction, but the period of WWI wasn't usually that interesting to me.  However, Fall of Giants changed that, and to me, that was a big selling point of the book.  The author was very thorough and yet still kept me engaged through all of the political discussions as well as the stories of the characters.  Like other reviewers here, I could have used a lot less sex, a message that Follett seemed to have gotten and remedied in the sequel to this, Winter of the World.  I could have gotten the point with a few lines of suggestion rather than full-blown scenarios.  Otherwise, a splendid page-turner and educational too.  Can't wait for part III of the series.
B00AQ71FLK|3.0|Really fun and they give free different characters every week. A lot of connection issues and no way to make gems.  VERY BAD MATCHMAKING!!!!!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Temple Run two is a great twist on the original game with new characters, money, goals, and I love the mine portion of the game.
0547884591|1.0|Interesting that Tim Ferriss makes a point about analyzing why people put down cookbooks and then I hit those two points immediately with the first recipe for Osso \\"Buko.\\" First failure point - I don't own a cast iron Dutch oven. There are pages of up to $300 worth of equipment to invest in for his recipes. Second failure point - it's not clear whether or not I'm supposed to cut the bones or have them cut or if the photo labeled \\"shanks uncut\\" is referring to the bone or the meat. Just two pages of his first recipe already tripped me up despite having gotten through 132 pages on meta learning and big promises that he had simplified the world for me. Big disappointment after having heard about 8 podcasts of different Ferriss interviews which made me eager to get the book. I advise against it.
B007SGM084|5.0|Mesmerizing!!  Couldn't put it down. Not what I usually read, but well worth the adventure into new territory!!  Oh my, oh my is all I can say.
B007M45PMU|4.0|Great album with a foot stomping beat to it. I love most of the lyrics. Some of the songs end as you are getting into them.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I liked the writing.  It was very suspenseful, but I didn't like the ending.  She didn't get what she deserved.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|it is one of the best games I have played ever. I would like to see other people play this game.
B0000AFX64|5.0|it was great, better than star wars. It is great for family viewing. i recommend it for watching. good movie.<br />.THIS SHOULD HAVE BEEN ONE OF THE GREAT MOVIES THAT WOULD HAVE GONE ON FOR AGES.
B003YFIUW8|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book.  Seeing things from a 5 year old's point of view was really an experience and Emma Donoghue nailed it.  I grew to love both Jack and Ma and their indomitable spirits.
B003XOAJ7E|5.0|I first recieved this CD as a gift and after time it was lost, once I got this CD again all the memories came rushing back. I still have CD in my stereo in my truck and have been listening to it everyday. gets me in upbeat great mood!!!
B007IXWL2C|4.0|there were places where the story dragged a little, but overall it was a nice wrap up to Ana and Christian's story.
B0083ZRAJS|3.0|Normally, I am one that loves the original story in comparison to the movie that is made from it. In this case, I will say that the movie's story is much better than the book.  I feel that the book was poorly written and dragged on much too long. Dorothy and her friends reach the land of Oz in the middle of the book, which,I believe would make more sense to save for the end. Some of the lands they visited didn't make much sense and what went on there had no purpose in the story. I really think the movie out-shone the book on this one. I will still read the other books in the series though just the same.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|It was well written. Told the story from both sides. I was especially interested in the thoughts of the German pilot about the war and his role in it.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I love draw something because you get to ineract with your family and friends but with drawing except one time i  couldnt get in to my acount.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Absolutely best  Sci-Fi I have read in years and I have been reading Sci-Fi since 1966.<br />  The story is well written with the right mix of plot and subplots that keeps you wanting to keep reading. Characters that grab you and keep you guessing how it will end.<br />  I read a lot of different types of Literature(fiction,nonfiction,biography,historical novels etc..) and this book is on par with my favorites.<br />  Hoping this is not the end of the Wool series.<br /><br />  Lee Southard  Nabtucket,Ma.
B008M0NDOK|1.0|Duo-game and gameloft should be ashamed of selling such a uncomfortable controller. I can't believe in this day and age crappy designs that hurt to use are sold. I would like to play a game and enjoy the experience. A $5 app + an $80 limited use device = an unhappy customer. If you made the controller cheaper and or used some common sense in it's design, you would have a good device. If it worked with more than 7 titles it would tell me you care about your customers.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Grisham spreads his wings and sees his World from many angles. The World through the Eyes and head of an imprisoned coloured man is new and the plot is well hidden. I enjoyed it from start to finish.
B005HSL626|3.0|Friut ninja is only ok because it is not that addicting so people dont play it as much i like havent  played for  like a 3 months
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Look the people who gave it less then 5 you are dumb and are not cool but the others that gave it 5 are real cool
B009329Y30|5.0|Zachary Efron is so good looking and does fabulous in this movie. Mic you love nicholas sparks books you will love this movie!
B004SOR4H6|5.0|I like this app. I'm able to go right to Twitter rather than logging in on the traditional website. Fast, easy, and convenient.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love subway surfers because its fun you earn things and it is great for the car.my little bro steals my kindle to play it.
B0026772N8|4.0|This book was great. Definitely made me aware of trends in my life that I hadn't previously thought about.<br /><br />While it was written more than 30 years ago, the lessons are still very applicable to society today.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|im a horse horse lover i love love horses my user  name is crazyfish this game is awesome i really think allyall people out there should  get this amazing  app
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love this app! Pintrest is addictive and now I can bring it with me wherever I go. Lots of good ideas and a fun way to share ideas with others.
B00AB0AR2U|1.0|skipped and froze  sound was off and on very hard to follow maybe it is worn out .....i have had just one other issue with your rentals other than thee i am happy with your rental program ....thanks lori tihansky
B007M45PMU|4.0|The songs are light and uncomplicated, some are catchy, especially Hey Ho. There is definitely a consistent style throughout the album. Good music for bobbing along in life.
B005KELQEU|5.0|Very well made.  Fits my regular kindle perfectly.  An oddity is that there is a separate piece of padding, but it presents no problem.  There are less expensive cases, but you get what you pay for.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My nine year old daughter absoutely loves this app. The graphics are good and is also a fun way to pass time.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Dis good game it gets a little tiring a after a while. Still it is really fun and has pretty decent graphics. I am gonna tell all my friends about it!
B0050DIWFC|5.0|This was the first book I have ever read by Wiilliam Landay and I found this to be a great read.  It was just one of those books I could not put down!  I usually read my books at night to help me sleep; not a good idea for this one!  It kept me up much later than I normally would have liked!  The ending is just unbelievable; I recommend it highly!
B0046B8GEQ|3.0|Cute movie, my younger siblings liked, I liked it, and my dad even like it, except for one thing, the rude humour.  When it was rated PG for rude humor, I was not expecting what was on it.  Besides that it was funny and engaging.
B005COO1X6|5.0|I always enjoy reading Stephen King stories, this one was with a &#34;stand by me&#34; feel.  With a few twists and turns this definitely made me turn the pages. The only regret i have about it is that it wasn't longer.
B005USZML4|3.0|I know I am a great deal older that the audience for which this was written but I still found it a fun and a quick read.  it was certainly not as thought provoking as Mr. Grisham's other books but I usually keep a hard cover books of most of those to re-read over time.  This one I just bought for my kindle and I won't be buying a permanent copy to read again.
B00B2V66VS|1.0|worked one on my kindle fire.... hasn't worked since that one time I uses it. does aanyone have the same issue as me??
B005WMQ5R8|5.0|I can not say enough good things about this but this was a great piece of art. You got to buy it!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|My daughter loved it and wanted me to read it also. Glad I did. Looking forward to the next one.
B00A9X9ORI|1.0|I would not recommend this movie to anyone unless you are the type of person who wants to become numb to killing and who enjoys gratuitous nudity.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Great app and game.  It is a fun game and never a problem.  Highly recommended and probably the best solitaire game out.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Love this version! You can't go wrong.....buy it. I can't put it down! Love the ziplines and the awesome mining carts!
0307887960|4.0|I started this diet the day after Christmas and so far I've lost 10 lbs. I strictly followed the first three days of only lean protein and then fairly strict for the following weeks. I have had my &#34;cheat&#34; days in moderation and I still enjoy some wine every now and then, but I continue to lose. I did start the three days of lean protein again last week because I felt like I was getting too far off track. This diet suggests you have 1.5-2 TB of oat bran everyday. I did that for about two weeks and then I couldn't take it any more (so bland, so thick), so I don't have any now. Like I said, the weight is still coming off, but I am really getting burned out of the few options. I think this diet has been so successful because I have majorly reduced my calorie intake, and it does curb my cravings for sweets. I know right now that I could never stay on this one for several months, but the weightloss is definitely enough to keep me going for a while. My hope is to keep most of the habits (lean proteins, much less carbs, more veggies) from this diet and up the exercise so I can go off of it and make healthier choices on my own. Good luck!
B0027MJU00|4.0|I really loved it. For my taste, it took her too long to get me tuned into the story. Once it started to unfold, could not stop reading it. A great read if you love dark suspense.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This not only is a &#34;hot&#34; book but it has a wonderful story line behind it! I seriously LOVED all three of them!!!
B00AYB20KI|4.0|I watched it twice. Excellent movie. My husband said it was predictable, until we got near the end and he realized he was wrong. hahaha
B007NWCZR4|5.0|This is a must album for PSB fans. Love it and cannot stop playing the CD.<br />Tracks 8, 9 and 11 are my favorites on disco one.<br />Highly recommended.
B007FUMY8O|5.0|Who in the world has never heard of Sherlock Holmes?  From the time I was young I knew the name.  I was a lover of mystery novels from the time I received my first Nancy Drew book.  The thing was I never felt the need to pick up an actual book with Sherlock Holmes.  Never felt a need to watch any old Sherlock Holmes movies or TV. That being said I saw reviews for the BBC/PBS series Sherlock and was instantly in love.  The series has been amazing.  It has brought my to read my first classic Sherlock Holmes book.  Just was the foreword in this rendition by Benedict Cumberbatch said I was not disappointed.  I was happy for my kindle dictionary as some old English words I believed I knew the meaning, but was happy for confirmation.<br /><br />I really cannot say enough.  I really wish that this had been required reading when I was in school.  It was so much better then half the stuff that was required.
6305256209|5.0|El producto por ser VHS no deja de sorprender. La presentacion en tapa dura permite exibirlo en forma comoda en cualquier repisa y luego los contenidos son maravilla para cualquier collecionista !
B00AREIAI8|3.0|I really like this app a lot. I love how you can interact with you horse. But it lags A LOT on my Kindle Fire HD. Good app. Try it :)
B00A7Z8KAU|5.0|This is THE BEST drawing app for kindle fire hd. Such a step up from the mobile version. I paint quite a bit and what frustrated me was that mobile had a very restricted brush and color selection. Well, this doesn't. It has tons if different colors and brushes. Five stars!!!!!!!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|It takes some getting used to but everything is improved from the original. Some new features are added and the graphics are definitely improved. It's free so no one can complain. It's a great time killer. The layout of the game and how you play is a little more challenging and fun and its definitely more than just up down left and right now!
B007XC9BSK|4.0|My boys fight over this all the time.  So you know kids like it.  The youngest is 3 years old and he has trouble opening it at times but that's it.
0143122061|5.0|Ferguson has done civilization a favor, he has carefully examined the reasons why the West has dominated for the past 500 years. His ability to synthesize massive amounts of material into a coherent, highly readable story are never more apparent then here. His story is both frightening and encouraging and is a must read for anyone concerned with the moral, spiritual and financial drift of the U. S. In the end Ferguson almost relinquished his historian status to cheer the West on. Please Mr. President, read this.<br />Stanford R. Beebe, author of \\"Ben Franklin & the Prius\\"
B00B2V66VS|3.0|good game works fine until you start doing good.will run with no problems until I use the save me 3-4 in a single run and get thousands of coins and then use a save me again game will just close.everytime I do good and then use save me game shuts down.works fine otherwise.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Heartbreaking to the point of sometimes being unbearable, an completely amazing plot twist, thorough and repeatable... you feel the pain of Sky all the way to your heart.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|The second installment of this story was not a disappointment, though it did start out slow. I shouldn't be surprised, the first book was slow in the beginning as well. This is the type of series you curl up with when you want to escape for a bit.
B0051ANPZQ|4.0|In the beginning of the story I was hooked. The plot line was original and I loved the different perspectives. But at the end I kind of got a feeling Placido wanted to finish the story. The ending was abrupt and cheesy. Over all Wonder is an insightful book with a terrible ending!
B004ZJZPXO|5.0|I'm a fan of the Firefly TV series & was heartbroken when it was canceled.  This movie helped though.  I fell even harder it is now my favorite show ever & Serenity is my favorite movie.  It could have been 10 hours long & I would have stayed glued to my seat the entire time.  I'm so happy I bought it on Blu Ray too.  It's well worth it.
B008RJ6TTC|5.0|I  cannot  believe  how  many of  these  are  new  to me!!  The  plots are  terrific  and the  actors a  treat  and  of  course  Falk is a  legend.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|This is definitely a masterpiece of a movie. It was colorful, sensitive, warm, hopeful, and all around wonderfully done. I am not normally a fan of Anne Hathaway, but I was in awe of her stellar performance. I also don't normally care for musicals, but as the movie progressed I didn't even really notice that they were singing anymore. The music and performances flowed so well with the intended emotion for each scene that it actually pulled me in. (Not to mention, the music in Les Miserables is awesome!) I wouldn't recommend the movie for youngsters, due to mature themes and some sexual content, however it is a wonderful masterpiece of a movie that only comes along every so often.
B001EN71CW|5.0|I love this show so much & it should have been released on Bluray from day one!  No words can convey how awesome every aspect of this series really is.  From cast to graphics to story line, it's all so great.  Do yourself a favor & watch it.  One day you may call yourself a \\"brown coat\\" as so many of us do after watching this series.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I am amazed at how engaging this series is.  I do not often have trouble putting a book down, but I was very glad I had the final one handy.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I absolutely love the hunger game books. The are amazing.I recommend them for teenagers and even adults. Once you start reading you won't be able to put it down, you can't wait to find out what happens next!!
B003QSHIPS|5.0|Great album. Since it's on vinyl it sounds (to me) like the songs blend into each other much better than their digital counterparts. Also Gorillaz has a tendency to use so many instruments and sounds that their cds and mp3s get compressed making some parts of songs sound muffled. The vinyls sounds much clearer.
B001AH6ZWY|4.0|LOVE the movie and the added benefit of watching in Blu-ray is awesome! Stayed up WAY too late to finish watching one of my fave sci-fi movies. Four stars!!
B00AUA67GQ|4.0|I like it. I like that I can either write, or type and can use it off line as well as on.
B0098VYKSA|3.0|I watched this movie because i thought it would be great. Acting was ok Snow White cant act. Glad she didnt have to many lines. But over all OK
B009KUANWG|5.0|Adele is a wonderful singer and puts pure energy in all of her songs. It is so nice to have this download available for my kindle
B000FCKC4C|5.0|I really enjoyed this book which I read during a blue moment in my life. It was food for my soul.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|froze up and had to re install on kindle  but love love love it lots of fun and worth the freeze up!
B009UX2YAC|1.0|The game was awesome until the stuped people deleted all my progress. I had 70,000 some coins and now i have 0. My recommendation is DON'T GET THIS GAME OR IT WILL DELETE ALL YOUR PROGRESS
B00B2V66VS|5.0|in the first Temple Run it was just running but still amazing! And it should be 0.99 but it is free and never ends.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Love the ending! :)<br />It's great that Nicholas sparks added some mystery and suspense to the book. It just made the book even more fulfilling.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|A simple yet fun game. Great way to pass time. Could be improved by allowing for more rewards or options when starting the game. Such as custom designing a rider in one's own image an  having a few options for the first horse
B009VB9VKY|3.0|Pretty superficial story of the life of a male dancer.  The dance scenes actually got boring after a while. So so.
0486407217|4.0|This book was very informative.  The patterns were very detailed and they gave a very instructive look at how Victorian ladies dressed .  The only criticism I had was I wish the fashion plates were colored so I could more readily envision what the finished dresses looked like.  the book, however was just as described and I really should not complain as the book was not described as having colored pages.  I did mention to the seller that I wished they had mentioned the pages were not in color and they replied. with a very nice note and they refunded my purchase price which I thought was very generous of them.  Good Customer Service! I would not hesitate to order books from them again.
B009H5IS1W|5.0|i like this to stay on 4 ever its great show it make mi happy to watch great acting i would love to see alot more
0345535421|5.0|One of the great epic fantasy series of all time. Up there with J.R.R. Tolkien's \\"Lord of the Rings\\" and \\"The Hobbit\\"  and Robert Jordan's \\"Wheels of Time\\". The HBO series closely follow the books, but of course the TV series skips important scenes and details  because there's only so much you can cover in thirteen hour long shows. The books will suck you in just like the show and you will be rewarded for your patience with a greater depth of knowledge than could be covered if the HBO seasons were 20 episodes long.
030758836X|4.0|Much better if you don't know anything about the spoilers while reading the book. I hated the ending, but the first 80% of the book was worth the contrived ending.
0316069434|5.0|I've liked all of Michael Connelly's books and this one was no exception.  Love the Harry Bosch character.  Hard to put down. Read the entire book on my flight from Los Angeles to Tokyo
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|I liked this adventure game it was well thought out and less choppy than some I have played. The story was good without being as cheesy as it could have been. I keep thinking that one of these game design companies will start making liscensed games with the same kind of gameplay but in genres like Doctor Who, Downton Abby, The Big Bang Theory, etc. It seems like a logical convergence of marketing and game play demand.  Can't wait for more good games like this one, it was worth the $2.99.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Loved! This has got to be my favorite Stephen King book I have read recently. Just as long and detailed as his normal style with a ton of characters but in this story I was actually able to keep these beautiful characters straight! Well  done!
B0097EWK3A|4.0|ok game. Effie fcr yhg ty tgfdrf vgg h tgfdx<br />x but I wish you havex morethan one option for progreeesssss.
B0063IH60K|2.0|Too many adds. I get the &#34;it's for free&#34; thing. But I guess I would pay $.99 rather than try to get out of those pesky adds.
B0043RSK3K|5.0|I am still in the process of reading this book, but am far enough into it to give it a 5 rating. Authors Oliver Stone and Peter Kuznick tie specific events together in an understandable way regarding the history of the United States of America. The authors details try to expose many of the misconceptions we as citizens often have about our country's historical past.<br /><br />Honest, open-minded readers will be reminded that politicians, historians, bankers, and ordinary citizens on the street who live to promote their own agendas--motivated by lust for power or money--have been operating in this country from it's beginning down to present times.<br /><br />Those same honest, open-minded readers will also realize that America's propaganda machine is as good or better than Hitler's Nazi regime. That George W. Bush's declaration after  the 9-11-2001 destruction of the World Trade Center &#34;. . .you are either with us or against us&#34;, was just another of many experiments throughout our history of &#34;Psychological Warfare&#34; upon U.S. citizens.<br /><br />Hopefully the authors will help us wake up to the fact that just because we live in America, we are not the brightest people on the face of the earth. If fact throughout the history of our country we as individuals have all been fooled by persons in power who have deliberately lied to us.<br /><br />The result of these lies has led us to financial ruin as a nation, caused by endless undeclared wars, countless black budget intelligence agencies stacked one on top of another that can't deliver reliable intel, and the realization that even our allies and friends around the world question our sanity as we citizens continue to follow the liars who rule us.

B0056BMK6K|5.0|John Locke gives specific ways he sold 1 million copies in 5 months. A no-nonsense, step by step set of instructions on how other authors can avoid mistakes in reaching their customers.

B002MQYOFW|4.0|I REALLY ENJOYED, EVEN FOR A YOUTH BOOK. LIKE THE IMAGINATION OF THE AUTHOR. THE STORY LINE ITSELF WAS GOOD.
B007XF0X16|2.0|Nothing wrong with the disk, seller is good. But the movie itself is bad and actors didnt help to make you enjoy the movie
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I ENJOYED THIS BOOK. IT IS THE FIRST OF ITS KIND THAT I HAVE READ. I WAS SCEPTICAL. ONCE I READ IT, HAD TO READ THE NEXT AND THE NEXT! AGAIN, AWESOME FROM THE FIRST PAGE TO THE LAST.
B000HEWEJO|5.0|If you think Classic means boring or old fashioned, think again. The impact of this story transcends the period in which this movie was made. Idealistic? Yes. And don't we need more of this kind of hero who gives up his ambitions to save his hometown.
B002S8AGZG|4.0|I really like the move and the Bluray is awesome. Definitely worth to buy. The 10 years interview is a bit disappointing though given only three people showed up...
B00A6PD8RQ|4.0|Good for all ages, this story highlights the mother-daughter relationship. Should I do what my mother wants me to do with my life or what I want to do?
B00AYDC5HY|5.0|We loved this movie. My whole family enjoyed this movie it was great! Would definitely watch it again. Take a chance and give it a look!
B001AQO3QA|5.0|Bought for my husband who has every iteration of this movie since its release to home video, the Blu-ray makes a difference.
B008CIUS72|2.0|I thought this app would help watch and manage videos with my kindle fire.  It didn't help.  Yet it is a good app for android cellphones.

1439102732|5.0|I am attempting to read every book Jodi Picoult has wrote.  The way she uses discriptive settings is fascinating.  In one of her books the setting is RI where I lived for years and know the landmarks.  She wrote another setting here in Biddeford, Maine and again the landmarks she describes are so familiar.<br />Although I have heard many say her books are sad, I do not view them as that.  This is not a perfect world and Jodi has the ability to write about the more difficult times and yet exemplify how to get through.  Her books are mysterious at times, loving and heart warming at times, but always an excellent read.  Even my teenage grandchildren have enjoyed reading books by this talented author.
B0083Z6AH6|5.0|Just what I ordered! Thank you! Great seller!<br />I recommend product to anyone!<br />I love the book! Wonderful read! Just what I wanted!

B004UID2LC|1.0|i couldnt get any of the videos to load or play or anything, i was pretty let down by this app
0425252868|5.0|The featured story about the B-17 and the German Fighter was a display of humanity in war  that may have happened more than we realized...or maybe not.,..This picture that came through the book of the early professional German pilots, who for the most part were not Nazis , was of men fighting for their country, understanding the terrible toll they inflicted on the<br />enemy and the devastation they could not prevent.  War propaganda  made monsters of the military of both sides. But one telling story of the commander of Franz Stigler's unit  that he would court martial and execute any of his pilots who shot an Allied airman in his parachute.  The commander enjoyed the company of captured American and British pilots and tried to keep them out out of the grasp of the SS or Gestapo.<br />Some veterans of WWII may not  agree with that part of the story but I interviewed a number of POW's  in 1950 and those captured by the Germans maintained a less hostile attitude toward their captors.  Those in the Pacific Japanese hands were still hurting and hating.<br /> How pilots and crew of each side managed to live through the horrible air combat going out routinely makes me, a veteran of that war, tremble yet.<br /> The reality of what occurred on both sides in the war  should be a read for civilians of that era as well as military.
B006AZZPCM|1.0|couldnt get any of the videos to load or play or anything, i was pretty let down with this app
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This is like the complete better version of Temple Run.  Best Game Ever!<br />Imangi Studios, you should make more games and even more Temple Runs!

B0094BB4TW|5.0|app is very user friendly, i prefer using it on my kindle over my computer or phone while at home...also very fast
B0051ANPZQ|4.0|I have to admit that this was a great book. There where some not so good parts like when the guy Eddie oh my gosh!!! And some funny  parts like when he and Jack go onto the stairs and auggie falls down and a guy(a older kid) helps him get up and he looks at his face and says  whoa! And he and Jack laugh and Jack says I think he wet his pants . I like this book a lot and totally recommend this book. Happy Reading!

B009EAO38C|5.0|Music returned to its true artform.  Emotion captured in sound.  For anyone who loves true music, its amazing to be able to hear someones soul through this medium.  It makes it all that much more raw and powerful.  Joy, Love, Sadness, Excitement, Energy.  You can \\"hear\\" it all on this album.  Share, Like, Follow, and Support these guys.  They are truly giving all of themselves.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|This book was intense in such a great way. Charlie's differences will make your heart throb and break, all at once. Killer ending. I was not expecting it, which made it that much more captivating.

B007BVT5N4|5.0|I first read [[ASIN:B00B4M7OFM Justin Bieber: 101 Reasons Why He'd Be The Perfect Boyfriend]] (highly recommend it) cause I wanted to fantasize about him being my boyfriend. lol But this book made me get to know him better than any book I've ever read. It's a pretty emotional book, makes you laugh and cry. Now I want him to be my boyfriend even more. :) I love him so much. He's perfect!<br /><br />ps. I got the 100th review XD
B0071MQBX0|5.0|I have been blessed to see this live in London with Michael Crawford.  I absolutely loved Ramin Karimloo.  In my opinion, he has mastered the role and absolutely love his performance.  I believe his to be the best of all the previous phantoms.  His voice, his control, his dynamics!  Unbelievable!  Would recommend this one to anyone who loves musicals.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Love the options of playing various games.  Get bored with one you can play another one.  Liked everything of the setup for each game.  Good alternate to using the computer.  B
B00899DR40|5.0|Wasn't a fan of Justin Bieber when he first came out with Baby, Baby, Baby or whatever that was.  But, I absolutely love this album!!!

B008AX1HD8|5.0|Having read all the later Nesbo books based around the character of Harry Hole, I enjoyed being able to learn the details which are talked about in the later books.  Particularly liked meeting the younger Harry Hole before he becomes more and more jaded by his experiences.  I 'fell' for his character all over again!
0316227706|5.0|I love this book that I got for my husband for Christmas. It is amazing that dogs keep their eyes open underwater. Your sweet neighborhood dog looks like they are out of Jurassic Park underwater. It is a lot of fun to look at the photos.
B00000IQW3|5.0|This movie uses some of the very first computer generated effects which pass with flying color for the age of the movie. The story is about having a desire but that desire is fulfilled with a twist of faith.
0345803493|5.0|I got all three of the books great read and a reread. I even foreard to friends all loved it
B004HW7JH4|5.0|Love this show.  Can't wait until season 6 starts soon.  You get so involved<br />with the story lines of each on of the characters that you can't wait until<br />a new show starts..............love, love, love it
B00331OO2S|5.0|By far the best history book on the Korean war.  As one who served in the military in Korea, the book accurately  went into the best detail of any book ever written.  Well written.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|This is the best show on TV right now.  I never miss a show.  Just get so involved<br />in the story and love all the members of the family.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this is the BEST temple run yet I love this game it is so addicting LOVE IT!  BEST GAME EVER!
0553328255|5.0|The seller shipped quite quickly, and I was pleased at how soon it came. Amazing book set, I would recommend to anyone that they should read all of Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes novels and short stories. Sir Doyle was very ahead of his time in writing these books; that being said, no murder mysteries written today can compare. I see so many young girls watching the Robert Downey Jr. Sherlock films, swooning over the actor himself with no knowledge of the root of the story. The closest adaption to these books that I have seen that actually manages to capture the raw emotion Sir Doyle put forth in his stories is the BBC series, Sherlock. Though this review isn't about the TV show, I still highly recommend it. All the same, if you're a reader and skipping these books, you're missing one of the greatest stories of all time. Holmes and Watson's amazing chemistry is, in part, why these stories are so beautifully emotional. Five stars is all I could give this set, but I'd give it more if I could.
B00908DDZM|5.0|I'm old fashioned enough that I still prefer albums over digital content (or even digital albums) - I like being able to look through the art (there is an illustration for each of the songs on the album) and the music has sparked a #1 hit.  The rest of the album gets a lot of play from me - a really solid fluctuation of style and substance throughout the album that still maintains its ability to feel like a connected whole.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|Broad sweep of tumultuous humanity. Shines light on such essential emotions - conscience,  compassion, justice , fatherhood, patriotism, dishonour.... indeed a gamut of the pieces of which we comprise. Truly classic masterpiece.
B0002F6BRE|4.0|Elf and Bad Santa - that's really all you need to get you through the November to January period of having to constanly listed to sappy christmas music everywhere you go.  A viewing of Elf turns my 'Bah Humbug' into &#34;Merry Christmas!&#34;.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|AWESOME I love horses and I love this game.<br />I wish you could pick your horse from the start<br />The only thing I love more than horses is steak that's it.
B00AHSINKO|2.0|It was cute and the trailer made it look great but we kept waiting for something to happen and when it finally did it was kind of anti-climactic.
B004UJTG6Q|5.0|I really enjoyed this book :) I would recommend it to people 11-18 that enjoy to read. It's a book that if your board, you can pick it up and entertain yourself for hours! (At least I could ;) so I advise to read adventures of Tom Sawyer!!!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I think it is great it needs work but it is so much better than the first one . I played this with my family and love it to . I think every one should have it.
B0083Z614S|5.0|I love this book ,it is awesome!!! I recommend this book to  most any body who likes to read!!! Lovely story!!!
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is woo fun and addicting...I love it spool much its absolutely my favorite game! I reccomend this game to everyone! its totally kid friendly too!
B004SUWR2C|5.0|I have no complaints about this app.  It always works and I've never had any problems with is! I play it all the time.  Never gets old.  I love this app!!
B0015O5XUM|5.0|A 3-CD collection of all of the biggest hits.  Even some surprising &#34;deep cuts&#34; including &#34;Little Village.&#34;  A good solution to take along on a trip.
B009VLX8FS|4.0|I only listen to I knew u were trouble and never getting back together but it is amazing music to listen to! Trust me on this one
B008IJTFYW|4.0|This is a fun app that lets you customize the sounds that help you relax the most. It is great for traveling if I want to cut out extenal noise to sleep or meditate. It does not play over other applications though.
B0092YO8C6|5.0|I think this CD is amazing with really amazing songs on it plus ross lynch is so cute and I hope all enjoy this CD because it's amazing
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book was absolutely amazing....just the whole thing....throughout I cried, laughed, got mad, and even started thinking with a new perspective of life.  Sometimes life is hard for everyone, and saying that I think that now I can find a way to truly show my feelings. Through my entire life, when I was upset about something, or happy even, I always thought that I shouldn't be feeling that way....that someone else had it worse than me or that someone else had a better life. If I was truly upset I would try to hold back because I felt that I had no right to be upset about it because there were other, even worse reasons to be upset. I felt terrible because other people were dealing with other things and being strong and here I was, crying over a stupid boy, or upset because someone close to me died but other people were close to that person so I should be stronger because it was their best friend, it father, or grandfather, or something like that. However after this book, I think that if I'm upset,I am allowed to be, no matter how small or big the problem is I'm upset for a reason and I am allowed to be. I want to be able to really feel and be able to understand everything that I am going through, whether it be good or bad, they are my feelings and no one else can know exactly how I feel or what I am going through.... this book is a way to show people that you can feel whatever you want to feel and th here is no reason to judge yourself for feeling that way.. this is an amazing book and I'm probably going to 're read it time and time again and I hope that others do the same
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I love angry birds and it is funny and a little hard too.I hope u people who bought this app have an awesome time playing this game
B00AHXIC50|4.0|Gorilla and Locked out of Heaven are my favorites. I haven't explored the whole album but I love those two. I think he is the spiritual successor to Michael Jacksons style even though he isn't doing it intentionally.
B009PEKRY6|5.0|I love this CD and bridget is a good singer and her music is amazing that's why I enjoy this CD and I hope u other people enjoy this cd
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Received this dvd set as a gift because I had missed it on tv. Immediately I was absorbed into  the world of Downton, the culture, the traditions, the family.  It is set in a different world and time but intertwines the stories of the  rich with the world of the servants.  All storylines are interesting and relevant and the twists and turns make it very interesting.
B008OW1S3O|5.0|I loved this album. One of the best albums of 2012 in my opinion. Every song on here is worth listening to and worth every penny. It's hard to find bands as good as alt-j. I can't wait until they come out with a new album!
1250027624|5.0|How great it was to read some of the history of the times and the events that led to events affecting the Crawleys and Granthams.  And the photography...I just cannot get enough of the splendor of that era!  A wonderful book to keep forever.
B0084IG7KC|5.0|Happy customer. Would use this vendor again!! Yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, and yep
B00AEFY3MC|5.0|Lighten up you one star types!  Its not about the plot.  Its a tribute to Star Trek (which obviously would also earn one star from some people despite the fact that it has made such an impact on our pop culture! For Pete's sake, Mrs O. was dressed like a Romulan at the 2013 Innauguration.)<br /><br />The choppy thing scene is worth the 6 bucks! So after keeping this on my TIVO for a year, I broke down and bought my own copy.
B0067EKY9K|5.0|Happy customer. Would use this vendor again!! Yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, and yep
B009HEJXFS|1.0|There were so many interruption in the streaming that I was never able to finish the movie.  I tried to go on line to contact Amazon about this issue and could not find a user friendly way to correct the problem.  I like I paid for nothing.
B00A2LOAKI|5.0|Having been a fan of The Dark Knight Returns since it was first published 27 years ago, I've always known that any sort of animated film adaptation would be held under SERIOUS scrutiny, as well it should.  This is one of the greatest graphic novels ever published and, in order to do it justice, the attention to detail must be extraordinary.<br /><br />If Batman: The Dark Knight Returns, Part 1 amazed you, Part 2 will blow your mind.<br /><br />They gave it the treatment it really deserves and the results are spectacular.  It's faithful to Frank Miller's artistic style as well as the original storyline, with only minor changes to help it better fit the medium.  In fact, I was surprised at how faithful.  There were elements that I didn't expect to be there that were included and, dare I say it, they expanded upon certain elements, especially the fight scenes, that actually made them MORE EXCITING! Those kinds of things tell me that they REALLY did their best to make this what everyone wanted to see.<br /><br />Part 1 was met with epic reviews and I believe that Part 2 deserves even MORE praise.  We get the exciting conclusion we've all been hoping for and it goes ABOVE and BEYOND expectations.<br /><br />This 2-part collection is, without a doubt, the best animated feature I've seen in years and will, no doubt, be a fan favorite for many years to come.
B000GCFG7E|5.0|This is a great series, hard hitting, entertaining, with a touch of humor.  Great entertainment - read the whole series!
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|WOW, I came in on this series late so I had to spend a weekend catching up, LOVE this series. Don't rent it, buy it. This is one of those rare series you will watch over and over again.I hope Downton Abbey has at least 10 or 15 more season, finally a TV show that you can enjoy watching with everyone in the family.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I love horses and this app is a cute entertaining way to pass time. So far, so good! Good for little girls.
B00004Y6NT|5.0|I'm a fan of Dire Straits, and I thought their first two albums were their best, and this is their second album. It sounds completely different then the current work of Mark Knopfler's solo material. Dire Straits isn't really in the same category of a traditional rock band, but it isn't folk music which Mark Knopfler sounds like in his current work. It's hard to categorize Dire Straits, but that's why I like them, and their second album Communique is highly recommended if you like their first.
B008Y2X78S|5.0|This has been one of my favorite offerings from HBO.  Steve Buscemi is outstanding in this complicated role.  He is both vulnerable at times and ruthless as they come.  I also enjoy the fact that this series has gone to great legnths to make all the details accurate from the period.  Great show!
B0063TX06I|5.0|I have this album as a record, and was looking for it in CD, but it was rare and pricey. Now, it is affordable and great to have it in my CD collection. I think this is the first Bee Gees album that had their disco-era falsetto sound, which would characterize their biggest hits. But there's no reason to not enjoy this album even if you prefer their older non disco stuff. Bee Gees is one of the greatest groups of all time, and this is a landmark album in my opinion, marking the success in the '70s which they would enjoy.
159102594X|5.0|This is definitely one of my favorite books in the Noir Fantasy Genre. In fact, it's one of my favorite books period.<br /><br />The reviewer who said; \\"Think Lord of the Rings as directed by Kurosawa\\" is dead right.<br /><br />The pacing is fierce. There are no fluff chapters. Even if the characters are doing \\"nothing,\\" there is something to take note of. (Especially if you are trying to figure out what is going on behind the scenes.) The character building is phenomenal. I know people who are less three dimensional than these characters.<br /><br />Warning: This book is a set up for the next one, much like all trilogies are, and it may seem as if nothing got done. DO NOT be discouraged! I have finished the trilogy and believe me, stuff got done in this book. It's like the first book of the Lord of the Rings. Not a lot SEEMS to have happened and it's rather trying at times. Then we get to the end and everything comes neatly full circle.<br /><br />The only difference is that the circle in The Blade Itself if dug deep and filled with blood.
B00A1XOPE8|4.0|Definitely a Brandon Sanderson work.  Nice descriptions of a new magical element.  Nice character development for a short story.  Worth the look, especially if you're looking at picking him up as a new author.  It's a great preview before trying to pick up one of his series or longer works.  Get prepared for a long wait though if you pick up one of his newer series.  He has too many irons in the fire to put them out in a decent amount of time.
B000022TSH|1.0|Cut out the dead spots and condense it down to 45 minutes.  As it is, it drags on and on.  Jack tries to be Bogart, but Jack is no Bogart.  It IS a dull and boring movie.  Save your money and buy the Pianist if you want a Polanski movie.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I loved the Perks of Being A Wallflower immensely. It kept my full attention from the start. To sum it up, I would say that it provoked a lot of thoughts as well as being unwittingly funny and its own unique novel. It made me laugh, smile, and cry all at the same time. It is definitely a must-read for all!
B008XG1X18|5.0|This app is wonderful for anyone that has a slight addiction to Pinterest like I do! I would definitely recommend this!
B00005JNQS|5.0|I like this item and my kid likes it too.  Very nice DVD.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This is the best app invented yet! It is like temple run but is has airlines,waterfalls, and more! I would really recommend this app. Whoever runs across this app, buy it!
B001FB55HQ|4.0|This turned out to be a fairly good movie.  I thought it would be boring at the end of the Terminator series but it wasn't.
B000HKYA1I|4.0|A must see.  Very interesting and kind of different, but an interesting message of how our history is who we are and what connects us to each other as individuals.
B004SBULWE|3.0|I dont think you need it on a kindle fire but it works great on my phone. But that is just my opinion
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I'm addicted to this game bought it last night, and now I can't stop till I get stars on all the levels!<br />I LOVE IT!!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|This book is a great book.  I really suggest it and would recommend it to anyone! Even if you do not like Stephen King you should read this book.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|Not as responsive to finger swipes as Temple run 1 on iPhone 3. Very frustrating due to swipes not working.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|This book was recommended to me by a customer of mine and it was one of the best books I have read.  I read a lot of books so that is saying al lot.  It makes you take a look at your dog and kind of know what he thinks.
B005IZV33A|1.0|I'm rating the kindle version. Mostly annoyed that at this time, the kindle version is over 10$ for a very short book. I'd be willing to pay that much for a hardcover, but for a digital version it's ridiculous.<br /><br />I needed this for a lesson, but I don't get my supplies reimbursed, so I'm looking for cheaper substitutes.<br /><br />Ugh, so I decided to download the audible book to see if I could supplement my lesson without the book. The narrator's voice is terrible and I can see it giving my kids problems.
B00B2V66VS|1.0|I click on the app to open it, and it gets to the big &quot;I&quot; (the green gem thing while it loads)  it stays there for about ten seconds, says &quot;welcome back to amazon game circle&quot;  and then it closes.  I got to play it once.  (the day I downloaded it)  other than this its a good game.  just unusable.  (kindle fire gen.1)
030746363X|4.0|Everything you need to know for this diet is contained here. I am just not sure that people like me have the constitution to stick with certain aspects, like the brief exercise periods. I find the idea of a binge day both attractive and dangerous. When I use the binge day to eat things like sugar and bread, I end up craving them the next few days and the binge day spreads out to several days. I'm sure this has more to do with me than with the diet but I have ended up adopting certain aspects of this diet with a juice-based diet which seems to be working better for me. The juice diet allows me to have a fruit and spinach/kale smoothie in the morning and I have to say that overall, I feel physically better with the juicing. I generally have one meal that is made up from this book -- a chicken breast, broccoli, and black beans for the most part or a variation on that -- every day. The fellow is a bit of a fanatic which can be daunting to those of us who are not!

1449410243|4.0|Not quite as funny as I thought it would be, but I still enjoyed it and found it worth buying.

0307592731|5.0|A EPIC  ADVENTURE FROM A VERY SAD BACKGROUND- A MUST READ FOR SOMEONE WHO HAS LOST A CHILD, PARENT OR OTHER FAMILY MEMBER. INSPIRATIONAL AND HELPS THE HEALING PROCESS. G
1594203334|4.0|As an American raising kids in France, I read Raising Bebe with gusto.  There were a couple times that she sums up my feelings so exactly, so concisely, that those parts alone made the book worth reading.<br /><br />These few come to mind:  \\"At a party I hit it off reasonably well with an art historian who's about my age and who speaks excellent English.  But when we meet again for tea at her house, it's clear that we observe vastly different female bonding rituals.  I'm prepared to follow the American model of confessions and mirroring, with lots of comforting \\"me-toos.\\"  She pokes daintily at her pastry and discusses theories of art.  I leave hungry, and not even knowing whether she has a boyfriend.\\"<br /><br />Another: \\"Though I've made some inroads in France, I miss the United States.  I miss grocery shopping in sweatpants, smiling at strangers, and being able to banter.\\"<br /><br />There were moments where I felt she had struck something profound, something I had never actually given much thought to.  She talks, for instance, of the magic words \\"bonjour\\" and \\"au revoir\\" and it is true that these are the most essential words of politeness for a French child.  These words are required at any entrance/exit (yes required.  Not just expected/hoped for as proof of politeness like in the US); and unlike please and thank you, they actually put the kid on the same level as the adult.<br /><br />Lastly, there were moments of total disagreement.  Nowhere was this more evident than when it came to food restrictions during pregnancy.  In my experience the food rules about the same as in the US.  She mentions a booklet issued by the government sent out to all pregnant women, but didn't seem to notice all the food restrictions in it.  It outlines them very clearly.  Not only that, but most of the good stuff in France falls into the restricted categories, with all their marvelous raw milk cheeses, cured meats and raw egg dishes like mousse au chocolat.<br /><br />The continualcategorization of American kids as little terrors and French kids as obedient was taken a little too far, and didn't seem to coincide with any reality I know.  I wouldn't take this book too seriously as a child-rearing book, although there is some good advice.  The good advice, though, seems pretty similar to things I've read in American child rearing books.<br /><br />One glaring omission is the congee parental (parental sabbatical).  For a second child, after a French woman's standard 3-month maternity leave, mothers can take 3 years off and receive a small stipend.  It isn't much, but enough to ease the shift from a two-income home to a one-income home.  And after their youngest child is 3 years old, they can get their old job back!!  By law!!  In America, it is hard to go back to work after such a long pause.  The congee parental offers both the incentive to stay with your small children, and the possibility to go back to work once they are in school.<br /><br />So not overly objective, and not to replace any parenting books, but a very enjoyable read.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|mildly entertaining but it helps if you're trying to kill some time. I guess I was expecting more from all of the good reviews but I can't complain. I just wish there was more to do.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Began a bit slow, but soon the characters pulled you in and I could not put it down.  The main characters shared a personal and intense bond. The ending surprised me. Excellent.
B00ARF92HK|1.0|I cant believe anybody enjoyed this movie. The first movie (Judge Dredd) was sooo much better. This movie had no plot and the dumbest characters ever. On top of that the character \\"Dredd\\" was a total DB. You never even see his face. I wouldn't watch it if it were free. You'll never get that 2 hours back in your life!!!
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Lots of fun to this game esp. if you like the adventure. type of games I recommend this to all.
B00AXVH8KQ|2.0|My grandma bought me this CD because she thought that was \\"what the kids are into these days\\". I don't even listen to indie, I just wanted that new 2-chainz s***. Even if I did listen to indie, it sure as hell wouldn't be foxygen. No self respecting black man is gonna be driving through the city in his cadillac blasting a band named foxygen, I mean come on. I understand how some of you white folk might find both the name and the music appealing, but I plead you, only buy this CD if you don't want the African American community to respect you. Just know that the westboro baptist church is one of foxygen's biggest fans.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|My kids and I play this VERY often, which requires the Kindle to recharge often.  The game gets your brain working.
B009VB97EY|1.0|As an avid Harry Potter fan and an all around lover of any kind of magic tricks, I am deeply disappointed by this sequel.  I sat through all 111 minutes of it and not once did I see a single magic trick.  It was just a bunch of boys with their shirts off flopping their genitals around.  I do this sort of thing every morning before showering for work.  If you are looking for magic tricks, this is not the movie you want.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is wonderful. I highly reccomend it to people of all ages. It's a great way to pass the time!
B007BFSYMS|5.0|It keeps a nice even sound and takes away most sounds around me that I normally wake up to at night.
B0083P1QUM|4.0|I am still in the process of reading this book, but so, far, I am enjoying it. I have not gotten that far, may 1/4.  I am sure I will enjoy the rest of the book.
B004DLPXAO|4.0|I would of given kindle for android 5 stars...BUT for some reason it will not longer let me send my files to my Tablet that has kindle adroid app.  It used to work just fine and now it has stopped working and it's driving me crazy.  I had a mobi book which I uploaded to my kindle library and it is there and it has no problem sending it to my phone; but no matter what I do it will not sync on my tablet.  I have never really had a problem with the app on the phone but it acts wonky from time to time on my tablet.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|It is one of the best television shows I've seen.  The characters are so well drawn out and cast - I am totally addicted.
B009DTHZNE|5.0|I ordered the Pearl Jam Twenty(3-Disc Deluxe Edition DVD) as a Christmas gift for my son.  He was thrilled to get it and told me later that it was awesome, he loves it!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Although I don't like many mindless games, this one I made an exception. It keeps me entertained for hours. This isn't a game for someone who doesn't like games that repeat themselves. Its a great game to just play if you don't want to think. Great for kids too, in my opinion.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Very fun and entertaining. Looks beautiful and it's free! It is at least worth a try, the diamonds are a little difficult to get though. I think it is very very fun and you should get it for sure. It's better then any other horse game I've played before.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I really like this game because of the graphics<br /><br />I like pie<br /><br />umh<br />yep<br />I like temple run<br />but temple run 2 is cooler
B00A9C3RB8|2.0|It was not the movie it was promoted to be. The ending was good though, it brought together a solution to the couples problems, but I was hard pressed to laugh through the movie.
B004HW7JH4|5.0|Televison at his best. The recent history being told chapter after chapter with a nice cast and a wonderful screenplay.<br />Ought to see it.<br /><br />Carlito Camargo
B004G6009K|5.0|This is great blu-ray movie. The picture is beautiful and the 3d is just excellent. Among the best I have seen.
B004Y042N8|5.0|This is a fun game. I wish it had some cool music to go with it. I would definitely recommend this.
B008NEMN0K|3.0|I already had this movie on Blu-Ray and really enjoyed it. Wanted to get it in 3D. The picture quality was very good but the 3D is very poor. Great price.
B004GHNIRK|4.0|Don't start this book unless you plan on putting alot of time into it. Although this is an abridged version. I love the story and it is worth the time.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I am very glad to have the Bible downloaded on my kindle.  It allows me to take the Bible with me wherever I go with easy access.
B003MC5N28|3.0|Purchased for my daughter for a class assignment.  Its an okay read, not my style of reading but it wasn't horrible.
0930289234|5.0|I'm just going to say that you can't begin to consider yourself a comic book or graphic novel fan without reading this at some point.  You don't have to love it, but for me it stands as the greatest piece in the medium, and one of my favorite books of all time.  I've come back to it often over the years, and I have reread it in part or in whole at least a dozen times.<br /><br />Simply put, this is a must read.  Ignore the film, and just read it ASAP.
0385535147|5.0|This was a very good read. It even had some unusual twists. I expected some from Grisham, but this was good !
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|very good show, it was easy to access on the net and i was able to see the earlier shows that i had mssed
B008HK3XU4|5.0|Just what I expected. The color I want & like that it makes in to a stand so I can watch movies while playing on the computer.
B0091THDOM|3.0|Within 24 hours of receiving and using the case, the stitching on the sides came unraveled. Kinda sad, because I did like the case. It fit my iPhone 5 snugly, and the elastic pull strap worked well. That being said, the poor quality of construction makes this a bad buy.  I had read the other reviews, and knew that the stitching might come loose, but I figured, for basically ten dollars, if I get a month's worth of use out of it, it would be worth it.  Boy, was I wrong! A day's worth...if that!  Don't waste your money on this product until the company can address their production issues and make a product that is more sturdy!<br /><br />UPDATE (05/21/2013): I was just contacted by customer service. They have acknowledged a batch of product that did not meet their quality control standards, and have offered to replace it for free. YEA! We will see how the new one holds up when I get it in and I will update from there!  Thank you Snugg for some great customer service!!!
B007CIQ4B2|5.0|I listen to this CD nonstop! I will be buying more of his music and hope to see him live sometime.
B004HD61KE|3.0|Did I miss something?  I bought this book based on glowing reviews and $1.99 Kindle price.  I have to wonder if all the five star reviews are authentic.  The plot line was unbelievable and the writing was in need of much editing.  I struggled to finish this book and, frankly, skimmed much of the second half.  I will not purchase another book by this author.
B009H442DG|5.0|We really enjoyed hearing the two of them sing together again, especially for fans of Grease!  Worth every penny spent!
B0095XPZBC|4.0|Nice to see these on blu-ray although disappointed to see the prices start at $80 , seems like a rip-off to me like back when the DVD's were selling for $120 per season.<br /><br />I wouldn't buy this until after these seasons are released seems they drop below $60 after the release date. By in reality I would say it's true worth is around $50.
B00A6PD9I4|3.0|Visually stunning, this is a good film.  I can't help but feel that the protagonist was supposed to break the mould and be strong and independent; but instead seemed reckless, irresponsible, and a little annoying.  Her archery was really cool, and the family was really fun, but there was something lacking.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|it is very fun and its adicting to play for me and my sister and its fun to do when you are bord
B005ZMUXDC|5.0|So, my daughter really likes this movie, and quotes from it all the time.  She is three.  We enjoy singing the songs together, and there are touching moments and humor that appeal to young and old alike.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Couldn't put this book down! Many different twist to the plot. Made it very interesting. Loved It! Would recommend it!
1481251880|5.0|I loved this book and I am now a big fan of Colleen Hoover's! I could not put it down, every page leaves you wanting more. So well written and suspenseful, a new twist around every corner. I hated to see it come to an end. Please keep them coming Colleen!!!
B005Z271Y6|5.0|Best live concert, very touching and funny at the same time. Totally recommended. One thing I miss were subtitles in other languages.
B009ZZDNT6|1.0|I don't know how it works on the Fire but the layout is pretty wonky on a phone. Tried to set it up but won't be using it again. NOT FOR ANDROID PHONES
B008MG1E4A|3.0|&#34;No Easy Day&#34; should be entitled &#34;No Easy Decade.&#34;  More of the book is about the authors years of training beforehand.  You will be over halfway done with the book before even the planning of the now famous raid is even mentioned.  I enjoyed learning about the training and previous missions, but I bought this book to read as much detail as possible on that one mission to kill Bin Laden.  Even when the descriptions of the raid begin, the author leaves out many details for security reasons.  For example, the author only mentions flying in on &#34;Blackhawk helicopters&#34; without even mentioning the stealth capability that is already inferred by the public.<br /><br />Just go see &#34;Zero Dark Thirty&#34; and you'll be more informed.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Awesome game so addicting I downloaded it and found myself playing for a good hour so much fun and good visuals somehow they managed to make cleaning horse poop fun I highly recommend it.
0786962984|4.0|Like many reviewers I picked this up for my five year old to introduce him to D & D. We have played about six games and he is having a blast. The classes are fun although the wizard really does get the worst deal especially if he rolls a low number of spell cards. My only other complaint is that they should have provided some sort of card holder because the cards types are many and it would make it much easier. Overall the quality of the product is very good and I see many years of play. This is a great way to get non-gamers to play without being bogged down by the minutiae of the standard game.
B004GXZ69W|5.0|Excellent product. A must purchase. Great for usage expecially if you have problem with your hand or wrist. Everyone should get it
B00A9C3RB8|5.0|Love both of these guys.. 14 more words required and I have nothing more to say so I will sign off..
B008LV8TSU|5.0|Loved the ghibli film for years, the book is even more wonderful. Do wish for a sequel adventure in this land but not keeping my hopes up.
1400069289|4.0|Charles Duhigg is an investigative reporter so you do not get the straight forward clinical approach as you would from a doctor. You do get a wonderful insight into what is Habit and the process needed to change it.<br />We are told the story of Alcoa the corporate giant that was failing when it brought in Paul O'Neill as the new CEO. When introduced to a room full of executives and investors awaiting some new marketing strategy or production quotas, he tells them how they are going to reduce accidents to zero and make safety a priority. They thought he was nuts, but in a short time the company was at the top of it's game, and it's safety record top of the industry. The changes made in the habit of correcting safety issues carried over into other aspects of the company.<br /><br />Febreeze almost wasn't.Marketing had to figure out how to get consumers not only to try it but to continue to use it. How to form the HABIT. We learn how Target uses your shopping habits to customize it's offers sent to your door, aimed at you and just how much this shopping giant knows about you.<br />There are many other anecdotes from Starbucks, the Buccaneers football team, pepsodent tooth paste, many others both large and some personnel.<br /><br />40% of all we do is from Habit, meaning most of our day is spent reacting without much thought. A Habit has 3 parts, the Cue or Trigger, the Routine, and the Reward or Craving. To change a habit do not try to change all 3 as it will be to confusing or difficult. What we need to do is figure the Routine and change it. The Cue or Trigger will still be the same and we will still receive the Reward or our Craving at the end all we will do is change how we got there.<br /><br />It sounds so simple and often times some take no time at all, while others may take months to cement the change.We need to keep a log, journal or notes as to what the trigger is, our routine and identify our reward.Then decide what we are going to change the routine to and then start the process knowing we may slide at times but to keep at it.Also to be noted is that the past Habit is still there is we are not careful, which is why even after years former smokers still feel the urge sometimes.<br /><br />This was a well written and very informative book and I would highly recommend it.
B002OSXDAU|5.0|If you consider yourself a conservative or even just a Republican (Independents are also welcome), this book and its &#34;sister&#34;, &#34;Atlas Shrugged&#34;, are required reading. Although they are dated, they still pack a knock-out punch..
B009LUBA7M|5.0|I've loved Mika since I was in high school. His most recent album doesn't disappoint. If you like his older stuff, you'll love this too. If you've never heard his music before, give one of his songs a chance. He's worth at least 4 minutes of your time.
1416955070|5.0|ok, so if you are reading this, i assume that you haven't bought it yet.. and i right. well if i am, then stop freaking reading this and go buy it because it is one of the best YA books you will read in your entire life! ( one of my favoritebooks but i only read YA books, so yeah) just go buy it. it has romance and humor, lots of things to make you laugh, and it also has intense scenes if you like those. it has everyting. thats what im saying. so once again, just go buy the freaking book, what can it hurt
B00B2V66VS|5.0|The kids love this game more than the first.  They love the graphics and the new stuff that was added - including the bigger monster
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|This game is incredible. Didn't drag on like others. I'd recommend this to anyone.<br />It was a lot of game and well worth the money spent.
B005CWRB44|5.0|I've got a bigger Surefire and now this tiny light.  For its size and single CR123 battery I don't think you can get any brighter for the size.  I also don't think the size can get any smaller with a CR123 as power source.  Great little light for the money for easy daily carry for those times you need it but don't plan on it.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Loved playing this on other devices. This one is just as easy and has become my favourite. Nice to be able to get clear readable screen.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|its way better than other games and it had a mine place where u go in a cart and ride it with twists and turns and the truck is to turn a little and a lot
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This app is awesome- so much more cool stuff better than  temple run . Buy it. It is soooooo we worth the price- which is free:)
B0091QS88K|4.0|I downloaded this game for my 18 month old since she loves the Dr. Panda Hospital, but this is a little harder to use, but with help she loves it.  Good game, easy to use...
B00B2V66VS|3.0|When I try to use gems to revive myself, I get kicked out of the the  game and nothing saved except the gems I had used during the the run would be gone. This REALLY ticks me off.
B000002KGT|5.0|This timeless classic is one of the best rock albums of the 1970s, with 45 million copies sold throughout the world on various formats. `Rumours' is indisputably Fleetwood Mac's finest moment, the never-equalled crowning achievement of a success story spanning 40 years. Due to the divorces and relationship break-ups afflicting all five simultaneously during the recording of `Rumours', Stevie Nicks claimed the band `created the best music when in the worst shape' and Lindsey Buckingham retrospectively claimed the tensions contributed to `the whole being more than the sum of the parts'.<br /><br />So, is this `35th Anniversary Edition' worth buying? Well, leaving aside the fact that it's actually 36 years since the album's February 1977 release and not 35, your purchasing decision will likely depend on whether you already have a previous release of `Rumours' (there have been several).<br /><br />The packaging is certainly tasteful, with a 4-section gatefold sleeve containing a beautifully-presented & intelligently written 20-page booklet and the 3 disks loaded from the top of the gatefold. Each of the disks has completely different artwork, so you can easily tell them apart. The artwork is all 1976-contemporary, a mix of the original album images and similarly-themed photos of the band taken by Herbert Worthington from the same sessions. Worthington's distinctive stylish images are all in monochrome.<br /><br />What of the music? Well the first disk is the original album, with a mix not noticeably improved (IMHO) from the 1984 release. This disk is `pure', i.e. the album as released in 1977 with the addition only of `Silver Springs'. The second disk is all live-on-stage material from the `1977 Rumours World Tour' and includes songs from the earlier FM album: `Monday morning', `Rhiannon' and `World turning'. This live material is good, but near-identical material has been released before i.e. on the 1980 'Live' album plus a couple of bootlegs of the 1977 tour.<br /><br />The third disk consists of 16 tracks of rejected material from the `Rumours' recording sessions, including some beautiful renditions of `Songbird'. `Keep me there', `Doesn't anything last' and `Planets of the universe' are also featured, often played live on stage by the band but in some cases with no recording released until decades later.<br /><br />So, should you buy it? If you don't have a copy of the album, then this is probably the one to go for. The whole package is very classy, there's a lot of `Rumours-related' material in addition to the original album and one or two surprises. It's not expensive either, considering what you get.<br /><br />However if you're already a FM fan and have all their music from this period, it may only be worth buying if you're a completest. Truth is, though this is a fine package there's little here that's really new.<br /><br />None of this takes away from the fact that this is universally recognised as one of the greatest rock-pop albums of all time, with every single track a gem./>The third disk consists of 16 tracks of rejected material from the `Rumours' recording sessions, including some beautiful renditions of `Songbird'. `Keep me there', `Doesn't anything last' and `Planets of the universe' are also featured, often played live on stage by the band but in some cases with no recording released until decades later.<br /><br />So, should you buy it?

0739384171|3.0|This author needed a better editor.  There were a few times (I listened on CD) that I thought I'd accidentally backed up or put in the wrong disk because it repeated itself frequently --identical descriptions and nearly identical dialogue.  The story was good -- it just should have been a lot shorter.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I am sure I am not telling anyone things new... Gotta love this game. Even the free version is well worth your time.
0061438294|5.0|This was a gift, and the recipient dug in immediately, reading some of the fascinating information from the book.  Wow -- can't wait to read it in it's entirety myself. Meanwhile, my son is raving about it.
B00B2V66VS|1.0|it wont let me open the app and then wen I finally get it it just shuts off. this game gets on my nerves
B008XBCJ34|5.0|If you want to show off your 3D TV, be sure to buy this.  Your friends who get ill on amusement rides may have a problem, because the movie makes fantastic use of open space using the 3D.  To complete your 3D examples, buy Hugo, which uses small spaces in 3D.  These are probably the best contemporary uses of 3D in movies.
B00APUQPX6|5.0|Did't think they crank out another satisfying film in this series.  Pleasantly surprised and definitely a film the whole family will enjoy.
B004MYFUC8|2.0|I have been reading classics, but this did not rate for me.  I read half and stopped.  I found it extremely boring, the descriptions went on and on, and the book was hard to read.
B005Q1W0ZQ|5.0|As a DVD these are excellent. I have season one on regular DVD and this season two on Blu-ray. Both have excellent quality of viewing, and sound is excellent as well. Not much to say about the DVD's themselves.<br />The interesting thing to note here is that if you want the same version of this series as was shown on public television, this is the edition to buy. Only the original U.K. edition is the same.<br />Other than that, buy, play enjoy!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|great for ages 5-10.<br />easy to play<br />keeps attention of any kid<br />no need to buy anything. can win the gems etc
B005RAO0GS|4.0|I love her unique sound and wonderful voice. Some of the songs start to blend together, but still an awesome CD.

0345803507|5.0|i love it but the first book will always be the best :-D its the best love story i've read so far
1401235417|5.0|Just finished volume 1...and it's the best revamp of any comic character(s) I have read since Byrne revamped the X-Men. This series finally shows the Batman and Bruce Wayne as an integrated three dimensional character. You see the turmoil and passion of the man, not just the Batman or his lessor half. I have only seen it done one time before in Miller's Dark Knight.<br /><br />This is not a comic...it is art in it's highest form.I was first introduced to Mr. Snyder with the released of Severed (every comic and horror fan needs to get a copy of that now!) and said that this was one writer to take notice of but this series has convinced now that Scout is the real deal.<br /><br />Now let's touch on the artwork in this amazing volume..Greg Capullo. The definitive Batman Artist? I personally think he's up there with Jim Lee, Neal Adams, Bruce Timm, Brian Bolland. All great artists but Mr. Capullo's take of the character is a pretty definitive interpretation in my book.<br /><br />Overall, I am one Batman fan anxiously awaiting the next volume of this series...Great Stuff!

I downloaded it on my Kindle, and while it has all of the same features (I think), you have to be connected to the internet to use most of it, so It's not as handy unless you're at home or connected to WiFi.  The phone version just uses your data if you're not connected to the internet.  Still, I love it!
B005LAIH2C|5.0|The film \\"Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters\\" centers around the close knit duo of Hansel (played effortlessly by Jeremy Renner) and Gretel (played in an incredible way by Gemma Arterton).  Both Hansel and Gretel are pretty much forced into a life of being witch hunters after they dare to eat from a secluded candy house in the forest.  I enjoyed the fact that Hansel and Gretel were created as characters of a brother and sister who stand by each other through good and challenging times. Hansel and Gretel's character evolutions are indirectly shaped (in different ways) by a discreet white witch named Mina (played in a heartfelt way by Pihla Viitala) and a troll named Edward (played naturally by Derek Mears).  In all fairness, Famke Janssen also played her witch character in a convincing fashion and in a way that also helped strengthen the tight bond that Hansel and Gretel have.  \\"Hansel and Gretel\\" is fine for those who are ok with watching films that mash fantasy and dark comedy in the plots.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Of course, if you loved Season 1, you will like this as well.  It's a little daker given the WW1 backdrop, but it is still full of the drama and intrigue we've come to love, and it finally answers the &#34;will they? won't they?&#34; Matthew/Mary romance questions.
B004TI5N38|5.0|I chose this book since it was the first about John Puller & I hadn't read Baldacci in a while. It holds your interest & is a page turner. Looking forward to reading the next one in the series about this character.
B000HC2LI0|5.0|Best series ever!<br /><br />The box set is really nice, there's a booklet for episodes and another booklet on the series. Very nice file folder type sleeves for the dvds that open up in four panels.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|it is a pretty fun game but you cant get diamonds very easily and that sucks so all in all it is pretty fun
B003UBTX72|5.0|You know how you know a book is good? I read this book in a week. No struggle to get through this one. The struggle is finding another book to go to next that's as good as this.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|It is entertaining but not that fun. Sometimes tedious. Needs more options like naming and picking your own horse. I would like to pick the color as well
B000FC2KL0|3.0|I love the Chili's, but I had to put this book down for a bit. Gets a little slow in the middle somewhere. But like the band I'm back at it.
B005SAJJHM|5.0|What can i say.. Big bang is just a good show. I am going through the seasons to finish 1 through current.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|the best game ever for people who have time and a love for horses so get this game your horse feels real like you own it
B002P79KAC|5.0|Many words that can explain this show. it is well rounded with how i like to be, sarcastic and sarcastic.
B004UUKDNA|5.0|I've purchased a few other albums from other artists in this genre, and this is my favorite.  It's in the CD player in my car all the time!
B009GQ57ES|5.0|Not a huge fan of rap most of the time, but I couldn't get enough of the Thrift Shop music video so I thought I'd give the rest of the album a try and I'm so glad I did. The lyrics are thoughtful and deep, especially the track Same Love. Can't wait to hear more from Macklemore and Ryan Lewis!
B00006I53S|5.0|I order the Canon EF 28-135mm f/3.5-5.6 IS USM Standard Zoom lens for Canon SLR camera as a Christmas gift.  It is working fine for my gift recipients.
B001F6ZIXW|5.0|I was hooked after the very first episode.  A lot of action along with good story lines and character development.
B007EECSFA|4.0|Aside from the fact I had figured out the end from the time &#34;Dorothy&#34; was confronted and killed the mysterous man in first chapter, I kept reading to the end of the book to find out how the author would eventually reveal her true idenity.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|SO WORTH FIVE STARS, ONCE I STARTED I COULDN'T STOP READING IT!  I loved it and can't wait to watch the movie
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Would recomend this book to another man or someone with a strong stomach. Liked all three parts being in one book. My wife and I saw the movie, and she liked the movie, but I think she would have trouble with the detail in the book.
B00846REIS|5.0|I've never finished  a book in two days. I love it more than fifty shades I think. Never thought that was possible
0684824906|5.0|Love history so really enjoyed the insight and challenges Lincoln faced.  The book from Amazon arrived in perfect condition and in two days.  I will be ordering again!
B009AP2G26|5.0|Glee season four is no where close to being as good as the past three seasons. But it's still good if your a glee fan! It is definitely worth buying!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Its asome  its just like the first temple run sceptically it is more addicting and fun like you get to ride in a mine cart if you get far enough.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|I wasn't a big gamer in the 80's but I had an Atari 2600 like everyone else. This book was a quick, easy read. The references to 80s pop culture were enjoyable and nostalgic. I recommend this book for anyone in their 30s and 40s who want to relive their geeky childhood.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this is the best game in the world if you do not have it get it now this is the best thing that ever happened in game history :) :) :)
B002JWD6AS|3.0|This is a teenage werewolf love story. I'm not giving anything away here. A wolf attack survivor, Grace is obsessed with the a wolf she's seen in the woods behind her house, every winter ever since she was attacked. Of course, he turns out to be Sam, a werewolf who has been pining after her. The story is told from shifting perspectives between Sam and Grace.<br /><br />I love the way Stiefvater writes. I can't avoid the play on words: the opening of Shiver is chilling, and it pulls you into the story right away.<br /><br />However, Shiver is a like much-better written Twilight, only with werewolves. By which I mean sure it's fun, but it's not a very deep story. While Grace and Sam are well-developed characters, Shiver wallows a bit on their romance, turning almost a bit sappy at times.<br /><br />Still, it is an enjoyable read, even though I can't rave about it. And there are still a few days left on Amazon's January deal on the ebook for $2.99.<br /><br />In my opinion, Stiefvater's more recent book, Raven Boys, is a much better story.<br />(This review can also be found on the blog: YA Fantastic Book Review)
B0063IH60K|5.0|this is so much easier than sitting on the floor with a deck of cards!!  I Love this game bunches!!
B004DI7HZ6|4.0|I found this book because it's sequel [[ASIN:B006WEZ9TK Shadow of Night: A Novel (All Souls Trilogy)]] was listed as a top 2012 read at GoodReads.com.  Seeing that I needed to read the first---luckily I was able to check it out from the library---I checked it out and sat to read the book.<br /><br />I did not read any reviews prior to reading the book--but here is mine:<br /><br />I did like the story. It was different and held my interest.  Personally, I didn't think the 'fluff' people reference (i.e. the detail in eating, sleeping, etc.) was tedious but this might be due to the fact that I had just finished [[ASIN:B000SEI5CI Forever Odd: An Odd Thomas Novel]] and OMG don't get me started.  Anyway, the story centers around a vampire and a witch that 'find' each other and fall in love.  In this story, intermingling between species is prohibited because (supposedly) non-humans are harder to ignore by humans when they are together.  In all fairness, I did have a \\"OMG don't tell me they sparkle\\" panic attack, and although they don't the attention that mingling creatures incite when together did remind me of Twilight.  I never read those books, only watched the first movie so I can't really say for sure if its a Twilight reference or not.  The item that drew the vampire and witch together is a book that is supposed to be the answer to all: creation, evolution, survival, etc. Which makes it a very wanted item.<br /><br />Others have summarized the story plenty, but I wanted to voice my opinion regarding some of the 'negatives' listed by others:<br />I didn't mind the extra fluff (see above)<br />The fact that they fall in love within 3 weeks....well, I fell in love with my husband within--maybe sooner--that time and we've been married 13 years. But aside from that it is fantasy genre--not non-fiction.<br />The witch is a pet, not strong---while at times I did feel that way, I felt she was more in control than not, and it didn't bother me.<br /><br />The one thing I would change is that it should be listed as a Teen/Young Adult novel.  As others have pointed it is on the prude side--especially taking into account the genre it is.  The only time I really rolled my eyes, which is why I checked to see if it was a Teen/YA, was that while they passionately kissed and held tightly---nothing ever happened UNTIL she realizes that she is 'married' to him.  It is only at that point that he sees her naked---but still no sex.  While I am not one that bought 50 shades, it just seemed that the lack of sex deterred and harmed the love story between the two of them.<br /><br />In the end I would recommend this book--but NOT for the price listed.  Under $10, maybe.  Under $8 definitely.  Check your library.  I am now left hanging because I refuse to spend $14.99 on the sequel kindle book (the hardcover is cheaper!!!)change is that it should be listed as a Teen/Young Adult novel.

B00846REIS|4.0|really loved the book but now I have no choice but to get the next one...would have given it 5 stars if it would have just ended but then that would have been kind of sad too.  good read!!!!
B000YIGNKE|3.0|This version was fair, although I have yet to be satisfied with any of the actresses who've played Anne Elliot [same for Elizabeth Elliot, but the one in this version was at least pretty].  Hawkins just isn't very unattractive and her appearance doesn't change from start to finish, although Austen describes a gradual enhancement of Anne's looks as the story progresses, a return to something more like her former \\"bloom.\\"  The reason that irritates me is that it would be so easy to make happen, with subtle changes in hairstyle and makeup.<br /><br />Overall, I think I like the Amanda Root version better than this one, although I agree with other reviewers' comments about much of the cast in that one looking too old for their parts.  This version does mix up a lot of the conversations, making them out of sequence, or changing who says what, and it doesn't add anything at all to the story.<br /><br />I'm still waiting for just the right movie version of this fabulous story.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|this is probably my kids favorite game and when they found out how to upgrade after Christmas to send Santa back to the North Pole it was like brand new all over again.
B000FUF6QS|4.0|Good flick. I saw it in the 80's for the first time, that movie was a little longer and a touch racier (more nude screens). I hear the English (extended) version is not available in the States, I couldn't get it anyway. Still worth a look to get a snap shot of what (one author believes) Druid religion was like.
B003XCVQ3C|1.0|I wish I could give this piece of crap zero stars. The first one that I purchased lasted 10 months and then the replacement lasted less than 3. I have friends that have had theirs stop working after even one month. Do yourself a favour, buy a Belkin or other type. Moshi adapters do not last.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this game is just like caring for an actual horse. I Ak fifteen and have always wanted a horse. so this is a perfect take for me. this game is soo amazing I would recommend it to anyone. at any poiny
B000W9DSVW|5.0|I love this trilogy. There aren't many movies where so many &#34;cool&#34; actors are all in one place AND they're stealing stuff; talk about living vicariously haha. Ocean's 11 is the best and I believe most people will agree, but as a whole it is a good trilogy to watch to veg out. With movies like this I don't think there is much of any difference between blu-ray and regular DVD.  If I wanted to be a real critic then I guess the color is more vibrant with the blu-ray versions but if you are looking to save a couple bucks while adding to your movie collection, the DVD version is fine.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Great book by John Grisham for all you fans . Book was a kindle and got it instantly great read
B009NPA3Q4|5.0|If you loved Phillip Phillips on Idol, you'll love this CD. Great songs performed in his unique style. Always true to himself.
0894803123|5.0|For either the beginner or the advanced ice cream maker an absolute must have.  Their recipes are really the best.
B0076DELIG|5.0|Very well written and laid out.  Love the character of Bosch and the detailed way the story is laid out as well as his relationship with his daughter!
B00B19DMUE|2.0|Seems horror movies are very predictable. This one is just that. You can spell out the ending after the fist few minutes. The effects are nice with a good sense of design and framing. The writing is very bumbling though. Then again I am not a horror movie fan. Movies like this keep me from ever becoming one.
B009FBX5M0|5.0|Skyfall Soundtrack rocks. Great traveling music. Newman kept true to the tradition. Turn up the volume. Great percussion on the chase scenes.
0788812807|5.0|I bought this tape for our daughter who is collecting the old original Disney kids movies to show her grandchildren.  It arrived in good condition.
B0091V6TF4|4.0|Best Of James Bond 50th Anniversary (2 CD) missed a few of my favorites. I have been buying James Bond Soundtracks since about 1963. This 50 years-50 hits missed a few of my favorite cuts. Louis Armstrong's &#34; All the Time in the Worls&#34; was missing among a few others.
B005WUHAX8|1.0|this is as if it was fake no buttons work mute and unmute busted<br /><br />NOT water proof honestly waist  of money
B009Q6ADG0|5.0|Once again the lawyers and media companies rule the world. The Skyfall soundtrack is incomplete because of the separate packaging of the Adele song. Only $1.88 on Amazon, but another CD to purchase.
B009PK9SB8|3.0|It fit on the back of my Hero 2 silver edition, but it drains the battery quickly and also the touch screen is somewhat insensitive.  Hard to push on the touch screen and get a reaction.
B004LWZW88|5.0|Video and audio of this disc is perfect. The movie itself is also great. It was first to be a direct to video release. Good thing they reconsidered. A must if you like the first two Shrek movies.
014241493X|4.0|Quentin Jacobsen,17, has been in love with his neighbor (Margo Roth Spiegelman) ever since he can remember. THen one mysterious night she drops in through the window for a visit.  Quentin has an amazing night with her pranking people and then the next day she disappears.  Quentin soon realizes Margo has left clues for him to find her. Quentin will soon realize that the Margo he thought was an entirely different person as he goes on a goose chase with his best friends on a mission to find Margo. Paper Towns is a great book for the young adults and girls. If you want to read a mysterious book with romance this is the book for you. The text in the book keeps you reading, it's not boring. This book will keep you glued to it until the very end.  The only weak part in the book is when there driving from time to time but other than that this book is the full package.  If your considering reading this book be prepared for betrayals, mysteries and romance.  If you like action mystery this would not be the right book for you.  Also this would not be the book for you if you are a person who does not like romance.  John Green builds tension throughout the book and keeps the readers hungry for more.  Paper Towns will leave you emotional and thinking until the end.
B000NQRE1E|5.0|I have the special DVD edition which I thought was perfect, now I realize it isn't... THIS is how Titanic should be viewed, unless you're in a theater. Great story, great acting and the dfx are wonderful. A must buy.
B0058YPGL6|5.0|It was in great shape. My daughter was very happy with her purchase. She can't wait for the next season so she can buy that too..
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|Perfect box set, if you don't count IJ 4 which is probably among the worst movies I've ever seen. Highly recommended to all Indy fans out there. Audio and video is awesome as well. And kudos to Spielberg for not digitally tampering with the movies.
076790592X|5.0|This is a great book. I would and have recommended it to all my friends and family.. Very touching and heart warming.. Every medical student should have to read it..
B003Y5H5HY|4.0|Larsson's books are great! The Swedish movies are awesome, for once. This version is even better, mostly due to Daniel Craig and the amazing footage. Lisbeth is better in the Swedish versions. Great audio and video. If you like the book, this is a movie for you. Even if you haven't read the book you may like it.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|The Weather Channel is my very favorite for getting the weather. It seems to be close to  very accurate in reporting.
B0034G4P4Y|4.0|The animation of this movie is nothing short of spectacular. It's Pixar class... The story is good, but could be even better. Let's hope part two incorporates what part one lacks. Amazing sound and video on this.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I like it because it's easy to read and its free.  I am a senior so this means a lot
B003XKPPOU|5.0|How funny isn't it crying when you see animated toys face disaster? I can't explain it, but this movie goes straight to your heart. See it. Flawless audio and video of course, it's Pixar after all.
B004UID2LC|5.0|Ok,I know the reviews are bad but they don't know how to work it.Ok I admit it crashes sometimes but it's still an AWESOME app.LISTEN TO ME GET THE APP NOW IT IS AWESOME I MEAN IT GET IT :)
B00867GHS8|5.0|I haven't seen the 3D version since my TV can't handle 3D. But the 2D disc is nothing less than impressive. A must for anyone who loves Pixar. One of Pixar's top three movies of all time. Audio and video is spotless of course.
B00B19DMUE|4.0|I would purchase this movie at full price, but do reccommend renting it first.  More of a thriller than a &#34;scary movie&#34;
B0053O89KG|5.0|CASTLE IS MY ALL TIME FAV!!!! IT HAS EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO ENJOY ASHOW-  SPUNK, HUMOR, CLASS, SEXY, SOPHISTICATION, AND LOTS OF FUN!!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|The 50 shades trilogy are three very great reads. I flew through them and was done in a week! There were a few of \\"kinky\\" scenes that were a little \\"much\\" but for the most part, I didn't feel that the \\"kinky\\" parts were as \\"bad\\" \\"freaky\\" or as \\"over the top\\" as some people made it sound like it was  going to be.<br />Really, it was just a kinky love story!
B002JVWR4A|5.0|THIS IS STILL A GREAT SERIES WITH LOTS OF HUMOR AND HEART.  EVERYONE NEEDS TO GIVE THIS SHOW A TRY!!!
B009HEJXFS|5.0|This was the best MIB in the series. It kept me on the edge of my seat. Watched it twice in the same day!
B007JM4CWY|5.0|Love this game. Love the challenge. It's a game where people look at you a say really? And then they try it! Then they\\"re hooked.
B00AYDC5HY|5.0|Made me laugh, made me cry twice, said to my friend &#34;I hate this movie&#34; because it made me cry. But the ending was FANTASTIC!!!!
B00AN0KGWE|1.0|I was lead to believe the free content was the Episodes, It was not and I was severely disappointed.<br />Come on amazon. Be accurate with your pricing.
B007BFSYMS|4.0|Sounds were pretty realistic, liked the variety. Granted it's the first one I've tried. It was a good deal too.
B005S9EK1S|5.0|This is such a great love story! I never get tired of watching it! Definitely a chick flick but an excellent movie!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Downton Abbey is the best series on TV. Finally...something worth watching that keeps your attention. This is so worth it!
B0052RE4MQ|5.0|This is a great book in an excellent series! I will definitely read this series more than once! It is so good and hard to put down!
B005XY67WI|5.0|This is an exceptional Shakira concert, She is an extraordinary show-woman, singer and composer. All her song demonstrate her amazing talent. Chorus, musicians, dancers, and technicians deploy their best to make this presentation extraordinary. Technically the DVD is excellent.
B004HO6I4W|5.0|Such a great family movie! Entertaining for both children and adults! One you won't get tired of watching over and over again!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This is a fun app. my daughter showed me this app and said she liked it. so I tried it and it is fun.
B004EPYZV2|5.0|This is such a great movie! A perfect blend of comedy and action, making it entertaining for everyone! I would definitely recommend this to others!
B009OYSFDM|5.0|This a great telling of the Oliver Queen story. This is an entertaining version of the classic story. It is a completely different interpretation of Oliver than the Smallville version. Much closer to the comic.
B003UESJFG|5.0|This is one of our favorite movies at our house! Great entertainment for adults and children alike! I would definitely recommend this movie to everyone! Arrived on time and in excellent condition!
B00AWTTUHI|5.0|I was really impressed with this &#34;movie&#34;. It was movie done in animation not a cartoon.This is a must watch. Loved it!!!!!
B002ZG9774|5.0|This is a great movie with and excellent sound track! Very entertaining and the songs are very catchy! Maybe not for everyone but I love it!
B009IEXKXI|4.0|In some respects, this was one of the most boring books I have ever read.  The book is filled with detailed passages describing the various life support systems and how they work.  At times, the descriptions get very tedious.  However, the detailed descriptions provide a level of reality and suspense that is very effective. Furthermore, the atmosphere generated by the writing style and substance of the book creates a sense of time passing slowly, which is just what I imagine it would feel like to be stranded on Mars.
B008PWUYVA|5.0|Sturdier and thicker than some other jackets I have seen.  Room for the stylus in the center,  easily wipes clean.
B003RV43X4|5.0|I've loved Harry's movies since I was a kid.  These remakes take me right back to my childhood. Sam did this role justice.  Non stop action and spectacle all the way through.
B0017SWPXY|4.0|Great read for all dog lovers! Brings big smiles to your face and hits home for those special furry friends in your life.
B00005JKDR|5.0|It seems Pixar can do no wrong.  I watch Monsters Inc. with my son and wife all the time.  I love how they made a story about the power of scream & Laugh so exciting.
B004ZQBP3Q|1.0|I bought this for the song Sexy and I know it. I hoped the rest of the CD would be just as good. I should have just bought the single.
B0058YPILY|5.0|As always, the story lines are incredibly diverse and unbelievably creative!  Rather vastly topics, but well done! And the character interactions are equally complex and interesting!
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|First time I have read this author.  Cracking story, lots of twist and turns. Kept my interest all the time.<br />Highly recommend and looking forward to reading his next book.
B001DJLCRC|3.0|Given an options to take care of his money problem by support from a friend, the choice to continue to make ice for profit to take care of his financial problems, at the cost of destroying many young people's lives and supporting gangsters is just too amoral for me to continue watching!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|When I saw that it was out, I couldn't wait to d/l it, and surprised it was still free to download! Still as addictive as the first one :)
0765325950|5.0|Thank you Brandon Sanderson for doing the impossible and tying up most of the loose ends in this series. This book knows how to pull at heart strings. You will go from scenes that make you laugh out loud to scenes of heartbreak. It was an epic ending to an epic series.
0446554995|5.0|I love Pendergast, but I thought this was to be a trilogy and the way it ended I am sure there has to be another book.  Am looking forward to it.
B00AL1ONN8|5.0|This album is great. I love T.I. and this album is a great way to showcase his talent. Go buy it!
B008AK8FHM|3.0|I found the book a little hard to understand. The author, being a doctor, uses a lot of &#34;big&#34; words. I found myself looking up a lot of these words to find their meaning. This broke my concentration and focus on the content and made it tough to follow.<br />I do not need proof that heaven exists but I did find his story to be very comforting and up lifting.
B009YU62H2|5.0|Soundgarden is back finally! This albumb couldnt' be any better. I was really glad they didn't peter out on this album.
B0099G7KDQ|5.0|Love this group and this album is definitely great. I was hoping to fall in love with it like I did with &#34;Sigh No More&#34;, but their previous album, in my opinion, is definitely better. I still think &#34;Babel&#34; is worth purchasing though!
B00AHXIC50|5.0|I was really aprehensive about purchasing this album with the thought of it not being as good as the first one on my mind. He delivered though it's just as good as the first one.
B00AJRQLTI|5.0|This album is incredible. So powerful! A must see movie too! Anne Hathaway's voice is to die for and Hugh Jackman is ridiculously good. Wish Amanda Seyfried was featured more in the soundtrack.
B009FOBMBI|5.0|This album is great. Too bad this is the last one with Adam G. I really hope they continue to fine the success they did with him.
B0002YCVXI|5.0|Lovely melodies, beautifully played , a treat to listen to. I highly recommend it for any time of day .
B008ENA74E|3.0|Should have been entitled: Greg Smith, Why You Should Hire Me Now.  Spent more time glorifying his credentials,contacts and importance than giving specifics on why he left GS.
B003UYUP58|5.0|A tome of information about the greatest feared disease; makes for an appreciation that one must not let this disease be managed by the doctor alone!
B0049U4NQO|5.0|Very good finish to the series. Up-tempo and best book of series.Great must read book for everyone over ten. Love it!!!!!
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|first off, let me start by addressing (or commenting) on the people dissing the actors, their singing abilities, etc.<br />the singing/the songs, AS written originally for the play, if you think about it, is NOT supposed to be about who can sing the best, how pretty can they make the song.<br />that is the last consideration really. if you want HONESTY in your films (or even stage) musicals that is, and that is what THIS \\"les miserables\\" is about. for starters, they are singing LIVE, take after take after take, WHILE they are acting, and the acting takes precedence, in my opinion anyway. the story, the characters, what they make you FEEL, is a million times more important than \\"oh i don't know if they sang that song to perfection\\". gimme a break you naysayers. yes, films are about escapism, and suspending not only your disbelief, but your reality as well, though this film is STEEPED in reality....that reality being the human condition, which we ALL can (or should) be able to relate to.<br />so instead of having gone into the studio months and months prior to filming, before the actors even ACTED the roles, they have to then decide and TOTALLY commit to how they are going to perform the role and are stuck to it regardless of what happens, because they laid it down in the studio, so the die is cast.<br />would YOU want to do that as an actor? make all of your acting choices before you even got on the set? before you even became the role? before you even interacted (and acted) w/your fellow actors?<br />people are too used to the \\"perfect\\", prettied up musicals. i myself have always loved musicals, the great ones, that is, but i always did find it cheesy that there was perfect playback that they were lip synching along too and how they are walking down the street and suddenly break into song and everyone else joins in and happens to know the song and the dance routine. c'mon, that IS cheesy, and totally unrealistic. maybe i prefer realism more than most. so while i overlooked that w/my much beloved musicals, i still always struck a false note (no pun) w/me. \\"Chicago\\" did a great job (the film), because the director came up with a way for it NOT to be cheesy, he made it imaginations of Roxy Hart and that brought up the level of \\"Chicago\\"'s greatness even higher.<br />Also people have mentioned the quality of the actors singing voices. They ALL (w/the exception of Russell Crowe in my opinion), have AMAZING voices, and as a singer and musician myself, I know what I speak of. Russell's is passable and that's about it in my opinion, but Anne, Hugh, Eddie, Samantha, Amanda all have fantastic, amazing voices, especially Sam, Anne, Eddie and Amanda, they could be professional singers in a hot second if they so desired.<br />Okay enough about the naysayers and the disappointed. Les Miserables is a BEAUTIFUL, sad, moving, amazing, hopeful, cinematically (ok amazon, i'm spelling it correctly, not sure why the underlining) stunning and beautifully produced film, bottom line, no bones about it. Tom Hooper took on a close to impossible task in his undertaking of this much loved, MUCH seen story.<br />It is also considered to be THE best musical EVER written!! ever!! Based on Victor Hugo's book of course....<br />oh shoot, I have to run, so I guess that's the end of my review. The point is, \\"Les Miserables\\" is incredible and I highly recommend it! :)
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Nothing to say.  Simply trying to delete the review my son posted using my kindle.  He claims the product is awesome.  He will not be posting any more reviews.
0060531053|4.0|This book is a most read if you want to start in the home brewing field! I give it only 4 stars because it has a lot of receipts in the book ,about 1/3 of the book!
0345803507|2.0|I don't understand why a poorly written smut series gains national attention.  There are much better series out there that match this genre.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|The book kept my interest as did the first book in the triology.  I can hardly wait for the third book to be released.
0440237688|4.0|This is a really good story that is required reading for my son.  Short but really touching story.  Well worth the read.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|This series is awsome. My heart doesn't stop pounding and I can't put the book down. I also watch the series on TV but the book is so much better. Loved it!
141659521X|5.0|A great lead in to the rest of the series.  I have read the whole series and this is one of the best.
B008L40Q7E|4.0|The writing was very good. Different from the movie. Overall quite enjoyable. I have to write four more (extra) words.
B009HV2JT8|1.0|Read the book, this movie was awful and did nothing to help the book.  The book was outstanding but the movie was hidious.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This is a great game.  It is so addicting!  I think it is so much better than the first temple run.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|Thin, light and protective.  Holds the device securely and overall a very good case.  Would not recommend if you are rough on your device.
B003V5CFV8|4.0|I gave this 4 stars for how funny it is, and how the story plays out. It's not my favorite movie, but I'd definitely watch it again.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Another great addition to the series.  Absolutely no problems with this order.  Quick, reasonable, and well priced.  Exactly what I have come to expect.
B00015YVDG|4.0|Either Sinise's character is one of these obsessive-compulsive, ultraconservative tight wads as far as wasting money and/or wasting financial opportunities, he is a narcissistic and prideful maniac, he is as stubborn as a dog without the desire to eat, and/or he is one of the dumbest criminal masterminds to ever call himself an officer. Either way, average criminals would have seriously considered dumping the kid(releasing or killing him) after their partner was shot and killed by policemen. After this, he knew police were involved and that Gibson didn't follow orders. But to still be holding the kid after the bounty by Gibson(which should have been more to begin with--considering he owned an airline, cheapskate) was absolutely insane! Instead of collecting a seriously compartmentalized two million, the thug henchmen could have cut out the mastermind's share altogether or one of them could have gotten paid a mastermind's salary for thug work. The thing is that the thugs should have seen this as a sinking ship(when the ransom became a bounty) enough to go collect NOW and not let Sinise get wind of the fact that they wanted to do so. For one thing, Sinise was sure to get suspicious then paranoid that one or all of them was going to collect(he did when he shot and killed them). One of the thugs lost his brother in the heist and not receiving anything for something that he could never get back should have sounded too good to pass up. What if Sinise decided--as he later did, when the bounty doubled--to go it alone?! With the scenarios that I presented, Sinise should have decided to cut his losses and run to another job and, when he did not, the thugs should have took this as a warning and collected for themselves without letting him know how they were feeling. The bounty and then increasing bounty meant that they could no longer trust one another(situation had gotten critically hot). Ultimately, the ball was in Sinise's court, he could decide to cut his losses and run and, with revenge and anger for non-payment, Gibson was not going to see his child alive again. Any other decision by Sinise(either as a result of the thugs turning on him or him turning on them and collecting everything for himself), then Gibson's child lives. Once the partner got killed, Gibson had no other options open to him(either he was going to pay fruitlessly or he was going to offer up a bounty and have a 66 2/3%(2 out of 3) chance that his kid lives. Gibson's idea would not have been a good one, if things did not go so tragically wrong. However, he had no other choice at this point. I won't spoil the ending. This movie gets 4 out of 5 stars--not bc it wasn't an alltime great watchable movie, it is that--but it's only real limitation was how Gibson was playing chess and how all of the criminals were playing checkers. Gibson--even with the bounty--did not control his own destiny, but the criminals did. If Sinise decided that it was over, it was! He was the mastermind and there was eventually insurrection, but--not bc they were soft on the kid--only to end it! Ransom would get 5 stars, if the criminals were average. They were colder than usual for the most part, but they weren't written to have average overall intellect. Sinise's character showed flashes of it, but when it really mattered it was missing!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This game is fun but you should be able to earn gems easier, rather than just when you advance a level.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|i liked all the twists and turns in the plot. it's a great book if you like a lot of action.  it's hard to put down.  you just want to keep reading till is finished.  lee child is a great author.
B009AVC922|5.0|This was the first Ninja Scroll and it is fantastic, however the succeeding ones really aren't that good. But you will thoroughly enjoy this if you like anime. One warning-not suitable for kids.
B00973902K|5.0|My son purchased this and said that he was not that familiar with Carly Rae Jepsen.  He said that it is very enjoyable to listen to and recommends it to any one who is a fan of her.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|While you know the main characters will be safe at the end of the day, you are kept in suspense s to how the fate of the remaining characters will develop. Plus this is a very fast read.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|I Love these items. Thier items are timely on arrival. I really love having the such a wide variety of items to select from.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I tottaly reccomend this app. it is great but u may have to wait a while to play it. but its worth a wait this is great for all ages
1401923127|5.0|I'm still readin git but find it very informative.  A little more science than I need but still would reccomend it.
B007YA5NRO|4.0|Great book for X10 newbies, helped me alot! Wished there would have been more suggested settings and discussion of each
0345803507|5.0|I fell in love with this series by the first chapter. I was hooked. Nothing like an erotic love story to keep your heart racing.
B006K3796E|5.0|extremely challenging, so have patience! will take you hours and hours to complete.  I've put in about 6 and i've gotten to 51.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I love Wonder and I'm ten years old. The reason I decided to read Wonder  is because I'm reading it in my 5th grade class. I love the book so I bought it on my kindle.
B009IRVSVQ|4.0|I needed some new cd's for a few long car rides we were taking in January.  This helped pass the time.
B0074VTHKM|5.0|I have read all of John Grishams books that are publicized from day 1 but never knew some of these lesser books existed.  I really am into Theodore Boone and am now on the second book.  I have the third one downloaded also to read when I am through with #2
0316069884|4.0|No longer are families running farms that provide healthy, natural, nourishing meat. Instead, huge factories are pumping out mutated meat that has been genetically altered and manipulated so much that the animal's anatomies themselves are changing.<br /><br />After more than three years of research, Jonathan Foer gives an in-depth look at factory farming and how it is effecting the entire world today. Foer takes a surprisingly objective view on everything and does no preaching about being or becoming a vegetarian. Instead he simply shows you the horrifying world of factory farming then let's you decide for yourself.<br /><br />There are some complex implications that come from factory farming and after reading this book, I now know the consequences that come from eating meat on a daily basis. Environmentally, morally, and for the overall health of people, eating animals at the rate most people eat them simply doesn't make since anymore, and if there is any doubt in your mind as to whether it is right or wrong, read this book and get the facts that you think you are aware of, and then decide.<br /><br />At a time when the world seems to be unraveling, one of the most simple, and unselfish of things that can be done to better the world is to become a vegetarian. It's basic and easy once you start and after a lifetime of living you won't be responsible for so many evil things. Simple put down the steak, pick up the potato, and go pet all the little cows and pigs whose lives you are saving.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Love the app so far had not had any problems with it. Easy to update and share thing's with my friends
B000SEGUDE|3.0|Tough story to follow but worth the struggle.  Found I had to skip some parts so I wouldn't drop the whole book.  If you're looking for an odd but fascinating story and can handle a difficult read, this is for you.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Absolutely an amazing book. I could not set it down I would recommend to everyone. I can't wait to start the next one!!!
B00908DDZM|5.0|If you haven't already been following the exploits of Macklemore & Ryan Lewis, The Heist will be the best musical discovery you make for a while.  At times irreverent, somber, and playful, the album runs the gamut of what a listener might need emotionally and philosophically from their playlist, while consistently remaining blatantly honest and enthusiastic throughout.  This is a skillfully executed and refreshingly earnest project that is the product of gentlemen who are embracing sound, speech, and life in all forms to bring you something fabulously relatable.  You need to get down on this love.
B00AREIAI8|2.0|Not very self explanatory...hard to navigate thru...you can earn coins or points but don't really explains how or how/what to use them for...jumped around alot ....  not impressed.  Bought it for my grand daughter who is quite tablet game orienated.....she couldn't even really figure it out.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|The most fun I've ever had playing a video game. The new graphics are awesome! This is the best sequel ever!
B005OSUKSA|5.0|loved it, love him!  I was glad for the all classical CD.  It something I've wanted,<br />and it delivered. Thanks David Garrett!!
B008673ZAQ|4.0|Can't wait to read Entwined in You.  It's alot like Fifty Shades of Grey!  One of those buts you just want to keep reading to find out what's going to happen next.
B005DMNS4A|5.0|The Who, my personal favorite band, in one of their greatest albums. Roger Daltrey and Pete Townshend are currently touring this album (as of Jan. 2013) and I highly suggest seeing it! But there's nothing like listening to the talents of Moon and Entwistle, who are unfortunately no longer with us. This album is a perfect example of why everyone should listen to The Who!<br /><br />&#34;Is it me, for a moment?&#34;
B009EEGJQW|5.0|One of my favorite Christmas movies.  This updated version is top notch! . . . . . . . .
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I really enjoyed the original game. This new version has  more features, more objectives, and more fun. I think it is better than the first one.
B00AE2I4WK|5.0|Loved this one as I did the others.  THey have definitely stepped it up a notch from the last one.
B0055B7IPE|5.0|Even though this is an animated movie, the storyline definitely had themes that anyone can relate to. Cried and laughed throughout the movie!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I've been using Evernote off and on for years, probably since it first came out. Only this year, with all my mobile devices and going back to college, have I really come to appreciate the program and all its add-ons. I love it! I'll probably pay for the premium version soon.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I am counting the days until the next season comes out.  The Walking Dead is the most addicting show I've ever seen.
B00846REIS|5.0|I thought that this series was better than fifty shades of grey. Probably because the sex wasn't so far fetched and ridiculous. Loved the ending too!
B009POCG2C|5.0|Clint hits it out of the park again.......I thoroughly enjoyed this film and look forward to his next..Nuff said...Just about as good as Grand Torino....
B007IXWL2C|4.0|The book series goes from far fetched and ridiculous to calm and normal. This book was easier to get through than the first (writing ability wise). Series is great overall.
B005G02RIC|5.0|This is by far the greatest Tosca I have ever had the pleasure of seeing.  I've seen Tosca at the City Opera (long time ago) and at the Met several times, and on a few dvds, not enough to say for sure that this is the best dvd of it out there.  The production is passionate and beautiful with fabulous sound.  It is set in the Arena di Verona outdoors with an interesting set.<br />Ruggero Raimondi is the GREATEST Scarpia.  Marcelo Alvarez is GREAT as Mario.  Fiorenza Cedolins is GREAT as Tosca.<br />I have another dvd of Tosca from the Opernhaus Zurich:  Emily Magee, Jonas Kaufmann, and Thomas Hampson.  It can't compare.  The staging is horrible, for one thing.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Writing leaves something to be desired in this one. The first several chapters read like the author was trying to hard to create the type of series she ended up creating; just too eager. You can see the change in writing style from first to third, series as a whole works well. Read all three in 5 days; I honestly couldn't get though work and the gym fast enough to get home and read.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Definitely creative, twisted and keeps you on the edge of your seat. Awesome story line and cast. Jessica Lange is fantastic yet again!!!
B007IXWKUK|4.0|Probably the best of the three books, but then again, I couldn't put any of them down. Wild, crazy, no-one-actually-has-this-kind-of-sex tones down a bit in this one, it's refreshing.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I was home sick last week and needed somthing to watch.. Heard this was a great show so I decided to watch.  The beginning was a little slow, referring to season 1, but as I watched each episode, I fell in love with all the characters.. what a time to live in.. such class.  Downton Abbey is a MUST SEE it’s fabulous. After I finished watching season 1, 2, and what was available for season 3, I started another show that won awards and was said to be good.  OMG after watching such a classy series, then watching this OTHER SHOW, I had to turn it off… I wanted, needed more of Downton Abbey so I started the series all over again.. Glad I did.. I so enjoyed all the costumes, and caught things that I missed… LOVE THIS SHOW!
B0083H6AQA|2.0|...it was sadly disappointing.  You keep hoping that the character played by Robert Pattinson would grow a bit.  Or at least that Pattinson would actually show some acting other than his normal wooden style.  The period costume is very nice and helps you keep interest in the movie until the futile end.  The female actors did a wonderful job in their roles.  The movie itself had great potential to be well done, however, the fact that Pattinson's acting was so poor removes any chance of this movie being labeled as \\"good\\".
B002MQYOFW|5.0|At first I wasn't to pleased with the book but as time went on I found myself wanting more...Good job
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Just love Kindle App it allows me to read books I couldn't afford, and read off my computer and tablet
