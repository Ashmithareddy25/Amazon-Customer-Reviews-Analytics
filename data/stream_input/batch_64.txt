B000001GPX|5|Beethoven's Fifth is music so familiar that many of us don't really hear it anymore.  After the historic eight notes, we more or less of fill in the rest.  But Kleiber and the Vienna Philharmonic have rendered magic here,  making it fresh and new and compelling.  And the interpretation of the  seventh is simply spectacular.

0345803485|1|I do not understand why this book if so popular.The sex scenes are fun at first, especially if you've never read anything like that. But even that part gets bad very quickly. I'll spare the details in this review about that as it has already been said in multiple other reviews.<br /><br />What bugs me the most is Christian Grey as the romantic hero. He's crazy hot. He's only 26 and a self made billionaire, he flies, apparently is a sex god, is supposedly really smart, a pianist, fluent in French, and probably a dozen other \\"dreamy\\" things.... but he's a jerk. A big fat jealous, controlling, possesive jerk. I feel bad for his early life and how much it sucked, sure. But that doesn't excuse his current behavior. The main character, Ana, references his stalking tendencies multiple times...that is NOT cute or romantic! He creates files on all his girls, looks up their social security numbers, spies on Ana, and all other crazy things. And he is controlling to the point of where I would consider him emotionally abusive. She has to ask his permission to do things? When she \\"disobeys\\" him, she ends up apologizing to him for upsetting him, she's constantly walking on egg shells around him trying not to upset his temper...gah! How on earth are other girls swooning over this crap?

0061186473|4|In this collection, we have a variety of short stories that go from funny, to creepy, to fascinatingly clever. Although M is for Magic is aimed at the YA audience I guarantee these stories are great for any adult to enjoy.<br /><br />Here's an overview of the stories:<br /><br />The Case of the Four and Twenty Blackbirds<br />Little Jack Horner is hired to solve the mystery behind the death of Humpty Dumpty. - I personally loved this one. Detective stories always [...] in.<br /><br />The Troll Bridge<br />Hands down this is my favorite of the bunch. Upon a stroll through the forest, a young boy encounters a troll under a bridge who wants to eat his life.<br /><br />Don't Ask Jack<br />A very short and creepy tale of an old Jack-in-the-Box.<br /><br />How to Sell the Ponti Bridge<br />Not one of my favorites but still a great crime story.<br /><br />October in the Chair<br />Also one of my favorites. The months of the year hold a gathering to tell their stories.<br /><br />Chivalry<br />Fine... this one is also a favorite. When an old lady finds the Holy Grail at her local thrift store a dashing stranger on a magnificent horse comes a knockin'.<br /><br />The Price<br />Quite creepy really... this is the tale of stray black cat that fights the devil every night to protect the family that took him in.<br /><br />How to Talk to Girls at Parties<br />ehhh... Didn't do much for me. But nonetheless, it was still worthy. Two boys walk into a party where they realize the kids aren't everyday average teens.<br /><br />Sunbird<br />A gathering of Epicureans who have become bored having tasted everything there is to taste. They are enticed into seeking the legendary Sunbird of Suntown... for a taste that is to be richer than peacock and lusher than duck.<br /><br />The Witch's Headstone<br />This is an excerpt from The Graveyard Book. It tells a story of Bod getting into trouble outside the graveyard while trying to help the ghost of a witch.<br /><br />There's always something great about short stories; the satisfaction of being able to read something as a \\"whole\\" in a few hours. Yet, as always with short stories, I always want more.<br /><br />Mr. Gaiman does not disappoint with this collection. This was quite an enjoyable read no matter what the age.th short stories, I always want more.    Mr. Gaiman does not disappoint with this collection.

B00JBGWP3Y|4|For those who haven't watched the film at cinema halls, the experience will be different but the dvd is worth buying.<br />I don't watch too many films but was tempted by this one. It begins with a Heavy Metal palm muting soundtrack. Great. Sounds a bit like the intro of Grip Inc's \\"Ostracized\\" intro.<br />Then the scene is set. Loneliness, desert landscapes, outcasts, voluntary ostracicism. Noah and his family are the rare righteous amongst the other humans whom they shun for their corrupt ways. Ways which consist of consuming flesh of animals and cruelty. Thus this film is pro-veganism.<br />Since the film is based on the history in Genesis, I leave you to follow it on your own, but some extra-biblic elements are present. The fallen angels are represented as  monsters of stone similar to the guy in the Fantastic Four.<br />The effects are really great.<br />After watching this, I felt like becoming vegan.

B004FGMDOQ|4|I enjoyed the story and meeting the characters in this book. I have begun reading the sequel and it is as good or better than the first.
B00005OWEG|5|Apocalypse Now has long been one of my favorite ten films. I found Apocalypse Now Redux to be an excellent reintroduction to a film that I have not seen in over 20 years.  <br /> <br />The story is the classic story of Ulysses and his sailors encountering adventure after adventure; yet these deadly dark adventures reveal the nature of warfare and the return to a killer instinct to survive under such conditions. <br /> <br />The story is based on Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness and as the film explores the mind of Captain Willard, the mind of Colonel Kurtz, and the aboriginal world they eventually inhabit the meaning of 'heart of darkness' becomes all too clear. <br /> <br />Whereas the case against Col. Kurtz is presented as a man gone insane who has lost all respect for societal authority, we learn that he gradually became a warrior in the classic sense and grew beyond the control of a Pentagon system of career generals.  <br /> <br />The most telling lines in the film is the description Kurtz gives of the mission to give polio vaccine to a village of South Vietnamese sympathizers. As soon as the children are innoculated and the army leaves, the Viet Cong enter the village and cut off the little arms of the children. Kurtz says: \\"What genius!\\" Kurtz had come to believe that in a war to defeat the enemy that every effort should be made to achieve that goal and that the chain of command above him in Viet Nam did not have the mindset to achieve a victory with these methods. Because the Vietnamese were willing to employ such ruthless methods, Kurtz knew that it was only a matter of time before the United States would be defeated. The image or parable of the leaderless soldiers is played over and over in the film, where Willard can never seem to find the commanding officer at one hell hole after another. <br /> <br />Multiple aspects of the insanity of war are shown. One story within the story is that of Clean, the 17 year old Black youth from the Bronx. He overreactsin a terrible scene where he kills a group of Vietnamese boat merchants in an act of homocidal panic. Later he is killed while his mother's sweet voice is heard on a tape recorder sending him a message not to get hurt. <br /> <br />Lance the California surfer gradually mentally deteriorates until he is ready to move into the jungle with Kurtz's tribe.  <br />Chief from Louisiana has maturity and common sense and it is symbolic that he has his head cut off.  <br /> <br />The scene at the French rubber plantation is highly criticized but yet gives one of the most accurate descriptions of the way the United States inherited a needless catastrophy in IndoChina. Toward the end of World War II in Europe, Roosevelt was very insistent that both France and Great Britian give up their empires in Africa and Asia. After all, the United States helped them defeat Nazism, not support them in anti-democratic empire maintenance. DeGaulle flatly refused to join NATO unless he was able to keep Vietnam. When Ho Chi Minh, an expert on the United States Constitution, ask Secretary Dulles for help driving out the French so that the Vietnames could have freedom and democracy, the Secretary of State sided with the French to maintain a balance of power in Europe becuase of fear of Stalin. We paid dearly for this miscalculation as the Vietnames then courted the Chinese, their traditional enemy. This series of events is discussed tangentially at the French family's dinner table. Read Henry Kissinger's chapter on the French in Indochina in his book: \\"On Diplomacy\\", and the conversation at the dinnertable all makes perfect sense. <br /> <br />Yet, it is not the historic that is the powerful engine of this machine. It is the dark journey of Willard into and out of the dark jungle of humanities most base instincts. The original Heart of Darkness is about an officer gone \\"insane\\" in the Belgium Congo, which is a reminder to us the viewer that this is not really about Vietnam, this is about man thekiller and society's methods of dealing with those of us that cross that line. <br /> <br />
B00W6XM002|5|I love th ok s game it is my favorite of fall
B00BESCJII|1|Angsty teenage drama. Complete waste of time and money.  Deals with the uplifting topics of suicide, drug abuse, teenage drinking and nervous breakdowns. Watched with my teenage daughter. Hours of my life I'll never get back. Don't let the casting of Emma Watson lead you to believe its a good movie.
1423113497|5|When I was in school I hated mythology, who new my 4th grade son would find it so exciting!?! He's just read the last one in the series so I'm wondering if the Roman gods are going to be next. It's so hard to find good books for smart kids and this series fit the bill perfectly.
B008JFUO36|1|Instead I received The Bourne Legacy!  Can't rate what I didn't receive.  This was a gift and as it turns out my brother would like to keep it but now I am afraid to re-order for fear of getting another wrong product.
B00E8KLWB4|4|I really like this app a lot. It keeps you really entertained, and your mind is going a  mile a minute. I only wish the game was explained more. Some of the things you need to advance aren't explained very well.
B000YMBBH0|5|I bought this before Christmas for $50. At that price its like a \\"Buy 2 Get 1 Free Offer.\\" All 3 are great movies. Usually when it comes to sequals, or trilogy's, the movies seem to trail off after the first one. In my opinion, each one of these gets better and better.     One other thing, this set got a few 1's from buyers that bought this and don't have a HD DVD player. If you don't have a HD DVD Player don't buy this, it won't play. If you are buying a HD DVD player for your HD set,or have one already, this trilogy is a great way to start. All 3 movies get top marks for HD Video Quality & Sound
B008Y7B3NY|5|Loved this movie!
0316204366|4|This was any easy read and made a lot of sense.  Enjoyed the story telling. Made you start challenging paradigms.
B004FGMDOQ|4|I absolutely LOVE the title, Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children.  Jacob grew up listening to his grandfather's tales of his own childhood in the orphanage and the children he grew up with.  He had pictures of them and would take them out occasionally to show his young grandson.  What strange people they were.  Then Jacob grew up and didn't believe his grandfather's tales any longer.  Of course, his grandfather was hurt but still insisted that his stories were true. It was only after his tragic and horrifying death that Jacob witnessed did he believe him.  However, believing him landed him in a psychiatrist office and ultimately to search for the orphanage where his grandfather grew up.<br /><br />It was a wonderful, suspenseful, paranormal story and I loved it.  Unfortunately, the plentiful pictures don't show up well on a tablet.  My husband liked it so much that I believe he will be reading Book 2.
B0092MKFIY|5|I normally stick to bands I know (ie: the top 40) but I decided to give this a chance. Really glad I did because they have a great sound.
B004VMUS9G|1|have not figured out how to use it yet...tried several different ways to set it up but good thing I have a back up alarm on my phone
B00DF0POXA|5|I give this album 5 stars. It certainly has a different sound to it and it is far from the status quo. Its prob not the type of album you'll listen to the first time and think, &#34; instant classic.&#34; I think this is because the sound is so different. There certainly are a few tracks that when herd the first time are infectious and will grab your attention. After a few listens you will (maybe just my opinion) gain an appreciation for Ye' lyrical word play, organization/arrangement of songs, creative beat selection , and at times the message. My favorite, and probably the most infectious song, is &#34;Blood on the Leaves&#34;. I am in my mid 20's, but a huge fan of jazz, funk, and old school R&B and hip hop. The Nina Simone sample of &#34;Strange Fruit &#34; (originally by Billie Holliday I believe) is fantastic. One, 'Strange Fruit&#34; is a deep and painful metaphor describing the aftermath of the brutal practice of a lynching. A common reality at the time. It (for some) will force listeners not already familiar with the original song to do their homework and possibly find a new appreciation for the genius of the Artists of yesterday. Ye's rendition takes the song in a different direction leaving up to the listener's imagination to tie the sample and Ye's lyrics together and figure out the message he's trying to convey. Solid album, different, and will be counted as one of Ye's greats.
B007IXWL2C|3|In all, the three books were good. But it seems Ana is somewhat narcissistic and so is Christian.<br /><br />In book one, the sex was erotic.<br /><br />By the end of book two, you become desensitized to all the sex.<br /><br />In book three, the fiarytale end was flat. It seems Christian will end up getting his way after all Ana did to declare her boundaries. And face it, Christian has real damage and real issues.<br /><br />The story is fiction.  Like how many of us end up with billionaires.
B00I3ULVLQ|4|Fits phone well.<br />One drop survived so far!
B003F3FJQO|3|Very much like the first book, but left me wanting to read the next one.  Hoping the next one clears everything up and makes it worth it.
B000HL2J0G|3|Great show for the whole family to watch. Clean and entertaining.  It teaches good moral lessons along the way for the kids.
B0085PFG1U|4|This app is an excellent app. I use this for my geometry homework instead of going to the store to buy a graphic calculator. I give this a 9.
B000P0J0A6|5|Just had to buy this when I seen it was available. One of my favorite films and just had to share it with my teenage daughter.
B002I6251G|2|The past two albums from Editors have consisted of well crafted, thought provoking songs.  Unique guitar riffs combined with Tom Smith's dark voice have made for a very intriguing atmosphere of sound.    This album isn't a far cry from the first two albums style wise.  The downfall of this album isn't so much the electronic synthesizers, which work fairly well for the most part, but the song writing.  Songs feel as if they were hastily written, without much thought or effort.  I would even go so far as to call some lyrics callow.  The songs seemed to be burdened with over-repetition to compensate for a lack of quality song writing.    So forget the Interpol comparisons, Julian Plenti would have not let an album like this escape the studio.
B009NY43NY|3|I have loved reading the Dead series and will really miss Sookie.  She was a great read.  That said, this was not one of Ms. Harris's better books.  It was clear throughout the story that it was written not from any desire to explore Sookie's world, but from the greater desire to never have to go there again. Ms. Harris is done with these characters and it showed.  The character conclusions were uninspired, occasionally forced and often unsatisfying.<br /><br />If you've followed the series from the beginning you'll definitely want to read this book. If you've never read the series, please don't make this book your first experience with it.

B00H71PBQ8|5|An excellent show.
B00MNYTWMI|4|I  think it's a lot of back in forth in the game to get supplies..but other than that great game
B00821OX98|5|loved it
B004X6PRO6|4|I honestly don't know how I would describe this book to someone. Having read a number of books about North Korea, the first half of the book seemed just like an interesting story of a pretty normal life. The second part of the book took a huge disturbing turn toward a direction that was confusing and didn't make a lot of sense to me. In the end, I just felt sad.
B00GMOR7LS|4|This was a very interesting movie in that the writers tied the two movies together in a masterful way. Some of the random occurrences in Insidious 1 were cleared up in this installment. However, there were some parts that didn't make sense and seemed obtuse to me. Maybe those parts will be explained in the third installment.
B00992CF6W|1|Whenever I go to my lava cave to get my diamonds or to build a path to the other side it will take me to the home screen of minecraft
B006ID6NDQ|5|Kept me engaged, a different sort of story about the Holocaust than I had ever read. To live in anxiety every day for several years is unthinkable. Very resourceful woman. The writing was clear and readable, not convoluted or overly emotional. I also think this would be a good young adult's book, everyday life for some Germans during the War, also after the War in communist-occupied Brandenburg, and the need to escape from that.
B001SGEUNI|5|Hello, Halestorm This is the hottest group around I love this band and can't wait for their next album comming out this year. Lizzy is awsome singer and performer I just love her, I saw them at the Mohegan Sun they were GREAT !!!! KICK ASS band. Keep Rocking !!!!
B00J8CG6KE|3|Love 2/3 of this film, the other 1/3 not so much...<br /><br />It goes on Forever!... Lots of over the top, over blown, over acted scenes....tons of f-words, and flipping of the bird...sex and LOTs of drugs, while some was definitely important to the overall story line, a lot of it could easily have been shortened or eliminated completely. I am certainly no prude but a lot of the stuff was just unnecessary.  Maybe that is what it takes to have box office success these days.<br /><br />There is actually a great story being told, but it appeared to me that Scorsese was more interested in letting his actors &#34;show their chops&#34; and beat a scene into the ground than really making a great film.  It is like every actor was guaranteed x number of minutes on screen, no matter how useless those minutes might be, and was allowed to go unrestrained to give &#34;the performance or their lives&#34;...<br /><br />For me the most impressive performances were actually those of Matthew McConaughey and Margo Robby.  Not only is Robby spectacular looking, I thought she was great in the roll and I look forward to seeing her in future movies.<br /><br />All in all I think this movie could have been so much better...
B007SYWFRM|4|I enjoy playing this game and so does my daughter...fun for all ages
B008LFY6NI|3|This is an alright game. My daughter played it for a few minutes, and them moved on to other apps. I'm glad this was a free.
B006LSZECO|4|Good book, definitely kept me wondering what was coming. I didn't care for the end but not sure what might have made it any better either.
0385751060|5|This book came just in time and was in very good condition.<br />The only bad thing was the snell of the paper, not a very pleasent smell. BUT if you want to buy this book I would highly recommend you all to buy it from here. It's an amazing book, just as good and effective as the movie.<br />I'm done reading the book if anyone is looking to get this book I'd be more than happy to give it away free.
B008Q0D9DG|5|This is one of my favorite movies ever. Not to be missed if you like baseball! Quality of pic was fine.
B004ZH66XO|3|Not as great as i was hoping for. But my ten year old son had loved it and has almost completed the whole game in just a few days
0062255657|5|This book just is. It's beautiful in a way that can't be descried in words. It will be experienced differently by everyone who reads it. Read it...<br /><br />... What, you want more? Alright. This book is an exploration of the magic of childhood, through the eyes of an adult. Reading it is a bit like reminiscing about one's own childhood; Gaiman manages to gather so many universal aspects of growing up, of dealing with the world and all of it's complexity when that means accepting things that often make no sense because they are too magical, or too mundane for a child's mind. Through the lens of an adult mind, some of these understandings are inverted. As adults, we still want the world to be magical, but we've resigned ourselves to its plainness. As children, we want things to make sense (we think we want to be adults), but we are in love with the magic, the glamour in the world around us.<br /><br />Gaiman does a wonderful job of leaving so much to the reader's imagination; indeed reading this book is a truly personal experience, because what you find is that descriptions are only so detailed as you need to make a framework on which to build a world. I found my own childhood filling in the gaps, despite having grown up a thousand miles and many decades away from the setting of the story. This is what great writing truly is.<br /><br />One warning: this book is definitely not for children. It's not that there's anything obscene (there's no cursing to be found, and even the mature situations are handled quite carefully), nor is the subject matter specifically mature. It's more that you have to be an adult to see the world through the eyes of the dual-identitied narrator, because he is both adult and child at the same time. Parts of this book will be disturbing to many readers (mostly in a way that is engaging), but especially so for children, who don't have the context by which to navigate these ideas. At best, I think a kid wouldn't understand. At worst, it couldbe really upsetting, in the way that growing up and discovering how reality works can be jarring for us as we grow up. Regardless, I highly recommend this book to any adult. It is a perfect blend of reality and fantasy, and gives something that we all need as we get older: a bridge to our younger selves.
B00COHIFQS|2|This has to be one of the most rediculous movies I have ever seen.  The ending had me rolling my eyes.  Umbelievable and I stopped caring about how things would turn out for the characters half way through.
B002FQOI0A|1|This book is a very good and lots of mystery are solved
B00CHSPB8Y|5|This game makes me like superheroes even more.I think iron man is the best superhero ever.That is why I like this game.
B001NLL93W|5|Well, you've come this far you know you've got to read the whole series!!!  AWESOME read and ever so addictive!  :-)
B00PE26G7U|5|This is a great and easy read.  Full of intrigue and mystery.  KEEPS you guessing with a somewhat surprise ending.
B00Y6QF0PE|5|This was definitely a great read!  I can only hope that E L James writes the other two books in the same fashion!
B00003CXXP|5|Like Walt Disney was the king of creating magic for cartoons on the big screen, Steven Spielberg is the king of creating magic for live action. He brought us magical films such as CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND, E.T., and produced the classic comedy, BACK TO THE FUTURE. Then, in 2001, at the height of his creativity, Steven Spielberg brought us ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE. Personally I find it rather offensive how the family is portrayed with the mother as the parent and the father as nothing more than the \\"mother's husband\\" as it was on 70's TV shows such as 'Maude' and 'Alice.' But aside from that, A.I. I promise you is yet another Steven Spielberg work of art.<br /><br />Critics hailed it as \\"Nonstop magic\\". And they're so right. There's not one moment in this whole 2 and a half hour epic that won't make your eyes widen. Spielberg just lights up the movie with many creative shots and has a brilliant, remarkable cast, led by the great Haley Joel Osment; who just a year earlier, stole the world's heart in the film PAY IT FORWARD. It's nice to have films that whisk us away into an imaginative world. Something to help us forget out troubles for a moment and just be taken away. ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE does just that. Watch this and you'll be reminded that not all movies are degrading. There's still some that can bring magic into our lives. Steven Spielberg keeps that fact strong.
B00004T9VY|4|Cat Stevens' Tea For The Tillerman (1970) is Cat's best album, and it's also an album that I like quite a bit. I didn't care much for Cat's music when this, and his other most popular albums, came out. I was into other types of rock music at the time. But since then, I've checked out some Cat Stevens music here and there, and I can relate now and then. I like to listen to Tea For The Tillerman when I'm the mood for his mature, spiritual and somewhat somber sound. Most of the songs are built around Cat's mellow acoustic guitar, but some are piano-based and orchestrated.<br /><br />The album opens with Where Do The Children Play, and this is one of the album's most popular songs. It's a great one, too, and very thought provoking, but as I listen to it today it's hard to believe that back in 1970, we actually thought that the world's movers and shakers would actually stop to consider Cat's question.<br /><br />I know we've come a long way<br />We're changing day to day<br />But tell me, where do the children play?<br /><br />Wild World is probably Cat's most enduring and popular song. It's the only one I've heard on the radio in the last decade, anyway. It's a lonely and resigned song, sung by someone who's being left by a lover and even though he is heartbroken, he does his best to give friendly advice to the one who's leaving him behind.<br /><br />I like the somber and sacred Sad Lisa, too. It's a minor-key piano and chamber orchestra dirge about a friend who is trapped in her own sadness. Longer Boats is a hopeful chant-like song that has a catchy melody, and Hard Headed Woman is Stevens' search for a woman who will \\"make me do my best\\". I Might Die Tonight is reflective and spiritually themed.<br /><br />Tea For The Tillerman is an album that's best listened to when you're in a solemn mood or you just feel like hearing something thoughtful and mellow. It's a top-notch production by a talented and spiritually minded artist. It'll brighten your spirits if you're feeling down, but it might also make you wonder what ever happened to all the optimistic spiritual enthusiasm that used to be in America.what ever happened to all the optimistic spiritual enthusiasm that used to be in America.
B006IGZWB2|5|I love this movie.  I have watched it several times in a row and I never do that.  It is worth watching over and over.
B004Y1WCDE|5|Awesome, awesome and awesome service. Nothing is better then plex when it comes to media.
B003XRELGQ|5|Kurt Vonnegut was always one of my literary heroes growing up.  As the years have past (as did Mr. Vonnegut), that opinion has not diminished.

0786889284|4|\\"Beyond Recognition\\" by Ridley Pearson accelerates from the first page, and with the exception of a lull at the midway point moves at a nonstop pace.<br />The lull is caused by a couple of scenes being too drawn out and what I felt a weaker subplot.<br />The story is riveting when the action revolves around the investigation of the Seattle serial arsonist and the interaction between Lou Boldt, Daphne Matthews and their team. The characters (on both sides of the law) are well developed and most credible.<br />Mr. Pearson did a couple of years of research on this one and it shows. It is based on an actual Seattle arson case and the procedural and technical aspects really ring true.<br />Seattle comes to life on every page with wonderful descriptive passages.<br />This is a terrific series and Mr. Pearson is masterful at forensic detail, without making it tedious. Highly recommended.
B00DXP7L88|1|This isn't going to take long. I loved this show. I always looked forward to it. The writing was awesome. The characters were awesome. Then I saw the last 15 minutes of the last episode. I'm not going to get into details, I'm sure other reviewers did, but the end of this show was so bad, it makes me wish I never watched it. If you haven't seen Dexter yet, don't bother. That's how bad it was. If I could give negative star ratings, I would.
B0058O84G0|1|Too long, too many characters and too woolly; thankfully, I bought the Kindle version so I didn't have to lug the tome around. Somewhere in here there just may be a good book (or two, or three) but somehow I doubt it.<br /><br />The first scenes, set in and around the mine, were quite interesting but it was all downhill from there. Most of the characters were just cardboard cut-outs and when I arrived at the `aristocrat and maid' storyline I couldn't believe what I was reading - surely a professional story-teller could do better than that? From some reason I continually had a vision of a Terry-Thomas comedy film, so stereotypical was that plot.<br /><br />Just about the only character for whom I had any sympathy was Maud, yet the description of her life after the war was over in a flash whereas we were asked to endure page after page of `working class hero(es) dragging themselves up by his/her/their bootlaces' - not original and not clever. Why didn't the author have the imagination to chart Maud's change of lifestyle at the end of the book in more than a couple of paragraphs?<br /><br />What was the point of the Russia and USA storylines? Why not throw in a couple of characters from the Far East and South America for good measure? That would have eaten up a few hundred extra pages, since size seemed to be the main concern.<br /><br />Clearly I have not understood the point of this book. Why, for example, in the midst of dialogue, descriptions of emotions, gratuitous sex and so on did we suddenly have an essay on the formation of Russian committees, pages of prose with no characterisation that could have been lifted from a school textbook and was even less entertaining?<br /><br />I've enjoyed some of Mr Follett's previous books but this was a complete waste of my time; thank goodness I was sitting on a beach at the time so I can brand it accordingly.
B00IINPXLW|5|great
B00C7TAF3Y|1|I am stuck on the spot with the amulet. Can anyone please help. Thank you.  Also this game is very challenging. Between my mom and I we couldn't even play this game
B0052GACNM|5|I love Tony Bennett and to sing with other artists is so beautifully made.  Everyone should have it in their collection along with Duets 1 ..
B00BP4ZNFM|5|A most lovely, poignant and entertaining picture that will continue to entertain.
B00LDNE3FG|5|This is the best game ever it is a fun game
B00NEJ7MMI|5|We played this for our Christmas celebration, beautiful, no disappointment at all. This is beautifully done
B0007YMUZW|5|let me put a disclaimer out there first: i am a big ryan adams fan. that said, i don't think anyone could be disappointed by this album. it is a wonderfully timed release; an album to put in on a beautiful day and simply enjoy life for all its wonder. from a music standpoint, ryan adams' songwriting combined with the amazing talents of jp bowersock, catherine popper, cindy cashdollar and brad pemberton make for one of mr. adams' best releases, and that's saying an awful lot. i would try and put somewhat of a term on it; folky, twangy, \\"alt-rock\\"... but the fact of the matter is its all these and none of these. in an age of music where things are repeated until cliche, this album in a beautiful breath of fresh air. enjoy it. (and pre-order his next one due out in august as soon as you can. if this album is great, that might be transcendent.)
B009CPES4I|4|Really enjoyed this movie, looking forward to two.
B00873GRU4|4|When first started this book had just hoped I would like it enough to read, I then proceeded to read most of it very quickly but slowed down near the end (pushed boundaries coming to the end of what could accept reading as quickly as I was but up until then was fantastic and did have a good ending).<br /><br />While a few of things in the story are a quite unbelievable this is easy to ignore for the sake of a good story and can easily relate to some of the characters and others can definitely believe they would be like that.<br /><br />The main and scarey thing, however, is how beleivable the nightmare situation these people are in (of which the majority are unaware of in the story) could arise and the awful lengths some go to to ensure others are kept from the truth.<br /><br />Looking forward to reading the next book in the series, am captivated to see where it goes and already wishing there were more than 3 books in the series as can see will be a short time till read them all.
B005H9B2CE|4|High production values make this enjoyable...it has a sense of humor too. Altogether fun and exiting to watch. Asgard is beautiful!.
B005ZOBNOI|5|I loved the book and can't wait to see the movie! I read it in 2 days because I couldn't put it down.
B000I5XDXS|5|Camera work is great! Sound is better! All around great show! Well here are the requirements! Just get it! Boo ya!
B002C6K7N0|2|This is for those Megadeth fans who like \\"Countdown to Extinction.\\" It is not for those who like \\"Peace Sells.\\"  The first two songs really try -and they are impressive- but this album is over produced and it just sounds too clean; Too polished. It is however much better than Metallica's last one. Its not the old Megadeth you were hoping for though.
B003PJ6UHA|4|I purchased this book due to seeing it posted on Facebook. Any book that comes out with ANY research on human consciousness intrigues me. It's been my mantra all thru my life and something I drilled into my children as they grew up that, 'we create our reality.' Unfortunately, my kids would just roll their eyes, and friends would look at me like I had three heads while having coffee and bolt for the door. I'm no scholar, I just have a high school education, but when I was young I read all the books of Seth/Jane Roberts, sessions on reality and consciousness, which states we create our reality, and then lays out the mental framework of HOW we do it, but unfortunately they were not scientists, just ordinary people. All their work is preserved at the Yale Library Archives waiting for the day science is no longer afraid of 'spooky science,' and finally sees the work they did as valid. So when I started reading this book on Biocentrism and finally read the words, written by a notable scientist that 'we create our reality,' and our consciousness can no longer be ignored, but be part of the equation of our antiquated scientific world view of reality.....I leapt for joy! Now I can do the victory dance around my small kitchen and buy a copy for each of my kids! Thanks Bob and Rob for writing this book and opening the door to a whole new frontier for man to explore.....consciousness. :)<br />Easy read, absolutely loved it!
B0091REZMW|5|I have just started playing. I think it is going to be fun. You can play without spending money. You just have to take your time.
B00FAX6XQC|4|Great game though I still have a lot to do before I can come close to beating the game that is why I gave it a 4 star rating, because I haven't played it to the full extent, but so far it's a great game!! Hope you like it!!
B00P7PBD2C|5|Great for kids & adults
B00I8Q77Y0|5|It's vary hard at times but I really like the app! I can sit for hours just playing this game and be unaware of my surroundings! #so much fun!<br />: D
B00MIA0KGY|5|Wonderful voices on Barbara's recording.
B007SGM084|5|I have read this trilogy twice so far and I am getting ready to read it a third time. Not a disapointment at all!!!!!
B004DLPXAO|5|The best!
B000VMFDW2|5|The author really helps take you into the atrocities of the pacific theater with class and dignity. After watching The Pacific reading the book really drives home what these brave men experienced..
B009NFHF0Q|5|Ok- I loved this book.  Let me set the stage so you know how many grains of salt with which to take my comments.<br /><br />I like all Gaiman's stuff- I just do.  So, I was predisposed to this from the start.  However, the day after I had downloaded the book, I was waiting on the platform for a train from Philly to NY and whom did I see, meet and speak very briefly with?  Yep, Neil himself.  Good times.<br /><br />I will start with a criticism, then gush a bit.  The book is short - very short.  It felt like it was a novella for juvenile readers that was stretched slightly, rubbed with a little mature sauce and became a novel.  That is what it is - it doesn't bother me one whit.<br /><br />The main character was appropriately clueless before learning too much about too many things to retain his innocence.  The Hempstocks tried to help him retain that perspective, but there are things that even they can't do, I suppose.  Those three (?) women are one of my favorite literary character sets so far. They wear their place in the universe very well.<br /><br />How is his innocence lost?  By the shenanigans/designs/machinations of one Ursula Monkton.  Prepare to hate this creature.  Ready?  Set?  Hate!<br /><br />One of the most influential books of my childhood was &#34;A Wrinkle In Time&#34; (c'mon folks, I can't be the only one...).  This book has similar elements- unspeakable evil; inscrutable but touchable/relatable forces of good; and a struggle between them well beyond our senses but one that we can somehow influence.  Beyond these comparisons, this book made me FEEL the same way that one did.<br /><br />I like feeling that way.  Five stars worth.
B00A8ECU24|2|This game is great and I like it but..... whenever I go to the minigames the minecart jumps really slow and I can only do the twos on the dance minigame and it makes it not that fun😿if you fix I will give five stars PLEASE FIX!!!!!!😼😼
B00628RVV0|5|Fantastic. I use it in my class every year.
B0091REZMW|5|Great game, especially if you love hidden object games like this.  I enjoy the challenges to meet and like having goals to accomplish.
B001NLL8LA|5|I've read all the previous Jack Reacher books.  They are fantastic.  Real<br />escape reading.  Action packed right from the first page.
B00683JLXA|5|My grandson loves the game, I am asking him so this review is from him. He said its kind of like angry birds to Him.
B00KQFP5GS|3|Fair take on a modernized version but I am still a fan of the original.
B002N5N4M6|5|We're watching this series at work on my lunch hour & love them.  They are so funny!  Whoever thought a group of brainy nerds could be so funny, and they are converting Penny.  Great entertainment.  P.S.  I sang the Soft Kitty song, first verse, to my kitty while she was on my lap & she purr, purr, purred.
1400067820|5|Readers of Nassim's books may have noticed a trend in the direction of his writing, from the street-level view of Fooled By Randomness to the refined prose of The Black Swan. But the route seems somewhat circular, with core ideas revisited in an attempt to refine via more current examples and more simplified prose. Nassim is, in a way, getting simpler, and getting closer to the central point we all knew he had.<br /><br />We saw signs of this central point with Nassim's web-based documents on what he called antifragility, or the ability to get stronger, smarter, faster, or otherwise better when exposed to disorder in all its forms (AKA \\"The Extended Disorder Family\\"). Now, with the book Antifragile, we get to truly see a full rounding of Nassim's ideas complete with their logical conclusion - that we cannot predict black swans or determine what their impacts will be, but we can develop systems that benefit from the inevitability of such events.<br /><br />I suppose I should have seen this book coming, and in a lot of ways I feel foolish for all the side research I did after reading The Black Swan in 2007. I studied complex systems and got in my share of fights with mathematicians who claimed that quantification was the only way to understand how things \\"are.\\" Making mathematicians angry almost seemed worth it, but at the end of the day I just wanted to know what I could do, as a practitioner of the art of living, in order to not just survive but make a lively affair of it. After all, not cracking up is one thing, getting stronger when other things crack up is a whole other kettle of seamonkeys.<br /><br />So here we are, with Nassim's One Book. You can read this and capture all you need to know about black swans, the avoidance of sucker games, and the art of living well in spite of everything that would seem to indicate that you can't control anything in any respect and thus should hit the panic button, visit a iatrogenician for a lifetime supply of thought suppressants, and find a nice \\"safe\\" job where you can make PowerPoint presentations without the fear that you may one day have to pay for the results of your actions.<br /><br />It's all here - Nassim's full scope of antifragile methodologies, given from his uncompromisingly personal perspective. You'll feel like you always do when you read his work, that what you see on the page is very likely the exact thing he'd tell you in person, assuming you can find him and somehow bait him (perhaps with Lebanese wine?) into a conversation he is no doubt growing weary of having. We're lucky he didn't give up in disgust after the financial markets blew up and he started getting pulled into the \\"what do we do now?!\\" rhetoric. So I feel it is our obligation, as humans living in these very interesting times, to read Antifragile as both an antidote to any pessimism that has rooted itself in our guts and as an antibody to protect us from the \\"if this kills you then I'll stand corrected\\" tendencies of educators, policy makers, historians, businesspeople, health care providers, and babblers of all stripes.<br /><br />You get all this and more - a full glossary of virtually all the terms Nassim has introduced us to plus a whole section of technical notes which could be read in lieu of the rest of the book should you have the right pair of eyes to do so.<br /><br />If you haven't read any of Nassim's previous books, I'd advise you continue to do exactly that, and leave them alone until you have pored over Antifragile. All of his other works are supplemental to this, and frankly unnecessary if all you're looking for is the practical application of his ideas.<br /><br />Cheers, Nassim. You just made the book of the century. Humanity owes you one, and if I ever see you on the street or in a cafe I'll do my part and kindly leave you be.ants, and find a nice \\"safe\\" job where you can make PowerPoint presentations without the fear that you may one day have to pay for the results of your actions.<br /><br />It's all here - Nassim's full scope of antifragile methodologies, given from his uncompromisingly personal perspective.

B009FB3XTA|5|I love the movie and it was epic! Your money would be well spent if you buy this movie :). If you don't like the twilight saga then i recommend you pick a different movie.
B00GCE3TCE|5|Not many books change my life. This one did. Recommend it to everyone, whatever their favored genre. Read the first 25 pages then had to put it down for a week. Don't let it keep you from picking it back up.
B002VKE1K2|1|***SOME SPOILERS BELOW***<br /><br />When I heard all of the buzz about this movie, I couldn't wait to rent it. Alls I heard is that this is the scariest movie ever made, and how I'd be scared out of my wits watching it.  This wasn't even close.  I had a lot of problems with it.<br /><br />The first problem that I had was the sound quality. I understand they wanted to film it as if it was being filmed on a handheld (although it was a good sized one) camera.  Unfortunately, that's how it sounded too.  At times, the sound was low and not very clear. Again, I understand why it was filmed that way, but for me it didn't work. Actually, it took away from the movie.<br /><br />The characters of Katie and MIcha were very shallow, and after a while, really grated on my nerves.  They were so flat and didn't have  any depth to them. There was glimmers of depth do Katie, and at times I felt sorry for her, but other times, she was kind of annoying. There wasn't really and progression of any kind to them. Micha was so boring there was nothing to him. At times, Katie grew mad at Micha, and launched a few f-bombs, but then went back to her normal self. I'd have liked to see her get a bit madder as the movie went on. If Katie went from calm to getting angry, then flat out P*issed, would have been interesting to see.  This only happened when the demon possessed her at the end. I felt that was when she was most interesting to watch.<br /><br />This is  very boring movie. Nothing really happens until the last two minutes. That's why I gave it one star instead of zero stars. I actually liked the last couple of minutes. Up until then, **nothing** happens.  Sure, you get a growl, a door will move a bit, a chandelier will shake, keys will be moved, other small things happen, but that's it.  We're talking about a demon here. A demon. Why not push one of them down the steps? Throw one across the room? Have chairs being thrown about? Anything would have been good. I was just waiting for something to happen, and alls we see for a while, a door will move. That's it folks. As the movies goes on, we do seem some interesting things. A door slams, and then knocking, the girl is dragged out of bed and across the floor and then out of the room down the hall, and it possessed Katie. I actually liked that part, and that was at the end. I loved that! The movie should have started off like that, or have that happen sooner.<br /><br />The movie had a Medium, who was very annoying. He said there was a demon in the house.....and this was based on feelings. Not solid evidence, no investigation, nothing, Just a feeling. They could have used the medium and have him do an overnight investigation and have him find something..... anything. But no, he said there was a demon in the house, just on his feelings. The producers and writers missed a golden chance to have fear interjected in the movie.<br /><br />The attic scene bothered me. Again, they could have had something happen when Micha went to the attic. Have something fall, have Micha hear something, or have him see just a pair of eyes looking back at him, but the only thing he finds is a picture. That's it. Again, this was a fantastic scene if they movie makers wanted something scary to happen, but nothing was done, just a pic was found.<br /><br />I did like the very end. When we see Katie stumble out of the room, and go into the downstairs, then we hear blood curdling screams, them Micha wakes up and runs to her and he started screaming (we don't see why, and that really worked for me, loved the scene) then silence..... then we hear heavy footsteps, Micha is thrown into the bedroom, then Kaite stomps slowly in the room covered with blood. Katie then stomps to Micha's body....crawls.... sniffs it, then grins in the camera, and growls, has a horrible demonic grin, and attacks the camera, then it ends. I loved that part!!  That was spooky, eerie, and uncomfortable to watch. I love it! Why couldn't the entire movie be like that?  I would have loved it if the entire movie was as good as that once scene. It's just to bad, that it took sitting through a boring movie to get to that last scene. I also liked how we saw the footprints in the flour, very nice.<br /><br />I understand why the movie makers never showed us the demon. They figure the unseen is worse then the seen, and I agree with that. I loved the Blair Witch Project.  For some reason, in Paranormal Activity, it didn't work. Maybe if they made it more suspenseful by having the demon do more demonic things, it would have worked better than it did.<br /><br />If you want to see it, I'd say go for it. Just don't expect much to happen until the last two minutes.  This movie was way overhyped.s good as that once scene. It's just to bad, that it took sitting through a boring movie to get to that last scene. I also liked how we saw the footprints in the flour, very nice.

B009NFHF0Q|5|Another interesting novel by Neil.  So far, I've loved everything he has written, my favorites being &#34;American Gods&#34; and &#34;Good Omens&#34; (with Terry Prachett).
B00EJYGL8S|5|Have been steadily getting their albums.  Even converted some family members to this style of music.
B002AKPECW|4|I read on the recommendation of Steve Gibson (@SGgrc). It was a very good SciFi Space Opera. I thought the scope of the story and depth of the universe were outstanding. The characters were also well drawn and very believable. While the science was detailed and consistent, there were a couple of things that I thought were contrived only to move the story along and that bothers me a little. I don't recall the specifics, so they were minor. The ending was also not as fulfilling as I expected. This was also minor. I definitely recommend it to anyone who likes good Space Opera and I'll be reading some works of Alastair Reynolds (this was the first of his works that I have read).
B00BH0VSM6|4|Great book!! I love the irony, the plot twists, the character changes, and the suspense.  You never know &#34;whodunnit&#34; until the end!!!
B00K2CHWOI|5|I really enjoyed this movie. It was action packed and very unique.
B0054JZC6E|5|My brother and I challenge each other to get higher scores. It so fun. you just cant stop playing. Get this app!!
0062238868|5|Great book.
B0050DIWFC|5|It is amazing to learn the different decisions two parents reach over the same child. A lot of twists and turns.
B00FAPF5U0|1|I enjoyed what I played of it but being new to this type of app. I was shocked at the constant pay for tools. A child or adult could run up a very expensive bill quickly.
B004EAQNO4|4|Good movie to watch and keeps one guessing as to what will happen next.
B00HDMMISA|5|I could not put it down! The interjections of comments and police investigation about the murder left me wondering who dies on trivia night! The portrayal of domestic violence is so well done and the story of friendship is touching. I did not want it to end.
B00000JCOV|5|This CD is amazing. It is one of the heaviest, darkest, most amazingly good albums to come out in a long time. If I had to compare Slipknot to other bands it would probably go like this: They have the same somewhat  disturbing song quality as early KoRn and the gutteral screams and hard  riffs of Fear Factory. And on tracks like &quot;Spit It Out&quot; Corey can  spit out (no pun intended) lyrics with such speed and intensity that it  puts the current Rap/Rock movement (mainly Limp Bizkit) to shame. It's hard  to really convey just how good this CD is, the only way you can really  understand what I mean is to listen to it. This CD is so full of rage that  at times it's quite soothing. Go buy it now, I wasn't let down and I don't  think you will be either.
B00881VLCE|4|Great puzzles but hard to find the free ones! But really easy to use. Doesn't get old at all. blah
B00005LB9O|5|I had heard of the band Travis and read a few things about them in various publications and websites, but had not ever heard their music.  I am glad that I now have.  The first song I heard from Travis, was ironically, a cover to Britney Spears' &quot;Baby One More Time&quot;.  The band was having a good time with the song, but their version of the song actually made it a very good song.  I decided that I needed to check the band out.  I bought &quot;The Invisible Band&quot; and have loved the whole CD.  I now have purchased their last release, &quot;The Man Who&quot;, and have enjoyed that as well.  This is a great band and a great album.  The first track, &quot;Sing&quot; is the first single as well - great song.  &quot;Side&quot; will definetely be a single and my favorite track right now is &quot;Pipe Dreams&quot;.  Great song and great lyrics.  The song actually reminds me of one of my favorite bands, The Connells.  &quot;Flowers in the window&quot; is very catchy with a Beatle-esque sound to it, and another favorite is &quot;The Humpty Dumpty love song&quot;, a great song.  All in all, this album is great from start to finish and has made Travis one of my favorite bands.  Some of my other favorite bands are Train, Matchbox Twenty, Third Eye Blind, The Connells, R.E.M., U2, Barenaked Ladies and The Cure.  If you like any of these bands, you will more than likely enjoy Travis.  Go pick it up!
B0031RAOVY|5|This is a great sad family movie. This is also a true story.  It can be viewed for all ages.
B009N1HUIC|5|good
0790731924|5|This is a good film, and for your info they are from South Africa not Germany..... did you even see it? someone needs to grow up and stop being a B**ch
B006WZLCZ4|5|very cute and my baby really love this set
B005K01VZS|5|I like this book and a dinner at five with its to central characters. It is a short and easy read, but very moving. I think it is a book that will appeal to a broad cross-section of readers.
B005DTXAIW|3|Daughter loves all the books in this series.
B00005ATQF|4|There's a lot of movies about Vietnam, but this stand up for everyone.  It is intelligent and deep.  It is cleverly disgised strong critique for war and what it does to men.  If you like movies about war, this is a must.
B0031KC8OM|5|Nearly 10 years after the show started and around 7 years after the show went off the air, I can still show nearly anyone the pilot of this show and they're instantly hooked.  Solid writing in season one from the get go.<br /><br />I have never been sucked into a show like I was when I watched it when it was on the air....and like I still am.  It doesn't matter how many times I watch it, I never get tired of it and I see new connections and references every time.
B004W1GCQO|4|I can't stop watching this show its so interesting similar with dowton abbey in a different way !!<br />All the drama and the character, nothing to complain about.
B00005UPO2|5|This will be a gift for my husband for Xmas.  He absolutely loves this movie!!  Haven't watched yet, but was delivered very quickly and perfectly packaged!! Definitely recommend to anyone who is thinking of buying from this vendor!!
006202406X|2|Stop at the first book and save yourself the pain! I knew I should stop reading half way through the second book, but the friend I was reading with wouldn't hear if it. Once we had finished the series she agreed wholeheartedly that I was right.
0385340990|5|We found the audio book exceptionally engaging.  Although we have VERY different points of view and family backgrounds, we were happily surprised with this portrayal of the 5-year Nazi occupation of the Islands.  (The very faint religious touches mentioned in a few reviews are not misplaced - there was conflict between the French Catholics and British Church of Englanders.)<br /><br />Perfect example of the difference between simple people and people with simple lifestyles. Five stars seems a lot, but appropriate for light fiction, necessarily a bit superficial.<br /><br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.
B00DJFIMW6|5|seriously one of the funnest games i have played ever! i would suggest it to anyone. it's never the same course, its sometimes difficult and fun. keeps you on your toes.
B00KWVZ750|1|Disappointed for sure! I deleted this game in ten minutes
B000HAB4KS|5|This is a great movie. I think by now everyone has seen it, if you haven't, check it out. I've since replaced this DVD with a bluray.
B0054JZC6E|4|I have had a lot of fun with these games so far. I have unlocked a bunch, although there are some where i constantly fail.<br />These games are a lot of fun and very entertaining. I like some much more than others, but did not expect anything different with such a big collection.
B003F3NDWG|5|Love the series
B000056V73|5|I dont care - this picture is ALMOST GREAT. Ive already seen Crowes Jerry Maguire and Vanilla Sky and they were very good (especially Vanilla Sky I really dont understand why so much people don't like this beautiful movie). But this is his best work of art.<br />Well, at first I was thinking: Hmmm This is kind of good movie... but I don't like it a lot, it's not my culture it is far from my interests, I've never liked rock n roll a lot... And so far I had a great stomach-ache and so I had to postpone watching it...<br />The next morning I woke up with no ache. And so I thanked God and continued watching film. And... and I think it was one of the best movies Ive seen this year or maybe ever. Great acting, great music (I still don't like this type of music a lot, but it was great. A kind of surprise was Lou Reeds Im waiting for the man, I really adore cover-version of this song performed by my favorite singer Vanessa Paradis), great screenplay, great work of all the film's cast. So I want to thank everybody who made this touching, happy and lyrical picture about music, love, life and growing-up. To thank them all.
B005XUC398|5|Fast paced, a great movie for all ages.  Kevin Spacey is one of my favorite actors and he was great in this movie
B005LAIGZU|5|I saw this movie in the theatre and enjoyed every minute of it!  I don't get how some people were let down by the dialouge because I have seen many a poorly written and acted movies but this is NOT one of them.  While I was watching I never got the sense that any line was forced or badly delivered.  I have seen may interviews and programs about these brave warriors and what I saw on the screen was exactly what those being interviewed came across as,  dedicated members of our military who think not of themselves but of those they serve with and will do anything to complete the mission and make sure that their other team members, not themselves, get home safely.  While the movie itself is fiction, I know many of the scenes are based on real life events from various missions during the war on terror because I remember reading about them in the paper or doing researching after having seen the movie.  It was great way to spend an afternoon and know afterwards that the people in this movie are out there keeping us safe.
B00DR0PDNE|5|everyone should have it. super easy to use and makes streaming at home very comfortable.
B0046B8GEQ|5|Thoroughly enjoyable for both kids and adults! Great storyline and engaging characters! Looking forward to seeing the sequel before long!
6302968143|5|For young and slightly older alike, harmless holiday entertainment. Recommended especially to those who love witch movies. Bette Midler, Sarah Jessica Parker and Kathy Najimy are great as the evil but mostly befuddled  spell casters. One of my all time favorits!
B00MN9PQ8C|5|Really worth the buy
B000PST4XQ|5|This item came within two weeks with not a mark on it! It is perfect and much appreciated.
B006VRDZ44|5|Excellent
B004JN1D2I|5|Remarkably twisted and wickedly fun; but if you're this far in, you know that already.  Worth reading.  Don't just watch the series.
B00FDSV4TA|5|Upgrade to Wieland, Bennington is great! Only con is it's not a full album, but highly recommend, hope he stays with them.
0142420891|5|Really liked this book from Adam's P.O.V... It made him so much more real, and it better describes his relationship with Mia.  I really liked how Gayke Foreman describe his life and feelings without Mia.  I also liked how she described how he felt since in a way he lost a part of his &#34; family&#34; too... Definitely a must read
B0017SWPXY|5|Fascinating book. Once I started it, I couldn't put it down. The author's portrayal from the dogs perspective was intriguing. It made me look at my own dog in a new light. Highly recommended.
1439190275|4|Easy to understand

B00AHTYGRW|5|Argo follows Tony Mendez (Ben Affleck) as he plans and leads a CIA rescue mission during the 1979 Iran hostage. Argo is an intense, suspenseful, and entertaining thriller.<br /><br />Argo's story and storytelling are great. I was not familiar with the actual events prior to watching this film, but this film managed to spark an interest on the subject. The story in this film mostly relies on its extremely suspenseful situations; I suppose it's even more suspenseful for those unfamiliar with the real story. Along with the suspense, the film also uses drama, action, and even some comedy in a well-balanced and consistent manner; plenty of memorable characters and dialogue. Argo begins with an intense, unforgettable raid, as you can see the fear and worry in all of the characters preparing for the inevitable. The ending of the film, the last 30 or so minutes, is the definition of \\"suspenseful.\\"; it's a dreadful edge-of-your seat finale. The storytelling is tight and smooth; as in, it's easy to follow and doesn't have much filler content. The performances were great. The music really helped create the atmosphere, tone, and authenticity of the film. Also, the credits of this film has a comparison between the film and actual photographs of the events/people, this segment really showed the attention to detail and the aesthetic authenticity; I really liked this. The pacing was fast, in my opinion, and I was fully immersed throughout the full runtime. Ben Affleck's direction was also superb, like in his other two films.<br /><br />Overall, Argo is a beatifully crafted, perfectly executed thriller; the film is suspenseful, thrilling, unique and, most importantly, very entertaining. I HIGHLY recommend a purchase, if you already have strong doubts about it because it is a critically-acclaimed film or because it may not be 100% accurate then I recommend a rental.<br /><br />Argo has some strong violence and blood.
030758836X|5|From start to finish I loved it! I think everyone should read this book. If you do end up reading it and enjoyed it as much as I did you should defiantly read Dark placed and Sharp Objects. Both are written and as thrilling as Gone Girl.
B0050OMJIW|5|Full of wonderfully dark humor. The part about crabapples is utterly hilarious. The only downside I can think of it that it does have a tendency to jump around a bit, and doesn’t make for ‘easy reading’. In fact, it took me three attempts to actually get into it, but it was the best thing I did. Persevere with this novel, and you are in for an absolute treat.
1594744769|5|The top few reviews for this book hit a lot of the main points right on the head.  This book is a wonderful introduction into a world where you can get swept away.  I see this series becoming just as popular as the Harry Potter books.  I read the first three chapters on-line and absolutely had to get the book.  When I did get it I finished it that same day, which isn't a normal occurrence for me.  I simply could not put this book down once I started to read it!  Ransom Riggs has a firecracker of a story on his hands and I can't wait to see what's next in book two.  This is a series that would translate easily into a comic book, movie or TV series if done right.
B00M7UTFW0|3|It was ok. Not great but ok.
1490313370|5|James shares some thought provoking personal experiences mixed in with very practical advice about how to choose yourself.  It's not often that entrepreneurs are so candid about their successes as well as their failures.

B00MASEPTC|5|Great episode!
1475143389|5|While the principles in this book are not new, they are laid out and explained in a very comprehensive manner. There are several other guys out there who subscribe and teach this philosophy of training who are very experienced reputable as well. Which, to me, just brings more validity to these principles. Anytime someone comes out with something brand new that no one has ever heard of or agrees with, you can almost be sure its a scam. Not the case here. Mr. Matthews really does a great job laying a foundation for exercise and nutrition for ANYONE who would like to take control of their health. I couldn't recommend this book more!
B00ESNDQWY|5|Has me hooked.  Good entertainment.
B009ZQC7MY|5|This is an excellent series.  The cast and acting are supburb!  I look forward to watching each epsode.  Well done!

B00FB13Y74|5|Pure driving fun.  I wish I had more cupcakes!  Great graphics with  simple yet challenging gameplay.
B007HIEBV2|5|Very fun to listen to. I burned it to a CD to keep in my shared car. It was music my family and I could listen to and not worry about awkward lyrics or overly brooding themes!
B007FG9LIE|5|Loved this story.
B00DQEB1V4|1|No impressed.  I sent this one back.  The best stylus is your finger.
B009HNDCC4|5|Every season is so funny!
0061122416|5|I recieved the book in the same way it was written and the book is changing my life in so many ways. i find myself thinking of countless situations i could fix and countless ways to look at a new opportunity. I have to say this book is just something that i feel most people in this world should read because of intricateness. I love the book and it's done so much for me and i received the book yesterday and i've only read 45 pages. SMH ILOVEIT!lol A MUST READ BOOK!
B002C6K7N0|5|This is just incredible. Here you have the album both Megadeth and Metallica have been trying to make for years. This is a tremendous return to form. I wasn't particularly impressed with United Abominations, but this shows that Dave definitely has it left in him. Great production, great riffing, and the signature Dave Mustaine snarling vocals. The only thing not very great about this album is the soloing. Chris Broderick is an incredible guitarist, but the soloing didn't impress me here. It's really just playing as fast as he can. I'd rather listen to a Friedman or Poland solo.    If I were to break down this album track by track I would give every song great reviews except for the last track, the Right To Go Insane. The verse riff is basically the take no prisoners riff played 8x slower. Still great and contains a great variety of songs. From fast and brutal (This Day We Fight) to melodic (44 Minutes) to the Youthanasia/Countdown hard rock style (How The Story Ends) and even a ballad reminiscent of A Tout Le Monde (Hardest Part Of Letting Go).    Stunning album. I got it the day of it's release. I spent 14 bucks on it and I think it was 14 bucks well spent.
B008B8AOQI|5|What an amazing CD.  I heard his song &#34;Let her go&#34; on the radio.  Of course, Amazon is the best way to get hard to find CD's/
B008JFUNTG|5|Good!
B008JGSM6G|5|I love this game it is my favorite game I have it on my phone my ipod and my ipad
B0032CVAQQ|5|his book has great insight and is very informative. It is not just for<br />people struggling in their marriage, but will also be very helpful to those<br />with a good marriage that want to make it even better.
B00881VLCE|4|I like the variety of puzzles. I would love to see more free puzzles added, though. Also, while the music is soothing, hearing the same song over and over can get annoying. I have the sound up so I can  hear whether a piece clicks. I'm trying to find a way to mute the music and not the sound.
B003V6L94Q|5|Totally brilliant album
B00G5G7EXY|1|That's about it folks.  Except for the sister who has the power to make snow, ice, and freeze things in general.<br /><br />Disney is usually so adept at making sure their Pixar films are palatable for adults as well as children, but they really missed the mark on this picture.<br /><br />The plot was thin - if they had actually followed the plot of \\"The Snow Queen\\" by Hans Christian Andersen, it would have been a far better movie.  There were also gaping holes in what little plot there was, which were seemingly filled by songs that went on far too long.<br /><br />Missing information - off the top of my head... I didn't pay that much attention because overall, it's BORING.<br /><br />1)  What does Elsa (?) do while she's locked in that room for years and years?<br />2)  What happens to Kristoff's (?) family that he has to be raised by trolls in the form of rocks and apparently develop a special relationship with his reindeer?<br />3)  Who runs the kingdom while the older sister is locked away?<br />4)  If the blonde sister is so concerned about \\"Letting things go\\" that she has to belt it out in song, why didn't she just man up, return to the kingdom and take her rightful place as queen?  Hiding from the world in your ice palace is not letting it go.  It's running away.<br />5)  While she's hiding in her ice palace, all alone, what is she doing to eat?  You can only survive so long on water in it's various forms.<br />6)  On that note - her clothes also become considerably skimpier - why would you throw off your warm dress and cloak?  If you light a fire, your house will melt.<br /><br />The snowman and the reindeer provided some comic relief and they were the best parts of the movie.  Quite honestly, the best part of this was watching my niece perform while it was on.  She recited most of the lines and sang the songs as well (and that tells me she has seen this far too often).  For me, it was 1 hour and 42 minutes of my life that I can never get back.<br /><br />Pixar has far better options out there - Finding Nemo, Despicable Me 1 & 2, Up - to name a few.  There are a lot of classic Disney cartoons that are fantastic as well, providing far better options to choose from than Frozen.
B008BQ8YHQ|5|Fast paced.  Clever lines.  Love the main characters, especially Mike whose expressions speak volumes :-).  Louis is the best!  This is a very entertaining show.

B00LMRKZB4|5|Perfect for the Shield II
B0058UXHHK|4|Very enjoying.
B00DPM7TIG|5|Stayed up till 2-3 a.m. every night reading it. Amazing protagonist; amazing author.
B004K58GSO|5|With this line up you can't go wrong.  Not my fave Wayne film, but worth watching from time to time.  Mitchum does a good job, something about his face and voice just always works for me.  The supporting case is well cast.
B00005JP97|3|Black Snake Moan is the story of 2 unlikely individuals who cross paths and strangely heal each other.  I was expecting a very Quentin Tarrentinoish flavor to this movie considering the DVD artwork, use of similar imagery and storyline but this movie was not executed as well as it could have been.  The movie drags on and is about 1/2 hour too long.  The acting is good but certain scenes are just dragged on for too long such as some of the guitar scenes.  Overall, I do suggest you check this movie out but its not one of my favorites.
B000I55YV2|4|I like it when the good guys win and they did it with style and class. Car chase was good

3836504715|5|excellent book--has large photographs, whereas most of the Atget Paris collections have rather small reproductions. A pleasure to look at, and very reasonable price for this book
B00BD99JMW|2|What a sad and disappointing ending.  While not as good as the first two books, I still enjoyed it up until the end.  I do not think that was necessary and it is very depressing.  No more Roth books for me.
B004XUMMFE|5|Something new and exciting every show, you never sure what sort of trouble their going yo get into.Great Shoe we would recommend it to our friends and have.
B001UV4XIS|5|Definitely an amazing movie, not any better than the book though. Still you should buy this because it is awesome.
B0055SWM08|5|superb graphics and a relaxing soundtrack make this my go to game when I just wanna relax after work....my only criticism is that it could be a bit more challenging
B0019N8P2W|5|Well maybe it's just a glimpse of the past or maybe me just remembering the days of school crushes and watching MTV after skipping classes, but I actually was excited when I found this long awaited series on dvd. It was about time! I give it a thumbs up.It was good to actually watch this show episode to episode instead of catching it randomly on tv. They have changed one thing, the music. As cool as it would be to hear the grunge sounds of yester year they have replaced it with song melodies that sound kinda similar. But hey, who remembers what songs where actually playing back then anyways so not to big of deal. So all in all I do say go buy it. Besides more then likely someone you know will be excited they weren't the only one who watched it!
B00CATSONE|1|Akin to a middle school essay written the night before it is due.  Actually just a come on to buy a full book.
B00946ZOT8|5|Five star service....couldn't have been better....Thanks Again
1484707230|5|We fell in love with the Percy Jackson movies and decided we couldn't wait to see what happens, so I bought the series.  Could not put them down.  Amazing read for the entire family!
B00L9B7IKE|4|Wow.  Rather dark intense story.  You never know who did it until the end.  Hard to put down..  good read.
B00KW27K4K|5|Excellent Movie !!!!!
B0089EHWQE|4|I had to take away one star because it was obvious where this story was going from the start. Having said that, this was a totally enjoyable read with well-developed characters that you instantly cared about. Louisa Clark has been slogging along at a dead end job, but one which she enjoys, for five years when she is suddenly let go because the restaurant is closing. With few options, Lou accepts a position as companion/carer to Will Traynor, a wealthy young man whose life has been upended by a horrific traffic accident leaving him a quadriplegic. At their wits end, Will's parents are looking for someone who will be Will's friend and perhaps help pull him away from the edge of the abyss on which he teeters, having already attempted suicide to escape his altered life. Lou is from the \\"wrong side of the tracks\\" in comparison to the privileged life that Will has led, but her quirky take on life intrigues him and so the relationship begins. It becomes obvious pretty early on where this story is headed, but the tale is entertaining and I'll confess to becoming very attached to the characters and very vested in the outcome, even shedding more than one tear at the predictable conclusion. The debate over whether or not one should be allowed to decide to take one's own life rages on. Leaving that aside, this story kept me turning the pages and finishing the story in less than 24 hours.
B00004Z459|5|ok first of all this Cd Rocks I listen to the cd all th time and i havn't taken it out of my cd player for.....well the day i bought it it is a kinda like 311's rap/rock style and just for you gulible people Linkin park changed their name from hybird theory because another band named hybird theory was going to sue (there first cd's name was linin park...feturing carousel and High Voltage also the band is from Lincoln park cal.) Over all this cd is a great buy some of the best songs include Papercut With you Runaway pushing me away and In the end,but Every song is worth listening to.
B006GLLXXK|5|love that True Blood!
1451629192|5|I ordered this book from Amazon when it was first published as a hardcover.  It took me awhile to actually decide that I wanted to and was ready to read it.  Once I started reading I could not put the book down and finished it in two days.  Jaycee did an excellent job of telling her story and she is truly an inspiration to all.  I hope Jaycee gets to do everything she has ever wanted to in life and wish the very best to her and her family.  I would definitely recommend this book!!
B00005JN0T|5|love the DVD thanks
B00BSBR9N6|5|This is one of the most delightful books I have read in a while<br />  If you loved the The Unlikely Pilgrimage of Harold Fry, you will find The Rosie Project equally satisfying.  To see us through the eyes of someone a little off-center ,  but totally representative of all of us is charming and illuminating at the same time.
B00008J4P5|5|I love this album. The White Stripes 2nd best behind their debut.   The tracklisting:   1. Seven Nation Army   2. Black Math   3. There's No Home For You Here   4. I Just Don't Know What To Do With Myself   5. In The Cold, Cold Night   6. I Want To Be The Boy To Warm Your Mother's Heart   7. You've Got Her In Your Pocket   8. Ball and Biscuit   9. The Hardest Button To Button   10.Little Acorns   11.Hypnotize   12.The Air Near My Fingers   13.Girl, You Have No Faith In Medicine   14.Well It's True That We Love One Another      Brilliant.   Just sheer brilliance.   I was extremely impressed with this album. After hearing it I immediatly bought they other three releases. That's how good it is.   Amazing lyrics and guitar. Great drumming too.   Another thing that makes it so unique is the fact that there is no bass player. And there's no need for one!   I would advise anyone who likes good music to buy this.
B0007P0LO8|2|Very disappointing visually.  Looks like it was filmed slightly out of focus or mastered from vhs.<br />The audio is really lovely, I will just have to chalk it up as a dvd you don't watch, just listen.
B0093X805W|5|I love this book because it is has imagination in it. This book was awesomely cool because it had chocolate in it.
B0094LYJZI|4|touching love story with a message
B000957O82|4|This is one hilarious movie.  In it Will Smith is a date doctor that tries to hook up his clients with girls that they would by themselves have trouble getting either due to they are shy, not good with women or something else.  Smith's character is trying to hook up Kevin James with a rich woman that he is in love with.  It is a very funny movie in which Kevin James does a great job.  The scene where he displays his dance moves is just HILARIOUS!!!  Will Smith does a great job and has some very funny scenes too.  All in all this is a very good comedy that I would definately recommend.
B00005LOUQ|5|Love this movie. Great product.  Would recommend to those not in need of Blu-Ray for a fun, Christmas tradition. Thanks!
B005LAIH4A|5|good
B00CM9JKFI|3|The album was fair enough for me, I have no serious complaints about the music.<br />My main qualms are with the pricing. I figured that the price was so high because of the metal bust of Loki. The bust was as metal (in the literal sense) as Blue Cheer (in the metaphorical sense). Either the base of it is the only thing made of metal or the rest of it is just a cheap thin kind of metal. The bust looks pretty cool, and the compartment in the rear for the CDs is interesting, however, it was certainly not worth $100. I would've maybe paid $50 for this edition, and that was if I was convinced.<br />Nonetheless, the album sounds pretty okay, my personal favorite on the album is the title track &#34;Deceiver of the Gods&#34;.
B005CAPS0K|4|This movie was very nicely thought out.  I watched it to see if I would like it, because Insidious 2 is coming out.  I would have to say it is a new way to think about outer body experiences.  I liked it very much and will definitely be seeing the second.
B00AQ3K8IU|5|A very well written story. Something for everyone and keeps the readers interest from beginning to end. You won't go wrong buying and reading this one.
B003GJSUPY|5|One of the great live albums of the 70s!Do not know if its remastered or not but sounds awesome on the road.
B001EBV0OY|5|Persistent resistant will overcome oppression.  That is the hope of oppressed peoples everywhere told in this tale.
1451688091|5|I really loved this book!  I bought and read this book when it first came out and loved it so much I gave it to a family member.  Last year I purchased another one because it's the kind of book I want to always have on hand to refer back.
B005S9EKCW|4|The actual product lives up to typical Blu-Ray standards (that means good)<br />The sound on the Blu-Ray actually sounds more balanced than when I saw it in the theatre.<br /><br />The movie itself, some like it, some hate it.  That is up to you.  The strong singers are still strong and the weak characters are still weak.
B007BGQFTQ|5|I absolutely loved this series. One of the things that attracts me to the steampunk genre is the creativity of the writer. The world Gail Carriger created is engaging, entertaining and just plain fun to read about. I read right through the entire boxed set and was sorry to reach the end.
B00633W614|5|One of Jeffrey Archers best works to date. I look forward to reading the next in this series to see what becomes of the characters and how Archer developes the plot.
0385532458|3|I am a huge John Grisham fan and have read all his books published.  I usually get the book and complete reading it in a couple days.  The Ford County short stories has been sitting for weeks, I read the first two stories and I am not motivated to pick up the book and read.  Perhaps I will like it more when completed.  Now I will wait another year for the next book release, and I hope it won't be another short stories book.
B00IX9UTLU|4|As far as trashy romance novels go, I enjoyed this series tremendously.  This was a fast read.  Admittedly, the first book &#34;borrowed&#34; quite a few things from the 50 Shades series pretty blatantly.  Despite a few eye rolls, which are inevitable when reading steamy novels about heartless billionaires finding love with gorgeous women, the writing in this book was far superior to the 50 Shades series.  These books, as they should be, were a nice escape from reality.
B003ZSJ212|5|Bought this for my Grandson for Christmas, He will enjoy this over the long winter.
B00FAQW2RS|5|This box set contains all of the Atlantic era YES albums.  The versions presented here are the same as the last remasters from Rhino in 2003-2004.  I skipped those since I had bought these albums three times before (vinyl, the original CD releases and the first batch of remasters).  Although I wanted all of the cool bonus tracks included on the new releases I couldn't really justify the expense of buying all of this again.  Thankfully, this new set takes care of that problem as it is priced reasonably and includes all 62 bonus tracks!<br />Much cheaper than buying these separately.  The discs are housed in a clam shell style box with beautiful Roger Dean artwork.  They each come in a mini-LP style sleeve that faithfully reproduces the original vinyl covers.  If the vinyl had a gatefold cover, the minis will have one too, even the triple panel GOING FOR THE ONE gets reproduced here.  All of the discs have the original label art printed on them and it all looks very attractive.  As far as the remastering goes, I honestly can't tell that much difference from the previous remastering they got.  They sound very good.  The bonus tracks are a mixed bag, many are not terribly interesting but there are some gems, including some great stuff from the TORMATO sessions.  Sound quality on the bonus tracks varies from lousy to excellent.<br />The set also includes a small poster of the Roger Dean cover art.  All in all, this is exactly the box set that I have been waiting for.<br />Beautifully presented with all the bonus tracks at an affordable price.  If you combine this set with the previously released 5 disc set called ESSENTIALLY YES you will have the entire YES studio catalog (with the exception of UNION and FLY FROM HERE) in the nifty mini-LP format.  If you've already bought the Rhino remasters in their single versions then you can safely skip this one. I really love it and it was the perfect thing for me.
B002CPD5LC|5|I purchased this DVD for my father.  He loved it.  Well worth the money.  Picture and sound quality were great.
B00JVZ0DQG|4|Love it. Just wish the cats n dogs didn't cost so many keys. It is very frustrating. I cannot spend real money to buy keys for a game that is silly.

1450400957|5|I find myself agreeing with the author(s) that working out at home is better than going to the gym and I find their comments on the various excellent exercises they present to be genuinely helpful. I found, for example, a discussion of impingement syndrome (which I have suffered from for over two years) genuinely illuminating. It connects shoulder impingement with over-training of the front and lateral deltoids and under training of the rear deltoids and the infraspinatus (muscle over shoulder blade) - and it connects this syndrome with nerve compression. I have not seen such a good discussion - and after only a very short time of acting on this analysis my shoulders feel better than they have even after weeks and weeks of physical therapy. Big book, well set out, great breakdown of all the good exercises and helpful list of programmes to help you use the exercises for various purposes. This is one of the most intelligent discussions of exercise principles and one of the best selection of exercises and exercise programmes that I have discovered to date.
B00I3ULXBY|2|Not Electric Blue at all, very different color than electric blue phone.  Back is blue-tinted, too, not even clear.  Wanted to return it, but I missed my short &#34;window&#34; of return opportunity.  Not satisfied.
B00782O7IY|5|When I first heard about this movie i was a lil nervous knowing that there would be no dialogue. A 99% silent film, black and white with subtitles !!!!!! The idea seemed strange and stupid to me because so many people like me hate to read while watching movies. BUT after the first 15 minutes watching you forget the film is silent. It takes place round the late 1920's to early 30\\"s and because the film is done in silence and black and white you feel like your really watching a movie from that time period. Using unfamiliar actors for the star roles made this much easier, although John Goodman is in it. I gave this film 5 stars because it was a great film !!! It was different in every way from how movies are made today with poor dialogue relying more on visual effects to make the film entertaining. Instead this film has no dialogue and no visual effects, and your still entertained. The actors did a great job making you feel what they were feeling through expression and body language. The film really does pull you back in time with the way it was shot, and If your willing to accept the fact that its a silent film before you start watching it then i know you will enjoy it as much as i did.
B0054JZC6E|5|I love the variety offered in this app. it works really well on my device as well. I'm addicted. thanks.
B00QROI70S|5|FANTASTIC FOR THE FAMILY.
B00Y6QF0PE|5|I loved this book. I couldn't put it down. I cannot wait for the next book to come out!
B000E1155E|1|I've heard crap in my life but this right up there with the best, when did these guys start playing? the same day they recorded this crap. Anybody that knows about playing an instrument will cringe when they hear this. Is everybody in England smoking crack? This country has given us great music & muscians, Artic Monkeys does not apply to neither. This sounds like a bad garage band. Waste of money I would rather take the money and buy a hot dog and a orange soda rather than waste my hard earn money. Like the blokes would say this is pure RUBBISH!!!
B00IOVH8AW|5|Wonderful Song!
B00LXLM05I|4|Good game worth trying.
B000ZMVAXO|4|Kind of gets in the way when plugged in - need to get used to that.    Sound is good but if you want a clean sound after too much metal forget it - how much would that cost in terms of another circuit to add? 50 cents in China (oh sorry, it says made in Japan)    Oh and why include a pair of cheap junk batteries and say not to use them except to test the amp and then go buy some alkalines - why not just include a couple of Duracell instead?
B00QRULQ5K|5|I love Guardians Of The Galaxy steel book because its such a creative case and I loved adding it to my collection.  Guardians Of The Galaxy is a great movie that has loads of action and some funny lines in it too.
B00K0OI42W|5|Great read
B006WSKTPU|5|Good show, not sure I would have purchased it ever but thrilled it's free on prime :-)<br />Amazon rocks !!
B00881PTRC|2|I liked the game, but man it took my battery down so fast. I had to delete it off my phone :(
B00QW8TYWO|5|Ridiculous fun. Fast turnaround to Android.
B001152TL6|5|Add another piece of the puzzle every time you view this film.  I've seen it like 3 times and I still don't completely get it.  You can analyze it over and over and good luck by the way.  I love all the performances.  Patricia Arquette is one of my favourite actresses and her understated role in Lost Highway is restrained yet bizarre.  I liked the love sequence between her and Bill Pullman while a gothic song is playing in the background. I think it's by Dead Can Dance.  I hope David Lynch makes another weird film, he's one of my favourite directors and he needs to get to work again.
B00AB7HESI|5|I love this game. Me and my son have a blast trying to figure out what the characters need to beat it.
B00992CF6W|5|This game is awesome  because you could go to options and you could type your name.Also you could change it to easy or hard.
B004G6TD8Y|5|This is an excellent re-work of music.  It is a way to get people to expand their taste is music.  I myself, started listening to more classical pieces after hearing this album.  These are three very talented musicians and do an excellent job with this classic collection.<br /><br />Unlike the reviewer a few down, I like \\"Sir\\" Paul McCartny as he is a very good song writer with a few exceptions like \\"Temporary Secretary\\", but I am not a fanatic.  However, Emerson, Lake and Palmer are far superior as they are better musicians as well as being very good song writers.  They produce a lot of music for just three people in the band, even during live performances such as this one.<br /><br />Thank you.
B0000251VW|4|I bought this album a couple of weeks ago, and I really enjoyed it. Even though it doesn't have Nicko McBrain playing drums on it, it still is a good album. I recommend any Iron Maiden fan to buy this album.
B002MQYOFW|5|Got lost in this one I did. That's what a good fantasy novel should do. Also had severe post-Hunger Games trilogy depression because I became attached to the characters, another sign of great writing...
B00F880BWG|5|At least if you are a zombie fanatic. We caught on to this one in the first season since my wife has always loved Zombies. Great series, lots of drama, zombies and blood. What more could you ask for?
B00DJFIMW6|5|This Is the coolest game in the history of games you guys should download this game  I am just saying I am going to merry the man ho invented the minions
B00FAPF5U0|3|Fun game but you have to pay $.99 every time you want to go to another level or get help. At least on an iPad you can't earn rewards.
B00I8Q77Y0|5|Challenging in the good kinda way so I think that you should download this game if you like challenging games
B00AIUUXHC|4|Love it whoot whoot!! How can you pass the time doing something that would scare the crap out of yourself in real life?... By bein the shark that's how bam!
B000HKW7E0|5|Such a classic!  It's a family tradition to watch this one each Christmas season.  It never fails to make us laugh out loud continually.
B006QPX6IG|5|The best part of the movie, fittingly, is right in the middle - but it's all excellent. This is a long movie...and worth every minute.
B00005JLEX|5|The first DVD set (expected to be released on November 2004) will include the first two seasons, the good news is the extraordinary special features that are included! BUT the bad news is the number of episodes available in this set (only 17 episodes) which represent not more than 10% from the whole Seinfeld series!!    The first episode (Pilot) is entitled \\"Good news, Bad news\\", in this episode: \\"The first scene, Jerry and George are sitting in a restaurant having a discussion on what else? Women!! Laura, someone Jerry met on the road wants to stay with him when she comes to New York, George thinks that she is using Jerry as a contingency plan (Plan B), they continue their discussion in the laundry and they end it up in Jerry's apartment, Kramer (without making his outstanding entrance) comes to borrow some pieces of meat!! The girl calls and asks Jerry if she can stay at his apartment for the night, when she arrives she asks to stay for another night!! Everything comes on Jerry's way, and nothing could get any better, until he receives a phone call from a guy asking for the girl, Jerry hands her the phone to speak to the guy and after she hangs up, Jerry discovers the harsh truth!! the guy on the phone was the girl's fianc?!!\\"   Comments on this episode (Good news, Bad news):   ? For those who watch Seinfeld for the sake of superman, Do not waste your time looking at the refrigerator, because it's simply not there!!   ? Elaine didn't appear!  ? You will notice that George was very intelligent, smart and has a very logic way of thinking, indeed, all of these gifts that George had starts to deteriorate as time goes by!!            Some may find non-original Seinfeld DVD sets (all 180 episodes of Seinfeld on DVD) through the internet, and my advise is Don't ever think 'bout it!!!, why?  ? They're not original!!  ? The bad resolution of all these DVDs  ? You can play any DVD only for a few times, and after that!! The bad quality of such DVD shows up it's ugly head!!? Most, if not all episodes (in these DVDs), have a major defect when watching each and every one of them, in which the last 30-45 seconds are simply not there!! Either it has been deleted or not recorded!!  ? The only so-called special feature in this DVD set is the blooper DVD! don't get excited?! because there is No sound in this particular DVD!!  ? All these DVD sets, no matter where you might get them, have the same origin (same recording source)!!  The bottom line is \\"Wait, be patient and get the original DVD set from Amazon.com\\"
B002QZ399G|5|George Clooney nails this one dead on.  The academy award he received was well earned for his tremendous and moving performance.
B00DJFIMW6|1|Come on. Let me play this without Internet. Also slow on Kindle. Doesn't work&hellip; I think. Duh. Promise I'll give you 5 stars if this can run offline.
B000A59PMO|5|I knew next to nothing about Veronica Mars when I finally chose to buy it.  I am a fan of the long cancelled Firefly and among the many topics of discussion were great shows that do not get enough attention or have been cancelled.  Wonderfalls is among those cancelled, but Veronica Mars goes on.  That said, I couldn't see a \\"teen\\" show being of interest to me until I read my hundredth or so promotion raving about the great writing and characters.<br /><br />I must say that the show surpassed my expectations in all ways.  I am an avid book reader and what I love about this series is how every episode brings about both answers and new questions, which, by the end, make the whole series that much better.<br /><br />I recommend this very highly and so long as they maintain the respect and faithfullness to the quality being displayed, I hope to see Veronica Mars for many years to come.
B007UQ5Z1G|5|this cd is very much an ode to their earlier years and is a good one at that. Thanks Linkin Park for continuing to improve and reach new heights
B001J3U22S|4|if you're a dune reader you will like these books as well. you'll find little thin on some parts but worth reading
B00EY8A6BC|3|just my opinion, but it left me wanting more.  decent cast and plot, but it gets a bit weak towards the moddle and the end....too bad....decent premise, but it never gets flushed out fully
B008IJTFYW|5|this app is awesome and free I'm so happy I got it I love the thunder and rain and the crickets
B00AB65SVE|5|Love this show, and all of its characters. It's one of the best shows of the last decade. This is a must-have DVD set.
B00DJFIMW6|4|It takes a little time to load sometimes. But other than that it's a great game. I don't understand the banana.
B00HHYEOY0|5|Another great release from Beck! Love this album. Reminds me of his album Sea Change quite a bit! Beck rules!
B000003RCY|5|...is far superior to their follow-up effort, Sehnsucht.  Herzeleid  contains less techno, and goes more along the lines of straight-up metal,  with heavy guitar and bass riffs, plus one awesome drummer (Christoph  Schneider).  Till Lindemann outgrowls James Hetfield on the German vocals,  which range in topic from a twisted song about grave-robbing (Heirate  Mich), to a song about protecting yourself from heartache (Herzeleid).  All  in all, this is an excellent CD...but I must say I prefer Metallica any  day.  The only track I dislike is Seemann.  Best tracks: Herzeleid  (Heartache), Heirate Mich (Marry Me), Du Reischt So Gut (You Smell So  Good), Rammstein (Battering Ram), and Asche zu Asche (Ashes to Ashes).
1433502410|5|I like this Bible - there seem to be good notes and aids.  The only thing is that it is pretty heavy - I'm not going to be carrying it around much.
B00I8Q77Y0|5|On my kindle i really wanted to download flappy bird but this is such a great and super fun app
B003XF1XOQ|4|I enjoyed the entire trilogy!  Good clean read that kept me intrigued throughout the sorry.  The relationship challenges were a little old by book 3... but good read for families.
B00A6PD8RQ|2|Brave takes CG animation to a new level and is a visual feast, however, the story line is weak and the movie loses steam and focus just when it should crescendo.  The title is a misnomer.  The heroine isn't as brave as she is a self-centered narcissist, but that will appeal to the teenage and 20 something set for whom this mindset is normative.  But perhaps mother-daughter conflicts are just not as appealing to me as other plot devices. I was expecting something along the lines of  &#34;How to Train Your Dragon&#34;, but it falls way short.
B003B1X80Y|5|whenever I am in the mood for a good cry, i put this on...<br />Love the romance.  Love the story and the acting is great.
0307269752|5|To think I almost put this down.  Around page 160, I started to think that though I thought the writing was solid, and I liked the characters, nothing was really happening.  I read a bit further.  And then I found myself grudging the fact that I had to stop reading.  And as the conclusion approached, I grew less and less willing to read the final pages -- even as I couldn't stop reading.  The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is why we read.  Gripping. Horrifying.  Thoughtful.  Beautiful.  The sort of book to recommend to friends.  The sort of book to proudly read before most folks.  One of the best books  I have read this year.
B00SH04286|4|It didn't seem to do that well in the box office, but I thought it was pretty good. It had a good premise with good action scenes.
B0036RCVJM|3|I enjoyed the book,  a story of the horrors of the Japanese camps during the Second World War. A quite graphic account about a man who lived with his hatred of the Japanese for many years and was eventually able to come to terms with this and  his war time experiences.
B0085TKAW6|5|Excellent literature fiction. Important to have read each trilogy in order to see the development of history characters plot and appreciates the relationship to history. A great suspenseful read.
B00CYYOY5C|5|Excellent
067001690X|5|No need for me to prattle on about the worth of this book,  John Steinbeck, without doubt, one of the greatest of all American writers and with \\"The Grapes of Wrath\\" wrote one of the finest books in the English language.  I more or less grew up with Steinbeck novels as he was my father's favorite author, just edging out James Jones and John O'Hara.  So I find anything related to Steinbeck very special and this gorgeous 75th. Anniversary Edition is probably the closest I'll ever get to owning a first edition.  This Penguin-Viking edition faithfully reproduces the original including the memorable Elmer Hader  cover illustration.  Time to pass on all your old copies of this masterwork to worthy others so they can appreciate this classic of literature and invest in this beautiful new edition for yourself.  Sorry, I think I did prattle on but my love for Steinbeck knows no boundaries.
B00FAX6XQC|4|We like the game because my daughter and I can play together. Please keep making improvements thanks. Also speed up the updates.
B007HU4FZ2|5|Great movie.  Hard to imagine how cruel people can be and what our savior went through for us!
0553386697|5|The book, based on recent scientific data, helps parents in a practical way to know how to help children out of pure emotional reaction by getting on their &#34;emotional&#34; page and helping them get their &#34;reasoning&#34; brain involved. That can work for any human. Pretty cool. Plus a few informational cartoons to show you how to do it.
B000UBMSB8|5|Great movie!
B00KCUY7CU|5|I absolutely love this album! I never really knew much about Sia until her interview on Howard Stern a few weeks ago. After that, I was instantly hooked! She seems like such a genuinely, emotional person, and it really shows on this album.<br /><br />This album is a great mix of songs, so no matter what kind of mood you're in, there is something for everyone here. She has made me a HUGE fan. Now I can't wait to check out the rest of her albums!!
B002VWNICW|5|My wife had already seen the movie when I decided to purchase it. she loves the movie, probably watches at least weekly.
B0051QIGP4|5|Great album. I got in early so I didn't have download issues. A few songs took a little bit longer to come in but nothing a refresh couldn't fix.
B0058YPGSY|5|This is the best show on TV and has some of the best acting out there. Charlie Hunnam has really developed since season one. This show is so intense that you need time to decompress after each episode. This is very well cast and we are looking forward to purchasing season 5
B004GYY714|1|not regular speaker. what the h? i do not get this at all and there seems to be no way to contact company about it
B004YKSXYW|5|I would recommend this book to children and adults alike.<br />Wonderfully written, as light as one could make a book about the history of the world. The author knows just when to change up the context to keep the reader interested. I would highly recommend this book. Loved it!
B009E3EXMU|5|Must have for any Led Zeppelin fan! Would repurchase if necessary!
B003ES5ZPK|3|Very nice packaging and quality.  You can tell Amazon hand picked this to put their logo on it.  Unfortunately, because of how durable the adapter is, it turns out to be a tad bit too thick for the areas that I would like to use it.
B00000DG1R|5|\\"Duran Duran\\" I feel is one of the most underrated bands in history. These guys have cut two number one hits and numerous top twenty classics. Though they rely more on synthesizers and image more than many other bands, the music is still catchy and packs a punch to it. They have recently made a comeback of sorts with \\"Astronaunt\\", which itself is a pretty solid album. \\"Greatest\\" packs together all their hits from the 80's up to the mid 90's. <br /> <br />The CD is not ordered chronologically, but you can still tell the evolution of the band from listening to the CD. Songs like \\"Rio\\", \\"Hungry Like the Wolf\\", \\"Girls On Film\\", and \\"Planet Earth\\" were helped in popularity thanks to their very creative videos that were played back in the day non-stop on MTV. More than that though, they are strong songs that'll make you dance. \\"A View To a Kill\\" was the James Bond theme from the movie with the same name starring Roger Moore in 1985. It is a very cool song and it hit number one. The other number one, \\"The Reflex\\", is also included, though personally I find the song to get annoying and I don't like it as much as the other cuts on the CD. Other cuts from the early 80's that you probably will recognize and enjoy include \\"New Moon on Monday\\", \\"Wild Boys\\", and \\"Is There Something I Should Know\\".  <br /> <br />\\"Notorious\\" signals a transition in Duran Duran. Two of the members left the band, creating a trio. Still a strong song (sampled by the late Notorious B.I.G. in a song), it does have a different sound to it than the earlier cuts. Some of the stronger cuts in this period (the late 80's) besides \\"Notorious\\" include \\"I Don't Want Your Love\\", \\"Union of the Snake\\", and \\"Skin Trade\\". <br /> <br />The 90's were relatively a quiet period for Duran Duran, but two songs did hit the top 40 and make some noise on radio stations. \\"Ordinary World\\" sounds much more mature and mellow compared to the glam, synth driven songs of the 80's. Though it is different, I like the song a lot. It'sa pretty reflective song and a good one to listen to if you are in a thinking mood. \\"Electric Barbellia\\", a song named after a famous villiness, is the other song from the 90's. The song is a dance hit, but sounds much more modern since there are not many synthesizers used and has a more calmer sound than their dance hits from the 80's. <br /> <br />If you are a casual fan of Duran Duran and don't want to spend money on all the albums, interested in seeing what Duran Duran is about, or just looking for music to add to your 80's collection, \\"Greatest\\" is a great (no pun indeeded) album to pick up. If you have gotten into Duran Duran recently with their reunion comeback (the original five together for the first time since 1985!) and want to see what their past work is like, pick up \\"Greatest\\" to hear one of the video pioneers: musicans with synth soaked beats and lots of glam to entice their image. Ah, to be young again.
B00K9V2OPE|5|This is the second book I have read by this author. Wow! This book had me laughing and crying, sometimes all at once.<br /><br />This theme is a familiar one, so when I first saw the book, I wasn't sure I wanted to read another with the same storyline...the title made it obvious of the student-teacher love. After reading this author's first book and falling in love with her writing style, I wanted to see what she did with this theme. It was breathtaking.<br /><br />There was a lot of loss in this book, but a lot of love and laughter to go along with it.<br />There were a couple of traditional, expected events but overall, the relationships between the characters and events in the book had amazing uniqueness. Being unique in this genre is difficult.<br /><br />Daniel and Ashlyn....the couple. Only three years apart in age but...a world apart for a while. The sparks flew, the intensity was obvious, their loved shined.<br /><br />The road to the healing of their hearts was bumpy.  I loved the friendships they formed along the way. My favorite part was a show of support and love by two people who, in another book, would have had to hate Ashlyn--Ryan and Hailey... Her would be siblings. I love how they supported eachother after being thrown together.<br /><br />This book....ah...love.  Love. Promise. Promise.
B00D6QU6RW|5|Brought back memories of time spent with my daughter and the concerts we attended together. Just saw them in concert and they were awesome.
B00QH21JZK|5|Sweet remastered album! !
B004BSFSTA|3|I assure you the rubberized cable will start to peel after 1 year regardless of how well you took care of it. Other than that, the sound signature is greatly &#34;bassful&#34;, punchy and solid bass which serve great for rock and techno genre. I do find the mid to be slightly muddy and the high to be an average muddy if you are listening to acoustic. Comfort level i would grade it 5/5 because of the thick paddings and a decent quality leather cupping; you will find your ear warm after 40 minutes of usage in an air-con room.<br /><br />Now that my wires have completely eroded, I find it wasteful to just throw away the drivers. A good alternative is to detach the drivers and find a new shell for the can. Hopefully Marshall can improve the quality of their cables.
B003Y3MYWW|5|I have found some of Kocsis' concert performances rather glib and overly fast, but these recordings are right on.  The technical command is flawless, and he has a complete idiomatic feeling for the music. The piano sound has lots of color and tonal variety, and there is nothing trivial in the playing of the very easy pieces.  The Andante(1916) which was in Volume 4 of the original issues of the piano works is omitted here.
B00MRHANNI|5|Came fast and was the CD my daughter wanted. It was the perfect gift
B00701L5XS|5|Love this app, have a book about how to tie knots, but this is so much better.  You can watch how it is tied, if necessary slow the demonstration down and pause if needed.  Would highly recommend to any one interested in learning how to tie knots.
B00IG2DOKM|2|Game loads. Says update needed. When I click download takes me to Amazon page for game an says open. NOT UPDATE. So I can't play the game now.  What gives.  Fix this.
B005LAII80|4|Wasn't quite what I expected.  Not as much fun as the first.  The original has light moments in it.  This one is totally serious.  Lots of action, cool futuristic weapons and computer technology.  Liked the movie but disappointed with the ending (can't say why since that would be a spoiler).
B004J4WKTW|5|An excellent book to awaken your imagination. Full of wonderment and vivid description. It will take you on a trip to the circus. AND THIS IS NOT YOUR.  Typical RUN OF THE MILL Circus. I was sad that the book ended. o
0760748675|5|The Picture of Dorian Gray is a fine piece of literature- a tale of excess, of corruption, of decay and of facades.<br /><br />Basil Hallward, an artist, paints a picture of Dorian Gary, a handsome and vain young man, whom the artist is besotted with. Dorian Gray sells his soul for eternal youth, in a Faustian bargain, whereby all the age , decay corruption will show in the picture , while Grey's appearance will stay eternally young and fresh.<br /><br />Encouraged by the hedonistic cynic Lord Henry Wotton, Gray embarks on a life of corruption, decadence and cruelty. Lord Henry is also the vehicle through which Wilde put down his many uniquely Wildesque epigrams into the novel, such as \\" Conscience and cowardice are really the same thing, Basil. Conscience is the trade name of the firm. That is all\\"; \\" Those who are faithful know only the trivial side of love. It is the faithless who know love's tragedies\\"; \\"There is only one thing worse than being talked about and that is not being talked about\\" ; \\"The only way to get rid of temptation is to yield to it.\\" ; \\" It is better to be beautiful than to be good. But it is better to be good than to be ugly.\\" And \\" As for the virtuous poor , one can pity them of course , but one cannot possibly admire them\\".<br /><br />The bargain made by Gray can only lead to eventual destruction , and the novel is a statement by Wilde on humanity and society , in the cavalier and irreverent way that only Wilde could.
B004KKX814|5|Last time i got this it was 15:00$ no tax plus free shipping and prime but this time i got it but this time i got it,this time i wanted a new one i got this one not just no tax+free shipping+prime but this time it was 9:00$,and this is the real takara tomy version, so it`s very detailed nonfake plus it comes with cool sticker,beyblade,and Left Light Launcher LLL for short.I really recommend it!
B002OR18HQ|5|excellent music and i like the group
B00CWY76CC|5|Highly addictive!
B00BP4ZNFM|5|A great Classic.
B00PJ5AUCO|3|One thing and one thing only. How do u play it. It sounds fun but it doesn't even give any instructions! Rip of! Please do not buy the app it's dom. Just so u no. :-( telling the truth
B00AZ15WVQ|4|I had to rent this for my 8 year old son.  He loved it so much that he's begging to see Superman 2.
B00466HM28|4|Akai lives up to its name in quality. Rather it be as big as Akai custom furniture, or as small as the Akai midi keyboard for the iPhone. With 25 keys easily mapped. 8 pads x2 banks giving the user 16 pads to beat on. 8 knobs easily mapped for those awesome rotary effects. user interface is as easy as it gets. its a great buy!
B004478AS4|4|To think that school children in Africa read this poetic analysis.<br />In preparation for a week  in Africa, I think I will<br />find &#34;Things Fall Apart&#34; better than a guide book.
B00EDY5KTA|5|We loved this move, so I bought the soundtrack. I wish I could put extra stars for Let It Go though! The Idina Menzel version.
B00CDTSQZW|5|Love the show teeehee go flokie!
B00MV9TCBG|2|Not up to par... Only one or maybe two good tracks
B0041CGOZS|4|i loved the cd but it was a bit predictable. I never heard one of the songs and I found it odd that it was placed as a \\"hit\\".  It was called \\"No Apologies\\".  After going to their concert back in Feb. 2010 at the Honda Center in Anaheim, CA, I am a bit disappointed with this album.  Where is the song \\"Bounce\\"?  That was a hit and should be on the new album.  Although I appreciate the song \\"Born to Be My Baby\\" from 1990, I don't understand why \\"Runaway Train didn't make this cut.  It was a hit in '84 and even afterwards was played extensively on the radio!  After the Circle CD I am a bit disappointed in this CD because I am a huge fan of this group.
B000FA5TTW|5|A look at death that makes it anything but depressing. This book offers an interesting look at the afterlife that many hoped was possible. Relatable characters get the reader invested in the book and keep the pages turning.
B004XUMMFE|5|A humorous and fun ride with great characters!  Unfortunate that it ended! Maybe one day it will be brought back.
B00DC7NNAC|5|I don't think they could have done the movie much better. It stayed true to the style of the Wizard of Oz while at the same time making the movie feel new. It fits perfectly with the first. Loved it.
B007V2UGPE|5|Really gun but expensive I really enjoy playing when im in my squad car. Only problem is that rounds can drag on which is a good thing but not when I am being radiod.
B003TKYAVI|5|With reach coming out and its been sometime since the release of halo 3, i have become rather nostalgic for my the wonderful memories of playing the campaign and the multiplayer for hours. Literally every song on here i can see the level, i can feel the level. Yes i am a nerd so that may affect my review just a bit, but nevertheless, this album is amazing from start to finish that will leave you smiling, crying, mad, and every other emotion out there. This simply is amazing music. Well worth 8-9 bucks for 30+ songs!!!
B000XUBFE2|5|The Book Thief was a selection for my book club.  The first few pages were confusing until I determined who was telling the story.  By then I was hooked on the characters.<br /><br />The story was real and told at times through the eyes of a child.  This allows the reader to experience the circumstances of the child's life.  I was happy for the triumphs and sad during the tragedies.<br /><br />The Book Thief was an engaging and well written store and I would recommend it to anyone.
0385504209|4|I very much enjoyed this book. You will see a few one star reviews, however anytime anything is popular, and someone is dissapointed by it, they will lash out without appropriate thought or conduct. The sotry is well thought out and well written. The ending however is a little bit loose and left me feeling slightly dissapointed. I would have given this book a perfect rating if the ending had been as tight as the rest of the story, however the intrigue and mystery of the book is done a disservice by it's anti-climatic ending.
B005ZOBNOI|5|I have no way to adequately describe how I feel about this book.It was like looking at something so beautiful you could not tear your eyes away. Thank you, John Green.
B00C24B6B4|5|Beatrice is awesome!
B00005JKN9|1|Daniel Day Lewis should run away with this film, but even he is not fast enough.  He remains an absolute master of his craft, and almost surmounts the dreadful script and supporting cast.  I MUST make an exception for Leonardo Di Caprio, who has greatly improved as an actor since the appalling Titanic. The settings truly evoke old New York in the Civil War era, but that's where it ends.  WHY did they waste Liam Neeson on a role that's over before the credits begin?  As for Diaz...one can only ask Why?
B009R659L8|1|This book left me wondering if MHC is actually writing her own books anymore. I feel the publishers are taking advantage of her good name by printing garbage like this. If she wrote this she either needs to retire or hire a better editor and co-writer! The character and story development was awful! Don't waste your money! If I could get a refund I would!!
B00IRH7AKG|5|I'd give 4.5 stars, but rounded to 5 because Philip Seymour Hoffman was so good.  I only wish the movie had portrayed more of Capote's life instead of focusing so narrowly on the part of his life when he was writing in cold blood.
B0000TB01Y|5|Chenowith and Mendel are absolutely spectacular in this.  Their voices mesh well (almost too well sometimes).  Defying Gravity is spine tingling.  I'll never watch the Wizard of Oz again with the same perspective.
B00881VLCE|4|Always have enjoyed Jigsaw Puzzles .  MAGIC JIGSAW PUZZLES  APP. makes it soon easy to enjoy it on my KINDLE now.  No table to set up just my 7&quot; KINDLE FIRE.
B004DMTCNM|4|Highly improbable plot, but interesting nonetheless. Lots of action packed scenes and hardly a dull moment.  If you're looking for some entertainment, this might fit the bill.
B000002TYX|4|The Beatles' Anthology 1 is not a greatest hits collection, let me get that out of the way right now, the essence of Anthology is that you basically have a front row seat in the beatles' story of going from a rag  tag boy band sensation to the greatest artists in rock music.  Anthology 1  is not ear candy, but it shows the Beatles's on their way to success with  some pretty good live performances.  Free As a Bird is also quite a good  song, if you're a beatles fan, you'll love this record, if you're just  getting into the Beatles, go with 1962-1966 and 1967-1970, those are their  greatest hits collections and are great ones at that.  A1 is good, but for  diehards only.
B004017D1E|5|Great live show .....before his 1st retirement....
B00000DGUG|5|It's rare to catch music this wise, this frantic, and this beautiful all in the same package.  Too often folks relate Morissette's work with anger and rage, and I think the only reason this is done is because of &quot;You Oughtta Know,&quot; --certainly a classic in bitter, angry resentment, and certainly NOT her only song!  Most of her music, on both of her well-known albums, is more introspective than people seem to notice.  How are &quot;Ironic&quot; and &quot;You Live&quot; ironic?  On this album, which works better as a whole than any of its individual songs for the most part, I detect very little rage, not even towards herself.  This is a collection of works centered on self-counselling, self-awareness, simple wisdom.  <br />&quot;Junkie&quot; is a classic album which must not be forgotten.
B00R2Z3SZA|1|Without a doubt one of the worst movies I have ever encountered. I only lasted 43 minutes, but it started bad and only got worse.
B007V5CF5K|4|Colors and graphics are nice. Hopefully it's longer than some other Alawar games. But then again, I guess 99 cents is a steal.
B00BSBR9N6|5|This was a pick for our book club and when I started reading it I was not sure it would be my style.  It turns into a wonderful story.  It shows how if you open yourself up to the world you will find you are more than you ever imagined you could be
B00C8S9W0G|5|If this were the last one in the series I could live with it, it's that good. Don't want it to be the last one, though! A Must Read. Keep a hanky close by and be prepared for some shocking, tragic and also poignant moments.  Life really does move on. Its been 20 years since I've started this series and it's just as fresh and wonderful today as it was then. I finished reading this then watched the Stars production. (Which is OMG wonderful!) And it was a little surreal &#34;seeing&#34; Claire and Jamie young again after reading this last book.  If you have never read an Outlander novel you have a great journey ahead of you. If, like me,  you have been reading the series for a while...savor it. I've already read it twice and I want to read it again!
B004SD5GZ4|4|This is no desktop adobe reader, but the kindle's pdf reader... while adequate and not bad, is lacking something... Adobe is a great app to install. You'll have a PDF with some weird graphics and only adobe will render it correctly or something random like that.
B000002UY5|5|Love this CD.<br />Part of a collection of lyric driven bands that helped define the era with quality and substance, harkening back to the late 60's and early 70's singer/songwriter traditions. Too bad it didn't last!

B00FAPF5U0|5|This game is the most addictive game ever. I cant put it down. They need to come up with a C.A. group (crush anonymous).
B004H4XDBI|5|This book is amazing!!!!!  I wish there was a third book to continue out Mia's and Adam's story!! But hey, it was an amazing book!!!
B008NCSZQ8|5|I enjoyed being able to watch this movie over and over again, even my twin boys love it, I ready again
B00E8KLWB4|5|It's great!
B00H71PBQ8|5|This is a great season!  The show continues to surprise and it's so rich with complex characters!  Tune in!
B000001FMC|5|Now, &quot;Swing Out Sister&quot; actually was introduced to my music library when one summer Saturday night in the early 1990's... the cut, &quot;Twilight World&quot; was being played on a Chicago Smooth Jazz Station. Fortunately,when I first heard it,I was recording music from the station that night for personal use in my car!I kept playing that song, and I instantly knew that someday I would have to try to find it on CD! The music of SOS is fresh, never boring to me, and it takes on a new dimension as I'm going to work,to a gig,or just in the mood to &quot;Chill Out&quot;! Sometimes when I'm going to work, another single of theirs, (not on this CD, but get the CD anyway!) &quot;Get In Touch With Yourself&quot; makes an average night of driving into the &quot;Big City Lights&quot; of the &quot;Chicago Loop&quot; sparkle before your eyes! But be careful if you're driving along, and begin dancing in your seat!(people tend to look at me and wonder what I'm listening to!)Anyway... take it from the &quot;Saxman&quot;,get this CD, and perhaps you aren't familiar with &quot;SOS&quot;, but their music will make you want to groove!
0345350499|5|Bradley's Mists of Avalon is one of the best novels I've ever read; I've given it to a variety of friends with vastly different tastes in reading and everyone has loved it. Reams have been written about the Arthurian legends, but Bradley spins her tale from a different perspective--that of the women of Avalon--and creates an beautiful, enthralling novel. It's one of the few books I've never wanted to end. Her post-Mists books don't come close to this one
B003VANOFY|1|I have purchased this headset TWICE in the past only THREE months! Both of them died on me already.<br />The first was pretty much dead on arrival. Instead of going through the hassle, I ended up just reordering it.<br /><br />PRO'S:<br />It worked fine, for awhile. It's great when it does work. The headset's sound is nice, the headset is comfortable on your ears, and the mic is a really good quality as well. Having it wireless is nice to be able to walk around which is what drew to me it at first as well.<br /><br />CON'S:<br />HOWEVER, the mic CONSTANTLY disconnects itself - you will find this to be a reoccuring issue since day one. It makes a loud noise when it does reconnect that other people will  hear when you're talking to them.<br /><br />My boyfriend had this same headset, at the time his was working well so that's why I bought it off his recommendation - not long after I got my second replacement, his completely stopped charging. He was never able to fix it.<br /><br />Now, mine has does the same. (My second one! After the first was dead on arrival.) It stopped charging even lost the red light to show it's charging. Now I have two of these headsets completely dead. They will not charge.<br /><br />The disconnecting and very brief usage times makes this product unusable! I know that we are not the only ones to experience this - I have quite a few friends who have this headset who experience the same issues, but it's a popular headset simply because logitech is a great brand and people want wireless headsets which there are not many to choose from in the current market.<br /><br />I personally think this headset should not be for sale. There are way too many issues with it. I wasted $200 on these headsets and I will never make that mistake again, I only urge you all do the same and read the negative reviews (which there are many) instead of the first impression &#34;THIS IS A GREAT HEADSET!&#34; review! Don't make my mistake!!
B005K01VZS|5|Intriguing , life questioning .. The basis of Mitch Albom's books. This one no different. Will make you approach each day we are blessed with, in a different way.
B00005LC1H|5|I have had this DVD collection for a couple of years.  I bought it for a friend who had recently developed a 'taste' for British humor.  I told him this will be a feast.  He was not disappointed.<br /><br />I don't think there could've been any TV series more satisfying that Fawlty Towers.  After rewatching these episodes over and over, I still marvel at their story structure and the brilliant comedic situations they managed to come up with.  My personal favorites are 'Communications Problems' and 'The Psychiatrist'.  In addition to the brilliance of John Cleese, the casting of the supportive players was pure genius.<br /><br />These episodes are now over 30 years old, but they still beat anything on TV today.  That's a pretty strong testament to the writing of this classic series.
B002ZG99TK|5|Denzel is in it. Need I say more?
B0000669JL|5|Better than I expected, not one single clinker.  Of course, with Bob Marley, there never is. EXCELLENT, quality sound.
B000G6R7B8|4|Whilst the colour scheme is not the best the body and movement has served as a great platform for modification with plenty of parts available.
B00E8KLWB4|5|Fun and brain food. The game helps me focus on the details and build my attention. I totally love it.
B000059TEQ|4|I'm as tough as they come, but even I got choked up over the plot.  I wish I could find a woman to love me as much.
B004O3YGMC|5|if your thinking of getting this u should its just amazing except for one minor problem when u first log on the actual computer screen gets smaller but all you have to do is right click on background and go to screen resolution and make the resolution at 1366x768 I hope this answers some peoples problems :)
0307341550|5|Okay, a while back I bought Sharp Objects at a yard sale. It sat on my bookshelf for some time, until one day I picked it up, flipped through some pages and decided to read it. This book blew my mind!! I could not put it down! The twists and turns in this novel are epic and it gets even more sweeter towards the end. This is such a terrific novel I had to read it twice! And probably will again. Gillian Flynn is an amazing author. I can't wait to read her second book. The only regret that I have, is not picking this book up sooner!!
B00006RU5B|5|Chris Cornell has such a distinct voice.  I could listen to Stone over and over all day and not get sick of it.
B00DHKKN6Q|4|This game is fun.
B000E6UK5K|2|I should have listened to the sample tracks before I bought this album. It is Pink Floyd-ish elevator music. Not one piece stands out.  Every song sounds very much like the others. No song has any kick or bite.  Later I discovered that the songs on this album are also on the [[ASIN:B001BKG9RQ Live In Gdansk (2 CD)]] album (CD #1), which is a 2 CD album.  I love CD #2 on Live at Gdansk.
B000FL7CAK|5|So sick of one reality show after another.  This made for good entertainment.  Too bad it was cancelled.  Talk of bringing it back too late

B000002BFZ|2|After the monster success of their first three albums, Pearl Jam did the time honored tradition of recording a self indulgent, non-commercial album that's more for themselves than their audience.  The band is to be applauded for branching out and stretching themselves, but as with most bands, they would have been better off sticking to what they do best.  The band is influenced by Neil Young, especially his work with Crazy Horse.  The band tries to ape the sound of Mr. Young's work from Rust Never Sleeps on &quot;Red Mosquito&quot; and &quot;Smile&quot; but they come across as bad imitations.  They go curiously into a world beat sound on the &quot;Who You Are&quot; (flip flopping the title of another major influence, The Who's &quot;Who Are You&quot;) and &quot;In My Tree&quot;.  The latter song is particular bad.  Stone Gossard steps in front of the microphone to sing &quot;Mankind&quot; and he shows why he is the band's lead guitarist.  The album is not without its merits. &quot;Hail Hail&quot; ranks as one the band's all-time best songs with its driving guitars and powerful Eddie Vedder vocals and &quot;Lukin&quot; is another strong rocker.  Many people love this album for its eclectic nature and the fact that it doesn't sound like anything else the band has ever done.  That's the problem No Code suffers from, it doesn't sound like a Pearl Jam record.
B00FAPF5U0|4|Fun way to pass time away!

B00LP1MVSW|5|Just what I was looking for
0385523394|4|Review based on ARC.<br /><br />This is one of those books that was entertaining, informative, and infuriating.  Piper Kerman wrote a memoir that reads almost like a diary.  This is both a compliment and a criticism.  The problem with the non-diary-diary format is that it was scattered, unfocused, and anecdotal.  The good thing about the non-diary-diary format, however, is that it was interesting, personal, and present.<br /><br />So, the story.  Kerman makes massively stupid and selfish decisions in her young life, as young ladies are wont to do, and years later, she begins to pay for it.  a little.  Her involvement in large-scale drug trafficking ultimately lands her in inside a minimum security federal prison, which she proceeds to detail in a manner that is, at turns, entertaining and lecturing.  There's not really much more to the plot:  she learns about being in prison, she learns about the people there, she learns about the impact of her actions.  Thus, a memoir.<br /><br />What works is Kerman's tone, most of the time.  She takes an equally amusing and reverent tone in describing her prison-mates and describes heartbreaking, enraging, and amusing stories alike.  Kerman's own appearance and naivety land her, fortunately, friends with some of the more powerful women in the prison and, to hear Kerman tell it, she herself ends up being one of the most popular prisoners to ever grace Danbury's walls (this is a literal exaggeration of the tone that many of the anecdotes presented -- she never, of course, ever states anything quite so ludicrous).<br /><br />Kerman flits between anecdotes, grand philosophical rants, political lectures, and summaries, which unorganized presentation was, at many points, annoying and disrupted the flow of the tale.  However, Kerman's voice was consistent throughout these variances, making the sudden switches more tolerable to read.<br /><br />Kerman mentions in passing that her year had its rough moments... but aside from dealing with her Grandmother's illness, stays far on the surface of these times.  Which leads the reader to believe that her time in Danbury wasn't so bad--that maybe she was just a \\"whiney privileged white girl.\\"  In reality, there were probably times when it was terrible for *her* (and not just one of the other girls there), and maybe she didn't want to relive those in her memoir.  Or maybe she didn't want to be too depressing for her readers.  Or maybe just being incapable of leaving the walls for such an extended period of time was rough.  She managed to remain a picky eater, looked years younger after LEAVING prison, worked out, got a lot of daytime, watched movies, had friends.... yeah, I know a lot of girls who'd kill for her crappy year.  But, as I say, maybe there was some stuff under the surface that she didn't divulge.<br /><br />All in all, the book gets THREE AND A HALF stars (bumped to 4 on non-half-star sites for its importance) because Kerman tells a good story and creates a few vivid characters (though a few others are glaringly 2-dimensional), and because the story she is telling and the impact it has had and can have is important.  Important!  For any person who knows no-one who has been to jail or prison (even a \\"swanky\\" minimum security prison like Danbury), or anyone who thinks that prisoners cannot be rehabilitated and/or do not have any good in them, this book is a MUST.<br /><br />For the rest of us who've had harder lives, I say go ahead and read it if it sounds interesting.  It certainly is not a bad book and, even though it's a bit disorganized, it tells an interesting story.<br /><br />**side note: I am both interested in watching the tv show to see some of the characters come to life, and adamantly opposed in case my fears that it has created caricatures of very real people's lives, pain, and struggles are justified.<br /><br />This and other reviews can be found at AllBookReviewer.blogspot.comher Grandmother's illness, stays far on the surface of these times.

B00092ZMDY|2|Cannot view DVD (US regio1) on european DVD players (EU regio 2), and had to sent it back.
B00BD99JMW|5|Great young adult series.  As good as Hunger Games, I felt.  The story kept me wanting more and the chapters were told in first party, switching back and forth between Tobias and Beatrice.
B004T4LUPW|5|I run it on my Kindle Fire HD 8.9 and it works very nicely. It syncs very quickly and reliably and I can edit all events on my computer's apps and on this and no events are duplicated or lost. I am happy with it. (I am using it only a few days, so it is quite early to make a conclusion. May be, I will find some issues in the future).

B00B7Y0206|1|This app is completely bad. You can't watch a full minute without it stopping. I waited two minutes to load the video, and i only got 15 seconds of it until it stops. You also can't view channels without having an account. You can't see their videos or anything. The search part is also bad. Now that there is no m.youtube for kindle, i can no longer watch YouTube over all. Thanks, app!
B00I8Q77Y0|5|It's is so much fun and its just like Flappy bird but better because it poops and its so funny and fun.
0790733226|4|Contact is a terrific film on many levels: superficially it's beautifully photographed with ace special effects - many of them I didn't realise were special effects at all until I watched the little feature about how they were made, which surely is the acid test of how good they are.<br />Jodie Foster's performance as a slightly geeky (but secrety rather attractive) scientist is spot on, especially her cheeky rendition of Sagan's own goofy accent, but the remaining characters are cartoonish and a bit theme-functional: for once, the bimbo is a bloke - that Matthew McConaughey's hokey priest is Foster's love interest and intellectual adversary fits nicely with the battle of intellect vs. emotion which is waged throughout the film, but as a credible character he just doesn't stack up. The same is true of Tom Skerrit's Big Bad Boss Who's Only In It For The Glory.<br />For all that, you're certainly left mulling over the notion of contact, in all its manifestations (you know, with little green men, with other human beings, with your lost father, with your spiritual side etc.) throughout, and given that the author of the screenplay was a thoroughly scientific and sceptical chap, the final message is one of surprising humility and irony.<br />Ostensibly the conflict is between science (which needs to know The Truth, whatever the religious consequences) and blind faith. But when the arch-sceptic finally establishes (...or does she?) her argument, can she prove it to a sceptical public?  Quelle dilemma! Lesson learned!
B009ZQC7MY|5|This is a show that gives you such rich characters and story lines.  I really appreciate it.  In the day and age of empty, souless reality TV, it makes me me quality programming and I found it in Downton Abbey.
B00Y6QF0PE|5|Loved to see Grey's version, can't wait for the next book to come out!! Thanks for writing this book EL James.
B00008NG5V|4|This CD hits it's highs with Traffic in the Sky and the last two songs Mediorce Bad Guy, and Symbol in My Driveway.  The songs are little less poppie (if that's even a word) than the first, and the songwriting is better to me.  I like the mood this album as taken as well over the first.  I can't wait to hear more out of Jack Johson.
B009E3EY38|5|Amazing performance on all levels.  Love it !  The surprise was how great Plant's voice was throughout the performance.  Of course, Page's playing was amazing (as was everyone else). Long live Led Zeppelin !

B00CL0J99K|1|First off, I really like the idea for Iron man 3! I was looking forward to this villain! Come on, its the freaking Mandarin!<br /><br />I was looking forward to the idea of mad/genius scientist againts Toney Stark ideas. Battle of conflicks. Mandarin I'm talking about also have 10 power rings! That could come from the alien technology of a crashed space ship. Each ring has a different power and placed on each finger!<br /><br />No What we got is a some poor sho, from the streets, drunk and partying with many booze and women... Boring! Well, not the women part!<br /><br />Movie ok just by itself, but I don't know about you. But I'm tried of movies productions killing off villains and list is very long! Only villain that I can think of that got away to bring back chaos is Cobra Commander in the GI JOE movie! Go fig? Two, Movie productions making the villains very lane lane lane lane lane... Could I say more. But wait there been a few villains that, with rewrite was brought out even better... Thats another story...<br /><br />Still, this is Iron man don't care if its the 1st 2nd or 3rd, Robert Downey, Jr, plays Tony very good. I give cridet where credit is due! Keep up the good work. Just wish that the villians from all your movies in Iron man was not so lane. Even though the actors play their parts very well. It was the story line that failed.<br /><br />No the blame has to go to the writers! And moive prduction dirctors! For there lack of in sight. There a diffient between a good movie and a great.
B00992CF6W|5|you should play this every day this is the only thing I love I play it every day. buy this app buy this app! its the coolest thing in the world!
B00005O5CM|5|Isn't there that joke, &quot;Dumb Blonde&quot;?<br />The movie Legally Blonde will prove that little phrase otherwise.<BR>In this movie, the glamorous blonde Elle Woods(Reese Witherspoon) goes to Harvard to win her ex-boyfriend who dumped her because he thought she wasn't smart enough.  Elle trying to get the love of her life back goes to Harvard to prove that she isn't dumb.  When she gets to Harvard, she finds out that her ex-boyfriend is engaged to this girl, Vivian.<br />Elle goes to do manicure and do her hair to get rid of her sadness.  Did this work? Well, kind of.  She just gets by each day until the party that Vivian had one day.  She is told by Warner at that party that she wasn't smart enough to be in Harvard.  Elle proves it wrong by starting to study hard and actually succeeding in class!<br />This movie shows how facts about a girl's life such as how to get your hair permed, keeping in the latest style helps Elle win an important case.<br />In the end, Elle dumps Warner, her ex-boyfriend, when he proposes to her and dates another guy(Luke Wilson) whom I can't seem to remember the name.<br />In all, this is a hilarious movie worth watching.  You can see that the people who actually enjoys their life sometimes have more success and that blondes are not always dumb.

0486409511|5|First to Eleanor--thank you thank you thank you! For giving me a handwriting style that will last centuries yet. <br /> <br />Ahem... Copperplate hand is beautiful, and instead of having to guess how to go about making it right from a one-page sample, you have a kind and considerate teacher walk you through a complete tutorial in a real-world classroom pace--with every intention of actually passing down this beautiful hand--warts and elegance--all--from her years of experience into your fingers. This text will be your guide to teaching future generations this beautiful hand. I am honored to have found this book and even more honored to have the chance to learn this hand from a true master. I hope you will find it, as I did, that her tone is considerate, experienced, and helpful every step of the way--she made _every_ _word_ _count_. She will never bore you. <br /> <br />At this moment I plan to work on this hand whenever I take notes. I have a Namiki/Pilot Vanishing Point fountain pen, and although the default nib cannot vary stroke width through pressure--it's a hard nib--I have every intention of enjoying the styling of copperplate in my everyday writings. Like any others who have recently rediscovered the pleasure of writing a journal, I am using a fountain pen or a roller ball on a Moleskine brand notepad. There are many blogs and online write-ups helping you get into this fun activity. Check them out. But I realize I need a cursive hand to work on, otherwise my handwriting would remain illegible! But thanks to Ms. Winters--I am saved! <br />
1476753180|5|Colleen Hoover has an ability to write stories that always and I mean ALWAYS punch you right in the gut and pull at your heart! A true talent. Ugly Love was such an emotional love story that will forever remain at the top of one of my favorites!
B000JMKRKC|5|A great read, just a tad slow in the middle...but still couldnt put it down. It is a thriller, a ghost story
B001IBIHQ4|5|I'd been wanting to see this series since I'm too cheap to subscribe to HBO and I prefer to wait until these series come out on DVD so that I can have a group video session where we can watch as many episodes as possible and get the continuity that allows.  Although written-directed-produced by basically the same people as Band of Brothers, and about the same overall conflict, Pacific is unique on many levels largely because the Pacific Theater of Operations (PTO) was a completely different type of warfare.  I won't belabor my review with an explanation of this, but suffice it to say, it has a completely different \\"feel\\" than BofB; not any less of a production, maybe even better, but different mood all together.      One should be prepared for a different type of warfare being waged by a different enemy.  For a prelude, I would recommend reading \\"Flyboys\\" by James Bradley in order to have an understanding behind the type of warfare that was waged in the Pacific by Allied forces against the Empire of Japan.  Much has been written about this conflict, but little has addressed the causes of the war and why the war was so brutal from the perspective of both sides.    That being said, \\"Pacific\\" is a great series to own because, at least for me, I missed a lot during the first viewing sort of like Band of Brothers, which I've viewed probably 40-50 times, and learn some new detail each time.  I found it hard to retain the names and significane of the people being portrayed after only one viewing and I remembered that only after watching BofB multiple times was I able to retain a comfort with who each person was and what they contributed to the conflict.    Highly recommended!
B008Y5NGG8|2|Pretty boring.  I don't feel it delved deep enough into their tumultuous relationship.
B00BLCHYKU|4|It will be interesting to see how the season plays out, but so far this show is very compelling, beautifully captured and original.
B000E6ET1G|5|This CD has some great songs on it, many of them obscure. Some of the garage bands' original songs sound like covers of tunes by the Beatles, Bob Dylan, etc. Some sound musically as good, if not better than the copied artists. I also found several musicians in these groups that went on to later play with groups who found much greater success in the music business.
B0095P33IW|5|A lot more depth than you expect for a movie based on a comic book. The story contained the right ethos for a Captain America movie. I wish the director here (Joe Johnston) had been chosen to do the new Superman.

0446530891|5|Baldacci's great gift is his involving characters and plots that keep you guessing until the end.  But they are never cheap or contrived -- every revelation has been planted in the plot.  I love his work and this book does his reputation justice.
B0064TVQ5E|4|good game but tiles are small. would be better on yhe bigger screen. still very playable and a lot of fun
B00PSLQYWE|5|Great show  , too bad it is over.
B007Z8ZKS2|5|I couldn't put I down, loved it!!
B001CTDH76|5|Really incredibly put together cast with excellent story line through each episode and through the whole season. I cant put it away once I start it
B00SH04286|3|I would give it two stars, but for some reason my wife thought it should get 4 stars. So I averaged it to three. I'm a big SciFi fan and expected much more from the movie. But most of it was preposterous. On the other hand my wife thought it was entertaining and held her interest throughout, and she loved that it was only 90 minutes long :-). Actually, I think that being only 90 minutes long is what doomed it for me because they forced her transition from a loser to the most brilliant, all-knowing and powerful person in the universe in about six minutes.
0618526412|5|I first read this book as a teenager and I have read it again several times over the years.  There is something so deeply revealing about the human condition in the book.  It is as meaningful to me in my sixties and it was in my teens - I think that something is perhaps a window into the angst of the human condition.  I have read all of Carson McCuller's works, including the ones out of print.
B00I2TV3NO|5|I really enjoyed this movie. I can't wait to see the next one.
1451666179|5|I've enjoyed the Hyperbole and a Half web column for a long time. This book has some favorites from there and new stuff, too. I thouroughly enjoyed re-reading the pieces I was familiar with, as well as the new ones,  and then sharing them with family and friends in book form.
B00CE3IC74|3|So my initial impressions of these tags are with two Samsung Galaxy devices: the Note 3 and the S3. They both are running with the Samsung Tech Tiles app. They both suffered the same limitation: even when the memory of the tag was showing less than full, if the number of instructions/settings (simple settings of the wireless, Bluetooth, brightness, ringtone, etc.) were too large, these tags refused to be written to, or gave an error that the tag could not be written to. Once I removed the bulk of the instructions to maybe about 4 settings, then the tag would take being written to by the app. I've not been patient enough to determine what the &#34;sweet spot&#34; number of instructions this tag takes, but so far it's too few, IMHO.<br /><br />I don't know if this an app limitation, or this is an issue with the tag being too slow, but this is a bit annoying to be limited when there are so many other settings I'd like to write. If anyone has any suggestions, I'll try them and update this review.<br /><br />The tags themselves are good; so much tougher and brighter than the paper-thin Samsung smart tiles. Once written to, they work as expected. Now if I can only write more instructions to them.
B008602KQI|3|Nice start though a little slow and then into the start of the game was very engrossing.  Then somewhere around the two third mark the movie lost it's way and tried to be to many things.  Would she be a hero, who did she really love, was she a leader, was she the real winner or was it handed to her for political reasons etc... .<br /><br />The movie suffers from bad timing and direction.
B00RNRD8RA|4|Overall humorous.
B002RKSZS0|5|I love this story. I especially love how, at times, the author speaks directly to the reader. It adds an interesting element!
B00RNRD7Y4|1|Dont know what the hype was all about!! Wasted money!!!
0802473156|5|Great Book !!!  Read this book before you enter into another relationship !!!  It's right on the money !!!
1586210912|3|Hello, I just want to clarify some misconceptions made within the book concerning the author's poor father. First, one fact the author does not mention that he mentioned in a previous book that he wrote, was that he lost his dad's retirement money in a business venture that had failed many years before this book was even written. The reason why his father was broke when he reached retirement age was because he let his son use his money and his son had lost it all. <BR>Secondly, his poor father was an incredibly brilliant and smart man, but I don't think his father was motivated as much by money as the author's rich father. The author's poor father was an educator who decided early on to dedicate his life towards educating people. For example, most priests die poor and penniless only because they were not focused so much on making money as they were on dedicating their lives to God. I am sure if the poor dad was focused on making money he too would have been incredibly rich probably even more so than the rich father since he was probably just as disciplined and even smarter. <br />But, I would like to say thank you to the poor father for his dedication to the bettermnent of education. I am actually impressed that he would dedicate his life to promoting and improving the knowledge in today's educational system. That to me is the ultimate in public service and should be commended.
B00JFKEQBK|5|My favorite game!
B00IJJUIMY|5|One of Michael Connelly's best. Not too thrilled about the Kindle price but the book was worth the price. Hope this is not the last Harry Bosch book
B00PTB7B34|5|It is very easy and fun to play. The combat in it is really cool. I would recommend it to anyone
B00M7URUUE|2|Looking for a more &#34;Biblical&#34; version but it WAS entertaining...
B000002GK1|4|This is a very impressive debut from a clearly musically talented band.  They remind me a little of Black Sabbath and yet they do have a slightly different twist to their sound enough to make them sound uniquely themselves.  Track 6 is one example of this as it shows they can be very hard and yet have a melodious side as well.  The guitarist is very good though not quite in the Tony Iommi league as yet but still he plays very interesting chops.  The lead singer has a much better voice than Ozzie though.  I only gave 4 stars because I suppose for an unremastered disc the sound is okay but after 14 years, it really is about time they cleaned up the sound.  Overall, a rather decent disc.
B000GIXEIG|5|This movie was remade in the new CGI green screen technique just recently.But despite that this version is the best of them all, in my opinion.<br />Gerard Butler, famed for his roles in \\"300\\", \\"Dracula 2000\\", \\"The Phantom of the Opera\\"(where it's really him singing the lead role), \\"P.S. I love you\\" , to name just a few of the projects to his credit, brings the character of Beowulf to life.<br /><br />A poignant message film on so many levels it's worth every penny to add to your personal DVD collection. The scenery is magnificent, the actors very real in their portrayals, it's a superb film that you can watch again and again while seeing new things not only in the film but in the timeless message it contains; no matter how it looks we shall always suffer as people,  if we take our prejudices as a right to relate to one another just at face value.
B00BN2NY48|4|Great performance and kept me at the edge of my seat. Costumes were amazing and full of colors. Incredible acrobats
B00KA7JIII|5|Beautiful game, fantastic music and game play! Probably one of the most relaxing and challenging game.
B008B68IEA|3|But it was not worth the money.  Just an overpriced, cheap to manufacture piece of plastic.  If your kids are into Monster High, you may enjoy it.
B000002O1Q|4|The movie wasn't that bad. The Music was great. A soundtrack for the ages, with music that transport you to the fictional time the movie required.<br />Great CD music.
B001TOD9VI|5|liked it  alot
B0040UAYI4|2|Not a \\"pro\\" gamer like some who've reviewed this product but came up through the ranks playing Doom, Quake and UT all the way to COD and BF2 titles on the PC. Got this to run BF2 Bad Company on the PS3 and my first pickle was using the repair tool to fix the jeep in the training level. Acted strangely and would only hook up on the Hummer to repair for abut 1 second out of like every 120. I jumped all over the vehicle and ran around it until my finger got tired.<br /> I got around this by using the regular controller and saving. Then I had to jump in the  Hummer and drive. Wrong ... Nothing mapped would control the vehicle. OK ... Maybe this works well with other games that don't have the vehicles that the BF series does, but that's my game of choice. I think Sony needs to pull their heads out and market a Keyboard and Mouse that doesn't need a conversion. Perhaps I should have looked into a Firmware patch or something, but I have gotten to the point where I'm tired of farting around with devices that should work as advertised, period. Not Ohh with this game and this configuration and with that patch and Ohh well you can do this but not do that...<br />So yes, this is as close as it gets to real PC action and if you want to fart with setting it up a little differently for different games and reconfiguring it all the time, then it will probably work for you. For me it was easier to go back to the PS3 controller and when I want to WASD just go back in and sit at my Quad Core with the NVIDIA GTX 470 and killer response time.
B008PZ69T8|3|I was overcome with the books. And knew the tastes were different but felt like I were at church or an opera which neither I tolerate.  I will be passing on to my dad who I think will get more out of this.
B00005BJ2O|4|I LOVE THIS MOVIE! IT IS ONE WILD RIDE AND THE SOUNDTRACK IS JUST ABOUT TOPS TOO! A FEW MUSICAL SNIPPETS ARE A BIT POINTLESS BUT KIDMAN SOUNDS WONDERFUL AND MCGREGOR IS JUST SMASHING...NOT ONLY DOES HE GIVE THE BEST PERFORMANCE IN THE FILM BUT THE MAN CAN SING...WHO KNEW?
B0000TB050|5|This DVD is interesting because it is a look at U2 from a very different angle than fans have had before. Sure, it's another concert DVD, but the fact that it is filmed in front of such a large hometown crowd completely changes the dynamic and feel of the entire experience. How would they change the show to fit with their original and most loyal fan base?  Well, from the beginning it feels as if the band knows every single person in the audience. Yep, all 200,000 or however many of them there were. There's a palpable and tangible familiarity that is captured on this film, and Bono especially takes full advantage of it. You would be hard-pressed to find a more involved and devoted crowd, as they had been waiting all day for U2 to come one after many other acts.   As other reviewers have noted, Bono's father Paul Hewson passed away just days before this concert was filmed. So one gets the sense that this show was poised for emotional greatness, with so many different events converging: playing at home, a massive crowd, the death of Bono's father, and a tour that had become a steamrolling success, building in momentum with each stop.   Without going through each track, I will say that this DVD can't really be compared to the Boston DVD. Boston was filmed in an arena, with a much smaller crowd, and a different setlist. This DVD was filmed in Ireland, outdoors, in front of almost 200,000 people. Neither is superior to the other, simply because they are so different.   This particular concert has an exquisite setlist, with the highlight for me being All I Want Is You (dedicated to Bono's wife Ali) transitioning into Where The Streets Have No Name. This is simply an explosion of power and emotion, and the energy is passed from Bono, through the entire crowd, and back into him and the band. An unforgettable moment, and one that you will certainly replay numerous times on this DVD. Angel of Harlem is also great to hear live, as is One, which they rarely play anymore. For someone who is so intensely private about his family, Bono does mention his wife and also brings his daughter Eve up on stage during the bonus track (Mysterious Ways).   The one comparison I will make to the Boston DVD pertains to the respective performances of Bullet The Blue Sky. The Boston performance of this song is absolutely mind-blowing, incendiary and devastating, due to Bono's improvisation toward the end. It seems that the arena is ready to explode trying to hold in the energy. This is lacking somewhat on the Ireland performance, which also contains different references that aren't USA-specific. I personally like the Boston performance more, but Sinead O'Connor does a beautiful intro on the Ireland performance.   Overall, this is a DVD that you will watch over and over, and it complements the Boston DVD, rather than taking anything away from it.
B0089EHWQE|4|Love the descriptions and the story. Looking forward to the movie.  Slow in the beginning and then I couldn't wait to finish.
B00004T9UF|5|When I buyed this album I wasn't expecting a lot, since the 1 album only had some 6 or 7 songs that I liked, but since the first track I was  impressed, songs like Stan really show everybody that Eminem really knows  how to do music, and the song The real slim shady makes you want to play it  over and over, the song Kim is really dark and Eminem sounds really  maniatical, his multiple personalities (Ken Kaniff, Slim Shady, EMINEM, and  his real name Marshall Mathers) appear like on the other cd but this time  is 10 times better, on the song Marshall Mathers he sees the reality of his  life and everybody's life's, on this days where rap albums really suck,  this is a masterpiece, I even like this better than the Dr. Dre 2001 cd, he  didn't disappoint at all
B00B2DSK06|4|This movie was so Awesome and it had a great plot I also liked how the main character was cool in the end.

B00AGOGOLE|5|This app is amazing anywhere.. on the go or your juss bored. When your really bored you can juss use your camera .
B0087ITBPC|5|I found myself wondering thru 90% of this movie , \\"How in the world did they get Barbra to do this\\" ?  Then the end rolled around and it was so clear.  Well done delivered a great message (which I won't spoil). After reading many of the other reviews here on Amazon, I couldn't help but come back to add a comment.  This movie (in my opinion) is so much more than a Mother/Son flick. Am I the only one who was hit over the head with such a powerful message? I know I can't be the only guy in the world that wonders how or if my life had actually touched another's.
B006IGZWB2|5|My husband & I watched this movie over the weekend. I was pleasantly surprised as I had purchased & recorded it for myself, figuring it would be a \\"chick flick\\" that my husband wouldn't be interested in. However he ended up watching the movie with me & we both really enjoyed it, as a matter of fact he requested I keep the recording instead of deleting like we normally would.    I have read many reviews of the movie & book & while most are glowing reviews there, as always, are naysayers as well. It seems that most of the complaints have had to do with not going into enough detail with serious issues that were going on at the time. Yes there were serious issues that were happening & there have also been many books & movies that have dealt with things that were happening at the time. However I think that it has a pretty accurate portrayal of how life actually occurs. When there are issues taking place in the world is that all you talk about & focus on in every day life? Not most people, there are serious issues going on now. Does everyone spend all day, every day talking about the war in Iraq or Afghanistan?? Do we spend all of our time talking about & focusing on the awful mess our country is in financially? No because as much as it may concern us we have our lives to live. Working, raising children, making dinner etc. We can't spend all day every day dwelling on it & we spend time with our friends having fun & laughing. So yes while it does skim over the seriousness of the Civil Rights movement taking place at the time, that is not what the movie/book is supposed to be about or claims to be about. It simply states that it is SET in the time period. It is meant to be about the black maids & that's what it is. Skeeter, while the main character, is not meant to be a heroine. She is simply a writer trying to make her way after college & thinks the story of the help will be a good one. No not all of the characters are deeply developed but since when are ALL of the characters ever fully developed? There are always people who drift in & out of any story, some we could do without & some that we wish would get more time.    Other complaints were things like telling Skeeter's problems & trying to put them on par with what the maids went through. I don't think it did this at all, it just simply was showing that we all have troubles. You & I might not have the same problems does that mean that mine or yours are any less meaningful? I think that many people writing awful reviews expected something different & when that's not what they got were very upset.    Over all I would have to say that this movie is about the relationships between black women & white women set in the early '60's. It shows the good & the bad, there are hard times & there are laughs along the way. It is in no way a historical reference to the civil rights' movement. If you are looking to watch a movie that will make you shake your head, laugh & maybe even cry then you will enjoy this movie.
B004Y1USV2|5|I really love this new album, especially the title track. The more I listen to it, the more I love it. It's been a while since the band created an epic piece and it was really nice of them to revisit and update and expand upon this little nugget from 31 years ago. I love the whole of the piece, not just one particular part of it.<br /><br />Great playing by all and great vocals by Benoit David. He seems to sound like a hybird of both Jon Anderson and Trevor Horn on this album, but it's not a bad thing.<br /><br />\\"The Man You Always Wanted Me To Be,\\" although it's a long title, is a beautiful song wonderfully sung by Chris Squire and has a little nod to \\"Don't Go\\" from Magnification just before the chorus begins. This seems like a track that could've been on Fish Out Of Water or either COnspiracy album. Great song.<br /><br />\\"Life On A Film Set\\" is my favorite song on the album aside from the title track and it seems to be in two parts: the first part having something of a cold, dark feel with somber acoustic guitar and melancholy vocals and then turning into a bright, sunny, Yessy feel in the middle of it and then just stomping at the end. Did I hear some sort of a horn (no, not Trevor) near the end of the track? Hmm. It's still a great song.<br /><br />\\"Hour Of Need\\" is a folky is another great song that should also be released as a single, if such would be possible. Steve and Benoit's voices blend together in a magnificent way and the song is beautiful and melodic. I prefer the regular version over the Japanese-only bonus track version of the song.<br /><br />There's quite a bit of acoustic guitar work from Steve on this release and \\"Solitaire\\" is a brilliant little acoustic ditty as good as \\"Mood For A Day\\" or even \\"Masquerade.\\"<br /><br />\\"Into the Storm\\" is a great, dynamic song highly reminiscent of \\"On The Silent Wings Of Freedom\\" from Tormato and \\"Tempus Fugit\\" from Drama with a cool 7/4 middle section in it and excellent vocal harmonies from the band. It's a great finale<br /><br />This isn't an album that's very heavy on bass or keyboard solos, and Steve doesn't solo as much as he's done in the past, but it's not necessarily a bad thing. This album is representative as the band playing as a band, for the most part. It's something fresh from this new Yes. I really enjoy this new album and I hope the next one is not too far around the corner. Please work with Trevor again on the next one, guys!<br /><br />Yes is a band. It's not about one particular member, although all of them in one way or another contributed greatly to the history of one of the world's greatest and most dysfunctional rock bands. Yes, it's sad that Jon isn't in the band anymore, but even if he were back in the band, would we have a new album? I highly doubt that. I mean no disrespect to Jon by that comment.

B005DF2QMC|1|I bought this item for my dad for Father's day and it turned out to be the worst present ever.<br />It looked to be in nice condition but when we played cassettes on there the voice quality was horrible. It sounded like the sound was being slowed down and stretched. We played the cassettes back on my boombox it played fine so we know it was not the cassettes fault.

B003K15IF8|5|As an English instructor, I found this novel to be engaging and fascinating. The narrative voice was detached from the characters but still made them come to life, and what seemed at the beginning to be a book that was unlikely to hold my interest became a story I couldn't put down. Interesting view of life at the time (early 20th century) and of the politics of academia.
B001OQCV6K|5|Good movie if you're a downey fan.  Some people don't like the movie but it's good for the casual viewer.
0375869026|5|It's a great read whether you're old or young.  The story is moving and inspiring.  You'll be glad you read it.
0061122416|5|I was not put off by the simplistic language and story--they are little more than a medium to convey the author's ideology and do a fine job of that. Read the book to be inspired to take charge of your life.
B00020X88O|4|Showgirls is one one of the most universally panned movies of the nineties. Everybody hates it, or laughs at it.<br />Frankly, I don't know why. Or rather, I do know why, and it is not because it is bad. OK, granted, it is pretty bad when you consider some of the acting, and most of the story. But how many movies is this not true for? Certainly it is no worse than most action flicks, and you don't see Jean-Claude van Damme being drop-kicked all over Hollywood.<br />The thing is that this film is obviously eye candy. And today you cannot be politically correct and not attack something like that. I notice that it moved straight to the third place nationally when it came out on video, and that it has an average rank of four out of fives stars with the audience at Amazon. Critics; can't live with them.<br />See it for the girls. What girls! They can even move. Elizabeth Berkley's moves are smoking sexy.<br />And that's all I have to say about that... (Lahf is lahk a box of chokolates.)

1451629184|5|Received this memoir on Tuesday and finished it in 1 day.  Part tragedy, part triumph, 100% excellent read.  Jaycee lays open her life in the pages within.  You will smile, you will cry and you will be amazed at the unstoppable spirit of Jaycee Lee Dugard.  I cannot believe what it must have taken for this young woman to turn her tragic, heartbreaking ordeal into an triumph of the spirit and heart. Incredibly well written for someone with only a fifth grade education, Jaycee will inspire you.  What she suffered at the hands of Phillip and Nancy Garrido is revealed in graphic and straightforward detail, as well as her secrets of survival, her strength to deliver two babies in a backyard without medical care, and the hours and hours of isolation and mind control at the hands of a psychopathic madman.   I would highly recommend this book, and let it be said that this young woman wrote from her soul, this is not entertainment to sell books.  If you are looking for that, do not buy this book. If however, you want to be inspired, and can empathize with what Jaycee endured then this book is 100% for you. God Bless you Jaycee. How I admire your courage and beautiful spirit. You are an ispiration for this generation!

B0061JPYX2|1|I have been playing Back to Black in my car for weeks now and very excitedly put on Lioness: Hidden Treasures CD after taking nearly 8 weeks to arrive. I think I only got to track 5 when I ejected it, never to be played again.  The quality of Amy's singing voice just wasn't there.  Amy's backing group sing a lot more to support her, and in some tracks there is this annoying drumming that wasn't on the original track, I was beginning to think it was to divert me away from the poor quality of singing.  I don't think this CD should have been released, even though we all yearned for a third album.  Leaving us with Amy's best album Back to Black would have been kinder to her honour as Lioness: Hidden Treasure reveals cracks in her voice and the strengh and power is gone.  It was too sad for me to listen to anymore.
B00CF34B2I|5|This game made my Kindle Fire HD even better. The game runs perfectly. I love how the game controls with the drag and drop function. I'm an old Magic the Gathering player; this game feeds my need.
B008P9M614|5|My wife loved it as her Christmas present. She is viewing House every day. Received on time for Christmas so I was happy too.
B00DR0PDNE|5|Every now and again something comes along that does more than you expect.  Sending CSI episodes from the CBS site to the living room TV as well as YouTube videos is a major convenience.  Setup couldn't be easier.
B00L9B7IKE|2|It drug on and on and on!!
B0069G5Z9K|5|I love this app it is so fun. The video inspired me to get this app and it downloaded fine and fast for me I love this game so much. It is no reason you really shouldn't get it.
B009VB9VKY|2|Other than a few good Chip and Dales routines, this is pretty shallow!!
B004I744AS|5|This is a great app. I use it all the time.Dictionary is a good app to have. I gave it 5 stars.
B007ZGO7EM|5|Overall this app was a good buy and I have been using it for quite a while so I do recommend getting this app.
B00DR0PDNE|5|I am very happy with Chromecast.  It took awhile to get it and I didn't get the three free months of Netflix, but I got over that.  We're enjoying Youtube videos on our TV and casting movies from other websites.  Some people have complained that the video and audio are not synchronized, but I haven't had any problems with that.<br /><br />I'm seriously considering terminating my satellite TV subscription since between Chromecast and Roku, I have more content than I could probably watch in a lifetime and, of course, both keep getting new content.  I'm also tired of paying through the nose for over 200 channels of satellite TV when I only watch about 15 channels regularly.  I've heard that apps for Chromecast are in the pipeline and I'm really looking forward to them becoming available.  It's a great deal at just $35.  I highly recommend Chromecast.
B00CL0J99K|5|Ahemmmmmmmmmm, love the film but no pre-sale for 3-D Blu-Ray? Why did I buy my 3-D bluray and TV?? And will it happen? I thought the movie was actually the best in the three movies!
B00KA87GCW|3|Fun so far, but have only been playing for a few hours. I feel forced to leave a premature rating, as it is part of a quest in the beginning of the game.
B00EARP0HM|5|Awesome story. Looks great on digital
B008XG1X18|5|It's the best for ideas from recipes to DIY's to decorating and fun for the kids. I love it!
B00594XOZU|3|Well It WAS Good But After Awhile I Cant Seem To Open The App I Have To Keep Resetting My Kindle Fire ...
B00AREIAI8|5|It is really fun! You get addicted to it so you play it again and again! The first day I got it, I was on the app fo<br />r a whole hour! This is a must have app.And you guys have no idea what you are missing!!
B001KVZ6HK|5|Considered briefly giving this review a 1 or 2 star review so MAYBE someone would read it; but I'll just vent for the sake of venting. I have other bluray movie releases that have a sort of pop video/info setting or selection that makes for a very enjoyable movie experience, some of which you can select during and then see a behind the scenes feature. I don't understand why this Marvel Second Screen thing is not ON the bluray so it can be watched on my TV. I don't have the control of my two eyes for one to look at my laptop and the other my big screen TV. Also I seriously doubt the website will be active in 5-10 years so I can still use this feature. I usually am one of the people who likes to look at pre-concept art, drawings and story boards, yet instead of having it on the disc playing or selectable as a special feature it's a download ??? - and don't even get me started about it only being Itunes/Ipad garbage...at least it was accessible thru the website - for now<br /><br />Oh yeah, the movie was awesome.
B008Y212PI|4|fun to play. addicting. a nice part of the gabby soft game listing. please create lots more. revealing the picture as you go would be nice too.
B007SYWFRM|5|the game is fun to play quick to advance. I enjoy playing the characters are cute and fun to do quests
0316098337|3|Review posted 1/8/11 on [...]<br /><br />The first thing to applaud about this novel is the author's brave choice of narrator: 5-yr-old Jack. If you have a young child, or are around them much, you know how they talk: repetitive, aimless, droning, suddenly excited, generally happy, inquisitive. Jack is no different. You'd think having a voice like this tell a story for over 300 pages would be an impossible mission. Who can listen to that voice for so long? But as a mother of two boys that age, let me tell you two things: Jack's voice is perfect, and Jack's voice will make you fall in love with him.<br /><br />If you're familiar with the book, you know the premise of the story: Jack and his Ma live in Room, which is the windowless (except for a skylight) backyard shed of an abductor named Old Nick who got his hands on Ma when she was a college student 7 years earlier. Ma is raped several nights a week in Room, which is how Jack comes about. Ma gives birth to Jack in Room, alone, and has raised him in an 11x11 space for 5 years. But then here is the interesting part about the story: Jack doesn't know there's anything else in the world except Room. To Jack, Room is the whole world. And Ma lets him believe that, which is both gorgeous and heartbreaking.<br /><br />For Jack, things in Room have an importance like continents, oceans and countries do in our world. Donoghue capitalizes them: Wardrobe, Bed, Rug, Skylight, and Outside. But Outside is just nothing. An outer space. A void. They have a TV, and Jack believes it's all pretend, broadcast from the Cartoon Planet, the Medical Planet, and such otherworldly places. But nothing he sees in the TV is real, or Outside.<br /><br />Some reviewers have remarked about the tedious sound of Jack narrating the story, but for me, it works (in the first half of the book). Here's why: even though Jack's speech is every bit what I described above, we hang on what he says because he's telling us about a place we don't know. Room. About an existence we don't experience -- not a trapped existence (for Jack doesn't feel trapped), but a sparse existence where even broken eggshells are precious to save and use as a toy. Jack and Ma show us how to treasure things. Small things. A birthday drawing. Rain on Skylight. Sundaytreat. The balloon he's aloud to blow up and play with on the first day of every month. And he wears out every last minute of fun with it. Ma counts the cereal she puts in their bowls each morning. This is a way to see life that we've long since left and forgotten. Jack might as well be describing the surface of Neptune. We are dying to know how it is there.<br /><br />The second half of the book works less well than the first half. Things change. I won't say what, but Jack's precious observations are not so precious anymore because he's describing things I know more about. His voice started to annoy me about two-thirds through the book.<br /><br />This book is well worth reading, and perhaps you'll feel differently about the back half than I do. As another Amazon reviewer very aptly put it: half a room is better than no room at all.nce -- not a trapped existence (for Jack doesn't feel trapped), but a sparse existence where even broken eggshells are precious to save and use as a toy.

B00LU0P9L4|4|No complaints other than a couple of glitches with the tapping not working right. Hit the item numerous times and it will not accept it. Had to go back and reload game to get past it.
B000S5BSOO|4|Good
B00J6YA1V4|5|Awesome book couldn't put it down.
B00005JKCH|5|THE PREVEIWS LOOKED COOL. BUT THE MOVIE WAS COOLER. THERE WAS SO MUCH ACTION. ANYONE WHO LOVES THE COMIC SHOULD LOVE THE MOVIE.PEOPLE WHO THINK STAR WARS WAS BETTER WAS WRONG. THIS MOVIE WAS A MASTERPIECE IN EVERY ASPECT.THE STORYLINE WAS FLAWLESS. THE SPECIAL EFECTS BLUE ME AWAY. I ADVISE YOU TO SEE THIS MOVIE.
B007CW2FIE|5|terrific value; excellent performances
B00IUBM8PQ|5|Duh, its the Hunger Games.  Fire, lots of pink and blue, the arena, jerks, crazy twists, complicated love etc. etc. etc.
B00CHSPB8Y|4|pretty good. early levels are pretty fast and makes it annoying but all in all a decent game. worth the try
B0020BUWX2|5|This book had me in tears I love the tragedy that is somehow overridden by love just an awesome book 10/10
B0017SWSCW|5|I could not put this book down.  A real page turner and very intriguing.  I'm ready to buy the next one.
0307237699|4|Insightful.  Gives you a real sense of the man and his views on issues important to the middle class and Americans in general.  I would deginitely recommend it.
B00EAIMGDW|2|The screenshots made this game look more entertaining than it ended up being. I played it a few times, then I uninstalled it.
0618680004|5|No longer will I need to engage anyone on the endless topic of religion. All I need to do is recommend that they read this book. If it opens their mind, fantastic. If not, there's probably nothing more I can say that will change their mind anyway. Kudos to Dawkins for such a timely book.
B007QUUJMG|5|This book is great! I definitely recommend it! Would give it a million stars if I could! :) C: Perfect
B00FKF0F3C|3|I highly rated the first two parts of the Trilogy but was somewhat disappointed with the third. As usual with Ken Follett's historical books, I liked the &#34;history on the ground&#34; approach with a variety of characters of different nationalities encountering the effects of major events. The problems I have with the third piece are: (1) Not very well balanced--a large part was spent on the 1960's and much of the remaining century didn't have space left for proper depth. (2) Too many &#34;free love&#34; scenes played by some characters. I lived through that era and didn't notice that extent. Maybe the Hippie Generation's wild life got to Ken but I think it was mainly a waste of paper. I haven't given up on Ken Follett and expect great books in the future.
B007PVHMCG|5|Cool & real craft for Minecrafters.
B006MW3UZW|5|The character development this season is fantastic, can't wait to see what happens next! I say Bully for Downton Abbey!
B00IIOFVYA|5|It keeps you on your toes!
B004GJDQT8|5|I love amazon! great stuff, affordable prices.
B0058VW36U|4|He graphics are good but the game is very sensitive fun but not as fun as the experiments but you know still quite good.
B00SBNVLWY|5|Always love everything from Red!
B0058VW36U|5|Easy to figure out.  Addictive and fun to play for all ages. My son and I are both in love with om nom. He is such a cute character. We also like his reactions when he gets the candy or not. The music is also good.
B00B0X4PIO|4|Once again, Hosseini incorporates into his novel so many truths that should humble us, so many facts that should horrify us and so much love and courage that should make us believe in the indomitable human spirit rising above all the horrors, above physical disadvantages and situations. It gives us hope. His language is beautifully evocative, nothing is superfluous to the narrative.
B000JMLFLW|5|was buying it because of its price and its good as people said because its worth investment and time too
B000WGWQG8|5|This is a television miniseries at its best.  Paul Giamatti is a superb actor at any time, but he exceeds his best in his performance in \\"John Adams\\" playing the lead role.  This miniseries takes you from Adams introduction into the beginning of the revolutionary period of American history, his role in the Continental Congress up to his death.  Laura Linney, has the role of Abigail Adams, his wife, his best friend, and most trusted advisor.<br />Anyone with a love for American history will agree that this DVD is one that you must have in your collection.
B00632HWOG|2|because I really never use it, so I cannot really say anything about it, but will check it out again soon.
B002VPE1AW|5|This was a very good movie the special effects were to die for coloration was increadable
1878424319|5|MUST HAVE! SOMETHING YOU NEED FOR DAILY PRACTICE! GREAT BOOK
0307740919|4|A good read.
0316743003|5|This is simply the best and most informative book on the development and manufacture and testing of these amazing aircraft from the U2 and Blackbird to the Stealth Fighter F117. It pays homage to the fortitude and determination of a breed of men who would follow their vision through despite official ineptitude and conservatism. Many leading political figures do not come out well. The late Ben Rich and his team are a lost breed now but we owe them a great debt of gratitude. I will keep going back to this book for years to come.
B00P77ZAN8|1|Couldn't get it to work on my fire HD.
B00AIUUXHC|5|downloaded for my 6 yo. . . hes lucky if I give it up..lol. gotta download this game. no disappointments here. and doubt many from you either.
0385535147|5|Another excellent read by John Grisham! One of my favorite authors and was not dissappointed by his latest novel. I would recommend this book to others!
B006Z1GLHO|5|A wonderfl0ully written and acted show.
B00P77ZAN8|5|Love it! Though it was hard to figure out how to play friends. We got it though! Could use better Kindle support:) maybe a way to turn off graphics if you have slow processor?  runs great on iPhone! Super fun and addictive!
B00H71PHS0|5|I just started watching this great series last winter...so had much catching up to do.  Thanks to my Amazon Prime, it was so easy....<br />AND so enjoyable.
B001S2PT3M|5|This is a great series to begin with but watching it on Blu Ray is WAY BETTER than watching it on HD with Digital audio on Showtime.  The audio in particular jumps out at you!  Highly recommend.
B00P7PJ9P0|5|Awesome
B00BAXFECK|5|The writing is clear and the descriptions superb.  Ms Tartt draws believable, fascinating characters and a story line that is engaging.  I found myself wanting the painting!
0553381407|3|Reading this book will confirm what you already suspect about your parent's behavior if you have toxic parents. It will also confirm that many of your emotional habits, such as letting people walk all over you, or not standing up to others because you don't want to make them angry, are because of the way you grew up. This book may help you to redefine your relationship with your toxic parent if you are in a position of still desiring a relationship with that parent. The short coming of this book is that it lumps so many kinds of abuse into one book that you don't get a good feel for how to deal with the specific type(s) of abuse that you experienced. It also doesn't really give the reader any tools to move forward in their own life. Yes, it validates that you were abused, but it doesn't talk about how to move yourself forward in any aspect other than your relationship with your toxic parent. The one thing that I took from this book, and am very greatful for, is the realization that my aging and in poor health, but still miserable, angry, mean, and toxic parent  lived her life and made choices to get to where she is today, it isn't my fault she is miserable and mean (even though she would tell me otherwise). I am entitled to live my life, I don't have to feel sorry for her and try to make her feel better at my family's expense anymore. Basically, after reading this book and dealing with a nasty precipitating event, I have realized that I am not responsible for her problems, she is. So if you are in need of validation that your parent is toxic, read this book. However, if you are looking for a way to pull your life together because of childhood abuse, this isn't the book you are looking for.
0399160477|5|This was a gift from me to my brother in law for Christmas.  He absolutely loved it and was thrilled to receive it as he is a big fan of Tom Clancy and this was the last book he wrote as he died right before it came out for sale.
B00V4JJFN4|3|Let's be honest, Peter Jackson et al stretched this thing too far. Two movies would have sufficed to tell the story well.
B001EBV0OY|5|Absolutely phenomenal! The acting was superb and the story is so beautiful. I want to watch this over and over again.
0060776579|5|This is an awesome read for anyone. It is especially poignant for those who know they have what it takes to make it big; but continue to not master whatever it is that they need to get there.  These ideas and concepts can be applied to life; not just creating wealth.  T. Harve Eker does a great job of relating to his audience in easy going everyday terminology.   I have been quoting this book since the very first day I listen to the CD. This is a well done first rate book; buy it for your Dad, your Mom, your Brother, Sister; anyone that you care about.
B00JOT3HQ2|5|Geometry Dash is a really fun game. It is very addictive and I love it!!!!! :)
B00VFTCGES|4|Good movie
B005LAIISA|5|love it
B00BAXFECK|3|The story line was very good in this book. There was WAY too much emphasis on drugs. This took away from the story immensely. Get rid of the kids on dope and the story would have been a classic.
B000MNP2K8|5|Video arrival was expedient and was in excellent condition.  Thank you very much.  Your service was excellent.
B00ET7EON4|3|Meh.
B009HQ9UHC|5|This game is so hilarious and fun to build so many different vehicles! SO FUN! I love this game so much!
B009VB7P6G|5|In Short: Coming wearily close to the winter boundary Tink's wings begin to glitter. She is rounded up and evaluated by the doc as good to go. After some more exploration she finds a way into the forbidden side and finds she has a sister. Perwinkle is a winter fairy. Together, and with all of their friends, the fairies look for a way to safely keep each other company.<br /><br />I laughed all the way through. It is light, delightful and very entertaining. The imagery is gorgeous.  I watch all of the fairy movies with my daughter, though, I think I may enjoy them more than she does! Perfect for family fun.
B0027MJU00|5|Reading about a family being killed was traumatic at the beginning but developed into more of tolerable mystery. The mystery portion of the book was a real page turner!
B003NS2T9G|5|I like that each episode is just enough to watch at bedtime.  Not too long, but not too short.  Bang.
B001992NUQ|5|I just watched this for the first time and it is already in my top movies of all time list.  It will blow your mind with amazing directing from David Fincher and excellent performances from Brad Pitt & Edward Norton.  This movie deserves to be in everyone's collection, and looks fantastic on blu-ray.  That's all because I am not supposed to be talking about it...
B00005JMGC|5|MONA LISA SMILE may seem from the trailer like a piece of light (and silly) fluff, another chance for the indomitable Julia Roberts to perform in a splendid setting. Well, the last phrase is true: Roberts does have a magnificently beautiful setting (Wellesley College and its environs) but she does more than 'perform'. This is one of her more understated, underplayed, and sensitive pieces of work to date. Playing a wide-eyed California feminist teacher of Art History, she moves into the Wellesley faculty and 'Stepford Wives Preps' student body where marriage and service to the Ultimate Goal Husband overrides all other aspects of 'higher education', and slowly and painfully makes her vision seep into the minds of these very non-liberated women of tomorrow. Her pupils are well acted by Maggie Gyllenhaal, Kirsten Dunst, Gennifer Goodwin (a stunning newcomer to this reviewer), and Julia Stiles. She observes the effects of the old Wellesley attitude in the various reactions by Marcia Gay Harden (in another jewel of a portrayal), Juliet Stevenson, Marian Seldis and Donna Mitchell. The only prominent male in this cast is Dominic West who holds his own and creates a powerful chemistry with Roberts (et al...). Mike Newell knows this 1950s state of brainwashed girls who buy into the formidable philosophy that a woman's place is in the home by the iron, dishes, stove, ad infinitum. This is a terrifying reminder of how many women fostered their own degradation in the march toward future Women's Rights. To Newell's credit he does not opt for a Hollywood happy-wappy ending, but instead elects to just allow the influence of Roberts' character be felt in the fadeout. For once a magnificent set of credits visuals (with Barbra Streisand's inimitable rendering of \\"Smile\\" as the music) documents the history that lies behind this delicate story. Bravo to the people who elected to do this service. This film is a warm, sensitive, serious movie that deals with many issues we need desperately to heed less they affect other 'minority' groups. Excellent!y to heed less they affect other 'minority' groups. Excellent!
B005ZOBNOI|5|Loved it
B004DK5CW4|5|Secretariat is a great movie for all ages. It is very inspirational and beautiful story about the fastest racing horse in history.  The story was well played by actors Diane Lane and John Malkovich. Horses were beautiful.
B00E8AVNBI|5|Have become a Danny Trejo fan since his past 10 or more appearance's in movies as of late.  Good actor and plays a good character in this movie.  Great action movie great effects and no sleeper!  They did a super job on good props and scenery for the time period and this one makes a great western with a ghost characters added in.
B00005221M|5|After two enthusiastic campaigns, and a very long wait, the much sought after, eagerly anticipated Director's Cut of LOTM has finally been released. Presented this time around via the high end of the technology spectrum, DVD, the Director's Cut promised, at least, to be a superior edition visually and audibly to the original. The story content itself, having undergone another round of editing, remained questionable in regard to its improvement or lack thereof. There was to be additional footage, widely welcomed, though no one knew what exactly these additions would be. The director, Michael Mann, had edited the release which offered reasonable confidence that the re-editing would be an enhancement ... would it? Here, we offer one, actually two, opinions on this ...<br /><br />What's NOT Here: Largely because of discussion & speculation here on this Web Site, expectations were huge for this release. Dances With Wolves, when released in Director's Cut form, had nearly one hour of additional footage ... While no one thought there'd be THAT much new material, it was generally assumed there would be 15 or so minutes, including a \\"love\\" scene between Alice & Uncas, added to the film. All based on pre-theatrical release reviews, plus comments made by many of the principals in various interviews, most Mohicans fans eagerly awaited more, More, MORE! Forget it! It's not here. That's not, it is obvious, what Mr. Michael Mann had in mind for this gem of a release. More on that later. There is NO Alice/Uncas love scene. In fact, this release does absolutely nothing in the way of furthering that relationship. It stays as it lays. Uncas has not one additional line, Alice one or two. Nearly all hypothesized new scenes are nowhere to be found on this DVD. In no one's wildest imagination, did anybody think that some material would actually be CUT from the original. That matter was never addressed. So, though, it is. GONE ... Not ever to be heard again in the DVD-age are SEVERAL of Hawkeye's most quoted lines ... things like \\"Clear it up any?\\" \\"Just dropped in to see how you boys is doing!\\" \\"Someday you & I are going to have a serious disagreement!\\" \\"Nothing better to do on the lake today, Major?\\" All have seen the axe. Part of the exchange between Hawkeye & Cora at The Burial Ground has been lopped off. That one hurts. No longer do you hear, \\"That is because they are a breed apart and make no sense!\\" What??!! Can it be? Want to hear more? Clannad's I Will Find You no longer lilts through the misty riverside air as Hawkeye, Chingachgook & Uncas begin their journey to rescue the Munro sisters. It just isn't there. No matter how many times you play it over, it's still gone! Disappointed? Go on, admit it! You feel terribly disappointed! Sulk awhile. Go on! Feel morbid depression, consider a leap off the ledge at Nature's Shower Bath. Get it all out of your system! Allow yourself to feel the pain! Then, FORGET IT! In any case, you still have your wide screen THX video version to savor, so get a grip! Now, place your hopes & expectations aside. Forget that you've ever seen The Last of the Mohicans. Go out and buy the new Director's Expanded Edition of this classic film and bravely pop it into your DVD player. Go on. It really won't hurt. Get ready to watch 1992's The Last of the Mohicans again ... for the first time!<br /><br />The DVD Experience: Perhaps, you are like us, you've never before owned a DVD disk. Get ready for a real treat. You will never, when given a choice, want to watch a VHS tape again. You have immediate scene access, you can zoom in intimately on any shot. Sure, you can also pause, run in slow motion, rewind and fast forward. This time, though, with a difference. What you see is crystal clear! No more blurred images or lines running across your screen ... just pure IMAGE ... and you can run it at various speeds. The normal picture quality is near-perfect. You get vivid, rich colors. Details long lost in the murky gloom of the VHSnight scenes will POP out at you while watching the DVD version. You'll see things you never saw before, much like watching the 35mm film on the big screen. For that quality alone, this is the definitive version to view. Like sound? Distinct stereo separation, even on just your TV's speakers, can be heard ... Every little sound becomes a part of the viewing experience. You will miss nothing. Clear, precise sounds ... no distortion ... the sights & sounds will cause you to fully be engulfed by the film. If it was the identical release to the original, you'd still feel like you were watching a Director's Cut, so much more will become apparent to you. Such is the quality of a DVD. You will be amazed. Oh, and did we mention the optional sub-titles? Never again will you have to guess what it is characters are saying. It can all be there for you, on screen, if you so choose. If you're at all like us, all these little perks will provide you with long moments of exploration & amusement, causing The Last of the Mohicans to run for well over 3 hours, instead of its listed 117 minutes.<br /><br />So, What IS Here: Only 117 minutes, you say? Yes, and that's only 3 minutes over the original! Figure that maybe up to a minute of time was sliced out, that leaves about 4 minutes, total, of new footage. [Well, so our math is a little off! See MM's mathematics below!] That can be a lot of film, and so it is ...<br /><br />The first thing that you'll see is the dazzling The Last of the Mohicans title bouncing seductively on your screen. Then you'll be greeted with Hickory Nut Gorge, thunderous waterfalls, scenes from the movie, and you will have an opportunity to explore the DVD ... choose Language Selection, to set your sound & caption preferences, view The Cast, select various scenes, or play the movie. Go ahead. Play around a bit. Then, click on Play Movie, sit back, relax, and enjoy the awesome splendor, the beauty of the cinematography, the spellbinding soundtrack, the powerful images, the adventure, the action, the romance ... watch as Michael Mann transforms his 1992 masterpiece, real \\"subtle\\"-like, into a MASTERPIECE ...<br /><br />It is obvious that Mann intended to reconstruct a portion of Hawkeye's character. No longer the pop-action hero, he has become serious, intent ... at the end, almost boyish, as he questions his adopted father, Chingachgook, high above Linville Gorge. The Hawkeye we see here is a stronger Hawkeye. No more flippant remarks in this life or death struggle. Hawkeye's main aim here is survival! Possibly for the same reasons, Clannad's haunting melody was removed. Out of place in this primeval wilderness, the tune is replaced by the Trevor Jones/Randy Edelman score. During the battle sequences, The Siege and Massacre Valley, the music is mixed down considerably allowing the sounds of war - the stark realities - to permeate the film. During the former, the score is allowed to fully explode upon the scene only as the fort is reached by the main characters. During the massacre, the theme rises in intensity, but again, is only allowed to bear its full force on the proceedings as Hawkeye and Cora embrace ... great stuff!<br /><br />As you watch, after being floored by the clarity of the image, you'll be delighted by the deeply rich colors of The Elk Hunt. Then, nighttime at Cameron's Cabin brings you into a whole new world. Just TRY to absorb all those details in just one sitting. Here, too, you see the first addition to the film, a new take of John Cameron grabbing his rifle, a cautious approach to the door, and then, after realizing who is drawing near, uttering the first new line, \\"Alexandria ... Set 3 more places.\\" So very quietly, Mann sets out to actually strengthen the story by skillfully placed morsels that help to further relationships, spotlight motivations, and establish political climates. Re-introduced is Le [Renard] Subtil, Cooper's Magua; as known to the French ... The Sly Fox. We see, even more, Duncan asa warrior, courtesy of the new Courier Diversion scene. We realize he is very much the same as these warriors of the forest. We hear, and see, a very effective new piece at Webb's HQ's, providing amplification of the British/Colonial dispute early on. Cora & Alice have brief new things to say at the patroon's house connecting their past a bit more to 1757 colonial America. We see the column of escorting soldiers symbolically enter into the wilderness. The Abenaki Chief, Magua, Jack, and especially Montcalm & Colonel Munro are given new life through an added line or use of a different take. It's all very small tinkering on Mann's part. Nothing monumental, but its cumulative effect certainly ties the underlying stories that are the foundation of this film together in a much more palatable fashion, especially benefiting the uninitiated. For your information (DVD scene name in parenthesis), the main expanded scenes would be: The diversionary efforts of Heyward to enable the courier to flee to safety under the cover of Uncas and Hawkeye (A Run To Fort Edward), The Parlay scene (Terms For Surrender) which is radically expanded to our benefit, providing more interplay between the two antagonists, the former Clannad scene (Stay Alive) which intersperses, beautifully, scenes of the captives being hauled away, at one point set against a radiant sunset, with shots of their Mohican rescuers in pursuit ... you can hear the pants of exhaustion, sense the desperation ... and the final scene (Last of the Mohicans), where Chingachgook rightfully takes over the title role and artfully allows him to become the wise elder, poignantly foreseeing the future of the frontier. It is a grand moment that makes a strong ending even more puissant. All we could say was, \\"Wow!\\" Fifteen scenes, in all, are listed as containing footage not seen in the original theatrical release, though we were hard pressed to spot them in one (Lovers), and found little added things in two scenes not listed (A Stirring in the Blood and Trophies of Honor). Bits & pieces skillfully interwoven into the substance already there to create the definitive version ... Or, as the liner notes say, \\"[Michael Mann's] definitive vision of the film.\\" We couldn't agree more!<br /><br />A Word On The Blemishes: Several reviews mention uneven editing of this new cut. In fact, included with the DVD is this little note: \\"In order to create it [this DVD version], certain shots had to be lengthened, resulting in a momentary jump in the image.\\" We noticed but two or three. These minor flaws are easily negated by the overall outstanding image clarity, deep colors, and improved sound.e powerful images, the adventure, the action, the romance ... watch as Michael Mann transforms his 1992 masterpiece, real \\"subtle\\"-like, into a MASTERPIECE ...  <br /> <br />It is obvious that Mann intended to reconstruct a portion of Hawkeye's character. No longer the pop-action hero, he has become serious, intent ... at the end, almost boyish, as he questions his adopted father, Chingachgook, high above Linville Gorge. The Hawkeye we see here is a stronger Hawkeye. No more flippant remarks in this life or death struggle. Hawkeye's main aim here is survival! Possibly for the same reasons, Clannad's haunting melody was removed. Out of place in this primeval wilderness, the tune is replaced by the Trevor Jones/Randy Edelman score. During the battle sequences, The Siege and Massacre Valley, the music is mixed down considerably allowing the sounds of war - the stark realities - to permeate the film. During the former, the score is allowed to fully explode upon the scene only as the fort is reached by the main characters. During the massacre, the theme rises in intensity, but again, is only allowed to bear its full force on the proceedings as Hawkeye and Cora embrace ... great stuff!  <br /> <br />As you watch, after being floored by the clarity of the image, you'll be delighted by the deeply rich colors of The Elk Hunt. Then, nighttime at Cameron's Cabin brings you into a whole new world. Just TRY to absorb all those details in just one sitting. Here, too, you see the first addition to the film, a new take of John Cameron grabbing his rifle, a cautious approach to the door, and then, after realizing who is drawing near, uttering the first new line, \\"Alexandria ... Set 3 more places.\\" So very quietly, Mann sets out to actually strengthen the story by skillfully placed morsels that help to further relationships, spotlight motivations, and establish political climates. Re-introduced is Le [Renard] Subtil, Cooper's Magua; as known to the French ... The Sly Fox. We see, even more, Duncan as a warrior, courtesy of the new Courier Diversion scene. We realize he is very much the same as these warriors of the forest. We hear, and see, a very effective new piece at Webb's HQ's, providing amplification of the British/Colonial dispute early on. Cora & Alice have brief new things to say at the patroon's house connecting their past a bit more to 1757 colonial America. We see the column of escorting soldiers symbolically enter into the wilderness.

B00GSJ9X4Q|5|Just recently installed this in a Alienware M11x R3 Laptop with only one space for an SSD or HDD.  Used the CLoning software which came with the WD Black2. This was a totally smooth operation.  Then inserted the USB Key in and downloaded the Driver for the 1TB HDD, installed it and presto . . . 1TB HDD ready for use . . . already formatted at the factory.

B007FG9LIE|4|Well written. It isn't overly scary, doesn't drag out. It is a great mystery book. I couldn't put it down once I started reading it.
B000EULJLU|5|Seeing as this is my first Tool CD and really my first true encounter with the band, I was unsure of what I was going to be getting into, basing the purchase off of Vicarious and Forty Six & 2, the only songs of theirs I had heard. Wow, I was really blown away. The only song I skip over is Lipan Conjuring as it is just tribal drums an chanting for about a minute. Besides that I feel the album flows great and really feels like one large song rather than 11 completely unrelated songs that really have no real connection. Some of my favorite songs that, if you don't buy the album, you should definitely download are Vicarious, 10,000 Days, and Right In Two. For a brand new Tool fan, this is an excellent listen and excellent buy.
B002QBS9KE|5|The fit was perfect. Loved the light packaging.
B002RBZ13Q|5|I think this blu ray needs to be reviewed in two different capacities; quality of the disc, and quality of the concert.  Both are exceptional.  The picture and sound of the blu ray are outstanding. Vivid colors and boisterous music. You can almost feel the sweat flying at you (and these guys get sweaty).  This is really the next best thing to actually being at the concert (and maybe even better!). The other part is how good the show itself is.  I'm a huge Killers fan, and they played everything I really wanted to hear.  Even though it's a concert for the Day & Age album, they still played the best songs from all 3 other albums.  And played them they did.  It was an amazing show and they really put their hearts into. 5 stars!!
B0039208JE|5|It's been years since I saw this film so watching it on Blu-ray was a treat. Originally I thought Jack Nicholson's performance wasn't as over the top needed for his character as it should be. Seeing it now changed my opinion as he has the right amount of ham needed without chewing up the scenery. Too much of Jack being Jack would have made him unintentionally funny as he was in 'The Shining' where you knew he was already nutso the first time he cocked an eyebrow. Comparing his performance to Heath Ledger's Joker is unfair because the second version is a darker one for another time and their characters have different back stories. Actually this 1989 film is pretty dark too. Michael Keaton seems better than before as he deals with his dual nature. His sly humour is a welcome relief from Christian Bale's glumness. Villains usually have the showier parts but I now feel both characters carry equal weight and blend nicely into Tim Burton's grand vision which is the real star of this film ably supported by Anton Furst's gothic production design and Roger Pratt's sharp cinematography for the evening scenes. The rest of the cast fill out their roles nicely but Jack Palance is still wayyy over the top with exaggerated line readings that make me cringe again so maybe that's why Nicholson reined in his own performance. (Imagine a MadTV skit where these two actors try to out-ham each other....) And let's not forget the contribution of Danny Elfman's sweeping Wagner-like score that adds so much to the mood of this film which has aged well and should not be neglected for the newer version.<br /><br />Video quality is very good with clear details and color reproduction. One reviewer here has also praised it but complained about the poor surround mix. Actually the surround mix is good but there's a possible reason for his complaint. There are three English soundtracks on this disc; the third one is the Director's Commentary. The first one is Dolby Digital 5.1 where I too noticed the inferior surround sound. The second one is Dolby TrueHD and is a better distributed surround mix with more activity in the rear channels. I didn't realize this second program was available until I scrolled through the onscreen Audio menu to find the commentary. Our players default to the first audio setting on the menu (Dolby Digital 5.1) so you have to manually change to the second setting (Dolby TrueHD). Play it with this one and you'll hear the difference as it's also louder and brighter. I'm assuming the other reviewer like me wasn't aware of the TrueHD mix. It does state it on the cover but the print is tiny. I don't know why the manufacturers didn't place the better audio mix first or eliminate the inferior one. I recall my VHS tape with Dolby Surround had plenty of separation but I'm now unable to play it for comparison with the Blu-ray.<br /><br />The 'making of' extras are worth watching as well as the documentaries about the Batman legend. Prince's three music videos are over the top but that's just Prince being Prince during those years. Burton's commentary is informative but his nonstop enthusiastic chattiness became tiring and put me to sleep. Maybe that's an unfair comment so I'll have to listen to it again when I'm wide awake instead of late at night.<br /><br />5 stars for the film and video & audio quality. And for under $10 so how can you go wrong?inferior surround sound. The second one is Dolby TrueHD and is a better distributed surround mix with more activity in the rear channels.

0375704027|4|It is always a hard task for me to review a novel by Murakami because of the sheer complexity of his work. This particular novel christened 'Norwegian Wood' after the famous Beatles' song has been looked at as one of Murakami's simplest novels where he was accused of succumbing to the story lines that he has prided himself on avoiding. After reading 'Norwegian Wood' I must say with absolute conviction that these accusations are indeed invalid and have been based on the apparent plot of the novel that at first might seem simple, it is true that there were no signs of any sheep or disappearing elephants in this novel, but it is far from being simple.<br />I think Murakami has taken a great risk with this novel in the sense that he had the courage to step out of what is natural to him and attempt to write a story in a different style yet he succeeded in making it his own. 'Norwegian Wood' is simply a love story but by saying that we have not even scratched the surface on the intensity of this novel. By the time Murakami was finished with it, this love story has sucked you in its nostalgic era of the 60's and enveloped you in the smells and sounds of every season from January through to December. This isn't just a love story, it is a coming-of-age story, and it is a story within a story. The characters have the definite Murakami style, selfless, sweet some even lovable yet all are intriguingly twisted such is the real world we live in.
B00IK1J9QM|5|Brilliantly written and structured. Lee Child has written a superb plot which prevents the reader from putting it down. Jack Reacher becomes more and more real with every new story. His character is so well constructed it leaves little to criticise. I will look forward to the next Jack Reacher adventure with enthusiasm and anticipation.

B00HERGM86|1|The story itself, we have seen it all before. Save the galaxy, and make some witty jokes, but never get seriously hurt because, hey, it's a superhero. Also, the villain isn't really too dangerous. It takes 15 minutes to 'supercharges' and when he does he just throws slaps at Thor. That's a guy who supposedly has the power to destroy the, er, Universe.<br /><br />The movie is feminist too, have you noticed how men are portrayed as either wimps (the  guy who Portman dates in the movie, whom she literally use. Or when she slaps Thor twice for some stupid reasons like where did he go, etc. A tiny woman who slaps a demi god? That's a new one. Or when Odin's wife tells Odin 'You are alive because I worry about you' with that sarcastic look on her -ugly- face).<br /><br />Mundane movie for the average audience with short attention span who's on Facebook too much
B00F91G5BS|4|Generally underrated by critics.  Imagine a virus that spreads like lightening through an infected human population. Imagine the virus is able to overwhelm its hosts, ramp up the adrenal response and get the hosts up and moving with one goal in mind - propagating itself as fast as possible by taking bites out of other people. The idea that zombies can run and hurl themselves at their victims is a frightening one, demonstrated large scale with great CGI and small scale in the narrow alleys of a Jerusalem whose last defenses fail.  Brad Pitt who is generally always very good is quite credible as a W.H.O. operative who is drafted to drop into the middle of this to find anything that will help a rapidly shrinking uninfected populace find a way to survive. The helplessness and hopelessness of the situation is matched by the sheer terror of roilng masses of infected humans coming at you non-stop. A really good sci-fi B movie for the 21st century. Looks like it was made for a sequel which could have been quite interesting as the ending defies the usual conventions.

B00005JKYS|5|I live with a Vietnam Vet who served in the late 1960s with 1st Cav. Medivac. During service he earned two Purple Hearts, the Distinguished Flying Cross, and the Air Medal.  Since WE WERE SOLDIERS concerns the 1st Cav., Randy wanted to see it.  I reluctantly agreed; I am not partial to war films and I dislike Mel Gibson, and Randy is very hard on Vietnam War films.  He dismisses PLATOON as a Hollywood 8x10 glossy; says APOCALYPSE NOW is an interesting movie that captures the paranoia, but all the technical details are wrong; and describes DEER HUNTER as excellent in its depiction of the strangeness of coming home but so full of plot holes that he can hardly endure it.  And about one and all he says: \\"It wasn't like that.\\"<br />He was silent through the film, and when we left the theatre I asked what he thought.  He said, \\"They finally got it.  That's what it was like.  All the details are right.  The actors were just like the men I knew.  They looked like that and they talked like that.  And the army wives too, they really were like that, at least every one I ever knew.\\"  The he was silent for a long time.  At last he said, \\"You remember the scene where the guy tries to pick up a burn victim by the legs and all the skin slides off?  Something like that happened to me once.  It was at a helicopter crash.  I went to pick him up and all the skin just slid right off.  It looked just like that, too.  I've never told any one about it.\\"<br />In most respects WE WERE SOLDIERS is a war movie plain and simple. There are several moments when the film relates the war to the politics and social movements that swirled about it, and the near destruction of the 1st. Cav.'s 7th Battalion at Ia Drang clearly arises from the top brass' foolish decision to send the 7th into an obvious ambush--but the film is not so much interested in what was going on at home or at the army's top as it is in what was actually occurring on the ground.  And in this it is extremely meticulous, detailed, and often horrifically successful.  Neither Randy nor I--nor any one in the theatre I could see--was bored by or dismissive of the film.  It grabs you and it grabs you hard, and I can easily say that it is one of the finest war movies I have ever seen, far superior to the likes of SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, which seems quite tame in comparison.<br />Perhaps the single most impressive thing about the film is that it never casts its characters in a heroic light; they are simply soldiers who have been sent to do a job, and they do it knowing the risks, and they do it well in spite of the odds.  Mel Gibson, although I generally despise him as both an actor and a human being, is very, very good as commanding officer Hal Moore, and he is equaled by Sam Elliot, Greg Kinnear, Chris Klein, and every other actor on the battlefield.  The supporting female cast, seen early in the film and in shorter scenes showing the home front as the battle rages, is also particularly fine, with Julie Moore able to convey in glance what most actresses could not communicate in five pages of dialogue.  The script, direction, cinematography, and special effects are sharp, fast, and possess a \\"you are there\\" quality that is very powerful.<br />Randy did have a criticism.  \\"I don't think there would be time for casualty telegrams to actually get home while the battle was going on,\\" he said.  \\"After all, it only lasted three days.\\"  I myself had a criticism; there were points in the film when I found the use of a very modernistic, new-agey piece of music to be intrusive and out of place.  And we both felt that a scene near the end of the movie, when a Vietnamese commander comments on the battle, to be improbable and faintly absurd.  But these are nit-picky quibbles.  WE WERE SOLDIERS is a damn fine movie.  I'll give Randy, who served two tours of duty in Vietnam, the last word: \\"It may not be 'the' Vietnam movie.  I don't think there could ever be 'the' Vietnam movie.  But they get everything right.  That's how it looked and sounded, and that's what I saw, and this is the best movie about Vietnam I've ever seen.\\"'s how it looked and sounded, and that's what I saw, and this is the best movie about Vietnam I've ever seen.\\"

B00IIU9U00|2|All the characters in this movie are waaay overdone.  Jonah Hill's character is particularly annoying.  I'm not offended by cursing, nudity, drug use or anything, but it was basically three hours of over-the-top nonsense.  They go into things just for the sake of being &#34;shocking&#34; and it never adds up to any substance.  The movie is also about an hour too long as a result of this.<br /><br />Save yourself and go watch something else.  :-)

I'm giving it a 4 star rating because I don't like the way the author changed the point of view of the story from person to person. I like a consistent story with a consistent person being the point of view. The story was overall good but It wasn't so enthralling that I couldn't put it down.

B00N6PEOT4|3|While I love this author's other series and cannot wait for a new one to come out, this was slow at beginning, and then it seemed like the ending was not well developed - just skipped ahead to future summary just when it was getting interesting.
B007HC3LHS|5|All throughout this book I could truly feel the characters.  I could feel the emotions so strongly that it honestly gave me a dark, almost hopeless feeling inside.  There are people in your life that will come to mind as you delve into this story...people who you will see in a different light, wondering what and who they really are.  There are people exactly like what is described in these pages.  The chapters give a new view on what a seemingly flattering love interest can hide - maniacal obsession that can be all but inescapable.
B000002H97|2|Called &quot;The Black Album,&quot; and of course we all know the obvious reason why, this 1991 release by Metallica was incredibly popular in a time when grunge was just gaining a foothold in popular music and &quot;Smells  Like Teen Spirit&quot; was a smash hit and a deliberately executed anthem  for teens everywhere.  What most people have not figured out yet is this  album can be called its nickname for another reason--the songs are empty  and utterly devoid of imagination or life.<br />This album is heralded as  &quot;saving metal,&quot; but I know that it killed it instead.  Even in  the laughable hair-metal era, all types of metal still had a sort of  integrity and brotherhood, an elite society that could not be attained by  on-the-beaten-path, mainstream rockers and fans.  However, Metallica  somehow managed to force their way into the popular music genre, and of  course people jumped all over it.  Both the album and the band became  sellouts overnight, gaining a huge legion of fans and losing their first  and most loyal at the same time.  You can liken it to a treehouse club in  which the president or whomever is in charge invites fifty or so other kids  to join, and the original member's protests are howled down by the new  members.  Therefore, the original members leave, and their is no integrity  or honor left.<br />For the songs, only &quot;Enter Sandman&quot; and  &quot;Unforgiven&quot; can be considered good music.  &quot;Sad But  True,&quot; &quot;Wherever I May Roam,&quot; and &quot;The God that  Failed&quot; are mediocre at best, and the rest of the songs are not even  mere shadows of Metallica's former glory, but entirely new spectres that  haunt the first and best fans for the rest of their days.

So I moved on to Royal Assassin and could not put it down.  This book and the third one cost me some serious school credit, but being a burned out high school senior I did not really care. <br /> <br />Never have I read a fantasy so emotionally racking.  I traditionally don't like first person perspectives, but in the instance of this book, it fully illuminates intense emotions in a way that a third person would have tremendous difficuly achieving.  Yes, this book is extremly depressing, perhaps overly so for many readers, but immensely intriguing becasue of its dark depressing quailities.  I admit that it is one of the very few books I have read that made me almost cry.  Its ability to rip your guts out is its beauty, and I say this with me being the most unemotional person I know. <br /> <br />The main character, FitzChivalry Farseer, through whose perspective we see the story, is my favorite literary character to date.  What makes him so good is that he is his own character, not some plot device that we see far too often in fantasy. <br /> <br />This book and the rest of the trilogy stand head and shoulders above the rest of the genre.  If you want phenominally good fantasy, by all means read Farseer.  If you are tired of reading the average trash by the likes of Robert Jordan, then treat yourself to something that is more than deserving of your time.
B005EGXTL2|5|Gripping and super interesting story - loved it!! Great characters and plot is original and fascinating. A new favourite of mine!
B009ZFPQOQ|5|Love this app! The only one we us when traveling.
B00984668E|5|First and foremost, I must say that this album is worth it just because of the amzing ZZ Top cover, \\"Cheap Sunglasses\\".  It's f'n GREAT!!!<br /><br />Typical Sword, but with some great synthesizers and more of a Black Sabbath feel than the previous three Sword albums.  Nothing slow or depressing here, just straight up ROCK.<br /><br />All I really have to say is if you liked the last three Sword albums, you'd definately want this one.  BUY IT!
B002E0JL86|5|Amazing movie, especially if you are in the medical profession.
B005ZOBNOI|5|This was tragically beautiful in both the story and the way it was written. To feel love no matter the length of time is a gift in and of itself
B000OQF6N6|1|I loved the Smashing Pumpkins, and basically anything Billy Corgan touched up to even Machina.  I can honestly say, they (he) changed my life with Siamese Dream, Mellon Collie, and all the b-sides and side projects in between.  I remember him saying in a interview when the band finally broke up for good, \\"I just want to stop before people stop caring.\\"  After this album, I no longer care.  Zwan, the solo album were forgivable, but this is disgraceful and a shameful to a new level.  I tried to listen to this album over and over, thinking it will click or I'll get it, but no, there's very little magic left at all in Billy's creativity tank. For example:<br />\\"I'm gonna make it I'll take it<br />Like everybody else<br />Belle of the fawning<br />I'm yawning...\\"<br />It isn't just the lame lyrics, it's the way he sings it, the effects they use, the everything. This reminds me of when I found out Santa Clause wasn't real, or when Jordan came out of retirement.  Nothing is so good or bad that it can last forever; he should have left it be (Lucas should have left Star Wars be), he's going to discredit all previous work if he doesn't stop after this album. The magic is gone, his true fans who were truly changed by him are looking (listening) for something that isn't there.  I'M YAWNING
B0006L16N8|4|X&Y is very good, yet a disappointment compared to Coldplays earlier music.  Speed of Sound is really the only decent track.  If you like Coldplay (good Coldplay) you are sure to enjoy the new album from Oasis, Don't Believe the Truth.  I can't get Keep the Dream Alive out of my head.  Hope some of you enjoy this new Colplay cd.  Otherwise, pick up the new Oasis cd.  It's the number one cd worldwide right now.  Cheers.
B0034DGPEU|5|I myself really loved reading it... things were not always the way I would want them to turn out.. But real life is not a bowl of cherry's either.. And way back then ..women did not have the say so we do now.  I liked some of the characters and loathed some of the characters, just what the author intended.  Every ones taste is different, all I know is that I looked forward to reading it each night when I got into bed, and am so grateful that I have the life I do have. So if nothing else, it made me aware of others suffering way back then. Not a very helpful review I fear.
B003O86FMW|5|Better than the first!  What can I say about the fact that it became a movie?  Obviously a great series.
B00GDT4M1A|5|Classic. Highly recommend. My 7 & 9 year old boys have loved The Jungle Book movie for years. Had to buy this replacement as our old disc vanished.
B009ZQC7MY|5|Fantastic series... I watched from beginning to the current episode in only a few days and cannot believe I have to wait until January for the new season!! Something to look forward to after the long Holiday Season is over...
B0002IVN9W|5|This album is every bit as good as other reviewers have asserted. I know from reading other reviews on Amazon.com that certain people can't stand the thought of five stars being given out, because nothing is five-stars perfect, etc. Boring! This album is amazing and deserves its rating. The songwriting is raw; the delivery is honest; and the recording, in all its reverbed/room-ambience glory, is sublime. This album is full of dynamic musicianship and feels honest-to-God like something was experienced in the studio. It does sound like the Pixies; it also sounds like the Black Heart Procession, Roxy Music, etc. It sounds like those bands and many others because they've all made great music. But reference points are not necessary; this record's appeal goes much further than splendor by association. There's a strong chance you'll love this regardless of what other albums will keep it company on your music shelves.
B003VANOFY|4|Light weight and comfortable to wear for longterm games.  The boom goes up and down a little too freely - makes me think it will give out early?  With so many buttons, it's easy to mute yourself while playing.  They should design it so you can't push buttons if you have to take them off for a BRB or something and put them back on.  Other than that, game on!
B00FB13Y74|2|I can't get it past a certain point without buying the premium version so it doesn't work. What is wrong?
B0083TXXZ4|4|make sure you plan to buy additional so kids is happy. looks incomplete w o it and too light but ok all inall
B00E8KLWB4|5|Great value for money, easy enough to play but very addictive and I would recommend this game to a friend :)
B004FGMDOQ|5|I love this book. It was perfectly paced and it seems to be this book was perfect fiction yet non fiction. I love the reality to the book yet the imagery feeling to it!!!!
B007URVZJ6|5|This has made transferring patterns much easier. I was able to use this book to build a template and save valuable time.
B00E8KLWB4|5|Very challenging game.  Don't need money to play.  Very addicting.
1423101499|5|My son said this book is 5 star and can't put it down!!!
B00OKYQZDI|5|Great game once you get the hang of it. Love the free 48 hours of lives. Haven't played any other game that gives you that. Thanks!
B00DVKOYBM|4|Love this game! Is good for practice too.
B001O1O71C|5|I loved this book although it was pretty sad towards the end I would not recommend this book to anyone under 10
B000OZ0NXA|4|I thought I had figured out the ending, but I was wrong. The book  kept my interest and I thought it was well written. I have ordered another  of Mr. Child's Reacher novels.
0783116934|5|Excellent Book, True  story, Great movie.
074356619X|5|If you are looking for answers in your life - about anything - listen to this audio book!  Amazing piece of work.  It re-enforced everything I believed in and gave me support that is often hard to find in the world we live in.  Wonderfully written and exciting to listen to.  I am on my second listen at this time.
0399143904|5|Tom Clancy continues to keep you on the edge of your seat with his latest, &quot;Rainbow Six&quot;.  Everyone says that this book is repetitive and gets boring. My question for them is what do you do on a regular basis that  can possibly be more exciting than this? In my opinion the book is a keeper  and I'll take a book like this anyday.
B0002VF5VG|1|The purchase was for a Region 1 and I recieved a Europe DVD so I sent it back.
B003XF1XOQ|5|great book....couldn't put it down!
B006TVQTHW|4|I bought this case in November 2012 for about $58; items I installed include a Gigabyte GA-Z77X-D3H Z77 motherboard, an MSI 670 graphics card, a Corsair CWCH80 (120 mm fan) CPU water cooler, an optical drive, a 3.5\\" hard drive, a 2.5\\" SSD, a Corsair CX600 PSU and three additional 120 mm case fans (one venting behind the motherboard, two blowing into the case on the front).<br />All items including the long graphics card fit inside, though the water cooler blocks direct access to some connectors on the motherboard (CPU power, one fan connector; be sure to hook those up first!). The cable routing is excellent and the tool-less 5.25\\" and 3.5\\" bays are convenient. All steel edges are properly rounded, presenting little danger of cutting oneself, and the overall quality of this case is very good. The included fans (1 x 120 mm, 1 x 140 mm) work well so far (1 month after purchase), and the front connections (USB 3.0, audio) have not presented any problems.<br />All in all, I'm pretty happy with the price, features and aesthetics of this case, but I do have the following concerns / suggestions for the next generation of this case:<br />1) The SSD mounts need at least 5 mm more clearance from the bottom of the case (or motherboard tray in the case of the mount there) as it is impossible to mount the drive properly (4 screws) and connect a SATA cable with the current clearance (at least with the cables of the power supply I used).<br />2) The 140 mm fan would be better located closer to the center of the case. As it is, in order to prevent the 120 mm water cooler fans from having to compete with the 140 mm fan at the top of the case, I had to direct the airflow from outside the rear 120 mm fan opening through the water cooler and up through the 140 mm fan; the cooler blocks about 15% of the area of the 140 mm fan. The obstruction would be a non-issue for a slimmer water cooler or a regular CPU cooler, but fans would still compete, both drawing air from the top corner.<br />3) Fan opening filters should be installed on all openings. They are only provided for the PSU opening (on the bottom of the case) and the front opening; the side openings (one just above the PSU / over the PCIe x16 expansion slot on the motherboard used here, the other below the CPU) do not have filters.<br />4) The number of included 3.5\\" bays (six) is excessive for most applications. Changing this to at most three 3.5\\" bays and adding at least two 2.5\\" trays would reduce materials cost, increase are flow from front fans and eliminate SSD mounting problems.<br />5) Instead of / in addition to grommets for mounting a user-assembled water cooler over the 140 mm fan at the top of the case, some type of opening that would allow the tubes of a pre-assembled unit to be routed out of the back of the case to externally mount a water cooler of that type over the 120 mm fan opening of the rear of the case would be useful.<br />6) The fan cage design (stamped from the cage and somewhat raised on the exterior rather than a detachable grill) may interfere with mounting a fan or fan filter outside the case (I have not yet tested this).<br /><br />Additional suggestions for potential buyers:<br />- I strongly suggest purchasing a 3.5\\" to 2.5\\" adapter bracket to mount any SSD in the 3.5\\" drive rack (probably about $10).<br />- If you intend to mount fans on the side openings (especially above the motherboard), I suggest getting fan extension cables.<br />- This case is larger than one might think based on the listing's picture alone, one should take note of the listed dimensions.
630237250X|5|Don't look Back gives every rock and roll fan a chance to go inside rock and roll's greatest mind, Bob Dylan.  The movie is extremely well directed and the footage is excellent
B00097A5I6|5|First of all, I should say I'm a huge fan of Oasis and know probably all of their songs, so I bought the CD the day after it was released, and I tell you, it's worth every single penny I paid for it. <br /> <br />I was surprised the first time I listened to the CD, as every single song on the album is excellent, as opposed to their last releases (SOTSOG had quite a few bad songs in it, and HC had \\"Better Man\\" as its weak link). All members look really good in this album, and it's great to see the end of the era when Noel was the only songwriter in the band. Not that I have anything against his songs (I absolutely adore his songs), but it's just great to see a band like Oasis (that's probably one of the best of the century, if not the best) undergoing such profound changes (for the better of course) in its style. The sound and vibration present in the new album is something unseen in any Oasis previous album, even WTSMG or DM. Don't Believe the Truth is a much more polished sound than anything you have ever heard from Oasis before. With a mix of old-fashioned riffs and vocals that send you right back to the 60's and lyrics that convey deeper meanings and make you think, Oasis seems to have found the balance between the explosion of their early years and the need for making more mature music. It's also remarkable that every one of the songs in the album is very easy to be played in a guitar. I mean, a beginner could play all these songs without much practice, there are no difficult solos or complicated intros. Nothing. And yet, it is flawless. I couldn't possibly name one thing that's not good in the whole CD. <br /> <br />All in all, DBTT is a glorious comeback for a glorious band who can't even be compared to The Beatles anymore; Oasis is far far beyond the music they once tried so hard to sound like. I said it once, and I stick to it: Oasis has become better than The Beatles. <br /> <br />Hey, why are you still reading this review?? Get off your buttocks and go buythis CD, NOW! \\"Don't Believe the Truth\\" is a must for any rock fan, believe me. You'll never even get close to regret buying this album.
0891419063|5|My mother and aunts and uncles lived though the experience of WWII and shared stories of the loved ones they lost then. This has fostered my intense interest in the war over the past 25 or so years. I find that Sledge's book is probably the best at describing the extreme range of emotions experienced by veterans of that war, particularly the foot solders.<br />I have had the privilege of talking with many veterans of WWII (many of whom are now departed), and while they spoke freely of their experiences, they usually tended to stay away from discussing their own trials. They focused on the highlights of their campaigns, comedic events, and their fallen brothers (who they universally consider heroes).<br />I think \\"With The Old Breed\\" provides an insight to the part of war that all these veterans felt reticent to share.<br />Again, \\"With the Old Breed\\" is not a dashing story, but it spills out the human emotions of the infantryman as well as any I have read.

067158037X|5|There is absolutely nothing like hearing a wonderful story straight from the horse's mouth.  I had heard from several people they felt this was a depressing book, but hearing it exactly as Frank McCourt intended, made it  a very different experience.  He made me laugh out loud, he brought tears  to my eyes, he made me fall in love with this book!
0670022411|4|I really loved this first book from Deborah Harkness and cannot wait for the next one.  The book started a little bit slow but then quickly built up steam.  Not only are there twists and turns as you come to understand the world she's portraying but you really come to understand and root for the characters she introduces.  A splendid blend of plot and characters.  I read quite a few series about mythical beings (witches, werewolves, etc.) and this is one of the best so far.  I strongly encourage you to try this book out.

B000000WA4|5|\\"Siamese Dream\\" was pretty epic, but nothing compared to this. \\"Mellon Collie\\" is The Smashing Pumpkins' massively successful double album; a bloated, 28 track affair that works a good 95% of the time.    This is obviously Billy Corgan's animal, and he put painstaking effort into it to make sure that every song sounds different from the last. Thus, it's like \\"The White Album\\" - massively diverse, with no common theme. It worked with The Beatles, and it works here.    Thus, you have everything from gentle piano instrumentals (the title track) to raucous, raging rock anthems (\\"Zero\\", \\"Bullet With Butterfly Wings\\", \\"Jellybelly\\") to sweeping prog-rock epics (\\"Porcelina of the Vast Blue Oceans\\") to orchestral pop bliss (\\"Tonight Tonight\\") to power pop (\\"Muzzle\\") to sonic noise assaults (\\"An Ode to No One\\") to wistful, beautiful ballads (\\"Galapogos\\", \\"To Forgive\\") to elegant dream pop (\\"Cupid De Locke\\") to sappy James Iha fluff (\\"Take Me Down\\").     And that's just the first disc!     The second disc is all over the map as well. There's towering, tempo-shifting guitar freakouts (\\"X.Y.U.\\"), raging rockers (\\"Bodies\\", \\"Where Boys Fear To Tread\\"), blistering death metal (\\"Tales of a Scorched Earth\\"), new wave pop perfection (\\"1979\\"), gorgeous ballads (\\"Farewell and Goodnight\\", \\"Thirty-Three\\"), stark accoustic confessionals (\\"Stumbeline\\"), soul (\\"Beautiful\\"), more majestic prog rock (\\"Thru the Eyes of Ruby\\"), carefree romps (\\"Lily\\"), sugary love songs (\\"By Starlight\\") and weird crap I can't describe (\\"We Only Come Out At Night\\").    I don't even think I named every song, and I'm still exhausted! However, don't be afraid of the sheer length of this album; \\"Mellon Collie..\\" is The Pumpkins' most accessible work. You're bound to find something you like, if not everything.     Best Songs: Tonight Tonight, Thru the Eyes of Ruby, Where Boys Fear to Tread, Bodies, Galapogos, Thirty-Three, Zero, Farewell & Goodnight.

0345803485|5|Yes, this book is hot, but it's also a really good story. It's a story about first love, the struggle with self-image and wondering whether you are \\"good enough\\" for another. Who hasn't ever felt that way?
B00HXYKYIE|5|This was so will researched.  A very suspenseful mystery, with a lot of interesting information about elephants. Loved it and would love to see it made into a movie.

B00FAPF5U0|5|Ok, I play a lot of games and this is the most fun, most challenging, most addictive of them all. You use all your FB friends to the max to get you into new areas and keeping the lives coming. Fun to try and pass them by too as you try to top their scores. This one is by far the best of them all. You have to get it then say goodbye to sleep!
B00847TKSE|5|I remember the press coverage at the time and the fact that everyone seemed to be following the story about the whales frozen in the ice up in Alaska.  It's amazing what can happen when everyone is trying to look good in the press!  Great movie, good performances by the whole cast.  Loved the native Alaskan man and his special bond with the animals his people hunted and revered.
B007JM4CWY|5|My favorite part of this game is trying to guess what the picture is going to be before your done.  The other five star reviews give accurate enough information about the playability and I agree with them.  Stylus use is not a must but would make it easier.  That is not a fault of the app just the nature of the game on a tiny screen.<br /><br />Update:  I finally completed all the puzzles in this app.  I am now working on CrossMe Color.  So from May 2012 ish to JAN 2013 ish  I say that's a pretty good app.
B00JB3MVCW|1|This movie was created by someone who wants to cash in on the hunger for Christian themed family movies.  This movie is neither Christian or family friendly.  Noah is portrayed as an obsessive jerk who thinks he has been called to destroy humanity because of their destruction of the environment. He decrees that they will be the last generation to live and then Creation will be the way &#34;Creator&#34; (they never use God) wanted it.  His daughter in law winds up pregnant on the Ark.  Noah is determined to kill the baby when it's born.  He finds himself unable to stab the baby in the face as she is held in her mothers arms.  The movie ends with him lamenting that he was unable to do what &#34;Creator&#34; wanted him to.  Save your time and money.

B004XJRQUQ|5|I have avoided reading this book since I heard about it after it's initial release. It's not that it didn't sound intriguing, children fighting to death in an artificially created arena (what's not to like?), but as an adult I oftentimes feel that anything within the \\"teen romance\\" genre simply shouldn't be for me. I mean, I haven't been a teenager in over a decade.  Finally, after the recommendation of many brilliant, age 30ish friends, I took the plunge and could not be more pleased. The author has created a fantastic world that you will absolutely fall in love with (and sometimes hate), one that even adults will appreciate. The only drawback of reading this series is finishing it and finding that you wish there was a fourth book...
B00IIUATDM|5|great movie
B00008AWOD|5|ever since I was exposed to this band I found myself hopelessly hypnotized by them. my first experience was with 'without you im nothing' then black market music. 'without you' was so finely crafted that I didn't hold too much hope for their other cds, but was so addicted to it I had to take the chance. black market was all I hoped it to be. a worthy sequel to their previous epic. I had heard sleeping with ghosts was different from the bands other outings, so I was skeptical at first. their sound was so good and worked so well before, would it still be any good different? as is obvious by my rating, yes. placebo is one of those rare bands that doesn't succeed because of their sound, but because of their raw talent. every song is full of soaring melodies that bring you way up, and far down all at the same time. each song is like a drug injected right into your veins and addicts you to it's rhythms right from the start. the feelings I get when I hear &quot;Plasticine&quot; are inspirational to say the least. I can't recommend it enough. however, if your one who liked only the heavy guitar saturated songs of 'without you' and didn't care for the slower ones in-between, I recommend sticking to black market music for now.
081297381X|1|Statistical models do not predict extremely rare events? Fitting curves to incomplete data gives inaccurate curves? Nothing new or revolutionary here, just an author so full of himself you will have a hard time stomaching the 400 pages of Nassim bashing academia and professionals using statistics right and left. To add insult to injury the writing itself is very poor, paragraphs do not transition well and the majority of the book is opinions and rants. Save yourself some time and money and stay away from this book.
B005LAII4E|5|Fun action film.
0143039881|5|I had long wanted to read Hannah Arendt's (1906 -- 1975) study of the Eichmann trial, \\"Eichmann in Jerusalem: A Report on the Banality of Evil\\" and was prompted at last to do so when I found the book on sale at my local library.  As I read, the controversial nature of Arendt's book was brought home to me. I decided I needed to read Arendt in tandem with a recent study of the trial, \\"The Eichmann Trial\\" (2011) by historian Deborah Lipstadt. [[ASIN:0805242600 The Eichmann Trial (Jewish Encounters)]] Lipstadt devotes a lengthy chapter to analyzing Arendt's book. Lipstadt, perhaps with the passage of time, sees the trial and its significance differently than does Arendt. Her treatment of Arendt is critical but balanced.  She offers many of the criticisms of Arendt's book that were made when the book was published but finds a good deal to praise in Arendt's account.  Although Arendt's and Lipstadt's book take opposing positions in many respects, this is not at all unusual in serious historical study.  There is much to be learned from both books. They are better read, I believe, as complementary, rather than as opposed.  For all its flaws and datedness, Arendt's book remains tough minded, provocative, and deeply thoughtful.  Even for readers who disagree with Arendt or who become angry with her, the book is worth reading and pondering.<br /><br />Arendt was a political philosopher who received an extraordinary education in pre WW II Germany.  Her teachers included the philosophers Martin Heidegger (with whom she had an affair) and Karl Jaspers. Arendt immigrated to the United States in 1941 and soon became a famous public intellectual.<br /><br />On May  11,1960, Adolph Eichmann was captured by Israeli operatives in Argentina and brought back to Israel to stand trial for his activities in the Holocaust. The capture and kidnapping of Eichmann resulted in substantial international controversy as did the trial itself.  Eichmann's trial began in April, 1961, with the accused sitting in a bullet-proof glass both which became famous in itself. The trial was held before three distinguished Israeli Judges, each of whom had received their legal training in Germany.  The chief prosecutor was Israeli Attorney General Gideon Hausner. Eichmann was defended by counsel of his choice, Robert Servatius, who had also been a lawyer for Nurenberg defendants.  After a lengthy trial, in which Eichmann testified and was cross-examined in great detail, the court found Eichmann guilty and sentenced him to death in December, 1961. The Israeli Supreme Court rejected Eichmann's appeal on May 29, 1962; and Eichmann was hanged two days later on May 31, 1962.  Arendt covered the trial for \\"The New Yorker\\".  Critics point out that she was not present for the entire trial. Her book is based not only on observation of the trial but upon Arendt's reading of the transcripts, affidavits and other materials, including Eichmann extensive pretrial statements, that Israel's government made available to the media at the time as well as upon additional sources.<br /><br />With all the criticism the book received at the time, Arendt's account of the trial was careful. The book is difficult to read and, in spite of her protestations to the contrary, is as much a work of political philosophy as it is a journalistic account of a trial.  Arendt criticized the kidnapping of Eichmann and the manner in which prosecutor Hausner conducted the trial.  She praised the Israeli judges and their approach to the case. It is sometimes overlooked that Arendt found that the Israelis were in the right in kidnapping Eichmann and in trying him before an Israeli court.  Arendt found that Eichmann amply deserved the sentence of death, and she approved of the Israelis carrying the sentence out expeditiously in the face of widespread arguments for commutation.<br /><br />Among other things, Arendt is criticized for applying the term \\"banal\\" to Eichmann. He appeared to her and to others as a mediocrity interested in his own career and in carrying out his orders rather than as a rabid Nazi and anti-Semite. She emphasized as do many modern writers the pervasive character of evil in WW II Germany and the lack of resistance.

B000003TAW|5|I bought this cd when it originally came out.I was around 12 at the time.I remember thinking how dorky \\"Buddy Holly\\" was but yet I loved the cd and song.At the time Weezer wasnt too popular so I didn't listen to the cd that much.A few years passed and I feel in love with Weezer all over again.They're all just so dorky you can't help but love them.That's not a bad thing though.They're just good happy music.I've driven 8 hours twice just to see them in concert.They put on great live shows.Anyway,Weezer is a great band and I think this is a really good cd.
B00139XTG4|4|Good read
B005ZOBNOI|5|So innocent, funny, real and sad. So glad our book club chose it..wonderful read! I will miss hazel Grace. Looking forward to reading another John green book
B0002IQJUK|4|This album is a real blessing when you`re melting on a hot summer day. I bought it one day before my mothers birthday, and it was a great excuse to not sit outside in the burning sun, but on my room being swepted away by Gavins raw voice. Even my stereo seemded to enjoy this cd.  <br />  It`s so great to see that there are still really talented artists out there, not just Britney`s that sing whatever there maneger tells them to, but artists that can write sing (and do spilts wile at it).  <br />  When you buy the cd you get two for the price of one, one of the two is a live recorded version of the origanel songs. When you listen to this one, you can really hear that this boy can sing. I was really pleased whit his version of the song A change is gona come. The only thing I can say is: Whaow.  <br />  It`s a must buy for everyfan out there, and the only reason I didn`t give it five stras is because I thought that it was a bit soft and friendly. I heard a stage recording once and \\"gosh\\" that boy can scream.
B007MDB71O|4|Flash Gordon.<br /><br />That's right, I said it.  For all the modern fascination with special effects, BLUE aliens, metal suits, flying fortresses and capes, my memories drift back to a childhood high cheese favorite named Flash Gordon.  See, in Flash Gordon, this human guy got mixed up in some bad alien juju at the hands of a bald bad guy.  Flying, fighting and high hokum of the Saturday night matinee ensue.  This is precisely what John Carter is.  In fact, John Carter has easily out Flash Gordon'd every single Star Wars prequel because George Lucas's pointless toy commercial epics never had the entertainment or fun factor Andrew Stanton's epic has here.<br /><br />What is wrong with people?<br /><br />How John Carter has been hated on is beyond me.  Wait, I get it, Avatar's aliens are blue not green!  Wait, the Avengers has a bigger flying fortress! Captain America, oh that's right, has a BLUE suit! We was robbed, because John Carter is a total sendup of the old style Disney nonsense adventures like Mary Poppins, Way Down Cellar and the original Escape to Witch Mountain.<br /><br />So let's get this straight, people will pay to see Loki stand around in those ridiculous plastic gold horns for two hours but not this?  What about the dog?  John Carter has that hilarious butt kicking dog!<br /><br />At least see it for the dog.  Did I mention the dog?
B000AP04L0|4|Gavin Pack  Although many recent college graduates dream of working in a corporate job with their own corner desk and a front row parking place, that fantasy is not always realized. Instead, many are thrown into a life of dull, repetitive work, and made to work in a cubicle with no windows. Mike Judge satirizes this mediocre life in his movie Office Space, the story of Peter Gibbons, a man so bored with his day to day routine that he finally snaps. In this parody of \\"Corporate America,\\" Judge earns laughs with witty dialogue, but also breaches a deeper meaning through his uncannily realistic view of work in a dysfunctional company. I really enjoy this movie, not only because of the comedic aspects like the extreme characters and sarcastic banter, but also because of its relevance to the modern workplace.   Generally, critics love Office Space as much as its cult followers. However, there are some movie critics that disagree. Rick Groen claims that the writer and director, Mike Judge, cannot follow through to the end of the feature length film because of his background primarily in short TV cartoons. Instead, Groen sees the film as starting off strong, but losing steam towards the end. But overwhelmingly, reviewers of the movie praise the \\"good-natured comedy about the suppressed rage and paranoia of unappreciated employees\\" (Elias). Although professional critics see the movie as cunning, witty, and uproarious, Office Space did not generate a large crowd at the theaters (Box Office Mojo), and even a smaller fan base. I like to think that I am a part of the cult culture surrounding the movie, much like the groups that are so fanatic about movies like Fight Club or Donnie Darko.     The issues brought up in Office Space still apply to many people, even though there is a relatively small fan base. Contrary to the movie Clockwatchers, in which jokes about an office environment quickly go away, \\"revealing a surprising, almost surreal core of unhappiness and mistrust amongits central characters,\\" all of the serious issues brought up in Office Space are hidden subtly behind parody and satire (Davis). Of course, most Americans' lives are not quite as dull as Peter Gibbon's, since the movie Office Space is a parody of corporate culture in America. Not only does Peter Gibbons have a dull and repetitive job--updating bank software for \\"the 2000 switch\\"--but he is also stuck in a cubicle, depriving him of all natural light. Just to the other side of his cubicle wall is a huge window, with a great view of a tree and some rolling hills. In one scene, after Peter snaps, he unscrews the outside wall of the cubicle and knocks it down, letting all the papers and memos fall everywhere. Aside from his cramped and unnatural workplace, Peter is under several middle-management level executives who all seem to have overlapping responsibilities. Each one stops by to remind Peter that he failed to put a cover sheet on his TPS report. The vice president of the company where Peter works, Initech, is Bill Lumbergh, represents the stereotype of corporate bosses and the antagonist of the movie. Lumbergh repeatedly asks his employees to come into work on Saturdays while he roams around the office aimlessly with a cup of coffee, instead of actively managing his employees.   Perhaps Office Space pokes the most fun at the way companies hire \\"efficiency consultants\\" to help with productivity, but in the process of streamlining the consultants completely halt all work. The two consultants hired by Initech in the movie are known as \\"The Bobs\\" and meet Peter after his snap. In this sudden change, Peter takes on an attitude of complete apathy after his therapist suffers a heart attack in the midst of hypnotization, leaving Peter in an unrealistic state of deep relaxation. Ironically, The Bobs are completely taken with Peter, even after he openly admits that he really \\"does nothing\\" all day. Other employees in the company do much more work, like Peter's friends Michael and Samir, but they are fired for reasons clear only to the consultants. Instead of keeping workers that are efficient, The Bobs keep Peter, who is disrespectful to his boss and plays Tetris all day.  These kinds of consultants are a parody of the type of corporate planning and strategizing that became so popular in the 1990s. Lumbergh, the VP of Initech, is also seen in front of a whiteboard reading \\"Planning to Plan,\\" another stab at new ideas and attempts to streamline corporate offices that really defeat their own purpose.    One of the most praised aspects of the movie is its larger than life characters. Because of his background in animation, Mike Judge exaggerates the characters' personalities so that \\"every personality trait is magnified\\" (Ebert). Characters like Bill Lumbergh, written to be the stereotype of a corporate boss in the 1990s, wears \\"gold-rimmed aviator glasses, a ski-resort tan and a contrasting-collar dress shirt,\\" and Tom, a 50ish functionary who lives in constant -- and justified -- terror of being downsized,\\" are played out to the extreme by the actors. Peter's two friends, Michael Bolton, who resents the famous singer with his same name, and Samir Nagheenanajar, whose last name no one can pronounce, both dislike their jobs, but appreciate the security. After they are both fired, they take out their anger at the company by taking their misbehaving copy machine to an empty field and destroy it with baseball bats. The most animated character and my personal favorite is Milton, an employee who was \\"let go\\" years ago, but through a glitch in the payroll continues to be paid every week. Instead of deciding to take on a lifestyle of apathy, like Peter, Milton combats the stresses of corporate life by being overly protective of his possessions, especially his stapler.    Not only does the movie Office Space poke fun at corporate businesses, but it also satirizes the mediocre lives of the people that work in those jobs. Mike Judge expresses theimpatience of many Americans through his subtle and witty humor in a satire about life in Corporate America. Everyone who has worked in an office can pick out at least a few foibles from some of the extreme characters that remind them of past or present coworkers. The issues brought up comically in the movie resonate with its audience long after the final credits.      [...]
B00000637V|5|O.k. reviewing this c.d. is tricky since I believe it is different from any other work of music done before it or since. The producer Bob Ezrin once told lou before this album was released that they should put this  album in a box, put that box in a closet, Lock the closet and forget it  ever exists. Sometimes I wish he had. This album is one of the most amazing  albums I have ever heard. It can be so beautifull in the dark corners it  explores but it rips your emotions apart. Somedays I just want to throw the  album away because it puts me in such a deep state of depression but at the  same time I can't stop listening to it. If you like lou's work try this cd  with open arms but don't say you wern't warned
B00GTCECVG|3|Good game - Fun !
B00GGETKE6|5|I laughed until I cried.  This is one of my favorite comedies I have ever watched.  I would definitely recommend it.
B00JB3NUHM|1|The books better than the movie.
B00ARPMIJE|5|This book is very good and now one of my favorites. :) It's super great and has a good story.
B009UX2YAC|5|Its a Blast! If I had to buy it it would be worth the money! I play it on the bus going home. Bad days instantly turn good!
B00IXXTXQI|5|Never seen a performance movie like it .. Byrne opens alone, then adds the band one by one as the songs come along. A stark stage, no skyrockets, sparklers or strobe lights blinding you, just brilliant performances driven by a musical genius .. If you like the Talking Heads, you will love this movie.
B000HT3Q3M|5|Al Jarreau is still, owner of one of the most spellbinding voices into the universe of the crooners since the Eighties. Much more consistent than Lou Rawls, Jarreau knew to achieve his glory moment with Moonlighting and so to get a major audience overseas.<br /><br />The fantastic musical arrangements and his powerful charisma have made of him one of the most estimated, favorite and beloved stars around the muysical firmament.<br /><br />So when he decided to materialize this well expected project with this living legend of the Jazz - George Benson - the outcome could not be more gratifying and splendid .<br /><br />And despite the risk to make this utterance, I would say that we are in presence of a classic album that will transcend the test of time for the new gene4rations to come.<br /><br />In case you don't have it, please go for it. It will be a rewarding experience.
B004XDYJRU|3|It does not allow you to save your favorite radio stations. Am I doing it wrong!
B00004THAY|4|Let's get something straight.  I have never listened to BB King before.  I kinda like Eric Clapton, but, eh, his new stuff has been lacking something from his days with Cream.  So I picked up this album not expecting to be  very impressed.  I slipped it in on the way back from work and...I couldn't  believe it!  I could not change the CD.  I had with me 60 other CDs, yet, I  couldn't stop listening.  The music captivated me.  The CD starts out great  with &quot;Riding With the King&quot; to set the mood, then, it seamlessly  goes in and out from blues song to blues song.  I thought that some of a  few of the songs could have taken a little snip-snip, especially the ones  that were seven or eight minutes, but they were tolerable.  The interaction  between Eric Clapton and BB King is what the whole album is about.  The way  their guitars and voices bounce off each other is just sweet nectar to the  ears.  They also avoid the trap that many blues artists fall into: all the  tracks do not sound the same.  Each track is an individual, yet the whole  album, confluent.  The only criticism I have of the CD is that I think that  some of the songs could have been shorter, and a few could have used a  little bit more originality.  Beyond that, there is the fact that you will  probably not want to listen to this CD all the time.  It is an experience  to listen to, that much is true, but it is not an experience to be repeated  each day on the way to work; it's just too rich to be taken in that many  times.  Bravo to Eric Clapton and BB King, for combining talents in a way  that any other artists would not have been able to acomplish.
B00IEOC4OO|5|This is really one of the most fun game apps I've ever played. It's silly and random, just what I like. I would love too see this updated with new stuff to keep the fun going. Definitely a gem find for the FAOTD when I downloaded it.
B00A822VDY|4|You would think with John Goodman and Billy Crystal at the comedy helm, this movie would have delivered much more fun and craziness and also be much more 'colored' in it's humor. Yeah, it's alright for a G, but I think it would have worked better if it was more adult-oriented with a minimum of PG-13 rated stuff coming from the lips of two of the best improv-style comedians that we know. This leads me to believe that &#34;Monsters University&#34; can't possibly be that reflective of college pranks and life and will be a bigger let-down than &#34;Monsters, Inc.&#34; was.
B00FAPF5U0|5|Really love this game. I am hooked
B007FEFLTO|5|Anxiously I have awaited the second book in this Triology and it has not disappointed!!  Anyone that is a fan of Ken Follett's novels will  be entranced and as spellbound as with the first!  I highly recommend  \\"The Winter of the World!\\"
B009ZQC7MY|5|the storyline is well constructed and the acting is outstanding.  There are very few lulls in the plot as every scene seems to have a purpose to drive the storyline forward.
B0083GQKQG|4|My teenage daughter & I watched this movie together. We both really enjoyed it. I love Tilda Swinton- she does some intense movies. I do not like blood, but this movie is more pyshological than blood & guts.  Go see this movie...
B005LAIGPA|5|This movie really came out of nowhere and really surprised me with how good it was. It had great characters in it and a very unique plot that was executed perfectly. the special effects were also very impressive for a movie with only a 12 million dollar budget! you must see this movie!!!
B00FBR8130|5|Extremely badass, awesome buy
B00C8S9VKM|5|Fascinating. I always enjoy Bill Bryson's books and this was no exception.  It was a fascinating look at history without feeling the least bit like a textbook.  All the pieces were woven so well together that it almost read like a novel.  A most enjoyable look at a truly unique period in history.
B006T9Y278|2|I couldn't explain why i hated this movie without spoiling it, but it was ridiculously predictable to the point that it was uncomfortable to watch. You know what's going to happen and when it's going to happen and they just draw it out seemingly forever. The accents seem inauthentic.
B000VBJEEG|5|Arrived on time and a super movie to watch!
B007RTAR64|5|My daughter requested this after seeing the movies. Sellers on ebay were selling the clothes without the doll which is a joke. This is perfect.
B00127RAJY|5|It is a good workout. I worked up a sweat in the 20 minutes.
159463176X|5|This book met my expectations!  Khaled Hosseini is a master at weaving a story together.  The story was beautifully written and kept me turning pages until the very end. He did a wonderful job showing how family ties really do bind us together - whether or not we realize it.
B00AEBEQW8|3|Cute, but what was the point?  It was a bit of a disappointment. Too many other more interesting  children's books available.
B000002B7U|4|For some reason, nobody gives Jake E Lee the credit he deserves as one of Ozzy Osbourne's guitarists.  He's better than Randy Rhoads, although not by much, and he's much better than Zakk Wylde (who is also good).  Jake E Lee's playing is at its best on this album. All of the songs are really good.  The best tracks on this album are Ultimate Sin, Lightning Strikes, and Shot In The Dark, but \\"Killer of Giants\\", \\"Secret Loser\\", \\"Thank God For The Bomb\\" and \\"Never Know Why\\" are also good.  The weakest track on the album is \\"Never\\", but it isn't bad.  This is still Ozzy's best album.  It ties with Blizzard of Ozz.
B003XTYDMQ|5|Great series.  Wish it lasted longer.  To bad the end leaves you hanging since it was cancelled before the season finale.
B0020BUWX2|4|I felt every emotion and every pain as if it were happening to me.  I can't wait to watch the movie.
B00E9E4EC8|5|Alan Jackson is  my favorite country singers,  I am not to crazy about Bluegrass but was willing to Alan a shot.  His CD is so good that I am wishing he would do another one.
B00DR0PDNE|4|I use it only from Youtube from the laptop and Samsung S4, there are delays sometimes. The setup was a bit frustrating, there is not enough tutorial.
1742200206|4|I like this guide a lot.  I think it has been well-designed from a usability perspective.<br /><br />Within the first 50 pages, there are topical listings of recommended attractions.  The next 200 pages focus on specific areas in Manhattan.  Brooklyn and Queens get 50 pages.  Within these pages, each section has a blurb, listing of sights, places to eat, and entertainment.  The maps in this section describe neighborhood walks.<br /><br />There is a separate 25-page section on accommodations --- which I think is much better than the Frommers placement within each neighborhood, because when you visit New York City, the public transportation system greatly expands your walking-distance radius.<br /><br />Then 30 pages on history, a 15-page handy reference list, and then 30 pages of maps.<br /><br />I want to highlight the maps.  In the Frommers guide, the maps are only helpful for answering: I know the name of something, now where is it?  The Lonely Planet maps have that, and the color coded numbered icons and topical grouping allow you also to answer: I am here, what's around me that's interesting (or where I can eat)?  And also, I want to eat/drink/sightsee (do a general activity instead of visit a specific landmark), where should I go?<br /><br />As other reviewers have noted, some information is out of date or wrong.  For example, the taxi fare between Manhattan and JFK in both directions has been a flat rate for many years now.  In 2012, the rate was increased to $52 plus a $0.50 surcharge plus tolls (if you take any tunnels or the RFK bridge); but the book (published August 2012) still says $45.
B008UCJ7KO|1|No plot.<br />No character development.<br />Created more questions than it answered.<br />Obviously, a shameless money grab extending the original 3 books to 5.<br />Seriously, don't waste your time!  I'm upset that I can't return this pile of crap, since I bought through Apple and they don't do returns.  So glad to know Amazon does though.  If I could give it negative stars I would.  The author lost me forever, this could have been a neatly wrapped up story ending a series that sucked a lot of people in from the beginning, but no.  Either the author is seriously blocked for material or the publisher asked her to milk it by turning the last book into 3.  Sucks either way.
B00DJFIMW6|4|I love this game. I play it a lot and I find the game very funny and fun. If you don't have this game get it.

B00AESN8XY|5|I love playing this while my boyfriend plays his ps3, and its cool because each round is different. It took me 4 tray to successfully kill all population.
B00NX53H2W|5|U2 Just Keep Getting Better With Age - I love this album and it was definitely worth the wait. The track - &#34;The Crystal Ballroom&#34; has to be one of my favorite U2 songs of all time. The story behind the song is just as beautiful. I would love to see a music video of this song with the band jammin' in the studio, underneath a crystal mirror-ball chandelier. It's a real rocking' tune that U2 fans have to hear. Great choice of producers: Danger Mouse, Paul Epworth, etc. As always, if you love their studio albums, just wait until they start playing these songs live, on tour. Thanks U2 for the free album. It's a classic and worth buying! - A+++++ & 10 stars!
B00CO4GO7I|5|Great book!
B007PT3QOQ|1|This app won't load on the kindle fire. Sticks at the loading screen.  Thankfully the app was free. I would not rrcommend.
B00DJFIMW6|3|This is a fun little running game, but it has a major drawback.  Almost everything requires coins that you must purchase with real money. You can't upgrade the bonuses all the way or unlock most characters without these coins, and the amount you can earn in the game is next to nothing. The other drawback is that it can be a tedious waste of time trying to get to a different level than the one you're running on - unless, of course, you have the coins to pay for it! I would give this 5 stars if only everything didn't cost money!
B00EMXBDMA|5|Mark Watney is one of the most lovable characters I have ever read. Hilarious and incredibly clever. A really, really fun read.
B00BLCHYKU|5|Amazing series!! Catch your breath moments and exciting.
B00E8KLWB4|1|The graphics in general are decent,  but it can be difficult to find the objects, as they are so tiny. And since each scene is timed,  can get pretty frustrating. I am one of those &amp;#34;completists&amp;#34; who feel the need to at least complete the game, even if I dont necessarily like it and am seriously considering uninstalling.
B007J4T2G8|4|I really enjoyed this book. I don't read romance novels, I didn't know a thing about BDSM before I read it. The sexual content was a bit graphic for me, but I was very surprised to find that I really enjoyed this story. Anastasia and Christian are compelling characters and I read through all three books in three days. That said, as much as I enjoyed the story the writing was fairly repetitive--adjectives were heavily overused and I think this is a great story that could be told better.
B00G4Q3KOC|1|I was not impressed with this movie, I don't understand why it won so many awards.  The storyline was no different than any other story that we have seen in the past about slavery,  from the credits I understand that it was a true story but it certainly was not worthy of making a movie of it.  I am sure that other people have better stories to tell than this one.
B0015AARJI|5|nice
B003QSS2VW|5|This Disney Classic is one of my all time favorites. I still find it to be cute and funny. It makes for a great &#34;movie night&#34; movie for the whole family.

0805066691|5|Well here are my 2 cents on this book. I own one and I love the book, cos it speaks the truth! It shows the reality how the White Man treated the indians. Some chapters was so horrible when they described the horror the native americans had to hold out that it made me cry and I just had to put the book away for a few days, before I could go on with reading it, cos I pictured that horror the native americans had to endure, I did put myself into their shoes and did suffer with them. I lived and died with them too. My heart goes out to ALL native american indians. I only can recommend this book to those who loves the truth and want to hear the truth. This book is just heartbreaking and be prepared to cry a lot of tears. You will ask yourself lots of questions and they will always begin with the word: \\"WHY.....\\" Its 100% worth to be read and should be read by everybody, then you will discover the biggest shame of the United States - committed crimes against a people who was there first.
1451629184|3|First, let me say that I give 5 stars for Jaycee the woman/mother/daughter.  She is a true inspiration for us all.  What she went through over those 18 years is just horrible.  I give this memoir 3 stars though because I do feel that the story is missing a tremendous amount around the psychology of why it appears that she did not attempt to escape and how she, to a degree, learned to live with her kidnappers.  I believe under the surface that Jaycee not having a true father figure played into how things played out.  I certainly picked up that she had very serious issues with her step-father (Carl) and she did not want to return to a situation with him in the picture.  The possibility of escape also became more complicated when she had the girls.  There is also the psychological history of her kidnappers which is not addressed here.  Thank god for her mom, sister, and aunt as it kept her hope burning ever so lightly over the years.    All in all this book was a way for Jaycee to help heal.  We learned a little as she continues with her reunification process.  There is a more detailed book to be published down the road but lets give her time to decide when or if she chooses to write that book.

B000LE1GVW|4|The one thing that I really like about this CD is the lyrics; They are unconventional and winding; They touch on subjects you didn't expect to hear, and often evoke emotions from inside you didn't think a song could bring out. Coupled with the passion in his voice and some truly great melodies, this guy is someone to watch. Reminds me a little of Cat Stevens at times, but he is a true original for sure. A unique voice w/something to say.
B00CKOYVG8|5|my son loves this game along with all the other Angry Birds games out there. He does not have a facebook account so he uses mine and plays with my friends that play this game, most of are cousins and know it is my son.
0307454894|5|The book was recommended to me by a friend who insisted that I read it.  Three quarters of the way through the book I was wondering why!  Well the ending makes the reading of the first three quarters all worthwhile.  I understood why my friend wanted me to read the book and I was thankful that I did.  Enjoy

B00I3WTXCS|3|The game was okay, the puzzles were complex enough and did allow you to skip the puzzle if you were not interested in it any more. The puzzles do not reset to the beginning though, which most games have a reset key. So if you mess them up, you are in trouble. This is still primarily a hidden-object game, with some interspersed puzzles. My biggest compliant is the game fails to have a story line. Its odd, all the pieces to make a story (newspapers, pictures, etc.) are there, but the story (which I really enjoyed in the first game) seems to have been side tracked. If they put the story back in it, I would probably give it more stars.
B00FATEJYE|1|Repeating what everyone else is saying, the updates have made the game glitch in a way that prevents you from playing any part of it. When you try to uninstall and reinstall, it wipes your progress, deleting any characters and coins you have gained, including coins that many of us have spent REAL MONEY on.<br /><br />I'm not sure what's worse: losing the coins that I paid actually money for, or losing all the progress that I've made in the game over the last month. Either way, I'm left with a bad taste in my mouth and a feeling like WB took my money, then gave me the middle finger. If you have micro transactions in a game, there should be someway to account for those transactions. It's not right to spend $20+ on a game, then have the things you purchased get removed while the company keeps your money. They took our money, then deleted what we bought. We all deserve refunds, at the very least.<br /><br />WB HAS STOLEN MONEY FROM ANYONE THAT PURCHASED COINS AND TRIED TO FIX THEIR SCREWED UP GAME!

0393061310|2|Although Diamond's thesis is the central role that geography plays in the development of societies, he has another intention: to undermine any racist ideas that try to explain the varied development of these societies. Unfortunately, he often strains to push forward this laudable claim at the expense of balanced reason.<br /><br />Guns, Germs, and Steel consistently suffers from poor or inconsistent argumentation. In the prologue he states that he has the \\"impression that New Guineans are smarter than Westerners\\" (p. 20) because, \\"modern European and American children spend so much of their time being passively entertained by television, radio and movies\\" (p. 21). Yet he consistently repeats that at least 13,000 years of history is needed to assess peoples and cultures; to do otherwise would lead to racist conclusions.  How can he then make inference about a people's intelligence based on 100 years of history? In Chapter 15, he recounts how two British men died on an expedition from North to South Australia, unable to cope with the hot Australian climate and difficult terrain: \\"Robert Burke and William Wills were smart enough to write, but not smart enough to survive in Australian desert regions\\" (p. 321).  He makes a similar case about him and his wife's difficult trek in Australia. But, repeatedly he states that one of the conditions of long-term success for any people is population size.  No doubt, a large population facilitates specialization and adaptation.  So how can he draw race-based inferences about intelligence based on a sample size of four? In other arguments, he begs the question: for example, he points to today's undomesticated animals and uses that assessment as evidence that they were not domesticable 13,000 years ago (and are not domesticated today) (p. 162-175).<br /><br />On other occasions he invokes various political philosophies - and does a disservice to them.  Diamond provides an incorrect summation of the ideas of Aristotle and Rousseau inorder to compare their ideas about the foundations of societies with his own. Aristotle does not argue that \\"states [are] the natural condition of human society\\" (p. 282). Rather, Aristotle is not even interested to discuss communities other than the city-state (polis) because he wants to discuss a partnership of free and inter-relating human beings. Moreover he considers man a political animal because he is driven to live in a community - whether it is a state, chiefdom, tribe or band is irrelevant.  Only in a human society can man fulfill his true nature - this is Aristotle's line of reasoning.  Rousseau did not \\"speculate that states are formed by a social contract, a rational decision reached when people calculated their self-interest\\" (p. 283). Instead, Rousseau argued that society should be organized as a contract between free individuals. A social contract is not a description of how society is or has been, but how it should be. Equality is the natural human state; while society had been used to impose artificial restraints.  Rousseau's social contract is prescriptive, not descriptive.  He also offers a superficial Marxist interpretation of the role of religion.  It is meant to placate the masses in accordance with the wishes of the ruling class (pp. 277-278).  I don't know why Diamond does not consider the multitude of other anthropological explanations for the development of religion: it offers consolation; it provides meaning and makes sense of man's role in the universe; it gives conceptual coherence to many disparate and confusing phenomena, etc. Wouldn't an anthropological approach be more commensurate with his methodology?<br /><br />I don't deny Diamond's thesis that geography has played and continues to play a vital role in the development of mankind. Indeed, I agree with it, although there are other factors at play, such as culture, values, commerce and warfare which can and have trumped geography. It is a perspective that historians and philosophers have long considered.  At least as far back as the 17th century, Montesquieu argued, in The Spirit of the Laws, that climate and geography shape the character of peoples.<br /><br />Ultimately this book is a hodge-podge of unconvincing arguments, inappropriate summaries, and recent anthropological scholarship. It is the last feature which is the book's only worthwhile feature: it provides a consolidation of various interesting research on agriculture, language, and tools.

0307265730|2|Lahiri's work has become predictable: children of middle or upper class Bengali immigrants adopt American customs, causing consternation to their traditional parents/family. Most of this isn't even especially well written. She had some earlier successes, notably the Third and Final Continent, but this is just getting boring.<br /><br />Most of her characters suffer the same life altering but not necessarily fatal flaw: unwilling to  accept familial change, they simply turn away. Thus, a young man walks out on his father when he fails to connect with his new stepmother and step sisters and a young mother lets her father walk out of her life when she begins to suspect his travel companion is actually a girlfriend.<br /><br />In July '08, the Frank O'Connor Short Story prize committee announced that it was taking the unusual step of announcing Lahiri as the annual contest's outright winner rather that pare the long list of almost 40 names down to five and then announcing the winner at the festival. Apparently, the judges found her work to be so superior to the other nominees that they felt suspense was unwarranted. I for my part don't see it. The irony is that given the breadth of Frank O'Connor's work--childhood, love, soldiership, and on and on--Lahiri seems limited to the same old characters and ideas.

It is amazing what one takes away from each read of these books as their own life changes and matures (college, single, career, married, children, grandchildren, ....).

0439023513|5|I had so many people give me their opinions about this trilogy, and many of them didn't like the third book, so my expectations were quite low.  I must say, though, that I LOVED this book.  As an editor, I was a bit surprised at some of the things Collins got away with; as a romantic, I would have liked to have seen her spend a little more time on the romance part of the story.  As a human being, I just couldn't get enough of this story.  It's beautiful and tragic and raw and compelling and just plain phenomenal!  Despite a few mechanical and other minor flaws, it's a great book!  If you like a book that's wonderfully revolutionary, darkly provocative, and emotionally epic, this is for you.  I got teary-eyed several times throughout the novel, but the truth is that I was reading too fast, desperate to see what happened next, to let myself feel the emotion of it all.  With all that energy pent up, I read the quiet, understated afterword at the end.  And cried.  I totally want to read the entire trilogy again.  Don't let all the negative reviews out there get you down.  If you liked the first two books, you'll love the third.  It's an awesome, climatic, mind-blowing end to a story that's shattering on so many levels.  Let yourself get lost in it!

B001NHNG64|4|It's an old trope for a reason.  Some of us can't resist it. The competent old warrior who wants to be left alone but keeps getting drawn into situations only a man with his skills can deal with. I think the author has admitted to wanting to write a knight errant. He does it well. Not the actual writing, this isn't about style. It's about story. The story's good.<br />A mysterious adventure, or is it an adventurous mystery? It's certainly tense. And thrilling.  Maybe it's a thriller. I never knew exactly what a thriller was. Maybe this is it.<br />It's a long rambling story like the first one, although this one is tighter. Either way you want to keep turning pages and you're always pleased at the end.

B0000A0DRY|5|1966 and 1967 were the peak years of Western pop and rock music, as far as I'm concerned. So much great music came out in a short span of just two years - the Beatles, the Kinks, the Doors, the Who, Jefferson Airplane, Pink Floyd, the Rolling Stones, the Yardbirds, the Beach Boys, and other groups put out a series of superb singles and albums. Right in the middle of this period, in February '67, the month the Beatles released their greatest single \\"Strawberry Fields Forever / Penny Lane\\", Jefferson Airplane released their second LP \\"Surrealistic Pillow\\", one of the landmark albums of the 60s. Airplane's two best and most successful singles \\"Somebody to Love\\" and \\"White Rabbit\\" came from this album.    \\"Pillow\\" is a thoroughly enjoyable mixture of harder and softer rock, with a Byrd-esque/Simon&Garfunkel-esque folk rock flavoring, but laced with psychedelic sounds and lyrics. The album starts off in grand style with the wonderful riff-based rocker \\"She Has Funny Cars\\", a title that has nothing to do whatsoever with the actual lyrics. The song alternates between harder verses of descending notes and lovely softer verses - and ends with a delectable explosion of psychedelic guitarwork (it's a pity this wasn't put in the middle of the song as well). Ten songs later, the album (i.e. the original LP) ends with the fabulous \\"Plastic Fantastic Lover\\" which sounds to me very much like a Simon & Garfunkel song that strayed into a Jefferson Airplane album - the singer could be Paul Simon, but it's Marty Balin.     In between, we have JA's two best-known songs (the hit singles I mentioned - and yes, they're both glorious!), a couple of beautiful ballads, one hard rocker (\\"3/5 of a Mile\\") and several melodious mid-tempo tunes. And then there are the bonus tracks, the most outstanding being the blues epic \\"In the Morning\\" and the sizzling rocker \\"Go to Her\\" - these songs are magnificent. In fact, this second version of \\"Go to Her\\" is probably one of the greatest rock 'n roll tracks ever recorded - amazing singing, amazing guitarwork! (The first version - on JA's debut album - isn't bad either.) And speaking of electric guitarwork, I don't think any group matches JA in this area.    There's also a short instrumental (\\"Embryonic Journey\\") which has been highly praised - for sure, it's nice acoustic guitar, but I prefer the much longer, darker, and eerier electric-psychedelic \\"Spare Chaynge\\" on JA's next album \\"After Bathing at Baxter's\\", another great must-own record. JA's debut \\"Jefferson Airplane Takes Off\\" is also indispensable. By the way, all three of these CDs (the 2003 versions) come with booklets with excellent liner notes and great photos.
0439023521|5|I picked up the book simply to see what all the hype was about and I was transported into an unexpected world. I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It is such a great story of perseverence. This book reminded me of Ender's Game but better. I recommend to everyone!!
B000V4UFZK|5|It's an old movie, but really well done. Also excellent digital restoring and remastering, along with excellent sound. Some of the dialogue and scenes have become common Clich&eacute;s now with over use, but they were groundbreaking at the time. It was entertaining and gripping, the only thing missing was a John Williams scoring, which drives the theme and mood of all of Spielberg movies. (Goldsmith's scoring was okay.)
1592400876|5|EATS, SHOOTS & LEAVES <br /> by LYNNE TRUSS <br /> <br />- A BOOK REVIEW by K Vethiveloo (KVVeloo)  <br /> <br />I do not know how many of you had the opportunity to read the book titled: \\"Eats, Shoots & Leaves\\" by Lynne Truss. <br />It is listed as the Runaway #1 British Bestseller.  <br />  <br />The catchy title beguiles one's expectation.  My first reaction was one of curiosity but when I went through the blurb, I found it was merely a book on punctuation.  As I dropped it, I was muttering under my breath, \\"I had enough of it in primary and secondary school\\".  I still recall vividly the popular book on grammar with which I grew up in school.  It was called \\"A General Certificate English Course\\" by Lancelot Oliphant.   <br />  <br />To re-learn punctuation at this age was an admission of doubt in one's use of the English Language.  One may ask why now- when no one has ever pulled me up for wrong usage of punctuations. Neither have I found fault with others. A friend of mine, who must be excused for his poetic licence, took exception recently with one of my colleagues for reformatting his email message with proper punctuation marks.  Indeed, many of us do not intentionally question the appropriateness of our punctuation marks in our written language.  We assume we are correct.  It simply flows. <br />  <br />There is, however, much to punctuation. Take for example the title of the book: Eats, Shoots & Leaves\\".  Does it refer to a Texas cowboy who enters a shady saloon, takes his bite, shoots the bartender and blows the smoke of his gun and leaves nonchalantly?  Could the title be more appropriately refer to a panda that Eats shoots and leaves?  One of the classical examples of the mischief that punctuation can create is shown in the following sentence which, I think, has appeared often in the internet. <br />     <br />        A woman, without her man, is nothing. <br />        A woman: without her, man is nothing. <br />  <br />Lynne Truss \\"teaches\\" correct punctuation in a novel way- like telling a story spiced with humour.  I wish I had her book instead of the dry and staid grammar books of the old days. The book takes on all - the comma, the apostrophe, the semi colon, the colon, the dash, and the inverted commas and so on.   <br /> <br />In her own witty manner she deplores that with the advent of emails and text messages punctuation may well have to retire.  She might well be right.  I had an email message recently and I thought it was from a CIA agent who probably thought that I was his colleague. It appeared like a coded message.  I could not decipher what this friend of mine was trying to say. He took exception when I pointed out that he should write good English- not rufree@4:-).  <br />  <br />Well, those who have not read the book, please do so. It is enjoyable reading and most of all serves as a welcome revision. It might bring back poignant memories of one's school days. With that, I leave you one of the following sentences from the book to crack you head on: <br />  <br />                    \\"The tap water is safe to drink in tea and coffee, however, we recommend using bottled water for drinking, it can be purchased very cheaply in the nearby shops.\\" <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />
B00FJ2YTLK|5|I'm so glad I got to read this book, but I'm also so very sad that it's over. I was reading it at the very beginning. I had to wait for what felt like forever, and when it finally came out I was going to read the series again so I remembered everything...... I couldn't wait. so I suggested people read this I'm so going to read it again!

B00DR0PDNE|5|I love my Chrome Cast.  Anything I can watch on my computer, tablet, smartphone- can be sent to the TV for viewing on a bigger screen.  I've had mine for a few months now and watch everything for free.  Some images have better quality than others but I've found that most of the companies who transmit via the internet will be adding the chrome cast option for their signals- just like Red Box, Hulu, You Tube, etc.  The setup was easy as plugging the 'thingamajig' into the tv and clicking a few links on the computer and it has worked tirelessly for the past few months.  I watch all the NFL games, Baseball Games, etc for free! As well as the network stations and anything else I can find online.  The Chrome Cast is a big hit here at home and worth the $$$ at twice the cost.
B005LAIHY0|3|I really enjoyed the film -- the special effects were beautiful and truly epic and artful.  Though overall the film seemed to miss the mark, for me anyway. It was definitley a thought provoking film about creation but the rest of the story brought nothing new to the genre or franchise. The thing I enjoyed about the first film in the series was the claustiphobic feel and the lonliness of space - I was hoping that would be reflected in this film as well. The acting in this did not feel fresh to me and unfortunatly being a big fan of the first, I enjoyed the improvisation of the acting and how it didn't feel scripted at all - which brought realism and humanity to the first Alien film.  And truth be told I was looking for a few more scares but that is just me.  I would recommend the film a good watch but not the classic chills like \\"Alien\\" or the classic thrills \\"Aliens\\" gave us.

0783225857|5|To those who judge a book by its cover, Gregory Peck in spectacles looks like too serious a film to dig up - but this film is not about serious old Gregory Peck.  It is quite a simple story from the vantage of two motherless children who play around and are intrigued by an unknown fearful character in their neighbourhood reputed to be mad, and the events surrounding Gregory Peck, their father defending a black worker unjustly accused of raping a woman - during the 1930s when segregation was the norm in the south. <br /> <br />Gregory Peck comes across as a very dignified, handsome, moral character - who abounds in justice and strong paternal qualities.  The true star of the show is Gregory Peck's daughter and her tomboy antics along with her brother and their friend.  Peck's character is a admirable lawyer defending a case which in all probability he will lose.  But the unfairness meted to the black defendant though forming a core aspect to this film is not centre stage.  What is centre stage is the children and their vision of the proceedings and the danger they are placed in from those who hate Peck's advocacy of a black man's justice. <br /> <br />The music and overall atmosphere of the film describing quiet southern town life evokes a bygone age of innocence, friendliness and charm - along with the grosser aspects of intolerance at the time.  The music if very special. <br /> <br />This film got several oscars including best actor for Gregory Peck. <br /> <br />This DVD comes with one version of the film with a producer/director commentary and a 90 minute documentary about the whole project with critical exploration of what the film and book convey. <br /> <br />Truly an American classic and the best aspects of humanity from a south US heartland.
B0026P3G12|5|I love her voice!  I could lisen to her all day long
B0000048V8|5|This movie succeeds on several levels simultaneously: Musically, artistically, and expositionally.  The only drawback is the physical product itself: My VHS is wearing poorly and almost from the start has had tracking problems.  Others who have this movie have noted similar problems, so the videotape seems to be of poor quality.<br /><br />That said, the movie itself is wonderful.  Taken from the book of the same name, there is no talking in the movie.  Colored pencil images are the source of the animation.  They are understated, but beautiful.<br /><br />The music is excellent and the entire score is noteworthy and enchanting.<br /><br />Lastly the story is timeless and Christmas oriented.<br /><br />Overall, highly recommended for children from 1 to 99.  If you're looking for violent action or insipid humor, this is not the movie for you.

B009471JQE|5|I've been a ZZ fan for a long long time. I purchased Mescalero and La Futura together and they're well worth the purchase. With both albums, you can hear them dip back into their roots as well as some of the changes in style over the many years. Mescalero does a couple of covers where the bearded wonders put their own unique spin on them and truly own the songs. La Futura they get a little bit more experimental blending their own style with other influences. Both great albums!

B00C5R7F8G|3|This book sheds light on the shadowy world of nuclear detterence, and the people in the US that have maintained the network since WW II. It switches back and forth between the accident at Damascus Arkansas, and the evolution of the command and control system of the US Military.<br /><br />There is a lot of good material here, well researched and documented. One is awed by the fact that a nuclear weapon was never accidentally discharged, and at the same time bewildered by a bureacracy which minimized the threat of such an accident.<br /><br />The reason that I only gave 3 stars was the somewhat clumsy jumps from the Damascus accident, and the history of the command and control system.

0385503954|5|I would start my review with a summary of the book, but I believe other reviewers have more than covered for that.  What particularly captured me about McEwan's novel was that McEwan's own writing directly reflected that of the aspiring writer, Briony.  He described how she used odd, yet interesting adjectives to set up situations, and he does exactly this at times.  He is truly gifted at not only setting up extremely creative stories, but at completing the full embodiment of these stories at every level.
0385503954|5|I have not read such a good, magically absorbing novel in a long time! The plot is constructed beautifully, without a flaw. The first part, which is also the longest, describes only one day - and during this day the reader is given the detailed portraits of all the characters (practically enough to feel like any of them), the author builds the tension up to the climax (at the end of the first part), and very believably describes the surroundings and the time.<br /><br />That day in 1935, when there is a lingering shadow of the war, but at the same time its perspective is so remote that all the other aspects of normal life seem to go on normally. The Tallis family in the English countryside mansion prepares for dinner celebrating the visit of the son, Leon. The story in this part is told from the point of view of the youngest sister, thirteen-year old Briony, who has an overgrown imagination and wants to become a writer. To honor her brother, she prepared a play, but some events, invisible perhaps to the others (like jealousy for her two years older and feminine cousin, Lola), lead her to abandon the project of its staging. At the same time, we are witnesses to the love emerging between the older sister, Cecilia, and the son of the resident charlady, Robbie, both freshly back from college. The development of their awareness of the feelings to each other and mutual desire, only in this single day, is exceptionally caught. Briony's fragmentary observations of the couple and her extensive use of the imagination lead to the tragedy, which changes the lives of Robbie and Cecilia forever and lead Briony (very slowly though) into deeper and deeper feeling of guilt.<br /><br />McEwan pushes the reader gently to the right direction, without too much leading and showing the obvious, but it is easy, reading carefully, notice all that he wants to show, ever so subtly. The language is rich, but crystal clear, without any excessive ornamentation, nothing unnecessary, all the words have their use either in the plot, or in the construction of the mood. The next parts create a perfect counterbalance, everything calms down, gets from the complete chaos to the natural order, more static situation - the circumstances are, for a change, very dramatic (a middle of the war actions, a hospital).<br /><br />Already the story, the moral problem and its presentation, are a great start and enough for praise. But there is more, since there is a lot of metatext, comments about literature and the author's role (mostly put into Briony's mouth, but also in the editorial letter from \\"The Horizon\\"), and the ending makes a twist, when old Briony thinks about her story, considering different possible endings. This makes the reader realize that what they just passed through, is just fiction, the writer, its creator, is like God in the fictional world and we are at the end not any closer to the truth than we were at the beginning.<br /><br />I could praise McEwan into infinity here, so as the last sentence I will just say that another of his achievements as a writer is that each of his works is truly original and unique, there is no self-plagiarism in any sense, no repetitive themes, only the ease with which he uses English and his ingenuity remain the same. Five stars don't do him justice.words have their use either in the plot, or in the construction of the mood.

6305718954|2|This film had excellent acting, production, and direction...and a fairly compelling story that keeps you mentally engaged until the end credits.    But I chose to give this film two stars because of the unavoidable \\"facts\\" that get in the way of the tale. If you have never been to Sunday School and do not have any background in the Bible, etc., you will have no trouble enjoying this movie. However, I could not help but get distracted by some of the unequivocally real-world false statements made by some of the characters. Like Jesus of Nazareth was killed by a spear or that Jesus did not give any structure or ceremony to his disciples. Or that there are fifteen gospels. There are actually four gospels and generally the rest are Gnostic gospels, like the Gospel of Thomas mentioned at the end of the movie. These Gnostic gospels were rejected because they were not written by any apostles nor by anyone associated with the apostles, and they were clearly based on Gnosticism and not the teachings of Jesus.     If statements like these had been left out of \\"Stigmata,\\" I would have given this film five stars.

0451191153|5|Just finished reading The Fountainhead for the fifth time.  The first time was over a decade ago, and I read it every couple years when I'm feeling down or just generally need a &quot;pick-me-up.&quot;  Interestingly, the  book was much funnier this time.  Maybe because I was focused in other  areas in the past, but this time I caught a lot more humor and actually  laughed out loud a few times (&quot;The Gallant Gallstone,&quot; the manner  in which Roark talks to Toohey, etc.).  For anyone that hasn't read this  book, you owe yourself.  For those that have read it, read it again and  enjoy the subtle humor.
B00IU0M85C|5|Orphan Black is a show that asks interesting questions about the nature of humanity, self-determination, bioethics, and the increasing shadow of corporate governance. It is wonderfully scripted, beautifully shot and everything is held together by the brilliant performances of Tatiana Maslany. I enthusiastically recommend this show to anyone looking for quality television. Can't wait for season 2!

0316225932|4|I could never give any Harry Bosch novel fewer than 4 stars, because any Harry Bosch novel is better than 99% of the other mystery novels out there.  Having said that:<br /><br />I look for several things in a Harry Bosch novel:<br /><br />- a compelling mystery<br />- a satisfying villain<br />- a look inside Harry's psyche<br />- fully fleshed out secondary characters - partner, LAPD hierarchy, politicians, rich Angelenos, lovers, friends, family<br />- a satisfying wrapup of the case Harry is on, including preferably a confrontation with the villain<br /><br />In this novel, you really only get the compelling mystery.  Or mysteries, since there were two cases.  Every other aspect is lacking.  Or rather, lackluster.<br /><br />Connelly shines at showing us how Harry solves a case.  I just love following the breadcrumbs along with Harry.  And this book delivers that.<br /><br />But as for the rest, I get the impression Connelly is phoning it in.  And oddly, after about the same number of books, I had the same impression with John Lescroart and his Dismas Hardy series.  It's as if they got bored with their hero ... but their editor said &#34;you have to put in something about Harry's life&#34; so we get these MEANINGLESS walk-ons with the daughter.  I can't even remember her name to be honest.  She has as much personality as Flat Stanley.  We get similarly listless walkons (a page or two) with characters from his past, and a teaser about a potential love interest.  But on their one date?  We don't get to come along.  All we get is Harry thinking the next day that he's attracted to her.<br /><br />And the new partner?  She's not that fleshed out either.  I mean, that may be more realistic, given that she's young and motivated and all she wants to do is work cases, they're not personal friends (yet, if ever) so it's not like she and Harry are going to have long soulful conversations.  But still ... that felt a bit lacking as well.<br /><br />And then, we find out whodunnit in both cases, but let's just say we don't get real satisfaction.<br /><br />I can't go into more detail without spoilers.  But Mr. Connelly, we want SATISFACTION and we didn't get it here.

B00005JN2Z|1|In the end on this movie... <br />- The bad guy gets shot in the face/neck then hops back up to resume the chase and perform such feats as leaping onto a moving train <br />- A cop has the good guy at gunpoint on his knees after discovering a body in the trunk, but the good buy casually flips him over and handcuffs the cop to a car easy as pie <br />- The good guy is able to see the bad guy in pursuit of his lady friend in an office building from the top of a parking garage, like watching an ant farm. <br />- Never fear, the good guy is miraculously able to cover the distance between the parking garage and the top of the office building JUST IN TIME (maybe he flew over) <br />- The bad guy, who NEVER hesitates at any other opint in the movie before killing someone, who easily and with blinding speed offed two guys who had him at gunpoint earlier in the film, takes a nice big dramatic pause when he has the good guy's girlfriend in his sights <br />- The bad guy, who had no trouble shooting several armed guards in a crowded nightclub while jumping and spinning around, fires an entire clip at the good guy from less than five feet away, missing with every shot <br />-  The good guy does the same, emptying his clip at VERY close range, but, luckily, only hits the bad guy in one special magical spot that allows him to make a dippy little speech before dying <br />- The girl, who hasn't been in the movie more than five minutes total, and that right at the opning credits, gets saved and falls in love with the hero just as the movie ends <br /> <br />And there's more.  The ending of this movie is formulaic, predictable, chiched, pat, tired, cheesy, and melodramatic.  Did other good stuff happen before this terrible ending?  Yes.  Does it matter?  No.  This ending is so bad it completely ruins the entire movie.

B000002UEB|5|I remember when this album first came out in 1988, a former manager at a summer job of mine recommended it to me.  However, I was immersed in thrash metal at the time and didn't take notice of it until 20 years later.  A couple years ago I decided to pick-up a used copy of the original issue on Amazon for less than $1.  I've given it several listens and I must say that I was quite surprised at the overall quality and creativity of this album.  I will not go as far as other reviewers that say this is on par with 'The Wall' (it's not, in my opinion), but I will say that as a progressive rock/metal concept album, it's quite good.  Better late than never, but I should have listened to my boss 2 decades ago!    It far exceeds the other Queensryche albums that I also purchased for about $1 on Amazon ('Rage for Order' and 'Empire').  These other albums are good, but are not on par with 'Operation Mindcrime'.  Unlike 'Rage for Order' and 'Empire', which have a few standout songs interspersed with a bunch of mediocre and similar-sounding filler material, 'Operation Mindcrime' contains enough variety, sampling, and progressive experimentation to warrant listening to the whole thing, end to end, without getting bored.    Also, laying out the concept and picking 'Eyes of a Stranger' to close out the album was a great decision.  It's arguably the strongest song on the album, if not in the entire Queensryche catalog.  Excellent way to close out a unique album.

0385344228|4|A murder, a family torn apart,a son accused and all the complexities of an attorney father who will  face the trial of his lifetime.This is Defending Jacob, a novel by William Landay.The many twists and turns of this legal thriller are sure to hold the reader's attention. The nature/nurture issue as well as the theory of a murder gene add to the interest level of this novel but the heart of the book lies in the family dynamics and the heartbreaking unraveling that develops page by page.Reminiscent of the  5 star We Need To Talk About Kevin, Defending Jacob will be a very popular read.

B002SJIO4A|4|As \\"District 9\\" opens, we learn that a mysterious spaceship has been hovering over Johannesburg, South Africa since 1982.  After years of trying unsuccessfully to integrate the more than a million aliens who arrived on it into regular society, government officials have decided to move them out of the slum, known as District 9, where they now reside, to District 10, a camp located far away from the city (the creatures are derisively referred to as \\"Prawns,\\" due to their crustacean-like appearance).  Trouble begins when Wikus Van De Merwe, a field operator for the MNU (Multinational United), becomes exposed to a mysterious alien substance while in the process of evacuating the camp, a substance that causes him to slowly turn into a Prawn himself.  Immediately, the MNU wants to dissect him to better understand how to operate the aliens' weaponry (for some reason human DNA renders the weapons useless in human hands).  However, Wikus escapes and becomes a fugitive from justice, finally hooking up with an alien who may possibly be able to help him retrieve his full humanity.  (Though set in South Africa, the movie`s provenance is actually New Zealand).<br /><br />Shot partly in the style of a you-are-there documentary and partly as a conventional third-person narrative, this relatively low-budget ($30 million) thriller, written by Neil Blomkamp and Terri Tatchell and directed by Blomkamp, is high on creativity, raw energy and imagination and low on sci-fi movie cliches (the overused fugitive-on-the-run scenario being one of the few concessions it makes in that regard).  \\"District 9\\" also provides more food-for-thought than the average big-budget movie in this genre.  Like \\"Alien Nation,\\" it uses the arrival of outer space visitors to weave a thought-provoking parable about such relevant social issues as prejudice, governmental and corporatist secrecy and propaganda, black market exploitation of the masses, and xenophobia.  The script also deviates from the standard formula by making the aliens neither pointy-headed super-intellectuals light years ahead of us in knowledge, nor unthinking villains bent on colonization and destruction, nor namby-pamby sentimentalists reaching out a hand of friendship from across the cosmos.  They are just worker drones who happened to get stranded on a strange planet, whose generally compassionate inhabitants invited them to stay on - albeit clearly as second-class citizens, as it turns out.  The movie also captures some of the poignancy of the 1986 version of \\"The Fly,\\" as piece by piece, Wikus loses the one thing that defines what he is - his humanity.  Yet, ironically it is in becoming less human - in being able to more fully identify with an \\"other\\" to the point of extraordinary self-sacrifice - that he becomes most human (a theme not unlike the one in \\"Avatar,\\" actually).<br /><br />Even with all its impressive CGI effects and hardware, \\"District 9\\" would not be half the movie it is without the extraordinary performance of Sharlto Copley who, as Wikus, provides the human heartbeat the picture needs to be effective.  A somewhat bumbling, barely competent bureaucrat is not an obvious choice for an action movie hero, but Copley makes that very tricky transition seem utterly natural and seamless.  Wikus is a good-hearted man who's forced by circumstances to perform actions he wouldn't normally perform just to survive, yet he remains true to his moral code most of the way through.  It is he and he alone who lifts \\"District 9\\" to the level of compelling human drama.<br /><br />Excellent special effects, exciting action sequences, some subtle social satire (particularly in the early stretches) and moments of surprising tenderness all combine to make \\"District 9\\" a one-of-a-kind moviegoing experience.king the aliens neither pointy-headed super-intellectuals light years ahead of us in knowledge, nor unthinking villains bent on colonization and destruction, nor namby-pamby sentimentalists reaching out a hand of friendship from across the cosmos.

B0012GMV4O|5|I love Mountain, even though I know in my heart Leslie West is a one-trick pony; however, it's a great trick.  Telling America's youth about the joys of listening to Mountain, particularly \\"Climbing,\\" their best album, makes me feel like Charlie Brown extolling the virtues of Joe Shlabotnik, his favorite ball player.  Yes, he went to the minor leagues almost immediately, but he had some great moments, I'm sure.  Thus also with Mountain: for a short time they were reasonably hot and then they settled into decades of tiny venues and almost complete obscurity, with the loss of Felix Pappalardi thrown in.  I see them when they come to the mountains of western North Carolina (rarely) and I enjoy the shows.  They play the requisite songs, \\"Theme for an Imaginary Western,\\" \\"Mississippi Queen,\\" and the connoisseur in me longs for something rare that I have never heard them play live, such as \\"For Yasgur's Farm\\" or \\"Sitting on a Rainbow.\\"  Well, at least those songs can be heard on this wonderful CD, which exists in the Internet equivalent of a cut-out bin.  \\"Oh death in life, the days that are no more!\\"
B001OQCV6A|5|The sexy Robert Downy Jr plays the role of Sherlock Holmes in this fast paces, new but fun version of the most famous fictional detective. Guys you're in it for a treat and Ladies well you get to see Robert isn't that enough ? Well, if it wasn't you won't be disappointed either because this movie has a lot of 1) action scenes 2)great acting 3) good special effects that made me feel like I was in London.<br /><br />This movie has a plot too, which is something because usually action packed films have little to none plot whatsoever. I don't know about you guys but when I picked this movie up, I wasn't expecting something out of LOTR or an Oscar winning material film. I was expecting a movie that delivers \\"Pure Entertainment\\" just to have some fun watching it and this movie didn't fail me. I was actually expecting it to be worse because everyone was talking about how good it is and I'm always suspicious of Hyped movies they almost always turn out to be \\"overrated\\" but this film was not thankfully !<br /><br />The City of London is going through a series of unexplained, weird events that is causing mysterious deaths and other incidents too. The problem ? They can't blame it on the villain who was a supposed wizard because he is already dead. Then who is behind all these crimes ? Leave it to our favorite Smart, witty and sarcastic detective and his best friend Dr.Watson (Jude Law) to find out. However, Holmes must get kicked in the a$$, get into arguments with his best friend and confess old enemies before he solve the mystery.<br /><br />Like what other reviews has already stated, Robert Downy Jr brings a different Sherlock Holmes to life. He is still smart and able of doing his job but you won't see him wearing a glove, scrabbling in his notes or or wearing that 19th Century Glasses anytime soon. Instead you'll see him moving around and kicking some a$$ while still collecting evidence. This Sherlock Holmes is never boring and he has guts !<br /><br />The Good thing about this movie is that it is rated PG-13 which means that you can watch it with your teenage kids as a family.ted PG-13 which means that you can watch it with your teenage kids as a family.

0767903854|5|Here's what I know about this book:<br /><br />1.  If you are a Bill Bryson fan ([[ASIN:076790818X A Short History of Nearly Everything]], [[ASIN:0307279464 A Walk in the Woods]], [[ASIN:0061965324 Shakespeare]]), then you will not be disappointed with In A Sunburned Country.  His perspectives and witticisms are still there.<br /><br />2.  If you have been to, or plan to travel to Australia, then this volume will provide you with unique insights:  the culture, the landscape, and the history.<br /><br />3.  If you consider yourself a people-watcher, you should find Bryson's observations of interest.<br /><br />Here are a few tidbits:<br /><br />\\"I bought a morning newspaper and found my way into a cafe.  It always amazes me how seldom visitors bother with local papers.  Personally I can think of nothing more exciting - certainly nothing you could do in a public place with a cup of coffee - than to read newspapers from a part of the world you know almost nothing about\\" (p. 71).<br /><br />\\"The friendliness of Australians - all of it quite sincere and spontaneous, as far as I could ever tell - never ceases to amaze or gratify\\" (p. 77).<br /><br />\\"...[Y]ou will never understand Australian politics.  Part of the problem, of course, is that it is nearly impossible to track Australian politics from abroad because so little news of the country's affairs leak out into the wider world.  But even when you are there and dutifully trying to follow it, you find yourself mired in a density of argument, a complexity if fine points, a skein of tangled relationships and enmities, that thwarts understanding.

B00DR0PDNE|5|Very install to install. Great fun using it.
B00QRCYLYG|3|I am a big jetpack joyride fan. So I thought it was safe to try other Barry steakfry games. This one is fun don't get me wrong, but it's lacking something that jetpack joyride had. First I wish I didn't have to spend real money to try the ghost busters theme (My 5 year old is disappointed in this as well). Second, you don't win coins very fast. It has taken a VERY long time just to buy one different gun. Third, the main menu screen is very cluttered and confusing. Are there any other options to Barry? I dunno I can't find them. Overall it's a nice game, but it doesn't carry the longevity that jet pack joyride does for me.
B00GRVV29E|5|Absolutely amazing app.  It definitely relaxes you and the colors/motions are wonderful.  I would definitely recommend this app.  Job very well done.  :o)
B009DKCBM8|5|Neil comes out with a record that will stand the test of time! I'd say his best album since Beoken Arrow. If you're sick of where today's music going these days, then \\"Drift Back\\" with Neil and the boys today! Distortion-laden open-chord nirvana.
B001G5ZKZS|5|Yes, this concert DVD is really good. Its a good song selection and excellent performances. My only complaint is the camera work during the drum solo. During the drum solo, they have too much footage from the back of the arena.   When I buy a RUSH concert video, 95% of the reason I'm buying it is to see the drum solo (up close). Unfortunately whoever was selecting the camera angles decided to use too many distance shots. Kind of stupid.  They might as well have aimed the camera at the floor and filmed that instead. It would have been about as interesting.   Don't get me wrong, not all the camera angles are that bad. Just the ones from the back of the house.  All  in all, its a great concert and as another review said, the bonus features are pretty funny.
B0061S0A64|5|I wondered if the good reviews were just fake but no, this thing is amazing on my Kindle Fir. I play guitar and totally plan to use it in my recordings. wow!
B00422LESO|2|I loved the premise. The idea that there is a &#34;camp&#34; where adults can go and live as a lady or gentleman in Austen's England is lovely and fun. The book, unfortunately, is neither lovely or fun. The LL gets all existential and want's things to be real so she can't just sit back, relax, and have some fun. She is ashamed of her slight obsession with Colin Firth's Mr. Darcy and makes way to much of a big deal about watching P&P over and over again. Everything felt forced, like the author was trying to write a &#34;serious novel&#34; instead of a &#34;romantic comedy romp&#34;. I was very disappointed. I have never, ever, ever, said this before, but I hope the movie is better.
B002T9H2MO|2|I love Sam Rockwell, and I was sure that I'd love the movie based on the reviews and the trailer...     I didn't. This movie has an excellent idea, but though Sam Rockwell is a fantastic actor, he wasn't electrifying to watch. His performance was genuine and incredible, but boring. There would be periods when it would feel like the movie would pick up and take me somewhere exciting, but then it wouldn't deliver. I wasn't looking for Michael Bay 'splosions and Roland Emerich-level apocalypses, but this seemed more like a novel playing out on screen than a movie. A novel that didn't translate well to images.     Moon has a lot of potential. A really fantastic idea, an interesting group of actors, an interesting ending and a thoroughly developed lead character are all things that the movie has going for it. The movie just failed to deliver on all of its promise. It could have been so much more than it was... but it just wasn't.
1400079276|1|I spotted Murakami's books only recently, and was excited when it came onto our writing program's reading list. So I was pretty happy to be reading this book to begin with - which usually gets me all defensive about what I'm reading....<br /><br />But man! This book is utter nonsense. Magic realism? Hogwash.<br /><br />The writing has way too much exposition, and every character starts preaching philosophy on every second page. It's ridiculous. And the point of the whole story? Who knows? It's utter nonsense! The whole things is written to cater to American audiences (there's even a scene in which these so called Japanese people are going to dial 911)<br /><br />Complete waste of 12 dollars, and I won't be reading any more of Murakami's work again.
B00151G0CK|5|This album is a fantastic collection of the best of The Darkness.  If you enjoy any of their songs give this cd a try.
B005544TRQ|5|While a little far fetched at times the show has more twists and turns than any roller coaster I've been on and that's quite a few.  The characters are well cast and the writing is excellent.  I decided to give Suits a try after a friend of mine recommended it and power-watched the entire season in a few days.  Now I'm through the 2nd season and can't wait for the 3rd.
B00992CF6W|5|THIS GAME S THE BEST GAME I HAVE N MY KINDLE. I got it when I was in 2nd grade and ever since it has been my favorite game ever. I will never delete this app it's so awesome!!!!!! YOU NEED TO GET  MINECRAFT!!!!!!!!! B.E.S.T. G.A.M.E. E.V.E.R. #1 game on my kindle!!!!!!
B005TKC2P2|5|I wonder how Mr Murakami gets all these stories. This is the best one so far I have read of Murakami. The language is simple but then Murakami goes much deeper in terms of human psychic. His ability to comprehend the human mind and putting into words is just an art which maybe very few people posses.
B004NK3MMQ|5|came in super promptly, sounds wonderful. so glad that i nabbed it for as cheap as i did, totally totally worth it
B003P9VZ0W|5|These stickers look so cute on the wall. We placed all the princesses right above my daughter's headboard  and used some of the accent stickers around them. These stickers are an inexpensive but great way to decorate. My dugheter loves them and I love the way they add to her decor.
B00004R9A4|5|I loved this movie when I first saw it at a young age. So I sought it out when I was older and I still enjoy it just as much. It is a great adventure for all ages and the live action animation with the cartoons and people interaction is something rarely seen in many flicks now a days; it is a great effect.
B00B2V66VS|5|Temple Run 2 is a really fun game for me. The graphics are much better than the first, and it provides me hours of fun. This game definitely tests your reflexes with the speed of your runner getting faster as time goes on. Overall, great job on the game, and I would recommend this to anyone who liked the first Temple Run.
B002GYI9C4|5|Brandon has really upped my expectations for writers of the fantasy genre. I purchased this book for my kindle expecting to find another mediocre disappointment as is normal with the kindle store, but from the very first page till the end I found myself unable to put the book down. I guess I should be angry with Brandon as I doubt any other author could entertain me as well as he has. Don't think twice about purchasing this book, it's a piece of art.
B005544TRQ|5|I really like the story and the cast! I like how things develop throughout the season. I like how they get around the various issues they have.
B004Z2TUGE|1|I watched this movie because it co-starred Timothy Olyphant.  Also, I like sci-fi.  I hated this movie, but only because it sucked.  I'm not sure who the intended audience was, but odds are it wasn't me.
B00V4JJPKM|2|Before this version was released for Amazon viewing I purchased the original &#34;play&#34; version of it, and I have to say this remake was lacking in lessons and entertainment. While I am happy that less tragedy and sadness is enacted  (for younger Disney viewers) it wasn't nearly as entertaining as the original, nor were the intended messages conveyed due to important missing parts. Overall I think it was a choppy copy.
B00KW274SM|4|Not a big action filled film, but it did have a level of suspense. Though Liam Neeson's performance is good, Hollywood's cliche story of a grieving male hero, left bereft of his family and will, head in a bottle, life without purpose, holding on by a thread, gets tedious. We all like to see someone pull through against the odds, but once in a while it would be nice for the hero to have a family waiting for him at the backside of his crisis.
B00003CXSM|5|BOUGHT IT AND DIDN'T REALIZE THAT WE ALREADY HAD IT FROM A FEW YEARS AGO! CUTE SHOW AND FUN TO WATCH AGAIN.
B00NFQT7QY|5|Another great movie from the action hero genius.  I was surprised that I wasn't disappointed.
B00000J7J4|5|I've heard a friend's copy of this album a few times now, and I've checked out some of the guitar TAB available. As a reasonably experienced guitarist and musician, I thought I would be able to pick at least 1 or 2 of the  songs, but the guitar work on songs like &quot;Smooth&quot; - even though  it sounds quite simple - is outstanding. As with all Santana albums, it  gels together well. It is an 'album', not just a collection of songs thrown  together for the hell of it. TOP JOB!
030758836X|2|Terrible and unrealistic ending.  A waste of time.  It reads like a crummy article in Cosmopolitan magazine.  The characters are cartoonish.
B007IXWL2C|5|Absolutely love Christian! Read &#34;Grey&#34; next👏💞
B009HUB40Y|1|hate it
B002MW50KO|3|Bob attempts to get you in the holiday spirit with various Christmas songs.  Even though the preceeds go to charity, a few of his songs are painful, at best, to listen to; especially \\"Hark the Herald\\" and \\"Little Drummer Boy\\".   I think Bob should stick to his own genre and leave the holiday music alone.  (and maybe just donate your money to the charity of your choice)
B009NQKPUW|1|They should have stopped with Alien.  I kept waiting for the story to gel, nothing interesting or cohesive happened.  It is a waste of time.
B00FR88VTC|5|Love it! Perfect for all the expense reports I have to file when traveling for work.
B0000AQS0F|5|A great series.
006117758X|5|Not all will like this book. Not many will understand it or the man who wrote it. Others will be repulsed by it and still others will wonder why it was even published.<br /><br />But all who read it will read it quickly, for it is that kind of a novel--compelling, like a magnet drawing you in, you lose a sense of time as you devour the words, coming out the end wondering where you are and where the time has gone.<br />And--all who read it will never forget, for it is that kind of a novel too--the words hammer their message into the surface of your brain like metal stamps, embossing a permanent melancholy sentiment of lonlinees, hopelessness and despair one can never shake.<br /><br />Bukowski, like us all, was a product of his upbringing, his environment, the historical times and his physical and mental makeup--circumstances that trap us all in their web and dictate how we will feel and what becomes of us.<br />Bukowskis' unfortunate and tangled web turned him into a recluse--afraid and ashamed to emerge from his room as a child and even more so as an adult where he lived vociferously consuming cigarettes, alcohol and occasional human beings who tried to reach out to him for one reason or another. He lived in rat holes with pealing paint, dangling light bulbs, an old typewriter and little else--because thats how he felt most comfortable--and it helped to reenforce, to accentuate, the envionment and mood needed to write his dark stories.<br /><br />Bukowski didn't give a damn about anyone or anything---non-discriminatory, he hated everything equally.<br />He published his first story from a dark, dank basement room in 1944, the year I was born. Thirty years later, I'd grown up, attained a mind and a conscience and was involved in the anti-war movement in Los Angeles. Bukowski was still working out of a dark, dank basement--churning out a weekly column for the LA Free Press called \\"Notes of a Dirty Old Man\\". I didn't understand him then--dismissing him as just another profane and empty sensationalist.<br /><br />Twenty years on I was in the midst of a career--now working for the military-industrial complex--working for everything I despised on one hand while roiling against it on the other. Bukowski was still in that dark, dank basement hammering out his rants like a madman--and now I understood him! It took me nearly fifty years--but now I finally understood him--and now I was almost like him.<br /><br />Read \\"Ham and Rye\\" --understand how Bukowski got to where he was and why he stayed there--until the end--in 1994 --at the age of 74. That he he made it that long--suffered that long, before giving in-- was testament to<br />his degree of inner-rage, his defiance and resistance to all he despised.<br />Perhaps, if you live long enough you will one day get there too--to where he was--his entire life.<br /><br />DH Koester--\\"And There I Was\\"profane and empty sensationalist.<br /><br />Twenty years on I was in the midst of a career--now working for the military-industrial complex--working for everything I despised on one hand while roiling against it on the other.

B0060V1WJ6|4|A sweet, funny movie!  Steve Carell is amazing - I shouldn't be surprised anymore at what an excellent actor he is.  Whether funny or dramatic, he always turns in a stellar, totally believable performance.
0743497465|1|I am a fan of Dan Brown's unique mixture of adventure, history and suspense in DaVinci Code and Angels and Demons.  While the writing itself was generally workmanlike, his creative, action-driven plots certainly kept me interested and turning pages.<br /><br />No such luck here.  This reads like the worst science fiction/romance novel you have ever not finished.  The plot is ridiculous to anyone who knows the least bit about either science, our government, or Washington D.C.  The writing would make a good high school English teacher cringe.  Brown uses every cliche imaginable at least once.  His characters are largely one-dimensional caricatures - I really  couldn't care about any of them.  And the book is waaay too long.  It is the worst book I have read in several years - I only kept going out of a perverse sense of seeing how much worse it could get!<br /><br />I can only guess that this was his 'practice' or warm-up novel for his later successes.  From that perspective, it might be interesting to hard-core Brown fans simply to see how far he has come in mastering his craft.  But otherwise, please don't waste your time, which may be better spent re-reading The DaVinci Code.
B00DR0PDNE|5|We love it so much I am going to purchase another!  It is so nice to be able to have the ipad away from the TV and utilize the TV speakers.
B00846TTDG|2|I understand the selling point of this movie is that &#34;real&#34; Navy Seals portrayed the main characters.  That's also its biggest fault.  The acting here is so bad that it literally undermines the entire film.  Just think of what a talented cast of actors could have brought to this film, with the &#34;real&#34; Navy Seals acting simply as advisors, rather than actors.  Even the action scenes in this movie don't come off as effective as they should because you never really care about the characters.  Everyone is either all-American patriotic good guy or sinister bad guy.  I have no problem with the blatant propaganda aspect of the film.  Stallone certainly did it in some of his Rambo movies.  But come on, I've seen better acting from digital video game characters (think &#34;The Last of Us&#34;)
B008XG1X18|5|I love how I can take Pinterest on my Kindle Fire into the kitchen or sewing room with me, it makes using my pins so much easier!
B00AIUUXHC|5|Its like gta but your a shark
0316044695|2|Egocentric story of an elite team that plans and tries to execute a flawed battle plan. With so much back history and touting of the SEAL organization the actual operation is doomed to fail with faulty intelligence and hubris.
6305311463|5|This is, no pun intended, one heavenly movie.  I greatly enjoyed the action-packed plot, witty and original dialogue, convincing and moving love story, and the nuanced performances by every single cast member involved, even the extras in the background.  The bonus features on the Criterion edition are worth the price of 786,849 other lesser DVDs alone.  When God cast forth his omnipotent digital media-creating godwaves into the minds of its earthly \\"inventors\\", he had this DVD in mind.  Thy will be done.
B00787IR2Q|5|I remembered watching this movie as a little kid and thought how fun to see how my kids react to it. They loved it.
B000YAA68C|2|Sloth-like in pace, poorly editied, with many trite scenes.  I'm sure I'll get hammered for this review.  I don't mind a decent chic flic, but this one trudges along with many dull scenes and overall lack of imagination or humor.  Of course, after she receives just the right amount of letters from her dead husband, she gets her groove back. Ho-hum.
B00009P1O2|5|Exellent product, great seller
B008RJFRTK|5|This is a great map and now it has free navigation with the maps. I use this on my phone and my kindle to direct myself when I have no wifi or service. Excellent tool to have. Easy to download maps that are needed when they are needed. Maby maps to choose from as well. Cant wait to try it in Bermuda.
B00J8X2SUK|4|Great book
B0097EWK3A|5|gameplay is fantastic. the story was compelling and interesting. there always seemed to be something curiously engaging to do. easily one of my faves
B0052OSTOS|5|My grand daughter uses this at night, I turn on the 13 minutes session and it calms her right down and she is sleeping in minutes. She loves it, she asks for it right before bed time. I use it too, it is very calming.
0062409859|5|So I wanted to hate this book because I have such fond memories of To Kill a Mockingbird.  I have to be honest, however, and having just finished the book, I have to admit that I really enjoyed it.  I want to say it is not well-written, but there was an indescribable flow to the writing that made it easy to read and conveyed a certain tone to the reader.  I really enjoyed the development of Jean Louise Finch and even the fall of Atticus.  It really does no damage to TKAM and tells a compelling story in its own right.
B00QW8TYWO|5|This game is really fun! It's really hard to put down your phone after playing. I really recommend this app :)
B00992CF6W|5|The way the pocket edition works is fantastic highly recomened that you get it. It is close to the xbox.
B0063IH60K|5|A fun, simple game that is just easy to play, but addictive.<br />Very well done, and just the right price for everyone.
B004EF8AJA|5|Everything about this movie is excellent - the casting, the script, the look of the film, the musical score.  Truly a haunting adaptation of Elizabeth Gaskell's novel.  A must see.
0399230033|5|This has become my daughter's favorite book. She has us read it to her at least once a day, if not more often. It helps that my wife is a teacher, and so has a particular flourish for reading to small children. Just  be aware that if you don't embellish the story, then it will lose something.
B001IYCMNA|1|As a Cisco shareholder I was excited to purchase two of these for use in my house. Upon opening them and reading the manual I realized that the documentation was ambiguous and generally unhelpful in setup. The &#34;access key&#34; is nowhere to be found. I called Cisco Support only to learn that after I created a profile I needed to have a service contract in order to get support...on a $150 item?  I buy about $15M in networking gear for my business and have always been a loyal Cisco buyer. My experience with them on the prosumer front has left a very bad taste in my mouth. I may need to look elsewhere next time I'm buying professional equipment.
B008EQIEWS|4|Love Sam Worthington.  Plot is a little boring though.  Ir is almost like somebody wrote the plot in about an hour and they started filming it without making sure it actually made sense.
B000005RMJ|4|In 1997, Rick Davies, Mark Hart, John Helliwell and Bob Siebenberg re-formed  Supertramp to release \\"Some things never change\\"; their first album in almost ten years; and as the title say, things never change; Supertramp is Supertramp. The music is super tight, great Piano, Guitar, Saxophone and perfectly great singing.<br />If you are an old fan of Supertramp, this CD is a must own.<br />Their latest album \\"Slow motion\\" is also excellent.<br />If you are new to Supertramp start instead with \\"Crime of the Century\\" and \\"Breakfast in America\\"
B000SINT52|5|Michael Moore always good!
B0054JZC6E|3|some of the games are hard to play because you have to drag your finger to move the cursor but I am sure not all devices have the same sensitivity. also some of the games are boring but some you can really get into.
B008RA3X5E|5|I am not very articulate but I will attempt to give this app the glowing review it deserves. I am particularly taken with the appearance and that coupled with the many features make it easy for me to give it five stars.
B00K7C17QW|4|I really love this game, but as everyone else says it is very expensive to play out a whole case.  I would rather pay a fee upfront for the game and not have to purchase so much power, otherwise LOVE it.
B0002V7ODI|5|Ron Pearlman and Selma Blair, good stuff. The premise is not bad at all and the supporting cast is excellent. I find it pretty funny as well as a good action movie.
0670024783|5|I have not read this book. It came 2 days ago.<br />  Therefore I have nothing to say about thisbook.<br />  So what can i say?
B0052UZIFA|1|very fun game but its a memory hog or something cause it keeps crashing on my captivate requireing a soft reset.    UPDATE     still having the same issues even after a hrad reset and popcap gives no support USELESS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00005JNBQ|5|Picture your most awkward moments magnified.  Then take out the perspective you have on those moments-- you don't see how uncomfortable they are.  What can you do but love these characters?   <br /> <br />I never found their treatment to be condescending or pitiful.  Uncomfortable sometimes, but not as uncomfortable as, say, a lot of Michael Moore moments.  These characters have good hearts, and the film promotes an appreciation for that above appearances and social graces.   <br /> <br />Boring?  I couldn't take my eyes off it.  Sometimes because it was like a train wreck, sometimes because the teen plot moments caught me up.  With a 4 star average on over 500 reviews, it's worth a look.
B009YP9L7U|4|Very, Very hot & kept you interested in the book the entire time. Read this book in 1 day, could not put it down.....
B0089LOG02|5|I stayed up all night to read this book, which starts out so depressing and sad but thankfully gets better.  So interesting:  the juxtaposition go the two stories told. One is of gothic foster child Molly and her community service<br />Commitment in 2011, the other of 93 year old Violet and her story of being aboard the Orphan Train in the 20's.  Both overcome the same kind of horrible odds and make lives for themselves while bridging an unlikely friendship.<br />A wonderful, thought-provoking, heart-rending, uplifting story.  Loved his book!
B00QLVY7J2|4|Its fun, just want 2 play longer!
0156012197|5|If you're familiar with Martin Buber's \\"I-Thou\\" (where each person confirms others as having unique value) and his \\"I-It\\" (where each person knows and uses others but does not really see or value them for themselves) you'll find these concepts exemplified in the story of The Little Prince. This relation is made evident through Antoine de Saint-Exupéry's juxtaposition of seeing the world through the eyes of a child with seeing it as an adult.<br /> In the first few pages the narrator explains that as a child he drew a picture of a boa digesting an elephant. When he showed it to adults they could only see a hat--meaning that it's hard for adults to understand what children see and imagine because the adult's take things for granted and at face value. He keeps the drawing wishing of someday finding another who sees it as he does, but since the narrator is now an adult he too is losing touch with the uniqueness of the world around him. When he meets the Little Prince he shows him the picture, the Prince identifies it as a boa digesting an elephant, and they become friends.<br /> Eventually the narrator comes to the realization that because of his friendship with the Little Prince he can now see what's important in life. Through the Little Prince he again learns to see the world through the innocent eyes of a child. <br /> In a nutshell: the Little Prince helps him reinvent his individuality and rediscover his childhood innocence.<br /> This is a great book.
B005J0VPNC|4|Installed flawlessly on my V-Mobile Samsung Intercept. I was dismayed to see there is no App2SD support (hence the 4 stars). That limits this camera's worth, at least to me.<br /><br />Aside from that, it's really only got three effects I use. 1) Comic Boom. 2) Acquarello (watercolor in Italian), and 3) Bleaching.<br /><br />Another issue that I had was that it didn't allow you to open pictures that you had already taken with another app. I see that this has been resolved in this iteration. I will uninstall and re-install from here right away.
B00CWY76CC|2|I haven't played it before so I hope it is good. Because I not smart at all. 4 plus 4 =12345678910???<br />I might delete it I am not cut out for it.
B005LY4B0A|5|very addictive but oh so fun!!! much better than flinging birds! my kids love it too. great problem solving and critical thinking excercise
B004J4WKUQ|5|This book is like a gamer's version of Snow Crash. It is excellent and a must read for all gamers.
B0019X3ZZY|5|Call this film what you want, it is a masterpiece.  Although the film contains several scenes with repugnant and disturbing imagery, it has a profound message and theme underlying it all.  The problem with films of these nature is people tend to view them at mere face/entertainment value; yes, you are supposed to walk away from Salo disturbed, but you are also supposed to be thought-provoked.  I have seen countless people compare this film to others such as Cannibal Holocaust, I Spit on Your Grave, Saw, and Hostel, which strikes me as rather odd.  Unlike the latter four films, Salo and Cannibal Holocaust both use graphic imagery and violence to effectively get their points across and invoke sensationalism in the viewer.  Graphic violence can be effective in repulsing a viewer and satisfying a gorehound, but it can also be quite effective when used in the correct context.  With attention typically centering on the film's graphic nature, an overlooked aspect of the film is the beautiful way it is photographed.  Although this is an extremely powerful and effective film that I watch sporadically, it is an extremely difficult one to recommend.  If you do decide to view Salo, approach it with an open mind and delve underneath the graphic violence and dialogue to grasp what director Pasolini is trying to say.  If you are a gorehound or fan of extreme cinema drawn to this film just because of its notorious reputation and do not feel like analyzing metaphors and allegories, direct your attention elsewhere to mind-numbing and shallow gore flicks in the vein of Saw, Hostel, Guinea Pig series, and anything Lucio Fulci.  How many films made in the '70s can claim to be as powerful and relevant as when they were first made?  That should be a testament to the film's power.
B0009I7NNA|4|Those of you hoping for WTF II are obviously going to be  disappointed with this album. After the musical bliss that is WTF, I had very high expectations for this album.  Obviously, they could have stuck to what they were doing, and no one would complain, but, whether the disappearance of the screaming is due to M. Shadow's vocal surgery, Warner bros., or them wanting to go in a new direction, or a combination of all three, who knows, but at times I find myself sorely missing the screaming that added another level of vocal variety to the mix. Also I find myself missing the dark, atmospheric guitar riffs, that seemed to engul you into the music, replaced with blistering leads and solos more reminiscient of 80's heavy metal. Not to say this album isn't good, in fact, it is very good, just different and not what I was expecting. Nevertheless, they do succeed with their new sound, as I believe any band with thier talent could succeed at any style of music they want to play, especially with axemen like Zacky and Synyster. While it is refreshing to hear something different and creative,I would still like to see another WTF type album before all is said and done. I think they may lose some of the metalcore fans, labeling them as \\"sell-outs,\\" with this alubm, but i think they will gain more hard rock and metal fans then they will lose overall, and for the record, I think this album was in no way an attempt to \\"sell-out.\\" All in all, not A7X's best, but still better than 95% of what's out there.
B009TGWYGY|5|Very powerful film.
B0063IH60K|4|Lots of options for play, designs, draws, etc.  Very similar to you solitaire game on your computer.  A nice addition to your app game collection.
B009UX2YAC|5|This game is so fun, But I feel bad for my friend because he has a sensitive phone, so there's a lot of glitches. So you should really get this game.
B003ZSJ212|5|I love the extra features that this set has. Definitely recommend it to Star Wars fans who like to see how the movie wasade.
0307269752|4|My French cousin raved about the \\"Millenium\\" trilogy so I purchased The Girl With the Dragon Tatoo shortly after it's American publication.  I found it a bit slow-going at first but by the end, I did not want to wait one to two years more for the American translations of books 2 and 3.  I had become so entranced with Lisbeth Salander and wanted to know right away what was going to happen.  Since my French cousin was visiting that December, I asked her to bring me the French translations of books 2 and 3 and could not put them down. (It was a good workout of my French as well!)  I found the French translations easier to read and more engaging...I don't know if book one is just naturally slow-to-get-into or whether the translation had anything to do with it since I did not reread book 1 in French.<br /><br />Now it will be interesting to see the movie...although movies are rarely as good as the books for me.  Sorry we won't be getting any more of Mr Larsson's work!
B000009EAD|4|Iced Earth is a good metal band that believes in playing the power chord to its fullest.  This c.d has great lyrics with really talented musicians.  At times, it does sound the same,but for the most part it's a great c.d.   With comparisons to Iron Maiden, they have a lot to live up to, but I think  they all ready have their own status in the music world.
0552160962|5|The full review can be found here: http://basedonanovel.blogspot.com/2014/07/terry-hayes-i-am-pilgrim.html<br /><br />\\"I've always said it's hard not to admire good planning.\\"<br /><br />A woman is found murdered in a cheap hotel in Manhattan. It seems to be a perfect crime - no fingerprints have been left behind, there's no clue who the murderer-or the motive-could be, and there's no way to identify the victim. Too perfect to be just a crime for money or of passion. What's more - what catches the intelligence agent's eye is that it all seems too familiar...<br />Somewhere on the other side of the globe, an Arab man-the Saracen-is plotting to destroy America. Scrupulous and precise, he is planning to hit the American nation in the nastiest way. This has become his life mission and he's devoted to seeing it to its end.<br />The paths of both the murderer from the hotel room and the Saracen lead to Turkey and send the Pilgrim on his way.<br /><br />It was definitely a page turner. I couldn't put it down despite the late hour.<br />It got me hooked from the first page. It's a great combination of a spy thriller and a crime novel with brilliant characters and super engaging writing. Oh the writing! It's direct, clever, and so natural with all the interjections and exclamations. And let's not forget about all the cliffhangers we're given at the end of most of the chapters, which made me always promise to myself to read 'just one more' - such torture! But really, throughout the whole story I just felt as if I was sitting (on the edge of my seat) with the Pilgrim, sipping coffee, and listening to the story of his life.<br /><br />Terry Hayes managed to really polish the story with all the subplots and the characters, and create a massive piece of reading that has definitely earned the title of one of the best thrillers of recent years on my personal hit list.
B00280LYIC|5|This Book is one of the best books I have read in my lifetime. Hopefully you will want to read it too. If you like Greek mythology, you will definitely like this book. Please read it!!!!!
B003ZJ0ZX0|5|This is my first Bruno Mars and he has some great songs on this CD.  For some reason when I downloaded this to my I-tunes library, it didn't show under Bruno Mars but somewhere else in the library.  It took awhile for me to locate it in my extensive library.  I purchase the entire CDs so I can listen to them while driving and also add them to my library.<br /><br />I'm enjoying this one.
B008Y78M60|2|Chatty... and really didn't hold my attention.
B000IDK6XU|5|Classic with Robert Downey, Jr. It's always amazing to me that he did this role in a former state of presence than which he acts in now. Watch this movie again and again.  It's very, very good.
B001N3UO68|4|Great movie. Kurt Russell is strong in this role
B000FC1HBY|3|Great book!
B003G4W49C|5|I am mainly a movie goer instead of reading books.  I can honestly say I am under qualified to leave a review but to me, this book was amazing.  I decided to purchase and read Enders Game when I saw the preview in the Movie Theater.  I purchased the book on Monday and finished it on Thursday.  I could not put the book down as I actually felt I was right next to Ender during his experiences.  I am really excited to see the movie in November.<br />As an individual who normally does not read books, I already started on Book #2 and will continue to read the who series.
B00IRISI42|5|John Puller and his brother, Robert have the bad guys in hot pursuit throughout the page-turner. As a reader you never know what's going to happen next, but it never disappoints. David Baldacci is continuously a very talented author and I hope he never stops writing!
B000001BX0|5|LIKE THE COVE
B003JTHXOK|5|The book is well written with love and drama and a twist at the end.  Could not put the book down once I started reading it.
B00BESM14U|5|this movie was surprising good-well done for both young teens an adults who remember. Only issue is the ending-it's predictable.
B000ICL3KG|5|if you believe in global warming, ten you will love it
1573300403|5|this is our wedding favor for our Michael Jackson Wedding. Thank You so much for your very good service.
0670024783|1|The above says it all.  Oprah ruined a very good book. The book can stand alone without her ridiculous thoughts..
B005VT42BS|5|Works great and quite fexible and easy to use. Go for it, you don't need to be a tech! You can also backup your discovery and labels on your SD card and restore it whenever needed.
B00DR0PDNE|5|Did exactly what it says it will do. We watched several movies at Christmas and it was great!  Some of them did pause for buffering time but it didn't seem to take all that long.  Can't say I would blame that on the product.
B0085MNZ66|5|Don't know what the gripes are for' the back arrow / undo works fine on Xoom running Jelly Bean. You really don't need instructions, just because a line starts one color doesn't mean it ends the same color. Nice FAOTD
B007FEFLTO|5|I love this book. Please Ken F. let the 3. be as interesting as this one. I have been crying, laughing and most of all felt the feelings of the characters in the book. I don't like it when a good book is at the end. Most of all I repeat history classes in a very interesting way. i hope my children will read this book in a couple of years. Thank You
B00IUBXPEY|1|The quality of this movie was very poor. It jumped throughout the movie, there was a period of skips lasting for ten minutes. I can't believe I paid for this quality.  Well think hard before renting a movie again on kindle from amazon!
B00NOPQU2K|5|I liked this .. it was no great work of literature but it was a real page turner and i finished it in a day or so
B006GLLXXK|1|Undisguised pornagraphy
B000XUBFE2|5|An absolutely beautifully written, heart wrenching novel.  I loved it.
B00CL68BK2|4|Did not know if I would like it, but it turned out to be enjoyable.  Worth renting for a night.
B0098VXE50|4|I enjoyed the different sort of Snow White character as well as the Huntsman.  Not a super movie, but it was enjoyable!
B00646Z09K|5|love it
0545128285|5|Very interesting to read .  As a Harry Potter fan, I really liked the opportunity to actually read the stories mentioned in Deathly Hallows.  Ron made me really curious!!
B00005ASOI|2|DO NOT BE INFLUENCED BY THE HYPE!  Trust me.........<BR>The movie appears to have good direction, but where it was being directed I don't know.  The story line is not so bad, however the suspense is just NOT there.  I admit I jumped once (in the begining) but that was all.  I even fell asleep!!  AND when I woke up, I realized I didn't miss much.  To make matters worse, when the opportunity for suspense finally occurs, the movie ends abruptly (A MAJOR LETDOWN).  I would compare this movie with the late 70's tv flick \\"Satan's School for Girls\\".  So if you liked that, you will like this.  If you did, chances are Charlie Browns The Great Pumpkin gives you nightmares and only then can I understand the positive reviews for Suspiria.  I like horror, but this movie didn't have it.  It had a great score, great set design, even the filming was good, but in comparing to great classic horror films, such as Psycho, Halloween, The Excorcist, it is NOT near the classic the other reviewers lead you to believe.  Do I regret seeing it?  No.  Do I regret buying it?  Yeah.  If you HAVE to buy it, buy the VHS at [dollar amount]!!
B000RPTQ1C|5|Very good CD, new sound, different tone, but the same Coldplay we know and love!
0061730327|5|This book reminds me of \\"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance\\", in that there are technical descriptions interspersed with a compelling story.  The story is heartbreaking and takes the reader into the home of a rural Malawian family as they suffer through famine and not being able to send their children to school.  It's real and very recent.    If you're interested in the developing world and grassroots-style projects, this book is very worthwhile.
B007VUA7VO|5|At first I wasn't sure about this app but, I'm glad I decided to try it out. The best part is is.... it's free!
0792164903|4|Tim Burton has made a GREAT film that incorporates the greatest aspect of classic horror: creepiness, suspense and just the right amount of humor.<br />The production values are superb and have Burton's fingerprints all over them.  The performances are great, from Depp's whimsical but squeamish &quot;Constable&quot; Ichabod Crane to a supporting cast that is, simply put, to die for.<br />Where I fault the film (it would be a 3 1/2 for me) is the loss of Washington Irving's original vision.  Ichabod Crane is not the hero of the story.  He doesn't rid the town of the Headless Horseman.  Of course, this doesn't quite fit the bill for a Depp/Burton vehicle.  This would have made a fun sequel -- what happened after Ichabod disappeared.  As it is, it is a very shaky reworking that over-analyzes Crane's childhood and introduces too many plot and character changes to really make it recognizable.<br />Would that Burton had brought the original story to film with this much energy and whimsy and spookiness.  Alas, it was not meant to be, but it's still a good film overall.
B00JFKEQBK|4|Got this app free during a promotion and it is a lot of fun. The idea is to combine two like cards to make a higher number and then to keep combining higher numbers to make the highest number possible.  It is a good way to pass some time and when you complete one puzzle then you just have to try another and another and another and before you know it, a lot of time has passed.  Simple to play but hard to get those super high scores.
B00HUNP5F0|1|The first 2 of these movies were decent.  This one was just stupid.  Not sure why they even made another one.
