B004X973EA|5|Changed from HD synthetic oil in my '08 Ultra's transmission to Red Line. Shifts are much smoother. Highly recommend.
B000O8455O|5|worked as expected
B007SH6B4C|5|These are great quality and beautiful fabric!!!!
B000BYD4JY|5|Work great!
B00WXIZ7OQ|5|Just what I wanted
B00HIVHEBW|4|The kit is easy to install.  So far so good except there are new clicking noises that were not there before.  I will just get used to it.  The braking is great and no pulsation whatsoever
B000EOKQUG|5|Looks just like the OEM one I removed from my 2005 Highlander V6
B005C778RY|5|perfect fit on my 85 k5 looks great and well worth the price very sterdy shipped fast overall im pleased with my order thanks guys
B0101SLTC8|3|Very fun, but did not fit my 2015 Jeep Grand Cherokee. It was too big to fit around the starter button.
B003IS3HV0|5|I've never used leather cleaner before.<br />We got a set of nice couches used. There was a spot right in the center of them that was starting to look cracked. Someone told me to get a cleaner for them so I looked and saw this one. It did wonders. This was 2 months ago and they look like I just did them it says you only need to use it every 6 months. So far it's still looking good.<br /><br />It didn't come with a brush or anything g and when looking up how to use the cleaner it would have been easier if I had bought one.<br />So if you buy this but something to use it with. :)
B004J3A9A0|5|jets were perfect fit. quad runs great!!!!!
B005NLQAHS|5|I used this while driving to Florida. It was genuinely useful.
B000C9TZBY|5|Worked great.
B000WEMJVW|5|Almost makes the car new again... at least the trunk area. Fits well, looks great. Now we can buy the large bags of onion at Costco and the flaky mess easily cleans up. Not so minor spills are no problem either. Arrived on time and in perfect condition
B000NBKI7Q|5|Works great. Easy install.
B0006GF5SK|1|They don't work very good. The gray water treatment works better.
B000QGT1CG|5|right ones, easily installed. Good quality
B00IV7PT2S|5|Sounds great but complicated install. I sent feedback to seller that I couldn't get it to work and they called me 2 hrs later and walked me through it. The relay hook up had to be different
B002QSHIEU|5|Works great!
B001GG09QM|5|On my new MiniCoopet
B00J0ABS5M|5|This locking pin fits my 2014 Tundra. It's nice when the seller puts the correct dimensions in the add.
B00E5OUOCQ|5|Supposedly jumbo size.  When I place it in my front window and turn my vizor down, it falls.  Honda Fit.<br /><br />8/24/15:  I was contacted by the seller regarding my review.  They pointed out that their product comes in several sizes and that I should simply measure my windshield.  When I ordered the product originally - I just saw the description &#34;Jumbo&#34; and placed my order.  I learned a lot about their product speaking with one of their customer services representatives (Karla).  They were incredibly helpful, informative, and professional.  I modified my rating based on my experience working with this company.  Their product is great - but be sure to order the correct size.
B007V2DB6U|4|Fits the windshield of my Subaru Forester XT (2013) perfectly.  Offers better heat insulation compared to universal windshield covers but is also a lot bulkier which means I have to store it in the trunk after use.
B003RF8VEC|5|Purchased this pad to make my weekend ride on the Sportster more comfortable.  Couldn't have been happier that I bought the product!  My husband was pleasantly surprised that I didn't ask for a &#34;rump&#34; rest at all.
B00651C5SS|3|Looks cool, FM reception is seriously degraded.
B00ZSDVKIU|1|This is not s magnet its s sticker.
B002R4U72I|5|Think this is a perfect thing to put on any car that does a lot of stop and go driving.  It cuts 50% or so of your heat from exhaust, so doesn't it make sense to use it?
B000C59XHY|5|Great bushings,  put into aftermarket adjustable control arms.  The ones that came installed in the arms had dimpled sleeves to make it 10mm so there was a lot of slop. These are sleeved for true 10mm bolts.
B00JQ3ROAG|2|The decals came smaller than advertised and do not stick to any clean surface without an additional adhesive. The seller was great and refunded my money immediately.
B0053X4XRU|1|Have to readjust them after you come off of the highway
B00515QY6S|5|Great
B00AM1Z67O|5|Needed oil for an oil change and this fitted the bill.
B001BXTIM6|5|great deal
B008Y3ROKE|4|Terrific starter, fast delivery, thank you
B00DYN26Y8|5|great
B00JXU8QT0|1|WAY OVER PRICED FOR TWO BRACKETS.
B0010G0K1M|4|Amazon great for car parts...always buy oem. Aftermarket industry has become crap
B00HYO0I16|5|Very strong design makes it easy to put this sticker anywhere and not have to worry about it peeling off in the rain or getting damaged. Overall very happy.
B002X1PNRY|1|This handle did not fit well and made the plastic cover protrude. Eventually it would not open the door. I replaced it with the Toyota OEM handle which has performed flawlessly.
B00HLUJXUU|1|Radiator does not come with brackets needed install.
B003SYCAYE|5|great
B00EO0RN5M|5|w0rks beaitifully..thanks.
B000C9C2O6|5|awesome
B004Q0CLBQ|4|Great price. Quick free shipping, and they are heavy. It's a D Ring so I can't say I love it.
B00NFOAP3K|5|excellent!
B00AQI5NOE|1|Product is not matching descriptions and do not fits.
B006VB8JTQ|2|I tried it twice and nothing worked. I will stick to toothpaste and baking soda.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Wasn't that much.<br /><br />Cons.<br />Headlights were the same.<br />Waste of money.
B00KTIC2ZE|5|I can find my keys, now  lol. Love em  :-)
B00IRBPCF2|5|5 stars.
B004JV6OMO|5|Indispensable for keeping batteries properly maintained
B00D9C2CDO|5|Bought this because of the decent reviews and didn't want to spend a lot of money. Took it on a 3200 mile round trip vacation which included a thunder storm. The carrier held up great! Our luggage and its contents were in the same shape they started in.
B0015ASMHC|5|Works great on my 04 f-150!
B00BYGM6QA|4|these look good, are easy to install, and my passengers love them over the stock bags. Only issue is they are not tight enough with the Spring band installed to keep from flopping down if you ride over any type of rough road.  Still recommend these though!
B000CN4ZQK|5|Great Deal, no issues..
B004D5MQOG|1|I run the Mobile 1 extended performance oil, and Autozone was running a special where if you bought 5 quarts you got a free filter. I've owned this truck for 7 years, and have always used a Fram TG filter, but I bit and picked up the free Mobile 1 filter. Since my last oil change, this filter has worked loose twice, resulting in a small leak and lost oil. Both times I've rolled under and was able to turn the filter a good 1/8 to 3/16 of a turn. I don't know if it's the rubber seal collapsing or a problem with expansion / contraction. I still have about 1500 miles until my next change, but I'm doing it now to get this filter off.
B008F8Q8K0|5|Lights fit and works well
B004RCSZNQ|5|Fit right in!
B000NW6XC4|5|Engine light finally gone
B00KI3MN5Y|4|good fit,quick shipping.
B00BTSHSLQ|5|Works as advertised. I bought this head set so I could talk to my wife and coach her as she is just learning to ride a motorcycle. I also enjoy listening to the radio when I ride solo, this saves me from fussing with earbuds. I have not tried the Bluetooth functions yet but I didn't really buy it for that function. Overall a great product so far.  I would recommend to anyone who rides a motorcycle.
B000E4SSAG|5|Fit the description
B0000AYCDH|5|Awesome chains.  They do exactly what I need them to do and they are not to long or two short for my application.  Also have had them on for two months now and no signs of wear or rusting on them.  They are on my saltwater boat trailer so that is pretty impressive.
B008P0LEPW|5|I loved this plastic bumper for my 2012 Nissan Rogue. Had to get it after I noticed my dogs were scratching up my rear bumper every time I took them to the park.<br />The product itself is like a hard plastic. Fits just about all the bumper (doesn't cover about 4&#34; on the ends but still good enough).<br />Installing was super easy; clean car, take off the tape and place on car.<br />I've had it for 2 months; went through rain, car washes & dogs - still on there good!
B005QZLQ52|3|Good
B00B3VAPRI|1|waste of money
B009FUFCDQ|5|Great rags.  They work straight out of the bag without need to run them through the dryer to remove lint.
B00EP3PUV2|5|Very easy to install. They look great! A slight bit of rippling in the chrome area from factory but not enough to justify sending back. I love them.
B00DPN5C8E|5|My acura looks good and sporty like it'
B00KDOI5YQ|5|Their are amazing my bike looks completely different I recommend this product. ...
B000O80AZS|5|Love these things.  The only thing I wish would be different is for them to be painted blaze orange so I could find them a little easier.  Minor nitpick though.
B00O0OPBNI|5|Worked perfectly
B00K1C1WC2|5|Work great. Came just as advertised
B009DK2M9K|5|Great product at a great price.
B004ULC7X8|5|Nicer than the originals! Upgrade your car
B00684TAYY|5|clean without any scratches - use it everyday
B00139YMUQ|5|Works very well.
B0028JQZ5U|5|Great product.
B0141QK0WG|5|These are the BEST Towels for QUICK drying!!!!LOVE THIS!
B007GR597Y|5|Super easy install. Definitely quiets it down a bit and gets rid of some of the popping and back fire. Seems to add a little back pressure back and smooths it out a bit. I had it on my 250 ninja.
B002Y0IMWC|5|These pads are fantastic!!  I installed them with a new set of vented/slotted rotors, and the stopping power is awesome!  I've run them at Palmer Motorsports Park, Lime Rock, & Watkins Glen....some VERY challenging tracks for brake systems.<br /><br />I am absolutely 150% happy with their braking response!!!  They have an incredible bite to them, which is just what you want on the track. They're quieter than I thought (after the break-in period), and not as dusty as I expected.  They're also great for general daily driving.  I stepped up to these from the EBC Redstuff series, and those pads were extremely quiet & dust free as well.  I'm just a fan of EBC in general.  Their products have ALWAYS delivered...very pleased. Another helpful hint...do yourself a favor when you do this job...flush your system and replace the old fluid with MOTUL RBF 600.  It DOES make a difference!
B00QB03B7W|5|Easy to install. Didn't have to drop the muffler. Took two women 30 minutes.
B000F15DNS|5|thanks
B0022ZXO40|5|Holds my full face perfectly
B0041U61HG|5|as expected
B004809YBE|5|Purchased for use in our 5th wheel, this is a heavy duty cord.  Nice carrying handle strap to keep it coiled nicely when not in use.  Great addition and a necessity for our camping needs.
B00168BJ82|4|Meets expectations, clear and wide very useful.
B00VXYQWPO|5|Great product! Super sticky! Make sure you line up where you want to stick and watch some videos online to do it with ease! Does peel off with some effort if you ever need to remove it. Great buy thanks!
B00IACGFOA|5|It does exactly what it's supposed to do.
B0009IQZJS|5|Perfect
B00S75GTE6|3|I will love it if it was waterproof
B001CUNFGI|4|12 oz and no sealer/oil but perfect for an ultra slow leak to boost 10psi to get you thru the summer.  Any more and you'll have to repair the system.
B00CBTRMZ4|5|Takes awhile longer than the higher amp models but does the job. maintains batteries well and never have to unplug
B00I5HRJ9U|5|I use this sling for lifting transmissions and other auto parts.  It works great and appears to be extremely durable.  One thing to note is that it's pretty rigid.  Trying to get it to fit into a small(ish) d-ring is a bit of a challenge because it's so rigid.  But it's got 20k lb webbing so that's exactly what I would expect!
B001HXZT14|5|A few years ago, I couldn't find the fob for my Camry. We finally discovered it between my seat and<br />the arm rest!  A friend of mine ( a retired combat jet pilot) bought one of these for me.  Now it is<br />impossible to lose my fob, is easy to get out of my pocket, is easy to identify when I go to a parking lot.<br />At first glance it seems bulky and not practical but you get use to it quickly.  Mine is a little bigger than<br />the Rotary13B1, but I purchased these 1: for gifts, 2:the price was cheap and 3: I never want to be<br />without one.  I would think these would be good for the ladies to help find their keys in a bulky purse.
B00XZ9OMAC|4|for others
B00IT8NNCM|1|Blurs the view of the road.
B000KMRFFG|1|It's too bulk to fit between tailgate and bumper. It's not for ford duelles
B00D42AFS8|1|don't waste your money on this product. use one time work great! now it won't charge.
B000IG20RM|5|great gun oil
B00KKYG230|5|Gag gift perfect
B001S7ZT5A|5|Easy to use and cleans really well. AAAAA+++++
B000HJDELQ|5|Nice quality that does not fall apart. As good as others that are way more expensive. Happy with purchase!
B001CJHU9W|4|It's convenient to use. A device like this is must have for a car owner to maintain tire pressures to the right amount. There is slight difference in reading from this device and my car's dashboard. I don't know which one is exact. It's ok as long as the difference is just 1 to 2 psi.<br /><br />It's useful when winter ends and the tire pressures rise. When the snow starts melting, I use this device to take out air from tires and maintain right pressure.
B00A6AS6LY|4|Product as described
B00M1OUBES|5|Absolutely amazing.  I never would have believed such a small light weight device could crank over my boat when I was dead on the water.  Using a lot of electronics, running live well and bilge pumps all day, and not running the motor to put some charge back in my battery I have drained it a few times to the point it won't start the engine.  A friend recommended the Genius Boost.  I used it for the first time this past Sunday during a tournament.  Had fish in my live well all day and fished the same spot all day.  Motor wouldn't crank.  I crossed my fingers and connected the GB30.  I was amazed how easy it was and it cranked the motor right up.  I made it to the weigh in on time and took 2nd place in the tournament.  I'll never fish without it again.
B0089LZRK0|5|Fit like I thought it would!
B00MWY0YYY|5|yes good
B00LH3IOBG|4|Fits great!
B00MAV0VDI|5|Great racing glove and fast service!
B00EO07JJW|2|Finish scratched extremely easily.
B00YJG5ZII|5|For less than $200 my A/C in my 2005 Ford Freestyle is working again, like a champ!
B001QGFWNM|5|Perfect fit
B006E4SKQ2|3|Not bad it did cover up the armrest
B003GXMJG6|5|I use it every day
B000A09M6I|5|I'm guessing that this would have been a really good air filter for my 2007 Cadillac CTS, but my Daughter totaled the car before I could install it...meh!
B000HBM5TQ|5|&#34;Surface Insensitive&#34; means that the threads do not have to be perfectly free of oil, etc.  All thread locker should be surface insensitive!
B007QW5Y2Y|1|Where is the &#34;s&#34;? It's an M1A1 Abrams!
B000NW4OPC|5|LOOKS AND FITS JUST LIKE THE ORIGINAL.
B006X98A7C|3|Didn't work, was dead and wouldn't charge.  They refunded my money.
B00G0P0I60|5|Fit perfectly.
B000AM8BJU|5|I used this on two cars after washing them and it works fine.  It's easy on, but you need a little bit of elbow<br />grease to get it off.  It's quicker and easier than using NuFinish liquid.  It beads very well after a rain and it has lasted several weeks.<br />I like using this during the hot and humid summers, then using the NuFinish when it's cooler.
B006N9HGP4|1|Made in China.
B00NQ8FD1Y|5|Awesome product fast shipping!!!
B00JBH0TIQ|5|fits, no problems
B009LQ8A74|5|I received my two lift supports today, for my 2010 Prius. I followed directions on the video and changed one of the two lift supports while a friend held the rear hatch. The new lift support plus the original support was the perfect force. The hatch now lifts easily and lowers easily. The weight of the hatch is nicely balanced by the combination of the new lift support plus the original support. If I had installed the second lift support, the hatch would have opened on its own, but would have been somewhat difficult to close. The Stabilus lift supports have an appearance of quality.
B000C9JU6O|5|Great seller and product
B000C9ULHG|5|I try to use a Wix filter whenever I can.  This 51515 fits both the L20B in my Datsun and the 302 Windsor in my Ford.  Wix makes the best filter you can buy, they've been doing so for years.  Get a Wix or go home.
B002AUE0MC|5|All fit very well and I like them very much. Fit nice and snug and have strings that tie up very well in my way of wearing them. Personallly I struggle and will not wear the Confederate one. I recognize both sides have deep feelings and I just do not want to get political in this one, which I guess I just did.
B00L7E80IW|5|Am so glad you sell these. Regular tissue just doesn't do it
B002VH6S7Y|5|Great Item - Fast Shipping - Will Purchase Again
B007KBKYQC|2|Wolfman. usually makes goodd stuff, this bag is a little on the cheap side.  I would recommend getting the next size up as my buddy has one, it cariries alot more stuff and the quality is far superior, however it is also twice the size.  AS the old adage goes, you get what you pay for
B00GR2VYZA|5|it looks great on wheel cover
B00P2D3VZG|5|Got these to replace the stock light bulbs that illuminate my license plate of my 2002 F150 Supercrew.  They are very bright and look great.  If/when they burn out, I will definitely buy more.
B00L84EKI0|5|Changed oil yesterday on our 2012 Toyota Rav 4 (6 cylinder) and this tool worked well.  You don't have to take off the small drain plug first if you don't mind a little oil getting on this tool.  You have to be very careful where you put the o-ring on the filter housing that this removes, look carefully when you take the old one out to see where it goes.  Also look closely after it is installed,  I did not do that and the o-ring somehow came out of its space and was sticking out.  The 2012 Toyota Rav4 6 cylinder engine holds 6.4 quarts of oil.  After I put oil into engine I went inside to eat dinner,  when I came back in to the garage an hour later I had the pleasure of wiping up 6.4 quarts of oil off my garage floor.  My oil change that usually takes an hour took 6 hours, when you add in the time to wipe up the oil and clean the garage floor.
B000C976CO|5|good product
B00684TAYY|5|Nice
B008E7PP38|5|works
B005UPTCQI|5|Loved it. I bought it to go on my white car. I want the world to know I Believe!!!!
B0049HRJWW|5|Oem product works great with 06 cobalt
B0031OXHAM|5|When the spigot breaks on your RV, these are wonderful. Not expensive, works great.
B002HXXNUW|5|Had it installed in 20 minutes, and it looks great on my 2006 Toyota Highlander.
B000GAS420|5|I got my dads old wet/dry vacuum and it had a very basic hose and that was it. Ordered these and they fit and work great. The two extensions save my back and the wider attachment makes garage cleanups a breeze.
B00027H32Y|5|perfect
B00C0XCHKG|5|Fit my 1999 Jeep Cherokee XJ perfectly.
B000CO7XHM|5|As described and super fast shipping.
B008B865A2|5|Great addition to my trike.
B00IO9CGTC|5|Pads and rotors are a nice look on my 2002 ml500 really sharp looking thanks will buy again when I need then and supper fast shipping even with reg shipping
B0007TQWM4|1|&#34;Not recommended for use on polyethylene or polypropylene tanks&#34; -- well that is most plastic tanks it seems. If you look in catalogs, RV water tanks are mostly polyethylene. It does sound like it works for some people, but be aware.<br /><br />I am returning it and getting Versachem &#34;90214 Plastic Tank and Radiator Repair Kit - 30 Grams&#34;. Catalog says that Versachem repairs &#34;ABS, polyethylene, and plastic.&#34;<br /><br />After further research, I believe the only thing that will stick to &#34;poly&#34; anything is TAP Poly-Weld.
B0002JN3FS|5|Well made. Good price. Fit perfectly on two year old Mazda CX-5 which needs a 24&#34;, an 18&#34; and a 14&#34; replacement blade. Easy to install. Good investment for your vision, safety, and to work properly when there is rough weather.
B008ET00ZO|5|A must for replacing antifreeze in a Mercedes vehicle.
B001JDE6ZW|3|Mirror are great. Didn't come with mounting hardware. Had to go get my own
B0085IDD0S|1|The picture and description of the item on Amazon does not represent what you will receive. The item does not have the two extended ears that make it easier to remove. That's the only reason I bought it in the first place. Also, it is not branded as stated.
B00Y5FFRG8|5|Easy to install and the perfect accessory for the end times!
B007I6RDW2|5|Great product ! Great seller !!! I'll definitely buy again !! Thanks a lot
B005CNNLRY|5|These are awesome floor liners.  I just bought a 2014 Focus ST for a new work/commuter car.  Well I am in commercial concrete construction in Seattle WA.  So its wet and dirty.  These mats cover all the carpet you foot would come in contact with...even the dead pedal area!  I bought the weather techs first (cause I have known them to be the best) and these are way better.  The cargo liner also takes into effect having a full size spare.  If you have a Focus ST buy these and save yourself the frustration I went through.
B0017OCROA|5|My 1996 Fatboy with her custom paint,18&#34; chubby apes, old school back rest, attached to a slim luggage rack, it was going to be difficult to find a perfect cover and fit. After years of looking at all the high priced covers, from H.D., to aftermarkets, I finally found this cover on Amazon. Taking a chance without going broke was the biggest problem, but because of the great price I took a chance on the street-glide cover, which worked out perfect. I've got alittle extra on the sides because of no saddle bags, but who cares, the cover is complete from frnt fender to the rear. I am really sold on Amazon because of the great prices I had to chose from. The cover is complete, its soft on the inside to protect my paint from winds that other covers would sand the paint right off. The outside protects from the rain, and repells water instead of soaking it up and becoming heavy. Thanks for everything.KC from Calif.....
B00BITISWY|5|Fits like a glove!
B004I10FMK|5|This is quite possibly the best aftermarket headlight assembly I have ever used.  Make sure you take off the plastic end where it clips into the vehicle body.  It WILL not fit until you do.  Believe me I know...lol
B0002NILS8|4|I love this Betty Boop Seat cover. It fits however very loosly and does not have holes in it for a separate head rest. It is not a tight for for my 2001 Rav4, but it's cute.
B009LN62XG|5|It came fast & fit perfectly. I got a life time warranty on it too. Great buy
B006PI0KK6|5|👍👍
B001HJR9XE|5|Did not end up needing it the horn I bought already had a switch
B00M9N1UQY|2|Almost immediately after I started using it, the clear coat just started oozing (not seeping like it should), and created a huge mess for me. Paint matches though, but I doubt I can ever use it again; the clear coat side is all gooped up.
B00BO3UH6E|5|Expensive floor mats! Perfect fit. A well made product. Would recommend to others.
B001KQD7NU|4|fit well no rivets not a complete kit
B00EOWYWGI|5|Simple installation, and wonderful new sound from this engine. I'm head over heals in love with the sound of the 3.6 flat 6 engine. I'm thrilled I didn't have to buy a Porsche to get such a wonderful noise.<br />Packaging was first rate, my intake had 3 different stickers from 3 different inspectors on the box. The individual baggies also each had a sticker and initials and number of the person checking to make sure all the parts were there.<br />The instructions were spot on and perfect. The pictures were accurate for the modern 3.6R engine, year 2011 and up in the Legacy I believe. The 3.6 in the Outback of similar years is also the same.<br />Came with a license plate frame and a sheet of cool stickers and decals too.
B00280974A|1|Running these on an 08 Tundra. After just 3000 miles they've started to judder and shudder. Following proper bed in procedure and all, these things still turn out to be expensive paper weights.
B000COTCI0|5|Installed 2 on my bmw e38 with 4.4 v8 and it sounds amazing. Definitely worth the money
B010DP8PIU|5|One of the best portable gadgets/tools I've ever purchased.<br />Had it less than a week when I accidentally left the dome light on in the car overnight and drained the car battery.<br />Anker Compact Car Jump Starter to the rescue.<br />It worked!  I still can't believe it but it really worked.<br />Was able to jump my own car battery.<br />Only complaint was that small type makes the printed instructions nearly impossible to read.<br />Had to scan the instructions to PDF and enlarge them on screen.<br />Do yourself a favor and read the instructions and/or watch an available video before you really need to use the device.
B000CKGAV6|5|Excelent Product ! AAA+++
B00029KA8G|5|Took me about 2 hours to install in my Land Cruiser, but worth the time spent. Can't beat the price vs. quality. Even if this only lasts a year I'll consider it money well spent
B00A3UNYW8|4|Works like a charm
B00BP5ZF2W|1|Horrible product
B002X6VXL4|5|This an awesome product. A must have in your car.  It survived the whole winter without charging once and I had to at least reboot my car once a week.
B0067UMT4C|5|Worked fine for me
B004LEJ606|5|Fast shipping. Looks great on my truck. Highly recommend this!!
B000KU74MM|5|Lave Bun held up well during the football season, I play in an adult football league at nights and this item made the cold nights in February comfortable. I actually purchased two items and used them as hand warmers. Problem was once my teammates figured out what I had I couldn't keep there hands out of it:) My two bags have held up well and have had plenty of use. My kids love them as well, almost daily use in the mornings for my kids during the cold months...I plan on buying more in the future...
B0041WOEYG|5|Installed in less than 10 minutes (read most helpful review for installation instructions)....blower runs like new now!  Great product!  Thank you!
B001G63LMQ|5|works great thx
B00PYCXGQY|5|I have bought 2 other manufactures cutting/buffing pads and, nothing compares to Mcguiar's 6&#34; or their 3&#34; Pads.<br />I had purchased:  Harbor Freight and Tool 6&#34; pads-Garbage and ZFE (ZFE via Amazon).  Harbor Freight Pads are a joke.  ZFE are a value for the price.  But, heat transfer causes them to break down in the mid area.  Mcguire's 6&#34; AND 3&#34; Pads are GREAT.  Made in the U.S.A., 2 pieces per package and they last, last  and last! I have also used their Yellow colored Pad.  Try their &#34;Microfiber&#34; 6 and 3&#34;- longest lasting, made in U.S.A., Cut or buff like CRAZY!
B00O3QHM9O|5|Very nice decal!
B00HW58R92|5|Great, good quality tools
B00JPKIML0|1|Well built product and easy to install. Wouldn't buy anything from the vendor that supplied this product to me. Package was delivered in perfect shape by truckline and three days later I opened to install it and the whole drivers side was scratched BAD. Vendor would do nothing about it because truckline insurance wouldn't cover it. This product was packaged after the damage occurred and delivered to me that way, leaving me stuck.
B0038EOS9Y|5|Great product, perfect size for placement on rear window of pickup trucks.
B004GCZR56|1|Reliever driver made me walk 1 mile to get him great truck driver
B00429Y8ZI|3|A pretty good car ashtray. My only complaint is that the solar powered LED stops working after a while and you can no longer see the ashtray at night. Other than that, completely functional. Haven't ashed out the window/littered a cig butt in a long time.
B000B8N3MI|5|The car loved it!
B00RK7EZ4S|2|The tightening part kept coming undone so I would loose he whole keychain part
B00PV6U1N4|5|Looks great in my truck. LOVE IT!!!
B00852684M|5|My stepson uses his bike to get home from class late at night, and we often worry about his safety on the road after dark. Now that he's equipped his bike with these tire valve cap lights I know everyone can see him even at night!<br /><br />We live near a busy road and bikers without some sort of light are nearly invisible. Abco Tech's lights are surprisingly bright and light up only when the bike is in motion! Each color is vivid and really stands out against the darkness. These caps are easy to isntall and fit right over the existing air valve on the tires. Once these lights are installed they stay on tight, even after hours of riding!<br /><br />Abco Tech has made a great safety light that looks awesome! I was provided with a sample of these lights but price doesn't change how easy they are to install, nor does it effect my review.
B004NFTOLY|5|Works better than stock one
B00XZ9PFI0|5|Had local locksmith cut my new blank to match my existing keys. Then, following the enclosed directions, it took less than 2 minutes to program the new key to my ford f-150. FAR cheaper than dealer or locksmith.
B006P28UJU|5|pretty damn yellow and nice and bright.
B00JBIBWKY|5|They look amazing and was pretty simple to install fiance loves them makes his car look mean 😀
B001XUD46S|3|I really like Ventshades on my vehicles but for some reason the passenger side one has a bend in the front tab and the window hits it so the window will not roll up (power).  I have sent the MFG an email and am awaiting a response but so far nothing.  The other window vents are great.
B00OUM8GLY|4|Car doesn't stay as cool as I thought it would with the Skorch shade. Took awhile to get the hang of folding, but finally got it.
B00HE0K9LO|4|Does the job.
B00PSRORH2|4|I like the shade, but the item should include some type of instructions or diagram for someone that may not know how to use it.
B000C9N4SE|5|awesome
B003NOD4VW|1|No keys included.  Not a very useful lock without keys.  I would not see to point or be very happy if this lock could be open by any key.  I am trying a replacement and will update when I receive.
B00GHT8NM0|5|easy to install in a few minutes, eliminates dealer ripoff for whole console lid.
B00VKNU1PU|5|Perfect fit to replace original trailer lock
B006TMLUSY|5|It' ok
B00DBERESI|1|Definitely not bright at all , better off with stock bulbs
B002MEHJGK|5|Perfect fit.
B000760FWU|4|Good jack stands to use to stabilize a camper.
B0009NETWS|5|I love them they fit so nicely in my suburban!! They are the best!!
B00DJINW7I|3|Sloppy fit and light weight construction. The adjustment is rather poorly designed too but it gets the job done.
B00MP146E8|5|great gloves they have been holding up very nicely! Kinda feels like Michael Jackson the first time you throw em on
B00FG8MYYG|5|Works perfect.  Buy this instead of the mishimoto. It's literally half the price and the exact same thing for the mr2 spyder. Not the easiest thing to install. But it's worth every penny and the endurance is 100 times better then the thin dinky OEM radiator. This radiator is more then twice as thick and can easily handle a extra hundred horsepower. U Can race all day and never worry about overheating. Great buy 5 stars.
B00AA57ZV2|5|I like it
B001S8EC2K|3|I'm sure it's fine but I returned it unneeded
B00HHGRB2U|1|Less then 3 months after installing my new pair of Hubs, the passenger side HUB COMPLETELY FAILED nearly throwing me into the side wall!<br />This left my tire dangling by my break assembly, causing it to drag and scream at me until I came to a stop.<br />Saving a couple extra dollars is not worth risking your life! As well as dealing with all the other issues their Hub failing will cause you.
B00D3QUMWO|5|Perfect fitment in my 1999 Mercedes E320 W210
B0099S559A|5|Great deal, arrived earlier than promised, took less than a minute to program and works GREAT. Just noticed a drop in price, will order another one for a spare.
B0031B4YU2|2|Not as good as the microfiber cloths I bought at Target.  I wash these separately in free and clear detergent and dry on delicate just as I always have my Target microfibers.  These have always left visible little (micro) pieces of lint on surfaces like mirrors, glass, and my cars black paint.  I still use them for general house cleaning, but I prefer my four year old cheapo microfibers.  I wasn't thinking and grabbed one of these to clean my glasses, so much lint I had to go find another microfiber.  I think it's time to throw these out and get some new ones that don't leave lint on everything.
B00KY0MSZG|1|Didn't quite fit, so I had to grind the casting.  Installed it and the motor wouldn't turn.  Can't return it because I needed to grind the casting, so now I have a new boat anchor.  Had to buy another starter (AC Delco), but at least it bolted up perfectly and works like charm.
B001P2AQP6|5|Nailed it
B00246EWWA|3|Good
B00JH22XNO|5|Very well made.
B00MR1LVZS|5|Use these in my solar setup and they work well
B00MJ47C2O|5|Fits my 2004 Ford F-150 Crew Cab . Very easy to install, no drilling holes. Looks and works great!
B00GHT7JUC|5|Perfect fit
B0002Z9QXK|2|Comes with window treatment packet, comes with various adapters, easy to install.  Have had these on for a month.  Not that happy with window cleaning ability -- doesn't wipe as clean as Bosch ICON, the ends of the blade don't seem to scrub crud off very well.
B00WLM41SW|5|Thank you!
B00SRL6FBC|5|fit the car and worked what else can I say
B000CITKEM|2|This system does not work on 93 or earlier dodges 250 trucks without alot of modifing being done. Otherwise can not tell the difference yet.
B00TQPS1V0|1|I purchased June 21, 2015. It's now June 20, 2016 and it does work anymore.
B0030VPAVU|5|Great license plate. It's made out of steel like it says and comes with little caps that go over the screws that cleans it up and makes it harder for someone to take. Great product.
B005CLMYIS|5|Yup.
B00JKSP41S|3|Great
B000H01NFY|5|My Kawasaki EX500 registers noticeably cooler temperatures.  The container had just enough to fill up the radiator and the overflow.
B00EPDLTMG|5|Great
B0102PRIPC|5|[[VIDEOID:7c1f24168ddb31139c4978f3e563127c]]The Pure Clean car wash buffer is a fantastic tool. It is over 3 1/2 feet long and the telescoping arm extends so the reach is fantastic. It comes with a battery charger and a rechargeable 12 volt battery that goes into the handle of the buffer. The head which is powerfully motorized, is where the attachments rotate to do their cleaning. There are 4 brush heads included that can be used over and over again. The head on the end can adjusted to be straight or to 90 degrees. There is a simple button to turn the buffer on and off. The battery lasts longer than it would take to clean you whole car, body, tires, bumpers and roof. The pure clean car wash buffer is a strong durable tool to keep your vehicle clean.<br /><br />I used this buffer on my mini van. I used the sponge to wash my car and a the brushes on my tires. I adjusted the brush head to a 90 degree angle and it was easy and comfortable to use. For the first time I was able to reach the top of my mini van to wash it. I tried all the attachments on my car and dry to see how they work and look. I was surprised how well they worked. It was very easy to use. The only issue I had was that after a while of holding it, it felt a little heavy. Overall I was impressed by the buffer and I would recommend it. I am getting  another one for my son for Christmas. I included a video to show how simple it works and how easy it is to adjust. I received this item at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion.
B000C9B6GQ|5|Fit my 4 cylinder 98 toyota camry perfectly. Easy install, and is holding very well.
B000CQFQI8|5|Just what I needed to make my aftermarket exhaust fit without hitting my bumper!
B001BNP6XG|5|The screen fits my Q7 perfectly and has helped to keep my vehicle from being exposed to the hot southern summer days.
B001B5DM80|5|Works fine, no problem at all.
B00SBZRELY|5|This is just what I needed.  tired of back breaking & spilling of fuel while re-fueling my boat.  Have run it several times without a problem.
B00SISKX58|5|great price perfect fit for my 2005 c230 kompressor
B00RMKF2QS|3|They came in super early. Fit on nice and lowered it full 3&#34; but after installation the ride was way too bumpy. If it wasnt for that itd be 5+ stars
B007VR67K2|5|I used this to install a power steering filter/ cooler on my truck on the LP side. It worked great. High quality thick wall hose. I bought other hose from local auto parts and it was flimsy silicone.
B003XNGLJU|1|Absolute garbage.  Broken right out of the bag.  Upon further inspection, this thing is a total P.O.S.  Don't waste your money, buy the other kind of deer whistles that come in pairs.
B000Y87R4K|5|My old gas cap looked like a cheap black fiberglass worn out piece of junk. This new one fit right in plus it matches good with my bling vent. Both chrome. Nice
B00SJU6AXO|3|Does not quiet the exhaust as good as I expected; Just takes some of the low tone away from the exhaust is all. Was much easier and less permanent to purchase an $6.00 exhaust adaptor sleeve & clamp from the auto parts store, rather than welding the adaptor piece provided with the silencer. Mounting holes did not line up to the frame allowing for the silencer to be mounted horizontally, so it diagonals down at about a 20 degree angle.
B00B3BKM1M|5|Perfect
B0085KGOH0|5|awesome product, easy to use and what a time saver
B007IVQZ5S|5|They were Perfect my brother was so happy about how they made his truck look!!
B000CN5QG8|4|Adequate seal.
B004RCSO5K|4|This did the job - replacing a broken part. Just be really careful when straightening it out. The first one I got, I just tried to straighten and it snapped. I put the second one in hot water and blew a hot hair dryer on it while straightening it out and it worked fine.
B00B1FOWA2|5|fit perfectly!
B000BAT622|5|Works  very well.  When polishing use very little pressure and take your time.
B00EC0YMGC|5|Fit perfectly!
B004J1CX2O|4|I reciieved it early even!
B000CKZZXK|5|Installed both sides in about 1.5 hours and my truck is riding like new.
B00AQ29ETK|4|They fit ok. I did unfortunately have 1 break on the first day after a short ride to grocery store. For the price, I got what I expected.
B0040CWYUI|5|excellent.<br />remove existing clips from the door  ( they will break ).<br />attach the clips to the trim panel.<br />install the panel onto the door.<br />these worked really well
B00LAJTEFW|5|Great price!
B00GPJPC1C|5|all good thanks ..
B001QT9KO6|5|This K-Seal really works!!!!!!  I read the instructions on the other sealants, and this said to just pour it in, go for a ride, and it would seal your leak.  Well, I was not sure it would work, but I bought it anyway because I was desperate to fix my car and didn't have money for a mechanic to fix it.  So I followed the directions and my car is working fine now.  No problems, it really stopped the leak in my radiator.. and for the little money I paid for it, I would say its a great value!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00D9C2CDO|5|Love this bag.  I use it a lot with a family of five.
B0012TZ1RU|5|Used it on my VFR chain. Very good in keeping the chain lubricated. Item arrived in two days
B00AJ3WBE6|1|rotten tube
B006QH6XQG|5|Excellent Battery.
B0000AY4MK|5|It's so refreshing to order a product and actually receive a what I was looking for.  Solid, &#34;heavy-duty&#34; design, that does what it was intended to do.  This rough & rugged addition should be able to hold up to the punishment that my children will most certainly inflict upon it.
B00G620ZVU|5|This product is amazing. I got them this morning and tested them out on a battery they are bright in the daytime WOW! I can't wait to see what they look like at night. I have field tested them so I don't know what they look like and if they leak. I'm very satisfies with the product.
B001NZS9PE|1|Spot weld failed after only one week of use.
B0026NAWYS|5|good
B00430IKZA|1|The  picture shows a can of paint, hardener and reducer. I expected all three cans to show up, very disappointed.
B0027EUPFC|1|While the pump shipped quickly, it didn't last much beyond the warranty.  The impeller  shafts is cheap plastic and breaks easily.  This was my second pump. I eventually went with a sand filter. Product quality on this pump is disappointing.
B009GNAZG6|5|'99 Silverado with shift solenoid b fault code, I dropped the trans pan popped both new shift solenoid A&B in since I was already in there, new pan gasket and filled with trans fluid to spec. Truck shifts great! No fault codes present.  Direct fit and plugged right in.
B003VBGGU8|5|These work great on our pop up camper awning with our lights.  We installed on our string of lights and clipped onto the awning once it was up.  When we took them down, we simply unclipped and left the hook on the lights for storage.  Easy to install and even easier to use!
B00EUUNJRM|5|This light bar was super easy to install and bight as can be absolutely love it, only issue I have is the wires coming out of it are not very long.
B00XC2ZUDK|5|yes good
B00KMDAF0A|3|Love how it looks but its a little small for my truck.
B00UPH2Y02|5|They charged me for 3 so I asked them to take it off and they did within a few hours , very satisfied with my purchase and would recommend the sticker , I get many complements on it :-)
B00GR2W8AA|5|great decal
B00VRGM9RI|1|Bought the light kit, not happy at all. The blue light comes on when I push the button the lights do nothing.it doesn't turn the lights on or off or change colors.When I wired to the battery the lights come on, red only and I can't shut them off. I would not recommend to anyone. Bought this set for a 30,000 dollar Harley trike and they were a waste of money
B00236UM6G|5|Perfect
B007ND4P0S|4|Arrived promptly and prior reviews are accurate, what a pain to remove the old and install the replacements.  What I won't do to save a boatload of labor charges from a BMW dealer!  The angel eyes are white, as promised and look better than the OEM yellow (in my opinion).  Nope they're not as bright as the late model 5 series LED's, but my '07 still runs great and now I have those white halos that show up great at night.  Plus, I'm no longer getting that nagging error that the passenger side &#34;parking lights&#34; (daytime running lights?) aren't working.
B00KY8E734|4|The insides of my old unit didn't  fit. Set them aside and used the two new pods  I ordered at the same time and they worked after dealer programming
B002X2S3PW|5|It works!!!
B00EUUNJRM|5|I ordered my light bar got it in two days package was damaged and light bar had a dent nothing bad but I emailed the seller and thay sent a new one came in two days later super fast shipping both times the seller was very professional and just wanted to keep me happy after installing light it looks great and works great for 60.00 you can't beat it I do recommend putting silicon anywhere water can get in your light just cause of other reviews I would highly recommend this bar to any one FYI this bar fits small trucks I have it on a 4 runner it fits perfectly if you have a full size truck get a 50 or 52&#34; bar good luck I hope you like yours as much as I like mine
B00T4TEWBQ|5|Fast, friendly service from these folks!  This is the best auto trash can I've ever used.  Bought one from Target years ago and wanted another for a new truck and after extensive searching finally found the Phil. (New name but just like my beloved old one!)  Expensive, but really like the stiff lid which flips open easily and hides the trash well.  The size is just right. Go Phil it up in your own truck!
B006H2HSQO|5|This minor changes to my cold air intake made driving my truck much more fun. I love the sound of it when I accelerate. No loud noise while on cruising speed. Only get the sound when I put the hammer down. LOVE IT
B003NZ4XLG|5|My 8 year old son LOVES this helmet with goggles and gloves. The gloves are a little big on his hands, but he truly doesn't care and wears all of it together whenever he rides. He also wears the goggles separately when he goes off on the side by side with his dad. Good product. Helmet is even nicer looking in person.
B00M9DIUNU|3|good for my need but don't hold up well in winter.
B000GBIQ5O|5|Perfect fit and quick installation on my 98 accord
B00K73QBKS|5|Very satisfied!
B001C8YPH8|4|They are OK, although a bit overpriced for performance.

B00W31VMYC|1|First i am from Saudi Arabia. I bought this ODB II but it doesn't work on my  Toyota Land Cruiser 2002 and Nissan Navarra 2013 even though amazon give me check mark that will fit in Toyota Land Cruiser 2002. Its fit but doesn't work. may be it doesn't work on GCC Versions. I try it on Hyundai accent 2008 and 2010 and it work
B00LAGN2GW|5|Great product for pools.  Amazon shows it ranked in automotive yet it has absolutely no automotive use.<br />It is a swimming pool filter part and a great replacement part.  Much stronger than the original.<br />Zodiac Jandy Filter Air Relief Valve assembly.  *****
B009099P4E|1|Did not fit 2005 Jeep Wrangler.
B005HJMX4U|5|Secure magnet; and case.
B003UBLUP0|5|good cord quality
B001GY1QKM|4|A side zipper broke the first week I had this, but besides that good quality.
B004J3AZUY|5|Worked great. Check engine light on 2001 Chevy Prizm (176,000 miles) had been on for years.  Could not pass new NJ emissions test this year with check engine light on even if light was reset. 2 oxygen sensors had been changed 3 years ago and the light still would come on.  Checked spark plugs. Changed air filter and manifold intake gasket ($10).  Light did not go out until I changed the Mass Air Flow Sensor.  Have driven car hundreds of miles light still out. Passed NJ emissions inspection!  This sensor also got rid of a hesitation I had sometimes on take off mostly when the engine was cold. Anyone can install easily in 5 minutes with a screw driver. Amazon had the lowest price and delivery was fast.
B003VLBPJA|2|The hooks are made from soft metal they bent open very easy.  The ends of hooks have covers which fell off after first use.
B00M7RERPS|5|I really like the product, serves the purpose. Decent quality, easy to put on and remove and for the price, why not buy it??!
B008QXZ5MQ|5|Genuine part, perfect fit!
B00NOA8NCU|4|I put a set of these in my wife's fog lights in her 2011 Yukon. They don't emit enough light to drive with just them on but they look great and match the Hid low beams. The plugs were very hard to get in but once I got them in they have been fine.
B00EPDLETO|5|Plate fit perfectly on a 2014 Jeep Grand Cherokee.  Its well made and has gone through a couple car washes now and still looks exactly like it did when it came out of the box.  Highly recommend, go blue! It does have a chrome finish that does reflect everything in case anyone was wondering.
B00HS5KLT0|5|Exact fit! Would've been nice if it came with the seals my jeep has on the rotors, but a good buy!
B0051N0QIC|3|It's ok for the price. Smells similar to air spencer but not as good. Think of your favorite cologne smell and then what the knock off scent smells like and you'll get the idea.
B000YWDXL2|1|This product is not a original / OEM. Product is different from the picture that's posted
B000CN5NR0|5|Awesome product! Fits well and will not shake @ 75mph; even after 12 hours at that speed with a 30mph head wind. I was super impressed! Would buy again!
B00G3SSVRM|5|WOW, what a fantastic light bar. As a retired LEO, and fleet manager, I know about light bars. The lights are extremely bright when used in daylight, nights are fantastic. The bar comes with solid or flashing take downs, solid or flashing alley lights and even traffic manager on the rear of the light bar. The light bar comes with control box and connects with plug ins. Just hook the red to the positive side of the battery and the black to the negative side. It's ready to go!!!  The gutter mounts are included and can be shaped to fit just about any vehicle. I have it on my 2015 KIA Sportage. I am extremely happy that I bought this light bar and would highly recommend it.
B00480J4PU|1|this bulb burn out in 3 month
B000EFIT8G|4|Great little spot light
B0000AXPDU|5|ok
B009SMBC8K|2|No hardware supplied, very hard to install. No rubber/Gourmets  to stop it from denting ur body.
B003XFTUGO|5|This is a great product.  Easy to work with and really shines your car to a mirror finish.
B000BXKYYI|4|The right size but a bit tough to balance if you're pouring from a heavy container and have only one hand available. Sturdy construction. Filter an added bonus.
B00HMBHTWW|5|I love these. Just as described. Soft, plush and seem well made. They look much better than pictured. I fit these on my 97 Volvo 850 and they will work with the side impact airbags with a little tucking. They hug the seats nicely and they make the care more plush and comfy.. Best seat covers for the price. Highly recommended!
B0039Z3SRA|1|Would not buy again, doesn't work as advertised. Didn't expect miracles but distorts the sound like a flimsy enclosure, don't waste your money.
B000GBBP8O|5|Slimmer than my original strut but works just as well. Strut body is gloss black rather than the satin silver shell of the OEM. Installed in 30 seconds on my 2001.5 Passat.
B00GWFOJBI|5|Fits nicely in my 2015 Tacoma DCSB. Nice rubbery feel like oem and quality is second to none.
B00G620ZVU|5|Worked great easy to hook up exactly what I was looking for very bright and will definitely buy more
B002OUIXU8|2|As soon as the waste started flowing through the line and hit the wye, it separated at the junction where orange meets white. Ill spare you the rest, it was disgusting. Its not connected very well it just snaps on with a shallow rim. If you get this, make sure you either lay it on the ground or support it with a brick or some type of device....gross.
B000ARPVNO|5|Great product as usual, highly recommend this product.
B00Z8F2UA0|5|Items came very quickly, nicely packaged. My husband did not use them wet first. But he took the fingery one out to the cars and tried it on the dash, and was extremely happy! Got into all the crevices and got all of the dust, immediately. We have never had anything work that well before. So then I tried them wet and dry on the bathroom mirror. Super fast, and streak free. We still have not used them to actually wash the cars yet, but I will add more details when we do. I absolutely love this set and highly recommend it.
B000GV0YEU|5|Really nice  and affordable windshield.  Easy to install.  I am very happy with this purchase.
B00LOZBDBU|5|The color of the bear and the size of the red stripe are like the flag.  I saw on Amazon other brands of california license plate that are not as beautiful as this one, meaning not exactly like the flag.  The packaging was OK to protect the plate from shipping and handeling.
B00514C18Y|5|Installs in 2 minutes,fit my 2015 road King perfectly, really an improvement over the stock black plastic
B009E9J1Y4|5|Excellent, easy to program!
B008H5UAY6|5|Very good quality
B002IV8JKM|5|Just as advertised, quality piece.
B000EVU8J8|4|I HAVE NOT USED IT  YET  BUT LOOKS GREAT HOPE TO TRY  SOON AND SEE HOW IT WORKS
B007KIUDBQ|5|Rocks!
B003UFSFHM|4|Have only used it once but love it
B000N3W8J0|5|a must have ! I didnt know about such an item ! very smart fits in 5 gal bucket keep dirt on bottom
B00FO7JET2|5|Fits nice and snug. A must have. Those other complaints are obviously from people that have never switched out a steering wheel cover. The smell isn't half as bad as they make it seem. I have air freshener in my truck and I can't smell anything.
B001DRI5LA|5|nice
B00A8MZ910|5|works great
B001GN6QQW|1|Cheap crap.  Unlike other breakaways this only works once and cannot be reset!
B005JPJJNU|5|Very Pleased with this purchase.  I apply this after polishing and before waxing.  I do a 3 step process: Polish, Seal and Wax.<br />Well, 4 if you count washing and 5 if you count drying!  But for real, use a small quantity because this is the case where &#34;A LITTLE<br />IS MORE&#34;.  Apply as directed (I apply either and a small amount to surface or to applicator sponge.  In either case, I rub it out over a very large area- do not put it on heavy because (a) you will just be wasting and (b) there is no added benefit and (c) it will take much longer to dry and<br />(d) may make it harder to remove.  I wash and wax about every 2 months.  I use to be the person whom spend hours every week, week in and week out washing and waxing.  But now, I use QUALITY PRODUCTS, reasonably priced and apply as prescribed.  Out here in the California Sun, the sun does beat hard on paint (clear coats).  I have no problem with a every 2 month (sometimes 3) wash, seal and wax.  I polish once if I neglect the paint longer-  and need to start from the begining (strip all wax and sealers, re-polish, seal and wax.Otherwise, it is wash and wax or sometimes wash, polish, seal and wax.  Remember, it is about building up layer after layer of wax and you can use sealer after you wash and then wax over it each and every time after you wash.

B00OC9HMTM|3|The light bar it's self is great and bright but the mounting bolts on the side are crap, it stripped the threads with very little torque. The bolts were easy enough to swap out with grade 8 hardware but the fact that I had to do it when it should've came that way is why I only give this 3 stars
B003SS62PS|5|I love this fan..was skeptical at first from the reviews..but it works great..and it's not loud like others were saying..gave great air to my lo's in the back seat..very happy..
B00YS8JW54|5|fits our 2010 GMC Acadia, and my 2007 Mustang perfectly!
B002INQ434|5|First time using this in my 2003 GSXR-750 and it works like a charm. The temperature drops very quickly after stopping at a light and goes down to lower temps than the previous coolant. While riding with a friend, we stopped at a light and I looked over at his temp gauge and it was 10 degrees hotter than mine (mine was 179 and his was 189). That was proof enough for me that this stuff really works and keeps the engine cooler than your regular coolant. Seems like it dissipates the heat more efficiently. Overall, I'm stoked with this stuff and will continue to use it in my bike. Ambient air temps while riding range from 75 to above 90 and it's usually super humid as well here in NJ.
B00ESLBPOM|1|Crap!  Don't get this

B00HRSN0JG|5|This was a easy drop in replacement for my right side rear passenger door on my 2006 Ford Fusion. The problem was you couldn't open the door using the handles and this did fix it. You need some special tox drivers to do the job but it was all covered in my Haynes manual for this car that I got at my local auto parts store.
B00DPNBXHI|5|It fits perfect like it
B001RJOP5Y|5|I think we really like it.  It's my husband's toy.  We use it to charge the battery of our camper..  It works just as he had hoped it would.  Easy to set up, use, and transport.

B00BEZSEOO|5|Great
B0002KKTFO|5|I've only had this for a short while and used it 2-3 times, but it works great.<br />Grease loads easily and the vent makes it easy to eliminate air bubbles.<br />Handle is comfortable and easy to use.  I have smaller hands and it is not a problem.<br />Coupler is somewhat hard to get onto the fitting, but that could just be because it is new.  The coupler does hold well and does not leak.

B00C7I4PJ0|5|Excellent
B004B8EUI0|5|Purchased this product to get rid of the scuff marks on the door sill and the lower part of the doors.  It works as advertised and the scuff marks and gone and has not reappeared.  I used this with a old toothbrush and clean eraser pad.
B000S2QVYE|5|Great product I am a firm believer in replacing parts with stock parts. When you replace the wires make sure you put the provided grease into the boot end of wires. Make sure you hear a click when you install onto spark plug and the boot side as well.
B003TTL0TE|5|Great microfiber car washing mitt. Fabric is thick and durable, will last a long time.
B00FL08HLI|3|Item was dilvered on time and in good condition. However there where no instructions, but I figured it out, not really a whole lot to it. The &#34;C&#34; clamps that hold the jack down barely fit around the hi jack though. I would have to beat them on to get them where they needed to be. Then to get them off you had to use a big flat head or something to pry them off. I think mostly because the paint or powder coat they put on the inside of the clamps. Once I used a grinder and took off the paint on the inside of the clamp they work great. Even though I needed to modify them a little, I still like them a lot. They have a really thick textured paint or powder coat on them I feel will last a long time. Plus I love the look of having my hi-lift jack on my hood. I do suggest putting some kind of rubber or gaskit between your hood hinge and this part though. That's one more thing I would have though to come with this purchase. If I didn't put some rubber on my hood under this product I'm sure if I ever took it off there would be scratches and surface damage to hood.
B005CXJTAW|1|This is only ONE coil and no harness, NOT like the picture and NOT like the answer to the question.  Don't buy unless you are expecting to get and happy with getting just one coil.  Why call it an &#34;assembly&#34;?  I was expecting to get what was pictured...not one ignition coil.
B001NYK9NU|5|Don't reuse your nuts, these work great and gives the peace of mind that your hubs are securely fastened.  Buy the proper socket and torque them to factory specs, you will be glad you did.
B00UVHSHP2|5|Great
B009DJSZBK|3|fitted ok. and packed well , but still had two dents  in it
B001L9ZC5C|5|Awsome
B0024NO97Q|3|First, the quality of the units was good. Shipping was good. After they were installed (for the third time) they looked great. However, by default they are aimed WAY too high. Maybe it was just my car ('05 GT convertible), but my car has not been in any accidents and both left and right headlights were off identically. On top of this, Chrysler did a crappy job engineering the headlights, so after installation you can only do a horizontal adjustment, not vertical. There actually is a vertical adjustment on the rear of the unit (original and this replacement), but once the headlight is installed the screw is inaccessible. So after installing them three times to get the adjustment right, I recommend these steps:<br />- The car has to be jacked up to replace the headlights. If the aim of the old headlights was good, mark the where the beam center is on the wall after jacking and before removing the old lights. This is your rough reference and will work with as little as 4' of distance to the wall.<br />- Note where the vertical adjustment set screw is on the rear of the new unit. Drill a 3/16&#34; hole in the car's mounting bracket so you can get at this screw from the wheel well after the new headlight is installed.<br />- Once the headlight is installed but before taking the car off the jack, or even putting the bumper back on, turn on the new headlight and check with your rough reference from the old headlight. If it is too high, fix it before putting the car back together. You can take it out and use the set screw on the back. If that doesn't do enough adjustment (not even close in my case) you can add washers to the top mounting studs. I used a set of pliers and removed the top two mounting screws from the plastic body, added three washers to the top only, and reinstalled the mounting screws. Then reinstalled the headlight in the car. That plus the set screw got me the adjustment I needed.<br />- Remove the bumper versus just loosen the bumper: Since I took my carapart multiple times to make the aim right, I used both You-Tube recommended methods. In my opinion full removal of the bumper was easier. I had jack stands and was doing both sides at once though.<br />- High beams are a pain to get at once the housing is installed. Install the high beam bulb before installing the new housing into the car.<br />The car does look 100% better now, but adjustment was a PITA. Good luck.
B000CMHVF8|5|Plugged in fine and is doing good so far!

B00FCE49FQ|5|Perfect Fit - installed on 2001 Sea-Doo RX after a rock destroyed the OEM wear ring.  This ring went on with minimal effort and fit as good as an OEM part.  Clearance was perfect between the pump as well as with the Solas Dynafly impeller that was installed.
B008427D88|5|I ordered these for my husband to use in replacing the undercarriage on a Chrysler 300. They fit great and are good for the price!
B0022UP8XA|5|I've been a Nelson Riggs  guy for years and have bought at least a half dozen covers manufactured by them.This was my first experience with a  Dowco cover and I'll tell you that I'm a customer of their's for life now.<br />Superior quality and workmanship go beyond what words can describe in comparison to the Nelson Riggs products I've owned.
B004U3W9A2|5|Great fit and sound to my Titan.  Purchased this with my jba short titanium ceramic coated heads.  Perfect combination and add on
B00GSAUHB8|4|it is very big. by using this sunshield, the car wont get too hot. the only problem is that it is tricky to fold it back.
B006P2K57K|5|Good product
B00P7QIFQ8|1|ITS OKAY, BUT IT DOESNT HOLD MY SUINGLASSES WELL:-(
B00OMB3WJ4|4|Except for the arm rest covers being a little short, these fit really well at this price point. The fact that arm rest covers were included at all was a pleasant bonus. Fanciest ever? No, but at less than half the cost of tailor made covers from other makers, I'm very happy! I am going to order some more for my other van right away.

B000J4NM7U|4|Good product!
B00V2XIOK2|4|I'm a noob, but I'm common sensed.  keep that in mind as you read this..<br /><br /> I'm replacing an HJC CL-11 as it didnt provide enough shade from the sun in morning or evening when sun is at getting in your face.  I wanted a overhead visor and I'd heard good things about this helmet<br /><br />My experience with this helmet is short and only in California sun riding.<br /><br />Tried it on at local stores so knew the fit was right.  I love the fit once on, but this one seemed tight getting over the head.  that didnt occur at store so maybe those were tried on a lot (who knows).<br />FOV is slightly better that HJC i currently own, but that was expected.  Visor seals well around helmet (rubber seal) when closed and there are plenty of vents.  This is a well made helmet with quality parts<br /><br />Ok, now the dislikes.<br /><br />Noise: it's noisier than my HJC CL-11 by enough to notice.  The over head visor seems to cause whistling starting at about 45mph and the pitch increases as you speed up.<br />Wind Resistance:  At 45mph you start to fight the wind when you turn your head, even doing a mirror check with slight head turn.  At 60 it's a strong fight to turn your head.  In neutral position it's consistent with the other helmet.  Some have said it's because of the visor, but I believe it's not the visor, but the shape of the chin guard, which elongates the helmet.<br /><br />The visor has 2 issues IMO.<br /><br />Visor #1:  Due to the shape of the helmet, the visor has a sharper curve to it than a typical street helmet visor due to the elongated chin.  The angles causes your face reflection to be offset and slightly distorted and also brighter.  When the sun hits the side of your face, it shows in the visor.  If you try it in the store, walk outside into the sun.  Some have complained of nausea from this, but does not occur to me and will probably get used to it.  I even saw color distortion on man hole covers at times (glossy purple) which suggested there islight refraction going on across the arc of the visor<br /><br />Visor #2:  because of the shape of the chin guard the visor is shaped to fit it, thus it's not a straight line on the bottom, it's notched to fit.  This becomes a visual obstacle when trying to leave the visor partially open, thus, you don't leave it open other than to leave a crack, or fully.<br /><br />Pros:  Quality craftmanship, venting, comfortable, light.<br />Cons:  shape of the visor, noisier than other helmets i've owned.
B0079DGNMU|5|Fits 2015 CRV perfectly. Took about an hour to install because I didn't have a very short screwdriver to fit between the tire and care to put in the screws. Looks great and it's cheaper than buying from the dealership.
B00T74VX24|2|It doesnt seem to charge all way and doesn't let me know on indicator lights that it's done charging.  Hopefully I got the one out of thousands that is quirky.  Though it works.
B007772HG4|5|Works great
B00B4L0IGA|1|Had on truck for a couple weeks. Very quiet and good stopping power. Much better priced then from dealer.<br /><br />Update - 4 months later<br />Rotors have stared to squeak very badly.  I had ACDelco pads installed with the rotors.  I thought that maybe the pads had gone bad so I had new pads put on again (better quality).  Still squeaking just as bad.  It is the rotors that are the problem, not the pads.

B00AQB3KLO|1|Did not fit 2003 camry
B00X6S199E|2|Although these say that they will fit a 2015 F150, they are much larger than the current lugnets, so that means that these lock will stick out further than all of the others on the wheel.  I decided to not use them since they looked so weird.
B00D8BFJP4|1|Love the sticker but it doesn't stay on very well...within two days it was folding around the edges.

Everything stolen, starting over again... Livid...
B00PARUG6G|5|This deflector actually has a lip tall enough on it to deflect bugs. Isn't that why we buy these things anyway? You'll always get a lot more bugs coming at you than gravel.
B00F4PC98W|5|It looks great
B00CLBTHJ6|5|These are really amazing. Good quality and great look. I already ordered two more because they are so worth it and add an amazing look to my car.
B00G1Y4R3U|4|looks good
B003UXZ6RG|1|While this item is soft and stylish, it was advertised as fitting my specific car.  It does not.  While installing it around the steering wheel was a little difficult (because one has to stretch it over and around it), once it's actually ON the steering wheel it slips all over the place--maybe by over a centimeter.  That gap creates an comfortable &quot;puffy&quot; feeling for the hands when gripping the steering wheel, but worse, a feeling that UNSAFETY and INSTABILITY when turning the car.  This rubber wheel cover slips all around my wheel.  I have to keep adjusting that, too.  Total waste of money.
B008CLNYPC|5|Love it
B004GD9AA8|3|Fixed the problem of being able to open the door but the manual lock/unlock link no longer works. The electric lock control works fine, so for now I'm not putting more time into making the link work again.

B009Z0ALHS|5|Worked great service was excellent.
B00W5PZ882|3|A little bit cheaper looking (and feeling) than I expected. Installation wasn't as easy as they claim. They didn't fit perfectly on my 01 TJ, but I was able to get them on with a little help from a file and my Dremel.<br /><br />They look okay once installed, and we're a pretty cheap update.

B00CKAQDRW|5|Very comfortable and smooth to the touch. It locks onto the stick pretty well.
B003CR2ILM|1|The mileage increases are greatly exaggerated. It looks good but it does not pay for itself. If I had to do it over again I would not invest in the product.

B004940ZSK|5|Right price and perfect fit.
B003NBFKDK|4|Works great, but seems kinda flimsy, but at this price point its fine.  We use this to transport small dirt bikes (about 300lbs total) to the track always seems like they are going to push through the fencing but it has held up, might be more of a perception thing. It rocks a bit from side to side so may need to get one of those hitch tighteners. Overall it has been great for our needs and it was inexpensive.  It would be perfect if I was hauling flat/square objects like coolers, camping equipment, tool boxes etc.
B0086QCARQ|5|Fast ship when I needed it.  Good quality.  Thanks.
B00WJ71I2G|5|Love it. .its exactly what I was looking for.
B006QGD996|3|Ok for the price. The straps seem thinner than other tie downs that I have and the plastic covers on the ratchet fall off. My biggest complaint is that the strap on the ratchet side is only 2&#34; long limiting its use, you can't hook it to itself around a pipe for example,
B007OSL3DY|5|Does it's job.. no complaints from the husband. ;)

B01093PU2K|5|I spend a lot of time at the computer and this Gelepad saves me so much pain and related stress! The padding so comfortable and supportive. What a fabulous invention! It stays right where I put it and the adhesive is so flexible, I can travel with it and use it anywhere. Even after a year of use, it still provides support and adheres to any desktop like new.
B0057FU7SI|5|This was installed on a 1998 Saturn SW2 used for business purposes, and often being started at least a dozen times a day. It went through literally hundreds of starts with no problems whatsoever. I recommend it as a cheap yet reliable replacement.Ch
B00E8HGED8|2|I thought for the price of the unit I would buy it but after about a month of using it the rubber pad fell off and my bike dropped. Also once it's in the air and the stand is locked in it is very hard to lift the lever to lower the bike.
B000TD6S9U|5|Very durable.  Holds a charge for a long time.
B00SCYVEPG|5|installation was easy and worked great.
B000BUU5YU|5|I am giving it 5 stars based on visual product quality and feel. Unfortunately, I will have to return this item because the item picture is kind of deceiving and let me explain. The male plug on pictured items looks like a regular 115/110 Volt but it's not. I have taken pictures of item as received and uploading for future buyer's reference (a picture is worth 1000 words).
B006L92R2S|3|I HAVE A SOLID REAR BENCH SEAT WITH NO HEAD REST IN MY JEEP. MY FIRST QUESTION IS, CONSIDERING ALL OF THE ZIPPERS THAT THIS COVER HAS FOR A SPLIT REAR SEAT, CAN THIS BE MADE TO FIT A ( SOLID BENCH REAR SEAT,) WITH ( NO HEAD REST?)<br /><br />ALSO, I WAS WONDERING IF THEY HAD THIS SET IN A ( &#34;TAN&#34; & BLACK COLOR,) AS WELL AS BEIGE.
B00G2T6O30|3|It's ok..the build quality is typical 'made in china' stuff - the seams didn't align right and it had some stray plastic strands that I needed to file off<br /><br />In use, it sometimes rattles against the windshield (as someone mentioned, had they used larger suction cups it would fix it). Also the EZPass tag fits snugly depth-wise, but has a bit of space vertically when the lid is closed, so if you hit a bump just right, you can sometimes hear it rattle too.<br /><br />Long story short, it looks nice on the windshield, I'd probably buy it again, but it does have some downsides.
B003EMGND4|1|The fit on my 06 TJ was weird.
B004A6OCPY|5|Fast shipping and a spot on fan module.
B00UCIP2IK|3|Way to hard to fold
B00KZJQ2L2|5|Covers my truck window perfectly and completely shuts out the sun.  Easy and light-weight to install each day.
B00N9L989Q|5|Cute and worked great!
B000C9Q0YE|5|Bolted up perfectly and works like charm.
B005VLCFAG|5|nice .. works fine.
B007UHPUNI|5|I purchased on at Wal-Mart to protect my seat when I came out of the gym all sweaty. Began bringing guests with me to the gym and was able to buy a 2nd cover to match the first, here. I'm very happy with how well they hold up for the price. I remove and wash them once a week and they still look good.
B00JMUKIHO|1|Really cheap chinese product.  Looks awful, and the bootleg mazdaspeed logo was half worn off before I even got it out of the box.  It will leave your car with absolutely no reception to radio, but looks decent from about 10 ft away.  I was actually not that unhappy with the product because all I wanted was something to replace the 4ft tall stock antenna on my 99 miata, and this thing was easy to install and from a distance did not look half bad.  A week after installing it, I slightly brushed my hand against it when filling up my gas and it snapped off.  I touched it with almost enough force to tip over a solo cup.  The hardware was extremely cheap and I cannot understand how something could be so fragile.  This would without a doubt break if you went through a car wash.
B00XBFN2JW|5|Awesome product! I have installed multiple OPT7 kits in my 52 hotrod. When I discovered this expansion pack i didnt hesitate to order a set to replace all ready installed lights under my dash. The &#34;Y&#34; adapter made install easy and most of the wiring was already completed. I love that you can  change the color of the lights, no more one color only. OPT7 kits are very easy to install and come with everything you will need plus more. OPT7 light kits have been a huge hit at the car shows.
B004BU1VX0|5|I put them on my bike and they've been working ever since
B005UO70ZO|5|great
B00WX2DWFI|1|Size &#34;Mini&#34;  No use to  anyone.
B0010E1M02|5|The second one I use, very satisfied, the only issue is that apparently the baking soda deposits a little in the vents grid after few month of use but are easy to clean and does the job in a better air quality.
B001DLO740|5|perfect fit
B000X1XZHQ|4|Everything was great!  On-time delivery, package was in good condition, product was as described.
B006LO4L6I|5|awesome...........
B00SSMOS5U|4|Great sunshade, definitely keeps the car cool. I'm glad I checked reviews before I purchased, I had no idea how sensitive the eyesight cameras are, I was prepared to purchase just a generic shade from the store.<br /><br />The only thing I don't like is that it doesn't fold/roll up easily, so it takes up way more space than I would prefer when in storage.
B0039T059U|5|This item really does keep the RV batteries from losing water due to overcharging. The batteries are kept at 13.2 now instead of 13.7 volts DC, which was where the stock charger kept them. Had to bypass the stock charger (leaving it in place) and position this one nearby. With some thought it wasn't too challenging to disconnect the stock charger and rewire the smart charger in.
B008Y57SDU|2|Picture of jeans gives the impression the legs have a tapered cut to them.  If anything, they seem to flair out and are very wide at the bottom.
B004GCRF8I|5|Works great looks great,  bolted on perfect<br />thank you
B007QBJ9J4|5|Perfect fitment; too very little time to install.
B00IAC19FA|5|very satisfied
B00VU8LERE|1|The radiator has a crack in it did not find it till after I had installed had to put me tanks on it wasn't very happy
B0007WP5II|2|Directions may as well be thrown away, they do not show by pic, or in type as to how to attach this cover. There are pics obviously but if you follow them you will not get this on. I have a 2015 Tacoma, and the frame for the tonneau covers the cargo rails on the side, making them useless. On top of that, you need to fully remove the front cargo rail to put the tonneau on. The weather stripping was peeling and coming off right out of the package, and there's a 5&#34; strip of rubber that I'm sure should be attached to something that was just loose in the box. It also leaves a gap on both sides of the bed a few inches from the tailgate, so weather tight? No it's not.
B005JUX1S4|4|Wireless is nice but the controller isn't the best.  Tough to find locations under the truck to mount both the compressor and wireless controller.  Have to set the controller for higher pressure after loading the camper and set the controller for lower pressure before unloading the camper otherwise it will start operating all of a sudden.  The analog version gave more flexibility although you had to wire it into the truck.  Would be nice if there was an &#34;enter&#34; button to take the setting after you put it in.
B00Q0DQWDK|1|They look good at first, however fade very quickly and look ugly. I was disappointed because they expensive and for what they lasted not worth the buy.
B000CIE4S4|5|Very good
B00XNSKIWG|5|Looks good.
B006X98A7C|5|excellent replacement, fits well, provides the necessary power and charges without an problem.
B001O074JU|4|Decent but not mind blowing
B00TQ07IOQ|5|very satisfied
B0078U8TZ8|2|Photo is deceiving.
B0067MH8P0|5|received part in timely manner and at a great cost.
B002N5DE2G|2|priced to high
B009XUAWA6|5|I purchased the long bed model. The 240 lb beast is an amazing work of engineering. Be prepared to have a helping hand to install it. My only gripe is that I had to redrill the mis-aligned holes through the deck side rails inorder to allow the bolt to fit the black side cargo rails
B00CU4L8E6|4|very nice looking and does the job, but it could fit just a little snugger, other then it's great.
B002NUFVCC|1|I purchased this item several months ago but did not have any cars due for a oil change. My daughter was visiting from California and her Honda Pilot needed a oil change so I put the car up on my mid height lift - As the oil was draining into the container we noticed that oil was spilling out over the concrete floor. We realized that the bottom of the container was not sealed to the top and the container was leaking all around the seal.<br /><br />Grrr. Lesson learned - I have ordered a new plastic molded one piece drain.
B00FEE17X6|3|NICE BRIGHT LIGHT BUT DOESN'T PROJECT VERY FAR.  GREAT FOR LIGHTING UP THE IMMEDIATE AREA.
B000760FX4|5|They come in handy.  Nice quality.
B00KPR9Q30|4|Easy to install and didn't have to make any modification to the system.
B00F73F7BW|5|As described and much less expensive than the local dealer.
B000IYA3R8|5|it worked fine in my tribu
B00O72R7Z8|5|Very easy to install and great product, they are good quality wires not the cheap stuff, and it is already pre wired doesn't get easier then that.
B000JKF2A4|5|One of the best purchases I have made for my Titan.  Great sound, power fit.  Bolted right on. Can't say enough about them.
B000NMDFNY|5|Works wonders on my bmw
B00CAKILAO|1|Very bad and strong smell! Put it outside for almost one month, still smells bad!
B00BTGSGFK|5|Great applicators for leather cleaners and polishes.
B000ZN03KY|5|was the perfect part
B007OW6M0Y|5|Great product!
B0067DO69U|5|Fit him perfectly!
B000GZMD4U|5|Much more stout than the factory grab bar.  I needed to replace the factory bar because it broke in half from hitting the ground doing wheelies.  This one hasn't hit the ground yet but I have a feeling it will hold up fine.  Also, many times the dune flag tab will break off on grab bars. This one appears to be much more secure.   Update:  I have hit this on the ground many times now from doing wheelies and it's still just as secure as the day I installed it!  Great grab bar!  No complaints at all!
B00UQM0ARK|5|thank you
B000CIJUGK|5|worked as was supposed to
B008JQAWNC|3|Great helmet. Good quality. The outside diameter is Just bigger than its competitors. Reason why I returned it.
B00E8CV0EQ|1|Most of the reviews for this product are given based on feel and have never been tried. I bought these for my wife's vehicle. I decided to test them out since I had access to a junked vehicle. (1998 Jeep Grand Cherokee) I could not get the side passenger window to break no matter how many times I hit the glass. I even tried standing outside the car to get a full swing. As a safety device, I would not count on this to save my life. I am looking for a better option. I also tried the seatbelt cutting blade and found it difficult to cut at all. The blade seemed flimsy in the plastic and would only cut at a very specific angle with the belt pulled extremely tight. I'd rather not have useless tools.
B00UUSMPJG|5|THESE LIGHTS ARE TRULY AMAZING !!!!  As a customer, I purchased 10 of these lights and absolutely love them. They are water-proof, very bright and are able to be programed to flash many different color patterns. Since they do not come with any detailed instructions and can easily be mistaken as &#34; arriving defective &#34; I will now create a list below explaining exactly how they work and how to change the &#34; color-patterns &#34; in order to customize the color and pattern to the one you like ! PLEASE NOTE that the price you see advertised for this product is for one light so, if you wanted to put one on each tire, you would have to buy four of them. In addition, they are also &#34; SOLAR- POWERED &#34; and last a very long time ! Below are the details :<br />a ) Each light consists of 6 different colors !<br />b ) After removing the light from the box, YOU MUST LOOK CLOSELY and you will see a SMALL BLACK BUTTON encased inside the water-proof housing that covers the entire light. Upon pressing that button, the different colors along with the different light patterns will start to change in sequential order. NOTE that there are a TOTAL OF 6 different colors and a TOTAL OF 16 different color patterns to choose from. Each light you buy consists of all these choices and each light can be set to display the exact same color as well as the exact same pattern ! Just be sure to LOCATE & PRESS THE SMALL BLACK BUTTON in order to work these lights properly and, YOU WILL LOVE THE EFFECT THEY CREATE !!!
B000TYOQVQ|4|If it doesn't go on easily, try switching the knobs around and they will work.
B000E28MTU|5|Good product, fast delievery
B000CP8PHS|1|Just had to have my motor replaced due to the fact that it clogged it so bad. It broke the motor.
B00H6ETIWY|3|cheaply made and missing screws and bolts I would adapt some truck mirrors before purchasing these again,not sturdy enough for xuv
B0090X9IJC|4|Nice faucet. Perfect fit in the precut holes in our camper. Only drawback, which is why I took a star off, is the faucet is too close to the rim of the sink. If it came into the middle of the sink it would be ideal.
B00KQXKG46|5|great product for a fantastic price.
B00DHPRKOY|5|Perfect fit love it.
B00POG2XPU|1|Rusted completely within 6 months. A big NOPE from me.
B001KO92BS|5|Quick and easy install. Looks and feel great.
B004O2NDIQ|5|very happy with the jack
B00AZ4SIEQ|4|It was not what I expected. I was looking for some that stuck to the black molding around the windows and this one sticks to the paint on the doors.
B00BSG00SC|5|Exactly what I was looking for
B002E5DT66|4|No complaints, it was the same size as the oem filter and fit well.  I'll see how dirty it is in a few months.
B00XRPI0X4|5|Was a perfect replacement and worked well
B00UIUK5AM|4|Had issues with high beam halogen lights flickering but customer service was great they sent me two new fixtures to replace however one hid light is slightly blue compared to the other but that might be an electrical issue. Will buy from opt7 again
B007V8WBPQ|5|bright light good price two
B007KSY5W4|5|Bought this to replace motor on my range fan I  my 2011 forest river RV. Lower amp than previous, so that's a plus. Works well, nice and quiet.
B00OZA5I3K|5|Good quality,  And it impresses all of my Redneck Friends.  F*** Y** ISIS!
B00E5OUOCQ|5|Exactly what I expected. Two spherical disks that can easily shade my 2012 Prius's dash from the sun. I have an iPod arm, so I couldn't get the laser fitted sunshade. This was 1/5 the cost and works amazingly! It's also easy to store.
B005J6JRMM|5|Just what I needed. My seatbelt buckle was too low and wedged between the center console and the driver seat, making it difficult to buckle up and unbuckle. Now it's raised just high enough that I'm not struggling with my seatbelt when I need to drive. Easy installation, just clip it in just like a normal seatbelt. Fit perfectly in my 2011 GMC Terrain. Definitely recommend it for anyone who has difficulty fastening their seatbelt.
B003UT0L7A|3|Only 3 star review for pleasant smell and deodorant in product.  Did NOTHING  for stains, even very light food stain
B00M1ZIXH4|3|Kinda small
B00407DMEK|5|as described. Thanks!
B00075XCV2|5|Perfect fit on 1999 Jeep Cherokee XJ.
B0000DYVN9|5|as described. Thanks!
B00MZKFBG6|5|Very happy with the quality and fast shipping.
B000CRER3C|1|piece of junk  as all china made mounts , I bought it for a dodge neon 2002 and lasted 6 months (7000 milles) before that is broke, compared to OEM this has  hard rubber, result: not well absorbs the vibrations of the engine and short duration, OEM rubber is  soft.  go with made in usa mopar mounts cost double but worth every penny, soft rubber = long lasting mount and smooth engine.
B0085KGOIE|4|product was as described works well and was shipped in a reasonable time but I feel they are too expensive for what they are
B000637TE6|5|Just like the conditioner, quality product but again it's Lexol!
B00062ZNXG|5|One of the best air filters on the market, well made and strong, the filter will last a very long time.
B00GXJIZ5Y|5|They verified this one would work for my machine and it worked perfectly.
B00HSMPLNO|3|I ordered three of the lights.  One of them did not work.  I changed the batteries but it seems to have a short or something which is interfering with the operation.  The other two are fine.
B00UEOLXEY|5|These lights are awesome I use them every night on my way home since my jeep lights aren't very bright, and in arkansas we can run lights like this as long as they are below hood height.
B00LG07MZE|4|Helps to keep the interior from overheating. I cut a small slit in the top middle so it could wrap around my rearview mirror.
B00JMVKAQ2|5|Worked and look great ,, Thanks
B006P87216|3|Good looking patch, but can't read what it says. The writing is sloppy...
B00DP68G3Y|5|Super easy to install, great price and look super crisp! Best quality product out there and even better for the price! Instructions and install kit came with the order!
B003021EUU|4|Everything installed like it should worklng great
B001AVX9ME|5|Great product!
B00HQXTU8M|5|These guys ship super fast!!! And even though it's not a smooth surface, it sticks and looks great on my case!!!
B00NX8EYFI|4|I like the decal, I just can't same much right now, as it's been raining and I haven't been able to put it on my car.
B00VVV0BD8|4|Yes, im disappointed but still gave it 4 put of 5 stars. Heres why. I got the package earlier then expected. Its great looking. I just didnt think for $130 and the quality wasnt there. The driver side light wasnt glued properly. Yes its glue. Im not mad at it being glue but just disappointed that id the glue couldnt hold up and i just got it. For $130 compared to $75 for the OEM fog lights, how long you think these will last down the road at high speeds or road grim, or just the sun beating on it. Im not going to give 4 stars to the product but to the support I had when I ordered it and asked to have faster shipping and they did. Will update what they do when i return it. See what they say.
B00ZG3T480|1|Only thing I really liked was that the shipping was very fast within like 2 days I received them, but most of the stickers sucked alot of them were just really were and Asian, I like maybe 4 out of the 100 so I don't recommend, bought a pack from fishins or whatever it was it was a dollar more and the stickers were awesome.
B00F2B80YK|1|Hard to get it to read accurately... sometimes it's good at lower RPMs, sometimes at higher RPMs.  NOT waterproof or even water resistant!!!  I bought two and got one splashed and it stopped working about a week after I got it.
B0061XNZ5W|3|Nice looking but they are sharp and will cut your hands.
B004AIIVUO|5|Fastest delivery ever! Great product and great instructions
B001INN5HI|5|Excellent product and seller.
B006ARYLHA|4|Exactly what I ordered. Not sure I needed to replace these parts but it's nice to have done it anyway.
B00JYKGTNE|5|Perfect fit.  My second Battalion, after accidently melting the sleeve off on my down pipe.  I just cut both sleeves off under the shoulder pads Mad Max style so now I have a Jacket for everyday protection and a vest for when it's really hot.  I must say I get asked a ton of questions about the Mad Max style mod.  The long sleeve Battalion is badass too.  Comfy, not constraining but nice lines with very adequate protection.  Too bad I have to go through another &#34;break in&#34; process to wear of the new shine.
B000630380|5|If you have a missing problem with your f150 or expediton this is a nice easy fix truck runs smother then when it was new no lie thanks
B00029WYEY|5|Great product to renew you filter.
B005GEMT6S|1|Worked great the first time, but went to use again the second time.  Would not work at all.
B00OKK7YEQ|5|Good value
B00LEV4ORO|5|Well built product. Easy to install.
B007KPVPIE|5|I bought a 2.0 kw starter. It was not big enough even after I told the sales guy I needed a 2.4kw. Paid way to much for the other one.  The 2.4kw starter was half the price, and works twice as good. Very happy...
B00F7HD760|1|This is NOT a window sticker. It is printed on one side so that the other side shows a rectangular grey block rather than being double-sided which would show the message on both sides of the glass. Not at all what I expected or advertised.
B007RLPX4S|5|Works flawlessly.
B005LKSGMS|5|Perfect in my 2005 Jeep Wrangler!
B00SS7F3XQ|5|great decals
B000C9N5I8|5|Got the part in Flash time put it in and it worked perfect sold the truck two days later
B00KSDSYAW|5|great value and quality
B00539L3VS|3|Not the original color and neither the correct size. Excelent Quality F250 2001 5.4L XLT Super Crew Cab
B0002SRL20|5|Great gas station quality, good price!
B000RNW5HQ|5|worked good
B00YBGAU2W|5|Perfect for our loungers.
B000COBCF6|3|The good news is that it fits... the bad news is that I had to beat the hell out of it with a hammer to make it possible....<br /><br />I say *it* because only one was able to be (forcibly) installed. The metal bit on the driver side is completely broken.<br /><br />Despite having to swear like a sailor while mercilessly pounding on this handle to get it to fit, it is now on the seat and is holding.<br /><br />This was installed on a 2000 Chevrolet Blazer
B000B8U61O|5|Replaced the original vent perfectly. Amazing how little details such as replacing yellowed (and brittle) plastics like this really updates the RV.
B0090NQQ2Y|5|Fits great.  Looks great. OEM part.  Purchased for my mother's car.  Transmission went out a week later.  Oh well.
B0031GWM7O|5|It's great  love it,
B000HE6H6K|5|Works great for mounting electric fans to radiator
B004XG3PEA|5|Worked perfect for our Jeep when we went to larger tires.
B00L361DBK|3|I bought these for the lights on my towed vehicle.  Good thing the lights are LED's and only require 0.9 amps/circuit because the wires are 20 AWG and only rated at 1.5 amps.  OD of the insulation is ~2.5 mm, wire is ~0.85 OD.  I was expecting 2.5 mm wire.
B00SDKP1LM|5|Great arrive here on time
B00HJDUNWQ|5|not as bright as I thought. returned
B00YE5Q132|5|Tried several Portable Car Jump Batteries, one which I returned. My sole purpose was first to find one that was Cheaper than the Pocket Power that is advertised on the Blaze. I then wanted a unit that not only could charge but operate a 19 volt Laptop PC for at least two hours. Finally it had to Jump start any of my cars or my lawn tractor. I have 6 acres and 4 of them is a considerable ways from the house and hard to reach even with a car. This unit not only met all my criteria it exceeded it. It also had a USB port that could support any of the smart phones out there and it had 16 volts for apple devices. All in all this system works well, it also has a very nice case that will hold up to a fair amount of abuse in the car. On top of all this it was delivered in a very timely manner.
B000WJFDVA|5|Great price, good power!
B00A2A1SF4|5|Purchased for my Pontiac G8 Base that had a damaged driver window button. The original control for my car is a dark grey-silver, whereas this is black. It is noticeable, but barely, and not something that I'm going to be worried about. I'm glad that my driver window works again!
B00NF0KIOA|4|It's super bright and looks amazing the only thing was it didn't fit exactly into the slot for a 2014 Toyota Camry le had to shove it in a little bit and still didn't go all the way in but it still works like this and looks amazing regardless
B00QK56EXQ|5|Exactly as described. Outstanding transaction.
B006HGA7VS|5|Ok,,Im like WOW! This is a fantastic soft top for the money! Looks GREAT,,Fits GREAT! Made my Jeep a head turner for sure!
B00BFDH2Y8|2|The color was a poor match.  This was the cheapest touch up paint I could find, so I'm not surprised.  I was hopeful it would be a good match though.
B009XQKCQY|5|Good product, compact design.
B001G4Z5J0|4|Too heavy. But does the job.
B00718VZ8A|5|Thumbs up
B00Q34EQ0W|3|I replaced a nice cover I had for about 4yrs, but this one was about half the diameter of my old one. It looks good, but I wonder how much protection this adds as opposed to looks. I'm a hunter so I like it, but its nothing special. Sometimes seeing & feeling it in the store first is better.
B0060A7YU8|4|Fit perfectly.
B005K896FW|4|My husband purchased this item to use when riding his quad, for wrist support.  It works!
B00G66KNZY|5|This is a better helmet than my Shoei which cost 4x as much.  I love the ratcheting chin-strap.
B000QIH3C4|5|works great now my car don't run hot any more.
B00PV6T586|5|Lights look great and are amazingly bright! Thanks!!
B00URDC26U|5|Great
B00CZVQPY2|5|Excellent product
B00S4HFNXK|4|These work great in any situation where your boat and another object will not be continually rubbing passed in another. Round fenders simply rub past one another, while these are for direct contact. For example these work great when attached to a permanently parking dock. I just screwed them to the dock and voila, effective bumpers. We also tried to use them while hooking two boats together, but I don't think they would last long in this situation. Overall, a great product for the right circumstance.
B000XLXWQ0|5|Great Bag
B002YIACG8|5|The best I have used.  I have had to really slam on the breaks because some idiot pulled out in front of me.  I was going about 55 and the trailer was steady as a rock not lock-up or swaying.  Easy to install using the truck specific harness (sold separately)
B00HR8MDHG|5|They were what I was looking for...  nice fit..  looks good...  fast and easy buy. tks..
B00332GPRO|3|Miscut, material hanging off edges, not even fabrication would help. Probably just a one-off defective product.
B00BMRZN66|5|I use it to transfer gasoline to my boat and avoid Marina markup. It works great
B004TBOGPG|5|Works great
B004ASWEGQ|5|These were needed for a repair and they were the ticket for the job Great product
B00TKO0J6C|5|I rarely write reviews but felt compelled to do this one.  Came in fairly short order for free shipping.  Bought it as a third for my pop up camper because it was too dim.  Decided to order two more and retrofit the camper with only these.  So much brighter and uses about 1/3 the power of the original 1141 bulbs.  Really like the color also.  It is somewhere between the yellow light the old bulbs had but not the stark white of the bright white.
B002NETMZU|3|This is not compatible with my 02 Tacoma Pre-runner 4 door.  After getting ready to put them on I called Monroe about the bearing plate and they told me not to install them that they are not rated for the weight of the crew cab Tacoma.<br /><br />Go to their website and plug your vehicle info in prior to buying and make sure they are listed as an option for your specific year, make, model, and body style.
B001C6Q8H0|5|Perfect fit, comes with everything you need to install except maybe a few zip ties.
B00CHDHAI8|3|Totally happy. Great transaction.
B00262Y1OQ|4|good
B000F3RYGA|4|Works great!
B00DJ2D45O|4|I have a 2009 Toyota Corolla S with all original 4D chip keys (2 remote button + 1 valet) that did work.  [The valet key does not have the remote door lock buttons on side.  The valet key operates ignition and door but not trunk lock.]  I preferred to carry the valet key on my overcrowded key ring to avoid damaging the remote control buttons on the side of the other two keys.  I was trying to add two  more keys similar to the valet key that would operate everything but after using this device, I could only get a max of any two keys to work and it made no difference if either or both were original or new.  Good Part-- You can program any two keys with 4D chip.  Not so good part-- I can only program max of 2 keys.  The good news is if you have only one non-programmed 4D key that will turn in the ignition but won't start car, this device will actually program that key plus a second key.  Note:  If key is not programmed but will turn the ignition, the engine will turn over but will not start.--  Event Log: I followed the original instructions first to add the new keys.  The first new key added but not the second.  Then I discovered only the one original key and the added new key worked but not the other two originals.  I started reading and looking online.  I know that if you have one original key, this device will copy it using enclosed instructions.  But I am not sure why they say you MUST have the original key to use this device since I could wipe out all keys so that none would start car, then  USING THE LITTLE BUTTON ON SIDE OF THIS DEVICE per instructions I found, pick any two keys and you can reprogram those two but not more.  I found various sets of additional instructions online but none worked to my complete satisfaction.  I tried to follow each set of instructions I found online, etc, but 2 keys max.  I realize I probably was not understanding exact procedure(s) in some cases but there were many variations given to exact steps and sequences given.  If you aredown to only one (or none) programmed keys that will turn iginition but not start the car, this device is highly recommended.  If you have two or more working keys, I would only advise buying this ONLY as insurance should you lose one of your keys at a future date.  DO NOT USE THE LITTLE WHITE BUTTON on side if you are simply adding one key where you have an original key.  The white button apparently erases the matchup of key chips to car computer and then allows you to add up to a max of TWO new and/or original keys.  I am no expert and if anyone has a solution or corrections, please feel free to let me know.  jmiller2414@gmail.com.

B00K7935KQ|5|Simple design, durable material, looks good on both our cars.
B000C9FSSI|5|These hoses work exactly like they're supposed to.  They arrived in excellent condition and I'm satisfied with the product.<br /><br />However this product does not come with the slimline seal washers that mount between this hose and the compressor block.  I ended up using my original ones but now I'm wishing I would have found two new ones.  I found a TSB that states not to double up washers or lubricate these like o-rings.
B003YLYQJI|5|Awesome
B006JZ05RS|5|awesome
B00POG2XPU|1|Update 3/30/16: These tire caps have yellowed and I have removed them from the vehicle.  They looked great but lasted only a few months on a car that is not daily driven and garage kept the majority of the time.  These look great on the truck and seem to be high quality.  I will update this review should there be any durability issues.  As of now they have only been on my f150 about 2 weeks.  I'm happy with the purchase
B007ZLLBDW|5|awesome
B00GYI1YCK|5|am very happy with these mats
B000W0RQ8C|5|It's a Receiver hitch locking pin. It does what it's supposed to do, keeps scumbags from stealing my balls.
B00HX1ZY7I|5|... I haven't put the car on the dyno, but I'm pretty sure I haven't seen any improvements in power, handling or mileage since installing these new &#34;high performance&#34; key gloves.<br /><br />but they do make my keys look better!  :-)
B00LNJI1KI|5|Yes very satisfied well worth the money
B007N3RW9Y|5|Great deal seems to be working good
B00EIIH6PC|2|Didn't work to well for me, ended up using both kit for one bullseye chip on my windshield and I can still see where it was at
B000BUU5WW|5|works great would buy again
B002OW4ADA|5|very well made product. installed into my food truck using the supplied fittings and additionally purchased hose. the seals are excellent and i expect this to last quite a while
B004BXKQLU|5|I bought Michelin wipers because I love Michelin tires. I've had it with expensive wiper blades that get stiff and streaky and only last at best one year.  These are absolutely the best wiper blades made.  I put a set on my 2013 Ram 1500 a year and a half ago.  With two winters on these Michelin wiper blades they're still flexible and quiet.  They don't streak either.  I bought a second set thinking I would need them soon but I haven't needed them because the original pair keep working great.
B000SXCLIS|5|Love it!!
B00DGRRRGY|3|Great calipers and brakes but wrong part number on the selling dealers website.  Should have ordered the S5054 for a 2013 Ram 1500.  I had to return both because the repair shop was already installing the brakes.  It did cost me to return both front and rear calipers which I didn't think was my fault.  I will go to the manufacturer's web site next time.
B00B36CL8Y|5|Great , covered well & dried fast.
B00UKSGAYC|5|My 1976 Chevy instument gauges are brighter and clearer than ever. Much easier to read than with incandescent bulbs.
B000QUZ6TO|2|works for 8 months then the engine light comes on, had to buy the better keyed gas cap by Stant to pass smog.
B000CGMMP8|5|if worked well
B00B6FBLFG|5|Product works great, left my LV looking beautiful again.
B00B9ROFPO|5|These are fun.  I put them on my motorcycle tires.  Look pretty cool at night.  They work great.
B000GVGJA8|5|Great sound, easy install. Needed to have adapters made but that was really cheap, everything else went together perfectly.
B001UEFEEM|5|Worked well and stopped the misfire on cylinder one that I was having.  The car runs like new.
B0041CDYEM|5|Great addition for summer rides. Keeps air out of your eyes allowing the wind in your face. I would not recommend this product if your nose is on the large size. It will rub against the shield.
B00COYNZJ8|5|I chuckle to myself every time I use this thing. It is a bit small for my Toyota Sienna but should work fine for anything smaller. looks awesome when you come back to your car as well.
B0080MXQFQ|2|Fell off after 3 weeks. Lost again.
B002Q14TM6|5|Goog quality!
B0009XQUKW|5|Worked like a charm. Used on a 1953 MG TD where the starter switch was completely destroyed. Was able to feed wire through the firewall and use.
B00450KLKA|3|I like it but I hoped the material would be more quality. It's very thin and cheap.
B00Z515O5K|5|Lovely sellers! Cables are very nice, and the eBook was very helpful to a newcomer!
B00RW8HRV8|5|Omg these are amazing! Like wearing slippers or socks! And a bonus they don't have to be laced...this is a quality item. Well made and comfortable. Just good stuff.
B00H36XX6C|5|This portable battery charger gives me the ability to recharge any USB device including our family’s smartphones and it comes with a flashlight so I can find a device port in the dark.  It is five stars because of this flexibility and because it works. The quality and intensity of the light is better than any of my old ones. The charger works fast on my iPhone. The size is just right, small enough for my bag or my pocket but big enough to handle easily. I am disappointed there is no indicator to tell me how much charging power is left in the device but xGrid sells a solar charger so I can charge on the road.  You just cannot charge and use at the same time.  It is so small and portable it is easy to carry with me in my briefcase or backpack.<br /><br />The shock case has a nice feel to it. It seems rugged and durable.
B001BELZ9E|5|Easy to install, excellent quality
B00PZ5A4B0|5|Worked great
B00D9BFR8M|5|better than the last one I owned!  fits my bike perfectly!!

B00EJOT6A8|5|great
B00ELPTR2W|4|Nice sound
B003FNXNCQ|5|Not much to say here, there valve caps... But they are red, and look good.
B003CR2ILM|1|First of all, this is my first time ever writing a review and unfortionaly it's BAD! I purchased this product for my 2010 Ram 1500 with the 5.7 hemi and when I received the box looked like it had been thrown out of a plane. When I began the installation process I noticed the instructions were horrible and had to refer to YouTube for better assistance. Lastly, the box did not have all the necessary hardware to complete in the installation so I was forced to reinstall the original air box and call k&n to have the missing hardware shipped to me...
B00F7NEREU|5|A good compromise for back and seat cooling - especially for narrow bucket seats.
B002UD0GFE|5|Works Great on my Memphis Bat Wing and Windshield.
B00LMH6KA4|5|I'm so glad I purchased this item. Ordering it was easy and It was delivered fast. Works great. Thank you

B00H1ID9AC|5|Perfect fit, good quality
B000UIMUWI|5|Perfect for any cardinals fan.
B00I9GTZBW|5|Perfect -
B00YI3IGA6|3|This works very well on keeping the sun of baby, BUT causes huge blind spots when looking over your shoulder to switch lanes, can be dangerous.
B005JMY1TK|3|quality leather shift knob, but I am not a fan of the universal style mounting.  It uses set screws instead of an adapter system like higher quality shift knobs.  It is also a little light for my taste.  If you are looking for something to match your Nardi wheel, this is perfect though.
B000I04Z7Q|5|30 min install. Works great and kids love it! I put them in my van I use for Uber!
B000WJEY8S|5|Just what I needed.  Piece of cake to install and is doing just what I wanted it to do.  Now I will know when to maintain my log splitter.
B00QSESJEQ|2|This handle fits perfect and is easy to install Update 12/22/2015... This handle broke about a week ago, not a deal at any price considering it only lasted about 6 months!
B00W63X0LA|5|Good product, great delivery time.
B009RC2HVC|5|My husband bought this for his truck, put it on and have never had any problems.  Very satisfied.
B000BMWXZM|5|Super Awesome
B000AAM2Z6|5|works
B00A01DD4Y|5|Great item fit a and works perfectly
B000QIN7Y2|3|No problems
B007TD1WIK|4|I was hoping for a true heavy duty pair of jumper cables and the package is clearly marked medium duty
B001FMGHCW|2|They say thermoquiet. They are the noisiest brakes I have ever installed. Very squeaky when cold. More so when backing up.
B003TZYMRK|5|Fits nicely and makes throttle control so much easier!! 08 drz400sm.
B00UEC87QS|5|These grill inserts are a great enhancement to your jeep. They are easy to install and the 3M tape will hold them in place without a problem. The grill inserts feels pretty sturdy too. You will be pleasantly surprised.
B005JUWZ3Q|5|Feels nice and light. Great helmet for autocross
B000EARXBK|5|as expected
B000M0FJ3G|1|its not the set.....its only on wrench...false picture
B0024GIWDK|4|Ordered for my wife when she rides with me. Big mushroom look but she is more concerned with padding than looks.
B00MWLDV24|4|Great license bracket. It does get dirty quickly and can be difficult to read. I wish it came in brighter colors!
B00COYP3H0|5|These are great and match the yellow ones one can get at Camping World.  Same pattern so they are 100% interchangeable.  That is very important.
B000GU3EB6|5|They fit perfectly over my glasses and saved me $400 for prescription biker glasses. Very happy
B00ECKI4WA|5|I have only used this product a few times but I was impressed with it. For the last couple of months I have been spraying weeds, with a bright blue dye added to the chemical. This dye does NOT want to come off of your skin. I wash with bar soap several times, along with a scrub pad and it barely fazes the dye. This cleaner doesn't take it all right off, but it sure works better than anything else I have tried. I grabbed a bottle of citrus cleaner one day at work and it seemed to work pretty well, that's the only other stuff I've came across that made a dent in this dye. I will order more of this hand cleaner.
B00RV83UUG|5|Nice light. I bought 2 of them. I used one as a drop light to work on vehicles. I  attached magnets via epoxy and attach it under the hood. The other one is mounted on my tractor ROPS.
B00NFSNAS8|1|terrible - used it twice overheated and now wont work -  never again
B00HYKJRZ8|5|The color was exact and the clear coat went on wonderfully. Item was delivered in two days.
B000EQ80NE|4|After putting Reflex Monotubes on all corners of my 04 Sub, I realize just how poor it was handling before! No more chattering down the highway, swaying around corners, and nose diving at stops. I had Bielsteins on it before, and they didn't seem to last long. I only gave these 4 stars because they are new- let's see how long they last.
B0018CWGS8|5|I have little experience with tunning programs, but this one is supper easy to use. Jet has a great product.
B00AFVCMG4|4|German company, filter made in Germany. Was surprised it fits Highlander 2010 SE, but it perfectly did.<br /><br />More filtering surface compare to another filter I had, replaced after 14K miles.<br /><br />One star off for price (rather expensive compared to other options on the market), otherwise great option.
B00KL3ALGO|5|I absolutely love these shades. They are durable, functional and practical. They are the only shades, and I've tried many, that actually stick to the window and cover enough of the window to shade my babies from the sun. Thank you for making such an amazing product!
B00JJVBQV8|5|Just used this carrier for an 11 day trip. A lot of driving, some on very rough roads. Held up great. Not a single problem. Used to carry luggage in a carrier bag. Great carrier and great price!
B009N9O7N0|5|Just as promised and on time!!
B007PBPI68|5|Bigger and brighter than expected. Used them as rock lights on my jeep. Lens is 3/4 diameter
B00IQNMVWS|1|Not at all what I expected
B00DQQOEJ8|2|Didn't fit well - kinda big and clunky.  Goggles looked real cheap.  Wouldn't recommend unless you just want the &#34;look&#34;.  Functionally, it was ok though.
B006K8GPHI|5|Great product. Seamless transaction.
B000L7JQMU|5|Had 1  more make it way easier
B0002L2MMG|5|Works great. Used it instead of the stock mic that came with my radio and it works 100 times better
B00PMN7PJO|4|Granddaughter loves this.
B000E301B6|5|Exact replacement
B001GC2LVM|5|These are very slick... I don't have any concerns when leveling my trailer it is very easy to use.  I have a 31 foot trailer with the axels flipped for clearnce and i have found nthat A second leveler is needed on steeper/uneaven rv spots. I plan on ordering a second leveler.
B001Y8NF90|5|I use this to help secure our awning. Whether the awning is up all the way, tipped on one side or lowered I use this to prevent wind uplift from damaging our awning. Easy to install and adjust.
B001QU9BPS|5|Fsat shipping. Excellent product
B0009IQZH0|5|Nice, soft towels. Would recommend them.
B001FDTFJI|5|I just installed this in my saturn vue. My process was to remove the fuel filter fuse from the fuse box, run the car until the engine quit on its own (to depressurize the fuel system), jack the car up a little to get easier access underneath, remove the bracket securing the fuel filter with a combination wrench, detach the fuel line to the engine from the fuel filter, catch the fuel from the fuel line and from the fuel passing through the filter in a large pan, wait until the fuel stopped flowing (about an 1/8 of a gallon), detach the fuel lines to the filter, remove the old filter, place the new filter in the bracket FIRST, then attach the fuel lines appropriately. Then place the fuse back in its appropriate slot, start the car and call it a day.<br /><br />This was my first time changing the fuel filter, but I figured if it only cost about 18 bucks for a replacement filter and I was quoted at around $100 for parts and labor, so I gave it a shot.  I was slow and confused at times when trying to remove the filter and fuel lines, but in hindsight the process wasn't terribly difficult.  If you have a saturn vue use this link to help you remove the fuel lines http://www.f150online.com/forums/articles-how-s/423975-07-xlt-fuel-filter-change-red-clip.html
B0055AW0N0|5|Worked great.  Just what I was looking for.  Great price, quick shipping.  Couldn't ask for more
B009ANV81S|5|Great plug! Easy installation and always stays waterproof.
B003AT4AM2|5|Excellent quality.  Perfect.
B00HG2UEBA|3|Feels cheaply made and bends a lot if you actually try to use it as a step, but it does protect the bumper so...
B00GD4NZ36|5|Its been more than 7 months...Still holding strong.
B001NCHVK6|5|Amazingly this product works!  Got me safely home from work one day.  I was not even able to get out of the parking lot until I put these on.  Well worth it
B007JSGR9Y|5|saved more than the purchase price the first use
B007N6PKQ8|5|You have to love Bilsteins. Always worth the extra dough. Make my old truck better than new.
B00D3O5LUO|5|This battery was a perfect direct replacement for my Generac XG7000E generator.  It fit perfectly and there were no battery terminal issues or anything.  Didn't have to make any adjustments at all.
B00I1KMO5K|5|Has worked perfectly on my 2008 CBR 600 for the past year. Great battery at a great price.
B004SK5I46|5|simple fix to a $60k BMW that didn't have any coolant temp readouts.
B001GDMES6|5|Very good quality and fit
B00ZR237SI|5|Cute license plate cover!
B00HS5NHU0|5|Great value.<br />This was well worth the $. For 90 minutes of labor I saved about $600 over having the brakes replaced at the dealer.  So for the brakes have worked without trouble and I have even noticed increased braking power.
B00029WYBM|5|Great Product!  I would not have had to buy it for a couple years (or more) had I read the instructions on the K & N filter I had just purchased.<br />I installed new K& N Filter, took a road trip to Oregon (from Cali) and decided to wash the filter after returning from road trip (hit a lot of dusty areas).<br />So, I decided to wash the filter, which was not very dirty and re-installed.  Then I read further and found that you wash their filters (cold air intake- they do make cabin filter also) After 50 Thousand Miles.  Once you wash, it is then good to spray the filter with their oil, which is instrumental in trapping some particles, and re-install.  So, I washed out the oils from a perfectly good filter way to early.  That is why I bought the can to re-insert the oils.
B007TZAV9E|1|The sort of work. I was able to use six out of ten. They hook up correctly but they are made about 45 degrees off. When you thread your bolt through the hole, the top hits the fuel rail and you cannot plug them in, therefore; almost worthless on the back half of a 6.8 gas excursion. The new one is on the left of the picture.
B001FCMSU2|3|Received a VERY damaged product and didn't even fit the vehicle. However, their customer service is SUPERB!
B00099C9QU|3|Works okay, better than the cheap stuff, but not consistent through empty.
B001KQ3JOM|5|Cheap and install is very easy.
B004IA4OX2|5|Good door handle, the fit was perfect, easy install
B00V5B3PT6|2|Ahh idk, I didn't like it because it's bigger than the housing on the S wheel. It didn't fit on my F10 and u can tell that there's a gap where I did stick it because it's bigger than the little housing around the BMW logo. The sticking material isn't really good cuz it doesn't stick very well.
B004HE0B8Q|5|Good quality. good stopping power. Quiet operation.
B00BUS3AKS|5|Exactly what we need. very good price.
B00FQ0ROZS|5|Great product. Awesome shipping
B00QUNSWGU|4|like it!
B00BGDWTOK|5|GREAT Tool,  I broke a break-over bar and a 36mm socket trying to get the nut off.  Within fifteen minutes of the tool's arrival, I had the nut off.  I did have to use an 8-lb sledge to do it though.
B001IWDTVQ|5|Purchased for my Pontiac G8 Base. It fit perfectly and works great.
B00VJ4LHUS|4|This is a great way to keep trash from cluttering in your car. The only issue is there is no way to tie the bottom down so it kind of flaps when you stop and go.
B000BZGHFG|5|awesome
B001L9ZBZS|4|great....
B002XM5G70|4|Easy installation came of all the parts I needed works great
B00HYKZL1W|1|Did not fit my jeep seat belt, it would attach to the lower portion, but the shoulder strap portion was to big to fit in the slot.
B000FW7VH8|5|What great stuff! I keep a bottle of this in the back of my truck to degrease my hands, and it works great! Smells nice, too.<br /><br />I also keep a bottle out of the sun on my potting bench in the yard ... great for quick cleanups after getting your hands dirty doing yard chores.<br /><br />A great product with lots of uses -- recommended without reservation!
B001QGFWNM|5|Great product. I only installed one in the front and one in the back and they work great. Now I have replacements.
B005R4L1DE|5|I recently purchased this product and I love em they look great but I would suggest getting some leds for the reverse lights and tail lights
B009KP77WU|1|Meticulously installed this and it worked perfectly - the first time... Then the bad news - It hasn't worked right since. All lights now remain on all the time. even if the key is out of my Jeep, the lights are still on! Curt has little to no customer support and since I passed the 30 day return window on Amazon, I am pretty much helpless. I strongly suggest spending a few extra dollars and going with the Mopar made system ( http://www.moparonlineparts.com/docs/82209280AD.pdf ) which takes an entirely different approach (with no electronic converter) to provide reliable trailer lighting.
B00E7G46X0|5|Awesome! Took a link bit of re-aligning to get them to fit. Other than that they are the best on the market in my opinion.
B0012NI7SQ|2|Im sorry is to wide to me... difficult when I try to make a loop.
B000GTYLU0|5|Easy to install and works perfect on my 2005 honda cbr600rr
B00RYPYNVG|2|Was not able to get use these without puncturing the tube.  I like that they have smooth ends and chrome coating.  They did hold up to a lot of pressure without bending.  However, the design, and this may go for the size of the tire and tube that I am using this for, but when I get close prying the tire on fully using high pressure, the ends of these where they have a slight bend slip too far into the tire and grab the tube and cause a puncture.  I am looking for something else that hooks to the rim without sliding too far inside the tire.  For tubeless tires I don't see any issue with these.
B0077T23EI|5|From the design and price compared to the $200 plus stands I admit I was a little leary but it works like a charm. My 15 street glide feels locked in and completely stable. Makes changing fluids a breeze and adjusting highways pegs way easier.
B00XRIJIGO|4|Done the job and I could see them in the dark...
B00L81T4G6|5|It was what I expected easy to install haven't had long enough to give it a good test but so far very satisfied
B00BYWX4X8|5|Looks awesome
B000BQUEWC|5|organized finally
B00PGJDZCU|5|Perfect!
B0006GF5SK|5|Very easy to use and never smell unpleasant odors in the bathroom.
B0041CDPQO|5|Works great with the battery trickle...just have some plastic ties to complete the job.
B00JCE0XJS|1|picture shows pocket  company bought from  said picture was wrong does not come eith one false addvertisment
B00QOJW62Q|5|These are 100 times better then the polaris brand ones, i had them and threw them in the trash and tried these, glad i did, they hold way better.
B00DJ5KE9A|5|Works perfect to check battery voltage between camping trips
B002MQOXGW|5|Works great. Love the bleed down button.
B00514ARU8|5|Really improved the look of the bike. Excellent installation instructions, and easier than expected.
B00RIV1H42|5|Quick shipping. Good quality and fits my x3 perfectly. The included screws (4 for the license plate, 2 for the bracket) and the tool is a nice touch. The bracket also has cushions where it rests on the body.
B004C6EKOK|3|I ordered this for my V-Star 950T.  I asked many questions about how it mounted, and everyone said it bolts on using your windshield bolts. Not for my bike - there are no center bolts.  Because this item's description photo only shows one view, I've included a photo of the back of it here, along with a photo of my windshield.  Perhaps it will help someone else.<br /><br />This bag is nicely made and large, but it doesn't fit my bike. Returned.
B00VURO72Y|5|GREAT
B004I8SF5M|5|They look great, worke great, just having a little trouble adjusting them
B00U224GH4|2|It sticks, and you have to force it, not the best quality
B000IYN56O|5|Fits like a glove in my 99 superduty
B00JREPRJE|5|Just what I wanted fit 2015 Prius
B0012J3T7O|5|Great product, doesn't leave a film if you use it as directed and my husband loves it for the windshield.
B00A2DWD7S|5|This fits over my motor home perfectly. It provides great protection from all weather conditions. Based on the sturdy material I am expecting it to last for a few years.
B001NAUAXI|3|No o-ring supplied and K&N chat line says none was intended.  5-star product and 1-star customer service so I give them 3 stars.  How disappointing.  :-(
B00NUKY74C|5|It was an exact match for our RV!
B00UIV39FO|4|Works, easy to install. I used the adhesive so far so good.
B000C9CBT2|5|Great product fast shipping
B000SKYL9I|5|I've been using this brand of oil for my 2012 Honda Civic LX (manual) for four years now (June 2011 - August 2015). I change my oil/oil filter (K&N HP 1010) between 5k to 8k miles. Does it affect performance? Probably, but it's probably very slight difference since I've yet to see an impact since I bought my car. It definitely does not have adverse effects, since my car's running fine since 2011. Would highly recommend.
B000E0R7WU|4|THERE'S NOTHING LIKE A PERFECT FIT!
B00HY07GBK|5|Really cool effect in my 2014 toyota corolla S, easy installation, not too bright but not too sim either, its perfect in my opinion
B00GHSLYN6|4|good to 80%; accessories given along did not fit perfectly; the DIY manual served its purpose
B004A2BBOI|5|Ford parts great price
B00ZB7U9WQ|1|Didn't work at all
B008J20R1S|5|Used this stuff to cover the foam and duct tape I used to raise the comb on the buttstock of my rifle. So far so good and if any of it gets damaged I can just spray more on.
B00017YYI6|5|Perfect, just what we needed, we did not install, but rather had one of their authorized dealers install it.
B0032H30EQ|5|fits my 2003 toyota tundra perfectly
B00FDW57VC|5|Fit perfect and looks better...
B00873J0YY|4|Ordered these J Bar hooks to use on our Thule roof rack and they fit well, although we probably will get some longer screws as they are just not quite long enough.  The first time we used the hooks with our kayaks, the side handle of our Wilderness Tarpon 100s caused the cheap foam surround on the hooks to tear.  We had read about that in the reviews and expected that, but otherwise the hooks seem to be well made and do the job as intended.  We will buy some kind of tape or other material to wrap around the hooks for padding.  Our kayaks have been on the roof of our truck for about 2 weeks and the J hooks seem to be doing a good job.  Would recommend these to anyone needing this type of method for transporting two kayaks on the roof of a vehicle.
B00W8LQUDK|1|No I ordered the insert ones and I received the outside stick on ones. Not happy
B00U868BN4|4|Had a slight odor in my car from new polyurethane floor mats, as well as a slight damp musty smell from carting around a golf bag that had gotten damp. Odors seemed to clear up within a few minutes of being plugged in.  Was also pretty impressed when following a smoky diesel...didn't even smell it with the A/C blasting.<br />Not sure about battery drainage- my car turns off the 12V port when the car is off. This product also creates ozone-so not sure if there are potential health risks from long term use.  I only plug it in when I notice an odor and leave it out otherwise.
B00TFZOHBO|5|I ordered the wrong size and they had no problems switching it out for me. Thanks again it looks great.
B000GZIWV8|5|Installed them on my 99 roadie.  Worked like a champ and mounted in factory housing with very little modification (see youtube for numerous videos on how to install them.
B000RXKR6M|5|Fantastic microfiber car washing mitt. Fabric has a nice density so it holds just enough water to get the car clean.
B00GZIR3QU|5|Mounted these on my boat.  Worked like a champ.  Will order more for my Jeep.
B000PR148A|3|Very thin fabric.
B00E4J5382|1|The product had scratches on it that had been touched up with a different color black - not very good quality control - the brackets did not fit well would not recommend this product
B0012TUTQ8|5|These grips make long-distance riding much easier.  Especially for someone like me, who has arthritis in my hands.  I have used them on every bike I have owned since I first tried them.  No other grips worked better than these.
B001Y8NDM4|4|Has lasted us 3 years so far. I wish it was bigger but it serves the purpose
B00YV5FF32|5|i love being organized and this works perfect. I can find everything i need in one packet.
B000C2E6QK|5|I haven't  used it yet but its the right one A+  thank you
B00LRUAGII|4|Fast shipping, works as expected!<br /><br />Thanks!
B002L9D6YK|5|Works as advertised.  Installed on my motorhome.  Takes a little bit to install but once you have them on, it makes checking air pressure so much easier.  Make sure you have steel valve stems and tighten them very tightly.  I have not had any trouble with air leaks after extended road trips or during storage
B003LZPNG2|5|awesome
B00E9GOL4M|5|excelente
B00B9FEJAM|2|For 10$ this would have been a great fix but this remote as it turns out will not work with decommissioned Crown Victoria Interceptors. I guess I'll just stick to keyed entry after all.
B009GQKV4E|5|Great sticker and you cant go wrong with the price either. I have it on the back of my laptop and it looks fantastic.
B00MZ1NAT0|5|Love it, it protect my key
B0002KR88A|4|as described. Thanks!
B000C9O80M|5|Runs smoother  Quick response
B003NHF5KM|4|Great shocks. The down fall is that glass window has to be held really firm otherwise window can be open too fast that can hit you or even can break the window. Soo far good.
B00XL70YKA|5|Great for ATV. Lights up the trail as expected.
B00BJ7YUI6|5|These products are a life saver!!!<br />Felt pretty skeptical about these with all the reviews left from people but after I bought them and took the risk must say it was worth it!.<br />They fit perfectly on my 97 Ford F-150!. I installed them about 3 weeks ago and they have not fallen off or broken they stayed out with a strong hold!.<br />The size of the bolts that I have is 12mml/75 for anyone who was wondering and reading my review thanks!.
B00P99KKAM|5|Best steering wheel cover have ever had. Wish more colors were available but the feel and construction is excellent.
B0034ZNZBY|5|excellent grips if you ride with your brake lever covered and you blip shift, if you don't any grip will work
B00MQ5Z5F2|5|Exactly what I needed and wanted. I transport cars and almost daily I have a dead battery on something. No more toting around heavy jumpboxes that take up a lot of room in the truck. No jumper cables and rounding a car to use for a jump. I have jumped 12 cars and just now had to recharge this unit. Did I say I love it? Well I do.
B0019BSGTQ|4|I ordered this with a new shift knob and I had some trouble fitting this with the new knob because of how thick the metal ring at the top of the boot is. It looks nice though! No real complaints, just didn't know it was gonna be so hard to get it on with the aftermarket knob.
B005H13ZK4|5|Nice fit real good quality thanks
B000CL9IH8|5|It fit perfectly in a 2003 Jeep Wrangler sport 4.0
B00682RIAY|5|As a gunsmith, I use this set, along with other screwdrivers, in my work. (We can never have enough tools)<br />I have a set of these that my father used in the 70's when he was gunsmithing. They have a great warranty program through the factory.<br />Well worth the money.
B0077BTEBG|5|The wing is great! Just as described! I've had problems putting it on (about $400 worth) because I'm stupid and didn't realize that if your challenger has a factory low pro wing on it then you have to have the mounting holes filled and have the trunk repainted because this obviously has two mounting posts where the factory one has five! Didn't know that before but it doesn't take away from the fact that this wing is perfect! Hope this helps someone!
B004LF14Q4|5|Worked great. Fast delivery.
B001C3MFFC|5|very nice bags.. dropped them on the wifes Nightster 1200 ... SWEET
B001O0U05K|1|Make more noise then my worn out (completely) OEM Honda pads. Replaced all front and rear, as well as new rotors all around. No excuse to have brand new everything, and pads out the box that soynd like they have 200k on them! Garbage!!
B002IV3GT6|5|Works great on my boat.
B003YLMPPA|5|Jeep wanted to charge anywhere from $250-$400 to install this part.  Took under 30 minutes without the correct tools to install it.  Huge money saver.  Packed well and in great shape.
B0080HJL7S|5|Wow I'm impressed with the quality of this car trash bag. It's made kind of like a cooler lunch bag. Has a nice thick outside and thick soft plastic inside. It has metal bars sewn in the top rim so it keeps it's shape. The top will fold shut and it seals with Velcro. The strap the fastens to the headrest is strong and long enough. It should be easy to dump out because it holds it's shape so well. This should last a long time even in the intense heat of the south. I received this in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.
B00HHGSIV8|5|They are good
B00002N57X|5|Fit perfect works perfect!
B00LMGG7JO|4|Came fast and with everything described . only bad thing  the chain and the cdi could be better quality but over all great product . runs great and fast
B00K72C1T4|5|Plug & Play just like it stated. Directions were right on target  for my 2010 goldwing. The hardest part of the project was trying to find room to stuff the extra wiring out of the way so the rear cover plate would fit back on.
B00099BJUC|3|Good product but hard to get it consistent for a perfect coverage
B00E1D4HUQ|5|Great quality. Fit and finish, perfect.
B000C5602U|5|Worked out very well , great product.
B00KCCLEOW|5|Fit great, look great!
B007ZSZJ42|5|Very satisfied thank you very much
B006G2MJZU|5|My son bought these first 2007 Chevy Silverado truck and they worked perfectly for the first time.
B009OBVRY4|5|This is a great item I love it a lot, I'm going to buy one for my son. Then I will upgrade mine.
B00T1BWVCE|5|quite a statement, heavy metal frame. Will last a long time.
B00425AVHQ|5|I've had this jacket for a few months and I have to say this is the best jacket I've purchased over the years. I'm 6' tall and have longer arms and I am on the skinnier side but the sleeves don't ride up on me and the jacket fits really well and not super loose. I purchased a Large. The zip out liner is nice for those colder days and there's plenty of pockets to store things. I've been riding with the liner out on these hot summer days and it stays pretty comfortable and cool. It's got thumb hooks on the sleeves so it won't ride up in the event of a crash, the pads are super nice and barely noticeable, they form really well to your body. It's also got a pocket to put an Ipod or something in with a little hole to slip your headphones through and a little stretchy loop near the collar so your headphone cord won't be whipping in the wind! Also Icon puts a little good luck charm in all there jackets which is a small little detail but shows the company is looking out for there riders and is just a good gesture to their customers. Couldn't be happier with this purchase!
B000C9J3B6|4|They stop the car No  squeaks
B00D6N0VW0|5|This worked like a dream. I did not use the crimp connector i soldered mine.
B005CHT4W6|5|While the bottle is not as it looks in the picture, it comes with the same quantity, and I use this oil in my 04 Honda CB919 with 48k miles.  It makes it run smooth, maybe a little bit of a tick while cold but soon as it warms up it's gone.
B012Z461BK|5|I have loved using this in the back of my van for just picking up little things at the store, but also this is great if you are going camping. Makes it so groceries do not slide all over the van when you are driving and when camping, this keeps everything organized and also cold!!!! Collapsible when you are finished using it and easy to slide on the side so you always have to use again and again.<br /><br />I received this product at a discount in exchange for my review.
B0051AIFOM|4|Gear product. High quality like my 1st Manufacturing jacket. Some imperfections in the leather but happens after a few rides anyway.
B010TWM7RC|2|Kind of flimsy, wouldn't buy again
B00EC0YXO8|5|Snapped right in - works perfectly
B001UU0W9S|5|They work!  They look nice and seem well made.
B004AHB2HE|3|The battery was leaking when I received it. Other than that great battery.
B000GTIR5K|5|Other then the capacitor making a little extra racket it located right under the handle  it does a great a job and cuts the time in half  for most jobs.
B00S5AHP4G|5|love it!!! Great quality.
B00P9OEZR6|3|Applied to a clean car in the shade.  I wore latex gloves and worked in a well ventilated area because the chemical warnings on the bottle are pretty scary.  I used a thin coat on a foam applicator pad, and allowed about 10 minutes for the initial cure before attacking it with clean microfiber cloths.  The streaking on my black car was moderate to severe, and...although the product went on quite smoothly...took 2 hours of vigorous rubbing to pull all the streaks out.  I waited the recommended 24 hours for the &#34;full cure&#34; before driving the car. The shine was quite good, but; as noted by some other reviews - the car was a dust magnet, and picked up a considerable layer of dust before my next wash - even though my driving is limited to paved public roads.  That problem seems to have resolved, and the finish looks great after these first two weeks.  The jury is still out on long term durability.  Points on for shine; points off for toxicity, streaking and for initial dust collection attributes.
B00RVDUFHC|5|I bought this for my wife, we're big fans of Top Gear. She thought it would be funny on a mini-van
B001GJ9K8C|5|Been using since the past 3 years. Never let me down on all 3 cars at 3 different countries. Unbeatable cheap Amazon's price!
B009FNX2EO|5|The install of these was the easy part.  My wife is a bit on the shorter side and complained about the truck prior to installing these.  She absolutely loves getting into the truck now.  In fact, I’m a bit worried.  She has her own car, but, now she takes my truck everywhere.<br /><br />I used to keep my keys on the kitchen counter.  Now I have to hide them.  I caught her getting out of my truck yesterday while using the new rails singing a Reba song about trucks.  I’m afraid that from now on I’ll be adjusting the mirrors whenever I want to borrow “her” truck.<br /><br />I thought about taking the rails back off and returning them; but, I have to admit they do look great.
B00PXMANCA|5|Best investment for my car! Holds everything in place. I have bins in my CRV to put groceries in and this encompasses all of them and holds them tight - with enough stretch to easily remove.  No more items rolling around the back. Would buy again!
B009B44TL2|5|Great shock and great fit!
B00P6OQHZ2|5|Exact as the one that it replaced
B00BGZ1VJC|5|Very satisfied with product
B0010DPCKY|1|wrong one
B00OPZ6HYO|4|May be the wrong plug I'll have to investigate and I will let you know  ' are there the same celinoid with different prigs  &#34;<br />Also sone one cut all the wires to stereo , rear lights ( backup lights ) and there's more where would I find th schmatic for this area !
B0002T8FHO|5|Great  product.  Didn't  think i would ever find it again. Would  definitely recommend this product! You'll be  hooked.
B00L2T351O|5|I got this for my wife whom just bought a similar colored CRV and she likes how well it matched the color of her new car/suv. I could not believe how quickly I received it since the seller was from over seas.
B00GO8J288|3|It's white on a black helmet so that's good but I can't see any reflection when I shine a light on it.
B000ZN6PZQ|5|Perfect fit
B00Z2CXHT2|5|2000 Mustang Coupe - My trunk wasn't lifting anymore-- I had to lift it up myself, so I bought these replacements. Used a broom stick to prop up the trunk while I replaced the stock lift supports. Installed both in less than 3 minutes with a flat head screwdriver. Trunk lifts great now.
B002IFRTX6|5|This is my boyfriend's favorite scent for his truck. We can't find it in a store anywhere around Denver, so when I found them on Amazon, I had to buy some! The fresh coconut smell leaves his truck smelling nice when I ride with him.
B00MG687JW|1|Very disappointed. The battery pack buttons were not labeled, the USB ports did not work, and the instructions were unintelligible. The person who wrote the instruction sheet obviously does not speak English. I immediately returned the item and expect a refund.
B00IK9CQX2|5|Feel funny at first but nice product overall
B0012Q4IPY|5|Product arrived on time and as described.  Happy with the purchase
B0031I20JC|5|Fits my Honda Elite Scooter perfectly! It is so easy to figure out how to put on, and weighs nothing!
B004GDZ778|4|It's alright I mean it's not chrome its really good plastic painted chrome, I did notice that my chrome wasn't painted good in the middle and the cutting looked chopped up in the ends towards the headlights, I did notice that this grille is really light my old one was twice as heavy.
B003HB5WJS|5|The original manufacturer of these wheel covers stopped making them. Thanks Pilot Automotive.
B00LWGFWRC|4|Cool effects but very bright. I ended up tapping off a portion of it and added a little paint so it would only shine on the license plate.
B00SUNHB7Y|5|Awesome  just what I wanted...I have 2 sets both switches  are a little touchy  but still go on. So far so good and bright. ...easy installation  I uses rubber cement glue  to hold them on...
B003VCES9I|5|Great valve, high quality part for sure. I used these to replace the drain plug on both my 7.3 diesel F250's. I always had a drip around the drain plug no matter what gasket material I used. I tried copper washers and aluminum washers, always had a small drip. With these installed no drips and the next oil change will be much quicker and cleaner.
B00C8UPXLQ|4|Extremely hard to feed in thru the valve stem, I had to break the bead on the tire to install a 10 oz bag in a 255-60 15 corvette wheel with an aluminum rim. The result, this stuff works!!!! These wheel are impossible to balance perfectly and always had a vibe somewhere within the speed range. These little balls did the trick. If you feel a little imbalance, within a fraction of a second it's gone.
B000CERAWU|5|Perfect fit for 97-01 CRV. plug and play, the provided gasket was inferior to the old oem, used the old one instead.
B007V4XL6S|4|Good quality, fit my 2005 Ford F150 perfectly to replace the factory one that broke off.
B00BITI78Y|5|fits perfectly and easy to fix. Much cheaper than going to the shop and having replaced
B004400DX6|5|Great coat. Far, far more comfortable than the heavy leather motorcycle jackets. I even took it as a coat to wear out west without the motorcycle. Venting is sufficient. Great to have a waterproof coat that can be worn any time. For me the style is far more appealing than the Harley look. I believe it will protect against road rash as good as a 15lb. leather monster. Just wish that my girl friends leather cycle jacket wasn't so new.
B005FWWUNS|3|Awesome display but the wires are ultra thin (cheap) be very careful when wiring up.
B000XSI96G|5|Excellent tool set, does everything as advertised. Makes swapping out power steering pulleys easier than other sets I've had
B00E1J4U98|4|Missing 2 itemes, Shipping good.
B0068EOJDG|5|Cap looked and worked great, easy to screw on and off. You get what you pay for.
B001BFS0V4|3|I've used these pads before and they performed very well and installed with no issues, but this time I had to file the abutment &#34;ears&#34; so they would fit. Also the pads are supplied with the abutment clips but no longer come with the pin boots, which must be purchased separately if needed. As the other reviewer noted the picture shows the incorrect brand. These are Centric Posi Quiet Extended life pads. After this last purchase I'm not sure I'd buy them again.
B000KKLLFS|5|Replacements for the rough looking ones that came with my new pre-owned car. Fit tight and protected my valve stems I don't really know what more I could ask for from these.
B0022XS3F2|5|WOW....I PLACED MY ORDER ON THE 17TH OF AUGUST AND RECEIVED MY ORDER ON THE 19TH OF AUGUST WOW,,,,AND AS FAR AS THE MIRRORS,THEY ARE OF GOOD QUALITY...AND THE CHROME LOOKS GREAT.
B000PAM9KO|5|It fit.  I think it is still there.
B00OCEFQGS|5|One handed operation.. good pressure and leaves other hand free to hold fitting on Zerk..
B0089LSMSE|3|I haven't used this fluid yet, however it is genuine Honda fluid
B00B3V2YAO|4|great product!
B006H7WJUE|5|The service delivery was great and on time as promised. Little  dissapointed with the ear mikes not a quarity product.
B00U5UBQE4|4|Worked great as a removable kill switch.
B002BHRXJ6|4|don't use it yet but the comb number 22 fits on my radiators fin and that's what i was looking for
B0041PKL5Y|5|Great value relative to price.  I do mostly short, casual rides on f800gs.  I'm an old guy.  These shoes are comfy,  give moderate support and decent protection for a low price.  I don't ride in rain, no ideas if waterproof.  I like because these are okay for waking too.  The Velcro could be a bit stronger,  sometimes when I flex ankle they will come open,  only when walking though,  hasn't happened when riding. ...
B003XNMZXQ|5|As described
B00SLKWNO2|2|They went on well, but the paint started peeling off within a month of installation.  Overall they manage the weight of heavier set passengers and it makes it easier to get in and out.  They do the job.
B004LF6Q1C|5|Great product, fair price, fast delivery.
B0066RZH0Y|1|I have to replace it after just 3 months. Doesn't seal well, started to have a slight leak almost right out of the box. Should have returned right away.
B0089T07P2|5|Worked on my 1998 Jeep Wrangler - Great Item - Fast Shipping - Will Purchase Again
B000CIZZZ0|5|it look great on my 2003 dodge ram and went on easy.
B00LEBLI82|3|Not as bright as I thought it was going to be, but I am still using them.
B009PQC0NU|5|Thank you, I am happy to be driving again.
B0068EV26I|2|Don't recommend! My first one had to be sent back right away because the one port didn't work at all. When i received my second one i noticed something....The first one i received i don't think was new, i think it was a refurbished or returned one because it wasn't even shrink wrapped and fully packaged like the second one was!
B004A30FHG|5|Super fast shipping A++++++++part
B00029WZ0W|1|had to send back worng size for truck my truck forgot it  is modified
B003FBV8ZW|5|Not cheap sunglasses at all. I use the yellow for my motorcycle and the dark for my car. SWEET
B0047TZWGC|5|I LOVE this stuff!  Pretty much a stickler about driving a clean ,shiny car, but I have no garage!  I do all my own detailing, too.  This is not only the easiest wax I have EVER used, but it makes the most obvious difference.. Right after I did my car friends came over and remarked at how beautiful it looked -  and they didn't know I had done anything.  Highly recommed using microfiber cloths.  I didn't the first time, then got some and did a spot.  Simple became a breeze
B004YMRIC8|3|I like the quality, but am disappointed how flexible the wands are. It's very difficult to add any pressure for scrubbing as they bend quite a bit with only a few pounds of pressure.
B00A3UNYW8|5|Sure beats trying to make the procedure in the manual work!
B003175ARM|3|good
B000GV52KG|5|Perfect for the crash bar on my Sporty 1200 Custom XL. Easy to position for a shorter (5'5&#34;) rider.
B00BGX0OXI|5|Perfect
B00X4SMYO0|5|I thought I would never put anything on my Mac until I saw this! Looks awesome on it!
B00KIGCSRE|5|Easy to follow instructions and performs exactly as it advertises.
B007O3NXPU|4|These work well on our Jeep, although my husband wishes there was a way to permanently mount them on the Jeep rather than just rattling around in the back until they're needed.
B00P1N9OWG|5|Very helpful, nice products, great seller. thanks.
B000HEBR3I|5|Excellent product. Saves on the back from lifting 5 gallon gas can.
B000F5IKUC|5|My husband uses this for work it's a great time saver.
B009J2J0SI|1|I am completely dissatisfied with these Kayak Carrier Saddles...and...we paid extra to have the saddles expedited so they would arrive before our upcoming camping trip.<br /><br />I ordered two sets to use with the new 10' kayaks my wife and I recently purchased.  I selected the TMS saddles specifically so that our boats would ride flat on the top of our truck canopy roof rack.<br /><br />When I opened the packaging I discovered that one saddle was missing a necessary pin, rendering the saddle unusable.  After installing the remaining saddles on my roof rack I found that they did not conform to the shape for the kayak hull.  Additionally, it was very difficult to adjust the spacing of the saddles to hold the kayaks securely.<br /><br />I am now working with TMS Customer Service to return these saddles for full refund.<br /><br />Word of warning....if your kayak hull is not round and smooth...I suggest you look for another solution.<br /><br />I am going with profiled closed-cell foam blocks.  A superior solution, for me...and much less expensive.<br />george
