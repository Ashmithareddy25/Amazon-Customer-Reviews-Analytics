B001LF347E|5.0|This is a great show that definitely gets better as it goes. Yes, the CGI can be pretty cheesy at times, but I think that's par for the course when it comes to BBC shows like this. On the plus side, they don't happen all that often. Some people might be put off by the 'historical inaccuracies,' but come on. You can't get more historically inaccurate than magic and dragons being 100% real. It's a fantasy show, not a documentary. Besides, a medieval plague filled 'England' doesn't sound like a very fun time.<br /><br />However, these supposedly new DVDs looked anything but. Bent and faded corners on both the outer sleeve as well as the DVD case itself. The discs had some minor scratches too. Considering I bought this from Amazon and not a third-party seller, I was quite surprised. The DVDs also have some problems during play. The play all feature sometimes freezes while switching from one episode to the next. One time it even caused my computer to completely crash. It's only happened a couple of times, but if it becomes an ongoing problem I will return/sell the set and buy a new one. Fortunately there hasn't been any play issues during the episodes themselves.
B009NXV2RK|3.0|A great read - typical Clancy. Very topical. The demise of the 'bad guys' lacked emotion and could have been a lot more descriptive.
B008HT4FUW|5.0|I had never seen any of the episodes and after reading the reviews, decided to order.  My husband & I started watching and loved every chapter.  Can't wait to see the 3rd season when it is released.
B009B4ZEMA|5.0|This is a great record, not too mainstream, not too experimental, it contains all Xtina's styles in one. Its not only for Christina lovers, I truly recomend this album for everyone.
B00003CX8N|5.0|The British once again excelling at their craft. Set during WWII, from the USA to the UK. Pen pals and book lovers throughout the War. You will be engrossed and thoroughly enjoy this one, especially if you're old enough to remember Pen Pals and the cards and letters delivered by mail between Lovers and Friends.
B0079XPUOW|3.0|This is by no means Scalzi's best work but it is fun if you are a fan of Star Trek.  It's a great concept but just not as fun as some of his other books - like the Old Man's War series.  It get slow to the point at about 75% through you think the story is over, it would have been a solid ending and turn the page and see a new chapter...  The characters first line \\"So what's next...\\"<br /><br />To be fair the book did have me laughing out loud a few times - so - I wouldn't skip it if you like Star Trek satire...  but don't expect it to be \\"the best book you ever read\\".  Glad a read it but won't be keeping it on my Kindle :)
B0084BMUFA|5.0|Great story...easy to follow...a Christmas classic at its best. Good for all ages. Some chilling and heartfelt moments about friends and family
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|GOT THIS FOR THE KIDS TO MESS WITH, PRETTY MUCH A WASTE OF TIME FOR MY OWN USE OR ENJOYMENT.
B0058YPGSY|5.0|this was for my daughter.  We watch the show too and now she can watch it whenever she wants.  Always something unexpected on this show.
B008MEM24S|5.0|love the game it is very fun I really wish that there were more levels on where's my Perry but even though the game is super super fun
B005FISC52|5.0|my doughter loves this show and now she can watch it whenever she wants.  A great gift idea for anyone who likes the show
0385535147|5.0|This was a good Christmas present.  Hubby's hard to buy for. I usually buy him Grisham books, this is better than some he's read.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|The app is so much addictive you can do more things than temple run this app is better than temple run
B009IJJ5B4|4.0|Watched the first episode, preparing to be unimpressed. Ended up buying the whole season. Holmes is frustrating and irritating and almost completely unlikeable, but fascinating. Lucy Liu as Watson was a master stroke. She acts the adult to Holmes' precocious child/man. As different from BBC's Sherlock as it could be, but definitely worth the time.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|Now this album is spectacular! This is what I expected from Adele! Almost every song is so wonderfully written and sung!
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|it is a great game it is addicting ti get different dragons and showing them off to everyone and also all the things you can do
B0018QOIXU|3.0|It is ok, but I was expecting a little better from Adele on this album due to it's critical acclaim!
B00ABGEFWC|3.0|Great app for when your bord and just need a little cuteness jumping around. There cute nice and lovible little animals.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|The book captures you immediately and takes you on a carnival ride soaring through deep space.  I can't wait to start book two.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|All of my kids love &#34;Lorax&#34; The price was great at $3.99!! Dr. Seuss has the best books and movies.
B00AMBH70S|5.0|Great movie..plenty of action. this movie shows the audience fills in the missing parts from last movies so viewers can draw and see the connection...well done...cannot wait for next one.
B007HACDLK|5.0|this author has been hugely blessed and the more he writes the better life is for the reading world. Characters are superb and I hope that he goes on forever.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I really enjoyed this hidden object game.I've tried several games but this one was one of the best.I recommend this one with five stars
B006LSZECO|3.0|I was truly enthralled with this book. I went through a roller coaster of emotions, but it was the ending that truly created the greatest reaction I've ever had from a book.
B007SGM084|5.0|I absolutely loved this trilogy!  I found myself completely in love with Christian Grey and smitten with the man he becomes.  I couldn't put the series down!  I highly recommend these books and wish that there were more than three to read.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Waking up married was a good contemporary romance!  It kept me reading it straight through.  The situation, though unlikely, was well written and the characters believable.  I found myself really rooting for them as a couple!  Thanks for the fun read!
B000FA675C|5.0|Really intriguing little slow in the beginning but it gets better as it progresses I recommend it to anyone who's interested  in action with some historical content
B009FZFONO|5.0|Absolutely one of my favorite series on TV right now.  Right up there with Breaking Bad, Dexter and Homeland.  I recommend starting from season one.  This is not a series that you can just jump into.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|its one of the coolest games i have ever played. i hope my kindle does not die i have been playing it for hours.
B00632HWOG|1.0|Love how I can check e-mails and delete them and write new ones and see contact list as needed.  Great.
B003O86FMW|4.0|I thought this book was great. I read it all in a day. I can't wait for the next one!
0062014102|1.0|I read this book with great interest until the author decided to mention Sathya Sai Baba.<br /><br />An A class sicko who uses manipulation and mind control to do what many of those of severe religious nature tend to do... Pedophilia.<br /><br />After promptly reading that part of Sathya Sai Baba I threw this book in the trash.<br /><br />I've also noticed a steady rise in the price of this book.  Probably, because it has become more and more popular.<br /><br />If you're seeking some sort of truth from this book, I will go ahead and provide it for you<br /><br />It is a waste of time<br />It is a waste of money<br />Do not bother
B003K16P3M|4.0|There are  some parts where I was kind of lost but over all this book was amazing.  I wish there was a second one to see how she and Po ended up.
B0068LYEHA|3.0|I read this book for a book club.  It sparked some VERY good conversations.  It touches on a lot of great women's issues in a lighthearted way.  The first half of the book was hard to get through.  The chapters dragged on a bit for my liking.  But at the end I was captivated.  There is a lot of British humor that I didn't get, but I'm sure would be funny to those who live there or are more aware of their social culture.<br />The author does a really good job of presenting the topics and her point of view.  A good feminist read!! :)
B005P3NPXG|5.0|I really never listened to any of Seal's music but when I heard a few of the old school songs that he re-made, I thought WOW he really did this CD justice!  New School vs Old School....can't wait for the next one.
1451627289|4.0|its a time travel novel all right but its far from confusing for the newbies on the time travel genera, thats a very good point for King in this novel.<br /><br />we have here a very nostalgic look at the pre-kennedy era of the united states, reflecting the details of being a common person in the USA of the late 50's.<br /><br />as usual for the author you'll get to know the characters you'll follow thru the story and will get why they do what they do and you can even miss them.<br /><br />i personally use to read a lot on stephen king and having a little about the kennedy assassination was a plus.. but i ended up very happy with my reading and my purchase.<br /><br />hope you enjoy it as well
B005LAII08|5.0|This is a wonderful story excellently done both in animation and voice acting. This version has multiple formats to fit any needs.
0091939526|5.0|I purchased this book more out of curiosity than anything.  I've always been rather healthy and I play a lot of sports so I wanted to test the book's theory.  I went on the recommended diet and in just five days I dropped an easy 4 pounds.  I'm currently down 8 pounds and it doesn't feel like much of a &#34;diet&#34; at all, which is amazing.  Now, to clarify, I didn't get this book as  diet book...I got it to see how he recommends transforming one's body.  I particularly like that he goes into the science behind a lot of it and demonstrates the results with pictures and facts.  Whether you want to lose weight (which if you follow its guidelines, you will) or just learn more about how your body functions, I think it is a very interesting read.
B002SAUCBC|4.0|This is such a good story that I'm wondering why I didn't hear of it years ago.  The basic premise is really simple and really compelling, and Stephen King's writing is terrific as Richard Bachman.<br /><br />The ONLY real issue I had is that, given the pacing intrinsic to the storyline, the ending was a little abrupt and of nowhere for my taste.  Not sure what I was expecting, but I was disappointed and felt that Stephen King just wasn't able to come up with anything as good as the story itself.<br /><br />But it's definitely worth a read, and the storyline sticks with you.  I was inspired to take a two-hour walk of San Francisco just because of it!
B008602KQI|3.0|I was not expecting much and I was right. Their was no passion. The book is about hunger and the actors didn't look famished.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|This is a great movie that will keep you intrigued, curious and entertaine.  The nimation is top notch...very well done!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|The second book was just as good as the first. I love this series. I can't wait for the third book!
B0050XFY4O|4.0|As with many foreign films, the movie started out slow: a lot of building up of the brother's relationship when young. I felt the concerns about the relationship were a little vague as to why the adults were concerned it might turn sexual as there was nothing sexual expressed during their youth. I've been close relationships between brothers that weren't much different than in the movie and they did not move into a sexual realm. Then as adults this just seemed to explode with their mother's death. I thought the movie was beautifully filmed and the subject matter handled well. Some people I'm sure would be offended but then why were they watching the movie in the first place, since there was no question as to the subject matter. Overall, I liked the film.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Absolutely loved this book! I never wanted to stop reading, in fact I read this book in two days. I highly recommend!
B00AMBH70S|3.0|I found it to be quite boring. It was very slow compared to the original ones. I am not a fan of car chases.
B001HBYHFA|4.0|Enjoyed this movie after just recently being introduced to the Firefly season.  Too bad they didn't make at least one more season.  Or explain a thing or two in the movie, left over questions from the season.
B006O3MU96|1.0|I downloaded this game... but it doesn't seem to work. The jump doesn't correspond with when it is suppossed to, and Doodle just looses all the time.
B00AKO93JK|4.0|Like everyone I make a commitment to take care of myself at the start of the new year.  This year I received a Kindle Fire for Christmas and spent my vacation perusing the aps.  I stumbled upon Daily Workouts and decided this would perfect for me.  Four days into the new year I have worked out every morning.  You can choose 10, 20 or 30 minute workouts and the target area (full body, arms, legs or abs).  The exercises are easy to do for those who are familiar with exercising and easy to follow, thanks to the video, for newbies.  I don't have much spare time so I've been doing the ten minute workouts when I get up in the morning and it's made a difference in my day.  I hope to work up to the longer workouts but this is definitely a good starter for anyone!
B001QL5MAA|4.0|I was thoroughly impressed once I got accustomed to the writer's style. I'm a big fan of Peter Hamilton and Alastair Reynolds is now in contention. He might not take the top spot from Hamilton but I'll certainly be buying more of his work.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|My children love Angry Birds so when I got my Kindle I figured it would be a fun game to start with...two hours later I was still playing.  Its very easy to get lost in battling those pesky pigs!  I recommend this for anyone who needs something to take their mind off of things.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Good story. Even if it is predictable love story, you can't put it down because of the intensity of the relationship. Why was only 3 books??!!
159315724X|4.0|I really liked the concise information in this easy to read book.  I will keep this one on the shelf and reread it yearly.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Good story. Even if it is predictable love story, you can't put it down because of the intensity of the relationship. Why was only 3 books??!!
B0027MJU00|5.0|Gritty ... unfolds like a bad dream you have see through to the end.  Waking up is relief.  Do not plan on putting it down ...

B008MEM24S|5.0|this. app is supper fun. and. exiting. you will love it I recomemd it you shoud not turn it down.
030758836X|5.0|Crazy story! Loved the twists and never knowing what was going to happen. Truly recommend it. You will not be able to put it down.

0525478817|5.0|Such a good read. Their definition of cancer patients really made me think. I even highlighted parts to remember later, something I don't do since college.
B00710Z87M|5.0|This has been a favorite of mine for years and it is the best written on this subject. Well ahead of its time, it was useful way back in the 80's when I bought my first copy. It is not the usual predigested psychobabble that a lot of abundance books feed you, rather it explains in a gentle and practical way how the laws of attraction work as well powerful tools to heal blocks through exercises that follow the books sections. Well done and thank you to Sanya Roman, Duane Packer and Orin & Da Ben! (I LOVE ALL OF SANAYA's other books too!)
B000MQC9H4|4.0|For the most part this was a great movie. The reason for 4 stars instead of 5 was the role played by Jack Black.  He and Kate Winslet just didn't seem to &#34;fit&#34;!  Regardless, it is a fun movie and entertaining movie..
B004JN1D2I|4.0|i AM ONLY AT 13% AFTER ABOUT 3 WEEKS OF READING.  I AM ENJOYING IT, NOW THAT I AM FAMILIAR WITH MOST OF THE CHARACTERS.
B0055PGUYU|4.0|Very good insights on how we make decisions daily simply based on habits. It can help move your organization in the right direction.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I enjoyed this book, because I could understand Christian's control issues better, and it has a happy ending.  Looks are not everything.
B005LAII8K|5.0|Joseph Gordon-Levitt and writer/director Rian Johnson proved to be the perfect pair with 2005's BRICK.  They're back together again in LOOPER, the story of a hitman who kills people sent back in time from the future.  Joe's got a good life: drugs, babes, money.  Of course, this lifestyle comes with a catch: one day, the person you're supposed to kill turns out to be your future self.  This means you get to live out your remaining years (roughly 30) doing whatever you so desire.  Of course, in Joe's case, things don't go according to plan; his future self escapes, on a mission to prevent the death of his wife, and now both Joes find themselves being pursued by ruthless killers.<br /><br />LOOPER is stunning.  Visually, it's a treat; the effects are impressive, the cinematography astounding.  The action is slick and the dialogue is quick and intelligent, just what we'd expect from a Rian Johnson script.  Perhaps the biggest surprise here (well, for non-Johnson fans, at least) is the caliber of acting.  The supporting cast is impressive: Emily Blunt, Noah Segan, Garrett Dillahunt, and child actor Pierce Gagnon all shine, while Jeff Daniels and Paul Dano are especially memorable.  Bruce Willis brings gravitas to the role of future Joe; he doesn't say much, but as with his best performances, he's able to convey quite a lot with his piercing gaze.  Older Joe is a complex character, and Willis is able to play his single-minded obsession to commit atrocious deeds for sympathetic reasons.<br /><br />But this is Gordon-Levitt's film.  Sure, he has prosthetics to make him resemble Willis; but more to the point, much as Josh Brolin did a la Tommy Lee Jones for MEN IN BLACK 3, Gordon-Levitt has studied Willis's mannerisms and voice, coming off as a truly convincing younger version of the actor.  And yet, the role isn't mere imitation; Gordon-Levitt proves why he's considered one of the best rising actors out there right now, bringing a haunting sense of pathos (not to mention cojones) to his role.  Thanks to his performance, and Rian Johnson's script, LOOPER comes off as one of the most unique, memorable science fiction/action films in years.  It'll go down as a cult classic, and maybe one day, simply a classic example of the genre.jones) to his role.

B004N6369Y|4.0|I am a big Danielle Steel fan and Hotel Vendome did not disappoint! This was a sweet read with personable characters that I thoroughly enjoyed. Loved the locales and descriptive scenery...great holiday (or anytime)read!
0525953728|3.0|The book was pretty good.  I don't understand the hue and cry over it.  I didn't see anything that would compromise operational security or tactics.
B009JBZH54|4.0|One of the best movie trilogy, no doubt, as I'm sure many will agree. Great value for all 3 movies. Only thing is the packaging smells and feels kind of funny.
B00979CS50|3.0|It's Neil Young, it's Crazy Horse, it's electric and it's filled with long, jammed-out tunes.  You're pumped.  Rolling Stone raved about it.  And?  Average tunes.  Nothing great.  It's not going to blow you away and it's probably better to listen to song samples and purchase a tune or three rather than the entire album.
B008CLI3TE|5.0|Simply said, Buy it! Great value for a great series. I found that I like the series more after multiple viewings. I noticed that I missed a lot of nuances in my first viewing. This set is a must own! Nice packaging, stylish menu.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|Another American classic tale about good ole' American capitalistic greed, born out of one's want to excel and become welathy, while stepping on people and creatures each step of the way up.  In true cartoon and cinematic form, the happy ending is what we all hoped for.
B006GH6IWU|5.0|Obviously made with an enormous amount of love, thoughtfulness and admiration. Brian and Roger are such thoughtful and kind people and it is obvious how much they love and still miss Freddie. As do we all...
B007THA4FI|1.0|I've read 100-125 books per year for 25 + yrs.  I read every subject as well as older classics, poetry & text books, I may not finish two, but usually one book a year that I've started.  I simply could not finish this book.  I gave it 100 pages then bailed.  I'm sorry, but it lost me.
B0033780Y0|5.0|The best book, in my opinion, about day to day life with the incomparable, magical, and endlessly fascinating Freddie Mercury. Bring A LOT of Kleenex.
B009KY5OGC|5.0|I loved this book. I have read it over and over. Ot made me want to travel to America and see some Native Americans.
B00AA7O22U|5.0|There is a lot of action in the movie. That makes up for some of the contrived//referenced lines they say. Those lines did not make it for me.
B00AAX68HG|5.0|Can't seem to get enough of this game. Absolutely love it. Very addictive!!!! Downloaded it when I had the flu and played all day
B001JIFYSA|5.0|In my family, this film is a holiday tradition and I still watch almost every minute of it. Bill Nighy is especially fun but the whole cast is great. For the most part it's a family film; adult bits seem to sail over youngsters' heads.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love minecraft and have been playing this app for about 4 to 6 months and have never had any problems with anything in the game until yesterday when I was playing my survival mode and had a awesome house and diamonds it just shut off my kindle and when I turned it back on and got back on minecraft nothing none of my progress since I first made the world had been saved I thought well no big deal I had other worlds and when I went to play on those the same thing had happened to them and all of my other worlds including creative mode worlds and if mojang cares about not having a ton of bad reviews I suggest that they fix that little problem because the same thing happened to all my friends that had minecraft for kindle fire around the same time too so please fix it because I love minecraft and would hate to have to stop playing it so again please please please fix the problem please!!!
B0083GQKQG|4.0|I know it is always bought to compare books and movies. The movie skips around a lot, which I guess is part of the style. However, I watched it with 2 people who hadn't read the book and I certainly appreciated it more because I knew the backstory even when things weren't clear. The movie also missed a lot of the parts that made the book great; I know they can't fit everything in but the book was about so much more than what is presented in the movie. I don't think i would have ever wanted to watch this movie solely based on its description, though I am glad that I did have an interest in it because of the book. The acting is extremely good, but I feel like the story comes together much better if you've read the book and is a bit confusing if you haven't. Either way, it is haunting and powerful.
B009HEJXFS|5.0|I loved the interactions between the 2 and the guy that could see infinite possibilities was hilarious! I would watch again.
B007TXN4TK|5.0|Here is a game that teaches you how to play the piano by making it a game!! Has a lot of popular classic music and is easy to follow. I think this is a great and fun game that you can actually learn something from.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Wasn't expecting much from the middle book, but I was pleasantly surprised when the book picked up pace about half way through. Can't wait to read the next book.
B009SQOGZ2|5.0|I love most of the movies done in this style. This one is fun and kinda dark. It was exactly what i was expecting and the graphics are great. If you like tim burton style movies this is one to add to your collection
B000JMKQX0|4.0|Was not sure what to tihnk when I picked this one up. Love zombie books and in interviews think the author is a decent guy with a heathly respect for thre zombie hoards.<br />The way he wrote this more as a historical look at the events that unfold is refreshing. With so many different &#34;folks&#34; discussing what happen during the &#34;war&#34;, the reader gets a ton of viewpoints. not something that is typically done.<br />This allows one to use their imagination even further with each &#34;story&#34; being documented.<br />Well done Max Brooks.
B004VYYA2K|2.0|the zipper dont stay up but will figure something out to keep them up! daughter likes the house that is printed on it
B009WO7NQO|5.0|My daughter actually wanted me to get this for the kindle fire. i've found it a blast and the new things the birds can do based on the movies are just way fun to use. Well worth the little bit of money it cost to buy. so far probally 30 hours and counting of funfor me and my four year old.
B000001Y42|5.0|Rap metal at its finest. I prefer slipknot but i heard these guys before them so i think they are the ones who turned me onto them.
B00003CXBK|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies by Miyazaki. Like always the artwork and story are amazing and it's enjoyable to watch more than once. It arrived before the estimated delivery date and in good condition.

B0041KW076|5.0|I choose this rating because excellant packing and very quick delivery very impressed.<br />Also you cannot beat the sound on good old vinyl, you can hear the difference straight away.<br />Would reccomend any one thinking of buying this should DO IT. Thank you AMAZON so much Col in OZ
0316227706|5.0|I have this on my coffee table and it is definitely a conversation started. Everyone that comes over has to look at the entire book from start to finish and always enjoys doing so.
B00A6PD9I4|1.0|it never download so i can watch with the time i rented it for.. so i cant tell u if its good or not
B00004CWNQ|1.0|Very disappointed in this product, my husband and I put it into the player to watch but it kept wanting some key.
B00AJRQLTI|5.0|This isn't like a broadway soundtrack, this is real and raw. Great rendition of this classic. I recommend it to fans.
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|My four yr old and I love &#34;Cut the Rope&#34;, &#34;Where's My Water&#34; & &#34;Perry's Water&#34; so we knew we would enjoy Pudding Monsters. It's fun and funny!
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Story is not bad but a little to explicit.  Read it because I heard so much about it.  I was curious.  Better than I thought it would be.  Decided to buy book two as I hear it gets better.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|This is great for the advanced Angry Birder. The gravity, and lack of makes this version more challenging than previous versions.
B00063F8B2|5.0|The soundtrack from this film is a winner.  From Kate Smith to Bing Crosby plus Steven Tyler and Josh Groban?  This music will put you in the mood for Christmas!
B009WO7NQO|4.0|Love it but need more. Anxiously awaiting the &#34;Free Update Coming Soon&#34;. Love the Star Wars weapons and the music.
0395389496|5.0|As a gift for my son and his family, each of my granddaughters received a copy of the Polar Express and tickets to a Polar Express train for the 2013 voyage.  The whole family is looking forward to this trip  and reading the book, watching the video and listening to the soundtrack adds to the anticipation.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|I love this version of TD Bloons! It's challenging and very addictive. It would be nice to have holiday boards however.
B00APUYWYA|4.0|The movie kept me laughing throughout. Perfect movie for a lazy Sunday afternoon on the couch at home. good work.
0307279189|5.0|Jeeze! WIth over 1200 reviews already, there's not much i can add to to discussion, except another 5 stars. I am not a runner. I recently moved to Portsmouth NH and went down to see their Turkey Trot. The following day, I discovered that one of my bus-friends was in the race. I peppered him with questions and he loaned me his copy of the book. So, I'm going to assume that all questions related to the minutiae of running have been covered elsewhere here. I just have to say that this is proof that combining a skilled journalist with a field of non-fiction is the winning, contemporary combination for superlative writing. He modulates his sentences like the landscapes his runners scramble over. He juggles contemporary slang and jargon, to say nothing of Spanish 101, with absolute joy, letting it lean against an assured mastery of the craft of syntax. His story telling skills are superb. And his grasp of large scale form is tremendous. How daring to place a flash-back right before the end of the book, and how tremendously effective, right after the gripping narrative of the race itself. There are even a couple of chapter-asides, where he discusses the current thinking on racing science, specifically why bare feet are the best feet and how we are evolutionarily engineered to run long distances. I'm sure they might come off like some of those \\"and now, for a little history on whaling\\" chapters in Moby Dick to some readers, but I found them an excellent addition to the rise and fall of the book's narrative lone. Like I say, I'm not a runner. There is ever reason in the world for this book to bore the stuffing out of me. It didn't. It most certainly didn't.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I have read many books on the subject of life after death and this one is the very best.  He goes into detail about his experience.  I have recommended this to friends and family
B000FBFN1U|5.0|I have read all five of The Game of Thrones Books. I actually read them all in a row after I had watched the first season on TV. If you like a good mix of fantasy, old historical times and pure adventure,- you will LOVE this series.!!!
0425252868|5.0|I bought this book after hearing it talked about on a conservative talk radio station.  It sounded like something my 11 year old son would love. We are a pretty conservative family so as I do with any &#34;adult&#34; book he wants to read, I read it first.  I couldn't put it down!  I really don't care to read about war and other manly things (as I am female)  but this book was really really good, and I didn't find anything in it that my son couldn't read.  I can't wait for him to read it, I think he will enjoy it just as much as I did!
B000FC1HBY|5.0|I have read all of George Martins Game of Thrones series. I actually read all five in a row after I had watched the first season on tv. If like a good mix of fantasy, old historical times and pure adventure you will love this series. Can't wait for the last two installments!!!
B008L1DNGI|5.0|Game runs smoother and looks much clearer than its original. This game is a fun puzzler, that i would recommend to everyone.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|I thought this might be  just another vampire story, but I decided to try it and was pleasantly surprised. Interesting concept and the characters really come to life. It is the first in a trilogy and looking forward to the rest.
B004DM1ZQY|5.0|This game is great! I have played this for years with my family and now I can play with any level player I want and when I want.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|What can I say. I love Ken Follett and I loved this book. I really like to read long historical fiction and he always delivers. As some of the other reviews have said -  maybe his historical facts aren't always correct, but his characters always come alive and keep you interested. Can't wait for the third book!
B00081U7HC|5.0|I am in love with Richard Gere and then add Julia Roberts to the mix! I think this is one of the few movies I will/have watch over and over.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|I have read all five of The Game of Thrones series. I actually read them all in a row after I had watched the first season on TV.If you like a good mix of fantasy,wonderful characters,old historical times, and pure adventure,- yu wiull LOVE this series! I can't wait for the last two books in the series!!!
0385341008|5.0|My sister-in-law mailed me this book (yes some people still read actual books) from Switzerland to read while I was recovering from surgery.  I opened it up and became so intrigued with the characters that it was almost impossible to put down.  Juliet's letters made me laugh and cry and now that I'm finished I do miss the characters so much.  I began reading slower during the last 10 pages because I didn't want the stories to end.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|I love long historical fiction and this did not disappoint. I was a little hesitant because I like my history to be farther back in time. But as soon as I started to read- I was hooked. Ken Follett is the best!
B00AMBH70S|4.0|Well, Finally got around to watching this movie.  First impressions:  Not as good as the others.  Don't get me wrong, it was good, just not as good.  The plot was kind of rehashed.  Big Government Black ops group decides to cover up operations by killing the operatives.  Aaron Cross, played by Jeremy Renner must make a run for it.  Along the way, he saves and protects a research Doc who was working with the bad guys but not asking any questions.<br />The door was left open for another movie, so I expect to see more from Renner in this series.  The lame part was the referring to Jason Bourne on several occasions, in an attempt to tie the plot together.  Jason Bourne never materialized and there were no cameos by Matt Damon, so this seemed lame and unnecessary.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|I really like most of Grisham's books and this did not disappoint. It kept my interest and was a quick read.
B008ELUEQC|5.0|It might be far from objective review because I really like what R.S. has done for last decade or even more. However I dare to claim Merry Christmas, Baby is one of most beautiful Christmas CD I've heard. That may be because I love early jazz music, and Frank Sinatra, Nat King Cole, Sammy Davies, Jr. and the Others are stil my friends.<br />There is a dozen known holliday songs and there is no affectation in performance. If you like his style - the CD is for you.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|I have read all five of the Game of Thrones series. I actually read read them in a row after i had watched the first season on TV. If you like a good mix of fantasy, wonderful characters,old historical times and pure adventure- you will LOVE this series. Martin is a master story teller. I can't wait for the final two books!!!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This was an AMAZING book. Read it in just over a day, couldn't put it down. The twist is even better. So glad there is not a sequel that I have to wait to be released because I would die not knowing the whole story. DEFINITELY RECOMMEND!
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I usually never read a book after i have seen it made into a movie or TV show. I think it spoils the book for me. However i made an exception in this case because some friends told me it was a great read. They were so right. Not only did i read the book, but I continued to read the next four all in a row. WOW is Martin a wonderful story teller. His characters jump off the page. If you like a good mix of fantasy, old historical times and just pure adventure- you will LOVE this series!!!
B00A8ECU24|5.0|This game is good for bronys or if you like my little pony friendship is magic<br />I just think its awesome just awesome
B00A7ZWUJC|3.0|Its okay, i enjoy the music, but she has better music out there, i would recommend this cd. I like about 6 of her sons in this cd.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|My opinion this app is amazing. You can evolve your shark by buying upgrades which you buy using gold or gems. You get the gold or gems by playing the game or buying with real money. Tip: Grow your shark to the full size to unlock the next shark and buy with gold. This is just few of the many thing you are capable of doing on Hungry Shark Evolution. Hope this helped!!! :)
0061730327|5.0|This was given to our grandson on his 11th birthday to show him that you really can do something to make a difference and share the story of a remarkable and inventive young man.
B008DM4OTA|2.0|Its not really clear what you're supposed to do.  Just tap and swipe randomly until you end up in the hospital lobby.  My daughter found it kinda pointless.
B008YRVW0I|2.0|kind of boring.  its a matching game ( like those jewel games) in disguise, then you &#34;buy&#34; fish for your aqaurium.  UGH
B000HKW7E0|5.0|Always loved this movie.  Being able to enhance it with Blue Ray makes it even better!  Classic movies being enhanced by today's technology brings them new life.
0486474917|5.0|Sherlock Holmes is a recommended reading for all people who want to have good moments of pleasure. It is always refreshing.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This story is a great as the first 2 by Colleen Hoover! The story flows so perfectly and the writing is great! Loved it loved it loved it!!
1577314808|5.0|It is definitely one of the most important book ever written. All people should read it to try Eckhart Tolle's teachings.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|Pendergast novels are my all time favorites, although when solo, I prefer L. Child. Beginning with Relic, there are just none better.
0452289963|5.0|A very beautiiful book with an accurate analysis about human beings, ego and minds. It also is an optimistic book about mankind's destiny.
B00457WZEI|5.0|Great book, good story told through the mind of a horse, and what the war was from his eyes. I give 5 stars.
B003O86FMW|5.0|A lot of surprises and exciting moments to keep any Hanger games lover reading non-stop. Can't wait to read book 3.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I saw the Hunger Games movie out of curiosity & was amazed that I liked it.  I'm older & had no idea how wrong I was.  I know this was written for younger ages, but it is much more involved than anticipated.  In fact some younger people may not even know the type of government this movie depicted.  Loved the writing & how it completely took you into the story. Excellent!
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Fun game.  Great graphics and sound.  Puzzles are challenging enough.  Hidden object scenes are very good.  All around great game to past the time with.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|easy to share notes and pictures with others. It found my drawings I thought<br /><br /> lost from other app Sketcher . I like that connection with other apps,  saves time
0446389234|5.0|I loved this graphic novel! It was exhilarating and suspenseful. Although a little on the short side (probably because I couldn't put it down), this comic book was absolutely stunning. A true Batman novel. I give it a 5 star rating, and recommend it to anyone who is interested in the Batman character.
B007XKEY6Q|2.0|I used to love this app.... then it started to force close on my kindle fire every time i open it. How sad; it was one of my favorites. Reinstalling and restarting the device did not help, either. If this bug were fixed the app would get five stars from me.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|Don't start The Pact unless you don't have anything to do tomorrow.  You won't want to put it down and you won't want the story to end either.
0345803485|5.0|I had to read to find out what all the fuss was about! It was quite an exciting read to be sure! I ended up reselling on ebay when I was finished and got all of my money back! It was nice to know what everyone was talking about , i hate to be out of the loop! ha
B008BM9L72|3.0|Fifty<br />A little too much after a while. Good psychodynamics and storyline, at least the over all messagebis is sound
0345803493|4.0|I found myself wanting more story and less description of sexual encounters so I found myself fast forwarding my reading on this second novel. I was glad there was a second novel as the author leaves you wanting to know what ends up happening with the main characters.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Great book I suggest it to 5 graders because I thought that it would be a good book for 5 graders
B009K45Y62|5.0|I love this set, I didn't relize that when it had said limited edition that there were only 35,000. The movie was great and all the special features added to the entertainment. I like that it came with a regular DVD for my friends without a blu-ray player. Great set if you can get one for a good price buy it.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I enjoy playing this on my D2 and it is very addictive.<br />I recommend this for any with a tablet.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Love the ability to add to on any device. Helps when working on a project with another person we can both add notes.  Also I use it to remember fun life moments with h my kids
B000E6EGXM|5.0|Perhaps it is the opening of a new year, still haunted with wars around the globe - battles on battlegrounds or in the privacy of schoolrooms, theaters, malls, etc - that makes this mighty work by Benjamin Britten so relevant. Being a devoted fan of all of Britten's works - operatic, instrumental, symphonic, song cycles - the shelves bulge with many recordings of all of his works. The WAR REQUIEM alone has many excellent recordings with some individual singers even better than the original soloists found here, but knowing that Britten is sculpting this magnificent work in the manner in which he conceived it makes it all the more moving.<br /><br />This recording is a re-issue from the 1963 original on LPs and the transfer is superb.  Every movement of the work pulses with heartache as only a committed pacifist could create.  The words are from the Latin Requiem Mass as well as the exquisite poetry of Wilfred Owen whose life ended in WW I. The orchestra - London Symphony Orchestra  - the chamber orchestra - Melos Ensemble - and the chorus - Bach Choir, LSO Chorus and Highgate School Choir - and organist - Simon Preston - all give their all. The soloists are a well-selected group - tenor Peter Pears, Britten's life partner, baritone Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau, and soprano Galina Vishnevskaya present as global an ensemble as possible.<br /><br />Some can be disturbed by Vishnevskaya's somewhat squally top register but she has the power to strike lighting form the clouds of war.  The ending of the work is, in this listener's opinion, some of the most heart-wrenchingly beautiful music ever composed.<br /><br />Which recording of the masterpiece is the best?  None.  For complete immersion every lover of Britten's music should own several. Highly recommended, Grady Harp, January 13
B003O86FMW|5.0|When I started I couldn't stop reading.My tv broke but that didn't have nothing to do with it..I had two days off work and all I did was read
B00AA0TJO8|4.0|I got this game when it was offered as the free app of the day.  The game is cute and addictive.  The only things I dislike are when you have to kill the bunny to finish one of the levels after you get the puzzle piece, and the fact that you can get trophies for chopping down lots of trees.
B00005JKQZ|5.0|I have a son with similar mental illness so it was a great to see I am not alone nor is he in this tragic but hopeful outcome . Veey touching very! Thank you
B00AL3KEE8|5.0|The songs/music fit perfectly within the movie. The sound of the vinyl tracks just adds to the authenticity. The soundtrack just added an extra excitement to the movie.
B00A9X9TIW|4.0|While this film is based on an interesting concept, all scientific explanations for the time-travel and telekinesis central to the plot of the film are fastidiously avoided. How does looping work? It just does. Why are some people telekinetic? They just are. Joseph Gordon-Levitt turns in another good performance, but his attempts to mimic Bruce Willis (Gordon-Levitt plays the younger version of the Williz character) are comical at times. There are moments, however, when his mimicry is dead on, so the viewer can overlook the bad bits. The biggest problem with Gordon-Levitt's performance is mot related to his acting. Rather, his eyes are off putting, because they are so steely blue (a la Willis) and unnatural that they come across as creepy. The best part of the movie involves Emily Blunt's character and her telekinetic offspring. Garret Dillahunt, who appears briefly as a bounty hunter, owns every scene that he is in, but alas those scenes are woefully short.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|This one extremely violent. I just  Did not like it as much as the first two. ALL IN ALL GOOD SERIES.
B0018OFN4U|5.0|funny movie i love simon pegg and his humor. some zombies are scary for a comedy i can watch all day
B002ZB26AO|5.0|Loved this book, couldn't put it down.  I wonder what will happen now that Kim Hong UN has taken over.
B0020M99LC|4.0|I've never been a Bond fan, but I watched this movie on the strength of good reviews for Craig's performance and his interaction with Judi Dench as M. I have to say it fulfilled all my hopes. Craig's Bond is less suave and more brutal than his predecessors, but also less sexist. He takes M and the other female characters seriously in a way Connery never could have, which is a pleasure for the female viewer. Real-world technology has caught up to the old Bond fantasies and surpassed them, and so has real-world threat; this Bond operates in a recognizable world of terrorists, billionaires, internet connectivity, surveillance technology. I'll be watching more of Craig's films as Bond and as other characters.
B005LAIIGC|5.0|This film was overlooked when released by most movie goers but not this one.The film was fantastic in every way.
B009HQ9UHC|2.0|Nothing wrong with the software or the installation, but I didn't find this game anywhere near as entertaining as the various Angry Birds interations. I gave up after only a few levels. Other gamers' mileage may vary.
0399157565|5.0|purchased the bone bed as a christmas present. have a family member who loves this series. have read some myself & found out well written & suspenseful...
B004UJTG6Q|4.0|Everyone should read.  Mark Twain.  American Classic.  Free.  Great book.  What more can I say about this book? Get it.
B009S8PEHY|4.0|This was my favorite new album of the Christmas season.  Who knew Rod Stewart could cover these traditional songs so well?  My favorites, however, are the duos--the one with Cee Lo Green and Mary J Blige.  Their voices and the arrangement complemented Stewarts well.
B009FZFONO|4.0|I watch this show and begin to deeply consider if my existence is worth the effort. It helps for me to remember to not take life for granted. Then I go about providing value to others. Yep.
B00APUQT7I|5.0|...and again the perfect funny movie for a family afternoon. Not only for the kids. Even as an adult I always wait for the little weesel trying to hide the big hazelnut - unsuccessfully as we all know but sooooooo funny. Too bad that the story just can't go on and on and on.
031603441X|4.0|The book was a great Stones historical read.  Describes a lot of funny events and spares no details.  However, the book took way too long to finish.  Perhaps, too detailed?
B00APUYWYA|4.0|Nice music and a good script - the story about taking changes to find your strengths, discover your talents and get where you want to go is good in itself. The attached love story is a bit lame, though... but what would be a &#34;girl movie&#34; without it, right? All in all a movie to see at least twice to catch all the details.
0345803507|5.0|Awesome trilogy and I absolutely hated that the series is over.  Read all three books in less than 3 weeks!  Great read for adults only!
B009VB97EY|2.0|Seeing the trailer show I truly expected a bit more of the storyline. The strip scenes are mostly funny and (thank you, director!!) decent enough. The &#34;drug me so I can take this life&#34; topic has been knitted into the script nicely - the viewer never gets to misunderstand the life behind the facade and that quick money is not everything.<br />To all the Channing fans: you'll enjoy it, cause the man has the smoothest moves and he can cry so lovely, you'll never doubt him.<br />To everybody else: a &#34;can see&#34; but not a &#34;must see&#34;.
B004RJMUJO|2.0|This game is very repetative but I can see the draw for other people to play it.  Not for the regular gamer.
B00029D0B0|4.0|Very nicely made parts.  It should be a fun little project.  I would recommend painting instead of using all the little decals.  The instruction booklet is pretty much worthless so you should have a lot of experience before you decide to take this model on ... maybe that is why it has a difficulty rating of 5?  (Added photos of finished model)
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book is so good! Maybe not as good as the first two, but amazingly good nonetheless. It's amazing, really, how Suzanne Collins can write such a great story with cliffhanger on every page!
B009SQRL4U|5.0|We loved this movie!  The visuals were great, and the story line was lots of fun!  There were even parts that my husband and I found ourselves chuckling at.  Definitely a feel good Christmas movie the whole family can enjoy together!
B0043RSK3K|3.0|If you are a history buff you will enjoy it but if you are looking for an adulation of the USA stick to school books with their harmonised and sanctified heroic history.  Few know that the US invaded Russia in 1918, (along with the European powers, ) but there it is in cold print alond with the admiration of Mussolini and Facism....<br />For me it is still a good read.
B002N5N5LG|5.0|Some of the story lines are 'tried and true', but the series itself has an excellent and varied cast, exploits/plays with stereotypes, and builds in a believable way both with plot and character development.  The DVDs include commentaries for each episode.
072325804X|4.0|I love this book. It is beautifully bound and the paper quality is wonderful. However, for one story where normally you would have one illustration on each page with a few sentences. In this book to save page # they put 2-3 illustrations and the content with the image on the page. So the pages look a little too busy for a youngster.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|very mysterious ... enjoyed game ... gotnstuck couple times. brain. teaser. if u enjoy puzzle u will like G5 entertainment,
B004VYYA2K|5.0|Bigger than I expected! The box says it can hold 40 dolls with accessories. Just wanted to mention that because I couldn't find that information on here. Love the designs. Definitely helps my little ones keep their room organized. Arrived on earliest delivery estimate date.
B006LSZECO|2.0|I knew when the first chapters dint grab me that this wasn't a winner...middle of the book is the best- Horrible ending.
B0044C3RB4|5.0|My son and I really enjoyed watching this series.  Thanks Amazon.  Great follow through. Excellent quality and fun to watch
B0096DZKZC|5.0|Great game. Tails and sonic can team up and turn into a team ball. They can also fly together. Tails can get rings and defeat bad guys.
B00APUQPX6|4.0|Just another cute movie fun for all ages.  My favorite part of the whole movie is that silly squirrel and his nut :)
B008KRJWEK|5.0|this game is better than temple run. and it kills subway suffers. I would be better if u got more coins for kills tho.
B00AHSLU2C|5.0|It doesn't matter how many time I or my grandchildren see this movie it's always fun.  The kids cringe during the dentist section of the movie and rally for Nemo and his friends.  Great Movie
B008YRVW0I|5.0|Very engaging game that gradually gets moe challenging yet not impossible.  Creating your own aquarium scenes is fun, but I wish the ornaments could be resized somehow.
B00A9X9ORI|3.0|I liked the movie concept...it was a little hard to follow.  It kept my interest and had some futuristic concepts that I really liked and were believeable.  If you just like science fiction for the concepts of possibilities then this is for you.  Get ready to hold on for the many changes of direction so you can keep up with the story line as it takes you backward and forward.
B006BDHAX0|5.0|I love the Mahjong Deluxe HD.<br /><br /> I like the way the games are set up.  It is fun to play different versions.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|You should really buy this if you can purchase it for $20 like I did. It was so AWESOME to watch all of these again in HD. The extra footage incorporated into the films is also a welcome addition. My only complaint is the packaging as it makes you slide the disc between cardstock which could lead to fingerprints/scratches on the discs.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Hopeless is without a doubt one of the most powerful stories I've ever read. I was intrigued, swooned off my rocker, giggled at the wit between Holder and Sky, reduced to a quivering, huddled teary-eyed wreck. I stayed up until 3:30 am on Christmas morning to finish Hopeless, knowing my kids would be up by 6:00 am. I did not regret that decision. The way in which Colleen told this story... my mind is blown. I cannot recommend Hopeless highly enough. But, be sure to have tissues on hand. Read this.
B00005JKLZ|4.0|Have been looking for this movie for years. Found it here at a great price. Now my collection has a great movie.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|I'm extremely critical of most apps and I'm happy to say that this impressed me.  The gameplay is fantastic.  I love the creative aspect of being able to draw/create my own characters.  It has a fun storyline that is easy enough for a child to eventually figure out,  but challenging enough for an adult to enjoy.  It doesn't have any in app purchases as far as I can tell.  Definitely 5 stars.  You won't be dissapointed!
B009G56RN4|2.0|It is hard to like the characters and the story was not interesting enough unless you are interested in oil.
B004QOB8SO|5.0|Love this series, one of the best interpretations of the Sherlock Holmes stories out there. Not to mention it makes a smashing Christmas gift. Everyone should watch it.
B000I5XOVY|1.0|I received a bad CD that refused to work in 3 different players. This was a Christmas present, making matters worse. No more CD orders from Amazon for me. I'll pay extra for a functional product.
0525953728|2.0|I BOUGHT THIS BOOK WITH A LOT OF ANTICIPATION.  TOO MUCH ABOUT OTHER SEAL GOINGS ON.  I WANTED MORE ON THE BUILD UP TO THE BIN LADEN KILLING.  FOR ME IT WAS JUST &#34;OK&#34;!
0374214913|4.0|After reading the reviews here, I selected \\"Mr. Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore\\" for my book club, knowing something \\"bookish\\" would be a great start to 2013. Not to my surprise, I didn't end up heeding the established month-long deadline to read it -- I gobbled it up within several days. This novel is truly the perfect modern blending of how we have used, do use, and will continue to use words: on the printed page and the virtual one, in beautiful handwriting and chicken scratch and centuries-old fonts and in footed e-ink. For those of us still struggling to set aside \\"real books\\" for e-readers, \\"Mr. Penumbra\\" proves a particular charmer, allowing you to love the entire spectrum of reading. It's as though this novel is singing Gloria Gaynor's \\"I Will Survive;\\" it's no wonder the word \\"delightful\\" is used in several reviews.<br /><br />The plot follows a young man, Clay, who begins working at a peculiar bookstore. When he becomes involved in the bookstore's ancient mystery (think: very few real customers, books he's forbidden from reading, and some bizarre clientele), he uses modern tools to decode the truth. A happy roller coaster of reading, I highly recommend it.
B005D5FJJ4|5.0|This is a another great book from the master of Fiction...another book that was hard to put down.  It was only a little over 200  pages, that was the only problem...could have read much more.  Keep those books coming Mr. King!!!
B0002F6BRE|5.0|This is a great movie.  I love Will Ferrell and this is a kid friendly Will Ferrell movie.  My 9 year old didnt' want to see it at first, but I finally got him to and he thought it was funny.

1419705849|5.0|Another great &#34;Wimpy Kid&#34; book.  My 9 year old had to read for 30 minutes for school at night and he easily read this the whole time.  He really enjoys them and I like that these are stories with drawings, instead of just comics.

B004SDEP38|5.0|This is basically a mobile version of Microsoft Office, and it definitely lives up to that.  It does word processing, spreadsheets and slideshows just like a computer does them, and they're also compatible with one another (opening/viewing files).  To be able to start something on your computer and finish or utilize it on your phone, or jot notes on your phone (or start a complete project from scratch) and then touch it up on a computer for a nice finished product for work, school or pleasure, it's definitely a good app to have with you.
B004H1V5RU|4.0|This product is very good. Eveyone in the family enjoys trying to navigate the maze.<br />Only constructive criticism is that after some &#34;events&#34; the ball is hard to locate.
0062213423|5.0|I got this book for my sister for her birthday and she absolutely loved it.  It's everything she expected it to be and is definitely of high quality (pages, printing, etc.) material.  Was a great price, shipped quickly and brought a smile to her face.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This app has many different versions and reading plans. Easy to use and read from. The various reading plans allow you to read alone or with others.
B006C1DH92|5.0|You would think that this is the same game as the original version, and while you're technically right, it's like loading up the original with all new bonus stuff to unlock.  I love the deck of cards blade, it's probably my favorite one on here, and the reason I prefer this one over the non-sponsored version of the game.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This is a great book! This series is amazing if you haven't read it you really need too. I love reading and this is by far my favorite series!
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|I thought this was another boring game bu to my suprise this game is very fun and learning few things along the way haha. I will recomend this game to my friends
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|Although I'm not old enough to remember the good days of the 80s, where a coin operated machine was you're entertainment, I could really connect to the book. It always kept me on my toes, and that's what I really like in a book. I loved this book and it showed me the geeks of the past up to the geeks of the future.
B009G7ZYUO|4.0|The real highlights of the package are the book, which has new liner notes from Chuck D that are right on point in explaining the band's, and this album's, significance, as well as the inclusion of a 180 gram vinyl edition that sounds excellent.  As for the remastered CD, there is really nothing special about it.  I really could not tell any audio difference from the original CD version.  The live material included is also worth getting as well, particularly for the footage of the band's first live performance.  Even that showed how good they were.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|A very interesting suggestive futuristic story line. A challenging  story line showing of how to survive in the wild under difficult circumstances.
B00APUYN0I|5.0|It would be this movie. The music is good, the lines are clever, and the performances solid, particularly from Rebel Wilson, who steals almost every scene in which she appears.  Plus, the movie incorporates &#34;Breakfast Club&#34; in an appropriately reverential way, including Simple Minds' &#34;Don't You Forget About Me.&#34;
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I thought this book was very sad and emotional. I cried a lot in this book, but I have always enjoyed these story's. Suzanne Collins I can't see how you come these. I lo scythe ending about her children.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|This was a good read, kind of sad, but worth the trouble.  I can relate to Charlie.  I remember my high school years, and it was all peaches and cream.
B00000ITOY|5.0|Our 10mo loves this toy, even though he isn't developmentally ready to take full advantage of it.  It's well-made and sturdy; the only challenge, of course, will be to hold on to all the pieces until he outgrows it.  Don't forget to try putting  the pieces on one peg and swinging them around--that's geometry, too.  Plan is one of our favorite toy companies.<br /><br />Update: The 10mo  is now 3 1/2.  While that was happening, a few pieces got lost and another few got chewed on by the dog, so I bought a second set for little sister.  Now I'm buying a third for another grandchild (who doesn't have a dog).  If it weren't for the dog and the Lost Dimension of Toys, our first set would still be perfect.  Great toy.
B00A0SKFLG|4.0|I really liked this version. I liked it more than the Arnold version. it is more true to the notion of memory and what is reality.
B004VMVTNU|5.0|If you are looking for an app that allows you to wake to music on your Kindle Fire, this is it.  Set up a playlist of songs you want to wake to and then select that playlist when you set up the alarm.  Unlike another app that claims to do this, this app actually does and not just a song but a playlist!  To me that makes it well worth paying for.  I have tried several alarm apps on my Kindle Fire and this is the only one I have found that plays a playlist for an alarm and this app has all the other features you would want in an alarm.
B00APUYWYA|4.0|I shouldn't like this but it was fun and the music was outstanding. What a wonderfully talented group of actors. It's not 'Les Mis' but is far better than 'Rock of Ages'.
B000IAZPKM|5.0|It takes a pretty awesomely shot and performed concert DVD for me to even make an effort to review it...and this one has hit the TOP.<br /><br />Kamelot really did this up right, as well as serving up one hell of a concert.  This is probably the last real full concert you can see with the legendary Khan since he quit the band in 2012, so enjoy this legendary symphonic metal singer at this best, with all the cool props for songs like 'Elizabeth' (my fave), and his duets with Simone that are simply awesome...and of course the rest!!<br /><br />Depending on the one you buy, you can get a 'bonus DVD'.  I was curious to see some interviews with Kamelot and the other bonus 'stuff', but now that I have seen it all, well, it is not exactly the greatest stuff - but for a fan like me, the extra 3 bucks was worth it to me.  Up to you!<br /><br />Kamelot rocks - enjoy the DVD at full volume!!!
B004Z2TUGE|3.0|All around fun movie. For me it wasn't a movie to see over and over again. For a rent, it was fun and worth the price.
B008RZF2I0|5.0|Without over-stating what many reviews have done already, let me say that Tommy Karevik has stepped into the HUGE shoes of Khan...and really pulled it off, as well as adding his own flair.  And on the music side, this is WAY far ahead of the past 2 CD's.  Black Halo & Karma are hard to beat, but Ghost Opera and Poetry had fewer moments of that Kamelot greatness I love that I was VERY skeptical on even bothering with this one (let alone the Khan thing)...DON'T!!!!<br /><br />The beautiful sound and packaging of Silverthorn tells me that Kamelot are 'back' and here to stay - new singer and all, as well as some of the BEST music they have ever done.  What I really like about this CD is that it 'grows' on you - great the first time and better with every listen, instead of the alternatively disappointing 'I have listened to this 20+ times but nothing there' (been there, done that, hoping for the magic).  No, this is NOT Black Halo, but to get even close to that high again...you can find it in Silverthorn.  The female duets are great too (as some of my fave Kamelot songs had Simone from Epica singing with Khan), but to tell you the truth, these new female singers they got for this CD are awesome too!!! (miss ya Simone!!)
1583334386|5.0|This book is unique in its treatment of the subject of will power in that it not only covers the physiological factors that influence self-control but even the lesser understood psychological and even social factors. The book is also very practical in its suggestions and recommended exercises. The chapter summaries are a very accurate synopsis of the main intent, points, and recommendations made in the chapter, making it easy to come back to a particular section for review.<br /><br />This book is highly recommended for any who seek to learn about themselves - the science and the motivations behind our actions. It is also a great guide for those of us who struggle with our resolutions and genuinely seek to understand and transcend the obstacles that keep us from meeting our goals. For any interested in constant self-improvement and self-growth, this work is not to be missed.
0894803123|4.0|This is a great book for the history of Ben and Jerry and of Ben and Jerry's ice cream business.  The recipes that I have used so far are great, but I expected more recipes.  I can't wait till spring and summer to use the fresh fruit in the ice cream.  It is a great book for beginning ice cream makers, which I definitely am!
B0073COMKW|5.0|I expected this to give off a weird looking hue, but it actually looks wonderful. I'm done with those money-draining old school bulbs that burn out in like a month.
B002RI9UBS|5.0|Not the type of book I would normally read but it was refreshing change. Learnt a lot about animal behaviour, it was a lovely read.
B00AMBK0X4|4.0|It's hangover kind of humor but not as funny.  I would watch it again but not sure I would own it.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I LOVED this novel!  Extremely well woven, lots of surprises, the reader is constantly forced to review his/her judgements and rethink the likely storyline.  I don't want to give anything away, so .... I highly recommend this book!
B007ZGBZHE|3.0|I think the authors reached a bit too far on the plot on this one.  They've clearly set up for a sequel yet again, but each new installment in Pendergast seems to get less vibrant and more forced.  Where is the Pendergast of the Museum days or even the Crow days?
B0076DCT2G|2.0|I have always loved Nelson DeMille's books and can't wait for the next one to come out. Unfortunately I was really disappointed in this one. It seems like the purpose of the book was to give everyone a history lesson on Yeman. And that lesson just went on and on. Not the usual action that you have with his books. I love John Corey, but I was even disappointed in him this time. I am really hoping that his next book will be his regular writing style.
B0055PMJMW|4.0|I enjoyed the short stories.  Some seemed to end too fast and too pat, but were still well-written.  This is an easy read and a great way to fill some open time.
B004LWZWGA|4.0|I really hope they come out with another move to go along with this one. I won't give away any spoilers or anything but this one was not as good as the first and second. There are parts I totally did not understand and just don't add up. That being said still worth seeing though!
B0076DCT2G|2.0|Did not really enjoy this book much at all.  The plot was weak and the basic premise was suspect at best.  I was hoping for more out of the book.
B007HACDLK|4.0|Every one of Vince Flynn's Mitch Rap books has been fun and engaging,  this is no exception.  Get the whole set.  It makes my day when there is another availale
B007GCY8FS|4.0|Child continues with his Reacher character in a fairly typical mode.  Jack Reacher has to be the most unlucky guy in the world.  Everywhere he turns, he seems to run into trouble.  The plot is well-done and reasonably well-paced.  The other characters are reasonably well-developed.  If you like Jack Reacher, you'll like this one.
B003K05DQS|4.0|Matt Damon does well in action movies ( Bourne series etc.)  and the action is well done in this story.  It takes you to the streets of Bahgdad at the beginning of the second gulf war.  The story line, as fiction, is compelling.<br /><br />Unfortunately it presents a spin on reality that advances a 'Bush lied, people died' agenda.  There have been several movies that have in one degree or another presented the war with an agenda other than a true or close to true light .  Green Zone is probably the most subtle or least offending of the batch.<br /><br />If you look past the spin and discount it as anything but a story that takes a real event as a backdrop, it is fun to watch.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Well written,with humor and grace, and so fascinating I couldn't put it down  . Like no other book I've read.  Brutal and gentle,at once a  triumph of spirit and a wrenching horror story.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I think this is a good game and would recommend it to others. However,  I wish there was a way to contact the other party regarding a hint or clue.
B0018HC4BM|4.0|This is how the hole thing got its start. Young Mel Gibson in one of his first big roles on his way to the big screen. Great job .
0399226907|5.0|I bought this as a gift.  I loved reading it to my daughter.  I liked how the catepillar ate too much.... sound familiar.
B009JBZH54|5.0|Keeps you into the movie with lots of action . Great for family enjoyment. perfect for any collector of Batman movies.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I don't know what I was expecting from this book but I was totally surprised. I really enjoyed the story through a dog's perspective, I laughed and cried throughout the story. I recommend this book completely!
B002M9WW30|5.0|What can you say about a complete collection of Rocky films?  Add the fact they are on Blu-Ray?  Come on.<br /><br />The quality of the Blu-Ray images is the best I've seen from movies which were shot on film and transferred to digital media.  When these movies were originally shot, the filmmakers never imagined people watching them on high definition, large screen televisions.  These films (Rocky I-IV) were filmed to be watched on movie screens.  A movie screen won't show things like film grain which is inherent in the film itself, but when you transfer that film to digital high def media, all the flaws become very obvious.  I guess you just have to look past it or avoid films shot in the 20th century which have very bright and very dark parts where the grain is most obvious.<br /><br />The films themselves are well-reviewed and I'd venture to guess almost everyone who would consider buying this has seen most of them already so I'll only rate them as I like them.  Believe it or not, I like Rocky III best of all only because Mr. T is incredibly awesome and completely terrifying in his movie debut (I also liked him later in the underrated [[ASIN:B0006IIPJO D.C. Cab]] which, as of this writing, is not yet on Blu-Ray).  It turned out to be the beginning of a very colorful career for him.  My second favorite is Rocky II because of the opposite ending from Rocky I, which is my third favorite.  I put Rocky Balboa as fourth on the list only because it completely beat my expectations and turned out to be a good film.  Rocky IV is a fun but ridiculous and predictable piece of fluff (when the Russians start rooting for Rocky the film enters sci-fi realm).  I really didn't like Rocky V much at all, but it's nice to have it in the set.  I don't know, I guess maybe Stallone was just in a bad phase then; just trying to make something work to keep cashing in on Rocky.<br /><br />I like Stallone.  I think he's an American original whose body of work is incredibly inconsistent but contains enough classics (a few are in this set) to vault him into legendary status.  I'm glad he's climbed back into the spotlight with the surprisingly enjoyable [[ASIN:B008Y6WPXC \\"The Expendables\\"]] franchise.<br /><br />All together this is an outstanding set of movies with digital transfer that is as good as it's going to get. I grew up with these movies and it has been great fun watching them again, in order, with my kids.ontains enough classics (a few are in this set) to vault him into legendary status.

B005LAII12|5.0|My daughter asked for this movie for Christmas.  I found it here a lot cheaper than the local stores.  She loved it.
B007EECSFA|4.0|Another good one from Kate Morton. We read one of her books for our book club ... And I've now read everything else she's written. I also liked the tie-ins to WW2, a time Period  I like reading.
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|I rented this movie to show my kids.  We used to own it, but I couldn't find it anywhere.  They loved it.
0545425115|5.0|I borrowed the book from the library to read 5 years ago. It took the movie to finally get my son interested and willing to read it. He's now finished the trilogy ... I had book 2 in hard cover and book 3 on my Kindle ...so that was his first Kindle book :)
B009SQRL4U|5.0|We watched this movie as a family.  My kids loved it.  I will probably purchase it to watch again and again.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|The Perks of Being a Wallflower was a quick read, and provided light entertainment. This is a book written for the middle school and high school student. I would recommend this book for a weekend book.
B000O8OTNC|4.0|Small and easy to carry. This would be great for camping and put a good edge on Kershaw knife I carry around in my pocket.
B000VZYPB4|5.0|I always thought that I would be too stupid to understand the comedy in the show but boy was I wrong!!!
B006LSZECO|1.0|I liked it until the last 20 or so pages.  In fact, I disliked the ending so much that I was sorry that I read it.
B0094M2O7C|5.0|I love watching the Underworld movies it is one my favorite movie series. I can watch it again and again.
B008ETOSYI|4.0|I liked the book and enjoyed the movie. While Zac Efron still has some growing to do as a serious actor, this was an excellent effort. He is not 100% believable as a soldier, but enough so that he fit into the story well. I loved Taylor Schilling as Beth. Nicholas Sparks writes a simple love story with great characters. My one wish is that he would flesh them out more, give them a lot more depth and breadth which would translate into a better move. As far as a good movie to watch for a easy relaxing evening, this is a good choice.
B00AMBK0X4|4.0|I liked the movie it kept me interested and laughing the entire time.  I think it would be for adults more than children.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Never have I been more drawn to a book than I have with this trilogy, it's absolutely a wonderful book, I couldn't put it down...
B00006I53S|3.0|This lens is alright, but that's about it. It offer's a very nice zoom range but being a kit lens you don't really expect L quality. The build quality is alright, but it felt like with a little effort I could probably take off the rubberized zoom ring. It focuses quite fast and images compare to that of other low-end lenses in the category (18-55, 55-200, 18-200)
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Look people I have this game on every device and on every device it uploaded to subway surfers New York city but on this device it didn't so that is stupid how could you do that on other stuff but not on this one I'm only ten but it's a fun and good game for all ages
B008QTVNUI|5.0|Could not wait for next episode. A great thriller. Do not know how much is true. Better than 24. Definitely recommend.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|Does what it says and does it well.  Using it in my Kindle Fire.  It makes it easy to keep my Kindle in good shape.
B0009ZHJ7S|5.0|It is a really funny movies for all ages. It has the word &#34;Butt&#34; and &#34;What the!&#34; but other then that I don't think there is any bad words and no sexy stuff. Unless you think talking about someone having a big butt is sexy. Kids loved it from 3+
B005BRS8Z6|1.0|I don't like books like the Secret and this feels as one of those books with inhuman and unrealistic advice.
B008HT4FUW|5.0|We really love this series and I was so happy to get it for a very good price.  The quality of this box set to great!
B000W91RUG|5.0|Just have to have this season first so we all could watch it.  Was very excited that it came right away!
B005HSL626|4.0|I purchased this game for my son.  He loves it.  I haven't tried it myself, but I have watched him play.  Great graphics and pretty accurate too.
B001HN697M|5.0|Ordered this movie to go with our Underworld Collection!  Plus this is one of my favorite movies.  Just couldnt wait to get it and now I think that I have watched it a few to many times.  That ok!  Always cant wait to watch it!
B00AMBK0X4|4.0|The movie was sort of like watching family guy. I watched with my younger brother. While I did like it and found parts to be hilarious, my brother enjoyed it more than I did. I probably wouldn't watch it again just because its not really my type of movie but I know for my brother, he'd probably watch it over and over again.
B001FB4VXU|5.0|Bought this to go with my husbands collection of movies and shows.  He and our son love to watch this show!  I didnt like it at first and now Im watching it!
B008L1DNGI|3.0|Good game however in battle mode it lags on my razor. If not for it would have a better star rating.
B0006AAS5G|5.0|This indeed a great product. I would indeed recommend individuals looking for great watch to purchase this one!!!! Great product!!
B004LWZWGK|3.0|I HAD HIGH HOPES FOR THE DARK KNIGHT RISES BUT IAM SAID THE WAY THE TRILOGY ENDED I WONT REVEAL SPOILERS THE MOVIE HAS LOTS OF ACTION SCENES BUT THE FIRST HOUR WASTED WAS PRETTY BORING WITH LOTS OF TALKING AND MINOR ACTION HERE AND THERE HOWEVER THE SECOND HALF OF THE MOVIE REALLY PICKS UP STEAM SO IF YOUR A BATMAN FAN ITS A MUST BUY SPECIALLY THE BLURAY/DVD COMBO AT 18 BUCKS THAT A AWESOME PRICE.
0345803485|5.0|As a person who rarely finds enjoyment from reading, I was not ever able to put this series down. You easily find yourself connecting to the characters. I often had to stop myself from glancing ahead because i desperately wanted to know more! Must read!
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I enjoyed most of the book and the underlying story.  I do think it was pretty well written and the author brought you into the characters.
B005XTLAQQ|3.0|It was a lovely doll but mine had a small defect on the back of the dress.  It looks like it did not get glued properly.  I will keep it rather than returning because I hate returning stuff.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Bestselling author sparks another funny and interesting book. If you have not read it, get it because it is amazing!
B000JMLFLW|5.0|i enjoyed this download also and the item was exactly as advertised... i will be downloading more stuff to read in the future.
B00005JOA0|1.0|I know it's a classic and by Ann Bronte, but it is horribly sad and hard to watch.  It is also too graphic with adult content for my taste.<br />We ended up throwing our copy away.<br /><br />I think I'll stick to \\"Jane Eyre\\" or \\"Wuthering Heights\\" if I want a Bronte movie.
B000JQU1VS|5.0|i also enjoyed this download and the item was exactly as advertised... i will be downloading more stuff to read in the future.
B00A4YVHXQ|5.0|fun for the kids. i do not know if more songs have to be bought or are  made available. the kids havn't informed me yet.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Just as good as the first book, maybe even better. Now you know the characters and have a bond. A wonderful ironic twist or two to make it difficult to put the book down.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|LOVE the Hungers Games - along with the rest of the books in the Trilogy! Much better than the movie, too!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This was a very entertaining novel. You'll get caught up in the story and not be able to put it down.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I read this mainly because of all the hype that's been created around the controversy of the story. It's probably around chapter 7 or 8 that it gets rather &#34;detailed.&#34; However, I don't think the controversy is as big a deal as some make it out to be - it's a lifestyle that the characters chose for themselves. While it's not everyone's cup of tea, it was still an interesting story, although not the best quality of writing. I'll eventually read the other two books in the series, but not running to the book store to read.
0425252868|5.0|I finished this book several days ago and cannot stop thinking about it.<br />A Higher Call really brings to life what these men experienced and the<br />sacrifice they made for their country. I knew the basic facts about the war,<br />but had no idea the conditions these pilots flew under.<br /><br />I'm so glad Franz and Charlie got their story out before they died. And<br />I'm grateful the author had the passion for their story to get it out there.<br />Loved the pictures too, and found myself looking up specific characters<br />and planes as I read about them.<br /><br />Read the book and share their story. It must not be lost or forgotten. I will<br />encourage my children and grandchildren to read it. It's an amazing story,<br />and in this crazy world, we all need reminded to keep our humanity.<br /><br />Can't wait to read the next one!
B004LLDN3A|5.0|It is amazing that a movie that I have seen so many times can still bring such joy. It was especially fun since I was able to share it with my 16 year old daughter. We loved it . . . again!
B0051QIGP4|2.0|I loved Lady GaGa's first album.  It's was fresh!  This one, it sort of so so, but all the hype really did not help.  Still an interesting listen, but I don't LOVE it as much.<br /><br />Even at 99 cents I felt I paid too much for this.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|My 8 year old loves this app and played with it for a long time. I had to make her put it down. Loads of fun and creativity
B007SGLZP8|5.0|What can I say?  It's vintage Grisham!  An excellent plot that I don't want to reveal in any way.<br />The usual great read from Grisham.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Absolutely loved this book!  Its Just fantastic! I Highly recommend this book!  I can't to read more of Colleen Hoover's books!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Other than the slowness of the countdown to coins, I'm enjoying this game.  I imagine it was created to work with Facebook which does explain slowness of getting new coins -- play while doing other things on! FB.
B0012GTZC0|5.0|Very good, excellent reading for WW ll fans! Sound factual details and suspense novel that holds your attention!<br />Great novel!
B008XG1X18|4.0|This product works as I would expect it to, my only problem is my aging eyes.  I wish I could enlarge it because it is pretty small on a phone.  You can select a pin and when the app just focuses on that one pin it's easier to see but then I find myself spending a lot more time waiting for loads than actually browsing the pins.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Great book...would recommend it!! Very intense all the way thru and kept you on your feet the whole time. Wonderful
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I loved the second book more so than the first book. I did not really like the first book much, but it held my interest.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Would recommend.  It is a great book! Very interesting, but not the way I imagined it would end...hope they make a movie next!
B007IXWL2C|4.0|I enjoyed reading all three of the Fifty Shades of Grey by E L James.  They are a nice fantasy to escape in.
B00192IV0O|5.0|Great cd for a great price. My wife says it is the best money i have spent so far on Amazon.
B0058YPGSY|5.0|This series is a completely absorbing bit of fiction.  It has my favorite character actor playing the least moral character in the series.
B008NW67E0|5.0|I love this Cd. I wish they had some concert venues closer to my home. Very good, you should buy it.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|This Bible app is great! But sometimes I find it difficult to navigate. I hats that the review has to be a minimum of 20 words. I won't write another review.
B007SPPANM|4.0|Can't stand him - but,it's a wonderful movie, nonetheless.<br />I had also hoped not to have to switch out discs - but, what the hey.
1593082037|4.0|Great price for  these volumes.  I have not read any of Conan Doyle's work before, and I am enjoying these stories.
B00AB0AR2U|2.0|As a fan of this series, retribution does not live up to the others. Don't waste your time on this one.
B009D0LBRO|4.0|Great graphics and sound, fun, the only problem is it erased the game progress when updating to a new version.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I started reading this book due to a recommendation from a friend. I didn't really know what to expect going into it, but I'm sure glad it turned out great.<br /><br />It took me about a day and a half to complete reading it. I was so captivated by the characters, especially Sky and Holder. So many secrets, yet so much happiness. I laughed, I cried. I couldn't take my eyes off of it!<br /><br />I'm definitely going to check out Colleen Hoover's other books. Brava.
B0000024ZT|5.0|Never got this back in the day .  Wish I had. Classic rock, fun great in car CD drive .  No I dont use an ipod doc in the car. I am old.
B006WQLH7G|5.0|Works really great.  I am always happy with Avast products. I use Avast on all of my tablets and computers.
B009VB9VKY|4.0|Surprising story line - more than the standard 'chick flick'.<br />Oh...lighten up guys! It was fun!<br />I liked the Tampa setting too.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|This is the first book I have read on this subject which has truly helped me to understand the reason for my failed marriages.<br />And gives me hope that I might one day be able to sustain a healthy relationship.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|BOOK WAS OVERALL INTERESTING. GRISHAM again throws a curve to the plot and brings it all together towards the final chapter. I ENJOYED THE BOOK AND READ IT WHILE WHILE IN THE HOSPITAL ROTATING WATCH ON MY DAUGHTER. A ROUGH TIME MADE INTERESTING.<br />I COULD ENVISION MANY OF THE PASSAGES, ACTION AND ACTIVITY THROUGHOUT MOST OF THE BOOK. I ONLY QUESTIONED THE HANDLING OF THE GOLD.<br />THIS IS THE TWELFTH GRISHAM BOOK THAT I'VE READ. WON'T BE THE LAST.......
B008RA3X5E|1.0|This clock doesn't do anything it says. The clock doesn't even keep proper time.  I need multi alarms for medications and these had to be reset daily. This was just a totally disappointing clock.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|Five star movie. Loved seeing hometown location. Pittsburgh looks great on screen. One of the best batman movie. Loved it
B001O8D47S|5.0|My future daughter in-law and I watched this on a cold winter afternoon while the guys were watching football. What a pleasant surprise! The story was very realistic without sex and violence that would have made it uncomfortable to watch with my son's young fiance. So settle in with a bottle of wine, the mani-pedi tools and enjoy this movie with a girl friend!
B009B0L324|1.0|AC/DC fans will love to rock out with the Masters of Rock. The recordings are great, the hits keep coming song after song.
1592402038|4.0|Very funny book. Never thought that grammar would be enjoyable but in this case it is. The humor infectious and illustrates very effectively what the author is trying to get across. Wish I would have had this book when I went through high school.
B003A4IFGY|5.0|Tom Petty and the Heart Breakers Put out another classic rock album!! The writting of the songs and th musicall performance is all Petty fans expect!!
030758836X|1.0|Pathetic ending. He killed, she killed. I want to kill myself after reading this book. I don't get it. I thought for sure that my copy was missing pages. I feel a little dumber for having read it. Waste of time & money!
B009GESJH2|5.0|KID ROCK out do'es himself on this album. The songs are great and fun. The New Years song is super!!
B005GRTNVE|3.0|Overall, good.  The accoustics in the first part of the concert were on the poor side and the guys weren't at their shining best.  However, they did warm up with the London Philharmonic Orchestra adjusting to their needs.  Once this happened, I thoroughly enjoyed the rest of the concert....of course, kicking myself for not being able to make use of my tickets to see the monumentally popular Il Divo live in Brisbane, in Jan 2012.<br /><br />For this concert, they seem to have changed their usual style of who sings with whom, partnering Carlos with David quite often and hearing less of the old David and Urs combination.  It's good to try different things with the singers but I have to say I prefer the beautiful tenor voices of Urs and David together, with Carlos coming in with his strong bass sound, usually towards the end of a song or verse.  And Sebastien, as usual fits in well, anywhere and with anyone - but very often being the 'starter'.  However, having said what I did about my preference of voice combinations, the slightly different one in this concert was, nonetheless, very refreshing and enjoyable.<br /><br />I gave this concert 3 stars purely because of the difficulty, in the opening part, of being able to hear the group clearly above the orchestra.  If not for that, then easily a 4 star rating.
B008ELUEQC|4.0|Rod Stewart proves he can do any type of song and do it well. The collaborations are great and the songs are beautifly performed!!!
B005M2V2K8|5.0|So cute.  The kids love it.  I had to get another to keep the kids from fighting.  All is fine now!
B008LZHA3G|4.0|Bob Dylan is absolutely classic Bob Dylan in this album. It's a little bit sedate but he lyrics are Bob Dylan!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Very different kind of story. At first I was not a fan of kids killing kids, but this book has grown on me and I really came to like it. The interactions are very vivid and real. You get caught up in the story and grow to care very much for them. It is heartbreaking in spots and joyful in others. It is very worth it to read. Enjoy. Happy reading!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I love this story. This is a great one to read over and over. I think children and adults alike can take away important messages from the plot.
B00A757EFW|3.0|Fun, but the game cuts off after a certain amount of time and it can be frustrating because you can never go beyond the second board.
B00AMBH70S|5.0|I really enjoyed the movie. My husband and son watched as well and they were thrown by it. Great movie....
B0034G4ORC|2.0|another completely ridiculous film. some good scenes<br />many bad ones, good effects, gone astray. you still need<br />a story and a writer to make a good movie, even though<br />you would think the producers dont care.
0425263916|5.0|I couldn’t put this book down but I tried slowing down at the end considering the next edition will not be out until May 2013.  I completed the book in two days.  If you had the pleasure of reading the Fifty Shades of Gray Trilogy this is a good pick but it’s more detailed and not one sided.  Both characters have the same insecurities and the story is good.  Excellent pick but don’t forget to pre order the next book.
B00498TQV8|5.0|There are some films that leave you breathless because they take you on an 80-mile-an-hour ride from the opening scene onward. This isn't that film but it's still absolutely worth seeing. Winter's Bone explores family, fear, loss and survival through the eyes of a young girl trying to keep the delicate and worn threads of her family in tact as best as she can. Aside from the fact that the acting is above par, the gritty themes this film serves up compels the viewer to look beyond the pace that is often slow but for good reason.  Winter's Bone takes you through one facet of a teenaged girl's rough life in the Ozarks, one that forces her to mature quickly in the face of an absent and wayward father, a mentally incapacitated mother and two younger siblings who still need the guidance of at least one parent. Ree is determined to provide for her family in spite of her father's irresponsible brush with the law that seemingly jeopardizes the very roof over her family's head. What makes this film poignant is that Ree does not succumb to breathless desperation and hopelessness when she faces barriers in almost every direction - her steely demeanor sometimes reveals emotional chinks in her armor but never gives way to a completely helpless caricature of a teen in distress. Ree is not one of those over-the-top heroine figures that can do anything without batting an eye.  She is believably strong, teaching her young siblings to face their fears while she stares down her own.  The story also lightly touches upon the second- and third-order effects of a drug culture invading a community already unraveling from poverty.<br /><br />There is a line in this film that resonates, especially during one of the final scenes.  While teaching her younger siblings to prep freshly-shot squirrels for a meal, which includes skinning and gutting, Ree tells her younger brother that sometimes he's going to have to do things he doesn't want to do but has to.  This line sums up the finer points of this film perfectly without piling on cliche after cliche.  You aren't watching it for the action, the skin, the pretty faces or glossy special effects. Yes, it is \\"real\\" and rough around the edges but eventually takes on a slightly predictable tone at the very end. So don't fret - Winter's Bone isn't completely drenched in depressing currents of realism. Just enough to make you want something to work out for this down-and-out teen...and it does, artfully but with little fanfare.
0140278710|2.0|small paperback, pretty yellowed out pages..the description in the website is too generic, hard to distinguish from many other great used books I have previously purchased. Either the book seller should sell it at a negative number and make up for its true value when adding the overpriced handling/shipping costs or drop the shipping/handling costs.
B0091Q82L8|4.0|We've been hearing about the Hull show for decades and now it's out...there's flashes of brilliance and overall it's bombastic as you'd expect..but there's funny mixes at times that should have been evened out...it doesn't crash like Leeds except for the over high drum mix of Moonie. Still any die hard Who fan needs this recording..despite no new songs from the Leeds show unfortunately.
B004JN1CW4|2.0|I thought the first one was great. Second was not as good as the first, but this one?! HUH? So much of it didn't make sense!<br /><br />Mysteries hinted in the first book never came to fruition. (i.e. When Thomas first gets to the Glade, he's surprised that his voice is so high. Later he's shocked to find that he's 16. He feels older. He has fleeting memories of creating the maze. I took all this to mean that he somehow was a younger clone or had been... de-aged? I don't know, but I was looking forward to finding out! Maybe a confrontation with his \\"older\\" self. But... nothing. Nothing ever came of that. Nothing came of ANYTHING!)<br /><br />It's just a bummer. The whole series just fell apart with this last book. Character's actions making NO sense (why WOULDN'T he want his memories back?!) It didn't even need to be written. Should have ended it with the second book.
B009LDXQGW|5.0|awesome, i was expecting it to take a while to arrive but was very impress that it arrived earlier than expected
B009JBZH54|5.0|This is not a collectors edition with a broken Bat Mask or hours and hours of extras. This is, as titled, the Blu-Ray trilogy of Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight with a sample art book containing several interesting photos. The Trilogy was great, obviously I'm not going to go on in details of any reviews of the actual films because I got exactly what I expected. Great movies inside a nice box with no problems on any discs: simply put, 5 stars!
B0000DIXDR|5.0|I got this movie because God rest his soul every woman seemed to love Patrick Swayze! Hes a great actor in a great movie that my wife absolutely adores! Thats why i got her Ghost also it was a great combo. But i would use the people that sold Dirty Dancing again it was great delivery! Gotta keep the wife happy!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is a great app! I love the big buttons and general size of the calculator. I definitely would recommend to others.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Absolutely amazing can't wait to finish the other books!!!<br /><br /> It was almost impossible to put the book down from the moment I began reading....
0449806979|5.0|I loved every minute of reading this book: it is written in an excellent way and it is informative and unbiased. I highly recommend it.
B00992CF6W|4.0|Don't get me wrong. This game is great. But it's very limited to the pc version. No armor or Redstone mechanisms(though they say they're making an update for it) no iron bars, no ender or nether( though there are nether reactors) and no naturals and a few other blocks are missing. I still recommend it though.
B004J2TPSI|4.0|My MP3 player didn't have bluetooth so I purchased this to go along with it.  Unfortunately it sends some of the songs, I know are stereo, across as mono which means I only get music in one ear.  I can use the bluetooth from my desktop and the same songs come across in stereo.  Other than that feature it works well.  It is easily paired and works well.  It was worth the price when I bought it.
B0054R6BFM|5.0|This book made me think about the signs I get from people and how to read them and how we all think of different things and go through school different<br />Alexandra Unruh
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|i have to say that this version is the most fun by far.  The music, characters, and settings put you right into the Star Wars world.  My favorite part is the Vader pig that laughs at you when you fail a level.  Thank You and keep em coming.
B0066WJLU6|4.0|Honestly I think this app is kinda use list  lol km I think this app I awesome and yah bye the way my name is _________________you starts with a k
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|the game was good. it had good graphics and a good story line. I did not like that you have to pay for a certain level.
B007XKEY6Q|3.0|It was really fun until it started to freeze. So I deleted the app and started it again but now it won't even let me login to it.
B000T9OP7G|2.0|I love the Sarah Connor Chronicles series, especially the first season. I ordered this item so I could share the terminator experience with my little sister. The goal was to receive the item before I left after the holidays. The order was promised to be shipped in two days; making my goal possible. The item arrived in two days just as advertised, however not in the entirety promised.<br /><br />When I opened the package I realized something was different. The DVDs case did not have a slip cover. Although disappointing, I was still happy to have the series. I opened up the case to find only the 3rd of three discs. I was ANGRY.<br /><br />I contacted the company in hope to get the other two discs. I no longer had time to watch the DVDs before I left after the holidays, so now I just needed to get what I payed for. After a couple of hours I was contacted through email.<br /><br />I was fully refunded for my purchase, and that is the only reason I gave it two stars.<br /><br />The email went on to console me saying this normally doesn't happen (that's great and all but it did to me) and then went on to explain that they DON'T HAVE TO SEND ME ANYTHING. According the sellers rules, they can send what items they have available, even if you purchase the item and promises to be the complete first season and all parts in stock.<br /><br />I wasn't looking to be refunded just to get what I payed for.<br /><br />I will never buy from this seller again.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This is the best book I have ever reed.<br />I read this book in less than 24 hours.I think this is the most amazing book I reccomend this book to everyone
B003TOH8AE|5.0|If you have ever fantasized about being a superhero this is that cautionary tale you need to see.  Kick Ass.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I couldn't ,put it down. I read the trilogy in 9 days. Each of the first books left me \\"hungry\\" for more, culminating with this and an appropriate ending.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|Great app. No crashes. I love the ability to add audio and photos to notes, love skitch. I really wish I could figure out a good way to do web clipping on kindle fire... evernotes is unavailable  as far as I can tell and pocket works, but it eliminated pics... any hints? (You can web clip from the PC to Evernote.)<br /><br />(For those of you who HS and know what a \\"workbox system\\" is, I am using Evernote as a digital \\"Workbox.\\" I have two notebooks per student: \\"Billy's Workbox\\" and \\"Billy' s Completed Workbox.\\" One note per task {I title notes with 1-5 for day of the week + day of the week + subject = so that they show up in order, grouped by subject, in the notebook}. On Friday {or Sunday night ;-) } I use my PC to ctrl click all notes in \\"completed\\" that I want done the coming week and mass move them into \\"Workbox.\\" {It takes maybe 5 minutes.} As students complete tasks during the week they move notes to the \\"completed\\" notebook. Certain tasks, say tasks that repeat every other week, remain in \\"completed\\" when not assigned. It is very easy {unlike the cards from the original system} to edit a note to be specific {like edit page numbers, for example} each week -very fast. I can use the PC to \\"clip\\" things and put them in the Workbox for reading too. For example, I can \\"clip\\" an article for Social Studies, or a story from Gutenberg(dot)org for reading or history or science.  I can add a file from Librivox, as well. I also keep a notebook per student for a \\"portfolio.\\" I can  keep typed + audio recordings of narrations, scans of Copywork and art, etc. It saves a lot of space!)
B003O86FMW|5.0|One of the best books I've ever read, like ever.. Great for people like me, always aiming for more, starting the next book right away.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|I got this game as a free game of the day and I really enjoy it, it can be challenging at times but it's not too difficult. I haven't had any problems with it freezing or closing unexpectedly or anything, which often happens with other apps I've downloaded. I highly recommend it!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|The book was so emotional and true for teenagers and it was really beautiful if a book can make me cry and start to think about things it's got my vote.
B00A9X9TIW|5.0|An interesting story, not just action. There are a few questions, but maybe that means I merely need to watch it again--which will be most enjoyable. It's THAT kind of movie....one where the DVD won't collect dust.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|I  like this because is really helpful to me and to the people that have this  as a dictionary :)
B009WO7NQO|5.0|I can't stop playing this game.  we have it on our phones, our tables and our computer.  it is so much fun to play angry birds and have the weapons and star wars powers. the graphics are so clever. I just wish that I could stop playing it
B005723JSQ|3.0|It is a nice light read.  Funny, witty, just something to keep you engrossed until the end. I recommend it just not for 13 dollars
B008K6HN8I|2.0|Downloaded because I was told it would make it easier to arrange my apps on Kindle Fire HD.  Too confusing to use.  Will be getting rid of this one.
B00AECGQF2|5.0|Fun<br />5 yr old to 99 it is fun. Plenty of realistic salon stations  to make it feel like a full professional .
B008HK3XKO|5.0|Case is great:  Fits my Kindle Fire HD perfectly.  Been using it since Dec 28th and is holding up pretty well. Something unexpected and not advertised; it puts the Fire to sleep when closing and wakes it when opening.  Don't know if I missed that in the other reviews or not.  The Amazon brand case does advertise this feature but it costs $20 more than this one!  Makes the battery last a lot longer without having to turn the unit off and on all the time.<br />Very happy with this product and will look for Marware brand first with any other like purchases...  :)
B005LAIH4A|4.0|this is a good Dr Seuss movie but not the best I have seen. The voices are a perfect fit to the character and there of course is a great life lesson learned like all Dr Seuss things!
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|Bought my daughter kindle fire for Christmas and wanted to keep it safe.  This case cover, fit like a glove and it stands up too, which is great when she is watching movies.  Arrived quick and would recommend seller again.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Very good, did not see the ending coming at all!  Can't wait to see where we are going next. Excited.
B000I9TY4G|5.0|This movie is a conclusion to the 'Firefly' series and satisfies my need for an end to a story.  That said, the actors seemed sad that the end was near for a fine syfy  event.  I say event because everything worked, the story, the dialogue, the actors, the ship 'FIRFLY', and of course, the makeup.  They worked to make a classic. Enough said!
B005K2YRVG|5.0|I received a Kindle Paperwhite for Christmas, and I purchased this sleeve to protect it. The Paperwhite fits perfectly, and the sleeve appears to be really durable. I have no concerns with tossing it in my bag with other books and miscellaneous items. The flap is secured with two Velcro strips. The inside is covered in a softer felt-like material to avoid scratches.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Oh my goodness, which  would have thought that holding a pinky could mean so much. What an amazing story, lots of twists and turns and such an amazing connection between the two leads. Absolutely beautiful!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|My first Stephen King book and it will definitely not be my last.  I was completely surprised by the ending.  It was definitely not what I expected.  Mr. King did not disappoint.
B0063IH60K|3.0|Basic solitaire but I did like the unique format it provides.  More options than most of the other offerings I have used.
1403705992|4.0|This book was part of my grand-nephew's Christmas package. It arrived on time and in excellent condition. I hope the twelve-year-old will eventually be able to tear himself away from the Wii long enough to read it!
B007TK77QE|2.0|This is the first book i have read of hers, their wasn't much to the story, i think maybe she should keep to writing for the younger people
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Would like to play the sequel.  This game was challenging and had a good balance of puzzles and hidden objects.
B003JTHXOK|3.0|This book was pretty good, not great, but entertaining. It's your typical Nicholas sparks book, girl has problem, doesn't want to fall in love, but falls in love anyway, and he saved her from her problems. Despite being predictable, I couldn't put the book down and finished it in a couple days.
B0015AARJI|5.0|We got this so that we could have multiple people playing at once.  The game system only came with one controller.
B009VSW15Y|4.0|It's good and I'm glad there is a camera it works but I think it's ridiculous that after spending so much on the tablet it should just be included....Very cheap Amazon.
B005QI4TP8|5.0|Not enough good can be said Florence + The Machine.  Beautiful, powerful voice that is a pleasure to listen to, and the songs are all worthy of a full listen.
B00APACSJG|4.0|While Cryoburn may not be the best book in the Vorkosigan series, it maintains the high standards set by previous books. I have read every Bujold book available on Kindle (except for maybe one) so I clearly enjoy her work in general. While I like it when she focuses attention on a character who is not the usual protagonist in this series (Mile Vorkosigan), these books are never my favorites.<br /><br />Bujold never fails to build interesting tales with interesting characters. I am not sure how a book like this reads for those who are not familiar with the characters and their extensive (at this point) back story but her characters are consistently people that I like visiting again and again. In this book, the focus character is mainly Roic, Miles' ex-town policeman armsman. While likeable enough, Roic is rather a dull character to serves as a central character, as he does in much of this book, but Miles, Dr. Raven and even Lord Mark are here as well. The tale itself, which revolves around the politics and economics of cryogenic preservation of the &#34;dead&#34; for future revival, raise the interesting political, moral, and philosophical issues that can only be covered in this kind of speculative fiction.<br /><br />While I applaud the efforts in exploring a very different society here and Bujold's body of work in general, this book highlights one of her consistent weakpoints: her lack of understanding of business practice and practicality. Too often, she falls into what I consider the &#34;lazy Hollywood-interpretation&#34; of business, that is, the use of the need to make a profit, i.e. create value to have others voluntarily give you money, as a convenient bogeymen in the plot. She seldom seems to notice that what makes her business people &#34;evil&#34; is never the offer of value in a voluntary transaction (i.e. business)  but the control of laws to coerce others (i.e. government).  Which is strange because the author clearly likes grand business ideas as portrayed by her character Lord Mark (Miles' clone twin brother) and is partner.<br /><br />In this book in particular, she doesn't seem to realize that her sympathetic underdog local characters would be, in the real world, small business people fighting the interests of those who control the government.  This misunderstanding of business creates logical plot problems in explaining how these small &#34;black market&#34; cryogenic operators could actually exist. Simply trying to do good without some way to economically support the services provided is like lifting yourself into orbit by pulling up on your bootstraps (Baron Munchausen's stories aside). Bujold is forced to simply state that these operations do work by putting abandoned property to work, for the sake of the plot, and then stumbles into explaining areas of operations where a reader who understands basic economics must look away and shudder.
B00003CXIP|5.0|Whoever said Steven King is only a horror writer never enjoyed this story or Shawshank Redemption, among many others.  Classic movie with a great cast!
B002MQYOFW|1.0|Fantasy is suppose to take us to a realm beyond our normal reach in life. I've heard how amazing this book series is , and to say the least I'm not impressed at all. I know you have to keep twist and turns to keep people interested , but in this case it was momentarily terrible. We live in a sick enough world who this of things like this. I refuse to support anything to do with hunger games. I want to know what inspires someone to write something like this.
B0095R64AO|2.0|This movie too long and poorly edited. There was much that should have been cut out. I liked the start but it got boring and tedious quickly. There were some moments that I softly chuckled but nothing really made me laugh. I cringed for the actors involved.<br /><br />The message of the movie was also horrible. This is why so many people get divorced!
0061733199|2.0|I do know why this Handbook is out of stock.I am ready to see if I can get my money back????
B0071BY084|5.0|I never thought live playing could sound this awesome! Holy sh_, Joe is in all his glory with amazing tones/emotion, incredible hands and the keyboardist is absolutely amazing. Amazing chemistry between Joe/Keyboardist. Songs from every period of his career and it is all smokin...hot (Why, War, Hordes_, Crystal_, etc.). And bonus \\"Golden Room\\" (during rehearsal) is in-cred-ible! This as enjoyable as a studio album that's how good it is. His heart is really in this. This must have been what it felt like to be in a hot jazz club when it was steaming. That's how incredible and intimate this is. This guy is the second coming of Jimi Hendrix. I've been listening since 1988 and I'm just blown away with everything he does.
B009ZZDNT6|3.0|well, its great, but you have to buy the full version in order to have the sleep timer work and give you more than &quot;white noise&quot;. that's stupid.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I love this book so much. Such an easy read could hardly put it down!!!<br />I LOVE IT!!! I LOVE IT!!!!
B0063GORYU|5.0|I will deny the amount of time I have spent playing this game, but I must say that I am very pleased with this app. This game for me is very addicting and I have trouble just playing one game. What can I say other than I love this game:)
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|A good game, graphics weren't too bad in the kindle fire hd, all seemed to work well. Really enjoyed the game
B000SEVVLK|5.0|I loved this book. I really liked the the girls friendship and their strong independent personalities. This book will be awesome for a girl who just graduated from college like myself...23 and loving it.
B006MGC3VK|5.0|OSI have outdone themselves with this one. What a fantstic album. Very Porcupine Tree-sounding. Fans of PT will love this one. I have all the other OSI releases, and they are good. But this one really stands out. Amazing work from amazing musicians.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Catching Fire is as good as the first book in this series.  Looking forward to the  3 and final one
0671027573|5.0|I LOVE this book, and reread it often. I'm not going to describe the story; that's been done. I'll just say that it's a smart, funny, sexy, suspensful, fast-paced story that i (re)turn to when nothing else grabs me. I've given away a bunch of copies of this book and the only complaint I ever get is that it sets the bar too high! Invariably, the next time I gift a book, I get the question, \\"Is this as good as Mr. Perfect?\\" Sadly, it never is.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This story truly makes a reader believe that we should value the people that are in our life and love our partner with all our hearts
B00ARAN9JW|3.0|Just an ok movie.  Glad I didn't spend the money at the theater to watch it but a good rental for a quiet night at home.
B000SGRONM|3.0|Ive enjoyed David Sedaris's other books, but this one just didn't seem as entertaining. It struck me as sort of forced and was more offensive to me than the others. Go back and reread one of his other books instead.
B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|Overall it wasn't a bad book. I mean, it sucked me in enough in the first few pages to buy it so it can't be all bad. I rolled my eyes at several lines that just seemed a little cheesy to me, but some people like that sort of thing. The twists were intriguing and I'm not sad I read it.
0385342063|5.0|I've had a lot going on lately and was not in the mood to read anything \\"deep\\" and \\"meaningful\\"....Sophie Kinsella's novels rarely disappoint as she has the chick lit genre down pat.  Give us a fun character that you care about, in this case, Poppy Wyatt, a crazy situation and story line and a book that you can't put down. That's what I want....  If you like chick lit you know what I'm talking about.  This is your classic beach read, or in my case my guilty pleasure to enjoy in a big fat bubble bath.<br /><br />Our heroine is Poppy Wyatt, who we meet on page 1 as she frantically searches at a hotel banquet room for her heirloom engagement ring that has come up missing.  How is she going to break the news to her fiance, Magnus or his family?  As she ponders how she is going to fix this her phone is swiped by a passerby and she is now without ring and phone.  How fortunate then that she sees in the trash bin a phone, a working phone, but not hers.  She is desperate to contact her friends to see if they have her ring and she keeps the phone.  All is working out with the phone until Sam, the boss of the personal assistant who the phone belonged to calls and being the nice girl that Poppy is she tells him of the problem and asks if they can \\"share\\" the phone until she gets her ring back.  Sam is not wild about this, but Poppy somehow convinces him that she can be trusted to email him his messages and she really needs the phone since she called everyone to call her on that phone if the ring is found.  Back and forth the exchanges go while Poppy goes on with her search for her ring.<br />Yes, it is far-fetched, yes, it is unbelievable, so what?  I was looking for a light fun read and this was it.  Poppy is a crazy but sweet girl who gets herself into unbelievable \\"I love Lucy\\" scenarios that she has to talk her way out of. From lying to the in-laws about why her ring finger is bandaged (she says she burned it, which doesn't help when she finds out the neighbor is a doctorwho would be happy to look at it), opening a present that doesn't belong to her and wearing the intimate contents, meddling in emails when she thinks she can \\"help\\" (um, not), or just generally trying things that back-fire in her face time and time again.<br /><br />I enjoyed this crazy ride with Poppy, Sam & Magnus.  If you are looking for plausible plot-lines and a deep story line, this isn't for you.  If you have had a rough go lately and just want to be entertained by a fun novel this one is just the ticket.  Count me a continued fan of Sophie Kinsella's imaginative novels.
B009LGO88E|5.0|You may think the circle pad pro is one-off from Nintendo, but this add-on almost a necessity like the memory cards for the Playstation Vita(zinger). But this adds an additional set of L and R triggers on the back in addition to the circle pad(very handy for shooters and fighting games). It's also very nicely ergonomically designed for your hands so you can play in comfort and grip the system and manage all of the buttons without frustration.<br /><br />Also, no matter what region you live in the world, NTSC, NTSJ, PAL ect. The circle pad pro XL will work on any 3DS XL, it uses universal NFC(near field communication) with the circle pad pro, which is standard in every 3DS system for communication with other 3DS systems.<br /><br />So if you're getting games like Resident Evil: Revelations, Metal Gear Solid Snake Eater 3D, Kid Icarus: Uprising and many other shooting games on the 3DS, you really owe it to yourself to get one.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|(I need to be a bit vague in this review to not give too much away.  I apologize.)<br /><br />On the surface, Life of Pi, is a well written, entertaining, but casual story about Pi's (the main character) adventures.  It wasn't until I began discussing the book with my daughter, who also read it, that I realize there was something more to it.  My daughter and I had a pretty strenuous disagreement about what the book was about.  So I began doing some research and discovered that the author intentionally wrote the book to be interpreted in two different ways.  The way each of us interprets the story is a reflection of how we look at certain aspects of life.<br /><br />The story is fun.  The reflection and self-discovery after the reading is where the real pay-off occurs.<br /><br />&#34;And so it goes with God&#34;
B004R36QUE|5.0|Outstanding.. wonderful story about perseverance and not giving up<br />I would regimens this movie or book to anyone that can read or that cares about being the best that they can be!
1567184855|4.0|I read Many Lives Many Masters several years ago and this book supports the same theory that we've been here before and will be back, most likely. I found that it didn't refute the ideas that many of our most popular religions are founded on but rather presents another possibility to life after death. To me, it makes sense that we would keep coming back and working on improving ourselves.
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|The packaging is nice and all the movies look good. I received it quicker than expected which was nice. My boyfriend really liked receiving all the movies.
B0063IH60K|4.0|For the cheaters among us the game lets you choose a winning hand or a random hand.  Its easy to play -- even allows you to bring a card back from the ace-up pile into play -- but doesnt tell you when the game is over or let you quit then close.  Doesnt track statistics though it times your games.  Overall a pleasant enough way to waste time.
B008B68IUY|2.0|Purchased for my 8 y.o. daughter for Xmas. Seatbelt was broken within a day from changing out the dolls frequently. Disappointed. Not worth the purchase price.
B009HV2JT8|1.0|Was hoping for campy fun, but the film had no charm or cleverness at all.  Boring. Even the 13 yo boy didn't like it!
B009WO7NQO|2.0|I am not a big gamer however I love killing time playing Angry Birds and a few other similarly themed games - Until this version that is. While I'm not well versed in apps, I'm also no dummy- I found this version of Angry Birds confusing and quite frankly too much of an effort to play. No clearly definable instructions, the concept itself remains the same, and is simple, however other challenges,items, etc  appear that are not characteristic of other versions and by far not as easily grasped by your casual gamer- Additionally I agree with previous reviews noting the in app purchases- A paid app should be a PAID app- period. The money seeking schemes are, quite frankly, irritating.<br />Not user friendly.
B0047Y17P2|5.0|Connelly seems to improve his work with each novel - whether it's Mickey Haller or Harry Bosch. As usual, very good writing and lotsof turns in the story. Well worth reading - even if you've not read any of his previous books.
0062024329|4.0|Never realized this was the picture novel, until after I purchased it. The art work is great, but I still choose reading the regular book over a picture novel so the mind can create the pictures :)
B000002UBU|2.0|After hearing the radio friendly hit off this album the rest just kind of goes a little flat. I got it for my girl friend & she's not that impressed with it. Oh well better luck next time?
B004UM6KGW|5.0|I loved reading this book this past semester for my Pysch class and knew that my parents would love it as well. It made a great Christmas present and they love the book to (:
B0097EWK3A|5.0|It's cool, but more than a little creepy I just have to get the second one now or its just gonna kill me!
B00919V2ZS|5.0|I can't say I like everything from Frank Zappa, but this album is tremendous.<br /><br />First of all the 2 disc set is chock full of great performances. I especially like the Walt Fowler trumpet work, and the sax players are great too.<br /><br />Really fun, and worth a listen !
B00992CF6W|3.0|ok but horribly needs redstone armor and caves. also, there are only creepers zombies skeletons and spiders.<br />hope update 5.1 or 6.0 comes out soon :)
B00574Q7PQ|5.0|Since when did Liam become such an action icon? Not only will this film have you guessing all the way, but the action and suspense it throws your way is awesome as well. Also, the plot it fresh and well acted by various players. I would definitely have to recommend this one to others, especially if your a fan of the Taken series.
B007PVHMCG|5.0|When this package arrived, I was amazed how small it was. When I gave it to my stepson (who is eight years old) for Christmas, he was in love! He had no problem putting it together and within a short amount of time. He loves legos and he loves minecraft so it was the perfect gift!
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|Simple enough to play with school age children, yet challenging enough for fun loving adults.  A great little game to play with your friends.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Couldn't put it down. I loved how you get drawn in. I wasn't sure about it at first, but it didn't take long to get hooked.  Can`t wait to read book 2!
B005S9EKCW|5.0|This is the first time I've ever seen the musical version of Les Miserables. This is something of a surprise, because around 21 years ago I listened to the full soundtrack. I just never had the chance to actually see a performance. During that time, for personal reasons, it became a very important story to me. Now I've finally had the chance to watch this movie. Was it worth the 21 year wait?<br /><br />In a word, yes. This was absolutely everything that I'd hoped for in a movie version of the famed musical. Visually stunning, with such a memorable soundtrack and incredible performances, especially by Anne Hathaway who, goodness me, may well have sewn up an Oscar with her singing of \\"I Dreamed a Dream\\", something that put even the Susan Boyle version to shame.<br /><br />The story is by turns basic and complex. Hugh Jackman plays Jean Valjean, a man convicted and sentenced to five years in prison for stealing a loaf of bread. During that time, he tried to escape, but was caught, and ends up having fourteen years added to his sentence. Now after 19 years, he's released on a parole, but, as many released from prison discover even now, he can't find a job and can't find a place to live. He's taken in by a kindly bishop (Colm Wilkinson, who originated the Valjean role on stage), and then repays the bishop's kindness by stealing silver plates and the like. When he's caught, he claims the silver was a gift, and is astounded when the bishop not only backs him up, but offers him more. Valjean, who had been on the verge of turning into a villain, instead becomes a hero and sets out to return to being an honest man. Meantime, police inspector Javert (Russell Crowe, who really has an incredible singing voice), sets off in pursuit of Valjean, while around them France seethes with revolutionary fervor.<br /><br />That is, mind you, just scratching the surface. It doesn't touch on the romance, the comedy relief, the violence, the death, the other death, the many, many, many deaths. Some of these deaths are truly heart-wrenching, and I'm only half joking when I comment about hiding the razors before watching.<br /><br />The music is everything I'd expected and the sets are wonderful. But the real gem here are the performances. Jackman, Crowe, Sasha Baron Cohen and Helena Bohnam Carter are all exceptionally good in their roles, but it is Hathaway who walks off with the best performance on film. If you can sit through her final song and not want to start crying like a child, you might well need to have emotions.exe installed. In fact the only complaint I have about casting is that of Eddie Redmayne, a normally fine actor, but someone with a singing voice that sounds like what someone who wanted to parody a stage singing voice would sound like. It's not bad, really, but very stylized and odd.<br /><br />While I don't think this movie will or should win Best Picture at the Oscars, it still has a great deal to recommend it. I highly recommend it, the highlight soundtrack, currently available for fifteen bucks from Amazon, and even, if you feel brave enough, reading the original book. I don't think you'll be disappointed in any of the above.
B007C7UZIG|5.0|I just got this app to check for the frequent sales steam has available. I love steam its where I get ALL my PC games and always at a discount!

B009P5S11G|5.0|You don't usually love every single song in an album, but with this one i just can't choose my favorite! Every single song goes very deep in your mind and heart. Dear Rihanna, this is the kind of music you should keep doing.
B009CG29RK|5.0|Great for all ages.  Whole family can watch this movie.  Quirky must see.  Worth the money whichever you decide rent or buy...

B0095ZMMCK|5.0|I have read all the Ryan novels, and I would rank this with the best. The action is taut, and the ideas of what could happen are believable and scary. Once this book hit its stride, it cost me quite a bit of sleep.
0679441018|5.0|Anne Rice is a superb writer and the Vampire Chronicles is a must have for the serious fan. I am in the process of reading this one again.
B00A9X9VAI|1.0|This is the worst time travel movie ever. And there have been a lot of bad time travel movies. From about 5 minutes in until the very last scene this movie is loaded with irreconcilable paradoxes that the writers/director selectively do or don't recognize based on how it moves the characters closer to the predetermined \\"cool\\" or \\"freaky\\" outcome that they had in mind. I wish I could go back in time and warn my past self not to see it.
B005HSL626|5.0|t<br />This games is the bomb my little cousins love it and my parents love this. I love Fruit Ninja !!!!!

B0083ZRAJS|5.0|It was really good  the text  'really  cubs back-up it seems that it was a fantasy books I don't have good grammar
B007FG9LIE|5.0|Like a combination of twilight zone and lost all rolled up in one book.<br />A very hard book to put down.
B009329ZF2|5.0|Great writers and the special effects were awesome. Recommend this film for the whole family! Very good imagination in not only the special effect but also real life time ideas.
B001FB4VXU|5.0|Finally!  A TV series that doesn't dummy-down to monosyllabic drivel.  I actually watched a show or two and turned the channel not realizing that it takes a while to comprehend the well-developed roles and sub-plots of the characters.  Once I did, I really can't get enough of this series...and thus, have to order the DVDs!  The story is about 4 geniuses who happen to be nerds, and the stories dealing with their lack of social skills is hilarious.  The series hired a consultant because they do touch on scientific principles, speak English but with BIG WORDS, and other points that would be spoilers if mentioned.  They are based on real people the creators of this series met on the East Coast.  I highly recommend this Second Season, own the first seasons and loved it, and I am eagerly anticipating the arrival of the 4th season any day!
B002KS1IJC|4.0|Wasn't sure what to expect, but this one turned out to be a pretty good action/fantasy escape.  The story moves at a nice clip and the action sequences are done well.  Much better acting than most films in this genre.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I like that this is not the typical sequel.  It keeps you guessing as to the &#34;whys&#34; behind their actions.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Totally blown away! Definitely did not expect such a dramatic turn of events! Can't wait to finish the final book!!!
B00846REIS|5.0|Where 50 Shades is about dominance, this is about more realistic trust issues with couples.  Our past does tend to pop back up in our futures.  This is a couple dealing with how to make it work.
B002BI6SMI|3.0|A parent's protective, desperate fury is a fantastic vehicle for justifying the kind of unabashed mayhem and destruction that Taken delivers.  Liam Neeson channels righteous anger in very focused ways, making some of the questionable things his character does seem purposeful, despite running counter to what the ideal action hero would do.<br /><br />The primary story of an abducted daughter, kidnapped on a trip her estranged father felt was too dangerous in the first place, almost would have performed better against a generic backdrop of &#34;some other city&#34;.  The unique character of Paris and the foreign way that police and intelligence matters are handled served as unnecessary distractions.<br /><br />At the end of the day, the design of the movie feels like a good idea hijacked by movie execs.  Light spoiler alert, but as an example, the movie's hero moves mainly unscathed through numerous violent encounters with villains until, surprise, the super-evil and smarmy looking second-in-command manages to wound him in a gunfight.  Fear not, as he was ruthlessly, but justifiably, stabbed by his own knife/impaled on a stick/thrown down a well.  Honestly, I can't remember as I had really started to lose interest in the specifics by this point, but I hope you get the general idea.<br /><br />Taken is probably best watched when you're at home, sick with the flu, passing in and out of consciousness from the lingering effects of last night's Ny-Quil.  It's not horrible by any stretch, but ends up as a bit of a disappointment.

B008C1O8CA|2.0|I bought this album on a whim, at a discount. I love Green Day, and I had heard they were coming out with a new 3-part album. I hadn't heard much about it since, but, sound unheard, I figured I'd buy the first of the three, \\"Uno\\", when I saw it for 7 bucks.<br /><br />I'm REALLY glad I didn't buy \\"Dos\\" and \\"Tre\\" along with it.<br /><br />It's easy to forget just how long Green Day have been around,  but their fan favorite album, \\"Dookie\\", came out in 1994. Do the math, that's been a while. My personal favorite album of theirs, \\"Nimrod\\", came out in '97. They had a couple decent albums after \\"Nimrod\\", and then came \\"American Idiot\\" in 2004, a passionate, political and brilliant concept album that changed everything. \\"Idiot\\" was and is a masterpiece, and although I didn't agree with a lot of its politics and still don't, it remains one of my favorite albums by any band, ever. Its 2008 sequel, \\"21st Century Breakdown\\", was good too, picking up where American Idiot left off with poetic, political lyrics (though less of an underlying connection or story between the songs.)  At the time of \\"Breakdown\\", I considered Billie Joe Armstrong an emerging poet of a generation, a brilliant writer, and a genuine rival to Bruce Springsteen, who came out with an album at the same time, \\"Working on a Dream\\", that tackled some of the same political issues in a more optimistic light. Listen to Green Day's song  \\"The Static Age\\" and then listen to Springsteen's \\"What Love Can Do\\". You'll see what I mean.<br /><br />I must not have been the only one who felt that way, because those albums inspired a successful Broadway musical.<br /><br />\\"Uno\\", on the other hand, sounds at first listen like a band taking a nostalgic trip back to their old sound, a sort of back-to-basics revival. There's some of their early punk in there, there's some of the poetic angst of \\"Nimrod\\", and there's some of the \\"American Idiot\\" balladry. There are some damn good songs, too... \\"Carpe Diem\\", \\"Oh Love\\" and \\"FellFor You\\" in particular. But the whole thing seems forced, and some of the other songs are SO bad, you'll wonder if this is even the same band. Armstrong's lyrics lack inspiration, and he drops more F-bombs in one album than in his entire previous catalog. Hell, he drops more F-ing cuss words in one SONG than in his entire f-ing CAREER. (\\"Loss of Control\\") A major step down from \\"Wake Me Up When September Ends\\", a song from \\"American Idiot\\" that my MOM, who HATES Green Day, loves. She cries every time she hears it.<br /><br />That's what makes Green Day endure...their ability to craft songs that people of all ages and walks of life can relate to. They can make you fist-bump on one song, make your mom cry on another and make your little cousin head-bang on yet another. And they do all this in simple, 3-or-4-chord tunes. They are brilliant.<br /><br />That's what makes this \\"Uno\\" album so sad...there is no heart or passion in it. The sad songs aren't sad enough, the angry songs aren't angry enough, and the happy songs aren't happy enough. \\"Uno\\" has a couple good tracks, but as an album, it's a mess, and it lacks what made people like these guys in the first place: Passion.<br /><br />It doesn't make me want to check out \\"Dos' and \\"Tre\\". It makes me want to check out \\"American Idiot\\" and \\"Nimrod\\" one more time.

B0017KIBAI|5.0|After using it for a solid week with some minimal wear and tear test runs, there has been absolutely no problems whatsoever. The joystick still feels smooth and new, no catching. The buttons press naturally and there is also no sticking. L and R buttons function fantastic. You can tell this was a Nintendo-made product and not a third party ripoff.<br /><br />The colour was a nice touch too... well, the lack of colour that is since it's white. The entire box was japanese which I thought was cute. It's most likely a japan exclusive item but it works on all gamecube and wii systems (I tested).<br /><br />Overall it was a fantastic buy and well worth the money I paid for it.

1405248378|4.0|Our 3 yo is a big Timmy fan and there isn't alot around here w/ Timmy besides dvds.  More words than I expected based on another review and for a show with no words.  A couple of the books have too many words to us.  I wish they would have had a few extra pages each for better story telling.  Pictures are straight from the episodes.  We are learning the names of the characters from the books.  Our son is excited to have books with pictures of Timmy.  The small size will be nice when we travel.  I'm not sure kids unfamiliar with TImmy Time would like the books.  Definitely would recommend for younger Timmy fans.

B003Y5HWMW|5.0|Loved watching it when it was on HBO the first go-around, and I love having it on Blu-Ray as well. Definitely worth the buy - everything you've heard about the series is true.
0783231032|1.0|this is definateley not High definition. Looks like poor vhs copy quality on a cd. don't waste your money with this.
B000NIVJGI|4.0|My fiance loved the original movie, and had it on VHS. I bought this for her for Valentine's Day to replace the old tape we just have sitting around, but have no way of playing.
B00ARAO1LC|1.0|Maybe I expected too much, but in my opinion , this was just a bad movie.  Not even a &#34;B Flick&#34;.  That would have been an improvement.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|Buy these for the book lover in your life, or the fan of the show. Getting the kindle edition is nice because then you don't have to carry around all of them - and adding a book to the collection is simple.
B00A0SQBDM|5.0|I absolutely positively love it!!!!!!!! I think everyone should get this app!!!!!!!! I'm giving it...... ummmmmmm..... 100 stars!!!!!!!!  PEACE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  ;-)
B003R0MEZ4|5.0|Good cast, good acting, good plot. If you like the shows - or if you know someone who is into criminology and the like - this is a must buy. It is probably the most accurate crime drama on TV today, and the dynamic between the characters actually changes (unlike Law and Order).
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|All day at work I was thinking about this little game. The facebook page contains walkthroughs if you get stuck. Very helpful. Also I have a first generation fire and the calibration was off so I kept getting burned.  Went online and found out how to fix by holding the power button for 20 seconds and then restarting. I love the humorous little worlds in this game. Also it's not as hard to figure out as some games but not too easy or repetitive.
B0044XV3QY|5.0|I'm going to assume you've seen the movie already (as it seems nearly everyone has). It's worth watching in Blu-Ray, if only for the additional visual quality. The Ultra-Violet digital component to the movie is nice - I like being able to watch movies on my iPod, iPhone, and other devices even without buying them on iTunes.
1451695187|4.0|Great story!  Everyone should read this, it could change your life or reinforce your existing beliefs!  It gives us all something to think about while we live.
B005LAIHXQ|3.0|It was on my brother-in-law's Christmas list, so we got it for him. He liked it. Not really a movie I'd have any desire to see, but since I've not watched it, I can't give any further details about it.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Love this! I usually have tons of notes all over the house, but now I can keep them all in the same place! Easy to use! I absolutely love it!
B007FJFDXS|5.0|This app is easily one of the greatest mobile game to hit all app stores (amazon, play store, ios app store). It feels like an adventure game because you're always traveling across the map and discovering new ways to overcome obstacle. You even have an enemy / companion (depending on the mission) called Dark Cube, who helps or tries to prevent you from reaching your goal. Some missions are trickier than others and some will blow your mind when you realize how complex and engaging this game is despite the fact that your a cube in a rectalinear world. It make use of a mini map which is nessisary to surpass some of the levels.<br />Only complaint from me is I wish the mini map was at the same angle as the game.
B00992CF6W|5.0|it fun you can build what ever you want. I just love it. best game ever. mojang had a good ideabwhen he invented mincraft
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|love this game! I tried it bc it was FAOTD and have been addicted ever since. great puzzles, fun graphics. best game I've played in a long time.
B000W91RUG|5.0|I got this during a flash sale on Black Friday so it was super cheap. Totally worth the price. I wish I had picked up more seasons.  Will bring you hours of entertainment :)
B0084BMUFA|5.0|Love the story but never read the book till now. It is as wonderful as the stories told. I will definitely read it over and over again.
B001FB4VXU|5.0|I got this during a flash sale on Black Friday so it was super cheap. Totally worth the price. I wish I had picked up more seasons.  Will bring you hours of entertainment :)
B000QUCNOK|5.0|Tom Tykwer's stunning -- and shockingly faithful -- adaptation of Patrick Susskind's modern classic is as fine a screen version of this baroque and richly twisted tale as I think it is possible to achieve. At one time the screen rights were owned by Stanley Kubrick, and, being a huge admirer of Kubrick, I can think of no higher praise than to say I find it hard to imagine the master himself having done that much better with this highly tricky and challenging material. And, to echo what many have already said here, this is a love-it-or-hate-it experience, I fear, with the multi-pronged ending being especially devisive, though also astonishing. And the casting, starting with the absolutely DEFINITIVE choice of narrator, the great John Hurt (whose narration for 'Dogville' was equally perfect), and continuing on to even the smallest role, is unerringly right. And with its wondrous cinematography and rich musical tapestry making almost palpable this almost obscenely rich world of scents, both good and evil, 'Perfume: The Story Of A Murderer' may be hard to warm up to but is impossible to forget. Just imagine 'Amadeus' seen through a smokey funhouse mirror and fueled by absinthe and a slight whiff of DeSade and you may get some idea of the perverse pleasures and eveil brilliance awaiting you in this highly unusual feast for the senses.
B005FMZWD8|5.0|A lot of friends want to buy this watch and ask me about the reference to buy it. I'm very happy, everybody like it.
B008D30K7E|5.0|At times it is so unbelievable that you actually believe it!  A really good story which gets you thinking.  I recommend it.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I began this book and didn't put it down until it was finished 5 hours later. EVERYTHING about this book was perfect. I didn't expect the outcomes like usual, and I was never disappointed with any aspect of the book. I woke up this morning and began to read it again! This book is absolutely amazing, and while Slammed and Point Of Retreat were both very good, this book was on a whole other level. I hope there is a second book. For those who have read Beautiful Disaster and were left with that feeling that you won't find another book as good? and then you're stuck in a bit of a funk? This book will get you out of that funk, but also place you back into one! It will be hard to find a book that can compete.
B007FRHZ4A|5.0|One of the first gifts opened on Christmas day. My kids all had a blast with their playset. The hardest part for me was figuring out where each thing went back in the package when they were done, but that is minor
B000VDDDVO|5.0|the colorization on this version of It's A Wonderful Life is near miraculous.  I HIGHLY recommend this version. Years ago I bought an early color version of this classic.  The color work done was reminiscent of the hand done color of High School pictures , not too impressive. THIS IS FANTASTIC... beautiful work. I'd like to see more of the Black and white classic movies brought back to life by this method.[[ASIN:B000VDDDVO It's A Wonderful Life (Two-Disc Collector's Set)]]
B007DIQAXI|5.0|such a good album from a young band. worthy of a chance from anyone as there's a lot to enjoy here. catchy, well crafted, energetic...... its all here. all in all, a solid album to enjoy repeatedly.
B0090P98Z4|4.0|Great hack-n-slash, snatch-n-grab, dungeon crawler. The WiFi multiplayer is pretty awesome. Biggest complaint is Amazon lagging behind the Google play store...You cannot upgrade lesser elements on Amazon...Fix for 5 stars.
1936608898|5.0|another take on paleo, however from a less fanatical/ fantasy point of view. delivered with a nerdy honesty whilst maintaining a realistic outlook on others tendencies of bailing on 'diets', this book outlines that its purpose is to break your bad habits/ relationship you've developed with food. after that, its up to you to weight out the consequences of eating poor choices as this book informs the reader (aswell as the experience of eating healthy) to use their judgement. basically, the whole point is to break bad habits along with developing tools to make good choices. i believe diet needs to become a noun again with the human species, instead of being viewed as a verb. this book is a great tool to aid that change of conscience. savy?
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I liked this book a lot. I rated it 5 stars because it was so realistic. It felt like everything actually happened and I could be next.  What I didn't like about this book is that I felt like it lacked. The first book was amazing, the second book could've been better,and this book was good,but could've been better. Anyway everything else was good but (I cried when Prim died and every time her name was mentioned ) it could have been better.  I wouldn't recommend this book to softies. This book (and the other 2) are pretty grotesque. Their are some horrible deaths and I wouldn't recommend this book to children.
B00284G2IA|5.0|If you\\"re not a Nightwish fan now, you will be after watching this concert!<br />I'm a big listener of Priest, Sabbath, Iron Maiden, Sister Sin, Disturbed, Doro Pesch, and the like.<br />This band is excellent, and Tarja Turunen (female lead), All i can say is THIS WOMAN CAN SING!. If you like my type of music, I guarantee you'll like this!<br />The Sound on this Blu-Ray version is excellent.<br />Some people report having problems of this disc not working on thier machines. I purchased this direct from Amazon.<br />I\\"ve played this on my NTSC PS3, and also my NTSC Sony BDP-S480 Blu-Ray player with no problems at all.<br />BUY THIS! Crank it up and give it a couple of listens. You won't be sorry!
0920668372|1.0|If this book were to switch genders, as in a dad stalking his full grown daughter, wouldn't we all be alarmed? But because this is a mother who can't cut the cord, we are supposed to view this as normal. Hmmmmm..... Although on a fun note, buy it used and read it in a creepy voice to your friends--best horror story ever.
B008NEVP1S|4.0|All the songs sound very much the same. But some of the lyrics do stand out. The cover and liner art hurts my eyes, making me think I'm too old for this almost-easy-listening album.
B0047WJ12K|5.0|Solid fun intense.  This show has it all from beginning to end.  Well thought out and well scripted.  Leonardo rocked again.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|I like this app because of the ease of use and it's free too. It keeps my Kindle Fire HD running smoothly :)
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|That's really the only thing I can say...WOW. But, of course, just saying that isn't NEARLY enough! Really, this is one of the best books I've ever read. It's actually hard to even call it that..a \\"book,\\" that is. It is so, so much more than that. It's life. Not just Sky's life, but all of our lives. Colleen Hoover captures all those moments in all our lives that made us who are, and makes us feel differently about each and every one of them. She makes us proud to call those moments ours. She makes us take everything about our lives that has caused us pain, caused us to get depressed or, God forbid DEPRESSED, and turn it into something to be proud of. I feel better than I have in years. It would be a crime if every person in the world doesn't read Sky's story, because it's THEIR story too.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|What a great book. Unrealistic at times? A bit that's ok because the writing and characters are wonderful and it sends a great message.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I loved this book! This is the first book I've read by this author but I know it won't be the last! I laughed out loud and cried while reading this!
B008FYZIVY|5.0|This show is a real winner. This set is awesome with all of season one and two made for us region DVD. It also has some extra features for the due hard fans.
B002VRZEYM|5.0|It really educates me more about our foods. People are ugly and greedy. I have stopped eating meat after coming to American. Thank you!
B00AMBM9MO|4.0|It was fairly obvious to me that I was going to see a movie about a magical stuffed bear that every kid had and every kid wished would come to life and be their friend and just what would happen if that bear grew up as you did.  What would he be like?  Thats exactly what it is and I thought it was entertaining, plus it has Mila Kunis in.
B00AMBK0X4|3.0|This movie could not decide whether it wanted to be a kids' magic story, a raunchy bromance, or a chick flick. Since those goals are mutually exclusive, it pretty much failed at all three.
B000LGZHDS|5.0|This toy is very well made and easy to keep clean. My two year old loves it, and my twelve year old got a kick out of the profile tag.
B00APUQRPC|3.0|The holes in the plot were bigger than the holes in Juan Uribe's swing. Timberlake was a good romantic interest, but as a baseball scout and owner of a 100 mph fastball? Eastwood reduced ro playing the same grumpy old man role in every movie and political convention? Just say Ho Hum.
B008MEM24S|5.0|At first I kinda thought this game was going to be a bit childish-but it ended up being actually aorta challenging and extremely fun. I also own where's my water and I'm starting to believe this game is better. My little brothers love this game. Even though over all both game are very entertaining.
B0084U0IEG|4.0|I enjoyed the fast and easy read of this light novel.  It was a fine vacation diversion but not quite up to the depth of some of McEwan's works like &#34;Atonement.&#34;
B006C1DH92|5.0|Along with this I have regular fruit ninga-which is also fun-but out of both of them I would have to like this one more. They are both entertaining and keep me busy. I love th Bandito mode!3:)
B008GWOVB8|5.0|I was a young teen when I saw this movie for the first time or should I say first 50 times. :)  I enjoyed maybe even more now as I'm able to see things I totally missed way back then.  Still a very enjoyable movie.
B0086700CM|5.0|This game has always been very entertaining and fun. You can set a goal and want to unlock stuff -that's fun. This is my little brothers Favorite game to play and they play it all the time. Awesome price. Worth getting.
B002BI6SMI|5.0|LOVE this movie! I even got it for Christmas. The second movie is good, but not like this first one .... sooooooo good!!!
B005HSL626|5.0|I love playing this game and always have. Its very fun to unlock items and use them. It lets you seer a goal in the game. Very fun and entertaing. Recommended
1439152802|4.0|I have read all four of Kate Morton's books. The first two are outstanding. These last two are really good - but it did take me longer to get through it. ALTHOUGH, I will say the ending got me - I did not expect it. I hope she gets back on the path of writing stories that are impossible to put down, though.
B00992CF6W|5.0|this game is awesome I don't care if its not like the Pc it really brings out my creativity and the man who said there kids cant build anything its because they don't have a creative mind.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I first picked this book up after a friend of mine couldn't stop talking about how amazing it was. So I bought the first book and found it to be the same story as Twilight, but with sex.<br /><br />The story begins with Ana who is very similar to Bella. She has divorced parents, her mother can't stay in one place at a time. She talks in her sleep. She has never had a boyfriend and is shocked that Christian Grey becomes interested with her. Christian and Edward have some similarities as well. Both are rich, have been adopted, have adopted siblings (his bother is like Emmett, while his sister is like Alice), outdoorsy, and both can't help but feel over protective of their love interest.<br /><br />Just as well, Jacobs character returns as Jose who is the lovable friend of Ana who Christian is threaten by.<br /><br />I always try to find something redeeming about a character so the book isn't a total waste of time and money, but there was nothing redeemable about this book. Ana was annoying and couldn't make up her mind if she wanted to be with Christian or if she wanted nothing to do with him. And the s&m sex scenes were put in there for purely shock value. Christian was a pain to listen to because of how over protective he was and what he wanted to do to Ana in his red room of pain.<br /><br />I would not recommend this book unless you want to reread Twilight with sex and you don't mind terrible grammar and sentence structure. To be honest, Twilight was a better story than this book and Twilight wasn't very well written either.<br />Hope this was helpful.
B001O2N0P0|5.0|This is one of the best U2 albums I have listened to. The song Yahweh is very mellifluous  and emotional. Brings a tear to my eye every time.
B00AHSGNJM|5.0|We love this movie! Lots of fun for children and humore to keep adults engaged. This is one we watch over & over!
B005HSL626|4.0|I bpught this for my grandchildren to pay on my kindle and they like ito play the game, even the three year olds can play it
1250007305|5.0|My girl friend and I listened to this on audio and we both loved it. I'm a computer geek and she's not. It's rare that a cyber thriller can reach both audiences. The narration is excellent too (although the narrator doesn't read code like a programmer).
B005DOKM9M|5.0|This is a perfect cover for my kindle. It helps me keep my e reader safe from damage, gives me peace of mind.
B009NT0I06|5.0|Even if you already own the cd of red, I would suggest vinyl. It's a whole different sound. Love Taylor swift for putting this out
B005KISHDY|5.0|Our grandson is enjoying his new Lego set, and spends a lot of time imagining Star Wars scenarios. A great gift, one he requested.
B0098VYCCE|4.0|The special effects in the movie were pretty cool and story was pretty good.  Overall I thought the movie was very entertaining.
B004R2DS9C|3.0|With Lego sets fully assembled, they don't all fit into the box, but it's a great place to store parts or partial sets when not in use.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Even with all the kickback this book received when it was released, I think it provides a great, boot-on-the-ground, in-your-face account of how things went down, but before, during and after, without going too much into any potentially &#34;classified&#34; procedures or tactics.  The media and the government revealed as much information, or misinformation, as this book.  At least the book sets it straight.  Good read.
B0091REZMW|3.0|its cool but every company of a game would  do anything for money... so they did this. when you run out of diamonds,  youre supposed to buy buy buy buy!!! im sick of it and i can 't just get lost in game full excitement and adventure. not with some pointers,  spells or anything to help.. editors if you are hearing this i demand something better!
B004YXE438|5.0|I use this game to pass time in doctors offices and any time I want to fill time but not read or watch TV .  These puzzles are great! You can play each in four sizes and three difficulties and then start over again and try to beat your time and # of moves from past games.<br />I've tried many games/puzzles but always find myself coming back to Spectrum's Puzzles!!! Can't wait to get more new pictures.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|Not like typical love story, this book had me from the beginning never knowing where it was going! Highly recommended! Any book by Nicholas Sparks is a hit.
1932735410|5.0|This book will let you to prepare even if you have limited practical experience of PM. Provides Tricks of the Trade and tips for the exam.
B00AEFVRB2|5.0|This film is a dark satire that highlights McConaughey's skills as an actor. It is a darker version of &#34;Joe Dirt&#34; and it is funnier. The lead actor has shown  his skills earlier in his career, but seemed to be settling for light comedy. I have recommended the film to my friends and they have not been disappointed.
B00AJRQLTI|5.0|its a very inspirational movie with great acting, singing and sound track.<br />I highly recommend seeing this movie. ocsar contender.
B00A77II0U|3.0|it was okay. was alittle kid like.but still had fun. could of been more challenging. hope to have another game made.
B0073LWEXK|3.0|This game is fun at first but as items get harder to find it can become tiresome.  There are hints but they can even be difficult and are limited.  The graphics are great and the sound effect are professionally done.
B006BDHAX0|4.0|It is an extension of the free game and has a much more plays.  It is fun to play and I like to try to beat my previous time.  I always go back and try to get 3 stars on each play.  Try to best your time on each tier.
B004HX4RT6|4.0|This is a nice chess game.  If you enjoy chess the game can be saved and finished at a later date; since chess can be a lengthy game.
B005HSL626|4.0|This is a great for when you're looking to pass the time with some mindless slicing and dicing of fruits.
B0070YDOT8|3.0|However you must register online to use this app.  You can play free or play with purchased coins.  I do not like games that I have to register online with so this was not my favorite.  If that does not matter to you check it out.
055357342X|5.0|this book looks very good and small easy hold this book. and this book was very cheaper thank you ~
B00AB0AR2U|1.0|From all the resident evil movies this one is an insult! They should call it a night and stop making movies like this one
B005RUV0NY|5.0|One of the best television series ever produced.  Fantastic effects and attention to detail.  I don't know any other series that so many friends and family have loved.  Best zombie interpretation ever!
B0086700CM|5.0|I over this game. I have it on my kindle fire.  I cant get enough of it because it is so fun
B00AC8ZIXO|4.0|Finally a Halo product that has been eating at fans for years has been realized.  Very epic, but would like to see a huge Hollywood budget thrown at it.
B0092MKFIY|5.0|I could listen to this whole album over and over again.  Each song has its own sound that makes the album in its entirety just perfect.
B006YXTRHY|5.0|I ordered this movie to watch with my family.  This was the only one I didn't get to see before the next one came out and I love all the twilight movies. Great family night
1609611543|5.0|Wheat Belly is life altering, life changing and mind boggling... but first it will make you very very angry.  Everyone needs to read this with an open mind, and begin living healthy again. I bought copies of this book for all of my friends and family.
0307888908|4.0|I enjoyed reading this book and it really made me think about how to look at what I am doing job wise and taking calculated risks when it comes to considering new offers.  The concept of being in a state of permanent beta is something I really found appealing.  I use to say, and still do, that I am very assimilatable.  You need to be in life.  This is just an easier way of saying the same thing.  Oh, and not to mention it gives you a few ideas about your linkedin profile and making it work a little better for you.  Pick this book up, you won't be sorry.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|This game rocks! The graphics are great and you can spend time trying to figure out what to do next or use the hint to keep from  getting frustrated. It's also very creepy!
1587613379|5.0|This book is great at bringing it's audience into the learning about polygamous relationships and more.  This is a book you won't necessarily read in public, although I did and no one said anything about it, but it is one you should at least have on your shelf.  This really cuts through the bs that most people say about these types of relationships and shows not only the pros but even some of the cons making sure to hit on the topics of jealousy and needing to be open in your relationships.  If you have been curious about this lifestyle or just embarking on it this is a book for you!
B007KQI1NA|5.0|Like the title says.... it works great! No need for drivers in Windows 8. OK, I need six more words.
B003TFUJD6|5.0|Need I say more then my review title?  This is a fun B rated movie from the early 80's that I enjoy watching about once a year.  Yes yes yes I know.  This is a cult classic but I still can't bring myself to watching it once a week or once a month.  But once I saw the 30th anniversary was out on blu-ray with the entire Queen score I just knew I needed to get this.  And it was a very fun purchase.
B00AMBK0X4|2.0|not worth the money,the only good part was maybe the last 15 to 20 minutes not enough to redeem it
B0063GORYU|5.0|Fun game that makes you think while you are having fun. Glad it has more than one level so I can continue to challenge myself.
B00992CF6W|5.0|this game is amazing... but we (all players) need to be satisfied by updates... and so far only two for 6 months
1419705849|5.0|I purchased this book for my 10 year old grandson. He just loved it. Has all of the series up to date.
0316069434|4.0|I've read all Connelly's books and continue to enjoy them. I do feel like some of the heart has gone out of the recurring theme of cop vs. command. Connelly used to make my blood boil reading about the road blocks put in Bosch's way by his superiors. This time it was like, oh yeah, Harry's boss is messing with his investigation, ho hum, who cares? Since the interference never got even a tiny bit in the way of the investigation who could bring themselves to care?<br /><br />I appreciate that the dialogue between Harry and his daughter has grown much more credible. As a parent I often cringe reading books with children saying and doing things I can't imagine happening in real life. It was a real let down when she asked him about his motivation to become a police officer and he makes zero mention of his mother. Really? I hate when I feel like I remember a character's past better than the author.<br /><br />The ending of the Black Box is truly awful, maybe I should give this 3 stars instead of 4, but I enjoyed reading it, and I will probably enjoy the next one too.
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|It's better than my other alarm and it just looks and works better...I wish I could add my music on there tho
B008HT4FUW|5.0|We had heard so much about Downton Abbey but never watched. Now we are caught up and ready for the new season to begin! I bought an extra for a gift.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I love this game because it's a figure it out work as you go kinda inspiration game. The creations of dragons and beauty from many different kinds a dragons are just amazing and if you are a creative and imaginative kinda person that has a fantasizing love over dragons this . Is the perfect game for you!!!!
B002LMV7TS|5.0|Grinch says it best in this movie.  Tons of entertainment and great one liners even the kids can laugh at.  This has to be the best Christmas movie with Jim Carey ever.
B000FBJAOG|3.0|I enjoyed the book but it seems to get repetitive towards the end. Around halfway, I couldn't help but to scan forward because I felt like I had already read this part.<br />The eyewitness accounts at the end are ridiculous but what did I expect? Wait until the price the down a bit
B007SGLZP8|4.0|This is a good story with the typical Grisham slant where the law enforcement officers are the bad guys who perform twisted actions and the thief/thieves are the characters the reader ends up rooting for.  I know Grisham is an attorney and it shows he was probably a defense attorney when he was actively paracticing law.<br />It is a good read as most of Grisham's work is.  Worth buying.  Grisham is a good author.  Interesting story.<br />Also, it may have answered a question I had about a line in the remake of the move &#34;Ocean's 11&#34;...specifically, the term &#34;mini-bar&#34; might have been explained.  Until I read this book, I didn't really know what the term &#34;mini-bar&#34; might have meant in Ocean's 11.  I also think he might have based this story on a far fetched story like Ocean's 11.  Still, it is a good read for the casual reader.
0307346617|5.0|Don't eschew this book because you think it's just another zombie book. It's not. It's literally an oral history of the zombie war, written by and for the survivors of that war. Brilliantly conceived and executed, it was almost impossible to put down. His world building is amazing and so real that its difficult to distinguish from our reality.
B003H9M1Q2|1.0|This DVD will not play on my  blu ray player. According to the description it should work. on all DVD players including bluray :(
B008N3GKNC|3.0|I read the first 4 books, but have been listening to this audiobook. I love this series by George RR Martin, but the reader of the audiobooks leaves much to be desired. Especially annoying is the high nasal voice he gives to all the female characters, so that they all sound like illiterate crones. And why did he choose such an odd accent for Tyrion? In places the reader slurs the names of people and places, leaving the listener confused as to who or what is being referred to. Very disappointing.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Relaxing  game lots of prizes let's you continue your game easily easy to  navigate Great game love the shake points!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|hey, this is a electronic book. naturally you get it quick. the book is the book. i don't know what to comment.
B001F6TXME|5.0|This remote shutter release cord is used with a Nikon D600 camera and works well.  I have no complaints about it.
B00913DPW2|5.0|Fun and challenging puzzle game, with excellent graphics and atmosphere. If you are new to these sort of games, you may want to start with something easier.  Moving on to Haunt 2.
B00013M6NK|5.0|I bought this battery as an extra battery for the Nikon camera which was purchased as a Christmas present for my grand daughter.  It is working great in her new Nikon camera.
B008YU0AOE|5.0|The calculator is very easy to use, just like a regular calculator, but it is much easier to read because of the size. I use it often.
B00A9X9VAI|4.0|This was a great Sci-fi that tried not To get you to think about time-travel but then left you calculating all the possibilities.<br /><br />Gordon-levitt did a great job acting like Willis.
0205313426|5.0|An English teacher in high school first recommended this book. I've read it religiously ever since. This latest re-printing is better than my old 1970's paperback. Another book worth reading is \\"Eats shoots & leaves,\\" which though less dry than Elements of Style, that started as a collection of notes handed out by a college professor.<br /><br />If you are a professional, i.e., a lawyer, doctor, businessman or and engineer, as I am, you must learn to write effectively, clearly, and efficiently. Get this book! Take a weekend to read through it. Elements can be treated as a dictionary, so open a page and start writing better.<br /><br />If this review was helpful, please add your vote.<br /><br />Thanks.
B007FJFDXS|1.0|I had high hopes for this game but it just doesn't measure up. As I direct the cube one way it goes the other, often going off the edge when I was not even going that direction. Disappointing. There are much better games out there.
B00007E7K0|5.0|This product works so much better than trying to use an off brand which doesn't stay on.  This ended up being cheaper than trying the off brand replacement.
B009HV2JT8|3.0|Better than I thought. I rented it because I thought it would be totally stupid, but was surprised it actually was pretty good.
B0051OZ564|5.0|You ten to twenty more minutes of movie an extra song and an awesome extended fight scene are the best parts and some stuff at the end. Good price good service I got nothing to complain about.
0761171703|4.0|Amazing photos but can't imagine why they chose paperback.  This is a &#34;coffee table&#34; book if there ever was one but soft cover just doesn't cut it.
B000BNI99K|5.0|Was a gift for a big Rod Stewart fan, he loved it.  Enjoyed the collaborations on the discs and excited about the DVD.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|I have all their books and they keep getting better waiting for the next book buy two graves for good reading
B00005JKZV|5.0|Having somehow misplaced my copy of the Two Towers sometime over the past couple of years, I finally felt that I should pick up a new one in anticipation of the release of the Hobbit.  This being quite well-priced and delivery from amazon being so convenient, I ordered this, and found it to be as powerful a movie as ever.  Among the three films in the Lord of the Rings trilogy, I am tempted to say that this is my favorite; the first movie resorts to some queer film editing techniques towards the end (the combination of slow-motion capture and the lowered frame rate during several sequences accomplishes nothing and results in a strange feeling) and omits a large number of important scenes from the book, and the last film, while certainly one of the grandest of achievements, also omits some fairly important parts, notably the Scouring of the Shire.  What this film accomplishes is a much more compelling tale and a powerful transcription of the second book.  For all of those reasons I feel this is perhaps the best of an incredible trilogy.
0062082353|4.0|While there were some lulls, overall the book was very good and I really enjoyed reading it. A great story to tell indeed and the author did a great job.
0307272702|5.0|Fully documented and well explained.  Helpful with strategies and methods for success.  Seems that what's needed is a no carb diet-----very limiting and difficult to do.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Loveeee this show! It is a true classic and a breath of fresh air compared to what is shown on tv these days. Great DVD set!
B007PKDW44|5.0|Great cd!! Bought it for my better half, and he loves it! Bluesy rock, good sound, liked it so much bought another cd from this group!
B0079XPUOW|5.0|If you know what a Redshirt is you'll love this book, and if you don't you'll still love it. A quirky, fun, and clever take on the 'world' of Star Trek.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|I love Adele music and the music quality is great. I highly recommend this CD to anyone who likes Adele's music. You'll love it!
1607066017|5.0|If you've always wanted to get into comics, fell away and want to come back, or are just looking for something unique and captivating, Saga is the book for you.  Just buy it!
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|This narrative of wwII action and the lives of the men involved was a great read.  I do highly recommend it.
B008QTVNUI|4.0|It makes the CIA and  FBI look like a bunch of gangsters our vice president like a heartless monster and al quiada as a bunch of good family men who are misunderstood. This whole series could have been written by al quiada. Well thats HELLYWOOD for you.How come these foriegn actors can play americans better than we can very well acted and the scripts are interesting and well done, to bad it has such a anti American slant.
B000FA5SMK|5.0|I have read every one of DeMilles books. John Corey character is my favorite.  Only wish he could write FASTER!
B009D5VNLS|5.0|Excellent movie.  Amazing animation quality and lovely story.  Not your typical princess tale, so a very welcome change.  Really enjoyed watching it with my daughter!
193609648X|5.0|I have been crocheting for over 40 years and had stopped in 2009, since I learned to knit.  After buying this book I am excited once again to crochet.  Highly recommend this book; you do need to have moderate skills at least, before buying.  If not, I recommend the Lion Brand website for free Crocheting and Knitting instructions.
B007ZGBZHE|4.0|Preston and Child are great story tellers with believable and well rounded characters. Pendergast, the protagonist, is not warm or fuzzy but you still love him.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|Was bored so thought I would try Angry Birds and finding it a bit addictive. Now I understand what the hype was and is about.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I enjoyed this book it really kept me intrigued. Would recommend to anyone. It grabs your attention from beginning to end.
B003WMA7BU|2.0|There are writing features of this book that I enjoyed, but overall it is a shallow, weak story with unengaging characters.
1452110581|5.0|THIS BOOK IS CHARMING! I BOUGHT IT AS A CHRISTMAS GIFT FOR A CAT-LOVER FRIEND FROM HER THREE LITTLE KITTIES AND SHE LOVES IT AS WELL. POEMS AND PHOTOS ARE DELIGHTFUL
B008ROH07W|5.0|Am a great fan of trumpet music, and this CD was a real delight.  I am going to have to stop playing it on my car CD or I will wear it out.
B003B02O0A|5.0|While I've read previous Grisham works, I was glad to finally pick up this book.  Grisham's storytelling is fantastic.  Highly recommend!
B00280WCH4|4.0|My wife has always been a Celine Dion fan, and she therefore asked that we get this CD for the holiday season. Personally I'm not a fan, which is why I only give four stars. The delivery was fast and timely.
1609611543|5.0|This book is a well written, easy to understand and at times humorous look at the facts and science behind genetically modified wheat and the unforeseen consequences of that process.
B008AX1HD8|2.0|By far the worst book I've read by Jo Nesbo. Harry Hole no longer inspires me to sympathy. At best, he now irritates me mightily
B0086213XW|1.0|This film is annoying.  I generally think Michelle Williams makes good choices, but I can't understand what she saw in this material.  I didn't care for any of the characters, and the story is inane.
B004DM1ZQY|4.0|Works great on my 7&#34; tablet and MyTouch 4G phone.  No problems running the app.  Worth the making the purchase.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Fascinating story line. Kept me hooked from beginning to end! Love it!! Looking forward to reading more from Matthew Quick
B004HX4RT6|4.0|App easy to use.  You can increase the level of play with various options on how you want to play the game.  Installed on 7&#34; tablet and cell phone.  Worth the purchase price.
B0098VXBIA|2.0|I had high hopes that this movie would be funny and quite entertaining...boy was I wrong! There were brief moments that I may have chuckled and there were moments of excitement when &#34;Joe Manganiello&#34; occasionally would appear throughout the movie, but overall very disappointed.
B009NPA3Q4|5.0|I loved the entire CD. It has Mumford & Sons and Dave Matthews style music, but each with the unique Phillip Phillips style to them. Great job! Definitely looking forward to the next Phillip Phillips album!
B003O86FMW|4.0|I feel like Peeta plays a greater part in this book. Rather than the connection with Katniss that I felt in the first book, I think that I'm beginning to like Peeta a little more. I'm just ready to find out about district 13 and what's going on with Peeta in the next book.
B002UM5BXW|3.0|This book was just okay. I enjoyed his restaurant stories but could have done without the kitchen/cooking tips. If you are interested in cooking more than a casserole, then maybe you would enjoy it more than I did.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|This book starts pretty slow, when he talks about his life and schooling in India,but if you keep reading it gets a lot better after he is shipwrecked. The book ends with a complete turn of events that leaves the reader questioning what he/she has read. All in all, a good book.
B000HC2LI0|5.0|I am presently starting the fifth season and I have not encounter any problems sofar with any of the disc, the picture is great. If you are a fan like my wife and I you shall not be disappointed ( sofar)
B005FISC52|5.0|This was a gift to a friend, they have enjoyed it a lot! This person in house bound and enjoys these shows.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Why did I ever waste trees to print out all of those books  I have?  So much easier to carry my phone into the doctors waiting room than a book.
B00632HWOG|5.0|I haven't been on yahoo in a long time but<br />recently I needed a new email and thought<br />of yahoo.<br />I was amazed at how the email layout made<br />getting through my mail a breeze.<br />What a great site!
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|My son loves this game.  It's actually a family favorite, after Angry Birds, of course.  You can't go wrong with this.
B007V5CF5K|1.0|HALF WAY THROUGH GAME and can't get one piece of the record to be able to continue.  Game also closes out in MIDDLE of SCENES six different times it started back to menu  I want my money back
B005KELQEU|4.0|I'm so happy I purchased this cover.  It's lightweight and protects my Kindle so very well.  I carry my Kindle in the cover at all times in my purse.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I really liked it, keeps you in suspense throughout, it's the type of book you don't want to put down...
B008YRVW0I|3.0|Tiles were small and the aquarium was blah.  the action was fine but with the smalll tiles it was hard to control which tile was being moved.
B0001EFTVA|5.0|I'm happy I waited until I was 28 to watch this. Had I seen it in my 'all anime must be violent and over the top' phase, its beauty would be lost on my idiot brain back then.<br /><br />Buy this, watch it and soak up the story, the music, the characters, the details, the...everything.
B0053TMP24|5.0|PERCY TURNS INTO A FAT OLD LADY! In this book, Percy has to pay a bill. Read his (her) adventure!
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I found this book to be very thought inspiring.  The first 2/3 of the book deals with how one person, Pi, accepted the best of three religions.  He grew in faith and stature.  The second 1/3 of the book is great reading also as he dealt with the tiger and survival tactics.
B00A9X9TIW|3.0|This movie could have been great - the story was fascinating, the acting was good across the board, the dialog was believable. The trouble was it fell into the trap of being so dark and brooding it was hard to like it completely. I get that the future is a dark, scarey place, I've been told that by many other near-future movies, and I'm tired of the message. In more skillful hands this could have been another Benjamin Button, instead it was vaguely unsatisfying. Too  bad, because it had great promise. Still, it's not a terrible way to kill a couple of hours on a rainy afternoon.
B008ELUEQC|5.0|Love that Roddy kept the songs on the traditional side..can't improve upon the classics..love his voice..get addition to my xmas collection
B0085P2Z6E|5.0|Very fun game... hate that I finished.  Graphics and story were awesome. I would definitely recommend.  It is worth the. 99 cents.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|This was a well written and engaging book. It kept me intrigued and wanting to know the truth. It was a very quick and easy read with twists and turns.
B000FC10WU|5.0|Anything Agatha Christie writes is excellent.  I've never read anything of hers that I disliked.  I prefer Hercule Poirot books, but Miss Marple is also grand.  You can't go wrong with Agatha!
B000NDI3SK|5.0|Excellent in my personal opinion, though dated dress. The transaction was smooth as it could be. The product is good. I recommend both the seller and product to any who are interested.
0920668372|1.0|A relative gave us this for Christmas, and I just tried to read it to my infant son. Good thing he's still too young to understand!!!! The bad vibes started off on page 1, when the mother tells her baby that she'll love him as long as SHE lives. It sounded kind of foreboding to me, but I thought I was being oversensitive--a children's book that isn't about grieving wouldn't kill off the mother, would it?<br /><br />Then things got worse. The mother's creeping along the floor to sing to her kid, whom apparently she can't stand during the day. NOTHING positive is said about the child, and the mother never appears in the daytime picture--he's just running wild, and she's off somewhere slowly going postal. At this point, I thought, \\"Well, it's just clumsy. But surely....\\"<br /><br />And then worse! The mother drives across town with a ladder to sneak into her adult son's room. So people say it's allegory; I say they're missing the whole picture. I can see how it's trying for \\"sweet,\\" but in context it just reads as \\"yet another horrible decision the author made.\\"<br /><br />Then, yeah. Then the mother dies. I can see preparing a child for the death of a grandparent or a pet, but I absolutely do NOT want my son thinking about me aging and dying (and calling him from my death bed so he can cuddle me into oblivion, apparently?) until he's too old for a children's book.<br /><br />It's NOT a children's book; not really. I agree with reviewers who say that this is more for mothers. Needy, insecure mothers who desperately want the validation of seeing their love written into a book that is supposedly appropriate for their kids. If you want to keep this on your own shelf so you can read it now and then and say, \\"Yes: this is how I feel and this is what I hope for,\\" then go with it. But don't pretend that it's really \\"for\\" anyone but you.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This is a great novel.  It is completely different then any other book I have read.  It had a great story, although the beginning is a bit slow, it has to set the stage for character development
B009DTHZNE|5.0|three dvds are not enough, i love every detail and every song, for a real pearl jam fan, the best investment!
B0095ZMMCK|3.0|Threat Vector - some overkill on computer data but Clancy continues with massive in depth research to produce an excellent book.
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|Loved the story line. The animation was very good and life like. The script moved alond with no dull slow downs,
0525953728|5.0|This book is enthralling!  Kept me interested and locked-in for hours!  Easy read. First-class account of the ending to the life of  the terrorist BinLaden
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|my wife and I have watched this series ongoing from the start (currently on Netflix). We enjoy is so much, we have continued to watch on Amazon. Only 2 more episodes until we have to wait for more.
B002QS1O36|3.0|I like the actors but I really had to take breaks away from it.  I wasn't the least bit enthralled.
B009VSW15Y|3.0|The bad part is you can only take frontal pictures. Although the photos are clear you can't take pictures of the family
B009MCRHH6|5.0|frustrating at times but if you keep at it you will get it. that is what makes it good.keeps you coming back for more
0891419063|5.0|I did a project in history and my professor recommended that i should read this.  At first i shrugged it off, figuring that i would just skim through the book for quotes.  I then read the entire book and nearly kicked myself for almost missing out on this work.  Sledge writes with great respect to his fellow marines and maintains a level of humility that makes this such a great read.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Like it so far. No issues with kindle fire. My kids and I love it we are excited to see what the end would be.
B007SGM084|5.0|Considering the hype this got, this review is self-explanatory.  I'm sure parts of it will be read over and over again.  LOL!
B000I9X53W|4.0|overpriced but great movie, nothing more to say about it but I can not understand why old movies no matter how good are almost 10 dollars
B00000CQJZ|3.0|Having read the book and seen the film several times, I prefer the book. The dead person in Hannay's flat is a man and there is no beautiful blonde woman involved in the book, but knowing that Hitchcock had a love for blonde women, it is understandable, that there had to be one in it.  Also the 39 steps in the book refer to a house at the coast, where the steps go down to the beach to a boat. Still the film is full of suspense and well worth watching.<br />Rosemarie MacDonald
B00APUYWYA|5.0|Such a great movie. I liked the songs and the quirkiness of the movie. Great voices and funny movie. I can watch this movie again and again.
B004J4WLB4|4.0|This was selected for our book club.  I'm glad I read it.  The main character was a fascinating and troubled young girl because of her early life.  This book gave me some understanding into how difficult life can be for abandond children and how hard it is to adjust to a normal existence.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Just started watching this show this month and I am hooked. I like the story line and it is not what I expected.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|I really enjoyed the book. It was thought provoking and a very interesting read. I hope there are more books to come. I still have unanswered questions.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|I watched the first season and I was not going to miss the second season. I love horror films and shows especially when you can't tell the ending before it happens.
B004FEL6GO|4.0|These new transformers really show off the improvements in mold injected plastic over the last 2 decades.  There are far more moving parts than in prior designs, but that's mostly a good thing.  They are much more impressive, but they also break more easily and are much harder to switch back and forth from car to robot.  It takes me (At 29) about 3 minutes to switch this one from one state to the other.  My 4 year old can't do it in any amount of time. Also, it is a bit smaller than you might expect, about 3&#34; long, but still a pretty good size for the price.
B0025KVLUQ|5.0|Was great to finally find this on cassette.<br />Listen to it all the time.<br />Love the Beatles and their music.
B0037VNX44|5.0|I was shocked out of my mind by the beauty of this film. It is funny, endearing and it made me so sad. I watched it once then watched it again. I will say it is not for the faint of heart, or those who believe in censorship. There is a bear knuckle fight sort of violence in it and a fair bit of nudity, but not a sensual sort, honestly I didn't really notice until the end. Absolutely worth every minute. I watched it on prime, but now i'm going to order a copy for keeps.
B001TCHDPS|3.0|Hhis music has been compared to Dylan but I find his music much easier to listen to, understand and more meaningful.
B002Q1YDLI|5.0|5 stars. I finished the book in one day, I couldn't put it downEmily Griffin is a great author. I can't wait go read her next one
B008WCP2KG|4.0|I really liked the story & obviously half naked men helped. The only thing I didn't like was the female lead! She sucked!
B00A6PD9I4|4.0|Brave is a very cute family movie with incredible graphics. If you can, try to watch in HD on a big screen.
1419705849|5.0|nice version of a popular series - my nephew immediately told his sister: you can keep the paperback and i'll keep this hard cover.  Kids DO still want books to read - not just Kindle and Nook.
B009MCRHH6|4.0|I am really enjoying the game. It is beautifully made and a lot of fun. However, it is clearly not optimized for smaller screens/smart phones. It can be really hard to place the goo where you want it to go when you can't see around your finger and the zoom function seems to be broken. Awesome game otherwise, and probably a lot more fun on the computer or tablet with a stylus.
B000TLMWLK|5.0|My mum loved Johnny Cash and The Best of the Johnny Cash TV Show was one of the few I could find. She loved it and watches it alot!!
B0081SPK0I|3.0|FF2R is a fun old school arcade racing game. Decent graphics, good controls with both button and tilt steering options. However, there is one little problem. I have a Samsung Galaxy S 4G with t-mobile and the menus display no text. I was able to figure out the menus through trial and error, but I can't help but dock the star rating for that problem. Other than that, no complaints.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I absolutely LOVED this book! I could not put it down until I finished it you should consider doing a sequel to it.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I read Orwell's 1984 a few years ago, and that left me with a bad taste of totalitarian governments in general.  Reading the Hunger Games resurrected that feeling and yet added a renewed sense of hope, love, friendship, humanity, and freedom that I was not expecting. This book by Suzanne Collins is a masterpiece filled with suspense, engaging you to become very cautious of what is going on around you as you read, yet forcing you to trust your natural instincts and abilities to survive as the story unfolds. You read this from the perspective of the protagonist, Miss Katniss Everdeen.  I enjoyed this so much, I am now reading the second book, Catching Fire, which takes place shortly after the Games conclude.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|I would recommend this book to anyone looking for a good read. It is such an uplifting story that takes you through the highs and lows of the high school times. At many points throughout the book you will be able to put yourself in Charlie's shoes and really go through this with him.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Addicting I can't stop playing thks game it's super fun and I can't quit. I almost want to buy coins because it's so addicting. Easy come easy go.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Definitely a page turner. I couldn't put it down, and i can't wait to read the next one. You can never guess what's going  to happen next
B00AHSIQWE|2.0|after the dark knight batman had big shoes to fill and this movie was just not capable of doing it.
B0018QQQK8|4.0|This book is really good!!it keeps u want to keep reading it I finished it in like 2 days because I didn't want t o put down!!I just can't say anything else but it's an awesome book to read!
B009JZTOG8|5.0|this show is amazingly imaginative. There are twists and turns in every episode and nearly every fairy tale character you have ever been introduced to has a part to play in this series.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Only took me a day and a half to read. Couldn't put it don't once I started! Way better than the movie!
B00A6N8F4Y|5.0|great story. very imaginative.  i would highly recomend this story to any looking for a good flick. the twist ending was good as well.
B008QTV3X0|5.0|This is a great series - I can't wait for Season 2!  The acting is incredible and the plot is very engaging.
B009HV2JT8|3.0|i personally felt this lincoln was a better fit than the lincoln from the self titled movie. it was a fairly interesting story but it seemed to drag on.
0679731377|1.0|Interesting title, beautiful writing at times, but not much history unless you<br />consider the story of Noah to constitute all of human endeavors. Barnes' style<br />and humor work wonderfully well in \\"Flaubert's Parrot\\" and shine here and there<br />in this work but the lack of any coherent framework leaves one wondering<br />if it's really worth struggling through 10.5 chapters. I enjoyed the phrasing in<br />several chapters but not much comes to mind when you finish and look back to see<br />what you've learned or what you will hold onto tomorrow or the day after. But two<br />chapters (the half chapter Parenthesis and the tenth chapter The Dream) are a<br />lot of fun and quite clever. My advice - read these two and skip the rest.
B00A9C3RB8|5.0|I wasn't sure about this movie until I watched it. And man was it awesome. Totally true to life relationship scenarios. It had me laughing and crying, often simultaneously! Watch it!
B0076DELIG|3.0|I usually buy Connelly's novels within a day or so of release, as I did with this one. It was a &#34;good read,&#34; as always, but the plot was not as energetic and driving as one finds in many of the author's books.
B00A6PD8RQ|4.0|The movie was good I just thought that it could have been more.  The picture quality was awesome and had no complaints.
0812984412|4.0|These 6 stories in one book, each fascinating, highly imaginative, and captivating  enough for me to want to get back to reading every evening --  at least a few pages before bedtime  --  were well worth reading, but I must admit I had done so because I was captured by the movie and wanted to understand concepts and details better.  This book was a launching pad for that movie.  I don't say that to be demeaning or critical but the book is just a start.  Some of the other reviewers here seem to understand the ouvre of the book way better than I did  -- it was not so obvious to me that the stories were interlinked, except by  deliberate intertwining and writing style --  as I did not find the characters were themes recurring and other than brief mention of a birthmark, if my final grade depended on explaining how the stories all tied together, I'm not sure I'd be able to.<br /><br />This was an unusual situation for me where the movie was better than the book, at least in terms of my simple enjoyment, but more important in the sense of having understood something bigger or better after finishing.<br /><br />Regardless, I recommend it  as a fun read, particularly because of some of the vivid  imagery,  Historical idiosyncrasy and dystopian fancy. The nonlinearity of the interlocking stories were more of a literary tool or technique than a literary necessity<br /><br />I hope the author enjoyed the way it was produced into a movie. I did.  It was  clearer and more expansive.<br /><br />No doubt I will shortly order more of David Mitchell's writing just to see what else he has done and how, so in that sense my world has been expanded.<br /><br />I plan on going back to see the movie again but I'm going to wait until it comes out on DVD because of the peculiarities of the accents and the advantage of subtitles.<br /><br />Thank you Mr. Mitchell.
0060989157|5.0|Love this book. Came brand new in packaging. well worth the money . A great read, a must have if you are a Crue Head.
B004J4WKTW|3.0|This was a good book.  I won't say great because it really isn't in my normal genre and I thought it was a little to drug out.  The ending was not nearly as exciting as I hoped it to be.
B00785P2QC|5.0|User friendly. very addictive I can't put it down. Best game I've run across in a very long time. Facebook games just do not compare.
0345803507|1.0|Struggled through Fifty Shades so much so that I didn't read the other two.  I guess I'm just not into bondage - straight sex is great though.
B008FPOIT6|5.0|I'm 81 years old and I've been reading more than 100 books a year for as long as I can remember, and &#34;Mr. Penumbra's 24-Hour Book Store&#34; is, by far, the best book of the lot!
0811879542|5.0|You can have so much fun with this book. My 5 year old son loves it. He calls it the 'MAGIC' book. I am looking for books of the same caliber to buy.
B00AMBK0X4|2.0|To immature for an adult but to much adult language for a child. I did not watch the whole thing.
B0083Z614S|5.0|I read this with my ten year old granddaughter who was reading it for a school project.  It is easy reading and delightful.
B008FRFN7A|1.0|I could not figure out how to install it after trying 4 hours!  Very poor documentation.  I expect better from HP.
159102594X|5.0|Excellent. Good read, great characters and a good introduction to fantasy. You will end up reading the whole series. Read it.
B002RI9M2U|5.0|This book has been amazingly constructed with very vivid and extremely intelegently linked characters through various events. This book is the first ever book i have actually enjoyed and even enough i would love to read again. The story is so gripping i couldn't put the book down while at the same time my heart was dying from the events within. This book makes you see the world differently and makes you vow to treat people differently! A must read book! 10/10
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book was so amazing; I read it in two days, only stopping to eat. In fact, it was so gripping and suspenseful that I read it while using the bathroom. I recommend this book for readers ages twelve (my age) and up. Seeing how hard it is to find great child appropriate books these days, I was very satisfied with this book. Thank you, Suzanne Collins.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book was amazing. I would read it over and over again. Best series ever made. Suzanne did an amazing job.
B009JBZH54|5.0|They have tried a few times to make Batman a good movie- but come on, we are dealing with a comic book here- Burton tried and did well, and then the series fell into a remake of the TV show with Adam West. Dumb. This is actually an interesting series, Batman is not the story, but merely another character in an interesting series. But it is still a comic book hero , so lets not take this too seriously
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Wow!  Can't believe that this book was better than book one!  Can't wait to start book 3!  Ordering it now!
B003CRM6QO|5.0|I collect movies, some I get becasue I want them, others to fill n holes on my shelf. I remmebered this as being a lot better, oh well
B00A0SKFLG|4.0|The first movie captured the uniqueness of the story. The second attempt was significantly more polished, vastly offsetting the loss of not being &#34;first&#34;. I still am lost concerning the significance of a woman with 3 mammary glands in which they are literally given center stage!!!<br />  I had read anemic reviews of this 2nd version, but I felt that the cinematography, acting and its rapid pace combined quite nicely to provide a much better viewing experience.<br /> Overall I would definitely give it 4 out of 5 stars. It might be easier if the scoring system went to 10 stars to allow those who would like to give a score of less then 1 (not feasible), or vacillating over a score of 3 or 4 or 4 rather than 5. If we were to use that system, I would score the first as 6-7, and the 2nd, as 7-8.
B0000VD04M|5.0|This is great on two levels- the study of the worst director ever- Ed Wood and the terrific job Tim Burton does in portarying a group of very odd people.
B0095XPZBC|5.0|It is really nice to see these episodes in HD and surround sound!!!!! Really mkes it appear to be a new show. The extras included are very informative! I would recommend this to everyone.
B000P0J09M|5.0|This takes place near where I grew up and when I was a teenager. While I did now know these guys, I knew a lot like them- ah memories
B008K6HN8I|1.0|I added this and dolphin browser downloaded but neither one would not install.<br />I have the files but cannot open them.
B0028RXXE8|5.0|I got hooked on the series when I was reading about how true to actual Roman times the story was- clothing, religion, food, etc. Well worth a few hours if you like Toga soap operas
B0091REZMW|4.0|it is more challenging then others i have played.  it is always a relaxing game and I enjoy playing it with my daughter.
B00APUQRPC|4.0|I'm no Justin T. fan but didn't even know who it was until after i watched, he did fine.<br />I always like Clint's movies and after watching it still holds true.
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|This was a pleasant surprise. I had this book in TODO list for a long time but I would not pick it up unless I would stumble upon it in the Amazon's Christmas daily deal. And I could tell you I got loads of music for two bucks :)<br /><br />Book reminded me often of the Harry Potter books but unlike them it is well written. It's not the best writing I came across but it was enough to notice. I particularly liked the choice of the words and imaginative comparisons (that were not forced just for sake of it). Story is also more based in today reality which was something I didn't expected thanks to the book's cover. If I should still compare it to the Harry Potter books (book is not that related, only similar themes are young main protagonist, hidden world and supernatural elements), author does not ignore adult themes and there is no silly childishness around.<br /><br />Story itself is highly entertaining but whenever I didn't read I had problem to accept lots of things that happened there but this feeling was gone after few pages whenever I get back to it. World itself, as described in the book, sounds interesting and I really liked the concept of the [spoiler-backwards]spool emit detsen[spoiler] uncovered at the end of the book. Planned sequel could be quite interesting and it seems it would not follow the same story structure.<br /><br />PS: There are lots of photos in the book like the one on the cover but unlike another reviewer I didn't have any problems with them (and with the handwritten letters) on my Kindle - maybe because new Paperwhite have larger resolution.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This is a great series and it will keep you watching for hours because it is so intriguing. I highly recommend all three seasons.
B009OYSFDM|4.0|Good and entertaining!  Pretty good character development with several different people to root for and against. You have to suspend your disbelief a good bit but when isn't that true in the super hero genre.  Solid.
B009ERK1T0|5.0|Awesome cd not one bad song on it.  Chino is real. Deftones are real!  Going to see them in South Beach in March. Again!!!!
B0094KF4WG|4.0|Just the right balance between build- up and the actual attack on Osama bin Laden. Realistic explanation of the hard training required for top soldiers.
B0086700CM|5.0|Temple Run is a fun game for anyone who likes action or fast pace games. I would say that Temple Run is my favorite game of all time.I highly recomend it for anyone.
B00A9X9TIW|2.0|I didn't like this movie. I rented it because I generally like Bruce and his part was OK, the young guy left me cold and sort of disinterested.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|This is a really fun and challenging game!  my only complaint is I would love more levels!  Works great on the kindle fire.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|This is a great games.  It has great graphics,  is full Length,  makes sense and has great hints!  I love it am eager to move on to the next episode.
B000F8O35U|5.0|My Great Grandaughter's favorite movie but it was scratched real bad. The DVD was not snapped in the case so it got scratched. What happoens now?
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I loved this book!  I'm an \\"older\\" reader and like to read teen/young adult books now and then to keep some perspective as I raise my own daughters.  Some of them are so superficial.  I'm also a child/adolescent therapist.  This book touched on a real and devastating issue and how the mind copes.  Very well written and realistic.  The emerging sexual relationship between the main characters actually has depth and I love how the nature and intensity of the relationship are explained via the plot.  Great read!
B00571F26Y|5.0|I have celiac disease & this book makes sense!  Very useful for me & my family...I enjoyed this book and recomend it too eveyone with or without Celiac Disease.
B00846REIS|4.0|If you liked fifty shaded of grey you will enjoy this series. Very well written, I am anxiously waiting for book three.
B004EBT5CU|4.0|I am enjoying this cd very much. Like with many artists I am just becoming familiar with, I find it is growing on my each time I listen.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|In November of 1963, I was a sophomore at Bishop Fenwick High School in Peabody, Massachusetts. That Friday in November stands as clear in my memory as any day in my life. Later, as the Vietnam War exploded, I came to regard 11/22/63 as \\"the day the music died\\". (Apologies to Buddy Holly et al).<br />I'm sure that many of us who came of age in that time have fantasied about going back in time to prevent that event.<br />King crafts a thrilling page turner around that fantasy. I couldn't put it down.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|I bought these to get ready for season 3 airing on 1/6/13. One of my favorite shows. It really depicts that time in history well.
B005LAIISA|4.0|My grandson loved it!!  He's 2yr old and sits and watches it over and over.  Glad Santa brought it to him!
B008HT4FUW|5.0|Love Downton Abbey! A must have for your movie library and a great deal offered by Amazon. So ready for the 3 season. If you are not already hooked get this set and you will be !
B009GN6DT4|4.0|I don't think they could ever redo this film better.  But, it's a great entry to the world of aliens and aliens that don't want to kill us.  If you've not seen it, you're missing out!
B000PMLFRA|4.0|This review is of the Blu-ray trilogy with the blue-tinted cover and the large profile picture of Darth Vader.  The package contains three Blu-ray discs in a single case.  The movies themselves are not the theatrical editions; they are the later releases that include the embarrassingly juvenile edits and new scenes added by Lucas.  Thankfully, the masterpiece of the trilogy, Empire Strikes Back, is uncluttered with these changes and remains fairly true to the theatrical edition.  In spite of these minor flaws, the movies are still wonderful, with excellent picture and sound quality.  I used these to introduce my four year old son to the series while sparing him the misery of watching the three worst movies of all time, Episodes I, II, and III.  He loves watching them, particularly The Return of the Jedi.  They are still terrific films after all these years.
B005J0VPNC|5.0|i cant take a picture if i hired a photographer to hold the camera. this app makes it simple and the filter presets are pretty good. get this. i was lucky to get it as an app of the day so it was worth every penny, but i would pay for it.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|A must read if you haven't already. This is my second time reading and it was just as poignant as the first. Can't wait to start the second book again.
B00622B3MY|3.0|Not nearly as good as the original but my two-year old has it on heavy rotation and loves it, so if your child loves Cars, I'd say go ahead and purchase.
0345803485|4.0|The first of the trilogy, I was disappointed in however the second and third books I really enjoyed.  However, you have to read the first book to understand the second and third.....it really just sets up the other two.
0143145150|5.0|This was required reading for school and our bookstore sold out fast.  I ordered this for my childs summer reading requirements.
B008F9E306|3.0|Good album but sounds to much like everything else he's ever wrote. Hits hard on a few tracks. Bit really not worth the money.
B0064TVQ5E|2.0|This was a free download so I can't complain about the price, but it is not much fun to play.
B00AB0AR2U|4.0|I have always enjoyed the resident evil movies and this installment did not disappoint. The movies are corny and often poorly written but still have great effect quality. This said, I enjoyed it for exactly what it is.
B0063IH60K|3.0|Not bad.  You can block out whatever is going on around you and play some solitaire without a deck of cards or having to shuffle them.
B0095R6OBS|5.0|This anime does good job explaining those kids questions like &#34;How'd they do that?&#34;  Doesn't scare because kids realize it's not real life!
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|This is a game that you don't have to do a lot of thinking about, just tap the screen to drop a coin and keep going until you run out.  Like the ability of selling back your prizes for more coins.
B004FEL6GO|5.0|Youngest grandson loves it!  Heard he sleeps with this toy.  One of the toys he doesn't share with anyone at home.
B0083DJWGO|5.0|Excellent &#34;outside-the-box&#34; insights and irreverent perspectives on our world.  I would recommend this book to all those who enjoy a fresh viewpoint.
B009JBZH54|5.0|was amazing gift for my girlfriend who loves all the extras in movies, she loved this movie and loves the extras discs and the art book. 3 movies and 2 extras for a total of 5 blurays for 25$ is a steal. not to mention its a top rated movie, i would expect 50$ for this.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|I was very lucky to stumble upon this product, while looking for a Christmas gift for my daughter. The price couldn't be beat and the shipping was very reasonable. It arrived in a timely manner and the recipient was very pleased.
B001YYQ9SS|5.0|perfect gift for my girlfriend who loves final fantasy, got her a few other games to go with this. .
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Gets you hooked right from the start. It's an easy read and I would recommend it to all ages. Loved it!
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|well written, complex characters. Love the chemistry between Diana and Matthew. I keep reading again and again. Worth every penny.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|I bought Plague for my Kindle Fire HD, and wow this game is addicting. Who would have thought destroying the World could be this fun. Tip: You can speed up time by using the fast-forward option near the top right hand part of the screen. I highly recommend this fun and addicting game.
B002VPE1B6|5.0|I only wish I could project it onto<br />an IMAX in my livingroom!  I felt<br />like I was there with them.
B000U0F7RG|5.0|I already owned the Gilmore Girls Complete series, but through several moves and borrowers much of the discs had been lost.  The packaging, I think is wonderful, despite not fitting on a normal DVD shelf.  As most people owning or viewing the series will be teenagers or older, as long as a decent amount of care is taken with the discs and peckaging, I would think they would hold up very well.
B000AMPZF8|5.0|What a superb blend of raucous guitar, magnetic vocals, exploding drums and bass within a mixing pot of symphonic and electronica that steams and bubbles  until the final cut which makes the pot boil over - I love this. More! More! More!
B00499QUK2|5.0|I have seen the Sherlock series multiple times.  After watching the first series for the second time on Netflix I felt that it made more sense to buy the series.  I plan to buy the secind series soon.<br /><br />This modern re-imagining of  Sherlock Holmes is decidedly addicting to me.  By telling the store more from a second person point of view (though when switched toward first person it is mostly John's POV) it makes Sherlock equally more aggravating and endearing.<br />He sees himself above others, but from the outside you know that he is struggling to fit into a world that has great difficulty accomadating him.  The mysteries are interesting always feature a clever twist.  As I have watched multiple times, I see new things everytime that make me want to watch again and again.
0307744434|5.0|I am so glad I bought this book.  I loved it from the first few pages.  The characters are lively and lovely, some you will come to know better than others, but that is perfectly part of the story.  I truly immersed myself in the descriptions, visually, olfactory, and more...and I normally grow irritated and bored with long, overly detailed description passages.  Not so with The Night Circus.  This book is a gem.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|Have been thinking about starting this series for a longtime. After seeing the movie trailer, I decided it was time, I wasn't disappointed. I love a good mystery. Couldn't figure it out until the last moment and then still wasn't sure! Enjoyed it very much and look forward to Jack and his travels as the series continues.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|great book - i enjoyed it very much. It downloaded onto my pc and then onto my Kindle<br /><br />I think the kindle is great.
B0058VW36U|5.0|Best game ever! Their are so much levels to try and beat. Their are three seasons and inside the seasons are boxes and inside those boxes are levels!
B00506NRBS|5.0|EXCELLENT BOOK - TRYING TO GET MY WIFE TO READ IT.  VERY INTERESTING STORY. L L L L L LL
B009FZHYKU|5.0|The Walking Dead, I call a night time soap opera [like so many of the night time dramas on now] wich is what gets you hooked.What's gonna happen next,who will start a relationship with who,who will die next,and who will join the cast in the future,ect..Then throw in survival and zombies lurking around the next bend really adds to the mix.I'm fussy on what I call a favorite show,and the Walking dead at this time on tv is my favorite.
B004SKJTY6|5.0|excellent book. I got in on my Kindle, everything worked fine. ok ok ok ok ok o kok ok o k
B0091UGEVY|4.0|The  movie  is  a  new  twist to an  old  classic its  story  brings a  new  and refreshing  twist  to  an  already  legendary story the  cinematography and  choreography  is  well  done. furthermore  the  character development  is  quite  interesting in its  own  right this  is  something I  recommend seeing it  is adventure  from the first few minutes check it  out
B007CKB2AS|5.0|Bruce delivers with a different style on many of the tracks. Great album from one of the world's great artists.
B007IXWKUK|1.0|This author isn't very good at writing. I didn't really see any sort of plot throughout the book and the sex scenes were just blah. Not for me.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|big fan of the Kindle reading software. I have it on all my android devices and use it nightly before I go to sleep.
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|I thought the book was a pretty easy read, not too predictable, but not too &#34;where di that come from&#34;.  I really like an author who can throw out a lot of strings, and artfully tie them all up in the end, preferably without offending my intelligence.  It was all a dream... their an alien... hidden super powers... give me luck, intelligence, attention to previously mentioned but not highlighted details and I'm happy.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I suffer from tinnitus, this app really helps provide a non-intrusive background noise which helps me fall, and stay, asleep.  Timer function is great, good variety of sounds.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|love this app it kept me entertained while I was at kids practice<br />it was challenging at times and made me use brain
B007NESBK2|5.0|Since the '80s, I've been a huge fan of Sade, so of course I'm giving this DVD 5 stars. I've had the pleasure of seeing her last June in Baltimore, MD and there wasn't an empty seat in the entire arena---enough said. If you love Sade, then you must must MUST get this, especially if you haven't been to her concert(s).
B004GUSG4M|1.0|This novel was so boring. There was a feeling you could read the first chapter and then know what the second chapter<br />would bring.
B00AIQP9DE|3.0|Game is a lot of fun, but it seems dishonest to offer it as a &quot;free&quot; game when there is a $2.99 charge if you want to actually finish the game. Game is a 5 star game but only gave it 3 stars because of the misleading fee.
1451695195|5.0|This is an incredible book. It is a wonderful explanation of spirituality from the point of view of a man who is a scientist and had a compelling experience.
B004QX07G4|5.0|Ellen is indeed a comic. I watch<br />her TV program every week. She always makes my day better.  Love her.
B004LWZWGA|5.0|Loved every bit of this movie. Great price on amazon at time I'd purchased.  Everyone in the household liked it down to our 4 year old daughter.  Great addition to the franchise and our DVD collection.
B004IAKU9O|5.0|I saw only about half of the movie on a cable channel and didn't know the name of it.  I'm so glad I found it. I loved the movie.
B003FSTN52|5.0|I didn't start watching this series until the second season so I purchased the first season dvd and loved it...brought me right up to date on the show, which is now my favorite show.  Amazon does such a good job in getting product to you so quickly and efficiently.
B000X5SPBI|5.0|Took awhile longer to get then I wanted but love the series! Jensen is good eye candy!! Can't wait to get the rest of the series.
B0079XPUOW|4.0|A fun read for people who are at least somewhat familiar with sci-fi television tropes.  Actually, if you regularly watched any adventure-type series you'd get what is going on here.<br /><br />Good characters, pacing, plot, and writing overall.  My only issues were that I had a little bit of trouble with the main characters having similar names (it is probably just me and may even have been purposeful) and some of the rapid dialog (specifically when you are trying to wrap your head around the multiple levels of reality in the book).<br /><br />You don't see too much self-aware fiction out there and if you've read the description you know what I'm talking about by self-aware.  This was a fun read but be ready to do something thinking about the implications.<br /><br />The codas at the end were interesting as well.  You don't normally see authors doing this much post-script writing and I'm a little conflicted as to what I think.  You could argue the author was cheating his way out of tying up some loose ends within the novel.  That said, the novel really stands alone without the codas, they just give us a little more closure so I'm going with the idea they are bonus chapters or stand-alone short stories.<br /><br />Overall I'd recommend this book for people who enjoy sci-fi, humorous sci-fi, or sci-fi television.
B009VB97EY|3.0|Magic Mike was ok, Have seen the Chips and they would knock your socks off! End of my review Thank You
B007IXWKUK|1.0|People were talking about it and nothing but sexbut I have not had a good  commit from anyone.<br />I hopr Mr. James takes is money and good to a whore house and gets a nice desease with it.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|So many factual details combined with the twists King is so famous for. Really makes you wonder \\"What if???\\" I couldn't put it down!
B007IXWL2C|1.0|I can not understand how anyone would put this crap in writing. I would not reccomend it to any or take it to the grave yard<br />for disposal
B00006LFGD|4.0|Loved the idea of duets some were better than others.  A good classic for my record collection.  Like cd's of that era.
B00AJRQLTI|5.0|This soundtrack is AMAZING! I was dissapointed when I first saw that it did not have \\"do you hear the people sing\\" But to my surprise it is in there! It is in the Epilouge! It does not have just 2 of the songs but I am fine with that! LOVE IT! Totally worth it and I will be getting DVD when it comes out!!!!!!!!!! If you loved the movie you will love the CD!
1926778537|5.0|All of the environments and characters broken down and here for you to see. All concepts and art thru out the whole game. Weapon designs and story boards. You cant ask for much more, this is a must own book for fans of Joe Mad and the Darksiders franchise.
B00ABXA1HI|5.0|can remote control my server from this, allows me to use my kindle fire in ways i did not think possible, xbmc isa dream to usduse
B008HT4FUW|5.0|This came next day and was great.  The show is wonderful nd I will continue to buy both electronic and hard copy from here.
B00AHSMDQY|3.0|It just didn't do anything for me. It was an okay movie, but i don't think it was great movie.
B00786XVOG|5.0|Always like his music. Recording is very audible.<br />His performance on this CD is superb.<br />Worth the money. Very good.
B00APUYWYA|4.0|This is a good movie. we really liked it. If you like glee you are sure to like Pitch Perfect.
B0098VYCCE|2.0|By midway through the movie, I was rooting for the witch.  Given the choice, Charlize Theron was a much more attractive option than the wooden, emotionless &#34;Snow White&#34; who couldn't persuade me to like her in the least.  Visually, it was an incredible movie.  Unfortunately, Kristen Stewart was frequently out-acted by the scenery and made the experience simply brutal. Too many long shots of her emotionless face could have trimmed the movie to about 45 minutes.
B00AMBH70S|5.0|I really liked this movie. It tied in well with the other Bourne movies. Action packed thrill ride. Jeremy Renner is great.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I have read this book before and it was really great. Then I was watching the preview for the movie getting ready to come this February. I was like I rally need to read this book so I bought it this time (before I got it from the library) and starting reading and thought I have read this and keep reading and couldn't put it down again. Thanks for writing great books for us.
B009GESJH2|3.0|Disappointed again in this Kid Rock CD...I enjoy the first Kid Rock CD's ... pre Rock and Roll Jesus days...I understand as an artist he is &#34;growing&#34; to different music..I just choose not to grow with him and will continue to enjoy the the Cocky, Rebel Soul from his first CD's
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I read this traveling& it was perfect- thanks for the history and the excitement of time travel! I loved it.
B008Y212PI|4.0|The puzzles are pretty good...could be a little more challenging. After doing a few they are all very similar. The graphics are beautiful, but would like to see a more difficult puzzle.
B0052RDHTM|4.0|I did not realize I had read this a few years ago.  I began to read it on my E-book and I am enjoying it for the second time.<br />It is excellent reading.
B003PBB4ME|4.0|I am an amateur photographer. I have used light weight camcorder (Canon Vixia) and it has worked perfectly. I have used it outside in moving car and it hasn't failed me. I would recommend to anyone who is starting to make video using camcorder/ camera. Again this is not a professional rig but you shouldn't ask profession rig at this price.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|Outstanding book! Marcus hit the nail on the head with this book. Thanks to all are men & women downrange!
B005V2EVBQ|4.0|Overall this product is exactly what it said it was but I feel like after having purchased it I would have opted for something different.
B0086213XW|5.0|The movie is a independent romantic drama and it delivers really well. It was entertaining, relatively suspenseful and was well made. Anybody looking for a movie on a Friday or Saturday night at home who is not in the mood for one of the hottest mainstream movies, it's definitely a movie to watch.
B00AH34AUQ|3.0|I really enjoy Green Day's music but I felt these three albums being released so close together took away from how special the music is.
B008DM4OTA|5.0|This game is fun to play, even my grand kids enjoy it.  It's a no brainier game and kills time without stress.
B00A12VW86|3.0|I enjoy Green Day's music and I bought this to have it but I haven't listened to it very much and I feel like the releasing of 3 cds so close together took away from how special the music is.
B009NQKXYK|5.0|Visually outstanding with multiple great performances and imaginative storyline that doesn't wrap everything up with a neat bow, but leaves a few things to the imagination...this will irk some, but I think it's ultimately more exciting. Super strong female character is very reminiscent of Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) from the original Aliens.
B003LSTK8G|4.0|This  book uses a few  compelling  stories  to describe the roots of the financial crisis. The author manage  to breakdown highly complex concepts into ones anyone can understand. I would recommend it to anyone looking to explore  the causes of the crisis.
B009XY97VC|5.0|This release is as good if not better than Two Steps previous releases.  Very enjoyable and worth listening to if you've enjoyed their other music.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I rate this book 5 stars .it's amazing though it left me hanging . Other then thatch loved it. !
B005JE7WKI|5.0|\\"He's cracklin' like a lowg,\\" and too many other soon to be classic one liners to count. This flick is a no-brainer, have fun!
1595827684|5.0|This is one of the best art books I've ever seen.  It's filled with wonderful sketches and design work of different aspects of the Mass Effect series including everything from the characters to vehicles and locations.  This is certainly a must-have for any fan of Mass Effect series but anyone generally interested in art books and sci-fi art will love this.  The only flaw is that the artists are not credited.  I would like to know the names behind the great artworks displayed in the book.  I can't recommend this book enough.  Go get it!
B0076DELIG|5.0|Excellent, suspenseful with Harry Bosch at his best unassuming persona.<br />Hard to put down and read far into the night.
B008QTV3X0|4.0|Well written and acted. Keeps your interest. I've only watched 5 episodes but so far this is an outstanding series
B0076DELIG|4.0|I  liked The Black Box and all Harry Bosch novels, he is a very likable character.<br />I hope this is not the last one.
B00471TLZS|5.0|Unfortunately their mother came to pick them up just as it was getting good. My sister, who rarely watches &#34;old&#34; movies, did enjoy the film.<br /><br />The quality of the stream was great as well.
B009JBZH54|5.0|This came really quickly and was just as a I expected. I love the series so it turned out to be an awesome gift.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Sometimes there are I words to describe the effect a book can have on you. This book really affected me.  To be iced the way Holder loved Sky is incredible....and diving into their story was heart wrenching and yet so beautifully rewarding.
B009MFKO3M|5.0|Tame Impala has a Beatles-esque psychadellic atmospheric but catchy sound. Their songs are crafted skillfully and are beautifully layered and sprawling. This whole album is great, and warrants a listen from start to finish!
B006LSZECO|2.0|It is really dragging on.  I am not even half way through it and have been reading it for three days now.  I am bound & determined to finish it however long it takes.  I wouldn't recommend it at all.
B000A468XY|5.0|i recieved the movie in a timely manner..was able to have it in my classroom by the time i needed it. the movie will be cherished and used for all my children at school for as many years as i am teaching..thank you and will look on amazon the next time i am looking for something
B00735HGQ6|5.0|I couldn't put this book down -an ordinary person accomplishing something extraordinary for another person, and himself as well. He kept on with the journey in spite of adversity, to finally forgive himself for the wrong he had done his friend.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I ended up falling in love with him, head over heels. So I devoured this last book and loved the last bit where his story is portrayed.<br />I won't hesitate to buy THAT book. Please E. L. James, don't leave a girl hanging!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Keeps the story alive and the reader wanting more....can't wait to start the next book....Mockingjay (The Final Book of The Hunger Games)
B007J4T2G8|5.0|He's too handsome, too wealthy and interesting and mysterious. I had to get to know him..... at least on paper.... and all those sex scenarios and the whole cinderella meets beauty and the beast meets the girl next door, a girl can see herself in Anastasia and at least dream for a bit.
B008Y2VTIS|5.0|I live in NJ and enjoyed the &#34;history.&#34; The costumes are fabulous, the cars, The set- buildings etc..I am waiting for the next complete season to purchase.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This book has an interesting plot, who would have thought? I just couldn't put it down! Of course there's also all they sex and Christian Grey...
B009CGYO0K|1.0|I carefully read the reviews before purchasing this book but I guess the reviewers and I have different tastes.  Even my husband who is very different from me thought this book was a terrible waste of time and money.  I did not think it was the least bit funny and we have had dozens of cats over the last 45 years.  We know all the tricks.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game it's so addicting and its just like temple run so if you like that you might like this game
B00650SSDU|4.0|Light hearted dreamy fun little movie. Justin and Mila have interesting chemistry together. It's kind of like a whole season of a sit com in one movie as it puts the characters in a lot of situations but quickly and never really delves in.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|great game hate how u run out of coins fast but its all good. fun not much work and great
B008HT4FUW|5.0|Love this show can't wait for season 3 to start on Sunday,started watching while on vacation in England fell in love
B004LROMX4|4.0|The extras were pretty neat, but most are also available somewhere on the Internet.  Overall quality was typical Blu-Ray (e.g. very good!).
B00005Q4CS|3.0|Everything about this film is perfect. from acting to scenario and also the music of the film; it's masterpiece. but this film is one of the most depressing film i've ever seen so i gave it 3.5 stars
B00A8ECU24|5.0|she loves it!  we will play together until she gets tired of it.  she is 6 and loves my little ponies!
B008469DGY|3.0|This is fun, but frustration limits my play.  The increments for advancement are too far apart.......3000 pts jumps to 10,000 to get to next level.  As a reult I loose interest pretty quickly.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|My first time preordering and it went perfect.. Not only did I get the movie fast but I even got it a few dollars cheaper which made it better... My item was received pretty quickly and packed very well maintaining the quality of the case it has.. Very satisfied
0596007124|5.0|Very good for current software developers and goes well alongside design patterns 2nd edition. It is good to read cover to cover once since each pattern builds on the previous but you can read specific chapters as well.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This app works great for kindle fire and works awesome! It shows everything you need to know. This app is just great
B004JMY312|5.0|What's not to love about a bucktooth Bette Midler, a dumb blonde Sarah Jessica Parker, and a somewhat slow Kathy Najimy? Oh, also, a talking cat that predates Sabrina the Teenage Witch. It's a Halloween classic.
034580404X|5.0|I gave it to my older sister and she said she loved it! Meanwhile, I am enjoying the ebook through Audibles!
B0081SPK0I|4.0|This game reminds me of California Dreamin'<br /><br />Anyone remember that game? I love playing that game in the arcades. It's fun and easy to control.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Randomly read this book. Glad I did. Loved it from start to finish. I loved how it wasn't chapters but letters.
B00AE9UYJ4|4.0|Slenderman Chapter 1 was the first app I've downloaded on my KFHD, and I love its smoothness and gameplay so far. However, the issue remains that the game's orientation constantly \\"flips,\\" making it almost impossible to play. Even when the orientation is locked/unlocked, the game turns \\"upside down\\" on whichever orientation I have it. Anyone else experience this and have a solution? Thank you!
B007HACDLK|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book - it was a page turner and it was fun to read. I was also pleasantly surprised because I hadn't found Flynn's most recent books as fun as the older ones - this reminded me a lot of his earlier books. Great page turner!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys a love story that isn't necessarily perfect! I can't wait to read the next one!
B0076DELIG|4.0|Great writing, but basically just a story of police investigative procedures. Ending a bit of a stretch of the imagination.
B001706I5I|5.0|Great movie with good attention to details with the original. The story is close enough to the original to be interesting to younger viewers but doesnt try to redesign a classic. Very funny.
B00AMBH70S|1.0|The only enjoyable part of this movie was some of the scenery. There was no plot. I would give it zero stars if that was an option. Don't waste your time!!!
B003TSEL7S|5.0|Amazing<br />I loved this amazing  story filled with adventure<br />I hope that everyone who read s this loves the book
B009GIPDQS|4.0|This was quite a good Grisham tale. The twist towards the end of the book was quite unexpected. A good read for those who like to predict the end. It keeps you almost to the finish
B004LOMB2Q|2.0|I will remove today..I've had the free version on my Kindle for about a year now.  It worked fine but now I  have been receiving an update alert almost daily for about a month now.  I will try the Spring Pad someone else suggested.  The permissions are also a concern now..YES, I AM ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE WHO DOES GLOSS OVER THE FINE PRINT..but I will make a new effort to be more careful..had no idea they were so sneaky.
B000JQUMPI|5.0|This is an excellent story of the lives of four sisters and the various paths along which life carries them. Even though it was written so long along the tales and lessons to be learnt are eternal. A good read for people<br />of all ages.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|Was a great gift at a great price.  My daughter is very happy with it.<br /><br />Five more words are required.
B005XLN97M|5.0|It is a product that met the expectations, speed in delivery, good price, just as I asked, durable, works great, I recommend it. I hope to buy. Thank you so much
B00009NQQO|5.0|my daughter was 12 months when I bought this for her and she is now 15 months. and by far it is her favorite toy. the balls fill up with water and she loves squeezing them like a squirt gun. and somehow she never tires of putting them into the basket and then taking them out!
B009EEFTMC|4.0|Very addictive!  Only gave it 4 stars cuz it made me late for work! :-)  The &#34;cube attack mode&#34; is seriously sick!  Really  like this app.
B00A0NOF7G|3.0|I read this book in a couple of hours, such a short quick read.  The<br /> storyline has merrily, but I would not say that the elderly woman have much to do with the storyline.
B004LROUW2|5.0|If you can imagine a tree with beautiful branches springing here and there from its young trunk, if you care to follow each of them and discover that up close they might not make much sense but feel wonderfully fresh and fragrant, yet when you step away, the tree as a whole makes you want to breathe in its magic out of the air and hold it in your lungs for a long time, too sorry to let it go, than perhaps you would care to dip your toes into 1Q84 to experience it for yourself.<br /><br />It's a simple love story about a woman and a man, yet every aspect of it is intricately woven into dreams that sometimes end as reality, sometimes lead somewhere and sometimes expire as soon as the sun goes up, all set amongst meticulous descriptions of Tokyo and its suburbs, taking place between April and December of 1984, holding a whole another novel inside it and touching upon a multitude of characters in an endearing way, not necessarily closing the plot loops, but leaving a genuine feeling that you knew those people, saw them on the street, and perhaps at some time in the future will see them agin. Perhaps not. Add to this magnificent music, complete recipes to simple yet tasteful cooking, fascinating imagery of death, birth and love, sprinkle it with a bit of fantasy and a bit of nonsense, and voila, you've got 1Q84.<br /><br />If I could give it more than 5 stars, I would. Don't read it, please Instead, inhale its pages, savor them, and feel. Best high guaranteed.
B0063IH60K|3.0|Average game...you don't win very often.  As any other game you lose<br />track of time.  Haven't tried with the multi player.
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|I felt like I was reading one of his earlier novels - fast paced, well detailed and up to date with current possibilities
B004MERJOK|5.0|Marcus Lutrell's story of the heroism of his SEAL team in Afganistan is one of the most compelling books I have read about American's in combat.  The commitment and ferocity of these men in training and in battle redefines my view of human selflessness and courage.  His story describes God fearing, selfless people that are worth fighting - and dying for.<br /><br />Marcus also describes the negative affect of the American media and liberals in general on our men in combat.  Although Marcus never says so, sadly many in the US, particularly in the media, are the antithises of his brothers in arms.  They are selfish, shallow, and they aren't worth fighting, much less dying for.<br /><br />Lutrell's book shows the dichotomy in American society in stark contrast - the selfless courageous people who have given our country greatness in contrast to the selfish parasites in our society that tarnish and continue to weaken the country.[[ASIN:B0035YDM4Y Lone Survivor]]
0446580848|4.0|I enjoyed reading the Panther as I have with all of the DeMille books. I do think that this one was way too long to get to the build up but that is the way Mr. DeMile writes. Reading over 400 pages to get to the main part and only to have a few pages for the climax was a bit of a letdown.
1609611543|5.0|Great book! Very informative. Not sure I have the discipline to handle it but still very informative. Worth the read
B0028RXXE8|5.0|If you love this genre then you'll love this HBO series. Everything's here all episodes. The packaging is phenomenal. If there's a complaint it's that there wasn't season 3,4,5.... made!
B0063IH60K|5.0|This has commercial ads, but you can get rid of them easily enough...every hand, there they are...pain in the butt!
B006KX3GXO|5.0|I love this application.  I use it on my tablet and it allows me to be as creative as I want.  Recommend it to everyone that likes to enhance photos!!
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I thought it was a pretty good book, with a good story line. I would like to read more of her books.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is a really cool application, it allows you to schedule different devotional reading sessions or read what and when you choose. I hightly recommend this application to any and all that would like to make the Bible a larger part of their life.
034580404X|5.0|I just got these in the mail on the 2nd. I know I am far behind the whole thing, but I never had money! lol.<br /><br />ANYWAYS, I am in LOVE with these books! I can't put it down! I love Christian Grey!!! :D I want one! I highly recommend these book to any mature adult. This is REALLY not for middle school, maybe even high schoolers. READ IT!
B000FBJAEG|5.0|SPLIT<br />really like the characters, Sean King and Michelle Maxwell. keeps you on the edge of your pages.<br />leaves you wanting more of these 2 crime fighters.<br />really liked it
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I loved it because it has alot of games like darts fish coal miners bats soccor and other stuff as well i rate it 5 stars
B000AYEL6U|5.0|We are enjoying these videos and the story line so very much. It is easy to get lost in the people and there struggles during a difficult time in history.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|A great story of falling anxiously in love. Boosting each other up and staying with your loved one through troubled times. Loving the good and the bad....the past, the present and the future.
B00A0SKFLG|4.0|I think the remake of Total Recall was well done and is a story line that stands on its own two feet.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I love a book I can't put down..and this is definitely one of them.  If you like suspense mixed with a good love story..read it.
B0088XXCZ6|4.0|i listened to this album on NPR first listen several times and didn't get it. i wanted to because i'm a fan of her music. after seeing it as a five dollar download here on amazon last week, i decided to give it another shot. this album proved once again that some of my favorite albums are one's that i don't like much on first listen. it's a very nuanced, acoustic performance and takes many listens to capture the beauty of what fiona apple is getting across. charley drayton's production and drumming on here add to the warmth and anger that lies within each song. i salute fiona apple for having the balls to write and perform the music that she wants to play and could care less what record execs, etc think. nice work, girl!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I love this series. It has a sweet loving side but also a dark, sad side. I would highly recommend this book but be sure to read the first one first!
B003TSEL7S|5.0|WHAT'S A SNAUSAGE? It's been bugging me for a while... is it a spelling error or something I've never heard of and I'm stupid.
B00785P2QC|5.0|I recommend that you get this game it's free fun and a time killer<br />There's actually  movement and building ( like normal life)
B000NTPDSW|5.0|I wanted Bluray copies of the three movies and wasn't sure whether this one would be high quality given the low price. It is exactly what I wanted - restored copies of all three movies. Glad I didn't go for the higher priced versions.
B0009VBTA0|3.0|Much to my disappointment this arrived with a sticker on the front proclaiming it to be the Remixed-Remastered, 24bit, blah, blah, version.  Oh no!  And it is.  Everything is twice as loud (+6dB), all tweaked and peaked for modern tastes and the loudness wars.  I'm really sad.<br /><br />I bought the CD when it come out on the 1980s, but long ago lent it to a friend who never returned it.  All that was left me was an old MP3 rip I had done 13 years ago.  That allowed me to compare original and new.  They are certainly different.  The old version had more dynamic range but was more laid-back and easy on the ears at the same time.  This remix and remaster is squashed and overly bright sounding.  Too bad, as the original was quite beautifully mastered and a pleasure to listen to. This one isn't nearly as good.<br /><br />Guess I'll be searching for a used, original version of this cherished CD.  Why can't we leave good enough alone?
B009E3EY4M|3.0|What *is* it with today's video editors?  Can they not simply leave the concert film intact without injecting their superfluous and *annoying* quick-cut edits?  They had the ultimate setup, a 16 camera shoot coupled with DTS HD-MA sound and they effing blew it!!<br /><br />I watched a \\"Who\\" concert video a while back that used the very same, exteremely annoying video editing practices.  I ended up turning off my monitor and simply enjoyed the music sans video.<br /><br />For once, I'd like to see a concert video done RIGHT:<br /><br />1) Feel free to use multiple cameras.  But you really only need 1 full-stage camera, 1 for each performer, and, perhaps, 1 for crowd shots.<br /><br />2) Make use of the damn \\"Angle\\" feature that EVERY DVD and Bluray player supports.  This means that the default \\"angle\\" is the full-stage shoot.  Then allow the user to isolate on a given band member or the crowd using the \\"angle\\" button on their remote.  Now, everyone is happy.  Except, perhaps, the dingbat editors who insist on *ruining* perfectly good concert footage with their *stupid* editing and post-production practices. GMAFB...<br /><br />3) If ya wanna get fancy - and this would be of interest to folks who attended the event as it was being recorded - devote several cameras to various locations throughout the performance space, thus allowing a viewer to choose an angle that represents \\"their\\" view of the show they attended.<br /><br />Patent this process and call it \\"U R There!!\\" or something similar.<br /><br />That's it!!!!  Plain and simple!!  *Then*, and only then will we get the concert videos we deserve rather than this dreck that is foisted upon us by the suits at the recording companies...<br /><br />-RW-
B0038Q3UKA|5.0|Ten discs of Radu Lupu for under $30.00??  You can't afford not to get this.  I haven't got round to playing absolutely everything in this box, but I've sampled the Beethoven, Brahms, and Schubert, and the playing is superb and the sound quality provided by the Decca engineers is beautiful.  Lupu is one of those players who never makes an ugly sound and is capable of playing with both great power and great delicacy.  The fortes on even the highest notes are never clangy or glassy, and the soft playing is simply exquisite.  I didn't know the Brahms Third Sonata (Op. 5) before getting this box -- it is a great piece, and I can't imagine it being played better than it is here.  The slow movement is right up there with Kovacevich's account of the slow movement of the Schubert B-flat sonata, and the way Lupu communicates a sense of the coherence in the slower portions of the first four movements gives the whole sonata a sense of unity.  In a completely different mood, the scherzo movement of Schubert's 16th Sonata is marvellously witty and precise.  The \\"named\\" Beethoven sonatas in this box are also very fine.  I look forward to listening to the Schumann and to the shorter Brahms pieces.  The only accompanied piece in this boxed set is the Beethoven Third concerto -- from about 1970, and his first concerto recording for Decca.  It's finely done too.<br /><br />This seems to be a time when record companies are putting out \\"integrales.\\"  There's Brendel's, Arrau's, and Serkin's all-Beethoven boxes, for example.  It's almost too much, but at the prices you really can't miss them if you want great music and great pianism.  That's what we get from Lupu here.
0062073559|5.0|Nice size- perfect for my bag<br />Story worth reading again<br />Classic mystery.  Must read for every one who loves mysterys
B009186E3O|5.0|I lover everything about the packaging, the bonus materials and having a new, clean digital version of the earliest Stones. This is so cool. Thanks to the Rolling Stones for delving into the archives and giving us long time fans a terrific product that we have all been wishing for lo these many years!
B007C7UZIG|5.0|The Steam app is very reliable, allows you to browse their catalog of games, see what your friends are up to, check out your account details and so on. The only thing I wish they would add to it is a way to see the individual medals you have on your games.
B0023AO5JC|4.0|Peter Lorre is great!  It is amazing when you remember that the movie is from 1930.  Glad I saw it.
B009PJ1Q82|2.0|Average looking guy that is tenacious and infatuated for 10 years over a druggy pretty boy lawyer. After 1 year, as the movie portrays years of the relationship, would have been the end that most sane and sensible people would have pulled the plug on the druggy pretty boy...then again, if you looked like the blonde (the image for the movie is pure flattery for this actor), well you would hang on to the pretty boy where in the real world he would not have a chance with him. The movie is an utter drone and half-way through you realize the blonde is pathetic.<br /><br />If you are an Indie type person, you suffer through it all...I am not.
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|We can't wait for the new esipodes of Castle each week! Nathan Fillion plays his character to perfection! (It is fun to see him get to tie-in some elements from Firefly on occasion.) Stana Katic as Beckett is an excellent foil for Fillion's Castle. Stana's character has depth and her story line keeps the show moving forward each season.
B00913DPW2|5.0|I loved this game. Great plot, great and creepy setting. I like games that don't hold your hand. Excellent hints that don't give away too much, love collecting puzzle pieces and working it. Some of the in game puzzles were too frustrating but skipping didn't cheapen the mystery. Good support if you need cheats. If you enjoy adventure games this is perfect. Read the diary!!!!
B009CPJHY4|4.0|I've seen this movie twice and liked it both times.  It took us into a world that was completely foreign to the characters, and foreign to the audience as well.  It was eye opening to see a slice of Indian life, if only from a movie perspective.  Judi Dench and Maggie Smith were great as always.  Each character had their own reasons for being there and had a different outlook on their unfamiliar and shocking surroundings.  I really didn't like the character of Mrs. Ainsley, but who would.  She had great facial expressions though.<br /><br />There was just a little bit about their backgrounds in England, but enough to set the stage for their behavior at the \\"Best Exotic Marigold Hotel\\".<br />They talk a lot about how they are old, but they seem very youthful for the most part.<br /><br />I would recommend this movie for those who enjoy watching life in a different land that you may not be familiar with, and those who enjoy character driven films.
B001AGXEAG|5.0|Is a classic movie all kids enjoy. I have many grandchildren and they all enjoy this movie. Just great fun and entertaining.
034580404X|5.0|This isn't a review of the books.  My wife loves them and really wanted them for the holidays.  She got the set because of Amazon.  I don't normally praise internet merchants but they deserve it for this one.<br /><br />As everyone can see, the normal price of the set is around $30.  Costco had it for a little less.  Due to our current conditions, this was going to be left on the wayside this year or perhaps replaced with volume one alone.  That is what I was looking at early in December.<br /><br />Well along came a lightening round deal from Amazon that included FEDEX Express and within a week, I had the whole set ready to wrap up.  I really cannot thank the publisher, distributor and Amazon more.  They did a great job, the books arrived in perfect condition.  She's already through the first one again and heading to the rest.<br /><br />I won't say what I paid, but it was an impossible to turn down deal.  By the way, it showed up on Slick Deals dot net.  It might be worth following them.<br /><br />Many, many thanks to Amazon and the publisher.
B00130UFY2|4.0|Good action. Same as all the other Bourne films. Not great but a solid movie. Interested to see the newest one without Damon.
1594487154|5.0|This book will speak to YOU... no matter who YOU are.<br /><br />Why?<br /><br />We are all in sales. Serious.<br /><br />You have an opportunity to buy a book that will make you view life through a different lens.<br /><br />Isn't that why we read?<br /><br />If your future-self could talk to your current-self after reading this book, they would tell you that it was worth your while/money/time<br /><br />....your future self is pretty smart.<br /><br />(Disclaimer: I received an advanced copy of the book from the author, however, I received no favors, groupons, special treatment or tropical accommodations for this glowing review... it just moved me.)
B0053O89WY|5.0|Between my sons and I, we live in geek-ville.  This is one of TV's best comedies.  Sheldon, we love you!
B002I0J5FG|4.0|The only reason I got this game was purely for Shadow of the Colossus. Now, that wasn't per-say, a mistake, but rather a bad choice. (I will be reviewing both games). You can buy just SotC (I'll be calling it that from now on) on the Playstation Store, but I;m not sure it has trophy support, which this does. The HD looks excellent, and the Colossi look better than ever. What I AM disappointed in is the pop-in textures. I will be riding around on Agro, and the mountains will suddenly become textured. It is a shame since the PS3 has such processing power, and I feel they took no advantage of it. But the rest of the game does play smoothly. The controls are exactly the same and so are the mechanics, so prepare for the same bugs that were in the original (hitting a certain colossus instead of grabbing on). But I enjoyed every minute of it, and still has one of the best stories in my opinion. Now on to ICO. I have mixed feeling about this game. The story is very odd, but interesting, but I find myself un-motivated to play it. Yorda is VERY annoying, constantly having to drag her around and always getting into trouble. It's almost a cheap way of making the game more difficult. The puzzles are challenging, and the graphics are okay. It has bad anti-aliasing. But if you had good memories with this game, you'll love it the second time. So if you're buying this for SotC, check the one on the PS Store first, and if there are no trophies, get this one. It gives you more bang for your buck anyway.
B000TM1CKQ|5.0|I Love the writing, the characters and the story lines.  The actors work off one another so synergistic-ally.  I love it!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Great book, could not put it down, very entertaining and the ending made me cry.  All ready for book 3!
B004AFFZNI|4.0|What more can i say, this device works as advertised.  It is a must have for a Go Pro HD Hero Camera!
B005K17RU0|5.0|I love this product.  Roll over and check it each morning before I get out of bed.  I love the possible multiple location to check the weather around the world.  Works great on my old Kindle Fire
B000FBJAOG|5.0|Loved this book. Very informative, flowed good, never boring. A must read for any zombie lover out there<br />Defiantly pick it!
B009HQ9UHC|2.0|This game is fun, but it has deleted all my progress twice now, so I am done with it. I would be more upset if I had to pay for it. As it is I am just annoyed, and I won't have a problem deleting it from my kindle.
B00ATSBIIG|5.0|Love this game. I have it on my computer and wanted it so when I travel I can play it.  Graphic and colors are great on the Kindle Fire HD.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|First Jack Reacher book in the series, great plot, I never saw it coming. But, technically the events covered in The Enemy occur before this book begins. I did read The Enemy first and it explained a bit about how Reacher embarked on the life he leads in The Killing Floor. I have read all of the Jack Reacher books and have enjoyed them all.
0740748475|5.0|This is my favorite comic and I was really excited when Amazon put this collection on sale for $50 during the holidays. I was really surprised with how heavy this set was. It has to weigh around 20 pounds. It feels really well made. I haven't experienced any binding issues that some others have experienced. My only complaint is that they're almost too big. They're not that practical for casual reading. I might grab the paperback edition and preserve these on my bookshelf because they look quite attractive there.
B0091THDOM|5.0|I love the look and feel of this case. If you want to go &#34;naked&#34; with your iPhone but still protect it. This is the way to go.
0375704027|5.0|Unfortunately I saw the movie and then discovered the book, so a few surprises were ruined for me. But there's still so many details and parts that they left out. Definitely worth a read!
B0052RDHTM|3.0|I enjoyed this book overall, but there was almost too much attention to political details and names.  The Russian Revolution chapters and Prussian dominance segments were frankly boring.  Female characters all \\"got their man\\" and had children.  Fortunately a few managed to go beyond these narrow limitations - perhaps it was the expectation at that time?  So glad I didn't live then!  The descriptions of life in Europe were vivid and compelling, especially life in Wales.  The American perspective was weak.  I rate this book a 3 stars out of 5.
0345802934|5.0|I have yet to open this beautiful boxed set, but it's a great eye catcher on the shelf, and according to other reviews a great read!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|love the big screen and easy buttons. easy to navigate. never freezes. like the easy to read numbers. wish for more functions.
B008JGSM6G|3.0|I enjoyed this game at first, but then it got boring. It does get harder as you progress through the game, which is a perk. I just lost interest in it. My kids didn't like it very much. The harder levels frustrated them. They may be little young for this one.
B00A4YVHXQ|4.0|I have found the game a great challenge enjoyed more on my Kindle than my phone due to piano key size vs finger size. A nice distraction from lifes stresses.
030758836X|5.0|I absolutely loved this book....could not put it down. It's full of twists and turns...you never know what's coming next!
B003O86FMW|4.0|Boring beginning but then gives a really good ending making you really want to read the next book. I'D RECOMMEND IT!
0385363125|5.0|This book was requested by my mother in law who heard that it was a very good book to read
B0034GK7DM|5.0|I have his other cd and just had to get this one, also went to see him in concert and tha was fantastic!!!
B003ODIZL6|5.0|Would definitely recommend to Marcy. Has great information in respelling of words and pronunciation to correctly say words. Great help.
B00A1EOBJQ|5.0|Really love the show and was hoping that they would do a cd, cause the songs on the show are really good
B003JTHXOK|4.0|I loved this book and will definitely read another book by Nicholas Sparks. I think I have found a favorite author.
B002Y0TGOU|5.0|love all the Star Trek movies.  looking forward to the next<br />.Benedict Cummberbatch as Kahn will be a great addition to this casg
B008HT4FUW|1.0|The reason I gave it one star is because it plays jerky on my dvd player.  I think it is my  player.  I have seen it online where other people say it plays jerky on theirs also.  Be careful that it will play on yours.  I bought another dvd player and it wouldn't play on it either.
B0076DELIG|2.0|Connelly, whose books I usually love, is not up to par on this one. Not believable. I suffered my way through it hoping it would get better - it didn't.
B001C4AFOY|5.0|I think this is a really good movie.  It is for people who like English movies and history.  Glad I bought it.
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|Great read for me ans my daughter day would recommend for any moms or middle school children and will read again
B0072GPQNG|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie.  Maybe a little strong for younger children.  It keep my attention and was will acted.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|I flew through this series in no time.  At times some scenes seemed a bit dark; not sure if it was the way it was filmed or if it was a poor reproduction.  Loaned them to a friend who experienced the same thing.  Either way I was thrilled to get it at 60% off during one of Amazon's Deal of the Day offers.
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|pretty good. great graphics. have to be patient if you don't want spend money. starts out fast slows down quick as things get pricey
B006XBSAP2|5.0|...is a big fan of Katy Perry.  Her favorites are: Firework, Last Friday Night, Wide Awake and ET.  I almost didn't get it because the description of the product said it had explicit content, but my daughter isn't a parrot, so I got it anyway.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|I really like to play angry birds, very addicting and challenging to play.  I really like the screen layouts. I would suggest this game to anyone.
B000WQWPJQ|5.0|My son has seen this movie several times but wanted it for a Christmas gift.  It was one of his favorite gifts.
B008AUGEFC|5.0|This was another gift I sent to my brother.  He received it and he likes the book, and that's what matters to me.  What really matters is that he received them before Christmas, as was intended and said by the sender!
B000GFLE1S|4.0|This was a gift for me.  I was both surprise and found the movie interesting.  I had not hear of the movie prior to this.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|It was a great end to the series, although some parts seem to drag on more than it should have.
B009RH973I|5.0|It is exactly what I was hoping for! The hard shell is great in case I drop it, and I love the color.
B007K3JFUQ|5.0|If you loved the first one you will love the second even more.  It is very exciting, keeping you on the edge of your seat.
B008MEM24S|4.0|An incredibly fun app but new levels are too far between.  Just this January 2013 there were new levels available but I am unable to purchase them on Kindle Fire.  Not sure if Amazon glitches or Disney's.
B0034G4P80|4.0|We desided to try this because we really liked Avengers and wanted to see the story that went along with Thor. The computer work in this movie was great.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|This book was a little slow, but interesting. I became more so half way through the book. The end was a complete surprise.
B004QOB8SO|5.0|If you liked season one you will love season two.  We cannot wait for the Third Season.  Definitely met our expectations.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I was told by friends that this book was so terrific. It took me a while to get through it. I found it a little slow and not quite as interesting as I thought.
1932735410|5.0|This book was excellent and helped me pass the PMP exam the first time.  I learned more from reading this book than from my formal PM education and on the job experience.  Read each page carefully.  Try to answer the exercises and quiz questions first without looking ahead to the answers. Do all of the exercises and answer all of the quiz questions.  The book is right - this is the key to sucess.  It is a lot of information.  To succeed on the exam, you must spend the time time to read the book slowly and carefully so that you process the information, think about it, and visualize it being applied to your own experiences or examples.
0307474712|1.0|I couldn't even finish this book. Sooooooooooooo bored from the first page. I finished the first chapter and then decided to just watch the movie, which was equally boring and tragic.
B00024I2Z4|5.0|I was very impressed with the process of ordering, as well as the promptness of receiving my order. Will be ordering in the near future.
B008MM9630|5.0|great game enjoy it I recommend for all ages so far so good. Haven't had any problems with it. thanks
B005LAJ1HW|5.0|liked the quality of the blue ray and liked the television t.v. show that is an HBO show. Liked it
B00A1EOBJQ|3.0|I loved the show from the first episode until the last. What I didn't like was the fact that there was so much more music that they could have put on a CD ( like up to 15-16 songs and they chose only 10) saving some of the best to sell as singles screwing the people who made the show popular. Welcome to America. Home of the God All Mighty Dollar. I am not happy with the purchase but love the show. This year I will use the software I have for my computer and take what I want for FREE!
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|I ratger enjoyed this game even though it is not completely free.  The false advertising pisses me off but the game is worth $3.
B0002F6AH0|5.0|A must for all those who are interested in the history of WWII. The set is in B&W, narrated by Sir Laurence Olivier, and became an instant classic when it aired 30 years ago. All episodes are loaded with interviews and battle footage. The episode on the Holocaust is not for the faint of heart. Some of the extras include interviews with people close to Hitler.
B0012GTZC0|5.0|great story told at a quick pace, believable character development in historical context...i recommend this book to anyone who enjoys historical fiction
B00AB0AXU6|5.0|wonderful movie love the effects in it.... Glad too buy it... Will watch it more and more...... I luv it...
B00A9X9TIW|5.0|If you are looking for a good movie to see, you can't go wrong with this one.  The plot is not to hard to follow, and yet not to simple.  I found this movie to be exorbitant overall, especially in the way that time travel is used.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|I started this game thinking it would be lame but i have found my self actually really liking.  Works well on my Droid RAZR Maxx HD running 4.1.  No complaints and no issues with this game!
B009K0P10K|4.0|Unlike many other shows of today, this one actually keeps me wanting to know what is going to happen next. These writers have done a great job of keeping me wondering what is going to happen next & how will the main character handle things. They have also done a great job of balancing her revenge and keeping her human at the same time.
B009YU62H2|4.0|Even though many years since their last recording,  they still got &#34;IT&#34; !  Absolutely worth the purchase. This CD rocks!
B008ZOHCKE|5.0|Like this ap; it keeps important contact numbers sorted and easily available for me-like personal phone numbers and work numbers in their own notebooks. As I carry my Kindle constantly, I always have them with me. So handy
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|Really nice app loads of fun to play i got it free for it being the free app of the day but i would have paid full price for it sometimes i get lost but then will find cool to things and side storys to the main one i would give this app a 9/10 its really god try it out!
B00A9C3RB8|3.0|Perfect for a night with a bowl of popcorn, a glass of wine, and a cat on my lap. It's hokey, but mildly enjoyable.
B00AFCEIB0|2.0|Thought this was a Google app for Google search ... it's some kind of knock-off app not made by Google.  Not worth using.
B000SEIK2S|4.0|It was fun to read. Not a deep read, but one that keeps you going. I would recommend it has a good way to avoid TV.
B008M721MS|5.0|Most excellent on the Kindle Fire HD ... won't work on first gen though cuz it doesn't have a mic or a camera.
B0076DELIG|4.0|I enjoyed the plot in The Black Box and how it was brought out then solved. It was an easy and delightful read.
B00AMBLXP8|5.0|The TV cartoon that is....not what you want your hubby to be like....then you should like this movie.  If you have ever said \\"that would never happen\\" during a movie that you already knew was going to be like this one...a talking bear....then save your time. Go watch a lifetime movie.  TED ROCKS!
B000NQRE9Q|2.0|I am sorry to report that these really nice Blue Ray disks do not work with my Surround Sound system. There are six different languages on these disks and five out of six work with my system.<br />The only language track that does not pump out high-quality cricket chirps and every other sound is (you guessed it) English.<br />If you are Surround Sound savvy and can tell me what is wrong here please let me know. Otherwise I'll be watching the English language track through tinny sounding flat-screen speakers.<br />Very disappointed here...
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Either I'm a whiz at this game or it's pretty easy.  Still it's fun for a few minutes of diversion.
0307730697|5.0|I have read several books about Navy Seals and their exploits. Eric Blehm tells the story of Adam Brown from a more personal perspective than some of the other books. It is a testimony to Adam Brown and his family to want all of the good, the bad and the ugly of Adam's life revealed. This is not the story of a perfect Christian boy grown into a hero. It is a story of a man and his family overcoming what could have been tragic circumstances in his life.<br />  Adam earned his fearless reputation as a small boy daredevil. That reputation followed him through high school. He took a wrong turn after high school by getting involved with drugs and progressing to the hardest forms of crack cocaine. His family stuck by him and tried every intervention possible to no avail. Adam's father had him arrested and put into jail. After a jailhouse conversion to Christ, Adam went into a Christian rehabilitation program. He made it through but was not completely healed of his addiction. He met his future wife Kelley two months after graduating from rehab. Kelley stuck with him as he had several relapses. Finally, Adam escaped from his familiar drug hangouts and went to a friend in Texas. He convinced Kelley to marry him. The father of a childhood friend helped him get into the Navy Seal program in spite of his past record.<br />  Adam and Kelley endured many trials as Adam successfully completed his SEAL training and further exploits in the SEAL program. Adam overcame a debilitating eye injury in one accident and a hand injury in another. Adam's story is one of unbelievable bravery and perseverance in the line of duty. His is also the story of a devoted husband and father at home and a compassionate man in the field. Adam had his family at home collect shoes to give to Afghan children in the winter. Adam ultimately died a hero's death in Afghanistan. He was received back with a hero's welcome in his beloved state of Arkansas. Adam's family, friends, teammates and our nation were impacted positively by his actions in life and by the telling of his story after his death. Another sad fact is that many of the brave men interviewed for this book were later killed in action as well.<br />  This story is a compelling and inspiring account of bravery and a great testament to Adam's favorite scripture \\"I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me\\" (Phil 4:13, NKJV).<br />  Although the language is much less graphic than in \\"Lone Survivor\\" there is some profanity. The few occurrences of these could have been omitted without adversely affecting the quality of the story. I realize the culture of the military and the nature of high school kids, but this could have been left out.<br />  I received this book from Waterbrook Multnomah publishing in exchange for this review. This is my honest opinion of the book.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|My new favorite movie--lots of character growth, beautiful scenery, particularly great movie for retired people, deals well with some of the problems we face.
B005H29GSI|4.0|This is the exact game that my grandson wanted.  Everything seems to work ok and he loves playing it  with his brothers and sister.
B009MCRHH6|4.0|I've played and beat World of Goo on a PC. The entire concept is done near flawlessly. The different goo balls, the different levels, the music, the layout is all done very well.<br /><br />The issue I'm having on my android phone though is that once you get to the 3rd world and beyond, it gets tricky maneuvering the goo balls around on the phone without grabbing the wrong one or placing it somewhere on accident. You get a few chances to go back a move on each level (which helps) but it is still frustrating.<br />There are some levels that have multiple types of goo balls that you need to place strategically in different places. Trying to get that specific ball and place it in a specific place with the other 50 goo balls moving around is just much easier on a PC than phone.<br /><br />It's still a great game and definitely worth a try. If you like the game but find it a little hard to play on a smaller device, it's also worth a shot by playing on a PC.
B001PPLIEG|3.0|Its was ok, they tried to make a sequel to Casino Royale which has never been done before in the 007 franchise. Skyfall turned out to be better.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Reading this book made me feel closer to my 3 dogs. I started to talk more and listen more to them, they seem happier.
B001KX50BK|5.0|one of my favorite movies.  Arrived quickly.  Very high quality - HD.  Very reasonable cost.  I have enjoyed this movie very much.
B0049P1ZZQ|5.0|this was an excellent buy. i received it in time for Christmas and packing and DVD was in excellent order
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I won't rewrite what is already here.... But I love Colleen Hoovers books.  I read this because of the great reviews not even paying attention to the author, title, content!  I read it in one sitting, staying up most of the night and I was pleasantly surprised at the end to see I had read her other two books at the same neck breaking pace!  Then I thought, no wonder I loved it!!!
B002M5E2DW|5.0|This is a great book. It is an easy read and is full of wonderful perspectives on the meaning of life .
B0001CCXY8|5.0|the album irrive fast and its in perfect conditions its like new (and its second hand) all its ok.<br />Thanks
B009VLX8FS|5.0|I enjoy listening to this album.  Stay Stay Stay is my new favorite.  I also love &#34;I almost do&#34; and &#34;All too well&#34;.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|All in all its fun to play. Lots of games to choose but you have to unlock them using points you've won from previous games and if you run out of points, you have to PAY to buy more. I haven't had that problem yet though :)
B0001L3LUE|5.0|Loved this documentary. Very well directed. Captivates the audience and it allows you to be see WAR from a different perspective.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book made my heart pound, made me cry, made my angry, and made me elated. Safe Haven So wonderfully written I would curl up with this book for hours and my mind would go crazy with all of the wonderful details. Recommend this book to anyone!! My new favorite book.
B005WYFLNU|5.0|Love this product. Girls take turns placing stickers on different dolls. Best part is they are reusable so can be used over and over.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I would defiantly recommend this book to the romantics by heart. It's one of the best books I've ever read. Definitely a two thumbs up.
0061173258|5.0|My sons first book! It was amazing. Still with us 7 years later. It is now my daughters book before bedtime.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I love it for page 1 and hated it at the end, because it was over:(. All and all i recommend this series.
