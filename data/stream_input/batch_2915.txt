B000QCS8TW|5.0|Fast reading and moving story, full of love, hatefulness, friendships and betrayls, war and piece. Amazing story!!<br /><br />Cant wait to read book two.
B001NLKT60|5.0|This book was really enjoyable experience. I would totally give a six star if possible. My thirteen year old sister loved it too.
B00455IVHU|4.0|Saw this at least two times and enjoyed it just as much the second time.  Barbra and Lauren Bacall wonderful as well as Bridges.
B008VO3PA4|5.0|This was very amusing good quick read when you want to kill a little time. I will be recommending it.
B002SF9YNO|5.0|One of the best movies to come out of Japan, beautiful music, beautiful story and ground breaking for the class changes that are taking place in Japan, (removing class distinctions) a MUST see!  And I should know because I've lived in the area where this was filmed for many years....excellent acting!
B00DHKKN6Q|5.0|This is a great game! I enjoy playing it very much. The characters are bright and cute. Game play is fair and the price is right.
B0002TJGQS|5.0|I had a watch that needed this size battery.  I went to the local CVS to find the size and they were $17.49.  When I saw them on ebay for less then $2.00 I gave it a try but was expecting some cheap, low quality item.  When they arrived I was pleasantly surprised.....batteries are exactly the same as the ones sold for wayyy more money.  Awesome value and I will definitely buy from seller and amazon again whenever I am in need of any batteries.
B005H0IW6W|2.0|It's not Michaels best work. Really didnt like it much. Although I really like his music! Not recommending it for you Christmas.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book has taken my kids 13 & 14 yrs old from hating books to carrying one around with them EVERYWHERE they go! At first it was ' The Hunger Games' series (which they each read twice), onto many other genres. The Hunger Games introduced them to characters that they could relate to, it made them cry with compassion, scream out loud, pray for blessings, smile & laugh. It made them want to look into politics and our government. Reading just the first book took our family comfortably into conversations that I am not sure we could have had otherwise! My son went to bed holding this book and woke up early to try and get a couple pages in before school. If I threatened to take it away from my daughter, she would do ANY chore she was asked.<br />If you are looking for a book that will keep you up all night, this is the one!!!!
B00005YW4H|5.0|Very beautiful I love to her her jazzy voice. This is her best CD ever! Good price and great music. Highly recommend it and the seller.
B008FPOIT6|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. I liked the sense of humor of the main character and enjoyed the juxtapostiion of old technology with new.
B00070Q7VO|5.0|Michael is a wonderful singer. With a style similar to Frank Sinatra, but better. Such a clear voice. This CD is full of great songs. I would defiantly recommend it.
B0098XY5VK|3.0|cons : you can only play one full level then you have 2 by the rest<br />-Lags a lil<br />Pros: kinda fun
B007AL48UK|5.0|This game seems to be very well laid out and is quite enjoyable. I am having lots of fun...great game for the price. I would highly recommend this game.
B002N5N4M6|3.0|Not sure what to say. Bought several but I just don't find them funny. Everyone raves about them though. So don't go by me. Great and fast service!
B00785P2QC|4.0|After playing the game for a couple days, it seems to be alright. All the Facebook posting is a bit annoying, but you can go on Facebook and delete stirring afterwards.
B000W91RUG|3.0|Not sure what all the fuss is about? Really not very good. But people everywhere seem to love them. So I guess it's me. Very good service from seller.
B00992CF6W|5.0|My boys who are 4 and 6 just love this game. It is very easy to learn and it keeps them thinking :.)
B0007GAEGC|3.0|This is not one of their best CDs although I really like them. I would pick another one of their CDs if I were you.
B00EP2PXCY|5.0|Great Album.  Ariana really shows her range and versatility. Particularly on songs like Almost is never enough and Tatooed Heart. All around, this is a great album.
B006BGZJJ4|4.0|The cable is what it was supposed to be.  It arrived on time and in perfect condition for use with my computer.
B00B52FDXQ|4.0|I just received this today and to be honest I have not seen this conclusion to this series.  I have seen some episodes, but made the choice to stop watching until it was released on DVD, that's how good it was for me.<br /><br />I do collect DVD's and collections as well, so I had to get this as soon as it was available.<br /><br />My package was received today and in good order.
B00BRH2MN8|5.0|I could listen to these five songs over and over again. This girl is great and so unusual.  Can't wait until her full album comes out
B0064MPXFA|4.0|One of the things that's great about this is it is about HER--her struggles and conflicts and the effects of his tornado ripping through their lives.
1401923119|2.0|It's more about the authors personal learning journey than anything substantial to really sink your teeth into. As far as new and meaningful inspiration ,I suggest looking elsewhere.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|Never miss a bid with this app.  eBay-to-go allows you to stay on top of bidding even when you are not at your PC.
B00A6RCSKC|4.0|Very addicting and challenging game that I highly recommend.  Plenty of replay value that I could not get enough of.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|To read the historic record through the eyes of Reza Aslan helps our understanding of the context that lead to the formation of the Christian faith. For me the the political environment helps to understand Jesus' message.  Rena's<br />Jewish understanding helps me understand the period where the Christian movement was within the Jewish tradition and it was only 50 to 100 years the two faiths tried to differentiate the difference between them. This is a must read in Christian congregations' book clubs.
B006YTTVHO|3.0|The book has really good tips that may seem like common sense, but are helpful reminders to be more self-aware of your actions.<br /><br />Half the book is too common sense, but the other half makes it worth the read especially since the entire book is pretty short!
0385349947|5.0|I would highly recommend this book because it is very different from other books on this topic because of one thing: She does not only list problems professional women do have but actually offers recommendations how you could try to solve them!
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Can't stop watching the entire season once I start watching the first episode.<br />Even though the story line is on the lines of white color and other such series, this one is still fantastic due to the gripping storyline and the amazing performances.
B00E8KLWB4|3.0|A lot like snark busters, but I wish you didn't have to play the same pictures over and over<br />. But all in all a fun game
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I loved this book!! SOOO glad I bought it. I couldn't read it fast enough, but at the same time I didn't want it to end. Tear jerker for sure! I can not wait for the movie! Buy the book you wont regret it! SUCH a good one!
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Just like his other books, this was a great read. You can really get into the characters' lives, and you feel their feelings. I want more of his book!!!
B0040I09RM|5.0|This is a wild new series. Definitely for adults. I loved the characters. I stayed on the edge of my seat wondering what mischief could this club get into next. I had never heard of the main character Charlie Hannum. After hearing he was going to play Christian Grey in Fifty Shades of Grey, I decided to check this series out. In 3 days I watched all 5 seasons. Each one made me want to go to the next until I gotten through them all.<br />I enjoyed the characters coming into there parts and watching them mature over the series. Charlie's Mom is a piece of work. I am looking forward to season 6.
B008U3NU38|5.0|Thank you, Mick, Paul, and Topper - this box set is high quality from the most important elements of remaster sound quality to the guilty pleasures of the packaging. I was 17 the first and only time I saw the Clash live at the Aragon Ballroom in Chicago, 1982 I think. Sadly, Topper had already been sacked. Still, what a show. Many years later, I'm still the same fan wanting more, even though I'm a middle aged geezer. But this set is a nice bit of candy for the Clash fan.<br /><br />The audio quality, especially for 1st two albums, is superb, a definite step up. I can't wait to keep exploring the set, but I sense some real effort went into this package. Highly recommended!<br /><br />WE MISS YOU JOE!  Your mates did this right.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book was so beautifully written. It made me laugh hard and cry deeply. It was so powerful and deeply moving and thought out. I highly recommend it. I finished it days ago and it has stayed with me.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|This game has held my attention more than most games on the kindle. It's fun,addicting, and has a great feel. The oh bad thing I think about it is the 'friend' thing.
B00003CXCW|5.0|The acting was great. William Holden and Gloria Swanson.<br /><br />The story was good. This is a classic. I never get tired of watching it.
B0055D3EFU|5.0|It was convenient to be able to watch it anywhere. Which is the convenience on this part. I would buy more for this purpose.
B002ZG993Q|5.0|George Clooney fantasic as always. I just love looking at him!!!!<br /><br />This movie was filmed in Italy and the scenery was beautiful.<br /><br />The story was very interesting. I will watch this again and again.I
B0013K1ALE|5.0|It was excellent.  Especially the theatrics. Jimmy Page on the guitar was awesome.  Page, Plant, Bonham & Jones blend in together for some great rock& roll.
B00821OX98|4.0|Good plot, action and story line would love yo see more the revelation that the skiddeds were once human was a fascinating transformation watch out for your children ......
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|I read the book and was impressed with the way the movie played out in relation to the author's written story. Can't wait for the next movie!
B00CLD65X0|5.0|Downton is such a great show to get lost in! Love the English traditions and Maggie Smith is fantastic! Bravo
B00EY8BRGU|1.0|This movie went downhill from the beginning. There really was not as much suspense as portrayed in the trailor. Don't want to give anything away...just ultimately, not a good plot, and very anticlimactic.
B000OCXFCO|4.0|It's the best megadeth album since countdown, after countless crappy albums they finally released something with good guitar riffs and not something for the radio.
B00E8B1P9M|1.0|Worst movie ever......I want 90 minutes of my life back. How did they get away with making a second GI Joe.
B000002V0Q|4.0|it's a good album but in my opinion it's overrated. Rust In Peace was good I could listen to it countless times but this doesn't leave me wanting more after listening to it. But it's metal unlike youthanasia.
0385721234|5.0|no he leido este libro todavia pero es muy bonito y tengo ganas de aprender algo sobre el asunto. wowee
B005LRWRZ8|3.0|this album has 6 good songs: Sudden Death, Public Enemy No. 1, Never Dead, Fast Lane, Wrecker, and 13. everything else is youthanasia-ish which I can't stand. A degrade from Endgame in my opinion. still worth buying for the six good songs.
B002M9WW30|4.0|If you are looking at this you know this is a classic series of movies. I am here to attempt to review the quality if the blu-ray transfer for each movie. I want a potential buyer to know what they are getting when it comes to a the video quality presented in this set<br /><br />Case:<br /><br />The design here is compact and neat. There is an oversized blu ray keep case that holds all 7 discs. The discs are in back to back holders.<br /><br />Image Quality<br /><br />Rocky :<br />This is definitely the best quality we have ever gotten. There is a question as to weather or not this is the best possible transfer we could get, but it is very difficult to judge something on conjecture. Anyway, the aspect ratio is 1.85:1 with a 1080p/mpeg2 transfer. This is the same remastering as the 2006 blu ray and we may not get a better version for a long time.<br /><br />While watching the movie it looks very good, but there is significant noise on the screen at pints which can be distracting. This definitely comes from the movie being an older print but it is far less noticing e when looking the outdoor scenes.<br /><br />Rocky II<br /><br /> The transfer here is AVC-encode. The image is far nicer than you have ever gotten before but thee is still some noise from the original content. I do not know why but the final fight scene seems to pop more than the rest of the movie. The scenes becomes a tad sharper somehow.<br /><br />Rocky III<br /><br />This transfer is beautiful. It doesn't blow the first two away but it is definitely a nicer clearer print. This movie does showcase what Blu Ray can do for you. There is so much detail in faces and on skin that it really helps you want to watch this version. Dark scenes have some shadowing issues but this is still a very nice transfer.<br /><br />Rocky IV<br /><br />Again we have a 1080p/AVC encode and boy does it look special. This movie in blu-ray is a treat. Faces look incredible, everything shines and colors look absolutely fantastic. This asks you to take notice. There is very little static from the source through the movie but the contrast is incredible. The black areas are as black as they are going to get. This movie showcases what you are missing out by just watching the movie on DVD.<br /><br />Rocky V<br /><br />I removed a star in my review because they included this film. Kidding! Five is not the most popular Rocky movie out there, though to tell you the truth I don't hate it. Alright and now I'm back. AVC-encoded yet again but somehow we have a step back in quality.<br /><br />The picture is a bit darker than previous movies but there is a lot less noise present.<br /><br />Rocky Balboa<br /><br />Thus is the same transfer as the 2007 film blu ray release. This is the best of all of the discs but I guess that is to be expected when a few decades pass. Finally a Rocky movie with no noise and no artifacts.<br /><br />Special features<br /><br />Just two extras I found to be notable that increased my enjoyment of this product<br /><br />Feeling strong now game. This is Very similar to<br />DVD scene-it and it is actually fun to mess around with<br /><br />In The Ring- making of documentary. This is a fantastic three part making of that is 75 minutes long. Part one is all about what it was like to film the movie in 28 days while parts 2 and 3 focus on the loves and motivations of the actors other than Sylvester Stalone.<br /><br />So finally if you like these movies and you are interested I hope you can use this as a quite for you to judge if you want to see this movie. There are many conflicting reports relating to weather or not the quality on these blu-rays are what you are expecting so I hope I have been able to clear things up a bit to allow you to make your own decision.<br /><br />---------------------<br />Note:<br />It has been brought to my attention that'll review is now under the heading of a slightly different product that may have higher quality.<br />This post came from somebody in the comments if you would like to check it out.<br /><br />(((Message from a helpful amazon commenter)))<br />\\"Note his review is about the (undisputed collection.)And now there is a new better one coming alone or repackaged with the other movies.

B004J4WLB4|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this debut novel.  The story kept me turning the pages late into the night.  I'll never look at flowers the same way again!
B001KL0WJW|4.0|Acting and premise is on the campy side but it never takes itself too seriously.  Enjoyable and entertaining because it is different.
0061689246|5.0|I love the movie and I love the book even more. Not your average fairy tale.<br />Neil Gaiman is my new favorite author.
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|I love this guy i'm glad i got it i overclocked it to 4.5g easy with a h100i by corsair to keep it cool. recently i bumped it down to 4.2 just to go easier on it and it didn't really improve performance that much at 4.5 compared to 4.2 haven't had a problem with it though says at good temps 45c is about as hot as it goes which is completely fine for over clocking it roughly 1 ghz
B00F57VFXO|5.0|A fascinating `What if' for  January 1945  - What if Hitler was about to be assassinated by Nazis and replaced with a more capable leader like Erwin Rommel. Would that prolong the war and give rise to a `Fourth Reich'? Would the Allies, if they got wind of such a scheme, try to foil it? The answer to these question in `Operation Parsifal' is a resounding `yes.' 17F is sent on a mission to maintain the progress of the war by saving Hitler's life. It's a clever irony that makes for a taut, tense tale. The action sequences and one-liners and sex are all here for the die hard Bond fans. But this smart, very well written book should appeal to anyone because it's so well done. Highly recommended.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|Excellent graphics and gameplay!  My 9 yr old can stay entertained for hours and hours.  I would recommend to anyone.
B00A3NQNUU|3.0|I have been playing this game, then BOOM, my parent's money is drained out by this game. Is this a virus?
B005PK56TA|5.0|I absolutely love this show. Its interesting and different and keeps you on your toes. Perfect actors/actresses for the roles.
6304698623|5.0|My daughter lived it. It was a movie I enjoyed when i was her age, and was happy she also enjoyed  it.
B00B5HQLMI|1.0|Bad download<br /><br />How about making it easy to fix the problem?<br /><br />I am very very disappointed...how about some help?  I paid, where is my video?
B00A93ENX8|5.0|I am so happy I was able to get this before it went out of stock. I would like to be able to find any others, besides Hemispheres, so complete my collection.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|The best game of all time and its free!!<br />You will love it as soon as you try it !!
B007REV4YI|5.0|I could not wait for this movie to come out on Blu-ray. This is a great movie. I look forward to the next Bond movie.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|this file explorer will help you install .apk you can download from external sources like apktop or directly from the developer, hence installing apps that are not available in the Kindle app Store
B005O7Q6FM|5.0|This series unlike many, seems to keep coming at you with humor, intrigue, horror and romance.  The &#34;dance&#34; between Castle and Beckett is outstanding.  The actors fit their roles well and the show flows, giving us insight into the characters depth.
B00DJWV11I|5.0|I loved reading a book from a males pov. This was funny and wonderfully written. The story took you in several directions but ended in the same story. Great ending, great characters.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|I like the game for the colors and ease of use. As a personal nanny to two children I can say that this game has gotten the two children interested in learning about different species of fish. It also sparked an interest for a field trip to the local aquarium to learn more.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Quality was excellent on my Kindle Fire HD. I love the series and was glad to be able to catch up on the show.
B00BVYLBP2|5.0|Completely caught off guard about this show. I started watching it based on all the reviews and I have to say I was not disappointed at all.<br />Different, engrossing and overall just enough &#34;weird&#34; to keep my engrossed. Cant wait to see what the next season brings.
140006922X|5.0|Coupled with Candida Moss's book &#34;Myth of persecution&#34; this book I think is a must read for anyone seeking an accurate look at the historical aspects of western religon.
B0089EHWQE|4.0|Enjoyed this book very much. I thought the chapters from the different characters perspectives were a nice touch. I highly recommend this book! Quick and satisfying read!
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|A lot of backtracking takes place, but with the story it makes more sense. Good hidden-object, couple good puzzles, but nothing terribly challenging. Really neat way to keep track of info through not just a journal, but also an evidence wall. Interesting, and I looked forward to the sequel.
B00A0SMTXS|4.0|Great take on the original.  Updated effects make this a great action movie.  Not a cheesy remake but an exciting, sophisticated movie.
034580404X|5.0|I'm in love with the book and I'm so happy it came in faster than I had hoped and the book condition was new and it arrived to me new and in great condition.
B004EC5IV6|5.0|Already a fan of Evangelion, I am glad to have ordered this movie to add it to my collection.<br />I received  the movie in perfect condition.
B00AEFY552|5.0|I love it when it first came out, and it's even better in blue ray. Great story, too bad it's a pure fiction.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This app is very addicting; however, theres not enough floors. Can't wait for more floors to open up so I can continue the game. If your looking to get some work done, don't download this app.
B00EAI9CSY|5.0|A modern gothic fantasy with an insight into human nature through the exploration of that which is inhuman. Beautiful cinematography and passionate performances. People who liked Interview with a Vampire will provably like this movie. Though Byzantium moves with a much smaller scope and the pacing is significantly slower. A thinking man's Vampire Movie.
B005IQZB14|5.0|G R E A T  adventure, recent true story, of a young woman's (27) quest to walk the PCT (Pacific Coast Trail), forget her family tragedies and ultimately find her true self.  A real page turner - could not put it down!!
B00DH1G7DS|5.0|Really enjoy this game a lot and have improved my speed  on each screen. Hoping to get to the more difficult soon.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I intended to pace myself, watch one episode per week. Ha. I inhaled the entire season in a week and am now desperate for season 4.
B008W8X5N6|5.0|The first movie monster not created by a author. The film Max Steiner is also classic, as is Willis O Brien's effects and Ruth Ro!se's screenplay
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Wish it was louder.  It is too low and I may not hear it.  However the time is right there in bold.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|What an awesome book! A great read with a fascinating story. Can't wait to see what's next for the inhabitants of this post apoplectic world.

B00CTSDDVO|5.0|Seen this originally in IMAX 3-D. As you'll never get the quality and excitement of IMAX at home. It's still a fun watch. The movie was masterfully put together. It entangles something for all watching. Star Trek fans of the old will get little nuggets to realize its following the original. Action packed with nice story line for fans of new. And some things may seem silly and that's for your younger audience. Well directed, acted and told in a movie that will keep the Star Trek brand alive for another generation.
B00CL0J99K|1.0|I remember when IM3 came out, it looked pretty weak in the trailer. But one day I saw that free ticket offer on red baron frozen pizzas and I was hooked. It was on sale for $2.50@  I bought 4, $10.83 total, mostly the pizza bread variety, and 1 supreme pizza, and I printed a ticket from the ironman/redbaron pizza website.<br />I would have gotten my money back had I paid for the movie. Pretty much a total disappointment. no surprises or guest stars and the villain was really the melter?<br />The movie was an over CGId broken sentence speaking mean spirited travesty.<br />I was so completely underwhelmed by the super skitty post end credit scene that I stumbled into the new star trek into darkness show, which I never planned on watching, and ended up rather enjoying it. Granted star trek was a sad rehash of the older movies, yet it towered over the feeble IM3. And seeing ST free in theaters saved me $1.35 in rental fees.<br /><br />So check for those free ticket deals, and remember to switch theaters once your in for a double or triple feature.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Enjoyed the challenge. Look forward to future floors from which to escape. This is a good challenge for the brain and the powers of deduction. Great for an analytical person.
B003GK212G|4.0|Camel club books are a joy to read.  Multi level plus that merge seamlessly. I now want to read the next one!!
B00F35B8F8|5.0|This new series gets better by each movie. Although, without spoiling it, I think Star Trek the original tv series had better looking Klingons, sometimes a small tweak here and there is better than a major change,  as if to leave a Star Trek follower thinking, if they hadn't mentioned they were Klingons in the movie, we wouldn't have been able to recognize who it was.
B009NY43NY|5.0|I liked it. I've become so involved in this series and it never disappoints. I'm sad it has ended. :-(
B002RI9M2U|5.0|I couldn't put it down. Read it all in 2 sittings. Very captivating and gripping. Loved it! Definitely recommend it
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|Broadchurch has me on the edge of my seat every week. The acting is fantastic, the suspense is high, and the weekly cliffhangers are driving me crazy! I recommend this show to all of my friends.
B000W91RUG|5.0|This is a really funny show.  I did not start watching it when it first came out so I had to catch up.
B00CL0J99K|1.0|For years Iron Man has been my favorite solo superhero. I've read the old comics, and I watched the animated series when I was little. I loved everything, the character, the villains, the concept, everything. Fast forward a few years to the first movie. It remains one of my favorite movies. So when I heard about the second movie, I got excited. Like many fans, I was disappointed to say the least. Everything went wrong. So now, with as few spoilers as possible, I'm going to tell you why the third is just as bad, if not worse.<br />I started hearing about the third one just like everyone else. When I saw the previews, I thought they would redeem themselves.  All the signs pointed to it. And since it came out on my birthday, my girlfriend decided to take me out to it(quick note, she's an even bigger Iron Man/RDJ fan than me). It was a waste of money. I'm not expecting some artsy thing, it's an action movie. But this didn't even have a solid premise. The Mandarin has always been my favorite villain, but he DOESN'T EVEN HAVE POWERS. THEY GOT RID OF HIS MAGIC RINGS. And if you do go through the ordeal of watching it, you'll see that isn't the only thing they mess up about one of Marvel's finest villains.<br />Also though, there is so many plot gimmicks. I think the writers were on a time crunch and just had to go with whatever stupid crap they could think of to keep the story in motion. Nothing in it seemed genuine. They wanted to do too much with it.<br />I am calling this the death of Iron Man in his own movie franchise.
B00CWV9FQA|4.0|My son really enjoyed the movie. Having played the video game, he knew the back story so was able to follow. Some adult level content that would go over a child's head but no different from regular TV.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|this a grate and cute movies for those who are very proud of their scotish irish roots, the music was composed by a leading gailic singer, i saw it on the plane on my way to japan, its cute movie, and has alot of heritage in it, and a beautyful story line, about family, loyalty and courage, most def a grate  movie to watch the fam!!!
B002DQDV6Y|5.0|My 7 year old loves all these movies. We have been reading the books to him in turn with the movies. It has been fun to see my child comprehend what he has been hearing to what he is seeing.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|i loved it!  it was visually pleasing, great story line, superb actors, so intriguing.  it didn't not disappoint and left me wanting more!

0316044695|5.0|Just what my husband wanted, I would recommend not to get the mass production version because it is so small.
159413605X|5.0|I loved this book so very much. It was intriguing and  I definitely did not want to put it down. I just love it when I have a book that makes me want to keep reading to find out what happens next. It has ben awhile since that has happened and that caused me to not want to read again, thankfully this book came recommended to me by a friend or I wouldn't have read it. Great Read, Ms. Gillian Flynn. Is there a sequel???
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Great story with some pleasant surprises and interesting perspectives. Well written. Inspiring. Thought provoking. Would definately recommend to anyone of any age
B0001V6ZJ8|5.0|Henri de Toulouse Lautrec was a great painter and somewhat a philospher. It was a fictions story base on some true fact. Hollywood made a great picture of his life
B00915G6SU|5.0|I love this show.  Even got my daughter hooked on it.  I buy the newest season every Christmas for her.  I agree that this year the show hasn't got it's usual zing.  You really need Emily Prentiss back.  Also need to remove Tripplehorn.  She is too much like a robot  -- no emotion.  I don't know why the writers made her such a dud. The other thing I didn't like was how they killed off Reid's girlfriend.  Why isn't he allowed to have a romantic life?  I will still watch the show, but hope to see some improvements next year.
B009RH9J7W|5.0|very sturdy and looks good  easy to handle and love the rotation part of it . i received it within 2 days
B008MYZ6SW|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie especially the ending scene. Jennifer Connelly and Donald Pleasence did a great job acting too
B0060CX8F6|5.0|I saw this movie with my child when it was first released in the theatres and LOVED it.  I was so excited to download it to my Kindle.  This is so relaxing to watch during my busy day at work or on a plane.  Will definitely be a classic.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|this is an awesome game because i am a jurrasic park is awesome because i am a nerd with it.
B002WV5A9G|5.0|Excellent story, acting and special effects.  If you are a Star Trek Trekkie this is just another good movie in the series.
B00063F8B2|5.0|Christmas is many things to many people.  This wonderful album goes a long way towards helping you to relive the wonderful sense of Christmas that the movie inspires.  Some of the songs are traditional Christmas favorites while others are entirely original.  Several of the original pieces are raucous, joyful, Christmas romps while some are reverently thought and mood provoking.  All of the songs on this album help to capture at least one element of the Christmas experience.<br /><br />All of the music in this CD was highlighted in the movie with the original pieces dominating their time on the screen.  The traditional songs generally appeared only briefly as background music.  All in all, it works very well as a compilation effort.  Pour some hot chocolate into a thermos and listen to this while you take the kids on a snowy drive to take in Christmas lights and sights...... especially at night when..... as we all know; Christmas magic is at its height.  Merry Christmas!
B001B2CPH2|5.0|The love scenes are so real and full of emotion. Plus I love everything about Patrick Swayze.<br />Whoopie Goldburg is amazing! Funny and tender.
B009RX85N0|5.0|Loved the season and my family is waiting for season three to begin!  Great script and my 11 year old boy even likes it!  He was reluctant at first but admitted its pretty cool.  (Haha)
B00CATSONE|4.0|Quick read gives bio of Tesla without too much tech details and fluff.  Probably a lot more could have been written about this complex genius, but for anyone wanting a thumbnail sketch of Tesla this book fits the bill
B008RA3X5E|5.0|I can listen to mindless behavior music at night and in the morning.  I know what temperature it is now. I really love it
B00CO4KGYA|5.0|A physics based game where the object is to knock over the henchmen of the evil &#34;Explodez&#34; company using your awesome tennis playing skillz!
B00006D295|3.0|It was okay for me. I end up giving it to my uncle,which was the one who suggested I see the movie.
B009FZFONO|5.0|I only started watching this series with my husband this year and we loved it from the first episode. Completely addicting without a doubt.
B009NQZVKG|3.0|Good to spend a quiet weekend reading it. easy to put down and pick up again without loosing the thread of the story. Entertaining, fast paced action. I enjoyed it.
B000JIN3J8|3.0|If this version was disappointing a bit (as it was to me) it is probably because of those that have followed or even preceded (Greer Garson and Laurence Olivier).  None of them are perfect, but in this version, the acting was a little stiff.  It was ok, but not the greatest.
0590431129|5.0|My kids loved this book so much and had so much fun opening and closing all of the flaps, that the first one tore in many places.  After patching it up with tape over and over again, I had to buy another copy.  Loving a book so much that it wears out with use is a Five-Star Book in my opinion!
B0041KBWM0|5.0|I really enjoyed this version of Emma. Followed the storyline as it should have. I will probably watch it again.
B008KE3960|3.0|Good for its price, but i did get bored fast. Im sure there is better tower defense games out there, but this did keep my attention for a week or so.
0739376969|1.0|I bought the cd to go with the book that I was given for an executive leadership program for one of the largest mining companies in the world.  Same old material in a new cover when compared to other change leadership texts.
1449410243|5.0|If you read The Oatmeal comics your going to love the book, there is a lot of new comics included that are not online.
B0080Y93H4|3.0|I don't mind that it is largely fiction based on people Mr. Kiyosaki may have known or just read about but the story is good and makes you think about what money really is and emphasizes saving and investing as well as educating yourself and your children in finance and economics.
B00A3NQNUU|3.0|Good for just simple time consuming play. Its fun to try and get the rare and expensive dragons. The down side is you just play it breifly a couple times a day, there is no sitting in the app for more than 10 or so minutes, which may actually be a plus for some.
0060589051|5.0|I have read all of Jim Collin's work and bought the collection on CD for my drives and to share with coworkers who have the same interest in what makes successful companies tick, grow, die, and recover.
B00CHNKJFO|3.0|Fun pinball game. Has the good idea of up to four person local multiplayer. A down side is trying to figure out the missions. The tiny screen in the upper left corner is hard to read on the kindle in my opinion.
0060555661|5.0|Graham's text is old school; good but like a dry college lecture.  The chapter reviews that are in the revised edition explain what Graham was looking for and his advice therein in relation to today's internet world.  The principles are still sound today.
B00594XOZU|5.0|Its simple and free. I am living in japan and use it to talk to all my and my wifes family members and each other.

0143124544|5.0|You will not be able to put this book down, fantastic story will keep you crying and laughing at the same time.  I have given it to two other people who read it in two days!!
B00ECUARO8|1.0|not worth the time, couldn't even get through the first hour. I'm sure we could have found a better use for our time.
B00932H1HG|5.0|Personally, I think a few of the songs need to be revamped like they play them live, but compared to their previous albums, I think Centipede really makes some progress.  I would compare this album more to their early albums and I'm happy they aren't going in the &#34;merryweather&#34; direction.  that was way to poppy/mtv for me.
B00E978FGQ|5.0|This movie I have seen in a while. I liked the way it kept you in suspense trying to figure out how all this was possible. This is a movie you have watch all the way through and pay attention to every little detail. I have watched it several times and each time I catch something new
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|works well be happy sleep well you should be ok just don't sleep in omg I almost forgot going to western skies tomorrow
B005544TRQ|5.0|funny and smart, great character development and good story line. I would definitely recommend suits for some fun and light viewing
B00C5R8364|5.0|Frederick Forsyth is the master of believable suspense.  In this tale one buys into the concept, likes the good guys, hates the bad guys and is rewarded at the end with a happy ending for the heroes and justice for the villains.  Glad I bought the book.
0425266060|5.0|loved it so much better than 50 shades.. hands  down the best  series I've ever read!  can't wait for  the 4th book..  eagerly waiting with anticipation.
B001NHNG64|5.0|Lee Child is  master of suspense.  His character, Jack Reached, is a modern knight in somewhat tarnished armor and lives by his own interpretation of right and wrong.  He is a power to reckoned with and the author makes him come alive with his masterful use of  words.
B00BOUL9DM|3.0|I really love playing these sorts of games but when I get stumped on on puzzle there should be a way to pass and move onto next one
B008RA3X5E|4.0|I upgraded to this alarm for the music playback alarm and timer for music play when you need something to fall asleep to and do not want to worry about turning it off. The track listings can be difficult to read and the samples played cannot be turned off unless you back out to the previous screen.  Small things overall, and the app works well.  I love i can charge while the app is running because there is nothing changing on the screen to use battery power.
1401223176|5.0|Bought this for a friend who's really into comics. I liked the artistry and quality of the book. It had a great plot with fun twists that keep you entertained. Definitely going to get my own copy:)
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|I didn't know this book was gonna be this good. Also i thought the ending was really good with that twist.
B004SIP8JI|5.0|Hugh Jackman is so cute in this movie! It's refreshing to see a true gentleman:) If you haven't seen this movie yet you definitely need to buy it because its adorable.<br /><br />heres a little blurb on the plot- &#34;When her scientist ex-boyfriend discovers a portal to travel through time -- and brings back a 19th-century nobleman named Leopold to prove it -- a skeptical Kate reluctantly takes responsibility for showing Leopold the 21st century.&#34;<br /><br />The fun twists of the plot will keep you entertained and its definitely a movie worth adding to your collection.
B00DHKKN6Q|5.0|So much more challenging and really cool with the tilt and everything. I recomend it for sure!!!!!im 24 and even i enjoy it. But its still easy enough for kids too.<br />Now for using the battery it really doesnt hurt u too bad but its still a game just use ur coins and jewels wisely.,
B005LAIIQC|4.0|It was a good movie but there were a few aspects of the plot they need to develop further. Example- They randomly had Aaron taking these pills which Jason Bourne never took so that kind of threw me off. But, they do explain why Aaron has to be taking the pills. I suppose I was expecting it to be more like the other Bourne movies. After seeing the Avengers were Jeremy Renner was a some what minor role, i was excited to see him in this movie with a major role. I felt like he did a good job acting in this movie and brought a lot of good energy.<br /><br />It's definitely a movie you need to pay attention in or you'll miss certain, subtle information. Such as- each time I watch it I'll notice or pick up on something I missed the first time watching it.<br />All in all its a good movie and I enjoyed watching it.
B0041KVW2K|2.0|First, let me say I was VERY excited to get my hands on this release. The companion book was my first exposure to the set and i have to say this alone was worth the price of admission. Well thought out and the images are stunning.  The disks on the other hand, were somewhat disappointing. I own a lot of vinyl and the entire Beatles LP/45 catalog in various forms. I was skeptical about the remastering, but have to admit it does the tracks justice, although the presentation of the tracks in this remastered format are very different from previous releases in the UK, Germany or Japan. All of the US releases have been, shall we say, interesting in their own right.<br /><br />As others have commented, I was not impressed with the quality of some of the pressings. In my case Rubber Soul, the White Album and Past Maters all had tracks that skipped, had clicks pops etc right out of the box. Rubber Soul side #2 had visible abrasions. Several of the disks had actual palm or finger prints on them. QA at the pressing plants is obviously lacking. Sending mine back for a replacement. Hopefully my replacement will be delivered in better shape, and if in good order, I'll love it all over again.
B004AGI2L4|4.0|Good movie, a bit on the gory side for my taste (which I expected since it is rated R). Essentially, a platoon of soldiers gets stuck behind enemy lines are are being hunted by this crazy tribe. Only a couple of the guys in the original platoon make it to the end of the movie. I don't want to give away the whole movie though, so, if you have netflix instant you can watch this movie on there before purchasing it to see if your interested.
B00009NQQO|3.0|I bought this to keep my son entertained...it's ok he likes squeezing the water out of the little balls but the net not so much.  we've moved this all around the shower wall and tub and it just wasn't anything spectacular.  He just wasn't interested in playing hoops...so I don't recommend this for those younger than 3...
B005CRQ4OW|5.0|I hate reading but this book just made like LOVE it this was the only book I have ever accomplished
B00DWZHTRW|3.0|What worked:<br />-the long con element of the movie<br />-Mark Ruffalo & M&eacute;lanie Laurent<br /><br />What didn't work:<br />-magic, the magic looked like CGI special effects, it never felt like I was watching a magic trick in movie, felt like I was watching a movie special effect.
B009AY04A8|4.0|I found the game entertaining.  I did not like the fact that on some of the screens you could zoom in and on others you could not.<br />I thought the graphics were great
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Amazing cast and direction. Season 3 seems to be even better than the others. The period is captured so well.
B0083Z614S|5.0|This book made me remember what it was like to be ten years old again.  I think that every one should read this book to their pre teens.
B00CEK9OTM|4.0|Good challenging game to pass the time when waiting for things to happen.  Need good reflexes with the tilting through the maze.
B0064TVQ5E|3.0|I enjoy playing Mahjong.  I would have liked the game better  it there were a choice of tiles.  I liked the different layout options
B007ZD17XO|5.0|This is more challenging than those other games like Candy Crush. And you can actually win. I highly recommend it.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I read enjoy playing this game, it's so relaxing. I love horses and will never be able to afford a real one. This game is just so perfect for me.
0547884591|5.0|a must for every man who needs help in the kitchen bought mine used and wouldnt give it up for anything
B009LMTDL0|4.0|I wasn't sure how well I would like this, but I found it inspiring and helpful. I recommend it to women in all fields, and to men, too.
B00COHAUD4|2.0|boring didnt keep me entertained only worth having on while cleaning the house for background noise or something wouldn't buy
030746363X|5.0|I have tried diet plan after diet plan, and finally I have found one that works.  I think the success comes because of the inherent simplicity of the plan: 5 simple rules!  And a cheat day to take away the blues!
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I like a novel that makes me feel strong emotion for the characters.  This certainly achieved that goal although I tended to overthink the motives of some of the characters.<br />Loved it.
B00003JRCQ|5.0|I love this particular film adaption of Jane Austen's book of the same name, Persuasion.<br /><br />Ciarán Hinds and Amanda Root both give stellar performances as former young lovers, who years later cross paths once again, their old flame re-igniting once more.<br /><br />The entire cast, period costumes, and fabulous English Manors (and Bath!) all pull together to really make the viewer feel a part of the movie, and not just like they are observing from afar.
B005544TRQ|5.0|We were hooked from the very first episode. Every one you watch will leave you wanting more.  Great story lines and well drawn characters, superb writing with plenty of witty dialogue. Love this show!
B000IZ8SD8|5.0|Expertly crafted on all fronts. Great story, acting, dialogue, music and special effects. You don't need to know anything about Star Trek to watch this one and enjoy.
B006Y5H74W|5.0|I loved Smash season 1 I just wish season 2 was available free with my prime membership, I'm not willing to pay $2 / episode to keep watching.
B00CL0J99K|4.0|I'll echo what others have said, it's not quite as good as the excellent first movie, but much better than the disappointing second effort. A slightly more serious tone (probably thanks to Black's script), but still full enough of action, humor and a decent plot to appease everyone. Sure, I was a bit disappointed in what they did with the Mandarin, but hey, it's just a film.
B00821OX98|5.0|Noah Wiley chose well both in a part to direct and star in. The part moves him from a young &#34;movie star idol&#34; to real acting grits.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This story line is quite different than most books out there. I would not have thought of it. If you liked the movie you will for sure like the book, maybe even better. It has some more details and explains a few things so the movie makes more sense.
1401938906|4.0|Not quite all the way through yet, but have been enjoying the experiments and discussing the possibilities. Definitely gives one pause before thinking the usual automated responses.
B00422LESO|5.0|Great book,  loved the twist. I can't wait to see the movie. Unfortunately, it hasn't made it to all theatres.
B003LQ3YXU|4.0|We have heard about this version of Dr. Who and finally got around to watching it. Lots of fun and is good fluff for unwinding.
B00B52F278|5.0|In my review of \\"Vengeance\\" I thought it was a great ending, everyone you love to hate got what was coming to them, who could Spartucus battle with now?....well, in \\"War of the Damned\\" he gets a new advesary in Crassius, a Roman general who is in many ways Spartucus' equal, in many ways I found it difficult to hate this guy, Gladius in \\"Vengeance\\" was easy to hate, however Crassius is likable, you sense that he hates violence but feels it necessary to defend Rome no matter how many die, Crixous & Gannacus return to help Spartucus in the quest for freedom, we get some new characters as well, the wife of a Roman leader in a town that Spartucus & his men overthrow, can't remember her name, but she is beautiful, she resembles Amy Adams but is by far the most beautiful woman on this show (they saved the best for last), we also meet Sybyl, a new slavegirl who takes a liking to Gannacus, on the Roman side we get a young Julius Ceaser, whether or not Ceaser was instrumental in Sparucus' takedown is still being debated, the guy playing Ceaser was good, but I feel he was somewhat of a rip-off of Brad Pitt's character in \\"Troy\\", despite this, Ceaser is portrayed as a brutal Roman, again, we can speculate, no one really knows, I would say it is more accurate to history simply because Ceaser did rule Rome for a time before being betrayed by Cassius & Brutus, we also meet Crassius' son Tiberius who is the main antagonist here, you really yearn for his demise, this guy is more brutal than his father, overall, this was a good conclusion, all good things must end, one can only wonder what Rome would have become had the gladiators got control back in 70 B.C., they came close to defeating the Roman Empire, but in the end, they didn't, I liked how this one showed how people can unite in their quest for freedom & how many were willing to die for it, it is somthing we take for granted today, but back then times were brutal, you were either a Roman elite or a slave, this is a must have for all \\"Spartucus\\" fans, like the previous seasons, this one is full of porn-like sex & excessive violence with added gore, nothing is held back here.
B00CTT9646|4.0|Not only do you get every display version of the film (3D, streaming, Blu-Ray, DVD), but you also get a very cool resin prop phaser featured in the film.  The phaser is sturdy, well detailed and painted and the barrel manually spins from stun to kill, yet is let down by a flimsy plastic display stand.  Not a bad deal at all to be able to own an affordable display prop from the film.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I really enjoyed this app!! It makes it to easy to save my ideas. Great to save all your creative ideas and creations!! It is a must have for anyone who wants to stay organized and your files will be with you wherever you go!!
B004GBIE3Y|5.0|Super cute. The actors were great and the ending was cute. I really enjoyed it a lot. Definitely watch it!
B00ECU34ZM|3.0|Both my husband and I love Sci-Fi.  This one was just okay to me, think they could have done better with this one.
B007TNS6JI|4.0|Nothing ground breaking just a great game. I have been. playing it only for a few days and I love it.
B005HSL626|4.0|This game has entertained my 6 yr old and myself! That is hard to find in a free game! I recommend it 2 adults and kids
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I wasn't really sure what I was getting when I downloaded this, but it is so cool. The way I can mix the sounds to my liking is great. The sound quality is wonderful and I can really relax with this. I would recommend it to anyone that needs to relax and clear their mind and can't get away from the everyday noise. LOVE IT!!!!!
B002KCO6QA|1.0|&#34;Will not play in region one or most DVD players&#34; should be in the title. Thanks for the cheap piece of useless junk.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|This is a fun app if you love horses.  You have to be careful of the charges which I refuse to pay and I don't mind a little advertisement at the beginning but now they are popping up all the time.  But overall it is a lot of fun and the graphics are unbelievable.
B00CH26TL8|5.0|I have been playing this game on my laptop for a long time. I am delighted to finally be able to play it on my Kindle Fire.
B008BQ8YHQ|4.0|Good acting and script...entertaining<br />To watch. It acually got  better as it progressed I would highly recommend it. U bet
B004YM6JI2|5.0|Great plots, involved with theology and the real world situations. Love Jensen Ackles because he has really has learned his trade. Marvelous actor! Love Jared Padalecki for his development of his character. He is so believable. I just love these brothers on so many levels. Great directing great special effects and well written scripts. Go for it Team!  Highly recommended.
1451626096|3.0|The answer to every question asked the queen?<br />\\"I don't know...no one tells me anything?\\"<br />Time after time that's all she says. I don't know why the author could not have given this queen a backbone, really????<br />Henry VII is portrayed as a king that is not loved, unsure of how to hold his kingdom, and always looking out for traitors. In fact, he spends the next 13 years looking for traitors.<br />What really got me hot about this book, and not in a good way, the ghost boy, or Perkin Warback, the lost prince in the tower, come home to finally reclaim his crown never hardly speaks any word in this book. He and the queen do not talk about thier feelings of finally being reunited as brother and sister. Henry VII threatens the queen to not acknowlege the boy in any sort, he has a past of the boy drawn up so that everyone can know that Perkin is a nobody. Missing here? The authors imagination. She should have let Elizabeth defy the king and speak to Perkin. Is he really the missing prince, her lost brother? A pretneder like everyone says he is? we shall never know.<br />Margaret, or My Lady Mother the King's mother, whatever the hell she names herself, is the mother in law from hell!!!!!!!!!!! Elizabeth does not even insist on having the queen's rooms, which she should have by right.The one thing that really got me pissed is when Henry tell Elziabeth that he will disown her of she acknowlegeds Perkin (her real brother or not) He also states that she will never see her kids and they will learn that she is a witch and a whore. SLAP TIME FOR POOR OLD HENRY, IN MY EYES<br />The book goes on and way on about Perkin for chapters on end, before we finally see him and then, he hardly ever here him say anything.<br />What's the deal on Henry being in love with Perkin's wife, Lady Katherine. I mean, there should have been some love scene between her and Henry. She states that she was his mistress for one time only to save her husband from death, let's see it!!!!!!<br />I still say the Other Boleyn Girl is far better than any story has written. She has one more book left in the series, and that's going to be about Margaret of York, daughter of George of Clarance and Isabel Neville. She was hacked to death by Henry VIII as an old woman in her 70s. This family gets crazy by the minute!!!!!I still say the Other Boleyn Girl is far better than any story has written. She has one more book left in the series, and that's going to be about Margaret of York, daughter of George of Clarance and Isabel Neville. She was hacked to death by Henry VIII as an old woman in her 70s. This family gets crazy by the minute!!!!!
B001PJRAUS|5.0|I rarely review what so many others have, but \\"Lost in Austen\\" has to be an exception.  Not realizing it had begun as a television series,  I was surprised how long the DVD played, but I was mesmerized until far into the night.  Others have commented on the superb casting and fast-moving pace.  This is not just another chick flick!<br /><br />The idea of some kind of portal inside a home, leading to another world, is not a new theme.  The young people's \\"Twitches\\" films, earlier though far less significant,  used the portal theme to good effect.  Finding a secret door leading to another reality is the fantasy of many children, though most surely don't expect to look for it in a bathroom!<br /><br />Neither is the concept of jumping into a book unique, not so much the fantasy of children, but of avid-reading adults.  Jasper Fforde has a well-written, entertaining novel series beginning with \\"The Eyre Affair,\\"  based on a British government literary detective who jumps in and out of a variety of classic novels, occasionally including those of Austen.  While we get a brief glimpse of classic novel settings and wonderful characters in these literary excursions, the main focus remains Fforde's protagonist and her goal of solving a mystery or bringing back her \\"eradicated\\" husband. In \\"Lost in Austen,\\" the classic novel is the central reality.<br /><br />The magic of \\"Lost in Austen\\" is \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" itself, and the desire so many of us have to experience more of it, lamenting that Austen's life was rather brief, only enough time to create a handful of superb novels.  Protagonist Amanda is perfectly representative of those of us who have read and reread, watched and re-watched all that has been published or presented, thirsting for more.  THIS IS MORE!<br /><br />There is a certain frustration for those of us who are sure the plot of Austen cannot be altered.  Amanda herself suffers just such emotion, creating a tension that is both upsetting and intriguing, as she tries to force each character to do the right thing.  How could we as viewers not expect that when a writer inserts a modern character into an antique setting (as in \\"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court\\") the potential is created for something original, quite different than Austen herself envisioned?  Because it is Jane Austen's enduring masterpiece, we all know what characters are like, who marries whom, and how it ends...Or do we?

B00CNEVII4|4.0|I haven't heard this yet - but still intend to buy it despite the first review on here that said it sounds \\"ok\\" and speculates that they might not have used the 1st gen master - because even that would sound better than the standard disc from 1995 that's out there, which I can barely listen to it sounds that awful (despite it being one of the great recordings of the era.)<br /><br />This same company put out the five Stevie Wonder albums from the first half of the 70s, and I am aware that those do not use the 1st gen master tape either, for no reason other than that Stevie himself will not allow anyone to touch them - but even still, those discs sound to my ears miles above even the remasters Motown put out in 2000 of those titles.
B009LDD22U|5.0|One reason The tenure turbulence episode I now can watch it over & over The sixith season deserves five stars just for that episode in my opinion can't wait to open my Blu-ray set & start watching till the seventh season starts
B0050DIWFC|4.0|This is a good read, however, I think the character development could have been better--I would start getting drawn to a character, and would somehow feel disappointed---that being said, the book is a good read and the plot is an interesting concept.
B00DQVSTCG|1.0|I Was so disappointed when i got the blu-ray. This is not ok! Have been waiting for this on HD. This is not perfection at all... Picture and sound are a UGLY MESS!<br />I wonder if Madonna or her team are blind? Or do they not care? Skip this blu-ray release...
B0083Z614S|5.0|This story of the development of a child who is inspired by nature is one of the best classics I have read
B009ZQJ0ME|1.0|It was so bad that I we turned it off in the first 20 minutes. Poorly written, poorly acted.... really just a dumb movie.
0385335997|4.0|I've read the entire outlander series. The first book was by-far the best. This one is entertaining just because of how Diana Gabaldon writes.
B0058W74UY|1.0|This useless piece of crap doesn't work, so I deleted it immediately. Don't bother.  It does not play flash on my Kindle.
B000VSAEYI|5.0|i have two toddler grandkids age 2 and 2 1/2 bought this pool in may of 2012 when they were only 1 and 1 1/2. absolutely love it! it is a great size. i can actually sit where the turtle picture on the bottom is and have plenty of room for them to run/splash/attack all around me. the slide is much more durable than i expected. this year it has started losing air. this seems to be an issue from glancing thru the reviews, but it lasted us 2 summers and for the price you cant beat it. it has taught the kids how to splash, kick, play and dunk their faces without the trauma of a deep pool and while having fun. the water can be filled to any depth so that helps with younger kids too. the size really cant be beat. i will be ordering another one as the price drops, because it is the biggest pool that i can find for the prices without going really deep.
B00A757EFW|4.0|Like the &#34;old days! Fun & brings back memories of my kidders & that accompanying....noise! It's a good thing!!! ..and I can turn the sound off! LOL!
0738711500|5.0|In the book Josephine Ellershaw has a way with words!  She doesn't mince them up and make them all sweet.  She say's this is what has worked for me.  Do it my way and you'll be a good reader of the tarot.  I have to say, that after trying two other 'Learn the tarot' systems, she is actually right!  The way she breaks her system down into 22 steps makes sense and although I thought the detail of her journal instructions was a bit over the top, I did it her way, and it actually worked for me!  Then there are the cards, oh, I love these cards.  I wish the actual card quality was higher, but, I can live with it because the images from artist Ciro Marchetti are so breathtaking.  Between Josie's detailed instruction and Ciro Marchetti's art I feel connected.

B00DR0PDNE|3.0|When the chromecast by google came out it was worshiped by many in the tech press. Some, like Leo Laporte bought several units right away. All of this sight unseen. So, is the actual unit as good as these folks would have us believe? Nope. It's an ok device for particular use cases but don't look to this device to solve the living room TV's problems. Look for Apple to do that sometime soon.<br /><br />Two of chromecast's biggest problems are: 1) Not so easy setup. Although the tech fanboys would have you believe setup is a piece of cake it many not be so easy for many would-be users. 2) Once it's operational it's not so easy or fast to use. For example if you get a phone call while watching TV to pause your show you need to wakeup your control device and even then it takes a few seconds to pause a YouTube video or Netflix movie. google should at the very least bundle a simple remote that allows a user to pause and then resume viewing.<br /><br />As is often the case the promise of the device and real world usability do not equate. My guess is in most cases I'll continue using my five year old Roku box.
B00932A4XE|1.0|Dumb movie.  For the types of actors in this movie, it had a very poor story line and very poor acting.  Ladies, you are much better off reading the true books of What To Expect When You're Expecting.  Don't watch this movie, it's not even funny.
B00E8TVHBA|4.0|I rented this movie for my granddaughters to watch and they absolutely loved it.  The clarity was good and they've watched it twice so far.
B001XVD21Y|4.0|I watched this on my Kindle HD during a vacation car ride.  A great way to pass the time with this rental.  The story is gripping and will keep your interest at a high level.

B00EY8BRGU|5.0|If your looking for the next Godfather or instant classic this isn't it. But if you are looking for some good fun, one liners, a cast that feeds well off each other, and some cool \\"illusions\\" then this is it. The movie doesn't try to be more than it is. It's a movie about magicians that with the help of it being a MOVIE do some really cool over the top unrealistic stuff. If your problem of the movie was \\"Well that can't be real, or they couldn't rob a bank like that\\" then you missed the point. Sit back and relax! Don't take things so literal and enjoy the over the top ride that is Now You See Me. I loved it!
B004DLPXAO|2.0|I love kindle. I have two devices and really love using them. With really high expectations I have downloaded kindle for android to my HTC One. At first it worked fine. But after a while it crashed and whenever I tried to open it closed itself. I have uninstalled and reinstalled it several times. Now it opens, yes. But after tapping its icon for 8 or 9 times. If it is in the mood it opens after two or 3 :) By the way I have discovered something recently. If you close the app on the open book page screen, it opens with the first touch next time you want to open the app. This problem should be fixed immediately.
B000LB7G00|5.0|Exactly what I wanted perfect starter for 3d cad<br />zooming panning and rotating models in every direction<br />feels like good quality as well

B0013TXA5Y|2.0|Everyone says this story is great... I just can't sit down and read it.. I found it so boring I couldn't even get through the whole first chapter.
B00AZMFJYA|5.0|FROM BEGINNING TO END THIS MOVIE IS ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL.  EXCELLENT MOVIE. IT IS WORTH EVERY PENNY.  WAITING FOR IT TO BE RELEASED. I WAS NEVER A FAN OF THE STAR TREK SERIES, BUT SINCE THEY STARTED MAKING THESE MOVIES I AM ABSOLUTELY HOOKED.  THE CREW EACH AND EVERYONE OF THEM ARE BRILLIANT PORTRAYING THE OLD CHARACTERS. BUY IT. SIT DOWN WITH THE FAMILY AND ENJOY A GREAT MOVIE.
B00CDT41RY|5.0|Good Entertainment from a outstanding director, excellent cast of actors and actresses, and subject matter of great importance. Slavery and it's evils is a subject that is avoided in this country. It is a subject that has to be confronted because to understand this country and it's culture, slavery has to be understood. America is like a person who needs therapy that is in denial.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|John Green is an author I previously only knew from the YouTube machine, and I couldn't be happier that his fanbase pushed me to buy this book to try it out. Read it in just a few days - I don't normally like non-comedy books, yet he managed to keep me engaged for the entire book.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Such a well done series, and it continues in Season 3. Love the plot, the dialogue, scenery, costuming, everything. Can't wait for Season 4!
B008HJGPVO|5.0|Love that it has a tip on both ends so I can touch screen without having to make sure the stylus tip is pointing down. My old stylus's top was hitting screen instead of the tip. The tip is still in great shape after daily use for about 4 months.The case is textured and when I place it in the elastic band for the stylus of my Kindle Fire case it stays without having to clip it to the elastic band and fraying the elastic.I annoy co-workers by absently bouncing it on the table while working on crossword puzzles at break. Love it.
B00DQVSTCG|5.0|My Bluray works great...ALL speakers are working on ALL three audio options for me.The disc menu is a little tricky but it does work I just had to move the curser to the left and right, not just up and down for menu options. I also think the picture looks great. Madonna clearly had a different vision for the way she wanted the picture to look....and it works! I remember when people were pissy with Truth or Dare's black and white segments, and look it worked! Can't wait to have my viewing party for this Bluray!
B00DQAM5LI|3.0|Count me among the haters, but what happened to Avenged Sevenfold? Where's the complexity? Where's the melodrama, the angst? I could always tell an Avenged Sevenfold song from their unique style. There was no other band out there like them. Now they just sound like every other band - GnR, Iron Maiden, Metallica, Black Sabbath, all great influences but come on. What happened to originality? I'll give them one more try the next time they release an album, but if they don't get back their mojo....buh bye.
B008SAZHLQ|4.0|I bought this book as an adult (middle aged) reader and am reviewing it in that capacity. As a YA novel, 5 stars. A very enjoyable, yet not fluffy,, read for not-young adults.  The author does a great job of bringing characters and situations to life - for some, perhaps uncomfortably so. For others, it will be a gratifying experience.
B00EDF43MY|5.0|I have most of the Dr. Panda apps and this one is one of the best.  It has number recognition, problem solving, matching and other fun skills let my girls love to figure out.  Thanks for making another great one!
B00AYB0TOW|1.0|Don't even waist your time on this movie, it never should have been made. Great example of Hollywood just collecting a check..
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|I thought this would allow me to play on my TV any pics or video I had on my iPad and iPhone. It only does Netflix and YouTube which I already have using my BluRay player.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Great book, can't wait for book three in 2014 to follow the rest of this great story of fiction and real history.
B00F35BV64|1.0|Being an original 1966 Trekkie, I found this movie so tedious. The characters were over the top poor copies of the originals. They went overboard with Spock's &#34;logic&#34;  overboard with Kirk's distaste for rules and authority, Bones was just ridiculous. Just a very bad copy of all that is Star Trek. I will say that the actor who portrayed Spock did a fine job and visually he WAS Spock.
B004PGO25O|5.0|Powerful penetrating and convicting!  Born from the same cloth as Seth Godins \\"Poke the box\\" I will need to read this...ship..read this ... ship over and over again.<br /><br />Thank you Steven for shipping this one to all of us!
B00ECU34ZM|1.0|This movie is about 9 minutes long without the special effects. If you like special effects, you will enjoy this movie. I like a plot myself.
B004ZN9Q3K|5.0|I have wanted to add this to my music collection for a while and now I have it, and remastered at that! It sounds great, no annoying hiss. And there are a lot of great tunes on this disc including Echoes, one of my favorites. this is a good buy. Get it.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|OMG I literally read this book in like a day and I absolutely loved it!!!!!!!!!! So I have to read the next no doubt about that!!!!!
B001DCZ4IW|5.0|Ruth Gordon gives an outstanding performance in this movie, she is so funny and makes you fall in love with her character Maude. I have enjoyed this movie over the years and am glad I finally own it and can watch it as often as I want. The humor is a little dark, but it's done so well. Have a little irreverence and get this movie, you will like it too.
B00CLT31D6|5.0|If you don't get to read a lot of books on building wealth this is a must read. There's nothing quite as important as to knowing the facts about others who have build their wealth from small beginnings. The idea about this book is NOT to read from cover to cover, but to rather read and reflect on your own life as to the goals you wish to achieve with yours.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I would give it 6 stars if I could. A must read.It hold you all the way to the end.
B00002N9ER|4.0|very securely hold newer maglites; won't fit the older ones though; the handle tube on the older ones is too thick
B001EBWITA|4.0|It was pretty good, very interesting concept, good acting. Love the actors and actresses in this movie. They're awesome. And the storyline was decent
B000FBJFSC|3.0|This book hurt my heart...Frankie McCourt grew up in a much different time than we live in here in the Western world.  &#34;Like&#34; is the wrong word, but fulfilling, in that we &#34;feel&#34; the pains of the mother who lost children, those who were left behind, and those who picked up the pieces.<br /><br />It's a book worth your time.
B0040I09RM|5.0|Once I started watching season one I couldn't stop until I finished the whole seasons.  I didn't like having to pay for season 5 but I did anyway.  You have to watch it before season 6.
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|I enjoyed this book a lot. It's a book that you can't put down. I will red this author again.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|It was a quick read. I really enjoyed it. I would definitely recommend to anyone. From start to finish it was a great story.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|After reading the kite runner I decided to give  this one a try and was not disappointed. Would definitely recommend.
B00EJOCAYW|4.0|The set itself is too small as i expected. I bought all three sets knowing that my son would love them. He was a bit disappointed as to how small the parts are as you can not use them with regular lego pieces. All in all, he's had a great time playing them and trying to combine the pieces together to create a much bigger mine craft world. It was a bit pricey but all worth it.
B007PVHMCG|4.0|My son loves this set. He can't stop playing and combining the pieces from the other 2 sets. He can not wait for lego to  release more.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Very easy to use and very interactive... even my 5 year old likes to play this game! It almost feels like you're taking care of a real house just without breaking a sweat our strong in poop
B002EAKWEI|5.0|I just love Jeremy Brett's Sherlock Holmes character.  They had all the episodes on Netflix for some time then as Netflix does with painful regularity they pulled it (probably their license for the series expired but nonetheless it is a shock to see something you enjoy disappearing in 7 days - but I digress).<br /><br />Only through the first season I was hooked and decided to just buy the entire series since I'm sure I'll watch it multiple times through the years. I bought this UK version since it is half the cost of the US version and is exactly the same series.<br /><br />The \\"secret\\" to buying (and PLAYING) Region 2 dvd's is to simply have a multi-region DVD player.  You can buy one specifically OR do what I do, which is to have a second optical drive in your computer and assign it to play Region 2.  Windows lets you change the setting up to 5 times but for the cost of a second optical drive (I bought the generic/bulk Lite-On drive right here on Amazon for $20) I just added the drive and permanently assigned it Region 2.  I have an HDMI cable running from the computer to my TV and voila! - perfect picture and sound.  I buy Region 2 dvd's whenever I can and have paid for the drive many times over plus saved a lot of money in general.  As I said Region 2 is exactly the same quality and technology - why get ripped off by being forced against your will into Region 1?<br /><br />These discs play perfectly and the quality is as good as it was when I was streaming it from Netflix.  This is one of the most entertaining series I have come across and I am thrilled to have made the purchase at less than $1 per episode and I can have it for the rest of my life.  I'm 100% completely satisfied.
0345803507|5.0|The last installment to the Fift Shades series was perfect. It answered every question and gave readers a sense of closure while still being exciting and romantically intense.
B00D8OHPF8|5.0|My all time favorite artist did it again!!  I've purchased about 4 or 5 new CD's over the past couple of months and this one is at the top of my list!!  Definitely one to purchase...love the song with Fantasia!!!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It is awesome I don't know how to explain it ok I just explained it so I like it soo much
B005603236|5.0|I really enjoyed this file as it was fun, where it should be, austere in places, but beautifully filmed and nicely acted. I was surprised that I like JJ Field in this role. He did a ver good job and made the role believable and likeable.
B004SRPXWQ|3.0|You can make it  age appropriate if you wish for kids.  Some of the actions are what I call &#34;potty humor&#34;, but still cute.
B00C7JGDBW|5.0|Very well done. A  beautiful film to look at and very well acted. Great fun film across all the boundaries.
B008AIGWVA|3.0|This would be entertaining for preschool age children, but boring for anyone older.  I was curious, so I had to check it out.  I would not pay money to upgrade it.
B00A83075M|5.0|If our four-year-old grandson and three-year-old granddaughter weren't ga-ga for this movie, it would have never crossed our threshold.  It was all my husband and I could do to watch it with them in the theatre.  However, the babies do love it, there's certainly nothing socially or morally objectionable about it (it actually teaches some fine lessons), and we would recommend it to anyone with the patience of Job who needs to entertain small children.  (If you're fortunate, the child will fall asleep during the movie and you can change it to something else while you pour a much-needed glass of wine for yourself.)
B00B7Y0206|4.0|It is easy to use, and gives you a sneak peek at what everyone is watching on You Tube.  The videos are large enough to view in detail.
B00000K3D4|5.0|I love this movie; I have loved it since I saw it for the first time at 8 years old and I love it to this day. It's a sweet coming of age story with a fun fantasy romp format. Five/Five, highly recommend.
B008P1EWIM|4.0|I like to keep an eye on the local weather, and also track the weather conditions for my family members in differant parts of the country.  This app helps to do this easily.  You can also earn points to buy stuff on Amazon!
B007BZM3HK|5.0|I love this song. It's extremely fun and catchy and a great summer-y song. At this point it's unlikely you haven't heard it, but if you haven't give it a listen; it's unlikely you won't want to hum along.
B008YU0AOE|5.0|I am a senior citizen, so conventional calculators seem to small to see and operate.  I love this calculator because it is large on the screen, and so easy to use!  I can balance my check book with ease!
B008HJGPVO|5.0|Stylus is functional and easy to use. Multi-Tip feature offers multiple options for use. Very good quality. Would recommend this.
B00AX6KMGS|4.0|If you are a fan of old science fiction films, you will probably like this film.  I would compare it to 60s favorites, like THE BLOB, or MY FAVORITE MARTIAN.  Maybe a combination of the two!  I enjoyed it.
B008JFLWLE|1.0|this software requires active connection AND sign in to amazon to function, that in my opinion makes in worthless to me.
B009GEPSDK|4.0|I didn't think it was  that confusing..We enjoyed the movie!  Lots of Action and Suspence  Keeps you guessing  In my opinion its worth the rent!
B00DJWV11I|1.0|I can't get over how horrible this book is. Yeh sure you get a guy's perspective but it's kind of unrealistic how quickly he changes from player to sappy 'in love' guy. Honestly it was more about last than love. Plus there was a tonne of swearing which I really didn't care for.
B004SOR4H6|4.0|Absolutely no surprises here.  I use Twitter on my mobile phone (TweetDeck on the laptop) and I found Twitter on my Kindle to behave and perform exactly as I expected.  I haven't found a TweetDeck equivalent for the phone or tablet but this is a satisfactory set up.
B00CKOYVG8|5.0|When you need a distraction from the challenges of the day, what fun this game is.  Not just for kids, you can really get wrapped up in this...
B00DJUPLY8|4.0|Amazingly enough I was surprised at the few players that can play this audio format as popular as it is. This player plays it.<br /><br />The only problem I had was that when I started my video the video played upside down. However, after going into settings and changing the display to reverse landscape it seems to have fixed the problem. It just seems odd that it would choose to do this right off the bat.<br /><br />I'm looking forward to finding out what else it will play.
B004SBX112|5.0|Another fun way to get away from the routine of the day. Who is angrier in the end... you or the birds?
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|1st movie in a long time to follow story line of book, and i really like that aspect of it
1250030951|5.0|I've heard, repeatedly, that Rainbow Rowell's writing has a magical quality, so I knew I needed to read one of her novels. So, when the opportunity arose to read Fangirl, I had high expectations, but that ended up totally fine because I loved this book to pieces.<br /><br />If you looked next to the definition of introvert in the dictionary, you might see a picture of Fangirl's main character, Cath. In real life, Cath is quiet, solitary, and anxious when it comes to interacting with others. Which makes her first semester at university especially difficult: she's far from her dad, who she worries about constantly, her twin sister wants to branch out and begin her own, independent life, her new roommate might hate her, and her roommate's boyfriend is entirely too chatty for loner Cath. To add to the overwhelming mess of college, Cath has some very unique commitments: she's a Simon Snow fangirl. In fact, she's so committed to the Simon Snow books that she writes them... well, versions of them. Cath is well known - and widely read - in the Simon Snow world and, with the release of the final book approaching, she's under more pressure than ever to finish her version of Simon's story as well. Cath has to figure out how to balance her relationships and responsibilities, how to leave the safe warmth of her comfort zone, and, ultimately, embrace happiness.<br /><br />For me, the most amazing aspect of Fangirl was how completely I was able to relate to the characters and actually picture the events as they happened. I think this was partially from having gone to university and having felt just as lost as Cath at the beginning Everything that happened in the book, whether it ever actually happened to me personally, felt achingly familiar. There is an honesty about Rowell's writing that allows for this sense of connection. Fangirl is a perfect example of a book that let's readers know they're not alone, that someone else out there in the world has experienced the same feelings and made it through the same situations.<br /><br />I loved Cath's writing professor. In my experience, it isn't often that students run across professors that take such an interest in their students, who really care whether they succeed and embrace their potential, but it's those professors who make the college experience really worth it. I appreciated the professor's part in Cath's story; she was a valuable source of direction and encouragement in the sea of overwhelming newness that is the first year of college.<br /><br />It was also refreshing to see Cath have such a close relationship with her family. Her father, in particular, was an interesting character. Often, in YA, the reader only sees bits of the parent(s), but I felt like I really got to know Cath's father. Cath's mother is an entirely different story, having left the family when Cath was quite young, we are only able to see flashes of her, memories and quick images as she tries to salvage a relationship with the twins after years of absence. What struck me, however, about Rowell's portrayal of Cath's parents, is that they are neither good nor bad. They are just people with flaws and quirks and twin daughters. Again, the honesty of Rowell's writing asserts itself.<br /><br />Cath's college experience is like that of many young adults, so the premise of Fangirl is by no means new and shiny, but Cath - and the way she thinks and sees the world - makes the premise feel new again. Cath messes up, she makes unexpected new friends, faces challenges, and falls for a boy. She must admit to her mistakes, open up to her new friends, find the strength tackle new situations, and the bravery to love a boy.<br /><br />Read Fangirl, whether you already love Rowell's writing or have only heard good things about it. And be prepared to fall in love with the raw honesty you'll find within these pages.and made it through the same situations.<br /><br />I loved Cath's writing professor.

B00425S1H8|5.0|This unit supports Win8, which is what I needed.  Solved my problem and worth the extra cost.  Like all such adapters, you have to  be consistent where you plug in the USB, since the COM port varies  with the USB port.
B008FRFN7A|3.0|I was able to get this connected to my printer and working, hard to set up but I did it. my word documents are printing in a different font and in a messed up format, which is a real pain. cant seem to find a way to fix it. other that this is a pretty good app once you get it working
B0036S4B6M|4.0|Very fast read and interesting. I'll probably watch it on Netflix, too, and will see how my visions of the characters differ from the cast.  Good story, though. Could have gone much deeper, I suppose, but maybe the Netflix series will accomplish that for me!
B00B19G01C|1.0|Can't say anything good about this movie.  It was one of the worst movies I've seen.  I rarely write bad reviews, but had to this time.
B003QSJDZQ|5.0|My kids LOVE this movie...It had been years since we've seen it. We saw it offered on amazon and had to rewatch it!! It is worth it!!
B00DU70UBO|5.0|It's difficult with the explosion of separate extra editions for some of our favorite movies. If you have yet to purchase Wolverine Origins, the Amazon Prime edition with the Digital Exclusive gives viewers an hours worth of new interviews and footage from across the X-Movie universe.

B002QE3CTY|5.0|My friend and I got in a heated discussion over books at the end of one of our classes which led us to suggesting books to each. She told me that this series is her all time favorite book. And I have to agree! The beginning was very confusing because we knew as much as Thomas did. However, once you get further into the book you start to understand everything better. I loved the characters, the plot and just about everything in this book! I can't wait to read book two!
B004SIIBGU|3.0|I don't think it is nearly as good as a full blown computer going to eBay's website.<br />I use eBay all the time and will  use this but it is really inferior to the PC version.[[ASIN:B004SIIBGU Official eBay Android App]]
B008Y6OS64|5.0|Who woud think that that heroin addition could be so funny?  I mean we know about &#34;death and dying, and all that $#%^&#34;.  So buckle your seatbelts and (I hope you) enjoy the wild ride.  Not recommended for those who would find the subject matter distaseful as this is a drama with comedic moments, not a documentary.<br /><br />Unfortunately the opening monologue is not the same as the original movie which I first watched on VHS.  This version sounds more like Rentz is practicing his dictation for a school speech,  I prefer the edgier, original version.<br /><br />The conclusion does leave a few items open, possibly for a sequel.
B00AYB1RGG|1.0|Bad acting, bad script, bad effects - just plain bad.  Impossible to even focus on the movie, never did get all the way through it.
B00A0SICYI|5.0|Actually I really enjoyed this movie.  My wife burst out laughing looking at some of the period costumes.  Very likable dance numbers thoughout.  Smilar calibre of entertainment to Mary Poppins by Disney, but I would give Mary Poppins a slightly higher score.<br /><br />A few caveats:<br />1) Hope that you never read the original Ian Fleming book, as it has a much different storyline, although it's still about a magical car.  When I first watched the movie, I was disappointed it didn't follow the original story.<br />2) The lead song is a bit strained as it is hard to rhyme Chitty-Chitty-Bang-Bang.<br />3) Dick Van Dyke's English accent is quite a bit off the mark.
B006VFLIYK|4.0|I love the author's writing style and the way he engages the reader right up to the end!  I'll keep reading more and more.  Not many author's I can say that about.

0399157565|4.0|Scarpetta is always interesting reading. Her position has changed however. Others seem to know things before her and are protecting her from the outside.
0062014536|4.0|This has been on my wish list since I read Pandemonium last year.  Lena escaped back into the Wilds with Julian at the end of the last book only to find that Alex, the boy she fell in love with in Delirium and planned to escape to the Wilds with only to be met by Regulators at the crossing where she saw him shot and thought he died, is still alive and is now back in the Wilds as well.  I was worried at the conclusion of Pandemonium that this book would be another YA love story where the main character had to pick between two guys, but this is much more than that.  There are so many bigger things going on than who Lena loves that it was easy to forget about the triangle for pages at a time.  Seeing what was happening from both the resistance in the Wilds and from Hana on the inside within society gave a much fuller picture and showed that no one is all good or all bad on either side of the issue.  I enjoyed the mystery of what happened to Hana's fianc&eacute;e's first wife and how she went about looking for answers.  Also, how unequal society can be even when love is taken out of the equation.  How even those who say they are working for the good of all may just be looking for a way to push their own agenda and better their own standing in society.  Is there a way to make things equal?  Can we accept the differences of others and live peacefully?  What is the world if we take away feelings of attachment and love?  I wasn't sure how it would all be wrapped up at the end and I was afraid of being disappointed, but Oliver did a nice job of concluding the series.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Good escape! Nice way to turn off everything else in your mind yet still exercise your brain a little. And it's free!
159413605X|4.0|I started this book as an audio book and then switched to print so that I could read it faster.  (I also read it a few months ago so it isn't as fresh in my mind as it was when I finished it.)  I just had to see what was going to happen.  At first it seems like Nick is the worst husband in the world, making his wife leave the city she loves to come to his hometown where she has no friends and no hope of a job, but from there things change.  Amy is missing, and has gone missing on her fifth wedding anniversary, Nick is having an affair with a younger girl and working at a bar he owns with his sister, the police think he is responsible for whatever befell his wife.<br /><br /> From the beginning I wondered if Nick could really be that self centered and cold and if Amy could really be as perfect and accommodating as she seemed in her diary, but from there it just goes.  Hearing Amy in her own voice, not her journal voice, but her actual voice changes everything.  Is she alive or is she dead, where did she go and why, who is she with and is it because she wants to be there or has she been taken.  The book leads you through quite a few twists and turns and each time I thought I was onto how it was going to play out something new would be thrown into the mix.  I don't want to give anything away, although at this point I am sure there are plenty of spoilers out there, but I have to say I have some conflicted feelings about the ending, it just doesn't seem fair, but nothing about this book or this marriage really seem fair.<br /><br /> The book also brings up questions of what we are all capable of doing and being.  How much manipulation can twist a relationship and when should someone feel guilt.  Can someone be so broken inside that he or she is unable to feel guilt or see things from someone else's perspective.  This was well written and suspenseful, but quite unsettling.
B0033H7VI6|5.0|Great knife and survival tool.  Very high quality and a great price. Thank you very much this will be a great addition to my pack
B00DU74U74|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie because unlike most authors Stephenie Myer gets involved with the screen writers, directors, and producers to ensure that her books are shown on the big screen as written. I can honestly say that when I was watching the movies that I felt like I had the book in my hand. Kudos to everyone who helped create this authentic visualization of the story. Too bad Stephenie Myer did not write a sequel, but we can always hope.
0385347774|5.0|Great book,  Suspensful, interesting and keeps you wanting more with the turn of every page.  Was on a cruise when I read the book and missed some of the activities so I could keep on reading

B000I0XLYO|5.0|Do not see this if you are looking for real world entrance into information on Male Modeling. Well, some may be factual, but, very loosely based. I love this movie, I laugh every time at the one liners and performance of Will Farrell. Great fun and enjoyable movie if you want to forget about things for a while.
0688014291|5.0|I have been carrying these philosophies with my recruiting at Google since I read this book. It preaches simplicity and consistency, the two most important attributes at the workplace. I recommend this book to anyone in a leadership position.
B00AYB0TOW|5.0|Loved this movie. Was a skeptic since I live the Stallone Dredd movie. But, this one was well orchestrated in it's delivery. the scenes are not overly violent and when the Slo-Mo takes effect in the film, it adds am artistic and rich glimpse at the art.
B00E5Q1LTY|4.0|STID depends on what you're expecting. I won't say I loved the film, but it still kept the ball rolling.<br /><br />If you're new to Trek, it's a fantastic movie in most ways. If you've been around the block with TOS and know the movies, you'll likely have a more than a few more bones to pick with the plot and characters. All in all, from both sides STID is not as good as the first movie, but it is still GOOD.<br /><br />Chris Pine does the character of Captain Kirk justice in a ways that Shatner never did (in my opinion--I mean come on, Tarsus? Where the hell is the rest of THAT story?--and Zachary Quinto is flawlessly Vulcan except when he's not, which Nemoy seldom was. Bones doesn't get as much screen time in this film, I think, which is frankly tragic considering how ridiculously on point Karl Urban interprets a younger version of the surly southern doctor. If there's one thing Urban is good at, it's scowling like he can't make his face do anything else. McCoy is unfortunately relegated to some one-liners and a bit of insignificant dialog, but Karl Urban puts on his scowly face and does what he can to make the movie better.<br /><br />I won't say STID meshes with my ideals of continuation from the first Reboot movie, but it's good. Cumberbatch is a fantastic Villian, whatever complaints about how he looks, and the plot and message are varied but focused. I couldn't ask for a more well-rounded film... even if I would have approached it differently.<br /><br />All I can really say as someone who knows TOS as that this is an Alternate Universe, and these are self-contained plotlines. Existing ideas are used as an homage, not as a template, and it's imperative to keep an open mind if you hope to enjoy this movie.<br /><br />That being said, plot holes abound. Stupid film making mistakes are here and there, and some really big events are ignored in favor of moving on. Not my favorite thing.<br /><br />K
B00ADS98FC|5.0|This movie made me laugh so hard! My daughter & I watched it three times when it first came out! They left it wide open in the end & I hope they make another one!!!!

0316069884|5.0|Eating Animals went way beyond meeting my expectations. It changed my life significantly. The book was given to me a couple of years ago. It took me awhile to actually sit down and read it since I knew I would eliminate meat and fish from my diet again after many years of eating everything once I read it. I buy copies now to give as gifts because I believe so strongly in what the author has written.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This was a great book. THe story is complex with great characters. The plot is well paced with good twists. I am really looking forward to the two sequels.

All Queen fans should buy this one.
1451695195|5.0|I received the item and read the book in one sitting.  It is fast paced and the content interesting, especially since the author came from such a scientific background, and is commenting on issues not yet proved by science.
B00AYB1KHW|4.0|Much of the plot of &#34;The Faculty&#34; has been done before, but not as broadly nor as with so much black humor.  I very much liked this movie-it jelled for me-not too much horror, but enough to make me wince at times; many times it seemed like a satire of horror movies past.  Good acting and very good harmony between the actors; one could see that they liked each other and that they were having fun making the movie.
B00821OX98|5.0|I started watching Falling Skies over half way through Season Two.  I finally got to watch Season One when I got Amazon Prime and have I loved it.  It was worth getting Amazon Prime just to catch up on all the TV series where I had missed the first seasons.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Exciting and easy read. Couldn't wait to find out the next twist and loved how the author intertwined the ladies` lives. Great book
B005LAIIFS|5.0|Great film, cute, adventurous, creative, and one of a kind! If only there were a second film I would buy it in a heartbeat.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|1. Google cast does NOT work with iOS, so you cannot stream from google chrome to chromecast on an apple device.<br />2. Chromecast will not work through a VPN, so if you have a VPN connection on your laptop, chrome will not see the device.<br />3. Good luck connecting if you are running windows 7.<br /><br />Bottom line, you can watch youtube and Netflix, buy a roku or wait for them to get their act together. This is cheap and still a waste of money.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|It's an amazing and inspiring novel. It was actually really cool how he was on the same air craft carrier as my grand father. The Kitty Hawk.
B00ESY7QXI|5.0|I think this was a well done movie. Really enjoyed it. The &#34;rap scenes&#34; like so many people talked about didn't seem as bad considering all the bad rep they got. Still didn't necessarily like them or think they did full justice to the movie. But just saying I don't think it was as bad of an effect as everyone made it out to be. Great acting
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|Great high quality game. I reccommend it for the price. You basically propel a globe around and get bigger to eat bigger globes.
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|Pretty good. Had a lot of hype & def looked like it was gonna be way cooler. Not necessarily a let down - still a cool movie. Just not as epic as it seemed it would be. Tom Cruise is great as usual.
B00COCY67A|5.0|THIS IS ELVIS AT HIS BEST! I RECOMMEND TO ANYONE!  IT DOESN'T COMPARE AT TO HIS EARLY RECORDINGS.<br />LISTENING TO &#34;ELVIS AT STAX&#34;, YOU CAN HEAR ELVIS LAUGHING AND HAVING FUN AND ENJOYING WHAT HE IS DOING.  &#34;ELVIS AT STAX&#34; WAS THE YEAR I WAS BORN AND THIS IS THE ELVIS I REMEMBER. ALOT OF THESE SONGS ARE THE ORIGINAL SONGS I FIRST BECAME AN ELVIS FAN.  I DO NOT EVEN KNOW WHO ED SULLIVAN WAS AND I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW ELVIS MADE MOVIES UNTIL AFTER HE DIED.  &#34;ELVIS AT STAX&#34; MUSIC IS THE MUSIC THAT MADE ME SOLD ON ELVIS -- HE IS THE KING!  LISTEN FOR &#34;PLAY IT JAMES!&#34; -- THERE IS ALOT OF ELVIS AND JAMES BURTON TOGETHER IN &#34;ELVIS AT STAX&#34;.  ALL I CAN SAY FOR &#34;&#34;ELVIS AT STAX&#34; IS &#34;NO STOPPIN' KEEP IT ROCKIN'&#34;!
159463176X|4.0|The story-line of loss, betrayal and tragedy is typical Hosseini.  The book flows well although like many readers I found the sub-characters that got lost could have been developed more and losing them so cavalierly diminished the impact of the read.  Up to a point the read engulfed me but when I finally closed the book I felt somewhat let-down considering the expectations evoked by the earlier chapters.  The author however remains a consummate story-teller and the characters that he does develop fully continue to move readers' emotions.
B0013TXA5Y|2.0|Just tedious writing and very little excitement - enough of witches, werewolves etc.!!! I won't be reading any of the other books to see if it gets better. A waste of my precious reading time!!
B00E3BK0QQ|3.0|Kept my interest for one sitting but ended abruptly with an unfinished task. Not really worth the $4.99 it costs to play. For that price it should have more chapters.

B009XIXVU6|1.0|I had to force myself to finish this book for a book club I'm in, and the consensus was the same for everyone in my club. Too much jumping back and forth from decade to decade, and hard to follow. Thought maybe something great would happen to tie everything together, but it just never really happened. Pretty boring book for me.

B00EMJBVAI|3.0|The first half was a lot better than the last half. I wanted to know how it all started (becoming a zombie). I still don't know.<br /><br />The action was good, although creepy. I here there is talk of a sequel.
B005USZYDU|4.0|Good descriptive writing.  Wish there was a little more to the ending.  It is set up well to be a series.

B003YFIUW8|5.0|** spoiler alert **<br /><br />Loved this book! I found myself not wanting to put it down most of the time and read it pretty quickly. The only thing that should've been different in my eyes: when the author had them escape. The plan was a good one and she threw in twists during the escape to keep the readers on their toes, I expected Jack to get caught and have to go back in the Room. I started reading the book expecting they would eventually escape, but not so soon. After the escape I lost that \\"must turn the page\\" feeling... but still read on. :) Glad I grabbed this at the grocery store! Karns Foods.. who would've thought?! Lmao!
B00BWBHIUG|2.0|My child (and I) enjoyed this game up until a few days ago when the game was updated. The same video ad starts playing whenever you load the game or click on one of the several in-game links. We will be taking a break and will see if the game changes back, or at least have the video frequency scaled back.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|I thought the book was good, vividly describing details of Charlies life struggling with a cluster of mental illnesses. I don't remember his psychiatrist diagnosing him with any one particular illness but its clear that psychosis plays a role in his life, maybe even schizophrenia?<br />I was totally confused at the end of this book after Sam touched him and he referred to Aunt Helen. I actually had to google search the answers I was looking for, and my assumptions were right. So either there's a catch to the story that I missed, I missed some information in the dialogue or in the details, or the \\"surprise\\" ending was poorly written. Although Charlie's mind and thoughts are far from ordinary, maybe that was the authors way of incorporating his thoughts with the abuse he endured. Overall, good book (4 stars) and I cant wait to watch the movie. :)))
B009L6UDUG|4.0|Excellent installment in yet another action packed, James Bond, adventure movie, which Pierce Brosnon does a wonderful portrayal of the character.  It is well worth watching again and again.
B002PEP4C8|5.0|Love, love, LOVE Alice Sebold! I've also read \\"The Lovely Bones\\" which is still my favorite, however, this one isn't far behind. I'm not sure if this story was fictional or if this was something she actually went through in her life. It was based in the 80s, so it is possible. I liked how Alice went on to \\"find peace\\" in her life after the rape, and she was so strong throughout the court process, with her friends and family, and even authorities. She was honest, as well. I found it somewhat disturbing that she lost her virginity, or as she calls it her \\"real virginity\\" the way that she did- but that's the way the cookie crumbles nowadays. How often do you actually lose it to someone you really \\"love\\"?<br /><br />I admired her journey at the end of the story, the \\"Aftermath\\". Too often when you read books with similar plots it shows a successful and happy ending; fields of daisies, dancing in the rain, in love, happily ever after. That wasn't the case with Alice. She struggled, and she struggled more. It wasn't until she up and left her New Yorker life that she actually found herself. Too often we perceive ourselves as someone we aren't. She didn't view herself as \\"the victim\\" throughout this story, but rather the Survivor.<br /><br />This book is a sure recommendation for a rape victim. It DOES go into gruesome details of the rape which could potentially be hard for an actual victim to swallow, so beware if this applies to you. HOWEVER, it shows the positives after the rape case is put to rest. Offenders nowadays face much MUCH more time in jail/prison (generally) then what Gregory Mattison did, but that wasn't the point- the point was, justice was served. It's a cruel, dangerous, unfair world out there and predators are everywhere. Justice is served much less then it should be and abuse victims are too often \\"blown off\\". They aren't categorized by what they have endured, but by a statistic, just another victim.<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed this story and it definitely exceeds its 5 stars. :) Ahhhh, finally the book I've been looking for. I've read a bunch of boring and predictable stories lately- lol!
0547884591|2.0|I expected something to educate me on the culinary arts, instead I received an abstract on everything from not tying to how to avoid a bear attack. If you are looking for a gift to amuse, consider this work of gathering letters into words as a an off the wall/ out-of the box. Other wise, if you are desire-ring knowledge to supplement or enhance your culinary capabilities, then I strongly suggest you continue your search.
B0015DROBO|1.0|I only made it through the first 100-ish pages and had to put it down; I just couldn't do it any longer. WHY WHY WHY does this book have such great ratings? I was BOREDDD and unable to keep track of all of the useless information about the characters. The ONLY character that interested me in the least bit was Salander and even that is stretching it. Sure, sometimes it takes 50 pages for a long book to \\"kick off\\" but I'm reading dozens if reviews that say 'once you get past the first 250 pages, it gets better'. Ummmm, no thanks- I'll pass. I cant fathom reading for hours about nothinggggg, which is exactly what I felt with the past 100.<br /><br />Sorry GWTDT lovers, it wasnt for me. I was REALLY hoping it was, I was actually excited.<br />However, eventually I will be giving the movie a shot which I have been told, is worth the time.

B001KVZ6HK|1.0|I was expecting a masterpiece, but instead I simply got bored!  There is a very basic plot and very little character development.  With this cast of super heroes, it should have been magnificent.  It is not.  This film relies soley on the special effects, but it drags so badly, that even they are underwelming.  It was boring!
0307951154|5.0|The whole series is one of the most original crime stories so far. Great. But read them in the correct order. And do not forget number 10 POLICE
B00785P2QC|2.0|Too many ads all over the game makes it irritating to play. Definitely not as good as the original game.
B00EY8A6BC|1.0|The premise of 'Now You See Me' is strong: a gang of potentially intriguing characters set against the backdrop of large-scale illusions and a heists or two.  Combine that with a strong cast of actors and one's hopes begin to soar.  However, lower your expectations dramatically before seeing this film because none of it succeeds.<br /><br />The illusions - which are arguably the heart of the movie - are flat and lifeless thanks to an almost complete dependency on CGI.  It's as if the director is saying: HERE! LOOK! This is an amazing trick! It's so amazing it's practically unbelievable! ...Oh, but it is unbelievable because we've executed it with computers. Multiply that disappointment by virtually every single gag and trick in the film - of which there are many -- and we're left with a totally lifeless series of stunts that are presented as if they're the greatest thing on earth.<br /><br />The completely incomprehensible and undeveloped \\"conclusion\\" of the film is astonishingly poor.  The movie not so much concludes as it ceases to stop trying to carry on.  I can't relay to you what the point of this film is meant to be; it doesn't have a point.  It merely exists, and that's not enough.<br /><br />Seemingly some good pieces are present to forge an energetic and mysterious heist flick (Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine for starters), but astonishingly few of those pieces have been placed properly.  A waste of potential as depressing as anything I've seen in a long time.<br /><br />Extremely bad.

B002WV5A9G|5.0|This is a &#34;must have&#34; for all SCI-Fi movie lovers.  Captain Kirk as a young officer living in his father's shadow.  Excellent movie non stop drama.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Sometimes a bit difficult to follow the characters.  Plot was well executed.  Enough character development to make you care about them.  The insight was baldly laid out for you at t h e end.  No beautiful language but nicely connected to Pandoras box story.  No happy ever after fairy tale.  Realistic p resentaton of relationships.  A good read.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|The book was an honest account of the experiences of a very elite group of personnel doing jobs that are way below the radar for most Americans.<br />It was well written and not a &#34;look what I've done&#34; essay although any of these guys are certainly eligible to say that.

B00EVCD9HY|3.0|it's a  solid album. nice mixture of up tempo dance songs and slow ballads.  a few of the songs sound very similar and the melodies are hard to find on other songs. she is eclectic in her sound with electronic synthesizer elements and that is always a good thing but more symphony instrumentation a long with some other song writers would have made this album really special. arch android is a better album but this one is fun.
B006DJ2JSI|4.0|Hard to say more than it is a good dictionary.  It is easy to use and a good addition to the built in kindle reader dictionary.  Where it is handy is as an app so you don't need to be in a book to look up a word.  It provides the definition and a simple use of the word.  Nothing fancy but helpful to have on any device.
B00C1N9JWO|5.0|I've enjoyed all the books in the Psy/Changeling series, and I love how Ms. Singh gives you updates on characters from previous books as the series progresses.  That being said...When I heard that this book was about Kaleb I was less than enthusiastic...and then I couldn't put it down. I've read it three times now, it was that good! The emotion that absolutely resonates through him is palpable. Your heart will ache for the boy, and then for the man, who finally has someone who is waiting for him, to whom he can belong.  Somehow Ms Singh has kept ruthless, cold, Silent Kaleb Krychek true to his character, and while he is still all those things, he is More. He is almost evolving,as evidenced by his actions at the end of the book. If you are reading this, Ms Singh, PLEASE give us more Kaleb/Sahara in future books, let us glimpse their life together! And please, may we have a baby Krychek?
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Free Flow is a simple game of logic, connecting dots and filling in a grid in as few moves as possible.  The games offers easy puzzles for young kids up to pretty difficult ones, even for master chess players.  The grids are 5 x 5 up to 9 x 9 (as far as I've been able to get).  It helps develop logic for the smaller kids and wracks your brain for us older kids.  Each grid size has 150 puzzles and it keeps track of which ones you've completed.<br /><br />You can play for hours or for just a few minutes.  My young kids love it so much, I have it on 2 Kindles and my phone.  If you are sitting at an airport or train station, it's a great way to keep the kids occupied!  Enjoy.
140006922X|1.0|\\"Zealot\\" was my book club's choice this month so I had to buy and read  this book.  This book might better be described as the history of  Jerusalem and the Roman Empire. The first half of the book describes the conflict with these two parties.  He doesn't even get to Jesus until the second half of the book.  His time line and references jump back and forth. I'm sorry to say but the author's tone was anti-semetic.  Especially describing the Temple and its activities.  He leads you to believe that Jesus was an illiterate man who was just one of MANY men claiming to be the Messiah.  It was the Gospel writers who created the myth of Jesus.  To his credit it does have a lot of historical references to the Roman influence.  If you are trying to renew your faith in Jesus, then this book will not do it.  If you are looking for support that Jesus was just another man trying to make a name for himself, then buy all means buy this book and you will not be disappointed.  It was NOT a pleasant NOR enjoyable read.

B00B1GT9L8|4.0|This Lego carrier works well.  It is fairly large and has a bridge that is velcroed on that can be detached.  It is detached when you fill it and stored in the bottom of the case.  I bought it for my grandson mostly for a carry case, not sure he uses the play mat part of it that much but he thought it looked cool.
B004HWYTP4|4.0|I watched the movie with my son and we both enjoyed the action and the various actors whom we recognized in it.
B003YFIUW8|5.0|I have seen this book for several years, and always chosen NOT to read it.  It just sounded too catchy and un-doable: a story told from the point of view of a young boy with no experience of the world other than the single room he lived in, captive---daunting task! Who could make it credible and engaging instead of just weird or shocking? Where would a child learn language--never mind develop the skill to tell a story and not step out of character?<br /><br />But then I read a number of other works by Emma Donoghue, and she is capable of telling strange stories through improbable narrators, and of using difficult voices--if anyone could manage the challenge this book sets forth, it would be she.  So I gave it a try.<br /><br />I'm glad I didn't pass it by!<br /><br />It was a touching psychological drama, and I was definitely kept turning pages: what next?  But lots of books do that; this one does more: it offers the reader the chance to see and feel and experience ordinary events (even objects) in a way surprisingly different but fully credible (and even in some distant, forgotten reality, familiar).  Yes, you come to care about the boy and his mother, and to have infinite admiration for a mother who gave her child so much from so little, and so much joy and pleasure despite the situation she knew as imprisonment but he knew as world.  What kind of woman is this, who can set aside her own loss in order to be sure her child suffers the least possible in a terrible situation?  Yes--all good mothers do that--but this mother sustained it for years in what most would have found an unbearable condition, and I suspect never let on to her child how she suffered!<br /><br />I won't say how the story ends. Despite a few decisions and events that stretched my credibility (in ways this basically INcredible story didn't!), over all 'how things came out' was more than satisfying.  Thank goodness, when the mother has a failure of confidence when asked whether it might not have been better had she aborted this child--thank goodness the reality won out over the speculation, and she failed to 'make amends'!<br /><br />What was really a treasure was that through the eyes of trust and innocence nurtured by a mother's decision to nurture those qualities in her child instead of the more usually predictable reactions to their situation (resentment, frustration, desperation, hatred) we were shown a world that, who knows, might grow, if more people have the GOOD fortune this boy had.

B00B52FDXQ|5.0|This entire season was very well done. Liam was fantastic - he became Spartacus! I commend the writers for ending this story with style and dignity. I shed lots of tears for the characters I came to love. I especially liked the end and the tribute to all the actors who starred in each season. Doubt that anyone can top this series for a long time if ever!
B003G4W49C|5.0|Great book, picked it up after I saw the movie trailer and couldn't put it down. The hero isn't a heartless man who commits genocide just to save his species love the ending.
B0072OFOM6|4.0|It took awhile to adjust to Liam McIntire as Spartacus. I liked the advancement of the storyline overall. Some very good acting - characters that you love to hate. I find Navea tiresome and wish they had not devoted so many episodes to her story.<br />I find this telling of the story of Spartacus very compelling and recommend customers watch the entire series.

B00DJFIMW6|4.0|While I have only played this game for a short time.  The graphics are movie quality.  The game changes as you go as well so it is not at all repeatative. Only guff would be to have gru coins a little easier to get.
0345529057|5.0|The books were chosen for a gift to someone that enjoys this subject matter....after receiving it, he  exclaimed 'I always wanted to read them but I could not remember the Author or titles...imagine my happy surprise when you sent them to me. Thank you'...my other grandson saw the collection on the table and he too had a story...he does not watch TV, but someone gave him a DVD and said 'You've got to watch this'. He did, and sat down and spent the whole day and evening watching the HBO series on a DVD. 'I just loved it and could see more of it'.  Winner, winner all around for my twenty-plus grandkids....
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Bought  the book for my thirteen year old daughter and decided to read it also. We both enjoyed it. It was well written and kept both of our interests.  I liked the way that future events were told in earlier parts of the book but, it did not spoil the outcome.

B00EVCD9HY|5.0|I have been straight fiend for this album since I heard that it was being recorded earlier this year.  A little underwhelmed by the first single, &#34;Q.U.E.E.N.&#34;, mostly because I could see that it tied into the larger picture of the parent album, so I decided not to judge it too harshly, especially once &#34;Dance Apocalyptic&#34; surfaced, video and all, wowing all my ladyparts!<br /><br />The album itself, on the whole, is the best thing she's done since Metropolis Suite I : The Chase, in that it works from beginning to end, makes you want more.<br /><br />I adore The ArchAndroid, and on a song-to-song level, it may be the stronger collection, but all that Janelle has wanted for Cindy Mayweather feels twenty times more believable this time around, not to mention that this is THE most reigned-in her collaborators have ever appeared in cameo form.  Not just the Prince moments, though that sets the standard: song first, guest star second.  I love it.  By the time Queen Esperanza Spalding appears for &#34;Dorothy Dandridge Eyes&#34;, I feel like I've been wooed by the best in the business without even knowing they were there.<br /><br />Props to the Wondaland Orchestra for being all they can be and more - the performances are earthier this time, and even when the influences are obvious (sometimes Outkast, sometimes Stevie Wonder, sometimes both at once), the band sounds like they are the first to discover the notes they're using.<br /><br />I'm already putting this in my top three albums for 2013.  Maybe at the very top.  Maybe.  It's been such an excellent year for music, it's really hard to say.<br /><br />This should be required listening for all composers and all outsiders!<br /><br />Runteldat!
B000TGCR4C|5.0|This is the first video that I have seen in a very long time that held the drama and suspense of a great production. I completely agree with this positive responses of the other reviewers. A really fine display of the talent of the Dutch team. I look forward to more productions like this.
B006VREHRS|5.0|Great series but it is not for the faint hearted. The scenery and costumes are amazing. If you enjoy drama, suspense and history this show has them all wrapped up into one.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|This historical analysis of the life and times of Jesus is fascinating and serves only to expand your perspective. Well done.
B00DPH7QFM|5.0|I originally bought this DVD because it was listed as a PAL version from the german amazon site. This has since been updated to NTSC. So I assume there is no PAL version at all. I wish the different site would indicate correctly in future. Back to this DVD, I am happy with the picture quality and the music quality has been upgraded to 5.1 surround sound. I made comparison to the bootleg that has been around since day one. Ritchie's playing and Doogie's vocal were incredible good and without dubbing, this is a fantastic dvd. To Rainbow fans, this is a follow-up to \\"Stranger In Us All\\".
B00821OX98|5.0|Watching them in rapid succession, its hard not to get the feeling that you're watching a decent sci-fi movie - one along the lines of the many other humans vs aliens genre - with great plot twists, plausible situations and a focus on the human drama of it all and not on the action.  Well done!
B004TI5N38|4.0|Exciting book but could have been more together.  Seemed a little off to me. Probably could have had better editing.  Also a lot of mistakes in the Kindle version
B00ESY7QXI|3.0|...but succeeded only in underwhelming. DiCaprio deserved better from the director. If the intent was to dazzle, they succeeded. All it cost them was a too large outlay of story.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|This book is  one great book and I want to thank Mark Lutrell for writing it and opening our eyes regarding the danger of Navy Seal Missions.  He goes into detail as much as he can to explain what it takes to be a Navy Seal which totally enlightened me.  I knew they had extensive education and training but never did I expect to read about Hell Week or the stages of training they go through.  As a result it gave me more appreciation and respect for them and their elite brotherhood.  I highly recommend everyone read this book.  It will definitely open your eyes as to what could happen on a mission when a judgment call is wrong.
B000JCSBU0|5.0|That's what I would give this cinematic study of self-induced agony from drug use. The actors succeed mightily in giving the characters painful depth. Jennifer Connelly is an amazing actress but particularly so here. Burstyn pushed her role to the limit.
B005CRQ3UC|5.0|Wonderful book for children!  A classic that should be in every child's library!<br /> Every new parent should have this book.
B00DSTBMMU|4.0|So glad she is back!  Although I am not a true fan of country music, this album appeals to my small town, country background. The way the ballads have a slight Cheryl 'rock' is right on!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Great!  Lived up to my expectations and couldn't wait for next season. I love that I can now watch on Amazon.
B000URWYTS|2.0|I might have enjoyed this book more if there had been even one sympathetic character. The two main characters are especially arrogant and self-serving. The books was alternately  mildly interesting and downright boring.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|This is a game the kids begged me to get because the other kids at school were raving about it.  I reluctantly agreed.  However, I was pleasantly surprised.  It is fun for both children and adults.  Not only is it fun, but it is also educational.  The game requires them to problem solve and use their vocabulary (spelling).  My only negative comment is that I found several levels almost impossible to solve.  For example, the creators of the game have their ideas concerning what is spooky and I had other ones.  I had to go on-line a few times for help get through some levels.

B008AWBQIU|5.0|Never been into Slipknot and I happen to catch a couple of live shows online and thought I would take a closer look at their songs.  They are really a great band and Cory can actually sing and not just your average thrash screamer.  I am 46 years old and can not believe I have started listening to Slipknot.  I guess your never to old :)<br /><br />What really reeled me in was Duality.  I then found Snuff, what a great freaking song.  Then, Before I forget, People = Shit, and Dead Memories.  Didn't take long before I decided there was not a bad song on this Greatest Hits collection from Slipknot.  They seem like such a strong band and seem to give it ALL in their live performances.  I hope they put out some new material soon and support it with a big US tour.<br /><br />What sets Slipknot apart is what each of 0-8 brings to the band.  On the surface they are your usual heavy guitar, bass, drum band.  But, the deeper you go sonicly into their music you start to hear the keyboards that really fill out their sound not to mention the DJ cuts and samples that also help fill out their sound.  You gotta love the sound of a baseball bat up against a keg rather than a snare.  The marching snares and deep toms also round out their very unique sound.  I think without all 9 they would be a very different band.<br /><br />These guys are a true finger in the eye of the man type band and do a great job vocalizing the frustration and contempt of the average for the establishment.  They also seem none to pleased with organized religion.<br /><br />Can't wait to see what they do next.

055277832X|5.0|I had watched the film with my daughters, and wanted to encourage them to read some more. I recommended the book to them and then read it myself.<br /><br />The author has a delightful way of allowing you to engage with the main character in a way that allows you to feel the emotions that she must be feeling. The internal monologues were terrific.<br /><br />The happy ending is rather obvious and overly signposted with fairly clunky romantic plot developments, but nevertheless you put the book down with a feelgood factor.

B00DFRVAC2|4.0|I'm a sucker for buzzing guitars and abusive horn blasts. Also, giant monsters fighting giant robots.<br />Some of my favorite tracks are &#34;Call me Newt&#34; for it's pleasingly funky guitar riff and &#34;Go Big or Go Extinct&#34;, which captures the in-your-face ass-kicking that is endemic to the whole affair. Of course, the titular &#34;Pacific Rim&#34; reminds one why they bothered to sit down in that movie theater in the first place with that balance of Rocky Balboa patriotism, sizzlingly simple and catchy guitar riffs, and a healthy dose of war drums.<br /><br />While it could probably be arranged better to work as a whole, and it can get overly simple and ponderous at times, you are getting 25 tracks for your money. They don't hold much back and there is something in there for every mood.<br /><br />Just buy it.

B00BEIYOHC|3.0|The horror genre is currently in a state of heightened popularity - and one of the men responsible is James Wan.  For those that don't know his name, he is one of the creators and directors of the horror saga, Saw - which introduced the Jigsaw killer, a mysterious vigilante that tested the will of his victims through various methods of torture.  While the Saw franchise wasn't exactly a critic's delight, the series went on to become the highest grossing horror film franchise of all-time.  After exiting the Saw franchise, Wan went on to direct two more popular horror flicks - Insidious in 2011 and The Conjuring in the summer of 2013.  With the massive success of Insidious (grossing nearly $100 million on a measly budget of $1.5 million), a sequel was quickly predicted, which is also written and directed by Wan - titled Insidious: Chapter 2.<br /><br />The horror sequel, Insidious: Chapter 2, picks up right where its predecessor left off - focusing on Josh Lambert (Patrick Wilson), his wife, Renai (Rose Bryne), and their son, Dalton (Ty Simpkins).  Just when they get their son back and assume their lives can return to normalcy, Renai and her mother-in-law, Lorraine (Barbara Hershey), continue to see ghosts in their home.  With the death of Elise (Lin Shaye) and Josh acting peculiar, the family enlists the help of Carl (Steve Coulter), a former friend of Elise that attempts to discover the identity of the ghosts and also who is responsible for her murder.  Leigh Whannell, Angus Sampons, and Jocelin Donahue also star in supporting roles.<br /><br />The Insidious films are just two films on an ever-growing list of horror flicks that stick to the generic, yet oddly popular supernatural haunted house gimmick.  It would appear the days of the slasher killer have gone by the wayside (a trend that will no doubt return with full force one day), giving way to stories about families living in houses with creaky doors, uninvited ghosts, and children with bad dreams.  You'd think this style of storytelling would have grown tiresome long, long ago, but the majority of the modern horror genre heavily resembles films similar to Insidious.  Even James Wan's previous endeavor, The Conjuring, deals with supernatural ghouls invading the home of an innocent family.  And, although these films all resemble one another - they work.  The stories are interesting, creepy, and have propelled the horror genre to unimaginable, unpredictable heights - a trend that will continue with the success of Insidious: Chapter 2.<br /><br />We all know that sequels carry more criticism than the originals, due to their long history of being inferior in comparison.  Sure, we can always find a few exceptions to the rule, but more often than not - sequels simply act as desperate attempts to cash in on a massive wave of success.  This Insidious sequel is guilty of being both inferior to its predecessor and riding the wave of success.  However, this film needed to be made and that's saying something that doesn't usually need to be said about most sequels.  Insidious: Chapter 2 is a must see for anyone that enjoyed the first film, mostly because it does a better job of telling a meaningful story.  The first film, for all its successes, lacked closure for characters that were undeniably enjoyable.  Thankfully, this second film wraps up the story of the Lambert family with a big red ribbon, and even makes plans for the future of the franchise.<br /><br />This is one of those reviews where even the simplest comment can give away big pieces of the story, so there's no need to go into too much detail other than to say Josh is definitely possessed - which was made abundantly clear at the end of the first film.  From there, this story explains who the ghosts are that continuously haunt the family in their waking hours and in their dreams.  And, even though the story gets a little too carried away with itself as the major plot secrets are revealed, it all works out very well in the end.  This story incorporates a weird time travel element that really makes absolutely no sense, but the way in which it's used is cleverly constructed - thus making a fully explained story out of both films, which now act as one complete circle of events.  James Wan even goes the full length to show reconstructed scenes from the first film that was left unexplained, like the scene where Josh hears a knock at the front door, which will clearly explain what was mysteriously setting off the home security system.<br /><br />While the child, Dalton, was the center of attention in the first film, the father - Josh, is now the central character that's in need of rescuing.  This is exciting news for fans of Patrick Wilson, who absolutely shines in this role of protagonist and antagonist.  There's a certain mysterious attraction to his style that makes him a pleasant addition to horror flicks - which he's been thriving in after starring in Insidious, The Conjuring, and now Insidious: Chapter 2.  However, if the story follows the course laid out in the closing moments of this film, it would appear Wilson may be done with the Insidious franchise, which will undoubtedly spawn at least one more sequel - and likely even more than that.  Still, it might in fact be the supporting cast, which includes Saw and Insidious co-creator Leigh Whannell, that (minor spoiler) carries this franchise into the second sequel.<br /><br />Overall, Insidious is nothing more than an average addition to the horror genre.  It's certainly not the scariest movie you'll ever see, and definitely not as scary as the first film, but it manages to fulfill its duty of making people squirm in their seats every few minutes.  The bottom line here is that this particular film will have more significance to the fans of the first film - since it picks up right where that story lives off.  While the first flick could have stood on its own merit, this sequel serves as a prequel and sequel all in one, providing origin stories for several characters, all while progressing the overall vastness of the Insidious experience.  The film can be overzealous at times, but in the end, it all works itself out in a way that will appease horror fans and also create a moderate amount of buzz for the next sequel.  Much like the Saw franchise, it would appear that this franchise will carry on, only with a new set of victims set to replace the Lambert family (and no that doesn't necessarily mean they die).<br /><br />GRADE:  C+<br />FNDNreview.com.  This story incorporates a weird time travel element that really makes absolutely no sense, but the way in which it's used is cleverly constructed - thus making a fully explained story out of both films, which now act as one complete circle of events.

B00AN0KBJC|5.0|one of the best series ever...can't wait to see Season 3 and impatiently await it's release.  Season 1 and 2 great.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I loved every minute of it and watching it on Amazon Prime is so convenient!! I can't wait for season 4!!!
B0076DELIG|4.0|Connelly continue to keep the reader guessing as to what comes next.  I always enjoy his books and the twists and turns that Bosch has to go to solve the case.
B007EECSFA|5.0|Excellent story. A real page turner and one that keeps you guessing right until the very end. Kate Morton at her very best.
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|Nice story, though a bit orutine as scifi post disater movies go. I would have like a little more action, and suspense,but the flying machines were very cool.
B009NY43NY|3.0|These books started off so exciting.  Sookie's voice always stayed true, but i was a bit disappointed in how it ended.
B00B6U63ZE|4.0|Lots of examples in this book were very close to instances I remember seeing in the workplace when managers were in transition.  Now I understand how some did well and others did not....
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|I'v really enjoyed this game!! It provides kids of challenges and variations as u come was level. Lloyds of fun f ttwists n turns n relaxing past time for me. My one complaint is the many times a day I'm just gettin into the board n my energy runs out n I'm forced either to wait for it to recharge or buy a more energy. Besides that one of the best \\"hidden object\\" games I've played n a long time!!!!
B00AQ71FLK|5.0|One of the best mobile games I've played. Game mechanics are balanced and the servers are mostly stable. Best portable MOBA there is and well made too
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|I regard the book as a must read by all who believes in or professes Christian religions.This because of the very new vantage point the author uses (at least for me and fellow Christians, Espiritualists, Protestants I know), which is to focus in Jesus's early life and ministry. The coverage on his family is also very interesting.I must confess that, after turning fifty, I had never heard of James the Just.One can only wonder about his stature and influence.<br />Those who are strong believers will have difficult times accepting the author's cold logic and sometimes blatant attacks on the Faith.<br />I have put on my wish list Mr Azlan's book on Islam.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|You have to get this game! Hidden puzzles, mystery and collecting. I wasn't to sure about it at first but 2 minutes later I was hooked. As far as I can see it is going to have massive updates so you can play and play and play. Power ups are great , things are not the same in return scenes so your not doing the same over and over. Give it a try I guarantee you will love it!
B00867GHS8|4.0|was good for the price. i have already seen the movie so i haven't watched it again yet but am sure to enjoy it in the future
B0036S4B6M|5.0|I bought the book after watching the Netflix series. Completely worth it! You get more back story into the lives of the characters. The show is great but because of the book I'm now even more curious how the next season plays out.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I would ALWAYS rate 0 this one is like cool! I am a kid rating this I know it says not to be rated under 13 I keen really? How bad can it be loo I don't know what's wrong with my kindle. So sorry if my spelling goes wrong and it was apostle to be laugh out loud not lop or loo I don't know what wrong! Oh well atleast you know what I mean and try this game it. can only be on laptop or computer... its called animal jam my User is SHAREOIN omg so try that. tell me how you like it. Its gelreat remember I am ankid ratingnthis I'm under 13 so see if your kid likes it. my age 9 :)
B008XCM18Q|5.0|This is a great mystery suspense book that I recommend my 15 year old son to read and he loves it!
B000RZIGVS|5.0|i mean come on it's star trek whats not to like. now i need 9 more words to finish this
1401942601|5.0|Beautifully designed and great insights!  They are very easy to use and I find my reading extremely accurate!  Nicely Done!
B00005QDW5|5.0|Excellent, especially if you are a PF fan. Both CDs are great with all best hits, Shine On Crazy Diamond, The Wall.  Highly recommend.
B005AKFXZW|4.0|The writing evokes the wonderfully visual world of the unique and enchanting circus, and the intriguing cast at the centre of a long standing duel.
B00CUKTGW6|5.0|I know that is what a bunch of you are thinking.  I, too, was skeptical. If it weren't for a horrible accident with my a couple of my old Clash CDs and a good deal, I probably would have passed on this.  The first thing you will notice is that it is loud.  Really loud.  I had to turn my system down to 2 1/2 to not have my ears rupture.  The second thing you will notice is the clarity.  If a pin had dropped during the recording session, you would hear it on this set. The nuances of Strummer's vocals are really brought out here.<br />There are drum bits, guitar parts, vocals that I have never heard before, especially on Sandinista! and Combat Rock.  This actually rates a \\"must buy\\" for any Clash fan, unless you bought that gigantic thing i can not justify buying.
B000FCKGPC|4.0|I would have liked to have had a few short chapters updating the IMP, Jon Snow and Danny and more details about Cat's survival from the Red Wedding.
B00EEDJM2Q|5.0|This game is colorful, fun and as easy or challenging as you want.  A great first game for people just starting a collection.
B00DDXJRJG|1.0|The only thing that works on this for me is the volume slider. Galaxy S4. Sorry five more words. Really?
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|The Merriam Dictionary is a very useful tool when you have the kindle book app. I use it often when I read my kindle books!
B001N9ESQ4|5.0|People usually either love or hate this series of three movies about a couple in their early 20's (Before Sunrise), early 30's (Before Sunset) and the newest one, Before Midnight (early 40's). I've heard that many people find them boring, tedious and of course, most of all, TALKY. Well, it's true they are talky in the sense that the dialogue does nothing to advance the plot --- there really is no plot. But if you love to hear really creative, interesting conversations that sound like genuine conversations between two people, this is for you. The more I watch this series (yes, I've watched the first two several times), the more I like it. Delphy and Hawke have grown on me, and I want to know how they're working through the stuff of their lives. Before Sunset, the shortest of the three, is almost heart-thumping at times, despite the lack of plot. Two people who made an amazing connection meet again after 10 years to resolve past hurts and doubts and to remember and re-experience the great love of their lives, all within the constraints of an afternoon. And in Paris, no less! This is the one that got me hooked on this series.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|I had been seeing Slammed around everywhere, popping up in news feeds and on Facebook with everyone talking about how great it was, so I finally decided I just had to read it.  I'm so glad I did.  From the book description given you just think it is another boy/girl love story...and it is, but it is also so much more.  The actual storyline itself was fantastic and believable.  It was emotional and heartbreaking and at the same time fun and sweet.<br /><br />Lake moved with her mom and brother to a new town and a new school.  They get moved in and meet their awesome new neighbor, a.k.a. Will.  Lake and Will hit it off right away.  I love the two of them together.  They were so much fun even when the circumstances of their lives seem hopeless.  Both of them have had a hard past couple of years and are struggling to move forward.  Though they will find that moving forward is not always easy.<br /><br />Even though I am not a poetry fan, I love, love, love the slams.  I had heard of slams before but never really knew much about them.  They were a lot of fun, and the author incorporated them in such a way that they became part of the story rather than just something the characters were doing.<br /><br />I have to admit this review is a tad late (or maybe more than a tad), as I read this book a few months ago and am just now getting around to writing this review.  I have also read Point of Retreat and will be writing that review next.  I absolutely love this series and am now a huge fan of Colleen Hoover.
0807014273|5.0|Without meaning, where are you?  He explains where, how to get meaning in numerous situations.  He found meaning while being persecuted in Nazi concentration camps.  Now that's doing something!  And he was able to give meaning to the lives of fellow prisoners so they could endure also.  I feel it will enhance your meaning as well.
B00CTSDDVO|5.0|This movie went beyond my expectations.  It had all the action, drama, and suspense I could handle.  I would by this 2x over.  I can not wait for the next one.
B0042J6VUS|4.0|I do not know what I was expecting but I am pleased with the purchase. Not only can I use the tripod to take a pictures but I can also use it to hold my phone to watch movies.
B0081336FO|5.0|The show seller! Acting to notch! A must watch! If you are looking for a show that will have frozen in place this is it!
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Was an amazing story! How anyone could say it was not authentic, is beyond me! I would recommend this book to anyone!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I'd heard of John Green before, and heard that he'd written this book, and also had a YouTube channel. So I subscribed to his channel and bought the book. Not only does he have a great sense of humour, but he's one of the best authors I've ever had the privilege of reading the works of. John Green is a brilliant, and hilarious man.
B008PNBU30|5.0|This is an excellent CD. Three Days Grace knows how to rock!!!! It's their best album yet.  I highly recommend it
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|I seen the movie a billion time, I always find something I missed lol. Can't wait to watch it again.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|current version of this app crashes while looking at photos on the Kindle Fire HD 2nd gen. if you open up/click on a photo, you cannot leave the photo set without shutting down the device. the back button doesn't work and there are no other options to leave the app/photo without shutting the device off and restarting.
B00DC7N9NS|4.0|Spectacular-- sorry I missed it in theaters-- and more complicated than I expected. Both my daughters (tweens) and I enjoyed it for different reasons.
B004LROUNG|3.0|it was good but it was a Grisham book, a little predictable, it didn't keep me all that interested but it was fast reading.
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|It works on my Nexus 7. I can open a lot of documents and change them as well. Great product
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|The book, while a slow read, gives a much clearer view of who Jesus was. It shows the brutal times in which he lived, the influences on this illiterate preacher, and his surprising achievements. It should be read by any Christian so they can understand their religion. The distortions made by churches distort him completely with a mixture of lies, hopeful inventions, and excuses for their own wishes or excuses for their behavior. Concepts like the virgin birth, original sin, and the illusion that the Pope speaks without error when he speaks as Pope are distortions of man, not the important teachings of Jesus. The person who is interested in the influences on the early cultures that influenced Jewish, Christian, and Muslim religions should also read at least the non-fiction works Jezebel, the Red Queen, Sex at Dawn besides the Bible.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I loved it! It was an easy read and couldn't put it down. The 2 main characters really clicked with each other.
B004GJYRKA|4.0|This movie is a classic and I enjoyed watching it again.  Bruce Lee was so talented and its a shame he was not with us longer.
B00EOO55GW|4.0|Some of their best music so far. Key word being SOME. Not my favorite album by a7x but still good
B004W2UBYW|5.0|I can't stop finding anecdotes and I can't stop trying to express my own ideas to people via stories from this very unique book... Now for a second read....
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a amazing game, people on my bus play it all time. I am so glad I truer this game. I would say it is even tuner than temple run. My favortie person is Lucy. This is the best game ever!
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|IT is nice to be able to broadcast youtube videos easily to the TV.<br />As for as using it for networks, really the only thing that it will broadcast is Netflix  - we look at that a lot, so works for us. But you will not get any of the other major systems like HBO, or Showtime.  Probably will come on later.<br />It's pretty easy to set up, but so is a Roku, Apple TV.  If Netflix is the only service you have, this is a good deal.
B00EB6F1TY|4.0|Iron Man 3 was awesome best movie ever Robert Downey Jr is an awesome job.  Can't wait for the next Iron Man or the Avengers.
0307716988|3.0|Overlooking this book, the career of MJ was certainly interesting.  I was hoping for more personal insight on the man.
B000EK8SGE|2.0|Not as good music as I had expected. Some parts were kind of annoying. There is much better music out there.
B009GIPDQS|3.0|I have read many of Grisham's books, but found this one not up to the same quality..  However,moved quite well
1609611543|5.0|Lots of great information. I had no idea! I am enjoying the benefits of following the advice given. Am feeling better already!
B008RA3X5E|5.0|love it.  my kids like it.  it doesn't scare the crept out of us like a regular alarm does.  I would recommend it yo everyone.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is the best i love to play it be sure to buy it it is worth every cent
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|This is an exceptionally well done series. Interesting story development and cast make this a must watch for me each week.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|its soooooo addicting you need to download it im in love yah its like temple run but tjis has cuter graphics
B005LQ6UE8|5.0|Unbelievable what a human can do and survive, horrible what humans will do to each other. This was a true story and an amazing journey. There are no good wars,
B0063M22QO|5.0|Just started playing this and I like the way each puzzle builds on the difficulty. The tile designs are eye pleasing and well defined.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|Even though this novel does not focus on many of the main characters from the last book it is interesting and moves the story on. I think it is brilliant the author focused on the other half with this book as it provided a realistic perspective on how one side truly does not know what is happening with other.
B003WUYRGI|5.0|I Michelle like this book because it is<br /><br />  VERY.<br />  VERY<br />  VERY.<br />  VERY<br />VERY useful  and I mean VERY VERY useful serially VERY useful and helpful SO helpful
B00AZMFJYA|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed the latest edition to the series.  Became a SF buff in high school and try to watch about anything that portrays itself as SF.  Not a lot of good SF out there but Star Trek always comes thru.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|I , Michelle, Like this book because it helps you when you need to know a word. It also gives you the definition of the word you need. Like let's say you need to do a vocabulary paper, you would use the book for your vocabulary paper and you can get an A+ possibly, or if you need to know how to spell a word. Or maybe you need to do an extra credit paper that gives you a list of words and you need to write the definition of the words,  the hunger games will not be able to help you, but the dictionary will.
B00EI6E17A|5.0|love this jam! im not a big lady gaga fan, but this song is great! even my kids love it
B0052TDGQO|5.0|Have liked Scotty from day one on the American Idol Show... I knew from day 1 that he would make it to the top.... or at least I had hoped that he would make it and he did... Love the CD... he will go far !
B00AC8ZIXO|3.0|It was interesting to watch and will watch other ones in the future. To me it was drawn out a little too long.
B005BRS8Z6|5.0|You must read for yourself to define its meaning for you. It's definitely a book I will keep for life!
B0026QC0YU|4.0|Had watched this movie when it was originally released and refreshing my memory by watching it recently was a real positive.
B000UZNRS2|5.0|A wonderful book showing just how corrupt and dishonest our government officials really are. Balducci's  depiction of Washington elites is probably truer than we know. Too bad it is fiction!
B00DJYJPLO|1.0|I love the first two Before films and own both on Dvd,after the abrupt ending of Before Sunset i looked forward to finding out what happens to Celine & Jesse and when i finally did it was very bad.In my opinion this film has none of the elements that made the first two so good and as an overall film it is just depressing (I think a better story for the third film would have been for Celine and Jesse to finally become a couple) but instead it skips ahead to them being in a relationship & having a pair of twin daughters and Jesse feeling guilt for not being able to be the kind of father he would like to be to his son (Who he rarely see's due to him living in the United States while Jesse and Celine live in Paris) and all of the bickering between him and Celine who became a real ball busting bitch,she tears him down every chance she gets in this film,when all he is trying to do is figure out a way to be more involved in his sons life,to be a better father to him,she accuses him of infidelity,she criticizes the way he makes love,she tells him that she doesn't think she is in love with him anymore and what is even worse is that after all of the hateful nasty things she says to him Jesse degrades himself in trying to please her...In ending i will say that this is just a bad film (I don't understand how it received good reviews from the critics or from other reviewers on Amazon)..I hope that this is the final film in the Before series because it ruined what was a Beautiful love story.
B00E8TVHBA|2.0|I rented this for my grandchildren.  They loved it.  Me?  Let me say that I found it excruciating.  They took Beach Blanket Bingo and Pleasantville and made a joke.
B007CDGAQQ|5.0|The person who received the game said, &#34;One of the perfect games if you love Medieval genre.  Just don't forget to install mods. :)&#34;
B00821OX98|1.0|Watched the first two shows and then wanted 3hours of my life back.  A lot of nothing happened. My guess is small budget
B00A0R02HO|2.0|Total Recall starts off strong with good action , but that action continues, and continues and continues. Eventually I realized that I didn't care what happened to any of the characters.  The only character that seemed to show emotion was the relentless  agent who reminded me of \\"Le Mis\\" inspector Joubert..
B0031Y4ALC|5.0|Brought me right back to college....which is exactly why I bought it the best Cure album ever....the 180 gram format is incredible!  Highly recommended!
B00F35BV64|5.0|Better than expected. I'll probably watch it again and eventually own it on DVD.<br />If you like Star Trek then you should watch it.
B00DP8XSQ2|5.0|My granddaughter & daughter in law have it on their electronic stuff. I haven't been able to get mine working yet but hopefully we will be able to figure it out soon.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|This really was a good movie.  Good action, suspense and drama.  Some romance too, though that's not my thing.  Plot is unconventional but imaginative.  Don't be put off by the first 15 minutes or so.  I first thought the movie was too weird but then I really got into it.  No sex and little or no profanity.  Some violence but not overly graphic.  This movie is a sleeper--an unexpected gem of good entertainment.
B008FRFN7A|1.0|This wasn't what I wanted. I don't want to print via any \\"cloud\\". I want to print directly to my wireless printer thru my wifi. Why do I have to pay over $12 for an app that will let me do that? This didn't meet my needs so I uninstalled it.
B00AUA67GQ|3.0|It's easy to use for note taking on the run but has limited options. My guess would be the not free editions has more options but I haven't tried it!
B00EB6F1TY|5.0|love it wonderful stuff its great iron man can word tall long short small big dump trucks for dino poop
B0058W74UY|1.0|Could not get this app to download.  Tried 3 times. Finally got it to download, and then couldn't access the file.
B00CTT9646|3.0|This is a review of the phaser included with the movie. I preordered mine several months ago and got it in on the 10th. The weight and size of the phaser surprised me, I didn't realize the ones in the movie were that large. The weight makes it feel like a quality piece but the construction was somewhat lacking. QMX's website says the phasers spinner is \\"spring loaded with an active locking mechanism that snaps the spinner neatly in place.\\" but there is no spring loaded anything, you manually spin the spinner into place with your finger and the locking mechanism is magnets with one in the phaser body and one in either end of the spinner. The lack of a spring loaded phaser wouldn't bother me so much if the spinner would actually turn freely but it gets stuck on the phaser body and has to be forced the rest of the way around. Not only that but the magnets are misaligned so when the magnets lock on the red tip, the phaser tip is off center from the rest of the weapon. Seems like alot of people had the same issue with the spinner not moving freely and getting stuck. I suppose i could have exchanged it but i've read of several people doing so and getting one made just as poorly. Some people have received perfect ones though so i guess its just chance. Overall I was a bit let down so I returned the item and got the Target exclusive copy of the movie instead. Its a shame really, I had purchased a previous item from qmx and its quality was great but this one not so much.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Great strong female lead compared to the other female characters in some movies.  Can't wait for the rest of the books-into-movies of this series.
0425252868|5.0|Amazing story, and even more amazing that these two combatants lived through the war to complete their tour of duty, let alone find each other 40 years later and become friends.
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|I cannot wait for season 3!  Good thing its not out yet because I need some sleep!  Once you start watching this series it is difficult to stop.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|I was an early adopter of Chromecast and everything was all good when you could watch Amazon Instant Video streamed from my laptop. THEN they decided to block all access by changing their media player to Silverlight. Now all of a sudden Chromecast doesn't support Silverlight!!!! That's not cool Amazon!!! First you won't release a Instant Video app for Android, only for your crappy Kindle Fire and now you pull this! Bezos needs to go run Washington Post and sell Amazon to a nicer person. Amazon is trying to control what we pay for just so they don't lose a little money form people not buying his crappy tablet. I love Chromecast and everyone should have one. I just wish Amazon cared more.<br /><br />Thanks for nothing Amazon!
B004UID2LC|2.0|I'd rather pay for a You Tube Downloader than to view ads, especially when the hide part of the video.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|I enjoyed the style of writing.  The story just seemed to take a while to start. The epilogue was thought provoking. I will look for more from this author.
B000PMLFRA|5.0|This item is exactly what I was looking for when shopping, and it was exactly what I expected when it arrived.
1932100660|5.0|I like the way Collin explains things for ordinary people. It is straightforward. He makes a very complex subject into info the ordinary person can grasp. Why are half of us predicted to die of cancer???We all need to look at our diets and how we feel after a life of<br />junk food.....harmful and void of nutrition. Wake up! Think about your health. Read this book.
B005J4TLO8|5.0|This item is exactly what I was looking for when shopping, and it was exactly what I expected when it arrived.
1935251740|5.0|This is a new idea on the creation of the universe.<br />This is a book that as a layman I can understand.

1416955070|5.0|Couldn't put it down! Cassandra Clare is a well-written author. I would recommend this to anyone, You'll want to read all five books!
B006VFLIYK|4.0|Will Robie is an interesting person.  Baldacci brings him to life in this novel. Can't wait for more action stories.
B00AYB0TOW|4.0|It was quite good; a heightened &#34;dark&#34; and &#34; dismal&#34; aura than the prior movie that laid a foundation for greater suspense!
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Good book! Easy read and enjoyable, you can't help to fall in love with the characters. Some of the scenes could have been steamer but overall it's worth the free read.
B00A0NOF7G|3.0|the story and characters were interesting enough, but the lack of editing was very distracting. it's a quick read though, and I would probably give another of her books a try.
B004EIZCPM|4.0|It was so entertained and funny. It is a chick-flick movie but you could enjoy the jokes around the High school life. If you are looking to have a fun time, this is a good choice.
0425264351|5.0|Book was in good condition and the story excellent.I love the underlying theme of the book. Clint Eastwood would have made a great Jack Reacher.
B002SSUQFG|3.0|I was looking for a watch that worked without batteries. I chose it and it works well. But it does not accurate and you need to put on time. If you are looking for a accurate watch, this watch is not a good choice.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|The book was a really good read. The story line was amazing and had me totally caught up page after page.
B009JBZH54|5.0|I like this trilogy because you could see the hero process. Batman is growing up as hero step by step. He showed his mistakes, passion and fear. I highly recommend this trilogy.
B006GWO5NE|1.0|This cord works well but it's not 5' long it's the same size as the other size don't fall for the size it's just like the one it comes with.
B003Y5H5HY|4.0|This is a really good suspenseful movie. I know there are a couple disturbing scenes in the movie. But I don't judge a movie like that. It is a really good plot with very good actors in this. I'm very disappointed Roony Mara did not get best actress for this movie. Looking forward to the girl who played with fire.
B008Y6ZTKS|4.0|This movie is inspirational and thought provoking. It's unfortunate that things like that happen, but she was able to persevere. That made the movie good.
1451648537|4.0|This book To me is very good. I was not bored with it. My only problem is it just went into detail a little too much. But other than that it was no problem. I love the nice pictures of it. If you want a good book on Steve Jobs or if you are a big Apple fan like I am this the book to read.
B003TJR2HS|5.0|Charges an iPhone 4S without the annoying buzz that happens in my Scosche passport. The passport charges, but has a noise that drove me crazy (was most noticeable under low volume or between songs). The Scosche did it with my iPhone and iPod. The CableJive seems to have remedied that problem. I've had it 1 day now & will update if it starts buzzing too.<br /><br />Also, I ordered the ProClip and the CableJive added exactly enough cable length to fit the iPhone & stock Infiniti connector. No more, dropping my phone into the cup holder.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|While I did enjoy it I felt it was very thin on plot so therefore drawn out, possibly to fill the pages.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Following the first book bringing back the characters whom you embrace. And a new time in history.<br />I time that I lived in.Gave some insight and facts that I never knew..Can.t wait for the next book!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|The series contains a wonderful cast.  The storyline is totally absorbing.  Costumes represent the period to perfection.  My favorite TV show, hands down.
B000YEUUCK|5.0|I really enjoyed this show. I recently saw Celine's show in Las Vegas, and she was truly amazing!<br />by the way I got the DVD really fast, also loved the price I paid.<br />Thanks!<br />Teresa Monterrosa
1555175163|4.0|Pictures were great of this great man.  Interesting reading, but not enough \\"details\\" - what happened to his wife and other children left behind?  One of them found him after many years, but were there others?  And what of the daughter that went with him to Hong Kong?  Wish there was more details...
0316113514|5.0|Need to \\"clear\\" your head? Go for a run, or a walk. Turns out, there is a lot more to this phrase than simply \\"getting fresh air.\\" It should not come as a surprise that exercising changes our internal chemistry - yes, we burn calories, but could it also affect our mood and mental performance? Turns out, the answer is yes, and in fact, the impact can be dramatic. The simple act of putting one foot in front of the other (or any other form of exercise) can help with depression, improve mental acuity and performance, give you a sense of self-control, and more. Next time you're feeling down, under stress, or have a big presentation or deadline coming up - exercise.<br /><br />The book covers a number of case studies, ranging from impact of doing a cardiovascular workout on high-school students, to patients suffering from depression. You'll learn about the (basic) chemistry of what goes in our bodies, plus a number of tips for how to improve your own performance - good news, it doesn't take much.
1607066017|5.0|I purchased this graphic novel without reading a single review merely for the cover art and I was pleasantly surprised to find an imaginative, masterfully illustrated space epic that mixes science fiction with fantasy without over doing it.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|So limited it should be from apple. For months now only netflix and google play. Casting from chrome is very poor quality. No ability to use Network attached storage, works only with a few limited sites on chrome and playback is rotten. So many other android dongles out there, and most have access to full play store and can access NAS and other sources on your network. Luckily it was only 35$ so I don't feel to bad. Had high hopes.
B0066WJLU6|5.0|I love this easy to use app. So. Many colors to use and it is always so bright. I have no issues with this at all.
B009ZZDNT6|1.0|When I use the alarm it does not go off when you set it. It goes of for all the time from when you press start to the ending time. Then the noise just stops at th  ending time. It does not go off.
B000LJ9ZWO|4.0|Great plot. Great actors.<br /><br />Set in the not so distant future at an exclusive theme resort.  Guest have a choice of Roman, King Arthur or Western experience.<br /><br />The resort is staffed by human looking robots and the experience is advertised as being real but safe.<br /><br />After a computer problem the robots cease being submissive play toys.<br /><br />The Western gun fight scenes between Ricard Benjamin and Yul Brenner are priceless.
B00CNEVII4|4.0|just so you know.  As long as the tapes used are decent, mastering is much more important for good sound.
B008QTVNUI|4.0|Exciting and surprising. I am not often surprised by pkot twists but Homeland delivers plenty.  Wish they did a better job of portraying the military side of the story,  some of that side of the story is just silly.
B0076DEJMO|5.0|The First Law Trilogy, then Best Served Cold, the Heroes and last Red Country. It gets better with each book.
B00ECU1A6C|5.0|My daughter loves this show, a great show about friendship. Friendship is the best power of all!!!  We love it
B0088W7VNG|5.0|This has always been one of my favorite series. I was quite happy to find all seasons on Amazon.<br />They insist on one.....more.....Word!,,,,
B0053O89JM|5.0|This is the final season of &#34;House.&#34; Not a lot of extras here on this DVD set, but I don't miss them. The final episodes are pretty compelling.
B008602KQI|5.0|I never read any of the books so I can only review the movie. The characters, setting and acting was magnificent. The movie had me glued to the TV. Jennifer Lawrence did a wonderful job playing Katnis and I cannot wait to see her act in the next Hunger Games. If you have Amazon Prime Instant Video, then this a must-see. I have seen this movie 3 times and it doesn't disappoint.
0756603749|5.0|As I was skimming through this book yesterday evening. It gives colorful examples, history of the knots, each section is broken up by type of knot. Very well thought out edition. gk
B001QB5S3G|5.0|This film relates in an historically accurate but non-documentary style the demise of the Jesuit missions in South America.  It is a gripping tale of Faith vs. political necessity, of Love and Compassion vs. Brute Force and intimidation, of Nobility of Soul vs. Avarice.<br />See it.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I don't know what else to say about this book. Simply one of the best love stories I've ever read.
B00AYB0TOW|5.0|This movie was perfect.  Solid adaptation of the comic, and a damn good action movie.  5 stars, no regrets.  [...]  Petition to make a Dredd sequel in that link.
B009VIZDLI|5.0|Reasons I enjoyed this novel:<br />1. I love an unreliable protagonist; they're so interesting when well-written.<br />2. All the characters in the story were well-rounded and believable. They were all flawed but (mostly) likeable.<br />3. There were brilliant little flashes of humour throughout the story.<br />4. As the reader I was drawn into the world of a person on the Autism Spectrum and it was interesting to see how quickly you can relate to those points of view.
B001MSMULG|5.0|This is the first book by Daniel Silva I read, and I love it. Great plot, with unexpected twists and turns all over.
B009EHDU7U|3.0|I guess this story reminded me of a Swedish version of Forrest Gump. The protagonist, Allan, had been all over the world during his long life and done just about everything possible. (This is all told in flashbacks which were mostly really good, but occasionally a bit twee.)<br />The &#34;main,&#34; or contemporary, storyline was cute, but in my opinion would not have been able to hold up the novel if not for the flashbacks. I guess that's not uncommon with these types of stories. What bothered me was how everything worked out so easily for Allan and his rag-tag bunch of fugitives. Solutions to their problems seemed to materialise almost as soon as the problem had presented itself.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Spell bound and enticing always detailed and well written...only proves if u expect someone to be bad they will be...but the author always lets the good guy win in the end...
B00DY951TO|5.0|Incredibly Socko, Bobby! Good Lord, Man, you are an Unstoppable Force,  This is such Good Stuff, Maynard. Man, that version of Paxton's Annies song and the lovely version of All the Tired Horses.  What have we lucky folks have possibluy done to deserve such lasting Genius?
B007IXWL2C|5.0|EL James knows how to do a Trilogy...having them ready for u....no waiting...u get to be with your character's from beginning to end...best book series I have read in years..
B009RH9FR6|5.0|really lovin my new marware revolving case when I need my hands free. I can read and cook at same time
B00846REIS|5.0|cant wait for the next one...love Sylvia first novel I have read by her and will read her often...pure joy
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|would like to know the rules of the game up front instead of having to look up how to play.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Sylvia you have to stop doing this to me...I waited for this book and now I am waiting again...guess that means I loved it...
B00CKOYVG8|3.0|fun after I understood how it worked.  would like to see more information on how it is to be played before downloading
B00DDXJRJG|2.0|I've noticed all the positive reviews coming from Kindles. I tried it on my Toshiba excite android jelly bean and found it really of no value. You might notice something else. I really can't speak for other devices but for this one it wasn't worth the download.
B002UWH8P6|5.0|This is a series that was cancelled before its time.<br /><br />Two great years of episodes.<br /><br />The series had a great cast of actors, stories, special effects, and music.<br /><br />It is different from the other SG series which I enjoyed too; however, SG:U is my favorite one of the SG series.<br /><br />Watch and enjoy!
B004SDEP38|3.0|Not a bad app but its competition is much nicer to use. I would take a hard look at the other paid productivity apps before purchasing. Got this free app of the day and that's about what I'd pay.
B004S5FW1U|4.0|I watched the movie first, but being a book lover wondered what the book would be like. I was surprised that I actually enjoyed the movie more. However, it is still a good read. It is a interesting look into people's lives, their motivations, love, betrayal, pain and recovery. It is about learning to love unconditionally, needing and being needed despite all the flaws. Very touching story. Light-hearted but not superficial.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|This is a story line that will stay with you. I couldn't believe the way my emotions were pulled by the characters and what happened to them. This is a well written book and an interesting historical perspective (despite being fiction). Well worth your time.
B004X6PRO6|5.0|A terrific read. One of those books you rush to finish, and then are sorry to see end. I don't know how true it is to the real North Korea, but it is a fascinating story, beautifully told, that feels true to itself.
B004ZH66XO|5.0|Over the years I've seen them add and take away different stuff, but the game is always fun and challenging. Addicting too!
B00DPH7QFM|3.0|If you're a fan from the 70's then this release may get you excited. while it is a true treat to see Ritchie on stage and bringing back the Rainbow sounds, what is missing? Sorry Doogie, it's Ronnie James Dio and the lack of shows how much fire and stage prescence Dio really delivered. I'm not going to whine and complain, it's a fair attempt at bringing back the passion of those years and a touch of Deep Purple, but it just falls a bit short.  Good for a view I will say that, but not archive.
B00BWBHIUG|2.0|This game has good graphics and is attractive to young children but it is definitely for older children! You must be able to read to play the game! Very disappointing! My grandchildren seem to prefer to play games indepentently!
B006WAIV6M|4.0|A book with a powerful narrative on how we build habits and the examples bring alive the narrative. Good read.
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|This game is my granddaughters (age 7)  favorite! It's fast-paced, has wonderful graphics, and is just plain fun!!! My 4 year old grandson also likes this game!
0061906220|5.0|He is one cool cat. My son loves this book. It's the first in what will be a large Pete the Cat collection.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Awesome show. Interesting characters with colorful personalities, Not just another show about high powered attorneys. Now if I could just watch season 3 without paying.....
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Just when it seems like you hit a wall at a given stage, you get the aha moment and make the solve.
B00BY8DIT2|5.0|Best new Blues artist in last 40 years. This duet is outstanding. Never get tired of  hearing it. Alan L. Dehn New York
B00DHKKN6Q|4.0|My son downloaded this app, but I think I am playing it as much as he is.  There are no glitches or problems with the app freezing up.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|John Green is an amazing writer. The story  is incredible. WARNING :If you have a heart you will cry. Can't wait for the movie
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|a must have if you enjoy hidden object games. I can not put it down. one of my favorite hidden object games.
B009C7ZQM4|4.0|this app can give you more space in the disk, deleting unnesesary files,  then i want to share my prospect
B00BOLE7X0|5.0|To see a movie of this magnitude & actually feel like the character comes alive on the screen is something very rare. Watch it.
B00EEL0LGY|4.0|This game is great but there are some issues like I can't play multiplayer. But this he overall is great. But this game may freeze if u touch the screen more than once.
B000FC130E|4.0|I love Neil Gaiman's stories, and this one doesn't disappoint.<br />I can't wait to get his new book as well.
B00DHKKN6Q|5.0|Love this game and so do my kids! I have always loved these types of games. Fun way to pass the time in between meetings.
B009IH0ICG|5.0|I've always had trouble starting the charcoal.  Ever since I have this chimney starter, I want to BBQ more.  Using this chimney starter, I don't have to worry about any strange smell in my food.  It's environmentally friendly.  I have the small version which works for my small BBQ, but you should consider the larger one if you want to do more.  Get it, it's well worth the money.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Love this game, it's fun for the whole family regardless of age...<br />From the youngest of our family to the oldest, we are always passing the tablet around the living room. :)
B007Z58RLC|2.0|I just cannot get into this book as of yet.  Maybe one day I will be ready to read it.
B009WUBERW|2.0|Strickly a comic book movie.  The story line is absurd.  The acting is wooden, especially Chuck Norris.  I like action movies but this was almost unwatchable.
B00631VJIC|5.0|Sons of Anarchy is such a good show and this cd lets you relive the adventures and enjoy the music.
B004GYY714|3.0|Am still trying to work out how you listen to the cricket commentary broadcast on the local radio website, whichever way I try it all I get is the local radio program not the commentary, very frustrating!!!!!!
B00CP4GSGO|5.0|Movie was fun, soundtrack is amazing. Play this loud! It you have a nice system set-up, you will really appreciate this so much more. Since this is a limited edition, get one while you can!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This a great game. It is simple yet challenging which keeps you addicted. Everyone in the family will love it from the rambunctuous four year old to mom and dad.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|HMMM...It was good for the most part, a little TOO kinky.  The ending, though expected, really sucked.  Won't read it twice.
B009E2U7L2|5.0|This is one of the best albums I've ever played in the world cher is the best I can't wait tell her next album
B00E978FGQ|5.0|This movie is very well done w/ lots of twists and turns. It will keep you captivated. Great cast - Recommended!
B0088W6IMQ|5.0|if you liked SG-1 you will love this series. i am Si-fi geek and this show is up my ally.
B004J64QSI|5.0|This is worth watching and listening to.  Great performances.  I loved Alfie Boe and Norm Lewis.  Great singing and acting!
B006IGZWB2|5.0|love the movie in the movie theater. loved  it when i watch it the second time.<br />the movie gives you a realistic pick of a time not so long ago. you see that time period from a different point of view.
B0089LOG02|5.0|Uplifting, and good stories.  I enjoyed this book, and didn't want to put it down for fear I would miss something!
B004XUMMFE|5.0|Wow, I love this show! Totally missed it when it came out, and found it only because &#34;some guy&#34; on a forum mentioned how much he liked the show.<br /><br />The production values are superior, and it looks fantastic in wide-screen on the Samsung plasma screen. The acting is great; characters are great.<br /><br />The bonehead executive lady that CANCELLED this super show in the middle of its first season also no longer works at the network. I read a little bit about it. Sounds like intentional sabotage, as one show was aired out of order from what I understand.<br /><br />Watch the movie &#34;sequel&#34; also, called &#34;Serenity.&#34;
B0044IABFS|5.0|Great series. I tried to anticipate what would happen next, but was surprised at every turn, down to the last minute!
B005HEPS6A|5.0|Excellent show continues the high bar set in the first few seasons. A mist watch. Spay every episode is superb
B0099HUB8Q|5.0|I've loved these stories since childhood, what a wonderful life among finer creatures than us.  This will always be a classic and a favourite
B00AYB0TOW|5.0|Excellent movie. Managed to catch everything that is great about Dredd. Urban nailed it! This is how it is done! Here's hoping for a sequel ...
B007EC27QM|5.0|I am so glad I choose to purchase this calculator. This simple to use, versatile, calculator is the perfect one for my use.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Phenomenal acting and lots of twists and turns. Drama just gets crazier and crazier this season. Very enjoyable. Can't wait for season 3!
B008P1EWIM|2.0|I do not live in where this is reporting my weather from. It appears to be very thorough in everything else.
B007TKT2SK|5.0|This is an excellent app.  It was well worth the price paid. I use is it frequently.  It has many uses.
B000SCHBGQ|4.0|This book would be an enjoyable read for ages 12 and up.  I would have given it 5 stars if it had been text to speech
B00992CF6W|3.0|Well I do like it but it crashed my kindle at least twice can you belive that?Mojang fix this please.
B00081912E|5.0|The Mask is a very funny movie and one of my favorite Jim Carrey films. Too many laughs throughout the film!!!
B009LDCZ7I|5.0|As other reviewers have noticed, the plot for Homeland 2 is a pretty fat pill to swallow. Is life really like this? That is the question. But just suppose that a few years ago someone presented to you the plot for a movie in which the President of the United States encouraged Russia to confiscate chemical weapons from Syria in order to punish Syria for using chemical weapons on its own people. The plot of Homeland 2 is no more improbable than that, or than the other events we find in the news every day, and you may just find that once you get into it, you're hooked by superb acting, from everyone involved, and by very plausible characterizations. Danes, though not a classically beautiful woman, is hypnotically attractive. The camera loves the great range of her emotions and facial expressions through the hours and hours in which she occupies the screen.<br /><br />This is not a great second year of any series, but it will do until another great one comes along. And most series these days really aren't all that good.
B001CTDH76|5.0|Great show. Patrick Jane is way too funny!!! Very entertaining. Season finale was fun to watch. All the characters are great. Love this show!
B00ELD3MUW|1.0|downloaded app to kindle. sent me to website adobe.com. flash player did not install to kindle. need flash player for websites.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|Really really good film but not as good as the lord of the rings trilogy. I can't wait to see the other two films.
B0071XO8RA|3.0|This book started out OK and kept my interest. However, as it progressed I feel like it droned on about all the minutia and small details and derailing from the main story. It did this so much that I got tired of reading for days about their trip down the stairwell. I couldn't bring myself to finish the book as it quickly lost my interest.
B007SPPANM|5.0|Amazing film. Extraordinary from all other movies. All the actors had perfect performances. Great story. I will never forget this film!!
B00A6J9SM6|5.0|This is the best written introduction book, on any subject, that I have ever read.<br /><br />The writing style is clear and light ... and extremely enthusiastic.<br /><br />Even though the subject has been a great mystery for me for quite some time, I was able to understand close to everything in the book.<br /><br />I had at least one of that &#34;OMG this is awesome&#34; moment on every single page.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|This is a great bag with plenty of room. I was looking for a dslr bag that wasnt too expensive but was able to store most of my equipment. this is solid and doesnt look to flashy which is good for those who don't want to get their stuff stolen.
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|The first season of The Shield started one of the best shows ever to air! This show broke the mold for cop shows.
B005GG0MIS|5.0|Not only did Ilove reading it, I have convinced 4 others to try it and they are also loving it.
B005MLOOJA|5.0|Keeps me and my husband entertained after long days of work/taking care of kids/taking care of the house. Just what we need. :)
B002NVTSGQ|5.0|I was six years old when Star Trek first came out.  We didn't even have a television set.  When we got our old black and white TV I Star Trek had me transfixed.  Now I'm quite a lot older than Captain Kirk was back then, and I see him as the hero with every episode.  It's great fun.
B003G4W49C|1.0|I was disappointed in this.  I got it from the library as an audiobook.<br /><br />Ender spends most of the book concerned that he will end up being as insanely murderous as his brother, Peter.  Peter enjoys torturing small animals and plans on taking over the world.  Valentine, his sister, ends up aiding her brother, who lets her know that he has thought about killing her.  In the meantime, Ender accidentally kills and brutally punishes anyone in his way.  He has no friends.  He ends up killing a race and ruling a world, but he doesn't want any of it.  He is genius level smart, but he has no idea he did any of it.<br /><br />This books just exclaims loudly it is okay to be a psycho.  You may not know that you are a psycho.<br /><br />Sigh...I can't understand why anyone would like this book, or why anyone would let children read it.
B00E0MCYPS|1.0|Free to give back it is so bad! A true throw away. Not to my liking and not worth trying.
B0050R0XEG|5.0|This spent me about 4 nights, 2-3 hours for each, totally enjoy myself! Very fine and cute bus for this price.
B002DPRLEI|5.0|I rarely laugh out loud during movies, but this gem is so funny.  Tony Randall as the distraught best friend is to die for.  Loveable cast, good acting make this my favorite Doris Day/Rock Hudson movie.
B00821PCJS|5.0|I start watching this show after I finished watching Under the Dome. I only had one season on for streaming. This show had my interest through the first two seasons. I was a bit dissapointed at the turn of events when they finally got to Charleston. Season 3 is not streaming at this time. I will be watching for it. Then again I guess I could find out if and when its on TV. Great  syfy show.
B000I9YLUI|5.0|This has got to be the most romantic story ever written.  This is my favorite version of this movie. Keira Knightley is wonderful in this as is the entire cast.
B002UWH8P6|5.0|Loved this show. To bad they cancelled it. I mean they could have came back and did a mini series to finish it up right.
0316067601|5.0|Great book. I was glad to read the story though Marcus's view point. He explained a lot of things I could not understand over in the Middle East.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is the best game I've gotten in a long time! I just got it today and I'm hooked like a fish to a worm!
B0042TV4IW|4.0|this is a fun series to watch and relax to. the story line is interesting and each chapter is fun
B00AZMFK3K|3.0|The movie itself is excellent, with good hidef video and sound. However, I don't recommend this particular package due to lack of bonus features. There are only six or seven bonus features included with only two or three worth watching at all. It is very disappointing that Paramount tries to squeeze as much money as possible on the very first print run of this movie. They ridiculously scattered the bonus materials on different versions for different retailers. I would check very carefully on the next movie from Paramount and see whether they are greedy again. If they do, I would just get the movie from Redbox instead.
B002JXK5VU|5.0|We are now enjoying season 2.  Too many channels, and nothing good on regular TV.  Nice to have a choice.  It is seldom that we find anything on the SciFi Channel, as most is junk like the rest of cable nowadays.
B003AQBYUG|5.0|I can't think of another franchise that has delivered as much fantastic material on a set such as this. This pack is filled to the gills with bonus features, and two cuts of every film. Absolutely incredible!<br />The fidelity of both audio and video blows me away, even after being a fan of the films for nearly thirty years. I'll let you go to bluray.com for a better review than I can give.<br />But if you're looking for the best quality the Alien franchise has had to offer, you've found it here. The British import didn't give my american blu ray player any problem.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|Works well on a very limited range of apps. You get what you pay for, which isn't that much. What's sad is it could have been brilliant if they hadn't locked out almost everything...<br /><br />Save your money and buy an android stick or a Roku
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  I kept wondering what would I do in this situation, what would most people do?  I can't say what the secret is because that would spoil it, but in the end it was yet another lesson in how secrets held can be very destructive to one's overall joy in life.
B0002858YS|5.0|Heard Mr. Brightside for the first time recently and liked it.  Decided to see what else they might have.  So, for my first venture I picked up the album that included that song.  It's turned out to be a good decision.  Now, I'm seeing what else they have out there.<br />If you suddenly decide to see what the fuss (no pun intended) is all about this is a good place to start.
B005QYKD4I|5.0|Forgot how much I love this movie!! Plus the fact that parts of it are filmed in Milwaukee makes it even better!
0802407692|5.0|This book is every bit as good as the original and in many ways better. As you can surmise from the title, this book is specific to military service members and their loved ones and it definitely delivers.<br /><br />My expectations when I picked this book up were not great. I expected a shell of the original love languages book with some bolt on additions specific to military culture. I was pleasantly surprised when I began reading and found that this book is a complete reworking with pointed examples and vignettes designed for military families.<br /><br />Additionally, this book confronts some of the most important and significant barriers to relationship maintenance such as, frequent deployments, periods of absence, reintegration, loss if intimacy, and (of course) PTSD.<br /><br />This book is a must have for military couples and for practitioners who work with these couples.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|I missed this season and was thrilled to get it and watch it with amazon!! can't wait to watch season 3
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I love Ken Follet. I love how he turns true events into historical fiction while teaching along the way. I was constantly looking up the actual history of what he wrote, and he really nailed it. I learned much due to his book but also enjoyed it as the novel it is.
B003Y5HWJU|5.0|My admiration for Mr. Buscemi stands!...A great series,well documented,and quite factual..the sets are very good,if the standard continues,then the following series should be excellent

B0073LWEXK|5.0|This was the first game I played on my kindle fire and I can't find another like it. Not being a gamer it took me a while to figure it out but it wasn't too hard . I would love to find another game that comes close to this! Are you listening, Fire Maple?

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Great book, page turner, much better then the movie.<br /><br />Good for any age not just teens. All three books are worth the time<br />for both boys and girls!
B0034JKZ86|5.0|My sisters wants this movie for her birthday and I've been all over &#34;locally&#34; and couldn't find it. Super happy it came in with plenty of time to spare! Now to keep it hidden, and not watch it over and over again.
B000I3PERS|5.0|I have watched way too many movies in over half a century.  I place Braveheart in my all time top 10 movie list.  Although some of the history in the movie is suspect, the overall scope and drama played out is amazing.  The musical score is superb.  The acting and battle scenes are the best.  The themes lift the movie still higher.  As long as this film is, I wish it were even longer.
B00BH0VSM6|5.0|Started reading the Harry Hole books with the Snowman and the Leopard. Loved the character so much I went back to the beginning. Wasn't disappointed.  A very fun read.
B0000E1ALR|5.0|I was a big rock fan in the 1970s.  I did not know then too much about Bruce Springsteen's music.  I only seemed to know Born to Run.  I paid about $12.00 for this 3 CD collection.  True Springsteen fans have commented on this collection.  It makes sense that a superstar who has been putting out music for 40 years has much more than could be represented by these 3 CDs.  I definitely don't like every song in this collection.  But, the majority of Springsteen's music in these CDs blows me away. I wish I had appreciated him a lot more back in the '70s.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I can't really add much to the other excellent reviews of this wonderful game except to urge you to splurge 99&cent; for a really memorable experience.  The game's concept is fascinating and the execution is gorgeous.  This one is unlike anything I've ever played on my Kindle Fire.  First rate all the way.  Bring on the sequel!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Super fun game to see the funny minions!!! I have this game for my phone as well as my kindle!!! ITS SO FLUFFY!!!!
0307352153|5.0|I happened to come across Susan Cain's bestseller mentioned in an online forum debating personality of technologist and decided to check it out. Peppered with anecdotes and stories, the book well researched and highly readable, not in the style of usual self-help books.  It is certainly an interesting book that takes a 360 degree view of introverts, extroverts and their interactions.<br /><br />The book starts by exploring the extrovert culture in America.  The reason for bestseller status is obvious. It speaks to many of us who have been called \\"shy,\\" \\"reserved\\" or at times \\"introverted\\" and \\"quite.\\" Nobody wants to be labeled this, especially in professional circles where it can spell \\"failure\\"<br /><br />I love the section on Soft power explaining the Asian-Americans and the extrovert ideal. It highlights the cultural variances as it pertains to extrovert ideal and introverts while also bringing in the cross-cultural dimensions.  The author's research is based on review of Asian Americans and Chinese American \\"kids\\" in America. She summarizes \\"Though Eastern relationship-honoring is admirable and beautiful, so is Western respect for individual freedom, self-expression and personal destiny.  The point is not that one is superior to the other, but profound difference in cultural values has a powerful impact on the personal styles favored by each culture. In the West, we subscribe to the Extrovert Ideal, while in much of Asia (at least before the westernization of past several decades), silence is golden.\\"<br /><br />Bottomline: if you're a manager, remember that one third to one half of your workforce is probably introverted, whether they appear that way or not. ... make the most of introverts' strengths - these are the people who can help you think deeply, strategize, solve complex problems and spot canaries in your coal mine .
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love the Bible apps.<br />I like the fect I can read  any where<br />And I can share with others.
B009HXG9UQ|5.0|Quirky coming of age film that is touching and heartwarming.  Loved the location...coastal New England Island.<br />Solid performance by Bruce Willis
B0013TXA5Y|2.0|Waaaay more angst than was necessary for the story or character development.  I mean, we were all there at one point in our lives, but I don't care to revisit it without a really good reason.  This book doesn't have any reason, much less one that is good enough.

B007P7UF06|5.0|I love musicals and &#34;Camelot&#34; has always been one of my favorites.  I lost my copy due to Hurricaine Ike in 2008 and finally decided to replace it.  It's the only movie that that I keep next to my DVD player.  That way when I'm working in my bedroom I can listen to the music.

It's ok but I felt like had seen this movie many times before just with different titles and actors and slight variation in the script.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Can't find find any fault with Temple Run 2! This game keeps you on the edge of your seat and your heart racing as if you are literally running from the creature! Graphics is top notch.<br /><br />Can't seem to get pass level 4 though :(

B000OPPBEQ|5.0|This movie series is one of my favoirites and one I can watch over and again. Blu-ray brings out the detail I have come to expect.
0525478817|5.0|A heartbreaking, but wonderful novel. Witty, heartwarming, and definitely brings tears to your eyes. It's an unusual kind of love story.
006212725X|3.0|Late in the book, Townshend refers in passing to \\"my own childlike heart.\\"  This helped me to realize what it was that both intrigued and bothered me about this book:  its almost artless naiveté and Townshend's own naiveté.  Despite all the many confessions of infidelity and drunkenness and drug-taking and over-consumption (of boats in particular), the book never seems to get to the heart of the man, even when it's the man himself who's doing the digging (or, in his case, perhaps, BECAUSE it's the man who's doing the digging).<br /><br />There's a lot in here about musical instruments/technology (and T. was an early advocate of the Internet, quite presciently), but one gets very little sense of where the songs came from (and the guitar solos/arrangements).  More music, less cognac might have been in order.<br /><br />Perhaps the best piece of writing in the entire book is a card T's daughter Minta wrote him.  It's on p. 344 of the HarperCollins hardcover edition.  Read it even if you read nothing that surrounds it--though you should:  Pete Townshend isn't Keith Richards (however, Keith did have the brilliant James Fox helping him), but if you love The Who (and some of Pete solo), then you'll find more in here to enjoy than to disparage.
0375842209|5.0|such a great book! I am so glad that it was a part of my summer reading this year :)
B00EEDNA4M|5.0|I simply cannot wait to purchase this amazing collection of dvd's, plus a barrel and a bonus apron.  What an incredible show.  You know you are a fan, simply by watching the first episode or pilot in season one.  Phenomenal characters, suspense, drama, humor, violence and sadness all rolled up into a Tv Series.  For me, one of the best ever.  The Walking Dead, The Sopranos to name a few.  But Breaking Bad will always be on top of my list.  Can't wait to see the last three episodes.  Bitch!
0446547638|4.0|It's a good book and I recommend it. It's not a dramatized love story like most of Nicholas Sparks' books.
0756405890|3.0|This is a very well-written book, but it left me unsatisfied because the story takes 700 pages to go hardly anywhere and because it is not a complete, self-contained story. Its only value as a story comes from its place as part of the Kingkiller chronicle, which largely invalidates \\"The Name of the Wind\\" as its own work of literature.<br /><br />(A few major and minor spoilers follow.)<br /><br />The prose is excellent and made me appreciate the richness, magic, beauty, and ugliness of Kvothe's world. But prose can only take a novel so far. Plenty of things happen, but the story hardly goes anywhere for long stretches. It is a 400- or 500-page novel stretched out over 700 pages. I don't mind detailed back story and world-building -- in fact, what attracted me to this novel was its promise of a rich, intricate fantasy epic -- but the only thing I really cared about outside of the character of Kvothe was the magic he would learn and his search for the Chandrian. Which we get very little of. I didn't care about any other characters or most of the specific events that happen, mainly because we get so little payoff with them. Everything in \\"The Name of the Wind\\" that makes a character or a mystery interesting or enticing is in the promise of what's to come, but none of it comes in this novel.<br /><br />Take Denna, his main romantic interest and the second-most important character in the story. Denna is a frustrating, cruel girl who clearly likes Kvothe -- is intrigued or even fascinated by him, in fact -- but who is hardly any closer to him at the end of the novel than she is in the middle when she starts becoming a major part of his life. We are given hints that she has had her share of troubles in the past, and she disappears from town for days or weeks at a time, but we have no idea why. We don't get any clue as to why she is the way she is: nothing about her past and very little, in fact, about her present. The only value she has to Kvothe's story is in the vague promises of some payoff to come later. This makes \\"The Name of the Wind\\" woefully incomplete and unsatisfying.<br /><br />Almost everything else that (supposedly) has any value to Kvothe's story doesn't happen in this novel. His expulsion from the University. His revenge on the spoiled noble Ambrose (or some other resolution to their rivalry). The (near-)completion of his mentoring by Elodin the Master Namer or Kilvin the Master Artificer. His learning how to call the names of things, such as the wind. His hunt for the Chandrian. How he supposedly causes the war that's going on and lets the scrael and other evil things (?) into their world. How he caused the death of a woman whom he loved dearly, presumably Denna. His craving of the knowledge contained the Archives, from which he is banned. (To be sure, his discovery of a secret passage into the Archives is a nice triumph and minor climax of one plot line, but this is all we get. He mentions spending many hours there after his initial sneak-in, but if he learns anything from the Archives eventually, we certainly don't hear about it here.)<br /><br />None of this is resolved in this novel. In fact, just about the only thing that is resolved in this novel is the dragon's attack on Trebon, a town nobody cares about and a creature we only meet a few chapters before it happens. Kvothe and Denna are surprised when they discover that a dragon (or draccus, whatever its proper name is) is roaming the countryside north of Trebon, but I don't see why a reader would care. There are far more interesting things in this world that Patrick Rothfuss has created than dragons.<br /><br />I have faith that this story will go somewhere and that some of these potentially interesting plot and character issues will be resolved, so I will probably read the sequels sometime, but I am not enticed to any time soon.
B00EI6E17A|5.0|I live for the Applause... at first I didn't like the song, but it grew on me and it sounds great in my car stereo system.
B0053O89KG|5.0|I love Castle.  I came to the show when season 4 was airing on TV but I started out by watching the first season on DVD.  I now own seasons 1-4 and season 5 is on order.  I ordered season 1 having never seen an episode.  I was persuaded to order season 1 by good word of mouth about it and my fondness for Firefly and Serenity, which also starred Nathan Fillion.  I fell in love with the show almost immediately.  As I have watched the show through 4 seasons it has consistently offered delicious fun.  The cast are excellent, especially Stana Katic as Detective Kate Beckett and Nathan Fillion in the title role as Richard Castle.  I have to admit that, much like the Richard Castle character, I have become smitten by the Detective Kate Beckett character.  And I totally empathize and relate to what Castle goes through as he tries doggedly to win her heart.  And I completely understand that she is more than worth all the setbacks he has had to endure in that pursuit. I know I am being manipulated into it but, almost despite myself, I find I am very much rooting for Castle and Beckett to make each other happy.  The quality of the character development here is outstanding and Katic and Fillion make us (or at least me) care deeply about their characters.  The supporting cast is very good too.  Castle has something for almost everyone.  There is action, mystery, plot twists, witty dialog, lots of romance, and no small amount of humor. As another reviewer aptly said, everything about this show seems to work.  All in all it is loads of fun and I can hardly wait for my season 5 DVD's to arrive.
B009FRG8IW|5.0|My kind of music. I luv trance, house, and dance music, but Swedish House Mafia is my favorite now. :)
B00D3NSDVO|5.0|I was constantly gripped by the book and appalled by the callous brutality of Clownfish and the endurance of Pilgrim. I look forward to the sequels.
B0097HSS4M|1.0|SAME thing that I put on top.<br />I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS APP.<br />Even though it offers various effects, I guess that they just weren't for me because I wanted more visual effects that were of my liking.
B006RXQ2CY|5.0|I'd been the movie before but wanted to refresh the details of the death of Princess Diana in my mind.  As I watched, I struck by how like the social structure and customs surrounding the British Royal Family were to those seen in Downton Abbey--fictional but a good representation of life seventy years earlier in time.  It was as though society had moved forward for everyone--except British royalty.<br />Contrast that with the recent birth of Prince George and the informality surrounding that!  The very much &#34;looser&#34; attitude may not have come about were it not for the reaction of the English people to their leaders' seeming lack of response to the death of Diana.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|This app works great ! I use it every morning before school and it's always accurate. I will continue to use it until the day it becomes inaccurate.
B0036S4B6M|5.0|Fantastic character and plot development. Watched entire series in a week. All characters have their own special story. Can't wait for season 2!
B00F2362IE|1.0|My daughter loves the turtles and we tried to download this app and it froze at 34 percent. We paid 4 bucks and got nothing. Disappointed!
B004J4WNL2|5.0|I knew I was an introvert, but I never understood why.  Ms. Cain does a great job of explaining the research into the reasons some of us prefer to listen rather than speak.  If you have a child that might fall into this category, it is a must read, in order to understand how they think and to understand how our society and our educational system is biased toward extroverts.  But don't be dismayed if you or someone you love may fall into the category of being quiet--as the title implies, our power is significant.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this game because it's fun to play when u r bored or if u wanna play it!!! :)
B00DH1G7DS|5.0|I enjoy this game quite a bit.  I especially like the ability to put the little numbers in the corner prior to making your final choice on your answer it makes it so much easier for someone like me who needs to see it first then finalize my answer.<br />I wish more of these electronic Sodoko games were like this.  Also wins there were an app for my IPod so I could put it on there too..
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This  game  is so wonderful. I can not  stop playing it. Is there templates  run rehab. There should  be a Temple  run 3.
0920236162|5.0|Great book. Grade 6-7-8 writing teachers:  this is a mentor text from Corbett Harrison's Writing Fix site.  If you don't use it, check it out.  He also has great writing products available - my students love them.
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|This is an excellent series. Great writing and acting. A compelling story. The Brits do it again!  I can't wait for each new episode to appear.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|I enjoyed having to think each level. There wasn't a simple answer for each game. A thinkers game, a game for fun and mental stimulation that slot of games lack.
0140135154|5.0|I needed to brush up on the ideas. I lost it over the years. He's one of my favorite writers and thinkers anyway. Glad I got it.
B00ESY7QXI|5.0|loved it! downloaded in the aiport and watched on the plan ride :) awesome movie! keeps you entertained and great soundtrack
B004X6PRO6|5.0|I learned so much about North Korea. Fascinating and well written. The news means so much more when you know a little more.
B000MDJH9A|5.0|If you like movies with violence, revenge, murder, drugs and plenty of action this is for you. The only thing I didn't enjoy was having to read the subtitles most of the movie because I couldn't understand what they were saying.
B000FC1K66|4.0|This is a complicated and surprising story. It evokes all sorts of thoughts and feelings. It feels like an honest story, certainly not a usual tale of relationship or the holocaust. It leaves an after taste for quite a while. I won't forget it as I do many of the books I read. It has a lingering poignancy. It would make  a good topic for group discussion. It most certainly stirs up feelings. Do read it.
B005OCFHHK|5.0|It's nice to have the complete series in Blu-ray.  If you're a Harry Potter fan (and if you're not, what's wrong with you...) you want this collection.
B00B22ASUM|5.0|This is an amazing story. Perfect for cat lovers, or for anyone that needs a true, feel good story. I still can't believe that Bob likes to wear a scarf. He must know that it makes him look handsome.
B00CWV8X04|4.0|At first the movie was very slow, but if you can hang in there for the first fifteen to twenty minutes, it starts to get a little more interesting. I like the twist towards the end, and the fact that it moved on from being like a dry documentary to an actual thriller.
B00E5Q1LTY|1.0|Amazon and Paramount- Shame on you.<br /><br />Movie came out Sept. 10, received on Sept. 13.  But I ordered it with free shipping so I can forgive Amason somewhat.<br /><br />But the picture quality of the regular DVD is terrible.  Grainy.  Looks like something copied from VHS onto DVD.<br /><br />And there should have been an DVD option with deleted scenes, background, etc.  I would pay an extra $10 for the DVD if it had these additional features.<br /><br />This was a good movie, not great.  Paramount- I will give you another chance with the next movie.
B000FA5STS|5.0|I'm a David Baldacci fan, have never read a book I didn't &#34;totally&#34; enjoy. Naturally I am adding this to my list of favorites.
B00ECUARO8|1.0|I had to fast-forward. It was boring, boring, boring. Characters negative and uninteresting. Matthew did a good job, but even that didn't save the movie. At the end I wanted my life back. Save your money.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I pLay it all the time something that is all I pLay first before any other game even though I have been gone for a while I still like playing it during the day and before school. Have you played it. But sometime I forget to pLay and play a different game but I go back to play it
B0007ZEBI0|5.0|Alternately edgy and accessible, a brilliant project from start to finish.  The mix is also exceptional for DTS surround fans.
B007ZXK08C|3.0|Terrific psychological thriller. Enjoyed the cat and mouse game with the reader in the first half of the book. Not so keen on the ending though.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|I hadn't read the book prior to seeing the movie, but on it's own this movie is a masterpiece. It's a fantastic story about humanity.  It's extremely well written and acted.  It's gripping from the beginning to the end.  If you haven't seen this movie you should.
B004LROUNG|1.0|Didn't do a thing for me.  Not the old days Grisham of can't put it down.  Just a day by day report of just plain old common stuff.  Just a waste of my time.  Better off reading Time magazine.  Me thinks Grisham is punching these latest books out way to quick without getting creative.  I'm about done trying anymore of his stuff.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|I bought this a few months ago and finally received it today. I was really looking forward to being able to easily stream media of all types from nearly any device with a wireless card. I thought of the incredible usefulness of a small inexpensive device that could steam the video presentations I create for my clients. Instead of a laptop and a projector, now all I would need to bring is my phone and a Chromecast.<br /><br />And now it's just another device that allows you to stream video only from Youtube and Netflix. A mandatory firmware update two weeks ago from Google REMOVED the one feature that made this thing worth buying. You can't stream  your own video to it. They are also hunting for user-developed apps for Chromecast and blocking access to them. So much for \\"Open\\" source.<br /><br />Nobody needs this thing now. Nobody.  You have better functionality from your Blu-ray player, or from any game console, or from the TV itself now. Every single one of those already allows you to watch media from Netflix and Youtube. And while Google scrambles to play catch up with all of those devices (at least one of which most everybody already owns) which already allow you to watch licensed streaming content, they forgot one important feature that those devices have which Chromecast will *NEVER* have..  each of those devices has a remote!<br /><br />Google doesn't care about what functionality people really want. They care about separating you from your money. Too bad a court of law will never get to nail the folks at Google for false advertising.
B00DHHWY9I|5.0|I saw this in the theatres and just knew I had to have it once it came out. This came on time and exactly as shown.<br /><br />Such a great movie!
B00DBSZEH2|4.0|A unique way to present an old childhood story. Maybe a little over the top in the weapons category. But hey, it was still fun to watch.
B005PK57IK|5.0|Every week this show brings edge if your seat drama, plus the audience gets a peak at Alicia's personal life.

B0064X7FVE|2.0|Can't anyone just make a good weather app?  I don't mind payjng a couple of dollars for a good one witb no adverts and a radar.
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|The author obviously delights in historical research, and has presented the various events of this time period in a satisfying read. I loved the format and enthusiasm of his bibliography.<br />A refreshing change from presenting  the beginning of Christianity as a litany of &#34;sound- bites&#34; unconnected to its actual place in time and history.
B00ENTDDGW|4.0|Cute and colorful and quick and fun. Worth the price, which is free. Absorbing little game. Great little time waster.
B004G606K8|5.0|I've read the book a long long time ago, still the magic has not faded.<br />This book sets the starting point for the upcoming saga leading a group of friends through a &#34;world war&#34; encompassing the imaginary world of Krynn.<br /><br />For dnd lovers -- this book, and its sequels, are a must.
B005PW3OS8|3.0|Easy to watch and follow. It was a little cartoonish at times. I thought the Avengers was done better. I
0525952926|5.0|This is the second of the trilogy and I'm extremely anxious for the third, which doesn't come out until 2014.  It's a great read that I couldn't put down.  I highly recommend reading the first &#34;Fall of Giants&#34;  so you get to know all  the characters.
B008QZ1ZYQ|5.0|On my first look at this game, I had the wrong idea. It looked like I was going to be up against the clock in striving to free the bugs from the spiders.<br /><br />I was wrong. This is a turn based strategy puzzle where you have to outthink the spiders and limit their paths to the bugs until you either free the strands which traps the bugs or trap the spiders so that they have no path to the bugs.<br /><br />It gets challenging pretty quickly, and will definitely test your ability to think ahead. As screens go by, the number of spiders per puzzle increase, but your ability to eliminate spider strands stays the same. However, you do pick up other tools to use, starting with the ability to freeze a spider for a couple of moves.<br /><br />As you accomplish feats in the game you pick up coins, which can be used to buy hints to puzzles that you haven't been able to solve.<br /><br />This is one cool little game, and one that could easily hold my attention for far longer than many of these apps do. I put it right up there with \\"Cut the Rope\\", although this one is 100% strategy, whereas \\"Cut the Rope\\" has some arcade style timing action to go along with the strategy.<br /><br />I ran this app on a Kindle Fire HD 8.9 with no performance issues, other than my own occasional inability to outthink some spiders. There are some reviews which reported that the app locked up, but they all appear to be a year old. I'm guessing that problem was fixed.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
0525951652|5.0|I could not put down.  The story is fascinating and I couldn't wait to read the second book -  &#34;Winter of World.&#34;  I highly recommend!!!

B009ZQC7MY|5.0|The BEST show on television, perfect rendition on UK aristocracy. A great period piece with all the right ingredient. Great cast and characters, although my favor is still the unforgettable Maggie Smith.
B009FZHYKU|3.0|Great series alltogether. 3rd season was lacking a bit compared to 1 and 2 in my opinion. How can you not see it though?

B008FPZQQU|5.0|1971 and this monster was wheeled out by the good folk at it says Atlantic but I am sure it was on Island on vinyl. But the seventies is a far away country drenched in a haze of illicit smoke and other terrible substances-tea, macram&eacute; and the like. But anyway it (the album) ground down the front of the assault craft in the full throated and menacing roar of \\"Barbarian\\" and then proceeded to mix it up going from king hit to kiss and \\"what the \\"Golly Gosh\\" (the original verb rhymes with class but censored by Amazon) in its full frontal assault on the senses and in-senses.  I needed a good sit down and rest after the first play. Oh, I liked it but then after that nuthin by ELP that came after could move the earth in the same way. In fact \\"Picture at an Exhibition\\" had me sitting on the bog for a week bleeding weetbix from orifices I did not know were openings to a purged soul. In 2013, it is still a strong contender for Neolithic prog-rock at its best-mabe pipped by Pink Floyd on \\"Atom Heart Mother\\" and \\"Meddle\\" but oh so much more of a neo classical rant than King Crimson.

B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|This slender man game is the best I've played not only did it scare me but made me drop my kindle and run for my lol I was around the building and turned a corner and he was right there!! The only thong I don't like about it is sometimes I would fall in a glitch underneath the world when I had like 7 pages. Which usually kept happening but lately. It's stopped. Great game though and if your having trouble looking for the last page there is usually a page on the end on logs or if you go to the end of the map and you go up the hill there is a building you go in and hopefully you won't die!! All in all GREAT GAME

B00ENTDDGW|4.0|I only played it one time but it made me laugh and struggle all at the same time! I WILL play this again. I put it on my Kindle Fire for one of my grandchildren but I really like it too! I gave it 4 stars for the fact that I only played it once and haven't got around back to it.
B009YG2ND8|5.0|This game is a lot of fun. It is sufficiently complicated that a guide is helpful, but strategy guides are easily available on the internet. The story line is typical final fantasy, and new challenges constantly arise. The game reminds me how much fun final fantasy was before the newer games degenerated into spectacular, but repetitive, battles.
B00AECGQF2|4.0|I love this game. I only wish it would save what you create on a page that you could see all your variations at once so you don't repeat the same thing on the same model. Other than that this ap is a total blast!
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|I loved it when this season first came out, and after watching again years later I can say I still love it. I love all of the twists and turns that are always an integral part of Doctor Who!

B00F35B8F8|5.0|I love this movie. I watched it 6 times during my 48 hour Amazon rental period. I have the amazon app on my TV, so this is a better alternative compared to redbox.<br /><br />It was only $4.99 to rent the HD movie for 48 hours. That's worth the price considering that I didn't have to leave my house to pick up the movie or return it =]
B008VN9XMY|5.0|Very classy novel....author stuck to history which is wonderful for history lovers like me.....I felt as if I personally knew characters by the end of the book.... Highly recommend this novel
B00CKZX0AA|5.0|If you liked the movie then you will like this soundtrack. Also the soundtrack is scored by Hans Zimmer, so if you like Hans Zimmer then you already know what to expect.<br /><br />Only a special type of person buys motion picture soundtracks. If you're one of those people, then just buy it. This soundtrack is exactly what you think it's going to be..

0062238868|4.0|Subtitled \\"The Autobiography of the Most Lethal Sniper in U. S. Military History\\", this book is written with Scott McEwen and Jim DeFelice. This is the story of Chris Kyle, U. S. Navy SEAL. If the name sounds familiar, it is because the married father of two was killed by another veteran who he and his friend Chad Littlefield were attempting to help through his severe PTSD.<br /><br />Kyle was a rancher, a cowboy, a rodeo participant, a farmer. He was a hunter, comfortable with rifles. A man who preferred the outdoors to the confinement of college classrooms. He was stubborn and determined to be a SEAL. And after becoming a member of that exclusive group, Kyle increased his skills by becoming an accomplished sniper.<br /><br />The book was much more than I expected. Chris Kyle is brutally honest, both about the job and himself. As an added extra, his wife Taya also gives her view of Chris, his deployments, and their lives together. I would highly recommend this book to anyone with an interest in the mindset and experiences of one member of the most elite special forces group in the world, other than perhaps the SAS. I really enjoyed Chris' wicked sense of humor, his sarcasm, and his honesty. 4.5 out of 5.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|The best way to read the story in its entirety. Suzanne Collins spins a tale of a post apocalyptic time where power and excess rules.  While the story references the \\"games\\" of ancient empires, the gluttonous life of the ruling district parallels that which we continue to see around the world.  Even in the book, history always repeats.
B00DU7BDXS|5.0|Subtitled \\"An Oral History of the Zombie War\\", this book is very much in the style of Studs Terkel and his various oral histories. The premise is an unnamed member of the United Nation's Postwar Commission who had traveled the world interviewing people who were involved in the fight against the plague of undead covering the planet. The good, bad and opportunist are given a chance to tell what they saw and experienced.<br /><br />I put off reading this book for quite a while as I tend to avoid bestsellers. I'm definitely not anti-zombie, but I don't read many books about them, instead watching the various films that have appeared over the years. I've even watched a few episodes of \\"The Walking Dead\\" and enjoyed them, but not enough to be hooked on the series. However, when my local library had this book available for download, I thought it was worth a read. I am so glad I opted to give it a try.<br /><br />This was, beyond a doubt, one of the most brilliantly conceived and written books in a long time. You truly feel like this is as realistic as it could be, with the various characters revealing their true selves in their remembrances. The emotions are authentic, the realities of war ~ any kind of war ~ are dead on, the hard decisions, the extremes people will go to in order to survive or profit, it is all there. Without a doubt, I would recommend this book to any of my friends, to anyone who may read science fiction, war novels, or history books. I give it a clear 5 out of 5.
B000002KIK|1.0|If you're a novice Black Sabbath listener try Volume 4 or Master of Reality.  Avoid this one like the plague.  Other than the title track which is average, this album is horrible. If it would have been possible to give it zero stars I would have.
0062278096|5.0|Just got this book in the mail, expecting that it would be aimed at the younger viewers of the BBC series Sherlock. I was totally wrong. Although filled with photographs and pseudo-files, it is definitely for both the Sherlock fan as well as fans of Sherlock Holmes.<br /><br />The first two seasons are recounted by John Watson in scrapbook form, with post-it notes added by Sherlock, John, and some by Mycroft. The actual cases from the books are compared to those aired as well as the influences for both. We are also provided information regarding Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, the various filmed Sherlock Holmes that are considered by fans as some of the best or most influential.<br /><br />The tone is dead on character-wise, the final chapter on \\"The Reichenbach Fall\\" is heartrending, and there's a hint on the end credits page. Very well done. 5 out of 5.
B004HW7JI8|5.0|I missed the tv series as I work in the evenings.  I purchased it as I heard it was good and exciting
B00AZMFJYA|4.0|Let's start at the beginning.  First, there WILL be spoilers here, so if you haven't seen the film as yet, back away from the review.  Second, I'm a fan of Star Trek since the Original Series first aired (yes, I am that old).  Third, The Wrath of Khan has always been my favorite Star Trek film ever.<br /><br />Did I enjoy it? Most definitely. I laughed, I cried, I fell in love once again with the gorgeous basso profundo voice of Benedict Cumberbatch (who I really, REALLY hope will read Edgar Allan Poe someday).<br /><br />Did I think it was the greatest thing since the reboot? Sorry to say, but I didn't. It was a good film, although perhaps pandering a bit too much to those of us from the old days with Dr. Carol Marcus and mention of Christine Chapel.<br /><br />The biggest problem for me is Midshipman James T. Kirk being promoted to Commander, captain of the U.S.S. Enterprise, without any stops or real training along the way. It jarred in the first film and hasn't gotten any better with this one. They did, sorta, address why that is a problem, but then it was pushed aside as if it didn't matter anymore because we have a \\"crisis\\". Admittedly, we soon see why the Admiral was willing to go along with it, not for the good of the service, but for his own personal agenda. He basically hoped he could use Kirk's renowned hotheadedness to achieve his own personal motives.<br /><br />I did like the comparison of Khan's loyalty to his crew to Kirk's own loyalty. Both men will break any rules to save their family, that same crew. And I'm not entirely certain their methods to achieve that end would be all that different, although the Kirk we know does have some limits in regards to hurting innocents.<br /><br />To be honest, once I left the theater and began thinking, I realized that the plot was a mess. Not only wasn't it logical, it didn't make sense (not always the same thing). Khan and his crew were engineered to bring peace, but were then deep-frozen as war criminals (whynot just execute them?). Khan is defrosted, forced to make weapons of war for the Admiral who uses Khan's crew members as leverage. And despite being better and smarter than anyone, must less a war happy Star Fleet officer, Khan seemed to have no choice but to do the Admiral's bidding. Except he decides to, instead, blow up a top-secret facility, uses it as a way to gather all of top officers in one location (and they sure don't have many ships in Star Fleet, do they?) in order to kill the lot of them, and then flee to the Klingon sector. Explain to me exactly how that was supposed to save Khan's crew?<br /><br />THEN, instead of allowing the Klingons to kill Uhura, Kirk and Spock, Khan rescues them by killing all the Klingons. Okay, I totally get why he surrendered. Once he heard how many torpedoes Kirk had, it was obvious they were his people. I give up. Trying to figure out this plot is giving me a headache.<br /><br />I didn't notice, but I hope they gave the writers of The Wrath of Khan some credit for directly taking scenes and lines from the original film. I really thought going with that end scene was unnecessary, but I won't say that I didn't find myself crying just a bit with the ever excellent Zachary Quinto, even if I was saying from the moment Kirk went into the radiation chamber, \\"use Khan's blood\\". Speaking of which, what the hell did McCoy do with that whole tube of blood? Tests shouldn't have taken that much of it, nor would bringing a tribble back to life.<br /><br />Was the conversation with old Spock really needed? Other than giving the fans another look at a Leonard Nimoy version of Spock, it didn't seem to hold much purpose for the film's development.<br /><br />All the actors did a great job with what they were given to work with, but I wish it had been a tighter script. We did get some moments between characters, but I feel like everything was rushed. I had read their tweets while the film was being done and they (Quinto, Cumberbatch, Pine, Urban, and Pegg) all appeared to get along quite well. I should also mention that I was thrilled to see Noel Clarke playing Harewood. For those who don't know, he played Mickey in Doctor Who. I also spotted Scott Lawrence in the film, just one scene surprisingly enough. Fans of JAG will remember him as Commander Sturgis Turner.<br /><br />The special effects were great. We've come a long way over the last 50 years, no real complaints there. I wouldn't say that the story was overwhelmed by the effects, so kudos to the crew for not making that mistake. However, I'm not so certain that the level of violence was as needed to make the point that Khan was this terrible, horrible, not very nice man.<br /><br />Personally, I think that Star Fleet could've given the same sort of choice to this Khan and his people as they did to the ones from the original series, a home of their own. Hopefully on a planet that didn't go belly up like the one from the later film.<br /><br />Letting Kirk lead the 5 year mission after he has made it quite clear that he cannot be trusted to obey the rules, particularly the Prime Directive? As John Watson would've said, a bit not good. Oh, and Kirk? Your record for not losing anyone in your crew sure got shot to hell and back with this one!<br /><br />I would probably give the movie a B+. It was an adventure, fun and easy to watch, as long as you didn't look too closely behind the curtain.

1455526959|4.0|L.A. Detective Harry Bosch was always haunted by the murder of a female reporter during the Los Angeles riots. Now he has an opportunity to work that cold case 20 years later. If he isn't blocked by others on both sides of the law.<br /><br />I've never read a Bosch mystery before although I had been aware of the series. Although I am one of those people who usually reads in order, due to time constraints, I couldn't this time. This is the 18th book in the series. It is a selection of the Sony Readers Book Club which included a trip to Los Angeles to meet the author. More on that on a separate post.<br /><br />Luckily, despite the fact that Connolly does build and age his character, there were no problems reading this and understanding who was who. Connolly's book very much reads like a television episode. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but did actually surprise me. Overall I liked the book. Will I read more? I honestly don't know at this point, but I would recommend this to people who like police style mysteries and hero characters who may not always toe the legal line. 4 out of 5.

B007X70NVO|4.0|Very captivating documentary. Race footage was fantastic. The only issue I had is it seemed to lack a little focus. It seemed to center on Rossi but it would veer off and discuss other riders but with little depth. Overall I enjoyed it but it would have been nice to see more of other riders. I will be watching more MotoGP now though.
B00AZMFO6I|4.0|This movie has moments of greatness, but I felt like it could have been much better.  After I saw it, I thought, &#34;well, that was sort of blah&#34; but Maggie Smith was great as always.  I really liked the interplay between all the &#34;characters&#34; in the musician's retirement home.  These were high-powered, professional musicians at the end of their careers, but their love of music still shines through.  For that alone, it was worth the price.  Also loved the fact that the minor characters were real musicians and you have to hang in there and watch the credits to see that most of them were very successful in their careers.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|If you have Apple TVs and iPhones/iPads, don't purchase this device.  Its intended purpose is to stream Chrome browser, Netflix, and YouTube content to your TV - something that Apple TVs have done for many years.  Other than its small size and low price, there's nothing particularly impressive or innovative about the Chromecast media player.  I'm no Apple fanboy, but when objectively compared to the latest Apple TV, the Chromecast falls short on features - i.e. no remote, can't be used without a laptop or mobile device, no apps (as of Sep-13), no support for Hulu or HBO go, etc.  Further, as indicated by other reviewers, the Chrome browser streaming is terrible - quality is lacking and lag is excessive,  In a nutshell, this is a low-end Netflix streaming device but you'll need an Android device to feed content.  Save your money and purchase a [[ASIN:B00BGGDVOO Roku 3 Streaming Player]] or [[ASIN:B007I5JT4S Apple TV MD199LL/A]].  While a Roku or Apple TV will set you back 3x more than a Chromecast, they'll give you substantially more features.  I don't know what Google was thinking by releasing this device - it's a great idea but is not competitive with offerings from Roku and Apple two years ago.<br /><br />Everything you need to know about the Chromecast streaming media player:<br /><br />- The Chromecast runs very hot.  Not sure if this will impact long term reliability.<br />- The device includes everything you need to connect and power it.  But you'll need a laptop or mobile device to control it.<br />- Setup was very easy and took less than five minutes.  Adding the Chromecast to a local WiFi network is simple.<br />- Streaming quality from a Chrome browser is very poor - perhaps this is why Google still refers to the feature as \\"Beta\\"<br />- The primary feature of this device, streaming from a mobile device or laptop, is a diminutive and well established feature with the Apply TV.  If you want screen mirroring and have Apple devices, stick with the Apple TV for better performance and wider support.<br />- The Chromecast doesn't support Hulu, Amazon Prime, HBO Go, ESPN Mobile, VUDO, Disney Mobile, content on your LAN/NAS devices, etc.  If you want to watch something other than Netflix or Google Play, consider the Apple TV or Roku player.<br />- The device isn't appropriate for a guest room or kids room - it requires a mobile device to stream content and it can't run standalone.<br /><br />Don't be fooled by the Chromecast's cheap price.  It only delivers a small fraction of features available in modern blu-ray players, connected TVs, Apple TVs, Roku players, and other smart TV devices.  I'm not sure who Google thinks will use this device, but unless you you have an old blu-ray player (or none at all), no connected smart devices for your TV, and only want to watch Google Play or Netflix, this device  probably won't knock your socks off.

B00B52FDXQ|5.0|Title translation, Latin to English: \\"THE SPARTACUS LEGEND IN FULL, GHASTLY, BEAUTIFUL DETAIL\\"<br /><br />(ALSO, this review covers all three seasons)<br /><br />SPARTACUS is a giant leap for viewers of any screen, to maybe or maybe-not approve of. It's a paradigm-changer. Above all it seems REAL. Every scene, costume, background and kind of behavior is made real by thorough uncompromising historical research.<br /><br />Social, sexual, spiritual, government/politics, behavior, manners and mores are represented as were in 70 B.C. Details all attended. SPARTACUS' three seasons are all painstakingly written, art-directed, artistically shot. Superbly, dramatically envisioned, acted, recreated in ways that cry out THIS IS REAL. Sometimes uncomfortably real. (Something rare: No mood-reflecting background music, just the music, mostly horns, playing in that era to match action. Which works very well)<br /><br />For those who can stomach gore and perversity (sex, torture, murder) there are excesses; camera tricks emphasize blood-lust. Slo-mo shots in all episodes may be too much. CGI of blood spurting, heads rolling, limbs flying, intestines flailing. For shocking, violent sex orgies (surprisingly uncensored) or hideous torture scenes - all probably for the sake of reality of Roman life in the 70's (B.C.). Vivid background depictions of crude, cruel everyday life on streets or in luxurious palatial homes and official areas of privileged patricians add layers of information and action.<br /><br />There are no subtitles, just chapter titles. Far better, ingenious writing echos rhythms of spoken Latin. (60 years ago - why, I can't remember - I took Latin, vocabulary's 90% lost to me). Though I'm no linguist, the Latin cadence is conveyed in the English sound track and rhetoric seem as real as all else in this milestone production.<br /><br />Beyond often shockingly lurid moments, SPARTACUS offers sharp moral lessons. Like, slavery, suppression/population exploitation, excessive anything (ego, arrogance included) doesn't work for long. In fact, such have an inevitable and awful backlash on both perps and victims.<br /><br />You'll see the beauty of love, loyalty, ethics and allegiance too.<br /><br />BTW, I'm no shill for upgrading video and audio electronics; but this truly magnificent mini-series seems a good reason to upgrade to a Blu-Ray player - which you probably know remarkably upgrades video and audio for most any DVD format.<br /><br />SPARTACUS is the most uncompromising film/series recommendation I've ever made. BUT - Caveat Emptor. . .<br /><br />This Spartacus is not for family viewing or for those with puritanical leanings or prone to psychotic violence - like, how close dare we come to porn and excessive, vivid, glorified violence in mass media? Still, SPARTACUS is a great closest-to historically-accurate presentation of seminal changes in Roman social, cultural, personal beliefs and values - while still offering incredible, engrossing, exciting entertainment. It is A Work of Art<br /><br />A LastNote from the NYTimes 1000-best movies ever:<br /><br />\\"In today's excerpt - ancient Rome was built on slavery, and slaves constituted as much as forty percent of the population. This slavery could be unspeakably gruesome, whether it was the tens of thousands of slaves that died in the Roman mines in Spain, or those that were condemned to die as gladiators, and so Rome was left to ruthlessly crush innumerable slave rebellions:<br /><br />Spartacus, who was born north of Greece, in Thrace, received training in the Roman army as a barbarian 'auxiliary' (ally) before becoming a slave in 73 BCE. It's not clear why he was enslaved after serving Rome. However, his combat skills made him a natural candidate for the gladiator school at Capua, about one hundred miles from Rome.<br /><br />Here Spartacus and his fellow slaves learned how to entertain a Roman audience with dramatic hand-to-hand combat. Knowing they were going to their certain deaths, however, about eighty gladiators followed Spartacus into rebellion - using kitchen utensils as weapons. Before long they armed themselves with real weapons, slaughtering Roman soldiers who tried to stop them. Then they escaped to the countryside, where Spartacus incited a general slave uprising, attracting thousands of field workers to his cause. He led the rebel slaves to a mountaintop, where they built a fortified encampment.<br /><br />At first the Roman Senate viewed the uprising as a minor threat, but they soon learned better, and dispatched two commanders (praetors) to besiege the mountain and starve the slave army into submission. Spartacus launched a daring counterattack, ordering his soldiers to use vines to rappel down the side of the mountain.<br /><br />Of course the Roman Senate couldn't allow the slave rebellion to succeed, as the Roman economy was increasingly based on slavery. So they dispatched a new commander, Crassus, with twelve legions - a huge force - only to have the advance force of two legions annihilated by the slave army.<br /><br />(SPOILER AHEAD!)<br /><br />Spartacus now led the rebels south, to Sicily, where he planned to<br />rendezvous with pirates he'd hired to take them to safety. But the pirates never showed, and the slaves found themselves trapped on a narrow peninsula. ... Desperate, Spartacus decided he had no choice but to fight the Romans head on. Here the Romans finally defeated the rebel army, showing no mercy as they butchered sixty thousand runaway slaves, including women and children. Sixty-six hundred survivors were crucified along the Appian Way connecting Capua to Rome. However, the body of Spartacus was never found.\\"<br /><br />PRODUCT LINKS ::<br /><br />I recall only two films at the level of SPARTACUS, both, superb and then some:<br /><br />[[ASIN:B000ICLRIE Kingdom of Heaven (Director's Cut) [Blu-ray]]]  /  [[ASIN:B008645Z0M Warriors of the Rainbow: Seediq Bale [Blu-ray] - 4 1/2 hour International Version]]<br /><br />And for the historically-oriented:  [[ASIN:B0039ZBM64 Spartacus (50th Anniversary Edition) [Blu-ray]]] - Kirk Douglas producer/actor 194 minutes<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00AWKC0EC Sony BDP-S3100 Blu-ray Disc Player with Wi-Fi]]
B0065GC0BA|4.0|Excellent story which I really enjoyed....  will be looking for more of her books, and recommending her to friends for them to enjoy also.
B00BRH2MN8|5.0|This band has such a fun & unique sound that I was instantly a fan. I just wish the album had more songs.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This is a great series.  I have been recommendation this to all my friends as my favorite book this year.
B00947N6D8|5.0|Children of all ages will love this movie...to include us young at heart adults.  Although we've always told our children these characters were fantasy, there's nothing wrong with a good fantasy story line.
B000SEGTI0|4.0|This was much better than I thought it would be! I don't like a lot of sci-fi, but this was better than most of its genre. The story is an interesting examination of what it means to be human, and has as much relativity to our time (or any) as to its own created setting.
B008Y6QZ56|5.0|this movie was recommended to me by a friend. AND it was everything she said it was. Phenomenal! I can't believe I missed this when it originally came out...I love Tom Hardy I think he has some acting qualities we haven't seen yet. But this movie will pull at your heart strings a little too, so don't think its just all about MMA fighting, its more. and BETTER
B0091I7FEQ|4.0|Easy to understand and straight forward.<br />I you are a novice or just want to be a better programmer.<br />Halla halla.
B00CFYAT6O|5.0|2nd release magnificent. The band gets better and better. Hard to beat Susan and Derek! The band behind them is terrific!
B00BEIYOHC|5.0|I used to hate horror movies because of how easily I get scared. I slowly worked up the courage to see a few modern scary flicks before checking out the original Insidious. It blew me away. I was in sheer terror the entire time, and yet there was a smile on my face because I was so impressed at how effective it was. When the second one was announced, I was a little surprised but pretty intrigued to see it. I knew it couldn't possibly be as good as the original, so I kept my expectations as low as possible so as not to be disappointed. And once again, I was blown away. While not as scary, the tension and suspense are back in full force in such a manner that only the great James Wan could create. What really stood out to me (aside from Patrick Wilson's excellent performance) was the story. It truly does what any great sequel is supposed to do: take elements from the original and blend them into new material to build off the storyline. So in short: not as scary or quite as effective as the original, but a very good story and thoroughly chilling overall. Highly recommended if you enjoyed the first Insidious as much as I did!
B0055B7IPE|5.0|If you haven't watched it you are missing out on an emotional , joyful ride. You have to watch it , will make you cry . This  movie can relate to  so many age groups and it makes you really appreciate life an d the moments that take your breath away. You can bet this price to rent.
B000UJ48O0|5.0|I really love this full set, it is very stylish plus the case is really strong. this item would be an excellent present for The O.C fans.
B00CKR63F2|5.0|Disclaimer : I have received a copy of this novel in exchange for a honest, unbiased review. This review is not being influence to the fact that this book was given as a gift.<br /><br />Where is this place called Bridalveil Fall? You better keep out from this place unless you wanted to be filled with mysterious evil happenings in another world. Hmmm, just kidding... :-)<br /><br />This book is so well written by Sheryl that I am wondering if I am entering to the Chronicles of Narnia alike fantasy world whereby young children went to Narnia through the wardrobe. But this book allows you to the world of Ahwahneechee tribe through the bottom of the Bridalveil Fall. It may look similar to the reader, but the author displayed exemplary writing skills that are commendable and highly recommended.<br /><br />As I was flipping from page to page, I noticed Oria, the main character struggles with her powers and his love though she is a fairy in another world. In the world of the Ahwahneechee tribe, Oria found strength within herself and defeated evil with many mysterious mentors around her. While I was reading Chapter 5, I noticed Oria is in a strange land without her grandmother in sight. Without, giving too much away, Oria managed to locate her grandmother... How did she do that? Please read the book to find out more.<br /><br />This novel is really a great read worth your time! Good job Sheryl! I will be reading her sequel.<br /><br />John Black is the author of [[ASIN:B00F10UYOQ Project Mimic - (A Sci-Fi Action Thriller Novel)]] and [[ASIN:B00DQCC642 Quincy 2116 - (A Sci-Fi Thriller Novel)]]
B000JMKTLO|5.0|Excellent!! One of the best books I read all summer. Great story but a little twisted. I like how Flynn can be twisted without writing about blood and gore. A++
B00571F26Y|4.0|I have experienced such a &#34;lighter&#34; feel to my body since applying the science of this book to my own diet.  It has been three weeks since I cut out the wheat in my diet and I have lost 5 pounds.
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|It's a good game.  It easy, but does get a little challenge. I like it. I would recommend it to anyone.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|what a great app. I rely on it during biz travel. download this if you haven't already!!  good going creators
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|Everyone who wishes to expand their abilities, perceptions, happiness and personal power should investigate this sort of stuff.  : &#62;
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|This book is fantastic.  The characters are extremely complex and the Irish setting is fantastic.  The part of the book I most enjoyed is tying the story together through Jamie's time as a child in an orphanage.  It was very sad.  After reading the author's note at the end of the book it was even sadder, that it was based on real orphans' experiences.<br /><br />Without giving away spoilers the end of the book is extremely satisfying.  When I read the reviews on Amazon someone put that it was a sad ending and I did not get that at all.  Anyway, read and decide. I love finding books like The Misremembered Man.  Books that I was never going to read but somehow found, and enjoyed completely.
B009JZWO3I|5.0|I just really like this show. It is smart and clever. The characters are likable and interesting. I used to think it moved a little slow, but now I don't mind.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|I see that I am not alone. Many of us would like the old look back. I don't like how you made it all round and curvy and hard  to even find the dates and days of the week. I too will be using a different app to check weather. The old look was  wonderful...straight forward, no frills. So disappointed that The Weather Channel thought they had to change a good thing.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|I would recommend this movie to any and all of my family and friends and the general public as well. It shows that being a father is extremely important in the life of a child.
0812986180|5.0|For the majority of us not familiar with the jail and legal system this book is an absolute necessary read.<br /><br />It gives a good look at the situation of individuals within the jails and the fact that we aren't really doing anything to make it easy for them to readjust to society once they leave the jail system.<br /><br />Would appear it is time we realize that just locking people up isn't really doing anything to change the system and in fact appears to just create a re-entry when they leave the system.
0802473156|5.0|the 5 Love Languages is really quite the book!  After enjoying half of it so far, I find that God is showing me alot about myself that I was unaware of.  And all this time I thought it was his fault!  Can't wait to take the test!
B004ZY0VHY|4.0|This is not a book for the faint of heart. But if you can get through the challenging subject matter, you will be rewarded with a very thought-provoking novel. Shriver explores why people do terrible things and how we crave explanations even though sometimes there are none.
B0072V394E|4.0|I am currently taking in interest in lesser known spaghetti westerns from the 1960s and 70s and this seemed like the best place to start based on what I read about it and saw in the trailer. As for the film itself I liked it, even though the English dubbed dialogue was comical at times. I now plan to see more spaghetti westerns in particular the Sartana and Trinity films which sound like they might be good.
B004SJ3BCI|2.0|What is the big hub bub about this game?  It's really uninteresting and dull.  My 6 year old grandson likes it so I guess it's good for kids.
B0074QGGK6|3.0|A quick read. Some good ideas on expanding your creativity. The main concept in the book - there is no such thing ad original. I agree.
B004RJMUJO|5.0|Come on its fruit and you get to be a ninja of course its cool.  you get to splatter fruit all over without making a mess, awesome!
B004SBQGHS|4.0|I paid a token $.99 for what could have been a free download of this game to avoid ads.  However, the game has built in options for sale that keep appearing.  I find this annoying.  It also advertises other Angry Birds games for sale.
B009NY43NY|4.0|Really a good ending to this series.... was kind of hoping she would end up with Eric but it is what it is. I watch true blood and pretty crazy how the series doesn't follow the books at all!
B008MG1E4A|3.0|Over half of the book is gone before it starts to get into the bin Laden scenario.  Not as good a book as I had hoped.
B00333NCTM|5.0|I 've always been an ozzy fan and after reading this book and his life story I still do but am shocked hes still alive ..... and married lol. Definitely a must read if you are a fan
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Love this show! Maggie Smith is a marvel. I never tire of watching her. It is nice to own Downton Abbey so I can share my favorite show with others and rewatch it myself.
B001DHXT6G|5.0|I bought this for my husband and he just loves watching the old shows. Best gift that I have given him.
1452126577|5.0|If you're a Grumpy Cat fan, you'll love this book! It will  put a smile on your face every time you open it. Grumpy Cat would hate that!
0802473156|5.0|My daughter read this and recommended to me. I enjoy Gary Chapman and especially enjoyed this book. Great ideas to put into practice.
B000YMDQQ4|5.0|The endings are never exactly what you expect and that makes them very entertaining.  It is a nice set of short stories.  I was very disappointed when I came to the end.  I was looking forward to more of the same.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Awesome. The ability to get shows like this for free is reason enough to get Amazon Prime. Easy to use... easy to share within household.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I chose this rating because it was the best book ever!!<br />I think that nicholas sparks should have included if they ever got married or had more children.
B0018RC7QE|5.0|Quite possibly the definitive love story of our generation. This film truly captures all the little nuances of the beginning stages of a relationship: ridiculous small talk, awkward silences, and unfortunate sexual let downs. It's puzzling how this film has flown so long under the radar. De Niro and Streep deliver Oscar-worthy performances that stand the test of time. The next time I'm anticipating a rendezvous on a train platform with my married lover, the first thing I'll say is &#34;I love you. I do&#34;. A truly captivating film.
B008VVT51U|5.0|Visually stunning; kudos to ALL the actors.  They were all so good, I hesitate to single out any, but Judi Dench, she can do no wrong, and Maggie Smith was one you love to hate; incredible performances all.<br /><br />The film kept my attention from Fade In and never let up.  There was laughter and tears, a bit of sadness and finally, an overwhelming feeling of hope and gladness, and then of course a feeling of, I MUST have this in my library.  It's a keeper!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I am reading it for the second time I loved the story line very well written thank you  in loved it
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I love love love it!<br /><br />Its is soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo amazing I love every thing about it I watched all the episodes from season 1 to 3  YouTube videos to I don't believe I did but I did I am only 8 and I have a kindle playing this game called My Little Pony it is the most wonderful thing EVER!!!!! That is what I mean about my little pony.
B009NFHF0Q|3.0|Did not excite me.  Story seemed a little weak and predictable. The idea was good and well written. It might be a good book for someone who had not read another story of the type.
B000HL2J0G|5.0|This video was excellent. The clarity was great. It brought back memories of a more innocent time. I would recommend this video to anyone.
B00ARF92HK|3.0|Kind of what I expected but fairly well done futuristic sci-fi with bad guy (girl) needing to be taken down.  Lots of action and a little more fun than I expected.
B009ZG6YPU|4.0|I remember having to read this story at high school in my English class, but could only remember the very basic plot. I have wanted to read it again for years, and glad I finally found a copy.  It's a simple read, and the writer captures Charlie's perspective well, a mentally challenged guy who although strives to better his intellect, is totally unaware when the people around him (who he thinks of as his friends) are laughing at his expense.  Science and medicine give Charlie a new life... But a better one?
B000SO7OL6|5.0|I have become a bigger fan over time and after having seen part of this on tv, couldn't resist.  It's fantastic sound arrangement simply compliments the visual of being there.  If you don't want to watch simply listen.  Choice of songs is excellent and the arrangements as well as the engineering - of what is normally not that great when in concert at a big hall.  This is very well done and makes you enjoy her music even more when you see her playing it live and putting her feelings into the music.  Her band and conductor are simply perfect for her making this one heck of an album.  No shortage of songs or material either.
B00F4PVFE6|5.0|What a difference to any hyped US series! Real people as real characters, and events that one believes could happen!
B006I1OB0U|5.0|Great special but a wasted purchase.  I had also purchased the season and did not know that the Christmas Special was included on the disc.  Very disappointed to have spent my money needlessly.
B00C7O8TSM|5.0|What an excellent live album!  Beautifully recorded, wonderfully mixed and mastered.  I'm sure there was a little &#34;fixing up&#34; of a few sour notes here and there, but none of it is apparent.  And if they used any auto-tuning, you can't hear it.  This album sounds just like their 50th anniversary concert did:  nearly flawless, yet still very natural and human.
B0017I1FO4|4.0|Got it for only one cut. the rest is too head banger for me. But a few cuts are still okay.
B00425S1H8|5.0|I at first purchased a cheaper similar item from Amazon and it did not work at all. This one works perfectly; I use it almost every day and am very happy with the purchase. Unlike the other unit, the electronics and driver are made by the same company, and thus everything works.
0879309210|5.0|really helped me set up my Gibson. It has tons of needed tips. some really easy made tool ideas, though some seem a little crude for delicate guitar work.If your gonna work on a guitar, do it right.
0307744434|5.0|One of my friends recommended this book to me and I would absolutely recommend it to anyone and everyone else. It's beautifully written, it's whimsical, the description of the imagery just sucks you into their world. I had a very hard time putting this book down once I got into it, but if you're thinking of getting it then absolutely do it
B00A0SICYI|4.0|I didn't know this film was directed/produced by Albert Broccoli of James Bond fame!!! It seems corny now but still very enjoyable!
0525478817|5.0|This book is absolutely amazing. Cancer hasn't had an impact on myself or my family but I was still touched by this book. It made me emotional, but everyone is different. If you're looking for a good read, this is a very good choice
B00BR476TG|5.0|best movie i ever seen even bought it and cant wait to get it to watch again recommend it to all ages.
014241493X|5.0|If you've liked John Green's other books then you'll like this one. It's fantastic, if you're looking for a good book to read then this is a good choice
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is a lot of fun. I would recommend this to any one who likes the Despicable Me movies.
B00D3NSDVO|5.0|The most exciting book I've read in a long time. If you like a thriller then this will keep you reading all hours to the last line.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This is an amazing book! You'll laugh and cry but more importantly you will fall in love with the characters.
B0076DELIG|4.0|I enjoy most Harry Bosch novels, but as the story progressed the ending became more obvious. Never the less i&#34;ll keep reading about Harry.
B00BSN0K1C|5.0|Haven't collected figures before but this one is impressive.  Molding appears good and packaging seems to be suitable for survival.
B004V2S4SS|5.0|I love all of the seasons buy this last one is a roller coaster of emotions I cried with sorrow and elation.
B0040I09RM|5.0|Very addicting show. so glad it can be streamed free with amazon prime. Very excited for the new season .
B003FSTN7A|5.0|I miss medium buy now i can  watch these dvds over and over again. I think it was one of the best shows on tv.
B002UWH8P6|5.0|.this has to be one of SyFy biggest oops, for sure ! o, wait ... they needed room for wwe or more phony ghost stories, wow.
B00CS74W0C|3.0|A lot like 50 shades, but quite entertaining. I read the whole series, so that says something about it. What distracted me the most was the similarity to 50 shades.
B00005IC2H|5.0|Because Sigur Ros!<br /><br />A must-have for any fan of GOOD MUSIC or falsettoness.<br /><br />Why do these things have a word-count requirement?
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Great little time killer. Just enough challenge to keep you from getting bored. Nice surprise. Most of the time, these freebies really stink.
B00CX7OW1G|1.0|I still can't belive this movie was ever made. Hope Ben Aflick gave back his salary for this movie. Stink
B00DQVST76|1.0|the picture quality is great and everything but the 5.1 audio is horrible!!! there is only right channel, center channel, and then the left channel that is just the crowd and left over instruments. fix it madonna please!!! i need a refund. i very dissapointed madonna. you guys mixed the concert weird:(
B00COHAUD4|3.0|It was ok. It was good at the beginning and then the ending felt like the writers just gave up.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|My toddler loves this app! Just get rid of that annoying video that keeps popping up! A little kid doesn't understand why it keeps happening and starts getting frustrated and crying. That makes us lose interest really fast.
B008VBYN80|5.0|Addictive great graphics good fight scenes decent story line for a free app this isnt to bad highly recommend getting this
B009R659L8|5.0|Another intricate story expertly weaved by the skillful mind of Mary Higgins Clark.  Can't wait to see what she has in store for the next ride.
B00AB7HESI|3.0|This is a great game  but it costs money and you still have to buy stuff in game with real money! UGH!
0670451495|5.0|This book is such a gem!  I didn't know it as a child.  It was given to my children when they were toddlers and it has been a family favorite ever since.  They are are 7 and 10 years now and recently weeded through their bookshelves to 'make way for chapter books', but 'Make Way for Ducklings' stayed in place.  Both the story and illustrations are charming and heartwarming with a timeless appeal.  A perfect gift.<br /><br />Valerie Redmond, author of [[ASIN:1612441157 Emma and the African Wishing Bead]]
B005GFPZYK|4.0|Its was a great insight to what happened there, this is the real story, and such a tradgety that in the end with the death of Chris his legacy had to end
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I really like this game,my kids love it, and even my coworkers ask me to bring the kindle so they can play this game at lunchtime. Lots of fun, and the game runs well on the kindle.
B00D2K40WY|5.0|Very nice. Good for someone into fashion. I would also recommend the prom and pop star. I think the pop star one is a bit better than this one, but that's just me.
B0025WG4SS|5.0|The Turtles were ( and still are) a great band that to me, typified the sounds of the 1960's.  This album is a great compilation of there songs.  I wish 'The Eve of Destruction' was included on this album.
B005NFWCSK|2.0|Better than XMen3 that's about all I can say. Just not good.<br /><br />Not even bad enough to be enjoyably bad.
B00EY8BRGU|5.0|Reminded me of the Italian Job....Fun, fast-paced, good actors, great plot.  I highly recommend this film. I rate this a 5-star movie.
B005BRS8Z6|5.0|This book changed my life. If you follow its teachings, you will live in heaven, happy.<br /><br />Don Miguel Ruiz is a wise man, and he successfully passes on his knowledge about how to empower yourself as a person, be  free and happy.
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|Very intense right from the beginning.  Sometimes it's so real it's hard to watch, yet I'm addicted!  Incredible performances by the whole cast!
1401322786|2.0|Not as good as I thought but created some different views of thinking about time in general.  Would not recommend
B000YMM3CC|2.0|I actually purchased this instead of renting it YEARS after it came out because I hadn't seen it, heard it was one of the most romantic and beautiful love stories the world has ever seen and because it was so cheap (paid $5 on Amazon for it).<br /><br />I'm sorry I lost a good cup of Starbucks latte for this.<br /><br />I am totally down for a great love story.  There are many that I count as my personal favorites (Sense and Sensibility, Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, West Side Story, Brokeback Mountain... just to name a few), but \\"The Notebook\\" is barely one step up from some of the Harlequin Romance novels I used to read as a teen... barely.  The acting was very average, there was nothing about the story that jumped or popped out at you, and the script was just OK.  I think the movies' appeal for so many women is due to Ryan Gosling (and I still can't figure that one out - sorry, I don't see it) being in it and them fantasizing about him...<br /><br />No.  This movie is not that great.  It's mildly entertaining and I think 1 star would be too harsh while 5 stars would be utterly ridiculous.  The Twilight Series was better than this movie was... and that's saying a lot.<br /><br />There are some wonderful, truly heart wrenching, graceful, beautifully captured on film love stories out there, but this ain't it.  Try to watch it free, if you can.
B00AKKGX4W|5.0|I like stories that are in a series because it feels like the story continues.  These books are relaxing and easy to read.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|One of the best tv series I have ever seen.  I was hooked from the very beginning.  It is so amazing to see how they bring the lifestyles of the wealthy family and the people employed by them together in a whirlwind of emotional highs and lows, and how each of them are affected by one another.  You never know what is going to happen next.  Your emotions are all over the place as you get to know these amazing characters played by very talented actors.  Truly, an amazing show!  Can't wait to see Season 4.
B0032UYFA6|5.0|This series, I'm starting the 5th season, is an abject lesson on how a TV series  should be done-Small wonder why it has<br />and should continue to win so many awards.
B005OCFHHK|5.0|i've been waiting forever for the harry potter complete series in blu ray to get to a reasonable price (I think it used to be close to 200) i got this brand new unopened set for a 45.00 what a deal. shipping was quick as well. exactly as described. will be doing business again.
B0058YPG1G|5.0|Finally, with Mikes help, and of course Jessie, Walt steps up to lead his crew-With Gus gone, Walt & Jessie can go their way,<br />even though they must start small-The story just gets better & better!
B009IH0ICG|5.0|The full size chimney was too big when lighting the 10 coals needed when using the Minion method.  This works perfectly.
B005K17RU0|4.0|good app its pretty accurate and has lots of additions like hourly and ten day forecasts. I like it better than the weather channel app
B005DNOAQY|5.0|This film is one of Woody Allen's masterpiece's.  Imaginative thinking in its use of words.<br />Extraordinary use of a well known  character that are used in his film to make a point.<br />Thank you
B009HNDCC4|5.0|I didn't think Modern Family could get any funnier, but Season 4 proved me wrong! The acting and sophisticated humor are top notch.
B009CF7JDU|5.0|It's my husbands favorite! With Amazon prime....it's free to watch. Great quality as well. If your interested in the 80's check this one out!
B00CH26TL8|5.0|I love this game. Keeps me busy for hours. Just wish they had more free powers to the game they would give you.
B005UDD1R6|1.0|There are lots of media players out there; many better than Avia. I'd look around some before considering installing it.
B008602KQI|5.0|I loved this in the theater and I still love it. The characters are awesome. You see more detail each time you watch it.
B008YU0AOE|1.0|I installed this app and it worked well in the beginning. Now my Fire is gagging on it and it locks up. Have to restart. Hope I can uninstall the darn thing.
B001XUT6AG|2.0|It was a very disappointing film- all flash and dashing about with no real story.  The start was like a crazy jungle movie and then next we have a civilization near to being annihilated and silly discussion of the federation and its golas- puerile stuff, meant for an audience that never saw the old Star trek TV show.  I guess making money is more important than staying true to a story.  I wonder why Hollywood cannot do something original anymore?  The segment in the small space cpaule looked like star wars ditto to me.
B00E00RB5I|4.0|The Elements of the universe are back. It's new music with the same ole flavour from one of the best groups ever and unlike groups today stil playing live instruments.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Somehow the British consistently produce superior quality television series.  America has some certainly well done and noteworthy examples also; but maybe it's the accent or the beautiful settings, but the British have another remarkably done production. If you start watching Season 1you will be hooked.  Don't say I didn't warn you...
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|What a great production, and wonderful to be able to access on Amazon Prime.<br />So looking forward to Season 4!
B0049VZ222|5.0|I was totally surprised by this show. I loved it and could not wait to watch the next episode.<br />I am very happy with the purchase and other people that like science fiction but with more life reality would love this Show.<br />It is very impressive as far as their art work on the walking dead.<br />I really was impressed and enjoyed every minute of each show.
B0036S4B6M|2.0|If you can get through the first six chapters you have basically read the book.  Read the last chapter and throw the book away.  Far, far away.
B005RUUUAI|5.0|I was totally surprised by this show. I loved it and could not wait to watch the next episode.<br />I am very happy with the purchase and other people that like science fiction but with more life reality would love this Show.<br />It is very impressive as far as their art work on the walking dead.<br />I really was impressed and enjoyed every minute of each show.
B00ECU34ZM|1.0|slow movie, don't waste your time. wasn't worth the cost to rent. by time it got started, it was over<br />.

B000000OAC|5.0|Their biggest hits of all time are here. Love the artwork on the cover. Did you notice it's the members of queen in the robots hands?
B008FRFN7A|2.0|This works for web pages altho you have to copy the url and go back to the app to paste it in.  But I can't find any way to print an email except perhaps to copy it into a document file (if that's even possible in the fire) and then try to find the file from the app.  I would give this 4-5  stars if it could print from within the internet and email apps directly.  It also paginates mid line which means there's unreadable lines on every page.  Of course, even this is better than nothing ... but please fix these things or tell me what I can do.  Thank you for a good start.
B000000OAH|5.0|This is the hardest rock album Queen ever produced. I really missed having it in my library. Glad to have it back!!
B0001ARCFA|5.0|These headphones get the job done and more.  They're light around your ears and have great balance.  If you like listening to bands, every instrument is audible and clear.  They don't cancel outside noise, which is nice for me living in the city I can hear whats going on around me.  For the price, you can't beat them.
B000VZBCWE|4.0|Queen at the peak of their perfection. The first disc is good. The second disc is superb! Sound quality is excellent. Video is very good also.
B0084TWN9K|3.0|I'm still reading and have 20% left and am wondering if I'll finish it since it hasn't captivated me. A few separate short stories are included and so far I don't see the connections. IT's just OK.
B0036S4B6M|5.0|I read the book and really liked it. THen saw the 13 episodes which take many liberties but that's okay because it was so well done. There are many memorable characters in both.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|All I can say is wow!! I never expected the ending of this book. I think that the other ADA' s name should have been changed though. It drove me crazy trying to remember the pronunciation every time I read it!
B007D2XSW0|5.0|This app is an amazing app. Even though I don't have a phone I can download pics. You can edit pictures to make them halarious or serious or whatever you want. I saw picture in a whole new different way
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|I love the experiments but actually love the overall info that Pam shares throughout the book as well!  Thank you Pam for another take on a subject I love!
B00499QUK2|5.0|Awesome. I can't wait for Season 3. Very well thought out and unpredictable. It has me captivated from the start.
B006B7LQ90|1.0|I've purchased dozens of Kindle books and this is perhaps one of the worst. There are ongoing transcription errors. In addition, the side notes provided by the author with updates on marketing examples aren't formatted to indicate where they start and stop. I found this version barely manageable and it was not even close to being worth the money I spent.
B00EQ0CKRQ|4.0|Dude...awesome. Some of the fastest cars in the world. Truly white knuckle racing at it  best. Gets my heart pumping when the race is on the line.
B00F2362IE|1.0|I bought the games, 5 dollars down the drain because it never downloaded or showed up on our Kindle, I'll never buy from them again
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|One of the most interesting apps out there. I have had a great time playing . The  rewards and daily amulets are wonderful too.
B000OJFV4C|5.0|My wife started watching this series and couldn't stop until she finished it.  Obsessed might be the correct description. Well done!
B003XF1OJK|5.0|Gives greater detail to the halo mythos and characters. Small discrepancies between the book and the Halo Reach game, but doesn't take away from a great read.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Kept me reading even when I wanted to watch the Red Sox!  Great story! Great plot, written with the authority of a true story!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|What can I say.  This is very addictive.  I go to that a lot when I just want to rest.
B00B0LPYXG|4.0|It was very good but more eye opening. To think pilots may really fly in that condition is extremely frightening
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book is very good I think more people would read this it is truly an amazing book BOOM bang
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|I absolutely love this series.  The characters are so exciting and keep us always wondering &#34;what is next&#34;?  I am watching season 3 on Amazon right now (and paying for it!). Can't wait for season 4!
B000VDUWMC|5.0|Read it for a second time. Liked it even more than the first time. Anyone interested in finding answers in human development should read it.
B008J34466|5.0|This is a great CD. I play it all the time. She is an amazing artist with a great voice. I am looking forward to future music by her.
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|Excellent crime drama has had me guessing the whole way. Just two episodes left and I'm still not sure who did the crime.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|The acting was superb.  The seres has done a great job depicting what was going on in World War II
B000QRIGLC|5.0|This is an amazing story. Thanks to Marcus and all those who serve our country. May God continue you to bless you and your family.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game. It's very addictive with no problems, but I wish that the stuff wasn't so expensive.<br />Awesome!
B00ARF93AQ|4.0|Never thought this movie would be any good much to my surprise it is better than good.  If Karl signs up for another one I will be looking forward to seeing that one too.<br /><br />For anyone that has Prime this is a must see.  For those that don't it is worthy of a rental if you like Karl Urban, Sci-Fi or Comics.
B00190OHD6|5.0|Do not watch this movie without a box of tissue. I have cried through the whole thing. I rented the movie because Gerard Butler is an awesome actor nevervrealizing he is not the primary character.  Still I enjoyed the film.
B00AFARIZA|5.0|You could have thousands of CDs and records in your music collection and this Toscanini set would be one of the handful of most indispensable performances. The bargain complete Toscanini set of all his RCA recordings is equally essential with sound that belies the age of the recordings..
B008Y2VTIS|5.0|Boardwalk Empire Season 2 was just as exciting as the first season. I'm now on the third season and recording the 4th. If you like historic tv shows this is the one i recommend because it so realistic. This series give us a great picture of what prohibition and the women's suffrage movement were really like.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|this was a great game way better than the 3rd this a game that u really want to get. if u don't get this game than ur missing out on a lot of fun
B00E5Q1LTY|5.0|Awesome movie. Great action. Plot flows quickly. Excellent re-telling of Khan's story. I can't wait to see what I next
B00942Y4IY|4.0|Enjoy most of Kurt Russell's films.  This is one of his brooding ones so don't enjoy it as much as some of his others
B0064MPXFA|5.0|I'll put it Simply: It's a great show to watch and I can't wait for the new season to start.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|I saw this on a kindle forum.  I had a low internal storage warning and this app cleaned up over 3G of space !  Thank you soooo much !
B0035JNTA6|1.0|So stupid we couldn't finish it. Boo, Ben Stiller. Ridiculous accent. We couldn't believe all the good actors who took part in this movie! Surely it would have been worth watching. But no...
B009XY97VC|5.0|Though this album stands in contrast to, say, Invincible, I enjoyed it's ability to take my imagination to others worlds. TSFH's music never fails to inspire my own movies in my dreams.
B006QF61VA|5.0|What can I say good music GOOD Morning Vietnam has good humor and a really story carried out well by Robin Williams. His co star were spot on too. I hope you enjoy it as much as I have.
B0017KIBAI|1.0|I just got the controller today and the joystick does not work. Moving it to the left will not do anything and the controller also came to me very dirty.
B000ICZD5M|5.0|This movie is a favorite of mine - nearly ruined it when VHS was popular.  Of course,  DVD is the way to go.  I really like the concept that the population will have this type of abilities.  The future facinates me.
B0034G4OVS|5.0|I thought it was so good , I bought a copy! I had had it dvr, but my hubby accidentally erased it . I wanted a copy of it , so he bought it for me !
055358894X|4.0|The reason I give this book a four star rating out of five isn't because the story was lacking, but rather because the book binding feels a little cheap. This shouldn't stop you from buying the book though. While the story started out a little slow it gradually built into a book I couldn't put down. I had to know what would happen next. As I've read the sequel I can say that this series is shaping up to be one that I would recommend to all my friends. It deserves a place on anyone's shelf who enjoys a good tale of crime and adventure.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I have not read a book this good in a long time!  I couldn't put it down. I look forward to reading more from this author.
B00CY0JY88|5.0|This book kept me interested the whole way through very well written I'd recommend it to all women from age 25 onwards
B00957T6X6|5.0|I could not put these books down and read all 5 cover to cover.  Amazing detail,  full of twists and turns. What a storyteller.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|I just got this and haven't used it yet, but I have used it at a friend's house.  He has a 4K Seiki television and the picture on You Tube and Netflix is great.  We watched a few 4K videos on YouTube - very impressive video quality.<br /><br />Would have given it 5 stars except:<br />  1 - It has to have power connected and you never see a power wire in any of the ads.  It's understandable since (to my knowledge) HDMI doesn't currently provide any power (like USB).  It would have been OK if it were a bit bigger if it had a battery (rechargeable, preferably) - that would be swell.  Take it on trips, simply plug it into the hotel TV's extra HDMI port and watch your own stuff.  I know you could still do that with a wire, but it would be nice not to have to find a reachable outlet.<br />  2 - There aren't may apps (seems like it was, basically, YouTube and Netflix) - especially compared to something like a Roku.  However you can display any video that's running in your Chrome browser.  However, I have a number of videos (home movies, ripped DVDs - that I own) on my PC and tablets and it would be nice to be able to play them.  Perhaps that will be available later.<br /><br />By the way, Roku is coming out with a similar device (Roku Streaming Stick), but it will require a MHL port (something new on some TVs).  And I'm not sure at all of its power requirements.<br /><br />Further proof that this is an exciting time to live.
B00CBT04LI|2.0|I saw that this movie currently had a 4-1/2 star rating. I would rather have just rated it two stars and been on my merry way, but Amazon needs at least twenty words about it. Here they are:<br /><br />This movie sucked; more than that, it was pointless. The Thing was a perfectly self-contained story; it didn't need a prequel/reboot/whatever. And it certainly didn't need CGI. The crew in this version are idiots, and their dynamic didn't work nearly as well with the inclusion of females as with the all-male crew. If you're going to remake/prequelize/whatever a film, do something completely different without pissing on its memory, as John Carpenter did for Howard Hawks' original. Don't do this.<br /><br />Wow, that's about eighty words there. Four times more than it deserved. One star for the film, one star for Mary Elizabeth Winstead's performance, who is a talented actress in other films and certainly gives it the old college try here, but it just isn't enough to save this mess. Kurt Russell she ain't. Watch the 1982 version again instead.
B00E3BK0QQ|3.0|I think the developers have been getting a little too greedy. Yes,  this is a good point-and-click adventure game that does not have those annoying,  unconnected HOGs. However,  the free part we were given was not that much (we didn't need that &quot;riding in the snow&quot; scene.) Then,  we are expected to pay $4.99 - in my state,  now,  $5.34 since Amazon tacked on tax,  to play the rest. We don't even know how much more of the game there is. It's a shame that those of us who have been filling the pockets of the &quot;famous brand&quot; game companies since Kindle started, are now treated this way. Going to play my old games - the ones that were reasonably priced,  and were good.
B002VWNIAY|5.0|I watched this 30 years ago and thought it interesting and entertaining.  Today, a little older and wiser, the tale of intrigue, love lost and regained and the absolute uncertainty of war seem more current and real than ever.  I also realized the fast pace of this film is remarkable and seems very modern.  Somebody was very efficient in the &#34;cutting room&#34; and must have had &#34;Less is More&#34; above the work table.<br /><br />For the first time since this was originally cast and filmed, there could be a modern adaptation and it would work.  The casting, however, might be a problem since &#34;fluff and puff&#34; or action (more brawn, less brains) actors seem to be in the mainstream.  I like action movies like all the rest and probably have contributed in a small way to this deficiency.
B00CA3C1N4|3.0|it's ok, playability is high, but sometimes, font size would be larger, because it's a bit hard to read. asd
B0016K40KY|4.0|I first viewed this film in the old Grauman's Chinese Theatre  (recently renamed TCL Chinese Theatre) with its wide screen and excellent acoustics.  Peter O'Toole's portrayal of Lawrence was spot on after reading Seven Pillars of Wisdom several years later.  The desert scenes were captivating and gave me my first understanding of the vastness of this barren part of North Africa.<br /><br />Today, the DVD version of the  film impacted me differently.  Less O'Toole and more of the tribal affiliations and subculture seemed important.  The desert scenes were more captivating than ever since my appreciation of real photography (not phone pics)  has grown over the years.  Patience is the watchword in capturing the right light and shot.  Several deserts scenes in this movie are enough to warrant buying this DVD
B00CO4KGYA|5.0|very good physics, funny, it changes from level to level and the story is very different than other games. thanks
B004SBQGHS|5.0|VERY VERY great game.<br />minecraft is a beter game no awfens.<br />GET THE GAME!<br />One of the year!<br />HARD game.
B000002ITW|5.0|I attended csny's concert at Madison square garden more than forty years ago, and this cd evokes the feeling of that concert.  tired of hearing scratching and screaming on the radio?  this is your antidote.  enjoy!
B0094BB4TW|5.0|A game above other games and yet not so great as others. Too ignorant to list those particular games. Ha!
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|Love the music she chose for her album.  I have several of Susan Boyle's albums but I think this is her best one.
B005ZTFPFQ|3.0|A game above other games and yet not so great as others. Too ignorant to list those particular games. Ha!
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Loved it! Couldn't put it down. Not what I expected. A great story about love, determination and will that will educate you.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|A game above other games and yet not so great as others. Too ignorant to list those particular games. Ha!
B003L77G06|5.0|Everything was good.  One of the discs had a small glitch in it but after all it was used so I didn't expect it to be perfect.
B008YKGQR4|1.0|A game above other games and yet not so great as others. Too ignorant to list those particular games. Ha!
B0052RDHTM|3.0|I am a fan of Ken Follett's books.  I've immensely enjoyed the Eye of the Needle and the Pillars of the Earth.  So I was expecting another great story.  Fall of Giants was enjoyable but is not one of his best work.
