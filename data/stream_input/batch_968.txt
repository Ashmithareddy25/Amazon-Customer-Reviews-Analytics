B00005RG6B|5.0|When you have released one the greatest rock operas in history, how do you top it?  By releasing a filmed concert of the album...OPERATION; LIVECRIME.  The insane energy filmed in this release by band members of the \\"Ryche\\" Tate, DeGarmo, Wilton, and Rockenfield, will inspire, as well as entertain, any Queensryche fan, to anyone living under a rock who hasn't heard of them.    This is not your ordinary concert video with selected songs from different albums.  The filmed concert consists only of the entire Operation Mindcrime Album (1988).  Scorching guitars, mad drum skills, as well as mind blowing vocals, fuel the the energy of this concert filmed in Madison, Wisconsin in the early 1990's.    If you LOVE to rock, and you LOVE it loud, there isn't a better concert dvd you can get your hands on.
B001DJ7PNW|5.0|I had this - for me - best film ever, in my library for a few days. I just thought to have a look at it the other day, but I watched the complete movie again. What a wonderful transfer according to the old DVD. However, I had to adjust the colours just a bit. The picture looks warm and a little grainy, just like the Godfather on Blu-Ray. It is clear and beautiful. The sound of the film is crispy and overwhelming. This is a must-have, even if you have all other formats like Video, Laserdisc and DVD on your shelf. The additional book package looks great and all collectors like me will welcome it. Enjoy!
B002VPE1AW|5.0|In this day and age, 3D is becoming more and more popular. It began with Journey To The Center of the Earth, then more and more began following the 3D trend.<br /><br />And then came Avatar.<br /><br />Avatar is the project that Cameron has been trying to make his career. 12 years after Titanic, and who would have known he had topped the movie in every single way possible. I went to go see the movie in IMAX on opening weekend with my girlfriend- we got up super early and got to the theater at 9 AM. One interesting note is that there were people dressed as Na'Vi- we thought it was pretty funny and cool! As for the movie: was it worth the hype and the wait?<br /><br />Definitely.<br /><br />Of all films, James has followed his craft spectacularly with Avatar. Remember when we all saw Jurassic Park and were all blown away? Well this is that times a thousand. James creates a spectacular movie with beautiful visuals and a plot that pays homage to similar movies of this plot, like Dances With Wolves, The Matrix, and Pocahontas to name a few.<br /><br />It is the near future. Jake Sully, a paraplegic soldier has awaken from 6 years in cryo. He is chosen to replace his recently deceased brother on a new mission: To travel to Pandora to wipe out the entire population: An alien type species called Na'vi. However, while there, he also discovers the joy of being a Na'vi through a technology that gives people Na'Vi bodies called \\"Avatars\\". While on a mission one day, he is saved by Neytiri, a Na'vi lady who leads him to the village she lives in. After some pretty bad first impressions, Jake begins to slowly assimilate, but finds himself torn between whether or not he should continue the mission or be a Na'vi.<br /><br />This is an excellent movie. At 162 minutes it doesn't feel padded out or fleshed out. J-Cam takes an interesting concept, and crafts it beautifully here. Beautiful visuals, and a wonderful story are to be found here- the movie also compels you to question spirituality in a way you haven't before. The conflict between the Na'vi and Humans is stunning, the relationship between Jake and Neytiri is beautifully handled.<br /><br />Also, like I said, James pays tribute to similar assimilation type movies. Influences from Dances With Wolves, The Last Samurai, Pocahontas and other movies are seen, and it's like when all combined together, they create a beautiful story. People have claimed it is a ripoff of all of those but I couldn't disagree more. Sure it's not the most original movie ever made, but then again what is? nowadays?<br /><br />The only drawback for me is the Leona Lewis song at the end, but other than that, I enjoyed this movie a great deal.<br /><br />IN TOTAL:<br /><br />Entertainment: 10/10<br />Sex: 1/10<br />Violence: tons/10<br />Prettiness: 10/10<br />I want to be a Na'vi: 10/10<br />J-Cam: Welcom back!

B000B8QG4A|3.0|Can you faithfully review a Disney film without being denounced for ruining memories of the youth (and past youth) of today?  Can one say that a Disney film is merely \\"mediocre\\" without getting negative feedback?  Well, today we shall find out.  The Disney factory (using the word factory is an accurate representation) has been creating childhood favorites since the early 30s - and continue to push the boundaries of animation for children today with partnering with the hugely popular PIXAR as well as their most recent outing, \\"The Princess and the Frog\\".  There is no child growing up today that doesn't know the name Mickey Mouse in some form or another - and that is an impressive feat for any studio.  With that said, Disney's normal focus is animating classic fairy tales like \\"Pinocchio\\" or \\"Cinderella\\" or \\"Snow White\\", but sometimes they take a classic tale and rework it using common household animals.  That is the case with \\"Lady and the Tramp\\"; my first Disney animated film to review.  It is the infamous tale of young rapscallion winning the heart of a wealthy woman, but now instead of people - we have dogs.  Made in 1955, this was probably another groundbreaking work for Disney, but watching it now in 2010, it has the feeling of being rushed, underdeveloped, and weak on story.  So, I ask again - could Disney have created a film that was merely \\"mediocre\\"?<br /><br />This reviewer will be the first to admit that the now-popular scene of Tramp and Lady eating spaghetti always pulls at the heartstrings, and was the pull-out-scene of this film, but looking at the film as a whole, it feels like it is missing that Disney magic.  We begin with Lady being given to Darling as a gift one Christmas.  She is an obnoxious puppy who desires the attention of her owners.  Through years of gift giving and love, she finds comfort in the normality of their life.  This is all about to change as our nuclear family decides to add another bundle of joy to the mix.  With skepticism abound, Lady learns to love the changes and the new family.  It is about this time that Tramp enters the picture.  Representing the care-free, baby-less, lifestyle of living without a collar, he demonstrates the power of a small community, but also shows us (the viewers) the darkness surrounding this town.  On the run from both the Pound and a sordid past, he eventually runs into Lady and one could say, \\"...it was love at first sight...\\".  As Darling and Jim Dear embark on a trip, an unknown relative comes to stay with two typecast Siamese cats.  Songs, chases, and rats round out this story, that goes from light to bleak to dark again as Disney creates this seemingly dystopian world for the child audience.<br /><br />I am aware that we all know the story, but the recap was needed to show a point about Disney's use of class and status in this film.  As a casual viewer, many will argue that this is just a children's film - leave it be, but these are the images surrounding our children.  Lady comes from an upper class family, with no worry of consequence; she and her friends go through the day oblivious to the world around them.  Tramp, coming from the other side of the tracks (literally) represents the middle-to-lower class people.  He finds friendship in the shop owners and transients of this town.  What impressed me about this film was how dark and ill-created the lower part of town was, and Disney isn't afraid to show it.  The dirt roads, the black (or darkened) buildings, the fact that a storm arrives just as they head to town; it is night whenever Lady is away from her house.  Let's not forget as well, the rat comes out of a hole with a poster for the circus right above.  This demonstrates another transient profession that is somehow darkened by this film.  The stark use of light and dark in this film is used not only for tone, but also a world outside of the white picket fences and collars.<br /><br />What is the impression handed to children with this imagery?  Ifyou want children or the house with the white picket fence, or safety - you need to be like Lady.  While if you want to see the world, experience life without a collar, one would need to live like Tramp.  What makes this reality odd is Tramp's choice?  To see this point clearer, look at Tramp's \\"friends\\".  Where are they at the end of the film?  Nobody comes to visit, they could be dead (Disney handed us that bleak image near the middle of the film), while the entire time they are speaking of him as a saint and great friend.  Nobody came to bail Pedro, Toughy, or Peg out.  Was this the happy ending we all wanted?<br /><br />With the undertones exposed, how was the remainder of the film?  While it carried some iconic images, the overall pacing of the film was a bit sloppy.  As this is a story with two sets of eyes, we are never quite given a full story on either.  Lady's story is further developed, while Tramp just seems to be inserted for merely the \\"cause and effect\\" storyline.  The voice work was decent in this film.  The 76-minute run seemed nothing like a sprint.  I think it was because I cared nothing for these dogs.  They were beautifully drawn, but more development was needed.  The \\"evil\\" rat was introduced twice, and represented the darkness creeping into suburbia, but it just wasn't enough to pull Lady and the Tramp together.  What did Lady really want in life?  My ending question - why was she denied it?<br /><br />VIDEO:  This is a \\"mediocre\\" Disney film.  It doesn't have the power of \\"The Jungle Book\\", it doesn't have the imagination of \\"Robin Hood\\", it lacks the love like your \\"Princess\\" tales.  When looking for a stronger dog-Disney film, look towards \\"Fox and the Hound\\" - a stronger entry into the canine Disney world.<br /><br />VISUAL:  Disney's 50th anniversary edition claims a stronger restoration of the print, while does look good.  The colors seemed very white in Lady's world, but extra dark in Tramp's life.  The darks were a bit too dark, missing some of the action in these scenes.  Also, the visuals inside of Lady's house seemed bland.  Perhaps this was another symbolic moment, but just \\"ho-hum\\" overall.<br />SOUND:  Very Good.  The songs seemed crisp, the voice work seemed bold.  This was the strongest element of this disc.  The restoration was above average, but the sound was dedicated.<br /><br />EXTRAS:  Again, missing the second disc, I didn't have the chance to fully explore this DVD.  When Disney re-releases it from the Vault, perhaps I will explore the world of \\"Lady and the Tramp\\" further, but for now - the single disc will suffice.<br /><br />Overall, this wasn't a bad Disney movie; it just wasn't one of the greatest.  I felt the symbolism was overbearing as well as the choices made to be a bit misleading for children.  The characters of Lady and Tramp seemed one dimensional at times, lacking in the ability to pull me back into a second viewing.  The songs were low-key and outside of the Siamese cats' duet, forgotten.  Would I recommend this to children?  Maybe - there are defiantly better options.  \\"The Lady and the Tramp\\" will always have spaghetti, but they will not have space on my DVD shelf.<br /><br />Grade: *** out of *****the house with the white picket fence, or safety - you need to be like Lady.

I recommend this series to anyone in order to have an accurate picture of our military's sacrifice to defend our freedom and the lives and freedom of countless others.  This series is worth your time whether you watch it for the purposes of history or entertainment.

B002U6CJCO|3.0|It's been almost two decades since the hugely entertaining UNIVERSAL SOLDIER came out, and action film stars Jean-Claude Van Damme and Dolph Lundgren are a bit grayer now and less buff. This latest addition to the franchise reunites the two, and I'm tempted to compare it to GRUMPY OLD MEN but with more vicious knees to the skull. However, this is a humorless movie and Van Damme and Lundgren spend more time trading in mean-intentioned bear hugs than in dialogue. In fact, for a lead guy, Van Damme isn't in the film as much as you'd think, and Lundgren even less. And the scene they share is basically this one extended brawl.<br /><br />The strengths of UNIVERSAL SOLDIER: REGENERATION all have to do with the action sequences, the fighty fights involving Van Damme, Lundgren, and the two mixed martial arts fighters Mike Pyle (as a merely human commando) and especially Andrei \\"the Pit Bull\\" Arlovski. Arlovski as the main bad guy, with his menacing size, is an imposing fighting machine. Compared to him, Van Damme and Lundgren look mediocre, if spry for their age.<br /><br />But the story kills you with its lethargic pace. The plot kicks off with the abduction of the Ukraine Prime Minister's children and the kidnappers-terrorists taking over the Chernobyl nuclear power plant. The bad guys have gotten hold of an upgraded Universal Soldier (Arlovski), and not even a squad of first generation UniSols can stand up to him. The regular military troops, of course, are like cannon fodder. What's left is ex-UniSol operative Luc Deveraux, long in the tooth and still undergoing rehabilitation thru psychological and medical therapy. Note that this third installment blatantly ignores the events that took place in the first sequel (UNIVERSAL SOLDIER: THE RETURN), so I guess Luc never did have a daughter or a normal life beyond his military and UniSol days.<br /><br />UNIVERSAL SOLDIER: REGENERATION shifts back and forth between Luc Deveraux's reluctantly coming back to the fold and the drawn out hostage rescue ops. And then, nearly an hour into it, Dolph enters the picture, and I guess his character Sgt. Andrew Scott is so tough that he can even survive getting his important bits chewed up in a hay harvester (okay, the film does explain it away by pulling the clone card). It's reassuring to know that some things never change, because the good sergeant is as mentally effed up as ever and I'm only surprised that he doesn't right away start chopping ears off his victims for his grossass necklace. Oh, and there's a bomb.<br /><br />Filmed in Bulgaria and with huge chunks shot in an abandoned industrial plant, there's a bleak, wintry look and feel to the movie. Add in the many slow, momentum-killing moments and also that the stabs at character development are as convincing as the wacky science revolving around the UniSol project, and this Direct-to-DVD film was well on its way to becoming a very shabby sequel. Thankfully, the fighty fights are done well and infuse kinetic energy onto the screen. Weapons are fired, but mostly the UniSols engage in brutal hand-to-hand skirmishes, one of which results in one of the best kills I've seen on film in years.<br /><br />I wonder, though, how exactly is Arlovski's character an upgrade from the first generation UniSols. Far as I can tell, there's that wrist bayonet, and maybe the scientists now feed their subjects more Wheaties so they can grow as tall as Arlovski. Other than that, it's the same-ol', same-ol' zombie soldier. But what they all seem to have in common is the habit of holding their opponent down with one hand while whaling away with the other. Sounds like an MMA move.<br /><br />There's talk of possibly doing another sequel, I guess depending on how this one performs in video sales. I may have dissed UNIVERSAL SOLDIER: REGENERATION a bit, but it honestly isn't as bad as I'd initially feared. Based on it, I'm cautiously for another sequel.<br /><br />The DVD bonus features have the \\"Behind the Lines,\\" which is the Making Of the film segment (almost 19 minutes long), and audio commentary by Director John Hyams and Dolph Lundgren.hich is the Making Of the film segment (almost 19 minutes long), and audio commentary by Director John Hyams and Dolph Lundgren.

1600245617|5.0|Though widely-lauded and well-regarded, I came to 'Child 44' in a slightly different way: I listened to an audiotape rendition of Alexander Goldfarb's excellent memoir, [[ASIN:1416551654 Death of a Dissident: The Poisoning of Alexander Litvinenko and the Return of the KGB]], and was fascinated by Dennis Boutsikaris' amazing reading - he rendered a variety of Russian accents with the highest of nuance, drama and dexterity.  It was an amazing performance.  So, the logical next step for me?  Find out what else Boutsikaris has done.  Answer: his tour de force ends up being his masterful reading of Tom Rob Smith's impressive first novel.  For as good as the book is, the audio CD is easily 2x the experience of a reading.<br /><br />As far as the book itself, it offers a jaw-dropping look into the bleak, paranoiac society that was Stalinist USSR.  Author Smith - just over 25 when he wrote this story - reveals a \\"worker's paradise\\" that is anything but: it's riven by rampant mistrust amongst its citizens, widespread corruption, feckless fealty and brutal repression.  Above all is system founded on the 'presumption of guilt' and the stated ideal that There Is No Crime in this perfect society.  So, when crime does occur, \\"the state\\" looks to sweep even the most brutal of offenses under the rug in order to preserve the falsehood of its metrics.<br /><br />It's under these bizarre circumstances that a mass-killer is allowed to roam the Soviet countryside and kill at will, exploiting the gaps in this perverse system.  Smith loads on detail after detail, all of it fascinating stuff, constructing the plausibility of how this could happen.  The state pins each of the murders on local drunks, vagrants or orphans; the implication being that society is perfect, it's these individuals that are not.<br /><br />In the middle of this insanity, we have the story of Smith's MGB Agent, Leo Demidov - a most flawed hero.  He and wife, Raisa - whose complicated relationship is fully one-quarter of the book (and maybe the best part) - reject the state's theory and instead see the murders as the act of a single killer.  Yet, in this 'hall of mirrors' society, Demidov's efforts and initiative are not rewarded.  Far from it - in fact, he's instead seen as an enemy of the state.<br /><br />Smith has drawn his villain from real-life roots: when you're finished with the book, take a look at articles describing the terror of Andrei Chikatilo, known 'The Butcher of Rostov.'ybe the best part) - reject the state's theory and instead see the murders as the act of a single killer.

1934356476|5.0|This review is by Satoshi Asakawa from Japan, who teaches Ruby Metaprogramming at [...]<br /><br />Why I like this book?<br />I could have written the following code like in C:<br /><br />// C code<br />int main(void)<br />{<br />  int i;<br />  for (i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++)<br />  printf(\\"I love you. \\");<br />  return 0;<br />}<br /><br />But, in Ruby, I can write it more straightforward and simpler -<br /><br /># Ruby code<br />10.times{print 'I love you. '}<br /><br />Ever since I saw this Ruby code, I've fallen in love with Ruby.<br /><br />After that, I've been enjoying reading tutorials and blogs on the Internet which taught me interesting Ruby tips and tricks. However, what I really wanted to get my hands on was Ruby Metaprogramming.<br /><br />I've read various articles on Ruby Metaprogramming, but unfortunately I could not understand them well. Everyone said Metaprogramming is too advanced a feature and too early for me to learn. Then I luckily met this book. I started reading the introduction and the story about Bob and Bill.... and I found that I was getting crazy about this book. After reading the first part, Bob and Bill's whole week story, I felt that I wanted to write Ruby code freely. And felt I may be able to do that...<br /><br />Now I've been reading the second part, Metaprogramming in Rails, again. It's different from the first part. Auther shows us the code which is used in a real project and adds some explanations. I didn't understand it very well on my first read, but after reading and trying out the code again and again, I started becoming comfortable with it.<br /><br />Auther Paolo says the following in an interview with [...]: When you understand metaprogramming, that's the moment when you start \\"thinking in Ruby\\".<br /><br />We'll be able to write Ruby code as well as native language.... Fantastic!! Well, we need to learn more and more about this, but I'm dreaming with this book!

Anne's long, unrequited love was beautifully played out by Hawkins, as was the bitter rejection of Captain Wentworth by Penry-Jones. I continue to be disapointed with the script of this version of Persuasion, but the outdoor scenes were rich with the English countryside.

Bounce was the only album that did have something here and there that still kept some of BJ's rock strenght, but since Crush, BJ showed sings of \\"by bye hard rock, welcome Pop-Rock\\", and it's precisely what this album is, pure pop-rock music. I could not identify with any of the songs, and skipped every single one of them.    I recently whatched their performance at the grammies, and was very VERY dissapointed to what I was looking at. There is nothing left from the hard rock mellow band they used to be. After \\"These Days\\" Jon's voice never sounded as great as it used to. Since then, I think Riche and company have written songs that fitted a lot more to Jon's voice, and at the same time found a confort zone in writing less rocky music. Even though this album does not have quite strong ballads, Jon, as I once heard on the radio, and I quote, is \\"the king of ballads\\", and it wasn't meant as a flattery, and I realy think ballad writng methods are reflected all over their past 3 or 4 albums, with a turn over to rock, which makes a total rock-pop album.    I was able to see them on tour back on the Crush tour, and as live perfomers back then, they still had what they don't have These Days, specialy because Jon's voice has changed so much, and nowadays sounds like if he didn't have the will to sing. The tone does bother me more than ever, and on the album this was something that got me to skipped a lot faster all tracks.    I'll have to stick with the music that I liked in the 80's and early 90's from BJ from now on.

I think its the part mystery, part fiction, mostly Non-fiction writing. He incorporates a lot of fact into his writing & makes us all crave for the next book, to be released ...next year?

B001HVZO9S|1.0|I bought this movie because my husband and I are both band geeks that prefer the old style of high step marching to the \\"corps\\" style.  I must say this movie was HORRIBLE!  Where do I begin?  The acting is so flat and predictable, the main character never grows up, he is disrepectful to EVERYONE and the drum cadences are not that impressive.  The main character Deven is a cocky whiny butt that can't read music...OK, what college would give a scholarship let alone a full ride scholarship to someone that hasn't tried out which includes the ability to sight read!  He whines all during the movie and you actually are rooting against the main character because he is sooo unlikable...unless you want someone that doesn't work at his craft but expects to be handed the world, is cocky and whiney to succeed.  One of the quotes from the movie in regards to how Devon feels about the band director, \\"he needs me, he came all the way to New York for me\\".  Shows how much Devon knows about recruiters...any one with a lick of sense knows recruiters make visits!

1423113497|5.0|Percy Jackson is an ordinary 12-year-old except for dyslexia, ADHD, and his propensity for getting expelled from private schools. He is also being attacked by monsters out of Greek mythology. His mother brings him to Camp Half-Blood where he learns that he is the son of a god and a hero who has to go on a quest. Percy, along with his friends Annabeth (daughter of Athena) and Grover (satyr) must battle gods and mythological monsters as they try to bring Zeus his stolen lightning bolt before the solstice in order to stop the gods from going to war. Excellent adventure for middle grade readers.
0451228731|5.0|Terrific novel as is its sequel, &quot;Freedom.&quot; Gory at times, but its message is important: that technology enables ruthless corporations, with only profit as their goal, to take away individuals' rights across the globe, and that we as citizens of the world must guard against this.<br />The technology described is lots of fun to explore, but also chilling in the nefarious applications it can be used for.<br />Make sure to read its sequel, which is even better.  At the end, a character poses a question, that is thrilling yet harrowing.

B002KANXXE|1.0|When I saw that this was the preferred edition for kindle I presumed that the text would be organised in a way to fit the kindle comfortably. Instead I found that the text does not uniformly fill the page. It is written as a full line follwed by a half line. I had to increase the font size in order to make it slightly less annoying. One thing it taught me is to ALWAYS download the sample chapter first before purchasing and don't presume that 'kindle preferred' means you'll be getting the best one for the kindle. Of course the book itself is brilliant.
B000WM34CM|1.0|Ordered a new book; received an obviously used book, with no dust cover and worn hard cover.  Wrote to the seller, never received an answer.  If I had wanted a used book, it would have cost 4 or 5 dollars.  Paid twenty-five; will never use Amazon again.
B002436WFI|5.0|Until I happened across this being aired on TV, I didn't realize this existed. I had enjoyed [[ASIN:B0010X741Y Hogfather]] and finding this movie was a great surprise. I think it is more magical for me given that I've read most of Pratchett's books and have met and had discussions with him in person.    Watching this movie was like a mini vacation to a fun faraway place.    I think that Sean Astin is brilliant as Twoflower. The role is a difficult one to do successfully and he absolutely nails it! Outside of Lord of the Rings, this is my favorite role he has done.    And then the luggage... perfect! Menacing and mysterious.. really good job of portraying the luggage as I imagined it. For me, the Rincewind character wasn't what I had imagined. Through the movie I grew to like the character and forget my preconceptions.    Overall... I think the typical Pratchett fan will love the movie. I certainly did. If not a fan, I think this movie is still great, just may not be as magical as the experience was for me.
B002ZIAC26|4.0|Beach House has the sort of sound that you'd expect from a band with that name -- languid, vaguely dreamlike pop, full of summer nights, sparkling stars and a twist of reto 60s psychedelica. \\"Teen Dream\\" is a pretty polished product of that sound -- it's basically a string of silvery pop tunes, all of them enjoyable and sweet but with only one real standout.<br /><br />\\"Zebra\\" opens the album like a sunrise -- a languid cycling guitar, and murmured lyrics about a deceptive, exquisite person. \\"You know you're gold, you don't gotta worry none/Oasis child, born and so wild/Don't I know you better than the rest/All deception, all deception from you...\\" It slips easily into the second song, the mellow curling \\"Silver Soul.\\"<br /><br />The songs that follow are mostly in the same vein -- mellotron laced pop songs that reek of the 60s, breathless rustling stretches, peppy beach-party tunes like \\"Used To Be,\\" and sparkly melodies that rattle and shimmer like a jewelry box. And if the first couple songs are sunrise, the final couple of songs are sunset -- a slow, easy descent into the stately \\"Real Love\\"  and the soft, vaguely psychedelic \\"Take Care.\\"<br /><br />\\"Teen Dream\\" is a lot like Beach House's last two albums -- in other words, it's a fairly steady and unwavering little pop album. There are some little speckles of dancy sound or uptempo moments, but a lot of the time it's just a steady stream of mildly psychedelic pop. The biggest flaw is that there's only one real standout song on the album (the alluring epic \\"Walk in the Park\\").<br /><br />In fact, the rest of the songs just bleed into a big satiny expanse, but fortunately they're very sweet, pretty songs. As for the instrumentation, it's all very smooth and seamlessly wound together -- lots of gentle percussion, cycling guitars, plinky keyboard and some tambourine, and colorful pillars of organ that prop up the slower melodies.<br /><br />Victoria Legrand's raspy voice is a bit of a surprise at first, but eventually it sinks into the melodies and becomes a part of them. And while their lyrics have some awkward moments (\\"The heart is a stone and this is a stone that we throw\\"), but otherwise they tend to be a bit surreal and very evocative (\\"The needle along the spinning wheel/Collecting silver coil/It gathers heat without you\\"), with wooden houses, beaches, and lovers who want too much.<br /><br />\\"Teen Dream\\" is a slightly more polished form of Beach House's signature sound -- mellow, sweet and very pretty.

0930289234|3.0|Alan Moore, whenever he is creating characters is brilliant.  It's what he does best.  Like any great writer, Moore's characters have more life and depth to them than some flesh and blood people you'll meet in everyday life.  His ability to create a world for them to live and interact with is equally outstanding.  I was, however, annoyed with Dr. Manhattan's description of his understanding of time.  His explanation of which can be torn apart by a freshman physics major.  More frustrating was Mr. Moore's conclusion, which I have been told he wrote under the stress of D.C. demanding that he just finish.  But I believe that in the way he kills of his most interesting character in the most anticlimactic fashion, misread what a world and American response to a massive and horrifying loss of life, and elevates his least developed character to the position of the most important character of the conclusion to be unsatisfying.  I recommend this book, nevertheless, as I think for all its faults, the Watchmen is perhaps at its best the most intelligent graphic novel I have read and at its worse it is no worse than much else that can be found in any comic book.
B000V9D5LG|5.0|OMG I purchased this lens on e-Bay new for $199.00 (\\"Buy it Now\\").  It arrived today.  This is one light weight and incredibly sharp lens.  Also, the image colors are vivid and true.  With the IMAGE STABILIZER engaged I can get super sharp images at 250mm, with lens wide open, and the shutter speed at 1/30th of a second.  And I'm a 71 year old man.<br /><br />I'm crazy about Amazon.com.  They are really reliable, their merchandise is usually competitively priced, and I like their return policy.  But I do shop.<br /><br />SPECIAL NOTE; Another reviewer writes that using the Canon 58mm tread diameter 250D Closeup Filter (under $100.00), this same zoom lens becomes a fantastically sharp macro lens.  I'm going to go for it next month - after my Social Security Check comes in.  And yes, I will check the price on Amazon.com first.
B002UPA4ZY|5.0|We have always enjoyed Andrea Bocelli, and this DVD was no exception. We played it several times at Christmas, and greatly enjoyed each time.
B002SJIO4A|2.0|I rented this one and did not buy it, thank god.  After I saw it was nominated for best picture I thought hey lets see this one.  What a mistake.  It was just a strage flick to say the least and I did not care for it at all.  I did not like that docu style they used (which never seems to work in any film IMO).  It did seem to get a little better (after the docu style parts ended) the farther into the movie you went but in the beginning I was ready to turn it off.  I might have to also say it was a waste of time.  The sad thing is this thing will no doubt win the oscar for best picture and even worst is the way the flick ended...can you say sequel!!  Oh well, maybe I will watch it again someday, free I hope, and I may have a different opinion about it...but I doubt it.  And as others said it was really gory at times and I even turned away once or twice.  I thought it was a bit silly during the so called eviction part going door to door expecting these things to sign a form.  I also wanted to like this one but from the start I was thinking what is this???  I have not respected the Oscars for years so if this film wins the best picture then that will finalize it for me that the Oscars are bogus.  Berlin Tom have you seen this one yet?

Especially if you are a drummer or you just love good drumming, this album is a MUST!!! If you like Cozy, you might want to check out Rainbow Rising, Rainbow's Long Live Rock and Roll, and Yngwie Malmsteen's Facing the Animal.  Some of his best work.  The Best of Cozy Powell also includes his best solo work. RIP bro!!

B002BSHWUU|5.0|I have recently purchased the trifecta of the enhanced Beatles collection. Stereo Mono and USB...  Yes everyone individually unique, and that why especially for the price in Aud$  The Stereo arrived in Dec 09 and to my surprise, no dvd re the mini documentary.  To cut a long story short, sent it back and Amazon had replaced it with a new one, even getting my postage reimbursed.  I didn't care it was late so that is outstanding service so many thankyous for your service Amazon.    The Mono was the unique one, with the miniature album covers.  Haven't listened to them yet, but judging the responses from you all who have written in, i don't doubt  the quality will be superior...    The USB is so cute :)  Goes well with my large green anodised green apple i brought at the markets.  Loaded it on to a friends computer and looks impressive, and sounds good as well.  I am not going into the tech aspect of the USB as I just happy to have this one, for one being deprived in having the kit and kaboodle re The Beatles.
B00260HH3K|1.0|This movie was just a downright fail. Acting was cheesy, most facts were wrong, it looks like someone made a YouTube video using an HD camera. I have been a Dragon Ball fan for as long as I can remember and I can rightly say that youngsters watching this movie will be turned-off from learning more about Dragon Ball, it's like putting a worm in your apple. Hopefully Dragon Ball Kai makes up for it when kids watch it in Cartoon Network later this year.

B002VKE1K2|5.0|There's a good reason to have a bias against films that employ the \\"we're shooting a documentary and this is real life\\" method. It pretty much failed in \\"The Blair Witch Project\\", though that was nowhere near as terrible a movie as most make it out to be, and it has spawned numerous imitators which don't even deserve mention. But \\"PA\\" is not an example of that. No, the plotline is never honed down to a tee, and no, it's not perfect, but it's better than the majority of the stuff out there.<br /><br />Katie and Micah are a young couple (one of the only things I found hard to believe about this movie is that Micah owns a huge house sack with a boulevard and swimming pool and looks like he's getting his first five o clock shadow). Micah is a businessman, and Katie is an Eng major. Katie has been the victim/conduit of a supernatural force since she was eight years old, and yes, we can safely blame her for getting this poor schmuck involved: as he says, \\"maybe you should have told me on our 100th date that your were haunted by a demon, okay?\\". The premise is no more unbelievable than most horror flicks. Micah is all Wall Street, and let's face it: when Demon meets Wall Street boy, it's going to be love at first sight.<br /><br />Thus he acquiesces to every moronic impulse he has: buying a Ouija which looks less like a Ouija board and more like a \\"Black Red Let's Invite Satan In For the Night\\" piece of cardboard, even after being advised by the entirely believable, hippy dippy parapsychologist to NOT DO THAT. But you have to give the guy a break: he's not an English major, he's a would be member of the Billionaire Boys' Club and he's doing the best he can. (And what was so \\"unbelievable\\" about the \\"psychic\\"? He looks exactly like an aging baby boomer who gave up on trying to change the world and now wants to experiment with \\"different areas of being\\", dig?)<br /><br />This is Hitchcock, so anyone and everyone--I think they're sort of the same group when it comes to people who watch horror movies these days--who want to see stabbings, mutilations, all the new trendy \\"Saw\\" ways we can watch people get tortured to death should stay away and not bitch. The theme is indeed \\"Things That Go Bump In the Night\\". The movie borrows heavily from the Exorcist, as all demon films do, only neither of these characters once has the sense to at least get a book about Catholic theology when it's pretty obvious what they need is a priest. The reason is simple: they are, both of them, already heavily under the influence of whatever is in the house. Micah assents to the thing's will when he starts acting stupid, and even invites it into their bedroom with the powder on the floor. When Katie stands and watches her boyfriend/husband/whatever in the wee hours of the morning and swaggers around, that's the demon. (See? Use your imagination!) Micah swaggers the same way in one of the \\"nighttime\\" scenes. The reason they do not call the demonologist on time and that they cannot handle taking even one sane simple step, like leaving the house, is because Katie's nemesis has begun to infect Micah as well. Nope, they don't act believable all the time, and guess what, sometimes characters in Dostoevsky don't either!<br /><br />They find out far too late what the real problem is, that this entity is a destructive force which wants Micah dead first, then Katie, and to move on. The continuing state of denial before the so-so but ultimately terrifying finale is not because they are stupid (at least not Katie), it is because the demon has gotten everything it wants and then goes in for the kill. It knows there will be no demonologist, no clerical intervention, so it goes buck wild.  Calling Father Merrin would have been a pretty obvious move.<br /><br />The ending could have been more (why the CGI computerized mouth crap? that could have been a classic scene) but nonetheless is pretty scary. It finally has her. I think a mix of the alternate ending and the original wouldhave been appropriate. This is a very, very good horror film, worth owning.ry, very good horror film, worth owning.

I emailed you my complaint and the immediately issued a return address label and said they would send me the SOUNDTRACK right away. The next shipment I got was the same MOVIE as they sent the first time, so I complained again. This time I got a longer email from someone who even provided me the hyperlink to the SOUNDTRACK to \\"Yentyl\\". Then I went to the hyperlink and bought the SOUNDTRACK that I wanted on the first time. I was somewhat disappointed that it took three times to send me my correct order. Every other time I have ordered from Amazon, there was NO PROBLEM and I was extremely satisfied.<br /><br />I was dissatisfied that I received the WRONG order two times in a row.

Yes there's some few cool stuff in it, posters, pictures, etc... but that's all stuff you could get on the net if you look in the right places. Main reason why I bought this, I collect everything from them. Listened to it once, put it back on my collectors shelve and wait that someday it will be worth something. Great piece of collection to own, but the content is less than satisfactory due to the fact that i pretty much know everything about them.  A great gift for their new fan's.

Blowing Britney, Miley, Rihanna, and all of that other crappy autotuned music out of the water, The Fame Monster is a brilliant, dark journey that faces each of the monsters Gaga has confronted on her rise to world domination.

B00003CXA6|5.0|Purchased this for my son-in-law, a semi-serious Civil War buff, but now a busy Naval officer.  Watched it together.  He said it was the most nearly accurate telling of the battle he has viewed.  I only wish I had seen this movie before I visited the actual battlefield years ago.      I thought the language was somewhat stilted, but then, I had to remember that was the way people talked ~150 years ago.  Perhaps some of the portrayals of the Southern leaders came across a bit too strident, but, hey, I have yet to meet a born Southerner that was not passsionate about the topic. Aside: I married into a Virgina family with down-country roots dating back to the early-1800's.    Others watching it thought it ran a bit long, but the battle did take place over 3 days.  Buy it and have an extra bag of popcorn ready to toss into the mircowave.

B0025KVLU6|5.0|The Beatles (aka the White Album, so named for the pure white cover, the first Beatles album cover to be released without the band members' picture on it# is the only official double-disc album the Bealtes made during their career.  Not counting the British EP for Magical Mystery Tour, this is the first album made after the death of their manager, Brian Epstein.  It's also the first album made after their trip to India, and that trip is very much reflected on the album.  The strong Indian influence is felt in such songs as The Continuing Story Of Bungalow Bill, Sexy Sadie #John Lennon's subtle dig at the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi#, and others.  This album is also viewed as the beginning of the end of the Beatles as a recording entity, as much of the music was written individually and basically utilized the other band members as sidemen.    The Beatles contains some of the strongest songs of the group's career, including Paul McCartney's Back In The USSR, George Harrison's When My Guitar Gently Weeps #featuring an uncredited Eric Clapton on lead guitar#, and the original version of Revolution #here titled Revolution 1#.    It also contains the single most bizarre recording in the Beatles' official catalog, Revolution 9 #\\"Number nine...number nine...number nine...\\").  In between are the Beatles trying out various and sundry different song styles, from the then-popular hard blues sound (Yer Blues) to Forties-style pop ballads (Honey Pie) to the closest the Beatles ever came to heavy metal (Helter Skelter).  The last song, along with Revolution 1 & 9, and Piggies, a George Harrison composition on the album, was unfortunately used by mass murderer Charles Manson and his family in the grisly slayings of pregnant actress Sharon Tate (wife of director Roman Polaski) and three others.    As always, there are a few tracks that could probably been left off the album; indeed, the band's producer, Sir George Martin, has been quoted as saying that with a few omissions, this could have been the best single-disc album the band ever made.  In my opinion, though, that would have been sad.  The world would have lost such oddities as Revolution 9, Why Don't We Do It In The Road, and possibly even Ringo Starr's first recorded composition, Don't Pass Me By.  To my mind, the album is perfect as is, and I think is a great starting point for any budding Beatles fan.

B002MJV75O|5.0|LOVED IT!! i had no trouble getting the dvds out of the box and I would definitely recommend buying this group package instead of individually because it's CHEAPER and more CONVENIENT because all the dvds stay together. None of my dvds had scratches or didn't play well. This pack is definitely worth the price!
0385337388|4.0|I work as a database guy at a med school.  One of the doctors recommended this to give me \\"further background\\".  Apparently it's recommended reading for all aspiring MD's. Another of the docs I work with came from the environment mentioned in the book - with some obfuscation.     Originally written some years ago and recently updated it's a reminder that doctors are only human.
B002RSDW80|5.0|I saw this in the theaters twice and realized that I needed to own this movie.  It is so enjoyable to dip into scenes and enjoy the wonderful interplay of the fine acting emsemble.
B000UR9QIK|5.0|Look, these are the actors in the movie okay:    Gaylon Ross, David Emge, Ken Foree, Scott H. Reiniger    I hate it when you screw up who the actors are. By listing support players as the main actors you make a potential customer question whether this is the movie they're looking for.    Next, why include reviews of the movie from other formats? This tells us nothing about the Blu ray, making it necessary to find what the Blu Ray contains elsewhere. The inclusion of other format reviews is pointless, only providing confusion instead of clarity. Stop including reviews from the DVD or theater release or whatever on the Blu Ray page. Please. Unless I go look this up at another site, I know nothing about what my money will buy me, nothing about the picture transfer or sound, nothing about how many cuts of the film are included or what the features are. Please keep the reviews separate. I mean, I don't want to know how The Joshua Treee sounds on vinyl if I'm thinking of buying the CD or MP3 now do I?
B001EN1R2M|5.0|I choose this rating because the CD is good. What I like about the CD is that it is the debut record of American heavy metal band M&ouml;tley Cr&uuml;e; 900 copies were released on November 10, 1981, on the band's Leathur Records  label. What I dislike about the CD is that I wanted to hear more of it. I would recommend this CD to other people.
B0012EJVTY|5.0|Lemme just say that this album is indeed a must-have. I'm familiar w/it from way back in the day when it came out, and I still say it's one of, if not the, best live recordings ever made. This album comes from back when DP held the official Guiness record as the loudest band in the world ('tis true fact_ look it up), and it's definitely true dinosaur rock in its purest form_ THUNDER!! - a cross between King Kong/Jurassic Park cranked up to 11! There's been a gazillion bootlegs of live DP over the years, but this is the real deal, and the best versions of these particular songs you'll ever hear. Ian Gillan/Paice & Jon Lord are true gods of their respective talents, as you will hear on this album. It's been a long time since I've heard the whole record, and I can't wait to get it downloaded; it'll take forever w/my dial-up, but well worth the wait. Definite kudos to Amazon for having it. Again, I give it ten stars, and it's definitely an album I'd wanna have in my my top ten if ever stranded on a deserted island. I say buy it folks, for sure_ but only if you're gonna listen to it at FULL volume, cuz that's what it truly deserves!

0061537969|5.0|I loved the concept of the book, the dog telling the story. It is well written, great visuals, amazing emotion inthe entire story. A quick read, even with stops to sniffle adn cry and blow my nose...but there is a happy ending. I hope they make a movie out of this one!
B000MNP2KI|5.0|I choose this rating because the movie is good. What I like about the movie is that in Casino Royale introduces James Bond before he holds his license to kill. But Bond is no less dangerous, and with two professional assassinations in quick succession, he is elevated to “00” status. “M”, head of the British Secret Service, sends the newly-promoted 007 on his first mission that takes him to Madagascar, the Bahamas and eventually leads him to Montenegro to face Le Chiffre, a ruthless financier under threat from his terrorist clientele, who is attempting to restore his funds in a high-stakes poker game at the Casino Royale. “M” places Bond under the watchful eye of the Treasury official Vesper Lynd. At first skeptical of what value Vesper can provide, Bond's interest in her deepens as they brave danger together. Le Chiffre's cunning and cruelty come to bear on them both in a way Bond could never imagine, and he learns his most important lesson: Trust no one.  What I dislike about the movie is that I wanted to see more of it. I would recommend this movie to other people.
B000QCQ8XA|5.0|How to Talk to a Widower has about eighty-seven unexpected turns. Poor Doug's story is an amazing tale of loss, anxiety, family tensions and humor. A perfectly blended cast of characters play out this story, painting a portrait of the defective condition Doug finds himself in.<br /><br />Tropper made this story flow like a silver stream. Doug's psychology was just as it should have been, having suddenly lost his wife and inherited a step-son not many years younger than he. That being said, I was surprised by the storyline so many times that I couldn't put my Kindle down. I HAD to find out what happened next.<br /><br />About halfway through the book Doug goes on a blind date, encapsulated in one full chapter. All I'll say about that chapter is that it was written with a level of genius I haven't seen before. Aside from the climactic final chapters, that was my favorite part of the story. The book would not have been the same without it.
0810994739|5.0|Great little books for young boys. Explains in a comical way situations that young boys go through on a daily basis. From dealing with an older brother to embarassing ordeals at school. Helps boys realize that they aren't the only ones that these things happen to. The author does a great job of expressing the realistic dealings of a day to day life. Reads just like a journal of a boy who goes through one life journey after another. Is a great addition to the other books from this series.
1878424319|5.0|If only everyone would make these 4 agreements with themselves we would all have a lot less hurt in the world. I have only spent about 5 evenings reading this book and I am about 3/4 finished.  It is an easy read, but full of information that we would all benefit from implementing.  I would love to get every one of my friends and family to read this book.
B002PMV9K6|5.0|I choose this rating because the movie is good. What I like about the movie is that as Lord Voldemort tightens his grip on both the Muggle and wizarding worlds, Hogwarts is no longer a safe haven. Harry suspects perils may even lie within the castle, but Dumbledore is more intent upon preparing him for the final battle fast approaching. Together they work to find the key to unlock Voldemort's defenses and to this end, Dumbledore recruits his old friend and colleague Horace Slughorn, who he believes holds crucial information. Even as the decisive showdown looms, romance blossoms for Harry, Ron, Hermione and their classmates. Love is in the air, but danger lies ahead and Hogwarts may never be the same again.  What I dislike about the movie is that I wanted to see more of it. I would recommend this movie to other people.
0446569895|5.0|I am so happy to have read a book about Ozzy that was in his own words! I have been a fan since Diary of a Madman and have read just about everything written about Ozzy. But I always wanted to read Ozzy's take on himself. His own words. This book answered my prayers in full!!!     First off, whether you are a fan and have read books, seen biographies on Ozzy, or heard stories about any of his many tales of hard partying, you will still be entertained by this book. Thanks to Chris Ayres ability to make it seem like Ozzy is sitting beside you sharing his life; you will not be able to put this book down! When I got to the end of a chapter I would think \\"just one more page, just one more page\\"     Next, there are so many stories in here that I believe you will read about something you didn't know. I couldn't believe how much info was in this book!  Even though there are many sad things in this book (death of Randy, Jack's comment about missing his dad) I couldn't help but laugh out loud many times! I even marked several pages so I could go back and reread the stories and laugh out loud again!     Though his addictions are sad to me, I feel Ozzy does an awesome job of expressing his feelings about addiction and coping day to day!!!    Finally, I love Ozzy and can't wait when something new comes out by him! I was so excited about this book and now having read it I feel so happy that I had the chance! This is another masterpiece by the Prince of Darkness. Thank you so much Ozzy!!!
B001FB4VXU|5.0|Terrific entertainment value - this is currently the best sit-com in production, and many of these episodes are instant classics!<br /><br />Worth every cent - recommended without reservation!
0140143505|2.0|I had never heard of this book.  I came across a mention of it in Wendy Werris's AN ALPHABETICAL LIFE, in which she praises it lavishly:<br /><br />\\"Above all, 84 CHARING CROSS ROAD by Helene Hanff finally came out in paperback.  This is one of my best-loved books of all time, and if you haven't discovered it yet I recommend it with my whole heart.  Told through a series of smart and witty letters, it's the true tale of a New York bibliophile during World War II and her relationship with the owner and staff of a used bookshop in London.  I placed this book in more hands while I wored at Campbell's than any other in my career.\\" (p. 36)<br /><br />Well, Wendy Werris, I really didn't get much out of it.  The chief problem is that, unlike such witty epistolary novels as DADDY LONG-LEGS, there appear to be several letters missing.  Occasionally Helene or the bookshop will refer to business that wasn't in any of the previous letters.  This is disorienting.  They had to have been communicating in some other way, such as by phone.  Either that somebody misplaced a good number of the letters.<br /><br />I'm not sure what I was supposed to get out of it.  The letters reveal Helene's character nicely (no wonder she sought to print them), but reveal the Brits to be unimaginative and interchangeable.  They take orders for books, deal with misunderstandings, and express gratitude for Helene's gift packages during the time of rationing.  Why is this supposed to be worth my attention?<br /><br />I spent about half the book wondering if the letters were real.  They are.  The book probably would have been better if Ms. Hanff had slightly fictionalized the letters, as what you have is occasionally so elliptical as to be jarring.<br /><br />By the way, it's short.  Real short.  About 94 pages.
B001FB55HQ|5.0|I choose this rating because the movie is good. What I like about the movie is that in the aftermath of Judgment Day and the takeover by the machines, John Connor, the destined leader of the human resistance, must counter Skynet's devastating plan to terminate mankind. As Connor rallies his underground street fighters for a last, desperate battle, he realizes that to save the future he must rescue his own father, Kyle Reese. But the most shocking discovery comes with the arrival of Marcus Wright, a mysterious loner from the past who challenges Connor with an impossible choice that will determine the future of the human race leading them both on a brutal journey into the very heart of the enemy.  What I dislike about the movie is that I wanted to see more of it. I would recommend this movie to other people.
B00005JPD0|5.0|This \\"movie\\" is a real gem, in same raw with La Jetee\12 monkeys, and it's underrated too. Must have.
1906694176|5.0|Great read.  Good ending to the series.  Wish the aurthor was still around to do another book.
B0030GJ50C|4.0|Great movie. A completely different approach. There are reviews on here that put the movie down but they can't offer any reasonable example why. I'm just guessing that they aren't even sci-fi fans to begin with. \\"The worst movie I ever watched\\", lmao. I wonder how many reviews one person uses that phrase in. The movie is one of those that make you think about right and wrong and hate the idea of oppression. Compassion. Why do people hate and fear something they don't understand? That is what this movie is about.
B00005JLSE|5.0|I choose this rating because the movie is good. What I like about the movie is that winner of six Academy Awards (2002) including Best Picture and starring Academy Award, Best Actress nominee and Golden Globe Best Actress winner Renee Zellweger, Academy Award Best Supporting Actress winner Catherine Zeta-Jones, Academy Award Best Supporting Actress nominee Queen Latifah, Golden Globe Best Actor winner Richard Gere and Academy Award, Best Supporting Actor nominee John C. Reilly Chicago is a dazzling spectacle cheered by audiences and critics alike! At a time when crimes of passion result in celebrity headlines, nightclub sensation Velma Kelly and spotlight-seeking Roxie Hart both find themselves sharing space on Chicago's famed Murderess Row! They also share Billy Flynn, the town's slickest lawyer with a talent for turning notorious defendants into local legends. But in Chicago, there's only room for one Legend! Also starring Lucy Liu. What I dislike about the movie is that I wanted to see more of it. I would recommend this movie to other people.
B002LK3DUQ|5.0|This is one of the best movies I have seen in a long time.  Up will take you on a trip, not only from North America to South America, but in time.  As you follow along, from a couple of kids following a dream to a dream come true.  And along the way you may realize that this is like your own life.  Of course, this begs the question, how will your life turn out?
B0026OE2NY|5.0|This is an astonishing production.  Using a compilation of awe-inspiring, Planet-Earth-like video clips, it creates a narrative about the history of the planet.  The central focus is that of mankind's revolutionary capabilities to extract resources and how that has affected natural systems of balance that have made human, animal and plant life possible.  It is an elegant blend of scientific facts (that won't overwhelm those who aren't much for science), breathtaking images of exotic and familiar landscapes (that will move young, old, educated and uneducated), and substantial analysis that will leave all viewers (even global warming skeptics) with plenty of food for thought.  For that reason, it's considered #10 on the International Movie Database's (IMDB) Best Documentaries of All Time list (as of Feb 2010).        I am an educator and am excited to share this with students, friends and family.  I strongly encourage you to buy it, rent it from your library (or inter-library loan system) or download the torrent/rapidshare file.      (I also encourage you to write a review to help potential viewers of this in their decision to view it.  I say this only because I see that I'm the first to review it on Amazon).
0385532458|5.0|John Grisham's first collection of short stories is a winner. He is a master storyteller in the tradition of such writers as Mark Twain. They quickly paint you a picture that on the surface is relatively simple, but in reality is very complex. We are shown a wide range of emotions and characters. The humor of country boys getting caught up in the not so big city. A quiet town lawyer who just may have a chance to change his life for ever. An older man who learns to gamble it all for the woman he loves. A sympathetic hustler who with a few kind acts, shows more compassion for his marks than their families ever did. A story of prejudice, ignorance and fear that builds a bond between two unlikely people. We would be very happy to see more short stories from this magnificent storyteller. Other fine reads:[[ASIN:0440243831 The Innocent Man]]; [[ASIN:0812971183 The Best Short Stories of Mark Twain (Modern Library Classics)]]
B002T9H2L0|3.0|I really love the movie. BTW: The German Blu-Ray comes in a cool steel book box and has two additional scenes (see screen shots here: [...]) that are NOT in any other release, also with more subtitle options and it is a limited edition, already oop (try the bay).
0142410373|5.0|My seven year old son and I are big fans of Roald Dahl.  We both loved this book, and especially the vivid characterizations.  Matilda herself is such a great strong child character, rivaling James, in \\"James and the giant peach\\".  She's a wonder and has joined our family dramas along with her beloved teacher, Miss Honey, and the villainous head mistress, Miss Trunchbull.
B00337KM2S|4.0|George Clooney stars in this well done character study written and directed by Juno director Jason Reitman. It touches on things like the cold and clinical world of Corporate America, self-imposed isolation and self examination.    Clooney plays Ryan Bingham, a man working for a company that is contracted by various other companies around the country to be more or less hatchetmen and fire employees when the client company's own executives are too chicken to do it themselves. Confused? Of course, it's Corporate America, what do you expect? Ryan flies all over the country going from one corporate office to another giving out the pink slips. His job is to master the technique of making it easy for the target employee. In the film's beginning, we see a collage of a variety of reactions from the employees, the crying, the anger and in a hilarious cameo by The Hangover's Zach Galifianakis, that rare occurence of an employee who decides to arm himself.    Ryan has become quite content with his work and has become quite good at it as well. But he's not really content at firing people, he's content at the fact that all this constant traveling allows him to escape any possible serious comittment with anyone. He has a philosophy of being free of permanent relationships that he preaches at seminars on the side. This philosophy is put to the test when he encounters two women, an up and coming young co-worker who has her own thoughts on relationships, and a fellow traveler Ryan meets and developes a casual relationship with only to later discover a startling revelation about her. This makes him have second thoughts on his own philosophy. Both women are played by Anna Kendrick and Vera Farmiga (The Departed) respectfully.    The film is well done with acting kudos to the whole cast, but the real stand out to me is newcomer Anna Kendrick. She's up for an Oscar on this one, and I won't be surprised if she gets it. Reitman's quirky rapid editing direction fits well with the film along with some great cinematography.    All in all, this is a good character study that probes into why some people choose to isolate themselves even in the most crowded environment. I always like a film that can make you think and this one certainly does. Chalk up another winner for Reitman.

B00000J7A2|4.0|Captain Beefheart is truly an overlooked genius. Safe As Milk has to be one of the most interesting debut albums I've ever heard. The album's sound is raw and fills your speakers up. The Captain's Magic Band back him up on these twelve songs. \\"Sure Nuff n Yes I Do\\" is a great little blues song while \\"Zig Zag Wanderer\\" might be the better album opener. \\"Electricity\\" is easily one of Beefheart's best. How can you not love the way he just snarls \\"ELEC-TRIC-ATEE!\\". \\"Abba Zaba\\" is neat while \\"Autumn's Child\\" showcases Beefhearts raspy vocals. Overall, you got a great debut album.

B001BPJJ82|5.0|I ran across this movie accidentally one day, am I'm so glad I did. It is one of the best little known movies I've ever seen. The cinematography is epic, the directing is brilliant, and the story is wonderful. This is definitely on my list of all time favorites. A truly a visionary work of art.     Thank you Tarsem!
B000005JA8|4.0|It's one of those albums you either love or hate. If you hated it at first, it may haveve grown on you. After a first listen, I thought Trout Mask Replica was a great album. There are some parts of me that likes it more than Safe As Milk when it comes to artistic freedom. Captain Beefhart had plenty of that with songs like \\"Frownland\\" \\"Hair Pie\\", \\"Neon Meat Dream of a Octofish\\", and \\"Old Fart at Play\\". The album is musically great like Safe As Milk. Songs such as \\"Ella Guru\\", \\"Moonlight on Vermont\\", \\"Pachuco Cadaver\\", and \\"Hobo Chang Ba\\" are a few examples. Also, you got Frank Zappa himself producing this. However, the album is 78 minutes (which can luckily fit onto one CD). The listener could grow tired of it as to Safe As Milk, it was a good half-hour deal. Still when you look at it all together, Trout Mask Replica is a fantastic album. There'll probably never be another album like it again.
B000B8QG22|5.0|This dark comedy (starring Robin Williams) tells the story about a radio host in Viet Nam as he befriends a Vietnamese boy, only to find out that their friendship is shrouded by the effects of the Viet Nam war.
B001DD63UO|5.0|I love this CD!  \\"So What\\" rocks and his a great singable dancable beat- the rest of the cd is great as well.  You can't go wrong with Pink and this is a suberb album to showcase her talent.
B0012GMX3I|2.0|While there are a few good songs here, most of this tacky collection of WET songs (tears,rain,hot tubs, bath tubs--you get it?)was spawned of the 70s sexfest. We get photos of Barbra in her hot tub in California. OMG! Is she naked?  You mean she's a sexual being?  Oh, Lord.  But \\"Niagara\\" almost saves this album from being total trash--it is romantic without being maudlin. Most of the other songs would be  forgettable if it were not for her voice, which is at its technical best here. She was in her 30s--so that makes sense. The problem is her taste. The disco song, \\"Enough is Enough,\\" was a huge hit and it is fun, with Donna Summers and Barbra wailing at the top of their lungs. Mercer's classic \\"Come Rain or Come Shine\\" is sung superbly, but ruined by the synthesizer trying to modernize it. This album, like many of her pop collections is dated, which is the problem. Streisand's voice is classic, and is wasted on trying to make a buck.  So--buy it used ONLY for as low a price as you can get--if you must. It, like SUPERMAN, should be forgotten.
0385341008|5.0|A wonderful story with love, humor and some fascinating but little known history. Loved it.
0307454541|4.0|I was impressed w/this book.  It took a 100 or so pages to get into it, and it times, it's a bit cliche (for a murder mystery), but Larsson presents some exciting twists & turns to the various story lines.  I look forward to reading the other two books in the series.

0307269760|1.0|I just don't understand all the years of adoration for the works of this author.  Is it the bandwagon effect?  (And. believe me, as a fellow author, I am loathe to write this review).  Take the opening story, \\"The Dimensions\\"  - a great concept executed extremely poorly and with a very very contrived ending.  The other stories in this college, though well written at time, completely failed to engage - at least me.      Perhaps it is me.  Can the rest of the world be wrong.  Can The New Yorker, who publishes anything written by her (and some others) be wrong??????  Or is it just another version of politics making the wrong choices of human achievement?

159562015X|5.0|This book contains the 34 basic strengths that were introduced and explained in great detail in \\"Now, Discover Your Strengths.\\" That book does an excellent job explaining how talents, skills, and strengths differ from each other and is a mandatory read. I would recommend reading it before purchasing this Strengths Finder 2.0 book.  This book rehashes the basic description of those 34 strengths, but it also adds some insightful commentary for each strength as to how it manifests itself. This book also has the code for the 'updated' StrengthsFinder test, which shows you your top 5 strengths. Just be aware - you don't get access to the order of your other 29 unless you pay lots of money for it.
0307454541|4.0|Synopsis: Mikael Blomkvist is a financial journalist who has recently been convicted of aggravated libel of industrialist Hans Wennerstrom. Henrik Vanger is the head of the powerful Vanger Corporation, haunted by the disappearance of his niece, Harriet Vanger, decades ago. Henrik employs Mikael to review the evidence of the disappearance, convinced he will be able to help solve the mystery. Lisbeth Salander is an enigmatic security specialist originally hired by Vanger to provide information on Mikael, but who becomes further involved and assists Mikael in the investigation. The Vanger family history is more complicated than Mikael and Lisbeth could have imagined and the truth is more disturbing and dangerous than they are prepared for.<br /><br />As a general rule, I really don't enjoy crime thrillers, they are just not my cup of tea. While I don't generally have a problem with violence in books, I'm not really into stories where violent acts and murder (usually against women) are the crux of the tale. I had thought I wouldn't read this book because of the genre, but I had heard such good things about it from reviews and friends who have read it I decided to put it on my TBR list, although it sat waaaaayyy down the bottom. Then the other day I got a voucher to purchase it for half price so I thought what the hey, I'll give it a read. Strangely, I really enjoyed this book, even though it reconfirmed for me that crime thrillers are not my thing. The depth of detail Larsson uses to create his characters gives the reader a visual sense of their life and the world they live in. I really love Salander as a character, Larsson has done a brilliant job of describing the world of a person with Asperger's syndrome from their own point of view. A small part of me groans at the stereotypical-ness of the fact that she is a genius, yet she really is a great and unique woman and one you SERIOUSLY don't want to mess with. The scene of her revenge against her abuser alone is worth reading the book for.<br /><br />The large host of characters and many plot lines are what makes this book better than alot of other crime thrillers, Larsson keeps them clear and easy to follow and completes every part of the story, nothing is left unresolved. If you are a fan of crime thrillers you will undoubtedly love this book, if you are like me and they aren't your favourite genre I would still recommend stepping outside your genre square and give it a try. I have put the other two books on my TBR list and am looking forward to finding out more about Salander and Blomkvist.the book for.

B002SJIO5E|4.0|I recall film critic Andrew Sarris giving a lecture about the revolutionary nature of \\"Night of the Living Dead,\\" produced for mere thousands with amateur actors and a single \\"premise\\" rather than a plot.  More importantly, it started out, practically from the first frame, with terrifying shots, scaring the wits out of spectators, and seemingly going from one higher climax to another with no ultimate climax in sight.<br /><br />But excise the \\"action\\" scenes from \\"Living Dead,\\" and all that's left is a lot of dead time and empty space, with nothing of consequence happening on the screen or in the viewer's mind. But not to worry. The sequels reduced the down time, with Romero taking the premise to ridiculous extremes, providing non-stop violent action from the very first frame and with little if any let-up. Then came the \\"Evil Dead\\" series of Bruce Campbell-Sam Raimi, which somehow managed to go even further with the continuum of violence and suspense, so much so that, like the later \\"Living Dead\\" films, the so-called suspense becomes so outrageous that the line between horror and humor is frequently blurred if not obliterated.  But such campiness is apparently the last thing some fans of \\"District 9\\" want to hear.  Even \\"Invasion of the Body Snatchers,\\" a political thriller if there ever was one, would no doubt be preferred by those who see \\"District 9\\" as remarkably sui generis, non-intertextual, beyond comparison. There is no shortage of formulaic movies that \\"District 9\\" can be compared with, though one has to agree that \\"Psycho\\" or \\"Vertigo\\" isn't one of them.  The transformations of Norman and of Madeleine amount to highly disturbing moments of self-descovery to the spectator who has identified with either character, so totally that the experience is unshakeable yet unavoidable: without their metamorphoses into the hidden \\"other\\" persona of each, the movies and their spectators would both be incomplete.<br /><br />A second viewing reinforces the conclusion that  Bomkamp deserves to be applauded for producing one of the fine films of the past 5-6 years.  He's a daredevil, a movie lover, and apparently a thinker.  Yet if risk deserves any awards, \\"There Will Be Blood\\" is the sort of film one doesn't expect to see produced any more.  There will always be audiences of all ages for \\"District 9\\"'s, but you could never say the same for Hitchcock's \\"Vertigo,\\" Altman's \\"Nashville,\\" and Anderson's epic film of national self-scrutiny.  They demand analysis and interpretation; \\"District 9\\" plays O.K. without it.<br /><br />What intrigues about the film is its ability to hold the audience' attention.  How can a roller-coaster thrill-ride be constantly engaging without pacing, without the moment of anticipation as the cart rises pending its precipitous free fall and screams?  In this film suspense and horror are largely subordinate to violence, action, revulsion (much of it reminding me of the popular medical \\"freak shows\\" on cable TV), and confusion (the contending parties at times become almost too many for the viewer to keep track of--which works to keep the viewer slightly off balance, as if in a tense, vertiginous state).  To suggest, as some reviewers have, that all of the engrossing action has an intricate or even broad allegorical meaning that will be apparent to the majority of viewers is merely to invite incredulity among those of us who do not find such science fiction spectacles to be all that profound, mind-altering, or even provocative.  (Kubrick invited interpretation--in fact, required serious reflection of the viewer of \\"2001: Space Odyssey\\" for the film to accumulate the power of serious literature.  David Lynch accomplished the improbable: making us love as a brother a fellow specimen who, alongside an elephant, is by far the greater alien; and in \\"Blue Velvet\\" he constructs a narrative positioning the viewer to choose between judging what he's seen as pornography or as an exceptionally graphic, modern version of \\"Young Goodman Brown.\\"  The viewers I can find who have seen \\"District 9,\\" on the other hand, seem to remember little about the film in particular but recommend it in general as \\"wild,\\" \\"over-the-top\\" entertainment and inventive, resourceful film-making--which still places it short of significant art or, for that matter, fascinating storytelling let alone in-depth character study.<br /><br />The film is capable of holding the spectator's interest thanks to the rapid editing, mix of film stock, shaky hand-held camera shots, and construction of the prawn-like, insect-like aliens.  Like the \\"Living Dead\\" films and the cold war thrillers (from \\"Body Snatchers,\\" \\"Manchurian Candidate,\\" etc.) the potential for political allegory is there but, even less than the Romero films' portrayal of the paranoia incited in the conservative establishment by the flower-child revolt of the '60s--later revealed as a new \\"consumer power\\"), it fails to deliver on this promise.  80% of the film's dialogue is made up of a single 4-letter word, which is not sufficient to give the spectator a picture of an intolerant or totalitarian state.  To the viewer who makes the effort, the film brings out the degree to which, even as we put forth the appearance of humanitarianism and equal rights, we alienate ourselves through greed, self-interest, and a narrow, selfish pride.  The result is that we eventually become aliens ourselves, as the film's last shot so memorably discloses, allowing us room to interpret which of two creatures is the greater alien.<br /><br />Creditably, even in Wikus' transformation into the apparent alien, we sense some room for sympathy for this creature of metal, steel, and electronic circuitry.  And unlike so many of his cousins in other sci-fi dystopias, he has not been victimized by technology.

B002ZTQVGQ|5.0|As a long time fan of Hayao Miyazaki, I was overjoyed when I learned that he had created yet another one of his masterpieces, and now it's going to be released at the beginning of next month!     I actually had the chance to watch the full movie before I bought it,   and I have to say it's just as charming, sweet and at the same time entertaining as any other of his masterpieces. In fact, I am in college and I'd rather watch this movie than Princess Mononoke sometimes (even though Princess Mononoke was a stellar film also). Once again we see that he has placed an ecological lesson for us in the guise of a children's movie which is wonderfully delightful if you're a grown up kid as well. That's perhaps the best part of this movie: it doesn't just entertain, but it brings up important issues that we in the real world cannot afford to ignore.     Ponyo is not only irresistibly adorable, she is a very determined little goldfish whose desire is to be human, which I think too many people take for granted. FIve year old Sosuke is beyond precious in his efforts to take care of Ponyo, and both children can bring you back to a time when everything was much simpler.     And then of course, there's the part that Miyazaki-sensei is known for more than anything: the sheer beauty of his work. Even though this is a children's movie, no corners were cut in the animation of this film, in my opinion.  Just the opening scene alone of the jelly fish rising in the ocean is mesmerizing to say the least.      Now having said that, I only have one warning: DON'T LISTEN TO THE DUB!     Well, the Disney dub was at best OKAY, but it was certainly no substitute for the original actors.     To conclude without revealing too much, this movie is a must have for any Hayao Miyazaki fan, or anybody who's never even heard of him before.

1881273156|5.0|A friend recommended this book to me while we were discussing books in general.     I bought a copy from Amazon, on spec, and found it well worth the cover price.    Gary Chapman's analysis and view of love languages is really all about how people, couples in particular, communicate in their daily lives.    The basis of the text is that if people learn to communicate with each other, using the correct languages, then many of the large, and small, points of conflict will disappear.    I wish I'd heard of it sooner; in fact I wish I'd seen it years before it was even published!    I thoroughly recommend this to any couples who are just starting out on a long term relationship (I'm just about to order a copy to give to my daughter) and to those whose relationship has survived for a long time (whether or not they are having trouble).    Well worth a read...

0061122416|5.0|I read this book about a week and a half before starting chemo therapy and it really put a smile on my face. Though the lessons shared here may not be new as others have pointed out, its presentation and lightheartedness make it a great read and easy to grasp. It's engaging story offers material for you to ponder.<br /><br />On several instances I had to close it mid page to give it some thought. Great metaphors are abundant but often times Coelho just spells it out right there on the page for you. I went through the questions at the end which were also nice.<br /><br />I agree with the concept that the best way to get what you want is to want what you have, and honestly I could type several paragraphs on the messages from this. This book is going to mean different things to different people, but in short the importance for my life was on people (I'm a home-body) , as well as placing equal value on the journey as well as the destination. Great considerations for a \\"grass is greener...\\" kind of guy like me, and this served as one among life's many reminders to remember and practice those lessons.<br /><br />Whenever you are talking about happiness and life's dreams it is hard for religion and spirituality not to intertwine. I do not consider this a secular, worldly, or any type of confirming/non confirming religious statement in any way. No matter what your faith system is this book leaves spaces for it to relate to you. The subjects \\"the soul of the world\\" and \\"the hand that writes everything\\" are analogies for you to perceive as you please.<br /><br />I recommend this book anyone, it is a good story, and deeply thought provoking. I'm not giving it 5 stars because I think it is  \\"the fiber of man kinds being\\", I just think it has some important yet simple wisdom (albeit old as some reviews complain), presented in a great way, that everyone should consider. A lot of friends I have (and myself) would be better off if they considered things like this more often; appreciating the small things in life, but alas knowing is not the same as doing.<br /><br />I plan on keeping this and revisiting it in the future. It is a story that really made me think, and smile, I literally laughed out loud when I read the last paragraph, then I thought about it over a long hike with my dog, I like that in a book., but alas knowing is not the same as doing.

I can hardly put it in a category.....but it's HEAVILY influenced by Rock.  And I love it!  Much kudos to Wayne for stepping out of the box with this CD. The lyrics are heavy and creative.  The music is great!  Great to rock out with.  I think he's going to change the game with this album.  Hopefully it can force other rappers to step out of their boxes and do something more creative...and different.

B002PMV9FG|3.0|Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince is the next to last in the series about the young wizard who is fated to fight the forces of the dark wizard, Lord Voldemort. Earlier films were closer to the story in the book than is this. I admit that as the books got longer it became more difficult to put everything into a 2 hour or so movie.    But this book does hit the high spots, despite some wasted time in scenes not in the book. If you are not familiar with the books and earlier movies you should probably go watch the earlier movies first to get the necessary background to appreciate what is happening.    Harry is asked to secure a vital memory from one of his teachers, a memory that will help Hogwarts headmaster Dumbledore and Harry find a way to stop the evil Voldemort from renewing his war on the wizarding community. Meanwhile, Harry is given a Potions textbook with extensive notes by someone calling himself the HalfBlood Prince. These notes allow Harry to excel at Potions for the first time in his Hogwarts career, to the annoyance of Hermione Grange, witch without peer at the school.    But the Prince, it seems, is not entirely a good wizard....    But more would spoil the story.    The last Potter film will be out soon and you might want to wait until that is available and get the set of 7 that will most likely have tons of extra material. But if, like me, you missed Half-Blood Prince in the theaters this is worth the money.
0596009208|5.0|When I first head of Java, I became very interested in the programming language and started looking for good books and resources to learn it, I tell you, it was a hard road, but I finally found Head First Java.    The book consider you're a beginner on programming and want to learn Java, if that's your case, go ahead, there's no better book to do it.     It starts with very basic concepts of objects, structured programming going to methods, API, classes, interfaces, inheritance, polymorphism and advanced concepts like RMI(Remote Method Invocation), Threads and sockets. But what's best: It covers these topics in a very friendly way, don't expect this book to be that thick books with text only, no, almost every page got a picture to illustrate what they're trying to explain and they know what they're doing, author Kathy Sierra has good knowledge of meta cognition, that is, she knows how the brain \\"learn\\".    The negative point could be that it doesn't cover databases and some topics are covered superficially, but I think with the basic knowledge of that concept, you can learn the rest yourself.    A great book, very recommended! 5 Stars, no doubt.
B000001GYC|5.0|Frankly, my wife and I have never been big Mendelssohn fans.  But when we heard SONG WITHOUT WORDS played by Daniel Barenboim, we literally stopped what we were doing and sat down and listened.  We then hopped up to check the XM radio receiver to find out to which incredible composer we were listening, and were shocked to find we were transfixed by Mendelssohn.  We both agreed that we HAD to have that recording.<br /><br />It's a true bargain:  Deutsche Grammophon quality, 2 CDs with (to my knowledge) all of the SONGS WITHOUT WORDS, and of course the incomparable artistry of Barenboim.  We have had to discipline ourselves not to listen to it too often, so that we don't become inured to the beauty of the compositions.

Maybe I'm too old or maybe I like GOOD literature too much to be taken in.   Great writing it isn't!   I kept thinking perhaps \\"Janet Evanovich\\" was a pen name for some adolescent boy in my former middle school English class.   The ending took the cake.

B002EWD08Q|3.0|First off - the first two albums (Whatever People Say...& Favorite Worst Nightmare) from the Arctic Monkeys are amongst my top 10 favourites. So naturally when Humbug came out, I like many others, bought it immediately.    I have really tried to like this album, but after a dozen listen-throughs, I cannot get into it. I find myself in the same listening situation every time - the album starts playing and before I know it I'm on the 7th track. All the songs sort of bleed into each other, and not one of them for me was particularly memorable.    Now, if this were a completely different band altogether I might have a different opinion. But, going in expecting something like their earlier work just ended up in a real disappointment. I so desperately wanted to hear a guitar riff or a solid drum solo to sink my teeth into.    The Arctic Monkeys are mixing up their sound and some people may like this, maybe even better than their early work! Any which way, be sure to have a listen before you buy the whole CD - I certainly wish I had.

1594488843|4.0|In \\"Drive:  The Surprising Truth About What Motivates US,\\" author Daniel H. Pink surmises a future where Frederick Taylor's mechanical rigid top-down management principles of reward and punishment (as embodied in Ford's assembly line) are supplanted by organic flexible principles that value the diversity and individuality of professionals.  Managers and entrepreneurs will find this a thought-provoking read, but they -- including the author -- will struggle to find ways to actually implement the author's refreshing insights into the workplace.    Mr. Pink begins by discussing how humans have been thought to be motivated:  the biological drive (the need to eat and the desire to mate), and the social drive (the carrot and stick principle of rewards and punishment).  What behaviorial psychologists have now discover is that there is a third drive that cannot be fathom or explained.  What propels programmers to create open source software such as Firefox and individuals to contribute at their cost to projects such as Wikipedia?  Mr. Pink believes it's because above all individuals want to feel as though they have control over their lives (\\"autonomy\\"), be engaged and passionate about what they're doing (\\"mastery\\"), and believe in a higher cause than themselves (\\"purpose\\").  In other words, we ought to be elevating the status and humanity of individuals instead of reducing them into statistics and machines to be manipulated with performance bonuses.    In fact, Mr. Pink offers harsh admonitions for rewarding employees for performance.  This approach adds stress of the employee's life, blinds them into short-term narrow goals (thus decreasing their creativity), encourages them to cheat and conduct unethical behavior, and ultimately lowers their morale as well as commitment to their job.  Indeed, Mr. Pink compares this reward mechanism as a drug that will jolt workers into performing fast before ultimately depressing them and lowering their self-esteem.  Educators also know that they shouldn't reward a student for his performance, but rather should offer positive specific feedback for effort and attitude.      This is a point that can be observed to be true throughout society.  Consider Wall Street, which even though Mr. Pink does not mention, is really the epitome of the short-term \\"do or die\\" culture that Mr. Pink so detests.  Then there's the Amazon reviewer rankings, where individuals are so determined to climb in the rankings that they will adopt strategies that increases their rank (such as only writing positive reviews for the most trendy books) but decreases their enjoyment of reading the book.  In our society's pursuit of numbers and statisics and rankings, we forget too easily that the objective is to take pleasure from one's work, and for that to happen the worker must be constantly challenged by it, grow from it, and ultimately believe his work is contributing to the betterment of humanity.      Mr. Pink does not say anything new here, but he systemizes with Malcolm Gladwell style and logic something that progressive educators and cutting edge entrepreneurs have been saying for decades.  Unfortunately, even though his ideas are right, they're also impossible to manage because of the inherent contradiction between mass society and the individual.  The individual yearns to be free, independent, and in love with life, whereas mass society must control, regiment, and shackle that individual.      This is a pivotal point that Mr. Pink ignores, and that's why his last section -- on how to implement his ideas -- comes across as lame and glib.  Consider Google and its use of 20 percent free time to develop independent projects.  That may have been effective in the beginning, but as Google grew the vast bureaucracy meant that there was no longer an immediate feedback loop between the engineer's ideas and desires and the manager's needs and expectations;  today, once considered the best place to work, Google is bleeding talent.      There's also the persistent question of cheaters and free-loaders.  When the company is small, peer pressure and competition can motivate employees into using their 20 percent free time effectivley, but in a large vast bureaucracy where there is little oversight and supervision cheaters and free-loaders become the norm.      Mr. Pink's insights can only be applied if we cease being a mass society with stifling bureaucracies, and divide into manageable knowable communities with small enterprises (no more than 200 individuals).  That won't happen, and so Mr. Pink's ideas -- like Mr. Gladwell's ideas -- will instead just become official chatter at corporate cocktail parties, and that as both Mr. Pink and Mr. Gladwell know is a pretty good motivator to continue to write.

0385493622|5.0|YET ANOTHER SINGH MASTERFUL HISTORY. I have enjoyed a number of Singh's books on the history of science, so when I saw this I bought it immediately. I was not disappointed.    I don't really understand his details about elliptic equations, modular forms, etc., nor do I have any particular interest either in understanding such materials or advanced math.  But as a historical treatment the book is much more about people than maths. Like Singh's books about the history of science, this details the trials and tribulations and real-world problems of people involved in the quest, such as historical prejudice against females in academia, funding problems, and even religious and political persecution resulting from *math* opinions! It also provides an interesting \\"behind-the-scenes\\" view of academia.

But job well done bringing this movie back to life. Keanu Reeves, Patrick Swayze, and Gary Busey. Bringing together surfing, bank robbing, dry humor, and patriotism ( X Presidents. Watch it, you'll like.
0375804153|5.0|MY grown children loved this book when they were little. I bought it for my grandaughter and we shared lots of laughs when I read it to her.  It is a very charming story.
B000P0J024|5.0|Great artists that produced excellent product.  Beyond the hits that were heard on the radio, buy this collection to listen to ALL of these good tracks.
B0018CWEYY|5.0|I bought this for my son's birthday. No complaints from him, and he and his fiancee are major Lost fans. It arrived on time; no problems. I guess all is well!
0783225725|5.0|In Clint Eastwood's second directorial effort he takes his cues from his mentor, Sergio Leone, but adds enough unique touches that distinguish him as a singular voice.  His Stranger is no \\"Man With No Name\\" from the Leone films.  That character was somewhat anti-heroic but still retained a moral code.  At first glance his character appears to be an amoral cold-blooded killer who would seem to be more akin to harm the \\"good folk\\" of Lago than protect them.  It's only as the story unfolds that you realize the townsfolk aren't the innocents of \\"The Seven Samurai\\" but there's a dark heart lying within them.  The only redeemable resident is the dwarf, Mordecai(Billy Curtis).  What Eastwood leaves you with is alot of moral ambiguity about whom to root for in this intriguing film.  It's a daring and ambitious turn that requires the audience to evaluate their concept of good and evil.
B002UZXJA6|5.0|I have been hooked on these ladies since I first saw them on PBS, and even though some of the ladies have changed, the quality of music has not changed one bit.  I have all of their CD's, and I did not think they would top A New Journey until I heard Songs from the Heart.  This CD is the best yet.  Níl Sé'n Lá is a lively tune that just jumps out at you.  Lisa Kelly is as wonderful as ever with Fields of Gold and The Moon's A Harsh Mistress as is Mairead with her fiddle.  Then there is O, America!  I saw them do this in concert last year and was glad to get it on a CD.  If you like Celtic Woman, you will love this new CD.
B002BSHWUU|4.0|came as advertized (opened but unplayed). good price $150. paid less for shipping than it cost the seller to send.  cannot play cds on computers because of video at end of each one.
0385504225|2.0|I just received my MFA in Writing and Literature, which some would say makes me a snob.  OK, I'll take it.  But in my own defense, I actually liked The DaVinci Code a little.  It was worth at least 3, maybe 3.5 stars.  But the writing in this book is ridiculously lazy.  There's nothing that captured me about it.  I'm only giving it two stars for the ideas that drive the book.  There, I think Dan Brown is awesome.  Writing-wise, come on.  Why are these the books that make bestsellers?
0618918248|5.0|Now I understand why so many books have been written in response to \\"The GOD Delusion.\\"  Dawkins' work is a masterpiece!  WARNING: If you're currently a religious person, and you're still able to think for yourself and make rational judgments, prepare to be entertained!
B001F12J48|3.0|Since we really enjoy watching this movie, thought it would be fun to watch in 3D.  Not worth buying this in 3D because the quality was terrible!  Blurry and not at all enjoyable.  Until they use better technology, watching in regular format is better.
B00275EGX8|3.0|To many clich&eacute;s (felt like I was watching Lethal Weapon 1&2 redone!), a main character that was too difficult to understand and very unrealistic, NO ONE that I ever served with would have served with him! The producers should have made up for the poor character arc and weak story with some tradecraft (think technical additions found in \\"Blown Away\\"). It did get a star purely for the good looking end result of the movie (but that is easy for Hollywood these days). Overall, at 2 hours run time this was just barely entertaining and will not be watched again. But I only recommend it because everyone loves movies where things blow-up! Also, because of gore and language I would say it is not for the kiddies, unless you're a very liberal thinking parent (I am but \\"body bomb\\" scene got censored at my house).
0764207407|4.0|I was thrilled to have the opportunity to re-read this book. I have read many of Austen's stories and have seen the characters portrayed in movies as well.Plus I enjoy reading books set during this time period.<br />  I enjoyed the many variations of notes not typically in study / Amplified editions. I was pleased at the easy to read format they used to include the notes as well.(that the comments were labelled with symbols and in the margins near the text being commented on. The information did change how I viewed some of the scenes that I had previously read or seen which was surprising to me.<br />  I didnt enjoy the comments that were listed of a personal nature or that were there to be funny! Ranking of the novels characters which was marked by a frowny face or the smiley faced comments were highly distracting to me. But I know that is a personal preference so I didnt take it too highly into account when giving it a rating. (they are two out of seven of the notes listed!) Many readers may enjoy these comments and would in fact find them entertaining and engaging. I could easily see this text being used in a classroom situation with young readers as well as being read by reading groups / Book clubs. The Group discussion questions were what I thought to be well written and thought provoking.<br />  So, if you have met the characters of Pride and Predjudice before or are reading this story for the first time this addition would be one I would reccomend.<br /><br />Note: A copy of this book was provided by the publisher for review purposes. I received no other compensation for this review and this does not influence my opinion of this book.
B002ZIAC26|4.0|Has it really been already 2 years since I was discovering Beach House's second album, the wonderful \\"Devotion\\"? Since then, the buzz about the Baltimore due has continued to build, even though they haven't been touring all that much. Now comes the band's highly anticipated third album.<br /><br />\\"Teen Dream\\" (10 tracks; 49 min.) continues to build on the soundscapes established in the band's first two album, although this time you can see the sound evolve into more of a fullness than was the case before. The album kicks off with \\"Zebra\\", an example of how the band sounds more lush than on its previous output. \\"Silver Soul\\" continues that theme. \\"Norway\\" is as melodic a track as anything the band has ever done before. \\"Walk In the Park\\" and \\"Used To Be\\" round out the first half of the album, which is simply flawless and I rate it 5 stars. \\"Lover of Mine\\" is a very strong way to start of the second half. \\"Better Times\\" is perhaps the most intimate song on here. \\"10 Mile Stereo\\" soars 10 miles high. \\"Real Love\\" is a piano-based pensive track. Closer \\"Take Care\\" is for me the weakest song on here. I rate the second half 4 stars. In all, this is quite the album, and Beach House is sure to become bigger and bigger.<br /><br />I still haven't had an opportunity to see beach House in concert, but that will thankfully change soon as they are scheduled to appear at Coachella this coming April. Can't wait for that as I am highly anticipating how the songs from this album and from \\"Devotion\\" will sound in a live setting. Finally, if you wonder where you can hear Beach House, check out WOXY (BAM! The Future of Rock and Roll), the internet-only station that brings the best indie-music in the country. Meanwhile \\"Teen Dream\\" is highly recommended!
B000AMJC2K|5.0|I'm getting older, it's simple as that.  Sometimes I need to have the screen just a bit closer to me.  Laugh if you will but at least I'm not chasing you off my lawn.    I was about to order a budget mount and at the very last second I changed my mind and went for the neoflex, and I'm glad I did. The budget mounts need to be tightened whenever they are moved and at least the ones I saw, did not support rotation.      Pros  - Solid feel  - No sagging (Dell 20\\" 2005fpw)  - Landscape/Portrait rotation  - Push button for height adjustment (no knob/screw to tighten and/or sag)  - Includes clamp and grommet mount option.    Cons  - Included wire guides are terrible, but their mounting holes are perfect for velcro straps  - The joint responsible for aspect rotation was too stiff out of the box, and it does not have any sort of indentations so you can feel 90deg turns, you have to go by eye.     Overall the Neo-Flex is well made, stable and sturdy.  While it's a bit more than the budget mounts, it's still relatively affordable and worth it's price.  I will be ordering another to go with my second monitor.
B000002UB3|5.0|can it get any better?  and LOVE that it's quoted at the end of my new favorite book - it's inspirational but not cheesy - Live Like A Fruit Fly - also on amazon :)
B000ZECQ08|2.0|I know that when you read the book, the movie will fall short and the other HP movies worked pretty well at providing a good story.  However, Half Blood Prince was more about raging hormones than the core message of this story.  I was especially disappointed at the end.  How could intruders enter Hogwarts, kill Dumbledore, destroy the Great Hall and then just leave without detection or response FROM ANYBODY in the castle????  I get the feeling that now that everyone's made their $$$ they really don't care what kind of movie is pumped out. . .
B000P0J0AQ|5.0|I love how this movie reinforces the fact that you're in charge of your own destiny - it's one of the main points of my new favorite book - Live Like A Fruit Fly - (the matrix is quoted in it a few times..along with star wars)
B00006CXSS|5.0|Great package deal. I bought this for my boy friend and enjoyed watching it with him ;0)
B002HWRYJE|5.0|...item i bought on amazon this year - i love this move - saw it 3 times in the theatre - first favorite:  the book Live Like A Fruit Fly - although it quotes star wars throughout the book :)
B001U0HAYS|5.0|Wont bore you by reviewing the movie. Just want to tell everyone I found the transfer to blu-ray to be excellent! Picture is much sharper than DVD and sound is terrific. This is what The Godfather should look like. Price may seem steep for a 35 year old movie, but what's a few bucks for a true classic like this? Treat yourself. You wont regret it.
B002RV01QI|2.0|I love Enya, but this is not one of Enya's better albums.  A bit disappointing.
B000BB1MIC|5.0|The quirky residents of Stars Hollow continues to amuse, from the tough lady Mrs. Kim to the unpredictable but always funny Kirk, to the difficult Taylor, the high-strung Sookie, and of course, Lorelai, her parents, and Rory.  Paris is funnier than ever and extremely well played by Liza Weil.    It's the pressures of Yale and the upper-crusty Huntzbergers that finally cause Rory to veer off-course towards the end of this season. You'll notice that she starts to drink more, for one thing.    Also, Richard and Emily Gilmore prove to be destructive in more ways than one, causing further rifts between themselves and their only daughter.  One keeps wishing that Luke and Lorelai would just move in together and marry already, but then, there are two more seasons to go, and many more stories too.
B001TK80C0|4.0|It's a good follow up on T2 considering it's missing the major actors, Arnold and Linda Hamilton.  They could have had other Terminators other than old video of Arnold animated in fight scenes.  While the special effects aren't impressive to wipe out the story they hold their own.  Some special effects seem very early Transformer like.
B001G0MFOM|5.0|The L-word is a legendary show, to bad it had to end. Although it's not the best season, it's still very nice to watch. The reason I state this, is that I have the feeling the writers didn't know how to end the show so they came up with some strange storylines with no answers.    There won't be another show like this....
B0025KVLTC|4.0|SPOILERS FOLLOW<br /><br />First, the good, and there are a load of good and great songs on this album.  John Lennon's timeless vocal and some intriguing mixtures of instruments make \\"I'm Only Sleeping\\" one of the best songs on this CD, and an arguably underrated Beatles song.  \\"Eleanor Rigby\\" is an appropriately haunting tune eerily involving the bad death and  burial of an old spinster.  I am an unashamed fan of \\"Yellow Submarine.\\"  It is a fun, lyrically fascinating song which also features one of Ringo Starr's most entertaining lead vocals with the band.<br /><br />Heading the list of hugely overrated songs on this album is \\"Taxman,\\" one of George Harrison's first major hits with The Beatles.  It's lyrically repetitious, and though always timely thematically, it still could have been done better.  Perhaps if they had made it bigger instrumentally or used an overall different musical arrangement it would have been crisper.  I was never a big fan of Paul McCartney's \\"Good Day Sunshine\\" either, as I think it's too cloyingly cheerful and fake.  Paul redeems himself mightily with \\"Here, There and Everywhere.\\"  Despite an overly simplistic title, it is a fine examination of the various permutations of romantic love.  John Lennon's \\"Doctor Robert\\" may have been a veiled reference to the hippie drug culture of the '60's, but I believe it's still one of the most durable songs on this CD.  Lastly, \\"And Your Bird Can Sing\\" rounds out what is a mixed bag of huge hits and odd misses on this Fab Four album.  It is musically interesting, and lyrically up to par, but the enthusiasm and wonderful creativity of, say, \\"A Hard Day's Night\\" or \\"Help!\\" (the songs, not the albums), just is not there.<br /><br />Overall, this is a fine Beatles disc whose songs nevertheless fail to completely bowl me over, as a whole.  Maybe this was the album taken most directly from its time(at this point, 1966) and thus struggles, albeit in a small way, to be truly timeless.  At any rate, it is stillworth the time of any music lover to check this CD out, as it is flexible enough to appeal to a wide range of people.
B0026P3G12|5.0|What a lovely CD..Susan Boyle belts them out so easily..This is easy listening and a joy to know her story..
0446560065|5.0|[[ASIN:0446560065 Simon's Cat]]  Very funny.  Low price.  Arrived quickly and just as described.
1416575464|5.0|\\"Domino: The Book of Decorating\\" contains sensible, practical advice on how to create a room that matches *your* style. When it first came out a lot of people reviewed it poorly because it was a \\"rehash\\" of images previously shown in Domino magazine. Now that Domino is dead, I only wish the book had contained even more images so that I'd have them to refer back to.
B0018M6J90|5.0|[[ASIN:B0018M6J90 Miss Pettigrew Lives for a Day (Widescreen & Full Screen Edition)]]  Great gift.  Low price.
B00006CXSS|5.0|I've seen the first few episodes of this fine series so far and find it fantastic--nothing I can add that has not already been said.  Hate the packaging, however--the steel box with the accordion-like disc holder is awkward, cumbersome, overdone, and takes up too much space.  It is gimmicky and adds nothing to the viewing experience...a simple box would have been just fine.
B000002J03|5.0|I purchased this CD as a replacement for the one that was lost in the old CD player that was not working to release my CDs.  I have always liked this CD/album (as I had the vinyl version back in the early 70's.  I still listen to it, I still like all the songs.
1584282584|5.0|Neil van Niekerk's book is a wonderful enabler.   He explains on camera flash in such a way that it boosts confidence and encourages practising his techniques.   I am losing my \\"i don't know what to do with flash\\" mentality and replacing it with, Lets try this, I know i can get it close on the first shot. And then fine tune it on the next shot, instead of being discouraged.  I highly reccommend this book; it is worth every cent.
B000ZELISO|5.0|I am not a fan of Harry Potter or what so ever, but I bought this item for my girlfriend on its release. Amazon service was super excellent. She received the item really on the release day before she buy it from the store. The rating is for the service not the movie.. I personally fell asleep every time Dumbledoor talks to Harry
B000ZMX8CU|5.0|While this little jewel does not sound exactly like my amp, it is close enough to practice with a small child sleeping beside me. It has pretty good sound and a wide range of sounds from clean to very distorted. Easy to use and very convenient. For the price you cant go wrong!
B0015GDVTU|5.0|I am a little biased on this film as my wife introduced it to me and it has kind of been our movie since. She is definitely the pragmatic one and she considers me her happy Irish singing guy, even though I am Scottish. Anyway, the movie is great and has a little something for everyone. It is both funny, charming and touching. I highly recommend it.
1423113497|5.0|This series is great for all ages. Action packed. Filled with gods and monsters. Sure, it can be compared to the potter series but still, it is a fun series. Great to get the hesitant readers, especially boys as the main character is male, interested in reading. That said, girls will love it too.
B001KVZ6G6|5.0|Excellent clarity on Blu-Ray in 1080p.  Also, the kids love this movie.  It's a win all around.
B002YICN74|5.0|I'll keep this real simple.  I've never been or real Jonas Bro fan or even paid attention to the type of music they put out but this Nick Jonas kid has some serious skill for his age.  It amazes me that a kid this young can write, play and sing at this level.  This kid has some serious feeling and soul behind his music!  Great album, the first of many that I'm sure will follow.  He very much reminds me of a young John Mayer and will only get better with age and experience which is scary considering how good he is already!
B0026P3G12|5.0|Beautiful, clear voice and music.   Well worth the price.   Great for gift giving.   Gave three away as Christmas gifts and each person loved it!
B000FZDOBW|5.0|este es un álbum realmente bueno para los amantes del jazz-fusion. Realmente recomendable en especial para aquellos que les guste la versión mas funky de este género.  Imprescindible para todo fan de Deodato.
1591791707|5.0|A leaf falls. An ordinary event, and yet sometimes it appears not only beautiful but also deeply mysterious.     Listening to Marshall Rosenberg's audio book is simmilar. The principles are simple, and yet I can't even fathom all the ways they could be used to improve life.
1584282584|5.0|Let me just cut to this chase - this book by Neil van Niekerk is simply fantastic! This is the book you've been waiting for, and it should be considered an instant classic! Why? Because everyone knows how hard it is to get good results out of their on-camera flash, so we spend hundreds of dollars on light modifiers to try to get Joe McNally caliber results, yet no matter how hard we try our flash shots still end up sucking! Well my friends, the solution to your problems are here and no rocket science degree or expensive gear is required to get top caliber results. Read my full review on [...] to understand why I like this book so much!<br /><br />This is my #1 pick for Photography Book of the Year in 2009 and it earns a spot on my must own photography books in my Which books should I read? article. Thank you Neil van Niekerk for sharing your pearls of wisdom in a way that is easy to understand, without using 47 speedlights or $1000+ in light modifiers! Thank you for not going into geeky theory in an attempt to make yourself look smart. Thank you for showing us the HOW but also providing the WHY for those who need that. I look forward to seeing more books from you in the future.<br /><br />Skill Level: All<br />Value: Priceless (especially for people with expensive flashes they don't know how to operate properly)<br />Recommendation: Buy it, read it, apply it, and then read it again. Fantastic stuff that is sure to help your photography more than a new lens or camera body!<br /><br />Neil ( & Amherst Media), if you are reading this I'd LOVE to see you write books on How to Master the Canon Flash System and How to Master the Nikon Flash System (although McNally already did that). If you do, I'm sure the demand would be huge as I've found no books to date that adequately cover the subject
B000UBMSB8|5.0|This sci fi movie takes place in Los Angeles in 2019. We have flying cars and can still drive on the ground. The earth at this time looks more like a wasteland and not healthy. Even the animals are scarce. Rick Deckard played by Harrison Ford is a retired hunter of robots called a Blade Runner. 4 cyborgs called replicants have escaped from a space colony. They're very dangerous models types, and it's illegal for them to even be on earth. They look human. Deckard is called in to resume his job as a Blade Runner and destroy them.    Deckard sees it as a job he wants to get over with. But something in him changes as he goes after these replicants. The main creator of them named Tyrel of the Tyrel Corporation's motto is, \\"More human than human.\\" These latest escaped models are nexus 6's, they can even be smarter than most humans. The leader of the escaped group is Roy played by Rutger Hauer and the other three are Prise, Zhora, and Leon. They have a purpose as to why they have left for earth. Which is tragic yet shows one of the reasons they can be so hostile and angry.     Deckard does alot of investigation throughout the movie to track the replicants down. There are a few good action scenes, but there are a number of dialogue scenes that carry alot of dramatic themes in them. These dramatic themes are what really made Blade Runner very different from many other sci fi movies.     Rachael played by Sean Young has an influence on Deckard's life, whether she realizes it or not. She is a new model of replicant, who has something the escaped ones do not have. She is allowed to stay on earth through Tyrel's permission. Deckard is a pretty cold guy and straight to business, we see him transform throughout the movie as he meets all these characters.     The scenery is very dark, and it rains alot. Riddley Scott's films are usualy like that. This is the same man who did Alien. It does fit in with the seriousness tone of the movie. Everywhere you see are endless buildings. Thespecial effects still hold up, they had to spend alot of time on models and lighting to do alot of their scenes. This was before CG came in to help with that. This is all in the behind the scenes disc.    There are 4 discs. Disc 1 is the final cut, Disc 2 has the making of Blade Runner, Disc 3 has the theatrical, international, and the director's cut. Disc 4 has all the bonuses with deleted and alternate scenes, image galleries, screen tests, and featurettes. All of these different versions of the movie together and for the price makes it a great buy.  The movie is still poplular today. You won't find many sci fi movies like this one.
B002OOG6RQ|4.0|Having to wait 2 years for a new album can lead to high expectations and the danger of the product not delivering...luckily for the astute Rammstein fans, the waiting did pay off. The German Lords of Industrial Rock have delivered, on every level. The music has matured, the lyrics are bold and although they could be perceived as slightly offensive to some,I guess in an era where it is not considered obscene anymore to watch a live war on the tube, we should not be squirmish about Rammstein telling as it is. After all, that's why we fell in love with them to begin with, right? If I would to consider an analogy, this album would be the grown up big brother of \\"Mutter\\". A well constructed, powerful album that should not be missing from any rock library worth its name.
B000VWE5OY|5.0|Once again, BBC has put American Television Production to shame.  The show is amazing and it is almost impossible to get up and get a sandwich during, even though I have it on DVD and can pause the show.  If you like sophisticated well written well acted dark engaging stories, let yourself disappear for an hour of uninterrupted intense story telling. This is not intended for children and may even be too much for the PG-13 crowd; it is great story telling for adults and does not dumb down the show for its audiences - something that many Americans will find uncomfortable at first, but then will be highly disappointed by the production and story telling of American broadcasting and cable fair.     Sadly instead of bringing us the show as it was intended, FOX plans to create an Americanized knock off which will once again, as with \\"the office\\" be good but still not be likely to match the quality and story telling of the original series:  it is truly a shame that broadcasters in the US do not respect their audiences enough to air overseas hit shows as they are and not \\"fix them\\" for us.  In other words, I recommend that you watch the BBC version of this show either online or by purchasing the DVDs.

1400063515|5.0|Before the banking crisis and stock market meltdown, the author came close to supporting the extreme view of quality guru Dr. Deming, that the most important things are \\"unknown and unknowable\\".  Instead, he says that we average humans, the learned class and even the PhD quants on Wall Street, really have no good way of estimating, describing or evaluating extreme events that do not fit within the 95% limit of the typical bell curve.  The biggest impact comes through breakthroughs, catastrophes or non sequitors.  Paradigm shifts, quantum leaps, disasters, perfect storms, revolutions and crowd behavior can be studied, described and analyzed, but they cannot be predicted quantitatively or qualitatively.  Their impact is even more difficult to predict, especially in the short-run.  Hence, we should not be fooled into thinking that portfolio theory and hedges can eliminate most risk.  It remains intrinsic.  The author advises that individuals and investors should look for the unusual or outlier risks which can be identified and hedge against them as possible and preserve resources to invest in opportunities when game changing events do occur.  This is an eye-opening book, which every investor, inventor, politician and entrepreneur should read.
B002UD56I6|5.0|We already know Michael is a genius. Through this film I get to discover the true Michael (in a very mixed emotion)...  Ortega did an A+++ job in pulling in such a great production and the blu-ray won't disappoint. This is an excellent concert you do not want to miss.
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|It's clear why this is a great movie and why it won lots of awards.  It's a must have for any movie collection.
B001H122N4|5.0|I've been a Floyd fan for years and I have all records and most videos and books. What I felt wonderful about the Floyd when I was 12, was the expression of Gilmour's guitars. Later, I digested the lyrics and the concept of each record as a whole. David Gilmour's music is today as mature as a good wine stored in a cellar and you decide to open it. It's big, round, silky, full and lasting. DVD's are just great and the CD's collect excellent versions of the tour highlights. It's incredible that almost the same material is present in the David Gilmour Live at the Royal Albert Hall, and they sound and look different. It's good to have them both.
B002C1BHJ8|5.0|I'm not much for technology stuff, but when we bought a new HDTV and had the cable company come out and hook everything up, the amount of cables and cords from the cable box to the HDTV was ridiculous. I went online and did a little research and learned about the new HDMI cables. One cable does it all.    I really appreciated that this cable was reasonably priced and was available in the environmentally conscious packaging. Thanks Amazon for offering that option!
B001EN71DG|5.0|This DvD set is perfect for Star Wars fans. Its cheap and you get a lot for your money. The set comes with six DvDs in three slim  cases. You get the remastered special edition DvDs and also the original un-touched Movies.
B002Q4TKAY|5.0|I've always liked the Killers songs that received airplay, but never was an actual fan. After watching some live performances from this DVD though, had to see the whole thing. It didn't dissappoint.    This is truly a top-notch production. The venue is beautiful, theatrics entertaining, and songs moving. Everything about the DVD package exudes quality: from packaging, to the long setlist (22 songs), the included live album CD, and the price. Whether or not you like the music is a matter of taste. But if you do like Killers songs in the least, then this is a must-see. Much of their music seems even better live. (sam's town; dustland farirytale; all these things that i've done) Only wish all artists would put this much care and love into their DVDs :)
B000P0J0A6|5.0|I bought this movie because I loved it when it first came out although I enjoyed watching it again, it was different than I remember!
0451228731|4.0|If you read this, you will buy the next one tosee how it all turns out. That's a good thing. The author gets you hooked and keeps reeling you in. All premised on some inept (corrupt?) government investigators and crooked corporations gumming up the hunt. Great action sequences made for the summer movie crowd carry this along.
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|I bought this a few days before Christmas Eve, and I received it within 3 days, on December 23rd.  Amazon really came through for this one.
0307266303|5.0|About a third of the way through the book I stopped and ordered one fedexed to my favorite client.    When he was a third of the way through he called me and asked if it was fiction or non-fiction.    In a meeting last week he mentioned the book to his staff in glowing terms.    The concepts in the book have come up in conversations on airplanes, at neighbor's houses and with family.    And we're not even runners.    Buy this book and read it.
B001R4KQDE|5.0|The original theatrical version and unrated director's cut are presented here over two blu ray discs that are simply stunning to look at.  The sound is sensational, the picture is reference quality.  Highly recommended if your a fan of Sin City.

B0000931LJ|5.0|Both this and Bowie´s \\"Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars\\" are considered the most relevant glam releases. But this one came one year early, so one can argue it is more important, despite the fact that Bowie´s glam records are fantastic too.  The remastered 180g vinyl sounds really good. The cover opens and you can see a big and beautiful picture of Bolan. The record comes inside of an anti-static plastic-and-paper envelope. The disc have only the 11 original tracks, no bonus. Great reissue of a classic. Highly recomended.
B001E5CH0G|5.0|This is one of the better holiday movies put together.  Up there with a Christmas story.  Something that needs to be watched every year.  I know him! I know him!
0143038419|5.0|I'm perplexed by all the negative reviews about the author being self-centered.  This is a book about her so of course it's going to be \\"about her\\".  The author is genuine and honest.  I relate to what she went through in her first marriage and I completely understand the need for her to find herself.  If all of us could just get up and go to 3 countries in a year...  I found the second part of the book to be a bit tough to get through in the beginning but as she started to \\"get\\" the meditation for what it is supposed to be, it got a little easier to read.  I think any woman who has gone through a not-so-great marriage and then decides to divorce will relate to this book and the author's feelings.    I can't wait to read her new book, Committed.
B000FBJG04|5.0|I finally got around to reading this book and am I sorry I waited so long. This is an excellent history that gives a very accurate picture to what World War II was like for those who fought it, especially the airborne. The writing is in an engaging and entertaining style. The story is told chronologically and from multiple points of view, obviously, since it's the story of all the men involved, not just a few. This book really puts a very human face on the heroes that won the war.
B001C46P2K|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this film ~ so much so that I purchased and am currently reading \\"We Two\\", the biography of Victoria & Albert. The film is a wonderful cinematic pleasure to view. The actors portrayed the historical figures w/such authority. And the costumes ~ beautifully done. I plan on seeing this film in the theater again this week. Sadly, no US date has been announced for the DVD release; but I for one will be waiting so that I can watch this terrific film again and again! Bravo!
B000N6U0DS|5.0|First, let me just quickly say that the acting, plot construction, scenery, and other standard elements are very good in this movie.  There are no significant flaws which threaten to ruin the movie.<br /><br />Turning to the story itself, as most people know, this movie is \\"inspired by a true story\\" involving a man who faces enormous financial hardships, to the point where he and his son wind up homeless.  The problems he encounters are so relentless that it becomes almost too painful to watch.  But he's gifted at math, has good interpersonal skills, and works incredibly hard, so he eventually winds up with a nice job in a San Francisco financial firm, and later goes on to start his own firm and become a multi-millionaire.<br /><br />A story like this will naturally appeal to an American audience because it taps in to the meritocratic notion that the American dream is accessible to most of us if we're willing to work hard and make sacrifices.  But we can question how much this moving and inspiring story can really serve as a model for the masses.  I would say not much.  In a country of 300 million people, you'll always be able to find stories like this, but they're the exception, not the norm, and of course that's what makes this story worthy of a movie.  Moreover, the main character clearly had abilities and a work ethic far beyond the norm, so it took very special strengths to prevail over such especially bad luck.  But I do think this story illustrates the upper limits of what's possible, and most people can draw the lesson that working hard will still provide at least some benefit, even if the benefit falls short of one's ultimate dreams.<br /><br />Another lesson which is perhaps equally important is that children may value and need our love and attention more than the material resources we can provide.  That's certainly the case in this story, and I suspect that this can be generalized to most children.  Something to consider for dads (and moms) who are preoccupied with putting in long hours away from home in order to make a lot of money ...<br /><br />Highly recommended to anyone looking for an uplifting story, even if few people can replicate an ending as happy as this one.ng hours away from home in order to make a lot of money ...

B002T9H2L0|5.0|Tarantino outdoes himself in this flick. It is hilarious at times and disturbing at others. The writing is superb. The characters are richly developed and the acting performances are fantastic. Waltz definitely deserves an Oscar to go with his Golden Globe.
B000ZOXDFA|1.0|This dreadful movie takes extraordinary artistic license with the facts of history to be polite.  The Spanish Ambassador looked more like an Arab than a real Spaniard and the portrayal of King Philip was akin to an evil and ugly scheming Klingon captain of Star Trek fame. In actuality, Elizabeth I was not all she was cracked up to by the propagandistic British historical establishment. That mad woman embroiled England in a war(1585-1604) against Spain that actually bankrupted it and forced her successor, King James I, to sue for peace with Spain and sign a peace treaty that was largely on Spanish terms.
B00337KM2S|4.0|A movie for the current times, Jason Reitman's latest work is touching and melancholy and doesn't provide any substantial resolve. The movie also asks a very interesting question about technology and to what extend can technology be used to replace people in the workplace. How much can really be outsourced these days?
B002RSDW80|5.0|great film -- really a woman's perspective...all about the relationships. Meryl was wonderful as usual. highly recommend.
B0029LHW68|1.0|\\"This Is War produced by Flood (U2, Depeche Mode, Nine Inch Nails and Smashing Pumpkins\\"...funny because this is exactly what this album sounds like.  But this album has a Sting feel to it as well.  Really it has an 80's style stench of pop music all over it.  We have heard this stuff a million times over. What is this band thinking to keep giving the middle finger to its fan base every album?  They won't survive like this.  First album was new and fresh with tunes you can rock out to.  Second album was toned down from creativity but still enjoyable with some killer tunes.  This one?????....I don't know what to say. Just not their best.  Maybe Jared is sticking it to the label for the law suit.  Lets hope so.  This album has all the symptoms of rushed uninspired material.  I read that this is what they were going for.  I hope not or I won't be listening anymore.  If you like the first album a lot stay clear away from this album.  It's like it's not even the same band.  Other reviews were right.  Where are the guitars??????  This band lost my blind faith of just picking up the album in the stores when I see it without hearing what it sounds like.  You made a fool of me this time.  It won't happen again.  So what is this album?  Rehashed 80's style pop with fluff chants and dramatic pauses.  Oh and there are really only about 9 songs on this album.  Don't be fooled.  I want a \\"Capricorn (A Brand New Name)\\" again.  I'm a metal head and even I took notice of this song back then.
B002X063OC|5.0|If I didn't believe the passion in Lady Gaga I'd think someone planned her career for her.  This album is great. I prefer it 2x to her first album mostly because I feel like she's loosened up/amped it up and really \\"is\\" herself.<br /><br />Highly recommended for anyone who likes the variety of nostalgic sounds provided in a fresh & addictive way. Great CD.
B001SGEUNI|4.0|Popish female led melodic metal.  That is how to describe Halestorm.  Lucky for me I like that.  Yes, it may sound like it is pushed to be more mainstream than other bands but how can you fault them.  A band with no sales is not going to be a band for that long.  \\"I Get Off\\" is my favorite track.  Makes me want to run around my house in the buff and open the blinds while my dog tries to contain his laughter.  \\"Bet U Wish U Had Me Back\\" is my second favorite but, what is this a text message?  Song title with U instead of \\"You\\" got old when Prince did it in the 80's.  The song sounds like a hard rock country song.  I expect to hear Taylor Swift singing it on her next album.  Personally, I like songs that can be reworked and done in different genres.  I think it says a lot about the song and the writing.<br /><br />If you like stuff like Nightwish, Within Temptation, After Forever you will probably like this.  It is like those bands but not as serious.
B002VKE1K2|5.0|I bought the dvd before I saw the movie.  I didn't really know what to expect.  A couple of people I know told me that it was \\"really scary\\".  I love horror movies, so i've seen quite a few. I also know that what is \\"scary\\" to one person may bore another to tears.  This movie starts off really slow, the characters started to really annoy me in the middle, but in the end...it got me.  Paranormal Activity made me think:. How well do you really know your partner?. Do they have something inside them that could destroy you?. Sometimes you don't even see it coming.  Sometimes you don't want to see...like you're asleep.  Watch this movie with an open mind.  It just might surprise you.
B0018CMJSU|5.0|This movie saga is one of the best of all time. The story line, the performances, the direction, everything is great.
B000065V42|5.0|I saw this when it first came into theatres back in the summer of '89 (OMG, has it already been 20 yrs. since it came out??). During a summer of blockbusters (\\"Batman\\", \\"Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade\\", \\"Ghostbusters 2\\"), I was impressed with the scope & creativity of this seemingly small film (no pun intended) which held its own admirably against the other box office juggernauts. Seeing it now, the special effects seem pretty artificial in comparison to the miracle-working CGI stuff today. No matter; it's the imaginative script & acting talent onscreen that's the real deal. Rick Moranis brings his own goofy comedic charm to the role of inventor Wayne Szalinski, who's created a shrink ray machine; trouble is, he can't quite figure out how to perfect it. That is, until a baseball whacked through the upstairs cellar window somehow solves the laser's problems & activates the machine as it randomly shrinks objects such as the furniture. The focus shifts back & forth between the Szalinski family & their neighbors, the Thompsons, headed by thick-headed matriarch Matt Frewer (yep, Max Headroom himself). The \\"baseball\\" altercation brings the Szalinski & Thompson kids together in the cellar...conveniently in range for the machine to shrink them. Being the preoccupied inventor that he is, Wayne tidily sweeps the kids up, bags them, and drops them off just outside the back yard. Thus, the film presents its main conflict: the kids need to get back to the house; except now, they face the insurmountable task of crossing the yard which has now become a miles-long jungle of giant blades of grass & giant flowers. It's here where the film really excels on imagination as the kids encounter bees, giant cookies, lawn mowers, toys & even make a lone ant a \\"pet\\". Finally, Wayne realizes what happened to the kids (and what he's done) & has to break the news to his wife (Marcia Strassman, resurfacing after TV's \\"Welcome Back, Kotter\\"). And so, the Thompson parents watch in dumbfounded awe & comment on \\"how weird the Szalinski's are\\" as Wayne & wife use bizarre contraptions to search for the kids without treading on the lawn. Eventually, through all kinds of unusual obstacles, the kids do make it back into the house, Wayne restores them back to normal size, and the neighbors, through this strange ordeal, actually become \\"good\\" neighbors.   I was rather disappointed that Disney didn't bother to create some DVD extras--at least a \\"making of\\" featurette--considering this was one of its biggest live-action hits. Guess I'll settle on the happiness of actually owning this little gem of a special effects comedy.
B00005JOHC|5.0|It's fun to watch these and watch little Jake grow up. Some of his lines are getting funnier now that he is grown up. Fun to see how the series first started. Puts some of the puzzle pieces together if you missed some episodes.
068981528X|5.0|I loved the story. I loved the artwork. I loved the expressions on the determined pig's face. I loved the creativity of the whole concept.   Why not enjoy a book that you may read over and over to your children?
B002M2T1UO|1.0|I purchased this because I am a big fan of Michael Chiklis and the series. I was very disappointed after opening and taking out the 1st disc, it was scratched and had very small, hard particals stuck to the video side. I checked the rest of the disc's and about two thirds of the disc's were in the same shape. A few of them had very deep gouges. Again, I can't tell you how disappointed I was. I returned the set for a refund but I will not buy another set like this. Maybe if Sony changes the packaging I will consider repurchasing it again.  I am pretty sure that the way this is packaged and presented is why the disc's were damaged.
B00005AWMF|5.0|I don't have any words to review this CD because her music speaks for itself. Sade is one of the few talented geniuses in the industry. I would recommend this for anyone who has a great appreciation not only for music, but for lyrics as well.   Every Sade fan out there MUST own this! And for those who don't know Sade or are just beginning to explore her music, you MUST own this.     I simply cannot imagine music without Sade. :-)

0061120073|5.0|I thought the book took a little time to get going, but was certainly worth plugging along through the first 50 to 100 pages.  I don't want to spoil the book for anyone who hasn't read it, but there was one piece of the book (at the very end) that I thought was a bit contrived and not developed as well as the rest of the book. It almost seemed like the author had gotten tired of writing and was just trying to finish.  It was a minor part of the end of the book and certainly didn't impact my overall impression.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|This book is really about the art of being successful in a very difficult situation and who better to interpret the nuances, restraint and subtlety required than man's best friend to whom the subtlest move or expression speaks volumes. I resisted this book--as in why would I want to read a book about car racing told by a dog--but then I understood why both the setting and the narrator mattered.  I loved it and recommend it often. Although the main character pursues Formula One racing, it's what else he does and how he does it that matters.  His ability in that field translates beautifully into the rest of his life as he handles a horrible situation with incredible grace. This is a story about humility and determination and love told in an unexpected way and it's well worth the read.  Highly recommended.

1401323820|3.0|Ah, the television world! HEAT WAVE is a play within a play within a play on words and you know what? It works. Pseudo author Richard Castle is based on the ABC show's lead character, Castle. The television series is the tale of the smart alecky mystery novelist who, thanks to his writing fame and connections, gets to tag around with NYPD Detective Kate Beckett solving murders every Monday evening.<br />  The book HEAT WAVE is the fictional one he wrote doing so. It features the fictional Kate Beckett's fictional recreation, Nikki Heat. It's also the real life book on your bookstore's bookshelf and Amazon's digital shelf. It's art imitating life imitating art and lite lit.<br />  Confusing? At times, but all in all, it is a clever marketing ploy for a clever television program that works thanks in large part to Canadian born actor Nathan Fillion (FIREFLY series) and the series cast that bring Castle to rollicking life.<br />  Surprisingly, the book holds its own against many of the mysteries on the market. Some question whether it could hold its own without the TV series but that's a moot point because the Richard Castle character now has a few lives of his own- on the small screen and in print and you know what, we seem to be buying both.<br />  It's light reading but measured against much of what else is out there you'll at least chuckle and grin a few times and maybe that's not a bad deal for the times or the cover price.<br />  Enjoy!

0895260131|1.0|This book proves that anyone can write a book and get it published.  I bought this book for a book group that discusses timely topics with an emphasis on Jewish or related matters.  Some of what the author relates is true but his writing style is so slanted and sarcastic that every person in the group disliked it.  The editing of the book was also poor.  There are errors throughout.  One example that could easily have been checked is the Temple Mount not Mound as was stated a few times in the book.  This was a waste of time to read and discuss.  We could have read other books (and will) that would have given us the information in a better and more concise manner without the radical right rhetoric.

B0000DKMK0|5.0|This edition of the movie is as close to the original vision that Quentin Tarantino had for the movie as you will get (of course, discounting any future release where the two parts are reformed and re-released as a single movie).    I'm not going to write a review on the movie as it has been done by many other people - this review is on this edition of the DVD.    Simply put - there are no black & white bits where QT had to scale the movie back in order to obtain an R-rating (instead of NC-17) and it is definitely worth purchasing this edition over the R-rated versions. I would say to the true fan to have a copy of each but I prefer this edition over all others.    There are no extra scenes and the menus are all in Japanese but that is easy enough to work around.  Other editions of the movie that I have also don't have the subtitles for the scenes where Japanese is spoken - but this one does.    English soundtrack is 5.1 (default) and DTS.  English subtitles are easy to locate as well.    You will need a machine that will play multiple regions in order to view (or be able to set to region 2).
B002SAUCBC|1.0|I usually love Mr. King's stories, but this one bored me to tears.  I am always one who finishes a book no matter how good or bad it is, but I deleted this one from my Kindle when I was half way through just so I didn't have to torture myself.
B002ONC9NC|4.0|Jenny (Carey Mulligan) is a 16-year-old promising schoolgirl in London in 1961.  She plays the cello and joins all the right activities, and her pushy parents want her to attend Oxford.  She works hard and knows that going to university will likely lead to a teaching career; her life will be much like the one lead by her supportive but bland teacher, Miss Stubbs (Olivia Williams).  However, one rainy day at a bus stop, she meets the dynamic, charming 30-something David (Peter Sarsgaard).  Normally, a girl of her type would shy away from a forward older man, but for some reason, Jenny doesn't.  She ends up dating David and being sucked into his world, which involves exciting trips to Paris, suppers at chic jazz clubs, and parties with David's rich friends.  Is Peter \\"educating\\" Jenny about how exciting life can be, or will Jenny's education involve something else, perhaps something less pleasant?<br /><br />\\"An Education\\" is a well-acted period piece.  Carey Mulligan has received numerous nominations (including for an Academy Award) for her turn as Jenny.  The 24-year-old actress does a beautiful job with her difficult role, which begins as a wide-eyed 16-year-old and ends somewhere else entirely.  Peter Sarsgaard is also quite good; he keeps his character's intentions murky enough so that we never know whether to trust him.  The look of the film is quite nice, and I particularly enjoyed how it captured the early 1960s jazz scene.  I'm sure that many viewers will wish that they could be in Jenny's place.  Surprisingly, the Danish director (Lone Scherfig) is an adherent to Dogme95, although I don't see any trace of that aesthetic in this film, her first in English.  The script, by write Nick Hornby is based on an autobiographical article by journalist Lynn Barber; I generally like Hornby's work, and at times \\"An Education\\" is quite funny.  Hornsby received his first Oscar nomination for the script (the film based on his novel \\"About a Boy\\" was also nominated for Best Adapted Screenplay, but Hornby did not write that script).<br /><br />Despite the film's strengths, it ended up falling a bit flat for me.  First, I never bought into the reaction of her Jenny's parents to David - they're more easily seduced than is Jenny!  Second, it was difficult to understand how Jenny herself could so quickly turn against the academics that were previously the center of her world.  The transformation from dreamy schoolgirl to partying clubgoer was a bit too abrupt and the audience could have benefitted from hearing Jenny's thoughts on the matter.  Finally, the main story (young woman used by an older man) is a familiar one, and I don't think \\"An Education\\" added much new to the genre.  \\"An Education\\" is a nice looking and well-acted movie that kept me entertained, but it doesn't soar like it could have.  The film has received three Oscar nominations, including Best Picture.Screenplay, but Hornby did not write that script).    Despite the film's strengths, it ended up falling a bit flat for me.

B0013FXWU6|5.0|This movie is one of the most enjoyable films I have ever seen. Why? Stellar acting, great pace and intriguing plot. It also boasts amazing cinematography that really adds to the storyline, feel and suspense in the film. The last scene is one of the best I have ever seen. I was shokced, and then I laughed my arse off. It was fresh, interesting and enjoyable.
B00062IDCO|5.0|What can I say? If you love Star Trek Voyager, you'd be hard-pressed to find a better deal than on Amazon! Not to mention the free shipping, which is ALWAYS a plus! The only problem whatsoever was the case was cracked at the top when I got it, and pieces fell out when I opened it up. I have to admit that this has been the case for every Star Trek Voyager season I got from Amazon, but the discs were just fine and absolutely no problems with them. More careful packaging would make a world of difference but for me it was really not that big a deal. I am very happy with this deal and would do it again!
B0011UF79C|5.0|I got this DVD recently since it was on a list of recommended science fiction DVDs. which I found out you can get new for less than $[...], plus shipping.<br /><br />Its somewhat typical - conventional in that the topic of human genetic engineering is placed in the context of a love story, which ordinarily would not interest me in the least bit.<br /><br />But, it is revelatory in its dealing with the topic of human genetic engineering, done by humans, by parents for the sake of their children's best interests, (they suppose), and how our society might change in that context.<br /><br />Its not a utopia, it's a dystopia, with ramifications well worth thinking over.<br /><br />Once unleashed, and we are on the precipice of that, can the genie of genetic engineering be put back in the bottle?<br /><br />And if human parents are prohibited from it, will anything stop our despotic covert governments from genetic engineering, if more power for them, better human weapons, can be made and controlled, I do not think so.<br /><br />This is a vast topic, the movie series, Aliens, the whistle-blower Dan Burisch who says some reported alien UFO's such as Roswell, Greys/abductions were actually future versions of mankind coming back to gather genetic material to correct their own broken evolutionary path, Sitchin re: extraterrestrial intervention in mankind's past, the NAZI's - Rockefeller in the US and \\"eugenics\\", Dr Mary's Monkey (engineered bio weapons), again, too many instances to cite.<br /><br />Check out the DVD if you are interested, it places in perspective one vital aspect of this very interesting topic.
B0000AK7AB|5.0|If you love movies that portray anthropomorphized animals, or if you are one of those who think that pigs have been unfairly portrayed negatively, this one is for you. The farm animals speak to each other. The cat and dogs realize their value. The duck and pig are concerned that they have no role other than that of being eaten by humans.<br /><br />So the duck and pig each try nontraditional roles: The duck preempts the rooster in waking everybody up, and the pig makes friends with the sheep and makes them obey the pig's requests (not commands). Fearing that the \\"mechanical rooster\\" makes the duck superfluous, and liable to be eaten for a meal, the duck gets the pig to cooperate with him in the removal of the alarm clock from the farmer's house.<br /><br />The farmer gets to appreciate the pig more and more. The pig drives off a wolf attack on the sheep. The farmer decides to enter the pig in a sheep-dog contest, as there is nothing in the rules that explicitly says that the sheep-herding animal must necessarily be a dog. As he and the pig enter the field, the crowd roars in laughter and derision, thinking that he must be stark-raving mad, or some kind of practical joker. The farmer's wife, watching on television, faints from embarrassment. But the heroic pig has other ideas...

B002EWD08Q|4.0|Although Arctic Monkeys are superstars in their native England, here in the states it seems that they'll only be known for \\"I Bet You Look Good on the Dancefloor\\", despite a Saturday Night Live appearance. At any rate, their first two albums are classics in my book, so I had no trouble picking up their latest album, Humbug.<br /><br />Some people might not realize this is an Arctic Monkeys album right away, however. Not that the style sounds any different (a little of a surprise, considering it was mostly produced by Queens of the Stone Age frontman Josh Homme), but Alex's voice has obviously changed between the releases of [[ASIN:B000NQR7NO Favourite Worst Nightmare]] and this album because he's singing in a lower register. But the songs still stand out. I wasn't as excited about \\"Crying Lightning\\" as everyone else simply because I don't think it makes much sense, but there are better songs like \\"Potion Approaching\\", \\"My Propeller\\" and the necessary end-of-album mellow song, \\"The Jeweller's Hands\\". And the spelling-out-the-title vibe of \\"Dangerous Animals\\" actually works quite well.<br /><br />My only other real concern is that \\"now you're hiding in my soup\\" line in \\"Fire and the Thud\\". But that kind of thing is easily ignored. While not a classic album like their first two, Humbug should have you saying everything but.<br /><br />Anthony Rupert

1439157383|3.0|I love me some melodrama, absolutely love it. Especially when the melodrama results in gasps, and anger, and tears. My jury is still out on My Sister's Keeper by Jodi Picoult. The plot had such huge potential. We've got a 13 year old girl, Anna, who is basically born as spare parts for her sister, Kate, who has leukemia. Well, Anna does not enjoy being harvested, so she initiates a lawsuit to be medically emancipated from her parents so she won't be obligated to be spare parts anymore. Oh, and there's a lot of subplots, some which added to the story, some which I questioned the purpose. Anna's lawyer, Campbell has his own subplot where he romances a social worker and has a service dog. While I like dogs, I felt the plot revolving around the dog was a waste of pages, detracting from the main issue. Oh, and for the other subplot, there is Anna's father Brian and her pain in the butt brother, Jesse. Brian fights fires, Jesse starts them. Yes, requisite eye roll goes here. Again, the character of Jesse could have been developed beyond his acting out, but really, his parts had me bored.<br /><br />Anna was the only character I really cared about in this book. Some of her narration had me reduced to a blubbering mess, however, this means nothing as I also tear up over jewelry commercials, hallmark commercials, and many other sentimental things. I think Anna's voice was the most developed, she felt the most real, albeit she felt more adult than the adult characters. Go figure. I felt the other points-of-view included were flat. For example here's Campbell's plot line \\"Hey mister why do you have puppy?\\" \\"It's not a puppy, it's a service dog\\" \\"What's wrong with you?\\" \\"Insert witty one-liner pertaining to a disability here.\\" It was funny the first two times, but after that just became drawn out.<br /><br />Anna's mother was a horrible parent. \\"She's all pity me, pity me I hate my other kids, leukemia kid is the only one who matters.\\" Also, you know how this book centers around Anna's trial? Well, Anna's mother is a former lawyer so she chooses to represent herself. I may not be a lawyer in real life, but I watch Law & Order, I took a Constitutional Law class, and hah, I can't believe how horrible of a lawyer she was. Instead of being relevant while questioning witnesses she launches into these irritating stories about her family. And obviously the other lawyer should have objected on the grounds of relevance, but no we get to her her reminisce with her husband, instead of, yah know, working on the case and using the law/spirit of the law to prove her point.<br /><br />The writing isn't too terrible. I think some of it was complete cliched (Brian/Jesse subplot I am looking at you!). But, I finished the book in two days and did cry a few times while reading it. Granted, I do feel as though my emotions were manipulated. Speaking of manipulation, let me talk about the ending, by dancing around some spoilers. Okay, the end made me want to chuck this book across the room, despite my bawling all the way through it. The book builds up to this one thing, keeps building around Anna's choice. Then, agh, the end what a huge cop out. Seriously without a doubt the worst ending I have ever read. I know many will disagree with me, which is fine, we don't need to love/hate the same books. Honestly, though, I thought the ending was just like on a tv show where all this stuff happens to the main character, and you find out it was just a dream, which to me is taking the easy way out. I promptly had to complain to my boyfriend after word. Yes, yes, it's super mature to complain about a fictional book, but agh, I just invested so much time and emotions into the characters, and for it to end that way was a huge let down.<br /><br />I know so many people love Picoult's books and I can understand.

B002R0F3Q2|5.0|I've always been in love with this woman, Alicia Keys, since the beginning of her career. Not only was I astounded by her physical beauty, but also by her musical gift. Ever since her debut, she has proven herself to be in a class of musical women who don't need to show off their physical attributes in order to maintain album sales. Instead, she maintains her class as a lady and expresses herself through the music, the way it SHOULD be done. With this being said, this album is nothing short of pure musical greatness. Shes never released a lackluster album to date, and this is nothing different. From the beginning to the end, \\"The Element of Freedom\\" is a musical masterpiece that again, like her previous works, showcases the beautiful woman known as Alicia Keys doing what she does best. I recommend this album to EVERYONE!
0765360969|5.0|Mistborn is set in a fictional world where a race of people, the Skaa are enslaved. The whole world is ruled by this dude called 'Lord Ruler.' All snickers aside, the back story of the Lord Ruler is rather interesting. The book doesn't focus on the Lord Ruler though. Rather, the focus is on a Skaa girl named Vin. Basically Vin doesn't trust anyone, because she's had a hard life. She grows dynamically, though. Sharing Vin's spotlight, is another character, Kelsier, who is basically a criminal genius. Oh, and Vin and Kelsier are allomancers, which basically means they metabolize metal and can do all kinds of cool things.<br /><br />I love a nice long adult fantasy book. I do enjoy worldbuilding and becoming immersed in an imaginary place. I love books as long as Mistborn because I feel like the characters are real people afterwards. Also, I loved the scope of Sanderson's imagination. I loved the idea of mistwraiths and of allomancy. I loved the small details he puts in, such as the tenets of religions which were destroyed when the Lord Ruler basically took over. I loved the characterization, and the band of thieves. I liked that for once, a long fantasy book has a female kicking butt and in such a prominent role. And can I fangirl a bit over the secondary characters. I loved Elend, I loved Sazed the terrisman and his stories of the religions.<br /><br />Also, I think the progression towards revolution shown within the book was pretty viable. I read a review of this book where it was stated that Sanderson gets society, as in he understands how and why people do what they do, which reflects in his writing. I have to say, I agree. The events of this book didn't feel contrived to me at all. Every thing didn't work out perfectly, although I have to say, the character of Kelsier was a frakken genius, and ahhh. I want to say more, but since people don't look very kindly on being spoiled, mum's the word!
B002DKGWSE|5.0|While being transported by two detectives in a car, the dangerous criminal Krug is rescued by his brother Francis and his girlfriend Sadie, and they brutally kill the detectives. Meanwhile Emma, her husband Dr. John and their seventeen year-old daughter Mari Collingwood head on vacation to their house nearby the lake. Mari borrows the family car to meet her friend Paige that is working in a store in the town. They befriend the teenager Justin in the store and he offers some marijuana to the pothead Paige in the motel where he is lodged. While they are smoking grass in Justin's room, Krug, who is Justin's father, Francis and Sadie arrive and abduct the girls. Krug drives Mari's car and she provokes a crash on a tree. Krug stabs Paige and rapes Mari; however Mary manages to escape, swimming in the lake, but Krug shots her on the back. They walk through the isolated road in the woods and they reach Collingwood's house telling that they have just had a car accident. Emma and John welcome the strangers until they discover what happened to their beloved daughter. The performances are on and the story is great. I would say this is one of the best remakes in years, this is not for the faint of heart though, but if you're curious about the remake, this was a very respectful movie of the original horror story of murder and revenge.

B000BTJDG2|5.0|The nineteen years old Catholic college girl Emily Rose dies a couple of days after being submitted to an exorcism carried out by her parish priest, Father Moore. Emily believed she was possessed by six demons, and although authorized by Emily and he parents, Father Moore is accused of negligent homicide, since he had suggested Emily to interrupt the use of medications for epilepsy. In order to avoid a scandal, the Archdiocese hires the successful, ambitious and agnostic lawyer Erin Bruner, and the prosecution assigns the religious prosecutor Ethan Thomas. Along the days, there is a battle between science and religion in the court. There are some very interesting scenes in this movie, that find ways to express things in subtle and creative ways without spelling them out. And an incredible performance by Jennifer Carpenter. This is not a full-blooded horror movie, but definitely one of the most unsettling, disturbing and thought-provoking dramas, seeing Emily possessed is terrifying. Highly recommended.

B000002UJQ|5.0|A friend recently commented to me that if Radiohead's [[ASIN:B000002TQV The Bends]] was their [[ASIN:B0025KVLTC Revolver]], then [[ASIN:B000002UJQ OK Computer]] was their [[ASIN:B0025KVLTM Sgt. Pepper's]] moment. I am inclined to agree with his analogy, for as much as I like \\"The Bends,\\" the astounding emotional scope of \\"OK Computer\\" took me completely by surprise when I first heard it in 1997. This was back when I still had a few friends at record companies, and a dear lady at Capitol (hello Leslie M, wherever you are today) sent me a three song sampler of this because she new how much I liked Radiohead.<br /><br />The sampler contained \\"Karma Police,\\" \\"Paranoid Android\\" and \\"No Surprises.\\" Before the CD came out, I was telling friends that this was the most amazing stuff I'd heard all year. By the time the full CD had been in my player for a couple weeks, I was thinking it was the best album of the year. Thom Yorke had taken the themes of modern alienation he so adeptly explored on \\"The Bands\\" and matched them with music that both slowed down and toned down to haunting textures and electronics. Johnny Greenwood's guitars are almost non-existent, relegated to sudden bursts save for \\"Electioneering.\\" More often than not, it is Yorke's voice that is the primary instrument, weaving in and out of the songs in either a whisper (\\"Exit Music For a Film\\") or his rock howl (\\"Lucky\\").<br /><br />More importantly, \\"Ok Computer\\" is an album that (like \\"Sgt Pepper\\") collects songs that pull together thematically. While \\"Karma Police\\" and \\"No Surprises\\" have become something of radio-airplay staples, this is a CD that works as a complete listen. I know there's a general consensus that this is a concept album - listen to how many times plane crashes, car wrecks and machines are mentioned - yet I have always attributed that to Yorke's generally dour lyrical viewpoint. To my ears, the concept was coming up with the post-Pink Floyd equivalent of sonic quilting for the modern age. In \\"OK Computer,\\" Radiohead succeeded more than anyone before or since.\\" Radiohead succeeded more than anyone before or since.
B001KVZ6FW|5.0|From my wife Sarah: Adults - Don't miss this movie. I was completely surprised at how touching and emotional this movie was for me as an adult. I expected the usual level of \\"Disney cute\\" - and I got it to the extreme, but I had no idea how deep this movie would go to pull at my heart strings. I've never cried when watching a cartoon, but I cried several times during this movie.<br /><br />Towards the beginning of the movie, without giving anything away, I'll just say that you watch something deeply beautiful unfold, and then something deeply sad happens. Young children most likely won't even realize what happened, but adults will get it. It was done so well, that it was really touching. By the end of the movie I was crying because I was so touched and uplifted. It was more moving than many adult movies I've seen lately, and so well done. There was ultimately some very positive messages in this movie. I was surprised at how meaningful it was.<br /><br />Then there was the whimsy. What a creative story. It was truly a work of visual art, and a wonderful, well-written and conceived original fantasy. There was so much creative genius - from the house carried away by balloons to the collar on the dogs that could make them talk. There were many surprises that had me laughing gleefully. There was sensational character development. In fact, I found myself really caring about what happened to them. The writers and animators have an uncanny ability to make the characters just so cute! The actors did a fantastic job as well.<br /><br />All I can say is that I loved this movie. It was precious, adorable, beautiful and so worth seeing for adults and children alike. I know I sound like I'm ranting a bit, but I think it's not to be missed. I do wish I had seen it in 3-D in the theater, but it was still wonderful on DVD.

I was blown away by how much insanely useful information just in the first 8 pages. And it doesn't stop there. I read this book in one sitting -- underlining and dog-earring nearly every page.  Gallo has completely simplified for the process of effective speaking and makes it sound like FUN (note: this doesn't mean fast or easy...'cause he clearly spells out the TEN YEARS it takes to get to greatness.)  That said, I am so glad I read this book and hopefully my audiences will be too.Carmine Gallo, wherever you are, bless you for writing this book.
B001EYGOEM|4.0|I'm the last person you'd expect to enjoy Taylor Swift's music--I'm a teenage boy, a drummer, and a guy who the majority of the time likes experimental and adventurous pop music (that exists in the realm of indie rock/pop). But, to be honest, I kinda like Taylor Swift. She crafts songs that, to quote Rolling Stone magazine, \\"sound like they were scientifically engineered in a hit-factory\\". That being said, this album doesn't feel processed or artificial despite the heavy Auto-Tuning and slick production. Seriously, contrary to popular belief, every female singer doesn't have to be a frickin' diva! This seems to be where all the hatred towards Swift and her music stems from. The reality is, Taylor can sell records and write heartfelt songs. In my humble opinion, those are the best things any artist can do (regardless if they are able to sing their songs perfectly in-tune on stage). Fearless is a darn good record: one that shows that Swift already has the musical cred to continue what she is doing now, but as long as her lyrics are this poor of quality, she's gonna have a difficult time truly crossing over to most serious music lovers. You might be wondering that, with all the negative comments I've made, I would rate this album poorly, but the fact is is that I find myself singing along to these songs (embarrassingly enough)...and, well, that's how impressive Taylor Swift is. :) She roped me in from the title track and held me all the way through to the final song. As far as mainstream pop music goes, this is pretty much a winner!
0385504225|2.0|I know that others have said the same things, but the plot didn't make any sense once all was revealed.  Dan Brown did a good job of writing a fast-moving thriller, but the payoff at the end didn't make any sense.  Additionally, the characters' motivations did not make much sense either.  I am still not sure what the bad guy thought he was going to accomplish.  Overall the book held my attention, but I felt that the plot fell apart at the end like Angels and Demons.  I think that Brown has a few good ideas, but never really thinks them through.

0977476049|4.0|THE TRANSLATION    Despite its historical significance, few English speakers actually read this book.  This is partly due to its reputation as a difficult read.  Ford has set out to produce what amounts to a current plain language translation.  In this respect, he has succeeded rather admirably.  The Ford translation is very easy to digest and breaths real life into the text.  Compared to some translations, it does a very good job in giving a modern, immediate, and clear voice to the work.  One has the consistent sensation that he is understanding the author clearly--and consulting other translations seems to validate this feeling.  In the end, this clarity and immediacy of the translation along with the fine audio book narration, are the main redeeming qualities of the Ford volume.  They were leading values for and and are likely to be for many potential readers.  Hence my positive rating of the product.  Bear this in mind.      Ford has also explicitly marketed the book as a being significantly more accurate than those translations that have come before.  I remain skeptical.  In particular, the author's consciously unconventional translation of certain words that are heavily used throughout the book (notably Völkish and Weltanschauung, and the sense given to Bourgeois) deserves careful criticism--criticism that is, frankly, beyond my German.  Others here have hashed through this end of the translation issue here and I'll leave the matter to them.      THE (VERY BAD) NOTES    Part of Ford's scheme for making Mein Kampf accessible are his expositional notes.  The concept of these notes is an indispensable one as many references in the book are particularly obscure to 21st century non-German-speaking readers.  However, as executed, they are a mess. Sometimes notes are given for inappropriate things (battery) and sometimes they are omitted when they are clearly needed.  More of a concern is that many describe their topic in a very questionable way--either by omissionor slight mischaracterization.  However, these failings could readily be overlooked, if that were the extent of the problem.  What cannot be forgiven are the glaring and, frankly, preposterous factual errors present in a few of these notes.      For example, where the author talks about how developments in transportation are effectively shrinking the Germany, we get the helpful little note that states that:      \\"Germany is a little larger than Nevada.\\"    Okay.  Modern Germany is about 137,800 square miles, while Nevada is about 110,500.  (Interestingly, New Mexico is much closer at 121,500.)  Of course, the author was speaking of a different Germany--one closer to 181,000 square miles, which is rather bigger than California (163,696).  But, at least this is not terribly wrong . . .      Another note introduces Erich Ludendorff:       \\"Ludendorff was a well-known German General who created the Dolchstoßlegende, the stab-in-the-back theory that German was acting in self-defense.\\"       This weak description of Ludendorff in a book that deals so often with the Great War is itself dismaying.  However, the so-called Dolchstoßlegende is NOT about whether Germany waged war in self-defense or not.  The \\"stab in the back\\" was the hampering of the war effort by putatively disloyal (generally leftist) elements of German society, and the conclusion that this cost Germany success in the War.  This perception, that this \\"stab\\" was the main cause of Germany's defeat--rather than the myriad of other causes--is central both to the book and the ideology of the German nationalist movements of its day.  [An examination of the poorly written Wikipedia article on Ludendorff may suggest a source for this sad nugget.]  This error, while not laughable, is inexcusable.  Others are laughable.      Just when you thought it was safe to go back in the water:    \\"Maximilien Robespierre, Georges Danton, and Jean-Paul Marat, were the three most important figures in the French Revolution of 1789.  Marat was also stabbed in the heart by a six inch dagger during an assassination attempt, which he survived.  This may be the source for Hitler's previous stabbing reference.\\"    [Insert groan of moral pain here.]  While I couldn't identify the previous stabbing reference mentioned (there was, at least, a subsequent one) this apparent slight to Mademoiselle de Corday's distinguished handiwork is breathtaking.    First, I would point out that, even in this day and age, being \\"stabbed in the heart by a six inch dagger\\" correlates very closely with prompt death.  This was probably also true in 1793.  Therefore, common sense should have made this erratum glare.    In any case, Charlotte Corday's use of the bathing Marat as a human pincushion is one of the more celebrated incidents of the French Revolution.  It is probably the second or third most famous assassination by blade in the history of mankind.  Indeed, who else, save Julius Caesar (and poor old Holofernes?), gets painted being stabbed to death more often?  And stabbed to death in a bathtub, no less?  (Marat and Janet Leigh have pretty much staked out, er, reserved that particular territory for themselves.)  Will we next be told that Robespierre was cut on the neck by a falling blade in an execution attempt which he survived?  Suffice to say, Marat did not survive the episode--and, sadly, Miss Corday likewise succumbed to the severance and rude slapping of her own noggin.   This question arises: Is Mr. Ford a prankster? Or did he leave the writing of the notes to a disgruntled member of the Elite Minds staff who felt \\"stabbed in the back\\"?  Or is he trying to help an infant cousin break into writing?  Whatever the explanation is, it isn't good enough.  Mr. Ford should take another stab at these notes and offer a trade in on a new edition with these preposterous errors fixed.    THE LARGER ISSUE IS, how do these almost unbelievably amateurish historical errors reflect on the scholarliness of the book as a whole?  If Mr. Ford wrote these notes himself, it reflects very badly upon his grasp of history, which, in turn, must discredit, to a large degree, the credibility of his translation which, to be accurate, must rely upon a translator understanding the writer's historical context and his pervasive historical references.  If they were instead written by a precocious fourth grader, or a satirist mole, or an intern struggling with the insidious effects of traumatic brain injury, this is of rather limited comfort to the readers, since we still can find no explanation as to how on earth Mr. Ford and Elite Minds team could have allowed this to come to pass.  So, taken in the most favorable light, Mr. Ford is the victim of his improvident delegation/abdication of responsibility for these notes and he never actually read the draft of these notes produced by his sloppy or nefarious research assistant and that, nevertheless, his translation is of the excellent quality that Elite Minds and its boosters claim.  Maybe.  I am not qualified to judge beyond my comments above.  The translation is particularly accessibly and, to my review, at least passably accurate.  I'm still glad I bought it.       THE AUDIO BOOK    The lack of a decent audio version of Mein Kampf is a vacuum that Ford is diligently trying to fill.  I had apprehensions about what the quality of the narration would be, but this narration, which could have been quite entirely horrible, is really quite good.  The principal (male) narrator has an agreeable accent that will not elude the American ear.  His pace and intonation compliment the text well and help bring out the emotion and sarcasm present in many passages.  Critically, he brings real and constant energy to the text that hold the reader's attention in a way a lesser narrator could not do.  The notes are in a female voice which is fine, save for slaughtering certain German words (Goethe comes out \\"Goh-eth.\\").  The mp3 recording itself (96kbs, 32kHz) is slightly marred by subtle audio artifacts attributable either to encoding choices or the recording set up or both.  This is entirely passable.  There is at least one instance of momentary overlap of a second voice track.  The CD comes with an onboard mp3 interface and a large number of extras, including several ebooks and an audio version of the Communist Manifesto.    THE SUBSTANCE OF THE BOOK    The book is invaluable in the historical and ideological context it provides.  It is collage of different topics and ideas ranging from insightful, to tired, to conflicted, to repugnant.  The author's theory of anti-Semitism and of Aryan superiority are unqualified and unabashed.  They are major factors in the book, though not necessarily to the extreme some might expect.  The book goes into some not entirely expected directions, but then tends to circle back to revisit selected themes repeatedly, albeit with a new twist each time.  It certainly betrays its origins as little more than a transcription of a long political oration, but that makes it no less interesting.  Ultimately, it is an inescapable milestone in Twentieth Century history and one will come away from it with a new appreciation of the ideological mechanisms at the heart of National Socialism.         >>From memory, here are some notable topics and ideas from the text.  They are very rough and incomplete and in no particular order or proportion:    The author's origins, family, and formative experiences.  The cause of the miserable situation of Germany in the mid-1920's (not the war itself, but national weakness).  The reasons for the loss of the Great War (poor alliances, national weakness cased by ethnic and ideological heterogeneity).  The weakness of the Weimar republic (parliamentarianism without strong or accountable leaders--itself a system originating in Marxist treachery.)  The path to resurgence of the German nation (the assertively and conscientiously homogenous ethnic state, strong identifiable leadership with a new worldview).  Jewry. (An ethnicity in the guise of religion, lacking creative power to produce art or a productive nation of its own, instead exploits the creativity of all other nations by surreptitious international networks and by Marxism.).  Marxism. (An ideology designed to subjugate all nations to international Jewish interests.).  The conflict of ideas (Even tired old ideas may not be displaced by force, only a powerful new idea can be used to displace an old one).  Religion (Various confessions will all serve the public good and should not be politicized--nor politicize themselves.)  The Aryan Race. (The source of virtually all human creative power.  The ability of a people to create art and build a healthy society is proportional to its Arian blood.)  The Ethnic State.  (Only the ethnically homogeneous state can endure and grow strong.  The Aryan Ethnic state is the one naturally fit to dominate the world.)  A people must have room to grow or must die out.  (Providence would not create a bourgeoning nation like Germany and confine her to such a limited space.)  Expansion by the sword is necessary for national survival. (Throughout history all nations, including Germany, have expanded by the sword and pacifism is naïve and hypocritical.)  [The loud and distinct echo of Friedrich von Bernhardi is very palpable amidst these topics.]  Territorial Expansion of Germany in Europe necessary.  (Germany must grow or decline in terms of population, space to grow is necessary.  \\"Internal\\" colonization and extra-European colonization are unrealistic for Germany.)  Pragmatic considerations of the formation of political movements and parties. (Parties must have a powerful new set of ideas to prevail over existing ones, a small nucleic leadership, dedicated followers).  The formulation and propagation of political ideas and, specifically, methods of influencing public opinion by press and speech (propaganda should be directed at the masses using a few simple uncompromising ideas repeated over and over until the public consciousness accepts them.).  Health and fitness. (A strong body is essential to a strong individual.)  Syphilis. (Syphilis is very, very, very bad.  Aggressive measures that were needed have not been taken. Early marriage should be strongly promoted to help fight the spread of syphilis via Prostitution.)<<

B0026P3G12|3.0|When I first heard Susan Boyle sing, I had tears in my eyes. A voice like a angel with a sense of compassion and elegance, that drew rave reviews and amazement. Critics still judge a voice by its cover and so many dissed her because of the way she looked and dressed. What prejudice! Yet her voice thrilled millions and the sale of her first album demonstrated she has the potential to be a force in the world.    This album, however while promoting her voice did little to show off her best quality. The arrangements were poorly done and her vocalizations felt restricted by whomever was promoting her as if she had to fit in to some further stereotype. Susan Boyle has the voice - now she needs arrangements and promoters who can trust that voice with music that brings out the range and possibility to transform her audience.

He has a style: he makes comedy films touching on serious matters (JUNO deals with teen pregnancy, THANK YOU FOR SMOKING deals with the dangers of tobacco); his films open with significant and elaborate sequences; his main characters offer highly subjective narrations and tend to be self-confident people who end up re-thinking their lives; he tends to favor continued using of a troupe of ensemble actors (here JK Simmons, Sam Elliott, James Bateman).  UP IN THE AIR shares all of these traits and more.  It dares to talk about firing people in a time when everyone in this country is frightened about the job market and somehow manages to show the compassion for both the victims and the perpetrators. It is a challenge of the first order and Reitman makes it work very well.  This is not a feel good comedy; this is a drama with comic relief that addresses serious issues and people's responses to them - employment, relationships, marriage, and apparent self-sufficiency.<br /><br />Ryan Bingham (George Clooney) spends his time in the air, flying to companies across the USA whose CEOs don't want the job of informing employees they are no longer needed.  Ryan manages to make these encounters as human as possible and he is an artist in his work. His personal life is rather arid: his love needs are met by women on the run, he has distanced himself from his family, electing to maintain a sterile one room apartment in Omaha which he uses the few days out of the year when he is not flying. He meets a very beautiful, smart, and seductive woman Alex Goran (Vera Farmiga) and a crazy courtship ensues as they meet in different cities  - both being traveling business people.<br /><br />Things change when Ryan's boss Craig (Jason Bateman) takes on a fresh graduate student with big ideas for reducing the costs of the company.  Natalie Keener (Anna Kendrick) is smart, a focused designer of telecommunications who has sold Craig on the idea of doing the firing remotely rather than spending the money to fly Ryan et al around the country. Ryan bristles and demands that Natalie accompany him on his personalized interview firings before the company goes Skype.  The two - Ryan and Natalie - are paired for an excursion of real life jobs terminations and both learn from each other.  Ryan continues to have trysts with Alex and eventually Ryan, Alex and Natalie party together.  Natalie discovers the human side of Ryan's work and finds the person to person contact difficult.  At the same time Natalie challenges Ryan's inability to form realistic relationships with women.  Hurtful things happen to each to the three fliers, causing each to re-think their career goals as well as their personal needs.<br /><br />Clooney, Farmiga, and Kendrick deliver first class performances (very obviously Oscar worthy), but then so do the many cameo actors in the film: Amy Morton, Melanie Lynsky and Danny McBride as Ryan's needy family, and a long list of very brief but deeply moving cameos of people being fired by an extraordinary group of actors (casting director Mindy Marin deserves an Oscar also).  The gorgeous cinematography is by Eric Steelberg and the music score is by Rolfe Kent (with a special nod to the composer and singer and guitar player who ends the movie credits with a song that summarizes the ideas of the film).  And shining over all of these factors is the superlative, flawless direction of Jason Reitman.  This film may have unpopular themes, but it is most assuredly on of the best films of 2009.  Highly recommended.

0805091742|4.0|I really enjoyed Dr. Gawande's book and thought it was an eye opener for the reasons why we need checklists in this modern time. He explores the use of checklists in surgery, construction, and aeronautics and lauds the value of lists in all these areas. I am a checklist fanatic myself and felt that he emphasized all the right angles as to why such tools are necessary. This book was easy to read, but sometimes, the dialogue gets very technical around surgery and anatomy terms. Not a problem if you are familiar with such things, but may be a bit heavy for those who are not.<br /><br />Overall, I rated this book high and felt it delivered on its promises. My only reservation in not giving it 5 stars was that I thought more energy would be spent on the checklist making process itself and this book is more of a philosophical endeavor into the benefits of making lists.
B001TH8UUA|5.0|I had resisted buying an HDMI cable for years due to the cost.  Paying over $30 for a single cable never seemed worth it to me.  When I finally decided to give in though, I was surprised to find this great bargain on Amazon.  With my Prime membership it arrived in 2 days and I immediately hooked it up.<br /><br />The improvement in both was noticeable and I have reduced some of the tangled mass of wires around my media center.

B000H5V8DG|5.0|This is a great item and I'm glad I bought it.  It was good to see these shows again and realize that I enjoyed them just as much as I did the first time I saw them on TV.
B002ZIAC26|5.0|I like dreamy pop. I'm 56 years old and I liked the Beach boys as a kid in 1962.This was before the Beatles. I liked them and the Four Seasons.  \\"Don't Worry Baby\\" was my idea of pop perfection. So I am a fan of unapologetic pop music.  The Beach House's Teen Dreams  makes me feel good. Sort of reminds me of Fleet Foxes, My Morning Jacket, High Llamas.  The DVD is not up to par with the music. It's actually detracting. And I don't like the recurring motif taken from the hackneyed Temptations' riff from the beginning of \\"My Girl\\"    All the same,  Teen Dreams is still close to perfection.   I am thrilled that I found the review on Pitchfork and that I decided to take a chance on the CD. It's beautiful music and I will be sharing it with friends and family.

B000W7JWUA|5.0|This is a great game that models scarcity and requires the players to make choices among scare resources, how to harvest them, and how to spend them. This game also has many expansions that make it more interesting and increase gameplay possibilities. It's a little hard to pick up, especially if no one can teach you how to play verbally, as the instructions are a bit confusing, but it is well worth the effort to learn how to play. The game challenges you to think on your feet, make risky decisions that may or may not pay off, etc. The game is also different every time you play because the board itself is modular and can be reassembled.
B002TYZKIM|5.0|Love it! As a fan of MJ for most of my life, it would have been a tragedy if I didn't watch this movie.  I went to see it in the movie theater, then went home and bought the Soundtrack CD right after I got home and ordered the DVD the same night. Got my DVD 2 weeks ago and watched it again today.  This is It would have been the greatest concert of all time.  It's just too bad that MJ wasn't able to do even one night of this concert.  I was actually hoping after the first 50 concerts in UK, that he would decide to a few here in the US.  I am truly glad that they did this movie. You are going to be sorry if you don't get this.
B002VKE1K2|1.0|I rented this movie because I wanted to see what all of the hype was about. Sadly, I still have no idea why this made more than $100m in the U.S. The dialogue is AWFUL, the editing leaves much to be desired and the supposedly scary scenes don't even make you jump.    I wish I hadn't wasted 90 mins of my time on this junk.

B0010X745K|5.0|That's right! When the mist rolls in--any mist--you better stay indoors and hide in the closet because you don't know what's out there! When a military experiment goes horribly wrong, some of the residents of a small, Maine town are trapped in a supermarket and ultimately have to defend themselves from monstrous creatures or die. Yet one by one they do die until one man takes his small son and four other people into his SUV and makes a wild attempt to flee. As a writer and a habitual viewer of the macabre I preferred Stephen King's ending in his novella but like the movie ending or not you will be glued to the edge of your seat at the suspense, the horror and the excellent special effects.

Richard Thomas' character doesn't know but it took his little brother and left him and his friends of a small, Maine town warped in mind and spirit. As a writer of the macabre I adore the chilling suspense and the character interactions in this Stephen King classic. Both book and movie are well-worth the purchase. The movie has a fine cast, is well directed and the special effects are also excellent. And Tim Curry will chill your socks off with his bravura performance as the Killer Clown.

0451169514|4.0|I finally finished reading Steven King's most talked about novel. I started September of 2009 and finished Febuary 2010. I wanted to read this because I was a fan of the TV series -- even though the 2nd part of the series was cheesy, especially the end monster/spider.     Here are some high points of the book that I thought were worthy of mention:    - The special frienship bond of the seven friends.  - The many faces it \\"IT.\\"  - The combinination of how Steven King describes the adults and kids fighting the monster (IT) at the same time.    Here are some things that made my flesh boil:    - How did IT murder Tom Rogen?  - Wasted pages on the shoot out in Derry.  - The black spot story was longer than it should have been.  - Mike Hanlon's interview with the senior citizens of Derry.    In summary the book is extremely well written. Steven King's imagination brings horror to a whole new level.
B00008NRI8|5.0|Excellent comedy about liberal lawyer working for business tycoon and then trying to escape from contract.  Good performances by Sandra Bullock and Hugh Grant,

I sent it to British friends; I predict they will love it.
143911000X|5.0|My friends and I absolutely love How I Met Your Mother, and this book was the perfect gift for any barney-wannabe. On top of that it's hilarious.
B002VECM6S|5.0|I can't say enough about this movie.  It was heartwarming and compassionate, a movie that touches your heart-strings, a story you want everyone in your family to see.      Some of the previous comments said the movie was predictable, that is true because it is based on a true story and we know how it ends.  As for Leigh Ann Tuohy (played by Sandra Bullock), she is a very strong, confident women who is true to her convictions and isn't  afraid to stand up to anyone to defend them -- I wish I were more like her.     Quinton Aaron did a beautiful job in the role of Michael Oher, you are cheering for him from the very first scene. Jae Head who played the little 'brother' S.J. Tuohy was a delight.     The entire cast did a great job. This is one of the most inspirational movies I have seen in a long time!!  Kudos to everyone involved.
B001KVZ6G6|1.0|This is without a doubt the worst ever big-budget animated film. Only ethereal unthinking saps would buy any part of this. Even suspending disbelief to below moron status does not save it. How can an adventurer who is pushing 40 when the old-man protagonist is a 10 year old, look to be only ~60 when the ex-10year old is now 70ish? The plot is nonsensical to the extreme and follows no real line. And don't even think about the physics of strings on balloons being sufficient for any of the outcomes that occur. And the Oscar nomination is so ludicrous as to confirm that the Oscars are now little more than ways for Hollowood insiders to push their agendas.
B000063UR2|5.0|Five stars for the inclusion of the original movie that everyone fell in love with.<br /><br />I've worn out three VHS copies and am jazzed to finally have it on DVD.<br /><br />I have also had the CD of the soundtrack for many years and cuts from it are on a variety of my iPod play lists.<br /><br />The score by Tangerine Dream is what MAKES the movie!<br /><br />I could have done without the director's cut. The score doesn't come close to capturing the spirit of the story or scenery; it sounds like a cartoon.<br /><br />Appalling in their absence are the songs \\"Is Your Love Strong Enough\\" and \\"Touched By the Sun.\\"<br /><br />Again, however, the REAL movie is included in this set, so it's easy to just ignore the existence of the butchered version with the wrong music.
B001FB55I0|3.0|I liked this film the least of the films and less than The Sarah Connor Chronicles. I think the action scenes were good and McG did surprisingly well with them and the acting. I think the biggest flaw was having the focus away from John Connor. I don't think the Marcus character was compelling at all. It could have been eliminated at the script stage and the heart transplant in a tent is just ridiculous... With the bidding war on between Lionsgate and Sony over the Terminator rights, this may be the last big budget Terminator film we'll see. It's a shame, I think there is more story to tell...
B001F12J0C|5.0|I love the Bourne trilogy and was disappointed I couldn't find the fancy box set last Christmas.  I saw this one on Amazon and gave it a try.  I think for the money, it's great.  It is only the three movies- no posters, no bells and whistles, but that's what I want: the movies.  So happy with this buy and we've already watched the triology twice this winter (thanks to massive snow falls).  A good buy for any Bourne fan!
B0027BOL4G|4.0|Don't purchase this if you live in Australia. The region code settings wont let you play it in your DVD player.

B001ILFUDM|5.0|I recently bought Pinocchio on Blue Ray, and was blown away by the colors and the quality!  I was skeptical that it could look much better than before, but the Blue Ray did make a huge difference.  I'd recommend this to anyone who wants to add a high quality classic to their collection.  It's worth the extra money.
B001DWXUWY|5.0|I ended up buying this cd on the strength of the song \\"The 59th Sound\\" which was offered free on Amazon for several months. I loved the song so much I figured the rest of the cd couldn't be that bad, so I bought the album and to my delight it blew my expectations into little bits and pieces.<br /><br />This album quite frankly rocks. It's thoughtful, melodic, exciting, occasionally depressing and always amazing. Some of the songs sound a little bit like each other more than I care for, but to be honest it doesn't bother me that much because even though it may be the same music with little variation--the music is still awesome. And then some songs are completely unique like \\"Here's Looking At You Kid\\" which is in my opinion the best song on the album. Many people have compared The Gaslight Anthem to Springsteen, but I find them more reminiscent of The Killers (without the electronic stuff) and Sister Hazel.<br /><br />If you're on the fence about buying this, I would recommend looking up \\"Great Expectations\\" on youtube because it's pretty representative of the rest of the album.
B000MG1YC0|4.0|My understanding is that to most Sirenia fans, this isn't their best album. I've had a listen to some tracks from their other albums, and I also own The 13th Floor. I am not a fan of growls and harsh vocals in symphonic metal so an album like Nine Destinies and a Downfall is something that I personally prefer. I can only really compare this album to The 13th Floor as I haven't heard everything by Sirenia... I know that for each of their 4 albums Sirenia has 4 different singers, and I have heard some criticisms of Monika Pedersen's voice, but I really like her. It's quite different from most of the female fronted metal bands that I listen to... she's definitely not a soprano singer, but I still think she has some great talent.<br />If you're considering purchasing this album, really think about the type of music you like... if you're a fan of the growls and harsh vocals (of bands like Tristania, Epica and Leaves' Eyes)or if you're a Sirenia fan of earlier albums, then you probably shouldn't buy this album.<br />If you have never bought a Sirenia album before, then I would recommend this one...<br /><br />I think that if this is your first Sirenia album then you're lucky because you can appreciate the great music of this album without thinking \\"OMG! It's nothing like their other work, ewwwww!\\" Then you can decide for yourself... Do you like harsh vocals? If so, buy their earlier albums.<br /><br />I think the problem is that people generally like the first thing that they hear or see. For example, similar to my Sirenia purchasing, I bought my first Within Temptation album; The Heart of Everything.... apparently a lot of Within Temptation fans dislike this album as it is too \\"poppy\\" and tries to appeal to a greater audience like the U.S. Perhaps Sirenia is trying to do the same? If you look at their latest album The 13th Floor, I would describe it as pretty \\"poppy\\"... which is what I dislike... as well as Ailyn's voice too...<br />I absolutely prefer Nine Destinies and a Downfall to The 13th Floor...<br /><br />In a way Nine Destinies and a Downfall is an epic album... by \\"epic\\" I mean, though each song has its own story, the music is quite similar and flows well like an extended poem.<br /><br />Okay, so I think I should talk about the album a bit more... I must give credit to Morten Veland as the lyrics are amazing! And to the choir... they are great =)<br />Female vocals and the choir appear on all tracks... Next to each song below, I have listed where there are other vocals appearing.<br />1.\\"The Last Call\\" - 4:45 - I absolutely love this song. It is a strong opener to the album.<br />2.\\"My Mind's Eye\\" - 3:38 - I am completely adore this song. Very catchy; \\"poppy\\". You will listen to this song over and over.<br />3.\\"One By One\\" - 5:30 - Another great song... The Sirenia choir is quite soothing in contrast to the heavy guitar riffs.<br />4.\\"Sundown\\" - 5:04 - I noticed in one of the reviews of this song there was mention of Monika's voice \\"straining\\" on some of the lyrics. Personally I do not think that it is her voice straining, but rather intentional. It's not like it was a high note to reach or anything. I was however disappointed with the harsh male vocals (Morten)... I always find that they (any harsh male vocals) ruin a female's vocals... I know that some people like the contrast in vocals... I much prefer a band to leave it only to the constrast between the metal music and the celestial female vocals... maybe even adding clean male vocals like Marco Hietala from Nightwish. So despite the disappointing chorus which is just harsh male vocals, the verses are really beautiful, accompanied with amazing music, and the choir again appear.<br />5.\\"Absent Without Leave\\" - 4:53 - Clean male vocals on this track (they're alright... I'm not a big fan of them). This song is okay... not great, but okay.<br />6.\\"The Other Side\\" - 3:55 - Very catchy song... as another review stated, this is a radio-friendly song; \\"poppy\\".<br />7.\\"SevenKeys And Nine Doors\\" - 4:55 - Harsh male vocals and clean male vocals on this track. It's a great song and I really enjoyed the start, with the choir... the clean male vocals are okay... there's a bit of harsh vocals, not too much... which is good.<br />8.\\"Downfall\\" - 4:44 - Harsh male vocals on this track. Amazing start to the song with the violins... and the recurring violins. I really love this song and was again disappointed with the harsh male vocals... I thought they just ruined the song. The choir, again, are excellent... BUT the following harsh male vocals... I could have cried... the song was so beautiful until that point. The lyrics are great though, in my opinion, not as good as some of the earlier songs on this album. However, this song is good enough to be a single... and probably should have been released as one.<br />9.\\"Glades Of Summer\\" - 5:37 - A nice soothing song to follow Downfall. A good end to the album.<br />Bonus Track on the enhanced-CD version:<br />\\"My Mind's Eye (Radio Edit)\\" - 3:17s track. It's a great song and I really enjoyed the start, with the choir... the clean male vocals are okay... there's a bit of harsh vocals, not too much... which is good.  8.\\"Downfall\\" - 4:44 - Harsh male vocals on this track.

0547258305|3.0|I liked lots of things about this book, but some aspects were disappointing. I loved the idea of certain people being born with \\"Graces,\\" and that each person's Grace was unique. I enjoyed the romance and the strong female character. The suspense and action were satisfying too.    I usually don't like the type of fantasy with a kingdom and weird names like \\"King Randa\\" and \\"Giddon.\\" That's just a personal preference (or lack thereof), so it's not a criticism. It took me over 200 pages to get interested or hooked on the story, however, and that's too long.    My greatest disappointment was with the strong anti-marriage message. It was suggested through the main character that if she married, she would lose all freedom. That may have been true if she had married the guy who proposed to her early in the book, a man she didn't love inviting her into a marriage of the old-fashioned type. I suppose there is some degree of freedom you might lose with marriage, but there are many strong advantages to marriage too, especially considering the man Katsa loves in this book. I felt actually like it was a weakness in her to think marriage would rob her of her strength--is she so weak that she couldn't remain strong just because she made a commitment to a great guy? It seemed distrustful and selfish that she wouldn't be willing to commit to Po; he clearly had no intention of controlling her in any way. I'd hate to have young girls thinking this way about marriage. Marriage done the right way enhances your strengths, your life, and your identity. So that message definitely took a lot away from the book for me.
B001AVCFK6|4.0|When I ordered this video I was under the impression that I was purching a dvd not a blu ray disk.  I was dissappointed that the label on the order was not more clear.  At present I don't own a blu ray player and it took some time before I could find one to borrow just to play this movie.  On the 4 star side, the movie itself is very good.  Kirk was just a arrogant as in the TV shows.  The Spock character was less than Vulcan. McCoy was delightful,  Checkov was comical, and Sulu...ever the swashbuckler... well, was Sulu.

B002HWRYJE|5.0|It is a total tribute to the Original Series and cast. The actors chosen to represent younger versions of the crew of the original series Star Trek was near perfect casting.     This movie not only gives us a great back story on how the original crew of the USS Enterprise got together, it also ties up a lot of loose ends from the original series.     It was a pure stroke of genius to create an alternate history for the Star Trek universe, opening a wide door to possible sequels, or even a new TV series showing how the universe was changed by the events depicted here.    An ABSOLUTE MUST SEE for any true Star Trek fan

B000MD9UJC|3.0|The light is a bit dimmer than the previous incandescent bulb. When I first used it in my flashlight the light span was very wide and unevenly dispersed, you may have to bend one or all three LED's to point foreword more accurately. I was hoping that the button would be a hold on button, it is a toggle button. You can not focus the light by turning the head on the light, that feature is no longer relevant with the LED 'upgrade'       This product will save battery life. But to my standards I am not satisfied, my recommendation would be to purchase a Maglight that comes with the LED light. This way you still have the focus feature. The light will be brighter and more on the spot. No tampering required. I bought the 4D LED Maglight and I am extremely satisfied with it and it outshines my truck headlights.

B000002B2T|5.0|This album is an ultimate representation of music as art in its pure form. Written by four good friends: McCready, Martin, Baker, and Staley just for the sake of music itself, and not for acquiring fame or commercial success, this unique record is as close to a masterpiece as it gets. It is not an easy listen, which is not necessarily a bad thing. The music has enough hooks and beautiful melodies to grab your attention on the first listen, and Layne's magnificent haunting vocals illuminates the record's multidimensional, introspective and sincere lyrics. At the same time, this record is very rough around the edges, it's not even and well polished, and requires a deeper level of understanding, which comes after listening to it multiple times. Only then every sound on the record falls into place, and allows for a much greater enjoyment of this masterpiece on different levels. It never grows old, as it constantly evolves with time, more you listen to it.

As someone else mentioned, when I hear any song on the Twilight cd, I can envision the scene that it goes with. The baseball scene is a perfect example. You could never imagine a more perfect song than Supermassive Black Hole for that scene! With a few exceptions, I really don't get that connection with this cd. It's ok, but Twilight was phenomenal. I still listen to it almost every day.

1615230823|5.0|The common conception is that success is based upon intelligence: Orientals are more intelligent, therefore they excel in academics; the poor, living in slums, are not bright, therefore they achieve little or no success. Gladwell demonstrates with many examples that his notion is wrong.<br /> Scientists have found that the people of Roseto, Pennsylvania, for example, of Italian descent, live longer than their neighbors or their Italian ancestors because they socialize, and the socialization reduces their tensions. But, in another example, parents can affect children. A genius whose parents never taught him how to relate to other people and who never learnt it on his own, remained a farmer throughout his life, while individuals with much lower IQs accomplished much because they were taught how to deal with people. Similarly, descendants of feuding Appalachians absorbed their ancestors' manners and tended to become angry and aggressive and vindictive.<br /> Much more than IQ, persistence and practice lead to success. Gladwell shows how people such as Bill Gates, the Beatles, and even Mozart, despite their innate skills and intelligence, would not have been successful if they did not practice for some 10,000 hours. Similarly, studies have shown that by extending the daily hours of schooling of slum children, giving them three hours of homework after leaving school at 5 PM, and cutting down on their summer vacation, led to a sizable percentage of these children being able to attend college and secure good jobs. He shows also that Orientals do not have a higher IQ than other people. They are descendants of ancestors who worked on rice paddies virtually every hour of the day 360 days a year. The work required meticulous care. This way of acting and thinking affected their posterity and prompted them to achieve and seem smarter than others.

Also practical help.  Even though it is somewhat dated, I think the revised edition just didn't hit home with me.  This edition, with the attractive cover I bought as a gift for my granddaughters.  I have a well worn underlined edition that I use.  Gwenn
B00005JCAA|5.0|I've been a moviegoer since the fifties and had the supreme pleasure to behold many great films on the silver screen. But Martin Brest broke the mold when he made \\"MEET JOE BLACK\\". Positively, and without question the finest movie I've ever seen. I turned 62 last year. I had seen the movie several times since 1998. But, I started watching it again with a renewed vigor, primarily because like most of us (who rush through life, not stopping to smell the fragrant roses along the way) I realized like Bill Parrish that I'm definitely closer the the end, than the beginning. Or, am I closer to a beginning than the end? Every nuance, smile, grimace, frown and glance by each and every actor is so utterly and totally focused and perfectly scored with swells of emotion that one must view this masterpiece over and over to even get a glimpse of the profound concepts explored in this epic.     Now, after viewing this film scores of times, I weep with Bill Parrish when he contemplates the wonderful gifts of his life and the fleeting moments that remain for him. Each of us should view this film and reflect upon our lives; God-given gifts of our families and friends that touch our lives as we touch them and marvel at this masterpiece that we call life \\"how quickly it passes\\".     You must....\\"MEET JOE BLACK\\".
1400052173|2.0|At its heart, this is the story of the Lacks family and the cell line that was spawned from one woman, Henrietta Lacks. It is also the story, in a vague sense, of what the research done on those cells meant to her daughter, Deborah Lacks. It purports to be more than this, and many have willingly, indeed gladly, swallowed those claims, but I think that they lack support. For example, it purports to be about the history of medicine, but it is not. Rather, it discusses events that took place at one institution (Johns Hopkins Hospital) in one time frame, and then distorts them and seeks to make the reader form broad generalizations about scientists and doctors, and their actions and morals.    For example, in the beginning of the book, where Henrietta goes to Johns Hopkins to be diagnosed, Rebbecca Skloot seems to relish mentioning the fact that Henrietta Lacks was in the colored ward. At the very least, she takes every possible opportunity to work it into the story, along with the fact that she was African-American and her doctors were white. These facts are, quite honestly, completely incidental to the story. If you read this book, the people with whom Rebbecca Skloot spoke reliably mentioned that she received the standard of care for her time, regardless of her race. Despite this fact, Ms. Skloot goes out of her way to mention that, quite often, patient care was different for African-Americans than whites. In every way, Rebbecca Skloot seems to have sought out anything that would provoke outrage in readers. In the end, it is not clear, whether this was a result of Rebbecca Skloot framing her book in this fashion to win the approval and trust of the family (which may or may not have been necessary to receive their permission for printing) or whether it was a malicious gambit to improve sales.    By the end, I found the book obnoxious on many levels.    First, the vilification of scientists and doctors who are providing the standard of care, calling into question theirintentions and actions without even allowing most of them (or their families) to speak on their behalf, combined with her constant framing of Henrietta's treatment as a race issue, which it clearly wasn't if you are paying attention, seems guaranteed to cast the doctors in the light of the villain, while Henrietta's family, with their self-imposed medical conditions, as victims of the doctors, society, and, well, everyone but themselves.    Second, the repetition of the stories about Johns Hopkins doctors \\"stealing\\" patients off of the street (who were inevitably characterized as African-Americans, as opposed to the white doctors), without bothering to look up something as simple as the number of people who were reported missing near Johns Hopkins to similar urban neighborhoods without a major research and medical clinic, shows, clearly, her bias and intent. I guess, though, that would merely give her the opportunity to claim that most people weren't reported missing because they were poor African-Americans, and the white police didn't want to take the missing persons reports. <Rolls eyes>    Third, the vilification of scientists, was annoying beyond measure. Many, many times in the course of the book, Rebbecca Skloot would present ridiculous headlines fron the past, where a member of the press would dramatically misunderstand the findings of a scientist and would make some insane, sordid claim that would instill a greater fear of science into lay people. Admittedly, this is also the fault of the scientists involved, as they really need to do a better job of making sure that the press understands the story. (Which won't stop the press and journalists from misrepresenting it ANYWAY, but may stop some accidents, at least.) And that is really where this book lets us down, as we have to sit through the exaggerated claims that are in this book. But, in the end, I guess that is the difference between journalists and scientists. Scientists PROVE things, journalists SELL things.    Fourth, as a good example of this framing problem, Rebbecca Skloot spends three or so pages talking about the sociopathic behavior that a disgraced scientist exhibited, including a support for eugenics. While it is true that there were some scientists that were in favor of eugenics, there were others, including Thomas Hunt Morgan, who spoke out, vehemently, against the practice. Moreover, it is blatantly misleading to paint eugenics as a solely scientific endeavor. Rather, it included such luminaries as Sir Francis Galton (an anthropologist and statistician), H.G. Wells, Presidents Woodrow Wilson and Theodore Roosevelt, future Prime Minister Winston Churchill, Emile Zola (a novelist),  economists John Keynes, Irving Fisher, and Sidney Webb, and, notably, the journalists George Bernard Shaw and Lothrop Stoddard (and probably a lot more, but journalists don't tend to make history like people who DO things). None of this makes the practice, supported by so many scientists, any more excusable. If anything, their participation is what gave it such awful credibility, and they bear more responsbility than anyone. Nevertheless, none of these figures are mentioned, nor is the overwhelming popularity of the movement, worldwide. A little context would have been nice.    As I said at the outset, the irresponsible and inaccurate framing of the cultural surroundings of the book mar the story and make it impossible to really understand what happened and why. In the end, readers are left with an unjustified sense of outrage, and little new learned. At least, little that is accurate.

I have just spent six hours trying to hook in a simple javascript function to my php application.  UGH!  I swear some of the coding examples in the book are just plain wrong!   I finally got the function to recognize a 'hello world' program both written in the file and in an external file.  I had to go to the web for a simple tutorial to do this.  I now have a five line program that just plain doesn't work!  So I looked up 'debugging' in the 'DEFINITIVE' guide.  It is clueless.  So am I.  I have never, ever had this much trouble picking up a new language from a book.    I have to give this book a rating of 1.

B000OVLINI|4.0|It came across as a first book from a really talented writer.  It's structured like a mystery, and the young protagonist is wonderfully involved.  However, instead of letting him figure out the mystery, all the answers are simply dumped in his lap, wholesale, by a secondary character.  For me that was a real let down.<br /><br />Worse, though, was the lack of good physical description of post war Barcelona.  I would have liked to have received a more sensory filled description of this very unique city at a singularly interesting time.  Instead, I got a lot of stock 'it was a stormy night' descriptions that could have come from any one of a number of locales around the world.<br /><br />The story is imaginative, original and powerful.  It starts very slowly, but introduces a number of interesting and engaging characters.  It's a good book that points to some very good things to come from Carlos Zafon.
0307473708|5.0|This review also covers other books in the series, as well as the derived TV treatment.<br /><br />Clearly the writers and producers of the TV series have a healthy respect for the original work, as the first half of the book and Episode One of the series track more closely than most adaptations.  Many complete lines of dialog or internal monologue are transferred virtually verbatim. From that point on, however, they diverge rapidly towards a very different concluding scene to the main plot, and significantly different developments in the longer plot-line of Dexter's life and relationships.<br /><br />It is refreshing in a way to find a written work expanded rather than cut down in an adaptation to a dramatic visual medium.  Most of what was done to the stretch the main plot was inventive and in keeping with the spirit of the original work.  Only the many unrelated side-plots become tedious over time, but that is a review of the show, not this book series.<br /><br />Ultimately, the Dexter books are a delightfully entertaining and thought-provoking experience independently of the TV series.  Plus these are among the fastest most propulsive and economically written works I have had the pleasure of plummeting through since first reading the best works of Vonnegut.  I find Dexter so often giving cleverly-phrased voice to my deepest misgivings about much of human behavior which is elsewhere left unquestioned as normal.  I feel like Dexter and Lindsay have found far too easy access to the darkest corners of my own psyche, and leave me wondering just how thin and fragile our veneer of civilization truly may be.<br /><br />Right now I am halfway through the third book, which introduces some new twists to both the world of the character and the form of the writing which bring a new level of unease and fear to the reading experience.  This is doubly twisted, considering that we are frightened on behalf of one of the most unlikely sympathetic protagonists in the history of fiction.<br /><br />Lindsay's works present a credible belief in the existence of true evil in a way that seems to come naturally to those who have lived in a war zone, or South Florida.<br /><br />My only criticism is an apparent peculiar attitude towards the physically disabled, essentially stating that being less than physically perfect renders a person useless and less than human.  This is most clearly brought to into play in starting in the second book.  It is hard to sort out how much of this is the voice of the first-person main character, and how much of it is reflective of the attitudes of the author.  This is particularly curious in the context of a work that which extends the reader's sympathy for the mentally aberrant to an unprecedented degree.sent a credible belief in the existence of true evil in a way that seems to come naturally to those who have lived in a war zone, or South Florida.

B002T9H2MO|5.0|I rated this movie 5 stars because it delivered more than expected when I picked it up.  While it is a science fiction film, there are no aliens or monsters or viruses running rampant.  What this film is is a drama and/or mystery.  This film is intelligently done and very well acted.  The special effects are few, basically moon vehicles on a moonscape.  Pay attention to what is going on and you watch the plot unfold and the protagonist disentagrate.  I liked this move and would recommend it, although it lacks action and isn't a thrill a minute roller coaster ride.
B0001CNRSE|1.0|I am happy to say I didn't spend money on seeing this film in the movie theaters.   The acting in the film is horrible. Alba was cast for her looks. Her acting in this film is soooo over the top I couldn't bare to watch anymore.    The dancing was great and had me wishing I could move like that but everything else about the film... SUCKED!!!!!    I would not recommend this movie to ANYBODY. Just terrible.

B002XTBE6K|5.0|Finally!!!! This for me is simply the best adaptation of this book yet. The casting, I find flawless and the screenplay dialog was natural and organic. Emma was everything she needs to be, the character transformation was beautifully developed which I found missing in other adaptations. The acting on everyone's part was superb and I highly rate it as a MUST SEE for all Austen and non-Austen fans.

B001GCUO4S|2.0|I am so glad I only spent one dollar at REDBOX to rent this crap. It has nothing to do with the characters of the previous films, and making it 3D is some marketing ploy to sell this total trash. Ridiculous \\"freak\\" accidents that made me laugh out loud! Gee so many places of business in this movie that are so dangerous and accident-prone. Maybe OSHA should be called? If you watch this, then I suggest just to fast forward to all the accidents. Better yet just rent it for $1 at REDBOX. Too bad I can't get my dollar back.
B000J10EQU|3.0|Bryan Singer's take on the Man of Steel.  Said to be a sequel to SUPERMAN & SUPERMAN II, it lacks the feel of the Donner film and not even the Donner/Lester amalgamation that is the 2nd film.  I like Brandon Routh as Kent/Superman.  He isn't Christopher Reeve but he does a pretty decent job.  Kevin Spacey is a truly vile and vicious Lex Luthor, Parker Posey a trip as his girlfriend Kitty.  Frank Langella is ok as Perry White (stepping in after Hugh Laurie had to bow out), Sam Huntington a good Jimmy Olson and Eva Marie Saint as Ma Kent.  As the acting goes, the weak link is Kate Bosworth.  She is such a lousy Lois Lane.  What killed this project -- it was a $200 million production that made money but not enough (movies have to do double their cost to break EVEN) -- it is dark, it is violent and long and kinda boring.  What Singer managed to infuse into the X-Men franchise he couldn't do for the Man of Steel.  Will we see another Superman adventure on the big screen?  I am confident.  It might be years but you can't keep a good man down.
B002SJIO54|4.0|I don't understand critics who fault the movie for allegedly getting \\"mired\\" in action and violence toward the end. This is a sci-fi action movie, with the added bonus of an original storyline that explores serious themes. That is what makes it a brilliant movie. Yes, there are lots of action sequences at the end, but they serve the plot - namely advancing the cause of the main characters. The violence and action represent obstacles for the main characters to overcome, essential to any decent plot. Nor was I surprised by the violence in the movie - as District 9 is clearly represented as a powder keg waiting to explode.

0385512058|5.0|Ferrazzi has Hit the nail on the head with his book. Nailing down exactly what it is that makes the business world go round. Of all my years in the Construction business I often knew that 'who I knew' was more important than what I knew. Being 'Friends' with someone caries an enormous amount of of weight with everyone. Now some will take offense and say that 'merit' at least should be the mark of how we pick our people we work with. But Ferrazzi points out that given an efficient number of people who 'can' do the job at relatively the same level of expertise which one would you pick, someone you know and trust or the unproven abilities of the new guy? Ferrazzi teaches that 'getting to know' people is the best way to get yourself out of the 'new guy' category and into the 'known and trusted'.   Most books I read have some 'quicky' formula that has been arbitrarily decided as the 'the fix' for this selling problem. Ferrazzi points out that it is simply the Art of making friends and being friendly. That there is a power in Helping others. wheither your business associate feels obligated to Help you back or simply decides 'I like that guy, lets use him', This book shows you how it's done. How getting things done in the Real World really works.

B00005JKJA|5.0|Like life, this film gives us a swirling soup of experience from which we have to construct a meaning. That the meaning we arrive at is by no means predetermined & unambiguous, as well as the fact that we first have to undo the macrame Diane has woven from the strands to justify herself makes this gem of a film linger in the mind.<br /><br />While many reviewers seem to throw their hands in the air & claim that this film is not meant to have any real coherence, just atmosphere, I disagree. There are certainly thought-provoking ambiguities, but there is also deep structure that keeps us enthralled by the story. The hero arcs, just not happily.<br /><br />There seems to be some common confusion about a number of the scenes & characters. Here are my interpretations of some of the most frequently asked questions. Beware of spoilers!:<br /><br />This film has been called a dream by several reviewers, but to me it's more just the way the mind works all the time, constantly mashing things up, rewriting events until a final version of history is reached, usually on reflection & in consultation with others. Especially if--like our protagonist--you are wigged out about broken love, probably on drugs, & seriously depressed about your career. For instance, how many times have you worked out this kind of detail with your significant other?: so, who was that person at the party? Oh, I thought he was her brother. No? Her boyfriend? Didn't she work for Xerox? Oh, it was Kodak. Wasn't that the other girl? I thought he had dark hair. His name is Dave, right? No, John...etc. Now turn that process into pictures & it looks a lot like Mulholland Drive.<br /><br />How do we know that Diane was involved in prostitution?<br /><br />Did you notice that the prostitute in the scene with the hitman [pimp?] matched the general description of Diane, i.e. blond, passive, young? Did you wonder how a struggling actress might have known a hitman to call to bump off her ex-lover? In fact, there are a lot of blonds in this movie, & they all seem to represent Diane--either her delusional ideals or her reality.<br /><br />Why is Camilla/Rita such a darling of the mafia dons who are pushing to get her in the lead role of \\"The Sylvia North Story\\"?<br /><br />I found the power-brokers to be far more symbolic than real. They were Greek Gods, dispensing favor capriciously, spurning sincere burnt offerings [espresso, I love it!], & selecting favorites more or less on whim. At least that was Diane's perception of things, although the audition scene clearly suggests that Camilla's acting chops & screen sexuality were much stronger than Diane's, even though we saw the scene as though Diane was the actress. The theme of Greek mythology was hit on in the opening scene as well, as the man in the coffee shop acts out a convincing oracle, & later, as the Lee Grant character predicts impending doom to deaf ears like Cassandra. There's also something vaguely Odyssean about the pool guy & unfaithful wife grappling with the indifferent giant.<br /><br />How do we know that Aunt Ruth was dead in real life?<br /><br />Diane tells us at the dinner party. Also, where else would a struggling actress have gotten a large amount of cash to slide across a table to a hitman if not from that inheritance? Maybe having spent her last resource helped push her over the edge.<br /><br />Why did Rita feel compelled to cut her hair after the \\"Silencio?\\"<br /><br />Diane was putting things back together in her mind, realizing the consequences of her actions, separating the reality of herself from the fairytale version conflated from her initial naivete & inflated perception of her talent, talent that was actually Camilla's. The two characters beginning to look alike demonstrates this recognition, as does the final disappearance of Rita.<br /><br />What was the purpose of the older couple she met on her flight into Hollywood & at the end of the film?<br /><br />To me, the old couple seem to symbolize hope--the hope of a naive young actress just arriving in Hollywood, the hope that was the only thing that Pandora managed to hold in the box after she released all ills on humanity [Greek mythology again], & the hope that escaped that blue box when it was dropped in the brown paper bag by the beast behind Winkie's near the end [perhaps also a comment on Diane's substance abuse]. The torment of failed hope in the form of the fluttering hands of the old couple was what finally caused Diane to pull the trigger.<br /><br />In addition to the repeating Greek mythology theme, something I haven't heard other reviewers mention is how blatantly referential the imagery of this film is to Hollywood. Diane's early outfits [& hair] look like they were done by Edith Head for a Hitchcock film; the early scenes of the dance contest look like Annette Funicello will appear any second; Cowboy looks like a live-action Howdy Doody; & actors seem to have been chosen for their industry resonance: Ann Miller, Chad Everett, Billy-Ray Cyrus.that Pandora managed to hold in the box after she released all ills on humanity [Greek mythology again], & the hope that escaped that blue box when it was dropped in the brown paper bag by the beast behind Winkie's near the end [perhaps also a comment on Diane's substance abuse].

0823003035|5.0|I love life drawing (from models, not from anatomy books or photos) and while I am very capable of producing lively, instant and strong \\"alla prima\\" drawings from the figure, I find it difficult to execute a \\"finished\\" drawing, in the classical way, if I wanted to. I find it particularly difficult to render skin tone and shadows in a way that unifies the figure.  I bought this book based on its cover and editorial review, mostly because of the appeal of the classically executed nude and the range of contrast, the skin rendering the author was able to deliver. I wanted to learn more about this.    While I agree with comments from 1 and 2 stars ratings that the title does not reflect the content (this is NOT a \\"complete guide\\" to figure drawing as I think it does not take the \\"want to be\\" life drawer or the beginner to the level of drawing Ryder is capable of. But it is of a tremendous help and inspiration to the artist who has already a sound knowledge of anatomy and drawing in general. The book describes many tips and hints and techniques which make your drawing move to higher grounds, stand out from the page, the text and directions are VERY CLEAR if you understand drawing.     I have to say that I am a medium experienced artist, and as such I am tired of \\"how to\\" books that try and cover every level of technique, starting with info that is often far too basic (what brand of pencil to buy, 2 points perspective) and only touching up on more advanced skills (which by the way are the ones that will make you actually PROGRESS).   While this particular book does mention some basic skills (how to achieve 'tone', variety of lines and hatching methods required to master Ryder's style) and some principles (Ryder bases is method on drawing the contour, then drawing on the inside), the actual level and quality of the teaching and information delivered is exceptional.    One buyer complained about the lack of \\"how to\\" (step by step) demonstrations to deliver a particular drawing from the book. If you actually READ the text, you do not need any. Each chaper is a step in Ryder's method. If you read and understand the techinques described, then you internalise the teaching and go and PRACTICE it next time you draw from a LIVE model.     In conclusion, I find this book worth reading and keeping as a reference, but would not recommend this as a \\"STARTING\\" book for the beginner. The title is definitely misleading from this point of view.

James Horner is an expert at capturing not only the story of the film but all of the emotions a viewer experiences while watching the movie.  Bravo! James Cameron for teaming up with James Horner again to help fans relive the movie everytime they hear this wonderful soundtrack.  You are both masters of your art.
0064407667|5.0|The book of lemony snicket is good it's full of adventure.I like klause because he always read books and he's a smart boy he know's everything.There were slaves because their parents died even their house is burn they dont have parents anymore.I dont like their uncle because he wants to kill he's       children and get their money.
B002IR3PSC|5.0|Considering how old this concert is, this is amazing quality and an excellent concert!!! (I was there!)
B0010MTLA2|5.0|This album is a long time favorite of mine. Lucky for me I get a Japanese edition, (that as sold out), that is the best you can have in CD edition.  Great item.
B002N8A14M|5.0|This case is exactly what I was looking for: a low-profile hard plastic case that covers the screen, comes with a clip, and includes a detachable armband.     The case itself is high quality clear plastic that has holes for the hold switch, the scroll wheel, and the plugs beneath. I use Nike+ with this case and have no issues.     The plastic case comes in two pieces: one slips over the top end of the nano (the end with the hold button), and the other piece slips over the bottom of the nano (the end with the headphone jack).     Bottom line: you can't beat the price and functionality of this product. I've only had it for a week, and I'm already enamored. Would definitely recommend to friends.
B002YVAT72|5.0|I received this as a gift from my wife and was really surprised at how well this inexpensive turntable has performed. I have used it to convert some of my large collection of vinyl over to digital and the music sounds great. I don't recommend the EZ Vinyl software as it doesn't allow the user much control over the recording process. I use Spin It Again and recommend you try it instead.
0307460444|2.0|Purchased this book because I'm a huge cupcake fan and a foodie. I use only the finest ingredients, and always love finding great recipes.<br /><br />This book is not a book for stellar recipes. Something consistent among all the ones i created from this book is that they end up turning out very dense and thick-cakey. None are light. None are fluffy, and the flavour profile is very amateur.<br /><br />Two specific ones I'd like to point out are the peanut butter cupcakes - they turned out just gross and thick and bland<br />The basic coconut cupcakes didn't even taste like coconut.. i even made a 2nd batch and added more coconut milk and flakes..<br /><br />Anyhow, ..  all this to say, and i am convinced of it.. that this book just has Martha Stewart's name on it, but really isn't up to the MS quality you come to expect.<br />Save your money and get another book. The recipes and photos themselves are presented beautifully.. but regretfully this is not a book you that you'd want to buy expecting to make cupcakes that will dazzle your friends.<br /><br />quite the opposite infact.
B000OF2C84|1.0|I bought the book because I read Bill Bryson's \\"A Walk in the Woods\\" on a plane, some years ago. I laughed so hard my seatmate scootched as far away as possible, worried for my sanity--and the cola spurting from my nose. Passengers three rows back peered over their seats to view the commotion.<br /><br />By contrast, \\"The Lost Continent\\" seemed small and mean-spirited. It was filled with stereotypes of southerners (lazy, prejudiced, unkempt, talk slowly and unintelligibly), tourists (fat, dressed funny, were consumately rude, especially the older women), the Amish, any quaint town, big city, shopping mall, fast food joint--too crowded, greasy, unfriendly--or the one that was friendly seemed suspiciously so--they were probably from outer space and were going to take him back to their planet, though, by then, I didn't know why they'd want him. Motel/hotels were too expensive-dirty-small. Tourist attractions, too full of tourists, weather, too warm or cold.<br /><br />He didn't like much except the baseball hall of fame at Cooperstown, and the Grand Canyon for the thirty seconds the fog lifted; was impressed with Las Vegas.<br /><br />Mr. Bryson had little good to say about people, though his contacts seemed limited to getting out of his car, being disappointed with whatever, or not wanting to stand in line, and huffing back to the vehicle, driving off and getting lost--again. Not much chance to get to know a feller, that way.<br /><br />I was puzzled as to why this talented man continued his trip and why when he was in such a snit, he wrote a book that was bound to irritate most of the people of his natal land. No wonder he and his family moved to London.<br /> I hear it's clean, never rains, has capatious hotels, great food and service--HA!
B001VPJYZK|5.0|Gift to my college age daughter and she loved it, watched it over her break.
B00288KNL8|5.0|My children loved this movie. They love just about anything that Tim Burton puts out there.
B002K0WBXW|4.0|I had seen the film in theatres and really like it so I bought the DVD so I could watch it again from time to time.
B0026P3G12|5.0|Awesome CD but wish she would have done some music all in the same type such as all Xmas or all Pop etc.
B001KVZ6G6|4.0|We have thoroughly enjoyed this movie.  First of all, the story is great and quite dramatic and early on a bit sad, but later on the old man's spirit triumphs over despair and the movie turns into quite the adventure.<br /><br />The quality of the Blue Ray disc is very good. The audio quite good also, but not amazing.  We saw this movie in the theater in Dolby 3D and it was amazing, so watching it on Blue Ray WITHOUT 3D was not as exciting or I would have given it a 5!
1423113497|5.0|even as i am a 26 year old married mother of a 5 year old, I love this series. This is definitely one that is not just for teens and pre-teens.
B00275EGWY|5.0|This movie shows what the troops are encountering each and everyday while serving our country and trying to protect the unfortunate that need our help.  It is a really difficult movie to watch if you have a loved one in harms way.  This movie gives you the true insight into Post Traumatic Stress Syndrome (PTSD).  Many soldiers from Vietnam were never given the support or medical attention that is being realized by officials now.  Many Vietnam vets and other war vets have real problems, financial, divorce, alcoholism, and homelessness that were never understood.  Maybe more will be done to understand this medical condition and people will not judge people suffering from its effects and help them instead.
B00002SWEM|5.0|I showed this to my family, which has zero experience about Cuba, and they absolutely loved it.  It gave them a nice perspective on Cuban life, music, and the people living there.  For those unfamiliar with Cuba, this film will give them a brief glimpse into life on the island so close to the United States, but yet so isolated from the US.  I had just returned from a visit to the island, so I was excited to see famous landmarks that I had visited while there.<br /><br />The filmmaker (Wim Wenders) wisely stays away from mixing politics into the film aside from presenting photographs of Fidel Castro during the Revolution, but does not bring up opinions or an agenda to the film.  The famous image of Che is only presented as a painting on the walls of Havana, but he is neither glorified nor vilified.<br /><br />I haven't even spoke of the music yet.  Artists such as Compay Segundo, Eliades Ochoa, Omara Portuondo and many others grace this film with their beautiful voices and their amazing talents.  Each of the 10 or so artists has a brief moment to present their work and explain a little of their life, while Wim Wenders masterly mixes their solo work into the concert in Amsterdam and the Buena Vista Social Club performance at Carnegie Hall.  Beautiful documentary about a beautiful subject.
0060899190|5.0|I absolutely adored this book! I laughed, I cried, it became a part of me. I recommend this and other Frank Warren books to anyone that needs a small dose of humility.
B0019N8P2W|5.0|Finally, Paramount has a date for the complete series plus both movies.  May 11th, 2010 I have been waiting for years for this great show to get put on dvd, I'm glad someone over at Paramount finally listened to the fans.  I will buy this the first day of release.
0071636080|4.0|I just watched the product launch of Apple's newest product, the IPad.  Classic Steve Jobs, according to Carmine Gallo in this book. Even though Gallo thinks Steve Jobs is a brilliant presenter (he is not, although he has gotten better over the years), Gallo does a fine job melding the Apple product launch lore in with some presentation pointers (pun intended). If you are a MAC devotee, then you'll love the behind-the-scenes tidbits Gallo shares. As a new MAC user, I found the adoration and anecdotes bordering on the tedious about halfway through the book.<br /><br />Even if you have never owned an Apple product before, the presentation pointers are invaluable.  So here is the good news for all corporate presenters.  You, too, can present like Jobs if you follow a few basic tenants, which are outlined in the book. After all, if Jobs can give a brilliant prsentation, so you you!
B0031RAOVY|5.0|As a grown man not prone to crying, by the end of this film I was a blubbering mess, and I've probably not shed a tear in more than ten years. Anyone who loves dogs, I imagine, will be in the same state after witnessing the amazing loyalty displayed by one selfless canine.    I'd actually heard the story many times.  A loyal dog returns to train station to meet his master even after he dies. But the film really brings the point home following the entire life span of the dog.  But what I feel makes this film stand out is how it shows the perspective of the dog, a great reminder that \\"Hachi\\" is the protagonist in the film and giving insight into the emotions he felt.  Additionally, the dog was portrayed as a dog, not a human character in a dog suit capable of impossible feats and acts, which for me, made the story so much more enjoyable and made the dog so much more believable.    Please disregard the one-star rating given by the Akita breeder in Nevada who didn't really rate the film so much as criticize peoples tendency to purchase dogs because of movie influences. It should also be noted that the Japanese Akita as a breed would have most likely disappeared had it not been for the original Hachi's popularity in Japan during the 1930's when the story was popularized by local newspapers of the time.    I would rate this as probably the best dog movie ever to come out of Hollywood.  If you've made it so far as to read reviews, you really should just buy it. I can't imagine any dog lover being disappointed in this magnificent film.
0006531407|5.0|I bought this for my 11 year old son along with other outdoor, adventure books.  This is his favorite.  Not sure I fully understand, but he has a bucket of water and a fish-catching contraption that he made based on this book. We need to get him to a river to try it out.  Great book!
0634022296|5.0|This is a wonderful collection for any person who loves the Beatles.  The book is esy to use for anyone wanting to enjoy the best music of the last 40 years up to the present.
0060825456|5.0|This graphic novel comes into its own using the now famous story of Coraline, a girl who feels frustrated with her parents only to find another set just like them behind a bricked up door.  It seems that these are the dream parents she's been waiting for but somehow evil lurks underneath.  The graphic novel doesn't have pictures like the animated movie but it doesn't matter, the pictures are quite effective and the reader soon doesn't care if the illustrations are similar or not.  In fact the pictures are creepier in this book.  The graphic novel is quite effective and absorbing.  I'm planning to use it as a reading in my middle school classroom.
0425221806|5.0|The Watchers was the very first Dean Koontz book I ever read. I enjoyed this book emensley! Because of this book, I have gone on to become a very big Koontz fan.  Even though it has been years since I have read this book, I have nothing but wonderful memories of it. As with many of Dean Koontz books, it starts off a little slow, but picks up and is a fantastic story! I love it! As a mater of fact I think it is time to read it again!
B002OLTJRI|5.0|This album has a lovely array of different versions of the old favorites including a beautiful and raw version of 'She says she has no time'. It also has some of the earliest Keane songs which many of us have never heard, from when Dominic was still with the group. A rare lead vocal from Tim and some hauntingly sad songs pull you in deeper with every listen.
1932100385|5.0|This is an excellent book and would recommend it to everyone that is interested in maintaining a healthy body.
B002P4VUMQ|5.0|The band is TIGHT!  Jason is different. His music could be described as a combination of \\"jazz\\", \\"Reggae\\", \\"Blues\\", \\"Ballads\\" (LOL, Quote \\"This next one is a love song! Surprise surprisssse, I got nothin but love songs\\"! ...  \\"Suedo Rap\\" ... Truth is, a friend of mine, a 70s & 80s rock & roller blew me away when he said \\"Ya Know? I'd pay a hundered bucks to see this concert live\\"! ... Kinda sums up Jason. Different for sure but mostly entertaining & thought provoking. I love this CD.
1569242739|5.0|I've had this book for a few months now and it is absolutely amazing. I am not vegan, but I am vegetarian (and never use egg in any of my cooking). I've made several recipes from this book and all have gotten rave reviews from my carnivore friends. In fact, the tiramisu cupcake recipe recently won a bake-off.     If you have any interest in making cupcakes from scratch, this is a great book. Occasionally some of the recipes call for unusual ingredients (most of which can be found at Whole Foods), but there are plenty of recipes that involve products you can find at your local grocery store.    Really, its an excellent buy, especially if you love cupcakes!
B001PCNZ6S|5.0|Yes vinyl is better sound quality than any other medium other than live, and the extra ass pain is worth it!  Getting this stuff on Amazon lacks the feeling of adventure of going to your local record store (if you have one) but generally the selection here is WAY better.   Go Amazon!
B002PMV9K6|5.0|great movie not as good as the book but still good. some of the parts r just like id imagined them in the book....ordering it was easy and i got the shipment faster then i thought i think 2 days early love shoping on here

B00006CXSS|5.0|My husband has wanted this DVD set for a very long time, so for his birthday I decided to get it for him.  I'm not usually a war movie person but when he cracked it open to start watching it on his Birthday I started watching with him. I have to say they did an awesome job in putting the episodes together.  I love how they talk to the actual Veterans before each episodes begin.  We are both loving this DVD set -- Very well done!
B002SJIO5E|1.0|One critic put it this way:    \\"I have never wanted to walk out of a movie so bad in my entire life.... do not ever go see district nine... id rather have a root canal... several of them...without the anesthesia... seriously... this is torture...shoot me.\\"    Could not have said it better. District 9 is beyond bad. It is downright offensive to anybody with an IQ over 65.     This is what other viewers said after seeing this movie:    \\" This is the worst ever, and there is not even a close second. How is it even possible that this movie made it to DVD, let alone movie theaters?     . . . And for the punch line? It just got nominated for an Academy Award for--get this--Best Picture.\\"      \\"One of the worst movies I've ever actually sat through from start to finish. I hated all of the characters in the movie and wanted all of them to die. I've enjoyed those cheesy made for tv movies on SyFy channel a lot more than this piece of garbage. A total waste of my money and time.\\"    \\" WORST movie i think i have ever seen. someone that could possibly even like this movie is a freak beyond belief. if you want to see people being blown up... go see this movie, youll have a blast. if you want to here people swearing like hell in south african accents be my guest. this is the most bizzare, and disgusting film i have ever in my entire life seen.\\"    \\"by far one of the absolute worst movies ever made the main actor was an annoying incompetent moron/geek i hated every single minute of this waste of time film \\"    \\"District 9 is the worst piece of crap ever made! If I could sue Peter Jackson and the makers of this film I would. If I was offered a million dollars cash in a briefcase to watch this movie again I would open the briefcase, barf on the cash and politely pass! In no way is this clever film-making! This was simply a scam to rip off the general public! BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO  This movie down right sucks! I still feel I am being way too nice!\\"    \\" have just finished watching District 9 on DVD and I agree with the majority. It has to be one of the worst pieces of \\"film making\\" I have ever seen. The plot was a ridiculous. I know it had a moral story to tell with regards to modern discrimination, but it was done in a very silly way. What angered me the most was that at no time was it suggested in the film trailers that it was a quasi documentary. Shame on the studio for such deception! \\"    Big thumbs down for the arogant pricks posing or calling themselves movie critics who dared to recommend this abomination.
B002S5N04I|1.0|I bought this as a gift for my neice...however, when it arrived I noticed that it was an LP, not a CD. Did I mistakenly order a record rather than a compact disc?  I don't know, but that's what came, and now I can't return it because it was opened. Why do they even make LP's anymore?  I don't know anyone that even has a record player anymore, let alone uses it. I'll chalk this up to lesson learned...make absolutely certain that you choose the correct format you'd like your soundtrack to come in!
0736063684|5.0|I bought this for a class but I even use it for my own workouts for a little change in my routine because it has so many different exercises.
0316044938|4.0|I was really suprised at how much I liked this book.  I was hesitant at first to read it because I was afraid it would bore me, but after some persuasion from my best friend, and seeing it on sale for $6, I gave in.  The story started out intense on the first page, so I was pretty drawn in.  Other than a few boring pages here and there, this story was very emotional and beautifully written, I definitely recommend it.  Especially if you have or are planning to see the movie, you should read the book because the movie leaves out a HUGE part of the story!! (:
B00288KNL8|5.0|This was a Christmas gift for my daughter. Recieved it in perfect condition and exactly when it was stated it would be here.
B0026P3G12|5.0|The CD was so beautiful that I had to order another one for my sister. Well worth your money. I will certainly keep my eye open for more of Susan Boyle !!!
B0036B8MXC|1.0|I admit I only made it thru the first 20 minutes of this disaster! It is really awful - fake backdrops (obvious), horrible stilted acting, the language is ridiculous and almost comical, blood flying around in slow motion, etc.  Apparently Starz was attempting to make another \\"Rome\\" and it is a miserable failure.  Don't waste your $$ and time.  How anybody with half of a brain can give this mess 5 stars is beyond me.
B001GKJ2FW|4.0|This is a 5-star movie on a 3 star quality blu-ray.  There are spots where the visual actions blurs across the screen.  I have seen this on many of my blu-rays but it seems the newer ones are improving.
B00177Y9ZC|4.0|Great story, good acting, good overall plot and filming. I liked this being a different take on time travel than redoing mistakes of our past and instead focused on what the lifestyle could be like with those time travel attributes. It's also a great family movie since it's clear of violence, obsentities, and nudity. Lawrence Fishburne is the bad guy who portrays his role very well. However, I had trouble believing there is a team of people who just want to remove these time travelers because \\"only God should be able to do that.\\" Aside from that one aspect, it's a thoroughly enjoyable movie. I got it for under $10 and it was well worth that and more in my opinion.
B0026P3G12|5.0|I love this CD.  I listen to it when I need a pickmeup and encouragement to strive for the dream!
B00000AFWZ|5.0|(Nuggets = precious metal)I agree...less common but valuable. This collection of various artists is a must have.

B002VPE1AW|5.0|One early Friday at the Macon theater in theater 7 at 7:oo me and my friend Garrett waited impatiently  to see the new movie of Avatar. When we got in our 6th row seats I spilt my 4.00 popcorn , but not having the popcorn did not stop us from loving the terrific movie of Avatar.          The movie was unbelievable good. Now it is one of my all time favorites, because it is very heart warming. It is about these people that turn there selves into Avatars , and they try to relegate to them then they betray them and destroy there world to use it for an extra space for there technology  stuff. One of the people that turn into Avatars falls in love with another Avatar. He tries to save them from the people that are trying to take over \\" his side.\\"
B0007TKNCY|5.0|I was a little bit sketchy buying this product because I didn't know how good the quality would end up being.  However... the product is great! Amazing clarity in picture and audio! I love this movie!!

B00127RAJY|4.0|I was recommended this video by one of my girlfriends and was a little skeptical at first but thought I would give it a try.  I am not a huge work out person and had not worked out in a long long time prior to trying this video, so I was of course a little bit nervous. But after doing just the first week, I was hooked.  It is an amazing workout and is only 20 minutes a day which is perfect for my lifestyle! It has definitely made me want to work out more and has encouraged me to want to get healthier!
B0006J28L4|5.0|As a baby boomer growing up in the South during the 60's, I was always told that Malcom X was the violent of the leaders of the struggle of African Americans, in contrast to Martin Luther King.  After watching this magnificent film, and reading THE AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF MALCOM X by Alex Haley,  I have to say that my perspective of Malcom X has been drastically altered.  He was a visionary and Spike Lee's movie portrays him as such.  Denzel Washington's performance is absolutely riveting.  The screenplay is 98% accurate, and I should say all of the supporting actors are just fantastic. We see the metamorphasis of a human being, ready to die if neccessary for the cause for justice and freedom.  A Must See For All People Around The World!

B002ELM5HY|4.0|I have been a Dire Straits fan from the beginning in 1979, and it continued into Mark Knopfler's solo work. I used to make comparisons with Mark's solo efforts versus the Dire Straits efforts. But I stopped doing that when \\"Kill To Get Crimson\\" came out. I now make comparisons from Mark's early efforts to his work now. I can understand his comments that \\"as I get older , I get more grouchy\\". But he still makes sweet music. And that includes \\"Get Lucky\\". He continues to put out solid material, and \\"You Can't Beat the House\\" and \\"Cleaning My Gun\\" are clear examples of songs the average listener will pass by. Keep up the great work, Mark. You created another wonderful product I will listen to many times over.
0205632645|5.0|Perfect.  Fabulous.  A classic.  A necessary tool for anyone who reads, writes or gives a damn about style.
B001DJ7PQ4|5.0|Received in good time, haven't opened it yet but looks in good condition in the wrapper.  Thanks.
B002ZE85YW|4.0|Actually, I've never watched the movie - but my oldest son had it on his wish list for Christmas. The ONLY place I found it (Director's Cut, Digital Copy) was on Amazon.
B001GCUNW6|5.0|My kid loves the Ice Age movies.  I bought them all for him and not until I sat down with him did I understand why he enjoys them so much.  It takes an intelligent script-writer and director to be able to produce a movie that is enjoyable for kids and adults alike, while staying away from sexual innuendo and inappropriate humor.  I think all 3 of the Ice Age movies are very well written, especially this last one: Dawn of the Dinosaurs.  The quality is amazing on Blu-ray.  I'm glad I have this film as part of my collection.
B00192IV0O|4.0|I like a lot of the songs on here, but bought it as a gift for my child and was disappointed to hear curse words. Not something I want him to sing.
032147404X|1.0|I find it hard to believe that I'm writing this, but I simply must save unsuspecting readers from frustration I experienced. I'm amateur photographer and always willing to learn something new, so I was lured to this book by positive reviews in my quest for knowledge and better pictures. I failed to heed the warnings in the negative reviews (which I normally do) and now I'm terribly regretting this because every bit of critique appears to be true.  I usually read introductions and acknowledgements, so this book immediately alienated me with author's ill-conceived sense of humor. The funny part though is that author realizes (admits it in the book) that his humor attempts are \\"lame\\" at best but still insist of occupying at least 5% of the book with this trash. What also contributes to the injury is the author's writing style and \\"pro\\" reference in each paragraph. Basically each tip is aimed not at learning something new, but rather at \\"looking like a pro\\". I find it ridiculous, but it surely attracts all those photo-wannabes that give this book positive reviews.  Now let's look at the content. Each page consists of paragraph(s) of text with some \\"useful\\" tip and a picture to illustrate the tip. Do not assume that pictures illustrate a technique, and you could learn anything from them. Most of the time pictures are pointless and/or of questionable artistic value. You will see plenty pictures of cameras, camera menus, camera controls, authors family and friends and even mindless clipart in cases where author was too lazy to actually come up with the photo. Bogus pictures occupy exactly half of each page, so you could surely cut the book in half and convert it to nice pocket format without losing anything.  The quality of tips in the book is of dubious nature. I would say that about half of them is just a common sense. Trust me, you do not need a book to figure out that camera has to be steady to make sharp pictures or that by throwing away you picture CDs you are risking that somebody might gain access to your work. It also unlikely that you bought this book to be reminded that your work has to be backed up (several \\"tips\\" devoted to that).  Now the tiny part of the book that actually contains some useful information is misdirected. For people that spend some time shooting (i'm not even talking about ubiquitous \\"pros\\" here) all the \\"tips\\" are self-evident and are on borderline with common sense. Many of them are blatantly oversimplified of just plain incorrect. For beginners those tips do not make much sense because they lack the basics which are not covered by this book.  In general this book is the worst disappointment I ever had (in books at least :). Spend your time and money elsewhere. There are plenty of good books for beginners and advanced photographers out there and this is just happens not to be one of them. If you really want to improve your pictures better read [[ASIN:0817463003 Understanding Exposure: How to Shoot Great Photographs with a Film or Digital Camera (Updated Edition)]] or [[ASIN:0240808193 Light: Science and Magic: An Introduction to Photographic Lighting]]. The latter, especially, going to make you a better photographer, guaranteed.
0375758992|4.0|The most enjoyable autobiographies are those written in a decent style by non-celebrities, and which illuminate realms of human experience strange to the reader.  This is a very nice example.  You will want to read it.
1932100660|5.0|I have spent the past seven years reading every nutrition-based book I could get my hands on and this is by far one of the top three most informative, life-changing books I've read to date.  I only wish I would have known this information before I watched my sister die a brutal death from a Diabetes-related ER visit.  Why this book is not part of every medical and nutrition-based degree program is beyond me.  It is clear we need to radically overhaul our American healthcare and medical system for many of the reasons discussed in this book.  Not only should you buy the book, but you should have your loved ones read it as well.

B0000AGQ6P|5.0|All star cast giving fantasy performances.  Clever update of an old classic which has become somewhat of a cult classic. As enjoyable for adults as it is for kids. Received poor reviews from professional critics when it first came out which seems to be what's required to give a movie lasting value in the eyes of the general public.
B002WY65VU|4.0|This movie was funny and clever and gripping from its opening moments.  Very well cast and directed, with a cameo towards the end that by itself is worth the price of rental.      I was pleasantly surprised,to say the least.  Who knew there could be yet another fresh take on this overdone genre?  A thrill ride from start to finish. Double tap!    And remember: some rules are made to be broken.
B000002KAT|5.0|Every time I listen to this album I am transported to another place. Or time. Or mindset. It's truly psychedelic, even though it really doesn't belong in the category of psychedelic rock. Something about it grabs you right in the heart and will not let go. It sticks with you, and the more you listen to it the more you understand. But you never have it solved. It's best to approach this album with a free afternoon because if you really, truly let it speak to you it will leave you in tears. An absolute must for anyone who wants to really know Van Morrison.
B0029LHW68|5.0|There is so much more different with this album that i was suprized, but it was a great move. i fell in love with a beautiful lie and now i am in love with both lie and this is war. EPIC
B002VPE1B6|3.0|And the really interesting thing about Avatar is that it's cut and paste movie making. I spotted core themes to the following films: Dances with Wolves, Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter (all of them), Gone With The Wind, Wizard of Oz, Braveheart, 2001, Star Wars, Apocalypse Now and Kundun. The only one Cameron left out was ET. Spielberg should feel slighted. Not sure if you were ever a fan, but the sets looked like they were conceived by Roger Dean who did all the YES album covers. And the music sounds like orchestral versions of Yes tunes. Jon Anderson should sue.    The technology is impressive, but I enjoyed Bono in 3D more. He looked like Darby O'Gill and the little People dancing on my knees. I kept swatting 3d bugs away at Avatar. If I wanted that, I'd go to New Jersey.
0375842209|5.0|I've never read a book that was laid out like this was..it was a unique experience. There is regular narrating by \\"Death\\", and he does a very effective job of being completely creepy and totally convincing.  The time period is the emerging of Hitler's Nazi Germany, 1939.  The story begins with our protagonist, 9 year old Leisel, a poor German girl, being taken to live with foster parents because her mother is unable to care for her any longer. What follows is the story of love and devastation in the life of this captivating little soul Leisel, her foster family, a Jew that they hide in their basement, and the various townsfolk.  A beautiful and important story heart-wrenchingly told.  I was blown away by the way the author was able to string together ordinary words to form such powerful and frightening images.  Beautiful!
B002BSHWUU|5.0|I bought this for my 14 year old daughter,  I have never seen her so excited she was speechless on Christmas morning!  All Ive heard since are the Beatles!!  I would recommend this set to any Beatle lover...well worth the money.  Also, much cheaper on Amazon than on the Beatle store site!  This is always a plus.
B001JNNDBA|5.0|I thought that maybe something was wrong with it because it was Blue Ray and cheaper than the non-blue ray but it was even better. Loved it!
B000VWYNOG|5.0|Nothing special to say about this album except if you want good compilation of Van Morrison's great hits then this is a great choice.

B0025KVLS8|1.0|I played this disc factory new on a brand new CD player, and it would not play without skips and stops and starts on each song.  I returned the disc thinking it was defective, and the replacement copy did the same thing.  Since the earlier release of this CD in the jewel case plays fine, it has to be something about this remastered version that my player doesn't like.  If I were you, I'd try one out before you buy the whole collection in remastered form.
1423113497|5.0|I bought the 5 book series as a birthday gift for my 10 year old sone. His birthday is in January and I was hoping he'd have most of them read by the release of the movie mid-February. He loves them so much, that he's actually going to have all 5 books (and the guide book) read in 1 month for the release of the movie. He loves to read but I've never seen him read 100 pages in a sitting.
B002VECM4A|3.0|*** This review may contain spoilers ***<br /><br />For most viewers who hated 'Precious', one of the primary objections was the film tended to reinforce stereotypes of African-Americans. If taken literally (as some have done), one can conclude that the negative, 'acting-out' behavior in lower class black neighborhoods is typical of almost ALL black people in such environments. If this was so, why would Oprah Winfrey and Tyler Perry promote such a film? The answer is that the film is not intended to represent the complex reality of life in the inner city. Rather, it is an intentional exaggeration for dramatic effect.<br /><br />Since the 19th century, melodrama has been the most commercially successful of all types of drama (think of films such as 'Gone With the Wind' or 'Titanic'). Basic Melodrama is tragedy reduced to a more simplistic level which the masses can more easily understand. Characters in melodrama are pretty much one-dimensional, with clearly defined heroes (or heroines) and villains. The audience of course identifies with the hero but it is the villain that they're truly interested in. A successful melodrama always features a maniacal and better yet, diabolical, villain.<br /><br />'Precious' wins points in serving up its own entry in the diabolical villain category, Mary, the mother from hell, played by Mo'Nique. When she's alone with Precious, she treats her own daughter as if she's her personal slave: there are physical beatings and constant psychological humiliation. Worse, she stands by as she allows Precious's father (her boyfriend) to rape and later impregnate her daughter twice. It's hinted that Precious's first daughter ends up with Down's Syndrome due to a beating received by the mother from hell while Precious is pregnant. Mary callously refers to the first child as \\"Mongo\\" (for 'Mongoloid') and sends her off to be raised by her own mother since she refuses to help raise the child herself. Mary is also a classic manipulator--when a social worker comes by to check on the family, she has her own mother bring over the mentally challenged child and pretend that she's been caring for the child all along (thus allowing herself to continue to receive public assistance benefits). During the film's climax, she begs Precious' social worker (well-played by a low-key Mariah Carey) to have Precious and her new child come back to her. Her pleas fall on deaf ears after she continues to blame Precious for the problems in the family (in Mary's warped mind, she's the victim since Precious 'stole' her boyfriend away from her after she did nothing to stop him from raping her).<br /><br />The joys of developing a well-thought out and clever villain, are usually tempered by a contrasting stock and predictable victim. There isn't much new under the sun when it comes to Precious, the overweight black girl who suffers from extreme low self-esteem. Once authorities at her regular school discover that Precious is once again pregnant, she's sent to an 'alternative school' for girls with behavior problems. There it's discovered that she's reading on the second grade level and gradually through the intervention of a tough but caring teacher, she eventually overcomes her illiteracy and is reading at the 7th and 8th grade levels by the end of the film. While the contrasting scenes with her mother are always fraught with dramatic tension, the energy is not as intense in all the 'classroom scenes' which feature characters which we've seen in many other countless movies before, about acting out adolescent girls.<br /><br />In addition to all the abuse she suffers at home as well as the taunting by other children and teenagers in the neighborhood, Precious must overcome one last overwhelming obstacle--the fact that she's been diagnosed as being HIV Positive. But even that won't stop the film's scenarist and producers from having Precious fade into the sunset with her head held high. Remember, this is a melodrama, and in melodrama you never tarnish your protagonist (the victim!). Sure, there are a few hints that Precious has her faults (she doesn't like the idea of working for her public assistance benefits for example) but it might have been a much more interesting film had the screenwriters grafted a few more ugly traits from the mother onto Precious' personality. Instead, despite all the low self-esteem, the deck is stacked so that Precious comes off almost like a saint.<br /><br />Precious is by no means a boring film. It moves along and has a series of neat, 'fantasy' sequences, highlighting Precious's rich fantasy life. As stated above, Precious is successful when it focuses on the very strong character of the villainous mother. Otherwise, the story of the heroine, who must rise from extreme adversity, is a story that we've seen many, many times before. For those who like their stories simple where the moral conflict is clear cut, Precious is for you. For those who want something a little more complex, Precious might just not be satisfying enough.!).

B000UOGHKS|5.0|It was my first purchase at AMAZON.COM. The shipping details stated that it would get to my house in 2 weeks since I chose the standard shipping, but I got this and the other one I ordered (True Blue) from the same vendor in less than 5 days! That is just amazing! And the product itself was great, just if I had picked it up from the store. Great deal: amazing price and great service!
B002KREVCO|5.0|I bought this for my husband as a holiday gift and we BOTH ended up loving it!  You can also buy this in  larger 'backtrack' pack that includes a bunch of other fan stuff but this appears to be the best part of that pack INMO.  Great live footage of AC/DC in their younger days with Bon Scott plus footage of their most recent tour.  Enjoy!
B002PMV9FG|4.0|I am a real Harry Potter fan. I have read all of the books and seen all of the movies. Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince was really good but I liked the first 2 Harry Potter movies that were directed by Chris Columbus better than the last few movies. I think the later movies have been getting a little too dark for my taste. This last one was true to the story but the director has left out all of the things that make Harry Potter books and movies fun. No paintings with moving images, no fantastic beasts, we hardly saw Hagrid, and the beauty of the countryside was totally left out in this movie. The director is filming everything darkly, no beauty at all. I think showing the fun side of things makes the bad things that happen stand out even more, so when you take away the good things everything is just a shade of grey.  Don't get me wrong... I liked the movie but I'll bet if Chris Columbus had directed it... I would have loved it.
0307266303|5.0|You do NOT have to be a runner to be captivated by this book.  It's a true adventure story and a real page-turner full of fascinating people and ideas.  Every ten pages or so you'll want to tell someone \\"Listen to this...\\".

B0030U1U6A|5.0|Gentle Giant survived losing a key member (Phil Shulman the oldest of the Shulman brothers in the band) after \\"Octopus\\" and went on to pull together making one of their most challenging sounding albums to date. \\"In A Glass House\\"demonstrated that the band could rise from the ashes and floursih.<br /><br />First up--some comparisons. This version on Alcuard sounds less harsh than either the first Alucard and the DRT. The 2005 DRT actually sounded harsher to my ears (your mileage may vary on this particular point)than the 2002 edition. Detail was better for both of those editions than previous ones as well as clarity which you can chalk up to the master tapes or digital copies being used for both of these. There is limiting applied as well as some denoising (at the request of the band) but it isn't as obtrusive as I thought it would be. The best comparison I can think of is that this shares a lot of assets and drawbacks as The Beatles remasters.<br /><br />Band bassist Ray Shulman and mastering engineer Fred Kervorkian went back to the original 1/4 master tapes to assemble this edition. Be aware that while this sounds better than either of those previous editions with a smoother sound (at least to my ears), some selective band compression was applied. I should note that it was fairly tastefully done and this doesn't have the overwhelming bad qualities of most modern remasters. The reason that Kervorkian used the selective band compression was to give the album a slightly more \\"modern\\" sound and he does succeed at doing this without betraying the overall sonic quality of the album. Dynamic range is comparable to the 2002 edition of this album.<br /><br />There are a few drawbacks. The 2002 had two live bonus tracks and while they weren't essential to enjoy the album for those who didn't see the band in their prime these two tracks gave a nice hint as to how they sounded. The two live tracks (which are listed here as being part of this remaster at Amazon.com) are NOT part of the Alucard edition. The single bonus live track which was carried over from the 2002 edition for the DRT is NOT included here either.<br /><br />You get the original album, the lyrics and the album graphics reproduced for this edition. That's it. The 3D style cover is not faithfully reproduced here if that matters to you.<br /><br />This IS one of Gentle Giant's finest most challenging and complex albums yet it remains melodic and creative. The upside to this remaster is that the 1/4 master tapes were used to create this and that it sounds pretty good overall balancing the sound of the orignal album and a more \\"modern\\" sound.<br /><br />The drawbacks are that we don't have the two bonus tracks. Detail and clarity are better here (to my ears) than some previous editions and because of the use of selective band compression as well as some of the e.q. choices, there some additional details buried in the mix that are evident on this edition.<br /><br />Recommended although your mileage may vary.n.

B001AIRUP4|4.0|I bought this BD for my sister. She loves the movie and all of the characters. The blu-ray looks even better then the DVD, the colors are more vibrant and the depth of the picture comes across in great detail in your HD TV
B000HC2LI0|4.0|I purchased this collection as a birthday gift for my boyfriend.  He was a big fan of the show when it was on the air.  I collection came in a beautiful box, a introduction from the producer and the pilot script for the show.  I have to say that I fell in love with the series along with him after watching a few episodes.  This was a great collaboration of actors, the characters were funny and dramatic.  I highly recommend this collection for the quality you receive in the DVDs along with the fact that this was and will always be an amazing show.
031606792X|5.0|After reading all the books in the Twilight saga I can say that Breaking Dawn is my favorite. While I enjoyed the creativity of Twilight the level of writing was not good enough yet. By the time you get to Breaking Dawn you can see a great deal of improvement in Stephanie Meyer's writing. I love that she foccused on the characters more than some ridiculous conflict or needless bloodbath. I think the connections between characters and discovering the everyday interactions between a cult of Vampires is far more interesting. Since I enjoyed the last book so much I jumped right on her new book The Host. This book is similar to Breaking Dawn in the Scifi/love storyline and she really centers the story around her characters. I hope everyone reads these reviews with a grain of salt and reads a book to discover for yourself what you like and not what someone else doesn't like.
0425221806|5.0|This was the first book by Koontz that I read. It was awesome! I found myself turning pages faster and faster. It was a great read! I love Koontz's style and word usage. This is not a book for a person with a weak stomach or for someone that gets nightmares easily.
B0009W5K0Y|2.0|Serviceable debut and example of the watered down emo-pop punk showered upon the masses by A&R as the new alternative sound.  To their credit, they've refined their sound over time, with Brand New Eyes their best yet, and the attention less just the hype about Hayley Williams, and more about the overall band.  Much better outlook, than say, Fall out Boy, who have hit a bit of creative rut.
0060751967|5.0|I have read the entire Love at Stake series and I LOVE them. I can not wait till the next one comes out. I love the characters and the emotions of the books. I found it very easy to get into and relate to the characters. I recommend this series to anyone who has an open mind and is into vamp romance with some mystery added.
0552552127|2.0|I thought these books were interesting because they are a decent stab at the fantasy genre in the mold of dark elf and LOTR type story telling.  All in all the books aren't bad and are entertaining but they get a little tiring to read after a while.  The main characters Eragon and The leader of the Varden obsessively contemplate morality questions through out the books but in Book 3 it really dominates the landscape.  Almost every paragraph in this book is dialog about someone explaining their decision or speaking to someone about how they didn't mean to offend or hurt their feelings.  There is just entirely too much focus about people trying to maintain their status as a paragon of virtue among their fellow adventurers.  The books really do a good job of making magic, telepathy, and mythical beasts interesting but sometimes I just want to throw the book across the room and say grow up and get on with it.  The books setting is rather heavy, these people are at war, they have lived a lifestyle of almost poverty as a direct result of a ruthless and tyrant king who kills without second thought or remorse yet the theme of the book dedicates chapter after chapter to discussion about weather or not a single prisoner of war should be executed, or should a hero have followed orders or followed their heart.  Not a book to avoid but I think one should realize that the book is written at a lower reading level.  The characters are not deep although they try very hard to be.
B002BSHWUU|5.0|I owned every Beatles album on vinyl.  I never knew what I was missing in terms of tone and quality until I heard these remastered CDs.  I can't stop listening to this set!  It's never out of my CD player - whether @ home, in the car or at the office.  This set is worth every penny.
0679735259|5.0|Reading reviews can teach you alot about people.  In my younger days I might have been outraged at the simpletons that didn't appreciate this work of art, but I realize now people with taste can have wildly divergent opinions,...although I have slightly less regard for the opinions of those who gave this book one star.  Contrary to such adjectives as snarky and ego-driven being used to describe this book, I consider it full of humanity and wisdom.  Maybe that's  a result of things being recorded truthfully.  Sure, there's a hazy aura that envelopes the book, but from all accounts I've read, the war had a dreamlike quality.  People complain about it's narrative style, but if read slowly and relished, all those so-called run on sentences result in nuanced and layered observations that do justice to the complexities of war and the men who wage it.  It is one of my favorite books ever.

1577311523|5.0|This book will challenge your 'thinking' and provide you with all the insight into enlightenment I think you will ever need. Although enlightenment seems like something unattainable, it's really quite simple after you read the book.  It also explains Jesus's teachings in a way that shows their relationship to the Buddha's teachings- without the pressure and misconception of 'God', sin, or giving everything up to be 'good', expressing simple truths.    Enlightenment is the end of suffering, and you can choose not to suffer. But your mind wants you to believe that problems exist, because they define yourself. It sometimes takes you over when you try to end suffering.  Despite the concept being relatively simple, you will need to know a few ways to think. And the book provides this.

B002VECM4A|5.0|I've been trying to see all of the movies that feature large in the awards season and frankly had been putting this one off.  By and large I've not been impressed by the films that have received many of the nominations this year.  Many of them are amazingly bland and disappointing.  PRECIOUS is a delightful exception.  Not that it is a delightful film.  It is often hard to watch, but nonetheless moving and very powerful.  The story of a morbidly obese, illiterate sixteen-year-old who is pregnant with her second child (both by her father) and physically abused by her hopelessly inept mother (played brilliantly by Mo'Nique), this should have been the bummer film to end all bummer films.  But you really come to love Clarice (Precious).  Despite things getting worse and worse for her, you feel a tremendous sense of triumph for her when she manages to pull her reading level up from a second grade to a seventh grade level.  And despite the horrid abuse that she has suffered, she is determined to be a better mother to her two children than either her mother or father were to her.<br /><br />And what can you say about Gabourey Sidibe?  This is one of the great debut performances ever by an actress.  Ironically, in the depths of her horrible life Precious daydreams of being loved and finding improbable success as a celebrity, including a movie star.  Now, I'm sure Gabourey Sidibe has not had a bad life, but who in the world would fantasize about getting an Oscar nomination for her first screen role?  But that is precisely what she has achieved.  And it is a nomination that she richly deserved, just as Mo'Nique deserved her nomination as best supporting actress.  Mariah Carey also does a very credible job in a small but important supporting role.<br /><br />The movie is also a terrible indictment of American society.  On the one hand we are in the gripes of a national fever of hatred towards government, the only entity in most countries that does much to help salvage the lives of others.  On the other hand, we are in the grips of a national passion for self-interested greed, with a vast right wing that has subtly absorbed libertarian notions (deriving not only from Ayn Rand, but especially from her) that compassion is a vice and blind self-interest a virtue.  More than any other developed nation and despite almost inconceivable national wealth, millions of Americans suffer the fate of children like Precious.  I personally consider those who possess the kind of self-interest advocated by Rand and many conservatives to be nothing short of monstrous, to be aberrations of nature, moral deformities.  One of my closest friends is a social worker and says that Precious's story is far from unique, but in fact a commonplace.  Why we in America, the richest country in the world, won't do anything to help all Americans is a mystery to me.<br /><br />This ought to be a must-see movie for everyone.  It is an extremely well-acted, deeply moving, and well-directed film that anyone who loves movies will enjoy.On the other hand, we are in the grips of a national passion for self-interested greed, with a vast right wing that has subtly absorbed libertarian notions (deriving not only from Ayn Rand, but especially from her) that compassion is a vice and blind self-interest a virtue.

B0030BYWKK|5.0|Listening to \\"The Courage of Others\\" the first time, I actually got just a little bit weepy about midway through. Granted, I was on my way to my parents' 60th anniversary dinner and may have already been in a weepy mood. But, still--this is one gorgeous album that connected with me on an emotional level.    I'm a fan of late '60s British folk rock, and this reminds me very much of Fairport Convention's \\"Unhalfbricking\\" and \\"What We Did on Our Holidays.\\"    If I'd never heard of Midake and someone gave me a copy of the new album and said Joe Boyd had produced it in 1968, I'd probably believe them. Sandy Denny could do a killer cover of the the first track, \\"Acts of Man.\\" If, you know, she weren't dead.    I realize many are complaining it's too \\"samey\\" sounding, a criticism I understand but don't agree with. To me, the album ebbs and flows in a very organic way, like it's one long extended piece. Yeah, I get why some would find that frustrating, but I never find \\"Courage\\" boring. I've listened to the whole thing about five times so far, and I'm totally knocked out by it.
0316017922|3.0|As someone who has been fortunately (more about that in a moment) successful in business I have hired and observed \\"successful\\" people. But that begs the question because little is said in this book about how it defines success. It seems to assume that means being at the forefront of your chosen endeavor. That does not translate automatically to success in life. The cases of self-destructive or otherwise unhappy highly \\"successful\\" people are too numerous.    In my experience people who possess so-called street smarts are more likely to rise to the top, regardless of background, intelligence or accomplishment. Whether ingrained or taught experimentally people who know how to \\"play the game\\" are far more likely to succeed in most endeavors, given even a modicum of expertise in their field. Just look at all the famous CEO's who have bankrupted one company only to be hired to run another. John Thain is the most recent, having presided over the downfall of Merrill Lynch only to be hired to run CIT. I have also seen where pure competence actually has proven detrimental to one's success when it threatens others in the decision chain. It's not good to outshine the wrong people.    A fellow executive once told me that the harder he worked the luckier he got. There is some truth to that but pure luck also plays a hand. The coincidence of skill set and need are the most obvious examples. One has to wonder if Bill Gates came to the marketplace today whether he would be as successful. The creative stagnation of Microsoft suggests not. Steve Jobs is an interesting counterpoint.    So I must join with others in commending Gladwell for his engaging writing but defer as to his insight.

B000001EGE|5.0|Right or wrong, I tend to compartmentalize Elton John. Those albums from his first through Goodbye Yellowbrick Road, when he was a writter expermenting with styles, and the drug fuled specticles of Caribu and after.<br /><br />But of those fantastic early albums, Honky Chateu is by far the best. As a writer and musician, Elton here was able to take all the experiments going back to his first album and synthsize them into an amazing, unpretentious album of fantastic music.<br /><br />Look at him! Beard, glasses, looking down thinking. This is a musician that we can all relate to, and hang out with. You get no hint of what is about to come as Elton's act became 1970s stage cheese.<br /><br />\\"Honky Cat,\\" is one of the best funk singles of the 1970s, bar none. \\"Rocket Man\\" is Elton reaching melodic heights that compete with the Bealtes. \\"I Think I'm Gonna Kill Myself\\" is both funny and frightening: the kind of confessional satrie that Ray Davies matered. Is he kidding, or not.<br /><br />All of this is done with a great back up band, and no showmanship--a good thing. It is great music by a great writter.<br /><br />Had Elton made more albums like Honky Chateu, he may not have sold as many show tickets, but he would be up their with Paul, John, Ray, some of the best/<br /><br />Remembered only for the music.
B002T9H2LK|2.0|I was a bit surprised, I expected more, based upon the trailors.  I wanted to see it in the movies, but missed it and bought the movie expecting a great time.........I was dissapointed.
B00200K2UG|5.0|Great storage bag for all of my equipment....have Canon 50D with 18-200 attached and 5 other lenses including a Sigma 150-500 and still room for more lenses.  Also have a multitude of filters, remotes, a Macbook, and an assortment of other gadgets in this bag.  A little bulky and heavy to carry everywhere, but great to keep eveything where I need it.  I have three other bags that I use and take the equipment I need for each assignment.  Construction is top drawer and a great looking gadget bag to boot.  Totally happy with it!

0446580945|4.0|I love Nicholas Sparks books!  This one was another great that I couldn't put down....even though it left me very sad the next day.  I felt so sorry for John through the whole book!  The thing I didn't like about this book was the ending (hoping the movie has a better one).  If you are a Sparks fan you will love this book!
B002RSDW80|5.0|I LOVED this movie and enjoy it every time I watch it.  Meryl Streep did a great job portraying Julia Child and I loved Stanley Tucci as her husband.  I think all of the actors brought something wonderful to their characters...Loved the \\"lobster killer\\" scene with Julie and her husband.  I only hope you enjoy this movie as much as I am enjoying it!

This being that I can always find someone to take a low compensated employee's place.  They are easy to find and hire.  Small business owner, you have become what America started with the industrial revoluation.  We will take care of you if you do exactly what we tell you to do.  Oh yes, we will also lay you off when the economy sucks and you can be quickly replaced based on our discretion.      Or could you become a small business owner that follows the new paradigms of leadership that encourages employees to think on their own; add value by listening to their creative, new, how to improve their role or company suggestions which by-the-way, increases your bottom line.

B001GQACGE|1.0|Ok, first of all most of the singles were not really big hits except for maybe two of the ridiculously 6 released from this album.  Why win all these grammys for an album that was more explosive in the late 2008-2009 years.  Just because it's Beyonce that is why.  PLEASE.  This album is just as bad as BDay.  A low down dirty shame.  Girl, you need a break.
B00003A9QI|3.0|I love the music from this movie--it is very moving.  However, many of the pieces seem unfinished--there is exactly the number of stanzas needed for the movie and no more. What a loss for the rest of us.
B000EWBKK8|4.0|Upon my son's recommendation I watched Lord of War.  I had never heard of the movie so I was a little skeptical.   I found the movie extremely well done and enjoyed it.  As disturbing as the portrayal of the arms business was, I was even more captivated by the fact that what was in the movie seemed that it could be very reflective of real life. I would recommend the movie.

0812973992|5.0|If this were a movie rather than a novel, it might look like the unlikely marriage of \\"Man on a Wire,\\" \\"Crash,\\" and \\"I've Loved You for So Long\\". The characters and their worlds are so compelling, it's as though Colum McCann has pulled out all of the English language's pastels, oils, charcoals, pencils, and watercolors to paint them - and then gently centered his pictures around the pivotal image of a man on a wire. The detail is wonderful - and the style (imagine a more focused, optimistic, male Lonnie Moore) a modern, measured flow of consciousness.    Another thing I loved about this novel is that while it clearly stands as a post-9-11 novel throughout, McCann never once actually mentions \\"9-11\\". Even as we become absorbed in another era, McCann's in-the-background focus on the towers holds us in the present. I hope this passage, one of my favorites, will give you a sense of what I'm trying to describe:    \\"He figured that the tightrope walker must have thought it over  quite a bit beforehand. It wasn't just an offhand walk. He was  making a statement with his body, and if he fell, well, he fell--  but if he survived he would become a monument, not carved in stone  or encased in brass, but one of those New York monuments that made  you say: *Can you believe it?* With an expletive. There would always  be an expletive in a New York sentence.\\"    If I were writing a New York sentence, I'd recommend this novel with an expletive. As it is, I feel I cannot recommend it highly enough.
0670021652|4.0|Yes, it is not Eat, Pray, Love the sequel and she expresses that more than enough in the book. I personally, as a 33 year old single woman found it incredibly interesting. She did a lot of research on marriage, how it came about, the changes it went through over millennia... It was thought provoking, and it really helped me with questions I've had about love, and why do people get together if they don't want kids, or to keep up with the Jones', etc. I think she comes across as authentic, and I really appreciated her honesty, and her sharing of intimate moments, as well as the sharing of her very own private fears. I want to thank her for this book. She made many valid and interesting points. I think young women who are considering marriage should read this, not to talk themselves out of it, but to make sure they've really thought it through. It's not a fairy tale after all; it's your life.
0756405890|5.0|I, being interested in helping people that help people, bought this book upon hearing that the author was helping people in some way. I was rather surprised when i got it that it was an interesting book. Well, more than that, it was captivating book. It weaves a spell around you without your suspicions being aroused. It is more than a mature \\"harry potter\\" or a \\"love story,\\" it has a world of it's own which is very authentic and carefully constructed. The setting comes alive and creates the prefect place in which the characters to live. I enjoyed reading it very much and I am looking forward to the next in the series.
0312370849|4.0|Do you choose books by their covers? I remember looking many times at Sara's Key in the store. The cover has a very French-looking image, slightly sepia-toned, of a small boy and girl running where parents might ask them to walk, with the Eiffel Tower standing tall in the distant sky. It intrigued me, but the words, such as \\"profoundly moving...morally challenging...nothing short of miraculous...\\" underneath weren't enough to encourage me to buy.<br /><br />Luckily something was enough to encourage my friend, and she loaned me her copy recently, for which I'm profoundly grateful. Sara's Key is a lovely book, a superbly constructed tale set in past and present, with the sort of timing that leaves the reader breathlessly coming up on a conclusion just as the secret's about to be revealed.<br /><br />Of course, that conclusion comes only half-way through the book, and there's a longer present-day tale, full of the consequences of secrets hid and mysteries revealed. There are no easy answers in this book, and nobody comes off as perfect. But with all the characters' flaws and imperfections, there's a truth and honesty that shines stubbornly through.<br /><br />The novel centers round the arrest and deportation of French Jews in Paris during World War II, and the subsequent cover-up. I already knew the main points of the story, having grown up in Europe, but the novel makes them personal in a very powerful way, following a young girl who has hidden her brother away to keep him safe just before the French police arrive. Hope and despair alternative in the reader as well as on the page, while 60 years later an American woman, married to a Frenchman, tries to uncover the past without hurting her family or the children of the present.<br /><br />The dilemmas of life and death, risk and security, truth and comfort all thread through Rosnay's tale. How do we protect those we love and stay true to ourselves? And what if we fail?<br /><br />I didn't cry when I read this book, but I nearly did. The ending actually disappointed me, though I'm not sure why; it was certainly true to the tale. But maybe such a story isn't set up to please. I truly loved it and will probably buy a copy of my own one day so I can read it again, and maybe I'll understand why the ending is just right.ppointed me, though I'm not sure why; it was certainly true to the tale.

B0002YLC24|1.0|If you are having trouble sleeping some night, pop this movie into your DVD player and you will be out like a light in no time.  I found this movie extremely boring.  I am a fan of Ethan Hawke's, but I think he should stick to just acting, not screenwriting, as he collaborated on this movie to write the screen play along with Julie Delpy and the gentleman who directed it.  Julie should also stick to acting, and singing, in my opinion.  She really has a lovely voice and gift for playing the guitar.  That was the most pleasant part of the movie (and of course the sights and sounds of France.) All in all, this movie definitely didn't cut it for me.  If you must see it, save your $$ and rent it at the library.  Thumbs down!
B001FB55L2|4.0|I am currently deployed in Iraq, first duty and hopefully my last.  My significant other came back home from Iraq and totally cam back as a different person.

You were fumbling with a bag of Andy Capp fries and balancing a soft serve ice cream cone in the cup holder. She asked how the heat was to blame for your stupidity. Skipping songs had no discernible effect on her line of questioning so you quietly suggested that perhaps the next ream of uncomfortable rest stop snow showers down less silent, and more silver. Season one is the tops! Highly re'd.

B001PHTPDU|5.0|I bought this hard cover copy of the book as a gift for a friend after I read it in paperback and was spell-bound.    Naomi Klein's incredibly well-researched and foot-noted book will make you completely re-think capitalism as it has been interpreted by the likes of Milton Friedman, Alan Greenspan, Jeffrey Sachs and the entire Chicago school of economics over the past half century.      This rivetting sociological study recounts how economic shock therapy has jolted whole nations, from Chile to Bolivia, to Poland into embracing an economic system that perpetuates the cruelest of inequality and political oppression in the name of free market enterprise.

B00000JRTX|4.0|I paid an acceptable price, the product was delivered on time and in good condition.
0439023483|5.0|I have seen this book on so many lists for so long, but never made the purchase before, because frankly the storyline sounds too depressing and gruesome to be something we want to read.  But it wasn't.  I finally bought the book, and am so glad I did!  I devoured it, then my daughter did, and we are regretting not ordering Catching Fire (book 2) at the same time.  It's on its' way now, but we really, really don't want to wait.  This subject of the book could be described as a futuristic gladiator kind of thing, but don't let that stop you.  It is so much more.  It will haunt you when you have finished, but not in a gruesome way.  This is not a book that I might typically think my daughter would love, but oh, my, it was.  I don't know how the author pulls you in and makes you care about the characters as much as she does, and it is heart-wrenching, and breath-taking and full of ups and downs like you wouldn't believe.  We have an extensive YA collection, and I have to say that this book has surged to the top.    I'll need to make sure all of my daughter's friends (both boys and girls) have copies as well.  Looking for a smart, capable female character?  Heroic kids?  Adventure?   Suspense?  Philosophy?   Romance?  Look no further.  This book has got it all, and is one you'll want your sons and daughters both to read -- and one that they won't be able to stop reading once they pick it up.  Enjoy.
B000GIWS7E|5.0|There was nothing my son wanted more for christmas than \\"Dream Theater\\" music.  After searching high and low for the cd's I finally found them on amazon, and for a price I could actually afford, and he was able to receive more than one for christmas.

B0002KVUKW|5.0|My granddaughter loves this movie.  I bought it for her because the first one she owned got all scratched up.

006135323X|5.0|I've read dozens of books on Psychology and every bit of its subsets... This book is actually funny! Before I knew it I was halfway into the book.  It makes you think, laugh, and question.  I highly recommend this book.  It's easy to see why this book was on the New York Times bestseller list.
B002UD56I6|1.0|Another sad example of selling even the dead, a rehearsal sold as a great show. He was an above average dancer and singer (not a great voice compared, lets say to Marvin Gay or Stevie Wonder), with a rather limited production of true hits, the Beatles for example wrote, produced and hatched 20 albums from 1964 to 1969. NOBODY WROTE FOR THEM. Save your money. These are old songs rehashed and not as cool as the old videos - maybe the \\"producers\\" should concentrate on a true remastered compilation of those on true HD picture and audio. Don't get me wrong he did a few good songs, but the amount was truly scanty compared to others in the same amount of time.
B000P0J0G0|5.0|A bit of Fry and Laurie is by far one of the funnest shows of all time. It might take a bit of getting the hang of. It's a lot like meeting two prople who have known each other a long time, your not familear with the brand of humor that they have developed between themselves. But once you get to know it, you can't help but love it. If you've never seen \\"A bit of Fry and Laurie\\" I do recomend Watching the first season last, the second season and forward are easyer to get the hang of(I'm not saying the first season isn't any good, it's probley the best)     If comedy was a weapon Steve Fry and Hugh Laurie would kill us all.
B002I9Z8I0|2.0|I just purchased both boxed sets of Star Trek movie DVDs -- the original cast and The Next Generation.<br /><br />I started to watch the Special Features, and found that I could access all but the first special feature which was the commentary.  This was aggravating enough, but then I clicked the Scene Selection area, and every scene resulted in scenes with commentary. I checked every other disc in the box, and in each case I could not access individual scenes or the first item in the Special Features list. For troubleshooting purposes, I inserted a completely different movie as a comparison, and it worked exactly as it should. There is nothing wrong with my DVD player, remote control, or the person operating them.<br /><br />AS it turns out, once the movies are opened and viewed, I can't return them even though they are defective. I love Star Trek -- all of them -- but this was a very disappointing evening, to say the least!

0385504225|2.0|Dan Brown's long awaited novel \\"The Lost Symbol\\" follows the dashing Robert Langdon through 12 hours in Washington D.C..  Why it takes 500 pages to describe the events of 12 hours remains a mystery, though, probably not the sort of mystery Brown had in mind.     Brown's latest novel is formula driven. First, establish that Langdon is fit and attractive - check. Next, add a beautiful, intelligent, and possibly available woman to the story - check. Ensure that Langdon and his leading lady are crossed and double-crossed - check and check.  It's all a bit tiresome.     Brown's books are known for surprises. I was 400 pages into this one before I was surprised, but at least there was (finally) a surprise. The book isn't bad, but I found it disappointing.  That said, if you enjoy thrillers, give it a try.
0307454541|5.0|I'm in the process of reading this fascinating book. Did you know there is a statue of limitations on murder in Sweden? There is no such limitation in the U.S. on murder. Makes me think about which is the better approach. I highly recommend this book because it's a great mystery and it also gives the reader a peek into a different culture.
B002T9H2LA|2.0|The film is mostly in French or German with subtitles (and reading them gets to be a chore REAL quickly).  What's worse, Quentin Tarantino tries to go art noir with this film and (unlike in Pulp Fiction, or Kill Bill) fails to pull it off.  What's supposed to be new and artistic just comes off as weird and boring.  Tarantino severely curtails the amount of action and gore that normally suffice for someone who just doesn't click with his quirky style of writing and directing.  The movie was portrayed in advertisements as Tarantino turning the tables on history and having the movie be essentially a two hour gore-filled, splatterfest fantasy of Jews terrorising Nazies.  We were lied to, and we want those two hours of our lives back.

B001U887MY|4.0|I got these for walking the dog when it is cold and wet out. They are comfortable, and slip on and off quickly. Amazon's price is fantastic; the best I could find anywhere.    My only criticism is in cleaning the lining. There are no instructions provided on how to remove the lining, although I found some searching the Internet. It requires a lot of force to stretch the lining holes over the rivets. You are not supposed to put the linings in the dryer, and it takes a few days for them to completely air dry.    Otherwise these are great shoes!

1563890119|5.0|The Sandman series is a remarkable set of graphic novels for adult readers.  \\"Preludes and Nocturnes\\" sets the stage for the series in Neil Gaiman's uniquely creative style.  In addition to his own expansive imagination, he draws upon a wide range of mythological allusions to create a new mythology that is every bit as meaningful and self-contained as any \\"real\\" mythology such as Judean-Christian, Greek, or Roman.  In doing so, he pays homage to those mythologies without taking away anything from them.      The craftsmanship of the story telling and writing is equal to any conventional novel, and the stories are completed by striking artwork from a variety of different graphic artists.  Dave McKean is one of my favorite artists in the series, and he did many of the covers.  This series is, in my opinion, among the finest adult-oriented graphic novels ever;  and it has earned many national and international awards.  If you like The Sandman, you may also want to check out David Mack's Kabuki and JK Woordward's Fallen Angel.      MIke
B001E75QH0|4.0|I remember being 7 years old and walking in to the opening night show of RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK. After several viewings in as many theaters as I could find it in over the years (found it in an IMAX theater once... WOW!), and the approximately 200 times I've seen it I've seen it on both VHS (standard and widescreen) and then the beauteous 4-disc Trilogy set with the supplemental features disc... well, let's just leave it with RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK is my favorite film ever. Despite its miniscule flaws in historical accuracy and a few shot-continuity errors, it's a perfect film. Humongously entertaining with great effects (certainly for 1981!), terrific acting, sparkling dialogue, and a breathless pace, it's the perfect piece of Hollywood entertainment.<br /><br />INDIANA JONES AND THE TEMPLE OF DOOM, which suffers at times from a very average script, other continuity errors in the Indy mythology, and a lackluster female lead, still manages to be very entertaining and heart-stopping (pun intended), and Ford is still as charming as ever.<br /><br />INDIANA JONES AND THE LAST CRUSADE is near-perfect. Spielberg recovers from the somewhat dark prequel with a bright, engaging, and extremely entertaining final act to the Indy Trilogy. Certain character moments are bothersome, but it reunites the original cast members (sans Karen Allen) and adds Dr. Henry Jones Sr., with a spot-on performance by Sean Connery. Who else but James Bond could be the father of Indiana Jones?<br /><br />So there you have it. Probably the best trilogy of all time.<br /><br />UNTIL...<br /><br />Hey, understand this first, for the people hating on Spielberg for the celluloid crime that is INDIANA JONES AND THE KINGDOM OF THE CRYSTAL SKULL: This film was hardly directed by Spielberg. In fact, this film has George Lucas's tacky, CGI-heavy, sci-fi fetish fingerprints ALL OVER IT. It looks like one of the STAR WARS prequels set on our planet instead of something a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away. There were so many times that I prayed there would be a fourth film, but that was back in the 1990's. The EARLY TO MID 1990's, when Harrison Ford hadn't become a Hollywood joke yet. But the mere fact that it was 19 years after the previous Indy adventure should have been convincing enough for anyone to just stay away. If anyone was pushing for this film to be made, it was Ford, who has slowly been watching his star become dimmer and dimmer over the last decade and a half. This is a film that so clearly did NOT need to be made that it boggles the mind why it did.<br /><br />Now, I'm not one of those \\"Lucas Raped My Childhood\\" idiots. Despite the return of Karen Allen and the additions of great actors like Ray Winstone, Cate Blanchett and John Hurt... this is just a film that never needed to happen. It felt like a poor excuse to bring these people together again. And the film itself has nothing redeeming about it. It has a climax that literally had me thinking I had somehow fallen asleep and woke up in another film, uninspired action set pieces, and its complete reliance on CG rather than practical effects just makes it that much harder to watch. Believe me when I say that I wanted SO BADLY to love this film, but even while watching it... I knew that something had gone very wrong.<br /><br />So three films of varying degrees of excellence and one film that just doesn't do anything... My advice: Get it anyway and gift KOTCS to your niece or nephew. Kids will probably like it. Because having the first three films is more than worth it.rayed there would be a fourth film, but that was back in the 1990's.

It felt like a poor excuse to bring these people together again. And the film itself has nothing redeeming about it. It has a climax that literally had me thinking I had somehow fallen asleep and woke up in another film, uninspired action set pieces, and its complete reliance on CG rather than practical effects just makes it that much harder to watch. Believe me when I say that I wanted SO BADLY to love this film, but even while watching it... I knew that something had gone very wrong.     So three films of varying degrees of excellence and one film that just doesn't do anything... My advice: Get it anyway and gift KOTCS to your niece or nephew. Kids will probably like it. Because having the first three films is more than worth it.

B0035XMGXS|4.0|Let's just say I'm not your typical JB fan. In fact, I think I could care less for them. However, after going to a Nick Jonas and the Administration concert with a friend, I completely threw away my old opinion of Nick. The concert was amazing, highly energetic, and fun. He did not take this opportunity for granted, everyone could tell. I wouldn't have known it was Nick Jonas singing if I was blindfolded. This kid is going on a path to REAL success...without his brothers, please. This CD is not for your typical adolescent, and the powerhouse band that plays along Nick is not bad at all. So if you're thinking about buying this CD, give this kid a break. You can actually tell he's trying, that he has passion for what he does, and that he is definitely talented.  I gave this four stars because I believe, personally, Nick has much more to work on. But he is definitely on the right path to stardom (as if he wasn't already on that track!), but he is definitely geared towards a more mature take with this CD. Two words: GET IT.

B001F12J0C|5.0|Being a fan of Ludlum's \\"Bourne\\" books, I was eagerly anticipating the first film of the series to see how exactly Doug Liman and writer Tony Gilroy were going to adapt the anti-hero to a more modern setting. Taking it from the jungles of Vietnam and the pursuit of Carlos the Jackal, and making it into a high-speed, high-intensity techno-thriller that is quite literally about identity was no small feat. And also making it a really intelligent, extremely well-acted actioner was a task that Liman, Gilroy, and Damon were able to pull off quite well. THE BOURNE IDENTITY set us up for everything that was to come: a very independent attitude brought to the Hollywood style of filmmaking; a great cast of indie players, like Chris Cooper, Franka Potente, Julia Stiles, Brian Cox and Clive Owen; a refreshing approach to the immediacy and improvisation of hand-to-hand combat; it's a near-perfect modernization of the tale of Jason Bourne.<br /><br />THE BOURNE SUPREMACY took that even further. With director Paul Greengrass coming in, who, instead of opting for Liman's more distanced approach to the action which is more appropriate for a Hollywood film, took us directly into the action. With fast cuts, shaky camera shots, and use of sound so that we no longer seem like we're watching the combat, but actually a participant in it, Greengrass (and returning writer Gilroy) sets a slightly different tone, and heightens the intensity that much more. And with the additions of Joan Allen and Karl Urban and Martin Csokas, and keeping Cox, Stiles, Potente and Cooper, Greengrass knows how to do it right. This is most certainly not a film for purists of the Bourne books because this film perhaps has more deviations than the other films from the book's plot points, but it keeps with the main plot, which is the Bourne impostor designed to bring Bourne out in the open. Also Greengrass seems to have more of a handle on bringing a more intense and more personal tale out of the character of Jason Bourne than Liman did, but that also may be a luxury of doing a sequel as well.<br /><br />THE BOURNE ULTIMATUM is the ultimate icing on the cake of this series, and is quite simply the best film of the series. Greengrass comes back onboard, with Gilroy in tow as well, and they bring actors like Paddy Considine, Scott Glenn, Albert Finney and the always-great David Strathairn to round it out. The film is ingenious in many ways, most specifically how it ties this film to SUPREMACY, because scenes that we saw in the previous film reappear in this one in very, very suprising ways. But Greengrass ups the ante once again, and brings Bourne full circle to where it all began. And again, Greengrass never lets up on the viewer for a second once the intrigue and the action and the suspense begin. He lets those moments build to a full boil, and just when you think you can't take it anymore, he goes for the kill.<br /><br />It's obvious the mark that the BOURNE films have left on the contemporary spy thriller. If you watch the Bond film QUANTUM OF SOLACE, it seems like there are literally entire scenes stolen from the BOURNE films. Unfortunately that didn't help that film. But fortunately, if it can help to reshape the genre of the spy thriller and bring it in a new and more vital direction, with less emphasis on gadgetry and more on character while keeping the globe-trotting action and suspense, then it makes the BOURNE TRILOGY all that much better.than Liman did, but that also may be a luxury of doing a sequel as well.

This insight edition from Bethany House provides the original story and include historical details, facts, comparisons to today's culture, themes of faith, and additional comments.<br /><br />In all honesty, I love this insight edition and am planning to also purchase the insight edition for Pride and Prejudice...and sincerely hope that there will be insight editions for Jane Austen's other novels. Aside from the covers being gorgeous, the content is a wonderful help and really adds to the original book.

It's a great sensation, experiencing on your own a thing that history has already proven to be a classic. It turns out -- shocker -- that hundreds of thousands of people weren't wrong. The album is 7 perfect tracks -- and 'Take Five' has got to be the coolest track of all time. It's two weeks later and I can't stop playing this album. Get it!

It had good characters it wasn't to cliche it had really strong scenes the movie does make you use your head I felt the adrenaline pump during the bomb defuseal scenes I really was like oh these guys are f****d during 1 of the shoot out scenes. There aren't a lot of female directors out there but it's nice to see a female director get her props I was entertained sure I was I just felt it was overrated to the max & it wasn't God awful like Halloween 2 I just saw it's just ok. IMO it's worth a rental nothing I'll go & buy right now maybe $5 in a bargain bin. If you just thought it was just the greatest movie ever it's fine I got some enjoyment out of it but it was over hyped it's my opinion. So to each there own.

1577314808|4.0|Living in the NOW is liberating. The author enumerates the benefits of living in the now and gives practical expertise on how to achieve this seemingly easy goal but one which is surprisingly elusive.    The book while speaking of spiritual enlightenment, is really a take it or leave it type of spirituality, so don't get put off by that if you aren't into it. It's more philosophical than anything else, but without losing sense of practicality. In fact, it centers on practicality almost as a mantra.    If you ever wondered how to break out of destructive cycles or habits, how to improve relationships, how to release stress and anger... live in the now. Learn how by reading this simple book.

B002ZG997M|5.0|The Book of Eli was a moving experience for me.  The story revolves around a wanderer named Eli who carries the last existing copy of the King James Bible for 30 years looking for the right person to give it to.  Along the way, he encounters the harsh reality of the post-apocalyptic world around him (a brutal environment, lawlessness, and a very determined local town boss named Carnegie who wants the book as a tool to control people).  The movie has a lot to say, which is refreshing for a movie with a lot of action.  In fact, it's hard to argue against The Book of Eli having more message behind it than any other major movie in years.  It examines the role of pure faith in our lives and how it interacts with the more earthly thing we call religion, which can be used for great good or great evil.<br /><br />The central conflict is between Eli and Carnegie.  Both are ultimately archetypes.  Eli is the humble man who lives what most of us would consider a near-ideal of absolute faith and dedication, with his one flaw being that he sometimes puts his task to protect the bible ahead of living by the teachings inside it.  In truth, this isn't so much a fault as a survival necessity if he is ever going to complete his mission to hand off the book, but it still is an issue that comes to bother him.  In this way, Eli reflects us all, and in his mission, he reflects a better way of living and the hope of building back a better world than the one that was destroyed.  Carnegie, for me, represents the desire to build back the world we currently live in.  For all he villainous ways, he's ultimately just a reflection of our modern world.  If he could get the bible, he would use it to gain personal power as he used religion as a tool to build an empire of followers around him, like a modern-day Mohammad (in the realpolitik military and political sense).  Probably he would also make people's lives easier and better superficially as he created more new towns and got \\"civilization\\" started again, but he desires the same corrupted world we live in today.  It's no coincidence that he's named after a legendary figure in our world who was very powerful and who shaped our civilization in a lot of ways.  It's also no coincidence that he is the one guy who acts and talks like someone from our world.  Excellent, seminal stuff.  Denzel Washington deserves an Oscar for his stoic, perfect performance.<br /><br />The other delicious part of The Book of Eli is the twist revelation late in the movie.  It caught me completely by surprise, but it fit the tone of the movie perfectly, and it made so much sense looking back.  It's one of those movies like Sixth Sense where you'll want to re-watch it after you find out just to see if the filmmakers covered all their bases!  That injects a little extra fun and life into the movie just at the time when the story itself is becoming more hopeful and rebirth dominates as a theme.<br /><br />Very highly recommended!

B0027CSNBM|5.0|The Demigod Files is a companion title to the Percy Jackson and the Olympians series. With its colorful pictures of Gods and half-bloods, interviews with miscelaneous campers, Three short stories, Map of Camp Half-blood, and crossword and word search, this book is loaded with all things Percy Jackson. It includes a wonderful example of what the average half-god, half-human is taking to camp this summer. This super guide even has a letter from the senior scribe at camp half-blood and sneak peek at the Last Olympian (which is already in print).  Don't read this book until you've at least read the first four!

B0012V4WSM|5.0|As it is with most EVA fans if you've seen the original series all the way through then you'll know pretty much how the story is meant to play out. However, with 1.01 and the following three movies Anno has remade the orginal series. In this reteling he has stated that \\"this is how EVA should have been. this is what i wanted it to be.\\" instead of the original 18 angels there is only 12-13 due to the short timespan in these movies.    In this first installment the movie covers roughly the first 6 episodes of the series. Very few things are changed about the story line itself. In fact this movie is nearly indentical to those episodes, just merely compacted. Some of the major changes inlcude the EVA's looking different. Different in the sense that they are now more relative in shape. Not really scale wise simply that the EVA's forms seem to look more real. The torso's arent as thin and look more realistic in a sense. Also the two EVA's seen in this first film have some minor chaonges in coloration also. Unit 01 now has a bright green section on its Torso and Unit 00 has been divided between a white lower body and a yellow upper body.     The characters and names have remained the same of course. the only real changes in story line is at the end of the film. During the ecounter with the 5th angel (Ramiel). Orignally this angel was just a floating octahedron capable of firing a bowerful beam and using a mechanical seeming drill to bore through the armor over the Geofront. Now its able to shift its form to some fairly dazziling displays and capable of far more destruction in the movie. Instead of the drill from the OVA it now is able to twist its shape and use its own body/power to drill down to the GeoFront. Along with the changes in this final batal of the movie, the means by which they destroy the angel has been upgraded and looks far better, to me, then it did in the OVA.     For those of us who have seen the entire series these first six episodes of course end with the destruction of the first three angels. however in the retelling the what was once the third angle (the first angel seen in the movie Sachiel) is now the fourth. there is no mention of course of the missing third angel. For new viewers of the series who instead purchased this version might be confused simply becase there is only mention of two other angels. those being Adam and Lilith. Lilith is actually shown and has had one minor change, that being its mask is no longer that of Seele. Its now just a plan tan mask.     In regard to the end of the actual movie. The scene with Kowaru on the moon speaking to the Seele monolith labeled 01. this is a very new and alltoghether never before seen clip for the series. I own the enitre OVA including the two DVD's released to retell the last two episodes of the OVA. Upon watching this movie i couldnt wait to see the remaining three. There are some changes seen in the preview of the second movie. Those being the introduction of Unit 02 and its pilot. there are some minor changes seen to Unit 02 as well in the short preview. There is even a glimpse of the Mark .06 EVA being constructed on the moon.     For those who never watched the series and are new to it i highly suggest watching the OVA first. In 1.01 there is very little description of NERV or Seele. let alone anything else. its all very cryptic and leaves you with alot of questions. It does make for an amazing story none the less. Along the lines of content, this movie has stuck fairly true to the series as i have said before. So for anyone who has seen the OVA i strongly suggest you buy this and even to those new to the series i reccomend you do the same.

1427208476|3.0|Sarah's story and what happened at the Vel' d'Hiv were interesting and very moving, but the saga of the self-absorbed, whiney Julia and her deteriorating marriage, abortion decision, and anything happiening in 2002, was yawns-ville.  (If you want to read a well-written book about Paris/France during WWII, read Suite Francaise, by Irene Nemirovsky.)  The most irritating thing, however, was the horrible French accent used by the reader.  Not to mention, if people are speaking French to each other, then they wouldn't have a French accent!  I was interested in finding out how the story ended, but I had to FORCE myself to listen to this reader.
0446569895|5.0|I loved this book.  Don't think I have ever laughed so hard in my life.  As Bill Ward once said to Ozzy, if your singing don't work out you can be a comedian.

Any Ozzy fan will enjoy this.
B003102JDM|2.0|I am a big C-Bros fan - I thought \\"No Country for Old Men\\", among others, was excellent.  I am a big art-house movie fan.  \\"A Serious Man\\" however misses the mark.  I feel like it's one of those well packaged indie films that is supposed to impress critics everywhere, and they fear if they speak ill of it they will be seen as those who did not \\"get\\" or \\"appreciate\\" it.  Sure, the acting is good.  Sure, the direction is spot-on.  When I go to the movies though, I want to root for some character, or at least identify in some part with something on screen.  Maybe I'm just too nice a guy, but every character in this film was unlikable, from the wicked children, the unfaithful wife, the \\"other\\" man, the crooked student, and even the priest who was as disconnected from his flock as they come.  I get this film was chock-full of Biblical symbolism, but what it boils down to is that I just didn't care because it was just unpleasant.  Maybe knowing that before you watch it will give you more time to appreciate it for it's technical elements, but I really cannot in good conscious suggest viewing this, let alone buying it.
B002BW7A58|3.0|Am going to give you the negatives and the positives of the album. the negative are needed more songs on the album which is the biggest to me, second more quality songs in which you wont get tired of so fast, third more flow    positive is something new for a chance rap and rock together is kind of good, second the artist Shanell is good she has a nice voice, production was good    Last thoughts are this album is going to want you wanting his next album bad and we dont know when that going to happen now, the song prom queen is sorry, and believe it or not I dont even like the song drop the world its sorry with no meaning
0446569895|5.0|I picked this up off Amazon and read the book within 2 days of purchase. It was tough to put down.  The book is basically divided into 2 parts. The first, being devoted to his upbringing and time in Black Sabbath.  This was THE best part of the book. His recollection of these times are priceless and was a very entertaining read. The second part, however, was devoted to his life with Sharon and life as a \\"celebrity\\". He glossed over most of his solo career. With the time and attention spent on Black Sabbath, i would have preferred to have read as much detail about recording his first two solo albums with Randy and the next two with Jake E. Lee. Randy's inclusion is minimal and Jake is mentioned only in passing twice. I know a lot went down with Jake E. Lee and was looking forward to hearing what Ozzy would have to say, but there's nothing. We do hear EVERY detail about life with Sharon though...  In any event, Its still a great book to read, even just for the first half.  Its almost as good as the Crue's \\"The Dirt\\" but comes up a bit short due to the relentless \\"Sharonisms\\".
B002GJU0XU|5.0|Dr. Tucker does an amazing job of presenting straight-forward facts. This book is filled with fascinating case histories that have been meticulously documented by Drs. Stevenson and Tucker. They are inexplainable in their detail and are incredibly complex. Dr. Tucker focuses mainly on past-life recall through memories of children, matching birthmarks, and other documentable evidence. It might disappoint some that he stays away from memories from hypnosis, but the book is undeniable in its strong evidence because of his focus.

B002SQ3664|5.0|This was a real treat. Being an extreme Woodstock-phile I know alot of small behind the scenes facts and details. The Michael Wadleigh documentary is simply the holy grail of doco's! I was under the assumption parts of this were made up for the movie and I refused to go to the theatre to see it. I was sooo wrong! Not only is it factual, they nailed so many details taken and recreated from the documentary!Like the nuns being filmed while flashing a peace sign! The Earth Light players! Hog Farmers!     All of the people who whine that it's a movie about a concert with no music in it, GO WATCH THE MICHAEL WADLEIGH 4 HOUR DOCUMENTARY! In fact, if ya wanna make a weekend of it, watch them back to back! This tells the background of the concert and the local politics. You don't need a movie with the music in it...The documentary already exists and more people need to become hip to it. This movie just made my heart jump when the first helicopter lands at the El Monaco motel!    Eugene Levy's portrayal as Max Yasgur is uncanny. No other actor could have pulled that off but him. He looks and talks just like the real Max. Watch the documentary right before Hendrix near the end and you won't believe the likeness! A perfect companion to the Academy Award winning documentary!
0446569895|5.0|This is a remarkable story about a remarkable man. Remarkable mostly because, at age 60, he's still alive! Still recording, still performing; having seen him perform live two years ago, he's better than ever. No one can tell Ozzy's story - truthfully, that is - except Ozzy. I grew up with Ozzy, so to speak. I loved him and my mother hated him; she used to tell me that I would rot my brain listening to \\"that Ozzy Osbourne trash.\\" You won't find anything in this book except the truth as only Ozzy knows it. Having no reason to lie about his wicked past and every reason to finally set the record of his life straight, Ozzy's book is a weird mix of outrageous humor, deep love for his wife and children, bewilderment at his own success, and perseverence despite overwhelming personal and professional obstacles. If you've loved Ozzy as his fans have for almost 40 years, this book will again show you why. And if you've hated him for just as long, it will show you why you're mistaken.<br /><br />This is a tale told well.
1439153663|4.0|American historical fiction can be tough.  Let's face it, 233 years isn't very much to draw from.  So historical fiction set in America is usually lumped in the Western genre or tends to romanticize the Civil War.<br /><br />Author Kathleen Grissom, though, chose to set her novel entitled The Kitchen House on a small Virginia tobacco plantation in years 1791 through 1810, which we found unique and intriguing.  The story is told from the point of view of two women: Lavinia, an Irish indentured servant girl, and Belle, the mulatto daughter of the plantation owner.<br /><br />Grissom opens the novel with a terrifying prologue, then skips back ten years to recount the events that led up to the prologue.  She tells the story via Lavinia and Belle in alternating chapters.  I enjoyed this technique for the most part, although I soon became keenly aware that Belle's chapters were significantly shorter than Lavinia's chapters - and for no discernible reason, which gave a slightly one-sided feel to the novel.<br /><br />The great crux of the story is one giant family secret that leads to assumptions which leads to tragedy.  While that is a fantastic premise, the principal characters had 384 pages and countless opportunities to correct the wrong assumptions.  Of course they didn't and that's what furthered the plot, but this became slightly frustrating after 200 pages or so.<br /><br />Aside from that, Grissom clearly excels at characterization.  Motivations are key to understanding characters in this novel and the development of each character pushes the plot along at a nice pace.<br /><br />Don't look for national politics or events of the time to play a large role in this story.  Rather, it is a microcosm of a society that justifies slavery of fellow human beings and the unavoidable fall-out that must follow.<br /><br />If you enjoy this time period in American historical fiction, I'd certainly recommend reading this novel.
0451203933|5.0|\\"If it can go wrong, it will\\". For someone who is not a solider, author Mark Bowden does an excellent job of recapturing what happened in a tiny, squallor ridden city of Mogadishu (Somolia) on Oct 3, 1993.<br /><br />The book starts off at lift off - you are in a helicopter taking off - there is no background history, no introductions, you're there with a prayer. You follow the men of Delta Force and Rangers as they get caught with one SNAFU after another in an urban battle they did not expect and cost far more than anyone would have thought. Most of the world remembers the images on TV of US dead soldiers being dragged around after the battle.<br /><br />In his epilogue, Bowden says he wanted to write a history of this battle that would read like a novel. He succeeds and rightly won a Pulizter Prize for this investigative work. This story shows American soldiers at their absolute best and how such highly trained, well equipped, highly motivated soldiers could win a battle and loose the war.<br /><br />In the epilogue, Bowden gives a little of the background of what went on before and why these troops were there. Unless you've read up on it (Tom Clancy's work \\"Battle Ready\\" has a lot of information about Somolia) it's a litte vague. Definate must reading for anyone with an interest in urban warfare, fighting insurgents or simply a \\"can't put this book down\\" real life thriller. Salute to the author and especially the men who fought and died in the \\"Mog\\".
0812973992|5.0|I feel that there have been so many great reviews written, all I can do is add to the praise for this book. About halfway through it, I remarked that it may be one of the best books I have ever read. Now that I am finished I think I need to wait a couple of months and make sure I am certain before I proclaim it the best ever. It's a beautiful work.<br /><br />McCann is so good at taking ordinary, boring lives, and transforming them in to fantastic tales of humanity and complexity. Especially impressive is his ability to tailor his writing style to a particular narrator. This is what leads, I believe, to the charges that the writing is disjointed at times. I remember one particular passage when a judge is talking about the crimes and cases that he sees in his court. For one entire paragraph, he lists many of the charges in one run-on sentence. Sure, this is a little hard to read, but I saw it as a fed-up over-worked man going on a hopeless rant of disparagement.<br /><br />McCann does try to add a 'hook' to each character, like the poor black woman who loves opera, or the prostitute who reads Rumi. But instead of being racist or patronizing, I think he is trying to convey that even in the midst of hopelessness and despair, there is always something beautiful about every person's life. Yes, Gloria may have lost her sons and live in a neighborhood where she gets mugged, but she escapes to the opera where she can remove her shoes and lose herself in the music.<br /><br />Although the book is centered on the tightrope walker, its focus is on people. And all the bravery and weakness and beauty and vice that humanity entails.

I was so impressed at how this film was put together. I highly recommend this movie, even if you don't think your a fan of any of these musicians, once you watch this you will be on some level.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|Everyone should see this movie! It is well documented and very informative.  This inhumane treatment of the animals who give their short lives to feed us has to stop.   Our food source is becoming completely adulterated with Genetically modified seed and cloned animals, and we need to wake up as a country and put an end to this madness. It's like Mad Scientists are testing their concoctions on society.

B00000AFWZ|4.0|A chain in Australia was trying to sell this for around AU$100 here...makes you thankful for the internet! This is yet another album that I'd never heard of, until recently, which is viewed as being important and influential by various sources. Found the sound quality on this box set good, if a little on the bright side, which is preferable to something muddy sounding, for me at least. Anyway, I found the box set entirely listenable...no real dud songs, and a few which are really very good...nuggets, if you will. This series is described as influential. What struck me the most was how influenced many acts on this box set were by the major acts who do not appear here...acts like The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, Bob Dylan, The Mammas & The Pappas, The Beach Boys etc. Whereas being derivative today can give a band an unkind label, listening to some derivative songs on this compilation is interesting, as time has passed for the bands that some acts here drew on. I'm sure that critics use the term \\"influential\\" for the impact of this box set on others. In other words, the non-derivative acts. Maybe that is true. A person online gave me that reading. Wasn't quite convinced, as these acts on this box set were many, and also young. Who influenced them? No doubt the British Invasion. The bands on this box set are young and indie/alt type bands...the same kinds of bands critics, I assume, are saying that they influenced. It's more of the same, as far as I'm concerned. The word \\"punk\\" is also bandied about for the contents of this box set. If you are expecting the kind of music that the British redefined as \\"punk\\", you will be sorely disappointed. This is the American use of the term \\"punk\\"...kids that adults maybe describe as ne'er do wells...not pseudo anarchists like Johnny Rotten of the Sex Pistols. Like I said, the music on here is mostly hard pop, pop-rock and 60s go-go dancing type music, but it does get more pop towards the latter songs in the box set.  Many songs do have psychedelic elements to them though.       I'll list a dozen songs that I found more likeable than most, then mention some of the derivative stuff, which is nonetheless entertaining:        The Nuggets:        The Nightcrawlers - Little Black Egg: has absolutely gorgeous lead guitar playing. It's bassy, with dual vocals. Superior sound quality to many songs on the box set. Vaguely Holly-ish vocals.    Paul Revere and the Raiders - Just like me: a really hard, funky track, with good harmonies. Has a catchy keyboard riff to it. The slow melody seems familiar to me.Not sure if it's this track or the one that precedes it which has a good guitar solo on it.     The Dovers - What am I gonna do?  - has a familiar melody at the start...not sure if it's something from The Seekers. A catchy track with a nice melody,  terrific chorus and harmonies.     Richard and the Young Lions - Open up your door : lovely guitar melody, harmonies. Woody percussion, with good use of a Beatles reference.           The best of the rest:        The Human Expression - Optical sound: an intriguing psychedelic piece, vocally and lyrically...and musically.     The Charlatans - Codine: has superior stereo sound. Male singer has a good American timbre to their voice...a bit Bruce Springsteeny, so to speak. A catchy, mid-tempo song. Sounds like the singer has been somewhere scary.    The Monks - Complication: has a very jarring  guitar sound to it. Lead vocal tone is cool and so is the backing singing. A raucous, bombastic piece, with some tough drumming. It's got a bit of \\"Numb\\" (U2) vibe to it, and it's a bit metal-y too...lyrics wise and speed drumming wise.    The Wailers - Out of our tree: a hard pop song with slamming drums. Has a good rhythm to it and is sing-along-able. Has backing vocals too. Interesting lyric, if I've made it out alright of: \\"God's in our past, checking through a garbage can\\".    Clefs of Lavender Hill - Stop! Get a ticket: has similar themes to The Beatles' \\"You're gonna lose that girl\\". Has a cool vocal tone and clapping.    Lyme & Cybelle - Follow me: nice male and female dual vocals and harmonies.    The Brigands - (Would I still be) her big man: features a nice guitar lick and some Hollies type harmonising. A good contrast to The Beach Boys type songs...these guy are class conscious and know they have to repay the loan for their car.           Most of the songs I like are on volume 4 (8 out 11), but like I said, the entire set is listenable...and my favourite track, \\"Little black egg\\" is on the 2nd volume.          Back to the issue of influences...another way that this box set shows its influences are the many songs you know of but may not be familiar with this version of them...e.g. Hendrix' version of \\"Hey Joe\\" may be the most famous, but it appears on here, performed by The Leaves.  You also hear The Amboy Dukes version of \\"Baby, please don't go\\" along with The Vandals' version of \\"Respect\\" (it has a good little keyboard riff that Aretha Franklin's version doesn't).           I'll finish off by mentioning some of the tracks that seem clearly influenced by more popular acts of the time:        Lies - has a brief \\"I wanna hold your hand\\" kind of intro. It's an early Beatles type song...along the lines of \\"It won't be long\\". Has John Lennon type vocals and lyrics. Catchy.    A public execution - a catchy, jaunty, Dylan-esque kind of song...along the lines of \\"Like a rolling stone\\". Staticky track though. Some songs on this box set sound better than others. Volume 3's \\"Let it out (let it all hang out)\\" is also channeling Dylan, vocally.    An invitation to cry - puts in mind Dusty Springfield, but here the singer is male, as is his backing vocalists. Does have a very un Dusty like jarring loud strumming on the guitar.     Sugar and spice - sounds like they use the guitar lick from The Seekers' hit \\"Hey there Georgie girl\\" (well, having just Wikid the Nuggets song, it seems that it's vice versa) and the lyrical format islike the song \\"Sheila\\"...forget which 1950's male sang that.     My world fell down - brings to mind The Beach Boys \\"God only knows\\" spliced with The Mammas & The Pappas.     Open my eyes - intro like The Who's \\"Can't explain\\", drum wise. Psychedelic kind of song.     Farmer John - has a Beach Boys' party kind of flavour, but with more of a \\"Game of love\\" vibe.    It's a happening - has an \\"And I love her\\" lick at the start, played by the bass guitar. It's sort of like the Beatles' lick, but faster.     I wonder - sort of like \\"In my life\\" as sung by Herman's Hermits.    Laugh laugh - has a lovely harmonica bit to it and a \\"Love potion #9\\" vibe to it, as well as a \\"And I love her\\" guitar bit and hints of Buddy Holly and The Everly Brothers.     It's cold outside - bit of a \\"Turn turn turn\\" vibe to it...and even more \\"Eve of destruction\\".     I need you - lots of influences from The Kinks here, like \\"All day and all of the night\\", the riffs, guitar sound and screaming.    Knock knock - has Mick Jagger type vocals. NIcke lick. Moody. Same goes for the song \\"Are you gonna be there (at the love-in)\\", but the lyrics are a bit more thoughtful than \\"Knock knock\\".       No doubt there are a lot more...like \\"Can't seem to make you mine\\" on volume 2, but with the similarity working forwards, to The Police's hit \\"Every breath you take\\"...the Nuggets' song has the lyric \\"With every breath and step I take\\". More interesting, in that vein, to me at least, is the song \\"Going all the way\\", which might have influenced Australian punk inventors The Saints...a song off of their classic \\"Eternally yours\\" album has a guitar lick very similar to the one in this song, from memory. Fans of great little Aussie pop-rock band The Divinyls might be interested to know that the song they covered as \\"Hey little boy\\" is here, but called \\"Little girl\\".  Most surprising of all is the Blues Magoos \\"(We ain't got) nothin' yet\\". The riff in this song is just like Deep Purple's \\"Black night\\"! But someone online mentioned that the riff is similar to a Liverpool 5! song as well as an Eddie Cochrane song, from memory. To me, it sounds like the Blue Magoos added a 'tail' to the earlier riff, and Deep Purple just put that riff into a cooler song! \\"Journey to the centre of the mind\\" has a vaguely \\"Barracuda\\" ish riff, and the guitars are a bit heavy metal/fuzz rock.      Recommendations:      If you like obscure psychedelia, try Twink's Think Pink album, or The Open Mind's Open Mind album. The Easybeats were a great Australian pop-rock band in the 1960's...lots of great songs, but only one international hit...a compilation of theirs might please those not from Australia.
B0011UY6HG|3.0|This dual album as a set has been compiled from several releases that Andsnes made with Ian Bostridge on Schubert's works.<br />It would suggest strongly that the pianist did not concentrate on these late Schubert sonatas as a continuous genre of compositions.<br />And it does show on the recording.<br />The works are played very conservatively, with little imagination, and often in a detached approach.<br />Too bad, because there are lots of keen contemproary competitions in the field of these late Schubert piano sonatas: Uchida, Brendel, Richter, Perahia, Pollini...<br />All the above pianists approached these works with a sense of summit conquering since the release of the great box set by Wilhelm Kempff in the mid-20th century.<br />Suffice it to mention that Andsnes has not fully grasped the contents and the style of these late sonatas. Despite the fact that he recorded them individually with some lieders of the composer, this did not carry with it a marked sense of awakening of the lyrical style that lies deeply embalmed in these works.

1573228737|5.0|I first met Sarah Waters work in [[ASIN:1573229725 Fingersmith]], her very Dickensian novel, and one that I adored. Affinity is even better.<br /><br />Margaret Prior is a young upper-class Victorian woman. Following her recovery from a suicide attempt, she engages in the \\"good work\\" of a prison visitor to the women's prison at Millbank. There, she is drawn to Selina Dawes, a medium who has been convicted of assault following a s&eacute;ance that ended with her mentor dead and a young woman traumatized.<br /><br />The book is told in two alternating stories: that of Selina, telling of the events leading to the fateful night, and that of Margaret, beginning as she starts her prison visits. Gradually, we learn a great deal about Margaret. Her father was a scholar of Renaissance art, she his amanuensis. Her intellectual leanings made her feel a bit out of place from the rest of her family, and her father's death hit her hard. The loss of the long longed-for trip to Italy is compounded by the fact that her about-to-be-married sister is to honeymoon there, and her socially conforming mother cannot provide the sympathy or empathy she needs.  All the more so because yet another loss cannot be spoken of.  How can she reveal that she and her brother's wife were once, it seems, more than friends?  Her inner thoughts, her psychology, unfold.<br /><br />Selina is not opened to us so much. Her story is more of action. \\"This is what happened, this is what I learned, this is what I did.\\" Not so much of \\"this is what I thought\\", \\"this is how I feel\\". Miss Selina Dawes, medium, becomes aware of her spiritualist powers, is taken up by the community and learns how to use those powers, becomes the proteg&eacute;e of the wealthy Mrs. Brink and ends up in prison.  Selina comes to us more through Margaret's reaction to her than through herself.<br /><br />Waters' descriptive abilities are extraordinary. Her limning of the physical and psychological constraints of Millbank prison are dead on. And this book contains what may be one of the creepiest passages of writing I have ever read. Margaret has gone to a spiritualist society, where she has seen moulds of human parts, including one which is supposed to be the hand of Dawes' spirit guide, Peter Quick. She imagines that hand coming to visit Selina in prison.  \\"It would be silent, dark and very still; the shelves of moulds, however, might not lie still. The wax might ripple. The lips upon the spirit-face might twitch, and the eyelids roll; the dimple upon the baby's arm would grow deeper as the arm unfolded -- so I saw it now, in Selina's cell, as I stepped form her and shuddered. The swollen fingers of Peter Quick's fist -- I saw, them, I saw them! -- were uncurling, and flexing. Now the hand was inching its way cross the shelf, the fingers drawing the palm over the wood. Now they were parting the cabinet doors -- they left smears upon the glass.\\"<br /><br />Note the name: Peter Quick. That's no accident. Affinity's ambivalence over the question of \\"ghosts or madness\\", its exploration of psychological control, of possession, of power relationships, owes a good deal to Henry James [[ASIN:1934648051 The Turn of the Screw]].<br /><br />This is a stunning novel.  And the end will rip you up.of the creepiest passages of writing I have ever read.

B000JQU1VS|3.0|I was expecting something great but was disappointed. After just finishing two other classics, Steinbeck's East of Eden and Lewis' Main Street, I thought I would continue in the classics mode. I am sure it was a great book in its time but if you are used to something like what I mentioned above, then it is not for you. If you are a young reader than I would highly recommend it. The stories are short and the language is not too difficult. The endings are somewhat predictable but maybe not for a younger reader.

Plot lines that went on for hundreds of pages were either lost or resolved in a paragraph or two.  The ending was terrible and anti-climatic.

B002KLAL4W|2.0|I have no idea what has happened to what was once a great band.  I've been a Pearl Jam fan since day one and while I'm not expecting them to continually release re-titled versions of Ten and Vs., this is not evolution by any means.  To be perfectly blunt, with the exception of Just Breath, the songs are boring and pointless. This song, however, belongs on an Eddie Vedder solo project, not a PJ album.  They either need to have a listen to Alice In Chains new album to get an idea of what 40-somethings are capable of or hang it up. I'd give it one star but I guess I'm a bit nostalgic...
B002T9H2L0|5.0|Based on the trailers for Inglorious Basterds, if you go into this movie expecting a Nazi slaughterfest with scene after scene of Nazi beatings and executions, you might walk away from the movie feeling grossly misled. Because Inglorious Basterds is way more than a slaughterfest. Don't get me wrong...oh, it has it's moments of slaughter, but what makes Inglorious Basterds such a great movie is the sophisticated stories and plotlines leading up to the more violent parts of the movie.<br /><br />First, a word on Writer/Director Quentin Tarantino's casting: superb! Look, I've heard the criticism that Brad Pitt is successful only because he's a pretty boy, and I have to ask: what the heck is that all about? Pitt is excellent in Inglorious Basterds. The guy can act. The way Pitt scrunches up his face in an annoyed look throughout the entire film and combines it with a no mercy attitude is believable and effective...it works. Really works. And the rest of the cast?...Amazing. Tarantino uses French actors to play the French and German Actors to play the Germans, and this just added an element of reality to a story that (unfortunately) was fictitious.<br /><br />And the guy who plays the head of Hitler's security deserves Hollywood's highest kudos at all of their self indulgent award shows. German Actor Christoph Waltz plays the evil, intelligent and diabolical Colonel Hans Landa, and when he walks into a scene you shudder. You will not soon forget Waltz's performance.<br /><br />Tarantino masterfully gets A+ performances out of his cast to tell the story of two plots to assassinate Nazi Germany's top leadership. The movie is devoted more to the development of these plotlines than it is to showing the development of the infamous reputation for murdering Nazi soldiers that Pitt and his band of brothers have. So as I said earlier, walk into Inglorious Basterds with your expectation set for a well-directed, intricate, often deep, storyline with some pretty violent moments and your expectations will be met.<br /><br />The climactic ending was a bit unbelievable. But overall, Inglorious Basterds is a great movie. Don't miss it.your expectations will be met.<br /><br />The climactic ending was a bit unbelievable.

0875428940|5.0|This is the best deck out there, I have tried many others but always come back to The Robin Wood Tarot. Love the devil card as it doesnt show a devil like most decks but the struggle with being chained to things that hold us back and the Death card seems more about rebirth than most decks. The imigaes are really nice and feel comfortable. I`d give this deck a 20 if I could and everytime I do a reading for me or my family it is always right on the money. When I read I never let them tell me their question until after the reading that way they know it is the cards speaking and not me. And everytime I use this deck it is alwasy 100% correct as to the question.<br /><br />These cards are not just Masculine or Feminine, they are for anyone that truely understands what Tarot is about. You wont go wrong buying this wonderful deck, I know I sure love mine.

B0000793Z9|5.0|The album is 5 stars, the blu-ray 5.1 surround mix is 2 stars. Charlie Burchill and Ronald Prent unfortunately didn't do a good job taking advantage of the surround sound possibilities of this amazing record. Too often the songs are accentuating the stereo aspects of the recording and not taking advantage of the rear channels and front & back/left & right opportunities. It's almost as if they didn't know you can place instruments, vocals etc. between the front and rear channels and using the left/right channels make the instruments be in front of you while panning them left/right and front/back. There are endless possibilities. An example of a good use of surround sound can be found by listening to the Talking Heads DVD 5.1 surround mixes by Jerry Harrison on Remain In Light and Speaking In Tongues. Fantastic. Steven Wilson has done excellent surround sound mixes on King Crimson and XTC albums. He would do this album justice.what this classic record should sound like. The remastering is superb.  Why would you not use the UK remaster?  I even made a copy of this version to keep and show people how different they are.  Consider this a warning.

B002PEP4U0|5.0|I liked the story quite a bit.  It wasn't blow me away stuff and there did seem to be a bit of filler added to make the story book length but I really can't complain about it.  The guy is likable and I enjoyed the photographs included as well.<br /><br />Worth a read, for sure.

006176759X|2.0|The show was the book. I wouldn't waste your time reading it because i already saw everything that happened on the show. I thing i did like about it was the behind the scenes information. But that's about it
B001C4AFOY|4.0|Of course this is a movie and as such it cannot be expected to be totally accurate, but this comes fairly close.  The sets are outstanding, the costumes excellent, and the screen play well written to give you a real feel for the loving relationship between Albert and Victoria.  Although never addressed in the film, you understand why Albert remained \\"Prince Albert\\" and was never King, even though he was always a strong presence behind the scenes.  The movie gives you a glimpse of Victoria's life as a young girl, where she was sheltered even from the court in an attempt to manipulate her as sovereign.  It also shows her strength and independence that was to characterize her long reign as the Queen of England.  Perhaps the best part of the movie is that it gives some insight into the private life of Albert.  It shows that while he was not as sheltered as Victoria he was equally controlled by others.  The screen play shows this control as the initial meetings between Victoria and Albert are carefully scripted and watched by others with their own agendas.  But it quickly becomes clear that neither Victoria nor Albert are willing to go along with the plans others have made and from that moment they truly begin to love each other and form a united front against those who want to manipulate them.  I really enjoyed this film and particularly liked the view it gave of both Albert and Victoria as people who loved each other while still ruling a country.  The movie doesn't go beyond the initial few years of their marriage which is good because it allows the screen play to show them as people before they became burdened with their responsibiities and positions.  A very good movie.

B000002QWD|3.0|When purchasing this product, I was under the impression that it was a record. I was trying to give my mom some records to use in our new record player. When receiving the CD I was disappointed. It might have been a flaw on my part and just not reading correctly or in enough detail, but had searched for Vinyl records and ended up with a CD. However, the CD was in great condition and is nice to have.
B0029LHW4U|5.0|I heard \\"Check my Brain\\" on the radio and said to myself, \\"damn!, that band sounds exactly like Alice in Chains, wow! but that can't be, Lane died almost 10 years ago...probably just an old b-side that they unearthed for some new AIC Rarities & B-sides CD\\".   Not the case.  Came to realize it was new material by the band.  New singer sounds just like Lane.  Bought the CD was blown away.  Solid CD, great to see them back in action.  There are at least 4 or 5 rock solid AIC songs on there the other 4 or 5 are better than average.  All together excellent CD.  Always loved Lane's voice, thought it made the band.  Not sure if the new lead singer was picked because he sounds so close to Lane's voice, doesn't matter, the guy can sing.  If you were a fan of the old, you'll dig it.  Kudos on keeping the band going!  Good Luck!
0316017922|5.0|What an utterly fascinating book.  As an educator, I found it promising to read that to learn things it takes time and effort.  That kids in China are spending considerably more time on a math problem than they do in the US (and it is because they know how to spend time on something to make it right...like rice farming) is amazing.      No matter who you are though, this book will pertain to you.  Great, great book.
B001L1S1SK|5.0|I never thought I would've actually enjoyed a show about a young woman trying to make it at a fashion magazine.<br /><br />But in the end, this show isn't really so much about the where as it is about the how and why of the characters who all make it happen.<br /><br />Sure, the acting is top notch.  And of course, the writing is spot on.  But the actors themselves seem to take the material even further with their pitch perfect delivery.<br /><br />For my part, this season did something I had thought impossible by making the show even better.<br /><br />Losing Daniel's Dad last season was a definate plus.  That guy had all the comic appeal of a Bond villain.<br /><br />But more than that, maybe it even has something to do with returning the show to New York, it's gained a certain verite by returning its characters to more realistic (or perhaps better, less unrealistic) story lines.<br /><br />Seasons 1 and 2 were great but amazingly enough season 3 is even better.<br /><br />As an interesting aside, this show is one of many recent examples where the inspiration for a popular US television program has come from abroad like HBO's In Treatment which was inspired by an Israeli television program dealing with the same issues and The Office of course based on a British program of the same name.  In the case of Ugly Betty, the inspiration came from a Mexican program of course called Betty Le Fea.<br /><br />In this way, not only the United States but its television programming as well has become a melting pot of sorts.
0385504225|3.0|Honestly, I think Dan Brown's best book was \\"Angels and Demons\\". Note the word \\"book\\" not movie. But some of his critics are too harsh. Yes arguably the ending of \\"The Lost Symbol\\" was anticlimatic, but I think it was appropriate. And as for the \\"Da Vinci Code\\", no author will ever have his protagonist find the Holy Grail because then you would have to describe it etc.     A good read though if you like well-paced plots (and a more satisfying ending) would be debut author Megan Webster's novel which just came out on Amazon I think about a month ago. It's called \\"Mightier than the Sword\\" and I highly recommend it.
B002XTBE6K|1.0|Romola Garai as Emma Woodhouse bugs her eyes out no less than several dozen times in four hours; you may depend upon it.<br /><br />This version contains a plenitude of eye rolling, eye bugging, smirking, shrieking, giggling, slouching, and slang.<br /><br />It also contains no subtlety, whatsoever. It spells out every implication of every plot and character shift out loud, in bland, modern English, as if the best they expect from the audience is for them to keep the drool wiped off their chins.<br /><br />It lacks Jane Austen's dialogue (nearly 75% of the script is new or altered), wit, and charm.<br /><br />Mr. Knightly, Miss Bates, Mr. Woodhouse, and Harriet were all fine enough.<br /><br />Jane Fairfax and Mrs. Weston were insipid dopes with two expressions a piece in their pockets.<br /><br />Frank Churchill is so wretched that when this Emma hoots and delights, preening like a glittery peacock at his flattery, it is clear she is a woman who could never be worthy of Mr. Knightly. It is the first Emma where I actually hoped against all odds that he might end up with Harriet.<br /><br />Badly done, indeed.
B000V1Y43W|4.0|I loved this movie when it came out. Had purchased a copy when it went on DVD, watched it many times, with the family, until it started to freeze up too many times. Now on blue ray, not only still a cute movie, awesome graphics.
0307454541|5.0|This book did not seem too interesting to me in the beginning but once I was past chapter 1, I was totally into it. The author started describing the lives of two different characters and I couldn't wait to see what can possibly bring them together.
B000ZECQ08|4.0|The product is exactly as written.  The movie itself deviates significantly from the book but maintains the same general feel of teen romance.  The darker side is downplayed in the first hour and a half but comes back in the last 45 minutes.  A must for any Potter fan and a solid contender for any who like the Fantasy genre.
1563898586|4.0|League of Extroadinary Gentlemen, although not my favorite, was good old Alan Moore fun.  I rank it below Watchmen, but definately above V for Vendetta.  It has great pacing and dialogue, which kept me reading through all the unfamiliarities.  I haven't been a big fan of victorian novels, but I managed to \\"get into it\\" for this read.  After watching the film and then reading the comic, I have to say the book is SOOOOO much better.  It's brilliant in comparison, and I'm sad to see the film do so much injustice.  One thing that didn't translate was the perfect role played by the female of our heroes.  It was refreshing to see such an intelligent and contributing woman in the League.  A lot of stories fail to involve a girl in the adventure and they are limited to being a damsel in distress or the polar opposite, the She-Hulk.  I was very impressed to see Ms. Murray as one of the more likeable heroes, through her iron wit and charm.<br /><br />But as I get along to the end of the book, I lose interest.  Alan Moore is in love with these characters in a way I cannot mimic.  So when I read the ending story which uses close to no images and long columns of text, I got a little quick to turn the pages.  As a comic, The League of Extrodinary Gentlemen is fun and clever, but not all the way entertaining and gripping.  I give it a B+
142313494X|3.0|Even though the book is most likely targeted towards 10-12 year olds, it lacks adventure by even that standard.  The situations the hero encounters are mostly modern reinterpretations of those found in the Greek myths, with nothing really new or clever.  Potentially suspenseful scenarios are resolved in just a paragraph or two, without any buildup of tension; the reader never really feels the characters are in any danger.    The book seems intended to replicate the successful structure of the Harry Potter books...a young misfit grows up with mortals only to find that that there is another whole world living side-by-side with the mortal realm where he is endowed with powers.  There is a summer camp that equates to Hogwarts where the hero will return every summer; presumably we will have one book for each summer, much as we had one Potter book for every school year.  Unfortunately, this book doesn't provide the characters with the well-defined personalities that the Potter books do, nor does the culture of the Greek gods exude anywhere close to the charm of the Potter universe.  I just don't find myself caring about the main characters or the fate of their world.      Let's hope the movie is more exciting.
0810983915|5.0|Great book for 2-4 graders, they find it very funny. Perfect to encourage reading for fun!!!
B002H3F7F6|5.0|Sting is a true musical genius.  This CD combines material from the Middle Ages and the Renaissance   with his own newly composed pieces. You can feel the chill of a cold winter's night in Northern  England, but the music brings warmth.  Brilliant!
B0000508U6|5.0|I ordered this CD because I had purchased it a few years ago and misplaced it. When I received it, it was in excellent condition! I'm really enjoying it.
0882709194|5.0|The arguments in the forward by Ray Comfort (which seems to be what everyone is commenting on) are very well laid out. They use logic, reason, and science to illustrate a point just like Darwin used logic, reason, and science to illustrate his point. The forward simply states the facts as science currently concludes and compares them to what Darwin concluded. The illustrations and conclusions made in the forward are very helpful in examining the Evolutionary Theory for its scientific correctness.
B000A2RRF4|1.0|This DVD couldn't possibly have been an original. It must have been copied. It kept skipping. It was terrible.
B000ZELISO|1.0|I never read the Harry Potter books but have always enjoyed the adaptations created. Micheal Gambon did a poor job as Dumbledor (hope I spelled that right). The film dragged on forever. This film seemed to lose it way. The characters which always leap out just wimpered away. There was so many instances where the plot could have delved a little deeper. I was truly disappointed.
B0007RT9LW|4.0|[[ASIN:B00004Z4WR Gone in 60 Seconds]]Excellent movie, but I like action adventure movies. Would recomend it to anyone who likes Nicolas Cage and Angelina Jolie.

B002ODEJYE|5.0|Both the Blu-Ray and P!nk's performance are amazing.  Listening to her music in Dolby TrueHD is nothing short of spectacular.  The costumes are a 1080p visual feast for the eyes.    The performance of her own music is excellent as always, and her renditions of other musician's works are truly awesome.  She sang \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\" in a way that would make Freddie Mercury proud.  Even her version of \\"I Touch Myself\\" was terrific.     The aerial work added a great visual experience to the show, and her band and dancers are great.    If you like P!nk and have the equipment to play this disc it is a must-have.  You will not be disappointed.  Just be sure to CRANK IT AS LOUD AS YOU CAN, and come on in to the Funhouse!
0143038419|5.0|The book is really fantastic, and it came in brand new condition. I would highly recommend it.
0061703257|4.0|Lehane is a fantastic writer of thrillers. All of his writing has an intense quality that keeps you on the edge of your seat with the pervasive sense that something terrible could happen at any time. This book, probably more than any of his other books, is laced with that paranoia. And although it starts off as a crime story, it's really further down the spectrum toward psychological thriller, borderline gothic horror at some points. Somewhere close to Silence of the Lambs, perhaps.<br /><br />The book opens in 1954, with two U.S. Marshalls taking a ferry out to Shutter Island, the location of Ashecliffe Hospital, a mental hospital for the criminally insane in Boston Harbor, to investigate the escape of a patient. The whole story is told from the point of view of Teddy, one of the Marshalls, as he delves deeper and deeper into the dark secrets of the island and the even darker mysteries of his own psyche. The twists and turns of the plot, at which Lehane is a master, are what make the story so interesting, so I won't give any away here.<br /><br />Lehane's writing is as good as it always is, though the characters felt a little more stock than normal. While incredibly creepy, I didn't connect with them as much as I did in his past stories. And perhaps because much of the book deals with the inner workings of the mind, I found pieces of it pushing the bounds of believability. Worth the read, although not Lehane's best.
B0001I562I|5.0|I remember this movie from when I was a kid.  It is absolutely timeless, my 7 year old daughter loved it just as much as I did.  Highly recommend it for your collection if you have children.
0783225849|5.0|outstanding! saw this movie when it first came out and you had to be seated before the movie started. the production specifics interesting, ingenious considering the era it was produced in. my friend said she saw it recently on TV (on demand) but watched my copy from Amazon and enjoyed it. The great classic from and in the style of the great Alfred Hitchcock from the mid 1950's. was supposed to be a quick and low budget film and it became a 'must see' classic. definitely a keeper.
B000MNP2KI|3.0|I prefer Brosnan playing Bond. I think he's a much better actor than Craig. This movie is decent with lots of action and running. Not as good as the other Bond movies but you won't fall to sleep with this.
142313494X|3.0|This has so many similarities to Harry Potter, I'm surprised there hasn't been a lawsuit.
B001OQCV24|5.0|Seen the movie, it definitely deserves a 5-star. I agree with the other reviewers and can't wait for the bluray!
B002KQ6BT6|1.0|The letdown I experienced at the end of The Da Vinci Code was bad enough; the anticlimax in The Lost Symbol was an embarrassment.  After hearing breathless warnings through most of the book of the potential destruction of civilization as we know it, of how the guardians must sacrifice their lives rather than let the Symbol fall into the wrong hands, we finally learn that the answer is trivial - even silly. Brown needs to learn that before you write the book you need to be certain that the story line tracks in a convincing and satisfying way, or you risk angering the reader for having been suckered into wasting their time with the book at all. I won't make this mistake with Brown again.
0061914177|5.0|I remember the first time I watched a Gary Vee video - his website had been hacked and he was explaining what happened and how he was resolving it and his character and passion just jumped off the screen.    That same character comes through right off the page in Crush It! as well. This book is not for those who are afraid of change. What Gary presents is a roadmap to understanding yourself, tapping in on your passion and building a brand around yourself to get the job done.    While the book is aimed at the entrepreneur, there's a lot of takeaway for big and small businesses alike. The 13 step plan he highlights in the book can be applicable to anyone but one thing he emphasises is that while monetary cost may be low, this is going to require a heck of a lot of hours. \\"Just Do It\\" isn't a strategy that's going to work here unless you're prepared to put in those hours.    Crush It! is as much about knowing yourself as knowing your audience. Gary Vee makes you think hard about what you think your \\"passion\\" is, whether you're an audio, visual or text person and what medium is best for you and if you're really going to make it work.    At the end of the day, what Gary Vee encourages is building your personal brand first (not pushing your product in front of people's face!) and letting that passion energise your audience, grab their attention which then you can monetise later. If you're willing to do this, for free - it can pay back big time later.    Who should read this book?    If I had to pass this book to someone, I'd pass it to someone still in school or a fresh grad. Never before has having a personal brand and standing for something been so important. Maybe it'll work against you in some cases - but when you connect with the people who are genuinely interested in you for who you are and what you stand for, you'll be Crushing It.    [...]
B002RSDW80|5.0|This was a great story line and a really funny movie to watch. It gave a lot of background history on Julia Childs that we never knew and the scenes of her cooking show were great! It is a movie that the whole family can enjoy. Would highly recommend it to all. A welcome chance from the bang, bang, shootem up shows.Fast moving and never a dull moment. Julia's challenges to make it through the cookbook are entertaining and really funny. Some of the scenes will have you rolling in the aisles. This is a fun movie to watch and share with friends.

B0025KVLU6|5.0|Okay, say you're the Beatles. It's 1968. You've gradually matured and grown over the last five years with your music, going from the charming, boy-meets-girl pop of \\"Please Please Me\\" and \\"A Hard Days Night\\" to the brilliant, groundbreaking psychedelic pop of \\"Sgt Pepper\\" and \\"Magical Mystery Tour.\\" What do you do next? Simple: you do something *totally* different. The Fab Four's 1968 release, \\"The Beatles,\\" or \\"The White Album\\" as everybody calls it (even the Beatles themselves call it \\"The White Album\\"), was a completely different animal from anything the band had done before. This was a sprawling double album of raw-sounding, down-to-earth songs with no traces of psychedelia anywhere, all the way down to the album's plain white cover. Being a double album also allowed George Harrison the luxury of being able to contribute more songs to the party alongside all the great nuggets by John Lennon and Paul McCartney. Heck, even Ringo Starr wrote a tune for it. This was also the point in time where the Beatles were just starting to splinter, with Lennon's new love Yoko Ono never leaving his side, not even in the recording studio, much to the other Beatles' dismay. But even so, the Fab Four delivered a brilliant album, so diverse in it's collection of songs. You've got your great rockers like \\"Back In The USSR,\\" \\"Birthday,\\" \\"Yer Blues\\" and \\"Helter Skelter,\\" alongside gorgeous tunes like \\"Blackbird,\\" \\"Julia,\\" \\"Mother Natures Son,\\" \\"Dear Prudence,\\" and Harrison's signature \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps.\\" Want lighthearted humor? That's here too: \\"Rocky Racoon,\\" \\"The Continuing Adventures Of Bungalow Bill,\\" the 1920's-ish \\"Honey Pie,\\" and Starr's contribution \\"Don't Pass Me By.\\" There's also room for a brave studio experiment from Lennon with \\"Revolution 9,\\" a lengthy sound collage put together by Lennon (with Lennon and Harrison making vocal cameos throughout) that will either enrapture or befuddle the listener, but that I've always personally enjoyed, simply because it'sso weird. It's hard to believe that this is the same band that did \\"Love Me Do\\" five years prior, but, by gum, it is. Now THAT'S musical progression. The Beatles \\"White Album\\" is a treasure-trove of musical styles and substances, and the Beatles, at least musically-speaking, were still very much at the top of their supremely brilliant game.

B000E6UK5K|5.0|First off, I am a big Pink Floyd fan. While this is not a new floyd album, it definitely has the soul of floyd in there.  This album has some of the most soulful and emotional music Gilmour has to offer.  At first I thought it was good, but after a couple of listens it becomes absolutely great. Gilmour is one of the greatest song writers and guitar players that has graced the genre of classic rock.

B002KQ6BT6|4.0|Being a huge Dan Brown fan, I couldn't wait to get my hands on this one.  The story follows Prof. Robert Langdon who once again finds himself entwined in a deadly game of solving ancient puzzles and riddles in order to stop a madman and protect as well as reveal a powerful and mystic secret.      Much of The Lost Symbol focuses on Freemasonry and ancient mysticism and anyone interested in either of those things, or in early American history will enjoy the attention to detail and thorough research that was obviously undertaken.      Once past the first fifty or so pages, the pace of the read becomes exhausting.  Brown does a great job keeping you turning pages by dangling a carrot in front of you at the end of each short chapter.  The biggest issue I had with the book is that it creates a lot of promise and anticipation, but never really follows through.  I felt like the last 20-30 pages of the book really fell flat. It was a bit of a disappointment.     I did enjoy reading this book and continue to be a Dan Brown fan.  I just hope the next book doesn't build up a lot of anticipation that it can't deliver on.
B002T9H2LA|5.0|Quentin Tarantino continues to direct current stars along with unknowns to achieve another masterpiece. From Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs to Grindhouse, Tarantino has outdone himself this time around. Brad Pitt plays an outstanding character and a Tennessee accent to make this movie excel. Another great film for your library. See you @ the Oscars.

0740785508|5.0|This book was truly inspiring! The book isn't a beginners drawing book, but rather starts by assuming the reader can already draw from life. It then proceeds to show how you can go from there to designing paintings of things that don't exist. It shows many techniques for achieving this, like building models from clay or maquettes. The number of subjects are too many to mention here. There is no second book like it!

B000KX0IOK|5.0|I read some reviewers criticize this movie for being unrealistic. Well, I don't know what to say except they never have been teaching in the inner city. The alcoholic professor is as much a stereotype as the substance abusing teacher. They bring baggage to the job of \\"teaching.\\" Here, Gosling is absolutely remarkable in his performance as a powder then crack cocaine user who is also a brilliant teacher. His connection to his kids unrealistic? Let me tell you it is his style of teaching that gets through to them. Throughout the film you will see his kids reciting parts of black history that he has taught them, despite thefact that his  principal is upset that he is not on a certain page in the lesson plan. Lord, you who are teachers like I am know how brilliantly true this is! Dunn is a creative, committed teacher who finds remarkable ways to reach his students. One wonderful scene has him trying to explain to a couple of coke ho's why he teaches: one girl says, o so if you get through to one, you get through to all, huh? Gosling's expression is priceless (btw, he is one heck of an actor). No, he murmurs, if you get through to one .... (you have reached one). In his dialogue, however, he never finishes the line.  The backdrop of his family life explains a lot, as does Dre's. And I think this is what ultimately draws them to each other; not that they know about each other's past/present, but they sense they have a kinship. The lovely reciprocal-caretaker theme also suggests they are kindred spirits.  There is no lack of resolution at the end. The scene IS the resolution. Dre has just persuaded Dunn to clean up his room and his personal hygiene. \\"You missed a spot,\\" she tells him. Then sitting down on opposite ends of the sofa, they smile shyly at one another, acknowledging their bond. This is a terrific movie, another indie classic.
B000OPOAJS|5.0|This is, in my opinion, one of the all time best Espionage type action movies.  All the actors do a great job.  Awesome car chase scenes.  One of the all-time best.
B000LXHK2C|5.0|A good year should make you leave the room after the movie really thinking about what is important in your life.<br />Well, that was my take.<br />What is at the core of this romance is the love between money, childhood dreams, a woman, and a place that one can only imagine is the furthest place from the day to day reality of a stress flung, heartless, inconsiderate lifestyle.<br /><br />Perhaps this drastic description would place you in the defensive mode if you were on the edge of \\"to buy or not to buy\\" however if you would like to place yourself in a realignment mode in your life for a couple of hours, this might serve the purpose.<br /><br />The light hearted nature of the movie will certainly take you away from the Russell Crowe you know as the Gladiator tough guy.<br /><br />I think this movie is a very clever combination of wit, real life heart issues, and what we all need to see once in a while to stir the inner desires of an ultimate personal goal.<br /><br />If you are trying to impress your female companion with a good pick of a movie for date night, she won't be dissapointed. Just don't let on that you enjoyed it too. Perhaps if you work in a very high stress situation with focus on buy, sell, and trample, it will bring you to the office the next day in a different mood.<br /><br />So drop the defenses and enjoy.<br />This is my second time watching the film and now i own it.<br />I will make it a point to watch it at least a couple times a year.
B000XA5K4I|5.0|I love this movie.  Its definitly one of the best cheesy action flicks.  If you are expecting a serious action movie, your watching the wrong movie.  This is for great laughs.

1439153663|5.0|Author Kathleen Grissom brings us a gripping tale of the South during the days of slavery. The story is told from two different perspectives: Belle, the mulatto daughter of plantation owner Captain Pyke, and Lavinia, a white girl from Ireland who is sent to work in the \\"kitchen house\\" with Belle and other \\"nigras.\\"    Belle, whose mother was a slave, was born on the plantation. Lavinia is an indentured servant whose parents came from Ireland on a boat owned by Captain Pyke. Both her parents die on the voyage, but she and her brother, Campbell, survive. While Campbell is sent to be a servant in another city, Lavinia goes to live on Pyke's plantation.    Lavinia is only seven years old when her parents pass away. The experience is so traumatic that, for several months, she has no memory of the event. She is cared for partly by Belle and partly by Mama Mae, a black slave who is in charge of the female slaves. Even though Lavinia is white skinned, she develops a deep bond with the blacks on the plantation, going so far as to call them \\"her family.\\"    Captain Pyke is a busy merchant and spends much of his time away from home. He leaves the plantation in charge of his weak, sickly wife, Martha, and Mr. Rankin, the overseer who is hungry for power. When the Pykes' youngest daughter, Sally, dies, Martha is overcome with grief and turns to laudanum for comfort. Mr. Rankin sees this as an opportunity to run the place the way he sees fit, which is to say that he makes life miserable for everybody. Add in Mr. Waters, the male tutor who abuses the plantation owner's son, Marshall, and you have a recipe for disaster.    Lavinia is only 11 years old when she meets Will Stephens, who is employed by the Captain. Although they are many years apart in age, Lavinia has a major crush on this much older man, and as she grows older, she realizes she loves him. Will falls in love with her, too, though she doesn't know it. Through a chain of miscommunications, they never have the chance todeclare their love for each other until it is too late.    Just before her 13th birthday, Captain Pyke dies. Lavinia is sent away from the plantation to live with Martha's sister, Sarah, and her husband in Williamsburg. For the most part, she is happy there, but she longs to go \\"back home\\" to Tall Oaks. She achieves her desires when she marries Marshall Pyke and becomes the mistress of the plantation. Unfortunately, her dreams for a peaceful life in her childhood \\"home\\" are shattered when the truth of her husband's drunkenness and marital infidelities are revealed. She is also faced with the reality of the clearly drawn line on the plantation between the whites and the blacks. As the new mistress, she is no longer permitted to call the slaves her family; they are simply her slaves now.    Kathleen Grissom's first novel explores the well-known side of the dark world of slavery as well as the not-so-well-known world of white slavery, or indentured servitude. The book is written in a manner that is fast paced and action packed, making it difficult to put down. Grissom is currently working on her second novel, and I'm sure it will be just as successful as her debut.       --- Reviewed by Christine M. Irvin
0810983915|5.0|I wish they had more books just like this one, because nothing gets my 2 sons (age 9 and 11) reading more than Wimpy Kid books.  They LOVE them!  My 11 year old who normally hates to read, read the whole book in one sitting.  My dyslexic 9 year old read it in 2 day and scored perfectly on the comprehension test at school.  They adore Wimpy Kid, and I adore it when they are reading.
B00009W0U4|2.0|....if it weren't for the fact that you don't care a thing about any of the characters.  All three are lifeless and 1 dimensional.  There's your steretypical animal like character, your stereotypical character that overthinks things, and a female who represents a balance of the two.<br /><br />If the movie had started from the end and gone back to the beginning, then you would see it as a rape revenge piece.  But the way the movie was shot you're thrown right into the action, great.  But there's a lot of confusing dialogue throwing you off as to what's going on.  The depiction of homosexuals in these scenes is that they're just a bunch of perverted monkeys looking to hump each other at all times.  Then as you go back through the story, the action is less and less until finally there are entire scenes of filler between the three characters.<br /><br />I was looking forward to a good artistic piece, and so many people had raved about it, I thought I'd try.  Then again, some people get excited by watching some really brutal scenes of rape and murder.  (The rape scene is over 10 minutes long, and the murder scene is a painful 2 minutes.)  These scenes are shocking, make no mistake.  But the film just seems to fall flat, and so do the characters.

0307269981|5.0|A terrific continuation of The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo.  Stieg Larsson continues to provide a page turning saga of Lisbeth, an amazing lady with plenty of issues.  Larsson again drew me into her character and kept me reading late into the night.  Larsson's characters are not the beautiful, fantastic people of other authors but they all have flaws and none more serious that the female lead, Lisbeth.  However, Larsson had me cheering for her throughout the book.  His style is fresh and the story never lags.  I am impatiently waiting for the next in the series, The Girl Who Kicked the Hornets' Nest, to be released in the US.  I know that Larsson planned a ten book series for his heroine but sadly, after the third book he passed away.  None the less, I highly recommend the first two in the series to anyone who enjoys mystery and action and I am sure that the third book will not disappoint.
B000ZECQ08|5.0|I love this installment of the Potter series! Very action packed, with a twist at the end that I truly did not expect!
B002T9H2MO|5.0|What a strange and beautiful movie.  I really enjoyed this movie.  This movie is not for a non-thinker.  This movie will confuse and annoy some, but for others it will be a real treat.   I was over-joyed by the end of this movie which is touching but not in a mainstream way.  The movie played out like a symphony of gorgeous music.  I would recomend this movie to anyone with a brain and a heart.

B0026P3G12|5.0|I just had to buy this and I was not disappointed.  In fact, it's even better than I had expected it to be.  Susan sings some lovely songs, with her clear, sweet voice.  Every song is a delight, the clarity of sound is really good, and the phrasing and back-up musicians add depth to her presentation.  I liked her choice of songs - everything from the Mick Jagger/Keith Richards song \\"Wild Horses\\" (a beautiful rendition, the best I've heard), to \\"Cry Me a River\\", and including \\"Amazing Grace\\" and her signature tune, \\"I Dreamed a Dream.\\"  This CD is bound to go platinum and I highly recommend it to everyone.  We all remember when she was such a sensation on Britain's Got Talent last year, and I've been looking forward to her album ever since.  She has risen above being a Scottish novelty to a professional singer in her own right.

B000MRAAJM|5.0|We just got a new LCD HDTV and Bluray player and wanted something great to watch on it, besides movies.  This did the job, was great viewing and very educational in the process. Some mind-boggling scenes are in this series and I keep asking myself, \\"where was the photographer\\" when this was filmed, especially during some of the animal scenes.  How they filmed some of this still amazes me.  There are some slow-motions scenes that let you see how some things really happened when it happened so fast.   Our grown children and grandchildren have also enjoyed watching some of this with us.  If you like National Geographic or some of the Discovery nature programs, you will probably love this!  It's a LOT of great filming of a beautiful and fascinating world!

0790731509|5.0|Paul Newman stars as eccentric war veteran, Lucas Jackson. Luke lives in a tiny southern town. And he gets himself sentenced to a chain-gang, after he gets drunk and destroys some parking meters one night.    The chain-gang camp, is run by a seemingly fatherly, yet ruthless Warden, called the Captain. Luke and his fellow inmates, are forced to perform back-breaking chain-gang duty, in the scorching southern heat every day. Under the directive of the Captain, brutal punishment is meted out by the prison guards, to any inmate who disobeys the stringent prison rules.    Luke, rebellious soul that he is, refuses to knuckle-under to the sadistic guards. Luke's steely determination, wins him the reverent admiration of the other inmates. After two failed escape attempts, Luke is subjected to vicious torture, by the guards. The Captain, with the help of the monstrous guards, makes it his mission to break Luke's spirit.    Paul Newman is amazing in his role as Luke. I couldn't imagine any other actor portraying the character of Luke, as deftly as Newman did. George Kennedy plays Luke's burly inmate pal, Dragline, with consummate skill. Jo Van Fleet, gives a wonderfully poignant performance, as Luke's dying mother, Arleta. And Strother Martin, conveys the obsessive resolve of the Captain character, with a frightening intensity.    Other members of the supporting cast shine too. Dennis Hopper, Lou Antonio, Ralph Waite, and Harry Dean Stanton, all give moving performances as prison inmates. Bob Woodward gives a hideously chilling quality, to his mute, blind, sharpshooter road-boss character.    In summation, Cool Hand Luke will always remain a classic of American cinema, for generations to come.
B002VJ0576|1.0|How \\"off\\" can a production get from a target?  Well, if you're making this Sherlock Holmes film, I guess that we were lucky they spelled \\"Sherlock Holmes\\" correctly...<br /><br />I actually WANTED to like this movie.  I bought it sight unseen and without even any description of the movie (Amazon didn't provide one).  I'm a Holmes fan and can find things to like about most productions.  I thought that the opening sequence (Watson during the Blitz in the 1940s about to relate an untold Sherlock Holmes tale) was done well and set the tone perfectly.<br /><br />But then it went downhill.  Fast.<br /><br />You have a Sherlock Holmes who is...well, MOUSEY.  He certainly doesn't fit any idea that I've ever had for the character.  Holmes wasn't the vibrant soul pushed to solve crimes that you might expect.  The screenplay take all sorts of liberties with the Sherlockian history giving Holmes a different brother - a policeman who was paralyzed by a bullet to the back while breaking up a bank robbery with Lestrade as his partner, and (spoiler alert) Sherlock isn't Holmes' real name because who would pay attention to a detective named \\"Robert?\\"  There is even a hint that it was Watson who started Holmes on the path to cocaine addiction.<br /><br />The acting was fairly wooden, and the script plodding.  That only made the pain last longer.<br /><br />If there was one bright spot, it was the characterization of Watson.  Well done.<br /><br />All in all, it wasn't worth the watching.  Something better just forgotten and move on.  Don't buy this.  If you feel the need, just rent it.  Save your money for pretty much ANY other Holmes movie.

B002GY9F9K|2.0|I'm a big fan of Goodkind's Sword of Truth series... in fact, I am rereading the first 7 in order to finish the series itself in one lengthy read. I had high hopes for this adaptation but unfortunately, I doubt I will continue watching this. At least for the time being. Maybe once I'm sufficiently removed from the story arc will I be able to enjoy this. As it is now, I am having a very hard time watching events \\"almost\\" play out according to the book then to be completely and utterly ignored, or drastically changed. Some major plot points... the Mud People, Sisters of the Light, the Mord-Sith, and the Confessors themselves... characters central to the very essence of who Richard Cypher/The Seeker will become are grossly re-interpreted. I had to actually turn this show off for a bit when Kahlan sends the gifted Listener TO the Sisters of the Light. what!?!     Now, with that said, if I had been able to remove myself from trying to compare the two, and simply enjoy the show for what it is... it's a helluva lot of fun. Richard, Kahlan and Zedd are very well played as is most of the cast in this made-for-TV fantasy romp. The effects are decent, the dialog witty (if campy at times) and the acting on par with just about anything else on TV, certainly better than most in this genre. And Denna, almost...almost a perfect rendition from my minds-eye.    Bottom line? If you've never read the books this is well worth the RENT, or buy if priced right. Those that are fans of the books should have forgotten most of what they read FIRST or be prepared to be frustrated and seriously disappointed.
B000P0J0G0|5.0|No DVD collection of Hugh Laurie is complete without his first attempt at series TV.  The chemistry between Hugh Laurie and Stephen Fry is phenomenol.  Less controlled than their later Jeeves and Wooster and more varied.  Slapstick, cerebral, a fine complement to Monty Python for comedy.  These guys are comic genius in action.
0553124986|4.0|Three good points (and later three bad):<br /><br />1. The author did a good job of slowly building up the protagonists increased intelligence. Strangely enough, the poor spelling and grammar made the reader slow down at the early stages of the book and it was those that actually had more of an impact than later stages of the books.<br /><br />2. The protagonist's scaring away women with his intellect is something with which I can sympathize. That much was believable.<br /><br />3. The characterizations were very believable and the characters well developed.<br /><br />Three bad:<br /><br />1. The reading took longer than I would like to have invested in a fiction book. Two evenings. When taking a break from the non-fiction books that I normally read, I only like to spend one afternoon/ evening reading.<br /><br />2. The book was a bit wordy (even though it was only 210 pages). It could have been shortened by about 40 pages without much diminishment. I understand the author was trying to raise existential questions, but somehow that just came across as babbling.<br /><br />3. The author drove home his point about people with higher IQs having a generally hard time with social adjustment. The only thing is that it's not quite correct.  Is it really much better to be ignorant out of choice (=much of the general public) or ignorant with no choice (people with low IQs)?
B002UJIY7A|3.0|One of the higher-profile suspense thrillers of '09, The Perfect Getaway is an entertaining movie with a good premise, however the last half or so falls into the trap of clichés...not to mention a few random acts of \\"hokey\\"-ness.    Still, it overall is entertaining and at least attempts to make some original story and cutting methods and deserves a positive rating.  Viewers shouldn't expect much more than an hour and 45 of decent suspenseful entertainment, though.       This movie more-or-less met my expectations.  Fans of such movies like \\"Touristas\\" should like it (though this wasn't nearly as gory as \\"Touristas\\").   Ultimately I was expecting a nice ride that was entertaining, along with some decent acting and those characters that seem to come with this kind of movie....and this lived up to it!   Best line of the movie...   \\"I never watch the news...it's like, too informative.\\"
B00005JN2Z|4.0|What separates Michael Mann's \\"Collateral\\" from most other crime thrillers is that you actually have characters that you enjoy and, more importantly, understand. To see Tom Cruise as an ice-in-his-blood hitman, which is way more than casting against type, is something to behold. And Jamie Foxx as an unwilling accomplice is superb. And Los Angeles, as an unwilling third character, is hypnotic. (The scene where three coyotes cross a main L.A. drag is almost artsy, but extremely effective, as it questions the distinction [or lack thereof] between civilization and wilderness.)<br /><br />I agree with most reviewers that some of coincidences are farfetched, and that the ending is a little too much like other thrillers, especially \\"Speed\\". Still, the movie held my attention thanks to the peppery dialogue between Cruise and Foxx. What disappointed me, besides the logistical leaps in the plot, were the \\"gimmes\\". Michael Mann's commentary was surprisingly uninteresting and the \\"special\\" features weren't so special. However, this is movie is a high-water mark in thrillers and an exceptional character study worth owning.

When the show finally ended, I began reading Mr. Herriots entire collection of memoirs. All Creatures Great and Small is as satisfying in print as it was on television. Mr. Herriot's description of the farmers and town folk he encountered during his tenure as a country vet confirms that the every day stories of real people can be just as interesting and entertaining as fictional characters, when told by an expert story-teller.

B002C6K7N0|1.0|I am a huge metal fan, since early 80's with a wide range of tastes. I like everything from old school Exodus to Dying Fetus. Deicide, Slayer, Morbid Angel, Suffocation, etc. are some of my current favorites.  Anyways, as far as Megadeth goes, Peace Sells is my all-time favorite album. It, as well as Killing is my Business, are un-duplicatable masterpieces.  That's the Megadeth I have loved since I was a in jr. high.  Those albums gives me goosebumps to this day when I listen to them.  Endgame, however, is NOT anything like that.  In fact, I think it sucks a$$!  Where is the angry heavy a$$ heavy music that everyone is craving about in this album?  I haven't found it yet. I've heard the whole album 3 times now; hoping that like Rust in Piece, it would just take hearing it a few times through to love it.  Anyway, I'm VERY dissapointed.  If you are hoping to hear what everyone is raving about, hoping to hear a mere hint of Megadeth past, allow me to crush those hopes now.  I sometimes see Mustaine in a Japanese steak house where I live. If I see him again, I would be very tempted to provide him this feedback... but out of respect for his privacy, and to avoid getting a black eye, I'll just have to bite my tongue.    Now, on the flipside, I'm not saying this isn't a good album for someone that likes metal with more of a \\"rock\\" sound to it; but to put Megadeth's name on it is simply wrong.

B000JZWPW2|5.0|Midway through reading this book, which to me was very readable, I learned about the controversy that has surrounded it.  Simultaneously, I was also struck by how similar it was in some ways to the message of the movie, \\"Avatar\\".  If anything, Ms. Morgan is guilty of simply trying to make the story \\"too real\\" by couching it as though she actually did the walkabout and met real \\"Real People\\".  The unbridled success of \\"Avatar\\" shows that an openness to this type of message is broad-based, and Ms. Morgan's story predated that movie by long enough to have \\"scooped\\" it if she hadn't run afoul of the Aboriginal sticklers for accuracy.    If those Aboriginals who are so upset would look at the history they so fiercely defend, they might ask, what has their culture accomplished in their very long time in existence?  Has their culture given rise to a timeless spiritual holy tradition that lifts people up and will last for many generations to come?  Obviously they never reached the spiritual status of that small tribe that Ms. Morgan called the \\"Real People\\".  Oh, but they did raise an issue about their law that if men learn \\"women's business\\", or women learn \\"men's business\\", they should be put to death.  What incredible barbarism - and what gall that the real Aborigines should be so upset that someone portrayed them as having gotten way beyond such primitive customs.  I guess they are proud to be primitive!    After completing the book and studying the controversy surrounding it, I was disappointed to learn that the real Aborigines are, apparently, nothing like the ones portrayed in the book.  The ones in the book are so much more interesting and worthy of admiration, IMHO.

Most likely other reviews will summarize the plot- i'll just say - you need to see it- preferably, over and over again- to remind yourself that each of our lives are meaningful in this world- and we must continue to notice how important everyone is in our individual lives. That is what makes this film as great as it is.

B002RSDW80|5.0|This is a good movie to spend a rainy Sunday afternoon with a special person.  Ms. Streep is great portraying Julia Child and Stanley Tucci as usual is perfect in the role of Julia's husband. Amy Adams was not my favorite character in the film.  In fact when the scenes between Adams and her husband were on the screen, the movie tends to bog down.  Now I understand why the real Ms. Child would not contact the Adam's character. Still worth watching.
0670021652|1.0|I love Elizabeth Gilbert! I loved Eat, Pray, Love. I have no problem reading it over and over again. I was anticipating having the same love for Committed. I bought it in the Seattle airport on my way back to Alaska. I read it while I was waiting for my flight. I hated it!   As a self ascribed lover of all books dating and marriage related, I hated this book. The descriptions of Ms. Gilbert and Felipe's love affair was so much more detailed and vivid in Eat, Pray, Love. All of the descriptions in this book were terrible. How dare she criticize the immigration agent, when he was being kind and sympathetic. In case Ms. Gilbert did not realize(oh that's right because she was spending so much time jaunting around Asia), flying and immigration have changed throughout the world post 9-11.   She had to have an inkling of an idea considering that her intended was not a US citizen.   Rules are rules and they did not seem to be too terrible.  She has got to be the only woman I know who would not want to marry someone they loved.   I hated all of the historical tidbits about marriage. She should have just kept it a memoir. It would have been more enjoyable.

This book has quite a bit of the concept art used and brief interviews from different production crew members as to how certain pieces were used in the production process.<br /><br />Don't buy this book expecting a complete \\"making of\\" documentary because it is not. It simply details the very first stage of the film's production and the crucial step of an artist drawing his interpetation of the words in a script. In that sense, it succeeded.

0765356147|4.0|The Final Empire, the first volume of Brandon Sanderson's Mistborn trilogy kicked my ass (in a good way). A great blend of original ideas, charming characters a nicely self-contained story (no real cliffhangers to speak of), and good ol' fashioned '80's style fantasy. It brought me back to my roots, reminded me of when I first discovered the genre through the likes of Terry Brooks, Raymond E. Feist and R.A. Salvatore. Maybe not for everyone, in the age of Joe Abercrombies and Hal Duncans, but an accessible novel that left me wanting more.<br /><br />Sanderson followed that up with The Well of Ascension, which turned out to be a massive disappointment. Instead of delivering on the promises of the first novel, Sanderson left his characters at a stalemate, giving them time to evolve, sure, but grinding the plot and world development to a halt. Gone were most of the most interesting elements of The Final Empire (the forbidding Steel Inquisitors, most notably) and in their place were insipid, weak characters dealing with politics and love stories that I just didn't give a damn about. Elend, in particular, regressed from a confident paramour to a self-doubting child thrust into a position of rule. It felt false, and, even worse, pointless.<br /><br />So, home-run in his first at-bat, flaming strikeout in his second, how was Sanderson to fare with his third (and final) attempt? Let's call it a ground-rule-double. The Hero of Ages succeeds, but doesn't quite hit it out of the park like the first volume.<br /><br />Sanderson's an exhaustive outliner, so it's frustrating to wade through so much useless plot (the Siege of Luthadel in The Well of Ascension, the stale retread of bringing down a corrupt leader (two, actually) in The Hero of Ages) and self-indulgent character development at the cost of telling a fast, interesting story. It's somewhat fitting that Sanderson was chosen to finish Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time series, considering how strongly the Mistborn `trilogy' screams to be a duology. Sanderson is known for his breakneck endings (and Hero of Ages is no exception), but one has to wonder how the series could have succeeded if he had simply taken the plotting, action and revelations from the second and third volumes and worked it into one novel, cutting out all the fat that bloats down the first half of each.<br /><br />Still, Sanderson should be lauded for his endings, and his labyrinthine plotting. Once the revelations start rolling in, it's clear that Sanderson had things under control from the very beginning. Seemingly small elements from the early pages of The Final Empire fall into place and have cataclysmic effects on the outcome of the series. The final 200 pages of the novel fly by as Sanderson brings the series to a satisfying, shocking conclusion. And, hell, he leaves a body count of major players that would make even George R.R. Martin blush.<br /><br />Despite my grumblings about Sanderson spending so many of the early pages on philosophical/religious/political ramblings and theories, it was nice to see him using these to expand the roles of some of the minor characters from earlier in the series. We finally see Sazed come into his own, as he struggles with inner demons. Marsh continues to kick ass and treads the thin line between villain and saviour, with the reader never quite knowing which side he is truly on. And TenSoon gives a unique perspective of the events, as well as being a key to many of the series secrets. It may have been unnecessary, but that constant internal monologuing of all the Point-of-View characters certainly leaves the series with a strong, memorable cast of characters.<br /><br />Sanderson tries to avoid the dreaded infodump by doling out a lot of information and history through the `epigraphs' before each chapter. These short snippets of text (a sentence to a couple of paragraphs long) were always a highlight, something I was constantly eager to get to, for they held many secrets, but also seemed like a bit of a cop-out. He wanted to avoid infodumps in the text, but, you know... `A rose called by any other name is still a rose.'<br /><br />Sanderson's prose and dialogue continues along the same course set by the first two volumes. It's serviceable, and his description is never too much, but often feels mechanical and over-polished, like Sanderson's forcing the pieces together to make a point, rather than letting it all fall into place naturally. He also paints his characters with a rather modern brush, and it doesn't always work.<br /><br />In all, Hero of Ages is a marked improvement on The Well of Ascension, but can't quite live up to the promises made by The Final Empire. The plot twists are strong, the characters well-realized and the action is frenetic, but the politicking is wearying, the love stories are forced and the pacing is, at times, scattered and slow as watching grass grow. In an age where Fantasy series often fall off the tracks, hit double-digits in number of volumes and putter out towards the end, Sanderson manages to tie off a compelling story in only three volumes... it's just too bad he couldn't have done it in two.void infodumps in the text, but, you know... `A rose called by any other name is still a rose.'

B002KQ6BT6|3.0|Let's be honest - we're not looking for great works of literature when we read Dan Brown novels.  However, we do expect an engaging story with lots of interesting twists and surprises.  I really enjoyed Deception Point and Angels & Demons, and I found the DaVinci Code to be a bit of a letdown (mainly because it seems to be a novelized version of Holy Blood, Holy Grail; there is no question that it was the primary - and possibly only - source for the DaVinci Code.)  This novel reminds me of Angels & Demons; it gets off to a great start and it's very hard to put down.  Unfortunately, Brown's novels are becoming a little too formulaic (you can easily guess \\"who\\" Mal'akh is well before its revealed) for my taste.  I hope he does something entirely different with the next one.  The other major negative, as a lot of other reviewers have pointed out, is that the ending is a huge disappointment.  The novel does a terrific job of building up to something truly amazing, and at the end you kind of think, \\"Oh, that's it?\\"
0765350386|5.0|Back in December of 2007, Brandon Sanderson was just like every other new-to-the-scene author, just trying to make his way as a young author of Fantasy novels. He had a few published novels under his belt (and a whole slew more hidden in the deep corners of his house), had been getting good critical acclaim and decent sales, but was far from a household name. Things were looking up for Sanderson, but no one had any idea of just how high he would climb. Then came the announcement: Brandon Sanderson was chosen to complete the late Robert Jordan's legendary Wheel of Time series.<br /><br />Since then, Sanderson's stock has risen to meteoric heights. His own novels have been released to strong critical acclaim and he's landed himself on the New York Times Bestseller list. Wheel of Time fans wait with bated breath for the fall release of The Gathering Storm, eager and/or reluctant to see whether Sanderson is able to do justice to their favourite work. As someone who will not be reading The Gathering Storm when it arrives, I was nonetheless curious to see what all the fuss was about. I had dipped my toe in his work before (a half-finished copy of Elantris still sits on my bookshelf), and being on the hunt for some meaty Fantasy, I picked up The Final Empire, the first volume of his Mistborn trilogy.<br /><br />Though not free of cliche, it's clear from the get-go that Sanderson wants to put his own spin on the typical Fantasy story, to make a point that we haven't necessarily seen it all. Yeah, at its heart, The Final Empire is about bringing down the oppressive Lord Ruler, but it's the details that count, and Sanderson's details are tight. The big hook is that Sanderson's Dark Lord is not a faceless demon, hellbent of taking over the world, rather he already controls it, and has for 1,000 years (natch). Even more interesting is the fact that Sanderson's Dark Lord, before he came to rule... was once the Hero of Ages, prophecised to defeat a mysterious force called The Deepness, and save the world. Something, however, went very wrong.<br /><br />Praise has been heaped upon Sanderson because of his deep, thoughtful systems of magic, and The Final Empire is ample evidence as to why. Allomancy - which involves ingesting and then `burning' particular metals to unleash their power - shows a level of thought and real-world practicality that few other authors can claim. Most importantly, it has a very direct effect on the plot and conflict of the novel. It's no simple special effects show, but rather a integral part of who the characters are and how the economy of the world operates. My biggest regret (and something I hope will be addressed in later volumes) is that Sanderson didn't get more philosophical about the (no doubt) addictive qualities of what amounts to a drug that grants super-human strength, washes away weariness, enhances every sense and even allows the user to manipulate the emotions of those around them. Even Terry Brooks was addressing the ideas of addictive magic, over 20 years ago, and it seemed like a missed opportunity on Sanderson's part.<br /><br />Which brings me around to one of the general inconsistencies of the novel. Sanderson's prose is safe and easy, but fails to capture the ruthlessness that one might expect from an ash-choked empire crushed under the iron fist of a ruthless dictator for a millenium. Slavery abounds, mass executions take place just to prove a point, rape is whispered about... and yet Sanderson somehow manages, through use of PG-rated language, to make the novel feel safe. It's a disappointment that Sanderson's prose wasn't able to better challenge the unique, oppressive nature of his world and characters.<br /><br />At its heart The Final Empire is a heist novel, the tale of a thieving crew trying to bring down the empire. Naturally, a lot of the novel's success relies on this group and Sanderson manages to deliver a likable, if somewhat uneven and Mary Sueish cast of scoundrels. Kelsier, theleader of the crew and legendary Mistborn (a super-powerful Allomancer) is the obvious standout, being The Final Empire's version of Gandalf (albeit more rougish, volatile and reckless) and the protagonist, Vin, shows nice growth through the novel, even if the reader has to suspend belief when considering her advancement from street urchin to powerful Allomancer by the end of the novel. Sanderson throws in enough genuine twists to keep them all on their toes as they try to pull of the biggest heist their world has ever seen.<br /><br />Prophecy plays a big role in The Final Empire, and Sanderson plays cleverly with the idea of history and information warping as time passes and it filters through the hands of those in power. The first volume doesn't touch on this aspect as much as I would have liked, but a particular scene during the rip-roarin' climax suggests that it will be an important element through the final two volumes of Mistborn.<br /><br />As someone who was introduced to Fantasy through Terry Brooks, R.A. Salvatore and J.R.R. Tolkien, it's nice to find a book that reminds me of those early, exciting days of discovering the genre. I suppose the best thing I can say for it is that The Wheel of Time fans have nothing to worry about; with his charming characters, great grasp on how magic is supposed to work, and easy-to-read prose, Sanderson is surely setup to complete Jordan's series as well as anyone writing. For the first time since Joe Abercrombie's The First Law trilogy, I'm excited at the idea of continuing on with a series, instead of hitting that towering pile of books, littered with other authors waiting to be read.n (a super-powerful Allomancer) is the obvious standout, being The Final Empire's version of Gandalf (albeit more rougish, volatile and reckless) and the protagonist, Vin, shows nice growth through the novel, even if the reader has to suspend belief when considering her advancement from street urchin to powerful Allomancer by the end of the novel.

0765356139|3.0|In my review of Brandon Sanderson's The Final Empire, the first volume in his Mistborn trilogy, I lauded it as a novel that returned me to my roots as a reader of Fantasy. It brought back memories of first getting into the genre and reading the likes of Terry Brooks, Raymond E. Feist and R.A. Salvatore.<br /><br />Furthering its success was Sanderson's ability to take the cliches of the genre, which the aforementioned authors were chock full of, and flip them on their head, pulling the rug out from under readers, so comfortable with genre tropes, just as they began to feel like they had a grip on the story. The Final Empire was a story of likeable characters, imaginative world-building and genuinely shocking twists. Unfortunately, The Well of Ascension takes most of these strengths... and tosses them out the window in favour of a hard-to-swallow love story and a drawn-out siege with the heroes caught between two armies. Luckily we still have one hell of a twist to end the novel off.<br /><br />With the Lord Ruler seemingly defeated, Sanderson was set to explore territory not often touched upon in the Fantasy genre: how a world reacts when the evil lord has fallen and freedom is within grasp. Sanderson presents a world on the edge of chaos, one that has to transition from a society ground under the oppressive rules of the Lord Ruler to one that has to manage itself, to figure out how to right the wrongs set by a thousand-year-old regime, and why it might not be so easy to rule with kindness, compassion and democracy. Where The Final Empire was a successful character-driven caper novel, The Well of Ascension is a political stalemate led by a naive youngster.<br /><br />The Well of Ascension is defined less by what it has, and more by what it's missing. Kelsier, the dashing lead of The Final Empire is gone, and with him goes most of the charisma and fun that defined the first novel. In his place is Elend Venture, the aforementioned naive youngster, who made a strong impression when he was first introduced in The Final Empire, but utterly fails to live up to it in The Well of Ascension. Gone is the confident, aloof individual that helps bring down a tyrant, and in his place is a nervous, self-righteous boy who has little idea how to handle his newfound power. Of course Sanderson sets up The Well of Ascension as a novel about growing into oneself, and making sacrifices for the greater good, which gives Elend (and Vin) room to grow. Still, I couldn't help but feel that the extended siege (which takes up the majority of the novel) was an excuse to halt the more interesting aspects of the story (what exactly the Lord Ruler was warning against at the end of The Final Empire; where Kelsier discovered the fabled Eleventh Metal; Marsh and his infiltration of the the Steel Inquisitors), allowing Sanderson to self-indulgently explore his philosophies on leadership and bog down the story with boring politics that just don't hold up against other novels in the genre.<br /><br />The action is still there, and Sanderson continues to grow and showcase Allomancy (his magic system developed for Mistborn), which is well and good, but it often made me wish that he'd just get on with it, and really delve deep into the mythology of the world and the magic system. Every chapter that passed held promise for what was to come, but ended up being nothing but setup for the final novel. Often it seemed like Sanderson would throw in fight scenes simply to remind us of how the magic worked, as though he knew that too much politicking and unbelievable love stories was boring.<br /><br />The worldbuilding that is in the novel is interesting and holds promise for the final volume. Sanderson further explores the Terris culture (and their mysterious magical ability) and the Kandra, both elements being highlights of the novel. But again, each time Sanderson fed me a little bit of information about the world, it just made me more eager to get past the politics and love stories and get to the more Fantasy-heavy elements.<br /><br />Still, I'd be remiss to ignore the end of the novel, which fixes all of my complaints. The action is frenetic, the consequences of the Lord Ruler's fall finally rear their head, and Sanderson blasts open the scale of the story, spinning every misconception I had on its head. To say the novel ends with a huge twist is an understatement, leaving the heroes with a mountain to climb, when they thought they were looking only at a molehill. But is the final 150 pages enough to makeup for the first 400? I just don't think so.<br /><br />The Well of Ascension suffers more from `middle book syndrome' than almost any other novel I've ever read. The pacing is glacial, but the promises made for the third book were enough to keep me going. It's clear that Sanderson knows how to tell a thoughtful story, and built empathetic characters, but where he failed with The Well of Ascension was choosing what story to tell. I couldn't help but feel that he told the story he thought needed to be told, rather than the story that should have been told.eavy elements.

B000669GAI|5.0|Pearl Jam are a funny old band; despite their experimentation and deliberately anti-commercial stance, they still managed to turn out a large number of successful singles over the years. And 'rearviewmirror' does an excellent job of collecting not only the big FM radio hits, but also lesser known singles and fan favourites from this period.     The collection is a very comprehensive 2-CD set. The first CD showcases the band's heavier side ('Alive', 'Jeremy', 'Even Flow', 'Spin The Black Circle', Do The Evolution'..), and the second CD contains the more mellow, reflective tracks ('Daughter', 'Elderly Woman...', 'Better Man', 'Given To Fly', 'Last Kiss', 'I Am Mine'..). Both CDs are presented in chronological order, allowing listeners to follow the band's increasing ambition and experimentation. And both are dominated by the band's first three albums; 'No Code' and 'Yield' are given only three songs each out of the 33 here, and 'Binaural' and 'Riot Act' only two each. I suppose that's fair enough, given the success of 'Ten', 'Vs' and 'Vitalogy' compared to the others.    This really is what a Greatest Hits collection should be. Yes, it includes all the big hits for casual fans, but by making this a double-disc set, 'rearviewmirror' can really branch out and showcase just how versatile Pearl Jam were (folk rock, Eastern-tinged rock, psychadelia, art rock). It invites those casual fans who thought Pearl Jam were just another bunch of dreary post-grunge moaners to explore the many different sides of the band. A single CD set containing only the FM radio hits wouldn't have done this. And there's also something here for die-hard fans who don't need any convincing; in particular the various non-album and soundtrack singles. It's good to get most of these collected in one place.     So 'rearviewmirror' provides plenty of new and challenging material for casual fans, while still giving them all the hits they love. And it includes enough fodder to entice the die-hards as well.See how good a Greatest Hits album can be when a band actually cares about what the fans might want!    Five stars.

They went out of their way to advance their agenda, instead of making a movie all Superman fans and others could watch without any moral objections!  Dukes of Hazzard remake had to have pot at the end, etc.  I heard they are going back to the drawing board and remaking Superman again.  This time fellas, just make a great movie, and keep your liberal agenda out of it.  They had Lois get pregnant out of wedlock, but they decided to hide Superman's real-sized 'package'.  Seems inconsistent to me.
1577314808|2.0|I'm almost afraid to write what I really think because I've found that Eckart Tolle readers tend to be a bit on the rabid side.  One of the things he teaches is that if you don't buy into his philosophies it is just because you are \\"not ready\\" as if he and everyone else is so much wiser and more mature than you. I find that quite arrogant.  While there are many things to praise in this book (certainly living in the now is a noble endeavor) I just couldn't get past this all knowing superiority complex the man seems to have.  Yeah, I know Oprah loves him but that doesn't mean everyone has to.<br /><br />One thing that disturbs me is that so many Christians seem to take offense at his words.  I'm wondering if they are threatened by his logic.  Have they really read the book, or is it just a knee jerk reaction to anything that isn't biblical?<br /><br />In any case, some people may really enjoy and be inspired by this work, I just wasn't one of them.
B000YIGNKE|2.0|This is the most wrong-headed, disappointing version of anything associated with Jane Austen that I have seen since that awful Howard Fast play The Novelist.  While some of the casting is rather appealing (Wentworth particularly), everything seems to have been rewritten and re-ordered and pasted in to totally change the point of the novel.  Spoilers ahead: It's no longer about having the character to withstand a lonely spinsterhood and a hostile family while remaining true to yourself and your apparently doomed love ... no, in this version it's about weeping and moping and running through the streets in an utterly undignified way if necessary in order to get your man and best of all a really nice house (and yeah, he WAS the guy you were in love with before, but apparently what's REALLY great is that now he can buy you the family estate, woo hoo!).<br /><br />The actress who plays Henrietta also appears to be making an attempt to steal the show through sheer weirdness.  Virtually every opportunity for comedy is instead played for pathos. Jane Austen without a sense of humor is hard to imagine, but these guys have done their best to achieve it.  It's very, very, very, very bad, unless perhaps you have never read Jane Austen and just like costume dramas about mopey girls who end up marrying rich.<br /><br />You will do much better with the older version with Ciaran Hinds.  It's perhaps a little slow and dark out of the gate, but it's true to the spirit of the novel.  This one is not.
0802473156|2.0|This book is like so many other relationship books.  The theory is great, but it is impossible to practice, especially if both parties aren't involved.  For example after I read this book I thought I knew what my husband's love language was and tried to implement it.  Unfortunately, I didn't communicate clearly to him or ask him if my assumptions were correct.  I ended up doing more harm than good and we are now split.  I think the message should be a lot clearer and it should be noted that just because the book leads you down one path doesn't mean it's the right one for your partner.  It might have been more productive if I had shared what I was doing with my husband but we were having difficulty communicating and I should have corrected that first.  This book led me to believe that if I just did what he said, everything would be great.  Unfortunately that was not the case.  In addition, I was somewhat put off by the author's interpretation of Christianity.  It doesn't jive with my idea of what Christianity is, in fact it seems somewhat sexist.
B00000JZC4|5.0|Great album with lots of enjoyable tracks. One problem with mine (maybe all copies of this album are like this?) is that the trailing silence at the end of the last track is endless, so when the last track ends, it doesn't switch back to the first.

It is very claustrophobic ala \\"Night of the Living Dead\\" replacing the farm house by a supermarket, full on glass in the front.  Mist manages the suspense and the tension that increases to final climax at the end.  I really recommend Mist for all completists of good SCI-FI genre and Stephen King adaptations.  Acting is superb and visual effects are decent.  The plot is what keeps you there wanting for more, and the final twist is unexpected.  Go buy it and own it now.
B001G60FVG|4.0|I picked this up, partially because I read Sebold's first book, Lucky, and partially because the movie was coming out. I hate reading the book AFTER the movie, since you're viewing it all through the director's eyes, not your own. I wanted to experience this first hand.<br /><br />I knew I was in for a treat when I was bawling twenty pages in! I found myself wrapped up in the characters themselves and identifying with the main character, Susie, throughout the book. I was so swept up in the book that I could hardly put it down, I needed to get through to the end before I could put it away.<br /><br />The Lovely Bones is incredibly sad, moving, heartfelt, and tragic, all rolled into one... but in the end, it's a great read. Alice Sebold has done well with her sophomore effort -- I'll have to go buy her third book now!
B001PU8N0I|5.0|Davies shows his genius yet again in bringing forth this Dickens classic.  Just like Pride & Prejudice and Bleakhouse, this intricately weaved tale will stay with you forever!!  Sidenote: I really enjoyed the cast, though many may be disappointed with Arthur Clennam as P&P's Mr. Darcy was a bit more handsome back then ;)
0545123267|4.0|This is a YA werewolf novel that I think kept seeing in various lists of popular books and in my Amazon recommendations, so clearly I had to read it eventually.<br /><br />The premise is slightly different from a lot of YA novels of this type, in that the initial girl-falling-in-love-with-werewolf part isn't the main focus of the book. The werewolf, Sam, saved Grace from a wolf attack when she was a child, and has watched her ever since from the forest in her backyard. She's seen him watching, and it's through this silent but constant interaction that they've fallen in love, well before they actually meet in human form six years later at the time the story begins.<br /><br />The problem, instead, is that werewolves in this world can change back and forth for only a limited number of years before they finally remain in wolf form forever. Sam thinks his time is almost up.<br /><br />There are also various other issues with a new and out-of-control werewolf on the loose, tensions and jealousies within Sam's pack, conflicts with Grace's friends at school, etc.<br /><br />Overall, I appreciated Stiefvater's different approach to a familiar theme, but I didn't find myself fully loving the book. I think the doomed romance aspect just wasn't very exciting for me; I'd rather read about things actually *happening* than about two people who are in love but expect soon to be torn apart forever. Still, there were enough actual happenings that the book did hold my attention, and I expect that I'll probably read the sequel eventually.
B00204AA0O|5.0|Simply divine!!  Give the entirety a go one time through before deciding favorites.  You'll be surprised what songs will stay with you the longest.  I also loved this album because she stays true to herself while balancing creativity of song, diversity in melodies, and continuity in vocal experimentation.  Just lovely!!
B002KVSJ64|5.0|This is one of the most consistent bands I've ever heard.  If you have the previous CDs then you should like this one. Nothing new and nothing missing in my view.  Just pure catchy poppy hard rock tunes.  It just depends on which album you like best.  This band seems to never abandon their fan base and keeps pumping out simplistic hard rock tunes.  What more do you want?  Not even close to one of my favorite bands but I give it five stars for consistency. If you like this band a lot do not hesitate to add this album.

B001I45UFC|5.0|I first read this book in the 5th grade,and being the very picky reader that I am, it takes a great book that can keep my eyes glued to the page for more than an hour and this was it. I could not put this book down. This book is a childrens book but should be enjoyed by all ages. You become lost in the land of Narnia and forget your own reality. Even though this is the second book in a series of seven, it can be read without reading the The Magicians Nephew, which is a magnificent book also. But you will understand the characters better if you read it The Magicians Nephew first. This is one of the very few books i will want to read over and over again.
B00260HH3K|3.0|i am a big fan of the dragonball series but the movie was so so, i don't want to put the movie down so much but the only thing i didn't like about this movie is that it didn't follow the anime storyline none of the actors fit the description of the anime characters except maybe bulma and piccolo.(SPOILER ALERT)  My main problem was the story they could at least started him off arriving on the planet as a child and they ignore the krillin character he not in it at all, I don't know what actor could fit to play him. To me if your a die hard fan and want to check it out maybe rent it first. Maybe do a sequel to improve it and introduce vegeta, raditz, nappa, krillin, and tien.
B0026P3G12|5.0|This lady has the most beautiful voice.  Some of her songs will bring you to tears because of the quality of her voice and the wording.  My husband got this at Christmas and was thrilled.
B0014Z4OQG|5.0|I saw this movie in the theaters when it came out it really kept me glued to it this was a very good monster movie. I enjoyed the actors and the way it was made even though some parts might make you dizzy. I like the godzilla (1998) movie and the Independence day movie but they can't top this movie, lots of chills and thrills, plenty of suspense and action. I liked the awesome special effects of the action and monster scenes. The monster is well designed and looks incredibly creeper and so is his babies or minions. They have had talks about a sequel but i think they should leave well enough alone. I would have liked to know more of to where the creature came from and why it came to earth but other than that check out this incredible and awesome monster movie.
B000KCHZK6|5.0|A great set of songs if you like Norah.  She stays true to form and that's perfectly fine by me.
B0000B3B95|5.0|One of the best super hero mvoies made. The script is fantastic, it makes the whole story thing more then just a \\"surprise, out comes the rabbit\\"--and for this some hollywood types gun it down, This movie has some very good actors giving the best they have.  It has actual real science cuts interwoven in it, especially in the opening. A real rarity in the movie genre.    As far as the super hero genre goes this is right there w/ X-men 1 and 2 and dark knight in terms of character accuracy, acting and script. Much better than any other Hulk out there

0399134204|4.0|This book was meant as a gift. I was disappointed when the book arrived, because the dust jacket was worn and not \\"new\\" as described. But the book itself was in good condition.
038572179X|1.0|I gave this book a fair shot. I endured through the first chapters where it droned on, setting up the various characters and switching viewpoints back and forth. I enjoyed reading the next section where it seemed that things would finally work out for Robbie and Cecilia, only to be greatly disappointed in the last two pages of the book.<br /><br />This book is the story of Robbie and Cecilia. He was the son of Cecilia's family's cleaning lady. Robbie and Cecilia grew up together, went to college together, and returned home together. He has hopes of going to medical school and she is trying to figure out what to do with her life. The two have a strange spat by the fountain at her house, and we find that her younger sister, Briony, the writer, was watching. Briony completely misinterprets what she sees, and the results are catastrophic for Robbie.<br /><br />STOP READING IF YOU DON'T WANT TO KNOW THE END<br /><br />This is a terribly depressing book. From child rape, to a man wrongly accused and sentenced, to the couple that is supposed to overcome all of this dying, it is simply depressing. I read the entire book, but I wish I hadn't. I wish I had taken the advice I read a while back that said to subtract your age from 100. Then, give a book that many pages to catch your interest. If it hasn't by that point, stop reading. There are too many good books to waste your time reading.<br /><br />I wish I could get those hours of my life back that I wasted reading this depressing book.
B001RTP3YQ|5.0|I enjoy the CD and listen to it almost daily.  I did not have any questions before I purchased the CD since I saw Leonard on a morning television show.  He performed several selections from the CD and gave a synopis of its contents etc.  Then and there I decided to order the CD album.
0060797509|4.0|My children are small, but I wanted to find a book that was a little more advanced for them that I could read to them before bedtime. We are all enjoying this book. There are a few things I need to explain to them that are false (for example celebration of Santa Claus and conduct/behavior on Sunday). Overall this is a light-hearted book that displays a love that a family has for each other. I am planning to read each book separately instead of purchasing the entire collection of books.

0670021652|2.0|Reading this book was kind of like falling in love with a beautiful woman and then as you get to know her better, realizing sh's not a very nice person.  I enjoyed Eat Pray Love.  I think Elizabeth Gilbert is a good writer.  But in Committed she comes across as just a very selfish, self involved narcissist and I got tired of her very quickly.  This is a woman who apparently was unable to fathom why her grandmother valued her children over her expensive red coat and doesn't think it's a priority for her fiance's children (from a previous marriage) to attend their father's wedding.  If those kinds of values appeal to you, maybe you will like the book.  I didn't.
B002HWRYJE|5.0|I bought this for my wife this past Christmas. She loves this movie. I got it very fast, and the price wasn't too bad at the time. My only regret is that I didn't buy it when it was $9.99.
0316069906|5.0|I have been a vegetarian for many years but this book has made me a vegan. I don't consider this book to be \\"preachy\\" or radical; it is approachable and interesting.  I appreciate the personal questions that lead the author to write the book, especially when confronted with a decision about how to raise a child.  Simple connections and analogies make the truth inescapable. For me, it was a moment in the book when the author asks those readers with companion dogs to imagine raising it in a small closet for its entire life. That is what factory farming is. Beyond the suffering of animals, I was moved by the interviews with slaughterhouse workers who grasped the cruelty and inhumanity that is encouraged in their line of work, but who also feel powerless to make change. There are also stories of people who are working to change the industry and the predictable resistance of agribusiness. And, as someone who is SO tired of Michael Pollan's smug dominance of the discussion over ethical food and farming, I love the deconstruction of some of his logic (or rationalizations for meat eating). The combination of investigation, personal narrative and interviews creates a well-rounded case for eliminating animal food from our diet if we have the luxury of choice and access to alternatives.

B002WCLG3O|4.0|Awesome, loved this movie!  The different style are incredible, and it looks like this movie had a huge budget, very slick.  I didn't care for the american produced segments as much, but loved all the rest.  the japanese segmnts were weirder than I thought, and it doesn't go with all the canon of Halo.    I wasn't sure how this ties into ODST.  Also, is this tying directly into the Halo prequel somehow, coming out in a few months?  It was a bit confusing.  And some of it goes against older Halo ideas, but all in all, I loved it!!    But all in all, amazing.  Two great animes in one week - Halo and Dante's Inferno! If only the rest of the months had this much cool stuff out!
B00338QENI|5.0|I loved this book, I think that it is well worth reading.  My Paternal grandmother was a poor white woman who also died of cervical cancer in the early 1950's before I was born.  Although she wasn't a good parent, my father grieved for her deeply- only once in my life did he ever tell me about her, and he mentioned how painful and difficult the radiation treatment had been for her, and that he thought that the treatment had killed her, not the cancer.  Now I understand better what she, and my father, must have gone through.  The story of the HeLa cell line is fascinating.  Like the author, I remember hearing about HeLa cells in biology class.  I also remember reading an article about the cells that would not die, and how it seemed creepy, like a science fiction movie.  The author portrays the human woman behind the HeLa cells in a compassionate way. The portrayal of the Lacks family and their struggles is deeply moving- people struggling in the face of poverty, prejuidice, and family abuse.  The book is a compelling, can't put down read.

B00275EGWY|5.0|A frontrunner for the Best Picture and Best Director Academy Awards, The Hurt Locker deals with a bomb defusing squad on the field in Iraq. When SSG Thompson (Guy Pearce) is killed when a bomb he is trying to defuse is set off, he is replaced as team leader by SFC James (Jeremy Renner). Things don't quite work out the way the other members of the squad, Sgt Sanborn (Anthony Mackie) and Spc Eldridge (Brian Geraghty), would like as James is an adrenaline junkie who's prone to not listen to anyone around him. As time goes on he detaches himself further from them, and leads them increasingly into more dangerous situations.    Kathryn Bigelow, ex-wife of James \\"King of the World\\" Cameron, is a woman who has never rested on her laurels. Each time she steps up to a plate to make a movie she makes something completely different. With Near Dark she hit up horror, with Blue Steel she played with the thriller genre, Point Break took on the action genre, and Strange Days took on sci-fi. Having not made a movie since 2002's K-19: The Widowmaker, Bigelow was looking for a new project. She was trying to determine what movie to make when she sent this script to James Cameron who told her to make this movie. Now Bigelow sits as the front runner for Best Director, only the fourth woman in the history of the Academy to receive a nomination, and may possibly even best her ex-husband for the statuette.    One of the things that stands out about this film, is that it's a war film that doesn't focus on the idea of whether war is right or wrong, whether or not we should be in Iraq, or if our soldiers are doing good things over there. With a job like bomb defusing, one of the great things, is that you're trying to make a safer environment for both your soldiers as well as the inhabitants that reside in the country you're fighting in. Picking this type of job is a masterful stroke, it allows Bigelow to stay out of politics and focus on the true message of the movie: War is a drug. The main character is a junkie, an adrenaline junkie. More and more he refuses to listen to those around him, and seeks bigger and bigger highs.    Really, The Hurt Locker is an excellent character study of how war affects people differently, like drugs, and this war as a drug metaphor is one of the most brilliant things to come from movies based on wars in the past decade or more. On top of that, for an action movie made from only $15 million (that's half the budget of District 9) this movie still looks better than action movies made for over $100 million, with much more to keep you on the edge of your seat. Also, filmed in a style reminiscent of a documentary the film has a certain real life feel to it, like rather than directing actors Bigelow directed a film crew tagging along with soldiers. Unlike many filmmakers these days, Bigelow really knows how to work suspense. Large portions of scenes are waiting for something bad to happen, and you really feel at any moment anyone could die. In a sniper face off, you sit with James and Sanborn on a ridge watching a building kilometers away, worried for your protagonists and hoping that they'll pull of the right shot. The movie doesn't include as much action as you'd expect, but because of the high suspense of the film you feel there's much more action in the film than there really is.    The acting in this film is superb, as can be noted by Jeremy Renner's Oscar nomination. But, in reality, this cast deserved the SAG ensemble nomination they didn't get. While Renner's role doesn't stand out as the \\"addict\\" really everyone does such a great job that you honestly feel this could be a documentary where each of these actors aren't actors, but actual soldiers in the field. Of all the things that stand out, there's a great scene that comes later on in the movie, where Renner's SFC James has to diffuse a bomb strapped to a man who's pleading for his life. It's an extremely suspenseful scene that is also touching as James tries to come up with anything he can to free the man from his burden, and the acting in a scene like that is what makes it so suspenseful as you care for these individuals because of their actions and the way that they carry themselves.    I highly recommend The Hurt Locker, definitely one of the best movies of 2009, and one that definitely landed on my top 5 list for that year. If you like war films, suspense, action, drama, and/or a good character study this is definitely one to check out. I know I'll be owning it!    5/5

I had a hard time putting it down, and when I finished it all I could say was \\"WOW\\". I couldn't stop going over the ending in my head.<br /><br />This is the first book I've read by Dennis Lehane, and it won't be the last. He captivates his reader, and gives the feeling of being in the story with the characters.  I would highly recommend this book!!

B001FB55I0|2.0|TERMINATOR SALVATION<br /><br />STARRING: Christian Bale, Sam Worthington, Moon Bloodgood, Anton Yelchin, Helena Bonham Carter, Bryce Dallas Howard, Common, Jane Alexander, Michael Ironside and Chris Browning<br /><br />WRITTEN BY: John D. Brancato and Michael Ferris<br /><br />DIRECTED BY: McG<br /><br />Rated: PG-13<br />Genre: Action / Science Fiction<br />Release Date: 21 May 2009<br /><br />It's fair to say that most everyone has a favorite movie franchise they like to geek-out on. As I am no exception, the Terminator series has always been my favorite. Unfortunately for me, I'll have to pretend Terminator Salvation doesn't exist.<br /><br />The futuristic post-apocalyptic side of this story is indeed long over do; but making a Terminator film without Arnold Schwarzenegger, is like making Jaws without a shark. Throw in the facts that James Cameron walked away from the franchise (that he started, I might add), two films ago; and that this is the first installment to be watered-down to a PG - 13 rating; and it seems absurdly pointless. Nevertheless, the film exists anyway.<br /><br />It's been six years since we left John Connor and Kate Brewster in a fall-out shelter at the end of Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines. You would think the look of the Terminator would only improve with time, but you'd be sadly mistaken. For whatever reason, yet again, a character that was visually perfected years ago (1984), has now shown up computer generated.<br /><br />I ask the redundantly un-answered question again, with a breath of desperate annoyance - WHY? Why does Hollywood continuously feel the need to take amazing characters and transform them into computer generated pieces of garbage? George Lucas did it to his very own Yoda, nearly twenty years after he looked more than real in 1980; so why should I even be surprised anymore? Rumor has it there is to be a remake of Spielberg's classic, Jurassic Park. At first I was excited, but will God actually allow them to do the T-Rex with CGI (computer graphic imagery)? Let's hope not.<br /><br />As if using CGI wasn't bad enough; did they really need to make the new Terminators appear to have some sort of physical birth defect to their face? Why are their heads so small? If you haven't seen the film and don't know what I'm talking about, check out the cover of the single disc DVD. If the filmmakers aren't going to take their own movie seriously, how do they expect us to as audience members?<br /><br />The character of John Connor has not once been played by the same actor in any of the four films. This time, Christian Bale gets a shot, and surprisingly was the worst Connor yet. Bale plays Connor with less human emotion than the Terminators have. And I'm not sure if they began shooting a few scenes of this while he was wrapping up with The Dark Knight; but he randomly has the same annoying scratchy voice he had as Batman! What is the deal?<br /><br />The problem with the Terminator movies is that you really need to have an open mind when it comes to the plot. They ask us to buy that John Connor had his father Kyle Reese sent back through time, to save his mother Sara Connor, from a pesky Terminator. If you go with it, it's a lot of fun. If you stop and dwell on it though, it will give you a splitting headache. For the sake of this review, we'll just go with it.<br /><br />In this one, we are in the future nearly the entire time; with the exception of the first few minutes, where we start back in 2003. We meet a new character named Marcus Wright (Sam Worthington). Marcus is on death-row. For dark personal reasons to be revealed later in the film, he volunteers the use of his body to research, for Cyberdynde Systems (the company that generated Skynet - a stream of computers that became self aware and created the Terminators, thus causing Judgment Day).<br /><br />From there, we jump to 2018 in the middle of the nuclear holocaust between what few humans remain alive, and the self aware nightmareSkynet. John Connor is the only survivor in an attack and stumbles across Skynet's hidden secret: a massive assembly line of T-800 Terminators. Schwarzenegger's brand, in case you were wondering.<br /><br />Connor delivers the message to his chain of command. They plan on taking Skynet out, based on data that leads them to believe they can stop the hellish machines, with some sort of signal.<br /><br />Where did this signal come from? Who knows? Why didn't they use this signal to begin with instead of the excessive sending back through time drama? Because this is the third sequel and let's face it, they're reaching. Folks, that's the best explanation I have for you.<br /><br />Something I could not figure out for the life of me, no matter how many times I re-round the DVD; was why the character of Marcus goes skipping across a river like a thrown rock. He falls from a bridge that has been blown up (which looked awesome, by the way), and then sure enough, goes skipping down the river, bouncing like a ragdoll. Aside from bad directing and editing, what could have possibly caused this to happen?<br /><br />Also, in the scene with John Connor and Marcus sharing a conversation in the water, everything seems to be hatched out quite nicely between the two of them when Marcus turns to leave. So why on earth does Connor scream at him angrily, \\"What are you?\\" Was this accidently placed in the film out of order? On the day when Christian Bale lost his cool with that sound guy, perhaps?<br /><br />Whether you're a fan of the series or not, Sam Worthington will be the most rewarding element the film has to offer you. By now, you surely know him from Avatar (ironically also generated from the mind of James Cameron). He is a true gift to action-movie fans: a guy who can play the butt-kicking hero, while being able to act extraordinarily well. You won't find too many of those.<br /><br />Had it not tried to be a Terminator film, it may have been a little better. The action is intense and the cinematography is breath-taking. We see some really cool new machines that were done very well with CGI. But this only made me question again, why the Terminators looked so horrible.<br /><br />Perhaps the most disappointing part of the film was its ridiculously un-original third act. If you've seen the first two films, then you've already seen the ending to Terminator Salvation.<br /><br />Remember when the T-100 was first frozen and then sent into a vat of hot liquid metal at the end of Terminator 2: Judgment Day? Same thing happens to a Terminator in the climax here; only in reverse order. And do you recall in The Terminator, when they had that climatic showdown amidst all of those machines, and Sarah Connor went toe-to-toe with the Terminator; and there was the suspense of the Terminator climbing up the stairs and her having no-where to go? Yeah, well if you don't, it's all here again for you; nearly frame for frame.<br /><br />This may be considered a SPOILER, to some, but I like to think of it as more of a friendly courtesy; to point out that they also CGI'd Arnold's face onto the body of another actor, for a cameo. I guess these filmmakers didn't realize the technology that now exists to digitally reduce wrinkles and make someone look incredibly younger; as used in The Curious Case of Benjamin Button. They didn't have to make Arnold look like he did in the first two films, either. All they had to do was take off six years; he looked great in Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines. Guys, come on.<br /><br />If I had to guess, they probably did this because they weren't able to get Arnold on-board, with their poor excuse for a script. And of course Arnold would have had to train insanely to get his body back to where it was; as he did for the third film. But if that's the case, then you don't use a shot of Arnold at all, hello! You come up with something else, original. Why do these huge studios and directors insist on settling for crap? Crap may very well be cheaper, but it's not as appealing to the eye.me question again, why the Terminators looked so horrible.

B0013D8LCW|5.0|This is really an excellent, well-acted movie about a young man coming to terms with his homosexuality - not exactly an original theme for a movie.  What makes it work however, are the repsponsibilites he assumes for his family and the tensions that arise when he can no longer deny his loneliness for another male.  This comes in the form of his best friend's older brother.  The warmth of their relationship is beautifully wrought.  One begins to feel that there's a future waiting for this young man, even as he wrestles with his responsiblities at home and the desires that awaken him to the promises that life holds. A wonderful movie.

It walks you through most of the GoF patterns in a Mentor/Apprentice in \\"real world\\" applications (not really, but the apps are quite simple and to-the-point).  One sample \\"application\\" is simulating a Gumball machine using the \\"State\\" pattern, adding features, etc.  Then the corporate directors want to monitor ANY gumball machine state remotely using the \\"Proxy\\" design pattern.<br /><br />Not only does it walk you through examples of when you would use this pattern, it compares and contrasts them to each other in quite ingenous ways.  For example, multiple times it uses a \\"Dr. Phil\\" talk show that invites two similar design patterns to sit down and discuss (argue?) why they are better than the other.<br /><br />Also, it has exercises that let you utilize different areas of your brain to help you learn, utilizing the different ways people learn (e.g. visual, mechanical, etc.).<br /><br />It also touches on OO concepts and how these are different (or othogonal to) design patterns.<br /><br />Negative comment: uses Java and various Java libraries to help implement various patterns.  While this is definitely great if you are a Java programmer, it may hinder novices who do not understand that C# or C++ or FORTRAN might not map well to these Java libraries.  However, if you understand what these libraries provide (and give you ideas on care-abouts for your own implementations), you can work through the examples easily, with the caveat that your implementation language is not Java.
0439023483|5.0|Talk about keeping the reader attached to a story! This is the best book I have read! I bought it on CD so I could listen to it in my car whenever I wanted! There is a true good vs. evil in this story and it's WONDERFUL! I always think of the Muse song \\"Uprising\\" when I think of this story.  Katnis is a beautiful, strong and leading WOMAN in this book! She definitely is a character to watch and I am absolutely looking forward to the movie make of this book (let's hope the movie does  not ruin it!).  Each chapter I read kept me holding my breath for what was about to happen!  You will NOT be disappointed with this story!!
B001C4AFOY|5.0|Movie critics seem to brush over the section of movie goers that can't get enough of well done period dramas. The week before I saw YV I watched Avatar. Now, the critics love Avatar--new visual feats, jump scenes, apparent sex and vilification of the political right. What the critics hate is a beautiful well made film with monogamous relationships, real violence and a hero that actual existed. I suppose critics love the imaginative and spur the real, an interesting commentary on our society and its relationship to the beautiful.   This is the best period drama since the 6 hour Pride and Prejudice.
B000683VI4|5.0|I was very impressed at how quickly I received the movie I had ordered and in brand new condition as stated by the dealer. I would not hesitate to buy again from this dealer...
B0034EEE2E|4.0|Do you like beautiful, layered guitars that call your attention? Do you love gorgeous vocals that drip into your ears, soothing your mind?    Then buy this album.
B00000I8BX|4.0|Fear Factory's 3rd studio effort has a couple of things going for it- it's even heavier than Demanufacture from a guitar sound stand point- and at points musically packs a punch few bands can sincerely pull off without sounding hokey. For the most part- this record does hold up the test of time, there's a few moments here and there where FF experiments with prog-rock song structures that work but can be dull in some other places. Alot of the usual Demanufacture like dynamics of Dino Cazares's machine gun tremolo with Herrera's frantic double bass frenzy are still evident. Bell's vocals are still pretty much in line with the previous effort- with a few moments of \\"rapping\\" or hints at it- which is usually found in Nu Metal- which personally I'm not a huge fan of. Obsolete has enough good to overwhelm the little bit of annoyances of the record. The bonus material contains the radio single of \\"Cars\\" which is pretty faithful to Gary Numan's version. The other tracks being slightly harsher than the album tracks in the vocal department. Overall- worthy of picking up. Beware of Digimortal- which has it's moments of greatness and moments of embarrassment. Stand out tracks: \\"Shock\\", \\"Edge Crusher\\", \\"smasher/devourer\\", \\"Descent\\" & \\"Resurrection\\".

B000000H64|5.0|One thing to keep in mind- some bands get popular for the wrong reasons...this is an example of a band getting big for the right reasons...having said that- It's a great 2nd studio effort...  Soul Of A New Machine showed innovation in a time where death/grind was sorta becoming too formulaic. And while it wasn't the best record of it's time- it showed something outside of the norm...Mind you this was the earlier to mid 90's where very few people had really heard Godflesh, Ministry was starting to get noticed, NIN weren't quite as big as the were in the mid 90's...and well Fear Factory by this release had a much bigger audience. Burton C Bell chose to rid himself of the death grunts in favor of a yell/shout- still aggressive but not as extreme- also noteworthy is Bell's clean vocals are more accessible than Soul...Bell sung actual notes on Soul but here he's singing melodies. Dino's guitar also takes on what would come to be his trademark staccato machine gun tremolo picked heavy palm mute technique which caters to drummer's Herrera's double kick drum assault. The result is a futuristic mechanical industrialized metal approach that takes Godflesh's machine gun sound a step further...again refining the sound and stripping the sound of it's death metal and grindcore elements. Samples are effectively used to convey the futuristic landscape therein. Some of the death metal heads cried sell-out by this point- which is a crying shame- although I can see why some say it bares resemblance to Pantera's 2nd and 3rd records- save the use of keyboards and samples...but, still it's unique enough to be something all it's own...Highlights: \\"Demanufacture\\", \\"New Breed\\", \\"pisschrist\\"- song that's a bit of a letdown- \\"Therapy for pain\\" which could've been shaved of two minutes of the ending easily...Still a classic effort.
B002KSPKRS|5.0|These headphone's are ridiculously amazing. I have the TurtleBeach X4 that my boyfriend had gotten me for my birthday last year. I thought those were good until I saw the X41. The sound quality is much better and the headset is a tad lighter to wear on your head. The new fabric makes it easier for your ears to get more air. The newer cord fits into the typer pad for the Xbox 360 so it is easier for him to type and talk instead of having to scroll through the letters like I have to.Honestly the price does seem steep but when you compare it to the old headset it is a steal. It comes with a jack in the front so I can hear what he is hearing so no need to fight on who gets to wear the better headset. I would highly recommend this product. Also that little hiss in the background of the old headset is gone.
B000EGFVQS|5.0|Bought this for my wife.  She said it was a good read.  Kinda sad though.  Good read if you're going to watch the movie.  Read this first.
B002KQ6BT6|2.0|I was having a great time with this book until the bad guy died, and then NOTHING happened for many, many chapters.  There was no answer to the burning questions raised throughout the book and there were no secrets to reveal.  It was the biggest let down I have ever experienced in a book.  The last several chapters were seriously painful to read, but I kept plugging through waiting for the big reveal that the entire book led up to.  And there just wasn't one.  Nothing.  I felt robbed of my time and energy to find nothing at the end.  It made no sense that all the generations of life and death protection and secrecy was to protect nothing.
B00005K3NR|5.0|Just so everyone understands how I rated this movie, here is the break down:    1 star - hated it  2 stars - disliked it  3 stars - average  4 stars - liked it  5 stars - loved it!    So before everyone starts sending me hate mail about how the movie isn't perfect, understand that I am not saying that it is.  I will admit that a lot of people don't seem to like this movie as much as I do though.  However, I think that some of the most fantastic scenes ever caught on film exist in this movie.    I really LOVE Piper Laurie and Sissey Spacek.  They were amazing!  They are the first thing that I will ever mention about this movie because I continue to go back and re-watch this film because of them.    I loved all the details that Sissey Spacek put into Carrie's character.  She would stretch her sleeves to show her nervousness.  Her face would almost seem to genuinely swell up when she was dealing with pressure.  I was quite frankly flabbergasted.  I don't know how she did it.  Of all the actors/actresses in this movie, Sissey Spacek just really stood out.  She did not look like she was acting.  I kept wondering to myself the entire time, where did they get this girl from?    Piper Laurie I could tell was taking a comedic approach to her script and I loved it!  She did a bang up job in her performance.  I loved her interpretation of the pain that she was experiencing as pleasurable.  I could sense her strange sense of humor as she did it and it definitely added a creepy touch to her performance.  Plus, I just loved watching her as she confided to Carrie her deepest darkest secrets from her past and as she bombarded Carrie with her warped perspective on her religious beliefs.    Heck, I loved the casting in general and I feel bad picking out favorites.  For instance, I think that Nancy Allen (Robocop!), Amy Irving, Priscilla Pointer, and Betty Buckley were also in some of the best scenes ever caught on film in this movie.  Priscilla Pointer and Amy Irving were undoubtedlyin the scariest scene in the entire movie.  I completely loved Nancy Allen's performance where she was in a car with John Travolta's character, Billy Nolan.  Lastly, Betty Buckley was perfectly chosen for her role as a gym instructor and I loved watching her whipping everyone in her class into shape for the terrible things that they had done to Carry.    I loved the use of nudity in order to expose the characters' frailnesses and fragilities.  It really created a sense of pure evil in the scenes that had nudity and it made me think about the kind of evil that people were capable of (even though this is all fiction).  I would certainly hope that something like what is depicted in this movie would never happen in real life.    I loved the use of cameras and editing in the film.  I don't think many people pay attention to just how cool this was.  There is a scene where the film was sped up during a moment of comedic relief.  I thought it was very appropriate and made the scene very funny.  There is also a scene where the camera travels along a contraption that will ultimately be used towards Carrie's humiliation and then it completes its shot by focusing on the contraption's targets, Carrie and Tommy Ross.    Lastly, I'll complete this by quoting the lines from the three scenes that constantly go through my head whenever I think about this movie:    1) Carrie: I mean, all the kids think I'm funny, and I don't wanna be. I wanna be normal, I wanna start to try me, a whole person, before it's too late for me to -  [Margaret throws tea on her face, Carrie wipes it off]    2) Margaret White: Witch. Got Satan's Power.  Carrie White: It has nothing to do with Satan, Mama. It's me. Me. If I concentrate hard enough, I can move things.    3) Margaret White: And Eve was weak, say it!  Carrie: No!  Margaret White: Eve was weak!  Carrie: No!  Margaret White: Eve was weak, say it woman!  Carrie: No!  Margaret White: Say it!  Carrie: Eve was weak, Eve was weak.
B0001GL3K4|5.0|one of the best movies i have ever seen.  nothing wrong with the dvd.  excellent shape.
B001PPLIEG|5.0|DVD was excellent- as advertised. When first arrived- DVD was missing- Informed seller. It was promptly replaced. I would use this seller again. Thanks

B000ZELISO|5.0|I have all the Harry Potter movies in regular DVD plus the trunk set that came out a couple years ago.  Since I recently got a big screen Hi Def TV and a Sony Blu Rey Player (through Amazon) I am getting the boxed sets as they come out in Blue Rey but decided to go ahead and get this 6th movie in Blu Ray.  The movie is great (I saw it twice in the IMAX 3-D) and it's just as much fun on Blu Ray disc.  The movie is the best yet and it is fun to watch in Blu Ray as the detail that shows is just amazing.  The service from Amazon was fast and it arrived in perfect condition, as always.  I am very happy with this purchase.
B000001FQI|5.0|The best album of Tears for Fears in the whole carrier. Beside to \\"Songs from the big chair\\", both albuns are reference in the POP Rock of 80's and make me remeber this age, when I was a teenager! The arrangements and instriuments chosen for this record are perfect and Oletta Adams sings in complete harmonious with Roland and Curt! One of the best albuns of my collection.
0679735259|4.0|So states Michael Herr in this riveting, albeit somewhat disjointed account of the focus of all 60s unrest a.k.a the war in Vietnam.    Dispatches can perhaps best be summed up by an incident that occurred some twenty years ago when my daughter accompanied me to a local gun show. It wasn't that she had any particular fascination with weapons of this sort. But, at nineteen, she had reached an age when she took on a newfound fascination with Vietnam, and in particular, with her old man's participation in that conflict.    We spent many hours talking about it, and I found my own experience there did little to satisfy her curiosity on the subject. Out of frustration, I gave her a copy of Dispatches. She consumed it in little more than a day. When next we talked, she told me the book did little to offer any insight on what for her was a puzzling milieu. The book was, she explained, little more than organized chaos. That's why I give it to her, I explained.    Dispatches does little to shed light on the experience of Vietnam. It is not a linear history. What it accomplishes is to provide the reader with a visceral experience, a kind of strobe-light random snapshot of the cruelty, nobility, hysteria and confusion of a war seemingly without end that for many of us, defied explanation. It's certainly worth a look, but is more experiential than enlightening.    And that's a good thing, considering how things turned out.
B002KQ6BT6|1.0|A lot of people will say they'll wait for the movie or the DVD.  I wasted my money on the book (Kindle Edition) and barely made it half way through.  It's now residing in my list at Amazon, maybe I'll get it back some day when I'm really bored....wait, I'd have to be really bored to do that.  My recommendation would be..just forget you ever heard of the book, the movie can't be any better.
0595440096|5.0|My mother was diagnosed with early onset AD in the late 70's.  She was 46, I was 10.  My experience growing up with this disease has colored my entire life.  My mom didn't help me pick out a dress for prom, couldn't go to my wedding and never got to hold her grandchildren.  She died in 1993 at the age of 65 but she had already been gone for a very long time.  I'm glad \\"Still Alice\\" stopped where it did, while there really was a little bit of Alice in there somewhere.  This book rang true for me all the way through.  I read it in one sitting.  If you have someone in your family with AD I'm sure you will relate on many levels.  For those who don't know much about AD - you will when you finish this book.  Aside from the emotional walk down a dark side of memory lane I found the book to be positive in many ways.  Lisa Genova is a very good writer and the book really does pull you in and keep you turning pages.  Most of all I'm happy that Genova leaves the reader believing that love is the last thing to go.  I hope that is true - I hope that they can remember the love even after they forget the faces.      For those of us who wonder what might lurk in our own genetic code it is a good thing to revisit how we feel about facing our own futures with the possibility of AD.  The fear of this disease should not be embraced or ignored, it should be faced head on.  I think this book is a healthy way to explore those feelings.  I'm 42 years old, not that much younger than my mother was, neither of us were tested like the people in Alice's family.  I'm not sure I even want to know.  I just want to enjoy what I've got right now.  Whether your life has been touched by Alzheimer's or not, read this book - have a good cry - and then be grateful for every lucid moment you spend with the people you love.
B001GQ2TGA|4.0|I'm an Enya fan, having a complete collection of her work. While good, this falls a bit short of being great.    This was designed orginally to be a Christmas album, and does contain  Christmas songs,. But apparently, they decided to market it as more of a \\"Winter Season\\" CD.    Some of her songs seem to be \\"same old same old\\" meaning that there doesn't seem to be growth in terms of complexity, nor new ideas expressed. Satisfactory to an Enya fan, but nothing to really rave about.

0800177975|5.0|This is the story of young Danny Madigan who is a huge fan of Jack Slater, a larger-than-life action hero played by Arnold Schwarzenegger. When his best friend, Nick the projectionist, gives him a magic ticket to the newest Jack Slater film, Danny is transported into Slater's world, his number one hero where the good guys always win. It's a dream come true for Danny, but things take a turn for the worst when one of Slater's enemies, Benedict the hitman, gets a hold of the ticket and ends up in Danny's world, where he realizes that if he can kill Arnold Schwarzenegger, then Slater will be no more. Slater and Danny must join forces and travel back and stop him at all costs before it'll be the end of Jack Slater. This movie is one of my favorite Arnold movies, because of it's boldness, and the fact that Arnold can be really funny when he wants to be. It's on my top favorite comedy movies, and it's also in my DVD collection. Very entertaining. If you like Schwarzenegger action movies, you'll like this one as well.
B0015ABRE2|4.0|I am a huge fan of this show and wait for it to come out on DVD just so I don't have to wait a week to see episodes.  The third season continues to be fabulous television.  Howver, I rated it lower than I would the previous two seasons.  The Miguel character left something to be desired.  I was very intrigued that he had found a \\"friend\\", but the way he ultimately betrayed Dexter just seemed uneccesary.  I think just showing that having Dexter's \\"gift\\" is much harder to control than people think would have been enough to bring down the character without him actually betraying Dexter.  That is just my opinion and certainly doesn't take away from the enjoyment of wathcing the series.
B002MLYA0G|5.0|You can find reviews for \\"Let The Right One In\\" elsewhere, but I really wanted to comment on the price of this version.<br /><br />I just noticed this product listing for $50-60; it's simply the UK version of the movie! It's not \\"rare.\\"<br /><br />I ordered this same version about two weeks ago at Amazon.uk.co. The cost in American was less than $19 including shipping. It took about 10 days to receive. It also has the correct \\"Theatrical Subtitles\\" and the one I got has the correct HD audio.<br /><br />I should also note it's a region free disc, although the the \\"Photo gallery\\" did not work correctly, but that's a minor issue since it's apparently the same as the American version, which I also have.<br /><br />I'm giving 5 stars for the movie itself, not the pricing.
B002T9H2LA|1.0|What a disappointment - the scene in the bar goes on and on and on and on and on. This ain't no Kill Bill. Unfortunately many who watch it will be convinced that Hitler died in a movie theater in Paris.  To see a very well made, pithy \\"movie\\" - check out the new VW ad with Stevie Wonder - now that's creative film making!
B00004T9VY|5.0|I've tended to think of \\"Tea For The Tillerman\\" as Cat Stevens' most thoughtful album. It came before the more spiritually minded [[ASIN:B00004T9W4 Teaser and the Firecat]], and contained more personal songs. Be it the sorrowful goodbye of \\"Wild World\\" or the fractured conversation between \\"Father and Son,\\" Stevens was trying to find answers in song to questions that tend to confound we mere mortals. While Stevens may not have known the answers, he was writing gorgeous songs about the quest.<br /><br />To that end, there's a great deal of sadness across \\"Tea for The Tillerman.\\" A somber Cat looks at the pain of \\"Sad Lisa,\\" wondering what he can do to heal her. He frets about the bleakness of his future on \\"I Might Die Tonight.\\" Bookending the CD are calls to save the future of our children. There's also joy in the songs \\"On The Road to Find Out\\" and the chanting \\"Longer Boats.\\" His music was approaching the spiritual nature of his later work, but nonetheless, \\"Tea For The Tillerman\\" is British folk-rock at its finest and rates with Cat Stevens' best albums.
B002VPE1B6|3.0|this is perhaps the strongest example of how the expert use of a medium (3D) can trick the viewer into believing they have just seen the best movie in the history of the human race. superb 3D rendering, awesome colors, extremely imaginative creatures and ecosystems manage successfully to hide the unoriginal plot and political agenda (yes, even a crippled war veteran who's a nobody back home, can become something if they dream hard enough).<br />the story borrows heavily from previous movies like many reviewers have already pointed out; Dances with wolves, Gattaca, and The last Samurai, being among the most glaring examples.<br />the concept is a worthy idea but it's old; it desperately calls for an innovative twist to differentiate itself from the established classics. it calls for the umpteenth time for the respect of the environment, its resources and its people but its narrative is just the same typical paint-by-numbers formula already experienced by every moviegoer. between 1997 and 2009, James Cameron had the ample time to figure it out. his technical approach (with 3D) is almost spotless and i give 2.5 stars for the movie's technical prowess alone.<br />but when you strip the 3D gloss away we're left with a very clich&eacute;'d story. we've seen this before. only the format has changed.<br />that's why i dont feel this movie deserves the 5 star ratings a lot of reviewers are giving it.<br />concerning replay value, only time will tell, but IMHO i dont see myself going back to it because, 3D as a medium will evolve and 3 years from now we wont be impressed by avatar as we are now. so once the medium is taken to even higher levels of rendering, there wont be anything left in this movie to attract us. i'd play Costner's 'dance with the wolves' anytime instead of avatar because they roughly share the same concept, plus, Costner's movie showcases better acting.<br />last and not least, the soundtrack is too generic, its climaxing parts always predictable from a mile away and the celine dion closer was just too much for me to bear, however my rating doesnt touch on those aspects or else i'd be tempted to remove another star.<br />i recently went back and listened to the movie soundtrack and the closer theme song is by Leona Lewis and not Dion (my apologies); her singing style is much in the vein of celine dion but I digress; i still find the soundtrack lacking in drama and emotional delivery after a second listen.ser was just too much for me to bear, however my rating doesnt touch on those aspects or else i'd be tempted to remove another star.  i recently went back and listened to the movie soundtrack and the closer theme song is by Leona Lewis and not Dion (my apologies); her singing style is much in the vein of celine dion but I digress; i still find the soundtrack lacking in drama and emotional delivery after a second listen.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|My mother loved this TV series! Other stories that sold this set wanted double the price for it. I was able to get my mother what she wanted for Christmas and have extra money. She has enjoyed watching this over and over.
B002XTBE6K|4.0|I have always considered myself an Austen purist, therefore I am not a little surprised at my reaction to this 2009 production of \\"Emma\\". In spite of the modernization of the language (phrases like \\"set the record straight\\" among others), and Romola's flouncing and padding and plopping about (entirely, charmingly in character, I feel; Emma, as played by Romola Garai ([[ASIN:B0000SX9MS I Capture the Castle]]), is an enthusiastic young lady who has grown up without much reining in), I was enchanted by it.         What some see as out-of-character lowness in this portrayal of Emma, I see the behavior of a very spoiled, unworldly, untraveled country girl-- yes, Emma is every bit a country girl-- who has had her way in everything, is very used to praise (her class as much as anything, opens her to this, since her \\"inferiors\\" want to please and flatter her constantly), has never wanted for anything, and is, by nature, not given to introspection. Her heart is good, and she eventually learns to empathize with those around her even though she wreaks havoc in the meantime. It is interesting that the only two characters given to impulsive/compulsive smiling are Emma and Miss Bates, suggesting that, perhaps, in better days, Miss Bates' character was similar to Emma's ?           In the book, Emma's father, Mr. Woodhouse, a country squire and fearful but lovable hypochondriac(played by the equally lovable Michael Gambon), is somewhat unconventional and blurs the lines of social distinction on occasion (for example: after the marriage of Miss Taylor Mr. Woodhouse is concerned whether his coachman, James, would be agreeable hitching the horses up to the carriage for such a short trip as the half mile to Randalls. This familiarity with servants would be frowned upon by some other Austen characters like Sir Walter Elliot of \\"Persuasion\\" or Lady Russell of the same novel.), so this leaves in Emma's upbringing something to be desired according to the standards of the day. Thus, itis not that unusual for her to present a somewhat less than perfect model of behavior. Certainly, the vulgar Mrs. Elton (played by Christina Cole) is as critical of Emma as Emma is of her. Perhaps they see themselves as mirrors of one another as well as social rivals.          Knightley is played by Jonny Lee Miller, himself a native of Surrey and the same age as the book's character (Knightley is 37; Emma is 16 years his junior; Miller and Garai are 10 years apart). His approach to the character is understated, realistic, layered, and natural. He portrays this Austen hero as a mature, comfortable very un-Darcy-like man. Hinting at a humanist approach, Knightley appears to judge others on their merits rather than their positions (he is friendly with Mr. Cole, although he is \\"in trade\\"), and his observations are handled with a dry wit that would be appreciated in the period. Ever realistic, he casts a blind eye on the merits of poor, Harriet Smith (played by Louise Dylan), later to admit his error. The chemistry between Garai and Miller is natural, fluid, and friendly. I find Romola Garai luminous,radiant and buoyant, this radiance playing off Miller's calm concern. This is not the hidden, grand passion of \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" where all codes are broken to attain the beloved. It is a marriage of equals and of friends.       The production itself is radiant with sun dappled fields, snowy landscapes, persimmon colored gowns, gorgeous candlelit interiors, and the obligatory, revelatory Austen ball. How these filmmakers put together these beautiful ballroom scenes and make each one unique is beyond me. The costumes are meticulously accurate in fabric, color, and detail, and appropriate to each character's station in life.       In all, the adherence to the emotional story of these people, the dynamics of the relationships, whether between family members, friends, or acquaintances, really fleshes out the characters in a way that another treatment might not. Still, my generosity does not extend to a full five stars. That level of perfection I must reserve for two other productions. One is the 1995 theatrical release of \\"Persuasion\\" with Amanda Root as Anne Elliot and Ciaran Hinds as Captain Frederick Wentworth ([[ASIN:B00003JRCQ Persuasion]]), directed by Roger Michell. The other is the 1980 production of \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" ([[ASIN:B000244FDW Pride and Prejudice (BBC, 1980)]]), directed by Cyril Coke. To me, Elizabeth Garvie will always be Elizabeth Bennet and David Rintoul will always be Darcy.        As for this lovely presentation: the little modernizations of language and behavior (Emma goes unescorted, in the carriage, to the ball; she steps down and stands alone outside the Inn where the ball takes place; not a soul in sight to greet her, help her down, or protect her if she is accosted) do take down the level of Austenian purity but it is made up for with emotional content and sheer beauty (even the musical score is lovely and supportive).       My earlier standard for \\"Emma\\" has always the Beckinsale version ([[ASIN:0767020308 Emma (A&E, 1997)]]), which for many reasons still remains a favorite, but this newer version will share that position and may-be even overtake it. The beautiful, vibrant love story is wonderfully told without slipping into a gushing, heavy handed romanticism which would be so inappropriate for the period and flavor of Jane Austen's work.
0385737947|2.0|I bought this because it somehow got 4.5 stars . . . still trying to figure out why.  This is a mediocre fantasy/sci-fi novel that brings absolutely nothing new to the genre, but doesn't entirely fall on its face either.    The book isn't particularly well written - the author uses a lot of slang and has a bizarre substitute-swear-word thing going on that becomes extremely annoying by about page 9.  On the macro scale, the plot is moderately well-conceived, however the characters are very one-dimensional and don't have much to them other than their respective plot roles.  After a while, I just became very very bored with the story.    It's not that Dashner is really a bad writer in a grammatical sense or anything like that (he manages to effectively command the subjective and objective pronoun cases well enough, for example), it's just that the writing doesn't ever find any kind of flow.  I didn't laugh once in the book, I didn't cry, and I never really cared all that much about any of the characters.  Combine that with the fact that the story isn't much of a page-turner and I basically continued reading just so I could finish and start another book that I had with me.  The ending isn't disappointing and contains a moderate twist, but you have to slog through a lot of boring book to get there, so it's questionable whether or not the payoff really rewards you sufficiently.    If you value character development highly, you will probably hate this book.  None of the characters are any deeper than their specific physical contributions to the plot.  Some are nice and some are mean, but everyone else is just a scared cow.      If an intriguing setting/premise is all you crave, you may enjoy The Maze Runner more as it's fairly good at creating a visually interesting new world.      Either way, I found it to be a fairly amateurish crack at sci-fi/fantasy that basically has no other function than to start what the author intends as a series.  And in fairness, the next book has the potential to be a bit better than this one, if the author somehow develops a sense of humor and more compelling writing style in the interim.    Ultimately, I couldn't shake the feeling that James Dashner could easily sell the rights to The Maze Runner to SPIKE or USA for a three episode low-budget miniseries.  Either that or he bought said rights and turned the story into this book.  TV might actually be a better venue for this story, but since reading takes longer than watching . . . you get the picture.  Go read The Hunger Games, instead.  Similar premise, much better execution.

B001K3JF7K|3.0|I have been a fan of Diana Krall since When I Look  In Your Eyes (see my review), and I also really liked The Look Of Love and From This Moment On.  On these past recordings I thought that she played and sang with a rich emotional depth that just doesn't seem to be there on Quiet Nights.  Also on most tracks her voice seems thin, strained, and airy compared to past recordings.  Krall also uses a different vocal delivery on songs such as \\"Walk On By\\" where the rhythm and pitch just don't sound like her.  I've also really enjoyed her piano playing too, but it comes off sounding trite on \\"So Nice\\".  The opening of the song sounds more like the theme to Three's Company than something a classy jazz musician would record.<br /><br />The silver lining on Quite Nights is the final four songs that come closest to traditional Krall.  I found it odd that likely the best song on the CD \\"How Can You Mend A Broken Heart\\" is listed as a bonus track.  While her vocals don't quite hit the bar that she set on previous recordings, her emotion seems more natural.<br /><br />I hope that Quiet Nights is a blip rather than a trend for Diana Krall.  I am anxious for her next CD to see if she returns to form.  For Quiet Nights I would recommend picking and choosing songs to download rather than buying the whole thing.<br /><br />Download this:  How Can You Mend A Broken Heart
B002UZXJA6|5.0|\\"The Greatest Journey\\" was so good, it seems impossible for Celtic Woman to produce another just as good...but they did just that with \\"Songs From The Heart\\". It is as if they picked up where they left off on the last album. The music of Celtic Woman reminds the listener that music is a gift to the soul. This music takes you to a place of goodness and purity. Thoroughly enjoyable from beginning to end.

B001NS9BCQ|5.0|I just wanted to add, that Yngwie had broken his pick hand after the making of Trilogy, just before he had made this album.. He was worried that he wouldn't be able to play up to his ability any more after that happened..If you really pay close attention, and listen closely to his solos on this particular album, you'll notice that they aren't as fluid and overly technical (clean cut), as they are on his prior albums..just thought i'd share that.. As for his first 5 albums sounding so different from one another (somebody on here was complaining about his different sounding styles on these 1st 5 albums), that was GOOD... It showed that he could branch out a little from the repetetiveness of his style of playing... After 'Eclipse', I really thought All of his albums started getting very repetitive--they all sounded the same to me, so i somewhat lost interest in buying his stuff... Don't get me wrong, I've been a HUGE fan of his since he came over and joined 'Alcatraz'.. To me, his 1st 5 releases epitomize what he was all about... I personally, at this point in time, I would really like to see him do something really super heavy, in the vein of some of these new up and coming metal bands.. Get an over the top screaming, singing vocalist (and let the vocalist handle the Lyrics and vocals!!) But incorporate his (Yngwie's) style of guitar into it.. That would break him away from his cliche'd albums...Sorry if some don't agree, i would like to see it though, i think it would be very cool--and even PROGRESSIVE...

B0034JKZ86|4.0|As a twenty plus year old, I have to say it  was nice to reminsince about old Disney films, particularly the ones I have grown up with Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin and of course the Lion King. All of these movies told a beautiful story with interesting characters and villians.      The Princess and the Frog is a wonderful trip back to Disney's traditional animation, but I have to say it definitely was not what I expected, it was better. The plot at times seemed a little rushed, but it was still refreshing to see something old in our computer digital age.      Tiana spent most of her time as a frog,:(, but the story still held many positive themes nevertheless, one of my favorite saying nothing is worthwhile if there is no love sort of faith without works is dead. It is definitely worth the full ticket price.

B0000041WV|5.0|The first four symphonies of Dvorak were rejected by himself as immature and were omitted from his list of acknowledged works. Hence, this symphony was known as No. 5 till 1955. Earlier, his sixth symphony was published as No.1, Seventh as No. 2, Fifth as No. 3, Eighth as No.4 and occasionally labelled as 'Pastoral'.<br />NEW WORLD :  This descriptive title is illuminating for this symphony. First, it sticks in the memory. Secondly, it reveals ethnic negro melodies adapted by Dvorak.<br />In 1891, Dvorak received a telegram from a wealthy American woman, Mrs. Jeanette M. Thurber, asking him to accept the post of Director at the National Conservatory of Music in New York founded by her some years earlier. Dvorak refused at first as he was reluctant to leave his native Czechoslovakia but was tempted later by the very large salary. When Dvorak reached New York in the autumn of 1892, he was the centre of attention of all musical circles. Mrs. Thurber wanted that Dvorak , who had produced a truly national music based on the folk music of his own country, should show Americans how to do the same thing with their own folk music. A close friend of Dvorak, Henry.E. Krehbiel, wrote that Dvorak held it to be the duty of composers to reflect in their music the spirit of the folk music of the people to whom they belong, not by using those tunes badly as themes, but by studying their characteristics and composing in their vein. Dvorak strove hard in his New World Symphony to reproduce the fundamental characteristics of the Red Indian and Negro melodies which he found in America. Henry Wordsworth Longfellow's ' Song of Hiawatha' made a deep impression on Dvorak as his notebooks show. Mrs. Thurber would have liked to see him make an opera of it but this did not work out. However, a tune jotted down by Dvorak in December 1892 under the heading 'Legend' became the theme of the middle section of the slow Largo movement of the symphony.<br />Like many nineteenth century symphonies, the New World exemplifies the cyclic principle of connecting the various movements thematically. In the slow introduction to the first movement, there is presented on the horns an emphatic rhythmic figure consisting of a rising arpeggio followed by a falling one.<br />This recurs as a motto theme in all the later movements. It is answered by a springily rhythmic phrase on the clarinets and bassoons. The second subject is announced on flutes and oboes. Near the end of the exposition, the flute plays a third lyrical tune. This theme carries over into the development. In the recapitulation, the first subject is much condensed and the second is elaborated and there is a coda based on the motto. The repeat in the exposition of this movement has been honoured only by Istvan Kertesz,Leonard Bernstein and Carlo Maria Giulini.<br />The Largo is made up of two memorable tunes. The first is on the cor anglais and the second is on flute and oboe.<br />The Scherzo is in the traditional form with a trio.In its coda, the motto theme again occurs.<br />In the finale, the massive main theme is announced by the horns and later passed to the strings. The second theme is accompanied on the cellos beneath a long breathed tune on the clarinet. The cor anglais tune from the Largo is brought forward now on the flute. A phrase from the Scherzo now comes on the violins and the motto theme as usual on the horns. In the viola counterpoint to this passage, there is a resemblance to 'Yankee Doodle'. Some recapitulation of the finale's own material follows until the motto theme heralds the coda in a grand thematic apotheosis.It is a magnificent work.<br />The noteworthy readings of this symphony in order are: Istvan Kertesz/London Symphony; Leonard Bernstein/New York Philharmonic; Carlo Maria Giulini/Chicago Symphony; Sir Georg Solti/Chicago Symphony; Arturo Toscanini/NBC Symphony; Jascha Horenstein/Wiener Symphony; Vaclav Talich/Czech Philharmonic; Rudolf Kempe/Royal Philharmonic; Zubin Mehta/Los Angeles Philharmonic; Rafael Kubelik/Berlin Philharmonic; Herbert Von Karajan/Berlin Philharmonic.<br />The Kertesz set is the definitive for complete symphonies.elik/Berlin Philharmonic; Herbert Von Karajan/Berlin Philharmonic.

It is not like other movies you have seen, and just like in life, sometimes change is a good a thing.
B0019HQIFE|5.0|I was not a big John Mayer fan until I got this DVD. His performance blew me away! His guitar playing was perfect, I don't think he played a miss note the whole concert! His acoustic opener was phenomenal,(He opened for him self) then gradually added other musicians to each song until he had the full band on stage. I liked this performance better than any of his CD's, which I bought a few after getting this. Very well produced, excellent picture and color, and the sound quality is outstanding with the DTS Master Audio and makes it one of the better concert Blu-ray's available. An absolute must have for fans and any one trying a Blu-ray concert for the first time, this one's a lot of fun and exciting to watch.<br /><br />I wish Amazon had a 3 Criteria rating that would make for a quicker and more accurate rating of Cd's, DVD's and Blu-ray's.<br /><br />1.

It was boring, depressing, and by the middle of the book it was obvious whodunit. The characters were dull and unengaging. I only read all the way to the end because I was sure something of interest must be abouit to happen. Then we're supposed to believe that the girl who's been a maid all her life runs out and gets her phD in anthropology and lives a life of adventure? Who paid for that?

1401308201|5.0|My daughter is a big fan of the play.  So for her birthday, we gave her tickets for her and a friend.  At the play, all the programs were sold out and she was disappointed.  So, I started researching Amazon to see what was out there.  I found this book and read the reviews.  (The book is not all encompassing and does contain a lot about earlier productions of the play with the performers of that time over the current performers.  However, it reveals a lot of good backstage info, history and insight.  Read the reviews and let your preferences guide you.)  The book has a quality, distressed look binding for effect.    I also checked out some other sites, then came back to Amazon and bought it for a Christmas present.  The purchase/delivery was prompt and effortless.  The price at that time was the best out there (some were asking 3 times as much plus shipping).  And now you can get it even cheaper.  My daughter loves the book, it came in time for Christmas and the price was reasonable.  I feel I hit a homerun.

Watching Avatar gives me hope that someone (come on James!) can set things right and take that book to the screen properly!  The book is legend for those who grew up on Heinlein's writtings.... and now I have seen proof that it can be given a proper place on the screen, and we can then trash every copy of that horrible theatrical abortion that shares its name.  Any takers out there in Hollywood?

One of my favorite Air albums, I can listen through the whole thing while studying or driving without skipping any tracks. And for years, even. The classical piece at the end is gorgeous.

B00275EGWY|5.0|I bought this DVD because I had just read Riverbend's book \\"Baghdad Burning\\" from the Iraqi's perspective of the US invasion, and now I wanted to see it from our military's perspective.  This is a wonderful take on the special unit in Iraq who disarm bombs.  I thought the director Kathryn Bigelow and the writer Mark Boal did a wonderful job of showing the desperation and the urgency of this special unit.  The acting was superb and there was never a dull moment in this wonderful movie.  (I normally HATE war movies!)  I think people need to remember that this is a movie and not a documentary.  As such, there's bound to be inaccuracies.  In order to make any movie that'll keep the audience's attention, you need to exaggerate the situation.  That's just Hollywood.<br /><br />This movie is apolitical and does not glorify the military or the war.  It is great take on the psychology of our soldiers in Iraq.  I think what I took away from this movie was an understanding of the soldiers' mindset and the appreciation of the decision they made.  As much as I loved Bigelow's ex-hubby's movie \\"Avatar\\", I think she might win Oscar for Best Director for this movie.  Like a fine wine, this movie lingered on even when the credits were rolling.  The movie was THAT good!
B000MUK3HI|5.0|This song was written by Paul McCartney for John's son, Julian, when John was going through his divorce with Julian's mother, Cynthia Powell Lennon. It was written to help the child understand and deal with his feelings of what he was going through. It was a very heartfelt and sensitive song with a lot of emotion that fans of the era did not know or understand. This song, and this album will NEVER get old. It can be listened to with interest and joy today as it was when I was a teen in love with The Beatles. My 7 year old granddaughter is living prof: she loves and knows nearly all Beatles toons.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|The cover of this DVD states: \\"You'll never look at dinner the same way again\\" and it's true.  This movie follows the food from their sources to our supermarket.  The sordid method of mass production and the repulsive ways used to bring the food to our table as cheap as possible is beyond abomination.  Yes, I knew that mass production requires putting the livestock in large bins. What I didn't know was that overcrowding was to such an extent that animals were living on top of one another. Compassion and the humane treatment should be exercised whenever you are dealing with any livestock.<br /><br />As our food industry's corporations become more powerful, we come face-to-face with the little guys (small farmers and organic growers) who try to offer the public alternative choices...and how they were met with lawsuits and threats from these corporations.  There's nothing I need THAT BAD where I have to give my business to any company that uses threats!<br /><br />So now that I have this knowledge, what would I be doing differently? I won't be buying meat packages in bulk from my supermarket, that's for sure. I will be buying organic meat products from now on. Yes, they are more expensive but I'll be buying in smaller amounts. When I prepare meals for my family, it'll be quality over quantity.  And I think that's a very good thing!  This DVD is recommended for those people who value their body and the health of their family.  Not recommended for children, as some images are very disturbing.
B0030BYWKK|5.0|Midlake made the album that they wanted to make. In many ways this could be seen as career suicide. Just as their fan base is growing, and they are gaining some national attention, they make The Courage of Others. This is not an album meant to launch them into another tax bracket. But, this is a great personal album with a different kind of power, not seen often in today's alternative music scene.<br />I wholly admire them for this. Because it shows why they are making music, and that this same integrity may be found in it as well.<br /><br />The Courage of others,in my opinion is a better album than the previous two. Each album quite a bit different from each other. I believe they get better each time. On this one, they seem more assured and seasoned. Tim Smith has found his voice. On this recording he doesn't sound like anyone else to me (not Neil Young nor Thom Yorke). This makes me happy.<br /><br />This is a slow album that is best listened to as one piece. Every song is very similar in feel and tone. Its the kind of album that, the more you listen, the more it grows on you. It is at times sad, esoteric and ernest. There is something going on with this album that hits you at the subconscious level. This, I think, is the album's strong point. There's a primal tranquility and a purity that seeps in as you listen. The song Fortune seems to me almost religious. The closer you listen and the more you yield, the more this album gets into you. I love this album. Take the time and I think you might agree.<br /><br />I know that some people will not care for this album very much. Some of the fans will feel let down. But some will enjoy it more and see that it is indeed a stronger album all around - and far more rewarding.<br />Cheers to you in the second group of fans. I hope you are exited as I am to see where they go next.

B000VS6R26|5.0|\\"Titanic\\" (1997) was the world's top grossing movie until director James Cameron did \\"Avatar.\\" Cameron also directed this blockbuster. It tells two tragic stories: the story of the ill-fated ship and the story of a doomed shipboard romance aboardship. It stars Leonardo DiCaprio as Jack Dawson and Kate Winslet as Rose. DiCaprio's boyish looks and slim body opposite Kate's rather chunky, hippy body make him prettier and more lithe than she. Both are captivating. It's probably Di Caprio's best role because it fits his youth and personality.<br /> There's some fanciful and improbable stuff going on in the bow of the ship. I've never been on a cruise ship yet where passengers had such access to the bow so they could stand up and act like they're the ship's fugureheads. In an early scene DiCaprio and his buddy are in the bow; how two steerage passengers got access to it is beyond belief. Later there are the famous scenes of the lovers cavorting at the bow. In several early scenes DiCaprio from Steerage seems to have too much run of the ship.<br /> The overhead shots of the ship are very impressive: the camera glides over the majestic funnels and decks from stern to bow. The technical features of the movie are quite well done. The ship's architect is aboard as is the president of the company, Ismay, who wants to see the ship break TransAtlantic speed records. The captain does not want to push the engines to capacity especially in iceberg-infested waters. The ship is reliant on two lookouts in the crow's nest to spot bergs.<br /> The two lovers, even as the ship is sinking, are pursued by Rose's manic, wild-eyed fianc&eacute; (actor Billy Zane) and a gun-toting bodyguard. They're like classic Perils of Pauline villains. (Cameron never strays too far from the roots of cinema even when he's doing his breakthrough technical shenanigans.) Melodrama for sure, but what could have been more melodramatic than an unsinkable liner going down on its maiden voyage? The gutsy, outspoken Unsinkable Molly Brown (Kathy Bates) is aboard.<br /> The story is framed by a story within a story with an expedition exploring the ship's remains in the 1980's being the framing story. The centenarian Rose flies out to the discovery ship and relives her love affair. It's a great romantic movie of young love combined with a disaster flick.y Brown (Kathy Bates) is aboard.

It's also great for scaring people although it's much too large to look real (9\\" x 11\\") and it has a loud, mechanical sound when it moves. Don't expect a lot of fine control from the remote--you get \\"go straight forward\\" and \\"turn while backing up\\". I only witnessed nipping from the dog and light pawing from the cat but I imagine this toy is not very durable. A rough child would destroy a couple of legs in less than 5 minutes. Note that batteries are NOT included and it requires 2 AA batteries for the remote and 2 AAA batteries for the spider.

I have so many versions of this film... this is the best transfer yet and the added bonus of The Invisible Boy - so hard to get - and loads of extras... well I would suggest getting it now.    True Classics never die... and please if someone is going to make a remake don't go stuffing up the robot like you did in Lost In Space... I think fans prefer the original and not these weird over-the-top constructions that have no character.     This was never one of my favorite films but Robby always one of the best and 'true-looking' robots ever!!! True style... a great family favorite.
B002YIHO7I|5.0|So glad to have her back with a new album. Very chill beats and smooth vocals (naturally). Minimal arrangements with just the right amount of strings and exotic instrumentation that helps keep it all very simple and beautiful. Couldn't ask for more.
B002OHB3CG|5.0|This album is simply amazing.  The live recordings are top notch and the new song \\"Utopia\\" is one of their best softer songs to date.  If you are a fan of Within Temptation, that genre of music, or just like acoustic music, pick this one up...you don't be disappointed!  I am an audiophile and this album leaves me smiling when I list to it in a higher-end 5.1 surround sound system. :-)
B000PTOICC|2.0|It took three weeks fo receive two batteries sent from east coast to CA.  A little too long.
B002YIHO7I|5.0|Hands up all those who know what Sade has been up to the last few years! I thought so, very few. The British/Nigerian chanteuse keeps well out of the public eye when there isn't an album to plug. Not for her the splling out of cars sans underwear, hanging with toy boys, or trapsaising all over town clad in next to nothing like most of her peers do to court the press, yet she still shifts millions of units; look and learn guys!<br /><br />It's been some ten years since the last album, \\"Lovers Rock\\", and Sade returns looking and sounding as though all those years never went by with \\"Soldier of love\\" comprising ten elegant tracks, impeccably produced.<br /><br />Opening is  \\"The moon and the sky\\" with deep bass, lashings of guitar and sprinklings of Spain, followed by the menacing title track with crunching martial beats and lyrics about being \\"In the frontline of this battle of mine\\", using warfare as a metaphor for the vagaries of love. Sounding world-weary, this is the album's most upbeat moment, almost Trip Hop.<br /><br />\\"Morning bird\\" has a beautiful minute-long intro, leading to a haunting ballad with mournful cello and muted piano. \\"Babyfather\\" is a rollicking Reggae-ish bass/brass heavy song with Sade's daughter Ila Adu on additional vocals, and lyrics that may or may not be about Ila's father and his love for her. Such is the mystique.<br /><br />One of the briefest songs, \\"Long hard road\\", is also one of the album's best moments. Beautiful guitars, weeping cello, and a longing and heartfelt delivery in those famous dusky tones.<br /><br />\\"Be that easy\\" is a delicate organ-driven Country-tinged ballad with whistled coda, while \\"Bring me home\\" with clipped beats and haunting harmonies also recalls (like the title track) Trip Hop by acts like Tricky or Portishead. In fact, she has largely drifted from the horn-rich Jazzy sound of earlier songs like \\"Your love is king\\", \\"Is it a crime\\", or \\"Smooth operator\\" for a darker more acoustic sound.<br /><br />The Jazziest moment comes on the languid horn-flecked \\"In another time\\" which also boasts robust string solos, a stirring sax solo, and the cautionary lyrics to Ila \\"You'll be surprised, girl, Soon they'll mean nothing to you\\".<br /><br />Recalling songs like \\"Flow\\" or \\"No ordinary love\\" is \\"Skin\\" on which she is ready to \\"wash you off my skin, I'm going to peel you away...\\" (and name checks Michael Jackson to boot) set to a groovy Reggae-tinged bassline and steel guitars.<br /><br />Closing is \\"The safest place\\", a spectacular string-swathed guitar piece with reverbing effects in which she offers her heart as a cocoon of safety and love. This reminds me a bit of her \\"Pearls\\" (which just won a Grammy for India.Arie, by the way).<br /><br />The music scene may have seen numerous fads come and go in the past decade, but you wouldn't know it listening to this. Sounding as usual like no one else out there, here's hoping the wait for the next album from the band won't be as long. Already a strong contender for album of the year.\\"In another time\\" which also boasts robust string solos, a stirring sax solo, and the cautionary lyrics to Ila \\"You'll be surprised, girl, Soon they'll mean nothing to you\\".

B002YIHO7I|5.0|I have only a question to define this new Sade's Cd: when will she wrong?? Hard to describe or to say anything... Five Stars Always!!!
B000SMWUPS|5.0|I recently purchased an UPPABaby Vista, but the cup holder you have to purchase separately from UPPA Baby is a joke.  I had tried a couple of different, more expensive stroller organizers (Joovy organizer, Prince Lionheart cup holder) and none worked, so since the Sunshine Kids organizer was so inexpensive, I decided to give it a whirl and boy was I pleased to see it worked!<br /><br />Not only does this have 2 cup holders (one for me and one for baby.  It also has a zippered pocket and other larger compartment to keep my cell phone, extra binky's etc...<br /><br />For anyone who bought an UPPABaby Vista and is looking for a great alternative to the waste of money cup holder from UPPA Baby!  I also like that you can collapse the stroller without having to detach it!  So glad I found this product!!!!
B002X02V02|1.0|This would have been 5 stars if not for the censorship, particularly as there was no warning in the product description.<br />I subsequently bought individual tracks from Amazon to replace the censored tracks that I deleted.  This makes the album more expensive, but it's worth it.  This album is in permanent rotation in my car stereo.
B0002KQNJU|5.0|It is just as I remembered it.....I saw this when I was a kid and thought it was hilarious then...and after watching it again after so many years, I found it just as funny and entertaining today.  One of those cult classics.
B002T9H2LK|5.0|Being Jewish made this film a most rewarding viewing experience. While nothing can ever come lose to atoning what happened to my European brethren, I did feel some sense of redemptiom in watching this film. It certainly has Tarantino stamped all over it as grotesque and brutal scenes of human mutilation and murder contain just the right amounts of irony and dark humor. The film made me want to jump right in and become one of the 'Basterds' myself. The symbolism of the SS 'Jew Hunter' fitting the  shoe on the German double agent actress's  foot sums up the message of the movie beautifully...If the shoe fits, wear it!
0307269981|4.0|If you haven't read The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo yet, don't worry. Larsson gives the reader good, short summaries of what happened to Salander and Blomkvist in this sequel. That said, I recommend that you read Tattoo first so that you can get a better idea of who these characters are so that you know why their lives are interconnected the way they are.<br /><br />Unlike Tattoo, The Girl Who Played with Fire starts off with a great hook. Then it bogs a bit when Salander is on the beach, studying mathematical equations while watching a couple who is obviously having marital problems. If you read Tattoo, then you'll know that Salander has a big problem with abusive men. We don't find out why until her story begins to unfold after she is accused of three murders.<br /><br />Once Blomkvist (Salander's former client) finds the bodies of his fellow journalists in their apartment, the pace picks up and doesn't stop. At this point, you have to pay attention because Larsson used several POVs to tell this story. I had to flip back a couple of pages more than once because I lost track of who was doing the narrating, if the \\"voice\\" of the character wasn't obvious.<br /><br />I'm not sure which characters I enjoyed more, Lisbeth Salander or her arch enemies. You'll find plenty of mystery, corruption, bloodshed and murder between the pages of this book. You'll find out more about Lisbeth Salander, as well as shocking secrets about her life that even she didn't know. The last chapter was the most riveting I've read in a long time, although I felt that some aspects were a bit unrealistic. That doesn't matter, though. I'm hooked on Steig Larsson's stories and plan on reading his last book when it becomes available in May.
0689865384|4.0|Uglies is a dystopian YA science ficiton novel set several hundred years in the future. The Rusties (us) have destroyed themselves. Now society is divided into the Uglies and the Pretties. Everyone is an Ugly and lives in Uglyville until they turn 16 years old. Then they have a plastic surgery that makes them pretty and move to New Pretty Town.<br /><br />Tally Youngblood is about to turn 16 and can't wait to be pretty. She becomes friends with Shay who is also about to turn 16 and is involved with a rebel group of people who live outside of civilization in the Smoke and don't want to become pretty. When Shay runs away to live in the Smoke, Tally learns more about the pretty world than she ever wanted to know.<br /><br />This novel raises familiar concepts about appearance versus substance in unique and interesting ways. Personally, I think the middle school and high school audience that this book was written for need to hear this message over and over again. Scott Westerfeld has built a fun, futuristic world in this book, which is the first of a trilogy. I'm looking forward to reading the second book, Pretties.
B002YIHO7I|3.0|Love should never be blind, not not for a country, not for a person, not for your favorite artist/band. I am a longtime huge Sade fan (the band and the singer) but the new album is simply disappointing. It's enevitable I suppose since her best albums are almost flawless, so how can we NOT be bummed about this one?    The worst aspect of the new album: the annoying, bland drum machine beats - at least that's what they sound like to me, I don't hear any real drumming going on except for on the title track. The title track by the way is different, sure, but bold - at least she and the band made a real effort, and the lyrics and relationship theme are creative. The rest of the tracks are not very memorable and it's hard not to long for the glory days. My disappointment thus partly stems from nostalgia and stubborn daydreaming - it's like yearning for when one was younger or missing an old flame. Alas, we must move on, but damn, it's not easy.    Also: I'm sorry to say, but Sade sings off key now and then. She used to do that early in her career, but improved on her vocals. She does not have great confidence in her voice actually - she in fact talks about this in the \\"The Making of Soldier of Love\\" video.     I'm not sure if I'll buy this new album - I very rarely listen to CDs anymore - I get all my music from MySpace and YouTube and I choose not to own an iPod. If however the album was sublime I would no doubt have run out and bought it today at my local indie record store to support them. But since the CD is only so-so, I can easily wait or not buy it at all.     Why do artists (or perhaps their label) insist on there being ten tracks or more on a CD?! Most albums would greatly benefit from some editing such as limiting it to eight tracks. Or maybe put out an EP!?  It's surprising that the band/Sade don't have more to offer or to say after such a long break. After all, they were not forced out of hibernation as far as I know - she has stated that she wanted to make anew album and called up the guys and they said yes and that she only makes an album when she feels she has something to say. I doubt Sade or the guys needed the money. Perhaps Sade just felt like getting back to work after taking a long break to raise her daughter who was born in 1996?    Having said all of this, I will still argue that compared to most of what's out there on major labels by major artists, I'll take this album any day. I only wish she would have brought in a great drummer and also made more of an effort with the lyrics and melodies and production. No wonder the title track was picked as the first single and video and teaser - it's the strongest track. Not killer like so many of her glory days songs, but impressive nonetheless and different.     P.S. Sade just turned 51 last month - she's still stunning.     Three stars because it's not horrific and it's not great either and also for the title track and because, sigh, yes, it's Sade after all.     And oh, please stop putting Sade in a certain box. I loathe that her music is so often termed Smooth Jazz (elevator music) - I associate that \\"category\\" with insufferable saxophone whores like Kenny G. She is utterly unique - her voice, sound, and style.
B0035XMGXS|5.0|After several listens, I have to admit, somewhat reluctantly, that \\"Who I  Am\\" is a great album.  I purchased it on a lark when Amazon offered it at a special price on its release date.  I'm not a fan of boy bands, and I certainly don't fit their target demographic-- I'm over 30 years older than Nick Jonas -- so I didn't expect any more than to explore some new music and perhaps find a few tracks that were keepers.  Despite my initial bias, I can't help but love this album.    This is an impressive debut by the 17-year-old.  The musicianship on the album is superb, Jonas' vocals are solid, and the songs themselves are full of strong melodies and good hooks. The standout tracks are \\"Rose Garden,\\" \\"Who I Am,\\" \\"State of Emergency,\\" and \\"Vesper's Goodbye.\\"      The comparisons to John Mayer and to early Stevie Wonder are inevitable, but there is nothing wrong with being influenced by some great musical artists.  Compared to John Mayer, Nick Jonas & The Administration has a bit more of a pop feel.  The similarity to Stevie Wonder is most obvious on \\"State of Emergency,\\" where at times you almost expect to hear Stevie belt out \\"Very superstitious ... writing's on the wall ...\\"    It will be interesting to see how well this album does.  \\"Who I Am\\" is not teen pop. Instead, it fits into the adult contemporary genre.  As a result, it may not be received well by the younger set.  On the other hand, some of the more mature set may be hesitant to try out an album by one of the Jonas brothers, with the possible exception of parents who have grown to like music that their kids are listening to.    My advice, stealing an album title that George Michael used when he wanted to change his musical identity, is to listen without prejudice.
B000002MP2|5.0|There is an elitist side of me that is almost unwilling to give this album a higher review than three stars. So, does that mean that an immature nostalgia is the reason for the 5 glittering ones? Nay, friends. I have recently started listening to this album again, and I now believe it is among the best crafted albums in rock music.   All the music is simplistic, but arranged in a perfectly bubblegum pop accessible to the ears. Yes I would prefer Bad Brains or The Stooges any day of the week, but they would never work on MTV.  Green Day in the mid-'90s was a pop concession I am willing to make because it wasn't trite yet. Soon, all these clones came along (talkin' to you, Good Charlotte) and drove the formula into the ground. Don't blame the formula, blame the faux-hawks.   I recently reviewed \\"The Slim Shady LP\\" by Eminem, and in ways this is a similar album. Immature, juvenile, but in a way that brings the listener back to those crappy high-school years, with their anxieties, drugs, etc.   If you have a radio, you know these songs, and there's a reason for that. No, it's not really punk, but that didn't matter until they released freakin' \\"American Idiot.\\" Save your Green Day criticisms for a more deserving album.
B0002F6BRE|5.0|One if the most hilarious movies I've ever seen. The whole family can watch it.
B000AADYUI|5.0|I'll admit, I heard \\"Starship\\" and assumed this would be a disaster on the scale of the Challenger Explosion. But now I feel like Arsenio Hall at a cheese party saying, \\"Man, how come you didn't tell me how good this was?\\"  The music alternates between a gentle folk style, rock, some rhythmic intricacies, and the Slick/Kantner harmonies that really takes everything over the top.  The lyrics are those of an empowered Freak movement, cries of 'free dope!' and paranoia of 'Uncle Sam' abound. Is it the 'Children of Men' of concept albums? The story of a child born, a movement to crush the government and hijack the starship. Far out, man.  If you haven't heard it, please do, soon. You won't even remember \\"We Built This City\\" afterward, I swear.
B002T921AC|5.0|How fitting that this super awesome release is title \\"My World\\" because it's as if J Biebs took the world I want to live in that I imagine while I'm working at Steak Escape and put it on a CD. Let's get one thing straight, this kid can flat out sing! He's got chops and if you want to argue about that, I'll double down with 7s on it. He knows Usher! Usher was in one of his videos! How awesome is that?    So what's my favorite song? Good grief, why don't you ask the tough ones right off the bat why don't ya? Just kidding. I'm going to have to say favorite girl. I think everyone has a favorite girl and mine is Danica Patrick. She drives cars in a circle for a living and drives them good. She's also super pretty. I like to drive my car and fish for bass, so I think I'd probably be her kind of guy. I also like one less lonely girl because if Danica Patrick was single and liked me, there would be one less lonely girl in the world. She's married, so she's probably not lonely, but maybe she is. Why else would you spend weekends driving cars for a living?     I could go on for at least 26 minutes and several paragraphs about why this CD is awesome, but let me just give you the cliff notes version. I front a band called asschowder. We do a cover of One Time by the Biebinator and it takes the crowd to another level. Our crowd surpasses average by walking through the door. When we play One Time, our crowd is like a champion bass fisher.
B000FBH3XQ|5.0|I can't imagine why the other reviewer pronounced the first violin harsh: I suggest he cut the treble on his amplifier by a notch or two and listen again. It is true that Lukas Hagen frequently plays with little vibrato, as do the rest of the group, but the intonation is always spot on to my ear, and I find the group's collective timbre pleasing, even beautiful. They also phrase beautifully, communicate the musical structure well, and play every piece as if it were a great masterpiece (unlike many groups who record complete sets). And that is important here because, unlike Mozart's early symphonies or violin sonatas, his first thirteen quartets are wonderful, fully realized masterpieces (a few underdeveloped last movements notwithstanding). If you only know his more famous later quartets, you will be very happy to make the acquaintance of the rest of this box set. In the later quartets there are sometimes other groups that I prefer -- the Italiano in K. 499, the Alban Berg in some of the Prussian quartets, etc. -- but none of the Hagen's are less than fully committed, and all of them are enjoyable. Highly recommended.
B000F8O2PG|5.0|Great to see that can get the entire season on dvd, great to go back and watch this series over again.
0375842209|5.0|I read this book for my book club. Most people in the club were over 60. We thoroughly enjoyed the writing, which was refreshing, and the plot was very good. I bought it for my grandson, who is 14.
B00365YVRO|5.0|The tracks on this album are cohesive and reminiscent of Sade's past style. I think this is better overall than Lover's Rock, regardless of whether it is as good as her older music. This is still one of the better albums, in total, that has been released in several years. I understand expectations have been high, especially since we've all waited so long, but this is far better than some of the customer critiques give credit. Listen to music in this genre and you would be hard pressed to find a better compilation. Sade is not historically about catchy hooks, rather her true uniqueness lies in the sultry way she weaves a song.
B001KVZ6G6|3.0|Paid extra for an all region blu-ray DVD player that would let me enjoy DVDs from other countries.  Worked a treat for a while letting me enjoy shopping on Amazon.com.  Unfortunately, three of the last seven US blu-ray titles that I purchased have been spiked to stop them playing on all region blu-ray players from overseas.  Fortunately this set includes a regular DVD that I can still play.  This means that although I paid for blu-ray quality, I have to be content just watching UP in standard definition.  I guess the message is clear.  My all region blu-ray player has now stopped being an all region player for new releases and I won't be able to shop on Amazon.com for Blu-rays any more.....  Globalisation may be all the go, but Blu-rays are going backwards on the regionalisation trail !
B000002KHB|5.0|This is perhaps the greatest album ever. Deep Purple is my favorite band and this is there best effort alongside of In Rock this is what people think of when they hear the words Deep Purple . A must have for anyone who likes good pure hard rocking music.
B001RIY4WE|3.0|TERMINATOR 2 SKYNET EDITION:  Great movie but unfortunately another blu-ray title designed NOT to play on all region blu-ray DVD players.  Seems to be part of a trend to stop people from other countries enjoying titles released in the US.  For this title I've now had to also pay for the UK edition, but this can be a real pain with titles like \\"Never Say Never Again\\" which are only available in the US AND will only play exclusively on players which are ONLY region A and NOT all region....     THIS SAD SITUATION IS ONE THAT MANUFACTURERS COULD ADVERTISE INSTEAD OF RIPPING OFF CUSTOMERS!!!!  LET US KNOW IF THEY HAVE ENCODED A TITLE TO ONLY PLAY EXCLUSIVELY ON REGION A PLAYERS AS THE VAST MAJORITY OF REGION A BLU-RAY DISCS CAN USUALLY PLAY ON ALL REGION PLAYERS.

0470450266|5.0|This book does indeed take you right to the beginning to the end of the ZBrush process for sculpting the human figure in general, and getting control of Zbrush in particular.  I read through the book hungrily, only skipping once to get through the Texturing chapter, before going back to the earlier chapters. I've now read through most of the chapters and have walked away with a \\"I can do this\\" attitude. I highly recommend this book to those of you like me that have had some false starts with the program up until now.

B001GAPC1K|4.0|I've just started collecting BR's right after I bought my PS3 and I wish I had been purchasing them sooner. I also have the standard dvd of this movie and the difference between dvd and br is phenomenal. Blu Ray FTW!
B002NUULNG|5.0|To someone who have seen the original GiTS and is thinking of buying this movie, just remember that the term 2.0 merely refers to some graphical changes done to some scenes. Otherwise its largely the same movie. The opening scene, where we are introduced to the Major is done completely in CG now and its NOT CHEAP CG as some might like to call. In fact its very well done, the hand drawn animation is left largely in tact, the opening and the creation of Major is completely redone and so is her scuba diving scene and some others. Don't buy this movie, thinking its a complete CG GiTS. It was done mostly to promote Oshii's new movie, The Sky Crawlers. However I personally loved and appreciated the changes. I can see why some people complain that  disposition between CG and cel animation is a bit Jarring but to me it didn't mattered. But maybe that's just me. Buy it only if you are a die hard fan otherwise consider it a rental. Since there's anything new. The new CGI scenes look much better on the Blu-Ray as compared to the DVD counterpart. My only complain is the lack of extra features, you get a measly making of GITS 2.0 and some bios, nothing extraordinary. Considering how much people and filmmakers can say about this movie. Though a cool thing about the Blu-Ray is that for those of you who haven't seen the original, the Blu-Ray comes with both the original and the enhanced version. So you basically get two movies for the price of one. Which is not a bad deal, but it would have been a killer deal if Production I.G would have done some kind of enhances to the hand drawn animation. But what's there is pretty good stuff. But i can say with confidence that GITS 2.0 would be a worthy addition to your collection and don't forget to pick up GITS 2: Innocence on Blu-Ray as well.

B0000AUHQT|3.0|To see the extent to which the filmmakers misunderstood the novel, all you have to do is to view one brief scene.  Recall this passage from the book:<br /><br />--<br />\\"About Gatsby! No, I haven't. I said I'd been making a small investigation of his past.\\"<br /><br />\\"And you found he was an Oxford man,\\" said Jordan helpfully.<br /><br />\\"An Oxford man!\\" He was incredulous. \\"Like hell he is! He wears a pink suit.\\"<br /><br />\\"Nevertheless he's an Oxford man.\\"<br /><br />\\"Oxford, New Mexico,\\" snorted Tom contemptuously, \\"or something like that.\\"<br />--<br /><br />Tom quips \\"Oxford, New Mexico\\" here to mock the notion that Gatsby could have possibly graduated from Oxford.  While Oxford University represents the ultimate in upper class respectability to blue-blooded Easterners like himself, anything having to do with New Mexico is no doubt considered vulgar and hopelessly lower class.  Tom \\"snorts\\" the words \\"Oxford, New Mexico\\" because it is literally laughable to him that a nobody like Gatsby would try to pass himself off as an upper class elite.<br /><br />But in the movie, Tom does not \\"snort\\" the words.  He looks at Jordan with a serious expression and and says \\"Oxford, New Mexico\\" in a chiding tone, like a father reprimanding his misbehaving young daughter.<br /><br />In other words, the filmmakers completely miss the point of that little exchange.  And if they don't grasp something so obvious, well, they really don't understand the character, Tom Buchanan, do they?  And if they don't understand basic stuff like that, they don't understand the book at all, and it shows.<br /><br />Not all is lost.  I'll give the movie three stars for all the visuals:  the lavishly decorated mansions, Gatsby's huge parties, the chic 1920s attire of the moneyed class...it's all beautifully filmed, looking the way you imagine it does in the book.

B00260HH3K|1.0|im not gonna lie i own every season of dragonball,z,gt that are out at the moment including the dragonbox's so i like to think of myself as a true fan and when i watched this movie i literally vomited due to the horrific acting, horrible obscure story and how it is in no way connected to the anime. The sad part is the fact that half of what the actors say isn't even pronounced correctly to the anime not to mention all of the character cuts. Ive already seen this dvd in dollar bins at grocery stores and personally i feel it belongs in the sewers.
B000NA28IE|2.0|My son loves this movie so I got it for him for Christmas.  I was under the impression that it was a 'new' dvd.  It has a scratch on it so the movie has a long spot in the middle that is really messed up.  My son didn't tell me about it until it was too late.

055358202X|4.0|The Seven Kingdoms lie bleeding and battered. The War of the Five Kings has ravaged the countryside, many tens of thousands are dead, and a years-long winter is finally descending on the continent of Westeros with unmitigated fury. The war is petering out, with the Tyrell-Lannister alliance apparently victorious, but in far-off Dorne, on the remote Iron Islands and in the isolated Vale of Arryn plans are being laid that may mean the current peace will be short-lived indeed. In King's Landing, Cersei Lannister rules as Queen Regent, but without the moderating influence of good counsellors, she is ill-equipped to handle the Tyrells' jockeying for power. Her brother Jaime has his own battles to fight, whilst Brienne, the Maid of Tarth, embarks on an impossible quest into the heart of the warzone to find a single lost girl. From the Wall comes Samwell Tarly, bearing an urgent message to the Archmaesters of the Citadel, whilst beyond the Narrow Sea in Braavos, Arya Stark must learn to survive amidst a mysterious organisation with ancient secrets to protect.    A Feast for Crows is the fourth volume of A Song of Ice and Fire, and at the time of publication was the most troubled book in the series to write. George R.R. Martin had planned to have a five-year narrative gap between the events of A Storm of Swords and the following book, A Dance with Dragons, with the readership rejoining the action after the various characters had had a chance to regroup and learn new skills and get a bit older. In the event, this plan proved unworkable, with Martin unable to come up with a reason why the Others would wait five years before making their next move or why events in the Iron Islands or Dorne would not play out for another half-decade. There were also issues about major factions (such as the Faith Militant) appearing out of nowhere. With the writing not cooperating and the book being weighed down by flashbacks, Martin scrapped eighteen months' work on the fourth volume and decided to write A Feast for Crows instead to fill in the gaps in the story.    Of course, as is now widely known, this also proved tricky, and the published novel eventually only contained the stories of a number of the series' major characters, such as Sansa and Arya Stark, Sam Tarly, Brienne of Tarth, and Cersei and Jaime Lannister. A number of the series' other POVs, including the arguably central trinity of Jon Snow, Tyrion Lannister and Daenerys Targaryen, were shunted into A Dance with Dragons (now the fifth volume), and it appears a whole host of new timeline problems were introduced (which ADWD will hopefully resolve). The result is a book that is somewhat problematic and has a number of issues, although in general terms it is as well-written (possibly even moreso) as the rest of the series.    On the plus side, Martin's skills with character, description and worldbuilding remain strong and indeed growing. A Feast for Crows introduces a number of new POVs, either 'proper' ones like Cersei and Brienne or 'temporary' POVs like Arianne Martell or various members of the Greyjoy family, and Martin gets us into these characters' heads and worldviews as ably as ever. His skills with political intrigue remain strong, with Littlefinger's machinations in the Vale, the complex political situation in Dorne (impressively depicted, as we only get a few chapters to convey this part of the story) and the jockeying for the crown in the Iron Islands all handled well. A Feast for Crows is also the most thematically tight novel in the sequence. This book is about the aftermath of the grand conflict in the first three books, and shows how the game of thrones has left tens of thousands dead, hundreds of thousands homeless and millions at the mercy of the coming winter. For a series often criticised for only showing the nobles' point-of-view, A Feast for Crows redresses the balance by showing the impact on the common folk and how they respond (turning to, as historically was and remains often the case, religion to help them).    However, whilst writing what is almost a side-novel to the main series showing the impact of characters' apparently minor decisions in previous books on the masses or the aftermath of events is certainly a valid thing to do (as with what Erikson did with Toll the Hounds, for example), it is fair to say that doing so in a series where the books take many years to be written and published does lead to a fair degree of frustration, particularly for those readers who came off A Storm of Swords expecting the next book to be as incident-packed and furious-paced as the previous ones, and instead found a much more sedately-paced novel focusing on 'quieter' events. At the same time, it is hard to say there is much in A Feast for Crows that is unnecessary. An enormous amount of pipe-laying is going on here, characters are being maneuvered into position, whilst schemes and intrigues are being set in motion that are designed to either re-ignite the war, or ensure Daenerys returns to Westeros as soon as possible, or to shatter the alliance between the Tyrells and Lannisters once and for all.    The only story that feels like it could have been told in less detail was Brienne's grand tour of the shattered riverlands, which, despite providing some interesting alternate perspectives on events and hinting at the fate of a major character from the previous book, feels a little overdone and if the end of the sequence is as it first appears (as unlikely as that is with a Martin novel), even a little pointless. I suspect that the relevance of Brienne's wanderings will become clearer in The Winds of Winter, if not sooner. The only other complaint I had was that the rationale for Cersei's character - yet another prophecy in a series whose first volume I once lauded for not having any hard-and-fast prophecies - felt somewhat unconvincing on a first read. On the series re-read I was surprised to see some elements in A Clash of Kings and A Storm of Swords setting up the revelation involving Cersei's childhood, but overall given the existing reasons for Cersei to loathe Tyrion, it seemed a bit over-the-top to include supernatural reasons as well, although some sort of additional reasoning for Cersei's hatred of Margaery Tyrell - a major driving force of this book's storyline - was indeed required.    A Feast for Crows (****) is well-written and engaging, but also slower-paced and more thoughtful and reflective than the previous three books in the series, something that has divided a lot of readers.
B000GW88TC|5.0|I had a copy of this cd from about 1990. When it came time to upgrade my Smith's collection to newly remastered releases, I opted for a Best of The Smiths compilation (2cd British version.) I thought that this would satiate my appetite for a while. Before long, I found myself wanting the original album releases. If you're a Smith's purist, and mourn the break up of the Morrissey/Marr song writing partnership, then you can understand the desire to get all the original albums.   Unfortunately, to get newly minted, remastered Smith's releases, one has to go the Japanese route. Only about five to ten thousand of the original albums were pressed for the paper sleeve additions. Fortunately, I live in Japan, and I was able to go through Amazon's independent sellers network. The price of most of the paper sleeve releases was still high! (but not prohibitively high for the avid collector.)   With the paper sleeves I got exactly what I wanted; pristine remastered material that showcased Johnny Marr's guitar work. The beauty of remasters is that the sound of the various instruments are not all scrunched together into the mix. With a good home 5.1 system or good headphones, I can really hear the instruments clearly separated. And it's a real treat to hear this material in this manner.   The thing that pleasantly surprised me is that the liner notes were all meticulously reproduced for the paper sleeve Japanese versions. Upon pulling out the liners with the cd inside I was jolted back a good twenty five years to my college days! This was totally unexpected. Staring up at me were exact replicas of all the lyrics neatly displayed on Meat Is Murder. I love the layout. Morrissey made sure that Smith's packaging was tasteful and aesthetically pleasing. His quality control still measures up all these years later.   As for Meat Is Murder as an album, the Smith's second album broke the sophomore curse. The band was tighter, more focused, and Marr/Morrissey had this album well thought out track by track. Even the instrumental jams sound inspired and not at all like filler. The Smith's were well in their element by their second outing. They had done John Peel BBC Radio sessions, and released numerous singles, so the sophomore curse of a touring band unable to deliver quality work on the second release doesn't at all apply here.   Of further note, the rhythm section of O'Rourke on bass, and Joyce on drums is outstanding. The rhythm section of this band is often over looked. After the Smith's, O'Rourke went through rehab, and was strong enough to team up again with Mike Joyce, the Smith's drummer as Sinead O'Connor's touring band rhythm section for her first album back in 1987/1988. The remastered versions of the Smith's catalogue highlight how truly good the Smith's were as a band.I regret not seeing Sinead in London with O'Rourke and Joyce as backing musicians.   So, in short, if you are a Smith's fanatic like myself, and you want to get hold of something that is very rare and precious, then do patronize Amazon's independent sellers for these releases. But beware, because once you listen to one of these paper sleeve additions, you will want them all for completion sake, and you will find yourself shelling out well over two hundred dollars for a handful of exceptionally fine cds.

B000OT8GCQ|4.0|I wasn't expecting that much from this book. I loved the Notebook but I know that Sparks is an easy going writer and easy to digest. I read this quickly, snowed in from a blizzard and it was exactly what I wanted, easy romantic fluff. Nice beach read.

B001IAOEXU|5.0|Been using these for about 3 weeks now and could not be happier.  After the first couple days it's hard to image playing a game without them.  They even look like they're supposed to be there.  Easy to snap on and will stay on even if you drop your controller on the floor.  I got a pair for my friend and he really likes them too.  The best $5 investment you can make for your PS3.
B002T9H2L0|5.0|Another fantastic film by Tarantino.  Contrary to what some people come to this movie looking for, this is a movie driven by dialogue, not action.  If you're here for a gore fest, or a shoot 'em up flick, check out something else.  This movie has an outstanding script that will leave you wanting more.  This is one of those blu ray's I actually watch on a regular basis.  As far as the blu ray goes - the video and audio are both great.  Definitely satisfied with my purchase!
B00006FR47|5.0|If all you knew of Chicago (the band) was based solely on their post-1982 output (which consisted primarily of monstrous, hook-friendly hits for the lovelorn that could put the population of many small countries into a Diabetic coma) - than you are missing out on some of the most adventurous and experimental rock ever created by not digging deeper into their earlier catalog.<br /><br />There is little argument that at their creative peak (1967-1976) the horn-based ensemble redefined and blurred the boundaries of acid rock, jazz fusion and classical composition into an exquisitely intricate string of Top 40 and AOR hits. In the annals of rock history they are, for better or worse, the \\"Beatles in Reverse.\\"<br /><br />Whereas the Lads from Liverpool evolved from a very simple singles band into a complex stew of psychedelia and political anthem-making, Chicago's canvass unfortunately became very small -  initially wrapping progressive social protest around long form composition to a final (and current) incarnation as a lyrically bereft hits band, sans horns and any palpable creative pulse.<br /><br />While regrettable, their regress in no way diminishes the stature of their initial output (Chicago Transit Authority - Chicago VII) of which Chicago V stands as the most accessible exemplar of their signature sound.  As their first single-disc offering, after a string of double-disc+ releases, their sound is tight, the horns bright and the harmonies complex all punctuated by a cohesive mood flow and lyrics, that while dated by the politics of the time; did aspire to something beyond an unremarkable Hallmark Moment. It is also worth mentioning that the record contains their biggest and greatest hit (IMHO) - Saturday In The Park - a song that ranks as one of the Top 20 singles of all time.<br /><br />If you want to capture a great band in peak form, book a ticket to Chicago V. Highly recommended!
0156030306|1.0|This was required reading for me in high school English class.  I had never in my life fallen asleep while reading before.  I swear I fell asleep every time I picked up the book to read my assigned chapters.  I am really not kidding.  As an adult I saw this horrible book at a library book sale and spent a quarter on it just for nights I suffered with insomnia.  I hope it will work years later, too.  Really detested this book.  No real point in reading it, unless you need to for a grade.  Then, I guess, I wish you luck and lots of caffeine.
B002RI9ORI|5.0|Brilliant book. Although evidence based medicine is part of my everyday work, I found some new insights and perspectives. I don't now, if all the stuff about the bad journalism is a specific problem of the british press, but I doubt it. The only solution - sapere aude (Dare to think).   The only setback, but that is not Mr. Goldacres fault, the Kindle-Version has no graphs in it. In some chapters the text refers to tables or figures but they are just not there. And here in Europe it is even more expensive than the paperback. (This is not the first E-Book, where I am really annoyed by this problem. I am starting to get quite disappointed with my reader. But that's another topic. Please excuse my far from perfect english, but I'm not a native speaker.)
B002YIHO7I|3.0|WHEN I FIRST HEARD HER SINGLE SOLDIER OF LOVE I WAS VERY EXCITED AND WHEN I LOOKED AT HER UPCOMING ALBUM AND REVIEWED THE SONGS I COULD TELL THAT IT WAS NOT GOING TO HAVE ALOT OF SONGS LIKE AND SIMILAR TO IT FIRST SINGLE.   I HAVE BEEN A BIG FAN OF SADE SINCE THE EARLY 80'S, HER MUSIC IS STILL THE BEST IN JAZZ/ SOUL GENRE. UNLIKE HER LOVERS ROCK ALBUM THIS ONE IS LACKING ALOT OF PERCUSSION  THEMED SONGS, IT ONLY HAS BALLADS WITH DOWNTEMPO VIBES. THE ONLY SONG WITH A GOOD PERCUSSION BEAT IS SOLDIER OF LOVE. DON'T GET ME WRONG SHE SINGS FROM THE HEART AND SOUL, BUT THIS CD IS LACKING THE POWER DOSE OF WHAT DIAMOND LIFE, PROMISE, STRONGER THAN PRIDE, LOVE DELUXE (MY OPINION HER BEST ALBUM PERIOD), LOVERS ROCK. I UNDERSTAND THE TIMES IN MUSIC IS CHANGING AND ARTIST ARE TRYING TO GET AWAY FROM POPPY SOUNDS AND COMMERCIAL CASH INS. YOU EITHER LIKE IT OR DON'T AND HER RECORD SALES IN STORES IS WHAT SELLS HER MUSIC. SHE KNOWS HOW TO MARKET HER MUSIC AND IS SMART. HER CONCERTS ARE MINDBLOWING AND  DEFINITELY EXCITING TO SEE PERFORM.
B00005LK95|5.0|A great comedy. This one is a little darker than the original at parts, but still definitely family-appropriate and guaranteed to have you in stitches.
B0015KO52S|5.0|If the Raconteurs rocked with their first album, their second one definately rolls. From start to finish, Jack White leads a rollickingly adept team of musical masters into walls of sound that recalls the best of Sabbath, Zeppelin, and the Band, creating a vibe that manages to feel fresh, yet familiar.
B002YIHO7I|5.0|I have been waiting a long time for new music from Sade. That is why early this morning even during an approaching snow storm I made a trip to Target to buy the album (shhh don't tell Amazon) and I am very pleased with the album. What I love most about the album is that is purely Sade and nothing else. No guest appearances from rappers, or artist of different genres, it sounds just like a Sade album is suppose to sound. I really hate how R&B of today relies on guest appearances from rappers and other gimmicks to be considered \\"HOT.\\" It's one of the reasons music nowadays becomes so played-out so fast. While I have enjoyed the whole album my favorites are Soldier of Love, The Moon and the Sky (a potential second single IMO), Babyfather, Long Hard Road, and In Another Time. Everyone, cherish it while we can because the next album may be another 10 years...I Love You Sade!

Fav song: \\"Disarm Me\\" (should've been the first single-too good of a song). \\"Katherine Wheel\\" sounded like the guitar riff was from the 70's, possibly Bachman, Turner, Overdrive or Blue Oyster Cult era type bands. But it does sound kinda \\"American-ish,\\"with this emo producer.\\"Love the Hardest Way\\" reminded me of some song from the 80's but I can't place it (the intro keyboards part). Sisters of mercy perhaps?? \\"The Foreboding Sense...\\" is SO Edgar Allan Poe in the title. \\"Acoustic Funeral\\" haha Valo just had to throw in the Black Sabbath reference in there huh? You guys should be proud of yourselves! The Acoustic CD is walone the best part. Listen to this one first...it's Ville in his rawist, most sincere form. Seriously loved it, didn't think I would because of what I heard and saw NOT impressed by the videos.
0684847248|5.0|In this phenomenal and instructive guide to a better and more fulfilled of less pain and more spirituality, M Scott Peck takes us through the steps we need to take and the realities we need to internalize in order to lead a happier more pain-free and fulfilled life.<br />This book is divided into four sections:<br /><br />1 Discipline<br />2 Love<br />3 Growth and Religion<br />4 Grace<br /><br />Discipline, the author explains, is the basic set of tools we require to solve life's problems. There are essentially four ingredients of this:<br />Delaying gratification, acceptance of responsibility, dedication to the truth, and balancing.<br />Peck explains the will to use these tools as love.<br /><br />He explains love as 'the will to extend one's self for the purpose of nurturing one's own or another's spiritual growth.<br /><br />Finally the author while acknowledging the harm caused by a very narrow and stringent form of religious observance also warns against the unfortunate and destructive tendency of many psycotherapists to dismiss religion and belief in G-D as a pathology and the Enemy.<br />Peck go's on to explain how we can only attain full happiness and truth through oneness with G-D.<br />He explains how he came to the knowledge that miracle are indeed a part of reality.<br />\\"What are we to do-we who are properly sceptical and scientific minded with this 'powerful force', originating outside of human consciousness which nurtures the spiritual growth of human beings\\".<br /><br />The author also points out the scientifically proven facts, originally expounded by Karl Jung's theory of collective conscience, that part of our knowledge and wisdom is genetically inherited.<br />Finally Peck explores the problem of evil.<br />\\"There really are people and institutions made up of people who respond with hatred in the presence of goodness and would destroy the good as far as it is in their power to do so.

I work away from home and I don't have cable TV I do have a DVD player and I often play that DVD several times a week in my apartment.  I'm excited to receive the book and I can't wait until it gets here.  I have always enjoyed Julia's TV show and I was born the year she was married so I grew up with the name as a household icon.  Meryl Streep played her so well I love the movie, the bonus DVD and I love to cook and I love Julia Child.
B000J4QWM2|1.0|Michael Mann's \\"Miami Vice\\" (2006) is crime drama that never gets off the ground.  The film is remarkable for what it leaves out and what it includes.  Save for the shootout at the end of the film there is precious little gunplay.  The drugs also receive little camera attention.  While verbally mentioned the drugs are almost invisible in the film, existing only as suspect \\"packages\\" sitting around on boats.  The drug lord himself maybe gets five minutes of screen time, as does the snitch who rats him out to keep his stay-out-of-jail-card and tax-payer-funded mansion.  The drug lord's security handler ends up with far more screen time, but he winds up being a character of almost of no importance, as the police outsmart him at just about every turn and the drug lord escapes cleanly without his aid.  So, what exactly did he contribute to the story except for a weak love quadrangle?  The white supremacists that begin and end the film as the villains totally disappear for most of the film, making yet another weak subplot in the story.  Totally absent from the movie is the requisite paperwork that haunts any investigative police work.  Also missing is a police facility of any stripe.  Even more striking is the lack of teamwork.  Partners Colin Ferrell and Jamie Foxx are almost always going solo, which inevitably leads to the seemingly requisite James Bond love scenes.  How many undercover officers actually have casual sex with their operation teammates (portrayed by Jamie Foxx and teammate Naomie Harris) or the target's girl (portrayed by Colin Ferrell and Gong Li as the drug lord's girlfriend)?  Apart from being sexual sidekicks, the females in this film have little role to play and receive almost no screen time outside of this role.  This film has little action, lacks realism, and suffers from a confused and poorly directed plot.
1591840562|1.0|I have to say that I didn't finish the book. I didn't even make it past page 15. Anybody who is going say men are dumber than women and use one book written by a female author to make his point is uncreditable. I threw the book down right then. No surprise though as most of these kind of books are written by people who make most of their money by writing books. I think I will stick to reading books authored by people who actually know what they're talking about.
0143038583|5.0|I was expecting a diatribe, a full-force blast against agri-business and the factory farm, more along the lines of what we hear from the more strident vegans and animal rights activists.  Pollan, however, is much too skilled as a journalist and writer for that.  If his journeys lead him to both Food Hell and Food Heaven, they also show him that there is no clear, simple, and easy path to salvation when it comes to eating.     \\"The Omnivore's Dilemma\\" is Pollan's attempt to answer some important questions about the food we eat, which I have unfairly boiled down to: Where does our food come from, and how did it get from there to us?  His quest takes him through the horrifying house of cards that is industrial farming, ranching, and food processing, a vision that will either open your eyes or make you screw them tightly shut, because most of us don't have a lot of choice when it comes, for example, to eschewing the monoculture corn that finds its way into most of what we eat and much of what we don't.  The first of the four meals in the subtitle is of McDonald's fast food, eaten with his family but hardly \\"shared,\\" as they each consumed a different choice of foods, all the while driving along the highway, as many fast food meals are eaten in America today.     Skipping ahead, the fourth and final meal was as personal and local as Pollan could make it:  meat from the wild pig he shot himself, bread made with wild yeasts, produce from his garden, mushrooms gathered by his own hands, and more, all crafted into a gourmet feast that he shared at the table with friends, family, and good conversation.  With apparently honest and transparent struggles, he experiences both the attraction of vegetarianism and the joy of the hunt in preparation for what he called his Perfect Meal.  Not a meal for everyone, nor for every day, but a meal of grace, embodying the ultimate answer to his questions.     In between is Organic, what Pollan calls pastoral food, in contrast to industrial. This required two meals, because \\"organic\\" isn't what it used to be.  Big Organic, symbolized by the Whole Foods Market, is the organic movement gone mainstream.  It is proof that we do, after all, have some choice about where our food comes from.  That we can now buy organic food at Wal-Mart says a lot for the power of the consumer.  But this victory came at a price:  our 1960's-bred image of the small, family, organic farm remains only on the patently misleading pictures on the food packages.  In order to become a mass-market commodity, organic food has taken on many of the harmful practices of the industrial system, from migrant labor to \\"free range\\" chickens that never see the outdoors.  It's still a good thing -- organic farming is much better for the land and produces food that is at least somewhat more nutritious -- but has it lost its soul?     Joel Salatin would say it has.  The section on Salatin's Polyface Farm in Virginia is worth the price of the book all by itself.  This is Food Heaven on earth.  The Salatin family, beginning with Joel's parents, took an abused and exhausted plot of land and healed it (\\"we are in the redemption business\\"), turning it into a showpiece of truly sustainable agriculture, one that produces a great deal of food while enriching, rather than depleting the land, and where the people, the animals, the plants, the smaller creatures, and the soil play out their interdependence to the advantage of all.     Hope for the future of food lies not in one particular system, Pollan says, but in supporting a variety of approaches.  \\"As in the fields, nature provides the best model for the marketplaces, and nature never puts all her eggs in one basket.  The great virtue of a diversified food economy, like a diverse pasture or farm, is its ability to withstand any shock.  The important thing is that there be multiple food chains, so that when any one of them fails -- when the oil runs out, when mad cow or other food-borne diseases become epidemic, when the pesticides no longer work, when drought strikes and plagues come and soils blow away -- we'll still have a way to feed ourselves.\\"     Far from being the jeremiad I had expected, Pollan's careful investigations and respectful reporting make \\"The Omnivore's Dilemma\\" a book that everyone who eats should read.

B00280LYIC|3.0|Basically, the writing was bland, pretty dull. I'm an adult, I very much enjoy reading tween books on occasion, and got this book thinking it would be a nice read. It IS in general, but oh so boring. I would say this book is right there with the 8-10 year old crowd, not the 12+.     The biggest problem I had was Percy's mother, and how the author did not, could not, convey any emotional sadness or distress from the main character. The mother, after her disappearance  was thrown in as a side note, from time to time. (trying not to put a spoiler in here, if you've read the book, you know what I mean)      Read it if you want, enjoy it too, but be prepared to yawn a bit.
B001M5UDGS|5.0|If you like quirky musical stuff and Whedon you'll like this.  My only thing to say is buy it for the musical commentary.  You're looking at a whole other set of songs (that lasts just as long as the actual program) that in my opinion are better than the originals.  The commentary is pretty much the only songs we listen to on this DVD anymore.

0393075966|4.0|Joseph Stiglitz takes aim at Wall Street greed with characteristic forthrightness (Chapter 5 is \\"The Great American Robbery\\"), but his real target is the bankrupt global economic system led by Wall Street. It is a system based on a lethal combination of greed, propaganda, and phony economics.<br /><br />The true motivation of market fundamentalism (= neo-liberalism) is greed, but the propaganda is supplied the ideology of neoclassical economics, whose key assumptions, neatly listed in chapter 9, are blatantly false. Computer people would say \\"garbage in - garbage out\\", but the \\"garbage out\\" (deregulation, privatization, tax cuts, corporate welfare, free trade and flows of money, etc.) has served the forces of greed very well indeed.<br /><br />Meanwhile elaborate mathematical superstructures hid the \\"garbage in\\", so that poor nations had to learn through hard experience that Wall Street was a predator, that they were prey, and that the IMF was the teeth of the Wall Street lion. But it wasn't just the poor overseas - much of the American middle class and much of Main Street business was also prey. So much so, that since Reagan was elected US national wealth has doubled but median wages have actually declined. With all the new income going to the wealthy, households went heavily into debt to maintain their middle class lifestyles. Now declining standards of living are becoming reality, especially for the jobless.<br /><br />However Stiglitz's prescription for further economic growth on p. 225, as necessary to lift poor people out of poverty, left me a bit uneasy. Does the world have the resources to do this on a sustainable basis for several billion people, even if there were to be a large transfer of wealth to poor countries? Later he acknowledges, on p. 289, that if they all \\"try to imitate America's lifestyle, the planet is doomed\\".  Yet my sense is that Stiglitz has not yet fully grappled with the fact that economic growth itself, even very productive growth, is the source of many of the environmental and resource problems now coming to the fore.<br /><br />While it is true that we'll certainly need to grow some sectors of the economy (renewable energy, etc), logic dictates that drastic shrinkage of other sectors, and of global population too, must be the order of the day if the world is to get serious about both climate change and economic justice. And Stiglitz never even mentions Peak Oil, which is already bringing global economic growth to a halt. Very few economists, including Stiglitz, have dealt seriously with the prospect of long term economic stagnation, let alone decline. For example, what kind of global financial system would be able to handle this?<br /><br />One also hopes that Stiglitz, in his next book, will write less in generalities, more in insightful detail. For example, on p. 231 he says that he chaired a UN commission on global financial restructuring. It would have been wonderful to have read an insider's account of key moments / issues / personalities of that commission. Instead he talks about a new global reserve system in an abstract way without even saying exactly how it would work, let alone giving a thorough argument as to why it would work. This is precisely the kind of detail I expect in a book, as opposed to an article.he environmental and resource problems now coming to the fore.

B001E5CH0G|5.0|We really enjoyed this movie, and it cam within a reasonable period of time and was in the condition promised.
B00005JMJ4|4.0|THere are a lot of things going for this film.  Its grotesque parody of Japanese culture - a true delight to anyone who knows Japan - is without question a bull's-eye:  having lived in Japan, I can say that the place really does at times appear to you the way that it does to the visitors.  Coppola gets Japan, or at least Tokyo, in what I found to be a unique yet tasteful way.  THe chemistry between Murray and Johansson is also extremely believable:  two strangers in their own life crises meet in a hotel and strike up a sudden intimacy, feeling like soulmates is their splendidly luxurious isolation and cultural alienation.  Finally, the acting is positively excellent, particularly Johansson, who comes off as something of a dowdy intellectual, confronted by a stalled marriage and broken identity.  But Murray is great, too, as a film star whose life is moving too fast as his wife pulls away from him while controlling the nest of kids at home.<br /><br />That being said, the way that some people heap praise on this film as if it were by Bergman goes a bit far.  Sure, they achieve a kind of immediate intimacy and openness, but these things happen when you travel and then they evaporate just as quickly.  But then, this is hollywoodian to its core:  the slightest gestures and exchanges are magnified and become icons to compare to one's own life narrative, a kind of pseudo introspection, almost the way mythology used to supply images to people as they lived their everyday lives.<br /><br />I would recommend the film as funny and smart, but it is only an excellent comedy and not by any means a bildungsroman or psychological realism, as I had been led to expect from the reviews here.
B0002IQEHI|5.0|People. This will be my 200th review. You would think it a cause for celebration, however, things are not always what they seem to be. And do remember this because it is a motif of this selection, which we will discuss later. Anyway, after a little over 4 years, I find myself struggling to be upwardly mobile in rank. I was just about to give up and work towards last place when I met this man who said he had a way to \\"fix\\" the system (as if this system hasn't been \\"fixed\\" enough). He said \\"Don't you worry Metamorpho, you will be in first place within a month\\". Well people, your Metamorpho wasn't born yesterday, but desperation makes you do strange things (like believe a total stranger). So, it was arranged to meet him in a field in the midwest whereby he will give me the total success (I deserve so much) amongst my peers.<br /><br />Well I took a bus to meet him in some barren field. Nobody was around. He did say 2 o'clock, didn't he? Then, all of a sudden, I saw a crop duster appear out of the horizon. But, instead of stopping, it came right at me, diving at me, almost sawing off my Seers cap! It circled around and started to spray negative vote dust at your poor Metamorpho. I had to run, just like Cary Grant in....oh, what's that movie's name? Luckily, I threw a pebble into the engine motor, which crashed the plane. And, I was able to make my escape in a checkered cab I had arranged to meet me there. Very upsetting. So I made my way back to Chicago and stayed in George Kaplan's hotel room. Never met the man, but I pretended I was him since I had no money. So, I relaxed with a bubble bath and my trusty rubber duck. That guy in the crop duster must have been a quack! My rubber duck agreed.<br /><br />I finally emerged to check the in-room bar, pour myself a brandy, and recline on the king sized bed with my laptop to bring you, yet, another fine review from the feathered pen of Metamorpho! I know my fan base will be elated. Others will still need to buy tickets to my lectures. Do not worry. Special discount rates will apply. But enough of this - you did tune in to hear about this movie- didn't you?<br /><br />This is one of my all-time favorites. The genius of Hitchcock was never more in ample supply. Intiguing, engaging, the master gives you a ride you'll want to revisit time and time again. All the elements of suspense are present. The good guys, the bad guys, and the femme fatale who connects the dots, or possibly is the puzzle once removed from the puzzle. Knowing Hitchcock, it will all be perceived in his own good time.<br /><br />Cary Grant plays Roger Thornhill, a Madison Avenue executive who is accustomed to a finer reality in life. Inavertently, he is mistaken for someone else. A spy whom certain other spys are after. From there, all sorts of devious things begin to happen. They attempt to murder him, frame him for murder, and the police, as well as the spys chase him from state to state. From that point on it is a roller coaster of events that get him into even deeper hot water. Within this scenario, Hitchcock tears down the curtain sheltering American complacency, or human complacency as it were. Like Alice, Roger Thornhill is exposed to the other side of the mirror, and this ain't no wonderland folks.<br /><br />Hithcock keeps the action moving. And, that is one of the very things I like about this movie. There is always some new aspect and new reaction contributing to the journey. Cary (Roger Thornhill) is like a deer in headlights, having to adjust his position for every new nuance that comes up. Eva Marie Saint (who plays Eve Kendall) the elusive, but soon to be love interest of Roger Thornhill, is sheer perfection. Spy, double spy, or lover? The woven tapestry Hitchcock weaves is very dense indeed. It's akin to being an all-knowing Seer or poseur? You will figure out Eve, but never ME my babies!<br /><br />The espionage in this movie reigns supreme. Nothing is given away. The audience is drawn into Roger's worldand, as such, become just as puzzled by the events. The action moves from town to townsend, and we are caught in a web of confusion and are off balance time and time again. The bad guys are out to get Roger, the F.B.I. are out to use Roger, and Roger is out to get the girl. All these plots and subplots could make one very dizzy. Not for me though. Metamorpho carries with him a supply of Bonine. Very good for twists of plot.<br /><br />Nothing seems to be what it is. And, even the ending, in movies terms, is not what it appears to be. However, Hitchcock is such a master that it might as well be. I am constantly enamoured of what this man has done with the art of cinema. And, remember people, he did not have the advantage of CGI technology and digital maneuvers. This makes the movie all the more remarkable. Also, I forgot the motif of chance and the balance thereof. This movie is filled with the motif that, regardless of how much we feel are lives are set and controlled, a chance happening could come along to change all we have known. Fortunately, Hitchcock balances it all out. The pain and craziness that Roger endured resulted in a true love of his life. A happy ending? Yes, maybe. But look at all it took to get there.<br /><br />A true classic? Yes. And it still astounds me that Hitchcock never won an Oscar for Best Director. The man was a virtual genius in my eyes. So many movies. So many memorable scenes in many movies. His legacy lives and, Oscar or not, this movie is definitely one of his finest.<br /><br />Now, somebody PLEASE give me a hankerchief! I am hanging on Mt. Rushmore and George Washington is about to sneeze!!!<br /><br />Another fun and quirky review on the 200th milestone! - by Metamorpho (the wise people's choice!).ts.

B001GQ2TGA|5.0|Ordering was super easy. The item came in the time it said and it came in good shape.
B00275EGWY|5.0|Not going to reiterate what has been said already, but at every level this is a great piece of film-making.<br />It does not preach.<br />One scene after another, it is simply relentless.<br />If you have never been to countries like Iraq that have shattered infrastructures then you will experience the dust, filth, garbage, pollution, danger and insanity of the situation our soldiers face.<br />Always thought bomb disposal people have to be strange. Why would anyone do it?<br />I urge you to read the novel  \\"Eight lives down.\\"<br />This story is about a lot of things and has been brilliantly put together.<br />A thinking person will not forget it in a hurry, and for that alone , well done.
3822817015|5.0|This is a fantastic book; the essays are substantive and very informative about not only the artists but about the period they were working in, distinctions of high and low art, etc.  The pictures are excellent quality and profuse throughout.  An incredible value at the price, an essential book for all art collections and artists.
B000UBMWG4|5.0|Other reviewers have described what a wonderful production of the latest Director's cut is included with this package - I can only echo that - you have to see this movie in High Definition to really appreciate it.  For me though, the purchase is justified by the lengthy (several hours long) documentary included, which describes the history of the movie from inception to eventual commercial success.  This is an astonishing story of the last, great non-CGI special effects movie ever made, and includes generous contributions from virtually everyone involved from producers and director down to extras.  I'm no film buff, and don't normally watch such extras, but I was spellbound by the story of how this remarkable film was made (and very nearly not made!) and amazed at the wonderful little facts and stories peppered thoughout (who would have thought that the film almost starred Dustin Hoffman rather than Harrison Ford!).    Also included are a wealth of other materials, including amazing offcuts and extra scenes which give an insight into the fuller story of Blade Runner.  Was Decker an android? - watch this and make your own mind up...
B002U6CJCE|4.0|The first Universal Soldier is, and has always been one of my favorite action movies of all time.  And although this one has many differences from its original, it did not dissapoint an avid fan like me.  For a direct to video feature, I was very impressed with the overall look, and feel of the movie.  If you're looking for action, you will very happy with this one.  The fights have been updated.  Gone are the slow motion roundhouses, and somewhat predictable Van Damme fight scenes.  The battles are quick, realistic, and very violent (thumbs up).  But I should say, for fans of the original like myself hoping to see a continuing story will be dissapointed.  There is no mention, or connection to the events of the first US, other than Lundgren, and his time is short lived. Whitch is a shame because he was an awesome villian in the first.  Add to that, the ending is very open ended, and you are left with no closure on Van Damme's character of Luc.  However, if that means another sequel, I won't complain.  Van Damme's still got it!
0575083093|4.0|This book is a classic hard-core sci adventure.  There are intergalactic space ships, cyborgs, ancient alien races, incredible weaponry, tonnes of gadgetry descriptions, and universe wide stakes.  What it lacks is good characterization, realistic dialog, and human emotion.  The characters are all 2-d and pretty much without motivation.  Also, I was disappointed to read 'monologuing' by the ubervillian.  Monologuing is a term from the movie 'The Incredibles', and it is when the villain of a story stands around talking to the hero(es), who are usually in some kind of death trap, and proceeds to explain his motivation, any plot holes in the story, and occasionally gives the hero(es) enough information/time to gain victory.  And finally, the ending is a little weak, it kind of reminded of the borderline retarded Star Trek movie from 2009 and its red matter.<br /><br />But all in all, it is a worth while read if you like classic hard SF.
1595141979|5.0|I purchased this series along with several other teen vampire series for my 12 year old daughter.  She loved the Twilight series and any other paranormal book she can get her hands on.  Since she is not quite a young adult I read all her books, and then I let her read the books I approve of and the others go in our library for a few more years.  This series is definitely not appropriate for girls under 17 (maybe a mature 16 year old).  Although I am not a young adult(anymore), I loved the series and look forward to my daughter being able to read it as well.  I think the author was extremely creative in writing this new vampire world.  All the books have been great so far, and hard to put down.  I would already be reading the 4th book, but unfortunately doesn't arrive until tomorrow.
B000Q6GURU|5.0|Neither of us had heard of this movie when it came out but we saw a preview for it on another movie.  Given the way it was presented in the preview, I was expecting a cross between the comedic 'Snakes on a Plane' and some kind of titillating s&m thing; I mean Christina in bondage with tight shirt and panties?  Yowza.  Needless to say, my wife was not at all looking forward to seeing this one.<br /><br />This movie is nothing like that.  First off, Christina is anything but appealing in this movie.  She is greasy, beat-up, unwashed, and pathologically promiscuous.  You can almost see the stank lines radiating off her.  Second, there is nothing sexy about the movie.  The sex scene are just plain disturbing and very uncomfortable.  As far as comedy goes, there is very little.<br /><br />What the movie is though, is an emotionally engaging, interesting story acted supremely by everyone involved, with the exception of Justin Timberlake.  I mean for a singer, he does a good job; but he is acting with some of the elite talent in the world here so he is very much out of place.  The director keeps his bits to a minimum though, so it is not like he ruins the movie or anything.<br /><br />My wife and I found the characters to be very believable, and we developed feeling and empathy for them.  We found the story to be believable and engaging with the ring of truth about it.  Which is not surprising, for the director had taken elements from his own life and put them into the characters.  Also the ending was really good, it wasn't your typical 'and they lived happily ever after' romcom bs.<br /><br />In short, this is one of those rare movies that had me caring about the characters and feeling for them, and not feeling let down by the ending.
B001L63O1E|5.0|It's always hard to know how to get into a band you may be unfamiliar with. I have followed Yes since 1975 and this is easily my favorite Yes album containing a great sampling of what they do best. From here I branched out into Close to the Edge, Fragile, Relayer, Yessongs, Tales... but, in my opinion, this is the place to start.
B0030BYWKK|5.0|My experience of Midlake is almost the opposite of some reviewers.  I was blown away by Van Occupanther and was looking for more of the same.  I got the bands earlier releases and couldn't stand them - this was the same band?!  Thought I was over Midlake.  Then I read a review of The Courage Of Others and decided to give it a spin.  It met and then exceeded my expectations!  My son listens to a lot of different stuff and he too was hooked on Van Occupanther.  He said because it was one of the few albums that created a consistent mood throughout.  When he was in a certain mood, it was a fav album to turn to.  This collection of songs fulfills the vision of V.O. even further.  I'm pretty sure that was the point, and what they were striving for.  If you don't get it, you just don't.
B00123MCB4|4.0|Yes' first album is often overlooked, but carries a lot of weight. To my taste, superior to Time and a Word their next album, although clearly eclipsed by The Yes album and most everything after. Nice jazz riffs. Creative. Their ultimate sound is clearly heard in this root album. There are clips of some of this material on You Tube; if you like that, you will certainly be pleased, as I am with this album.
B002XTBEDI|4.0|I enjoyed \\"Return to Cranford\\" very much, more so after the second viewing.  During the first viewing I was a little distracted by thinking about \\"what happened to so and so?\\" Also, the two new families are introduced a bit too quickly and so I didn't fully get into their characters until the second time around.  Like the first Cranford, this second installment has humor, sadness, the testing of friendships, the struggle between the old and the new and a sweet romance between two young people.  At first it bothered me that Dr. Harrison wasn't around, but then I thought about it.  How many period films continue a love story after the marriage?  Also, a huge part of the story in the first Cranford was the misunderstanding of Dr. Harrison's affections, so once that was resolved and he and Sophie were married, his story was told.  I really didn't see him being the heroic younger doctor again in Return to Cranford.  That was done enough in the first installment and it wouldn't have been as compelling in the second one.  In Return to Cranford, I absolutely loved the touching romance between William and Peggy.  He was so handsome, kind and resolved, and she showed that she was wise and strong in spite of her social awkwardness.  A few things keep me from giving this piece a 5 star review.  Perhaps I'll understand it better after more viewings, but I couldn't figure out exactly what happened with Harry and the estate.  Did he lose his inheritance?  I thought this story line was confusing and lacking in resolution.  Also, why was Mary gone in the beginning?  I didn't fully understand where she was and I thought it was strange to bring her back just to have her leave again.  Also, Mattie is almost financially destitute in the first Cranford, yet in this one, she has been able to save up a fairly large amount of money.  Is this because her brother Peter has his own income and contributes to her support?  I wasn't sure.  I was a bit disappointed in the ending, feeling it to beoverly sentimental.  It seemed odd to me that characters who probably wouldn't even know how to dance (specifically Peggy and Harry) were dancing like old pros.  In spite of these minor irritations, Return to Cranford is definitely a movie I will keep and watch several more times in the future.
0375507256|5.0|I wouldn't say this is one of the best books I've read, but it was one of the most enjoyable.  It has a contemplative style that reminds me of Murakami's [[ASIN:0099448785 Hardboiled Wonderland and the End of the World]], Yehoshua's [[ASIN:0156011166 A Journey to the End of the Millennium - A Novel of the Middle Ages]] or perhaps Rushdie's [[ASIN:0140366504 Haroun and the Sea of Stories (Puffin Books)]].  Like the Murakami, it also has a dash of humor.  The book has an interesting structure with a variety of voices.
B000BYA4JM|3.0|Loudon Trott (Griffin Dunne) is a Manhattan Tax Attorney engaged to debutante Wendy Worthington. He is frantically preparing for the big wedding, but first he has to pick up a cat for eccentric millionaire Montgomery Bell, and Wendy's father commands him to make sure that a certain Nikki Finn (Madonna), who is being released from the slammer, gets on the bus and leaves town. Piece of cake. The project was undoubtedly pitched as an 80's update of the 30's comedies like Howard Hawks' 1938 Bringing Up Baby. Seems like a smart bet for a whacky screw ball comedy, but in hindsight you'll be asking: Is it possible for the producers to be any dumber?<br /><br />Who's that girl who ruined this movie? Madonna. While she actually won an ASCAP award for the title song, also nominated for a Grammy and a Golden Globe,  her acting won her a Razzie for worst performance, and Razzie nominations for worst film, worst script, worst director, and one of the other songs was nominated for worst song. The script was pretty bad, with enough holes to drive a UPS truck through--but mostly it was Madonna who's to blame. From the moment we first see her released from the slammer we know that she is going to stink, big time.<br /><br />------------<br />Prison Officer: One black leather jacket, one plastic comb, blue, two studded leather bracelets, black, and one lipstick, fire engine red.<br />Donovan: [sarcastically] All your worldly possessions.<br />Nikki Finn: [speaking of the lipstick] Don't knock it, Donovan. You can't get this shade `a red anymore.<br />==============<br /><br />If she had been left in the slammer instead of released, we might have had something. The Magic that was Madonna in the 80's just doesn't translate to the medium of film. \\"Desperately Seeking Susan\\" was a fluke that worked because it used her in very small doses essentially playing herself, but surprise, surprise, I guess it wasn't Sean Penn who was to blame for the failure of \\"Shanghai Surprise\\" after all. Penn was supposed to play the lead in this turkey also, but after seeing the rushes they shanghaied him--ditched him and hitched their wagon to Madonna's star. Brilliant. Absolutely brilliant. Anyone could see that Penn had a one way ticket to Palooka Ville while Madonna was on Starlight Express.<br /><br />It seems her persona was meant to be a strange concoction of Betty Boop, Marilyn Monroe, and Mae West, with her own unique fashion sense--or maybe a punked out Judy Holliday--but on the big screen it just looked hideous. That is no beauty mark, Madonna, that is a mole, even if it was painted on. Her roots were showing--on purpose! Was that meant to be trashy but chic? Frida Kahlo called, and she wants her eyebrows back. I was aghast at how hideous Madonna looked and how badly she acted. Madonna has won 9 Razzies for worst actress, including 2000's uncoveted Worst Actress of the Century Razzie. She is truly in a league of her own. Other than that, Mrs. Lincoln, how did you like the play?<br /><br />Veteran actor and Oscar winner Sir John Mills (Ryan's Daughter, 1970) lent the film a certain gravitas that it didn't deserve. As eccentric millionaire Montgomery Bell he sends Loudon Trott to the docks to pick up his cat. It turns out to be a rare and endangered breed of cougar that Trott totes around for most of the film. I couldn't understand what Sir John Mills' character was even doing in the movie, other than providing an excuse for Madonna to show that even if the movie success that Cher has garnered has thus far eluded her, she, not Cher, is the true Queen of the Cougars.

Kind of like a Tax Attorney thrust into the craziness of Nikki Finn's life. One was a successful independent film that showed you can accomplish a lot on a small budget with clever directing and writing, but the other was a big budget film, supposed to be a star vehicle for Madonna, with horrible writing and directing. After the \\"After Hours\\" screening Griffin Dunne mentioned an upcoming film project with Madonna. He was on that Merry Go Round, reaching for that brass ring...<br /><br />Little did Griffin know that after this debacle, his acting career would pretty much be Dunne.<br /><br />----------<br />Wendy Worthington: Is it possible for you to be any dumber?<br />Buck: I-I don't see how.<br />==================<br /><br />[[ASIN:B001VPCINK The Great Buck Howard]] (2008) Griffin Dunne was Jonathan Finerman<br />[[ASIN:B001MEJYA0 Marie and Bruce]] (2004) Griffin Dunne was Restaurant Guest<br />[[ASIN:B00007L4OE Swept Away]] (2002) Madonna was Amber<br />[[ASIN:B00000F6N8 Naked in New York]] (1993) Griffin Dunne was Auditioner<br />[[ASIN:B00005T7I1 Dick Tracy]] (1990) Madonna was Breathless Mahoney<br />[[ASIN:B0001IN0QW Bloodhounds of Broadway]] (1989) Madonna was Hortense Hathaway<br />[[ASIN:B00009NHAJ Shanghai Surprise]] (1986) Madonna was Gloria Tatlock<br />[[ASIN:0792845773 Desperately Seeking Susan]] (1985) Madonna was Susan<br />[[ASIN:B000286RNE After Hours]] (1985) Griffin Dunne was Paul Hackett<br />Des Teufels Advokat (1977) John Mills was Blaise Meredith<br />[[ASIN:B000CBG5PQ Ryan's Daughter (Two-Disc Special Edition)]] (1970) John Mills was Michael<br />Britannia of Billingsgate (1933) John Mills was Fred Bolton<br /><br />------------<br />Cabbie #3: Oh, hang on.

Kind of like a Tax Attorney thrust into the craziness of Nikki Finn's life. One was a successful independent film that showed you can accomplish a lot on a small budget with clever directing and writing, but the other was a big budget film, supposed to be a star vehicle for Madonna, with horrible writing and directing. After the \\"After Hours\\" screening Griffin Dunne mentioned an upcoming film project with Madonna. He was on that Merry Go Round, reaching for that brass ring...    Little did Griffin know that after this debacle, his acting career would pretty much be Dunne.     ----------  Wendy Worthington: Is it possible for you to be any dumber?

B002IEY1XS|5.0|This is an amazing movie! Watching this movie on blu-ray version is a truly magical experience. The colors are very vibrant, and the clarity is pristine. It's an wildly entertaining movie that has that mysterious, dark, imaginative quality you would find in movies such as Corpse Bride, Edward Scissor Hands,  etc. This is definitely a movie for artists who have a deep appreciation for the dedication it takes to make a movie like this. Watching the behind the scenes features, you will discover that this entire movie was made by hand using stop motion animation. Stop motion has a certain quality that you just can't get out of a pixar movie. It's very organic and is really a hands on approach to 3D movies. Watching this movie in 3D on Blu-ray is far behind watching it on a regular CRT TV. I highly recommend it!    Brian Rodgers Jr.  Photographer/Digital Artist
B00092ZMDY|5.0|This was one of, if not the best, concert DVDs I've seen and I own about 20!  They played everything you'd want to hear.  It was neat how they played each others songs (Walsh, Henley and Eagles songs).  The 2nd disc was particularly good, they really jammed.  The acoustic section was a nice break between the semi-mellow 1st half and the rocking 2nd half.  Schmitt, Frey and Walsh were the most entertaining on stage and Stueart Smith is a surprisingly good guitarist, I'd never heard of him.  Walsh's \\"Life's Been Good\\" was fun and he jammed.  Recommended for other 70s rock fans, but particularly Eagles fans!
0061537969|3.0|The good things: Great metaphor for negotiating tough times.  I love dogs and loved ol' Enzo.  Quick read..  And it did make me cry. I am an easy mark..  I will remember it.    The work could have been a very tight short story which would have rescued me from skimming repetitive racing analogies. One or two would have done the trick. In fact, it would have been a fabulous short story. As it was, it lingered around the turns like a dune buggy and like Nicholas Sparks--somewhat overwrought.
B002QGUFWE|4.0|Was very much looking forward to this double-CD set of Lady GaGa's first 2 releases.  She does not disappoint, in spite of The Fame Monster only including 8 cuts.  Probably would have liked to have known ahead of time thought that the version of \\"Bad Romance\\" was the edited version, not the uncensored version that can be heard and seen on her web site.
B002ZHKZEC|3.0|The Doctor (David Tennat) has more lives than a cat. In his current 10th incarnation The Doctor battles Cybermen with another Doctor during the Industrial Age in England, takes a double decker from London to a arid planet with a thief (guest star Michelle Ryan of \\"The Bionic Woman\\"), tries to avoid infection by a deadly virus with the first explorers on Mars (with \\"Rome\\" star Lindsay Duncan)and faces his greatest nemesis The Master (\\"Life on Mars\\" star John Simms returning to the role he played in episodes of the \\"New\\" \\"Doctor Who\\")in these TV specials that aired prior to the forthcoming 5th season.<br /><br />The specials are a bit uneven. \\"Waters of Mars\\" creates quite a bit of suspense and the ending is quite moving giving Tennant more emotional range to play with as The Doctor than he has before. Likewise the two part \\"The End of Time\\" gives Tennant more to play as The Doctor as he realizes his end is near; there's a weariness here that was only hinted at before in his performance but there's also a strong sense that The Doctor isn't ready to go into his 11th incarnation just yet. \\"The Next Doctor\\" (the first of the specials to air during Christmas 2008)is geared a bit more towards the kids but is still enjoyable. \\"The Next Doctor\\" and \\"Planet of the Dead\\" are probably the two weaker specials presented here although both are enjoyable and Michelle Ryan performance makes you wish that she was a regular on the series. Nevertheless, all of them are nothing short of entertaining and writer/producer Russell T. Davies (who co-wrote the first two specials with other writers)brings his characteristic quirky personality to each of the scripts.<br /><br />The two part \\"The End of Time\\" also benefits from a cameo by Timothy Dalton. The long, extended conclusion might have been a tad too sentimental for some Who fans but it shouldn't have come as a surprise to those who have seen Davies' work before.<br /><br />Three of the four specials here (which run a little over an hour except the two part \\"The End of Time\\") are all shot in high def (a first for \\"Doctor Who\\" which was shot in standard definition video for its first four seasons) EXCEPT \\"The Next Doctor\\" which was also shot in standard def and has been upscaled for high definition here (the box does disclose this info on the back). As a result, \\"The Next Doctor\\" looks a bit softer than the other specials here. The rest of the specials look terrific.<br /><br />The extras include \\"Doctor Who Confidential\\", promos, David Tennant's \\"Video Diary\\" and a couple of other worthwhile odds and ends. \\"Doctor Who: The Complete Specials\\" may not be considered the \\"real\\" 5th season of the series (and they aren't exactly movies either as each one runs too short that)but for all intents and purposes these specials play like a mini 5th season allowing Tennant and Davies to gracefully say goodbye to a popular character that they had loads of fun with and close off Tennant's rein as The Doctor for audiences.<br /><br />This is a nice set although a bit overpriced IMHO (compare this to a season of \\"Lost\\" on Blu-ray for example where you get 20 plus episodes for the same price in many instances)but still recommended as the high def presentation looks quite nice and the extras are very good.he End of Time\\") are all shot in high def (a first for \\"Doctor Who\\" which was shot in standard definition video for its first four seasons) EXCEPT \\"The Next Doctor\\" which was also shot in standard def and has been upscaled for high definition here (the box does disclose this info on the back).

B002WY65W4|4.0|Zombies are such high maintence. You have to walk them. You have to give them a double tap if you want to kill them. You  have to be careful because they bite (and then eat you). It's a wonder they survive in \\"Zombieland\\" a horror comedy that is so good I was sure Hollywood had adapted a graphic novel (it couldn't possibly be an original script if it's THAT funny could it?). Where did all the zombies come from? Blame a hamburger infested with Mad Cow Disease hanging with bacteria from an AM/PM type minimart.<br /><br />\\"Zombieland\\" may take its inspiration from \\"Shaun of the Dead\\" and the original \\"Dawn of the Dead\\" but it quickly develops its own quirky personality. \\"Zombieland\\" strikes just the right balance between humor and gore and manages to be something other than your average B movie in the process. Well directed by Ruben Fleischer from a script originally written as a TV pilot by Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick (with uncredited rewrites by William Goldman the writer behind such classics as \\"Marathon Man\\", \\"Butch Cassidy and The Sundance Kid\\"), \\"Zombieland\\" will have you chuckling particularly the joke buried at the end of the credits between Harrelson and his one time co-star (I don't want to spoil which celebrity makes a cameo appearence).<br /><br />The Blu-ray is a bloody mess in a good way. Colors and skin tones are dead on (even for the zombies), detail remarkably good and the movie has some light grain to give it a film-like appearence (it was shot on HD video). This is a top notch Blu-ray transfer and I imagine that the regular DVD probably looks quite good as well (although I haven't seen it)<br /><br />The special features are the same for both the DVD and Blu-ray with one notable exception. We get a traditional commentary track featuring Woody Harrelson, Ruben Flesicher, Jessie Eisenberg and writers Rhett Reese & Paul Wernick. They discuss everything from the changes made in the original script when it was clear it wasn't going to be a TV pilot to a theatrical movie to ad libs. We also get a PIP (picture-in-picture) that takes us behind-the-scenes as we watch the movie including animatics and how the various physical effects were done as well.<br /><br />\\"Zombieland Is Your Land\\" a glimpse into how the U.S. became \\"zombiefied\\" (yeah, I made the word up). We also get a behind-the-scenes featurette on the making of the movie \\"In Search of Zombieland\\" as well as the original theatrical promo trailers.<br /><br />Exclusive to Blu-ray in addition to the PIP feature we get \\"Movie IQ\\" allowing you to access real time trivia on the movie.<br /><br />Best Buy have included a DVD with two featurettes (this is the special \\"Nutt Up or Shut Up Edition\\"). \\"Shootin' Zombies with Ruben Fleischer\\" gives the director room to talk about creating the opening sequence and other bits of info. We also see some amusing bits that didn't make the opening. The second featurette is \\"Behind the Scenes with the Cast and Crew of Zombieland\\" a decent featurette that expands on the behind-the-scenes featurette included on the regular DVD and Blu-ray editions of the movie.<br /><br />SYNPOSIS BELOW (BEWARE OF MINOR SPOILERS):<br /><br />The survivors of this meat sack landscape call each other by the towns they are from so as not to get too personally involved if, say, they have to ditch them or a kill them later. \\"Columbus\\"(Jessie Eisenberg) a college student who really dislikes people and discovers that when most of them are gone he really misses them. Columbus has survived by creating a series of rules when it comes to dealing with people, zombies, bathrooms and escape routes. When he meets Tallahassee (Woody Harrelson)while on the road back to his family the two strike up an unusual bond becoming buddies (well sort of). Tallahasse has two things on his mind-1) killing zombies and 2) finding a Twinkie--and a Snoball just WON'T do. The duo may have met their match in Wichita (Emma Stone) and Little Rock (Abigail Breslin)con artist sisters whohave managed to survive the plague with one goal--to go to a zombie free amusement park in California.<br /><br />\\"Zombieland\\" is funner than a shooting gallery. Highly recommended.zombie free amusement park in California.    \\"Zombieland\\" is funner than a shooting gallery. Highly recommended.

0385737424|4.0|A young girl and her brother are approached by three strange women. They are then taken on a journey through time and space to rescue a father they barely knew. It was a dangerous and thrilling journey, but it was also just a story. A story about family and adventure and time travel. Which is possible, according to Marcus, at least in theory.<br /><br />Miranda's life was simple, she had her mother and she had Sal, her best friend. What more could she want? Then one day something happened to change all that. For no apparent reason Sal got hit, Sal stopped talking to her, and a letter arrived.<br /><br />Other letters soon followed about things that had yet to happen, that had already happened. Could the lives of two people really lie in Miranda's hands; a twelve year old who had just lost her best friend and was all but alone in the world? But as we see there is more then one way to save a life...<br /><br />When You Reach Me is a circular story that is deeply thoughtful, philosophical and also just about a girl. 'Tell me a story' the letters had said, and she did. Miranda's story is simply about life, about friendships, about growing up and making mistakes. And also about time-travel.
006621131X|3.0|How someone can write an entire book and remain completely oblivious of her own part in her life's failures, while apparently trying to be introspective, is amazing. First Patti chooses Mapplethorpe, who vacillates between her and affairs with guys, then a married man (Sam Shepherd) and then a rock star who is gone all the time and cheats on her. Talk about choosing unavailable men!<br /><br />Then she writes this book in tribute to Mapplethorpe, a guy who didn't think enough of her to even bequeath any of his artwork or belongings to her (she wistfully remembers his desk and slippers, which were sold at auction), and comments that she has his letters to remember him by--this, a guy who owned a half-million dollar place in Manhattan, and knew she was constantly scraping by and trying to avoid starvation! A guy who let her support him as he tried, unsuccessfully, to interest anybody in buying his art! Grumble.<br /><br />Reading a book by someone with so little self-esteem, no boundaries whatsoever (she drifts into drug use with no explanation after spending her life refusing them), no sense of self (she appears to identify only with people she meets, and her clothes) is interesting but depressing.<br /><br />Obviously smart, I wanted to just grab her half-way through the book and say: get a grip! Become your own person, not just a mirror for guys!<br /><br />As a book illustrating how women's passivity can toss them here and there through life at the whim of men, it's perfect.
030738683X|5.0|A few years ago, I decided to read all of Jane Austen's novels. Not surprisingly, my favorite was Pride and Prejudice, but my #2 choice was her little-known book Northanger Abbey.  Northanger Abbey was published after Austen's death, though it was written much earlier.  It's a bit different from her other works.  It is a very good parody and satire of the financial considerations of marriage among English gentry of the time, as well as of the then popular Gothic literature.    Catherine is different from the typical heroine.  She is very ordinary, and not at all heroic.  She's rather naive, somewhat ignorant, pleasant-looking but not beautiful. She's grown up one of ten children in a parsonage, but gets the chance to go with family friends to visit Bath.  She doesn't have men falling at her feet, and actually has only one real suitor other than the hero. She wants to see the best in people and is easily misled as to the character of a friend, even when we can see that she's almost wilfully blind.  She's enthralled with Gothic literature and when circumstances take her to a forbidding abbey, partially in ruins, her imagination is prone to running away from her.    Austen's parodying of Gothic literature and the travails of the marriage market is outstanding.  I love dry humor, and this book is rife with it, much more than Austen's others.  A few samples:     \\"When the hour of departure drew near, the maternal anxiety of Mrs. Morland will be naturally supposed to be most severe.  A thousand alarming presentiments of evil to her beloved Catherine from this terrific separation must oppress her heart with sadness, and drown her in tears for the last day or two of their being together;...  Cautions against the violence of such noblemen and baronets as delight in forcing young ladies away to some remote farmhouse, must, at such a moment, relieve the fulness of her heart.  Who would not think so?  But Mrs. Morland knew so little of lords and baronets, that she entertained no notion of their general mischievousness, and was wholly unsuspicious of danger to her daughter from their machinations.  Her cautions were confined to the following points. `I beg, Catherine, you will always wrap yourself up very warm about the throat, when you come from the Rooms at night; and I wish you would try to keep some account of the money you spend....'\\"    \\"Under these unpromising auspices, the parting took place, and the journey began.  It was performed with suitable quietness and uneventful safety.  Neither robbers nor tempests befriended them, nor one lucky overturn to introduce them to the hero.  Nothing more alarming occurred than a fear on Mrs. Allen's side, of having once left her clogs behind her at an inn, and that fortunately proved to be groundless.\\"    I would definitely recommend this book to any who have enjoyed Austen's other books, but also to those who enjoy satire or dry humor.  While relatively unknown, this is, in my opinion, one of Austen's best.

B0000524CY|5.0|It is truely rare for a film to transend its plot, its genre. I am sure besides The Exorcist, there are examples, but I have thought hard and none come to mind<br /><br />What does come to mind is that when  see this film at the video store in the horror section, I just have to laugh. Horror is great, but calling Billy Friedkin's Exorcist horror is like calling the Beatles a rock and roll group or Picasso a painter--true but in grand context totally meaningless.<br /><br />And even that does not hold water. The Beatles and Picasso worked in their genres to define them. Exorsist takes elements of horror, but goes completely outside the box of horror fights or horror cheese.<br /><br />A priest digs up an idol on a archeology site in Iraq. He knows he has found something evil, forces he cannot put back. Soon, in Georgetown Washington, a sweet little girl, daughter of a film star, develops what seems to be a psychiatric illness. She morphs, slowly, into a sexualized monster.<br /><br />This is what we think at first, and so does her mother. But she is not the monster. The monster is the devil himself. The mother does not know this, and after extensive psychological and medical treatment, goes to see a priest. The mother knows something even more awful--far more awful-than disease has taken her daugter. She is proven right when the beast comes out of the little girl and kills two priests during the exorsism, one having a crisis of faith, the other the priest who excavated the idol in Iraq.<br /><br />This was 1973, which is part of the reason the Exorcist works so amazingly on so many levels. Horror was becoming more serious, graphic, and better made in the 1970s.<br /><br />Friendkin, though, removes the always implied fiction of the genre . We are so sucked into the idea this child has a grave mental illness, it becomes plausable that she is in fact had by Satan himself.<br /><br />Even the most secularized viewer of the Exorcist will feel the fear of this prospect. Dark nights, cold rooms, the mother being totally alone in the house: all the conventions that make standard horror creepy, and define it in our minds as fiction, are given concrete and awful reality. If it can happen to a film star in  a major US city in 1973, it can happen to any of us. The devil is real.<br /><br />Evil exists, The Exorsist tells us, and can strike randomly at any time. We beleive it.<br /><br />1973 was David Bowie, key clubs, Watergate: Check out a film set in that year called [[ASIN:B000056BSG The Ice Storm]] to get a fantastic sense of 1973, then juxtapose it with the Exorcist. Even the most straight suburbanite was getting more secularized. You'll see in Ice Storm that the counter-culture was seeping to the mainstream. God, the intellectuals thought, was dead. There was no evil or good, just relative behavior.<br /><br />I embrace secular  society: if you don't, look at Iran or Taliban Afganistan: but that is my point. The Exorcist is powerful enough as both fiction and theory to make you question if there is a force of true evil: a devil liberal rock and rollers like me dismiss as arcane as which trials or deeming mental illness a crime.<br /><br />Friedkin is sticking it to us here in the most primal of ways: no good, no evil, like your textbooks, your encounter groups, your psychoanalysis?<br /><br />HAVE THIS.ne in the house: all the conventions that make standard horror creepy, and define it in our minds as fiction, are given concrete and awful reality.

B001LRJH0U|5.0|You probably know what Western films are like- cowboys get shot up like crazy, they fall off their horse (or off the bar stool) and die, you never actually see anyone come by and pick up the dead bodies, or bury them, and you never see any kind of emotion or concern for the people who got shot to death in dramatic fashion either (for the most part anyway).    Appaloosa includes ALL those things, in additon to that, it does a tremendous job keeping the storyline interesting.  It's about two cowboys who take over a small, dusty town (of course) and whether they were supposed to be playing the good or bad guys... I haven't a clue.  Everyone seems to be a bad guy in a Western anyway because of complete lack of emotion for human life.    Renee Zellweger shows us once again that she can portray *anyone* in a convincing way and make it believable.  Ed Harris steals the show with his character though- truly not someone you'd wanna mess with.      The only problem is that the ending tried to sum up the story, but it was a bit on the boring side if you ask me.  The shooting segments that appear throughout the film however, are quite good.  The scene in particular involving a train and Renee's character was probably the one that stood out the most to me.    Another Western perhaps, but this one might win you over.  I'm no expert when it comes to Westerns, so it's hard for me to tell which ones work for people, and which ones don't.
B002XTBE6K|5.0|I approach my Jane Austen adaptations as I do productions of Shakespeare....each will bring their own view to the story, each emphasizing different aspects.  Some will more true to the original text, some less so....and unless they violate the spirit of the original (sadly like Mansfield Park), I take each one on its own merits. This Emma may not follow Austen's text exactly, but in my opinion it was one of the most enjoyable Emma, or for that matter Jane Austen, productions I have seen. In retrospect, previous movies/series have been beautifully done...but this was both beautiful and the most emotionally engaging.     Ramola Garai is a lively Emma that, after early reservations due to her more modern manners, grew on me as the series progressed...much as Emma does in the book itself.  Emma's maturation over the course of the series is more believable and more evident here than in any other Emma adaptation I have seen.  Any hesitation I may have had about the casting of Emma faded as I watched the series - and the scene where she realizes she loves Mr. Knightley, but has potentially lost him due to her own actions was an incredible piece of acting on the part of Ms. Garai.    Ms. Garai's chemistry with Jonny Lee Miller is palpable and believable. My highest compliment of all is reserved for JLM: he is, by far, my favorite Knightley of all time...and this is from a huge Jeremy Northam fan (forgive me!).  He was the first I've seen to strike the perfect chord between the character's big brotherly scolding and his dawning realization of his true feeligns towards Emma. Incredibly subtle acting which conveyed more of this somewhat opaque character's inner workings than I could have imagined possible.
B0013TPV0Q|3.0|I love David Sedaris, but this book felt darker and less funny to me.

B002KSPKRS|5.0|Echoing what others have said, these headphones are truly a great product, but they're not without their cons (although they're minor).<br /><br />CONS<br />* The adjustable sound for voicechat versus overall game chat seems wonky at best -- the volume of others' speech is either almost non-existent or much too loud.<br />* The boom mic is unreliable.  I feel like I'm going unheard frequently -- the onscreen indicator for when you're chatting does not seem to be as reliable as the standard chat headset.<br />* The cans are made of comfortable material but the design does not work well for glasses wearers.  Over time, they'll cause them to dig into the side of your head and at least in my case, can cause my ears to become somewhat tender after an extended session.  This is likely a product of all headphones of this type but I've never used them previously so I can't say for sure.<br />* The battery life is somewhat spotty.  I believe they say you'll get about 25 hours out of two AAAs but that seems a bit high from my experience over the past few weeks.<br /><br />PROS<br />* Everything else.<br /><br />They make a significant difference in your ability to hear ambient sounds and in a game like Modern Warfare 2 where the opponents' footsteps are crucial in the online environment, these things can literally be a \\"lifesaver.\\"  In addition to that scenario, as with so many others, their primary function is that they allow me to play a game while my girlfriend sleeps.  I no longer have to turn the volume all the way down and negate much of my involvement with the game (be it online or single player).  The sound quality is stunning and if you're currently playing with just default TV speakers as I was, the difference is absolutely night and day.<br /><br />For anyone who has a video game system in a room that they share with others, these things are worth their weight in gold.  It's not a cheap product by any means (the $20 savings on Amazon is appreciated), but if you can afford to spend the money, I would heartily recommend them.mmend them.

B002YIHO7I|4.0|There is no question that we've seen a lot of comebcaks in R&B this past year from artists who've been out of the spotlight for a long time that've caught our musical eyes and ears. Last year, it was strong in returns with Maxwell and his return with BlackSummers'night after spending 8 years away from the spotlight and Whitney Houston with her #1 platinum-selling I Look To You after being out of the public eye for 7 years. This year, it is Sade's turn. It has honestly been 10 years since her last album, Lovers' Rock and 8 years since her live album Lovers' Live. Yet, when she does make album, Sade said that she'll only do it when she has something to honestly say. 25 years since her debut, Sade shows that her look and her voice haven't changed. But does the new album work? Here is that answer.<br /><br />Sade's latest album, 2010's Soldier Of Love stays mostly true to her distinctive sound and melodic and simple voice. The collection of songs mainly remains simple and melodic to her true to her voice, while the songs are arranged to be simple and easy to listen to during a difficult day. The songs range from her title track, Soldier Of Love, to the simple Bring Me Home, the reggae-mixed Babyfather, all the way to end on tracks like Skin and the short less than 3 minute ballad The Safest Place. Sade's voice is cleraly shown, but I honestly do have one big gripe about Soldier Of Love. My one and only gripe is that I was honestly hoping for a few more upbeat songs that show a deeper rhythm to her songs, only to add a bit more feeling into the album.<br /><br />Nevertheless, it still feels good to hear Sade sing again. Soldier Of Love stays true for hard core Sade fans, but doesn't feel completely definitive for anyone whom has never heard the Smooth Operator's style. I honestly like the album, but I was deeply hoping for a bit more from the Soldier Of Love that Sade has shown to be in her charm and her voice all these years. I recommend the record for anyone whom needs a escape away from the current pop music scene that has been too much about the wannabe acts and overexposed divas like Rihanna and Beyonce'. Soldier Of Love isn't a bad escape from the reality of today and its troubles.<br /><br />Album Cover: B+<br /><br />Songs: B-<br /><br />Price: B-<br /><br />Mastering: B 1/2+<br /><br />Overall: B 1/2-rom the current pop music scene that has been too much about the wannabe acts and overexposed divas like Rihanna and Beyonce'.

B002WY65W4|4.0|I truly enjoyed this movie about the adventures of 4 people on the road as they travel through a sort of post apocalyptic zombie infested USA.  The cast did all they could be expected to do with this sort of silliness (and the Bill Murray cameo is unforgettable).<br /><br />Gosh, what can I say that can convey why I liked this film. . .  Perhaps it is the innocence.  All of the people are fundamentally decent (a little grifting aside); they all basically care about one another; and they manage to create a family with what little is left of the world.<br /><br />All the blood and gore aside, you just gotta love that.<br /><br />Having said all that, I have to say that I thought the basic structure of the story was well done, too.  The editing was very effective, without being distracting.  I loved the costuming and makeup (who doesn't love zombie makeup??).  Some of my family members have been involved in mock disaster drills (in full disaster victim makeup, or moulage as they call it), and as soon as we saw the zombies, we all shouted \\"Moulage!\\"  The zombies were excellently done.<br /><br />I understand that the final scene was shot in freezing weather, tho they were supposed to be in southern California.  Hats off to the cast for not shivering, too!<br /><br />If you want an evening of family fun (though gruesome), this is a good movie for you.
B0036EH3UC|5.0|Fifty years ago, humanity's robotic servant Cylons suddenly turned on their masters, and vanishes off into space after a terrible war.<br /><br />But of course the story doesn't stop -- and it turned out to be a rare case of a remake becoming spectacularly better than the source material. \\"Battlestar Galactica - The Complete Series\\" is a grimy, dark, violent and hopeful sci-fi adventure saga -- and while it has its ups and downs like any series, it's a brilliant and powerful piece of work.<br /><br />Forty years after the war's end, the Cylons unexpectedly return to the Twelve Colonies and start wiping out ships and cities. The Battlestar Galactica (an aging warship about to be turned into a museum) is forced to flee the world of Caprica with a collection of refugee-crammed ships, commanded by Commander William Adama (Edward James Olmos) and the new President Laura Roslin (Mary McDonnell).<br /><br />Now the people of the Twelve Colonies must find a new home -- their goal is Earth, a legendary planet with other humans on it. Unfortunately, they have been infiltrated by the treacherous scientist Gaius Baltar (James Callis), and a group of Cylons who are almost indistinguishable from human beings -- they even have emotions and can interbreed with humans.<br /><br />And their journey has its own perils: sabotage, assassination attempts, betrayals, shortages of water, food and fuel, the introduction of cruel martial law, religious conflict, the discovery of another surviving Battlestar called the Pegasus, and the overhanging fear of infiltration by the humanoid Cylons. And though they find a habitable (but miserable) planet, soon the ragtag fleet is forced to flee again -- and eventually discover that their goal is not what they hoped...<br /><br />Anyone expecting \\"Battlestar Galactica\\" to be a copy of its predecessor is going to be horribly disappointed. This is sci-fi at its most compelling -- a gritty, bleak, dark story of war and desperate escapes, and there are plenty of moral dilemmas (Roslin ordering the death of a baby Cylon/human hybrid). And it explores the truly compelling questions about what it is to be human and alive -- and to deserve to be.<br /><br />The writers wrap together hard SF with threads of mystical science fiction, and undertones of religion and philosophy. The writing is solid and snappy (\\"Old gods die hard\\"), but frequently lapses into dramatic, powerful speeches that barely manage to dodge being cheesy.  And each character is given an intricate and complex journey to follow, filled with pain, death, sorrow and slowly moving beyond their own personal problems. Friendships are pulled apart, alliances are formed, and lots of horrible and morally questionable choices are made. Some of these people are redeemed, some are destroyed, and some discover that they are not even human.<br /><br />Olmos and McDonnell are the powerful leaders in this story, and both actors do a brilliant job -- especially Mcdonnell with Roslin's breast cancer, and Olmos with his tragic past. The entire cast is pretty much brilliant -- Callis as the ever-changing Baltar, Michael Hogan as the unlikeable Saul Tigh, and Grace Park as a humanoid Cylon whose love changes her goals.  But the best ones are Katee Sackhoff as Kara \\"Starbuck\\" Thrace, and Tricia Helfer as the ethereal Cylon Number Six -- both women are deeply entwined with the search for Earth.<br /><br />The previous \\"complete series\\" release angered a lot of fans because it didn't include the \\"Plan\\" movie that shows some of the series' events from the Cylon point of view. This new double-dipper WILL have \\"The Plan\\" and new packaging added in -- but it apparently still won't have the \\"Face of the Enemy\\" webisodes. I don't know WHAT they are doing, honestly.<br /><br />\\"Battlestar Galactica: The Complete Series\\" is a stunning and powerful story that transcends the sci-fi label, and deserves to be praised to the skies.

0071636080|3.0|If you haven't read Presentation Zen, slide:ology and/or Brain Rules, then maybe you will find some interesting bits in this book. I can't complain about the messages in this book - everyone needs to learn how to be a better presenter. But like many business books, the twelve rules here could have been done in a long article instead of a short book. Then at least the author could have embedded video. There's a lot of fluff or irrelevant content (pictures of Jobs, tables of talk transcripts) that do little but pad the book. I'm a big Apple fan, but large parts of this book reads more like a Jobs love-fest than a presentation how-to.     Steve has a luxury most don't: he controls everything about his presentations and has the resources to present in the manner he finds will best get his message across. The vast majority of us do not have those luxuries. While there are a lot of great rules in the book, unless you are presenting something that is highly visual and have the artistic resources to procure vivid imagery, a lot of the particulars of the keynote's will be irrelevant.    There are simply better books on this topic elsewhere.
B000053VAF|5.0|The movie came in brand new store-wrapped goodness and no damage. It arrived soon after ordering.
B0011UCOGG|5.0|I loved the book. I hadnt read the last book for a while so I was wondering if I would even remember what was happening. Not a problem, I was quickly immersed in the continuing story and became very connected with the characters. Im only sorry that the next book is still not available. I would have bought it today!
0316010669|4.0|For certain decisions, such as determining how likable Tom Hanks is and determining a person's personality by looking in their rooms, our intuition is quite accurate.  For other decisions, such as predicting the success of a musician and falling for the good looks of a presidential candidate, our intuition often fails us.  Also, our preferences and why we do what we do often can not be articulated well and/or are rationalized in ways that don't make any sense.  For example, our verbally expressed preferences for a partner often don't jive with the actual partners we choose and our food product preferences are subject to marketing schemes but we are unaware of it.      In essence, the book mentions that our decisions are subject to prejudices, past experiences, ignorance, psycho-biology, preferences, expertise, and a whole slew of other variables.  In the beginning of the book, Gladwell states the premise that haste doesn't make waste and that sometimes quick decisions are better than decisions that have analyzed every angle.  But later in the book, Gladwell mentions how prejudices can cloud our judgment and how stepping back and analyzing the situation allowing time to be our friend is a better approach to making decisions, for example when a cop is faced with a potential criminal.  Also, he mentions how the body guards protecting former US president Reagan, didn't have enough time to react to the shooter who attempted to assassinate Reagan.  So the efficacy of our decisions are either benefited or hurt by snap decisions and benefited or hurt by longer more deliberated decision; the quality of our decisions depend on the context of the situation.      Essence of the essence: Decisions are based on a crapload of stuff.
B002JVWQSW|5.0|I'm in laugh a minute heaven every time I sit down to watch this show. I can't get over how clever all the scenes  and dialog are.It's even touching at moments without being clawing or syrupy.Everyone I've mentioned the show  to is as enthusiastic about it as I am.Can't believe there's not a dud in any of the episodes. Every actor in it  is amazing and believable, even the kids. The best cast I've ever seen to date.It's sure to win lots of awards in  the future next go round. If I had seen it before Glee finished their season, I would have been pulling for Modern  Family to win. I'm always last to watch something new, and it's the same with Modern Family, the loss is all mine,  and I can't wait till it's available on DVD for me to own my on copy.
1597801577|1.0|If you are an engineer or somebody who cares about the technology represented in a book, don't read this.  You will only be disappointed and annoyed.      Case in point:  the first chapter of the book takes place in a factory that produces springs used for energy storage.  The factory uses genetically engineered animals to turn crank shafts.  That produce electricity.  The electricity is also used to heat things with resistive elements.  For which the factory has to pay carbon credits.    As you can tell, that is absolute nonsense.  There are dozens of problems with that tech, starting with the energy storage in springs, and ending in the carbon credit cost of a process that doesn't produce any carbon.  And that doesn't even go into the green alternative tech that would make this factory a pathetic anachronism.      So if you like some minimal technical veracity in your science fiction, and if this sort of thing bothers you, skip this book.
B002TVQ4GW|1.0|In general, I love to watch any horror movies that involve the Bermuda Triangle. So when this movie came out, I was really excited to watch it. Like another reviewer on here, I quickly developed a headache that wouldn't quit, even after the movie had ended.    What didn't make sense was how the main female character could have 2 or more versions of herself walking around in the same reality. Nor did she ever once get everyone together in the same room, including the clone of herself, and try to figure this out. She spent more time running around the freaking ship than she did actually talking to anybody. And finally, no explanation is ever given as to how or why she got herself caught up in this in the first place. No explanation in why the ship is out there, nor why she keeps repeating the day/events over and over again. Why was it necessary to kill everyone? They just never explained a lot of things, and by the end of the movie, I just wanted to trash it.     Frankly, I was more upset with the main character's stupidity throughout the whole movie than anything else. She kept acting like she was zoned out, and that was before anything weird had happened. If she didn't have her memory of the events when she first stepped onto the boat at the beginning of the movie, why is she zoned out?     Take my advice. Don't waste your money.
B000RF7XYO|5.0|This movie takes lots of liberties with the actual history.    But as a movie, it excels.  Often, historical movies are either dry or tabloidesque.  (For the latter, see the horrible BBC \\"Tudors.\\")    This one manages to be riveting and yet deal with the history pretty well--while compressing and shifting a lot of the details.    Elizabeth's plight--personal, political, religious, human--is exquisitely vivid and wrenching.  We see her go through bitter and terrifying shocks, and grow before our very eyes, both as a woman and a politician.    At the end, she seems both superhuman and entirely sad: cut off by her partly self-chosen supreme isolation.    The settings and costumes are gorgeous, and the acting by everyone is splendid.    But what really sets the movie off is the writing: tricky, intelligent, telling just enough and leaving lots of suspense.
B00319ECC4|4.0|The story of how Fear Factory's seventh album, \\"Mechanize,\\" came to be is a rather messy one. After putting Fear Factory on the back-burner last year, frontman Burton C. Bell patched up his toxic relationship with former guitarist Dino Cazares, only to re-form the band without the consent of its other half. Drummer Raymond Herrera and bassist-turned-guitarist Christian Olde Wolbers were out, while bassist Byron Stroud (who played with the band on their two Dino-less albums) and drummer/workhorse Gene Hoglan (Strapping Young Lad, Dethklok) rounded out the newest incarnation of Fear Factory. With some legal wrangling and a few dozen Blabbermouth headlines, the album has miraculously seen the light of day.<br /><br />Re-united with longtime collaborator Rhys Fulber, the men that now make up Fear Factory are bound and determined to make \\"Mechanize\\" a glorious return to form. Truth be told, \\"Mechanize\\" is about as good as anything Fear Factory has produced in the last decade. Falling somewhere between the soul-crushing power of [[ASIN:B0008F113W Demanufacture]] and the matured song-writing and dynamics of [[ASIN:B00000I8BX Obsolete]], the album tries for and succeeds at recapturing the band's glory days. Burton and Dino sound as if they have entered a time-warp roughly somewhere around 1997, while drummer Gene Hoglan does a solid job of aping his predecessor. As for Byron Stroud, well, he delivers as expected, but let's face it: the role of the bass-player in Fear Factory has always been irrelevant.<br /><br />The one thing that sets \\"Mechanize\\" aside from the albums it tries to emulate, though, is the shift from the \\"Man vs. Machine\\" theme so prevalent in the past. The bluntly-titled \\"Christploitation\\" finds Bell calling out organized religion, while \\"Powershifter\\" and \\"Fear Campaign\\" are more politically charged fare. While the topics explored are certainly nothing new for the metal genre, it helps the album stand on its own merits. As always, though, the main attraction is Burton's intense growl, which is matched only by his haunting melodies, as well as Dino's riffing and the insane drumming that comes with the Fear Factory brand, and this album more than does the name justice. There are plenty of songs here that will knock you off your feet, but there are also moments where the band brings on the melody and ambience in true Fear Factory fashion to ensure the experience is an authentic one.<br /><br />In spite of the fact that \\"Mechanize\\" does little to expand on the tried and true Fear Factory sound, it's a strong return to form that will no doubt please fans who were confused by the experimental (and, in this reviewer's opinion, under-rated) [[ASIN:B000A2H9IE Transgression]] and only help to further cement the band's legacy as one of the most distinct bands in the metal game. Even if you think Burton and Dino are a couple of unsavory characters for giving their former bandmates the cold shoulder the way they did, you can't help but love them for making the album they did and staying true to their name. Who knows how long the two can tolerate each other this time around, but hopefully there will be more albums like this one to come.ntense growl, which is matched only by his haunting melodies, as well as Dino's riffing and the insane drumming that comes with the Fear Factory brand, and this album more than does the name justice.

B002R0F3Q2|1.0|even the greatest artists take a fall, and here is alicia's.  this album IN NO WAY measures up to her previous 3 great albums.  i bought the Target version, which comes with a dvd.  i enjoyed that dvd of acoustic performances way more than the album itself.  maybe half (or less) of the album is good--and only good, not great.  i was shocked at how bad it is.  not the usual alicia keys standard.
0307454541|5.0|This was a page turner...  Very hard to get started, but around page 30 things start to get easier to understand.  There are many Vanger family members to keep straight at first, but then it's narrowed down to the main characters.  Loved the characters, especially loved the intelligence of the girl and loved what she does to her abuser.  This will make an excellent movie.  So sorry that this author will no longer be writing, as this book is so well written. I'm also involved in a book club of nine women and everyone enjoyed this book.

0061122416|3.0|This isn't really a novel so much as a novella or extended fairy tale.    Imagine a very much thinned-out Siddhartha.    The insights are pleasing and the settings fine. The characters are two- or even one-dimensional, which is appropriate for a fairy tale but may be a little vaporous for some readers.    The paean to individualism is popular, most likely because actual individualism is getting harder and harder and less and less important.
