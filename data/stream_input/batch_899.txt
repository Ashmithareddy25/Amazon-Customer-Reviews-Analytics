0439023483|5.0|Its first page is so unassuming, you don't realize how deep the book's got its claws in you until the Reaping scene. I read it straight through in an airport and nearly missed my connecting flight because I couldn't flipping close it! Brutal then vulnerable, blood-soaked then sparking, Collins' characters breathe and think and never feel fictional. This is a masterpiece that will not apologize.
0448060191|5.0|I bought this for my 9 year old daughter and she loves it as much as I did when I was her age.  It's a classic and contains both the first and second part of the original book.  The binding is beautiful as well.
0156027321|5.0|Wonderful story for a person of any religon, any belief system. A boy who's family owns a zoo in India decides to move the zoo to Canada. The boat sinks en route and the only survivors are Pi and a couple of animals from the zoo. The story takes you through Pi's terrible ordeal being adrift at sea for a ridiculous amount of time and how he co-exists with the animals and specifically one of the most deadly animals known to mankind. You get to go deep inside of Pi's brain as he figures out how to make it. A must read for anyone.
B000ZEE3I6|3.0|The much touted 6th Harry Potter movie made quite a spectacle, tons of effects, beautiful shots and the old crowd all together.  It filled up a lot of midnight movie screen in my area.  I decided to wait till the next day and was very glad I did.    Harry Potter and the half blood prince was a cute movie about dating and teenage angst, but it really wasn't worth all the fuss.  It seemed like it was trying to be a serious Hanna Montana episode in terms of how it did things.    Individual scenes were interesting, the Broadbent plot was fair, but the whole deatheater bit just didn't seem to have any purpose.    The entire plot surrounding Draco was wasted.  It consisted of \\"I'm going to brood over here.\\", then \\"I'm going to brood over here now.\\" until the climax.  If you are going to have a tortured soul in an interactive medium like movies you need more than just sitting here there and everywhere looking pained.  When the climax came Draco didn't seem like someone torn over what he has to do, he seems like a little git.  That was ok when he was a first or second year but at this point in the series that's not where we should be.    The big three have grown into the characters and where worth seeing but even good performances by them couldn't bail out bad writing.    The plan is to milk the last book by making it two movies, hopefully this will give them enough time to make things work.    For the visuals alone you should see it in a theater but it just isn't any better than average.

B0029358GM|5.0|Wilco is back with their strongest effort in years.  Although I've enjoyed the last few albums, nothing has been as satisfying as YHF, Summerteeth, or Being There IMHO.  Just when I thought Wilco was fading they come back with something great that is different but the same.  It feels like Tweedy is back in firm control and that the new guys have fallen back into the mix, where they belong.
B001GCUER0|5.0|I don't need to tell you how great Season 2 was, but I'm a bit worried about the packaging for it. What's basically a shirt-box with the DVD set inside, I'll have to handle this with baby hands so the plastic window doesn't get punctured. I was hoping for something more along the lines of the durable Zippo lighter case that Season 1 came in, just to keep this series in \\"uniform\\" in my DVD cabinet. I remember getting ticked when FOX started making those horrible plastic head cases for the Simpsons after a few seasons. I'd prefer that a particular series keep the same/similar design for every season they produce.

0307278255|4.0|We no longer read Jhumpa Lahiri because she writes about Indians, but because she uses her Indian heritage so exquisitely as a window through which to observe ordinary families and human beings. The chief characters of these eight stories are assimilated second-generation Americans, the daughters or sons of immigrants who have prospered in this country. All are highly educated (most of the tales are set in Cambridge, Mass). Their marriages and romantic relationships are almost all with non-Indians, and their Bengali background is only one of the factors that make them individuals and so very real as people. All the stories are relatively long, not only in words (40 pages or so), but also in elapsed time; most take place over a span of several years or refer back to such a span; the denouements are less a matter of sudden surprise than slow realization.<br /><br />In the title story (which with the last one are the only two not set in Massachusetts), a young Indian mother who has moved to Seattle with her financier husband is visited by her widowed father; it is a wonderful study of how members of a family need each other, even as they must pull apart. In \\"Only Goodness,\\" an Indian woman's loyalty to her brother has the opposite effect, almost causing disaster in her own marriage. \\"Hell-Heaven\\" follows the relationship between the narrator's mother and family friend, and is the only one which deals primarily with the immigrant generation themselves and in which the fact of ethnicity is central. In \\"Nobody's Business,\\" by contrast, race is quite unimportant; it is a story about an American PhD student who develops a crush on an Indian woman living in the same house, but fails to intervene when he might really have helped her -- a rather sad tale that might happen anywhere.<br /><br />The last three stories are connected by containing the same two characters, Hema and Kaushik. In the first, \\"Once in a Lifetime,\\" they are children, meeting, then parting, then meeting again as his family moves back to India then returns to the US, richer, more successful, more distant. The second, \\"Year's End,\\" is about Kaushik's difficulty in accepting his father's remarriage; it has a slightly nasty quality not found in any of the other stories. Hema and Kaushik come together again in Rome many years later, in the final story, \\"Going Ashore.\\" They love each other, as they discover they always have, but their lives are now complicated by other habits, other futures. This is the only story to which Lahiri gives a surprise ending, but it is a doozy!<br /><br />All in all, these are not earth-shaking stories, but they are all quietly satisfying, a little sad though basically warm, and above all very wise. However, I do miss the range of her first collection, [[ASIN:0618101365 INTERPRETER OF MALADIES]], and for that reason am withholding the final star.ily moves back to India then returns to the US, richer, more successful, more distant.

B001BGTWXI|4.0|Slipknot: love 'em or hate 'em, they're here to stay. This is the fifth full-length by the band, and the fourth full-length with Cory Taylor at the helm. Many people have complained that they've gone \\"soft\\" -- in the direction of Stone Sour soft -- but for anyone following bands with side projects, they tend to override the main band. This is a fact; after all, the same thing happened with Tool. The melodic nature of A Perfect Circle finally crept in, making their latest album their most \\"melodic\\" and experimental yet. But let's not go down that tangent, as it has nothing to do with this CD, does it?    The fact is though, Slipknot *has* matured in fashion that might upset some people who give this album a cursory glance. But, under further scrutiny, we can see that the band is not only doing what they've done all along, but have actually managed to refine and increase the aggression put forth. There are now actual undertones of \\"real metal\\". This is something that many opponents of the band have complained about, and yet (ironically), many of their greatest fans have also complained about in regards to the band \\"selling out\\". The thing is, Slipknot is first and foremost a metal band. This allows them to explore every convention that the genre offers.    In terms of the actual music, the strongest thing that hit me while listening to this album was the guitar work. It's quite possibly the most notably improved aspect out of anything they've done in the past. Mick Harris and Jim Root now provide a true \\"metal\\" backbone to the songs, as heard in the songs \\"Sulfur\\" and \\"Vendetta\\" -- \\"Vendetta\\" in particular has an almost thrash-esque vibe to it. Joey Jordison, as always, never fails to impress with his expertly precise kit work. You can ask any Slipknot fan what the best part of the band is, and I guarantee the majority of them will mention his name.     The only fault you could have with this album, in my opinion, is in Corey Taylor's vocals and lyrical content. I think he blurs the line too much when bringing the melodic, insightful, rock-inspired material that Stone Sour is notable for. The song \\"Snuff\\" in particular, feels way out of place, and actually is the reason why I gave this album four stars out of five. That, and the album ends on a very underwhelming note. Whereas IOWA --  and even more so, the band's self-titled album -- had tracks that absolutely crushed the listener, Til We Die and Vermilion, Pt. 2 (which isn't even the original version) just fade away into melodic nothingness. This would be fine on any other rock album, but when the band has tried so hard to redeem themselves with such a heavy-metal edge, it's extremely anti-climactic.    Overall I give this a 4/5. Obviously it's not anything like what they did on their self-titled album, but in terms of music and songwriting, it certainly does more than Vol. 3 managed to do. I think this could be the first album that someone interested in the band could get into. Give it a listen, and see if you feel the same way!
B0001B55PS|5.0|Of the three albums I have this has got to be my favorite album of Delta's...The lyrics are wonderful, her voice is excellent, and the music is catchy. Yes, the songs are more mellow, but they are very very good. I would highly recommend this album, esp. if you are new to Delta Goodrem.
B0028K31CE|4.0|Its been eight years since we were last blessed with a Maxwell album. Eight years and not a word from the falsetto who made women lose control with just one high note. Eight years since we were ready to crown him as the next Marvin Gaye. What happened? Maxwell is so secretive that we may never know. All that matters is that he's back with \\"BLACKsummers'night\\".<br /><br />Maxwell is a throwback artist. Its hard not to use certain words like \\"funky or groovy\\" to review his CD. He uses live instruments. No hip hop beats here. No \\"The Roots\\" crew. Just plain old music your mama used to love. He opens the album with the groovy \\"Bad Habits\\"(check the  lyrics). His first single \\"Pretty Wings\\" is classic Maxwell. He gets deep on \\"Stop The World\\". \\"Fistful of Tears\\" is solid. And he closes the album with a funky three-minute instrumental on \\"Pheonix Rise\\".<br /><br />\\"BLACKsummers'night\\" is part one of a trilogy Maxwell which lets fans know that he's not going away no time soon. He's letting everyone know that this is not just an attempt to make money, but another shot at retaking the title that was once his.<br /><br />Its been a long time since we heard music like this. Maxwell is in his groove. I wish the album was longer than 9 tracks. Its like a teaser. But once the other two CD's drop, we will get the whole picture.

B000ZEE3I6|4.0|Dumbledore (Michael Gambon) enlists Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) to get close to Professor Slughorn, the new Potions teacher. He believes that he has an important memory of Tom Riddle/Lord Voldemort and wants Harry to get it. A used potions book of someone named the Half Blood Prince helps Harry to impress Slughorn and get closer to him. But who's the Half Blood Prince ?<br /><br />  While Hermione starts to show her true feelings for Ron when he starts dating someone. But he's too clueless to realize she's jealous. He also joins the Quiditch team, but he isn't as bad as he is in the book, but with some help from Harry and Hermione. Harry's last year of Quiditch isn't made into that much of a big deal in the movie as well. But what was done well in the movie is how Draco has a mission from the Dark Lord that Snape (Alan Rickman) has promised to help him with it. While Harry knows Draco is up to something which leads him into more than one confrontation with him.<br /><br />  I loved the first half of the movie but once it got towards the end, it felt a bit rushed. The Deatheater's battle with Hogwart students from the book was left out when I was looking forward to it. While Bill Weasley I think was totally cut out of the movies. The drama between Persey and his family was also left out. I think the movies would have been stronger if didn't leave out such things though.I liked how the Weaseley mom didn't like Bill's future wife in the book, which led to a good moment in the end. Here, all that was totally left out.<br /><br />  I liked a lot about the movie though. I originally said that the Harry and Ginny scenes could have been better. Now that I think about it, I loved the scene where Ginny runs to help Harry in a fight with Deatheaters. The flashbacks of Voldermort as a child were also good. While the director David Yates is good at handling the dark side of the story as well as the humor and magic. He's one of the better Potter directors even if he does cut out some things. A lot of people want Chris Columbus back for the last film but he's lucky if he's hired to do a made for dvd Home Alone sequel after doing (I Love You Beth Cooper). David Yates is fine, it's the scripts that just need a little bit more development, other than that he does a good job.e things.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|Like many I loved Firefly. The setting has long been praised and it is done well enough: though there are better(esp the Traveller RPG verse) there are worse. The absense of FTL can give a feeling of hopelessness though. You know that sooner or later they will take the sky from Mal and his crew. It is the characters that are best though.<br />The disadvantages should be given first. There is considerable inappropriateness including nudity and sexual references. There is a lot of casual violence too but at least it is appropriate to the setting. The advantages of the show far outweigh such things. Fortunately unlike in some shows, such things tend to be concentrated in a few parts so the more straitlaced like this reviewer can filter it fairly easily with a fast-forward without disturbing the plot.<br /><br />The crew of the Serenity are what might be called Space Cossacks. They are people gone into the wild to escape the confines of a large empire like the original Cossacks. They live by smuggling, trade and banditry out on the borders of \\"the Alliance\\" They go there for various reasons from resentment, like Mal to survival, like the Tams(the Tams are a classic example of noble fugitives, like many a courtier in history who has run afoul of high-class intrigue). Much of the show is a heroic portrayal of Scotch-Irish morality with a strong emphasis on loyalty to the in group. It is also reminder of the need for checks on centralized authority. In a way the show is kind of a reverse of Star Trek being from the perspective of the crew of a lowly tramp ship  instead of members of a large naval bureaucracy.<br /><br />Mal rules like a clan chieftain. He is violent and unafraid to kill(his sin really is wrath) but he treats his crew like men and has a strong protective instinct. Zoe is his sidekick. She unfortunately has a little developed personality but Wash the pilot and her husband likes her a lot. Inara I never took to and thought her rather embarrassing. She is sweet, sensitive and considerate but I would agree with Mal that a professional is a professional even if she gives herself a fancy name. But she is plausible and there have been folk like her in history. Book is an interesting character because not many sci-fis allow religion to come naturally. Jayne I quite disliked. He has many fans but his fans really seem to love him because he is so hyperbolically despicable and repulsive that he seems to many to be lovable. But somehow I find it hard to like someone who was a bully, a traitor, a coward(yes he is despite his display), a blowhard and insults a disturbed girl in front of her and her brother. That is kind of the point though. As for other characters, well who could forget dear little Kaylee, the sweet little Ms fix-it?. She is cheerful, cute, and has a crush on the good Dr Simon who is prim, awkward and most unfortunately very busy, making returning such  things difficult for him and thus leaving the viewer in suspense.<br /><br />My favorite all the characters was River Tam and her brother Dr. Simon Tam. Simon was the best and most complex of all of them. He has an appealing combination of warmth and rationality. He is softspoken, polite(except when being impolite is appropriate)and rather dandyish. But in a way he was the bravest of the crew. He was willing to accept loss of status, exile, and peril because his sister was wronged and there was no one else to right it. He is usually gentle and not a skilled fighter, but he is at times as dangerous and as awe-inspiring as you would expect from someone who has nothing left to lose but honor and a loved one he sacrificed everything for. In times of stress he can remain remarkably calm and he is possessed of a tremendous determination. He can be a self-control freak sometimes and one suspects him of being haunted by irrational guilt. At times his devotion to River approaches sainthood but he has hidden a latent fanaticism which we catch an occasional glimpse of and which seems quite human(the higher one tries to climb the farther to fall). He is most of the time a doting big-brother and cares for her with such skills his profession allows him(an out-of-specialty case but at least he knows HOW to learn on the job). As well as the affection that perhaps she needs even more. But when his sister is threatened he is as fierce as a wolf defending a cub. He comes out as a very noble yet still human character and manages to be good while still being likable.<br /><br />River is a great and sympathetic portrayal of a disturbed person. Mental affliction is a misfortune that one can fear looking at closely. But River humanizes it. She was rendered insane by government experiments and the Alliance thinks her a \\"precious commodity\\". At times she is a normal girl. And at other times she is very not normal. It is Simon's mission to protect her-and incidently protect others from her. A job bigger then most young men face, even those in the top three percent of med school.<br /><br />The relationship between Simon and River is beautiful and well presented. It lifts the show up into the epic level. The two are inseparable and feel themselves alone in a hostile world. They sometimes provide moments of tears and sometimes provide moments of awe but do so in a homey way that looks believable(River: \\"I didn't think you would come for me.\\" Simon:\\"Well you're a dummy\\"). It is more believable still when one realizes that even \\"mere\\" human love can at times be as spectacular and still look very much like that. Here one can as is sometimes the case learn the beauty of real flowers by seeing fairy flowers.<br /><br />One essay once compared Simon and Mal and this seems at first glance a odd contrast, Simon's city-slicker perfectionism and Mal's ruffianly nature seem an odd fit. They start off as rivals because the interests of those they respectively protect seem to clash. But they slowly learn to respect each other and are alike in their protective instincts, and in their determination.<br /><br />Firefly is a great production. It has been widely praised by people of all kinds and has something for everyone. One can hope that more sci-fis will come that will be as good as Firefly.

B00003CX9E|3.0|I'm no movie buff but I think I take movie viewing more seriously than the typical person. Avoiding the argument of how historically significant it is (as nearly every review seems to do) I would just say that it is a pretty good film. That's it. It's not life changing, not one of my favorites just a pretty good film. It essentially works like an allegory film where at the end it got me to think a little bit. I said \\"Hmm...\\" and then I moved on. That's all there was to it for me. If you like old films with a moral to ponder then you'll probably find the film interesting. If you don't then watching this film is not going to make you \\"enlightened\\" or \\"hip\\" so just watch what you like.
B000F5GNX8|5.0|Amazingly enough some movies stay with you after you watch it on screen. I nearly checked every day the dvd release date, after I watched it on a nearly empty movie theater in New York.  Sharp witted commentary through the movie keeps you laughing, and unexpected twists and turns makes you scream. Especially the dog scene was amazing. And hats off to Robert Downey Jr.; nobody else can make you scream with laughter one moment, sad the next.  I think I will watch it again tonight!
B000FBFMFW|5.0|This book started slowly and I got about 100 pages in and set it aside.  It seemed Fitz was just running around whining and complaining and was unable to do much else.  I picked it back up and found that it really opened up thereafter.      In this second story of the Farseer trilogy, there is alot more action and Fitz is thrown right in the middle of it.  He has alot of enemies of course all led by Regal who takes center stage as the bad guy in this one.  The red ship raiders are there and moreso at the beginning, however quite conveniently they can't sail and attack in winter which allows Hobbs to change her focus between the political intrigue of the kingdom and the battle with the raiders.    I found the 2nd half of this book to be quite the page turner and would have finished it off in one sitting if I didn't need to sleep.  There is alot for Fitz to deal with including love, duty, fighting, witting and skilling.    A few comments/critiques (may have spoilers):  I thought she made the wolf too smart.  When Fitz talked to him using the wit, I would have expected very simple wolf like thoughts to come out, not nearly human conversations.     I would like to have seen something more about Regal than a one dimensional antagonist.  I imagine book 3 will give us alot more detail on him, but for now all he is is a spoiled, weak, scheming villian and not much more than that.    Robin Hobb leaned a little too much on the \\"King's man\\" explanation to describe why people would not act.  Everyone knew what was going on, but no one did much to stop it (until the end) and they kept using the excuse the king didn't order it or we are just tools of the king, we don't make decisions.  The king was nearly dead throughout this whole story, so there wasn't much he was going to do.    All in all, I can forgive some of the weak points (every story has some) and highly recommend both this book and the series.
B001TOD92C|4.0|Good look inside the world of professional wrestling and the way these athletes abuse themselves for a little bit of the limelight. They seem to be the lowest paid professional athletes out there, but they are subject to all the wear and tear of the big leagues -- of course, the matches and outcomes are all scripted, if you believe this portrayal. Rourke's character, Randy the Ram Robinson, is washed up and too ill to continue wrestling, altho that is the only place he feels he belongs, the only place where people care about him, and it doesn't seem that he can always tell the ring from reality. The scene where he quits his job is a good depiction of this. Wrestling has given him the only recognition he has ever had, and he can't give it up. The movie shows the character with all his flaws -- altho we try to like him, we end up pitying him.  I would have given this movie 5 stars, but there isn't a whole lot of story or plot, mostly a character study. Marisa Tomei does a great job as his stripper friend -- altho that is the one place where it doesn't seem real -- would a middle-aged single mother really have a body that looks 21 if she was not a movie star? I seriously doubt it.  Great performances tho, and well worth seeing.
1400032717|5.0|First-person narratives rely so heavily on the perspective of the narrators (and their vocabulary, syntax, knowledge, agenda, history, interests, self-censorship and relationships) that the voice through which they each tell their individual stories often tells more then the events within.    THE CURIOUS INCIDENT OF THE DOG IN THE NIGHT-TIME may portend to be a mystery, but that is only a come-on, in a sense. Instead, this is a character piece that uses the most unique of voices: a 15-year-old autistic boy from outside London. Christopher's autism shapes this book in ways few authors could capture as faithfully or as creatively as Mark Haddon has. Haddon's dedication to telling Christopher's story as only Christopher could tell it creates a challenge for those unfamiliar with autism. At no point does Haddon cheat by jumping out of Christopher's voice; Christopher's train of thought, the faithfulness to Christopher's version of Truth, and, most importantly, Haddon's ability to keep Christopher as both the driver and navigator of this odd journey are key to its success.    I can't, off the top of my head, think of another book that provides so much insight into the narrator not through the thoughts, actions and dialogue, but through the organization of the narrator's thoughts. Tangents often have metaphoric resonance, but the tangents in this book (chapters about math puzzles, for example) give Christopher comfort, and for a narrator who doesn't understand the framework of writing, these side trips reveal Christopher in ways that we, as readers, might find strange, but, hey, that's what it is to be autistic.    And what a PERFECT book to give to someone who truly wants to know what autism is about. Clinical or didactic pieces of scientific information don't reveal the unending thought process of the autistic person, but seem to present facts and look at the condition from an outsider's viewpoint.     Frankly, I don't think anything I write here does justice to this book. This is a unique (and sometimes difficult) story of a boy who lives a unique (and mostly difficult) life.
B001SO6KNS|1.0|[[ASIN:B001SO6KNS Ip Man [Blu-ray]]]  I'm a really big fan of this movie, not to mention the plot and the story line being very amazing!    but my low raiting is not based on the movie but its on the bue-ray product! I had the impression that one of the main advantages of having a blue-ray is region-Free facility it offers.     However, when I bought this product it was region protect and I've spened more than USD 60 and I cannot watch it.     ... that day was a really bad day for me.
B001GQ2TGA|3.0|Enya never failed to send shivers down my spine with her otherwordly sound, but this happens less and less with every new release - From Amarantine onwards, she seems to be firmly rooted in a typical \\"Enya\\" sound, smooth, angelic and melancholy. Nothing wrong with this, but it does get quite predictable, especially in the ballads. It's not as exciting a listen as Shepherd Moons or Memory Of Trees were, both  innovative and experimental albums, yet enormously satisfying to listen to. Winter Came produces only one or two tracks of interest, and the rest are rather forgetable. On one track toward the end of the album, she tries to break from tradition, and uses a bluesy guitar lead, but the song ends up sounding like something from the mid-sixties and the wailing guitar lead does not really effectively contribute to that style. I'd say Trains And Winter Rains and White Is In The Winter Night is more like the Enya sound we know and love, capable of producing goosebumps. So perhaps I can conclude that those two songs and the closing track, My! My! Time Flies are worth the price of the CD? Well, that is if you have 25 bucks to spare.

Best D-Pad by far across all consoles IMO, I had to get one of these things along with an XCM Crossfire (PS3 controller -> XBOX 360 converter) for my XBOX360.    Feels great, and the analog sticks are even better than previous generations.  They seem to spring back to idle position very well, which is important.  The D-Pad is as awesome as ever, the buttons all work very well and spring back quickly for rapid-press in-game moments.  The triggers take a bit to get used to, but work well once you're accustomed to them.    There's not much else to say other than: 5/5, would buy again!

B001KVZ6FM|5.0|This is a gloriously well done movie with a delightful story but it is not for kids under about 10 years old.  A small child would be VERY unhappy with this movie but adults and thoughtful kids over 10 will love it.

006112429X|4.0|This is a book that will stay with you for a while.  I like the way the story is told, and that the author really wants the reader to decide the hows and whys of the events in the story.  It brings up the age old question of which is stronger - nature or nuture, and even after reading it, I'm not certain which prevails in Kevin's case.  I would recommend this book - just be prepared!
1423101472|4.0|I started reading this series when the last book came out, The Battle at the Labyrinth, and I consider that the best of the run even after reading this one. This is a good book, but something was missing, even though it is action packed.<br /><br />I liked the parts that tell you about the characters' backgrounds and history. The legends and myths were interesting, and the first couple books had more of that. There was a good amount of backstory in this book, but I still wanted more.<br /><br />I think followers of Harry Potter will enjoy these books because of all the magic and legends. The world created in this series is not as defined as Potter's, but has it's own charm.

0316154687|2.0|This is a book filled with essays or short stories that involve Sedaris life that I checked out because it was recommended by Yan. I thought the first essay was funny, but the rest of the stories just sound like Sedaris being mean and not that funny. Sure it got a giggle or two out of me when he read some of the essays to a live audience, but I almost didn't finish the audio book, and I barely remember the last couple shorts. Not sure why I didn't just scrap it completely, because near the end listening to it was horrid.

031606792X|5.0|First let me say, I can't believe how much this book is hated. I was completely unspoiled before I read this, but I had heard people hated and wanted to return the book. I absolutly loved it. There were so many things I didn't see coming. I don't like spoiling anything so I will try to make this spoilerless.<br />The story takes place as Edward and Bella are getting ready to marry. They go on there honeymoon and comeback to Forks with something extra. Something that is going to kill Bella.<br />I love the new character, Renessme. I kinda hope Meyer writes a book about her someday. I can't pinpoint what I really loved about this book, but the more I think about it, the more I think the writing was good and the mystery within the story better. I wish there was more of the series to read.
0140449337|5.0|It is truly a marvel to behold that the human condition is a stale and marveled upon as in the ages of old. And yet we still, in our seemingly relevant aplomb with not only the fabrications of reality that we so violently submit to, that an ancient mind trained and experienced through many stalwarts of confrontation aptly applied the power of his own internal wisdom as a doctrine that was essentially the diary of a man considering his new found powers of mind. \\"Meditations\\" is essentially the most necessary read for any individual attempting to cope with the mysteries of our existence. One who, rather than fearing death, needs motivation towards the very facilities of existence. It's obviousness and contemporary deluge of thoughts so seemingly not lost to time are at the foundation of all individual beings. The read is far from compulsory nor is it stymied in its aims to ascertain a single visage of understanding nor \\"putting a label upon\\" the very summations of existence as seen and experienced through his eyes. Marcus is without a doubt one of the first human beings whom successfully captures not only the essence of our existence, but in so doing, provides a compensatory means of communicating within himself the strengths necessary to succeed as all humans should.  Filled with anecdote and worthwhile notes, this edition houses a stalwart conversion that preserves not only the beauty of Marcus's prose but furthers its complexity by providing the means and history to which this ancient individual sought solace not only within himself, but the hope that all, too, could share in a worldly vision as astute, unencumbered, and as truly simple as his own.
B000JPGO88|5.0|The book is great, it won a Pulitizer.  But the audio book is incredible.  Frank McCourt inhabits the characters of everyone who speaks, including himself at 3, 5, 9, and on.

B0017R5UAA|3.0|Art is at the crux of influence and experience. It either molds its own creation, or seeks to fabricate an intricate visage of originality combining personal flourishes to seemingly expunge and repudiate its unoriginality into the formation of creation. \\"Fleet Foxes\\" are an amalgamation. And as a undoubtedly hailed and bemoaned, there simplicity and influences are worn directly on there prospective shoulders. That's not to say it's not an enjoyable listen...that's just to say that at times what appears to be a general nudging of respect towards former performers and influence can often times be regarding as stand still and far from driving towards a personal vision that encompasses said collective personalities. Yet as a band removed from its contemporaries, \\"Fleet Foxes\\" contributes an admirable job of harkening towards the simplicity of the past while contemplating the present circumstance. Even in the albums linear notes such an anecdote is given to its prospective listeners. Taken in this light, and with the honesty to which these musicians hold dear to the glory of past ilks, it is a respectable and compliant aural day-trip that feels heavily front-loaded with successive pop-like compositions while leaning deeply at  its conclusion towards a much maligned near-\\"Moody Blues\\" sense of self-righteousness that is ultimately cumbersome for a trained ear. It is indeed a good record, and as a debut stands testament to the possibilities of there own resolve. Once removed from the cramped confines of the recording process...I perceive the future of \\"Fleet Foxes\\" gaining there prospective chops and delivering future and more pertinent output that will undoubtedly serve to retract there own critics.  Hopefully...themselves.

There it is, in your tiny handwriting: April 27th; Studio TV-15, the words all jerky-looking, like you wrote them on the subway.  Your last 'proof.'<br />\\"I still think about the letter you asked me to write.  It nags at me, even though you're gone and there's no one to give it to anymore.  Sometimes I work on it in my head, trying to map out the story you asked me to tell, about everything that happened this past fall and winter.  It's all still there, like a movie I can watch when I want to.  Which is never.\\"<br /><br />As I've written at other points in time, I just love finding a book that I enjoy so much that I want to immediately read it a second time.  What, for me, is even rarer is finding a book like WHEN YOU REACH ME that I enjoy even more the second time through.  The reason for this is that there is a lot of foreshadowing to this story and, the second time through I know what is going to happen and I can watch for all of the little clues that I missed the first time.<br /><br />Reading through the second time, coming upon what I had missed, I found myself thinking about what life would be like if it could be lived like a book so that you could read it through the first time, find out what happens, and then go back and live it through a second time being able to watch for all those clues necessary for avoiding the dangers and mistakes.<br /><br />\\"He showed up around the beginning of the school year, when Sal and I still walked home from school together.  A few kids called him Quack, short for Quackers, or they called him Kicker because he used to do these sudden kicks into the street, like he was trying to punt one of the cars speeding up Amsterdam Avenue.  Sometimes he shook his fist at the sky and yelled crazy stuff like 'What's the burn scale?  Where's the dome?' and then he threw his head back and laughed these loud, crazy laughs, so everyone could see that he had about thirty fillings in his teeth.  And he was always on our corner, sometimes sleeping with his head under the mailbox.\\"<br /><br />Miranda, the twelve-year-old narrator of WHEN YOU REACH ME, lives with her mom in an apartment house in New York City in the late 1970s.  Miranda has a healthy obsession with the book A WRINKLE IN TIME.  Her mother's obsession is with becoming a contestant on The $20,000 Pyramid, the television game show hosted by Dick Clark.  There are three puzzles that quickly develop in WHEN YOU REACH ME:  First, there are little snippets of Miranda referring to mysterious notes she finds in unexpected places that contain unknowable stuff, and some unexplained letter that she has been asked to write to some unrevealed person.  I didn't figure out what these were all about until almost the end.  There is the mystery of that crazy guy on the corner, just down from Miranda's apartment building.  From where did he suddenly appear?  And then there are all the questions surrounding Marcus, the kid at school who also knows all about A WRINKLE IN TIME and who, for no apparent reason, punches out Miranda's lifelong friend and downstairs neighbor -- Sal -- who then quickly becomes her former lifelong friend.<br /><br />WHEN YOU REACH ME is fit together so perfectly that -- the second read through -- I was shaking my head and laughing at least as loud as the crazy guy on the corner each time I came upon one of the many pieces that author Rebecca Stead leaves sitting right out there in the open, just begging to be discovered.  It is a book that gives me funny feelings in my stomach and makes me want to look up and shake my fist at the sky; a book that made me weep; a book that I will be thinking about for a long, long time.<br /><br />\\"'None of it makes sense!' my brain yelled.<br />\\"'But all of it is true,' I answered.\\"<br /><br />I don't want to say anymore, for fear of giving away too much.

031606792X|4.0|Let me just say that I was talked in to reading these by many friends and family members.  Because I'm a 34 year old woman who NEVER in a million years thought that a young adult series would be for me, I eventually gave in and started the first book.  2 weeks later...I'm in love.  I couldn't put any of the books down and I love this book.  I don't see where all the controversy lies.  I think the wedding and honeymoon part was very touching and I like all the desire Bella feels for Edward.  It shows how much she really loves him in every way.  I am surprised at some of the horrible reviews on here.  I read Meyer's website and I see that she never set out to write \\"young adult\\" novels and I don't think that she has to \\"stick\\" with anyone's standards for young adults.  If parents choose to let their children read these books then maybe they should inform themselves a little better by reading it themselves first.      To say that Jacob is a pedophile really angers me.  If you read how Quil imprinted on the 2 year old in Eclipse then you'd see that it has nothing to do with a sexual relationship and it's more of a deeper connection. Besides Jacob says a million times that he doesn't think of Renesmee that way.  What's wrong with you people?      Anyway, I love this novel.  I think the whole series is brilliant and I might just read the entire thing again.  I wish the author would get back to work on Midnight Sun.  I can't wait to read it when she decides to put it out!  :)

0316010669|4.0|This is the kind of deep, intelligent, witty discussion that must go on at dinner parties in New York.  Or at least the kinds of parties that I think Dorothy Parker would have been in attendance.  It is fascinating reading and I enjoyed every new insight that Gladwell describes.<br /><br />Blink is written in a style best described as, \\"I am about to tell you something so amazing and so wonderful, that it will forever change the world!\\"  And truly there are a million things that need to be changed in this world; however, a thought lingers and troubles me.  What, exactly, are we supposed to take from this?  Is this the kind of thoughtful work that we enjoy with a glass of wine and congratulate ourselves for being so smart and enlightened or can we use Gladwell's ideas to make the world a better place?  Not that there's anything wrong with a little wine and stimulating conversation, but I suspect Gladwell wants his work to taken more seriously than that.  I feel the one weak element of the book is in the absence of details on how we can and when we should use our instinct or our intuition to help us make decisions and how can we take action with all this great theory he has given us.<br /><br />Gladwell describes a \\"technique\\" of \\"thin slicing\\" which can be understood to mean your \\"gut reaction\\" or your \\"intuition\\" about a person, thing, or situation.  He provides overwhelming evidence through a multitude of examples to tell us that although we often mistrust our instinct because of things we've been taught, such as \\"don't judge a book by it's cover,\\" it is these instincts which we should use to make meaningful decisions.  At this point in the book, I was sold on the theory and ready to start trusting my intuition to make better decisions when - Whoop!  He pulled the proverbial rug out from under my newfound brilliance and his own theory by gaving examples of when thin slicing does not work, such when we vote in handsome, magnanimous, yet unqualified politicians like Warren Harding or when a city's police make a snap judgment about his afro and question him as a criminal suspect.<br /><br />I do not want to be a spoiler, so you know some spoiling is about to begin, but the book deserves, nay, yearns for a unifying theory and here it is:  you, insightful one, have sought to stymie your gut feelings for too long, relying instead on your years of academia, and, seeking to over analyze every nugget of minutia before coming to a decision you are often deciding wrong.  Rise forth, intelligent one and know that the super computer lying in your subconscious is ready to do great things.  Or, \\"Use the Force, Luke!\\"<br /><br />This coin has two sides and the dark side of the theory is this:  you, oh wicked one, you have sought to judge quickly and decisively, but you have failed miserably as you have let prejudice, greed, malice, fear, and inexperience direct your soul and as such you will make grave mistakes and errors and perhaps, be judged quite harshly by society.  You may be strong and smart Darth, but when we peel back the layer of evil and remove your robotic head, we see you for the pathetic, sick person your are.<br /><br />Less sarcastically stated:  use your instinct when you have the facts and reasoning to back it up; be cautious about your quick judgments when you are in a panic or uneducated about a person or topic.<br /><br />I did like Blink.  Did, but I felt a tad let down.  Gladwell has taken much research by psychologists and researchers and tried to bring it into a form those who are not professional psychologists can understand and be entertained by.  He does not however, give us an action plan or any tools to use his ideas, so, enjoy Blink, dear reader, and devise your own theory about how to apply Gladwell's ideas.

I bought this for my boyfriend who is a huge batman fan and he had a smile on his face for a week.  I also enjoyed it, the Batman mythos always interested me.<br /><br />If you haven't picked up this film on blu-ray yet this limited edition gift set just gave you a reason to!
B000ZEE3I6|1.0|Please know there will be SPOILERS in this review regarding the book and the movie versions of the Half-Blood Prince.      I left this movie feeling the most disappointed in any book to movie adaptation I have ever seen in a film.  Many of the past Potter films have left out or reworked parts of the book that really bothered me, but not as much as this film did.  One of my two major issues with this film, and there are many smaller ones, is that there was NO BATTLE at the school!!!  The death eaters waltz in, kill the headmaster, and waltz out??!?!  Are you kidding me?  All the work of the D.A., not the mention the school defenses, and they don't even notice that these guys are blasting out windows, blowing up rooms, and killing their headmaster???  Harry isn't even immobilized by Dumbledore as he is in the book during the death scene, which prevents Harry from coming to his defense.  Instead they make out Harry to be a WIMP who stands around pacing while they kill his beloved headmaster.  Harry would have gotten himself killed in Dumbledore's defense if he had a chance...which was why the headmaster immobilized him with a spell to prevent that from happening!  They didn't even let poor Harry stun a single death eater during the entire chase off the school grounds.  In the book both Harry, his friends, and teachers put up a major fight.  Where was Bill Weasley who was brutally attacked, and Lupin and Tonks who also fought for the school?  A death eater was killed if my memory serves me right!  Harry left Ron, Hermione, and Ginny some of the luck potion, which is what protected them during the battle.  I could go on and on... but onto my next big beef with this film.    They completely skip the funeral!!!! Unbelievable, one of the most important characters dies and they just end the movie!  Why was everyone so calm at the sight of their dead headmaster?  I remember people in the book beside themselves with the pain of his loss.  And why on earth in all of the most emotional scenes do I never see a single tear drop down Daniel Radcliffe's face?  I swear his emotional scenes were completely lacking for me.  I wanted to see a real heart wrenching performance like I felt when reading the book.  And don't even get me started on how they gypped poor Fawkes....    A couple other things...Since when can Dumbledore apparate right into the school?  In the book he had to appear in Hogsmead on his return from the horcrux scene and TRAVEL to the school which already had the dark mark above it....ugh!!  Where on earth was Doby or Kreacher in this film? Considering what happens in the next book/film I think an appearance of Doby would have been justified.  These changes they made were simply unnecessary and serve no purpose other than to make the final film a joke with so much information incorrect or not covered.    I have put up with a lot adaptations from the books to the movies that were grossly changed, but this was simply unacceptable.  The battle they skipped over was extremely important and by skipping over it, and the funeral, they did a great disservice to the memory of Dumbledore.  Those scenes were extremely powerful and they turned it into something rated G (gutless) and ruined the film IMO.  At least an hour of all of the endless focus on the romance in this film could have been cut out to add more of the guts of the book onto the big screen.      The only shining light for me is Evanna Lynch who plays Luna.  I wish I had seen more of her in the film because I love the way she portrays Luna's character, who was one of my favorites from the books.  Oh...and I can't forget Warwick Davis whose character of Filius Flitwick I always look forward to seeing.      Hopefully this review will save a few people from paying good money to see a travesty of a great story.

I will say that this is a very informative book with a lot of solid information in it that can and should be used by managers of any level and in any business environment.

0061231401|5.0|Black Order was my first James Rollins novel and I've been hooked ever since.<br /><br />Doomsday Key delivers all the Kindle Klicking action you could imagine.  If you are a regular reader of Rollins, it will feel so good to meet up with the gang from Sigma Force again.  They really have their hands full in this tale.  James Rollins has a terrific way of weaving parallel story lines that merge in a satisfying resolution and the exotic locations are  great escape from everyday life.<br /><br />I actually got depressed as the novel ended because I know I will have to wait a while for the next.
0446402397|5.0|The combination of great suspense in a realistic historical background made this book a huge pleasure to read.  I enjoyed the story while learning many new things about the Soviet Union under Stalin.  It's so action-packed, I'll be surprised if this book is not made into a movie in the very near future.    I mostly read non-fiction and am not a fan of mystery novels.  But I do enjoy \\"literary journalism\\" and I would put this near that genre.  It's a great story with a non-fiction background and the number of references the author used when researching for this novel indicate a high regard for precise historical context.
B0027G783W|3.0|Moby has never been afraid to experiment, so this latest offering promised a more mellow Moby sound.  The opening song, \\"Division\\" is very pleasant, with ethereal mood music, while \\"jltf-1\\" is light and monotonous.  However, \\"\\"jltf\\" redeems \\"jltf-1\\" with a nice vocal by Melody Zimmer.  The album jumps around from a few good tracks to bland monotonous noise like, \\"Pale Horses\\" and \\"Stock Radio\\" which is nothing more than 55 seconds of `noise'.  The album is at the most, uneven, even if most of the songs are of a lower key than previous albums.<br /><br />That's not to say all is boring about \\"Wait For Me\\".  \\"Shot In The Back of the Head\\" is an ethereal mind trip that is almost hypnotic.  The title track, \\"Wait For Me\\" is a nice solid song with great heartfelt lyrics from Kelli Scarr.  \\"A Seated Night\\" is one of the more inventive keyboard pieces with a bluesy scatting by Starr Blackshere, but the other male vocalist (not noted in the booklet) is distracting with his repetitive southern-style preaching.  But not all is lost here.  \\"Mistake\\" and \\"Scream Pilots\\" are good pop rock songs that are solidified with a solid drumbeat and nice guitar work.  The album closes with \\"Isolate\\" which uses a myriad of instruments to induce a pleasant plaintive song.<br /><br />Unfortunately, there are no songs like, \\"When Its Cold I'd Like To Die\\" [[ASIN:B000002HGD Everything Is Wrong]] or \\"Porcelain\\" [[ASIN:B00000J6AG Play]], but about a third of the album is worth a listen.  Unfortunately, this could have been a great album for Moby if he experimented a bit more with the ethereal keyboards range that are so prominent here.  It's not great or terrible in any sense.  There are just too many songs that have the same backing electronic keyboards with little variation.  Hang in there.  Moby will surprise us next time.
B000ZEE3I6|5.0|`Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince' was a pretty good movie. Actually, it was better than I expected and one of my favorites. As with the rest of the movie, the plot moves as super speed as entire parts of the book are eliminated. This makes the movie feel a little choppy and dizzying, often. This is definitely not a stand alone film, and if you have not seen the others or read the books, you are going to feel very lost.<br /><br />The cinematography is amazing; it is the best of all the movies so far. The movie has amazingly breathtaking scenes, a great score and tons of action.<br /><br />This film follows Harry Potter, a wizard, through his sixth year at Hogwarts, a school for wizards. Harry is the chosen one, he alone has to the power to defeat Voldermont, a dark wizard who terrorized the magic world and killed Harry's parents. This movie centers around Harry learning more about how to defeat Voldermont from Dumbledore, the headmaster. This is also a movie that deals with character's relationships to one another as battle lines are drawn and romantic relationships deepen.<br /><br />However, tons of things were left out, as always. But, this felt more like they chopped away half of the book. Poof, these parts are no more. And they were important parts: explaining more about the Horcruxes, Slytherin's locket, the funeral, Harry and Ginny's relationship...<br /><br />And did the Inferi (corpses controlled by dark magic) have to look so much like Gollum?<br /><br />It was a very good movie. It felt pretty short (even thought it was 153 mins long) as a result of the chopping of many parts of the stories. But, I still liked it. A lot.
B0000DJE9R|5.0|Great photo foldout, exceptional sound quality, perfect selection of timeless hits spanning many years -- and even though right now I'm playing it on my less than stellar sound system, I can't say enough about the great tonal qualities that are consistent throughout the selections (just listen to \\"Smooth Criminal\\" and you'll agree with me).<br /><br />What more can I say -- that the music is breaking my heart right now, even though it's so beautiful? That Peter Pan was never supposed to die? That MJ's music is timeless to Eternity and back?<br /><br />The variety of selections on this CD are in keeping with the majestic sweep of Michael Jackson's repertoire, talent, beauty and complexity. This is something that will be played over and over again, because there is always something new -- an inflection, a word, a melody -- to discover in the well-thought-out selections presented here.<br /><br />M J's music kept me company up and down the East Coast as I drove my hot rod to one rod run or another, the music setting the tone for those very special days --- and the memories of that alone are bittersweet and unforgettable.<br /><br />In addition to the wonderful photos all through the foldout, and the decent amount of information about each song, there is a very beautiful \\"Special Thanks From Michael Jackson\\" section guaranteed to bring a lump to the throat.<br /><br />There will be many posthumous CD tributes of Michael Jackson's music in the future, starting now --  and many if not all, will be stellar. But this one, \\"Michael Jackson's Number Ones\\" can confidently stand among them in its own right as an already-fitting tribute.

As it was, I served 2 years during WWII, most of it after the war in Europe was over.  Cap't Winter has retired to his farm in Pennsylvania.  The Blu-Ray Edition in my opinion is far better in PQ & AQ.  I must have a very good BR player, because It produces such a good pic and sound, 5.1 DTS.  I ordered from Amazon and opted for their 2-3 day delivery.  It came in a large bubble type envelope via UPS in perfect condition in two days.  I, for one am ecstatic.  Shown on my 50\\" plasma HDTV, I have the best of both worlds.  By the way, there are many language subtitles for those of us who are hearing impaired.  Also Amazon beat other providers by about $20.
1847204031|3.0|My mouth watered when first I saw the publication of this title, as it promised a next step in the exploration of cultural phenomena from within a culture's view and vision of itself.  It has been my perception that the intercultural field has suffered from a plethora of models and mental paradigms that impose alien structures on the cultures to be studied and understood, and that the next task facing us is to see how different cultures define themselves and how they tend to look upon and evaluate others from their own cultural perspective.<br /><br />Myths are an important part of the construction of a culture. Their telling creates, reflects and confirms, as well as continually adapts the values of a culture to the moment in which they are being retold. One might call them the constructive-instructive tools of culture. They are too often left behind in the research, analysis and codification of what we call intercultural knowledge.<br /><br />This book brings together twenty studies that attempt to relate the myths of the country or region to the indigenous concept of leadership and its development in contemporary theory and practice. The framework of each study is identical, i.e., first, an exposition of the cultural myths or larger-than-life stories that speak of each people and of their leaders. The mythic characters may be anything from gods who shaped the universe as seen by a specific culture to real characters that shaped its history and have achieved mythic proportions in the cultural memory.<br /><br />Secondly, there is an overview of how leadership is perceived in each culture. This generally takes the form of seeing how some of the values in the mythology may be reflected or used in current leadership thinking or in the behaviors of select leaders in politics and commerce.<br /><br />There follows a look at the global and practical implications of leadership philosophy and practice within the culture. These are illustrated by one or more \\"commentary boxes\\" offering quotations from noted leaders. Each chapter is abundantly footnoted and referenced citing everyone from Aristotle to Ziber. The contributors to this book are by-and-large business and management scholars who see the relevance of both ethnic and organizational culture to their work rather than interculturalists, though they have some familiarity with theories of Hofstede and Trompenaars and occasionally cite where these theories break-down.<br /><br />That being said, there is great diversity in the approaches taken by the various authors to the selection of the mythological content and to their perceptions and recommendations for contemporary leadership. Some authors underline characteristics (and failings) in terms of mythical prototypes while others use these as a jumping off point to suggest or recommend the relevance and applicability of current management theory to the development of today's leaders.<br /><br />While the mythological summaries are of varying quality and depth, it was interesting to read these summaries in the context of leadership and the various opinions of how the myths were relevant to flesh and blood leaders of our times. On the other hand, the book as a whole tends to suffer from having an \\"undistributed middle,\\" that is, there is in most cases a lack of concrete evidence that the heroes of mythology provide models or types for the leaders of today. Rather, from an intercultural perspective, one is forced to ask more complex questions that seem beyond the perspective or at least the task of the various contributors, e.g., chicken-and-egg questions:<br /><br />* How do myths and heroes create cultural values? vs How do cultures create and continue to shape their mythologies?<br /><br />* To what degree is a leader (or anyone else for that matter) shaped by the heroes and myths in his or her cultural ambience? vs How do we make choices about our heroes in order to further the values we have chosen for ourselves or our group?<br/><br />* How much is hero identification, where it exists, a matter of intrinsic instinct and calling? vs How much conscious choice and reshaping occurs when leaders are chosen for their political or commercial value?<br /><br />Case in point. I was stunned that the editors, who are authors of the first chapter on the USA), chose \\"superheroes\\" as the mythic typology for understanding US leadership. There were were two cohorts of superheroes cited, those created around the startup World War II (1938-42), e.g., Superman and Wonder Woman, and those surrounding the height of the Cold War confrontations (early 1960's), e.g., Incredible Hulk and the X-Men. I found no significant mention of the socio-cultural context of their genesis.<br /><br />While the authors of this chapter do offer a table of advice about leadership behaviors taken from the strengths and weakness of each superhero, and, while archetypal US heroism may be reflected in these individualistic, usually loner-saviors of comic book and silver screen, they are not per se our prototypes, at least once we have outgrown our Halloween costumes. These are actually found in the frontier mentality and continue to be reflected in the Hollywood heroes and political posturing ad nauseam. The theme repeats itself beginning with the cowboy who drives the bad guys from town to the sci-fi world saviors, and currently, in videogames where the players can themselves play the role of the superheroes.<br /><br />While in many cases the mythology cited has archetypal religious roots religion is taken most seriously by the authors of the section on India. Surprisingly, though the author's of the US chapter mention that Superman echoes the Moses story, there is no mention of the role of religion in the most \\"born-again\\" of all countries where political and military leaders as well as commercial capitalists often ooze piety. Perhaps this is implicit in the choice of superheroes and myth, in that they represent the importance of reinventing oneself in this culture.<br /><br />While there is too much in this volume to comment on in detail, it is appropriate at least to offer some examples of insights produced by its reading. I bullet a few of them here:<br /><br />* Canada is nicely distinguished from the USA by its sense how the land and multicultural realities have shaped leadership.<br /><br />* The chapter on Israel traces the impact of the transition from a socialistic to and individualistic culture and the consequences on leadership.<br /><br />* The impact of external domination in Poland and Islamic ascendency in Iran are both illustrate how deeper, older cultural roots remain powerful forces even when they have been suppressed or superseded by other ideology.<br /><br />We know that within the same culture, the wisdom found one proverb (take risks) may seem to be contradicted by that found in another (be careful).  Yet these complement each other in the big picture. So too, the gods and heroes of myth do not provide a consistent story but a rich locus from which we may draw the values and behaviors needed for our times and our exercise of leadership. In this regard, this book seems more illustrative than instructive and invites a closer look at how we make our choices of leaders and how leaders make their choices.matter of intrinsic instinct and calling? vs How much conscious choice and reshaping occurs when leaders are chosen for their political or commercial value?

0307266303|5.0|Having been running for more than eight years now and going through a burn-out phase this book was an inspiration to regain my love for the sport.  I have also been plagued by minor injuries and pains and also been puzzled by why my feet hurt, I have tried various kinds of shoes and also discovered that what really mattered is technique such as the author suggests.  I am trying to adopt the evolution running techniques and have improved my speed, later when more confident in my technique I will trade my cushioned shoes for Nike Frees and try to experience in person the experiences of the author.<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed the concept presented that running is natural for humans and that it is ingrained in our DNA, we are descendants of the running man of the plains that could hunt withut weapons by simply running his prey to exhaustion.  We are physiologically (or al least the author defends this thesis) adapted to long distance running as we can cool our bodies more efficiently through sweat and also our feet and limbs are sturdy and rugged enough to carry us through very long distances and eneven terrain.  He also defends the thesis  that our feet were designed to take the pounding, provided we adopt an appropiate running technique and that the reason runners get injured has more to do because of excessive padding of modern running shoes that inhibit our feet to develop appropiately, he attacks persuasively the science that sustain the billion dollar industry of running shoes.<br /><br />The story about Caballo Blanco and his quest for the fabled Tarahumara racers in the canyons of Northern Mexico and later organizing an epic 50 mile race pitting the Tarahumara racers against the best ultramarathoners in the US including Scott Jurek was truly compelling, in the end the natural racer as the tarhumara had the upper hand against the technologically superior Americans.  One thing that united the Americans and the tarahumara was the joy in running.  The profiles of the runners and the races were truly well done.<br /><br />I will like to offer my sincere admiration to Mr. McDougall who took the courage to learn and participate in an ultramarathon, I wish I can follow his steps, it takes real courage and determination to do what he did.<br /><br />This book was truly amazing, and it could be enjoyed even if you are not a runner.

B002A4Q652|5.0|So take the beautiful vocals of Karen Carpenter, along with the piano sounds from their albums and then add a symphonic/soundtrackish metal backdrop and you have Delain's new album.  What a contrast!    The music is heavy in parts, peaceful in others and Charlotte's vocals are clean and pure as April Rain.  She really sounds like Karen Carpenter (USA pop vocalist from the '70s, look it up) and she never breaks out of that sound.  It's easy to listen to and very refreshing.      Since the band is Dutch there are a few pronounciation flaws, but otherwise her singing is beautiful and the music provides a good match and a good contrast.  I could do without Marko's (from Nightwish) growly vocals on \\"Virtue and Vice\\", but IMHO the album is great all the way through outside of that part of that one track.  One of my favorite tracks is the bonus track, \\"Come Closer\\".  It doesn't match the weight of some of the other songs, but the production quality is a match and the feel fits the rest of the album.      This album is a bit of a \\"chill out\\" compared to some of the bombast of Within Temptation or the crunch of Nightwish, but it's worth a listen if you love those bands and you're in a lighter mood.

0385737424|5.0|I finished this book yesterday but my brain is still buzzing with the enjoyment I got from it. For me, it was nostalgic; I grew up during that same time period. There were no cell phones or gaming consoles. There was no internet. We relied on TV shows, books and our friends,  family and selves for entertainment. I enjoyed being reminded of what that had been like.<br />What really struck me about this book, though, was its simplicity and its depth. Stead refers to A Wrinkle In Time by Madeleine L'Engle often, as it is main-character-Miranda's favorite book. While that's a wonderful book, well-loved by many, it's complex and sometimes hard to navigate. When You Reach Me employs the same sense of wonder and adventure but on a more believable and perhaps real level - Meg's story was special and probably wouldn't happen to just anyone (we don't all grow up in a scientific household allowing us amazing scientific insight), but Miranda's story seems like it could really happen to any kid. Thus, the story is more simple but its simplicity allows for further depth of characterization and for believably experiencing a short period in Miranda's life.<br />The relationships between Miranda and all her acquaintances feel real. Miranda is a middle-of-the-road twelve-year-old. There's nothing incredibly special about her so it's easy to identify with her and impose aspects of your own personality upon her. Plus, she's quick and funny, which makes her lovable. For the most part, the adults in her life are nurturing, supportive and insightful or are, at least, normal people - a nice change of pace from the dysfunctional adults often featured in teen fiction. Her friendships are geniune and reflect her understanding of her environment rather than the possible truths of her various relationships. That small detail makes her misunderstandings and reconciliations feel right, not contrived.<br />Readers of mystery and science fiction will soon figure out the plot, but Stead doesn't try to shroud the circumstances; everything is laid out to see as long as you're willing to believe in the possiblity of time travel. It's wonderful to watch Miranda unravel the mystery and change her own way of thinking about what's possible.he circumstances; everything is laid out to see as long as you're willing to believe in the possiblity of time travel.

B000VNMMQ6|2.0|I have liked some of the previous Die Hard films, but this one was just way way over the top.  The plot was beyond preposterous and some of the action scenes were just ridiculous.  I think the Transformers was more realistic than this.  I don't mind suspending logic, but when it gets to the \\"silly\\" level I lose interest.  The thing that gets me with these films is the same old re-hashed formula they use over and over again.  They make the cops/feds have zero IQ's and the bad guys are geniuses.  That is, until McClane shows up.  Then the bad guys all of a sudden have zero IQ's and he's the genius.  One of these days Hollywood is going to shock me and come up with something new and original.  Well, maybe not.
B0000041A9|5.0|Many people may find cello sonatas a great way to fall asleep but the five sonatas of Beethoven are vibrant and exciting chamber works. Beethoven composed his first two Cello Sonatas (op. 5) in 1796 and they are both in two movements.  The first movements begin with a brief Adagio before launching into fast-paced and piano dominated Allegro section. The second movement is a spirited Rondo. The second sonata begins with an expressive adagio where the cello is dominant.  The Allegro section is more passionate that the first sonata and the second movement Rondo is energetic with a dance-like melody.<br /><br />The third sonata was written in 1807-1808 and is in three movements and was composed at the time of the Fifth symphony.  The opening movement has a pair of wonderful lyrical melodies that the cello and piano explore.  This is flowed by an engaging Scherzo with a fast-paced trio.  The finale movement consists of a brief Adagio before taking off with an exuberant melody.  Beethoven followed the Adagio/Allegro pattern in his fourth sonata from 1815.  The fourth is a lyrical sonata, shorter than the others, with the cello as the dominant instrument. The fifth sonata is also from 1815 and is in three movements. The opening movement has a dynamic melody with excellent interplay between the instruments. The Adagio is the only movement of its kind among the cello sonatas and has a somber but heart-felt melody.  The Finale is played without a break and, after the introduction of the melody, flows into a fugue.<br /><br />The three variations for cello and piano are early works from the 1790s and 1800s. Two of the works are based on themes from Mozart's Magic Flute with the other using Handel's See the Conquering Hero.<br /><br />The music of the sonatas is inventive, reflective and witty.  In these sonatas the piano and cello function pretty much as equals.  There is a great deal of interplay between the instruments and depending on the sonata either instrument leads withthe melody with the companion picking it up.<br /><br />One could not ask for a more fabulous combination the Mstislav Rostropovich and Sviatoslav Richter performing the sonatas.  The singing tone of Rostropovich is marvelous to behold and Richter is a superb partner.  The sonatas were recorded in 1962-1963 when both Rostropovich and Richter were at the performing height. The variations are played by the distinguished composer Jean Francaix and cellist Maurice Gendron.
B000ZEE3I6|5.0|That about sums it up.       The whole point of this film, the whole point of the movie as well.    At the hidden entrance to the cave, when Dumbledore cuts his hand to spill his blood in order to open the secret passage, and Harry says he should have done it, where in Dumbledore answers with the aforementioned line, is the whole reason for the film and the book. Not just to discover Voldemorts weakness, or to try and destroy him, but for Harry to try and finally realize just how precious he is.      That is the main point of the film, and I was very glad to see it.  There were alot of changes made to the film, but changes that I felt were warrented and appropriate. We, as Harry Potter movie fans have seen the big huge epic scenes! We had Dumbledore's and Voldemort's duel at the end of Order of the Phoenix, in the same movie we had the duel between the children and the death eaters. In Goblet of Fire we had Dragons, and amazing broom flights, and in all the other films we had fantastic Quidditch games and mesmorizing magic being performed in classrooms.      What I felt the film brought focus on was the relationships of Harry and Dumbledore; Harry, Ron and Hermione; and just the children in general, because as us Potter fans know those relationships are pivotal in the last book, and therefore also in the last films.      The deletions made sense to me, the film was smaller, more self contained. It was a relationship drama, not an epic battle film, that's for \\"Deathly Hallows\\". We fans have the book to read for the thrill of Dumbledore's army fending off the Death Eater's, and the extra little pieces of information. This film was about finding who you are and doing so with little help from the one person you most rely on.  It was about Harry's journey into realizing what he has to do, and that he can't and ultimately couldn't have Dumbledore's help or protection to get it done.      On the film side: The kids acting has improved leaps and bounds.  Emma Watson and TomFelton (Hermione and Draco) were both very impressive, particularly Tom as Draco especially in the bathroom sequence and in the clock tower. Rupert Grint as Ron has shown just how great of a comic actor he can be.  Daniel as Harry is phenomenal and has improved leaps and bounds since Goblet of Fire.  The stand out performances for adults were the AMAZING Michael Gambon as Dumbledore who brought tears to my eyes with his powerful and stunningly gut wrenching performance.  Jim Broadbent as Horace Slughorn the new Potions teacher was delightfully funny and also a bit sad as well with his distant and pale sadness.  Helena Bonaham Carter as Bellatrix Lestrange was amazingly insane and evil in this one, loved her, and although under used, I always adore every second of time Alan Rickman's Severus Snape is on screen.    The effects were amazing as well, and unlike a few of the previous films the were in no way meant to be a spectacle, in fact most of them seemed rather in the back ground letting the characters be the main attraction.  The cave of the Horocrux sequence was impressive (the infiri were CREEPY!)  And the burning of the burrow was rather impressive even with the saddness of the scene.     The tone of the film all though the films rating was PG rather than PG-13 like Goblet and Order before it, was actually much darker, which allowed the teen romance to give a great balance and needed lift to the whole affair.  I loved the film from start to finish, it was well made, well acted, and well thought through.      I know ALOT of people will fuss at my lack of caring that alot of stuff was changed or that things were added or omitted, I simple feel that the film worked well as a character piece about love and loss, and what is needed to take action and move on and discover your meaning; and this was the purpose of this film, in my opinion.

B000ZEE3I6|2.0|I found Half-Blood to be very depressing and even worse, so predictable! There is no greater sin in writing a story, except being boring! The story also made no sense. No, I did not read the books, nor would I ever waste my time. The only strength in the world of Harry Potter is the bond amongst friends. This strong sense of friendship and loyalty is the only reason this annoying film was given two stars instead of one!<br /><br />I guess that's the reason why I, and many other people, keep going to the theater. Of the six films, only the previous one, \\"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,\\" felt enjoyable and made plenty of sense. In Half-Blood, I'm amazed that you can kill off a major character and have even Harry Potter, himself, going around saying: \\"It was a waste, it had no meaning. He died for nothing.\\" How ironic when a story's main character literally sums up the ENTIRE story!<br /><br />I had high hopes for Half-Blood! I don't like seeing Harry Potter and all the other \\"Good Guys\\" being so powerless/clueless, or a main character turning into pure evil for absolutely no reason, whatsoever! (I should be able to know what's going on by not having to read the books. I have watched every film in order, but it still made no sense!)<br /><br />What is obvious to me is that the Harry Potter series has become a commodity like toothpaste and underarm deodorant! Lets stretch a very thin storyline into as many billions of dollars as possible, and see all the star-struck idiots spend their money! Sorry to say, Harry Potter could have easily been condensed into a trilogy and if Half-Blood was never written/filmed it would not have harmed the Harry Potter storyline ONE iota!<br /><br />Sorry, but when the grand finale(s) (I just heard the ending is being split into two movies! What a surprise) comes out, I'm skipping the theaters and  I'll watch it when I can see it for free. I have spent enough money on Harry Potter movie tickets and I have no intention, whatsoever, to waste another penny on making the writers and filmmakers of Harry Potter, richer!<br /><br />SEE: [[ASIN:0452270057 Bad Movies We Love (Plume)]] and [[ASIN:3639085213 Film as Commodity: A Critical Discourse Analysis of Newspaper Film Reviews]]ing the writers and filmmakers of Harry Potter, richer!

B000S0GYRU|1.0|I'm a huge horror movie fan. I've seen greats like the Chucky films, Friday The 13th remake, House Of The Dead and Cursed more times than I can imagine and I enjoy obscure horror films like IT. I was reading online that Dario Argento was a great horror director so I downloaded \\"Suspiria\\" to see for myself. The plot was really stupid, what's so scary about a ballet dancer going into a witches' coven? As I continued subjecting myself to it I discovered that NOTHING in it was scary! It didn't have enough gore, over-produced special effects or a really scary looking killer. Another minus was that it's really old. Skip this and check out the films I mentioned earlier for quality horror.

From the issues of pets and pies to cautions regarding eating plants that are not correctly identified this volume is heartwarming and yet heartrending.  I chose it first to gain insights into hard time living but it's more than just a novel.  The female main character Juliet is endearing and I so much prefer to glean the real life experiences of this miserable war from a fictional perspective.  I love that it's also available in paperback now.

I said that I wanted to get a live album so he said \\"You got to hear Live At Leeds by The Who!! It's the greatest live album ever!\\". If you've read my previous reviews I have expressed by dislike for The Who and how I think they're generic classic rock for aging hippies, but I decided to give them a second chance. Bad idea! The singer's voice was cracking throughout the album, the drumming is sloppy and all over the place, there is WAY too much talking between songs, the guitar is below mediocre and the bass sounds ridiculously bad. All of the songs are boring, unoriginal and all sound the same. I'm returning to the mall tomorrow to trade it in and use my money on another Nickelback poster.<br /><br />For some REAL great live albums you should listen to these instead:<br />Live at Sturgis 2006- Nickelback<br />Live Trucker- Kid Rock<br />Where The Light Is- John Mayer<br />The Final Riot!- Paramore<br />Tonight Not Again/Live at Eagles Ballroom- Jason Mraz

I was shocked that she wanted me to see this, because both of us know that movies made before 1990 are horrible. I was hesitant to watch this because it's so old but I decided to give it a shot. What a mistake!! People who pass this off as a \\"comedy\\" are ridiculous, as this movie was VERY unfunny.

Who doesn't love Johnny Cash? His music connects with people across the planet from all kinds of backgrounds and people that might have almost nothing more in common than they like Johnny Cash. The Folsom Prison recording was my first real introduction to Johnny Cash while riding down highways and country roads through Appalachian foothills to do some backpacking with friends. It was a perfect listening experience and haven't forgotten how much I enjoyed it to this day. This performance will always be in my collection.
B001PPLJJ0|5.0|I took me awhile to watch this feature, I finally did once I saw it avalible on iTunes, so I downloaded it to my iPod touch and my goodness! This movie blew me away! It's been a long time since i've seen a movie that's directly aimed at adults, genius written, beautifully shot. There wasnt one complaint coming from me.
B0006L0LNY|3.0|The film was entertaining and Halle Berry was funny and quirky. The special effects were distracting. Sharon Stone makes a great villian.
B001MW0J2O|1.0|Rated number three so far this year! Well this group and its noise pretending to be music and art can fool a lot of people it seems, but not me. I can suggest to you at least 500 albums that are out this year that you would enjoy more. It is pretentious, unmelodic and repetitive. Do I need to say more?
1400095204|3.0|My friend recommended this book to me and prefaced it with \\"youre going to love it.\\" I can say that I was fairly disappointed in this book.    I feel as though the base story line is a good one, however, it is extremely drawn out and difficult to keep track of the characters.  For me it could have ended about 250 pages sooner than it did.    I feel like there are much better options that this book if you are looking for literature about Africa
1416562605|1.0|Maybe I'm out of the loop, but how this book won any awards is beyond me. I did buy it based on other reviews and the fact it did win the Man Booker Prize but will let that serve as a lesson to me not to base buying decisions on those facts in the future.    This character is pathetic and his story is a long time telling, not much happening but the demise of the antagonist, who is weak at best.    I hate to devote any more precious time but hope I have prevented YOU from making the same buying mistake I did.     Enough said...keep shopping...

B001QOOCTE|5.0|Saw clips of this DVD on Bill Moyers a while ago and waited several months for its release.  Brought me back to the 1960's when people  were more linked together by the beauty of music and individuals and groups were diverse but had the common chord of love and kindness for  humanity.  The songs are simple and heartfelt.  So good to see these  elements resurrected and the seeds budding again.  Highly recommended for all ages.
074325144X|5.0|I'm in the Air Force.  I needed to speed up my run time.  this book shaved off 2 min total on my 1.5 mile run test.  And I only just started reading chapters 1,2,3,4.  I'm now on about chapter 7.  This book offers allot of well written advice.  Running is something I like doing anyways, Now I really love running.  PS I just got out of neck surgery 3 Months ago.  And with this book helped me reach my goal of an 8 min mile.
B000683VI4|5.0|This is a beautiful love story about a man who loves his wife even though she sometimes doesn't know who he is.  I hope my husband loves me if I get Alzheimer's and stays by my side as he did.  The beginning love story was great but the ending was beautiful.
B00284BMBM|5.0|As the American Idol machine rolls on, the talent level as a whole seems to increase, but the over-saturation in the pop scene doesn't necessary equal post-Idol success. But then there was Daughtry...    This guy knows how to rock! The new disc, \\"Leave the Town\\" is great from start to finish. It has an excellent balance of straight-up rock, ballads, and radio-friendly tracks. I just finished listening through it again and, much like the first Daughtry offering, there isn't a song that I even remotely consider skipping. The highlights for me:    Excellent: You Don't Belong, Every Time..., Life After You, September, Tennessee Line    Great: No Surprise, Open Up Your Eyes, Ghost of Me, Learn My Lesson    Good: What I Meant..., Call Your Name, Supernatural    I am a rock fan, mostly hard rock and alternative (Shinedown, Incubus). I say: Don't hesitate to buy this disc. If you loved Daughtry #1, you will love this one too!
B000K7VHQ4|4.0|ED NORTON and pretty JESSICA BEIL headline this flick.They do a good job . And this is a well done film and noticeably good production values.  Story is about an Illusionists who powers captivate the public while he amazes them with his act and his seemingly endless powers. Beil is a childhood friend that re appears in his life as the love that didnt have a chance to blossom. The meet up again and hence we get this story. It was good althoough u do have to suspend any relistic beliefs in what becomes the illusionist act. I was able too accept it as an interesting film with a unique theme and good performances. 4 stars out of  5
B001GKJ2DO|5.0|Mamma Mia is one of the most enjoyable musicals of recent times to be available on dvd.  The rousing upbeat songs of ABBA are set to a nice story.  Simple, but totally entertaining.  I think it deserves additional praise, because the music was not really created for this production.  Rather, they were carefully and expertly arranged and placed to a much later production.  The performances are great, and obviously the actors are having a good time with the film.  The second dvd included is actually very interesting and well done, and it explains to the viewer how upbeat everything involving Mamma Mia seems to be.  A truly \\"feel good\\" thing to enjoy and watch over and over.
1573300403|5.0|There are a couple of top reviews here that name everything in the video, so I won't go into too much detail on that. But I will justify my 5 stars to note that there are a few things here that may be hard to find for some people. A reviewer pointed out that the Motown 25th \\"Billie Jean\\" number had songs cut off, well, that is true and that does suck, I agree, but I'm sure I taped that on a VHS...10+ years ago and don't have it/can't find it/video won't play, so it is nice to have it again on DVD. I think this was a great performance, but to make it a true Michael Jackson experience it should have included his ENTIRE performance.     That said, we also get a performance from the 1995 Grammy Awards that is very good, great dancing, lovely performance and even get a dabble of MJ talking. Loved his soft, sweet voice. I bought this for \\"Smooth Criminal\\" and there are several versions of this video, but this is an extended cut, even if there are a couple minutes cut off. Consider it the \\"long\\" version.    \\"Scream\\" is also a goodie, with two of my favorite Jackson's having fun, dance battling and just kicking butt in a great video while bashing the media at the same time. Priceless.     However, you can certainly tell the sound quality is very poor. For me this is most evident watching \\"Thriller\\" No base, no nothing, it sounded very flat. You can tell a bit on \\"Smooth Criminal\\" too. That is really bad. I also hate duel sided DVD's. Very cheap in my opinion.  Scene selection is OK, and I do like the title cards for each video, and love the teaser with MJ walking among soldiers to unveil his massive statue of himself. He had no idea how sexy he really was.     Overall, this video needs a third disc with more videos. It definitely leaves something to be desired. But the fact that there are a few things that are hard to find, even on YouTube in some cases, is great. I know we all saw these performances/videos in 1993 or whenever they aired, but those were usually once in a moment times on shows that were never rerun. That's it, they're gone. And when are actually videos shown nowadays? I don't want you to think you're getting great golden gems in extras anyway, basically it's a way for you to have some of his videos, maybe some of your favorites and a couple of nice live performances at hand. This is probably his best video DVD compilation to date.
0316096199|5.0|Great book!  Alice Sebold's account is brutally honest and entertaining at the same time.  I was rooting for her the whole way through.
B00297FEUS|5.0|OK, I think we should all get past the Disc 1 error and realize that replacements are being shipped as we speak.  I just received an E-mail from Dr Rhino which tells me I will get an E-mail as soon as they ship my disc, if you sent them an E-mail with a digital photo you will also get this E-mail.  Let's hope the disc comes quickly and the sound is better, can it get worse???, then the reviews will all be positive.
1897299214|5.0|Graphic novels as travelogues is not as common as they should be but they are starting to pop up a lot more.  Guy Delisle's visit to North Korea was amazing and a tad weird.  I am surprised, after some of the things he did, he was allowed to leave.  It almost makes me wish I could get a job in North Korea so I can see if half of the book is true.  Maybe if North Korea allowed tour groups in?  Visit one of the last remaining Communist nations!  SEE clean streets!  WATCH volunteers work around the clock!  ENJOY living without power!<br />Frankly, did remind me a little of 1984.
B00062IVKS|5.0|\\"Raging Bull\\" is aggravating to watch.  As an enormous fan of Scorsese's pre-2000 work, the catalogue of innovative, dark, gripping, and overall classic works that he did seem to be given the most praise, yet the least rewards.  Knowing that DeNiro won an Oscar for this film, knowing that Pesci was nominated (but lost) and knowing that Scorsese was also up for one of those prized trophies, yet lost - is extremely aggravating.  Martin Scorsese is one of the most influential directors of my time, and probably my parent's time as well.  His body of work ranges from angry Taxi Drive, to a suspicious boxer, to a documentary about a Band, and even a comedy about New York after hours.  The list could go on, yet modern audiences only remember him as the guy that brought us \\"Gangs of New York\\" or \\"The Departed\\", two decent films, but nothing of the caliber that his work from the early 70s had.  How can anyone say that \\"The Departed\\" was more of an Oscar contender than \\"Mean Streets\\"?  So, upon watching \\"Raging Bull\\" for the first time - I was filled with anger and frustration.  \\"Raging Bull\\" is one of those near perfect films that was released in the 80s, yet still seems powerful and relevant today.  Perhaps it is the skill of Scorsese behind the camera to give us a non-linear biography of a man who has no trouble destroying his own life.  Perhaps it is the sharp editing that takes, what could have been your average sports movie, and transforms it into this pioneering black and white, quick cut by quick cut, journey into the darkness of man.  Or perhaps it is the actors, Pesci and DeNiro doing what was genius at the time (Pesci seems to have never let go of Joey La Motta in any of his future roles), and giving us lines, words, and actions that will remain in our minds long after the film is over?  Perhaps.  Everything about \\"Raging Bull\\" was perfect, yet the Academy turned away for \\"Ordinary People\\", thus Scorsese had to wait for the sympathy win to finally claim his victory.  Anyone else find that aggravating?<br /><br />Enough of me on my soap box trying to justify why Scorsese was robbed early in life, and let's talk about what made \\"Raging Bull\\" so exciting to watch.  To begin, the casting of both DeNiro and Pesci was brilliant.  The two of them had this chemistry (which would try to be duplicated again and again in \\"Goodfellas\\" and \\"Casino\\") which Scorsese could not have imagined.  They brought to the screen a true presence of two brothers growing up in New York in the 40s, trying to cope with both fame and possible infidelity.  There are points in this film where one has to question the sanity of DeNiro's La Motta and also be amazed by the way Pesci is able to keep up with DeNiro's rage.  The two of them are the glue to this film.  Their scenes are intense, yet delicate.  They command the scene, yet give more of their character to you than most of today's actors.  Then, like a pioneer in his trade, DeNiro does this amazing transformation from a guy hoping to make weight to a man gaining to demonstrate his downward spiral.  It was like watching Bickle shave his head - you just cannot find determined actors like this in modern cinema.<br /><br />To add to the amazing caliber of acting that Pesci and DeNiro commanded, \\"Raging Bull\\" demonstrated that Scorsese was a force to be reckoned with.  Not only did he take the idea of a sports story and spin it on its head, but he also redefined the genre.  Black and white cinematography, the slow-motion shots, the use of violence and language set in the 40s, and these brilliant moments where words make all the difference.  One cannot watch a Spike Lee Joint today without seeing how Scorsese influenced them - his work, especially in \\"Raging Bull\\" can be seen through today's cinema releases.  While my only argument with this film is the length of the picture versus the slowed scenes, I don't fault Scorsese for that.  Schrader and Martin's screenplay wasn't perfect, but thankfully with DeNiro, Pesci, and Scorsese at the helm, the fuzzy edges were able to be cleared up.<br /><br />I cannot say how influential this film was watching it for the first time.  It is dark, it is depressing, yet the bold color of the characters - despite the black and white - come through stronger than other films watched this year.  The acting is more than Oscar-worthy, they define this film and the early 80s era.  My favorite scene was the shots of when La Motta was actually happy with his family - the shots filmed in color allowed us to see these characters as more than just celluloid imprints; they became real.  My favorite sound - the flashbulbs going off during each match - this was just brilliant.  Scorsese took an already iconic image and showed how his keen perception was able to make it better.<br /><br />I cannot wait to watch this film again.<br /><br />BRAVO SCORSESE, BRAVO!<br /><br />Grade: ***** out of *****sese at the helm, the fuzzy edges were able to be cleared up.

B002BPQ0Y2|5.0|From the first song to the last, this whole album is GREAT !!!<br />\\"It flows.\\" is the best way for me to describe it.<br /><br />The lyrics are very smooth, slick and very powerful.<br /><br />The whole composition was thought out and mixed perfectly.<br /><br />This is the only Album that I was completely happy with every song that I listened to. And each song was not \\"cranked\\" out like most \\"artist\\" do.<br /><br />The B.E.P. are apart of my \\"core energy\\" if they continue this type of work.
B001DQH8Z0|5.0|Too many people are stuck in the past, when attempting to rate music that came after their favorite bands. I've ever heard a better album within the Stoner Doom Metal Genre. If I could rate it higher than 5 stars, I would.
B000ZEE3I6|3.0|This movie was really slow to me. I have never read the book so I don't have a comparison between the two. I was pretty much bored until about the last 35 to 40 minutes. The movie really picked up around that time frame. The story and a lot of the action come together during this time frame. The special effects and the cinematography were pretty good. It was the story that was a little too slow for me. My 10 year old son read all the series and told me he liked the book better than the movie. This movie is really for hard core Harry Potter fans.
B0017I1FO4|5.0|This CD simply rocks in a way that no other disc has in years! Just when I'd given up hope on \\"new\\" music, along comes a CD that lets me know someone out there still \\"gets it\\", and that band is Shinedown. I heard a few tracks from this one (the Sound of Madness) on the radio, and thinking back to earlier songs by the band (such as their amazing take on \\"Simple Man\\"), I decided to give it a shot. I'm glad I did. From the absolute [...] \\"thump\\" of the title track and \\"Cry for Help\\", to rock ballads such as \\"Second Chance\\" and \\"What a Shame\\", every track is delivered with conviction and with amazing vocals. And it all works. OK, I'm not a huge fan of \\"Cyanide...\\", but that is the only track I skip on this CD (even after listening to it dozens of times now). I normally don't like reviews which compare one band to other bands, but I have to say, this one is like taking the best of Nickelback, Foo Fighters, Daughtry, and perhaps Staind, and putting a touch of \\"Southern Rock\\" spin on it (while leaving out everything that annoys -- at least me -- about those other bands). This CD takes me back to the days when performers could (gasp!) actually sing with some melody and sensitivity without being \\"wusses\\". Acts such as Boston, Heart, etc., knew how to rock... and knew how to deliver a moving ballad as well. This CD is like that -- only maybe even better! As someone else here already said, the only problem is, I can't seem to get the dang thing out of my CD player!
B0018QOIXU|5.0|Angelic voice, talented girl, great tracks :)<br />Hometown Glory and Daydreamer are the best tracks.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|I viewed this movie with the complimentary tickets granted by Chipotle at an independent movie theater here in the Portland area. This movie is a must see for every American.  The companies mentioned in the movie DO NOT want you to see this, as it would threaten their very evil existence. It was shocking to learn the companies can sue you for criticizing them in any shape or form.  The food chain is out of control here and something needs to be done to bring it down to earth again.  We cannot keep consuming the way we do. The problems of today, are a result of a system gone awfully wrong, and in the hands of a few, who want to personally gain from it.  They are not looking out for the interests of you and me, but merely their own pocket books.  This movie will educate the consumer that we DO HAVE the power to stop such practices. We do have the power to change something for the better.  It's not just another pep rally movie to promote some alternative lifestyle....These are facts and they affect EVERYONE of us....Definitely looking forward to the DVD and will purchase to share the knowledge with all I know.
0439023483|5.0|I loved this story! Katniss is a true heroine! The \\"reality tv show\\" idea truly reflects the sad voyeuristic obsession in our present culture, and it takes it to the extremes - a once-per-year fight to the death for the nation's youth. The book is a winner from the beginning, but once the \\"Game\\" begins, it's very hard to put down! Katniss' defiant nature is not only what makes her endearing, but it's what helps her through her whole experience in the Game. I look forward to book two!
B001G60FTI|3.0|This book came in good condition; but due to some mail error, it took over a month to receive.  I had to recontact the company to find out what had happened and when I would receive the book.  I would not deal with this company again.
B00006F7S4|5.0|This CD is on my short list of desert island discs, you know, if you were stranded...and could only have 10 CDS, etc... BTW: I would also have Beck's Midnite Vultures...    and that brings me to this point: both CDs are totally different and fantastic. Beck has such a range, he can do it all.    These melodies on Sea Change are beautiful. Carefully listen to it. I often listen to this at work at my desk since it is on the \\"mellow\\" side.    I love the whole package. These songs meant something to him ( like everyone says, a breakup). They mean a lot to me, too. I remember the loss I felt when my best friend died in Lonesome Tears. I think of the loneliness I had after I divorced in Guess I'm Doing Fine.    Songs like these represent times in one's life. (I am not a depressed nut, because Midnite Vultures has some great fun songs that are wild, sexy and addictive...there are tracks on that one that remind me of many fun and good times I've had. I LOVE that CD just as much as Sea Change!)    This CD is a timeless classic, written and performed by a genius.
0061231401|3.0|The whole premise of an underground world power capable of taking on whole armies and bombing with impunity one of the 7 Wonders of the World is a bit much.  However, I will read Rollins again because I love his \\"conjectural\\" history.  I found myself hitting Wikipedia more than once while reading the book.  This is not great art.  It is simply an escapist purple prose book.  Okay, here is just one example.  Our hero gazes longingly at his lost girlfriends breasts as she is dying from poison and he is likely to become impaled on brass stakes.  Really?  I am sure that I would be considering a woman's breasts as I was about to plunge to my death and she die of poisoning.  But as I said, I will read Rollins again and again I will scoff at the improbable and impossible.
B001R0KH3M|5.0|Ok, so I'm a big Stevie fan but I can honestly say this is one of the best live performances I've ever seen.  It starts a little slow, but the last hour is vintage Stevie and you will watch it over and over again.  He does ALL of his hits and it's fantastic.
0385737424|5.0|I've been struggling over how to begin this review. I want to get it exactly right. I want to convey to you precisely what it is that I mean to say. If you've read any of my reviews before then you know that I like lots of stuff. There is, quite frankly, a lot of stuff out there to like. So what I have to do here is convey to you just how this book is, pretty much, one of the best children's books I have ever read. Here's an idea. Have you not heard of When You Reach Me by Rebecca Stead? Well now you have. Go read it. Have you already read When You Reach Me by Rebecca Stead? Excellent. Glad to hear it. Now go read it again. Have you already read and reread When You Reach Me by Rebecca Stead? That is fine and dandy news. Have a seat. You and I can now talk about it, and we'll wait for the rest of the world to catch up. Which they will. Because it is one of the best children's books I have ever read and books of this sort do not drop out of the sky every day. They don't even drop out of the sky every year.<br /><br />Now the conundrum. The book is sort of a mystery. It's sort of a lot of things and if I go too deeply into what those things are, I'm going to give away elements of the plot. This is not something I wish to do for you because the true pleasure of this book lies, at least partly, in figuring out what the heck it is. Is it realistic or fantastical? Science fiction or religious? So I just won't talk about the end, or go too far into the premise. Therein lies the problem with reviewing a book of this sort. I can't talk about it without potentially destroying the experience for somebody out there. You can't imagine the pressure. And I think I can summarize the plot without giving too much away, though. Here goes . . .<br /><br />It's the late 70s and the unthinkable has occurred. While walking home, Miranda's best friend Sal is punched in the stomach for no good reason. After that, he refuses to hang out with Miranda anymore. Forced to make other friends, Miranda befriends the class yukster and a girl who has also recently broken up with her best friend too. But strange things are afoot in the midst of all this. Miranda has started receiving tiny notes with mysterious messages. They say things like \\"I am coming to save your friend's life and my own\\" and \\"You will want proof. 3 p.m. today: Colin's knapsack.\\" Miranda doesn't know who is writing these things or where they are coming from but it is infinitely clear that the notes know things that no one could know. Small personal things that seem to know what she's thinking. Now Miranda's helping her mom study for the $20,000 Pyramid show all the while being driven closer and closer to the moment when it all comes together. When you eliminate the possible all that remains, no matter how extraordinary, is the impossible.<br /><br />You know how sometimes in literature or writing classes a teacher will assign a first page of a novel as an example of a \\"good\\" first page? The kind that grips the reader by the throat and gives `em a good hard shake? Yeah. This book has that first page. You are gripped from the start. Then the plot begins its slow backing and forthing in time. We're in April of 1979 . . . and then we're in August or September of the previous year. The jump back and forth isn't jarring, it just requires that the brain be a little more awake during the reading. In fact, there are a lot of moments in this book that would come off as confusing or impossible to understand were it not for the fact that Stead is keeping a close and steady eye on the whole proceedings. What could be a muddle or a mess is instead a gripping mystery with moments of touching realizations and truths cropping up left and right.<br /><br />Another sign of a good book: the whole show-don't-tell rule of storytelling comes into play time and time again. Miranda casually mentions facts about the people around her that define them and bring them into sharp focus. The fact that she was named after the Miranda's Rights or that her mom won't let her eat grapes because of how the grape pickers are treated in California. The same can be said for Miranda herself. She's defined best by sentences like, \\" `Nice tights,' I snorted. Or I tried to snort, anyway. I'm not exactly sure how, though people in books are always doing it.\\" The book is an amazing mix of humor and depth. On the funny side are mentions of things like the SSO's, which stand for the strawberries at the corner sore that fail to fulfill their promise and thus are deemed \\"strawberry shaped objects\\". On the other hand, the implications at the end of this book can be sad. Sad and interesting and fascinating all at the same time. Kids may find themselves contemplating free will by the story's end. There are worse fates in this world.<br /><br />The crazy thing is that it's also the kind of book that kids will really really like AND the kind that award-giving librarians will really really like. We aren't usually so lucky. There's a kind of broccoli and peas mentality to great works of children's literature sometimes. This idea that if something is well-written that it can't possibly be interesting as well. And even crazier than that is the fact that this isn't going to appeal to just one kind of kid. It's going to be adored by both boys and girls. By kids who are into science fiction and kids that refuse to touch anything but truly realistic stories. Heck, you could even label this book historical fiction since it takes place in 1978-79. And not the fake 1979 that you sometimes seek invoked in bad television shows and movies either. This is an accurate portrayal of a time period when a person really could spend their days helping their mom prepare for a stint on the $20,000 Pyramid. A time when a girl could be handed books with pictures of spunky-looking girls on the covers... and subsequently reject them because they are not A Wrinkle in Time.<br /><br />Stead also foreshadows subtly, which is a near impossible thing to do. I've been reading a lot of children's books lately where you'll get near the end of the chapter and there will be this big sentence in black and white reading, \\"Years later she would look back on that moment and wonder what would have happened if she only hadn't blah blah blah.\\" Or \\"It would haunt her dreams for years afterwards.\\" Or \\"Had she known then what she . . . \\", you get the picture. Stead does allude to the future, but subtly. There's a moment when Miranda mentions that she hadn't been in a particular store since December, then flashes back to November or so. If you're paying attention, you're left wondering what's going to happen, but not in a way that intrudes on your reading experience. It's a subtle move on Stead's part. Foreshadowing with stealth.<br /><br />I've been calling it [[ASIN:B00005JNOG Lost]] the book, referencing the television show that leaves you with as many questions as this novel initially does. But unlike LOST, the answers are forthcoming. And the crazy thing is, it all fits together. Every little piece of the puzzle. You end up rereading the whole thing just to watch the puzzle pieces fall into place before your eyes. The kind of rereading that Miranda does to A Wrinkle in Time. I have a theory about that book, by the way. I believe that author Rebecca Stead may have read and reread that book just like Miranda does when she was a kid herself. I mean, who else is going to spot the time travel flaw in that book? How many times would a person have to read it before they caught on to what was going on?<br /><br />In the end, there's a darkness to When You Reach Me. A darkness and a depth that pulls you in, but somehow doesn't depress you. I guess some kids will get depressed. The kids that only read light, happy stories where everything turns out sunshine and roses, sure. But for the reader that really gets into it, When You Reach Me is fun, challenging, and able to reach a whole swath of different kinds of readers. Without a doubt, it's one of the most fascinating children's novels I've ever read. You won't find anything else quite like it on the market today.ldren's books lately where you'll get near the end of the chapter and there will be this big sentence in black and white reading, \\"Years later she would look back on that moment and wonder what would have happened if she only hadn't blah blah blah.\\" Or \\"It would haunt her dreams for years afterwards.\\" Or \\"Had she known then what she . . . \\", you get the picture.

I've been calling it [[ASIN:B00005JNOG Lost]] the book, referencing the television show that leaves you with as many questions as this novel initially does. But unlike LOST, the answers are forthcoming. And the crazy thing is, it all fits together. Every little piece of the puzzle. You end up rereading the whole thing just to watch the puzzle pieces fall into place before your eyes. The kind of rereading that Miranda does to A Wrinkle in Time. I have a theory about that book, by the way. I believe that author Rebecca Stead may have read and reread that book just like Miranda does when she was a kid herself. I mean, who else is going to spot the time travel flaw in that book? How many times would a person have to read it before they caught on to what was going on?    In the end, there's a darkness to When You Reach Me. A darkness and a depth that pulls you in, but somehow doesn't depress you. I guess some kids will get depressed. The kids that only read light, happy stories where everything turns out sunshine and roses, sure. But for the reader that really gets into it, When You Reach Me is fun, challenging, and able to reach a whole swath of different kinds of readers. Without a doubt, it's one of the most fascinating children's novelsI've ever read. You won't find anything else quite like it on the market today.
B00284BMBM|1.0|What was Chris thinking?  Maybe I have the answer-Toooo many number one videos on the rigged VH-1.  Maybe touring with Bon Jovi's country flavored tour. Hey, Chris you haven't been doing this long enough to change your style.  I wanted to like this cd I listened to it about 5 times and found myself liking it less.  The rock is watered down and very little there.  The last 4 songs are unlistenable and its a toss which is worse Tennesse Line or Call Your Name.  If you like the 1st single No Surprize than buy and download the single you'll save money. Just for the record No Surprize is the best track on cd and just weeks after release the song is old already.  So do your self a favor preview before you buy.    I really don't undestand all the 5 star ratings. His 1st cd was 5 stars (which what i gave and you can go back and read that review, so I am a fan). Maybe everyone should go back and replay it so you can compare it.
B0017ZB8M6|5.0|Fun CD to workout to, drive around and sing along as you run errands!  Aside from the hit songs, there are other upbeat tracks that might get stuck in your head.  Highly recommend!

B000Y7U98W|4.0|Director Danny Boyle (\\"Slumdog Millionaire\\", \\"Millions\\", \\"28 Days Later\\", \\"The Beach\\" and \\"Trainspotting\\") had been inspired by classic sci-fi films such as \\"Solaris\\", \\"2001: A Space Odyssey\\" and \\"Alien\\" and now it was his opportunity to direct his own sci-fi film.<br /><br />\\"SUNSHINE\\" is a British sci-fi film released in theaters back in 2007 and featured a screenplay written by Alex Garland (\\"28 Days Later\\" and \\"The Beach\\"), music by Underworld (\\"Vanilla Sky\\", \\"The Beach\\", \\"Batman & Robin\\" and \\"Trainspotting\\") and cinematography by Alwin H. Kuchler (\\"Proof\\", \\"The Deal\\" and \\"Code 46\\").<br /><br />The film would revolve around an Earth saving mission set by Earth's Icarus II who have set out towards the sun.  Because the sun is dying, Earth has previously sent the crew of the Icarus to detonate an experimental nuclear bomb in order to reignite the sun.  But somehow, something happened to the crew of the Icrarus and thus, two-years later, a new crew of the Icarus II need to finish their mission to reignite the sun.<br /><br />The film would be different than most films as the talent would comprise of International talent which Director Danny Boyle wanted to showcase how mankind has evolved in their space programs.  Also, each actor had to go undergo method acting and in the film, the crew of the Icarus II had lived together for 16 months.  So, in order to capture that, the talent had to live together and take part in space and scuba training, zero G training, operating a Boeing 747 flight simulator and taking a tour through an actual nuclear submarine.  Also, to watch films such as \\"The Right Stuff\\" and \\"For All Mankind\\" plus researching the effects on a ship's crew while in space .<br /><br />VIDEO & AUDIO:<br /><br />\\"SUNRISE\\" is one of those films that will be noted for its picture and audio quality. The film is presented on Blu-ray via 1080p High Definition (aspect ratio 2:35:1) with an AVC @ 16MBPS.  Although the film takes place in the far reaches of space and there is rarely any interaction with anyone outside the ship, simply as this film is not a \\"Star Wars\\" or \\"Star Trek\\" type of film, each time Icarus or its crew are shown near the sun or interacting with the sun to crew walking through the corridors, colors are well-utilized.<br /><br />Despite being in space, there is great use of certain colors, not through clothing design but through various lighting.  The sun showcases the amber orange and reds, while the corridors and engine or oxygen planting areas showcase blues and greens.  Blacks are nice and deep and overall, picture quality is solid.  There is grain seen through the film but I would rather have film grain than overuse of DNR and this film looking soft.<br /><br />As for audio, awesome utilization of audio.  Great use of the front channels for the Underworld score, center channels for dialogue, LFE is heavily used throughout the film and surround channels are quite immersive.  Overall, the DTS-HD Master Audio soundtrack for \\"SUNSHINE\\" is exceptional and you literally hear the audio all around you.<br /><br />The film is also presented in English, Spanish and French Dolby Digital 5.1.<br /><br />As for subtitles, \\"SUNSHINE\\" is presented with English SDH, English, Spanish, Cantonese and Korean subtitles.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES:<br /><br />\\"SUNSHINE\\" comes with quite a number of special features.

One one side, it's quite creative of how the scenes are cut, some may find it creative, so may find it annoying.<br /><br />The storyline is the same.  The first half of the film features a clear plot of the crew trying to survive and accomplish their mission, the story switches gears in the second half of the film as it goes from survival film to horror/slasher film.<br /><br />In a way, when I was watching the film, I was expecting a cross between \\"2001' and even \\"Solaris\\" but the film changed and next thing you know, things just change and everything becomes dark and bleak.<br /><br />As a Blu-ray release, \\"SUNSHINE\\" has so much going for it.  Awesome picture and audio quality and hours of special features.  But as a film, knowing the kind of films that Danny Boyle has done, I guess you can say that thereare surprises in store for the viewer.<br /><br />But for those expecting a film about a crew trying to defy the odds and survive their mission, as the first half of the film seemed as if \\"SUNSHINE\\" was heading that direction, Danny Boyle rips the carpet right under your feet and gives you something different for the second half.<br /><br />Some may be upset of how the film just changes to a horror/slasher film but I think that for those who enjoy Danny Boyle and Alex Garland's work, it's best to assume that they know quite well of how to change the situations of their films and give us a darker side to the characters or their environment.<br /><br />With that being said, \\"SUNSHINE\\" is such a beautiful film that is meant for a High Definition release and its immersive audio soundtrack enforces that.  But it all comes down to the viewer and what they're open to.  I personally enjoyed the first half of the film but the second half was not what I was expecting and thus, became disappointed because of the change of direction.  But I should have known better, knowing that Director Danny Boyle was at the helm, Boyle is one of the top director's known for his film and surprising audiences.  So, it's never good to feel that the characters will always be safe and there always has to be some sort of uneasiness on the viewer's part that bad things are more than likely going to happen.<br /><br />And  those who appreciate Boyle's previous work and want a near perfect transfer of the film, will definitely enjoy this Blu-ray release.  \\"SUNSHINE\\" is one of those love it or hate it films.  It's hard to deny a film that looks and sounds great and comes with so many special features and all that went on behind-the-scenes.

B001GCUO1Q|2.0|This was a rock-em, sock-em movie. When the plot got slow, they threw in another fight scene. I found the amount of violence disturbing. If it hadn't been based on comic book characters, I doubt the movie would have received a PG-13 rating. Not recommended for young or sensitive children.
0312263511|5.0|I didn't know much about Gene Cernan until I saw the film \\"In the Shadow of the Moon\\" and found him to be articulate, charming, thoughtful, and direct.  I wanted to read more about him, and this book is a winner.  It's worth reading for the description of his first spacewalk alone, but that is not the end of it.  He comes across as a really classy guy and is especially frank about the cost of him being a successful astronaut on his first wife and their daughter.  His tribute to his father is also very moving.  Some of the stories are both hilarious and reflective.  He tells a story about when he visited the White House and couldn't resist sliding down a banister. That is a great story, but he finishes it off by relating it to Andrew Jackson opening up the White House to the common people, and the horror that Jackon's contemporaries expressed.  It's the combination of personal stories and literate reflection on the meaning of his life and accomplishments that I really liked.  I really, really loved his descriptions of Dere Slayton Al Shepard --- not much intimidated Geno Cernan, but being assigned backup for the Ice Commander on Apollo 14 did.  His integrity following his helicopter crash before Apollo 17 is also inspiring.
B000TU16GS|5.0|This book was one of the best books I have ever read.  Iwould recommend the entire series to anyone.  It has everything, action/adventure/romance/eduvation. It rocks I hope everyone reads it and sees the movie because it is totally worth it!!!!!!!!!!
B00005JKGO|5.0|This is one three-hour film that needs its entire running time to make its point. I have to confess that, with the sole exception of Nights of Cabriria, I am not a big Fellini fan, so I approached this film with some misgivings. And the first hour, which includes some dreadful parodies of American movie stars and British journalists speaking very wooden English, begins to feel excruciating. It's this first hour, too, that plays into all the \\"Felliniesque\\" cliches, with the big-busted Anita Ekberg and the Bacchanalian party scene. All this \\"swinging Rome\\" stuff seems pretty dated. But then there's a point suddenly at which Fellini's overriding structure for this film - successive nights of partying and dissipation forming a sort of downward spiral in the life of the protagonist - becomes clear and the film becomes increasingly engrossing. The film begins to rise above being a sensational cultural artefact of the 1960s into a real portrait of a disintegrating Italian society that seems timeless and important. In these successive nights, Marcello Mastroianni's character parties with pseudo-intellectuals and decadent aristocrats and fails to make emotional bonds, except for one small, quiet conversation with a teenage girl in a roadside cafe that ends up being, perhaps, his only one moment of real connection with anyone in the entire film. As a reporter, meanwhile, he also spends one night witnessing a mob scene at the site of a purported \\"miracle\\" (a sighting of the Virgin Mary) that nicely lacerates religion, the working classes who feed on it, and media hysteria, all in one astonishing set-piece that Spielberg clearly looked at when designing the end of Close Encounters. Visually, La Dolce Vita is misleadingly bland and even a bit cheap-looking in its opening scenes, but, starting with the late night odyssey through Rome with Anita Ekberg, it suddenly develops a real visual poetry and vocabulary all its own. It's that rare film that seems to grow in importance and depth as it progresses towards an elliptical ending of surprising impact. I'm still not a huge Fellini fan, but this one I like.

B000ZEE3I6|3.0|As a huge Harry Potter fan who has read the last two books with excitment and breathlessness, I had come to this film prepared to accept that the film is always different from the book and that I should steel myself. And I did, briefy, till I started to see the glaring omissions in this film that were left on the cutting room floor.  Yes, I am well aware that the whole book cannot be filmed, understandable, but the heart of the book is Tom Riddle and the mystery of the Half blood Prince, anyone who is a true Potter fan should take no issue with that.  So riddle me this with the following glaring holes in this film that are central heart of the story--let's a look at them...<br /><br />There are a number of flash back scenes that build Tom Riddle's character. We get two. No mention of his affection for Hogwarts, or why Dumbledore was drawn to him. No mention of how he forms the cruxis of the death eaters while he is a student there, which includes Snape.<br /><br />Our wonderful Wizard's hand- how did it get that way? Harry barely registers any surprise.  Why show his hand if you are not going to explain how he got that way and how crucial it is to the story.  Makes little sense.<br /><br />The Half Blood Prince.  The whole counter point to Tom Riddle is Snape. It is barely given a glancing blow in the film and Alan Rickman's role is wasted as his entire back story is thrown to the cutting room floor. Why spend so much time with this character if you are going to gut his part in the story.<br /><br />Silly Teen Romance. Yes we all enjoy the moments of light humor and teen angst, but why amp it up so high for this one and leave all the good stuff on the trash pile.  There is way to much silliness in this film that takes away from the story and all I wanted to do was go back to the real tale each time they deal with this nonsense. Rowling new that these romances have to play a back shadow to much larger issues in the story, the directors decided after all the criticisms that the film was becoming increasingly dark that they'd lighten it up.  Big mistake.<br /><br />Harry and his connection to Tom Riddle is also given no shrift at all, not even short shrift. Hell, The Dark one himself other then The Tom Riddle flashback, makes no appearence.<br /><br />The last twenty minutes are from the last part of the book, so how can you forget the dumbledore funeral and battle with the death eaters when malfoy lets them in. gone!!<br /><br />The heart of this movie is left out, and I fear audiences are embracing it because it is Harry Potter. Please go read the Half blood prince so you can see what you are missing. You wont regret it. It's a masterful book.  It is a shame the directors could not take the proper time and care to give it its due.increasingly dark that they'd lighten it up.  Big mistake.

B0011ZNAIC|5.0|I thought this movie was going to be the typical kids movie, I loved that it had adult jokes in it, that I am sure kids wont get. It was a really great movie that I know I will be watching numerous more times. If you think that this movie is just for kids your missing out on a great movie that can be enjoyed by all.
B001KR0BDI|4.0|I love this book.  I first read the paper version through the library.    I bought the Kindle version because I knew I would want to read it again and again. My only complaint with the Kindle version is there is no Table of Contents and therefore no easy way to jump to a particular chapter.
B000ZEE3I6|5.0|As a diehard Harry Potter fan, I really enjoyed HARRY POTTER AND THE HALF-BLOOD PRINCE.  Yes, there are cuts and edits.  This movie has the same problem that all book-to-film conversions have:  you cannot put all of the detail into the film that a writer puts into a book.  As it is, HARRY POTTER AND THE HALF-BLOOD PRINCE is nearly 3 hours long.  IMHO, the writers, director, and editors did the best jobs that they could, and this time they succeeded in giving us most of important plot points without making HARRY POTTER AND THE HALF-BLOOD PRINCE into a multi-night miniseries.<br /><br />Almost everyone knows or is at least familiar with the 7-book saga of Harry Potter written by J. K. Rowling, so I will not go into a detailed description here.  Suffice it to say, that with the exception of some minor edits and changes, the film is pretty true to the basic plotlines of the book.  Harry is the Chosen One; he must defeat Voldemort.  In HARRY POTTER AND THE HALF-BLOOD PRINCE, Harry learns more about the history of Tom Riddle, why he became what he is, and what he must do to defeat him.<br /><br />Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, and Emma Watson continue to shine as they bring Harry, Ron, and Hermione to life.  It has been fun watching these kids and their characters change and grow.  This trio has done an unparalleled job in bringing these internationally beloved characters to life...their casting 9 years ago was farsighted and inspired.  They ARE Harry, Ron, and Hermione - exactly as I always imagined them to be.  Of course everyone in the Harry Potter films has become the personification of their characters.  From Dumbledore to Snape, McGonagall to Mrs. Weasley, Hagrid to Filch, Luna to Neville, and Draco to Riddle, these outstanding performers have created a very special and unique world, near and dear to all of our hearts.<br /><br />One of the best parts of HARRY POTTER AND THE HALF-BLOOD PRINCE was that the fun and humor are back.  This HARRY POTTER film is not as dark or bleak as the more recent films have been.  The writers and actors do a fantastic job of portraying the angst, goofiness, and raging hormones of teenaged love.  I laughed a lot watching this film, something that was sorely missed in the last film.  To quote Dumbledore, \\"That was fun!\\"  And it was!<br /><br />Of course, changes and cuts had to be made to the story to keep HARRY POTTER AND THE HALF-BLOOD PRINCE from turning into a marathon.  While some will moan and groan over these edits, it is important to remember that all the little details, the vivid description, and needed exposition that make this world so real to us just simply cannot make the transition to the big screen.  Instead, we get color, depth, music, voices, facial expressions, body language, scenery, animals, people, and special effects to bring this world to life.  In the case of HARRY POTTER AND THE HALF-BLOOD PRINCE, it seems to be a very successful trade off.  All the important plot points are made, and the final two films are well set up.  I am also going to hazard a guess that a few of the missing story lines from HARRY POTTER AND THE HALF-BLOOD PRINCE will be moved into the next film, and that makes good sense to me.<br /><br />Overall, HARRY POTTER AND THE HALF-BLOOD PRINCE was fun, funny, and familiar.  The magic is back, and it certainly worked wonders on me.  HARRY POTTER AND THE HALF-BLOOD PRINCE is MOST HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.more recent films have been.

B00284BMBM|5.0|\\"Leave This Town\\" in my mind, is even better than Daughtry's first album. Every song is great. Here is my review of each song:    1. You Don't Belong: What a way to kick off the album. New style for Daughtry a lot harder than most of their songs.  Rating: 8/10    2. No Surprise: Big change from the first song. But so much meaning.  Rating: 9/10    3. Every Time You Turn Around: Going back to the styler of \\"You Don't Belong\\" not the best but it's still good.  Rating: 8/10    4. Life After You: I believe the best song on the album. Just great, everything about this song is great.  Rating: 10/10    5. What I Meant To Say: Who can't relate to this song? This song is right up there with \\"Life After You\\" but it could be longer.  Rating: 9.5/10    6. Open Up Your Eyes: So much meaning has gone into this song.  Rating: 9/10    7. September: Slower song. It is good though. Not their best but Chris' voice while singing makes it good  Rating: 8/10    8. Ghost Of Me: Another great song. Daughtry just can't stop having great songs.  Rating: 8.5/10    9. Learn My Lesson: I'm running out of things to say. Every song is just great this song they know just what to say to make a song meaningful.  Rating: 9.5/10    10. Supernatural: Not my favorite. It's alright but not their best work.  Rating: 7/10    11. Tennessee Line: Daughtry turned to Chris' country voice for this song. Everyone knows that he could be an amazing country singer but this song doesn't go along with the rest of the album but it's okay.  Rating: 6.5/10    12. Call Your Name: Great way to end the album. As I said before Daughtry puts so much meaning into each song and the whole album.  Rating: 8.5/10    Daughtry hit it big with this album. I believe that \\"Leave This Town\\" is way better than \\"Daughtry\\". Every song has so much meaning.    ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!
B001FB4W16|5.0|True Blood is great TV, and while not as psychologically deep as some of HBOs earlier hit shows (like The Wire or The Sopranos) it is a multi-layered show that looks at some of the deeper prejudices of American society.  True Blood has a little bit of everything--romance, sex, violence, along with lots of vampire mythology for the vampire fans out there.<br /><br />If you are a fan of the show and you have access to Blu-ray I highly suggest you pay the extra money for the Blu-ray version of this show.  After watching the show on both standard def DVDs and on Blu-ray, there is simply no comparison.  The colors are richer on Blu-ray, particularly in the night scenes, where the dark colors don't simply blend together but really pop.  The image is also just crisper overall.  The sound is also better, with more layers of the soundtrack readily audible on the Blu-ray version.<br /><br />Sometimes TV shows are dissapointing on Blu-ray, since the initial filming of the show was not done on high enough quality media to produce an acceptably sharp Blu-ray version.  However, its clear the crew of True Blood were keeping Blu-ray in mind when they shot the show because it just looks great in this format.

B0013E5HEG|4.0|This lion from Schleich is very realistic in how detailed it was built. In my opinion it surpasses in detail the male lions of Papo and Safari LTD, although its probably smaller than either of those. Fun to have and great addition to many collections.
B00004TL2N|4.0|Although some readers will doubtless be disappointed at the brevity of my remarks, I really do not have much to say this time around. My choice is clear, and I see no point to belaboring the obvious: the Boulez is the clear winner in this contest.<br /><br /> Tintner takes the work much more slowly than Boulez, and perhaps this is part of the problem (although I must point out that one of my favorite recordings of the score is an RCA recording by Gunter Wand, who also stretches it out over two disks, so speed is not the only factor at work here). All I know is that whether I listened to the two versions on my big system at home or on my small system at work, whether I listened intently or merely had the music playing almost as background music (for shame!), the Boulez always got me involved with the music and the Tintner always made me long to be listening to something else. Boulez brings the music to life, while Tintner just seems to be playing through it. Part of this may be because of the orchestras involved: it is hard to beat the Vienna Philharmonic, and on this occasion, they were having a very good day indeed.<br /><br /> Sonically, neither recording is demonstration-class. Both are more than serviceable, but neither is truly outstanding. The Tintner seems a bit more distantly recorded, the Boulez a bit more energetic and dynamic. I prefer the sound of the Boulez version, but not by so wide a margin as I prefer the Boulez performance.<br /><br /> Although the Tintner offers two CDs for a price less than the single Boulez CD, the Boulez CD is clearly the better value in my estimation. Not only is it somewhat better sonically, it is significantly superior in terms of performance.
B000TSUCAQ|3.0|I bought this cookbook for my husband because he loves Star Wars. It was the pictures that made me want to buy this book. Each entree has a fun name like: Twin Sun Toast, Hoth Chocolate, Skywalker Smoothies, or Mos Eisley Morsels. And each page has a fun picture of the entree with Star Wars figurines.<br /><br />Our cookbook goes along fine until page 38, then it jumps to page 47 until it reaches page 52, then we get pages 45 & 46, then 39-44, then 53-60.<br /><br />Other than that confusion (which might not be in all the copies, who knows) I thought this was a really great item. My son LOVES it and could care less that the pages are out of order.
B00000IFP6|4.0|No matter how many sets and/or individual recordings you might own of Beethoven symphonies, this series by conducted by David Zinman is something you just can't afford to pass up--and at its bargain price, this is a set that retirees and graduate students alike ought to be able to afford. The performances are swift and bracing, the sound quality is clean and natural. At full price, this would be a highly recommendable set (particularly the disks of 3&4 and 9, which are among the best available at any price, and gee, 5&6 and 7&8 are awfully darned good, too--I must confess that I hardly ever listen to 1&2); at Arte Nova's rock-bottom pricing, these disks are unbelievably great bargains that should be snapped up ASAP by anyone who enjoys Beethoven.<br /><br />Addendum:  I wrote the above when this set was fairly new.  Over the years, I have come to regard the 9th out of this set as just not as good as I thought when I first heard it.  It just sounds too brash, and too strained.  Still, this is a great bargain set overall.

B00000IXL1|5.0|Right after 11/9 Dionne Warwick came to Amsterdam (Carre Theater) and though for her this was just another performance,at certain point of the evening she got audience in the palm of her hand completely - we were all stressed and worried because of possibility of thrid world war - suddenly she softly introduced her next song,saying it's an old song but it's meaning is strong today as ever.  And by God,she sailed right into slowed-down \\"What The World Needs Now\\" and got us all reduced to tears,the whole damn theatre sniffing and crying - it was truly a magical moment (funny enough,I never cared for that song before but it did sound powerful and moving that particular evening).    That song is included on this CD together with 20 other hand-picked songs composed by Burt Bacharach. Majority of them were written for Warwick,though other singers often covered them and even charted with their versions (ask Cilla Black about it).  It really is high-quality, classy 1960s pop and though personally I think Warwick grew up to be better singer in later years, this is where her legend was built.
0385335997|2.0|I really do not understand reviews that basically tell you the whole plot of the book beforehand.  Personally, I like to know OTHER books reviewers like (to create a yardstick) and also compare this book to others the author wrote.  Please do NOT give away the plot in  your review people!!!  For me, Diana Gabaldon is the yardstick in which I evaluate all other books.  I am a voracious reader, I read about 2-4 books a week, 95% fiction. I like romance, (but only if it has a great plot, not \\"bodice rippers\\". ) Time travel, and fantasy.  This authors characters are so alive you might really, really believe they are real!  Her books are not for the \\"weekend warrier\\" type of reader, they are wordy and long.  For me, this means I miss a lot the first time around (ADD!) so I get to read them over and over, enjoying new things each time.  Her history is correct and these books might spark an interest in Scottish or European history.  The entire Claire/Jaime series is incredible, for anyone who enjoys outstanding writing, even if this is not your first pick of genre.    p.s.  I rated this book  5 stars but it came out 2 and would not let me correct it when I clicked edit.

B000VBP38C|4.0|I unfortunately saw this shortened version of \\"Prejudice\\" before seeing the acclaimed BBC TV one with Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle--and yes if you want to quibble--the BBC one is the winner. But I'm still keeping this one because of Joe Wright's direction and the apt casting of Keira Knightley in one of her best roles to date.  The HD DVD copy is brilliant and all the colors of the English countryside make you feel that you're there.  Though Matthew McFadden may lack the irony of Colin Firth's gem like performance as Darcy, he is acceptable.  Regardless if you still have an HD DVD unit, this one is available at a very low price since no one is manufacturing them anymore.  Also it may be quite some time when this does arrive in the Blu-ray format--and at a much higher price than $6!!  Still recommended for Austin enthusiasts and romanticists, male and female alike.
1577314808|5.0|A good friend of mine gave me this book with description \\"you must read it if you want to change your life\\".  Opinions like this one always make me smile, I do not believe in drastic changes, although I was going through a period in my life when the changes would be welcome.  So I started reading and finished this book the next morning. Actually I never finished this book, I am re-reading it regularly to keep it's contents fresh in my mind.  Tolle's book allowed me to see what major issue I had with myself (please pardon this personal digression) - I was just \\"thinking\\" too much. And this \\"thinking\\" or rather mental noise kept me away from keeping things in perspective, from realizing what information to keep and how to process it.  I highly recommend this book to anybody willing to do some \\"mental work\\" and to enter the path of self discovery - you will be surprised what new horizons await you.
0930289234|4.0|I'm sure I'm courting fanboy wrath here, but I finally got around to reading \\"Watchmen\\" and I gotta tell ya... it ain't that great.<br /><br />Oh, believe me, it's helluva a comic book (\\"graphic novel\\" is a pseduo-intellectualized marketing term).  And as a work of imaginative fiction and innovative storytelling, it is impressive.  I quite enjoyed reading it.  I found it very interesting at several points, and even intellectually challenging (Alan Moore does love big words and literary references), but I just can't bring myself to think of it as some towering literary accomplishment for the ages.  I suppose I'm just reacting to some of the slavering hyperbole heaped on in it by the geek squad (and I'm a proud member of that nerdy fraternity, mind you).  Some times, things can be victims of their own hype.  I think that's the case here.<br /><br />So go ahead and read \\"Watchmen\\" for yourself, if you're at all interested.  It's certainly worth your time.  If you approach it with a open mind and take it for what it is (a really excellent comic book), you'll be rewarded with a compelling text-and-visual story rich enough to appreciate on multiple levels.  Given how much dreadful junk is out there in every medium, \\"Watchmen\\" really does stand pretty tall.  I definitely tip my hat to it.  I'm not going to genuflect at its altar though, fanboy piety be damned.<br /><br />[...]

0525421033|5.0|\\"Everyone thinks it was because of the snow. And in a way, I suppose that's true.\\"<br /><br />When Mia and her family go out for a drive that snowy morning, none of them realize everything is about to change in If I Stay (2009) by Gayle Forman. It was a freak accident. A random act. But suddenly, a truck swerves into their car. The next thing Mia knows she is staring down at the dead bodies of her mother and father. She can't find her younger brother, Teddy. What Mia does find is her own broken body being rushed to a hospital.<br /><br />Before the accident Mia had a lot of decisions to make about her future. Should she follow her first love--music--to Juilliard in New York? Should she stay on the West Coast to be with her boyfriend? But after the accident, Mia only has one choice. Should she stay?<br /><br />Readers learn about Mia's past while she tries to make this impossible decision. Present scenes of Mia watching her body at the hospital are interspersed with snapshot flashbacks of the life Mia used to have: discovering the Cello, meeting her best friend and her boyfriend, and memories of her idyllic family. Separated from the \\"current\\" story of the plot these segments could almost be jewel-like short stories on their own.<br /><br />Mia's relationship to music adds another dimension to the story and makes it a likely choice for musicians. The romantic aspect of the story is another strong point. Finally, it's probably a really good choice for anyone who has found themselves waiting for good news outside and Intensive Care Unit.<br /><br />I barely have enough words to say how much I loved If I Stay. Everything about this book is beautiful from the cover to last line. There was an authenticity to the hospital side of things that was simultaneously jarring and comforting. At the same time, this is also a wonderful story. Forman's writing is lovely, evoking all of the characters in vivid detail throughout the story. While Mia's loss is devastating, the story ultimately also has a calming quality that only helps to underscore the beauty of the writing and comfort readers that, no matter what her decision, Mia will find peace.only helps to underscore the beauty of the writing and comfort readers that, no matter what her decision, Mia will find peace.
B001MYIXAC|5.0|If you are looking for a true art form of a vampire film, this movie is it..its truly one of a kind and truly a fresh idea on the idea of vampires..not since movies like Fright Night, The Hunger and Salem's Lot has a movie truly had so much art form. Now dont get me wrong, this isnt the best vampire film, but, its one of the best in a long, long time. This film is \\"cute\\" in way, but, with meaning and the dubbing kinda sucks..but, it can be looked over, but, mostly its look of the film. Dont not over look this film. Highly Recommended!!!
0671646788|3.0|This book has a copyright of 1987, but it reads more like it was written in 1957. It's not that the information is bad, it is just very basic. If you're completely new to the genre of self-improvement it might be of some help, but otherwise I would look for something a little more advanced. On the plus side, it is a lot of book for the money.
B000ZEE3I6|4.0|After the utter disaster that was the Clif's Notes movie version of \\"Harry Potter and The Order of the Phoenix\\" (see my review for that film), I was filled with very great trepidation that this series was entirely doomed.  I went into the theater half expecting that David Yates and Co. would butcher yet another great book.    I must admit that I was wrong.    \\"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince\\" is a good movie!    There is a lot to like about this film, and the criticisms I have are relatively minor.      Before I discuss details, I'll say this, though:   What is most important is that they got the FEEL of the book right.  There is emotion here, thank goodness!  Laughter, sadness, romance.  Wonderful!  Thank you, Steve Kloves, for writing a good screenplay!   Welcome back!   (Kloves was the screenwriter for every HP movie other than OOTP.)     Now, down to the details...  (I'll put in here *SPOILER ALERT*, but you kinda should expect that.)    Every time a book is converted into a movie, the two main criticisms that lovers of the book have are ones of omission and commission.  That is, the moviemakers either leave out beloved scenes, or choose to add their own scenes that AREN'T in the book.  Being somewhat of a purist myself, I usually prefer that the movie stick as closely to the book as possible, like Lord of the Rings mostly did.  However, a movie is a movie and a book is a book---so the real question in my mind is whether or not the omissions and commissions are basically positive and make a good film.    OOTP did both of these things badly-- it left out really important stuff, and the stuff it added was just bad.    HBP mostly did both of these things well-- it left in most of the important stuff, and (other than one thing) added mostly good additional scenes.    The movie begins with Death Eaters wreaking havoc in Muggle London, and Harry Potter putting the moves on a pretty Muggle waitress.  There is no meeting with the Muggle Prime Minister, like in the book.  (I'm fine with that--- you have to cut SOMETHING.)  Things are looking bad.      Harry and Dumbledore visit a potential new Potions professor, Horace Slughorn. Harry manages to convince him to come back to Hogwarts--- as he learns later, because has something that Dumbledore wants, and he thinks Harry can get it from him.    From there, the movie pretty much follows the plot of the book fairly closely.  Most well-loved scenes from the book are here--- some done better than others, but all are mostly OK.      One thing that the screenwriters added that I think was actually an IMPROVEMENT over the book is that they flesh out the budding romance between Harry and Ginny, and between Ron and Hermione. (To be honest, in my opinion the relationship between Harry and Ginny wasn't given enough development in the books-- one of the few criticisms I had of the books.)  These additional scenes are really done well.  They are heartfelt and subtle, not cheesy at all.  I really loved the scene on the stairs where Harry and Hermione comfort each other because each is in love with someone who is currently with someone else.      I won't parse the rest of the film, since everyone basically knows the plot.  But most things are done well.    Now, onto my several minor criticisms.    First of all, the filmmakers added a scene which I felt was gratuitous and stupid, and which added nothing to the story at all.  In one scene the Death Eaters attack The Burrow and destroy it.  That was just needless and heartless.  The Burrow was the one place where Harry could feel safe, and to destroy it felt like a kick in the gut for no reason.  You know, as long as there is a Shire to go back to, there is always something to fight for.  To destroy the Burrow-- the one place Harry felt most at home--- was a serious misstep as far as I'm concerned, because it just made the whole endeavor now feel hopeless.  Seriously, WHY DO THIS???  This was the one major mistake I feel the filmmakers made.A couple other minor criticisms are that I felt that the movie Slughorn could have been a little sluggier and and little more pompous.  The movie version was a little too normal for my liking.  Not horrible, still pretty good--- but not great, and not as memorable as the book.    Another thing I think might have been better was the actor who played the teenage Voldemort.  I was a great fan of the actor Christian Coulson who played Tom Riddle in Chamber of Secrets.  He got the teenage Tom Riddle down perfectly--- charismatic, enigmatic, charming, with just a touch of an undercurrent of danger--- and TOTALLY memorable.  The young actor who plays Tom Riddle in this film plays him more creepy, less human, and entirely less charming, charismatic and memorable.  He plays him like those creepy kids who roam the hallways in The Shining--- and kind of looks like them too.    One other things I was a tad bit disappointed in was that the Great Hall in this film is not as great as those in the other films---- I don't know how they did it, but this Great Hall is much SMALLER!    However, let me reemphasize:      Other than those minor complaints, Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince is a GOOD movie, with heart, feeling, romance, action and intrigue.  A worthy contribution to the HP movie canon.      Enjoy!
B001HN69AE|5.0|this movie more then met my expectations. it had everything that a good dragonball story would have in it. it was full of action drama and humor it was a plesent blend of all genres wich is what dragonball is all about the show went through so many incarnations from fantasy to sci fi, to comedy, and this movie really captured the spirit of the show, it was everything you could have asked for in a dragonball movie i highly recomend it.
B0013FXWU6|5.0|No Country For Old Men and There Will Be Blood have often been compared with each other. This is due to the fact that both were from the same studios (Miramax & Paramount Vintage), and were in production at the same time (and right next to each other). I don't see why people should argue which film is better than the other. They're two completely different films. NCFOM is based on the novel by Cormac McCarthy, while TWBB is based on the book \\"Oil!\\" by Upton Sinclair. NCFOM is set in 1980, TWBB is set in the early 20th century. One's about violence, the other's about greed. And so on. But I do admit, I slightly prefer NCFOM over TWBB, mostly because of the silent suspense and the absolutely creepy performance of Javier Bardem. But TWBB is still a great film as well.<br /><br />As I've said before, this film is mostly about greed and how it affects us and the people around us. Daniel Plainview (played by the excellent Daniel Day-Lewis) is a wealthy businessman who relies on oil for his profits. Accompanied by his adopted son H.W. (Dillon Freasier), both individuals are led to a barren California city called Little Boston. There, they discover oil that's been leaked out of the ground due to a recent earthquake. With careful planning, Daniel attempts to buy the entire city, with just a few issues at hand. A young man by the name of Eli Sunday (Paul Dano) wants $10,000 to build his church, The Church of the Third Revelation. From this point on, it's a battle between religion, hypocrisy, wealth, and family.<br /><br />Like NCFOM, TWBB tends to be very slow-moving. I see this in a good way. This film doesn't move too quick because we get to see the characters being clearly and fully affected by the oil that's sleeping underground. They are fully realized, as the slow pacing helps us understand these people. Speeding it up in a Hollywoodized way won't help since this is indeed a character-driven story. With the slower and steadier way, there is no confusion on what's going on, and the partial ambiance that surrounds the movie adds to the tension between Daniel and Eli. Speaking of Daniel and Eli, I just have to say that the actors have done a splendid job. Before this, I've seen only one film that stars Day-Lewis: Last of the Mohicans. He was absolutely amazing in that film, and he is even more amazing here. You never know when he's going to lose his temper, or what he's really going to do in the next scene, which makes the character even scarier. Meanwhile, according to imdb, Dano had only four days to prepare for the role of Eli, since another actor had to be replaced for reasons unknown. Thankfully, he was able to pull it off. The quiet determination of the character is fully realized, and you can never tell if he's a hypocrite or just someone who thinks he's seen God. As for the supporting cast, they play their parts very well. The one exception here is Kevin J. O'Connor: he's seems very wooden at times. But other than that, Dillon Freasier and the other supporting actors can be very believable throughout the entire film.<br /><br />Almost everything else in TWBB(cinematography, set designs, etc.) are flawless. And I say almost, because I had just one tiny problem. A few music cues that are chosen here don't seem to fit the scenes that they play in. But the music can be very appropriate at times, like Johhny Greenwood's percussive \\"Convergence\\" when both tragedy and success strike in the middle of the film. The piece itself adds greater suspense and drama in this very important part of the film. TWBB overall is one of the more marvelous films of 2007. Day-Lewis deserved the oscar, as well as Robert Elswit for the stellar cinematography.<br /><br />Grade: A-ial ambiance that surrounds the movie adds to the tension between Daniel and Eli.

0307277453|5.0|Shubin simply and beautifully lays out what science has shown us about how our body plans evolved to the point we are at now.  If skeptics of the fact of evolution read this book with an open mind, they will be convinced by the evidence Shubin lays out from paleontology and anatomy.  However, what I really enjoyed was his coverage of embryology.  Many creationist books I had read growing up made the claim that embryology was completely discredited, but this book showed me how utterly false that claim is.  The evidence for evolution from the field of embryology is incredible when it is clearly explained without deliberate distortions.

B000P2A24W|1.0|I just got this tonight and gave it a listen. I was not a fan at all of Have A Nice Day except for the title track, but I was hoping this cd would sound more of the rocking Bon Jovi. It does not. This is like pop meets country and it sounds horrible. There is not one track on Lost Highway that I enjoyed listening to. Obviously by the 4 1/2 star rating some people like this direction Bon Jovi is going in, but I am not one of them. There isn't really any trace left of the Bon Jovi that put out the amazing Slippery When Wet album. If you like pop/country then this cd may be for you, but if you are a fan of old school Bon Jovi then you are going to be sadly disappointed. The only similarity between 2008 Bon Jovi and 1980's Bon Jovi is the band name.
0374530718|5.0|Gaarder wrote this book in response to the dearth of READABLE intros to philosophy out there.  He said that when he was wandering through a bookstore he saw a huge new age section and a tiny philosophy section.  Even those few philosophy books available were not readable and, perhaps more importantly, not entertaining.  He worried that people (children especially) would be mislead to the new age section and not the philosophy section.  Gaarder has nothing against new age writings but makes one simple point.  Philosophy has been addressing the same questions new age writers have for MUCH longer and with MUCH clearer answers.  They are the guides leading us through the forest.  Unfortunately, at this point in time, philosophers haven't made a lot of efforts to make those answers clear to nonacademic philosophers.  Gaarder fixes this.  Having read several philosophy intros (from Russell's book to Copleston's bricks) and much more specialized texts, I assert that this is without qualification the single BEST, most ACCURATE, and by far most ENTERTAINING single volume intro to philosophy.  Gaarder explains the concepts accurately and with his underlying story of Sophie and her mysterious lessons explains them in a very entertaining way that brings the reader in.  For example, when explaining medieval philosophy, Gaarder uses the metaphor of the clock, stating that Jesus was born at midnight, St. Augustine (b. 354) was born about half past three in the morning and goes on to explain many of the other important events and philosophers of the Middle Ages with the metaphor of the clock as the teaching tool.  Very slick.  Even the heavy hitters like Kant and the Existentialists are covered very fairly and as accurately as one can, given the subject.  I appreciate this since there seem to be two schools of thought on the subject of imparting philosophical knowledge.  One school says only philosophers can understand the most important aspects of the discipline, whereas the othersays anyone can.  I side with the latter school since it seems that so many of the concepts are basic (i.e., fundamental).  Even the most notoriously abstruse philosophers (such as Heidegger) begin with these fundamental questions (\\"Why is there something rather than nothing?\\").  Gaarder conveys this message clearly and effectively.  Anyone from the person with absolutely zero philosophical training to the person with a degree in it can gain from this book.  I know of no other philosophy intro that can truly, legitimately claim this.  For this, as well as for a wonderfully entertaining book, I thank Gaarder.

B001NFNFNU|5.0|When a 9-year old boy goes missing from his home his mother frantically searches for him.  She involves everyone she can think of to help find him.  After five months she get a call from the LAPD that the boy has been found in Iowa and is coming home.  The Chief of Detectives picks her up to take her to the train station with most of the LA Press on hand.  The boy gets off the train and goes to his mother, Mrs.Collins looks at the Cop and says \\"he's not my son\\"; the Cop says that the boy has changed in five months.  Problem is the boy is three inches shorter than her son and he is circumcised.<br /><br />So where is her son and why is the LAPD insisting that she is wrong.  They go so far as to bring in a psychiatrist who states that this is her son and that she's 'hysterical'.  But the boy's Dentist and Teacher both sign statements saying he's not the boy.  So where is her son, and who took him?<br /><br />Clint Eastwood does a masterful job in keeping the suspense up all through the movie, and Angelina Jolie is perfect (never over the top or underplayed).  Like any good movie, the secondary cast are all just what they should be, no one is in the movie except to fit their part.  A masterful job.<br /><br />Zeb Kantrowitz
B000026FOA|5.0|When I got introduced to Nick Drake's music as a mere 12-year old, I was hardly able to recognize all the nuances within his musical register, no more to let his lyrics really sink in on me farther than to acknowledge them as decent work. However, I do encourage even very young listeners to explore Nick Drake; and with that I don't just mean to give him a try, but to truly give him, or yourself, a chance of letting him grow on you. At first the only song of his I listened through was \\"Hazey Jane II\\" on BRYTER LAYTER, understandably as it's jazzier and more energetic than what is truly characteristic for Drake.<br /><br />It was, however, this very album FIVE LEAVES LEFT that, about a year later, made me fall in love with his work. One reason could be that I'd simply turned a year older, but there may also be another explaination which has more to do with the work itself rather than with my own understanding of it. First, while I still listened only sporadically to the lyrics, once \\"Way to Blue\\" waved through the speakers, I was stunned. I lied down and was enthralled into an existence I had never encountered before, to find relievement, comfort and aspects of beauty I can still not explain (no, I didn't smoke anything; I was only listening to the track, and I can't imagine any drug could have captivated me more).<br /><br />Little by little, first from listening and then from finally studying the cd-booklet thoroughly, I also discovered Drake's lyrics, to find that they were, in fact, the main force that held the beautiful musical arrangements alive. The music remains totally stunning, but it is from Nick's words that his universe makes its entrance; they can very well be read and treasured on their own. While certain time-typical references to joint-smoking and being stoned (Mary Jane being one example) makes it clear that this album was, indeed, produced in the late 1960's, these are not quite obvious enough to let them distract the listener from the timeless versatility of their container. Approaching 20 now I may still not be totally \\"ready\\" for Nick Drake, time'll tell me, but it is nevertheless a fact that Nick's words in \\"Day is Done\\" does quite another impact on me now than seven years ago. What meant a lot to me at 13 Nick relieved through his words and music, and even though these things seem irrelevant to me now, no less do these same words provide comfort and relievement concerning things which matter a lot to me now. One of the things that characterizes truly outstanding music to me is when you are drawn to take it with you and use it in various stages of your life, for various reasons, and FIVE LEAVES LEFT remains a prime example on this, as do Drake's other two albums.<br /><br />I am of the convinction that every track on this album contributes into making it one of the most beautiful, thorough and inevitable masterpieces produced in the history of modern music. \\"Man in a Shed\\" has often received harsh response for being astonishingly superficial in its recollection of a poor man in love with a wealthy girl, but even though \\"Time of No Reply,\\" a track neglected by Nick for this release, would have been more in tone with the atmosphere of the album, I regard the lighter \\"Shed\\" as a sensible forerunner to the overwhelming \\"Fruit Tree.\\" We need to breathe loose once in a while, especially when something so emotionally challenging, but no less stimulating, as Nick Drake's music is going on.container.

B000ZELISO|2.0|When I watched the fifth installment in the series, \\"The order of the Phoenix\\", I was blown away. I was darker, grittier, more spectacular and interesting than any other in the series. Actually, if you ask me, I have vivid memories of something spectacular happening in each and everyone of the previous movies. (The Basilisc in part 2, The dementor's in part 3, voldemort's appearances in 4 and 5, and specially the good vs evil wizard's battle in part 5. Do you know what happened in this one? NOTHING. Yup. nothing whatsoever. And even thou the nmovie was not boring, It could have been SO MUCH MORE. But apparently warner decided the series was turning too dark and grittier and they decided to go back to their roots in this one and make it flimsier childish and stupid. The teen angst factor eclipses the magic factor which is something that ruined the movie.  I want to hear more of the backstory, more of the characters. Like Snape. Which is a character that has intrigued me since part 1. I want to hear more of Dumbledore and his relationship with Tom Riddle. Show me more of each wizard and what makes him tick, how did they become who they are today, take me to the depths of Hogwarts and show me the secrets it conceals and give me a glimpse of all the wonderful things those old walls have witnessed in the lat 1000 years. But but do we get to see any of that? Of course not. All those elements are cut from the movie to be replaced by stupid childish crushes and what not.<br /><br />There's an excellent review here an amazon by a user called JR. (Is actually voted the most helpful critical review). What he said in his review is basically every single thing I ranted about in the car with my wife when we were driving back from the theater. Read his review. It's way deeper than mine and he actually read the book. (I didn't). Book which by the way, after reading JR's review I just ordered in order to fill in the gaps of everything warner removed from the movie in order to make it look like Hannah Montana.like Hannah Montana.
B000ZEE3I6|5.0|I just got back from seeing it a few hours ago and it's very good, it's yet another amazing \\"Harry Potter\\" movie! I loved it! Just like the book, this movie focuses on Harry and Dumbledore using Voldemort's memories to try to find his seven Horcruxes in order to destroy them all and defeat him. In order to do this, Dumbledore and Harry hire a new teacher for the Potions class, Horace Slughorn, who has the memory of when Voldemort finds out about Horcruxes and decides to make them, which he doesn't want to give up. Also, Voldemort makes Draco Malfoy try to kill Dumbledore and, at the beginning of the film, the Death Eaters destroy a huge bridge in the Muggle world and eventually attack the Weasleys. Finally, there's a lot of stuff about the relationships/love between the characters, such as Lavender Brown falling in love with, and stalking, Ron, Harry eventually falling in love with, and kissing Ginny, and Ron and Hermione falling in love with each other. Eventually, the events of Dumbledore and Harry looking for and finding some of the Horcruxes leads to Dumbledore being killed by Snape, and a very powerful, emotionally moving ending. The storyline includes almost everything from the book, except, unfortunately, Kreacher and Dobby, Winky, and the other house-elves, and some of the scenes are a little bit less dramatic, such as when Harry has to force Dumbledore to drink the pain-inducing potion so they can get a Horcrux and when Harry battles Snape after Snape killed Dumbledore. The special effects are incredible, just like the other \\"Harry Potter\\" movies, such as when Dumbledore and Harry apparate to the cave where Voldemort's Horcrux is and the computer-animated Inferi. I loved this movie and I'm going to get it on DVD when it comes out! It was another amazing \\"Harry Potter\\" movie and I can't wait to see \\"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Parts One and Two\\" when they come out in 2010 and 2011 and I'm going to get them on DVD too! After you see this movie, you'll be very excited for the last two movies!
B000ZEE3I6|2.0|I don't know why some directors feel the need to change the movie adaption unecessarily.  Also with this movie and the last there was no feeling for Dumbledore, I didn't care that he died or that he had to drink the potion.    Why did they make Snape look like a rock-star with flowing clean hair?  Snapes intentions were too obvious as to what he did at the end.    Did the creators even read the book or just base the movie on a synopsis?
B001V7YWTQ|5.0|I was glad to be able to buy this CD after seeing both Eric and Steve perform at the Verizon Center in DC. This CD was made from the three performances which Clapton and Winwood made in Madison Square Garden prior to the US tour this year  They did not do all of the same songs which they performed at the Verizon Center.  I would have liked to be able to see them perform Double Trouble at the Verizon.  I would have like to have Crossroads and Layla included on the CD which they performed at the Verizon Center.  Some of the highlights included at both the Verizon Center and the CD were Dear Mr. Fantasy which both Eric and Steve both played lead guitar back and forth. It was very inspiring.  Also, Voodoo Chile contained an awesome vocal performance by Steve and a riveting lead electric guitar performance by Eric.  On both the CD and the live performance at the Verizon Center, a lot of Blind Faith songs were played like Had to Cry Tonight, Can't Find My Way Home, Presence of the Lord and Well Alright.  The solo performance by Steve-Georgia on my Mind (an old Ray Charles song)was incredible and the joint performance by Eric and Steve was incredible. I recommend this CD for everyone who loves Eric and Steve's music as well as Blind Faith. I was very happy to see them live and to buy this CD.

B001AVEJ1Y|3.0|I'm not a \\"Star Trek\\" fan; I'm a \\"Star Wars\\" fan, but I liked a few things from the original \\"Star Trek\\": the Talosian aliens, the ones that took Kirk and the other good guys captive and made them go into a breeding program to help their species survive, the Tribbles, the cute, furry, purring fluffballs that multiplied on Captain Kirk's ship, the Enterprise, and Spock, the really nice, Vulcan/human, pointy-eared alien. I saw the trailers for this \\"Star Trek\\" movie and I saw the villain, Captain Nero, the Romulan, weird-looking villain. Nero has pointy ears, is green, wears robe-like clothing, has a bunch of tattoos on his face, carries a spiked staff, and has and is the captain of a dark, black, jellyfish-like ship called the Narada. I think that he is a cool villain and is very weird-looking; he looks more like a combination of Lord Piccolo the Namek from the \\"DragonBall Evolution\\" movie, the Master Vampire, the bat-like vampire villain from \\"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\\", and The Guardian of the Word/Caper from the \\"Angel\\" Season Four \\"Peace Out\\" episode of that vampire show spin-off, than anything else! I think that the diehard fans of \\"Star Trek\\" and anyone who likes Nero, the villain, or any one of the \\"Star Trek\\" characters will like this movie. I like Nero, the villain from the movie, and I might get the DVD when it comes out.
B0001611DI|5.0|SIMPLY PUT...THE MOST AWESOME HORROR ZOMBIE MOVIE EVER MADE.KUDOS TO GEORGE ROMERO.I'VE SEEN THIS MOVE NUMEROUS TIMES AND JUST CANT GET SICK OF IT...WORTH EVERY PENNY!!!
031606792X|1.0|I read Twilight and hated it, but since my friend loaned me the entire series, I decided to be as fair as possible and read the set. Wow. With specific regards to this particular installment, I can't say I was disappointed because my expectations were abominably low, but I was nevertheless surprised. It didn't seem to fit. Whereas Bella was whiny, obsessive, rather stupid, and really quite selfish and mean in the way she treated everyone but Edward (the first 3 installments), she finally developed some redeeming qualities in this book. All she had to do was become a vampire. Unfortunately, these qualities were so utterly out of character that I had a hard time believing any of it. Suddenly the incomprehensible klutz was graceful \\"even for a vampire.\\" Her, um, \\"passions\\" were raging out of control, except the ones that should have been raging out of control (aka blood lust). She had an unusual and never explained sense of control over those passions, which doesn't fit the girl who was put in a catatonic state because her high school obsession of a couple months dumped her; the very same that fainted at a drop of blood and held her \\"splitting sides\\" in when she thought about Edward. She epitomized an obsessive lack of control over the mind, much less her ever-imperiled body. She was able to pick up on and figure out clues much too quickly for someone so dense, and yet other times, she was stupider than ever (\\"what? my immunity from other vampires is a gift? slow down, I don't understand...\\"). I won't linger on the absolute absurdity of Meyer's feigned science (the terrible miscalcuations in Bella's gestation... if 1 day= 2 weeks, she should have delivered by the time she found out she was pregnant; the chromosomal incompatibilities, the fact that love-making itself requires circulation, or the fact that even making sperm is still a cyclic, ongoing process that a vampire stuck in time should not have been able to accomplish). I will say that dragging Dr. Cullen's scientific musings into the story only pulled me further out of the magic and pointed out the ludicrousness of each assertion.  The largest problem with this book is that it was... boring. Nothing really happened. There was never any real fear of Bella not surviving childbirth, especially when there were still hundreds of pages left to go. The fight with the Volturi was tediously built up with such an anti-climatic resolution that I felt I'd waded through hundreds of pointless pages to get to nothing. Somebody (many) should have died, but nobody of consequence did, and I knew while reading that Meyer wouldn't have the stomach to do it, which further reduced any suspense. The way that Bella abused Jacob was abominable, and the clean (?), simple, resolution to that, void of any consequence, felt disingenuous. In short, everything was wrapped up and presented with a bow on top, and it severely hampered the book. There was no real growth in Bella- she went from being pointlessly useless with no other aspirations in life than to have sex with Edward and become a vampire, to miraculously saving the day for everyone. All of this came at absolutely no cost or sacrifice to anyone; everything worked out even better than hoped for. I realize this is a YA novel, and maybe that's what Meyer was going for: young teens will read this and see that you can have your cake and eat it too, and here are some sprinkles for that cake and may I get you a glass of milk? Be irresponsible, sluff off school, let your boyfriend sleep over every night, lie to your parents, do as many stupid things as humanly possible, treat your friends like crap, and not only will everything work out for you, but one day you'll just magically wake up a gorgeous, mature, talented and wise adult with everything you ever hoped for. Truly, this is a fairy tale.
B0000029AL|5.0|The first time I really heard of Aerosmith was in 1987 when they realeased [[ASIN:B00005QEO0 Permanent Vacation]].  From then on, I liked a lot of their stuff, but didn't love it.  I was vaguely aware they had some older stuff from the 70's, but I wasn't interested.<br />I eventually bought [[ASIN:B000068QZI O, Yeah! Ultimate Aerosmith Hits]] and found myself only listening the first disc that had their older (pre-Permanent Vacation) stuff on it.  At the time I thought I pretty much had the best Aerosmith had to offer.<br />Oh, how wrong I was.<br />The [[ASIN:B00138H4FW Aerosmith]] album is incredible.  I didn't know this many good songs could coexist on the same album without ripping a hole in the space-time continuum.  How have I not heard of this album before?  Gritty, raw, and fun to listen to.  If you think you like Aerosmith, even a little, and have never listened to their pre-1987 stuff, get this album.<br />Better yet, get this: [[ASIN:B001BKLL74 3-Pak]].  You'll thank me.<br />You're welcome.
B0027G783W|3.0|\\"Wait For Me\\" isn't going to change anyone's mind about Moby.    If you are a fan then you should like this cd.  The quality of the songs is uniformly good, and while there aren't any songs that jump out at you like \\"Why Does My Heart Feel So Bad?\\" or \\"We Are All Made of Stars\\" there aren't any clunkers either.  \\"Shot In the Back of the Head\\" and \\"Mistake\\" are the two songs that I like best, but there are several other nice songs as well, and nothing that made me want to skip to the next cut.    On the other hand, if you don't like Moby then this cd isn't going to change your mind.  The differences between this cd and his previous releases are (despite claims to the contrary) not that great.    Nice if you like Moby...not so nice if you don't.
B000IOM1YG|5.0|I won't bother repeating what others have said as I'm only going off the original release which I had no idea a remaster existed until I felt it necessary to write about this album because it reminds me of the overplayed Pink Floyd songs to a minor extent, here goes...<br /><br />Pyramid sounds like a knock-off Pink Floyd album, (to a minor extent, I realize how blasphemous this sounds to true APP fans, but bear with me) but since it hasn't been played to death like most Pink Floyd stuff such as \\"The Wall\\" or the prism cover album it still sounds pretty good to me even though I've managed to avoid playing it to death while I've owned it, it still piques my interest to this day.<br /><br />I have nothing against the guys in Pink Floyd as I have the utmost respect for them as individuals as they've been able to avoid the trappings of success that have driven most rock stars into untimely early grave(s).<br /><br />It's not really their fault that American program directors over the many decades since have refused to give Pyramid the same sort of overplay they've given to Pink Floyd.<br /><br /> Hyper-Gamma-Spaces reminds me of an ELP song that I saw around the same time at the Gates Planetarium at a Laserium light show, (Late 70's using a Krypton Laser on the ceiling) with some cool<br />tunes from Camel, ELP, and the obligatory Pink Floyd tracks of course.<br /><br />31 years later, I'd rather listen to the first 8 tracks, track 9 is sort of like accidentally stepping off a cliff<br />edge while trying to avoid boredom, it's a strange juxtaposition for sure, but that's my take, it reminds me of the rocky mountains which I can only see in pictures now, it might be for the best, but I'll probably never know since I've already made my decision on where my life's song will be heard.....
B00275EGTC|4.0|This film has widely been compared to 2001 or to Solaris.  The trailer certainly tries to play up the similarities between it and them.  But if you go into 'Moon' expecting an epic, you are bound to be disappointed.  If you have reasonable expectations, though, you're almost certain to enjoy this well-made, excellently-acted, low-key film.<br /><br />'Moon' is a restrained, mostly quiet character study film.  Don't get me wrong: it has a plot, and things actually happen.  But though it's cleverly plotted and executed, the overarching plot isn't that plausible, and there do seem to be a number of major and minor plot holes.  Thankfully, though, it's easy to appreciate the movie with little regard to the plot.<br /><br />Sam Rockwell is terrific in the lead role as the only inhabitant of the moon base on the far side of the moon from which almost all of humanity's energy is now collected.  The character is written as a smart normal guy, and Rockwell plays him that way - there is no melodrama in the \\"big reveal\\" moments, relatively little time spent gaping open-mouthed, and the character figures weird things out quickly - as you would expect a trained astronaut to do.  (There's nothing more frustrating than a lead character who's supposed to be a highly trained scientist who can't put 1 and 1 together in a reasonable timeframe, much less 2 and 2.)<br /><br />The robot companion GERTY, voiced by Kevin Spacey, is a great contribution to the history of artificial intelligences on screen.  I won't spoil anything, but suffice it to say he's not your average HAL clone at all.<br /><br />Because the character figures things out so quickly, the pace is somewhat offbeat.  I found this highly refreshing, but paid critics seem to be offended by a movie that moves with its own rhythm.  There's no disputing taste, I suppose.<br /><br />In closing, don't go to 'Moon' expecting a mystical, mysterious, ambiguous movie.  Most mystery wears off about a third of the way in, and any questions are resolved two-thirds' through. The ending is final and definitive.  But if you like intelligent, less dramatic sci-fi movies like Gattaca and appreciate a great acting performance, I highly recommend the film.. The ending is final and definitive.

0312370849|3.0|What a wonderful idea for a story--I have never heard of the of the Vel d'Hiv and found it absolustely fascinating.  However, I do feel more could have been done with the Sarah character.    I had a difficult time switching from past to present, especially with the chapters being so short.  I found that Sarah, the 11-year-old \\"past\\" main character, was perhaps a little too mature for her age.  It's very hard for an adult author to get inside an 11-year-old's head, especially one who has experienced the Holocaust.  I also found Sarah's travails to be a bit unbelievable--it seemed that her luck in escaping never ran out.      Julia, the \\"present\\" main character, I felt had great potential, however, with her domineering \\"Frenchman\\" husband, irritable in-laws, and another extraordinarily mature 11-year-old daughter, all created problems for me.  The book especially fizzled when it was no longer in Sarah's voice, almost at the end, and the events that occured then (Julia's absolute resolve to get to France ASAP from the USA, her crumbling marriage, her 180 relationship with her father-in-law) were not at all believable.  The diaglog between Julia and William was not believeable at all; these two hardly knew each other and they spoke to each other like they were old friends.    Also, if you moved into an apartment, would you not notice a horrible smell coming from the walls (spoiler--a dead body) and think it was a drainage problem?  That part was just plain silly.    Anyway, a very good read until about 3/4 of the way through and then, in all honestly, I skimmed it to get it over with.  Like some reviewers, I just don't understand the five stars and high praise.  It is written more like a YA book.  Not bad, but definitely not great, but could have been.

1439138311|4.0|I loved this book. It is beautifully written, and the story is subtle enough to keep readers curious and intrigued. In the end, the main character displays extraordinary depth. The twist in the plot surprises and grabs us. We are left to fantasize about her life after she makes her decision and the story ends.
B00005V331|5.0|This album is to Metal like The Exorcist is to Horror.  I remember hearing about it on tv when I was 8 years old.  Some evangelical program called The Eagle's Nest was tearing it down so bad that it was \\"the most shocking and terrifing record\\" ever.  So naturally I got curious and saved up to buy the cassette.  From then on (summer 1982) Venom has been my favorite band.  I like other music but no one can top Venom, especially this album, Welcome To Hell.  The production is not that good or some people say, but remember it was recorded in 1980 whenever Conrad \\"Cronos\\" Lant could find some free time at work at Impulse Studios as a tape operator.  I think that it sounds just like Metal should - RAW!.  Welcome To Hell should be in every true Metal collection.
0156034026|5.0|Set aside your personal political affiliation and views.  I think more people would like the book if it revolved around some other terrorist act in another part of the world (rather than 9/11), some other conflict than this one that is so fresh on our minds.    The Reluctant Fundamentalist is a good story.  If you focus on the relationships the main character has, the delivery style, and the substory that is happening in the \\"now\\", you will enjoy it.  Hamid presents an interesting study on human behavior/sensibility and the pulls of nationalism and its duties.  At one level, the characters act all the same, but for each their personal histories bubble to the surface and take their lives in wildly different directions.  As others have said, the main character isn't so much reluctant as he is surprised by his own feelings.
B0028K3192|3.0|I'm glad to see that Maxwell did well with his 1st week's sales, but a part of me doesn't feel that it's very well deserved.  I'm a big fan of Maxwell's work, but this album I'm sorry to say is by far his worst.  I'm digging only 3 or 4 of the measly 9, actually 8.5, songs on the album. The production is just way out of line with what I as a fan would expect from Maxwell.  The lyrics are on-point but the over-all sound & vibe is just not there for me. My favorite songs on the album are \\"Bad Habits\\" and then \\"Pretty Wings.\\"  \\"Stop the World\\" and \\"Love You\\" are both nice. \\"Fist Full of Tears\\" is slowly growing on me.     I know that a lot of people asked this question too; \\"What's up with the idea of the 9, I mean 8.5 songs???\\"  Paying for an album with just 8.5 songs on it and only 3 or 4 songs that are really good while the others are just \\"listenable\\" or ones that I could pretty much do without is really not a good look.  If you are going to put out an album with so few songs they better damn-well be nothing less than Grade A!!!  Half of the songs on this album are Grade C+ at best!    I really hope the rest of the Black Summer Night project is much better than this.  Judging by the ratings that some people are giving the album I feel that it is once again that people are choosing to rate the artist and not the actual material on the album.  I don't believe that anyone who has followed Maxwell's work can honestly say that this album is on the level of anything else he's ever done. Keeping that in mind along with the fact that all his other albums well deserved 4 and 5 stars, I wonder how/why would anyone give this album 4 or 5 stars???    Face it folks, every artist is entitled to put out a dud here & there especially when they have a track record of putting out top quality material time & time again. Joe's album \\"Joe Thomas, New Man\\" was his 1st dud IMO.  This, IMO, is Maxwell's 1st and I hope his last dud! Joe bounced back with his latest album \\"Signature\\" and Itruly hope/believe that Maxwell will bring something much better on his next release. I'm still a huge fan, but I really expected waaaaaaay better from Maxwell.
B00284BMBM|5.0|Just received my CD from Amazon in the mail. It is so GREAT. Every song takes you on a ride. WOW    Chris Daughtry has an undeniably incredible voice. It is warm and tender and hot and smoldering all at the same time.    Instantly, I could pick 3-4 huge radio hits.    Yep Daughtry has put together another masterful CD that will be another blockbuster hit.
B00197POXG|5.0|A brilliant megaset! All episodes with additional features, well presented.  What a story, and an insight into early wild west life.   I am from Australia where this set is unavailable. Fantastic value, I would thoroughly recommend to all.  What great stories and that Sully - WOW!
B000JJRIO8|2.0|I've finally braved listening to this album, after putting it off for a few years... and yes it is as bad as I expected.    I listened to the first 2 tracks then have quickly shuffled through the rest. Obviously the only exception is 'Soon as I Get Home'. Always loved that tune since it was first leaked in the 90s. At least now there's a high spec version of it, and believe me that is the only reason I rate this 2 star. That track is 5 star and the rest are 1 for me.    I never bother writing reviews, just normally read all of yours, but I just felt myself getting angrier and angrier listening to this travesty. I've read through the majority of the reviews already on here & agree with most of what has been said on all of the 1-3 star reviews.    I'm 27, from the UK and grew up with Pac as my hero and inspiration / father figure, even did my degree dissertation on him, his music and the Black Power movement... but I've been so disheartened with what has been put out in his name over most of the posthumous years, that I heardly even listen to the man anymore. Anyway after the fourth listen to the QDIII joint that's got me in the mood to dig out all of the untouched bootlegs and enjoy them for what they are. Even those that would never have gotten close to an album are x10 better than the 'music' on here.    Anyone remember the ideas on 'the Vault' box set of everything untouched years ago? If that ever happened I guarantee it would go multi-platinum without much marketing, as long as the fans knew they were finally getting what they wanted!    I don't want to speak badly of Afeni, maybe she's had some terrible advice for her work on these releases. Whatever the reason it certainly doesn't justify this mess of a project...     I could write another dissertation on this so I better stop now.    Do not buy this, but don't miss out on 'Soon as I get Home' if you ain't already got it.
B001GCUO1Q|2.0|Wow..I had such high hopes for this film. But it fell flat. Now I'm not a big comic book reader but even I know the wolverine story..AND HE DOESN'T LOSE HIS MEMORY FROM ADAMANTIUM BULLETS. The film wasn't too bad until the end. It wasn't spectacular or anything, but it wasn't horrible. I can overlook the shafting of sub-characters. But when you COMPLETELY re-write a main character, or a main villain...that's when it becomes ridiculous.<br /><br />As previously mentioned...why they chose to erase Wolverine's memory by shooting him in the head with adamantium bullets...yeah I don't know. Why they chose to have dead pool not have a mouth...don't know. Why they chose to have wolverine have bone claws?!? ...yeah your guess is as good as mine. Heck you may as well have Cable and Apocalypse come back from the future and tag team with wolverine to take out Spiderman, Hercules, and Buzz Lightyear. I understand that certain things must change when adapting something from comics to film. I didn't even mind XMEN 3 when they completely re-wrote the phoenix story. That was because it needed to happen to make it filmable. Bone claws, a mouthless deadpool, and adamantium bullets were NOT needed. I can deal when they have to change things like have agent zero basically fly into a helicopter, or re-write the whole wolverine love affair thing...but when they add crap just to add crap...no..i'm sorry.<br /><br />I've heard there is supposed to be a dead pool movie coming out...how are they going to manage that one? They are going to have to butcher the already butchered character to make something believable. I don't even want to think about it.<br /><br />The only reason this movie didn't get one star is because I didn't walk out.
B000X5SPBI|4.0|I was not a fan of SUPERNATURAL after its first season, and indeed I'm not a huge fan even after Seasons Two and Three.  But there is no question that that show made some major strides forward in its sophomore and junior years, deepening the storylines and finding new and innovative ways to structure episodes.  Because one of the biggest problems with the show in Season One was its episodic \\"demon of the week\\" narrative structure, the show grew far more interesting and engaging.<br /><br />In these two seasons SUPERNATURAL also became a far more playful show, willing to engage in self-parody and capable of poking fun at itself.  In a way, this mimics the way that one of the shows that has most influenced the series, THE X-FILES, grew.  That show for the first couple of episodes was almost unceasingly serious.  It was a great show despite this, but it really took off once -- especially with several extraordinary scripts by Darin Morgan -- when it began mixing in comic episodes.  Season Two of THE X-FILES saw a mildly comic (though mainly jut flat out weird) scripted by Morgan, late in Season Two about circus freaks entitled \\"Humbug.\\"  But the first out and out laugh fest was another Morgan script, \\"War of the Coprophages,\\" in which Mulder and a scientist named Bambi do battle against cockroaches.  (Darin Morgan only wrote a half dozen scripts for THE X-FILES, but four of those would be among the ten best X-FILES episodes ever, one of them the Emmy Award winning episode \\"Clyde Bruckman's Final Repose,\\" which is one of the finest TV episodes of all time, garnering an Emmy not just for Morgan but for guest actor Peter Boyle.)  Certainly THE X-FILES seemed to be an even greater influence on SUPERNATURAL in these two seasons than in Season One.  One Season Two episode, in which Sam and Dean give offer Bobby differing accounts of events calls to mind THE X-FILES episode \\"Bad Blood,\\" in which Mulder and Scully give contradictory reports of events surrounding vampires in Texas (along with a sheriff played by Luke Wilson -- both episodes were among the dozens of TV episodes or movies loosely based over the years on the great Kurosawa film RASHOMON, which details four incompatible accounts of events in the woods in medieval Japan).  I don't know how much of this can be credited to Ben Edlund (creator of THE TICK in all his forms, as well as a writer on FIREFLY and ANGEL) joining the writing staff.  But in every way the writing in these two seasons showed a sharp increase in sophistication and flexibility.  The scripts in Season One were stiff, uninteresting, and frequently just flat out boring.  That was rarely the case as the show progressed.  No doubt part of the improvement stemmed from the producers gaining new concessions from the CW, which surely allowed them to stray away from the standalone, episodic format that so thoroughly hampered the show in Season One.<br /><br />I frankly found just about every episode in Season One of the show to be completely forgettable.  But several episodes in Seasons Two and Three stand out.  For instance, one particularly good episode in Season Two does some great twists on the genie legends, with the help of an excellent guest performance by BATTLESTAR GALACTICA's Tricia Helfer.  That episode is emblematic of the new maturity of the show.  I can honestly say that I was not surprised (nor scared) by a single thing that happened in Season One.  It was almost intentionally predictable.  But in Helfer's episode there were some truly interesting twists and surprises.  In just about every way, the show got better in these two seasons.<br /><br />I'm still not what one might term a major fan of the show.  Even after three seasons it is a fairly conservative show.  It certainly has done little to redefine the horror genre and it has not expanded the scope of horror or fantasy in the way that either THE X-FILES or BUFFY did.  Still, there is a great deal to say for a show that is excellent even if it is notinnovative.  And I admire any series that gets better as it goes along.  I received the first three seasons of the series as a gift, but I frankly did not think I was going to continue with the show after finishing the three sets.  But now I both plan to buy Season Four come this September and DVR the show upon its return this fall (it will be going against a very similar show with what is surely a pretty substantial audience overlap, FRINGE -- why do networks do this? -- the only then that FOX assures in doing this is that both shows will get lower ratings than they might otherwise -- still, FRINGE is a show I really love, so I'll keep up with SUPERNATURAL via DVR).  Hopefully I'll enjoy Season Four as much as Seasons Two and Three.mire any series that gets better as it goes along.

B000ZEE3I6|3.0|On a scale of one to five, I only give \\"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince\\" three stars...and that's being incredbly generous.<br /><br />I really, really, REALLY wanted to like this film, and there are moments of the movie that are absolutely fantastic. The problem is that all those scenes start off great, and then fizzle out into nothing spectacular. This film also cuts and changes a lot of info from the book, and changes certain things from the novel that had no business being changed. I just don't understand it.<br /><br />Without giving too much away, here are some of the things that irked me about this movie (if you haven't read the book, though, beware that there are spoilers ahead):<br /><br /> - The first 20 minutes or so of the film are AWFUL. They are nothing like the opening chapters of the book, which is a huge disappointment. Dumbledore especially bothers me at the beginning of the movie. His dialogue is ridiculous, and the significance of his withered hand are glossed over in an offhand remark to Harry. (Also, that hand looks nothing like it should. In the movie, Dumbledore's hand looks like its owner has merely been outside gardening for a couple of hours. In the book, the hand is supposed to be a black, charred, disgusting mess. Why cut corners on the big screen?)<br /><br />- Also in regards to the first few minutes of the book, I was disappointed that the Snape/Narcissa/Bellatrix scene was pushed back until later in the film, and was exceptionally brief. It could have been much better.<br /><br />- Too much of the movie was devoted to silly romance. Don't get me wrong: The Ron/Hermione/Lavender triangle was a big part of Book Six, and the actress playing Lavender in the film was absolutely hysterical. However, too much time was devoted to teenage romance instead of other important plot elements that were completely cut out  of the film altogether.<br /><br />- Speaking of silly romance, the Harry/Ginny relationship was really shafted in the movie. It started off well, but never really climaxed at all. At the end of the book, Harry and Ginny are officially an item, and there's a very poignant moment where Harry tells Ginny why they can't be together because he'll inadvertently put her in danger and because he needs to fulfill his destiny, etc. That scene was completely omitted from the movie, and in the film, you really don't know if Harry and Ginny are really together or not. It's ridiculous!<br /><br />- Fenrir Greyback's character in the movie was a MASSIVE disappointment. He appeared in the film, but no one even really knew that he was a werewolf, because the whole scene where he attacks Bill Weasley was omitted from the film! Why include the character at all if they were going to cut that scene? It makes absolutely no sense!<br /><br />- Too much time was devoted to Draco Malfoy practicing for his \\"grand event.\\" Tom Felton did a great job portraying Draco in this film, but seriously, did the filmmakers really need to include four or five separate scenes of Draco practicing using the vanishing cabinet? I don't think so.<br /><br />- For me, the last 25 minutes or so of the film were the biggest disappointment of all. The worst part about it is that certain aspects of these scenes were amazing: the visual setting when Dumbledore and Harry arrive at the mouth of the cave, the dialogue between Snape and Dumbledore at the tower, etc. Unfortunately, though, the scenes that started off great ended up sucking. For example, the \\"evil souls\\" living in the lake were total rip-offs of Gollum from \\"The Lord of the Rings,\\" and didn't look anything like I imagined that they should. Also, I hated the death scene at the end, which was poorly done and happened way too quickly. The Snape/Harry confrontation at the end of the film also seemed incredibly lackluster. I really wanted Harry to scream at Snape and go nuts on him, but instead Daniel Radcliffe just kind of muttered, \\"Coward,\\" and that was it.<br /><br />- Theending of the film was TERRIBLE! After the death, only about 30 people were gathered around the body, and no one was freaking out the way they do in the book. HELLO! One of the most important characters in the series is dead! Doesn't anyone care? All they do is hold their wands up in the air for a few seconds in some sort of pathetic salute. It's awful! It was so subdued. And where was the funeral?! In the book, people travel from all over the world to attend the service, and the coffin goes up in white flames, which would have been a great way to end the movie. Instead, the audience was left with a boring shot of the back of Harry, Ron, and Hermione's heads. It was awful!<br /><br />I really expected more from this film. Again, I will concede that there were some decent moments, but I think the script and the overall direction were severely lacking. I really hope they don't screw up the final two films in the series. Warner Brothers Execs, if you are reading this, I hereby volunteer to adapt the screenplay for \\"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows,\\" and to direct both movies for free just to make sure they are done right!ered around the body, and no one was freaking out the way they do in the book.

B0028K3192|5.0|Maxwell's 1st release since his hiatus is a work of art.  He has grown so much as an artist and it is really displayed in his selection of music presented on this album.  I've read complaints about the cd only being 9 songs.  My response to that is I'd rather have a cd with 9 out of 9 tracks jamming than to have a cd with 5 out of 15 tracks jamming.  Come on people, how many times have you picked up a cd and there were 15 tracks of which 2 were intros and outros...several interludes and then a few duds. So when you add it all up Maxwell has delivered 9 quality tracks and that's enough to keep me holding on until the next installment of this trilogy.    My favorites are Bad Habit, Cold, Pretty Wings, and Fistful of Tears.  I like the other tracks as well but these 4 are standouts for me.  I am not disappointed in Maxwell in the least bit and advise anyone to go out and get your copy.  His cd is so funky and soulful.  He makes you feel like you're listening to your parents' old albums with the record player and the quarter on the needle to keep it from scratching.  Maxwell has truly delivered on this one.

B0015HOFZI|1.0|I bought the sony ps-lx300usb turntable thinking I could record my album collection. I was wrong. The software is very confuseing and does not see all the tracks clearly. I have tried everything on the help window but there is no fix for this problem so far. The good thing is the turntable is very easy to work with, the start stop buttons and the cueing button work good. The bad thing about the turntable, at a louder volume has a bad hum. I can't live with that. To bad I waited so long. I am stuck with it now. If anyone has better luck with this table, please write a review and explain some of the problems that I have experienced and their solutions.
B000J10EQU|2.0|Giving you a brief rundown of where I stand, I thought the 1st \\"Superman\\" was ok. I actually enjoyed Part 2 better; part 3 was my favorite; and even though part 4 got a lot of harsh criticism, I didn't think it was so bad. I kind of liked it.<br /><br />Onto the subject at hand. I understand that this movie was an uphill battle at best and a doomed failure at worst. I understand that most people already had the irrevocable image of Christopher Reeve as Superman. But this already difficult battle was not handled well.<br /><br />For one thing, this movie tries to be consistent with Part 1 and 2. (It shows images of Marlon Brando from Part 1, and having Lex Luthor know about Superman's base from Part 2.) BUT, this movie seems to forget that the death of Superman's 'earth' mother was mentioned in Part 3, and that Superman made arrangements to sell the family farm in Part 4.<br /><br />The main problem here is that the movie does NOT remain consistent with the 1st 4; NOR DOES IT MAKE A CLEAN BREAK AND START FRESH. (Making a clean break and starting fresh was probably the best bet for this difficult uphill battle.)<br /><br />Moving on, it almost gets annoying when it at least seems that Rooth is imitating Christopher Reeve. He may have been better off just bringing his own style to the role. Something like this happened recently.<br /><br />After 2 Harry Potter movies, Richard Harris (who did Dumbledore) died. He was beloved in this final role. Now when Sir Michael Gambon took the role from part 3, he was smart enough not to imitate Richard Harris. He knew this was a difficult spot. So he just did Dumbledore with his own style. (Probably Sir Michael Gambon's smartest move under the circumstances.)<br /><br />Well, back to Superman. His jealousy over Lois Lane having moved on with her life seems a bit unfair. (He did after all leave for some years.) Lois Lane did the healthy thing. She moved on with her life. (She also has a son now.)<br /><br />What saves this movie from being a complete and utter disaster is Kevin Spacey as Lex Luthor. He has gotten out of jail and now has the family fortune to start new with. He is very bad. But like many of Charles Dickens's villains, he carries a charm that makes him likable in a way. His big plan is to use Kryptonic elements to create a new world, and take over.<br /><br />There is an interesting climactic moment where Lex Luthor leads Superman into a trap, and it's hard not to enjoy seeing Lex Luthor finally get his chance to punch out Superman.<br /><br />Another character worth mentioning is Frank Langella as Mr. White. In his minor (but still significant) role, he adds a bit of charm. Lois is starting to feel bad about her book: \\"Why the World Does Not Need Superman.\\" And with some charm, Frank Langella says: \\"Don't worry Lois. People won't remember what you got the Pulitzer Prize for. They will just remember that you got it.\\"<br /><br />Believe me, I TRIED to be open to this film. I TRIED to give it a fair chance. I TRIED to understand that Brandon Routh had a very difficult if not impossible task. But it just didn't work. I give the movie 1 star for Kevin Spacey as Lex Luthor, and 1 star for Frank Langella. Another annoying element is that if the movie takes place some years after Part 2, why do the characters look younger than they did in Part 2?<br /><br />SUMMED UP: They had a choice. They could have either remained consistent with the 4 Christopher Reeve movies, or they could have made a clean break and started fresh. AND THE PROBLEM IS THAT THEY DID NEITHER.<br /><br />Being perfectly honest, if you have not seen the 4 Christopher Reeve movies, you may be more able to accept this and enjoy it on its own. But it really doesn't fit with the Christopher Reeve movies.in Spacey as Lex Luthor. He has gotten out of jail and now has the family fortune to start new with. He is very bad.

015603283X|5.0|In The Dumas Club Reverte is at his best and scariest. We start to learn some interesting things about renaissance bookbinding and repair. We get to chase and be chased. And that was one weird lady in the wheelchair. What are the bad guys are really after? Is the devil really running around? Does the book really work? Who is this dangerous dame he hooks up with? Is Corso going to survive? Is he a crook? Is he a good guy? Is he a bad guy? Why are all these people on fire? Who is always one step ahead of him? And how did The Three Musketeers get in involved in all this? Can they help Corso? Is some kind of a Pare Dumas farce? Reverte weaves labyrinth trails with red herrings dangling juicily in front of us, killing people before they can talk, before hitting us with the ending. Wonderfully translated by Sonia Soto.

The setting is so appealing to me, since I was about the same age as a Miranda in 1978 and grew up on Long Island, right outside of NYC.  The characters were so well drawn and perfectly believable--their pain is palpable, and their joy made me joyful too.  I loved this novel and of course, my 12 year old daughter is reading it next!

0634023020|5.0|Miles Davis is smiling because these arrangements are just that good.I can't praise this book enough but I will try.How many time had you seen jazz chord melody arrangement that other than put a chord under the melody notes just doesn't convey the feeling of jazz.Jamie's arrangements capture the spirit of Miles Davis music.They are not stiff they flow they breath with the improvisational glory that a Miles Davis performance delivers. I was real skeptical about this product at first,having been disappointed so many time before by books that claim to be jazz.Mel Bay's Jazz Chord Melody not a bad book top-notch artists were involved in the production of those arrangements.But they're heavy handed and with no improvising feeling.I'm not telling anyone not to buy that book but what I am saying to my jazz guitar brothers this is the chord melody book you always dreamed that they would publish. I'm practicing measure by measure because yeh these are definitely not for the faint of heart but the rewards are great. Buy the book you won't be disappointed and the CD is great to listen to.
0385340575|3.0|Gone Tomorrow still isn't up to par with the first 11 Jack Reacher novels but better than Nothing to Lose (an apt title for a substandard novel from this talented writer). It seems that the author has indeed read the reviews and comments posted for Nothing to Lose and kept out political views-good choice for Gone Tomorrow. Gone tomorrow still comes across as a \\"formula\\" book with a tired and aged Jack Reacher stretching to keep up the pace with the \\"bad guys\\". I would really like to give it 2 1/2 stars but couldn't so give benefit of doubt and rated at 3.  Savanna
B0010X73ZG|5.0|I've held off on a true review of this movie ever since I originally saw it in theaters, my reason being that I didn't know what to think. I guess some people would say I was dazed, I was between saying the movie sucked and saying it was great, now I can say this movie is fantastic because:  1. Character development in the movie is briantlly done, in most movies character development is put to the side and is most of the time is just the main character saying what happened to them and que emotional music. Here the movie's main character David Drayton(Thomas Jane) is a family man/artist, who in a bad stream of luck has a couple of trees crush part of his property and goes into town with his not so nice lawyer neighbor Brent Norton(Andre Braugher) and couple of minutes later \\"the mist\\" rolls into the supermarket and thus a downward spiral of horrific events both by the hands of the people themselves and the tooth and nail of the creatures in the film.   2. This film is by far in my truest opinion the most realistic human diasaster/apocolypse film ever. People will fight each other when they need each other the most, a person like mrs. carmody is inevitable to appear in a situation, whether they be christian, jewish, or muslim. However I think they point to her being jewish because in the film she says \\"there is only one god and that is the god of the israelites.\\" I don't know or it could mean she is just a old testament nutbag.  3. As I pointed to the realism, its proven throughout history in these situations people can be easily influenced by outside forces, whether they are good or bad, and anyone who still has their head attatched and dosen't agree will most ikely be killed. Or maybe their leader will select a person and say they are responsible just to make his/her followers feel better.  4. Also proven throughout history is that when people believe the end is coming they'll committ suicide, apoctoliptic cults drinking the \\"kool-aid\\".  Know I must comment on somecomplaints I read about this film because some are not that well thought out.  1. Special effects in the film are good for the most part, however some of the sequences with the creatures looked as if they weren't finished. Especially the scene with those bird like creatures attacking the isects and killing some of the people in the store. However to counter this the animations of the spiders look insane, easily the best giant sized spider design in any movie.    SPOILER: IF YOU WISH TO SEE THIS MOVIE DO NOT READ ANY MORE!!!!!    2.  The ending has been met with confrontation by people who saw the film and those who read the book. I say the ending in the book is good however it has no clear ending to it, they just drive off into the mist and your suppose to hope for the best. Now in the movie its clear what happens, David Drayton his son and company to save them from a horrifying death and he would let the creatures kill him but to what I call the worst bad luck any guy can get and the sound he and his company believed was the creatures turns out to be a military convoy plowing through picking up any survivors they can, now this is what made me confused. I now say that this is better than the book because it has a clear and somewhat hopeful because you know that in the end humanity wins, but unfortunately Mr. Drayton loses.

B00284BMBM|5.0|This is a very good second album by Chris. He is a talented vocalist and musician. My favorite track is \\"Call Your Name\\". Chris plays acoustic guitar on the first half of the song, and then he switches to electric very nicely.  This is a great song.  \\"Every Time You Turn Around\\" is a high energy song with a good beat. I like the song \\"You Don't Belong\\". This is a good rock song.  \\"September\\" is a song about remembering an old romance. \\"Tennessee Line\\" is a beautiful track.  I love the violin playing and the sentiment on this song. \\"No Surprise\\" is an excellent song about two people breaking up.  \\"Open Your Eyes\\" is a song about beginning a new start in life.  This song is very moving. \\"Learn My Lesson\\" is a song about learning life's lessons the hard way.  This song has a lot of meaning to me.  I enjoy this album very much.
0061767581|1.0|I read only the first few pages using the \\"look inside\\" pop up and I do believe Lauren Conrad actually wrote this herself.  I teach writing to 4th graders and she's committed every writing sin I teach my students not to do.  Overly-used adjectives?  Check.  Dream scene fake out?  Check.  Juvenile dialogue.  Check.  Come to think of it, my 4th graders are better writers.
B000ZEE3I6|5.0|I loved this movie. It is by far the best of the series.     Anyone who has written a review or will write a review bashing this movie because it isn't just like the book, need to take a step back. If you don't go to these movies expecting big changes, then you, my friend are a complete idiot.   Think of them as two entirely different entities, because they are. If they tried to copy all of the brilliant novel into the movie, it would be a complete mess. Books are beautiful and can take the time to develop smaller story threads and secondary characters, but movies don't have that luxury. They have to be more focused on main characters and the main plot line.   For example, one reviewer was barking mad because the Dumbledore withered hand story thread was, as he put it, \\"glossed over\\". No offense, but it is pretty glossed over in the book as well. It is mentioned more, but you don't really find out the whole story about it until the seventh book anyway, so why waste screen time on it.     I love the books. They are the most outstanding read on my book shelf, and I continue to pour through them over and over. The books are better than the movies, but then again, when isn't that true???? The books are always better than the movies!!!!! That doesn't mean that the movies can't be enjoyed and loved for what they are.   I for one, admire what the screen writers do. I would hate to try and condense JK's brilliant novels into workable screen scripts.     In short, don't be a moron. Love the books and then go see the movies and love them too!!! You can love both. Just remember they aren't going to be the same!!! If you don't, you are robbing yourself of the pleasure of enjoying some great cinema, BASED ON a bloody brilliant set of books.
6302130379|3.0|The movie is excellent with top actors giving great performances and the story is beautiful and compelling.  The only negative is that the original 1998 vcr tape is not the best quality.
B000ZEE3I6|4.0|Overall, I really enjoyed this movie. As it compares to the other films, it was better than some but not the best. B+  Mainly because I think the changes they made to the climax weren't as good as the original material.<br /><br />Unlike some fans of the books, I don't automatically think \\"sacrilege!\\" when material is cut from the book to make the film. Mostly I agree. I think the storyline with Hagrid and his giant brother from Phoenix was fluff in the book and so not needed in the film. Occasionally I disagree. I wasn't too thrilled that they cut Hermione's clever besting of Rita Skeeter in Goblet, but could see why the filmmakers did so - that would have added more time to an already long movie. Film is a different medium for story-telling and I enjoy it on its own merits. But, the cuts/changes they made to \\"Half-Blood Prince\\" just didn't seem necessary to me.<br /><br />I'm not talking about the majority of the film (or the fact that the title BARELY got an explanation). My criticism stems from the climactic death scene at the end. STOP HERE IF YOU DON'T ALREADY KNOW WHO DIED! In the book, Dumbledore and Harry return from their mission to find the school under attack from Death Eaters. Dumbledore's Army is holding them off, with some help from a luck potion, until the Order of the Phoenix can arrive to back them up. This was completely cut. We don't get to see the kids in action, which was a big disappointment and made the arrival of the Death Eaters an after-thought. I didn't feel any particular menace or surprise that they were in the school. Then, on top of the tower, Dumbledore has Harry hide under his invisibility cloak and then paralyzes him there. Not so in the film. Harry hides underneath the stairs and \\"valiantly\\" manages to restrain himself from coming to Dumbledore's aid (which doesn't jive with his character). Then, Dumbledore confronts Draco AND the Death Eaters. They weren't in this scene! I love Bellatrix's character, but it seemed they changed the scene just so she could be in it. It didn't work. Rowling's original set-up was superior. Had they kept it, this would easily have been the best HP film.<br /><br />Despite this, I did enjoy the movie a lot. Prince, as the penultimate novel, was really more of staging point/set-up for the finale, so it didn't have as much action as the other books, or films. It did have a lot of character development though. The film provoked much more laughter than any other HP film, and still captured the spirit of the book very well. I cried when he died, so I obviously felt connected to the characters, as intended.  This movie was quite good, and I will buy it on DVD so I can watch it again, but it also could have been that much better.she could be in it. It didn't work. Rowling's original set-up was superior.

B0009P66TK|5.0|I'm big,and I'm left-handed,and this watch is perfect for me.It fairly yells \\"I am a man!\\" Before I bought this watch,I was a bit hesitant because of the leather band.Every other watch I have owned has had bands that were too short and too stiff,as well as being difficult to release the pins (to me,the bands are installed backwards).On this watch,Invicta seemed to realise that big men would be wearing it and up-sized the band accordingly.They made the band of top quality materials with a nicely polished embossed buckle and strap keeper.Very attractive!Now,the next item was just great.The strap pins are furnished with little levers that allow you to remove them without the use of any tools,just a finger-tip.Well,I thought it was pretty neat.The watch itself is quality,beautifully finished and attractive - manly,if you will.If I wouldn't look funny wearing two,I would!
B00065MDRW|5.0|I could not believe it that it is the first album of King Crimson. That time Prog rock was in its formation state and this album made the path. out of 5 songs 3 are my all time favourite. 21st century, epitaph and  in the court of. In my point of view the Prg rock went to its max height with Thick As a Brick by Jethro Tull,  but if there were no 'In the court of crimson king' it could have been too tough to reach that height.  Listen to it. You will love it.

B00110K62U|5.0|When Victor Hugo wrote Les Miserables [The Wretched, The Poor ones, The Victims] little did he realize he was writing a timeless work, translated into every language, made into movies and a theatre production that has played with a consistently sold out audience.    Victor Hugo, born on February 26th, 1802, died on May 22nd, 1885, lived for 83 years; for the most part, dedicated to writing poetry, novels and essays. Among many of his works, Les contemplations [contemplations] and The Hunchback of Notre Dame are well known and have also been made into movies. Victor Hugo's childhood was lived through tumultuous events; the overthrow of the Bourbon Dynasty in the French Revolution, the rise and fall of the First Republic and the rise of the First French Empire and dictatorship under Napoleon Bonaparte.    Victor Hugo conceived the idea of writing a novel about social injustice but it took him over 17 years to complete Les Miserables; a 1200 page book about the struggle of an ex-convict Jean Valjean as he attempts to redeem the sins of the past. The book is magnificent for it transcends time, making generations of readers identify with the characters and their plea. The play brings to life the social injustice lived by many in France and the songs are written with such depth of understanding of human behavior that as we sit to listen and watch this musical, we can not help it but be captivated by the performance.     At first, we thought we were getting the whole play, only to realize that we had all the songs in the sequence of the play and a finale that is breathtaking, for they bring those that interpret Jean Valjean's from all over the world and they unite to sing, each in their native language the famous closing song that calls for a crying rally as it asks \\"do you hear the people sing lost in the valley of the night? It is the music of the people who are climbing to the light. For the wretched of the earth, there is a fame that never dies even the darkest night will end and the sun will rise. They will live again freedom in the garden of the Lord, they will walk behind the ploughshare; they will put away the sword, the chain will be broken and all men will have their reward. Will you join in our crusade? Who will be strong and stand with me? Somewhere beyond the barricade, is there a world you long to see? Do you hear the people sing? Say, do you hear the distant drums? Is it the future that they bring when tomorrow comes!\\"    The cast is the original London Company: Colm Wilkinson as Valjean, Michael Ball as Marius, Philip Quast as Javert, Judy Kuhn as Cosette and Ruthie Henshall as Fantine.    Depending on the mood of the day, these songs can make you cry, like \\"I dreamed a dream\\" and \\"Empty Chairs at empty tables.\\" We recently had a death in the family and these words simply overwhelmed us when we heard: \\"there is a grief that can't be spoken, there is a pain goes on and on, empty chairs at empty tables, now my friends are dead and gone.\\"     Therefore, if you enjoy this timeless classic, this DVD is for you. Our favorite feature is the lyrics can be played as subtitles that allowed us to sing along. Superb, don't miss it!
B000001FN3|4.0|OK, it's a masterpiece of prog aural bliss. BUT one thing I cannot forgive. The Prelude on the suite \\"Fall of House of Usher\\" is literally from an unfinished piece by Claude Debussy, \\"La chute de maison Usher\\". The fact that this is not acknowledged in the album information (or is it on the Deluxe edition?) is something of a scandal, I believe. Do messrs Parsons/Woolfsons/Powell want us to suppose they could ever write such music on their own? Opinions on this please!
B001FB4W0W|5.0|First off let me make it clear that I have read all of Charlaine Harris Books [[ASIN:0441017770 Sookie Stackhouse, Books 1-7]] and love them all (well the last one was iffy, but I forgive her) This review is on ALAN BALLS  HBO series True Blood BASED on Charlaine Harris's southern vampire series and I will not confuse the two, and neither should anyone else who is reviewing this.<br /><br />Trueblood, is ..ehem...Truely what I have been waiting for since my other beloved HBO Series were cancelled or ended. [[ASIN:B001FA1OTU Deadwood: The Complete Series]] [[ASIN:B000Q66PXE Rome - The Complete First Two Seasons]] [[ASIN:B000HEVZBW Six Feet Under - The Complete Series Gift Set]]. Nobody does drama like HBO and nobody can bring those dramas to the small screen like Alan Ball. He knows with uncanny ability how to Cast these shows, you can see no one else inhabiting these characters like the ones he has chosen. Alan also gives us visually the most striking of locations and set designs, he brings them from page to screen and breathes into them life eternal.<br /><br />Trueblood is different than your run of the mill girl meets boy, boy is a vampire, girl falls anyway, chaos ensues. The formula is there but its weaved and curled like a Kudzu vine around a unique and original and spectacular storyline that would make Dracula stake himself with envy. Vampires are now \\"out\\" in society, no longer hiding under the earth. They want to be citizens again and promise to behave themselves and the Japanese have made that possible with the invention of Trueblood, the synthetic blood in a bottle complete with blood types for the picky fanged ones.<br /><br />Sookie Stackhouse is alone in this world but for her very promiscuous brother Jason and her remarkably open minded grandmother. She is alone also because of her ability to read minds and when Vampire Bill walks into her place of work, he is refreshingly blank paged and instantly she wants to still get into his brain. A whole world opens up to her both sexually and mentally, and her little town of Bon Temps is about to get bigger with  murder ,mystery and more of the supernatural. A persons gift can also be their burden and in this show its true with every character. What other series can explore what its really like to be a vampire? without it being tainted by black capes and angst and stereotypes?<br /><br />Sam the bartender, Lafayette the cook, Tara; Sookies best friend, Eric the vamp club owner, and all the citizens of Sookies small town are woven together, seeking out revenge, redemption, passion, wealth, and answers. What I love about this series is that its not all about Sookie, she is the main character but what would her life be without all of her neighbors and family and friends living thier lives parallel to hers?

B000WS4QJG|5.0|I never realized how good this guy's music was until he died and I listened to his double disc essential collection fully for the first time. I'd heard all the hits before, \\"Billie Jean,\\" \\"The Way You Make Me Feel,\\" \\"Thriller,\\" etc. However, I felt that I should obtain the record that made it all happen....Thriller, despite having almost the whole CD on my computer already from the essential collection. No matter. The DVD alone is almost worth the price of admission. It'll be great to be able to pop that in down the road and show my kids what great music was like.    The extra songs are cool, great of him to record with some of the biggest stars of the day. Sound quality is exceptional...best i've heard of these songs.    Get the best selling album of all time. Every song is a classic. Will not be disappointed.
B0028K3192|4.0|He has definately evolved and the songs that are good, are like classic Maxwell on steroids. You will love them. My favorites personally are 'Bad Habits', 'Stop the World', and of course 'Pretty Wings'. But unlike his first album that I could listen to from beginning to end, I couldn't do that with this one. The flow of the songs on the album itself was off to me, so I had to rearrange them on my own playlist. I definately appreciate the live instumentation, but a song like Phoenix Sunrise (which actually has no lyrics) can be better appreciated if you were actually listening to it live in concert. My least favorite is Help Somebody. I like the message, but it just seemed a little \\"loud\\" and didn't match the overall feel of the album, for me anyway. Overall though, I'm not disappointed, and it was worth the wait. I think a lot of people were waiting for this cause real RnB is much needed today. Guess thats why it debut at number 1. Still love you Maxwell, but I miss the hair. :)
B001V9LRTM|4.0|The video quality is average the music good, the new additions add value to this DVD. The package is very nice presented with careful details, if you want to change your old VHS video this is a very good option
B0000648WZ|5.0|While everyone was attacking the poor director for this outrageous movie(supposedly because it had in thier own view a nazi fantasy) I did find it plastic and entertaining and with the special commentaries called      \\" Death from above \\" I understand the idea and appeal for this movie.
1591391105|3.0|I found 'The First 90 Days' to be way too much of a textbook-like book for me. It was a slog of a read and really directed at those already in a high position of corporate leadership. I was expecting more practical ideas for the low to mid-level manager and found it had little to offer. This book assumes you already are in a position of great power within a corporate environment and in that context, maybe it's useful. But for the majority of us who aren't at that point on the ladder - it offers little.
B00095MLGC|5.0|Porqupine Tree is exactly what is supposed to happen to a genre of music when the pioneers die, burn out, or sell out. They have taken progressive rock in the direction it should have gone. PT, Spocks Beard, Marillion, Opeth, etc. have awakened the Prog movement. Speaking as a child of the late 60's & early 70's , I listened to the pioneers. Yes, Floyd, ELP, Genesis and the rest don't produce any new music. If they did I doubt I would buy it because they either faded away or sold out to play sadly piss-poor pop music.
B001PPGAIA|2.0|Considering many important aspects of events in Australia during WWII, I was very disappointed with this film.  The first third of the film is either comedy or parody of the British aristocracy and roughness of Australian outback population.  I was unable to determine which.  Second third of a movie takes a little more serious approach addressing the issue of treatment of bi-racial children and creation of a special class of mixed race population with their role in society clearly defined by the racist notion of \\"where they belong\\".  And the conclusion of the movie turns out to be a sappy romance with a very sexy Hugh Jackman and lip plumped Nicole Kidman (whatever she is doing to her face to make herself look younger is NOT working - she no longer looks natural).  Great movie idea, poor delivery.
B001PR0Y5S|4.0|The last few \\"romantic comedies\\" I've seen have fallen a few slices short of a full loaf. This, of course, includes the catastrophe that was \\"Ghosts of Girlfriends Past\\" and a few others over the past couple of years.  This movie (while definitely reusing and recycling a familiar plot device--couple together under false pretences who.....***spoiler potential***) was still a fun story. I thoroughly enjoyed both Reynolds and Bullock.    The story: A tough female-boss (Sandra Bullock) is being deported to Canada. To avoid losing her lucrative job as executive editor-in-chief of a book publishing company, she blackmails her doormat of an assistant (Ryan Reynolds) to marry her. He grudgingly agrees to play along because of a tantalizing career offer.   The real story begins, though, once they head to Alaska to \\"Meet the Parents.\\"  In order to avoid spoiling the movie I'll pull the reigns back on the story and simply say, \\"Take your wife/girlfriend to see this movie.\\"  You'll earn some brownie points and even get in a laugh or two along the way.
0061537969|5.0|It is a good book about a dog's relationship with his owner from a dog's point of view. Dog lover's will enjoy it.
0316001821|4.0|Now I see what everyone's been talking about, what a great book! I can't believe I didn't read it sooner, but at least I got to it before the movie comes out.    I was surprised at how classy the writing was, something I would think would be quite difficult when writing about life in heaven, and even the grief of the family. There were so many opportunities to veer towards cheesy, and while the author occasionally gave a nod in that direction, for the most part she managed to keep the over-sentimentality in check.    For anyone who has ever lost someone dear to them, I would think they would find this book comforting. Knowing there's someone up there watching their family is a nice thought, even if (***POSSIBLE SPOILER ALERT***) the body snatcher ending was somewhat less than appealing for me. That being said, I think that was just about the only conclusion the author could make in order to tie up a somewhat happy ending. Still, I much preferred the first 2/3 of the book to the somewhat contrived finale, even if those sections were a bit more morbid.
B0017ANAZO|2.0|If you are going to watch this movie you should definitely watch the 1939 version starring Norma Shearer (in the role Meg Ryan attempts to play) and Joan Crawford (Eva Mendes's role) first - because, not only is the acting in the 1939 version better, but the plot fits the times better. And although Debra Messing came very close to having that same comedic timing that the '39 cast showed - the 2008 version just doesn't stand up next to the 1939 - nor will it stand the test of time.  However if you are a huge fan of Sex and the City and the like you will probably like this film. But... If you like the classics like I Love Lucy and Singin'In The Rain - then the 1939 version is DEFINITELY the one you should watch.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|This is eye-opening to say the least. This is not to cause fear and panic to therefore paralyze us, BUT to encourage us that we can take action by buying locally grown, good quality whole foods! What we spend our money on is \\"casting our vote\\". Who and what are we voting/supporting in the world of food? Stop shopping the supermarket crap and when possible, buy local organic whole foods.  Very good!
B000IVW25M|1.0|We received Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs DVD and it is incompatible with our Panasonic DVD player.  We've never had this problem before with any other DVD.  The Snow White disk works in our computer and another player in our office, but not in the DVD player that we have at home.  Consequently, we haven't been able to view the movie with our child.
0385751893|3.0|As numerous reviewers have pointed out, this book is utterly absurd.  There is no way that a 9 year old in Hitler's Germany would be utterly unaware of Jews or how to pronounce \\"the Fuhrer\\", and a mini-city such as Auschwitz is far too large for anyone nearby to be unaware of its existence.  Having said that, I had no trouble finishing this book in an hour or two- it may be absurd, but it was somewhat entertaining I suppose. A side note: the violence in this book is MUCH more sanitized than in the movie.  So it may be an appropriate book for children.
B00284BMBM|5.0|This album has become better with each listening.  It opens with the distinctive Daughtry sound with the growling guitars and the deep rock voices, the anger and the failed-love type song. You expected that, but I'm going to say those (including \\"You Don't Belong\\" and \\"What I Meant To Say\\") are some of the weakest songs on the album in terms of lyric complexity and the ability to hold interest.<br /><br />What I've found is that in this album, Daughtry branches out and takes chances with songs like \\"Tennessee Line\\" and \\"Call Your Name\\" which have a different, pensive, yearning feel. \\"Open Up Your Eyes\\" has complex, sad lyrics that aren't easily pigeonholed.<br /><br />\\"Traffic Light\\" is a powerful song that I want to listen to through headphones and really get a sense of the lyrics. I already like it a lot; I want to know more about what he's talking about.<br /><br />Overall, I find this album has a better mix of song types than the first, but the irony is that this may make it less of a commercial success. Two days after the album's release, I can't easily pick out which songs will become hits. \\"Traffic Light\\" may well get airtime. \\"No Surprise,\\" which is already on the radio, is one of the weaker songs on the album and doesn't cater to Daughtry's vocal strengths, but is easily pigeonholed, and I can see why it was released first. But his best songs on this album (\\"Call Your Name,\\" \\"Tennessee Line\\" and \\"Open Up Your Eyes\\") aren't going to be the ear-catchers that make up most radio listening.<br /><br />If you enjoyed Daughtry's first album, or the songs that made it to the air the first time, I would recommend Leave This Town. I'm enjoying it and I'm sure that the more I listen, the more I'll find to enjoy.
B00005QGAT|5.0|I have been listening to this for the past week, almost twice a day.  It showcases Michael as a musical genius and I think will be remembered as one of the best albums of all time.  Every track is good.  Even beyond the most popular tracks, the \\"B side\\" songs are incredible. His voice has so much range.  It's worth buying this and Thriller over the \\"Essential\\" album, because you've got to hear the whole thing.  It was arranged perfectly from start to finish - back when thought was given to the order of songs (people couldn't skip from track to track).  I especially like \\"Girlfriend\\" which is somewhat bubblegum but recalls Motown flavor.  Paul McCartney wrote it specifically for MJ and the harmony is wonderful.  What I especially like about this album is that it's feel good - a totally happy ride.
0553801473|1.0|1 word disappointing. If 1 has to wait for more than 2 yrs before the next book is released, the book should be expected to move the story forward more than this book did. I am too disappointed to say too much. I will not be buying the next book hard cover. I can certainly wait for it to come out on paperback. At least, by buying it cheaper, it might make me more lenient.
B000004CYT|5.0|I have to agree with most of the reviews here. Two things I'd like to stress:   1. This is not a small-chamber-like orchestra sound. What you get here is A mighty performances. The 9th 2nd movement literally make me jump of my seat. But it is the 5th, the true benchmark, which set aside all comparisons. This is a glorious performance.   2. The whole periodic non-periodic debate is partly misleading. I don't really care if this is how one suppose to play Beethoven or not. The main difference between modern orchestra and periodic is that modern orchestra, its aim, is to sound as integrative as possible. One big polished instrument. On period orchestra one can actually here all the instruments working together, talking to each other, singing. That's the whole beauty.   What is even more admirably about this set is that Hogwood is not fanatic to his period style - it's the music that really counts here. For example, the 2nd movement of the 3rd is as slow as one can imagine. As others pointed out, this is a playing with a heart. I dare to say almost sentimental.    To sum it up, the genuine quality of this playing (beside sound quality that is out of this world) is the miracles way Hogwood gets all the parts together, from the way the instruments answer each other, to the way one movement works as a part of the symphony structure. It all builds one on top of the other. And when it's working - there's no match in any other set available.    It's fierce and delicate, it's transparent and brutal, I'd used to think very little of Beethoven symphonies, it appears to be I was merely hearing the wrong performance.
B00005QGAT|5.0|I have always considered myself a Michael Jackson fan but I never listened to the entire \\"Off The Wall\\" album until after his passing. Of course, I was familiar with the more popular songs from the album such as \\"Don't Stop 'til You Get Enough\\" and \\"Rock with You\\" but I was pleasantly suprised to discover such gems like \\"Get on the Floor\\" and \\"I Can't Help It\\". Michael just sounded so...so HAPPY on this album. He sung with reckless abandonment and vocally he was on top of his game. Of course I loved all his work that followed \\"Off The Wall\\", but this is my fav MJ album.
B001FB4VXU|3.0|While Big Bang Theory is easily one of the funniest , this review looks to point out a few things about the DVD set.<br /><br />A show like this would have lots more to offer by way of DVD extras and I think the previous set was sorely lacking.<br /><br />Commentaries are fine but there could be more.<br />Bloopers and gag reels for one. More interviews, maybe even some with their physics experts (which we know the show employs). Pop culture reference trivia. And plenty more.<br /><br />For a show that mines the geek culture with such brilliance, the DVD set is found wanting. Quite the irony. I will still buy this because I love the show, but I wish the DVD producers would step up.<br /><br />And congratulations to Jim Parsons for the Emmy nomination. VERY well deserved.
1600610234|3.0|While this isn't an in depth book on drawing, it does give some useful advice on how you can start to go about creating your own work, using the book as a reference guide. Written by someone with a lot of experience of working in a professional environment, Doug talks about some of the basic principles for producing good work. Always encouraging to see that something which looks difficult and complex started out as a modest sketch. If you're going to be able to draw as well as this you need to spend a fair bit of time doing normal observational drawing, Doug has an excellent eye for form and perspective. You don't get this good just from working from photos or spending all your time in Photoshop.
0375842209|4.0|I loved this book. Why? I am not sure. I think it was because it gave me a perspective on life that I never really thought of. I am in my early twenties and this book really made me think about my life and how good I have it. I really don't know what it means to be poor, to be afraid to go outside and live my religion. I think everyone takes life for granted and this book took me a long time to read. I didn't want to read it fast just to finish it. I wanted to savor every page, so that I was able to truly understand what it means. This is a good book, but it is sad.     I honestly wouldn't recommend this book unless you are over 16 though. You might not truly understand what is going on or appreciate the book.
B000TERK14|4.0|It's a scientific fact that most actors suck rocket gas as rock stars. And usually vice versa. Jared Leto has proven to be the exception to that rule in the case of [[ASIN:B00006AFUR 30 Seconds to Mars]]. The band's debut was a decent modern rock album with spacey flourishes and managed to gain attention for - frankly - not sucking. But it was mostly a two man operation, with Jared playing and singing most everything and his brother Shannon.<br /><br />For the second launch, 30 Seconds To Mars is now a band. The touring unit went into the studio and emerged with a more solid album that trims the space and gets a bit more down to earth. \\"A Beautiful Lie\\" comes of as the equal of [[ASIN:B000G6BL7E Breaking Benjamin]] or [[ASIN:B000069HK2 The Used]], in that they rely on dark atmospherics while sustaining memorable melodies. It's easy to remember the title song and the spooky closer \\"A Modern Myth\\" hold their own with most emo-screamo bands. They even invest a bit of My Chemical Romance's drama on \\"Was It A Dream.\\"<br /><br />Then again, Jared Leto is an actor, so dramatics should be expected. While I would not call \\"A Beautiful Lie\\" a masterwork, it's well beyond most thespian rock. And [[ASIN:B000E8JO1E Wicked Wisdom]], [[ASIN:B00004U05T Dogstar]] or [[ASIN:B00004OCPA Bruce Willis]] this ain't.
B000ZEE3I6|4.0|While the fifth installment provided some of the darkest moments seen in the series, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince displays an even more sinister and morbid approach to the deadly witchcraft and devious wizardry. But with that darkness comes an alleviating light found in the romantic mishaps and jealous tussles between the students. Blending the foreboding presence of encroaching doom with Quidditch practice, schoolwork, and blossoming high school romances, the sixth entry in the legacy of Harry Potter is simultaneously the most mature and the most entertaining, though the days of playful sorcery and lighthearted misadventures are long gone.<br /><br />In the sixth year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry it is dark times indeed. The school itself has become a breeding ground for danger and deception and the surmounting minions of the evil Lord Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes) have brought forth destruction even to the innocents of the outside world of muggles. As a new potions teacher, Horace Slughorn (Jim Broadbent), is recruited for mysterious reasons, Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) must contend with ominous missions from Headmaster Dumbledore (Michael Gambon) as well as his growing feelings for Ginny Weasly (Bonnie Wright) and the newfound jealous tension between his best friends Ron (Rupert Grint) and Hermione (Emma Watson).<br /><br />If you're willing to make the five-movie investment, the sixth Harry Potter film is well worth the time. Startlingly suspenseful, tenebrous and scarier than the previous films, with a generously lenient PG rating, the characters have finally reached the point where their budding relationships and daunting trials against the dark arts are almost entirely adult. It's a new kind of Harry Potter film with a Tim Burtonesque feel and wondrously foreboding sets and atmospheres (Diagon Alley now resembles the battered, rain-beaten streets in Sweeney Todd). Harry always seems to be covered in blood or unconscious, Hogwart's security has reached the point of a prison, the spells have turned to curses, the charms into hexes, and the potions into deadly black magic. Even the colors appear washed with blackness or drastically muted. By the end of it all, Harry's going to need an extra dose of liquid luck and the audience will need a hearty round of butterbeer with ginger.<br /><br />Perhaps most appealing about the series is the opportunity to see a group of children become young adults, and to journey with them in their adventurous maturation. Any one year seems inconsequential compared to the larger picture, the grand scheme of mastering fantastical powers and defeating the many avenues of evil. Along the way there are plenty of chances at humor and lightheartedness, especially in the evolving relationships (such as a spirited snogging-filled love triangle) between Harry, Hermione, Ginny, Ron, and newcomer Lavender Brown, as well as several important supporting characters including the many schoolteachers, friends, families and enemies. As the characters become old enough for their interactions and expressions to mean more and for their actions to become more significant, powerful or even fatal, the entertainment is more solid and the story more fulfilling. Even if it plays out like they're all making it up as they go, the tragedies feel authentic and the leads are genuinely sympathetic. Finally the chemistry, adventure, special effects and fantasy can all be taken seriously.<br /><br />- The Massie Twinsched the point of a prison, the spells have turned to curses, the charms into hexes, and the potions into deadly black magic.

B000A2RRF4|5.0|Michael did it all! I miss him! I never saw him in concert, but this is the next best thing! What a show!
B0007PAMBK|5.0|This version with Mike Nelson's commentary isn't a bad edition at all. Mike's solo commentary is pretty amusing. I miss the team concept, but he carries his own. This is available with BOTH the b&w and colorized on the same disc. The colorized version isn't actually that bad. Colorization has come a long way since the 1980s. Of course part of what makes COS IS the b&w photography and the version used here is in nice condition. It appears to be the 83 minute \\"director's cut\\". Like many people, I grew up with the \\"road show\\" version that runs about 78 minutes or even less and the longer version seems to drag to me. Too much talk and not enough moody set pieces. This shorter version is available from Alpha, Goodtimes and on the Criterion set with the \\"Director's Cut\\". If you need a budget \\"Carnival\\" you can make far worse choices than this edition. Mike Nelson, the long version and both color and b&W choices makes this a pretty good deal.

0765322889|1.0|In order for me to quit a book it has to be really bad.  This book fits the bill.  It jumped from scene to scene and character to character so quickly that I never developed any real feelings for any of the characters.  It addition, while I felt that the descriptive language was good, I think that those words would have been better spent on character-development.  I tried to give it to my husband to read and he couldn't stand it - mind you, my husband will trudge through almost anything.  I am shocked at all of the good reviews that this book received.  It is sub-par.  Do not waste your time or money on this book.
B000ZEE3I6|4.0|One aspect of this series that consistently impresses me is seeing how the characters grow both in written word and film. \\"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince\\" is a darker, harsher world than the previous entries leading into the conclusion of the series.     In the very beginning, we see devastating attacks by the death eaters on London in full view of the regular (muggle) population. Albus Dumbledore (Gambon) solicits Harry Potter (Radcliffe) to come with him to convince retired Prof. Slughorn (Broadbent) to come back to Hogwarts to teach Potions. There's more than just filling an empty faculty chair on the cagey wizard's mind, though.  He wants Harry to allow Slughorn to 'capture' him.     Harry returns to the Weasley home to BFF's Ron (Grint) and Hermione (Watson) and the rest of the clan. Disappearances are still happening and many parents do not want their children to return to Hogwarts.  Even Hermoine's muggle family don't want her back.     Next, we move to Severus Snape (Rickman) taking an oath to protect Draco Malfoy (Felton) and help him carry out the mission Voldemort has pressed upon him.     Definitely an excellent setup for a film where a lot has to happen even in a three-hour timespan.  The cast is getting older. Harry and Hermione are both suffering the blues when their respective love interests are turning to others. Dumbledore is relying more and more on Harry who has learned to simply go with it. Of course, there are the usual intrigues and Quidditch games as well.     This is not my favorite HP film, but definitely one I would own and very much worth the time to see it on opening night.  Excellent setup for the final two films in the series.  I will hate to say goodbye to this cast.      Rebecca Kyle, July 2009
B000QUEQBS|5.0|This is a great movie! I really enjoy Walhberg films. The action scenes are great and the acting was good too. Just a good sit back and enjoy movie.
B0028K31CE|5.0|Like many, I anticipated this album for all those years Maxwell took a break to gather his creative strength. I also expected vintage Maxwell - that breathtaking falsetto and the sensuous, romantic, oh so sexy tracks but the heady BLACK Summer's Night mix is so much more than that. It is a sensory delight of soaring horns, abstract reads on ordinary situations and the voice I've loved since UHS. It represents, very well, a grown and sexy Maxwell- classy, elegant and downright emotionally gritty at times. BSN was worth the wait, it did not disappoint (Maxwell never does) and I'm grateful to him for having the generosity of spirit not to say anything until he had something meaningful to say. Isn't there someone on the music scene right now you wish would just go somewhere and sit down for awhile?    No need to skip tracks, fluttery and poignant Pretty Wings is a contemporary interpretation of old school soul. Bad Habits builds from the slow simmer of Maxwell's incredible falsetto opening to a rolling boil of sexy swagger. Fistful of Tears and the acoustic Playing Possum are emotionally charged grown folks songs that seep into your heart and mind. Socially conscious Help Somebody rocks enough to make you want to \\"do something\\". Stop The World and Love You are romantic tributes to what we all seek in relationships with someone very special. Cold is probably the least \\"Maxwell like\\" track but it bounces, sway and grooves us right onto the dance floor. The techno groove of Phoenix Rise (a tribute to an outstanding band?) prepares us for the next installment of BSN. We may never know all of Maxwell's secrets and we don't need to - we've got the music, the man and the mystique that made us fans in the first place. Above all, we've got his amazing artistry and two more albums to look forward to. Thank you, Maxwell, for a clear and strong voice in the mess that is contemporary R&B.
B000001ELP|5.0|Gene $immons and Paul $tanley should have stuck to their guns and given this album it's dues instead of doing a total back flip and being the most savage critics of their own work. A piece of work that will stand the test of time compared to most of their 'C*ck R*ck' Anthems    All things challenging takes time to fully comprehend. I didn't get this album when it first came out, it was dark and disturbing, almost depressing. I was sixteen then, but have grown to appreciate it more than ever. It's a darkly atmospheric album that ultimately becomes inspirational and full of light. I'll never forget playing this for a 'Kiss Hater' (the local dope dealer,lol) not long after the album came out, and he was blown away; Even more so when I said, \\"this is KISS\\"!!!   I don't mind people bagging this album or KISS in general, but when KISS start to criticize their own work along with disrespecting their fans; With comments such as Paul's, \\"what drugs are you on\\", in response to a fans request for KISS to perform the whole 'ELDER' album live. Well that makes me feel a little 'betrayed' to say the least.   One day Gene and Paul will appreciate this album more, and maybe even Ace. It's a 5 Star Album as is but it possibly could have been even better. When Ace recieved 'The Elder\\" tape and heard it for the first time he was so appalled at the final mix that he ejected it and threw it at the wall, smashing it to pieces!   While recording 'The Elder' Album Ace Fedexed all his guitar parts to the studio in Toronto where Paul, Gene, Eric Carr and producer Bob Ezrin (coked out of his gord) were working in total secrecy. Ace (probably coked out of his gord as well) prefered to work from the comfort of his home studio in Connecticut. Unfortunately Gene, Paul and Bob saw fit to totally omitt and severly edit most of Ace's lead breaks. By Ace's accounts he did some amazing guitar work that no one got to hear.    Ever since I found out about this I wondered if those tapes were saved and ifso why not re-release the album with all of Ace's original lead breaks mixed back in, an 'Expanded Anniversary Edition of (Music From) The Elder'. What do you reckon Gene??? I'd buy one, and no Paul I'm not on drugs.    For example the song 'I' is a great song, but would definately benefit with an Ace solo. Everytime that song gets to the 'hand clapping part' and the drum roll comes in at the end of it I expect to hear Ace's lead guitar bubbling up and taking the song to another level. No wonder Ace didn't turn up for the video taping of the 'Studio 54' performance of the song. What was he gonna do, just stand there, he probably felt that he had no role in KISS any more...   Anyway, I know it's a long shot, especially now that Ace and Peter have been permanantly removed from all things Kiss, but stanger things have happened throughout Kisstory...
B00023BLXK|5.0|This movie is one of my favorites. I absolutely love it, and have seen it a bunch of times and every time after I watch it I wanna go out to a salsa club with my husband. Awesome movie! I would recommend to anyone who loves a little romance in a dance movie!
B0015XHQTE|5.0|I had never seen a Dirty Harry movie. Not one. I had always wanted to see these movies and I have realized that I had been severely missing out. I am a big fan of Clint Eastwood. I have followed him since I saw his Man with no Name trilogy some 6 or 7 years ago. Though I am quite familiar with the Hard-Boiled cop genre I was very interested to see the origin of said genre. I noticed many similarities between this and Die Hard, or Shaft. These movies redefined the cop by giving him the weapons to fight against not only the criminals but against the bureaucrats that protect the interest of the criminals.
B001FB4VXU|5.0|I have watched this show from the beginning, at first because nothing else interesting was on, but now my family and I are hooked. Sheldon is so socially inept it is hilarious, with his friends having to hold up signs denoting when sarcasm is being used. It's not your typical \\"dumb vs. smart\\" storyline, because the geniuses cannot function in social situations, whereas Penny is their \\"bridge\\" to the \\"normal\\", while getting her own education on how different people function.  Something unusual I have noticed, as a mom to children with autism, is many family members of autistics tune in, and I have recommended it to my psych classmates simply because it is so funny and quirky.
0143038419|1.0|I had also heard all the hype for this book and bought it without reading the Amazon reviews (a mistake I don't plan to repeat. I don't often quit books, but I was very tempted. I scanned my way through most of it. I find it interesting that someone can ramble on and on without ever making a point, yet somehow get a bestseller out of it.
B001FB4W0W|5.0|This show is amazing, it is the best adult show on tv along with Dexter.
B00000K3D4|5.0|I love, love, love this movie and have ever since I was a child.. when ofcourse I would watch it repeatedly.  The many Goblins (from the mind of the late Jim Henson) and their many humorous antics, hoggle (wasn't that his name?), the fox and his dog ambroscious, the gassy swamp of eternal stench... a real classic!!  I'm not a fan of fantasy flicks at ALL, but this one gets a major reprieve.  For the record, watching David Bowie with big hair, big makeup and overly tight leggings 20 years ago was disturbing and it still is. IMO, even though I watched this movie repeatedly as a kid, as an adult I still find it entertaining and just as funny.
006085880X|1.0|This book was a real page turner but had a very disappointing ending.  I felt that Miss Picoult could have done so much more with this story.  It had the potential for so many twists.  I was beginning to think that Chris and Em were brother and sister since it seemed as though Michael Gould and Gus might have been close in the past since they seemed drawn together by this trial and Michael said that he was testifying for Chris.  And, that maybe Em found out and it may have devasted her more to be pregnant by her own brother!  But it turned out there were no twists and the ending was totally boring.  This is my second novel by this author and I won't be reading any more.
B001P9KR94|4.0|SlumDog, an uplifting story about a poor boy's life and his quest to claim his destiny. The blu-Ray is excellent quality and well worth the money spent. I do not have the DVD to compare it to, but it has plenty of features and the digital copy download is also a nice bonus. The digital copy is compatible with both PCs and Macs.
B001W2F730|4.0|Most Neil heads will go on forever about him and I am guilty of it but not here.  This is a great album to pick up, if you are just interested in getting something from Neil as a casual fan and without some of the oddities he can toss out there.  There is only one track not worth the download in my opinion and that is Sail Away, it is so sleepy you might want to kill yourself and it may have been a set up for Powderfinger in that regard.    If you don't go for the full album, you'll likely be pleased with Powdefinger, Thrasher, Pocahontas, Hey Hey My My and My My Hey Hey.      This album is a great introduction to Neil and you might also like the Liverust  album from the same year and tour.  The benefit to the latter is again more of Neil's best songs, with older tunes like Cinnamon Girl mixed in with the new tunes.    If you buy this album or tracks from Rust Never Sleeps and don't like them, it is likely you'll never find interest in Neil's music.  On the other hand, this album got me hooked in, a long time ago.
B000WC3864|5.0|Do you ever find yourself yelling at the screen, \\"Don't go in there!\\"?  You will if you watch this movie!

This Ultimate Edition provided good \\"making of\\" and other extras.
0143038419|1.0|Got it as a gift (M, if you are reading this, sorry, no offense!), which is why I even read the few pages that I did read of it - I couldn't get past some 12 pages or so. I normally finish any book that I pick up, unless I just can't bear the narrative style as well as the theme - unfortunately this book falls in the unbearable category.<br /><br />Obviously from the 5-star reviews here and from feedback from some of my friends, some people really \\"connect\\" with it.. I simply don't understand their view point on this one.<br /><br />The title itself suggests a sort of \\"self-help\\" book, preachy and pseudo-spiritual. Honestly, traveling to India on a spiritual quest has become an over-used cliche. Not sure if the author discovered anything of herself or spirituality in her travels - from the sound of the other reviews here, she did not! Glad I did not waste the time reading it fully.

0440241030|5.0|If you haven't read any of the Reacher books, then this is a good one to start with. As the story opens, we join Reacher as he's doing what he loves best, drinking coffee. Then someone joins him asking him what he saw the night before. That simple question puts Reacher in the middle of something he doesn't want to be in.  After a while, he gets involved with some people who were all in the Military, and were special forces. It seems that the leader of this crew has a wife and she's kidnapped. It's up to Reacher to sort out everything and come to a shocking truth that leads to a violent ending. There's just one way for Reacher to solve this, the only way he knows how, the hard way. I don't want to say to much more than that.<br /><br />This is such a great and easy read. The Hard Way has outstanding plot twists and turns. I HIGHLY suggest this, you won't be sorry.
B000T9OP7G|5.0|This was really an amazing series for me. The characters were really cool and intriguing. Derek Reese was probably my favorite character. As a whole, I would rate this series a 9/10. I too am sad to hear that FOX did not choose to renew the show for a third season. This show had quality and was very well written. I will miss The Sarah Connor Chronicles. Can't wait for season 2 on DVD.
B000063JDE|5.0|This is quintessential Lynch.  The characters are spellbinding.  The story is captivating.  It lacks the circular motif that appears so strongly in later works.  The film is unmistakably Lynch, but is likely to be appreciated by non-Lynch fans as well.    Kyle MacLachlan is his usual self.  I find him to be consistently and dependably good.      Anthony Hopkins delivers what I consider to be his most memorable performance.  His character achieves proportions that have been burned an impression in my mind that only deepens as I get older.    This is a keeper.
0060853972|5.0|There is not much to say here. The plain and simple fact is that by joinning forces with Neil Gaiman, Terry Pratchett has produced his signature masterpiece. And considering his prodigious output and the extraordinary quality he has maintained over these past decades, that is saying something special. You want funny? Good Omens delivers on almost every page, sometimes in multiples. You want pithy? You got it. You want heartwarming? Heck, there's some of that here too. How about some of the most outrageous and outrageously memorable characters since Dickens put pen to page? You can't swing a dead cat without whapping at least a couple when you're in the environs of \\"Good Omens\\".<br /><br />Read it. Your life will be better. And then there will be the ripple effect and we'll all benefit.
B001RTSPVY|5.0|This show examines the good, the bad, and the ugly of the drug and the people involved.  Dark comedy at its best.  It has lots of ironic twists that just add to how good the writing is.  The characters have other issues besides the meth aspect and you can get caught up in their struggles and want better for them, to  me that is what a great series is; to pull you in and cheer for them and feel their pain as well.

While the plot is familiar (broody/silent warrior helps bratty orphan) it's packed with a lot of action scenes that are very bloody ala Kill Bill.<br /><br />Set during the Sengoku (feudal warring states) era in Japan, the story is about Kotarou, an orphan boy being hunted by Chinese Ming soldiers. He and his loyal (and cute) dog meets Nanashi a nameless wandering samurai. They travel together and eventually cross paths with Rarou, the strongest of the Ming warriors who is also looking for a worthy opponent to fight with.<br /><br />The 'stranger' in the story happens to be a foreigner. Nanashi the ronin is often haunted by nightmares of his past. He doesn't know his real name and only knows that he was the sole survivor of a shipwreck. He dyes his naturally red hair black to blend in. Rarou the Ming swordsman is also a westerner, he is big, blond and blue eyed. It is not explained how he ended up in China. Anyway, these two meet up in one of the best animated swordfight scenes in a long time.<br /><br />It's interesting that the strongest swordsmen in this story happen to be outsiders - westerners. While both the Japanese and Chinese overlords are far from honorable. One weak spot is the lack of explanation to why Kotarou is specifically important to the Ming emperor's immortality ceremony.<br /><br />So if you are a fan of Yoji Yamada & Kurosawa sword flicks and anime like Rurouni Kenshin (identical to Nanashi, guilt-ridden red hair swordsman) & Samurai Champloo you will enjoy this film.

0743297334|5.0|A beautiful book which I wouldn't mind reading again and again. The backdrops to this story - Paris and Spain are beautifully and evocatively described. Not that I am much of a bull-fight fan. To the contrary. But Hemingway's descriptions fit in the context, and make even someone who is against such barbaric pastimes like the book.<br /><br />There is a scene of Jake and his friend Bill fishing in a river in a village in Spain, leaving their bottles of wine in the cool stream for chilling. The way it's described makes me wish I was there (not fishing though!).<br /><br />I saw a few of the 1-star reviews here - most of them dislike the book because \\"nothing happens\\", \\"the characters lack morals and hence the book lack morals\\", \\"the characters are 2-dimensional\\" (I vehemently disagree with this last). I guess if you disagree with the moral standpoint (or lack thereof) of the book, then it's difficult to like the book.. this book is not for you if you believe in \\"one set of morals fit all\\".<br /><br />Yes, the book does describe a desultory lifestyle in which nothing much happens... but the poignancy of the unrequited love between Brett and Jake is palpable (I'm a sucker for love stories, though not necessarily tragic ones). He makes you like or hate the characters as he chooses - which is the whole point of a fiction writer, no?<br /><br />The descriptions of the bull-fights almost make you feel like you are right there watching. Don't read this book if those sort of gory details are disagreeable to you!<br /><br />If you are willing to suspend moral judgements, and read for the sake of immersing yourself in a different time and space, and sort of go with the flow, then this book is highly recommended.
1400049628|2.0|I bought this book after reading \\"world war z\\" which frankly woke me up to the threat of the undead. Unfortunately, my high hopes were dashed. Although the dead pan delivery is amusing at times, the book's quite boring. And even more irritating, after I bought the book, I found an excellent site where just about everything Brooks writes is there and for free ([...]). From home defence to choice of weapons, it's all there. Finally, this is a book for Americans, with their [..] and gun stores and huge outdoors. Not for the majority of humanity who live in smaller crowded countries with far stricter gun laws and less of the great outdoors to escape to.
B00275EGWO|5.0|Without any intentions of comparison - because, really there are none - one of my favorite exchanges from any militarily oriented movie is found in G. I. Jane when Demi Moore's character is questioned about her motivations to continue struggle through SEAL training and she responds by asking how males in the program answer the same question, with the answer being \\"Cause I get to blow (expletive, naturally) up.\\"  In this movie, Jeremy Renner in the role of Sgt. William James antes up by placing his very existence into the mix. In fact his portrayal is so intense and the movie itself so engrossing that I really didn't get the title until I sat down to write this review.<br /><br />This is a movie where one of those perfunctory reviews I detest stating something like \\"It's fantastic, just go see it,\\" take on heightened significance because I am convinced forays at analysis suffused with superlatives and accolades are paradoxically a disservice to anyone who might find the film appealing.  That said, if it is action, suspense and examination of the human condition that compels one to the theater, it is a film not to be missed regardless of the challenges of finding a screen featuring this lightly publicized, under distributed gem.<br /><br />If you liked Hamburger Hill or Blackhawk Down, you will be captivated by The Hurt Locker. It is a film with an agenda but unlike other film depictions of the Iraqi conflict it is about the military personnel mired in the conflagration, politicized perceptions and issues of justification are left for others to debate. There are a few marquee and above the title names but their extremely limited contributions are supplemental to the exemplary performances of the three major characters, portrayed by Anthony Mackie, Brian Geraghty and as previously noted, Jeremy Renner.  From the opening sequence, director Kathryn Bigelow puts the viewer in the roller coast money seats and doesn't let up on the throttle for next two hours.  Utilizing single camera technique, she puts you in the line of fire enduring environmental stresses in the face of sniper attack, inside an under- armored Humvee traveling across IED mined streets or peering out the mask of a bomb disposal technician's inadequately protective helmet, hoping to survive to the day military command has advised you are entitled breath regularly again, if your autonomic systems still remember.<br /><br />Are there stereotypical presentations, story arcs you've seen often enough to know the outcome from the instance of recognition, of course. Yet, with the intensity of scenes and poignancy of message, the visceral reaction tells you those deficiencies or flaws are of little consequence. If like me, you consider yourself a war film junkie once the dvd becomes available this is the movie that is most likely to be your go to disc whenever an adrenaline injection is the aim of the day.hnique, she puts you in the line of fire enduring environmental stresses in the face of sniper attack, inside an under- armored Humvee traveling across IED mined streets or peering out the mask of a bomb disposal technician's inadequately protective helmet, hoping to survive to the day military command has advised you are entitled breath regularly again, if your autonomic systems still remember.

B0011KQSZ4|5.0|First time I watched it, I cried from laughing so hard. Non stop laughing all movie long! This is kind of a movie you want to re-watch sometime even if you know what's going to happen. I think it is a genius comedy script... so real and so funny!
B00028HBKC|5.0|This film is a beautiful, brilliant account of the last days of Jesus the Christ.  Reading historical accounts of crucifixions proves the torturous punishments were actually far worse than Mel Gibson presented here.  It is really no surprise that this film was criticized - who, but believers, would care to be humbled and grateful for a God Who is willing to give up that which is most precious to Him - His own Son.  Others were so quick to find fault, believing the film cast blame on the Jews or the Romans.  In all actuality, God spoke clearly through the Bible that no one took the life of Jesus; He gave it up of His own accord.  It was the high cost He paid to redeem the lives of those who choose to believe in Jesus the Messiah.
B00284BMBM|3.0|I quite liked Daughtry's self titled debut, as did quite a few other people apparently; it sold over 3 million in the US alone. Simple but catchy Rock songs with heartfelt lyrics (\\"It's not over\\" and \\"Breakdown\\" were simply brilliant).<br /><br />Well, when I read the band would be working with the likes of Chad Kroeger from Nickelback, and Ryan Tedder from OneRepublic (the Tedder song(s) didn't make it to the album), on their sophomore disc, I kinda feared for the worst. They don't veer much from the sound on their debut (so banish those dreams of their doing a \\"Radiohead\\" or \\"TV on the Radio\\") and this should please fans of their debut. Problem is, there are just too many songs which are just, well, harmless, and nothing quite matches the afore mentioned pair of brilliant songs off their debut.<br /><br />Opening is the cutting and edgy \\"You don't belong\\" (frantic and heavy guitars) which is rather very good and my favourite. Also good are the chugging \\"What I meant to say\\" (nice Bon Jovi-style chorus), \\"Open up your eyes\\" (absolutely lovely, starts off slow-ish and builds to an incredibly catchy chorus and I love the way they sing \\"Open up your eyeeees\\"), the acoustic \\"September\\", the upbeat \\"Ghost of me\\", the plodding \\"Supernatural\\" (I noticed some don't like this but hey!), the Country-ish acoustic ballad \\"Tennesse line\\", and  \\"Call your name\\" (which really showcases his brilliant vocals and I like the way it is acoustic till about 2'30\\" when the full band kicks in - my second favourite song). The other songs are just okay. I wasn't expecting any drastic experimentation but they are so forgettable.<br /><br />I feel Chris Daughtry should really write more songs alone, the best song here \\"You don't belong\\" was penned by him alone, while the blandest were the pair co-penned with Kroeger (\\"Life after you\\" and \\"No surprise\\"). Anyway, this is sure to please fans of their debut (it's sure better than loads of stuff on the US charts) and sell some more millions. 3 and a half stars really!
0385340575|5.0|Jack Reacher is back in action. We meet him at New York night subway train, when Reacher recites the Israeli \\"suicide bomber check point list\\" - twelve points for men, eleven points for women. When one of the women in the train car \\"clicks\\" all the points, Reacher decides to move. From this moment, nothing happens as expected. NYPD, Feds and Department of Defense get involved and the plot moves forward so fast, that the reader doesn't have time to breathe in between the pages.    Overall, I liked the latest installment of Reacher series more than previous two books. First, Lee Child got the right mood from every perspective - geopolitical, psychological, and historical (I don't know about military one, so I am going to believe this one is authentic, as well). This made the story as plausible as the news - may be, even more.     Second, I was glad to see that Lee Child switched to first-person narrative. The military precision and abruptness of the writing, especially in dialogues, is definitely more natural in first person narrative. \\"I said nothing\\", coming from Reacher's mouth, is slightly less annoying than infamous \\"Reacher said nothing\\" from the previous books.    Also, in \\"Gone tomorrow\\" Jack Reacher is more the one from the early books: \\"the only guy in the world without a cell phone\\", who has difficulties adapting to the modern world realities. I loved the scene when Reacher used internet to find the information. In any other book, the protagonist would turn to Google search on the first two pages - and probably, would save to himself a lot of trouble and public-transportation travel time. By the time Reacher got to the internet, I began to wonder whether he heard at all about Google. Apparently, he did.    There is only one thing that I didn't like in this book. It is more \\"graphic\\", than previous books. Apparently, it comes with the territory - Afghanistan, in this case - but some of the scenes were too descriptive to my taste and slightly disturbing. Well, this, and \\"I said nothing\\" phrase on every second page. But I am getting used to it.    Fast-read, full of tension and action thriller - highly recommended both to fans of Reacher series and to those who had never read any book in the series. \\"Gone tomorrow\\" is perfect as stand alone novel, the knowledge of Reacher's background is not necessary to enjoy the book. You will not be disappointed.
B001V7YWTQ|5.0|I have the CD and DVD. The reason this recording and band works so well, on so many levels, is primarily because the drummer, bass player, and keyboard player play only what is needed and stay out of Clapton's and Winwood's way. They play crisp and clear and accurately, which makes all the difference. What a team of players on this recording-it just doesn't get any better than this. And the song selection is so strong. Clapton is at his best without any dopey backup guitarist(s)-save for George Terry or Winwood, of course. No dopey dancing backup singers, no horn players, just the essentials here. The band also tries to stay close to the original songs and I especially love the Blind Faith stuff like \\"Well Alright\\". \\"Can't Find My Way Home\\" sounds like a national anthem with the crowd chanting the words with Winwood in the background. Good stuff, and just incredible that the Blind Faith catalog sounds so cool this many years later. \\"Sea Of Joy\\" would have been interesting to include. It would have been nice if Ginger Baker had the ability to join in this endeavor but even he hasn't been able to play the way he used to, for a very long time now. But we love you, Ginger! Even the recent Cream reunion doesn't stack up to this-they waited too long to get together. Can you imagine what Cream would have been like in the 60's and 70's if Winwood had joined them and the group stayed together? That would have been a Supergroup, my friends. Winwood still has the outstanding vocals and musical prowness to excite and his vocals with Clapton work perfectly. Clapton is always outstanding. Clapton, on a bad day, is still better than everyone else on their best day (I like Dickey Betts too, when he played with the Allmans). I like the blues stuff the best; not really into the acoustic, or \\"Georgia\\" or Hendrix things. \\"Double Trouble\\" and \\"Sleeping In The Ground\\" and \\"Tell The Truth\\" give me the chills and are worth the price of admission alone. I know Layla has been played to death in previous concerts, but with this particular band-now that would have been an interesting song to include. How about \\"Same Old Blues\\" instead of boring disco \\"Forever Man\\"? And if only we could get Eric to use a Gibson guitar with a Marshall amp once in a while...do we need to take up a collection, Eric? Anyway, many thanks to Eric and Stevie for putting this together and reviving so much of the best old stuff! A treasure! Hope to see them do more in the future.in previous concerts, but with this particular band-now that would have been an interesting song to include.

0061780308|5.0|There are so many reviews of this book that I run the risk of being  redundant.  So I'll keep it simple.  I liked it so much that I bought it for every member of my book club.  How's THAT for an endorsement?!<br /><br />I know there is a review on the paper book side which is a one star.  I truly don't understand that at all.  Maybe the reviewer was having a bad day.  But, I can tell you ... don't pass up reading, or in my case, listening to this wonderful book.<br /><br />It will warm your heart...and at times...make you weep.
0307454541|3.0|I thought this book was just fair. The beginning was slow and it took me awhile to get into the book. The middle was the best, with the end also long and somewhat drawn out. I seemed to feel something was lost in the translation. I see all the excellent reviews, but for me the characters were rather wooden, and the plot very similar to so many other thriller/mysteries. It was not a stand-out. Perhaps the two main characters did not have the wow factor for me. Mikael Blomkvist was obviously a smart and dedicated man, however, he did not really come to life for me. Women appeared to drop at his feet. He is sleeping with his partner at the magazine, falls into bed with a 56 year old, and then a 22 year old. All he has to do is utter a few words and their in love.  Salander is certainly an interesting character. She has Asperger's Syndrome, however, this form of autism, lends her a one dimensional personality, with an inability to read social cues. She is a women shrouded in mystery, however, her short clipped answers don't lend itself to outstanding dialogue. The mystery itself was unsatisfactory. It is hard for me to believe that a serial murderer could operate in such a small town, with family members all around, over such a long period of time, without anybody becoming suspicious. I was hooked just enough to want to read the sequel, however, if it was not sent to me by a friend who lives in Sweden, I would have waited for a copy from the library.
B000001DVD|5.0|I was 15 when this album came out, so that tells you how long I have been listening to rock music. Having said that, in my opinion, High N' Dry is one of the best rock albums of all time. That's right ALL TIME. Why, because EVERY single song is a masterpiece of duel axe slinging riffs and grinds with great vocals that make you want to crank it and listen to it again and again. This is raw def leppard at their musically creative best. They were never able to duplicate this level of musicianship again, (although Pyromania remains the most popular Leppard release due to 2-3 songs that were big hits). This is the kind of stuff that came out of the 80's metal explosion and what is sorely lacking in today's rock. Leppard, if your listening, go back to your beginning and rock the world again!  On a side note, compare the guitar work on this album to the stuff you hear today, no comparison, where has all the talent gone? So sad.
1416562591|5.0|Anyone who has ever had just five dollars left in their bank account, worked a dead-end job and lacks faith in the spiritual but abandons to its ritual out of frustration might connect with Munnan. He's the lead character in this exquisite piece of writing of Brechtian proportions by Aravind Adiga.     Immediately one is caught in the meandering thoughts of an e-mail written by Munnan (aka Hindi for boy ) to the Premier of China.  Reading the first pages I experienced the writing as my own e-mail. The letter could be addressed to anyone and feels somewhat impersonal and self-servicing. Munnan begins to sound a bit off and his comments are enriched with details of a caste system unknown by so many but slightly familiar in those fleeting moments of financial whoa. I'm  enamored with claims of inauthenticity because that's the point. That's Munnan, he's a hack a sociopathic hack who is aware of his lack of compassion hiding beneath the gentle illusion of service. This man and the story is told in a manor that touches on popularized use of information, of misinformation.     Without giving away too much of the story  which uses a traditional narrative as a way to reinforce the paradox of post-humanism and its relationship to colonialism by sharing a horrific tale of servitude.  The \\"letter\\" calls into question the function of morality, work etiquette and idealism in cultures of poverty (everyone) by explaining each day of Munnan's life as a driver and soon to be murder. Each passage seems to draw attention to the loss of individualism and the dangerous lives of those who seek compassion or reject it. Eventually it becomes apparent the author is the reader's master. Put on trial will we sign the disclosure for a cost? Can you find compassion for Munnan?
B00284BMBM|3.0|You cannot get any more of a bland disk than \\"Leave This Town.\\"  I am amazed at all these five star reviews.  When the best song on the disk sounds like a leftover that didn't make the last Nickelback cd, it sure as heck shouldn't be getting five stars.  There's not one single track that stands out to me.  It's just plain ol' boring and not nearly as good as the first one.

B000MRAAJM|4.0|This is a wonderful series full of beautiful images and a wealth of information. The Blu-Ray release is a bit disappointing as it doesn't include the behind the scenes footage and it also only includes the original narration by David Attenborough. With the space available on Blu-Ray I find this unacceptable!<br /><br />Considering that Blu-Ray is pushing to be top dog in the video market, you would think they would want to include some enticing features and they have dropped the ball here somewhat. This release should have included the behind the scenes footage and both versions of the narrative. .....why not?<br /><br />On the plus side picture and sound are breathtaking and it's a shame that I have to choose between a better looking set and a set with better features! I have recently bought a Blu-Ray player, but I'm not finding many stellar releases to purchase. I'm sure of time I will find some, but if you haven't bought a Blu-Ray player yet, there seems to be no hurry.

1402714580|5.0|Louisa May Alcott's LITTLE WOMEN is a classic novel about the four March daughters, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy, who live in New England at the time of the American Civil War.  The book was originally published in two parts in 1868 and 1869; the first part concerns the girls while their father is away serving as a Union chaplain and the family is suffering financial hardship; the second half follows the girls as they marry, encounter tragedy and celebrate love.  I recently read LITTLE WOMEN in the Sterling edition to my ten-year old daughter.<br /><br />The story holds up quite well 150 years after first publication.  The first half is more accessible to pre-teen children.  It isn't quite as reflective as the second half, which ponders more the trials of life.  Understandably, the challenges of courtship and of married life aren't perhaps so compelling a topic for the pre-teen set.  Moreover, the second part gravitates towards the melodramatic; it doesn't always ring true.  The first half, on the other hand, engages the reader by deftly defining the attributes of each of the sisters: Meg, the responsible one; Beth, the sensitive one; Jo, the tom-boyish writer; and Amy, the girly-girl artist.  The strong bonds between the girls are developed in the first half, and more just seems to happen, especially since their wealthy next-door neighbor Laurie, a friendly boy who is equal parts good hearted and playful, is an object of endless fascination to them.  It's not surprising that children's adaptations focus more on the first half of the book.<br /><br />As one might expect, the novel does engage in moralizing.  Each one of the children has to overcome defects in her character; Jo, for instance, is hot tempered.  The lessons are just obvious enough to young readers, though they might be a little hackneyed for the modern adult reader.  However that may be, one can be assured that the book promotes traditional family values.  It is also refreshingly progressive--for a nineteenth-century novel--on the role of women in society; the daughters are not expected to set aside their personal goals for their husbands.  Jo, for instance, tells her husband-to-be, \\"I have my duty also, and my work.  I couldn't enjoy myself if I neglected them even for you...\\" (p. 509).<br /><br />The Sterling editions are well priced and nicely produced.  They have decent bindings, generally good if spare illustrations (the illustrations in this volume are especially spare), and include a ribbon for marking one's place.  These editions would make a nice addition to a child's library.--on the role of women in society; the daughters are not expected to set aside their personal goals for their husbands.

B001GZ6QC4|4.0|I found this movie to be vaguely familiar.  The general tone of the movie seemed similar to many other films.  (It could just about pass for a French action movie.)  The movie itself is not bad.  But, it was not great either.  It is one of those 'big' movies that would have been much more appreciated on the big screen than the little screen.     The single disk DVD has the movie and pretty much nothing else.
0143034901|5.0|Dare i say this is the best book I've read all year?  Well, dare I will because \\"The Shadow of the Wind\\" is indeed a powerhouse book.  Picking it up on a whim I took a chance on the book and the chance certainly paid off.  Call Zafon whomever you will.  Whether he's the next Dickens, Marquez, or Borges, he's certainly a very talented writer who has a big literary future ahead.  Zafon weaves romance, horror, mystery, and suspense into a compulsively readable tale.  Sure you can read the same sentence on the back cover, but it's so true!  Treat yourself to a remarkable book.  You won't be disappointed!! Loved it.

B00005K3O4|1.0|Basically, lots of folks started talking about how honest to God awful this movie is, and how they were going to troll everyone before trolling was invented by saying it is the best scary movie ever.<br /><br />It's fairly epic that most of the reviews place this movie as a 4+ star ride of awesome, but honestly, it isn't, every single good review managed to think this movie is great because they were tricked by someone else.<br /><br />The power of suggestion over human minds is pretty powerful, as I myself have partaken in this joke, and this is the only place you'll find a review by me that's honest in relation to how terrible this movie is, from the effects to the acting to the actual plot.<br /><br />A grade A stinker that nobody should watch, but everyone should tell someone else to see it for it's 5 stars of greatness!

B001EOOQF6|5.0|I was a huge fan of Ronnie James Dio along with Ritchie Blackmore back in Rainbow.  But as things go, two egos can't always succeed.  Somehow, however, Dio and Iommi are still willing to give it a go.  Next to Heaven & Hell, Mob Rules is my favorite album in this genre.  Again...powerful and exciting...just what metal was meant to be.  If you are looking for the text-book definition of classic metal...you can't go wrong with Dio and Iommi...Heaven & Hell and Mob Rules.
B001DJLCPE|1.0|I wanted to buy this on Blu-Ray, but I see they molested this version like they molested the DVD version.  I guess I won't be buying it...  Thanks a lot idiots!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Everyone who likes sci-fi or Westerns should buy and watch.<br /><br />You'll become a fan guaranteed.
B001AVEJ1Y|5.0|Just saw this in IMAX and I can't wait for the DVD so I can see it again.  I admit I am a bigger fan of Next Generation and Voyager than the original Trek series, but, this movie may entice me to go back and watch some of the original Star Trek movies.  The cast in this movie is FANTASTIC!!!  And there's a few surprises too.     May have to go back to the theater before the DVD comes out!!
B00284BMBM|3.0|Not as good as there first cd. I would have liked to hear more rock. To much pop music for such a great rock singer.
1573300403|5.0|Michael Jackson's heartbreaking death drew me, like so many others, to his music. Rediscovering familiar songs & videos was fun, but most meaningful to me has been acquiring an appreciation for the songs I was not as familiar with. Earth Song tops the list. The music video is hard to watch because it shows man's overwhelmingly cruel treatment of animals and the rape of the earth & rainforests, no doubt due to greed. I believe the song and video are pure Michael Jackson genius. The music is not only beautiful but haunting, and it sticks in your head-- along with the causes it promotes. It will move you to tears, and leave no doubt Michael put his heart and soul into crying out about these atrocities. It is a lasting, forever gift (along with all of the rest of his music) that he gave to us in his effort to make the world a better place. The best gift we could give back to him in return, would be to DO something-- however large or small, to stop the cruel slaughtering of animals & horrific destruction of earth & rainforests.    There is no way you can go wrong adding this DVD to your collection. You will watch these videos again and again-- each and every one.
B000NHG7BQ|5.0|This is soooooooo much better than the more conservative<br />original release!! This is a must have for any Kevin Costner<br />fan!! It has extended scenes and director's commentaries that<br />are not on the original release!!
0060899220|5.0|For a chef, Anthony Bourdain is a pretty damn good writer. His style is smooth and conversational, peppered with lots of smart and subtle pop culture references. This narrative tale is neither cautionary nor told with regret, it is simply the story of a guy who worked hard, played hard, made lots of mistakes, and turned out pretty well in the end. It ends prior to his tv career got started, a fact he shrugs off in his typically blunt manner. In a television interview he was confronted by this and he said simply, \\"Yeah, irony sucks.\\" In the update versions, he addresses and clarifies some of the errors and changes of heart he has had. He acknowledges his excessive bravado and it helps to take that into consideration. I read it to know more about the guy and I was able to balance the personality I see on tv with this younger version and flush out a more complete picture. We all change in life (hopefully, anyway) and it is fascinating to see change in ourselves and others as life batters us and leaves its scars.<br />His character is what drives the story, despite the lurid thrill of the drugs, sex, and restaurant rock and roll that the character imbibes. Bourdain is a straight-forward, humble, opinionated, and somewhat misanthropic guy and his personality is appealing to me, probably because I see much of myself in that description. Moreover, he is clearly thankful for the revelatory experiences his vacation in France as a youngster provided, as well as the subsequent life epiphanies, soul-strengthening meals, and the hard lessons he has learned. He is keenly aware of just how unimportant he is and sees his mission now as an ambassador of pleasure and understanding. That kind of humility is refreshing in an era when celebrity is madly pursued by every idiot with a video cam and a willingness to make an idiot of themselves regardless of who else is scandalized by their single-minded self-destruction.<br />Kitchen Confidential is a breezy, funny, and entertaining read. It brought back memories of my own days working in restaurants and does offer a brutally honest overview of what the culinary world might be for the curious ones seeking career change or a path in life. If, like me, you want to know a bit more about the guy you enjoy on No Reservations, this is a great read.ught back memories of my own days working in restaurants and does offer a brutally honest overview of what the culinary world might be for the curious ones seeking career change or a path in life.

B0011UBDTK|1.0|I needed to return the DVDs.  I only played a few and they were defective.  I don't understand why this product can't be perfected?
B000ZEE3I6|4.0|Because I've been a fan of various stories, and know that a serious effort at including every detail in a two or three hour movie is impossible, I sat back to enjoy HP and the HBP. I wasn't disappointed. But I've read all the books at least five times. My wife hasn't read them, at all. I filled in a few items for her, which worked out, well. One thing that I did appreciate was the humanization of the characters. One minor flaw that should have been avoided was when Dumbledore and Harry disapparated from inside Hogwarts. This is a direct inconsistency in the oft mentioned ban of apparation inside Hogwarts(which was the whole point regarding the cabinets in the Room of Requirement and Borgin and Burkes.) I'll buy the DVD and watch it many times, I'm sure. Now, when are the other two being released?
B000N6TYLW|5.0|These disks were in very good condition- only one spot where one of them froze up...
B0029358GM|5.0|I'm going to keep this short and sweet. If you like Wilco's  for their clever lyrics and inventive music then buy this album. Everyone wants to compare this album to Yankee Hotel Foxtrot or how it would've sounded better if Jay was still around. Every album can't be an exploration, but if the lyrics are good, the music tight and it stays with you, unfold old memories and creates new ones then buy this album, it be cool.
B000ZEE3I6|5.0|Since I have never seen a Harry Potter film before, nor read any of the books, I had to agree with Harry Potter when he said to Albus Dumbledore: \\"...after all these years I just sort of go with it.\\" I have four nieces and they are all followers of the Potter phenomenon. They had t-shirts made with their own Potter references and slogans, and wore them to the midnight show opening. One of them went down to wait in line at 6 PM so that we could all get good seats. She was the most passionate Potterite among them and had been interviewed at past openings by the local news wearing a Hogwarts uniform.<br /><br />So it was that I found myself at a midnight show. The crowd was very excited to see the opening, and I was swept up in the excitement, even though I didn't have a clue about the finer points of the J.K. Rowling story. You could say that it wasn't my bailiwick, and I was eminently unqualified to review this movie, but nevertheless, I came, I saw, and I can't resist weighing in with my two cents..<br /><br />My first observation was that the audience was mostly the same age as the actors playing Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe), Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint), Ginny Weasley (Bonnie Wright), Lavender Brown (Jessie Cave), and Hermione Granger (Emma Watson), so they had been growing up with them, and were kind of in sync. They were ALL young and feeling love's keen sting, as Professor Albus Dumbledore (Michael Gambon) so aptly put it. In fact there was so much snogging going on, it was hard to fit in the horcruxes, Death Eaters, and the Quidditch match. I would not be surprised at all if the climax of the entire series revolves around who took who to the Hogswart prom. In fact, if I am not mistaken, there was some kind of prom or dance in Half-blood Prince, and Harry asked the most unlikely of dates, Luna Lovegood (Evanna Lynch) to attend.<br /><br />While we are on the subject, according to my sister the relationship between Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger was much better established in the book. She had more motivation for liking Ron in the book, but on screen, we're not buying it. Why aren't Harry Potter and Hermione Granger getting together? Actually, Emma Watson is out of BOTH Harry and Ron's league. They are like the chubby fanboy who tried to give Megan Fox the yellow rose and was completely ignored. She is like the girl next door who overnight morphs into a Super Model. Harry does kiss someone in the latest installment, and I would say who, but I don't want to spoil it. The kiss is a big deal, even overshadowing the death of a main character -- again, I won't say who, but we know it's not Harry Potter, although, Harry might feel a little guilt about standing by and not doing anything.<br /><br />Enough, already. I am starting to ramble. The next thing I would like to talk about is the villains. Draco Malvoy (Tom Felton) makes a pretty menacing villain, with his hair so blonde it is almost white. Lord Voldemort is not seen at all, but somehow his presence was felt. Kind of think that this movie is just a set up for the movies to come. The final showdown between Harry and Voldemort. They do have scenes of Voldemort as a boy, Tom Riddle at 11, and he is played by Hero Fiennes-Tiffin. He takes that kind of creepy look that Draco has and raises it to the nth magnitude. Our young anti-hero, Hero Fiennes-Tiffin is related to Ralph Fiennes, who plays Voldemort, but he was not only cast because he resembled his Uncle Ralph, he also had that deep and dark look that hinted of the evil to come...<br /><br />------------------<br />Harry Potter: Did you know, sir? Then?<br />Albus Dumbledore: Did I know that I just met the most dangerous dark wizard of all time? No.<br />===============================<br /><br />Anyway, seeing a Harry Potter movie for the first time, it is easy to see why so many love them. I think the audience may have been split between those who want the films to be exactly like the book, and those who don't mind the film going in a different direction than the book if it could make for a better movie. J.K. Rowling has endorsed the second approach, although she would intervene if the movie veers too far away. For instance, when the script had Dumbledore remembering an episode from his past where he loved a girl, J.K. stepped in and said that could NEVER happen because... well, you'll just have to watch and find out, won't you?<br /><br />There is a third group, and that is my group, the people who don't care if it follows the book or not, because they haven't read the books. Just looking at it as a movie, without any preconceptions, I would say that there are great special effects and art direction. They really create a world and inhabit it with strange creatures that look right at home. I can see that these movies make a lot of money, and they really go all out, pumping the profits back into the products. The Potter movie I saw was really a great example of movie making craft at its finest. I think the fans will like Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, even if the ending is kind of anticlimactic. It is not the final showdown, but just setting the audience up for the battles to come.<br /><br />-------------------<br />Albus Dumbledore: You must be wondering why I brought you here.<br />Harry Potter: Actually sir, after all these years I just sort of go with it.<br />==============================<br /><br />[[ASIN:B000H6SXSI Art School Confidential]] (2006) ....

B001NU1AO6|5.0|i had the honor of seeing this live at madison square garden when this came out. it was with full orchestra and choir. he played six wives of henry the 8th then did this whole album and finished with a compilation of commercial tunes that was amazing with an orchestra. he then did the last 1/4 of the album again for an encore.  the best copy of the is on ORIGINAL MASTER RECORDINGS in gold cd. try and find this copy if you loved this like i did.
B000002IWH|5.0|I recommend this soundtrack young or old(er).  Anyone a fan of this genre of music will not fail to love it.  Personally I love Darkness by Rage most...I go a bit nuts every time I hear this song.  In fact I've had people gather around my ride when this song plays.  It's powerful.
B000068R1X|4.0|After two albums Blizzard Of Ozz and Diary Of A Madman, Ozzy had it all, or so he tought, his guitarist Randy Rhoads died in a plane crash. Following the death of Randy, Ozzy was left in shock after all its hard to believe when it's someone close to you. The thing is that even after the record company gave him some time to mourn Randy, a week after his funeral he was back to doing music. Randy's replacement would be the short-lived Brad Gillis, and despite being good his only work with Ozzy would be 1982's Speak Of The Devil a live album featuring only Black Sabbath material. That's when guitarist Jake E. Lee stepped in. Lee had been around for some time playing in bands like Ratt and others and was given a big chance with Ozzy. In 1983 Bark At The Moon was released, it would be different from the first two due to Randy's death and Jake's arrival.<br /><br />  The album starts with the classic title track, perhaps his creepiest song. This song is one of my favourites in Ozzy's career and probably my favourite on the album too. A dark and heavy track featuring great guitar work by Lee. The video for this song was awesome! You're no different to me follows; it's my favourite song besides the title. Ozzy sounds inspired and it features some superb lyrics. Now You See It (Now You Don't) is a nice rocker with a catchy chorus. Rock N' Roll Rebel is Ozzy addressing the ones who claim he is satanic; \\"they say I worship the devil, they must stupid or blind, I'm just a Rock n' Roll rebel\\". Once again great guitar by Lee and Ozzy delivers his message.<br /><br />  Centre Of Eternity starts with some church chant that sounds very creepy and then kicks into the song. It's fast paced and energetic, one of the best of the album. So Tired reminds me of Goodbye To Romance from Blizzard, it's a decent ballad but not his best it doesn't really mean anything. Slow Down is another favourite, crunchy guitar work, catchy song and the keyboards despite sounding too 80s really add something extra to the song. Waiting For Darkness is a great emotional song, truly an underrated song. Spider is my least favourite song of the album, it just get anywhere and is not nearly as good as the rest of the album. The bonus song One Up The B Side is pretty good for an unreleased song and is worth hearing.<br /><br />  The bad thing on this remaster is that it is not the original album. It is in fact a remix of the album with some things sounding louder or just different, the keyboards in \\"You're No Different To Me\\" are sounding louder than they were on the original is a pretty good example of this. At least this time Ozzy didn't erase band member's contributions as he did for the remaster of his first two albums. It is still not the original, and there's no excuse this time, no court cases or anything at all, he just wanted to remix it. There's a saying that goes \\"If it ain't broken don't fix it\\" and I think Ozzy obviously never heard that one. Try to get the original and not this remaster. A good thing about the remasters however is that you get expended liner notes from Ozzy which are worth reading and really interesting. The fact you get an unreleased song is pretty cool too.<br /><br />  Lee is not remembered as much as Rhoads is, but the albums he did with Ozzy (the other being The Ultimate Sin) proved that he had a lot of talent and that he was the right choice to replace him. Bark At The Moon is another classic album by Ozzy, of course not as good as he first two but still very good. I remember the album mostly for the title track's video in which Ozzy is a werewolf, I think that despite being dated it's one of the best thing he did. Overral it's a solid album worth getting for any Ozzy fan, just try not to get this remaster as it does not match the original.ra to the song.

B00284BMBM|5.0|I've always been a huge Daughtry fan and this album is a great follow up to a solid first album. I was actually blown away by the diversity in this album .. and pleasantly surprised!!     I think this album has something for everyone to love in it and I see quite a few of these songs on their way to the top of the charts. Daughtry fans will be thrilled and I'm sure the group will gain even more support with such a strong album! Every song offers something different and really emphasizes the talent and diversity that these guys possess.     My current favorite is \\"Call Your Name.\\" It starts clean and simple, with Chris Daughtry showing us the range of his amazing vocals. You can really feel the song being like an emotional love story .. as the songs builds you can really feel the emotion pick up towards the end .. and you're just dying for the momentum to really kick in. Perfect way to end a solid album!!     All in all it's a great album! You won't be disappointed!!!!
B000W9EOEC|5.0|This is a great live album, but it makes me wish I were actually at the show. This type of music is really best live. Something friends of mine that loved to hate \\"techno\\" didn't seem to get or care to. The energy level at live performances by the best electronic music acts often dwarfs that of conventional rock concerts and I love rock. This music is just incredible blasting out of a massive sound system. Then there is the visual aspect of Daft Punk's performances.... two guys in space costumes, masked with helmets, perched on top of a pyramid of flashing lights that looks like a ship taking off. The live shows deliver a sensual onslaught that overrides your conscious mind and all your left to do is feel it. I haven't been to a Daft Punk show, but I've experienced live electronic performances by acts like Orbital and I've seen some clips of Daft Punk's shows. This CD comes as close as a CD can to capturing the sound, but now I want to see the rest of the show.
B0020TS5JM|5.0|rented this one....wow...a total suprise gem. on the surface it's the guy-from-space-fights-the-monster...but visuals, acting, and just plain \\"resonance\\" of the film was fantastic.  the ancient norwegian setting is done with total authenticity...no cheesey sci-fi channel vibe...and noted actor James Caviezel in the lead does a completely credible and smouldering job.  take a chance on this one!  it's great!
B000063JDE|5.0|Heineken! [....] Pabst Blue Ribbon! Even psychos can make sense. Best movie of the 1980s? Don't know, there were some good ones. David Lynch's best film? Don't know about that either. In his...top three surely. Lynch's most entertaining movie? Hell yeah.<br /><br />I'm just doing a little customer review because I LOVE this movie. What to say, what to say. *Why* do I love this movie? Because of the performances. Kyle MacLachlan, Laura Dern, Isabella Rossellini, and of course Dennis Hopper are terrific. And I love film noir and surreal, atmospheric films so it is kind of up my alley. The story unfolds at a good pace, the dialog holds your attention. At times it is very funny and very creepy. I am fascinated by explorations and depictions of the underbelly of society, the flip-side to the so-called American Dream. Stuff -art, music, social criticism, historical analysis, novels, films, etc.- that mock or at least question if the American Dream is just a crock in the first place, a delusion, a lie. Criminals and transgression are inherently interesting to most people, to some degree or other, and do make a perfect subject for the movies. We can watch safely in our homes or theater and satisfy our curiosities and get a little thrill like when riding a roller coaster or haunted house ride at an amusement park. The often analyzed/discussed beginning of \\"Blue Velvet\\" is absolutely brilliant. As is often the case with films, the opening scene shows you exactly what the story is about.
B00288KNJU|5.0|Honestly, whether one hates or loves the film, I do not see how this entire package cannot be rated other than a five star Blu. You have a two disc set that contains a 2D, 3D, DVD copy, Dig Copy, an hour of special features in 1080i, Dbox, and the usual mix of BD Live options from Universal.<br /><br />I watched this with my kids both that are under 10, and contrary to what anyone says as a shock tactic, this movie was not a horror flick. It was a great animation film with a solid story that looked outstanding on Blu. Having both copies readily available, I compared several scenes to prove the vibrancy, colors, and clarity were greatly improved with BD, even with it being this type of animation. The 3D version loses the usual color palette, but looked great compared to other 3D out of late.<br /><br />The DTS was mixed eloquently, and more times than not they managed to use all five channels with much more frequency that can be done with a live action film. So after enjoying a fun film (ignore the naysayers here) we spent an hour going over the supplements.<br /><br />The making-of lasts 36 minutes and contains many smaller features that do have the Play All option. After watching the Voicing Of (10:46), the strangely edited deleted scenes (8:47) and the Creepy Coraline (5:30) segment I almost side with splitting between the features that you find the most interesting. The deleted scenes are bizarre in how they edited in the director's facial contortions and the ten 1-2 seconds blips as \\"needing to be cut\\" - whatever. Some great information either way regarding the time it took to make certain sequences. Have not had a chance to utilize the DBOX option or the BD live features for this one. The usual Universe U Control option is available to you if your player is all tuned up for doing the PiP and such.<br /><br />The clarity, colors, sound, supplements, and extra copies all make for a worthwhile product purchase, especially for as low in price as it has gotten in the last week. Enjoy.
B000UPGQQW|5.0|The Lost Boys is a classic. Long before Kiefer Sutherland was torturing terrorists he was fanging teens on the Santa Cruz Boardwalk. The soundtrack is haunting and unforgettable and the script is good enough that it doesn't have to throw in too much blood and gore to keep the viewer on the edge of the seat.<br /><br />FYI: The 'R' rating assigned to Lost Boys is a bit harsh. A PG-13 would be more accurate. I showed it to my pre-teen daughters with no regrets.
B000002B5L|5.0|I heard this album for the first time about 10 years ago, and even then, it had been around for a while.  I'm not a fan of long reviews, but I will say that this is a classic hip-hop album.  You will hear Lauryn, Praz, and Wyclef lay down some of their best tracks.    If you liked either Lauryn or Wyclef's solo albums you should check this album out.  Be warned that while there are some very beautiful songs on this album, it is definitely a rap/hip-hop album and you can expect a lot of interesting beats and rhymes.    I still listen to this album on a regular basis.  Everytime I do it reminds me of the fact that Lauryn has more or less stopped producing music.  A true tragedy, but sometimes life takes people in other directions.  Wyclef still puts out some good music every once and while, but it's hard to imagine an album like this ever happening again.
B000A2RRF4|5.0|I remember seeing this concert on MTV back when he was releasing his HIStory CD. If you want to see one of his best performances before his decline, get this DVD! Its awesome!    Done from Bucharest (which I thought was in Germany but I've been told it is in Romania. Thanks to Flyguy for the information!), Michael Jackson had the people cheering and falling out from start to finish. I have rarely seen an individual who had the crowd screaming by....just standing there! He stood their forever and the folks were going wild. One he got going with the show, the cheers never really let up at all!    He performs some of his best hits up to that point (nothing from the HIStory CD because it wasn't actually out when he did this concert). From \\"Beat It\\", \\"Wanna Be Starting Something\\", \\"I Just Can't Stop Loving You\\", \\"Human Nature\\" and other songs. It ends with his \\"Man In The Mirror\\" song with an ending worthy of MJ!    Your money WILL not be wasted on this DVD! Highly recommended.
B00284BMBM|5.0|I love the new CD. My favorites are You Don't Belong, No Surprise, Call Your Name, Open Up Your Eyes (a real tear jerker), Ghost of Me and September.
1416550534|5.0|a little bit of gothic atmosphere and mystery mixed with touching romance in this story where the strict tradition of the turn of the century meets the roaring twenties. I can't stop from thinking \\"if only, if only\\"-- this breathtaking book will definitely stay with you after you put it down.

B000001FO4|4.0|Out of all the hair metal bands that came out of the 80's, Cinderella was  arguably one of the best. No flashy guitar, like alot of the other hair bands were doing at the time, just honest, bluesy hard rock, reminiscent to Guns and Roses, one of my favorite bands.\\" Long Cold Winter\\", Great album, period.
0833524658|5.0|This book has over 850 ratings, but I thought I'd share my experience with it too!<br /><br />I bought this book when it first came out in the mid-80's and it became a favorite of my son's. We read it weekly for several years. I now have grandchildren and it has become their favorite.<br /><br />It is a simple message about a mother loving her son/child no matter what age, no matter what. This is a timeless message and one that every child should hear daily.<br /><br />Anyone who has ever gotten a baby shower gift or a baby gift from me has received this book along with whatever else was chosen!
0312360266|4.0|If you are looking for a book that is just like \\"Twilight\\" then this is not the book for you. I saw the authors of this series on GMA and thought the books sounded interesting. This story is absolutely nothing like Twilight and you need to know that going into them. If you are wondering if you young teenager should read them, be aware, they are a little sexually explicit. Not horrible or very graphic but may not be something you want your 13 yr old to read.     Good book. A different take on the Vampire word. A few different things about this book: Vampires are not bitten to be changed, they are marked (hence the title of the book). They are rules by a Goddess. It takes the marked ones years to change into an adult vampire.     Worth your time but remember to not expect it to be like Twilight. It is 100% completely different.
0786838655|5.0|As I was bemoaning the coming of an end to the Harry Potter movies, a friend suggested I try the Percy Jackson and the Olympians series. I had never heard of them until yesterday when she lent me The Lightning Thief.<br /><br />Although this book is meant for 9 to 12 year olds, I'm a grandmother and I couldn't put the book down. I started reading it at 9pm and finished at 3am with a few interruptions!<br /><br />Like Harry Potter, Percy has not had an easy time of it in school, but that is one of a few similarities. This series stands strong in its own story of the Olympic Gods and Percy being the son of one. The story is edgy making you wonder what is coming next!<br /><br />There are some themes in the book that may have your kids (depending on their level of in the know) asking questions about why Percy's mom and dad weren't married, why Percy's dad seemingly turned his back on his mother, and more.<br /><br />The book has plenty of discussion points about mythology, bullies, travel, and other recurring themes. But all in all, the story is the attraction and makes for a fast read! I wish I had remembered my mythology a bit better which would have enhanced the background for reading the story, but it is easy to catch on and remember salient points.<br /><br />I can't wait to read the next four books in the series!
0385338732|5.0|I too have read some of the Shopaholic books, but this was a great, light read--I couldn't put it down over a weekend.  Sometimes you need a book that doesn't make you think--just fun and relaxing.  I also laughed out loud in parts of the book--who doesn't need to do that every now and then.  I highly recommend if you are looking for a fun, easy read.
0316017922|4.0|Malcolm Gladwell's latest bestseller addresses success - why some people such as Bill gates rise above the rest to phenomenal success. He terms these people \\"Outliers.\\"<br /><br />The chapters all follow a format which Gladwell likely has likely used frequently in his magazine writing: he begins by telling a story of an interesting individual or group of people, then proceeds to expand upon his example to make his point. The early chapters which address the influence of birth month on the chances of athletic and academic success and his study of Bill Gates are the most interesting. One overly-lengthy chapter concerning a group of immigrants slowed the momentum of the book, as did the author's telling of his own family history. Fortunately, the chapters that are good are really, really good: easy to understand and insightful.<br /><br />Gladwell is one of the few non-fiction writers who can consistently appeal to the masses. There are enough interesting tidbits here to keep his appeal going.
B00133KFGW|1.0|I'm actually quite surprised at how much positive reviews this movie has received!  Granted, over dramatized unrealistic fantasy is a game Hollywood has been playing ever since the motion picture industry was invented, I really felt the makers of this movie ran with it and managed to take it to the next level.  Aside from totally unbelievable yet predictable plot line, this movie seems to forget the reality that any serious musicians come to terms with - music is 10% inspiration and 90% perspiration.  What's more, this movie seems to reinvent the term 'musical prodigy' as some kind of a monster who could play anything he hears in his head w/out any type of training.  I watched this film b/c few people mentioned it to me b/c I'm a guitar player.  I really regret renting it and having to sit through it.  I guess if I weren't a musician, I might have enjoyed it a little more.  But, I was really turned off by this movie b/c it was a total misrepresentation of how real music works.  My high school teacher, who used to be a lawyer, always complained how he couldn't stand the Hollywood courtroom drama scene...I completely understand him...
B000ZEE3I6|3.0|As Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) begins his sixth year at Hogwarts, the forces of the Dark Lord are wreaking havoc on wizard and Muggle Londoners alike.  Headmaster Dumbledore (Michael Gambon) asks Harry to do a mysterious job for him, while Voldemort has apparently given Draco Malfoy a rather unsavory task.  Amid all this gloom and doom, young love has struck at Hogwarts and Harry, Ron, and Hermione are all under its spell.<br /><br />I thought the book was bloated and pointless, so I wasn't surprised that the movie was just as tedious, with way too many characters appearing for just seconds doing incomprehensible things.  The much-touted teen romances seemed perfunctory and awkward (but the young people in the theatre audience seemed to enjoy it a lot).  Even though I read the book, I had no idea what was going on with Harry and Draco's assignments (which seemed to drag on and go nowhere); those who haven't read the book will no doubt be completely lost.<br /><br />The film is way too choppy; most scenes are only seconds long with just  one or two lines of dialogue, then it's off to a completely unrelated scene.  Many much-loved characters (Mr. and Mrs. Weasley, Neville, Hagrid, and a frail-looking Professor McGonagal) are reduced to mere walk-on parts and even the title character, sadly, gets too little screen time.  On the plus side, the star of the show, Michael Gambon finally seems likeable and Bonnie Wright (Ginny) is slightly less wooden than in the past.<br /><br />But if you liked the book, you'll love the movie.

B0028K3192|5.0|What an awesome piece of music. It brings back the oooold days when soul music had soul. Not much, if any music today, has soul. You folks complain about 'only 8 songs', 'get back to the old producer'. BOO FREAKIN' WHOO. You whiners. Why don't you put some music out. Lets' see what you got! This brother comes back with a vengence; to RETURN soul music to what it needs to sound like. New musicians, NEW DIRECTION, but soulful. From go, Maxwell has got your attention. Funky soul. This brother has the greatest musicians in the world (other than Prince). When the other cd's (Summer's-Night) are released, let's continue the debate. Support a brother. Radio sux. Satellite radio sux. Support artist not on the radio.<br /><br />BROOKLYN S T A N D  U P!<br /> Cooper Park, baby<br />  50 Debevoise Ave.
B00005JL7Q|5.0|About a Boy is a really great movie. It's the story of how a shallow man finds that he really does need other people in his life. His relationship with the boy is very touching. While this is classified as a comedy, it is much more than that. It is a very deep and entertaining movie.
B000FC0ZEO|5.0|I loved the Assassin series and the Fool series! I bought them on my kindle so that I was able to finish one and immediately continue on with the story. I was sad that it finally ended, but it was a good ending (even though I cried my eyes out!). This is a great story and I really recommend it to anyone looking for a new series to start.
B00284BMBM|4.0|Leave This Town is a good album. In my mind I don't think it is a great album (5 stars worth) but it is good. Everything referring to this album that I heard prior to the release was that it was going to be a big rock album. So I was expecting that some of his singles could appear on mainstream and modern rock stations (Rev 96.7 and 93 X here in Minnesota)but after listening to the album multiple times through I don't feel that will happen. \\"You Don't Belong,\\" \\"What I Meant To Say,\\" & \\"Ghost Of Me\\" are the only ones I feel that have a chance on rock radio. Besides that Daughtry's singles will be in on top of the Top 40 and Mix Stations no doubt. That is not a bad thing I was just expecting something different with all the hype.    Daughtry's cd is full of songs that allow the listerners to relate and sing along with. My favorites are the more rock oriented ones mentioned above along with \\"Open Up Your Eyes\\" and \\"Tennessee Line.\\" The former is probably the deepest and most impressive song on the CD. It show Chris's emotional side along with the tune \\"September\\" and the instrumentals in those songs flow perfectly with the music. Also growing up loving country music and southern rock, \\"Tennessee Line\\" is a nice treat on the CD. People that aren't the biggest fans of country music might not find \\"Tennessee Line\\" that appealing but it follows the theme of the album well and Chris can pull country music off. (The only thing I would change is maybe have Vince Gill play a bigger roll in that song than just backup vocals.)    On the CD I feel that \\"Supernatural\\" and \\"Call Your Name\\" are the weakest tracks on the CD (meaning I liked them the least). I am not the biggest fan of Daughtry's slow ballads like \\"Call Your Name\\" or \\"What About Now\\" from their first CD. I know they are popular among Daughtry fans but they just don't do it for me. For songs like those I prefer bands like Shinedown, Ra, and other rock bands (usually rock genres that Daughtry is not part of such as HardRock).    So summing it up, Leave This Town is a decently, good sophomore CD for Daughtry. If you are a fan of their first one you will enjoy this one. It is similar to the precesor but at the same time alittle different. Good tunes with deep emotional meaning. Nothing really genre busting but prefect for Daughtry fans. A good addition to Daughtry's discography.
0061122416|5.0|Beautifully written, this book helped me to believe in all things again. I recommend to all, who have a sense of childlike vision in them, because if you foucs on today's demands and  pressure, it would be hard to understand, and apply this book which is written as a fable.
B00011F5DK|5.0|A friend of mine recently raved about this game.  I had contemplated buying it several times and for one reason or another decided not to.<br /><br />Imagine my delight at finding it at my favorite second-hand store for about the price of an ice cream cone! Someone was weeding out their game closet and I was happy to be the lucky person to reap the benefits.<br /><br />I have only played this once but I loved it.  My husband calls me 'Miss. Spacial' and this game is made for all the Miss. and Mr. Spacials out there.  My son (four and a half), my daughter (seven and a half) and I played and my daughter won.<br /><br />My son said it was boring but my daughter really liked it.  It requires a bit of quiet thoughtfulness once you get to the end.  He's not much on quiet thoughtfulness just yet.<br /><br />I think this will be a great game to play with the grandparents.  I'm looking forward to playing again.<br /><br />11/2009: It's still good!

0575083093|3.0|Reynolds has a wonderful and huge imagination, but his characterizations are weak and he has horrible pacing.    In this book, we meet a scientist/politician named Sylveste, and early on, we are told that he has a theory about the extinction of the people of the planet Resurgem.  Everybody on the planet knows the theory, but we, as readers, are kept in the dark.    Similarly, another central character, Khouri, is shown a great deal of information, and again, the reader is kept in the dark.  Later, Khouri confides the information to the third main character, and again, we are kept in the dark.    This unfortunately detaches us from the characters - we cannot understand their actions, nor can we see the story through their eyes, when the omniscient narrator simply leaves stuff out so he can surprise us at the end.

B00005MNP8|4.0|Let's get one thing straight: Blondie is a bit of an uneven band. Their discography is, for the most part, devious, as much as it's pop-inclined and hit-filled. But with Parallel Lines in 1978, they made it big. It's no wonder: \\"Lines\\" is a monster of a record. It's poppy, it's melodic, it's cool, it's punchy and, more importantly, it's femme. The feminine touch that the whip-smart Deborah Harry brings to the band is both unprecedented and unique. Her zombie voice in \\"One Way Or Another\\", her unimpressed looks in \\"Heart Of Glass\\", her mesmerizing posture -- it's all deadly. The duochromatic facade that is this album serves her well to show off her smarts and take the advantage of being in a self-assured, competent band. And as drums thump and guitars drill, Harry talks of love, loss and lust, all with a style of her own.<br /><br />\\"Lines\\" was both a critical and a commercial success and it's simply one of those albums: it's gonna impress you. Not a single throwaway track in sight, the album is a pure gem of the 1970s, but it surpasses the decade completely because it's timeless. Other than being unforgettably catchy, it's also heartfelt, vivid and powerful. Under the glossy surface lies a majestic celebration of emotion. Enchantment, ambivalence, infatuation and passion are just some of the things the band covers. Never stale or limp-wristed, Parallel Lines pushes all the buttons of the listener and is an indisputable call to the dancefloor that no one should miss. Surely, \\"today can last another million years\\", but the album is a rush of emotions, of body and of mind.<br /><br />Don't let the saccharine aftertaste fool you: you're listening to a masterpiece there. Regardless of how you look at it, Parallel Lines is feelgood music. It constantly reassures you that strength will find its way in your life and it will grab you by the throat and enthrall you. Even if you want your rock to be more macho, a little dose of Blondie's estrogen won't hurt. We could dissect each and every song and say why it's a winner, but there's no point. Everyone who's been around for at least two decades has heard these gems. It's your choice: either dismiss it as a slick, easy-on-the-ears work from the punk/new wave era or let it enter your life. After all, it's made to stay there as much as you want it to.ng and say why it's a winner, but there's no point. Everyone who's been around for at least two decades has heard these gems.

B001TODCII|5.0|I'm all for action films and family values.  \\"Taken\\" is about a man trying to rescue his daughter.  I was hesitant about the film because it dealt with kidnapping women for the sex trade.  I don't want any porn (or soft porn) in my life so I try to avoid sex and nudity in films.    The film dealt with the female sex slave trade very discreetly and amazingly there was no tantalizing nudity in the film.  (My wife and I are very happy about this).    The only negative thing about the film is the blasphemy.  When the girl is abducted she uses the famous \\"OMG\\" about 6 times... and the father records the event and listens to it many times.  As a rule I think we should avoid blasphemy, but under the circumstances calling on God seems understandable.    Overall this is probably my current favorite movie and I've seen it about half a dozen times.
1594201927|2.0|I am not an expert in finance but I am an avid reader of history. In that context, I do agree with many of the 1 and 2 star reviewers about this book.     Firstly, the subtitle is a bit presumptuous. This is not a financial history of the world. It is a financial history of the western world and other bits that affect the western world. The treatment of non western economy is given only a passing glance. The chapter on Chimerica is only detailed because of it's impact on American finance.    Secondly, there is an obvious bias that I have seen before with popular attempts at scholarship. There is an underlying thesis. In this book it seems to be that capitalism is good and so all of history is reinterpreted in fulfilment of this thesis. To seriously suggest that WWI was caused by a reaction against globalization simply ignores the nationalist political pressures that were building up in Europe for nearly half a century that only had an incidental connection to trade and finance. Statements like this merely made me wary of any other conclusions.    Thirdly, and probably the biggest sin for a popular work, is that it was unnecessarily wordy and therefore dull. I agree with other reviewers who found that there were large jumps of logic, time and geography which made following the text difficult. Indeed some of the text is reproduced verbatim in the TV series narrative. Having said all that there were still excellent chapters such as the discussion of the Rothchilds.     It would have been better to conclude with a chapter on the Global Financial Crisis as we now know it, but that will probably form another book a few years from now when it is all over.    In brief: wordy mediocre history which is sometimes difficult to read.
B000002MNL|5.0|This is an excellent album, I had to listen to on the Amazon.com samplers before I decided to purchase it.  Great songs to listen for is: The More you ignore me the closer I get, I am hated for loving, now my heart is full and speedway.  I also reccommend for purchase Viva Hate, Your Arsenal, You are the quarry and Years of Refusal by the same artist.  An excellent cover shot too.

1591391105|5.0|Michael Watkins, a professor at the Harvard Business School, provides new managers with a template for success in his book \\"The First 90 Days\\".  Although written for business leaders, it offers actionable, and applicable advice for the military leader too.<br /><br />The broken up into ten focus areas; with each focus area receiving its own subsequent chapter.  Each of the chapters follows a similar analytical framework.  Each chapter begins with a vignette to set the stage for that particular chapter.  Then Watkins delves into the various teaching points of how that particular vignette succeeded or failed.  Many chapters have exercises for the reader to accomplish, as part of a self-evaluation, to help the reader understand how to individually tailor the concepts for you.  Watkins does an excellent job of explaining how the books concepts apply for each of the types in the STaRS business model (Start-up, Turn-around, Realignment, Sustaining-Success).  In conclusion, each of the chapters includes a list of questions that you should ask yourself as you move into your new position.<br /><br />The book's 10 focus areas are: Promote yourself; Accelerate your learning; Match strategy to situation; Secure early wins; Negotiate success; Achieve Alignment; Build your team; Create coalitions; Keep your balance; and Expedite everyone.  The material in the book is what one would find in a college course; but Watkins does an excellent job of writing at a level that could be understood and appreciated by most readers.  {I'll be the first to admit that I was pleasantly surprised.}<br /><br />I found the book to be full of practical advice for the military leader.  I highly recommend it.
B00021R7CG|5.0|A drama about a possible nuclear exchange between the U.S. and the former Soviet Union.  The plot revolves around so called Soviet terrorists who steal a Russian missile and detonate it over Russia from Turkey making the Soviet defense computers think that the Americans and Nato are attacking them.  Martin Landau plays the President who's helicopter crashes after a Russian missile explodes near the capitol.  The only other person in the legal chain of succession is the Secretary of the Interior played perfectly by the late Darrin McGavin, who's insane logic that the U.S. can win a nuclear exchange, makes you hate and pity him for having to make a terrible decision.  The climax is pretty good and the action was pretty good throughout.  Powers Boothe and Rebecca DeMornay also star.

B001CLG6RC|4.0|I've read several of the other reviews on this album, and I have to disagree. I have most of the released albums (and even one of the supposed underground albums) and I have to say I love this album.    As a learning producer and musician.... This album is, from a technical aspect, awesome. And that's unbiased. The arrangement of strings and other classical instruments put to hip hop and club loops is pure audio stimulation. It's subtle and unexpected, and definitely NOT more of the same. My favorite Enigma album is 'Engima 3: Le Roi Est Mort, Vive Le Roi' and this comes in a close, VERY close second.    This album causes you to look a little deeper, and listen a little more. If you're a sound->color synesthesian then you'll get waaaaay more out of this album and norms do.    A must own. Special Edition even more so if you can get it.

B000ZEE3I6|4.0|As is typical and probably necessary in this day and age of film making, the special effects and CGI are characters in and of themselves in this terrific, but oddly unsatisfying sixth installment in the 'Harry Potter' series.  I enjoyed it immensely, particularly the superb direction, editing, cinematography and musical score.  It was a joy watching the youthful actors make that leap from kidhood to near adulthood, and with those physical changes, the growth in their acting skills.  Ron, Hermoine, Ginny and most particularly, that villain in the wings, Draco, owing to the greater emotional demands of their characters created by J. K. Rowling, brought the necessary acting skills to their near-adult roles.  Tom Felton, for a notable example, was so much more than the snarling, spoiled, petulant antagonist he was in the previous five movies--here he was clearly committed to the nefarious task towards which he had been inculcated and now ordered to commit and yet conflicted and afraid.  Kudos to him and to the screenplay for providing him with some cinematic meat to chew on.     One wonders why, however, essential parts of the book were left either on the cutting room floor or out of the script entirely.  As long as we dive with Harry into the 'penseive,' why not let us see the growth of young Tom Riddle as he becomes Lord Voldemort?  Or the history of Severus Snape?  Of course, a book is not a film is not a book, ad infinitum, and decisions must be made to bring a movie to acceptable and budgetary length.  But in this case, less teenage durm and strang about burgeoining sexuality (as much fun as that was to watch and from which some gentle humor was derived) and more on the depth of the major motives in this plot line would have been greately appreciated.    I am not a little distressed about the director's permitting such rapid speech.  It may be British to swallow syllables, but in a film where dialogue is meant to convey character, it seems to me to be fairly essential that the words be clearly enunciated to be clearly understood.  But that is a distraction, not a glaring fault.    In terms of cinema qua cinema, plot exclusions aside, this was a wonderful movie.  The director's eye is unerringly 'spot-on,' as the Brits would say.  For example, there is a brief scene terrific scene in which Harry is seemingly alone in a long hallway, but the camera spots Draco Malfoy (let's head back to Marlowe's 'Faery Queen' for such names: it means 'bad faith) half hidden by a column, watching and listening, unknown to Harry.  The suggestion, of course, is clear that Harry is under hidden threat and potential danger.  We are given a glimpse into potential action that the main character is not.  Moreover, Draco is quite alone, not parenthesized by his duo of sycophantic bullies.  As the movie evinces clearly enough, Draco has uniquely been selected to carry out Voldemort's orders and in these few seconds, the camera suggests his capacity for genuine evil on the one hand and solitude on the other.    So, the kids are grown and are venturing into grown-up worlds of darkness merely presaged by the five earlier stories.  Rowling's wonderful manipulation of her story lines make for a thrilling sixth episode.  You will enjoy the movie, I am sure, but the die-hard Potter fans will want more.  The real key to the film as it was for the novels is the affection we are drawn to feel for the triumvirate of main characters and their fellows.  'Half Blood Prince' continues to encourage those affections by giving the characters more human substance, foible, and inner strength.  They are not witches and wizards, they are the stuff that reality is made of behind the facade of supernatural shananigan and circumstance.      In fine, can 'Deathly Hallows' (both parts!) be all that far away, where, one hopes, the poignant funeral of Albus Dumbledore would be inserted.  At least we won't have to wait as long between first screenings as we did between 'Phoenix' and'Prince.'  Will November 2010 come soon enough?  For most Potter fans, based on this latest filmic endeavor into the non-muggle world, probably not.
B0028DRGDQ|4.0|The award-winning, blockbuster Spanish horror film \\"REC\\" had already been remade for U.S. audiences under the nom de plume \\"Quarantine\\". I have seen both horror films, and I have decided to focus on reviewing the original film rather than comparing the two. Directed by Jaume Balaguero, \\"REC\\" is a film that adapts the first person, POV style shaky camera style that was first adapted by \\"Blair Witch Project\\" and later on also in \\"Cloverfield\\" and even Romero's \\"Diary of the Dead\\". The film has the B-grade movie feel, but the director made it work. After all, what better way to emulate realism with a DV camera than for the movie to look very unpolished and rough around the edges? I'll get right to the point, I enjoyed \\"Quarantine\\" but \\"REC\\" is a lot better.<br /><br />A television reporter named Angela Vidal (sexy Manuela Velasco) and her cameraman, Pablo (Pablo Rosso) is covering a local fire stations in Barcelona for a TV show called \\"While you're Asleep\\". Things seemed very uneventful, Angela is just hanging out with some local firemen, Alex and Manu (Ferrah Terraza) until the station receives a call to an apartment building where screams have been heard. The TV team tags along with the firemen and meets up with local police officers. Once there, they find an old woman seemingly frightened and attacks one of the policemen. Suddenly, Angela, the firemen and all the tenants of the building become trapped inside the building by a Hazmat crew and they have been isolated from the outside world. Things go from bad to worse as things go out of control as the tenants become mysteriously infected that makes them violently feral. Angela and Pablo may not survive the night...<br /><br />\\"REC\\" has the type of plot that is very simple and follows established groundwork for zombie films such as the \\"28 Days Later\\" franchise. A supposed virus that causes violent behavior isn't really original but the film's execution is very strong in generating suspense and claustrophobia. I am not really a big fan of the shaky POV style camera work but director Balaguero does pay attention to the smallest details as to how this style should be executed. There are some gaps in the camerawork, some sound being unrecorded and the camera does take certain shots that make the viewer feel that Pablo is indeed running for his life. When it comes to terror, \\"REC\\" does not disappoint, the camera does feel like it is a significant part of the film rather than a gimmick.<br /><br />The film's style feels very rough and edgy. (Quarantine was polished and beautified) The film looks very simple and stays close to realism. The apartment looks very normal until the lights go off--then we see how the direction takes over in the horrifying sequences. The film is nicely paced and a little short at 79 minutes but I thought this was a clever move. The film is essentially a chase film with Angela, Pablo and Manu running for their lives with no way out, the outside world have no intention of helping for fear of a pandemic. Its short runtime makes the film leaner, more intense and faster-paced to generate the scares that it never lets up. The film has the recommended doses of BLOOD and Gore which are perfectly timed and placed. As for its plot, \\"REC\\" downplays any solid explanations as to the source of the virus until the final act where it gives hints to the cause with a hidden laboratory. \\"REC\\" strongly states that \\"we're not sure what is going on..\\" and yes, any solid answers as to the virus will somewhat remain a mystery and lack solid closure. Is it something demonic or something biological?<br /><br />Much of the film's strength would have to come from the lead characters. The film does have some rather less than impressive characters; an Asian couple, a homosexual super, an intern from a hospital, and much of their developments come from the interviews Angela performs while waiting around. These are your everyday normal folk, people we wouldn't pay attention to when we walk down the street--they look very real and a little silly, much like the folks we see everyday. Manuela Velasco looks, talks and behaves like a reporter; much of her emotions come from a reactionary performance and Velasco certainly pulls it off--the viewer will have no problems feeling sympathy towards her character.<br /><br />\\"REC\\" is the type of horror film that is smart, simple and plays on all its strengths that it manages to make the simplicity of its plot a main part of its direction; along with its rough and edgy claustrophobic atmosphere. While it does have no involving subtext and engaging characters, the film is incredibly tense, that the direction manages to bring about chills and thrills that all its suspense would come from its fast-paced build-up that uses that genuine feeling of helplessness. The final act of the film also serves up the incredible reward as you become privy to one of the freakiest images ever seen on \\" make believe\\" POV camera\\". This Spanish horror film may not be offer anything groundbreaking, but it certainly is solid, competent and entertainingly freaky!<br /><br />Highly Recommended!

B001FBSMF8|4.0|Not the best Cornell album, but a few great songs with a different beat than usual. Listen to it a few times and you will be addicted. Pure genius at vocals. Few artists have had such a long career while still providing a fresh sounds.
B0012GMV58|5.0|This might be a big turn off for the classic rock Santana fans but it's a pure joy for those who like easy going smooth jazz.  Keyboards, flutes, etc.  It's a 70's throwback.<br /><br />Enjoy!
B00284BMBM|5.0|I think this is a wonderful collection of musical talent!  Daughtry is one of the better songwriters in the industry.  I am just as happy with this CD as I was with his debut CD.  I can't wait to hear these songs live when Daughtry goes on tour.
0765318741|4.0|Richard Matheson's horror novella, \\"I Am Legend\\" is a finely crafted novel which mixes vampire horror, survivalist end-of-the-world themes, and questions of morality in a world turned upside down.  Will Smith's pretentious, overblown film version completely missed the point of this beautifully written and generally frightening novella.  Both Vincent Price's \\"The Last Man on Earth\\" and Charleton Heston's \\"The Omega Man\\" were far closer to this book in both story and tone.  The protagonist, Robert Neville, is the only survivor of a plague that either kills its victims, or turns them into a flesh-eaten vampires.  When Neville begins to kill the vampires in his quest to stay alive and find a cure, he fails to understand the depth of their remaining humanity, and therefore he becomes the monster, he becomes the legend of their nightmares.  This is the point that the Will Smith version completely missed.  Read the book and then see Price's and Heston's films.  You decide which is best.
0345349571|2.0|While the subject matter is interesting, the author buries it in unimportant details.  I read a few other reviews and the terms, bore, slog and fight through are appropriate in reference to reading this tome.  A good editor would have culled this book down significantly to let a great story shine.
B000W91RUG|5.0|This show is amazing!  I can't stop laughing when I watch.  I can watch these episodes over and over.
B00288KNLS|5.0|It is sad to see reviews giving this amazing and wonderful movie only a single star when it is truly a five star masterpiece. This is exactly how a Neil Gaiman story should be brought to life on screen. Magic is created when the right elements are brought together. When those elements are Neil Gaiman's imagination, Henry Selick's vision and French composer Bruno Coulais' score you are transported into a wild and wonderful place that is the world of Coraline. I saw it in 3D and I was blow away. I also loved the music so much that I was even downloading the soundtrack to my iPhone during the movie. The story was very exciting and kept me entertained the entire time. I can not wait to own this on DVD and hopefully someday we will be able to experience the awesome Real-D 3D technology at home.
B001GQSY5K|1.0|This product was labeled as nearly new and it didn't even work.  It played for about 20 minutes and then skipped and then stopped working completely.  I had to go to Wal-Mart and get a new one.  I think that if you are labeling something as nearly new then that is what the customer should be getting.  I have always bought from amazon and was completely disappointed in this product.
B001QBC4AG|5.0|\\"The Who Sell Out\\" is one among several Who master pieces. With its build up as a commercial radio station program with commercials in between the songs and overall great songwriting, the album may very well be the most varied and most entertaining Who album.<br />1967 was a year of psychedelia in rock music and the Who were among the pioneers of that trend. This is obvious from the first track of the album \\"Armenia in the Sky\\". The outstanding single \\"I Can See For Miles\\" is among the very best psychelia songs recorded.<br />The acoustic \\"Mary Anne With the Shaky Hand\\" is another Who favourite - beautiful melody, great rhythm and intelligent lyrics. Actually the lyrics are overall great on this album - with wit and homour. Songs like \\"Odorono\\" and \\"Tattoo\\" are rarely included on Who compilations - and they're both bound to be great positive surprises to the first-time listener of the album.<br />\\"Our Love Was\\" and \\"I Can't Reach\\" are other fine tracks - both more in the style of their previous album \\"A Quick One\\". It might be expected that the short commercials ( most of them musically done ) would be annoying after the first couple listens - but this is really not the case. These short tracks works great in the context of the album.<br />Only the final two tracks of the original album seem a little out of place. Townshend's acoustic \\"Sunrise\\" is quite beautiful, but \\"Rael\\" feels somewhat longwinded and dated.<br /><br />This deluxe version of the album has both the stereo and the mono versions. Moreover it includes a long line of great additional tracks - singles, outtakes and alternate versions.<br /><br />Standouts are John Entwhistle's \\"Someone's Coming\\", which was intended for the album, but ended up on the B-side of \\"I Can See For Miles\\".<br /><br />Keith Moon's melodic \\"Girl's Eyes\\" is great song that ought have been included in the first place. The song was probably never given a final finish, but is still quite nice as it is here - the \\"Hello\\" from the first CD re-release somehow is missing here.<br /><br />Both alternate versions of \\"Mary Anne With the Shaky Hand\\" are fine - such a great song.<br /><br />Of other very interesting bonus-tracks there is a studio-version of the live favourite \\"Summertime Blues\\"- though this version does not have the magic of the \\"Live at Leeds\\" version.<br /><br />A lot of interesting back-ground information on the 28 page booklet.here.    Both alternate versions of \\"Mary Anne With the Shaky Hand\\" are fine - such a great song.     Of other very interesting bonus-tracks there is a studio-version of the live favourite \\"Summertime Blues\\"- though this version does not have the magic of the \\"Live at Leeds\\" version.

B0012GMXSS|5.0|I was a kid when grunge became popular and didn't listen to much music. It wasn't until Marilyn Manson became big with \\"The Beautiful People\\" when I was twelve that I liked that kind of music. Sure enough I would eventualy find grunge and start listening to bands like Soundgarden and Alice in Chains. For years I listened to this unaware of the greatness that was right under my nose. When I discovered Screaming Trees it was refreshing to hear something new but still great. During a time when Nirvana hit it big following the footsteps of great bands like Soundgarden and Screaming Trees people were looking for more energy and angst. Screaming Trees were on the other hand more mellow and focused more on song writing. Their music went over many peoples heads who were looking for dirty whiners because the media told them it was \\"cool\\". Not to get me wrong Nirvana made some good music but were very overated, and not to mention overplayed even to this day. This is why I can't listen to them anymore. Anyone who's sick to death of hearing \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\" check out Sweet Oblivion for a change of pace. Every track is filled with great song writing backed up by the second best grunge vocalist of all time.
B0029LHWJK|1.0|When I began reading this, I detected a leftist bias and lack of scholarship. I checked the authors bio when I got fed up with his slant and assumptions and I wasn't surprised to see that he is a journalism professor at Cal-Berkley. Pass on this if you want an objective view of Belgian colonialism in the Congo.
0340820462|5.0|This book, in its hardback form, already has enough excellent reviews to attest to its worth and readability. What I want to add is that for me it has been the inspiration to write. I cannot account for this; I wasn't looking for this or expecting it. Somehow the muse, through this enjoyable and instructive book, has prodded me. I am grateful. Thankyou Stephen King for this and, who could forget, for all the wonderful entertainment over the years.<br />Maybe one day when I actually publish I'll edit this review and let you know.<br />So, once again, thanks Stephen King.
B001GKJ2DY|4.0|Admit it -- somewhere in the darkest and most guarded place in your hearts, you like ABBA. Maybe just a little bit, but you do. The Swedish group's music was a perfect complement to the 1970s disco era -- mindless, pleasure-oriented, saccharine and highly melodic. \\"Mamma Mia\\" stitches together ABBA's greatest hit (and a few more) into a fun and sometimes funny musical experience. The plot is silly and contrived -- a hippy girl's daughter is getting married and wants to invite her Dad to the nuptials. The singing -- done by the principals themselves, including Meryl Streep -- is mostly good, with the exception of poor Pierce Brosnan's forced efforts at song. The ABBA tunes more or less, kind of, almost fit the action. But the star of the movie, as far as I was concerned, was the terrific movement and lighting -- dancing, running, leaping glory bathed in Mediterranean light and Greek aesthetic. Cute story, fine music, but a delight for the eyes.
B001HN697M|4.0|This product was labeled nearly new and it met to the highest of standards.  This product is keeping in line with everything I have ever bought from amazon.
0956031609|5.0|I absolutely loved this book.  Although the end left something to be desired, it left enough that you can hope.  The two characters struggle with their feeling for each other with the back drop of apartheid Africa and the beliefs of their own culture.    I cant wait to see the movie!!!  I recommend \\"I can't Think Straight\\" by the same author.
B000003TA4|3.0|When I was younger I used to listen to this album quite a bit. It's good despite the fact that the songs have been played to death. The only reason this album did so well is because the media blew it out of proportion. Soundarden and Alice in Chains had more talent. Chris Cornell is arguably the greatest vocalist of all the grunge bands and just about every song on Facelift could have been a single. Whereas Nevermind had a few great songs a few decent songs and some filler. I would have givin Nirvana 4 stars if they weren't so overrated. Some people just listen to music to fit in.
B00133KFGW|4.0|On the face of it, the story is contrived and tired. The orphan seeking his family plot is older than Oliver Twist. The idea that even a savant could master both musical notation and organ performance in a day is clearly beyond absurd. But there is a sweetness to this film that transcends the obvious story flaws. And for those of us that are musicians, it captures the some of the magical effect that music can hold for the performer/listener. The performances, both acting and musical, are excellent...especially Jonathan Rhys Meyers, who is as gifted in real life as the main character. Turn off your left brain and let the music entrance you.
0307346617|4.0|Supposedly written after the devastating Zombie Wars, this oral chronicle of the conflict offers perspectives from all over the world. Starting with the outbreak of a mysterious new disease in China, the book's interviews range all over the globe, watching the disease spread and nations attempt to grapple with its consequences. Set more or less in the present, the book shows nations dealing with the disease from their own cultural parameters. China is anxious to cover up the story, while the South Africans go to evil (if effective) lengths to curtail it. The plot unfolds slowly through these interviews and mostly holds together. There are points in the narrative when I felt the sense of despair that would have gripped inhabitants of the world beset by endless waves of mindless predators that could be dispatched only with medieval barbarity. The image of drowned zombies following ship anchors out of the surf was terrifying.<br /><br />The book's faults are few. The \\"interviews\\" are really long essays with a few questions thrown in after the fact. National character is little more than caricature. The interviews are written almost in the same narrative voice. Yet in spite of its shortcomings, \\"World War Z\\" was a fun read, in a genre I don't normally experience.
B0029358HG|3.0|This cd is interesting, but maybe a bit too plain instead of the very cool experimental albums that they have been putting out. The first song is very catchy, but singing a song about how Wilco is going to save you is a bit corny. It is kind of like stating that you are cool to everyone in the room. One of my favorite songs is \\"You and I\\" featuring Feist. I guess I am jonesing for a new Wilco album that doesn't feel like it is creeping into the adult contemporary genre.
0517548232|4.0|Henry Hazlett was a journalist and economist active during the heyday of Keynesian economics, roughly from the Roosevelt to Carter years. Hazlett was a classical liberal who railed continually against the reigning ideology of massive state intervention. Hazlett wrote Economics in One lesson in 1946, and was a weekly columnist for Newsweek for the next two decades. He wrote many books, but Economics in One Lesson has been the most popular, and is a real classic. Hazlett palled around with all the free-market gurus, including Hayek and von Mises, but he wrote in a simple and engaging style that was unknown in the Austrian school of economics.<br /><br />Hazlett's `one lesson' is actually one sentence: \\"The art of economics consists in looking not merely at the immediate but at the longer effects of any act or policy; it consist in tracing the consequences of that policy not merely for one group but for all groups.\\" (p. 17) The book consists of applying this principle to 25 areas of economic policy. Several of these areas involve correcting very common economic fallacies, including the introduction of labor-saving machinery, tariff protectionism, saving inefficient industries, and government price-fixing.<br /><br />Some of his applications, however, seem less clear-cut. Several chapters deal with a critique of Keynesian aggregate demand policies. While such a critique might be in order, Hazlett never addresses the problem of underutilized resources and the role of Keynesian policies in restoring full employment. This may be because the free-market analysis of the business cycle and depression cannot be handled by Hazlett's single principle. I believe he should have added that the market tends to full employment unless impeded by government interference and widespread anti-competitive collusion.<br /><br />Others of his applications do consider the long-term costs of interventions, such as rent control and minimum wage laws, but does not seriously engage the reader in balancing the costs and benefits. My own reading of the matter is that rent control has disastrous long-term consequences for a community but might be salutary for a short period of time while other measures to deal with the inequities of the housing market are put into place, but minimum wage laws have no long-term deleterious effects, except of course the possibility of entailing higher unemployment rates among the unskilled.<br /><br />If you read the financial pages of the Wall Street Journal or The Economist, this book may not tell you anything you don't already know. But you might recommend it to your uniformed Uncle Ernie, or to your children who never get beyond the sports pages of the local newspaper. Tell them to take it all with a grain of salt, though; there's more to economics than this volume dreams of.benefits.

B00284BMBM|2.0|I love Daughtry.  Really I do.  The first album was a little insipid and uninspired to say the least.  But he can sing and had to pay his dues with that first album.  Thought he would have done that by the second album but apparently not. If you own the first catchy album, then really  you own the second.  My fiance was singing along to it but he was singing the first album.  Didn't even realize.  If you can borrow it from a friend please do so and save your money for the album we've been waiting for, the album we all know he is capable of.

B00003CXPJ|3.0|The Bottom Line:    Zoolander is somehow considered something of a \\"classic\\" comedy when in fact it's a slight, inoffensively bland piece of filmmaking that offers up the occasional chuckle alongside long periods of blah; the title character is funny enough but Will Ferrell's villain is stupid and the movie never really gets you rolling in the aisles, let alone keep you there.    2.5/4
B001QTXM5Y|5.0|I can not wait to get the director's cut to see the rest of this epic movie. I was blown away by everything in this film. The acting, directing and score was top notch. This is Snyder's Godfather. I have one problem with the ending, no not the giant squid, that was stupid even back in the 80s, but the line \\"It never ends.\\" should have been done like in the book since it really makes little sense in the movie. Still, that is my only complaint in a three hour film.
B000050FEN|5.0|Although I admire and respect both Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt, Kevin Spacey is the real star of this movie.  He wasn't as well known when this movie was made but I wish he'd had a bigger part.  I was mesmerized by him.  As for the movie itself, it holds your interest from the very first scene and stays with you long after the credits have run.  I highly recommend it, especially if you liked Silence of the Lambs.

His delight at singing for this crowd and his humility come through clearly.  It isn't often that you have a chance to see a great human being this close while hearing the poetry from his heart. His songs allow you to intimately relate to him and to our own deeper nature, to our own true nature.  If you enjoy Leonard's music this DVD adds an extra dimension, don't pass it up.  The band is exceptional too and seeing them perform just adds frost to snow.
044024367X|4.0|After reading the novel (which I found reasonably entertaining) I decided to peruse other Child entries when I discovered two oddities about \\"Nothing to Lose\\":  1. the dismally low customer rating and   2. the sheer number of customer reviews (372 - 154 of them one star) compared with Child's other novels (next highest: \\"Killing Floor\\" with 207)    What happened?   Skim the one star reviews and enjoy as certain readers object to:  o \\"Reacher's...criticism of the war\\"  o \\"Child [espousing] his anti-Iraq War, anti-administration views\\"  o \\"[an] anti-military left wing rant\\"  o \\"[his] crusade against conservative Protestants and American military efforts of the past sixty years\\"  o \\"[a book that is] Anti-Christian, Anti-War and Anti-American\\"  o \\"[an] old, tiresome target-- the mythical right-wing preacher...Instead of depicting those villains who really want to strike at the heart of our country--Islamic militants\\"    ...and so on.  One reader's attitude sums most of them up:   o \\"Keep you [sic] political viewpoints to yourself, and just entertain us.\\"    Test yourself.  Do you find the following passages \\"offensive\\" or problematic?  o \\"We're all atheists.  You don't believe in Zeus or Thor or Neptune or Augustus Caesar or Mars or Venus or Sun Ra.  You reject a thousand gods.  Why should it bother you if someone else rejects a thousand and one?\\" (412)  o \\"...duty is a transaction...It's a two-way street.  We owe them, they owe us.  And what they owe us is a solemn promise to risk our lives and limbs if and only if there's a damn good reason...And that's all gone now.\\" (460)    If your hackles haven't been raised, than you might enjoy what else the book offers:  1. Action begins early.   2. Crisply written action sequences (highlights: Reacher trapped by two patrol cars and a six-on-one bar fight).  3. Some great tough-guy dialogue.  4. Decent mysteries: a death in the desert, an aggressively secretive small town, nighttime flights, unusual military facility, strange illnesses  5. A hard-to-pin-down antagonist (who even pulls one over on Reacher)  6. Topical issues: domestic terrorism, religious fundamentalism, VA hospital problems, disillusioned soldiers
B001GKJ2DO|5.0|This movie just makes me happy - the music is wonderful, the cast is great and the storyline is fun.  I don't have to have, nor do I often want, a highbrow experience in film.  I want an escape, I want entertainment and I want to relax.  This movie fits every bill.  And as for the pans on Pierce Brosnan's voice, I think it fits his character.  He isn't a smooth and polished vocalist, true, but he sounds like most people do.  Honestly he sounded better than I expected.  Meryl Streep just blew me away with her voice and her athletic performance. Sophie was marvelous!<br /><br />I rarely see a movie more than once but I saw this one five times in the theater and bought the special edition the day it came out.  I also have given several copies as gifts.  My daughters were delighted! I LOVE THIS MOVIE!
B0029LHWJK|5.0|Finally a book that tells the truth about the forgotten Congo.  For anyone planning to travel or live in Congo, this book will help you understand it's tragic history and therefore it's present day people.  Even if you don't plan to travel there, it is a compelling read, a tale of what happens when a majority close their eyes and ears to the truth.  This is a tragic, mesmerising and yet ultimately victorious tale. A must read.
B000003Z6I|3.0|I don't quite understand this Nick Cave album.  You can hear some vocal melodies similar to the kind of weird stuff the Talking Heads were doing in the late 70's combined with freak out Alice Cooper-like choruses.  Supposed to be a post-punk album, but feels more like a sloppy heavy metal one.  I don't know if I can recommend something that's barely in tune, much less melodic.  This is just.... weird, but not in a good way.
B00204AA0O|5.0|Listening to the previous works of Regina Spektor (\\"Soviet Kitsch\\" and \\"Begin to hope\\") was still wondering how this girl is gonna melt together all those catchy melodies (i.e. \\"Us\\", \\"Hotel Song\\" or \\"D&uuml;seldorf\\") with all that sadness and nostalgia that she's also able to display, apparently without any effort (\\"Carbon Monoxide\\", \\"Somedays\\", \\"Lady\\" and the beautiful \\"Summer in the City\\"). \\"Fidelity\\" is probably the best example of how she can be both sad and catchy at the same time. But also and more important than that, \\"Fidelity\\" is the perfect prelude for \\"Far\\".<br />From the very begining of this album we know that this is the best Regina so far. \\"Eet\\" is amazingly sad and, at the same time, hopefull, as if she had found the perfect amount of tears and laughter and then she'd put them together in one song. Nevertheless, this brief line between sad and catchy is totally demolished in \\"Laughing With\\", without a doubt one of the best songs of the new century and an image of how the New Age (religiously speaking) has been totally overpassed and we are confronting a really New Time of Renewed Christianism, the way Slavoj Zizek presented it in his book \\"The Fragil Absolute\\". The christian side of Regina's songs is evidently showed in tracks like \\"Human of the year\\" or \\"One more time with feeling\\". But, still, she's also funny and sarcastic as she can be in songs like \\"The calculation\\", \\"Folding chair\\" (in wich, by the way, as in the Bible, \\"the sea is just a watered version of the skies\\") and \\"Dance anthem of the 80's\\".<br />This album will finally define Regina's place in today's music. For those who insist in comparing Regina's work with, say, Fiona Apple's, \\"Far\\" will definitely make the difference and give Regine the credit she's been working for to get.
B000P0J09C|4.0|I like this movie but as a \\"former serving Marine\\"I have a prejudice in this direction and I can fill in some of the things Stanley Kubrick missed or blew by.Except for the broadly played Colonel that chews out Pvt.Joker (Matthew Modine)as the Marines are entering Hue, the cast is very good and Lee Ermey as a former D.I. himself,is outstanding as Sgt.Hartman.This movie definitely deserves the R rating it has.I enjoyed this picture a lot but some Marine buddies I know hate it! You will have to make up your own mind.
0061767581|5.0|As soon as I got the book I started reading it and couldn't put it down. I love Lauren Conrad and \\"The Hills\\" show. Although now that she has left the show I do not watch it anymore. The the rest of the cast are just stupid and is plain to see that the show is made up. I mean come on Heidi and Spencer had all this drama and they still got married. It's all just for the money. I only watched it because Lauren was on it. Any hoot the book is Great. It is a Great summer read. Trust me if you like the show when Lauren was on it you will enjoy reading her book. I hope she writes other books in the near future. She did a Great job.
B00000I8DY|2.0|This is an exciting performance of Cosi fan Tutte but what a pity a harpsichord wasn't used instead of a piano though. A harpsichord represents classical grace. That is the prblem with 'the museum mentality' so common today when it comes to classical music. I enjoy baroque music played on museum instruments because the style lends intself to historic performance. However, it spoils it when certain instruments are played because the focus is on history rather than grace and beauty of sound.     Not only is the piano used but it sounds like a rather tired thin sounding old instrument that once stood in the corner of a bar or pub! It is a shame because it ruins an otherwise charming set (albeit a museum rendition).
B001AVEJ1Y|1.0|I guess Star Trek is finally over. This movie is action and no real story. Great special effects, and nothing to go with it.<br /><br />It destroys the actual Star Trek story line, and leaves nothing to look forward to. I don't think Rodenberry or Majel Barret would have approved.<br /><br />One star is the lowest rating I can give it, but subtract 100 from that, and you get the idea.

B00004ZAV3|5.0|There are many Beatles Cds and packages and repackages out there.  This one is nice to have since it has all the Number One hits in order.  I liked the \\"newer albums\\" they did and have a couple of those, but actually did not have some of these songs, so it was nice.    The remastered versions of the songs I know are great, and to have all these songs on one CD makes for a good start to finish overview of the Beatles and how they changed.    Liked it and worth it.

B0028T6XXY|3.0|I was pleasantly surprised by this product. I am lukewarm on Michael Buble myself, but I bought this for my wife. Considering the size of the venue, Buble fills it very nicely with his music and personality. He is in fine voice, and he interacts very nicely with the audience. I often find \\"behind-the scenes\\" footage in a concert DVD superfluous and distracting, but this production coordinated the off-concert scenes very nicely, giving insight into Buble's personality and personal background. My overall take is that Buble's fans will love this product, and even mild fans like me will find it entertaining.

0434370428|3.0|UPDATE: AP news reports they are re-releasing this book in October!  So I wouldn't spend the outrageous $$$$ if you can wait a few months...<br />----------------------------<br />I found this online in text form, so I haven't seen the photos.  However I read through the book in a few hours, and while I found it interesting, I didn't learn much that I hadn't already heard in Michael's interviews and documentaries about him.  Often when you feel like he is getting close to really talking about himself, he backs off and continues with more of a play by play timeline of the major events in the formation of the Jackson 5 through making Thriller.  I found it interesting that he doesn't even mention his skin disease, which considering how much acne upset him, you think would have had a major effect on him, especially by the end of the book which is where they are creating Bad.<br /><br />Considering the price people are asking for this book now that he has passed away, I would probably just look for the word version online, as the book really doesn't give you any deep insight into the person.  It does however confirm that he was a kind, hard working person, and it is so sad to know that his life went downhill in the time following the book.  I truly hope that he is in a much happier place now, and I'm grateful for what he was able to give this world before he left it.
0385341008|1.0|I wanted to read this book because it was listed as among those that Fannie Flagg readers had bought and because it had such good reviews. This book was nothing like any of Fannie Flagg's books. I really wanted to like it and kept waiting to 'get' it, but I never did and stopped reading about half way through. It was just very boring to me.
1416914307|5.0|The City of Glass was, I think, a fitting ending to this trilogy and I thoroughly enjoyed it.  The plot has as many subplots as a plant root and you feel sorry for one or two of the characters mainly because of the stereotyping that is attached to them.  All is well that ends well though as all subplots are woven together into the main storyline and a happy ending, of a sort, happens for all concerned.

B0011NVC9I|1.0|Thank goodness I didn't pay to see this turkey. I admit I never read the poem, now I wouldn't get near it. I hated the half real, half animation, made all the characters dead behind the eyes. It was obvious there were actors acting (OVER-acting really,basically chewing the scenery!!!) and their images CGI'd. Why? They were ugly, waaaay too many closeups. I wondered who directed this mess, saw it was Bob Zemeckis, who gave us Forrest Gump and the Back To The Future trilogy and others. Shame on him!  After the opening graphic carnage, had no desire to see anything but the ending to check the music on the ending titles.
0515141429|4.0|Margrave, Georgia, was the perfect place for Jack Reacher to wind up in when he left the Greyhound bus before it reached Atlanta.  Perfect houses, perfect landscaping, perfect road paving, perfect sidewalks, perfect stores.  Except that nobody ever seemed to be shopping in any of the stores.  And almost nobody was ever eating in the restaurant.  The town even has a perfect police station as Jack finds when he is arrested for murder after only being in the town for several hours.  Reacher is one of those true vagabonds of the road; no car, no ID, no luggage, no family, no job, no good reason to be where he is.  All of which is extremely suspicious to the police when they have their first homicide in 30 years take place and he is the only stranger in town.<br /><br />This is my first time reading any of the Jack Reacher series by Lee Child and I thoroughly enjoyed it.  That phrase \\"I couldn't put it down\\" is such a cliche that I always hesitate to use it, but in this instance nothing else will do.  I actually resented having to stop reading the book in order to attend a party, I would have liked to just stay home and read.  I found the book to be very fast paced and exceedingly interesting.  This author began to stip away one layer after another to show just how imperfect this little off-the-beaten-track town was.  The relationships which Reacher formed with Roscoe (a female officer) and Findlay (the Chief of Detectives) were very believable especially given that so many things were happening so quickly that instant decisions had to be made about who to trust.<br /><br />\\"Killing Floor\\", published in 1997, is jam packed with action from beginning to end.  It also has some gruesome descriptions of killings which took place so, if that bothers you, this book would definitely not be to your liking.  I found that the level of brutality was necessary to underscore just how \\"bad\\" these bad guys truly were.  The background information regarding Reacher's childhood was also of interest to me since I also am an Army brat and his childhood mirrored my own very closely. Another coincidence which was interesting is that I know that particular area of Georgia very well.  Both of those things added to the atmosphere of authenticity of this book and made me feel as if this author was telling me his story directly.  I look for that feeling when I am reading and I'm hoping the remainder of the Jack Reacher series will live up to this exciting beginning.f interest to me since I also am an Army brat and his childhood mirrored my own very closely.

B0028K31CE|4.0|Lovely CD. There is definitely some baby making music on here. \\"Softly\\" is my favorite but you may miss it on the regular CD. Either you love him or you don't (PERIOD). The instrumentals and vocals are what we truly miss with R & B these days. I appreciate Maxwell's effort to try to be as authenic as possible. If you are trying to make the music relate to the sound of everyone elses music then your review does not really matter much.
0805211063|3.0|There is something to be said about completed books. For one they've gone through an extensive revisions (the good ones) to trim the excess and entice the reader with premise and story.<br /><br />Kafka never finished The Castle. He never fully edited the piece either. One is often thrown into endless and sometimes unnecessary monologues where a character frequently repeats the same message. I felt as if Kafka said much in this book about nothing.<br /><br />K, the protagonist, arrives in a village with the task of performing some land surveying work. Except he finds out that there is a lot of bureaucracy he has to overcome before starting. And while he looks for a way to connect with whomever supposedly contracted him for the job, he sinks deeper and deeper into the world of `red tape,' so much so that he begins to question whether he really was hired in the first place.<br /><br />Along the way, K. meets various characters, more or less drawn from the author's real life experiences, and with whom he embarks on lengthy discussions about life,  love, intrigue, work, and the forces (or people) that influence the outcomes of each.<br /><br />After a while, I grew to despise the village, its inhabitants and a to a degree K who exhibited an extraordinary talent for attracting unpleasant characters. Page after page, I labored over fairly pointless conversations between K. and a landlady, between K. and the sister of a messenger, between K. and the messenger, between K. and the landlady again. Conversations about who behaved how, for how long and why, about who controlled whom, in what way and for what purpose.<br /><br />It is true, Kafka enjoyed writing about situations. In Metamorphosis, he examined the reactions of an individual who woke up one morning transformed into a large beetle.  What occurred next convinced me of Kafka exceptional talent as a writer. But in The Castle, I was disappointed and I think it is not because of the writing style, but because of the lack on interesting story. Kafka gave up finishing the piece for a reason. He stopped, because he exhausted his interest in the paradox K. found himself. And now that I consider this, I completely agree with Kafka's decision. Anyone who has ever worked for any type of business in America (or anywhere in the world for that matter) knows the painful and very unpleasant situations one is faced when dealing with bureaucracy and unreasonable supervisors.<br /><br />The only reason I give 3 stars here is because of the overall story. Kafka's writing will always be a 5 for me, but if he had made an effort to make a catchy story, I'd rate it 5.<br /><br />I recommend Metamorphosis and The Trial instead.k on interesting story.

B0018B1O7I|1.0|I bought this album thinking it had the original long version of \\"Light My Fire\\" which it says it has. The real original version, remixed or not, is much longer than 3 minutes. That's maybe the version given to AM radio stations back in the 60's because the album version was too long for airplay? I had to buy the version off the box set which also says it's the \\"album version\\" but is over 7 minutes long. So, there are two \\"original\\" album versions of the song so be careful you buy what you expect.
B001GCUNYO|1.0|I am amazed that adult people found this film to be even mildly satisfying or enjoyable.  To do that you would have to completely suspend all common sense and belief in reality.      This is quite simply a comic book superhero disguised as a human being.  Liam Neeson is better than this and I'm frankly surprised he accepted this absurd role.      C'mon folks, look at the film for what it tries to tell you.  This guy travels to Paris and within minutes finds his daughter's first contact.  He then miraculously walks right in on the bad guy's lair and proceeds to shoot them all without a scratch on himself.    He then plays tough guy with these elite movers and shakers of the slave trade and manages to shoot them too, while jumping onto their boat off of a bridge.    PLEASE!!!  This is nothing but comic book fluff.  If I wanted that I could simply watch Saturday morning cartoons.
B00127RAJY|3.0|I would have given this exercise workout 5 stars were it not for the terrible DVD production. My reasons on the downgrade: [(1) You can't fast forward to where the exercise workout actually begins--you waste quite a few minutes for that to run through itself; [2] you can't hit \\"Top Menu\\" on the remote to get to the workout immediately; [3] the editing job was pretty bad--even if you are in sync with timing, when the on-screen scene changes, the people are not doing what you are doing; and (4) the music leaves a LOT to be desired, and doesn't match the rhythm of the exercising].    The workout in general is very good, and I like Jillian's no-nonsense approach (the same as her demeanor on the TV show, although perhaps not as forceful, but still effective). I liked the fact that I could actually see the other 2 women (the harder way and the modified method) at the same time. I am in my sixties, and found the first 2 workouts to be good, but definitely not hard or particularly  challenging. I don't even sweat for workout #1 on a 96-degree day. (I have  exercised daily for years, using many exercise videos and traditional forms of exercise, plus working out at a gym.) But I did like workout #3--that got me sweating. I rotate the workouts (a suggestion other reviewers have recommended).
B001HPP2XW|4.0|After reviewing Truman Capote's beautifully-wrought novella \\"Breakfast at Tiffany's\\" for Amazon, I watched the 1961 movie version with Audrey Hepburn playing Holly Golightly. I remembered the movie with great affection, but this time I found it to have too much of the old Hollywood touch to it. In the book the writer-neighbor, the narrator, is a rather androgynous character, more like Capote himself, who is merely Holly's friend. In the flick he's turned into a testosterone-packed heterosexual gigolo, played by George Peppard.<br /> Parts of the film have a phoniness that comes from an overreaching desire to capture Holly's eccentricity, the magnetic oddity she is in the book. Audrey Hepburn's conception of and portrayal of Holly I think is right on the mark, but it's some of the people around her who don't make it. The manic apartment party seems very phony, and full of slapstick that falls flat. Hepburn is beautiful enough and talented enough to strike the right note as a free spirit, a wild thing, just as in the book.<br /> But the film was not true to the book in tacking on a traditional Hollywood happy ending--an example of Hollywood not trusting the instincts of the public. By changing the ending, the moguls also altered the basic character of Holly. Since 1961 audiences have grown up a great deal, become more attuned to subtle nuances, and I think Capote's ending would be more appropriate for today's viewers.<br />Buddy Ebsen is fine as Holly's ex-husband who married her when she was fourteen.<br />Despite the fact that the character of Holly's supportive neighbor is distinctly different, Peppard does a great acting job in the movie. The character has published one book, \\"Nine Lives.\\" Hepburn and Peppard seem to have good chemistry between them. If they ever remake this movie, how about Philip Seymour Hoffman as the writer-neighbor?<br />Mickey Rooney's caricature of Mr. Yunioshi, the neighbor who is always complaining is way over the top with his buck teeth and slapstick bits. The part is a much more inflated role than in the book, and Rooney's take is racist, making the character into a buffoon unnecessarily.<br />The movie has too much of that old Hollywood clich&eacute;d flavor in this adaptation of a fine piece of fiction. It's a movie full of fascinating details and incidents and doesn't bore.<br />Peppard says, \\"You belong to me,\\" and Holly says, \\"People don't belong to each other.\\" She says, \\"I need money, and I'll do whatever I have to do to get it.\\"<br />Holly was a wild thing that Hollywood in its infinite ignorance had to tame.ts.

0743298039|5.0|I can totally see this book as a movie. The author's detail and characters just beg to be on the big screen. It is a deep, mysterious, horrifying story that keeps you enthralled from the beginning to end.  I loved it.
1439138311|3.0|I don't even know where to begin with this review as my thoughts are all over the place so it's best I start at the beginning.  First off, I don't think it's a great idea for an author to give a name to a character that a good percentage of his readers won't know how to pronounce.  In the novel Brooklyn, we are introduced to an Irish lass named Eilis.  I've never even seen this name before and, when I first looked at it, I thought it said Elias. Consequently, every time I saw the name thereafter, I always pronounced it as Elias and clearly this main character was not an Elias.  I know this is a minor point but it's one that bothered me.<br /><br />I grew up in Brooklyn and, when I was living there, I couldn't wait to leave and, now that I'm gone, I'm always in search of any book that will bring me back.  I guess that's what nostalgia is all about. Years ago, I came upon another book with Brooklyn in its title, Crossing Brooklyn Ferry by Jennie Fields, and it's one of my favorites because it really brought me back there.  Fields also grew up in Brooklyn so everything she wrote about was very authentic.  I corresponded with Fields after that and it was she who recommended this book to me.<br /><br />This story starts out in Ireland post WWII and it's where we first meet Elias....oh, excuse me, I mean Eilis.  She's just out of school and looking for a job but, in her town of Enniscorthy, jobs are hard to find.  She lives with her mother and older sister Rose and it's Rose's job that basically supports the entire family.  Through a priest, who's visiting Ireland from Brooklyn, Rose arranges for him to sponsor her sister Eilis' emigration to the states where jobs are plentiful and a future is possible. Eilis is heartbroken to leave but goes along with the plan.  Once she arrives in Brooklyn and begins her job, she's not sure if she did the right thing.  But she perseveres and makes a life for herself working, going to school and eventually finding a boyfriend.<br /><br />I really enjoyed the story Toibin was telling.  Even though his main character is very passive, it works within the story.  I loved all the supporting cast and felt they were all believable.  But then the main problem came into play for me. It all started when Eilis is at Nathan's with her boyfriend and his brother and the author talks about them putting ketchup and mustand on their hotdogs.  At this point, not being familiar with this author, I had to look at the back jacket to see where he was from and I could see he never lived in Brooklyn.  I'd like to report here and now that no one, and I mean NO ONE, put ketchup on a hotdog at Nathan's in Brooklyn in the 1950's.  The only reason Nathan's even had ketchup on its premises is for the french fries.  Then one night, in the midst of a calamity, Eilis decides to take the train to her boyfriend's house in Bensonhurst.  The author says that the trip should take a little more than an hour.  A little more than an hour???  There's nowhere in Brooklyn that's going to take you more than an hour to get to via train from another location in Brooklyn.  You could go all the way out to Suffolk County on Long Island in less time. I know these are things only someone from Brooklyn would probably pick up on but my feeling is if you're going to write a book that takes place in Brooklyn and then make the title of the book \\"Brooklyn\\", then you better have your facts straight before you put it out there for your readers.  Or better yet, have someone edit it who actually lived there during that time.<br /><br />Many times an author tries to make a location a character within the book.  I love when they do this but there is no way Toibin tried to do this.  He couldn't because he simply doesn't know the place.  I never felt for one minute that I was in Brooklyn.  Other than the trips to Coney Island and Ebbets Field, it could have been Anywhere, USA.  While Eilis was working on Fulton Street in a department store, I would have loved tohave had her make a visit to A&S or Mays department store.  I would have loved for her to sit at a lunch counter drinking an egg cream.  I would have loved for her to be walking in the street while watching some kids play stickball. I would have loved to see her witness a dog at a Johnny pump. This is the real Brooklyn but it's not the Brooklyn that came across on these pages.<br /><br />At one point, Eilis makes a trip back to Ireland and it's here that the author, who is from Dublin, is clearly more comfortable.  Even with everything I've already said, I was still enjoying this story and actually stayed up late one night to finish it.  At this point, it was a 4 star book for me.  Not great but certainly a good read. That is, until the ending where I feel the author must have gotten a call from his publisher telling him he had to wrap it up.  Because that's what he did and before I knew it, the book was over.  To say I didn't like the ending would be an understatement.....I hated it.<br /><br />So nostalgia aside, because I never felt any, this Brooklyn was definitely not the Brooklyn of the 50's where I grew up.  I agree with other reviewers that Toibin can write but it's a shame that my first introduction to his work was not a 5 star one.or Mays department store.

B001VZY4MS|5.0|This is a terrific album, and now that it's been newly remastered in pristine HDCD sound, I hope that it will be rediscovered by legions of Neil Young fans who may have overlooked it as one of Neil' as earlier efforts. In style, it's transitional between the rhapsodic, if slightly spacey, Neil Young who appeared in Buffalo Springfield classics like Broken Arrow and \\"On the Way Home\\" (written by Young, but sung masterfully on Buffalo Springfield's final album by Richie Fury), and the rockin' in the free world Neil who would emerge in glorious full plumage with his next album, the timeless \\"Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere\\" in which he teamed with Crazy Horse. In his later solo efforts as well as his inspired collaborations with Crosby, Stills, and Nash, Young would go on to display a kind of mastery of taut, rock rhythm and soulful melody that hadn't quite gelled at the time he laid the tracks for this album, but which still can be seen just below the surface and some of the more accomplished tracks, such as \\"What Did You Do to My Life,\\" \\"I've Been Waiting for You,\\" and others. Still, this inaugural release was a wholly individualistic and inspired effort, which laid the path for Young's later individuality and iconoclastic career as a rock star who challenged so many of the boundaries and conventions of the genre.    The history of the mixing and mastering of this album is quite unusual. The first LP release was quickly withdrawn from circulation by Young, because he didn't like the sound quality, and he was right. I have the original Neil Young LP, and the sound was muddy and thin. The subsequent LP release (you can tell the difference because it has \\"Neil Young\\" in block letters at the top) was a big improvement, but frankly, still left a lot to be desired, certainly compared with Young's later LP and CD releases. The mastering of the first 1990 CD release, which is still in print and still offered by Amazon (at a higher price!) was a typical disaster of the earlyCD era, and appears to have used a hissy LP master of indifferent quality. For this release, Young and his team of dedicated engineers have gone back to the original master tapes and remastered all the tracks in pristine HDCD, a high definition format that I personally prefer to SACD, and which has the advantage of not requiring a special player to get improved sound. (Although, those with HDCD players, such as those made by Denon and Mark Levinson will notice even more improvement.) It sounds great, with Young's voice moved up closer on the soundstage, and with greater definition to the background vocals and fascinating instrumentation from producer Jack Nietzsche.    That said, I do have one little quibble with the remastering. Although it is a huge improvement overall, like most CDs today, this one plays extremely loud, which requires you to adjust the volume constantly if you're using it as part of a compilation on your iPod or on your CD carousel player. But no big deal, this is a great album, that should finally get its day in the sunshine as a notable, if early, contribution of Neil Young's magnificent, long career oeuvre.

B001EOOQF6|5.0|I consider this album among the two or three albums that define the genre called Heavy Metal...the crowning achievements and purest expressions of the form.  The other couple being Iron Maiden's self-titled first album and Judas Priest's Unleashed in the East.      Yes, there are many great \\"hard rock\\" albums and many great speed/thrash metal albums, etc.  But I'm talking about Heavy Metal..    The Mob Rules is worth listening to over and over, as I have.  Hundreds of times.  It has it all...I don't even want to try and describe it.  Just get it.      It's not the best Sabbath Album, but it's one-of-a-kind in it's rawness and straight ahead headbangability (is that a word?) ....this is no blues album, and it's no rock album...it's a metal album...    And it's one of the best HEAVY METAL albums in existence.      Timeless.  Classic.  Magnificent.    Thanks guys!!!  Truly.

I had to turn to the back of the dust cover to find out more about  the amazing author, Steig Larsson.  When I found out that he had died - not just, but years before- his prescient call on the global economical meltdown as background for the brilliant plot and wonderful characters took on an even more overwhelming sense of his loss.
B000063COX|5.0|If I had to point to one single Heavy Metal album that defines the genre, this would probably be it.  This along with Black Sabbath's The Mob Rules and Ozzy's Blizzard of Ozz and maybe something like Juda Priest's Unleashed in the East or Metallica's Ride the Lightning....these handful of albums really are the definition of the genre...      Yes, there is speed/thrash metal like Slayer and Megadeth and yes there is hard rock like AC/DC, Motorhead, Scorpions, and Van Halen...and grungy heavy rock like Soundgarden and those bands...    But for THE BEST OF HEAVY METAL ROCK AND ROLL....well this album pretty much hits the nail on the head.  It's got the punk rock influence.  It's got the ballads.  It's got the aggression, the angst, the coarseness, the screaming guitars, thundering drums and bass, it's ...well, it [...] rocks, and it always will rock.    Not to mention, it's got class, taste, and is on par with the highest level of artistic integrity found in the business, bar none.      And it's got Paul Di'Anno.  He's no pansie.  Ok, well, Bruce isn't a pansy...but Paul isn't Bruce.  Paul is hard-core...he is down with the street..he is gritty and he is raw.      This is the best Maiden album.  It may be the best Metal album there is.    THEY AIN'T GOT A THING ON ME..I'M RUNNING WILD..I'M RUNNING FREE.......
0374139563|5.0|Dambisa Moyo does a credible job showing that the $1 trillion in development aid provided to Africa over the last several decades does not have much positive to show for itself.  She is less convincing about what to do instead to promote development in Africa.    Ms. Moyo is not coy and doesn't make the reader wait long for her message: on the second page of the Introduction she states \\"Aid has been, and continues to be, an unmitigated political, economic, and humanitarian disaster for most parts of the developing world.\\"  She then spends half the book bolstering her thesis.  In Chapter Four (The Silent Killer of Growth) Ms. Moyo shows how aid makes a list of bad things worse: corruption, dependency that kills entrepreneurship, and disenfranchisement of citizens, as government leaders' heads (and hands) are turned away from their people and towards foreign donors. So, Ms. Moyo concludes, aid has not and will not do good and proposes that it stop in five years.    In the second half of the book, Ms. Moyo moves onto solutions, offering four suggestions for alternative financing to Africa once the aid spigot has been turned off: access the international bond market, encourage Chinese direct investment in infrastructure, push for freeing trade, especially agricultural trade, and promote micro-lending and use of secure property titles for securing loans.      While these proposals are valuable as suggestions towards a different development model, by themselves they are not solutions to the problems. Each might have a role (although that is debatable for several) in mobilizing capital and creating the independence and entrepreneurship that has been stymied by development aid, but it's not clear how they address underlying causes.  Ms. Moyo believes that the private sector does a better job than the public sector at policing corruption (because you can't get away with it repeatedly and you must produce results).  That assertion is dubious, at best.  The private sector is rife with corruption and the business elites defend their private interests more vigorously than the coterie of elites created by aid.     This is the weak part of an otherwise refreshing analysis: Ms. Moyo does not make a convincing case of how moving money flows from the public to the private sector would reduce the likelihood that corruption and the lack of good governance would derail her proposals, as they have done so with aid programmes.  As Mo Ibrahim, an African telecommunications businessman who made piles of money legitimately in Africa and now funds a foundation promoting good governance and leadership in Africa says: \\"Nothing, simply nothing, is more important for Africa than good governance.\\"
B000002P5W|5.0|As great as Jimi was, this is the only album where he put it all together.  Its sad he didn't get a chance to do more...    The first album was great, but it had a \\"hits\\" quality to it, I've always thought.  This one, however, was an actual album.  I think albums are getting to be kind of rare these days, but not in the late 60s/early 70s when that is what bands made...albums.  Not collections of songs.    Anyways, yeah, this is the one where Jimi coalesced and gelled and produced a visionary piece of work.  And then Electric Ladyland came out which was great, but watered down...like it started well but seemed hurried and really needed my refinement and probably should have been a  single LP.      I think its been said many times that Axis is the Jimi album...kind of the only one.  It makes me sad even still, because he was a creative genius who was used and abused and probably still is wondering what the f&*k happened even now...you know?    For a brief shining moment he got it all together, and this ultra-classic ALBUM is the result.    Buy it, listen to it, trip on it, know it.  This is la creme de la creme of album-oriented psychedelic rock, and defines a whole era.  It really is and it really does.    Peace.

They were really tight, and really had some kind of magic working for them.  Each song on here is timeless, infinitely deep and still rocking at the same time.  Even the album artwork should be in the Smithsonian or the Louvre, really.  Hard to say why though....there is just something about this album...    Sounds better on vinyl, that's for sure...in fact, with some pops and small scratches, even better...they should release a \\"used vinyl\\" release on CD.  Seriously...that only adds aura and mysticism to this record, as i'm sure many of the old-timers on here can attest to....    The music world has taken a long trip downhill since the heady days of the early 70s...I really don't think anyone can deny that fact.  Somehow those days produced so many classics...and so many from England too..odd, isn't it?      Honestly though, there are no rock and roll albums better than this...some \\"equals\\" maybe, sure.      I will say this, though, a lot of those guys from then were kind of thieves of the Delta Blues, now weren't they???  I wonder how many of them ventured to the crossroads...Jimmy??
B00275EGTC|4.0|The current trend of science fiction in American cinema has no doubt built a powerhouse of movies that never attempted to do anything but completely blow the audience's sensory input away with feasts of explosions, gunplay, back-and-forth dialogue, and let's not forget, creative science. Just in the past decade films like Minority Report and Transformers and even Star Trek have never trusted their science fiction plot leanings enough to let it carry the movie. And similarly, most big-budget and even small budget (ie, Sunshine) science fiction films assume the audience has the attention span of a hyperactive video game junkie. But then there is Moon. A sci-fi film that trusts people have attention spans that last longer than thirty seconds by not forsaking its intriguing setting and plot for an onslaught of action sequences--a film that is more introspective than explosive. Director Duncan Jones takes the audience to a desolate world of a single astronaut and creates a great study in what it means to be a human.    Moon is a film with a simple premise. In the near future some corporation has figured out that helium in moon rocks can be harvested to create energy. So, it sends one astronaut, Sam (Sam Rockwell), to maintain the operations of the rock harvesting equipment. The conditions on the space station are not too bad. There is television, living quarters, gardening, sculpting, table tennis, and a companion robot named Gerty (voiced by Kevin Spacey). But even with all of the luxuries, the three-year contract that Sam signs is still an extremely lonely experience, especially since the live feed for connecting with his family and friends went down in some solar flare accident; so all contact with Earth is limited to pre-recorded video messages. And well, robot companions aren't the most rewarding of friends.    Admittedly, it is harder to write this review without pressing on one of the most delicate plot points of the movie, which is best left for the viewer and not for someone to spoil. But the main conflict of the film surrounds Sam dealing with himself during the final weeks of his contract. Director (and co-writer) Duncan Jones forces the audience to question how far free-market companies will go to exploit physical resources as well as human labor (which is interesting considering the current health care reform situation). Moon shows that people can be and ARE expendable for someone else's greater good. Yet, it also stresses with this observation, that people should never be reduced to a specific part in some \\"greater\\" whole.    Beyond the plot elements, Moon succeeds in creating atmosphere with its sparse set design within the space hold, while creating visually appealing lunar-scapes. It is refreshing that the film didn't make the technology outrageous and seemingly unbelievable. Sam has the same kind of spacesuit as astronauts have now. And all the moon rovers look believable with large Hummer-esque wheels and a clunky exterior. Similarly, the music in the film actually matches the dramatic beats and aids the tension set within the plot. Indeed, music composer Clint Mansell keeps with the eerie landscape of the moon and the psychological elements of the film.    And well, Sam Rockwell does a really great job as the sole actor (minus a couple other very minimal roles) of the film. He plays his role as the astronaut with great range, from humor, to loneliness to rage to anguish. But he picks up on little things too. Like throughout the film he acts so comfortable in space and on the moon. When he gears up for lunar-walks or updates information about the harvesting, there is no mystique about the moon. He is casual, seemingly not concerned with how life-threatening space can be; it is just another job, another place to exist. Which is why his performance heightens the themes of the film. His lack of wonderment with space, in things that lose their novelty IS a human trait.    Hard science fiction like Moon is a dying breed of film. Which is sad, especially since the last thing like this any audience had to chew on came in the form of the American adaption of Tarkovsky's Solaris. Any film that can create tension without gunplay or explosions or chase scenes is already heightened to a level of writing that exceeds a lot films. Thankfully Duncan Jones has decided to continue a film series in the same setting as Moon (which he originally planned and didn't tack on after success). I am curious to see where Jones goes after this directorial debut, which is one of the most mentally rewarding films of the year.
B00007E8V4|5.0|I'm not a metal fan but I do like System of a Down simply because they're unique. This album really demonstrates what the aim of alternative metal is.<br /><br />The first song called Chic'n'Stu really had me interested because of the comedy mixed in with the serious music. I really appreciated how the band used only the minimum amount of synth and desired a more raw sound. The Armenian influence is always present and is something I really like. Each song is unique and has its place. The songs Pictures and Streamline demonstrated some different fun rhythms.<br /><br />You will enjoy this album!
B00275EGWO|5.0|Ever since the 9/11 attacks on the United States, Iraq and its relationship with terrorism has been a hot-button topic. Between the weapons of mass destruction and the constructed civil war, people have questioned the purpose and validity of an Iraq intervention, making the Iraq War, like most others, a largely complex issue. Especially if the war seemingly has the greatest purpose of national security for some, whereas others see the war as useless or a distraction from a greater threat. In any case, the Iraq War has always been something drummed up or put down by its delicate image, constantly thrown in the moral spotlight of good vs. evil. But even with such spotlight, in its sixth year, the Iraq War is something oddly abstract and quickly fading from the public conscious.    The Hurt Locker, directed by Kathryn Bigelow (Point Break), is a cross-section of the Iraq War. It is a film that takes the detail of a single bomb squad without centering the plot in some type of moral conundrum. The movie starts in Iraq and ends in Iraq, and for about 99% of the run time, all you see is Iraq and a war with characters acting as real soldiers, as real people. Bigelow's and screenwriter Mark Boal's greatest accomplishment with this film manifests in how determined they are to make a war film that isn't weighed down by fantasy or idealism, but instead authenticity.    Indeed, the film begins with a bomb squad in Iraq that mixes robotics and hand-to-hand techniques for disarming a bomb left in the middle of the street. Everyone in the city appears as a threat and anyone that moves at all out of line becomes a target for suspicion. Hence, within the first moments, there is already a sense of urgency and tension as the bomb diffusing sergeant (played by Guy Pearce) attempts to fix the problem. And well, not everything goes according to plan, and the bomb explodes. But what is so great about this moment is how sensitive Bigelow treats this scene. She focuses slightly on the grandiose nature of the explosion, but then focuses on smaller things--like the jittering rust on a car, and the rattling pebbles in the sand and the seemingly voyeur-esque moments where Iraqis stare at the soldiers from their homes. And as a result, within the first moments of the film, the audience knows that Bigelow's focus is not exaggeration; instead she wants to explore the smaller moments within the war-zone.    Which is why it makes sense that the movie feels like episodic moments with the bomb squad rather than a continuous overarching plot. The Sergeant who dies in the explosion is replaced by a \\"wild-man,\\" Staff Sergeant William James (Jeremy Renner), who is more comfortable diffusing bombs than his predecessor. He leads his team that consists of Sergeant JT Sanborn (Anthony Mackie) and Specialist Owen Eldridge (Brian Geraghty) in a series of bomb diffusing situations. But while the film doesn't have an overarching bad guy (thankfully), the script does progress as a tour-in-the-life of the three soldiers as the bond through their shared experiences. Yet, never do they have a great catharsis of friendship or disdain--instead their relationship grows as much as it can within the petri-dish-confines of war.    No doubt, character development in the film is almost perfect. Not only does Bigelow and Shoal depict the three soldiers with succinct storytelling, they also manage to touch base on the different attitudes soldiers have about war. James is the team-leading anti-hero who finds the adrenaline of war satisfying--more so than most things in life, which is excellently portrayed in the final moments of the film when he returns briefly to his home and stands in the endless sea of cereal boxes in the grocery store, looking completely burdened by the banality of his \\"ordinary\\" life. Sanborn is a middle ground between the other two soldiers. He is not a proponent of war nor complete afraid of his duty. He is understanding of the task at hand and does not stray away from his role on the team. And then there is Eldridge, the presumably youngin' who is afraid to die but nonetheless is fighting in a war. Yet, even with Eldridge's fear and anxiety about battle, his character never becomes completely overwhelmed with the fear to where drama surrounds him completely.    Not only does Bigelow create believable and balanced characters, she also depicts a seemingly indifferent Iraq, which comes as a result to her non-existent political tone. There is both camaraderie between some soldiers and Iraqis whereas there is also disdain. Similarly, the dialogue is not encumbered with American propaganda for freedom or liberty or whatever while at the same time does not have Iraqis demonizing Americans as cruel people. Most of the feelings about Americans within Iraq come through visuals; Bigelow lets the camera do the talking and instead of overthetop and overt speeches--the bare-naked piercing stare of several Iraqis looking at a soldier with a gun is enough to know what is what. For example, one of the greatest instances of how sliced the American perspective and the Iraqi perspective can be in this war occurs when a man walks into the middle of a street with a bomb attached to him. William James attempts to diffuse the bomb, but it goes sour, and so the bomb explodes with James in a close distance being propelled to the ground. As he looks up, dazed from the blast, he sees a kite flying, and notes a kid nearby flying the kite.    While there really is no contest on films about the Iraq War, the Hurt Locker stands as one of the best films of the year and probably of the decade. And no doubt, it should be added to the cannon of great American war films. Director Kathryn Bigelow and screenwriter Mark Shoal have captured war without the moral bells and whistles. This film has a grand showcase of little moments, of rippling sand, of running goats, of children's laughter, of how boring and tiring and frightening war can be. Of course the legitimacyof the Iraq War can be argued probably forever, yet what goes on there is both trash and treasure for soldiers serving duty.
B0000084J7|5.0|Mark Hollis - s/t (1998) His first and only solo and its somewhat a continuation of the last couple of Talk Talk albums, only more stark, more intimate. The instruments sound very closely mic'd, like an acoustic jazz album. It has the same jazz flourishes here and there that you'd find on Spirit Of Eden, but this album is even more of a minimalist approach. A true album experience in that the album plays more like a song cycle in theme and mood - each track has its own identity, but all tracks flow seemlessly into one another like a movie soundtrack. Hollis' vocals flint in and out like a muted trombone, and although they carry the tone and meaning of a particular song, the vocals are rarely the centerpiece but on a few songs. Its completely mesmerizing.     Surely, this (and Talk Talk) must have influenced recent efforts by newer acts like Bon Iver and Shearwater. Unfortunately, music like this barely exists, if only in the few collections lucky enough to have it. Since it never shoots for a mainstream single, I doubt it got but a smidgen of airplay. Too moody for adult contemporary, too artsy for smooth jazz, too good for pop. It gets labeled alternative, but nothing on this album owes a thing to rock. Any fan of the brooding, ambient jazz noir of the early-mid '60s will like this music.
B0028K3192|4.0|I am not a Maxwell fan.I have listened to all his albums because he struck me as a developing artist.This album shows his creativity by having a lot of mid-tempo songs, his vocal range improvements with his real voice, a switch of vocal styles and beats, his live-band, and his lyrics have always been cool with me.  I really liked this cd. It was not boring or monotonous.  It kind of reminded me of Eric Benet with his first two cd's as far as R&B creativity, but this is essentially Maxwell.Really I probably shouldn't have even mentioned Benet b/c he and Maxwell sound nothing alike. I was just trying to compare how the artist stays true to R&B creativity and not the assembly line 112, LLoyd,  Timberlake crap out now. I still won't buy the other cd's of Maxwell but this one was what I was hoping for him to arrive at musically.  The songs are very catchy after listening to them for weeks, and I most likely will buy  his next cd because I've always liked his direction and now I think the knowledge of what he's doing musically has finally caught up for him.My 2 cents.

B0016MJ6HY|3.0|***1/2<br /><br />Despite its status as a low-budget, independent feature, \\"My Blueberry Nights\\" boasts a roster of A-list players - Jude Law, David Strathairn, Rachel Weisz and Natalie Portman - that any mainstream filmmaker would consider it a privilege to work with.<br /><br />In her big screen acting debut, singer Norah Jones plays Elizabeth, a beautiful young woman from New York who, after her boyfriend dumps her, decides to head out across the country to try and forget about her past and make a new life for herself.  Working as a waitress in Memphis and the Desert Southwest, Lizzie meets up with a variety of colorful characters, including Strathairn as an alcoholic cop, Weisz as the wife who`s been cheating on him, and Portman as a compulsive gambler who lures Lizzie into one of her schemes.  In addition, Law plays a caf&eacute; owner back in the city who introduces Lizzie to the delights of blueberry pie and who serves as the letter-writing confidante and emotional focal point the wayward young lady needs while she's off on her travels.<br /><br />As conceived by director Wong Kar Wai and co-writer Lawrence Block, the vignettes aren't all that terribly interesting, actually, but the artful look and tone give the film a hip, sophisticated flavor.  And since Lizzie is pretty much just a passive observer of  the dramas that unfold around her, we don`t become as emotionally invested in the characters as we might had she been allowed to become a more proactive force in the narrative - though we're willing to concede that this approach might well have been necessitated by Jones` neophyte status as an actor.  Her work here isn`t bad, by any means, but then she isn't called upon to do much more than react to the people and events around her.  As a result, it's still probably way too soon to make any kind of definitive prediction regarding her future as an actress.<br /><br />Still, the contemplative, lyrical mood of the film and the sometimes astute and touching observations it makes about both the good and bad aspects of relationships turn \\"My Blueberry Nights\\" - its episodic nature notwithstanding - into an enjoyable, if minor, triumph for Wai and his gifted cast.ood and bad aspects of relationships turn \\"My Blueberry Nights\\" - its episodic nature notwithstanding - into an enjoyable, if minor, triumph for Wai and his gifted cast.

0061537969|5.0|What do you get when you mix Formula 1 racing, with philosophy for living, man's best friend, tragedy, conflict, and a happy ending?  The great American novel.  At least for a man.  I'm not sure what a women would think of this book, but I give it 5-Stars.<br /><br />Garth Stein's novel, \\"The Art of Racing in the Rain\\", is a fabulous encounter with Enzo, or man's best friend in this story, and, as it turns out, it's narrator.  Enzo tells the story of his master's life, or as he calls him, the alpha-human, and is revealed completely through his eyes during his life with him.  Enzo turns out to be an observer of things and quite a philosopher as well.  That is what makes him, as a dog, a truly compelling character.  Enzo's philosophy is within reach of a dog, perhaps, while still sophisticated enough to appeal to a human's higher intellect.  For instance, Enzo is certain that dog's enjoy a higher intellect than other primates such as chimpanzees.  The only restrictions to their social advance is their inability to speak and their lack of an opposable thumb.  He further believes there is a active conspiracy a foot that prevents the evolution of a dog with an opposable thumb through the evidence of the dew claw and the very human (or in humane) practice of removing the dew claw from their pets.  Further, he believes that the dog is fundamentally closer evolutionarily speaking to a human based on the evidence of the existence of the man-dog or werewolf as it were.  This is brilliant deductive reasoning and establishes Enzo as one of the great thinkers in the whole of literary fiction.<br /><br />He is also the know-er and witness to great human tragedy and faces these heretofore very human understandings with great compassion.  \\"The Art of Racing in the Rain\\" much like the great manual for living \\"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance\\", is not about racing or motorcycle maintenance for that matter.  It is about living life and in this case living a life into which not a little, but a lot of rain must fall, and racing into that rain.  When done correctly, at the finish-line, a champion will emerge.but a lot of rain must fall, and racing into that rain.  When done correctly, at the finish-line, a champion will emerge.

I find that a lot of Tracy Chapman albums require a couple of listenings to fully appreciate the music and become familiar with the lyrics, however, on \\"Our Bright Future\\" the songs stuck with me after the first listen.<br />My favorite songs from \\"Our Bright Future\\":<br />\\"Sing For You\\"<br />\\"Save us All\\"<br />\\"I Did it all\\"<br />\\"Our Bright Future\\"<br /><br />Thanks for the great album Tracy!
0765356139|4.0|After reading the outstanding &#34;The Final Empire&#34;, I think it's safe for me to say that I am a big fan of Brandon Sanderson, and wouldn't miss continuing the Mistborn Trilogy for anything.  It was a strange experience to read &#34;The Well of Ascension.&#34; It is, simply put, a mix of some of the best authorship and storytelling in fiction, mixed in with the taint of middle-book syndrome, quite possibly the worst case of &#34;transition book problems&#34; that I've ever read.  I'll start with the good. On one hand, Sanderson is an absurdly good writer. Characters are three-dimensional and fleshed out. Minor characters are interesting and unusual. Character development is deep and incredible. Dialogue is some of the most entertaining and realistic stuff I've ever read. Action scenes are so intense and spectacular that sometimes it's hard to follow all the complex moves and executions, rendering the finishes even more incredible. Complex politics and issues to be explored abound, seeing what really happens in the aftermath of the Dark Lord's fall, and the subtle morals and issues examined greatly enhance the storyline.  Best of all, revelations shoot out of nowhere and hit the reader again, and again, and again. Things thought to be fact are revealed to be falsehoods or deceptions. Things once thought trivial are revealed to be major. New ground is explored over all issues, both from the words of the ancient Keeper Kwaan and the personal discoveries of the main characters. The story is so deep and interconnected, so complex and masterfully spun, one can do little except stand in awe of Sanderson's towering genius of tale-spinning. If this book had been as fast-paced as The Final Empire, it would be just about impossible for me to critique it in any even remotely negative way.  However, like a perfect statue that's been chipped, or a painted masterpiece with a huge smudge, The Well of Ascension has one great flaw that sours the quality of the piece as a whole.It's boring.  How could such a fantastic and fast-paced story become so . . . dull? I'll tell you why. While I was reading the Well of Ascension, I couldn't help but get the impression that Sanderson got some influence from Robin Hobb. It seems strange to compare the two, given how much I enjoy Sanderson's writing but can't stand Robin Hobb's. I'd sometimes like to think of Mistborn as the techniques of the Farseer Trilogy done right, but even that's difficult. The point is, the same problem that made &#34;Royal Assassin&#34; one of the worst books I've ever read has come onto this novel and rendered it imperfect.  Politics, politics, politics.  Don't get me wrong, I'm all for politics playing a role in a story. It fleshes out the characters, adds new schemes and plots, and makes the whole world more realistic. Unfortunately, tWoA has fallen into the trap of having loooooooooong periods of almost nothing happening but boring political maneuvers that would have been better off cut from the final product. The waistline of the Well of Ascension has been expanded and fattened by unnecessary drivel to the point where the seams are bursting, mostly due to Elend's ridiculous political arc. Then there were the sections with Sazed, which showed better what Feruchemy was capable of, but were quite simply too long and boring. This book should have been at least 100 pages shorter than it was, preferably 200-300 pages shorter.   On the bright side, both the initial premise and the final 170 or so pages were fantastic. Sanderson again demonstrated his ability to wrap up innumerable plot points and conflicts without rushing or resorting to deus ex machina. The final events were breathtaking and grindingly suspenseful, making me very, very glad that I had already gotten &#34;The Hero of Ages&#34; before I finished this book. Waiting to get back to the story would have been torture.  But that's the rub. All the story of the book was compressed into the beginning and the end, leaving the middle a fat, saggy mess that should have been ruthlessly burned down to a fraction of it's size. C'mon, Sanderson! The story is brilliant! Why drag out pointless happenings about the assembly and whatnot when we should be concentrating on this epic storyline? As I said before, if the story had permeated the whole thing, this book would have been almost beyond compare.  The Well of Ascension is still a book of remarkable quality and professional authorship, but sadly weighed down by the bloated state of it's middle. Hopefully, this transition book was all we'll see of this vile corruption of boringness and &#34;The Hero of Ages&#34; will focus on the story and take the books back up to near-perfect levels.
0385737424|4.0|What a delightful read..  Little bit coming of age, little bit sci fi, all around fun read.  It is really a simple easy read, but is well laid out, great characters and an interesting storyline.
B001AVEJ1Y|1.0|I went to the theater expecting a good rendition of the characters I have admired and respected since I was a kid watching the original series back in the 60's.  I came away thinking I wasted my money on the tickets and refreshments.  The director seemed to think that people like me and others that appreciate the quality of the original series and movies, have short memories and knowledge of what the characters were like.  What possessed the writers and the director to portray Kirk as some reckless, troubled boy?   Are all young people like that today?  Are they expected to be that way?  I expected Chekov to be young, but not that young!    The studio should have made this into a mini-series and explore each character individually, instead of spending millions of dollars on a movie.  I can't imagine this being in anyone's Star Trek movie collection.  The director did poor job in portraying the technology and sequence of events in relation to the original series.    I wanted to leave the rating at zero, but the form will not let me do that.  DON'T BUY THIS DVD.  It would be a colossal mistake.
B0025WUK1U|5.0|This was such a great video.  The insight into his being was far greater than I expected.  The music was amazing of course.  Not knowing who this person was prior to watching I feel deeply rewarded and enriched.
B001GCUNYO|5.0|Awesome movie. Did not expect it to be that good, but was blown away. I like this movie better than the Bourne movies. I hope there will be a sequel.
1400032717|5.0|This book is probably one of THE most interesting books I've ever read. If you are a person who is looking for a verbose novel about a boy with Asperger's syndrome, this is not the book for you. However, if you are looking to get an enlightening glimpse into the unique thought processes of a 15 year old British boy, this book will be a delightful treat. I was impressed with Mark Haddon's skill to maintain the narrator's (Christopher Boone) integrity, and not simply tell the story in a manner most readers may be accustomed to. Despite the teen's simplistic voice sharp insight into the ways we \\"normal\\" people think will definitely delight and surprise those of us willing to think \\"outside-the-box.\\"
B00005JK8K|1.0|I have watched hundreds of movies, but this was one of the worst I have ever seen. I love WWII movies and can usually stomach even the worst ones, but not this. This movie looked like it was directed by a 12 year old and the acting was horrible. Script was bad. Not worth it. Even the action, people blowing up and getting shot were cheesy. Not worth the time.
0307278409|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. I thought the narrator's voice was very interesting. I am a firm believer that language is an expression of culture and it was very interesting to take this young woman's journey of the West through an Easterner's eyes. She was at times hilarious, profoundly wise, and utterly foolish...but aren't we all?<br /><br />As a westerner who has travelled to the East, it's funny how the mind is processing all of the nuances of culture. I read reviews where other readers didn't particularly enjoy the narrator's broken English. I felt the broken English was such a profound, moving, and real way that many who are thinking and living in a different culture feel. This really was a wonderful book.
B001TODCII|5.0|Liam Neeson is a tremendous actor and I was intrigued when I saw he was in this movie.  Though he has done many roles, I often associate him more with roles such as Michael Collins, Schindler's List and Gangs of New York, as oppossed to more the action roles - though of course he has done turns in those types of movies.    This is a CIA/spy type movie where Liam plays a retired operative whose daughter decides to take a trip to Paris.  As a concerned (divorced) father the premise and relationships are set up nicely at the beginning (with some good scenes of Liam hanging out with his spy friends).  He is really just a normal guy who wants good things for his daughter and is clearly caring for her.  The birthday present and shopping scene was great, not to mention the presentation of the present.   Then his daughter is kidnapped shortly after the arrival in France.    Of course there is the element of spy power, guns and exploisions, but there are so many good scenes that it all works well.   The phone convervastion he has with the kidnappers at the very beginning - you believe every word he says.    Overall a very well done movie with good plot elements, but which does not tie itself down in trying to make the plot too winding and difficult to follow.  Enough twists to keep it entertaining, enough action to keep things moving and ultimately a set of charactors that you wind up caring for and beleiving.      Liam Neeson really pulls this one off.
190669415X|5.0|In the first of the series, originally titled in Swedish \\"Men Who Hated Women\\", Larsson did a magnificent job in setting up an absolutely unforgettable literary character -- Salander.  Where part one of this trilogy fell short was in the too often sideways plotting, i.e. too many red herrings that added little, too many subplots, plus an inability to avoid multiple endings.  However, in \\"The Girl Who Played With Fire (and I would love to know what the original Swedish title is), Larsson, in addition to layering depth to Salander's incredibly unique character, at once creating backstory and thus motivation, he also writes (yes, even at 649 pages in the British paperback edition I read), a very tight plot where virtually all the clues, surprises, and discoveries are well earned.  This one is the masterpiece of the two -- so far -- as there is the third and final book to come.  Still, it's necessary -- and no less rewarding -- to read \\"The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo first.  You'll not be disappointed in either.  You'll even learn a bit about Swedish politics, but most importantly about gender politics in the context of a first class literary thriller.
B000083C49|5.0|Not as good as Star Trek 2 (but then nothing is), this one has a scene with beer, a hot marine biologist and a grumpy McCoy growling about the primitive state of \\"modern\\" medicine. I really liked it.
B000JBWWRY|3.0|My kids love this movie and I highly recommend it. Where I find fault is with the DVD itself and the Disney Corporation.<br /><br />Twice now, when inserted into a computer it has completely screwed things up. First, on my laptop for which a system restore was able to fix and the cause was blamed on the anti-piracy software that automatically runs. The second time, when my daughter inserted the disk into my neighbors desktop computer and the Geek Squad after many hours ended up having to 'wipe the hard drive' and re-install everything. Again, the cause was blamed on 'anti-piracy protection'.<br /><br />So, the movie is great...just be cautious before you watch it on a computer.
B001LMU1JG|5.0|Starring with Val Kilmer playing Nick Rivers, a rock-n-roll singer who is invited to perform in Germany, Top Secret is a rather funny comedy, so off the wall at times that you laugh at your heart's content.    The Cast: Lucy Gutteridge plays Hillary Flammond, just wait until she explains the meaning of her name; Peter Cushing plays the bookstore proprietor, Jeremy Kemp is General Streck, Christopher Villiers plays Nigel \\"The Torch,\\" the resistance leader who was stranded on a deserted island with Hillary when they were children and still has a crush on him, Warren Clarke as Coloner Von Horst, Harry Ditson as Du Quois, Jim Carter as Déjà vu, Eddie Tagoe as Chocolate Mouse and the magnificent Omar Shariff as Agent Cedric.    Val Kilmer performs \\"Tutti Fruitti\\" with such passion that he is rather believable as another version of Elvis Presley, swiveling his hips with the same style and grace. He is invited to Germany, but a Germany that lives behind the Iron Curtain and this blond American version of Elvis Presley brings democratic values to the resistance as he joins their cause. The situations that develop are chaotic, silly at times, but performed with such fun and wit that you will laugh and have to rewind at times to \\"get\\" the joke for they happen at rapid fire. Many classics are played here, scenes from Casa Blanca as Val Kilmer and Lucy Gutteridge play off some of its best lines; The Blue Lagoon when Christopher Villiers \\"The Torch\\" attempts to imitate Christopher Atkins; and many others.    A great spoof, one the funniest movies we have come across, we highly recommend getting this DVD if you need to disconnect, have fun with light hearted comedy. By the way, it took rewinding the movie to get the backwards scene with Peter Cushing and many others to enjoy the fast paced comedy bits. Don't miss it!
0312330537|5.0|Rarely does a novel (actually autobiographical) capture a setting and its sensations, and blend them with remarkable philosophic reflection, as well as the poetry and sensibility of personal feeling, heart-rending backgrounds and stunning descriptions, while it documents singular personalities.  It makes them as real as they certainly are in life, against a breathtaking series of scenarios.  I had to watch \\"Slumdog Millionaire\\" again because despite the non-Indian members of the cast it faithfully illustrates much of the movie's sub-text, and I have to compare its sprawling and panting authenticity with \\"War and Peace\\" --it is vast, and it is voracious. This book climbs into my list of the 10 best of all time.
1400063515|5.0|This book is a necessary read for all. While it holds a more impactful result among financiers and those working in the world of Finance, it's application and principles hold true for the average person with discussions revolving around our common line of thought. A major underlying point is the arguement that what we expect to see is often not what we will actually end up seeing, or what Taleb coins as Platonicity. I've used references to this book countless times since it's completion in a variety of situations, most interestingly, not Finance related.
0307408833|4.0|Suggestions  1) If you don't have any issues with corn, I use cornstarch in place of the arrowroot and potato starch (same volume) with good results.  (I do this simply because I normally have cornstarch on hand but no arrowroot or potato starch and I wanted to cut down on the number of special ingredients I was purchasing.)    2) I didn't have the best of luck with her frosting.  Heidi Swanson in Super Natural Cooking has a recipe for dairyless, gluten-free chocolate mousse which makes a nice frosting.  Alternatively, sometimes I use trans-fat-free margarine in place of the butter in any traditional buttercream frosting recipe.  (Soy/rice milk or even coffee in place of the milk, obviously.)
B001K3JF7K|2.0|I am a Diana Krall fan.  I own 9 of her CD's and her \\"Live in Paris\\" DVD.  Her playing (piano) is great.  Usually, her singing is ok, not bad, not great.  However, on this CD she doesn't sing.  She just whispers the lyrics.  The best one word evaluation of her non-singing on this CD is bland. The music is low key (as in slow and unenergetic) and with the lack of any actual singing, there is little to praise on the whole CD.  Like I said, I normally enjoy Diana Krall, but I recommend passing on this CD.
B001F0RA4S|4.0|I feel cheated by this novel.  The sole reason I read the book is because I had just watched the film version and thought the source novel might shed some light on a couple of points, especially the relationship between Richard and his mother.  I suppose it helped a little, but not much.<br /><br />I think that about summarizes my entire problem with the novel--it's too short.  I suppose that was in part because it's only supposed to cover one day for each of the three main characters--Virginia Woolf in 1923, Laura Brown in 1949, and Clarissa Vaughn in \\"the present\\" or late 90s--and so to maintain that the author couldn't go so much into a lot of backstory.  References are made to the past relationship between Clarissa and her former lover Richard, who's dying of AIDS, and his other former lover Louis, who is not dying of AIDS, but still I would have liked to have known more.  As I mentioned at the beginning, the relationship between Richard and his mother was something I didn't quite understand in the movie, but it makes a little more sense in the book.  In particular I didn't understand how she shows up at the end of the movie when they seemed to imply earlier that she was dead.  In the book it makes more sense that she dies in Richard's book in real life and later he asks Clarissa to call her.<br /><br />I'm sure some people would be annoyed that I'm comparing and contrasting the book and movie and not taking them as separate entities.  On the whole, I think it was a push as to which is better.  The book does a better job, as books do, of giving characters internal life.  The movie conveys much of this through dialog between the characters, which makes for better drama, especially when Virginia Woolf and her husband are arguing at the train station.  It works much better in the film version when they're talking than in the novel where most of it occurs in Virginia's head as she sits on a bench.  Some of the background characters like Sally, Clarissa's lover, and Julia, Clarissa's daughter, are given more depth in the book than the movie while Virginia's husband Leonard and her sister, niece, and nephews seem to get more time in the film.  So it's hard overall to say which is better, though in the end I think I'm more attached emotionally to the film because of the heightened drama, whereas the book seems a little dry.<br /><br />To summarize the plot, it involves three women, as I mentioned above.  First there's Virginia Woolf, the brilliant but mad author who in 1923 is living in the countryside of England with her husband, a printer, and not altogether happy about it.  She sets off to writing \\"Mrs. Dalloway,\\" a novel about a woman who is giving a party and what all happens to her and those around her in London that day.  Concurrently, Laura Brown is living in LA in 1949 with her husband Dan and son Richie and is pregnant with another child.  A socially awkward girl, she seems to have struck it rich when Dan returns from the Pacific and asks to marry her.  But three years later she's not happy.  She's reading \\"Mrs. Dalloway\\" and sees parallels to the book and its author in her life.  And parallel to this we have Clarissa Vaughn in the present.  Her former lover Richard nicknamed her Mrs. Dalloway for Clarissa Dalloway and like that character, Clarissa Vaughn is giving a party.  In her case it's a party for Richard, who has won a prestigious poetry award.  This section of the book often has parallels to the Woolf novel, with modern characters recreating the roles of those in \\"Mrs. Dalloway.\\"  (Sally as Mr. Dalloway, daughter Julia as Elizabeth Dalloway, Richard as Septimus, Louis as Peter Walsh, and writer friend Walter as Hugh.)  Most of the events of this section also mirror those of \\"Mrs. Dalloway,\\" which is really obvious to pick up if you do like I did and read Woolf's book immediately prior to reading \\"The Hours.\\"<br /><br />All three sections of the book are interwoven together to create a rich tapestry of the livesof these three women.  It might have been richer if the author had expanded a little more, as I indicated earlier.  Still, it's a good book and an even better film.  I recommend both.<br /><br />That is all.<br /><br />BTW, it's ironic in the novel that Clarissa thinks she sees Meryl Streep in the trailer of a movie being shot in New York.  For the film version of \\"The Hours\\" Clarissa was played by none other than Meryl Streep.  (This probably explains why that scene was omitted from the film as it would have been pretty cheesy to have Meryl Streep trying to meet herself.)of these three women.

B001M4YZ90|4.0|Most of the British mob keeps dreaming about making it big and retiring happily on the coast of Spain.  But this mobster movie is different.  London is a hub for banking, finance and real estate.  Everyone wants to make a profit, particularly shady characters and seemingly law obiding citizens that have business arrangements with them.  But what is gangster to do, when immigrant gangsters from Eastern Europe start invading their domestic teritory?  How can he protect his turf and still stay on top of the game.<br /><br />Amazing cast of characters are connected to each other.  While they all work on the same goal, ultimately they are all looking out for themselves even if it means taking down their partners in crime.  What adds to this movie is sense of humor that covers it all:  from spacey dope users to macho war criminals turned gang bangers.  Thandie Newton gives an amazing performance as a cold hearted accountant, living in a marriage of convenience (her husband is a homosexual lawyer with powerful connections) and focused on securing her own comfortable life and a safe retirement fund.<br /><br />I loved this movie.

What an awesome cast of actors and Katie Seagul she is unreal in this show,you never know what she really is up to or what she is holding back.If you havent seen this season get it,its different then what is on lately,totally worth it.
0385341008|4.0|This is a charming read, but a little thin on intellect.  There isn't much there to think about.  However, it is a very pleasant way to pass the time, and the characters are finely drawn.  In addition, it imprints the emotional tone of the time on the reader- the need for sacrifice and honor especially. Two months after reading it I find myself continuing to reflect on the emotional qualities of the book, so it sticks with you.
1400063736|5.0|Colum McCann has brilliantly captured the mood of New York in the early 1970s--I lived there at that time so this book resonated and brought back many memories.  Even if you didn't share that experience, he brings \\"average real people\\" to life--people whom you can relate to, people whom you care about.  And he understands the pace of life, and its patterns and randomness, and the meaning of an unusual event--in this case, Philippe Petit's tightrope wire walk between the World Trade Center towers.  I don't want to tell you more about the interwoven stories--just pick up this book and be transported by its rhythms and its music.  As Frank McCourt said, \\"No novelist writing of New York has climbed higher, dived deeper\\".  The world spins.  We stumble on.  It is enough.
B001GZ6QEC|1.0|Let me start by saying this is a review of the movie & not the Blu-Ray disc itself. I saw the movie once & would never repeat that waste of time.<br /><br />Batman is one of those comic book characters in history that cannot be made into a live-action movie. Every version just doesn't work. Adam West's version is super-campy, Tim Burton's are bore-fests, Schumaker's are stupid, & these new one's may be the worst of all. A Batman based in reality? Doesn't work. Let's start off with Christian Bale as Batman / Bruce Wayne. It's no secret Bale is a horrible actor. And never is it more apparent than in this one. From his crooked mouth to his stupid Batman grumble of a voice, he just ruins the entire thing. Then there's Heath Ledger's vastly over-rated performance as the Joker. I wasn't caught up in the hooplah of his death & the nonsense that his Joker was so great. I went in & watched the film expecting someone maniacal, someone scary. Instead, I got a guy who licks his lips & didn't know how to put on his make-up. There's even an old man in the movie who's not scared a bit of him. He comes across as lame & trying too hard. The story was weak & slow moving. The best part of the film is Two Face & they kill him off. Another Hollywood over-rated film that made millions, proving movie-goers are sheep who'll believe the hype.

Instead of thinking oh man I don't have time for a workout this morning, because it is 20-30 min from start to finish, I am so much more motivated to say yes to a workout because I know it wont take long. I very glad I bought it and wouldn't trade it for the world.

B002361MLA|1.0|First, I'm thankful that I ordered this book on my Kindle so I could easily delete it after struggling through the initial \\"chapters.\\"     This book was recommended by a friend, who knew of my longtime interest in self-help and exploring spirituality. I've read and studied many books in this subject area for 20 or more years and have almost always found value and material to learn from in all the books I've read. Unfortunately I found the writing in this book amateurish, rambling, with repetitive and nonsensical assertions. I rarely if ever don't finish an entire book, novel and non-fiction. This I couldn't even make it through a couple of chapters. The introduction by Mr. Tolle says that Time magazine reviewed the book as 'mumbo jumbo'-- I couldn't agree more.    The sample downloaded to my Kindle sadly only included recommendations and the introduction...if it had even part of the wasteful \\"content\\", I would not have bothered. Stay away from this nonsense.

1400049628|5.0|This book was written before World War Z so I have been able to compare things on both books in inverse order (I've readed first WWZ).<br /><br />This book tries to be a \\"serious\\" guide to defend yourself from zombies. As simple as it sounds :D<br /><br />It is sometimes funny, and has a bit of black humour on it, but mostly tries to be as serious and applied as possible.<br /><br />It gives all sort of advices, from how to defend your home to how to establish a contingency plan, how to \\"attack\\" and raid zombie-infested zones, tactics, and some historical zombie attacks (backgrounds for the supposed guide ;)<br /><br />So basically we can say the book is 85% a manual of \\"how to live fighting zombies on a daily basis\\" and 15% a collection of zombie short-stories themed in the past.<br /><br />The guide is really well documented, so much that a movie director wanting to do a zombie movie could use this guide as a manual of \\"how to make a zombie movie\\". Some tactis explained are funny but clever ones.<br /><br />Some of the stories are really well thought and even scarier than the future depicted in World War Z (the one of the slaves ship is my favourite), and look like the seed that Brooks planted for WWZ (or maybe was a \\"playground\\" to see how well could he tell small zombie tales?).<br /><br />If you enjoyed World War Z, or just like zombie movies, go grab this book before the apocalypse comes!
B000F8O4E0|5.0|This \\"Face The Music\\" was one of the albums I was lucky to get in its LP version, as soon as it was issued and sold in record shops.<br /><br />And, no doubt about it, it shows that back in the 70s there were a lot of excellent musicians, singers, composers and producers.<br />Jeff Lynne, E.L.O.'s frontman, got one of his best creatures in this album.<br /><br />Since the very first tune, the almost dramatic instrumental 'Fire On High' with full of classic and operatic chorus works, mixed with acoustic guitar, moog (synthesizer's grandpa) and wild beating drums, this album is A MUST for every serious Rock music collector.<br /><br />Almost every song in this album is a hit, even when some songs weren't  widely aired on radio: 'Waterfall', the superhit 'Evil Woman', the romantic 'Strange Magic'. This album is one of those you can listen from the beginning to the end, without questioning the quality of the performance or the songs themselves. A-1 for sure!!!!!<br /><br />The remastered edition has a very, very good sound quality!
0441017177|5.0|I was slightly disappointed by THE PREFECT but Reynold's has ably redeemed himself with HOUSE of SUNS.  It has everything - terrific plot, great characters and unbelievable imagination and projection.  Two stories alternate - one occurring six million years in the past and the other in the \\"present\\" (which is the future, you see.)  As he does so well, Reynolds slowly merges the two until one the final \\"ah\\" moment.      Once again, originality of ideas keeps the reader begging for more. There is the notion of \\"shatterlings\\" - dividing a human into 1,000 clones (male and female) who apparently live forever, performing good works and supposedly following a strict set of guidelines.  Inevitably, two of the shatterlings break the tabboo against falling in love and their story is what forms the meat of the novel.   Much discussion of breaking the light barrier took place and whether or not the solution for preventing all those time paradoxes makes sense, it certainly provides an answer.  My grade:  A
0307383415|5.0|Whether you agree with Barack Obama or not, it is impossible to argue that he is not an extraordinary individual.  America is a better nation for having him as a leader.  He represents all that is admirable in that country.<br /><br />As is probably well known, Obama was born in Hawaii to a Kansan mother and a Kenyan father.  He was educated partly in Indonesia in firstly a Muslim school and then a Catholic one.  He returned to Hawaii to complete his high school education before going to university in Los Angeles and then law school at Harvard.  He is a worldly man.  His predecessor by way of comparison had scarcely travelled beyond the United States at the time of his inauguration despite coming from a wealthy and influential family.<br /><br />In \\"Dreams From My Father\\", Obama tells his life story from the time of his birth until he was about to enter Harvard.  This consists of three parts.  Firstly, Hawaii and Indonesia where he grapples inwardly with his mixed race background.  Secondly, in Chicago where he worked as a community organiser and, thirdly, he tells of his return to Kenya to meet his large extended family.  The narrative is magnetic and his style is superb.  He could have been a writer had politics not been his calling.<br /><br />Yet despite politics being his calling, this is not a book about politics.  It is Obama's personal journey told with charm, wit and subtlety.  It is his journey from childhood to adulthood, but it is also an unusual story and this is part of its charm.  I recommend this book to all readers.  If you want to understand modern America better, you could do much worse than read this book.  It is modern literature at its finest.
B001UN1KVE|4.0|Spaceballs is one of my all time favorite films and I eagerly awaited it's bluray release and even put in my preorder months in advance. Now that the bluray is here it is still one of my all time favorite films but i must admit the transfer is not demo material.    The transfer itself is solid and without any unnecessary tampering (digital noise reduction, edge enhancement, etc) and it is the best this film will probably ever look on home video however the film itself will never wow anyone with detail.    On the audio side we get a 5.1ch track that does it's job as well as the source material allows... just like the video it's not demo material but it's still a solid track. Also included is the original dolby stereo track along with a rather large collection of languages (and subtitles as well)    The bonus features are the same as the previous DVD edition, I haven't really dug into all of them but in Fox bluray tradition features that need a play all option (in this case the film flubs) don't get that much needed option.    The included DVD is the older flipper disc with the 4:3 pan&scan on one side and the non-anamorphic 1.85:1 version on the other.
1416550542|2.0|I loved \\"the House at Riverton,\\" and I so wanted to enjoy this book, too.  I struggled with it for 2 weeks, and finally bailed about 350 pages in.  I found it to be very hard to follow, far too long, with too many characters.  We have Blackhurst Estate, Mrs. Blackwell and Mr. Blackwater.  I always start reading with a character list, then abandon it if I don't need it.  I had 4 pages of names that I had to constantly refer to.  It jumped around in time way too much.  The book could really use some editing to streamline it.  I am disappointed that I just couldn't finish it, as there where many loose ends I was curious to see resolved.
B0011NVC9I|4.0|First off I want to say I had no idea this movie was animated. I immediately almost turned off my television as soon as I saw that. Computer animated movies just never seem to be able to express a level of realism that brings the story to life. After watching the first opening scenario of Beowulf I was bit skeptical, but after a while I was able to put that aside and enjoy the story.<br /><br /> The story of Beowulf if you remember from english class is an epic poem about a legendary hero who is fearless and conquers all before him. In the poem if I can remember correctly Beowulf is a mans man, he isn't so easily tainted. His greatest reward is the victory from a good challenge. The Beowulf in this film is only half that in the story. He is a courageous godlike character, but he still has the weaknesses of a man. The greatest tale I remember from Beowulf is the story of Grendel and his mother. This movie is pretty much that story but hollywoodfied.<br /><br /> It is its own story in a sense because it samples bits and pieces from the original story, but honestly that doesn't make the film bad at all. Unless your going to nit pick at everything and honestly expect someone to produce a word for word movie on Beowulf it be about 36 hours long... have 18 movies in the entire series, and by the time it was done it be 2030. The movie was just made in good fun to rival at movies like 300! It's an action packed adventure story with a character that can be familiarized with. I for one having read the original poem and watched this movie was able to enjoy them both. Just make sure you know how the real story of Beowulf and Grendels mother goes.<br /><br /> Now on to the movie itself. I think it really suprised me. There were times when the animation looked extremely cheap, but then there were times when it blew you away like the scene with Grendel, his mother aka (Angelina Jolie), and that epic battle against the dragon make this movie worth watching. The fight with the dragon was done amazingly well, and didn't make you feel like it was just endless special CGI effects. It was over the top as any endng should be, but done just right in this one. The story was as good as it could be. The original poem is sort of complex, and I can't see it being adapted to younger audiences and people everywhere without it being made into an understandable movie like this. Aside from the scene with Angelina Jolie (who didn't like that?) and some other scenarios... I can't see that this movie was made to be all that serious. It's for mid to younger audiences. 300! was a gory movie for grown adults, and Beowulf is pretty much a 300ish movie kids can watch.<br /><br /> Overall as I said earlier the movie is great. Worth renting to check it out it is a sword swinging action flick after all so to speak. Now if your one of those nit pickers and you just can't handle a silverscreen version of any book or in this case poem to movie. Stay out the video store, and out the movie theater for that matter... you will never be satisfied, as what nit picker ever truly is?ll, and didn't make you feel like it was just endless special CGI effects.

B001AVEJ1Y|3.0|we all know that this is the prequel to the original star trek series that dramatizes the early lives of the enterprise crew. from the birth of kirk through to him being made captain of the enterprise.    starting with the good bits - the characters were excellent, especially spock and bones. the early storyline was well done where it was explained where kirk got his self-opiniated rebellious behaviour from. there were even some funny bits, like where the russian (what's his name - forgot) is put in control of equipment that responds to voice command (funny, but not very believable). I liked the affair between spock and uhura.    so where does it go wrong? .. the storyline - basically kirk and spock grow up and join starfleet academy and become 2 of the best new recruits. because of kirk's personality he is left behind, but manages to sneak aboard the enterprise (brand new ship in the fleet) with the help of bones. the captain (pike) of the enterprise has to leave the ship and places spock in command. the captain doesn't come back and so spock captains the ship in an effort to maintain the plot. kirk doesn't like what spock is doing so he makes spock angry and spock resigns. there is a line about this point goes something like 'well done kirk, now we don't have a commanding officer'. [how big is the enterprise and how come only one person onboard ship was over 21?] so kirk takes command and defeats the bad guys through amazing feats of ingenuity and an outstanding young crew that went from being wet-behind-the-ears to learned professionals in the space of a few weeks. kirk is promoted to full captaincy of the enterprise and all charges are forgotten - the end.     the idea that a bunch of young cadets could take over command of the best ship in the fleet with no-one objecting .. especially the hundreds of people on board is a tad difficult to believe. the time travel episodes introduce too many ambiguities. please keep away from time travel unless you can describe the rules that explain what happens when the future changes.    entertaining, but unbelievable movie.
B001MEJY8W|5.0|Note: Though this review won't disclose anything after about the first third of the film, the film is sufficiently twisty that some may consider even these early points to be spoilers.<br /><br />Though I'm less pessimistic about the state of horror than most fans, it's a pleasure to finally see a new movement in the genre. It's a quite a surprise, however, to see the new inspiration come from France, which has produced little of note in the last third of the twentieth century apart from \\"Baby Blood\\" and Jean Rollin's bizarre oeuvre. On the downside, while more than a few high quality films (Them, Inside, Sheitan, Malefique) have been produced, few have really expanded on the genre. Fortunately, this gap has been filled by \\"Martyrs,\\" one of the most inventive, unique horror films of the last decade. Much has been made of the film's graphic violence, but director Pascal Laugier displays true boldness in his refusal to submit to viewer expectations or to compromise his surreally bleak vision. Unsurprisingly, \\"Martyrs\\" is also amongst the divisive horror films in recent memory, disgusting mainstream critics while irritating the less adventurous, more gore-obsessed horror buffs. Nevertheless, for a certain portion of the horror cult, \\"Martyrs\\" is an experience like few others.<br /><br />\\"Martyrs\\" opens with a grainy compilation of scenes from a truly bizarre crime, where the young Lucie was held captive in a small room, chained to her chair and endlessly beaten and abused. Lucie eventually escapes through unknown means and is taken into custody, where the authorities hope to reach the disturbed child through another young girl, Anna. The film then leaps forward fifteen years, where the still disturbed Lucie (now Mylene Jampanoi) bursts into an isolated cabin home and massacres a family of four, believing the parents to be her former captors. A panicked Lucie soon calls Anna (now Morjana Alaoui), who is horrified by Lucie's rash acts and rushes to the house to determine precisely how the mad Lucie can escape this horrific situation.<br /><br />Though that synopsis may seem quite straight forward, this covers only a small part of the film. As a whole, \\"Martyrs\\" displays a remarkably wide variety of influences and styles which are combined seamlessly. The early home invasion is blunt, classic 70s exploitation horror at its most intense, but the film soon veers of that path. Note the inexplicable naked woman that haunts Lucie (ghost, hallucination, monster? We don't know initially) whose scarred form, contortionist movements and lank hair recalls contemporary Asian horror. Similarly, after the initial massacre the story quickly leaps in bizarre, almost surreal directions before settling into a slow, agonizing final act. (The torture quotient in contemporary horror is massively overstated, but the final act of \\"Martyrs\\" delivers more than a little.) Most impressively, the twists and changes in tone flow organically from one another before concluding with one of the ambiguously unsettling finales in horror. This is not to say that the film is terribly plausible, even by horror standards, but the film doesn't cheat either.<br /><br />Equally significant, \\"Martyrs\\" is sharply made in all respects. Laugier debuted with the elegant but dull \\"Saint Ange,\\" and here he crafts an impressive mix of style and raw brutality. Gruesome though it can be, it is also quite somber and moving, particularly during the final act. Moreover, the small cast is uniformly capable. Jampanoi generates real sympathy in a role that could easily have been terribly overwrought, while the beautiful, staid Alaoui is the heart of the film, and endures the various horrors of the film with surprising dignity. Also of note is Catherine Begin as the nameless Mademoiselle, who crafts one of the quietest, gentlest human monsters in film.<br /><br />In the final acts \\"Martyrs\\" attempts a sort of existential and metaphysical depth rare to horror films. The film provides no real answers on this front, and many will see these attempts as pretentious, but for me these angles give the film a sort of impact beyond your average horror pic. In short, few films I've seen in recent memory have impacted me so forcefully, and demanded to be watched again immediately. Occasionally such shocks wear off, but watching the film again a number of weeks after my first viewing proved every bit as intriguing as the first time through. Few films can manage this, and if there's any justice in the horror world, \\"Martyrs\\" will be inducted into the canon of horror classics. Either way, it's in my canon. . .<br /><br />Grade: Aee these attempts as pretentious, but for me these angles give the film a sort of impact beyond your average horror pic.

B001U0HBQ0|2.0|This movie had very good cinematography and decent aging and reverse aging effects as well as good acting.  Unfortunately these could not help a very boring movie.
B0025X4P56|4.0|It seems a bit unfair that E made fans wait an excruciating 4 years for a follow up to Blinking Lights and Other Revelations, but after creating a masterpiece of that magnitude, he definitely earned the right to take his time.  Hombe Lobo: 12 Songs of Desire is as different from Blinking Lights as Shootenanny! was from Souljacker.  I draw that comparison because in many ways, I think that this album is a lot like the underrated Shootenanny!<br /><br />First of all, both albums came on the heels of classics.  Shootenanny! was released a mere year after Souljacker which at the time was the Eels' creative high point.  Compared to it's predecessor, it was a pared down, straightforward rock record (at least compared to other Eels' albums) and it felt like a bit of a disappointment at first.  However, repeated listens revealed it to be a smart, well crafted record.<br /><br />Hombre Lobo finds itself in the same position.  Expectations for this album were unfairly high since 2005's Blinking Lights was a career defining work of art from the man called E.  Once again, the follow up feels a little underwhelming at first...until you realize what you're comparing it to.  This album isn't the instant classic that Blinking Lights was.  Like Shootenanny!, it is more of a no frills, straight up rock record.  Yet repeated listens reveal a set of songs featuring gorgeous, subtle melodies smart lyrics and a unifying concept about.....a werewolf...I think.  At any rate, this album is a grower.  The more you listen to it the more you will appreciate it on its own terms and the more you will realize how much of a genius Mark Oliver Everett truly is.

B00288KNLS|5.0|\\"Great book, then as time went by, became a great movie. Of course like ALL book to movie transitions there are differences but Gaiman's vision and mood are captured wonderfully by Selick and crew. Bravo, bravo indeed. For parents who think this story too scary for their kiddies, the world we live in now is a lot scarier and you can't protect them from the real world. With that said, enjoy the delight that is Coraline, take the plunge down the rabbit hole and get scared together in a wonderful fantasy world. If it's too scary, the real world will be there when you turn the lights back on, trust me.\\"--from the desk of a father who got scarred with his kid and is now a lot better for it.
B000002VQQ|5.0|Patti Smith is the only rock star I can think of that has serious credentials as a published poet, and it comes through in her music. When it comes to cadences, dramatic imagery, and overall delivery - it's clear we're dealing with a veteran of many public poetry readings.    There was a buzz about her in New York art circles even in the late 60's. She made some interesting early acquaintances. Possibly the most important (in terms of her own eventual career direction) was her long relationship with Blue Oyster Cult keyboardist Allen Lanier. Patti co-wrote a handful of songs for the popular band over the years, starting on their second album \\"Tyranny And Mutation\\" (1973). Another was Sam Shepard, with whom she co-authored the play \\"Cowboy Mouth\\". Dylan went to one of her first poetry/rock band performances, and it's said to have inspired him to record \\"Desire\\" and put together his Rolling Thunder Revue.    Patti became steeped in all things rock 'n' roll. She briefly wrote abstract, impressionistic record reviews for various music publications - in which she extolled the virtues of personal favorites like David Bowie and Todd Rundgren. Given all this, it's not surprising that it took until '75 for \\"Horses\\" to come to fruition. It was worth the wait.    Of her first 4 albums, \\"Horses\\" is in many ways the best. I love hearing piano in a rock context, and this is the only one of the four that prominently displays Richard Sohl's elegant piano playing. The mash-ups of her own poetry combined with \\"Gloria\\" and \\"Land Of A Thousand Dances\\" are breathtakingly original and powerful. The double-tracked spoken word bits interwoven with her singing parts is a highly effective mood-conjurer. The fact that she attempts reggae-lite (on \\"Redondo Beach\\") and an extended dirge (\\"Birdland\\") further distinguishes this record from subsequent releases, which would be in a more straight forward rock vein. Featuring spot-on production by John Cale of the Velvet Underground - who was definitely the right man for the job.    After her fourth album, Smith took a long hiatus to concentrate on raising her children. Admirably, she emerged a different person. Later recordings are generally not as confrontational, and exhibit greater kindness and understanding. As much as I enjoy them, my preference is still the original four - especially \\"Horses\\" and \\"Easter\\" (though \\"Radio Ethiopia\\" and \\"Wave\\" both have a lot going for them, too).    In 1975 the New York singer/songwriter Elliott Murphy wrote a song about Patti on his third album \\"Night Lights\\", titled \\"Lady Stilletto\\". It contains these lines: \\"Her T-shirt's ripped with a passion/ Her mind's been raped by Rolling Stones/ She keeps her weight down by fasting/ On Jim Morrison's bones/ And when she's good she's a rock dream witch/ With Macbeth on lead guitar/ Just a ballad of a thin girl/ I really think she's gonna go far\\".    And so she did.
B000GUJYRE|3.0|This cycle deserves a solid C for both performance and recorded sound.  There is neither anything to crow about nor denigrate.  Haitink and the LSO cannot perform badly, and 1 or 2 star ratings here are unfair just as 5s are over the top.  A 4 . . . well, maybe a 3.5.  The sound of the SACD does not hurt any ears as one reviewer oddly stated, but the acoustic is dry as a bone, probably reflecting the studio venue in which the symphonies were recorded.  If you have a good surround processor, play them in stereo and create the ambience.  My personal favorites for performance are Norrington's for the 1st through 4th and 6th & 8th (with less than spectacular sonics, however), Ozawa's BSO performance on Telarc for the 5th, and the Dohnáyni Cleveland Orchestra for the 7th, also Telarc.  I still can't make up my mind on the 9th, although Dohnáyni's on Telarc is quite good.  Sadly, Shaw's version on Pro Arte is a sonic nightmare.
B001041JLE|5.0|I can't imagine someone not having Thriller in some form or another. I've had it in record, tape and cd (and multiple versions of the tape and cd). I have the remastered version but this 25th Anniversary  Casebook version is the best. Specifically, the new versions of  Wanna Be Startin Somethin (With Akon was really good), Billie Jean (Kayne West with a nice remix), Beat It (With Fergie which was a nice twist), P.Y.T (with Will.I.Am which is better than the original IMO) & even The Girl Is Mine (which was my least favorite on the original album but made better this time around). My favorite is a song that was excluded from the original album (& I don't see why it was they should have went for 10 tracks) For All Time.    You get the original nine songs, the little Vincent Price rap and the 6 new versions PLUS a DVD of the Thriller videos (Billie Jean, Beat It, Thriller and the Motown 25th Billie Jean performance). I've had these videos in many different forms (DVDs, on my pc etc) and this is the best those 4 videos ever looked. I was really impressed by how cleaned up and \\"new\\" looking these videos were in quality. For the lower price of $20.88 this was really a good deal. I've been wanting this cd for awhile anyway.    The casebook itself is nice. The inside is pretty much Thriller pictures plus some other pics of MJ for his different songs. With the exception of the original \\"The Girl Is Mine\\" (which I never really liked) this is the perfect version of Thriller released to date. Buy it! NOW!    P.S. - R.I.P MJ!
B0014I4KIK|5.0|...This is fabulous.  How entirely refreshing to hear something different from the usual same old, same old - and yet it's not.   Her style is a 60's throwback - bluesy, raw, gravely, Motown. She has an amazing voice and real talent.  Not contrived, not spiced up by some sound effect, she's the real deal.  I love it. Money well spent...hoping for more soon!
B000001EYO|3.0|Love this album although it falls short on some of the movies best songs. There's not even any Credence!! The good news is that you can purchase basically all of the other songs as mp3's on Amazon and other sites, and then construct the actual official soundtrack.

0316017922|4.0|Mr. Gladwell's overall thesis is fascinating. Basically, success and outliers is morea product of OPPORTUNITY than IQ; centuries-old culture, tons of practice and effort are high drivers of success and outliers. His chapters highlighting examples of Silicon Valley success and rise of Jewish-american lawyers in the 1970-1990s is tight, lucid, and darn fine reading. His chapters on impact of centuries-old culture on Appalachia and rice-paddy farming on math scores of Asians contain well-written arguments and are solid.    On the negative side, his chapter on Korean Airlines is out of place, and his tie to it in the conclusion is a quite imperfect leap. I think he wrote it and included in this book because he became fascinated with it but couldn't quite figure out how to dove-tail into his overall argument. It is a good supplemental example to the chapter about Appalachia culture, but its applications are well outside the rest of his subject matter or general argument lines. Honestly, the subject of cultural impact in aviation mishaps is well covered ground in a host of other places, from texts on aviation human factors to cross-cultural studies to govermental and commercial aviation training guidelines.     The final chapter is quite personal to him, but likely a throw-away in the grand scheme. If anything, it is a story on grandparents and parents CREATING opportunity situations for their off-spring (rather than circumstances and culture making the opportunity).    His chapter on American public schools is a bit preachy and smacks of NYC and urban elitism, but the overall thrust is solid: academic gains are made through a ton of practice, not dumping a truckload of money on the school system. That is a good lesson for the liberal fools who complain we haven't spent enough on education, and are convinced we can get out of the dive by throwing more tax dollars at it.     Alas, Mr Gladwell's school chapter that focuses on academics and music leaves no room for our own American culture that also likes to see physical achievement and organized sports. That is a huge void in his argument, and I have long-term concerns about teaching my own three sons to enjoy the physicality of life, especially outdoors, and to take good care of their bodies. It also roundly ignores a ton of research about the general sleep needs of adolescents, and makes no attempt to see if Barita (main character of the chapter) has long-term health issues by going on 5-6 hours a night.     But as I started out the review with, an absolutely fascinating read. The reason I can write a detailed review after one read is because of his excellent writing (and I read it cover-to-cover on a 4-hr plane cross-country plane ride).

1569242739|5.0|No, you can't eat the book, but you can eat the cupcakes!  After about six or seven batches of various cupcakes from this book, I can personally say that they're a hit at the office.  The cupcakes in this book put non-animal-friendly cupcakes to shame.  Telling an omnivorous  co-worker or friend that a cupcake is vegan doesn't have the same impact as telling them (for example) that it was made without milk, eggs or sugar filtered through charred animal bones - but it's still pretty cool.  The best part about the recipes in this, and all of the other books by this author, is that there's a sense of humor woven into each page, so you'll laugh, which keeps you going back for more.  I've purchased dry cookbooks before and they end up sitting on the shelf.  This book is anything but dry.  This decade is about telling good stories, and this contains plenty.  Here's a tip for a healthier cupcake experience: make a dozen, eat one or two, and immediately give the rest to friends.  Your waist line will thank you.

B00005JPAO|5.0|Helen Mirren won the 2006 Academy Award as Best Actress for her impeccable portrayal of Queen Elizabeth of England. \\"The Queen\\" maninly focuses on the death of the beloved Princess Diana and its aftermath and how the Queen wanted to treat her death as a private family matter instead of a public spectacle in which British Prime Minister Tony Blair wanted. The film depicts the public disaapproval over the Queen's decisions during this time and how she reacted to their opinions.<br /> Hellen Mirren is amazingly perfect in the role of the Monarch. Her speech patterns and mannerisms are impeccable and she shows that the Queen is in essence a real human being with real flaws and emotions.<br /> \\"The Queen\\" was budgeted at 15 million dollars and blew expectations for its success out of the water grossing over 100 million dollars world wide. Fans and critics hailed the moving for Mirren's searing portrayal of one of the most well loved figures in modern history.<br /> The DVD features an excellent \\"making of \\"The Queen\\" featurette\\" along with an informative commentary by Director Stephen Frears and writer Peter Morgan.<br /> Richard Roeper of \\"Ebert and Roeper\\" states \\"the acting is pinpoint perfect\\".

In addition, they can learn that caterpillars eat so that they can become a beautiful butterfly.  Moreover, young readers learn that what we consider destruction is part of nature.  In other words, if the caterpillar does become very hungry, he cannot become what he's suppose to be.  Most important, if children are not hungry for knowledge, they can't become what they suppose to become-butterflies

0805086846|5.0|Previous to reading this book I had an understanding of the white man's massacres of Native Indians, our unfair treatment of the Indian people, and of the broken treaties and promises that our government made with the various Indian tribes.  Even so, I found reading Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee a disturbing eye opener.  This book has more clearly brought home the harsh truth about how we settled the west than any other museum or documentary that I have ever seen.  In Red Clouds words, \\"They made us many promises, more than I can remember, but they never kept but one; they promised to take our land, and they took it.\\"  If you are interested in the plight of the American Indians as our country-expanded west, then I highly recommend this book.

0765350386|5.0|Wow! a few moments ago, I just finished reading the The Final Empire, and I just felt that I had to relay my feelings to you. This book is so incredible and beautiful, I am truly astounded by it's brilliance. Brandon Sanderson is a genius, truly. He is a master storyteller, and this book is beyond incredible. The world that he created within this book is so captivating and real and magical. It is truly one of the best stories i have ever experienced. I am utterly blown away. It has left me breathless and shocked, for it was filled with the deepest passion that was so fierce and wonderful, a passion that emanated from every sentence, every image, every movement and action and thought. It would be such a terrible shame if one were to pass up the opportunity to read this book. Reading this book was such a powerfully riveting experience, that filled me with a deep longing and an excitement that I have been yearning to feel. I did not want it to end, yet I am so utterly grateful that there are two more books left within the series! Tomorrow morning, I am running over to the bookstore and I shall buy them as fast as I can! The world that is this book is so...... incredible. It truly is. It was so fascinating and brilliant and unique. It was the most amazing adventure! And the best part was how everything came together, how everything fit and intertwined, finally. And how there was such a deep mystery, such a deep sense of feeling and beauty behind every moment, every character, and every description. I love this book fiercely, for it has truly changed me in this moment. It has empowered me, and has inspired me to be like the characters, fully, and to create and live with that sense of courage and strength, magic and adventure.     Please, read this book. It is like none other. It is truly brilliant, and incredible and beautiful! I love it so much. There is so much more that I wish to say, yet somehow I cannot form it into words. Just, read this book! you have no idea whatyou are missing....
B000XNZ7LG|5.0|I have know little about the way the Germans treated the Jewish people in that war. I learned a lot about how the Jewish people suffered, and my heart goes out to them all.<br />I could not take my eyes off the screen. How this man suffer and his family and all the Jewish people.<br />From the title of the movie I did not expect such an intense movie. My applause to the director and actors/actresses.<br />Great movie to learn from; lots of truth about what happen back then to the Jewish people.<br />I sent my oldest sister a copy of the DVD, The Pianist. I'm sure she's going to love it. It's a tear jerkier.<br /><br />May God Bless All The Jewish People That lost Family Due to the War.<br />Vivianne

1439157383|5.0|I was skeptical at first b/c I thought \\"too many characters to keep straight\\"....but WOW, was I proved wrong. It was necessary and refreshing to get so many character's perspectives. One minute you've made up your mind to hate one of the characters and you're screaming \\"How could you do this to your daughter?\\" and the next minute, the 'mom' in you is saying \\"Ohhhh....ok, I get it...it's scary that I can see your point, what would I do in this situation....\\" I would sit on that fence post and just as I start to climb over to one side, some event is told (at just the right moment) that makes me pull my foot back up. What a wobbly fence that was. Powerful Story. Powerful Characters. Awesome Read! I've been running around begging everyone I know to read it. Yes, there are sad parts, but it's not depressing. The whole novel is SO thought provoking!!
B000YAA68C|5.0|Quite enjoyable....loved it!! I've cried and laughed each time I watched this movie; I believe for about 7 times now! I decided to buy a copy so I can have my husband watch it with me. I also bought the CDs both John Powell(soundtrack) and Various Artists copies. I enjoy listening to them while I'm driving.
B00000AOUD|5.0|Imagine a fictional \\"show down\\" with Jethro Tull on one side (the *haters* of prog rock that they are), and all the prog 'greats' on the other side (Yes, ELP, Genesis etc.) The 'greats' put out a challenge: \\"Stop slamming us! You can't criticise our concept albums and epic songs if you can't even make one of your own!\\" Tull respond by playing TAAB. By the end, all the greats have tip-toed home, tail between their legs...<br /><br />Tull released this 40-minute song in 1972, meaning that it actually predates many other 'super-epics' such as Tales From Topographic Oceans and Karn Evil 9, both of which were released the following year. This song (/album) is a parody of progressive rock, which Ian Anderson conceived because he hated people calling Aqualung a \\"concept album\\". His goal was to blow concept albums out of the water by sending them up - he actually compares this album to Monty Python in the interview included on this disc. Therefore anyone who calls it 'pretentious' or who thinks Tull are 'taking themselves too seriously' has totally missed the point.<br /><br />How can you call a song pretentious when it contaions the lyrics \\"Fluffy duck, oh, fluffy duck. We walked through the maternity ward and saw 218 babies wearing nylons\\"???<br /><br />There will be many who hate a work of art for being what it is: \\"This play is too melodramatic\\"; \\"This pop song is too predictable\\"; \\"This landscape photo is too contrasty\\" - in other words, people who criticise the very aspects that the artist tried the hardest to achieve. Such is the case with TAAB - it's *meant* to be overblown and impenetrable; it's taking the mickey. The fact is that this super-epic is *not* really that 'progressive' at all - it lacks multi-instrumental virtuosity, it's signature changes are clunky, riffs are overly repetitive, and the keyboard work is muted... It has plenty of prog 'flourishes', of course, but Anderson (like Robert Fripp) hated the prog labels his band was being given, and he seeks to undermine all of them here. So what style is it, then? Anderson was right - there's really nothing to compare it to other than Monty Python.<br /><br />In my estimation, the song is a success on every (af)front. It is listenable and catchy, at least for people who really don't mind listening to extended pieces (and if you don't, Anderson makes very clear that he \\"really don't mind if you sit this one out\\" - in the opening line, in fact). It mixes the humourous with the sublime and haunts you with war narratives before letting you off the hook and singing about comic books. It is framed by a fictional and often hilarious small-town newspaper (nearly unreadable in CD-size unfortunately) and it moves in and out of the surreal and the tangible.<br /><br />In other words, it's a great listen and I love giving it a spin from time to time. It stands apart not only from Tull's other work, but from the Prog canon as a whole, since it is really a rock parody. The more that you visualise that roadies would literally walk across the stage wearing animal heads during performances, the more you will be able to appreciate what Anderson is trying to do here. He's trying to worm his way 'inside' the prog genre in order to wreck it from within. There may well be some filler and awkward moments throughout this song, but the simple fact that they set out to 'show up' super-epics by making a brilliant one of their own deserves true admiration.<br /><br />And the fact that they came so close to doing it so damn well gives it a firm five stars from me. That, and the fact that the \\"Soft Venus\\" section mesmerises me.here. So what style is it, then? Anderson was right - there's really nothing to compare it to other than Monty Python.

B001EN71CW|3.0|Likely you already know about \\"Firefly\\" so I'm not going to bore you with a review of the series (which I love).<br /><br />The original DVD release was kind of annoying in that you couldn't watch all the episodes at once.  Instead, you had to go to each episode's sub-menu and go from there.  That's gone with the Blu-ray release as you can watch all the episodes with the nifty \\"play all\\" feature.<br /><br />The HD version does look better than the original DVD release, though at times there is grain in the picture (as was in the DVD release when played on an HDTV).  This comes through mostly during scenes that aren't well lit.  It also comes into play during some fast-motion action sequences too.  It isn't bad, but it is noticeable especially after a moment where things look \\"shiny.\\"<br /><br />The extras are pretty much what came with the DVD release, though I believe there is one or two new small extras.<br /><br />The bad comes from the fact that the BD disables my player's resume feature completely.  What does this mean?  Simply put, it means that when I press \\"stop\\" on my fully upgraded Blu-ray player, pressing play again makes me go through the entire 30-seconds of loading, anti-piracy messages, and then finally the menu.  While this is true on quite a number of BD titles, this is the first one that does not have the compensation \\"bookmark\\" feature so that at least after you go through the annoyance of having to go through the load stuff again, you can then start back up at your bookmark.  As such, if you need to stop in mid-play, you better just press \\"pause\\" or be annoyed (unless you don't mind wasting time to get back to where you left off, to say nothing of trying to remember where you left off).<br /><br />So in upgrading your DVD set, you'll get an overall better picture, better sound, and you trade one annoyance with another.  Whomever came up with the idea of disabling a BD player's resume function should be punished.

B0015HOFZI|4.0|I am very happy with this item.  I didn't find the setup to be too difficult, although I feared having problems based on some of the other reviews.  I also wanted to provide a tip to those who ARE having problems...don't forget to take the cover off of the needle!  I don't mean to state the obvious, but at first I missed this small but important step, and I got a faint muffled recording like one of the other reviewers described.  It's an easy mistake to make!  My only other comment on this turntable and software is that it is not always able to correctly determine the end of a song.  I have some files that include two or more songs if the space between the songs on the album is small.  But this is really not too big a deal;  I'm pretty sure you can fix this with iTunes or other programs.
B000A0GYD2|5.0|I've always wondered why we don't have more TV series and movies about history. There are so many epic events in our history and film would be a great way to tell them. Fortunately, Tom Hanks et al rose to the challenge in retelling perhaps one of the greatest epics in our history - the race to the moon. I appreciate that the series took such care with historical accuracy rather than making another [[ASIN:0790731541 The Right Stuff]]-style movie.    For a TV series, this has great cinematography. It mixes historical documentary footage, black and white sequences, grainy \\"1960s-style\\" shots, and high quality computer generated scenes. They all flow seamlessly to give the viewer the sense of watching history, rather than just a TV show produced in the 1990s.    The only drawback is that the series starts with Kennedy's famous \\"moon speech,\\" rather than going back to Sputnik. I would love to have seen an episode dealing with Sputnik and the Eisenhower administration. Hopefully  some future filmmaker will take up this challenge.    On the 40th anniversary of the Apollo 11 moon landing, I hope every single person takes the time to watch this series and learn not only about one of our greatest accomplishments, but also about the potential for mankind to explore and overcome challenges.

0307266303|5.0|Born to Run, written in the gripping journalist style made famous by Jon Krakauer, makes running, a subject many find boring, absolutely thrilling.  He accomplishes this by infiltrating the mysterious Tarahumara Indian tribe and applying the secrets of their naturalistic, long-distance running culture to the modern world.  Along the way he helps us understand the burgeoning ultramarathoning culture, showing how these trail-running fanatics in the U.S. have developed many of the same dietary and running habits as the Tarahumara:  a diet heavy on fruits and vegetables and light on meat (eating like you're poor), a habit of running for the sheer joy of the experience rather than for the sake of competition, low-tech minimalistic running shoes, and a style of movement that replaces the heavy heel strike with the light forefoot strike of a barefoot runner.<br /><br />And if this isn't enought to stimulate your interest, McDougall's book features a mysterious American known as Caballo Blanco, who has chosen to live among the Tarahumarans and becomes obsessed with organizing a showdown between the most accomplished ultramarathoner of all time (Scott Jurek) and the best Tarahumaran runners on their home turf in Mexico's Copper Canyons.<br /><br />Born to Run is one of the most important books I've read in recent years, and I truly hope its popularity will stimulate greater interest in the most pure and natural of all sports.<br /><br />-Kevin Joseph (author of The Champion Maker)

There are also scenes clearly demonstrating  some of the great damage that has been wrought by mankind.    Although the first one and a half hour of the film should be required viewing for any of the few remaining global warming deniers, the last twenty minutes does leave the viewer with a slight glimmer of hope for our planet's future, so long as mankind will simply wake up and take action before it is too late.

0525421033|4.0|The three words that best describe this book are short, sweet, and beautiful. If I Stay takes place in Oregon, where a dusting of snow can close schools and cause car crashes--which is exactly what happens within the first twenty pages of the book. Mia's--the main character's--body is gravely injured, and she finds herself detached from it. Mia watches as her body is loaded into the ambulance. She sees herself in the hospital bed and watches her family and friends visit her and wonder if she will live.<br /><br />At one point, Mia hears one of the nurses speak to her grandparents:<br /><br />\\"You might think that the doctors or nurses or all this is running the<br />show,\\" she [the nurse] says, gesturing at the wall of medical equipment.<br />\\"Nuh-uh. She's running the show ...\\"<br /><br />Shortly after, Mia realizes that the nurse is right: She decides whether she stays or goes, lives or dies. If I Stay follows Mia through her memories and thoughts as she makes this difficult decision.<br /><br />I really enjoyed If I Stay. It's gentle, quiet, and even funny. The prose is clean and descriptive, and I had no problem suspending my disbelief as I watched Mia wander around outside her body; If I Stay is a wonderful balance of reality and magical realism.<br /><br />Mia is a dedicated cellist, her father used to be in a band, and her boyfriend, Adam, is a guitarist in an up-and-coming band. Music and the love of it permeate the novel. Moreover, the cast of characters, from the major to the minor, is fantastic, real, and vivid. Their relationships with one another are fully drawn; Mia's relationship with her family is warm and loving, and the love between Mia and Adam is genuine. I'm also a big fan of Mia's best friend, Kim. Some of my favorite scenes, however, involved Mia's parents, and If I Stay is as much about them as it is about her as they change their lives for their kids.<br /><br />If I Stay has its PG-13 moments as far as Mia and Adam are concerned, but these are handled with class: there are no overly descriptive scenes of love. Any crude language is used realistically, and there is no swearing for the sake of swearing. Mia is not terribly religious, and her musings are handled with grace.<br /><br />While lacking in constant suspense and occasionally slow-moving, If I Stay is worth the short time it takes to read this slim book. Although I didn't always feel an intense emotional connection with Mia, tears stung my eyes on more than one occasion. My recommendation? Take the journey with Mia as she grapples with love of music and Adam, family and friends; life and death and all the philosophical questions in between. You won't be sorry you did.scenes of love.

I new the horrors inflicted on trusting people if they considered islam just another religion ... I came from a population oppressed by islam. A very peaceful and trusting people ! Fair game for the invaders because they were not submitting to islam.  I am active now ! I ask questions all the time and I make a lot of people curious and/or uncomfortable. Especially muslims.

B001N18HOG|4.0|This Legacy edition of the Pearl Jam classic and my personal favourite album of theirs is the way all Legacy editions should be made; one that clearly surpasses the original and makes it a no-brainer to \\"upgrade\\".  In fact, this version pleasantly surprised me so much in exceeding my expectations that it made me feel grateful that there are still bands out there that care enough for their fans to want to give them quality material at all times.  I call this the Disney attitude as you may feel whatever you want about that company but you can never accuse them of poor quality products.  If only Jethro Tull would do the same and give us a similar treatment for \\"Aqualung\\" for example; Pink Floyd and \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\", BTO and \\"Not Fragile\\", I could go on and on....<br /><br />Anyways, having the original cd when it first came out years ago I had always felt that the mastering/mixing could be improved and I have been waiting for years for a better remastered/remixed version to surface and boy am I glad I waited!  Now we get both!  The remastered version is very good but I think the remixed version is even better!  It was like listening to a whole new album and it occured to me that this new mix would still be a hit had it been released today sounding head and shoulders better than any of the \\"new\\" music out there; why listen to Coldplay when this is so much better anyway?<br /><br />The only knock on this is the lack of an insert or some such material with more information on the remixing process by the producer or the band's comments/interviews etc as this Legacy version is pretty sparse with just the very well done gatefold mini-lp sleeve replica (mlps) design with good, hard and thick/sturdy quality cardboard and the inner sleeves and nothing else except of course the brilliant cd content.  The Motley Crue (and Megadeth) remasters actually had Crue-members discussing the background to the remasters and what they currently feel about the albums and the history etc which I thought was a nice touch.  One Crue member actually thought \\"Theatre Of Pain\\" was one of his least favourite of their albums which kinda shocked me but tidbits like this from band members show that they care enough about connecting with the fans which I truly appreciate and hope more bands take personal involvement in these type of projects and remember just who it was that put them there in the first place; always nice for fans to feel appreciated for their support.<br /><br />Still, given the rest of the package, this is one hell of a great idea and is certainly value for money for the upgrade if you have the original version.

B0021MFAJ6|4.0|I remember when I first bought this album on cassette tape at least 16 years ago that I was really taken by how good the guitar playing was as it was about the time of Buddy Guy's revival and Robert Cray and it seemed the Blues was having it's day in the sun once again albeit as it turned out a brief stint at that. I was very impressed by the mostly instrumental tour de force of the title track and I remember wanting to learn the whole track by heart having recently picked up the guitar and then realising just how much practice that it would take just to sound halfway as good as the record.<br /><br />That cassette has since been lost and now years later I find myself listening to this mini-lp replica sleeve (mlps) version and realising that this album has aged very well indeed and that good Blues is indeed timeless.  The remastering job on this album is good and the bonus tracks are a plus with track 11 giving us a chance to hear Stevie speak about how he approaches playing the guitar going with feel more than strict theory.  Other than \\"Tin Pan Alley (aka Roughest Place In Town)\\" we get to also hear how good Stevie was as a live performer with the live tracks \\"Testify\\", \\"Mary Had a Little Lamb\\" and \\"Wham!\\" rounding out the rest of the bonus tracks which in my mind add to the overall enjoyment of the album.<br /><br />It always amuses me when people (usually non-musicians)try to take pot shots at guitarists saying this one is better than that one or this one is overrated etc when you never see the musicians themselves say these things.  I remember reading Eric Clapton saying that for every one like him, 20 others that are better exist who have yet to be discovered.  Stevie Ray will always be Stevie and his brand of music and excellent phrasing will always make him a giant of the genre and true musicians are happy to leave it at that.  Being a guitarist myself and knowing just how hard it is to do what Stevie does, I don't need any convincing that his was a magical talent and that we have lost a brilliant musician at the height of his musical prowess.<br /><br />As far as debuts go, this is a very, very good one and this mlps version with remastered sound quality and an 8-page glossy insert containing an essay by Michael Ventura as well as another 16-page booklet containing all the lyrics in both English and Japanese although the cardboard design isn't the best I've ever seen is still a good way to remember the man.<br /><br />Recommended.hat we have lost a brilliant musician at the height of his musical prowess.

B001KVZ6FM|5.0|UP, Pixar's latest animated feature, is just delightful. But how do you go about extolling the movie's virtues without giving away its surprises? Like the kid at the beginning of the movie, you don't try to conquer the immovable force; you work around it.<br /><br />The one clue I can give away - because it's the movie's heavily hyped premise - is that Carl Fredrickson, a gruffy old widower (voiced with gruffy old charm by Ed Asner), miraculously inflates enough balloons to use his house as an aircraft. Soon, he finds himself reluctantly sharing his ride with a short-attention-spanned kid named Russell.<br /><br />I'll also mention a couple of other items that can gauge your potential interest in the movie. One is a gag that is a take-off on a famous painting - perhaps too inside of an inside joke, but typical of Pixar's cheery attempts to appeal to viewers of all ages.<br /><br />Also, part of the plot involves Carl's long-held wish to meet a Lindbergh-type adventurer named Charles Muntz (Christopher Plummer!). This is another in-joke that's even vaguer than the first one. Cartoon historians know that Walt Disney started in the cartoon biz by creating Oswald the Rabbit for producer Charles Mintz, who then greedily stole the rights to Disney's creation. This gives you a pretty good idea where the ostensible hero Muntz stands in the scheme of things.<br /><br />Beyond that, I can only offer you some enticing clues about the characters. There's a dog who's the leader of his pack and in menacing beyond measure, until he opens his mouth and gets one of the movie's biggest laughs. There's a huge, awkward bird that is a big laugh-getter at first. Then she becomes a real enough character that - at least in the audience I was in - when she's injured, she elicits screams of fright worthy of Bambi's late mother.<br /><br />There's surprising, heartfelt emotion, vivid imagery (you can almost touch the landscapes and skies), and a music score by Michael Giacchino that's practically a character in the movie - particularly in a thoughtful montage that takes Carl from childhood to widowhood.<br /><br />There aren't many (or at least not enough) live-action movies that are engrossing as this cartoon. Pixar Studios has gotten to be one of those movie icons that shouldn't even have to deliver a premise to get funded anymore. The moneymen should just shut up, hand over the money, and trust they'll get a product that will appeal to everyone.<br /><br />UP is only the second Pixar feature to get a PG rating, only for mildly intense imagery and action - nothing off-color in the least.

The story then dissolves into mindless killing, explosions, chases and mutilations before ending without tying anything together.  It seems to be an obvious set up for a sequel.  I felt like I had wasted my time when I finished the book.
B000A2RRF4|5.0|I just got this today and have watched it three times so far.  It is awesome.  I 100% recommend this DVD for any MJ fan.  The dancing is fantastic and the show is full of energy.  I will probably wear this DVD out and have to buy another one.
B00127RAJY|5.0|This is such a fabulous workout that fits right into my hectic schedule!!! I love the fact that I can get a whole workout in (warm up, workout, and cool down) in less than 30 minutes! I ordered 3 pound weights to go along with the 30 Day Shred.  3 pounds doesn't seem like much, but WOW!!! They really get heavy mid workout!  I use 2 pounds for most of the exercises in the video and use the 3 pounds for the bicep curls and chest flies. Jillian really has answered my workout need with this video! I LOVE IT and it is VERY challenging!
B0000029LG|5.0|I bought this one because it has some of his older music and it has the newer music, earth song, etc... that I really like.  I love it and I think it is a great CD to own.  I was pleasantly surprised that the last song is \\"Smile\\".
0671042858|4.0|The flesh eating zombie never showed up but this book pleasantly suprised me.  Trisha, the nine-year old main character is strong, funny, and believeable in an insane situation.  King shows both his love for New England and the Red Sox but knowledge of either of those things aren't needed to enjoy this suspenseful tale.
B00284BMBM|5.0|Im a huge fan of Daughtry and pre ordered the cd the first chance I got. When I got it, I couldnt stop listening to it. The music is really good and catchy. This cd is as good if not better then their first cd. Daughtry is the hottest band right now.
1439157383|5.0|Wow!!!! Although I saw the movie first and thought i was going to be a little bored reviewing the story again while reading the book.....I was dead wring! The book went into so much more detail and surprised me after every page. I couldn't believe how great the book turned out!!! I suggest this book to anyone with a heart. One of the best books I've ever read.
159102594X|5.0|The good guys aren't all good and the bad guys aren't all bad. The lines are blurred and the more you read the more you learn perception can change some things. There is no white shining knight, there is no pure ancient wizard, and least of all no helpless damsel in distress. Gritty, hilarious, and real. These are your old fantasy characters all matured up and trying to live in a real world full of pain, lies, and half truths.

0440244870|1.0|This book is in no way funny. I had been wanting to read it for quite some time now and now wished I never would have bothered. The book is extremely slow and I never really became that interested. I thought it would pick up the more I read, but I was very wrong. It felt like homework to me because I never really WANTED to read it, just felt like I had to. However, I have heard the movie is much better.
B001IXSU8M|5.0|From the first day i purchased this album, I haven.t been able to put it down one day. even if for just one song, this cd has become synonymous with my everyday routine. the day is not complete without me listening to one of lady gaga.s songs...i.e singles and whatnot. she has become synonymous with todays pop culture and obsession with everything trendy by doing what she loves and enjoying every minute of it. none of the songs are bad. you can go from hot.dance track to love songs. her lyrics will haunt your every thought. she will abscond with your soul and you WILL not want it back!
B002436WFI|4.0|Anyone who undertakes a movie of a [[ASIN:0061020710 wildly popular book]] faces at least one major challenge: the complete certainty of getting it wrong. Fans everywhere have their own mental images of all the major characters and scenes, and at least some of those images are sure to differ from the movie's. So, I was not surprised to see that this Rincewind wasn't my Rincewind. Tim Curry (was he really [[ASIN:B00004U8P9 Frank-N-Furter]] all those years ago?) made a decent sneering badguy, but only so-so senior wizard.<br /><br />I was happily suprised, however, by the way they handled my all-time favorite Discworld character: the Luggage. Twoflower was dead on, and Cohen and Bethan were pretty close (I mean, not just close to each other), and Jeremy Irons did for Vetinari what Alan Rickman did for Snape. And ... well, lots of things came out well enough for a rousing good time.<br /><br />Perhaps some of Pratchett's conversational sparkle dimmed just a bit on the way to the small screen. It happens, I guess, and the nigglers are going to niggle no matter how good it is. On the whole, the BBC did a very nice job with the relatively large budget applied to this made-for-TV production.<br /><br />-- wiredweird
B001FB4W0W|3.0|I read all the Sookie Stackhouse books, but these videos are way too hard core for me. The episodes do follow a lot of the story line, but too much time is spent on Sookie's brother's escapades - no other word to describe it but PORN! Personally, between the horrific language (I know - it's HBO, what was I thinking?) and the soft porn exploding every other minute....oh my. Sorry, just too much for me.
B0017V7GTY|4.0|The Gaslight Anthem remained under my radar until earlier this week. I've never herd of this group, the rave reviews, nor the media pitting them up in legendary leagues in a matter of weeks. In other words, I never herd of their rise to fame. So going on the music alone I can say they are great!<br /><br />From what I've accumulated, the Gaslight Anthem is an alternative rock band with two studio albums under their belt, a hand full of singles, and already a lot of recognition. Why does this music stand out so much? Aside from being blatantly catchy, they also bring forth as much attention to the lyrics as they do the tunes.<br /><br />These twelve tunes have more then enough to offer. People mention their tenderness to earlier artist ranging from Bruce Springsteen (hey he did appear at Hyde Park with them), to even 90's post-grunge. I see some Neil Young in them myself, but hey it's still an interesting combination.<br /><br />You know a group has done well when indie snob site Pitchfork Media gives it favorable marks. Or when it sells out faster then a Sigur Ros album over at Vinyl Collective. How's the music?<br /><br />From the first tracks soft intro (\\"Great Expectations\\") into an abrupt burst of energy you know the ropes, but they just do it so right. Tone wise you kind of know what to expect, chord-twitching tracks, burnt twangy guitars, vocals similar to a U2, the Cure, or Killers album. Bumpy bass drums, little bit of echo on the mic. The dynamics come as no surprise, while not a `dynamic' album you get your soft, loud, soft stuff.<br /><br />Songs build up, songs end fast, other songs offer a pop punk vibe (the bass suggests this more so then the guitar). This album isn't an explosion of something new it's a finespun take on a genre so perpetually overdone that it's become jaded. So we thank the few artists who take the incentive to cleanse us, remind of why a certain field of music seemed so right.<br /><br />My pick off the album is the ambiguous \\"Film Noir\\". While it loses grip at certain points of the song the endurance makes up for it. The story is told, the music is throttling, the energy is their, doesn't have to be even amounts.<br /><br />I purchased the vinyl LP version (standard black vinyl press), not impressive sound wise. The CD counterpart should suffice. The vinyl version has a few sought after color variants pressed in small amounts, seek them if you want it on vinyl for aesthetic and collectibles, this album is intimate and makes sense for this format, but it's production holds it back. So for now the CD version will make for good late night car rides. All formats whether it be MP3, CD, or Vinyl are relatively cheap. Can't pass this one up!the song the endurance makes up for it.

B0011Z3DAC|4.0|I was a huge fan of Hybrid Theory as it got me into Linkin Park even remember my brother buying an advance copy at a record store before it hit local stores! I liked Meteroa and Reanimation but when I heard Minutes to Midnight I was amazed/shocked by how LP have changed alot. For those who want to old Linkin Park go back and listen to their first album but for those who want a more mature Linkin Park then get this album. I was disappointed by a few tracks other than the single \\"What I Done\\" as LP like to throw the F word alot in a few tracks and thats not really needed. You either hate this album or love it but hopefully Linkin Park will continue to evolve but this album just feels like it was rushed or overproduced too much like they wanted to get radio airplay which ain't bad cause you need singles to sell your album and make videos for them.

B000L53D4O|4.0|My daughter got this toy as a gift when she was 6 months old. Before she could walk we used it as an activity center and she would crawl up the face and flip the items. I used the little animal flip tabs to teach her what sounds each animal makes.    Once she began standing she used it as a walker. She is now 3 and her 8-month-old brother has taken it over. He loves spinning the wheels and playing with the activities. The toy looks like new even though we have used it outside on the driveway as well as in the house. Soon he'll be ready to stand and use it. I love this toy.
B0029NY9YO|1.0|This movie was TERRIBLE.      I went to see this movie with a totally open mind really wanting to like it but I came out convinced that this had to be the worst film I ever saw in my life. Overall the plot was long, tedious, and boring. At times it bordered on the ridiculous. Every now and then I questioned why some scenes were even in the movie because they added absolutely nothing to the plot or to progress the story along. Additionally some of the characters' behaviors were just kind of . . . off.  For example,  the other heroes' strange affinity for and loyalty to the Comedian makes no sense to me when you observe the kind of person he was. Every act of cruelty, bullying, assault, and grievous behavior on his part is just shrugged off by the others as if it were nothing. . . it's just the Comedian being the Comedian . . . oh well, he's such a rascal, so what if he might potentially slit my throat while I'm sleeping.       Overall the movie is just another look at the dismal, dark, and self destructive nature of human beings with some questionable heroes thrown in. At best though, the directing, CG work, and editing were interesting, but in general I would say this movie is nothing worth raving about, nothing worth paying for, and nothing worth watching even if it were free.        Perhaps for people who have read and are fans of the comic book, this movie would be enjoyable, but I don't think one should have to read the comic book in order to enjoy the movie. A movie should be able to stand on its own two feet, which this one doesn't. It fails miserably.
B001K3JF7K|4.0|I am a fan of Diana, but I especially like her earlier releases. Once I heard her piano chops on Stepping Out, there was no turning back. What I wish for now is to bring back more of those chops to her CD output.  On this album though, I was mesmerized by her subtle styling on the You're My Thrill track. There, the orchestra added the perfect mood to emotion being put forth. Sometimes, the orchestra gets in the way when used for other songs she does.
032147404X|5.0|This book is awesome along with all the other Scott Kelby books. I would highly recommend all of them. I read this thing daily to get ideas and learn how to take better shots. A must have book!!!
B000002BYD|4.0|This is Pearl Jam at their most honest.  This is also Pearl Jam at their most uncertain.  Eddie Vedder sounds distincly like a man rather than the howling God of \\"Ten\\" and \\"Vs.\\"  Even the guitars sound like they are asking questions.  \\"Do the Evolution\\" could have easily been turned into a fist pumping, testosterone injected thrasher.  Instead the guitars are muted and muffled and Vedder sings every line as if it were a sick joke.  I leave you to decide which deliverly is more powerful.  As someone who has been a Pearl Jam fan most of my life, I have always considered the band's one indispensible quality to be their sincirety.  No where is this quality more clear than on \\"Yield.\\"
0307455874|5.0|The Audacity of Hope was written by a relatively young senator with great energy and a power to connect to people. It was also written by a man who clearly was planning a presidential run in the near future, and as all such books has a winsome, in-a-perfect-world tone that aligned with Obama's values that he espoused throughout his campaign. The book itself is a treatise on how Obama feels about the major issues of our time, including both political issues like the economy and foreign policy, as well as personal values like family and faith. Each chapter is bookended by anecdotes from his experience as he is getting started at college, different jobs, and up to his senate campaign. The book is a pleasure to read, with each issue being broken down into easily understandable components, and charmingly written in Obama's elevated yet self-derisory tone. Taken for what it is, it is a refreshing take on American politics by a sincere and major figure. The only thing that works slightly against it, however, is the fact that Obama now is our president, and in the cold light of day cannot perhaps legislate all the interesting and hopeful changes he comes up with here. Still though, to have ideas for a more prodigal world is important enough, and Obama deserves substantial credit for that.
1433503794|5.0|I'm 22 and have only very recently met a Christian who could explain very reasonably what faith means to him and I could see what light it brings to his life. Long story short, I wanted to delve deeper into what this faith is about, so I tried to find the best study bible.    I don't own any other study bibles, but for the first reading I find this ESV Study Bible absolutely satisfying. ESV text is very readable even for a foreigner (I'm Czech) and the accompanying notes and commentaries are deep and insightful for those who look for religious as well as academic stuff. Very often I find myself just fascinated by the hidden meanings that suddenly come to light. The illustrations, maps and charts are helpful too. Perhaps for the more ambitious students there are various multi-volume commentary sets, but given this book's size (almost 3,000 pages) and depth I would recommend it to any beginner who wants to understand the Scripture in a deeper way and not be put off by too much detail or extreme profundity.    I ordered the 'TruTone, Brown/Cordovan, Portfolio Design' which is the most pleasing format to my eye. Contrary to what other reviewers write, I haven't found any print defects nor blurred pages. The binding is very sturdy. However it's true that near the center the pages are a little bit wavy (though until I read it from a comment I wouldn't even notice it or consider it a defect). And the pages are extremely thin, like cigarette paper, which makes it a bit harder to read, because you can see through at least two pages. But if the pages were any thicker the whole book would be extremely thick, so I suppose this is the best compromise.    And last but not least, you gain access to an online version of the whole book with notes, maps and everything, so you can search through the text and access it from anywhere.    Overall, this book has met all my expectations and more, I can only recommend it to everyone.    EDIT: A few months later, I have also tried the Life Application Study Bible. I suppose I'd rather recommend that one for the first time reader. Especially one who reads it to satisfy his personal search for God and a desire of a life change. They are both VERY good, but the LASB (whatever translation you choose) is more practical and \\"down-to-earth\\", while ESV explains more in depth but from a rather academic/scholarly/linguistic point of view.
B000002BFL|5.0|I read recently that there are actually two different Bruce Springsteen's.  The first being the folk singer whose social concerns, lyrical ability and commanding narrative style are on par with Dylan.  The other is \\"The Boss\\", the man who Bruce becomes on stage during one of The E Street Band's loud and boisterous three-hour concerts.  Both excellent for their own reasons.  I've been listening to Bruce since I was 8 (I'm now 22) and I have to say I completely agree with this.      \\"The Ghost of Tom Joad\\" is an album that belongs to Bruce when he has set his \\"Boss\\"-self aside for a bit.  It is a quiet, penetrating album that weaves it's spell through folk-narratives and mid-west tales.  Bruce isn't particularly energetic here, and don't put this album on expecting to dance, or have a good time.  But do put it on to see why Bruce has gained so much acclaim for his song-writing because he's not just a rock star, he's a storyteller.    Pair this album up with \\"Nebraska\\" and \\"Devils & Dust\\" and you'll be in good shape.  I promise.
B00284BMBM|3.0|It's been quite a while since Daughtry burst onto the scenes, with a fantasic debut album.    Finally with their follow up, it is much of the same strong vocals from Lead singer Chris Daughtry, with songs full of the usual pop/rock swagger.    Nice power balads in 'Life after You' and 'Open Up your Eyes', rocking out with 'You don't Belong' and 'Every time you Turn Around'.  And an interesting Country sidestep with 'Tennesee Line'.    It's a sold, strong album, but in my opinion not as good as their first amazing album.  Definitely worth a listen though as it's a 'grower'.

B0000648WZ|4.0|I have to admit I didn't like this movie when I first saw it. I found it way too cheesy and strange, and it was difficult for me to get into the movie. I'm not sure when, but this film really grew on me and I love it now.   The film's Federation, is akin to Nazis and Disney joining forces and having taken over the world. The totalitarian government uses cheesy blatant propaganda throughout the movie and the characters all seem naive or brainwashed in accepting the way things are. There are so many unique things about this movie, its hard to list them all. For starters. there is a coed shower scene which is actually an important scene, that informs you of many of the rights and privileges you acquire by enlisting in federal service.   Probably the weirdest thing about the movie, is despite all the violence, there is a surprising lack of foul language. The dialogue throughout out the movie, is often cheery, cheesy and very Disney esqe. It seems like it belongs in a g rated movie. Its totally at odds with the hardcore, totalitarian government and the messages it sends.  The movie is full of action and the special effects are well done. Plot wise the movie jumps around a bit, and unfortunately two of my favorite characters in the film are killed with 5 minutes of each other.  The movie hints at the idea that humans actually started the conflict with the bugs, and given the totalitarian government, that's likely the case. A large number of the characters introduced in the movie are killed or maimed at some point. Despite being set in the future, there is a world war 2 type flair to the movie. The movie is a very entertaining look at how people would live and behave in futuristic Nazi type regime.

B000001GAO|4.0|I currently own 6 versions of Mozart's Requiem, and I'll review them here.<br /><br />1. My current favorite is Bohm's: [[ASIN:B000001G5A Mozart: Requiem]]. It possesses all the virtues of Karajan or Bernstein's, with the recording quality enjoyed by Abbado's. Highly recommended. Back-story: I though six versions were enough; then a friend criticized this recording, saying, \\"Bohm conducts Mozart as if he were Brahms.\\" Well, that, I thought, is exactly the how I like it! If you don't, well, then skip this one, as well as the Bernstein and the Karajan.<br /><br />2. My former favorite was Bernstein's: [[ASIN:B000001GAO Mozart - Requiem / McLaughlin, M. Ewing, Hauptmann, Bayerischen Rundfunks, Bernstein]]. (It is also availabe in a box set of Bernstein's recordings of Mozart, which I'd heartily recommend to anyone: [[ASIN:B000TM0H66 Mozart: The late Symphonies; Great Mass in C minor; Requiem [Box Set]]].) I cannot say that this is perfect, but it is the way I like to hear the Requiem: slow, stately, and solemn. I don't think anyone excited about the principles of period performance is going to like it, but I believe if Mozart had the resources available to a modern orchestra, he'd want to hear something like this.<br /><br />3. About 15 years ago I decided to learn about classical music - not because I actually enjoyed it, but because I wanted to be a cultural person. One of the first recordings that I genuinely loved was Karajan's [[ASIN:B000001GBY Mozart: Requiem]]. I actually prefer the music here to Bernstein's: it is even more beautiful and moving. It hurts me to subordinate this to anything, but unfortunately this recording is older and fuzzier than Bernstein's. The individual singing parts and instrumental lines are much clearer in the Bernstein. If you have a decent modern stereo system, or fancy headphones, you would want to hear the Bernstein at least occasionally for its clarity. Also, to be fair to Bernstein, there are moments where I prefer his version. (Be careful. If you live abroad this recording is also available with a Byzantine icon on the cover. But there is at least one other recording by Karajan of Mozart's Requiem, which is not the same as this one, and I don't own. Pay attention to the names of the soloists and you'll be fine. DG seems dedicated to fooling people into purchasing multiple editions of the same recording.)<br /><br />4. Abbado: [[ASIN:B00001X59K Mozart - Requiem / Mattila, Mingardo, Schade, Terfel, Berlin Phil., Abbado]] This recording is by far the most clear. If you want to hear the distinct parts, the instrumentation, as if you were standing on the podium, this is the recording for you. It is played faster than I like, but it retains most of the emotional power. Comparing this recording to Bernstein's is very instructive: I'm sure Abbado took fewer liberties, and purists will prefer this one.<br /><br />5. In Brilliant Classic's [[ASIN:B000BLI3K2 Mozart Edition: Complete Works (170 CD Box Set)]], it is conducted by Nicol Matt and performed by various Dutch artists. The music is not recorded as well as the Bernstein or Abbado above, and it is taken too fast. Yet I still enjoy listening to this one for contrast.<br /><br />6. Gardiner: [[ASIN:B0000040YU Mozart: Requiem / Bonney, von Otter, Blochwitz, W. White, Gardiner]]. This is a recording only a mother - or a very serious enthusiast of period performance - could love. It is played far too fast, the instrumentation is much too thin. I cannot enjoy this, and I don't think I've sat all the way through it more than twice. (Notice that the enthusiastic reviewers of this one talk about \\"accuracy\\" and \\"authenticity\\" and so on rather than \\"beauty\\" or \\"power.\\" Well, that's their thing, and I'm glad they have a recording to love. But it doesn't work for me.)<br /><br />I hope to consider more as my collection grows. If you have a favorite or one that you think I'd like, please let me know in the comments.abroad this recording is also available with a Byzantine icon on the cover.

1595141715|4.0|Clay comes home one day to find a package waiting for him.  Excited to see what it holds, he opens it to find cassette tapes.  When he listens, he hears something he can't believe.  Hannah, the girl who committed suicide, says that he and twelve other people caused her death.  They are the thirteen reasons. Barely believing what he hears, he listens, and he finds out things about himself and others in his community that he never would have thought of.<br /><br />I can't honestly say that I \\"enjoyed\\" this book, not in the traditional sense, anyway.  I didn't finish the book and say, \\"Oh, that was a really cool book!\\" smile, and move onto something else.  It was raw and emotional, and it made me have this sick feeling in the bottom of my stomach.  This book was full of suspense, for me.  Halfway through the book, I a part of me wanted the story to be some sick joke.  I didn't want Hannah to be dead.  Maybe she just wanted to teach some people a lesson and disappeared for a couple weeks. I was thinking this even though I knew it wasn't true.<br /><br />I didn't really like Hannah that much.  If I had met her, I probably wouldn't have liked her and instead been one of the people who believed all those rumors about her.  This book made me think of the way I treat other people.  Aren't I a bit quick to believe what others tell me about people I don't take the time to know, instead of finding out for myself?  Even though I didn't like Hannah, in a way, I could sympathize with her.  Have we not at one time or another felt completely alone?<br /><br />As I was nearing the end of the book, I couldn't see how it would end in a way that I would feel like the story had come to a close.  I read the final chapter, still not seeing what could come out of such an event.  However, in the last two or three pages, I felt like everything had come to a close. When I finished the book, I closed the book, and felt like the story was done.
B00127RAJY|5.0|This video is amazing. There are three workouts level one, two, and three. Each level contains a warmup, three circuts, and a cool down. Each circut contains three minutes of strength training, two minutes of cardio, and one minute of abs. Each level is hard with no time to stop in between moves. But it has to be hard because it is only twenty-two minutes long. This may be hard for people who aren't use to exercise, but after about five days on level one you will get use to it. You can feel all of your muscles strengthening and it gets your heart pumping.

B001W63DX2|5.0|As huge Iron Maiden fan growing up, I have lossed interest in Maiden when Adrian Smith left the band. Ever since the reunion they still haven't quite won me over till this DVD came out.    Into the first minute of the movie I got chills like listening to Piece of Mind for the first time.  The two disc set is very well put together.  The director did an amazing job with all of it.  The concert DVD is top notch and the sound quality is better than anything that they have put since the reunion.  If they could record a new CD this sound quality with heavy guitar sound and let Bruce write all of the lyrics (via his solo stuff), Maiden would have a hugely successful album.
B000ZEE3I6|4.0|I have enjoyed all six Harry Potter films, but this one ranks among the  very best in my opinion. There wasn't nearly as much action as I expected and I heard that some major scenes were cut (the final battle and a funeral being the major ones), but the characters and story had me captivated for the nearly 2 and 1/2 hour running time. The CGI was convincing and the music score was much better than expected, though I do miss what John Williams did with the first three movies. They should have at least used his epic theme more than the few seconds at the start. There was also plenty of humor to help balance the mood of the film, because this Potter film is very dark.<br /><br />All the young actors have gotten better and better with each passing movie. I really enjoyed the addition of the new teacher played brilliantly by Jim Broadbent. He made for quite a fascinating character.  It was also a treat to see more of the great Alan Rickman as Snape, but sadly many characters from previous movies are only given a few lines. At least they have kept all the same actors over the years, no matter how small the role.<br /><br />Overall, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince is one of the better films I've seen this year and is worth the time of anyone, no matter your age. Now I'm really looking forward to the two part finale due out in 2010 and 2011.

B0000DJZ8R|5.0|This is one of the all time great classic movies. Henry Fonda plays a terrific character. This movies is set during the great depression, one of the saddest times in American history. Even though this is a fictional movie it could have very well been true, according to my father who lived during the Great Depression. This is a movie we will watch over and over.
B001P9KR8U|4.0|This is review No. 330.  I guess everything that needs to be said has been.  Although this movie is sometimes hard to watch with so much violence, especially against children, it is a certainly a cinematic masterpiece and one of the most original movies I have ever seen.  The sound is fantastic.  You cannot watch this using your TV speakers.  It needs a good stereo system.  One more thought.  I hope this movie does not generate a bunch of copycats.  There is too much violence and that is why I give it only 4 starts.
0061537969|2.0|The Art of Racing in the Rain is an OK read. Not fabulous or surprising in any way. Having the dog, Enzo, be the narrator, was an interesting strategy but wore thin long before the end.
B001KVZ6F2|2.0|This movie is amateur in every way. Amateur production, amateur screen play, amateur acting, amateur character development.     I'm sorry. Clint Eastwood has the right like anyone else to make a movie, giving new actors (including his son), screenwriters, and even musical and cinematographers a chance to be involved with a big screen production, but the chances are high that you'll end up with a film resembling something from theater 101.    Show me sad timid Asian boy. (actor drops his head)  Show me angry, black wanna-be gangster. (actor uses slang and lots of profanity).  Show me angry Asian wanna-be gangster. (actor uses slang and lots of profanity with Asian accent)    You get the picture...    This could have been a great movie. It would have been a perfect opportunity to explore racial tension in a slightly different setting with different demographics, but with such sophomoric acting and production, it's just not there.    Catch this one on cable or on a plane ride, but don't waste your time or money buying or renting this film.
1401307787|3.0|John Kabat-Zinn didn't start with Buddhism. He started with America, the place where the establishment of liberty justifies, enables, and confuses the pursuit of happiness. At some point, big cars, big houses, and big stressors don't feel like happiness; they feel like a barren death wish. Enter Thoreau, enter Whitman, enter Jon Kabbat-Zin: It's time for a trip to the interior, not for mystical experience, but to recover liberty as a state of awareness, the whole point to begin with.<br /><br />Kabat-Zinn is a doctor turned philosopher turned doctor again, developing the Buddhist practice of mindfulness into a remedy for stressful living. It's all here: the life experiences, the short tips on practice, the understanding of loss and the pining for new experience, the possibility of being in a way that opens up the moment to a radical freedom. The problem isn't the idea or the methodology. It's the writing.<br /><br />Occasionally Kabat-Zinn is a master of sublime understatement (\\"Standing meditation is best learned from trees.\\") He also understands his patients'/readers' maladies and constructs a gentle bedside manner. But sometimes it feels as if a quarter of the prose is in the shape of questions that don't need to be answered (an entire paragraph of questions-with-understood-answers on p. 131). And the use of the metaphysical, especially in the \\"tips,\\" make the most difficult of undertakings seem like simple next steps (\\"See if you can give yourself gifts that are true blessings, like self-acceptance.\\")<br /><br />Don't get me wrong: This book is full of important statements and observations, not only about a particular to way to be, but about the world that envelops and structures being. Just be prepared for mindless judgments and deep yoga breaths when the philosopher's brilliant perceptions drift into the doctor's wordy empathy.
0061231401|5.0|I would have never had this read nor learned of this author without Glenn Beck's interviewing him on his show and telling of the book.  Certainly to one like me, the mention of ancient prophecy of Malachy speaking of forecasting popes sent me to the bookstore.<br /><br />It has all the ingredients of good thriller writing, develop multiple key players early with untied events, then slowly build up the plot, ending at points where the reader yells, \\"not yet, tell me more.\\"  So we read on.<br /><br />This work certainly did this well and as many reviewers opine is Rollin's M.O. weaving tales of Druids and Celts and Norsemen and Dark Madonnas et al.  The reader begins to conjugate how it will all play out and who my be betraying whom.<br /><br />Some of the events do seem to stretch reality, as many have suggested, allowing the bombing of a major Italian architectural artifact, but let's realize this is fiction, and this reviewer enjoyed the romp and the sophisticated integration of all the research the author accomplished, and then let's you in on what this was in an addendum at the end.<br /><br />I will seek out some of the rest of Rollins' work, it's that good for an avid reader like myself who typically stays with the dry, boring, non-fiction side of the aisle.

0670033049|4.0|I was beyond excited to be reading this book.  I had never read Steinbeck before, and I was itching to start.  Well, let me say, it was a difficult thing to do.  Steinbeck's style is interesting.  He's not so much verbose as he is long-winded.  You won't find the abundance of adjectives that characterize Fitzgerald's works, but you're going to find a lot of sentences.  As such, the story moves at a plodding pace.  Now, considering that the story also spans roughly three generations, well... It makes for quite a long read.    But if you can get over the pacing and the style, it makes for a very good read.  There's no apparent plot in this book; it simply follows the the life of a family over the years.  This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but it gives the story a lack of direction at times.  More or less, the story exists not in and of itself, but rather as a vehicle for the theme: choice.  Some might call it good vs. evil, but that's not it at all.  It's rather the choice between the two, or to be somewhere in between.  There are a lot of religious allusions made in this book, and they might go over the heads of some.    Characters here are interesting to say the least.  At the surface, some are unequivocally evil, others pure as snow.  And yet, at the end of the book, you're left wondering if that was so.  There's an illusion of flatness with many of the characters, especially Adam and Cathy, when in fact each one is incredibly deep.  The other characters are all interesting, realistic in the most part, and people you can deeply feel for.      Overall, the book is deserving of being called a classic, if only for it's deep theme.  Everything else is really peripheral to that it seems, though not lacking.  Steinbeck's style might put some off, but if you can overcome it, then a great ride awaits.

B0021L8UQ2|5.0|\\"Orphan\\" is without a doubt one of the most silly and over-the-top suspense movies that I have seen in ages. It has everything. A couple (Peter Sarsgaard & Vera Farmiga) who are getting over a recent tragedy, a busy-body nun (CCH Pounder) who simply won't keep her nose out of other people's affairs, a deaf child (Aryana Engineer) who can probably communicate better than most people and then there's Esther (Isabelle Fuhrman). There are some scenes where you may even route for Esther because at first she comes off as the ultimate victim and who doesn't like a victim? Esther gets her revenge, but good. I thought it was hysterical how Kate got all up in arms when Esther nonchalantly said the F-curse. Umm, lady you were busy doing it in the middle of your kitchen, yet you get all disturbed because your newly adopted child who walks in on you says a naughty word. But, lemme just say if Esther  were my adopted child I would send her to the Leona Helmsley school for bad girls and she'd learn really quickly how to behave. Esther is actually hiding a dark and very shocking secret which will amaze you and cause you to gasp in horror (trust me, it's a biggie). But this movie is so much more than a suspense or a thriller. It's the ultimate game of cat and mouse. The question is, who is the cat and who is the mouse? Remember, don't repeat the surprise shock ending...
0061122416|1.0|If I could give this book something below one star, I would do it.  Easily one of the worst books I've ever read.<br /><br />Not only did I find the writing juvenile (it was worse than simplistic), I felt that the author weakly disguised his New Age beliefs behind a psuedo-Christian front.  He is welcome to believe what he wants, but I hated that he attempted to disguise those beliefs as something else in order to reach more people (at least, that was my take).<br /><br />Yes, I realize that this is supposed to be a \\"personal journey\\" book; however, I think that \\"find the truth within yourself\\" stuff is just nonsense.<br /><br />Save your money.  Buy something worthwhile.
0307165485|5.0|My grandmother used to read this to my mother when she was little and she used to read Richard Scarry to my bother and I when we were little. The other day I was at my parents' home looking through a box of old books and came across this one and it brought back so many found memories. Our book has a slightly different title, Richard Scarry's Best Stories Ever. My favorite stories are the very first and the very last; Pierre Bear, and Goodnight Little Bear. The illustrations are all colorful and vibrant and vivid. What I enjoyed the most about the pictures as a child was that all of the characters looked the same so I would pretend that they overlapped in different stories. There was always something very special about Mr. Scarry's writings because he was able to capture the reader and keep them entertained while also providing an important message. For example in The Wolf and the Kids he writes about a mother goat and her 7 \\"kids\\" and the importance of not opening the door to strangers. There's also several very short stories (which are just a couple of sentences), as well as several longer passages that would even be appropriate for older children. The books that my grandmother passed down to my mom were part of a set of 4 and also included Fun with Words, Things to Know and Going Places, all by Richard Scarry. I look forward to one day sharing all of these fine books with my children. Not only are they wonderful life-lessons but they will also get kids interested in books and reading at an early age which is more important than television, computers or electronic video games. There's no place like home.

0807014273|3.0|I'm actually a little surprised this book has such a high rating.  I enjoyed it, and it was a very powerful book but I would have liked to know that this book focused so much on the theory and origin of logotherapy.<br /><br />This book was recommended to me by a family member who thought very highly of this book. Indeed, it was a very powerful book, yet (perhaps since it was written quite a time ago), it didn't connect or flow in the ways I was hoping it to.  A book about the horrors of the holocaust- absolutely.  A book about the foundations of the author's theory \\"logotherapy\\"?- yes.  The meaning of life?- eh.<br /><br />The author seems to spend an extended amount of time reflecting on his experiences in Nazi death camps, which were terrible and captivating, but became redundant.  And although I had little interest in logotherapy to start with, I was open to learning more about it.  I found the descriptions to be quite dense and forced, his attempt to describe logotherapy was sometimes a bit awkward and came off at times like a poorly written textbook. Specifically, the examples given about logotherapy I found sometimes to not be the best, sometimes the examples being more about other theories or not logotherapy at all.<br /><br />Overall, not a bad book at all, I just found the title and descriptions to be misleading.  This book has a lot to take in, and once you read it through it maybe worth going back to certain sections to fully be able to digest Frankl's material.op
0393316041|5.0|After finishing a heavy book, I wanted some light reading. This book was the perfect choice, and I have been recommending it to my friends. Feynman's book is fun, easy to read, filled with humor and wit and, occasionally, you catch a glimpse of his amazing intellect. I have thoroughly enjoyed this book, and I think you will too.
B000P0J0DI|5.0|If you like westerns, if you like Clint, this is as good as it gets. Plus, you get Gene Hackman at his best. It shows us that there is a price to be paid for killing, which a lot of flicks don't show.
0316044695|5.0|This story is powerful and riveting.  I have to say this book impacted me more powerfully than any I have read in a while.  The story is authentic and inspiring.  The author goes to great lengths to explain his dream of being a Navy SEAL, the lengths he went through to achieve it, and the intense struggle he went through in the mountains of Hindu Kush.  He does it all giving credit to the heroism of his team, the prayers of his family, and the surprising help he received in the Taliban country from the Pashtun people.  I did not want to put it down...and now that I've finished it, I can't stop thinking of this incredible story.  I am a military brat, a military wife, and an avid reader.  This story reminds me of the values our armed forces embrace and the obstacles within our own country that keep them from succeeding.
0385341008|4.0|I was intrigued by the title of this book and the many 5 star reviews.  I have to say that I am glad I go the book.  It is unique and full of interecting characters.  It is written in a letter format, which is a little confusing sometimes but I got used to it.  It is about the British isle of Guernsey during WWII and the German occupation.  The residents form a book club as a cover for meeting (and eating!) without creating suspicion among the Germans.  There are all kinds of characters who come to the club and share their memories.  This is a fluffy, fascinating read that will make you glad you did not live during those times!
B00004U45G|5.0|Have searched for this album in all the stores including some of the \\"rare find stores\\" and finally found on Amazon.
B0011NVC9I|5.0|Neil Gaiman obviously made some alterations to the original story, but in the case of making it easier for the public to swallow, I think it works.  Not only that, but the rewrite also made it so that the story kept coming full circle as well.  Pay attention when you watch the movie.  Even though the story is straightforward, there's some really cool nuances.  The CG is also a phenomenal job.  Yes, you can tell it's fake, but come on!  No 100% CG movie has gotten this realistic with the graphics.  There's some portions that look extremely photo realistic and might even fool you.  The favorite scene among my friend and I is the battlefield scene where Beowulf demands an enemy soldier to kill him.
0061150142|5.0|Occasionally, I am amazed by my fellow reviewers.  They tend to be articulate, educated, and extremely well read.  They also tend to have intelligent, constructive things to say about even the best of books.  Unfortunately, I am appalled by my fellow readers on this book.    To suggest that this novel was not worth the heart wrenching moments is to do an EXTREME disservice to it.  Yes, it is difficult to read.  When you pick up a book that is clearly about teen suicide, did you expect it to be a walk in the park?    That aside, I strongly recommend this book, if nothing else but to help you understand a growing population of teens in our world.  Emily, the part of the pact that winds up dead, feels enormous pressure to be perfect and rebounds in an extreme way.  This book gives grand insight into the way that teenagers, especially desperate teenagers, see the world.  In addition, anyone who is reading with an ear for the truth, will learn an important lesson about parenting.  Put too much pressure on your child, even in an obscure way, and it will backfire.      The plot is disturbing.  I'm not arguing that.  I am, however, saying that in any dark situation there is something to be learned.  In my experience, the characters presented by Ms. Picoult are frighteningly real and also frighteningly possible.  A walk in the park?  No.      Worth it for the characters that you learn to love and the lessons that you hopefully will learn and take to heart?    Without a doubt.

B0007MWZEK|5.0|[[ASIN:B0007MWZEK Cordless Swivel Sweeper  Original As Seen on TV by Swivel Sweeper]]    I read that someone would give it zero stars. I'm so sorry they've had problems. I'd give it 10 stars if I could. I agree with the person who said you have to have realistic expectations. It's not a vacuum cleaner. But for this disabled individual who cannot schlep or manage anything greater than two pounds, this is PERFECT! And it works really well. In fact, it just picked up kitty litter on a battery that was almost dead!    Here's my tale:    About two and a half years ago, I had hideous 35-year-old wall-to-wall shag carpeting torn out, exposing GORGEOUS hardwood floors, which I had sanded and polyurethaned. I immediately purchased a Swivel Sweeper and a microfiber mop. (See Simplee Cleen Microfiber Household Swivel Mop Kit with Two Microfiber Pads) I Swivel Sweep and Swivel Mop about once a week. After I Swivel Sweep, I spritz water mixed with a bit of white vinegar on my floors and mop. I believe the correct proportion is 1/2 cup of vinegar to a gallon of water. But I don't measure. Anyway, my floors are still incredibly beautiful after two and a half years.     And the ONLY reason I recently replaced my Swivel Sweeper is because I accidentally threw out the dust tray. But for $29.59, I got another Swivel Sweeper and I now have spare parts ... including a spare battery.     Otherwise, I believe my original model would still be going strong after over 100 uses!    I see they have a new model. Maybe I'll get that in another two years. But for now, I'm very happy with my product and my floors, which is a good thing. Having floors sanded and polyurethaned is well worth the very messy effort. But I don't want to do it again in my lifetime!    Carol
B000ZEE3I6|2.0|Here, Potter is shut in a darkened room and tortured by boredom until his backside went to sleep and went painfully numb. Hold on a second, no, that was me. Hells bloody bells, having never read the books and seeing all of the films, this is bogging down into a battle of attrition, much like when the X-Files stopped being good and you just had to force yourself to watch it in case something happened. Well, don't worry, nothing did. Oh, some bloke called Stumblebum fell off a big tower and was possibly killed. Or not Wooohooo. My wife who has read the books tells me he was killed. Ho hum. So, ask yourself this.    1) How is the staff at Hogwarts, apparently the hand picked SAS of magic, totally incompetent and always beholden to incompetent students to get them out of the mire.    2) How come Harry Potter, seemingly the \\"Ronaldo\\" of magic, always gets his arse kicked by every junior wizard, warlock, witch, etc etc he ever comes across. If he is the best the forces of good have to offer, then we are Royaly boogered.     3) How come Stumblebum always starts off with the line \\"Harry, I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you to do something incredibly dangerous etc etc etc\\", why doesn't Potter say, \\"Booger off, I'm sick of having to clear up your mess, why don't you grow some and sort it out yourself for a change, why on earth has Hogwarts not burned to the ground with an incompetent fool like you in charge, I will never know.\\"    4) How come when death and disaster reaches out to Hogwarts, the best civil defence planning they can muster is to send everyone to bed? Dame Maggie Smith says in a faux Jocko accent like that women off the Flash adverts years ago, \\"Ooch aye children, North Korea has launched a 100 megaton nuclear strike against Hogwarts, noo, please children off to the dormitories with ye before ye warheads vaporize you all, the staff will light a scented candle and hope for the best while Potter sorts it out we hope\\".. Give me strength.    4) There is no way on Gods earth that the lurch like ginger one would get within a country mile of any decent chicks, possibly his own sister might be a goer but I would say his parents had already explored that eventuality.      I am reliably told that this film was the one in which nothing happens setting it up for the next one which probably has helicopter gunships in it or something.,..    Anyway, to summarise, dull dull dull.
B000UBMZ4S|5.0|\\"Blade Runner\\" is a very strange movie. I practically grew up with it. Everyone in Sweden seems to have seen it, and it used to be very popular, especially among women. Disjointed images of the movie have stayed with me ever since I first saw it: the dark alleys filled with Chinese, the owl, the marching dwarfs at J.F. Sebastian's home, the dying replicant who talks about Orion, Vangelis' music... When I saw \\"The Final Cut\\", I realized that I remembered all of the movie and most of the lines - and yet, I didn't remember the plot! Is this how an animal sees the world? A long succession of disconnected images, some weird, some pleasant, some threatening...but nothing to tie them together. Have I finally answered that old philosophical question: How does it feel to be a bat?<br /><br />When I was younger, both my father and myself were *seriously* confused by another thing concerning \\"Blade Runner\\". Somehow, it seemed different every time we saw it! That was before I realized that there are several versions of the movie (seven versions, actually). My favourite version is still the original one, with Deckard's voice overs (\\"at that moment he loved life...all life...my life\\"), and where Deckard and Rachael get away at the end. Apparently, most people involved in making \\"Blade Runner\\" hated the original, which explains the long series of alternative versions.<br /><br />According to Wikipedia, \\"Blade Runner\\" wasn't much of a success in the United States. Perhaps the movie contains too little action for an American audience? Frankly, it hasn't much of a plot either. The point of \\"Blade Runner\\", I think, is artistic. It's not really a movie. It's a work of art, a piece of poetry on the widescreen. The strange but beautiful music by Vangelis underlines this. Perhaps that's why Ridley Scott insisted on constantly remaking \\"Blade Runner\\". He saw it as more than a commercial movie. It's his private little painting or symphony. Indeed, this might be why \\"Blade Runner\\" affected me the way it did: I never remembered the storyline, since it's not really important, but I did remember the images, the atmosphere, the strange characters...<br /><br />For those who never seen \\"Blade Runner\\", here's a short summary of the plot (with spoilers). The main character, Deckard, is a police officer specialized in killing robots known as replicants. The robots look exactly like humans, and are used as slave labour or involuntary soldiers on distant planets. Some of the replicants escape from captivity and turn up in California. During Deckard's mission to intercept and kill them, he realizes that Rachael, the woman he loves, is also a replicant, but unaware of the fact. The police want Deckard to kill Rachael as well. Deckard refuses. In some versions of the movie, he and Rachael gets away, while in other versions, their ultimate fate remains uncertain. In \\"The Final Cut\\", it's even implied that Deckard himself might be a replicant!<br /><br />But, as I said, the plot is really the least interesting part of this production. Deckard is actually a quite incompetent cop!

B00005JMJG|5.0|This movie is - as commented by many others - brilliant.    The scenario is strangely wacky; the main character (Joel) volunteers to have his memory erased of a destructive relation ship with his ex-girlfriend, Clementine, after finding out that she has done the same to him.    The basic premise seems to be bizarre but the execution - the distinctive supporting characters, the slow methodical pacing that adds weight to each scene, etc - the execution weaves a breathtaking tapestry that adds a complexity each time you watch the movie.    Others have said that this movie is a romantic comedy; without giving away the plot of the movie, I don't know if that's the case by the end of the movie but I can't help but hope that it's certainly the case for them.    Watch this movie with a loved one.  This is certainly a breath-taking, though-provoking movie.  Very highly recommended.

Mars Volta is an amazing band and this is another amazing album.  Smokin hot(Goliath is nutz) The USB ouija board is a cool idea.   If you know the band, this plays into their \\"mythology\\".   Inside is the album and a video. Also, there's some interactive stuff   that takes you to a Volta website with info and updates and swag to buy.  I got this not only because it can later be a very cool USB (1 Gb)  device but it's only going to increase in value because there were  a limited amount made. It's hard to find now, so snatch one up if  you find one.

B001KMB6X2|2.0|At the conclusion of this movie, I was thinking to myself... what the? I don't know where to start, but some of the camera work early in parts of the movie where terrible; with camera angles changing every two seconds or so, making it extremely difficult to follow the action. The peculiar mannerisms of Aurora (Melanie Thierry) were maddening to the point that you wished Vin Diesel, as Toorop or Michelle Yeoh, as Sister Rebekah would put some tape over her mouth to shut her up. Speaking of Michelle Yeoh. She was mis-cast in this thing of a movie. Terrible job on her part. She may have been added only to spice up the action scenes with her Martial Arts. Other than that, she wasn't very interesting. And Gerard Depardieu's part was useless and laughable. I can't be subjective about a movie that was too fragmented to make any sense. Ugh.
B0015OKWL2|3.0|This is definitely entertaining. De Niro and Pacino are great. It's a clever story and there are surprises. But it just doesn't have the greatness that would bring you back to it and require you to watch it again and again. Rent it.  Stream it. I don't think you need to buy it.

B000ZELISO|2.0|ALAS! After two years of waiting for the sixth installment of the H.P. series, the Warner Corporation presents us with a lame, unsatisfying, boring and highly dissapointing movie. I second all the previous reviews, like the one from J.R. among others, who have appropriately pinpointed the flaws in this ghastly film.  Come on!!  They totally left out (or changed) crucial parts of the book, like the war in Hogwarts against the Death Eaters, Dumbledore´s funeral, vital info about the Horcruxes, Tom Riddle´s past, etc, etc, etc.  Never mind, I will not repeat what others have already described in such an accurate way about the reasons why I shall only rate this movie with two stars. How frustrating and dissapointing, indeed! They´ve shattered all my healthy expectations about it. I expected  much better from this film, after all, it is supposed to be based on the excellent written version of the Half Blood Prince.
B000ZEE3I6|4.0| The 8-Month Wait   At first, when I heard back in November of last year that Harry Potter's 6th chapter would be postponed for 8 months, I was furious.  I blamed Warner Bros for being greedy and wanting more money. 'Shame on them', I thought, for making fans of the movies wait another 8 months... just so they can get a profit.  And, especially, 'shame', for toying with fans of the books, who want to see their favorite story come to life on the screen - especially now that Rowling has finished the Potter tale in such fine form.    As time went by, I changed my mind.  Warner Bros expressed their deep desire to please the fans, and illustrated this by keeping interests peaked and hunger abated using clips from the movie, and photographs from the set of the 'now-in-production 7th Potter movie'.  I reasoned more time meant more opportunities to tweak/improve the sixth film, and make sure patient fans won't be disappointed come July 15th.     The First Impression   I've finally seen the film... twice, as of today.  The first time I saw it, I was dismayed. 'Fans of the films might be shocked', I thought, 'that was such a DARK film... gloomy, a drastic shift in the tone for the movie series.  How will movie-fans adjust to this?  And Fans of the books', I feared, 'would be disappointed.  No...not disappointed, FURIOUS!!! Where are the funny scenes with Fudge and the British Prime Minister? Or a heartbroken Tonks and her brown hair and dog-shaped Patronus?  Where are the remaining flashbacks of Voldemort's parents, or his murderous acts as a child, and then as an adult? Or his chilling, almost casual conversation with Dumbledore, man to man?  And what, WHAT happened to the violent duel between the Death Eaters and the Order of the Phoenix?!?  That tense prelude to the tragic climax at the end of the sixth book?!? And WHERE is the FUNERAL scene?!?'    All these thoughts rushed through my mind after seeing the film the first time.  But then, fan of the Potter story that I am,I began to think:  The director for the sixth film, the cast, AND the producer of HP6 ALL gushed about how proud they were of the finished film, and how much they desired to please fans of both the books AND the movies with their work... were they LYING?  Why say all those things, and then show us a film so different from what any fan of the movies OR books would expect?  I decided to give the film a second look, and tried to view it from a different perspective - not as a movie fan, OR as a book fan, but as a critic - a lover of good movies in general.     A Parting of the Ways   The result? Satisfaction from every angle. A 2nd viewing of the film gave me a new found respect for David Yates and the work he has done to elevate the quality of the Potter franchise, and please fans and casual viewers alike.  Yes, this Potter is DARK.  Darker I'd say that the last one, and that was a pretty gloomy viewing as well.  But the Potter story was always supposed to BE darker as Harry got older.  Fans of the books will recall the initial shock they felt at Cedric Diggory's death in Book 4, and the horror of 'Flesh, Blood, and Bone', the chapter which chronicled Voldemort's awful return in gruesome detail.  Many readers closed the 4th Potter book with the stunned realization that evil had just successfully come back into the world, and that the fate of the Wizarding world as we know it, was uncertain.  That shock, more than anything, is what kept us reading through Books 5, 6, and 7. This unexpected twist is what Rowling kept utilizing in her books to keep readers on edge - not knowing what could possibly happen next to Harry and his friends that could make things any more worse for the Wizarding world.    Yates has made this intention clear with this film.  Potter's world is NOT the same anymore. No one is safe any longer, and evil has returned and will strike at any time. The sixth book did not feel as ominous and foreboding as the film, but that is the book - I got to see more of Harry's life outside of the menace of Voldemort, a luxury of insight a 3 hour film can only allow so much of.  And Yates does in fact incorporate some of those joyous moments in this film as well, but he makes the viewer aware those joyful moments will be short and sparse, as something terrible is happening in Potter's world, or is about to happen at any moment.  The movie fans must adjust to this change in tone, just as the fans of the books had to adjust from the 4th book up until Book 7 (which incidentally, feels much, MUCH darker in tone than Book 6, for various, necessary reasons.)    And as for fans of the books?  Well, after a 2nd viewing of this film, I feel this sixth movie is sort of like a 'Parting of the Ways' between the book and film versions of Harry Potter.  Rowling has finished the books and ended the story well. Now Yates knows how the story will end, and - since he will be directing all the remaining movies - has complete control over all the elements of Potter's journey that will lead us to the fateful climax in book 7.  Thus, he can now adjust the flow of the story at will, and tweak its development such that fans still get a visual experience of Harry Potter's world, without casual viewers and critics alike being compromised of an entertaining, intriguing film. If Yates simply continued to recreate what fans read in the sixth book, fans of the book would watch the sixth movie and probably be satisfied, but the movie itself, might be too fragmented in its storytelling, and would probably feel too long for casual viewers.  Yates could have aimed more for movie fans and simplified the sixth book's story so they didn't have to work too hard to figure out hints and clues, but Yates doesn't do that either.  Instead, he carefully balances the amount of back-story included in this film... enough to intrigue and entertain viewers without compromising their need to think about what they are seeing.  This is similar to Rowling's style of storytelling.  As fun as it was in each book to 'come back to Hogwarts with Harry', the pleasure of seeing how characters, hints, and clues fit together, how they led to shocking, exciting revelations, added to the experience of each book and always left me eager to read the next book in the Potter saga.     The Future of Potter   In a nutshell? A 'Parting of the Ways' - no more sticking too closely to the books, and no more simplifying too much of what's on the screen for casual viewers - in fact, the Critics might just be the new fans to please.  Not an easy pill to swallow (I myself am still adjusting to the taste), but it speaks a lot about Yates' intentions for the Potter movie franchise.  He wants to end the Potter story with a bang, and do it with style, efficiency, and substance.  As someone who loves Rowling's books and knows how a good film can inspire a person to read more literature (Lord of the Rings, I am looking your way), I commend Yates, AND the actors, AND Warner Bros, for their work with this 6th Harry Potter film.  It's a work of art and storytelling, fun and fantasy, dark horror, love, loss, and sadness.  I trusted Rowling to do justice to the Potter story and bring Harry Potter's tale to an exciting and mind-warping conclusion.  She exceeded my expectations.  I think, when all the movies are done and there is nothing left to do but look back, Yates will have done the same for the Potter film franchise, elevating the visualization of the Potter stories into something more substantial, more meaningful to behold, and creating new fans of the movies and books alike.

1439138311|4.0|Eilis Lacey reluctantly ventures from the small town of Enniscorthy, Ireland to an Irish parish of 1950's Brooklyn. The life change somewhat imposed on her, Eilis transplants herself into her new life merely nudged by the vague motive that it's what her sister and mother expect of her.<br /><br />While keeping her emotions for the most part under the surface, the apparently unsophisticated Eilis begins to adapt and develop a support network in her new life, working at a local store and taking accounting classes. It is only when she meets a local Italian man that cautiously courts her that she begins to develop roots, which result in her sudden flourishing growth of self-assertion by the novel's end.<br /><br />Beautifully written although extremely quiet in style, Toibin is a master of emotional nuance.
0553381687|5.0|I picked this book up about a week ago and couldnt put it down until I had read it all. The book is quite a read at 800+ pages, but each page seemed to make the plot thicker. You won't be bored to death with pointless details, which surprised me since the book is so large.<br /><br />There are some plot twists, but not as many as I expected. There's a lot of foreshadowing, and if you read carefully you usually know what's going to happen. Not to the point where you're bored.<br /><br />I have one major complaints though.<br /><br /> One, the author trys to introduce too many characters at once. He gives names and backgrounds to what seemed 1000 characters. This can be overwhelming and you find yourself wondering who you're reading about. To make matters worse he gives characters the same names....a lot. He has an appendix but it doesn't list everyone and you can easily get mixed up about who he's talking about. Sometimes I wasn't sure if there were one or two of a certain character. To make it even worse he gives the same character numerous names and titles. After getting into the book you'll start to get confused less, but I still found myself wondering if there were two of one character or what. The appendix would have to change or update itself to help you completly.<br /><br />This isn't a quick easy read. Don't plan on buying this book unless you plan on starting all six books. This isn't a book you would just skim through, you have to read each and every sentence or you WILL be lost.<br />Great book though. Can't wait to read the second.

0439023483|5.0|This is one of the few books that I literally could not put down.  I tried and failed.  I read all through the night and finished as the sun rose.  The Hunger Games takes old ideas from many different genres (sci-fi, romance, fantasy, etc.) and works them all together into a wonderful and addictive story.    Katniss is a likable and interesting hero and the supporting characters play their parts perfectly.  The story being written in first-person present tense makes it that much more powerful.  You, as a reader, really feel like you are with Katniss as the action is unfolding and that you are both experiencing the events together.    I wholeheartedly recommend for everyone to give this great book a try.
1416584072|4.0|I enjoyed this book about a Bangladeshi girl who starts to question her choices in life.    Nazneen agrees to an arranged marriage, because it's the traditional custom and she wants to please her father. Her free-thinking sister runs away to marry a local boy she loves. The book follows both sisters' lives over a course of 15 years.     Nazneen moves to London with her Bangladeshi husband, Chaunu, who's quite a bit older than she is. He's not a bad man, but he's pompous and he loves to hear himself talk. Nazneen endures her loneliness and misses her childhood home. She struggles to learn English. As the years go by, she has children with Chanu.    She treasures the letters she receives from her sister, who still lives in Bangladesh. But Hasina struggles with her own problems. She escaped an arranged marriage, but her \\"love marriage\\" is not what she hoped for.    The author writes with humor and heart. She vividly describes Bangladeshi customs, clothes, and food (you can smell the food). She also has a gift for dialogue.    My only criticism - Hasina's letters are written in broken English, and sometimes they're difficult to read. But her story is powerful, and I waited for each new installment.     I was sorry when this book ended. Well worth reading.
B001KVZ6F2|5.0|\\"Gran Torino\\" is a different kind of Clint Eastwood movie.  Yes he still has a gun (you will have to see how he uses it) but his character is different from any that I have seen him play again.  In this movie, Eastwood plays the role of Walt Kowalski, an elderly, crotchety, widower, who, living with his legacy from the Korean War, gradually comes to terms with his ethnically changing, gang infested neighborhood.  Key characters include his Hmong neighbors, played by Bee Vang, Ahney Her and a young priest, played by Christopher Carley.  All turn in compelling performances as they slowly gain new understandings of those around them.  As the story progresses, Kowlaski moves from a not very likable old man to a personification of the Christ motif found so often in literature.  By the end, the viewer realizes that he is viewing a modern Morality Play.

I have to say that  the rhythmic flow of the track:\\"Cold\\" had to grow on me, but I have been listening intently to the album for the last week and I am continually impressed by this artist's tasteful approach to seduction, love and romance.  Maxwell has demonstrated such a melodic and lyrical maturity and this body of work has been well worth the wait.  I look forward to hearing the second and third installments of this album and I can't wait til he returns to Chicago for another concert tour!

0689865384|1.0|Just to give everyone an idea of where I'm coming from, I love sci-fi and my favorite novels are Harry Potter and Fahrenheit 451.  Reading the summary and many reviews, this seemed like it would be a great sci-fi/dystopian/fantasy novel aimed at young adults so I did not hesitate to buy it.    But this book was just plain awful.  I kept thinking it would get better but it didn't and the end couldn't come quickly enough.    The writing was like that of a middle schooler with this being the first sentence: \\"the early summer sky was the color of cat vomit.\\"  I know some will argue that the choice of words was just for a \\"deeper meaning\\" and to \\"set the tone\\" but I believe it is just a prime example of his inadequacies as a writer.    I found none of the characters likable nor relatable and just wanted all of them to stop complaining.  I really just cringe every time I see the name Tally in anything because she is, to me, one of the most detestable characters in fiction.  Ever.    Lastly, Westerfeld spent as much time as possible criticizing our present civilization for how stupid we are and how we're destroying everything.    I dropped this book in the trash the moment I finished reading, which I've never done before.  This is the most poorly written, condescending, and insipid book I've ever had the misfortune of reading.  Stay as far away from it as possible!
B000002GI0|5.0|I had a hard time containing my excitement when MFSL released my favorite recording by one of my favorite performers, John Hiatt. Originally produced back in 1988 by Glyn Johns, this was always a pretty good sounding studio recording, and MFSL's GAIN 2 remastering process seems to have added a bit of lifelike texture to the music, making this disk a must-have for true-blue John Hiatt fans. As a nice bonus, Hiatt wrote a short intro about the recording sessions and brief but revealing comments on the songs.<br /><br /> If you've never heard John Hiatt, then trust me--the puzzle of your life is missing a piece. He combines autobiographical insight with a wicked sense of humor, all wrapped up in an exuberance that is bound to win you over. Add the tasty guitar of Sonny Landreth and the rock-solid drumming of Ken Blevins, and you've got a heck of a gumbo--a little country, a little folk, a little hard rock, a little Memphis soul, and a whole lot of energy. The powerful performances and superlative sound make Slow Turning an absolute must-have, and if you can't find the MFSL version, the original A&M release is still awfully nice.

B002A9OJ0Q|1.0|I should have known soon as Waaktaar said they were gaining \\"ideas\\" from Arcade Fire. Lame and bland and immediately forgettable. What a shame they had to rush something like this out, prior to this the only bland and lazy offering they had was Lifelines. And this is worse.    If you're a new fan of A-ha's don't be put off by this mediocrity, be sure to check out all the great albums in their catalouge, my personal ranking:    1. Scoundrel Days  2. East of the Sun, West of the Moon  3. Hunting High and Low  4. Stay On These Roads  5. Minor Earth, Major Sky  6. Memorial Beach  6. Analouge    Two albums equally at No.6 for me. Lifelines has a couple of great songs but it mostly is poor.    EDIT 2010: Memorial Beach is now No.2 for me.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Really, if you have any doubts about Firefly, just drop them and give this wonderful show a chance.  It took me 6 years to try it out, and I did so solely for Joss Whedon.  If you are a fan of any of his previous works you know what to expect; witty dialogue, lovable characters and amazing stories.  If you're new to the 'verse, well...that's what you should expect.  This is the only show that I cannot choose a character I dislike nor an episode I dislike (perhaps the only very small positive that can be taken from the cancellation is that Firefly never had a poor episode).    The acting is incredible.  They all really do become the characters and you can definitely see how much they all care for each other.  The writing and direction of each episode is top-notch.  The special effects are great too.    The special features on the DVD are nice.  The commentaries are all really fun and give a lot of great insight into the show (especially Objects in Space).  There are only a handful of deleted scenes and then the usual \\"making of\\" features.  Plus Adam Baldwin singing!    Oh and one last amazing part is that Firefly is one of the few space shows that actually makes space soundless and it really, really makes all the space scenes very effective.    Sorry for the slightly rambling review but I really just believe that everyone should experience one of the greatest TV shows of all time.
B000002G1Y|4.0|John Hiatt is responsible for three of the best CDs of the last couple of decades or so--Bring the Family, Slow Turning, and Stolen Moments. I was afraid that after producing three such gems, his touch might leave him. But nope, this is a perfectly good CD, and like the best of Hiatt's music, never fails to bring a smile to the faces of those who listen to it. A little less country- and a little more rock-oriented than the earlier three CDs, Perfectly Good Guitar just flat kicks butt. Just fire up \\"The Wreck of the Barbie Ferrari\\" and see what I mean. But if you have never heard John Hiatt, start with Slow Turning, and let the man grow on you. He will.

B0013FSL3E|5.0|I am a 26 year old guy that listens to hard rock and is not a big fan of animated movies. When a movie says it's for \\"the family\\" it usually means it's for kids and they throw in a few jokes only adults will get so they won't lose their freaking minds when they're sitting through it with their 5-year-old. Those movies don't hold my attention.    So please understand how significant it is that this one very much did.     It is not a movie FOR kids. Don't get me wrong. Kids will love it because it has cute little robots throughout, and nothing even remotely offensive. However the plot is not about cartoon cars getting ready for the big race or moving, talking toys. (nothing wrong with that, just not as much my cup of tea) And that is where the genius lies. The plot deals with humans who are becoming more and more lazy, trashing our planet, things that are actually happening. Things that are not only entertaining in this context, but are important. It is not only an interesting concept with (REALLY) amazing animation and a robot love story. It takes humanity and looks into an almost science-fiction, but yet unfortunately a not too terribly unbelievable journey hundreds of years into our future. It's a rare occasion, and possibly the first for an animated film, to not just be a great movie. But to be an important one. And I believe Wall-e has accomplished that.    This is a classic movie any way you slice it. It may be difficult for some to endure with its lack of dialogue. But once it gets rolling, it will keep your attention and make you think about us as a human race, not to mention keep a smile on your face the whole time. Get it.

B0029358GM|2.0|As a fan of all their previous releases, this is by far their least interesting and enjoyable record. Even AM showed some excitement and conviction. Tweedy seems to have fallen into that recycling song mode here. There is absolutely nothing new or fresh to speak of. Well to me at least...     Besides the lack of superb songwriting which we're use to Tweedy composing, I'm saddened by the lack of progression.  Sky Blue Sky was the record I thought Tweedy needed to write.  Like Neil Young doing Comes A Time before Rust Never Sleeps. But people, this is no Rust Never Sleeps. This is bland and boring.  When I heard \\"You Never Know\\" on the radio for the first time, I thought to myself who is this crappy band trying to sound like Wilco. And that's exactly how most of this record sounds to me. With a phenomenal band behind him it's frustrating to figure out why he doesn't use them.      In no shape or form am I writing off Mr. Tweedy but I hope this doesn't lead to a routine which we are use to seeing our heroes take.

B001EAWMGA|4.0|After an ultra-brief theatrical run, Outlander finally sees the light of day on DVD.  Jim Caviezel stars as Kainan; an otherworldly traveler who lands on a Viking-era Earth.  Along with him is a revenge driven, murderous beast called the Moorwen, that wreaks havoc on the populace that Kainan now finds himself an honorary part of.  Truly mixing plenty of elements from Beowulf and Predator alike, Outlander is a fun and surprisingly inventive sci-fi opus that is definitely more worthy of having a big time theatrical release.  Caviezel is good, as is Sophia Myles as the lovely princess and John Hurt as her father the King, and Ron \\"Hellboy\\" Perlman is on board as well in a brief, but more than fitting, role as a rival clan leader.  The only real flaws of Outlander lie in its CGI effects work, which really display just how small a budget director Howard McCain and crew had to work with.  In that respect alone though, Outlander is surprisingly good sci-fi fare, and definitely worth your time.

Replaced with facinating Winwood songs made the Hollywood Bowl show (I think) the best concert I have ever seen , ever!<br />Reviewing the DVD after the fact it has grown on me and now I love it.<br />Particularly \\"No face, no name, no number\\" and \\"Split Decision\\" by Stevie Winwood. Also I must say that Stevie plays Hammond organ , acoustic and electric guitars and BASS PEDALS!!! Who plays bass pedals anymore except church organists? He is the consumate musician and Clapton would do well to throw in with Stevie for some future projects, or form a band. This DVD is a must see!!
B000002UJQ|5.0|OK Computer came out just as our middle child was born and I went into a new music hiatus.  It wasn't until approximately 4 years after it came out that a friend of mine clued me into its existence.<br /><br />I was immediately blown away.  This album is whole and complete.  Somewhere there is a meme going around that albums used to be stocked end-to-end with great music and that in more recent times albums have one or two good songs and the rest is mediocre.  OK Computer belies that meme.  Every song is a classic.  The only song on here that I do not thrill to listen to at any opportunity is Fitter Happier - but in the context of listening to the whole album, even this song works.<br /><br />The production on this album is top notch.  The arrangements are evocative, emotional, beautiful, sad, glorious, amazing, epic.  One of my favorite songs ever is Exit Music (for a Film).  This album stands out as one of the best works created by any group ever.  It easily fits in the company of Dark Side of the Moon.  It is a classic.  5 star.  Excelsior!
0790733226|5.0|Now that I'm a LITTLE wiser, have come to realize this movie is absolutely profound.<br /><br />Written by Carl Sagan, the great physicist of \\"billions and billions\\" fame, it is not only intelligent, but phenomenally so.<br /><br />Reason? He addresses questions and issues within the movie that we don't realize are so important until we've been around a while and analyze our world's technological evolution.<br /><br />ESPECIALLY our technological capacity and the implications and repurcussions.<br /><br />Of course I could rave on about Jody Foster and Matthew McConaughey (never spell that right - sorry!)<br /><br />Jody is totally lovable, likable, sympathetic and compelling. She is 100% convincing as a brilliant, uni-linearly focussed and isolated scientist. Her determination in the movie serves as model inspiration on how to succeed in the business world. She just won't give up.<br /><br />Matthew is at his most magnetic. As he and Jody meet in a tropical cabana, you can feel the heat of his charm pop right through the screen. There's probably not a woman in the world who could have resisted in responding to him... except the wonderful character portrayed by Jody Foster.<br /><br />It adds the perfect romantic tension.<br /><br />Coupled with the extraordinary scenery, the absolutely soaring and magnificent musical score, CONTACT is one of the best movies ever made.<br /><br />But, folks may not notice at first. So many thought-inspiring little things slip by, unnoticed. So, it's one of those movies that's gets better and better as we get older and wiser. The more we watch, the better it gets.<br /><br />As a kid, we may have enjoyed it immensely. As an adult, it becomes a movie of great import and impact if you give yourself a chance to examine the science and forethought that went into the writing and making of this movie.<br /><br />I wasn't quite sure about Carl Sagan, didn't know of him very well. But, now I can see he was one of those special geniuses who know so much more than one might have surmised. One of the world's truly great thinkers.<br /><br />He wrote popular novels - perhaps that may have diminished his reputation as a world's great thinker type of scientist and pushed him into seeming  just another populistic author. He was also a television star with his own documentary.<br /><br />Now I would like to see them... and have an opportunity to read his books.<br /><br />In a separate review, I hope to address the final question posed within the latter parts of this movie. But here, I don't want to insert any spoilers.<br /><br />The best way to watch this movie is from a clean start, and then watch again and again to get the full purported meanings.<br /><br />6 out of 5 stars<br /><br />Other recommended EXTRAORDINARY movies:<br />Bladerunner - Pinnacle of SCIFI movies<br />Saving Private Ryan - Great, great war Movie<br />A.I. - classic WORK OF ART for all time<br />Contact - SCIFI at it's very best<br />Phantom of the Opera - Haunting Perfectioners.

0790737345|1.0|I really like Cage's acting.  He is great in \\"Next\\" and all the National Treasure movies (I am hoping there are many of them).  But I have \\"City of Angels\\" listed as the worst movie ever made.  Now, why would I say that?  It glamorizes the \\"real very first sin\\" and that is an angel disobeying God by rejecting the place God placed them in (the first sin was when an angel wanted God's place).  Yes, I know it's just a movie but this is literally the lowest possible moral rung.  There is no going back for an angel.  There is no plan of redemption.  A fallen angel goes from the best possible to the worst possible condition without the possibility of return.  The other angels would not look upon him with any form of admiration but rather with horror at what he did to destroy himself and it would greatly negatively affect the lady if he was allowed to contact her at all at that point.  He would be the worst thing for her and his \\"affection\\" would be the very opposite of true love.  It is a sad, sad tale of the true beginning of all woes.  This movie confuses the results of good and evil.
B001GKJ2FW|5.0|I have watched this movie twice in one day and I laugh out loud every single time.  As far as Pierce Brosnan goes - it makes it all the more realistic of a love story - not everyone in the world is an opera singer.  The movie is fun, entertaining and I LOVE ABBA music - what a great combination!  Don't miss it!
B002A9OJ0Q|5.0|A classic return to form sound from a band that just didn't get the respect<br />they should have here in the states. By mixing some of their trademark<br />synth bounce, great writing, and the one of kind vocals of Morton Harket<br />a-ha have fashioned one of their best collections since their debut.<br />From start to finish its seemless pop-rock with the sounds of Depeche Mode,<br />Keane, Coldplay and even Gary Numan but its all a-ha, just a reminder of<br />some great music and riffs. Steve Osborne lends his talents to this outing<br />(he worked with the B-52s on their recent comeback) and works his studio magic helping to shape these songs. Still very much a product and sound of<br />today and revisiting the 80's makes this one a winner and I hope they get<br />some kind of deal here in the states. Its a shame they have been so<br />overlooked in this part of the world, they have some excellent songs<br />over the past couple decades. Radio should give \\"Riding the wave\\" a good<br />look as with the first single \\"Foot of the mountain\\", this one just might<br />turns some heads. Great melodies, soaring vocals all through.
0064430227|5.0|The thing I like most about this book is the idea that you can create your own destiny in a sense by fully using your imagination. This is what Harold does with his purple crayon as he draws whatever he needs or wants to explore. Because of this style of storytelling, the story seems to \\"unfold\\" a little more than the average story because you get the sense that Harold is involved in an extremely creative process that is in very close interaction with his world.<br /><br />The illustrations are extremely simple and my kids usually like books with more colorful illustrations, but since I think this book piques kids' imaginations, they are drawn to it.
B00005JLWN|4.0|I had no idea what kind of film this was until I actually started watching it.  But, once into it I immediately realized that there really was only one possible outcome to the plot, and was totally correct.  The film attempts to trick the viewer with the notion of unpredictability. It fails at this.  With this kind of actual story scheme the possibilities for story development is full of potential and it should have been fully exploited here, but it fails to do so as it keeps one thing going that really interrupted the flower in this garden: the use of martial arts gun fighting.    And, that's really a shame.  Because it could have been one of the great films ever made.  Very Orwellian in theme and content it really does touch at the humanity in the viewer.  It is very intelligently displayed in the sequences in which there is no actual combat.    I recommend this film for at least one viewing to all sci-fi/action lovers.  You folks will thoroughly enjoy it.  Christian Bale is absolutely great at his role here.  As is Taye Diggs and Emily Watson.  As mentioned already, though, the style of film really detracts from the potential of the story so don't expect to be enriched by a grand film experience.  If you are looking for films which give you a great story punch in this style then you want to see Bladerunner or Children of Men.    I've given it four stars.  I doubt that people not interested in this genre of film would really care for it, so for you folks consider this to be a three star appraisal.
B0011KQSZ4|5.0|The cast is amazing.  Each of them bringing enough truth and depth to create a realistic pathos to every character.  It's easy to forget that you're watching actors doing their jobs; it feels more like watching a bizaar family funeral via hidden camera.<br /><br />Kudos all 'round.
B0007DFJ0G|5.0|This film is both underrated and overrated.  It's underrated because I don't think major critics have always given this one a great recommendation, as it deserves such.  I've discovered that, in most cases, if Brad Pitt is in a film then it is probably a good movie.  This one is in many ways.  However, I must also say that it is fully overrated in that those who really champion this film give it a lot more credit than it actually deserves, probably because of how \\"cool\\" the story goes with them.    There are quite a few fight scenes and they are genuinely authentic fighting scenes.  As such, I don't think someone under 18 years of age should watch this movie.    The actual content of the film, however, could not be more well developed.  If you've seen 12 Monkeys then I must tell you that some of the idea in this film is very similar to that one, and while I don't think this movie is as intelligent as that, it is indeed a well designed idea altogether.    One thing is certain.  If you have no idea what this film is about I can tell you that figuring out what is actually going on is not very easy.  A truly detached movie watcher can probably figure it out and yet still be fully entertained by it.  If you get sunk into the movie, though, you will be well into it before you understand what's happening, and the epiphany delivered is absolutely the tops.  A genuine work of art.    Don't be deceived by the title to this film.  It's a far deeper idea than it would appear on the surface, and it's far more rewarding than most films could ever be.    It's a five star film.  Enjoy.

0525478183|3.0|I really wanted to enjoy this book. In the beginning, Margo, a girl Quentin has known since childhood, shows up and drags Quentin through a late-night/early-morning \\"crime\\" spree, getting back at all the people she thinks have wronged her. It's very funny, and you can just feel the emotions behind Quentin as he's sort of reconnected with someone he used to be close to as a child, but grew apart from as they aged. However, when Quentin discovers that Margo has disappeared after their little adventure and finds clues she left behind, he decides to take his friends on a little adventure to find Margo. Unfortunately, here is where the book began to loose interest for me. I had no trouble imagining Margo, or her interactions with Quentin, but once Margo was out of the picture, there was no real emotion or sense of action/feeling from Quentin or his gang that went along for the ride. Nothing they did had the energy of Margo, even though I think this was the goal of the writing. I found myself wanting to skip around to see if Margo was coming back, because I needed to know that the energy would reappear.    The book does make some very relevant observations which will ring true to what you felt during high school, and maybe even now. For instance, the author mentions the feeling \\"I will never do this again, I will never be here again...\\" and how the feeling was unbearable, but on the next page, says \\"It is so hard to leave - until you leave. And then it is the easiest...thing in the world.\\" It's observations like that which are little gems along the way.    The ending wasn't very satisfying, but did at least provide a conclusion to the book. Overall, I'd say if you like books that make observations on life or try and remind you of times/events gone past, then this is a good book for that, but if you're looking for adventure/romance/action, this might not be your cup of tea.
B000N6U0E2|5.0|This is indeed a great inspirational film. It's the real-life story of Chris Gardner, a man who has struggled with both his finances and his support for his son. His only chance of success is becoming a stockbroker, and he tries his hardest during his internship while taking care of the only person he cares about. And he does this when he is evicted from his own home, and starts living in a motel, a subway train, even in a public bathroom. But Chris never gives up on not only his dreams of success, but his dream of his own son fulfilling his own dreams of success.<br /><br />Surely, this is a very inspirational film about perseverance, success, and family. And now this film is way more significant today. We're in the middle of a chaotic economic crisis, and it looks to be getting worse. Thousands of people are losing jobs and businesses, hundreds of homes are in foreclosure, food and gas prices have gone up, and big corporations are going bankrupt and being shut down. Of all the misery that the entire world is facing, there is still hope. We just can't give up on our own dreams. we can make it. We have to work hard at what we do and what we want to be, even if we can't pay our bills on time. Right now I'm twenty-two years old, and I'm still not giving up on my dreams of being a n author, despite many obstacles that I'm facing right now. My parents, older brother, and I have moved into an apartment just last year, and we're still facing major challenges. My parents and my brother aren't making that much money and are having trouble with payments, while I'm struggling with my grades (and money) during my fourth year in a community college and it looks like I've still got a few more years until I can actually transfer to a university. But I shouldn't feel horrible about all this. I still believe that we can pull this all off. We have to feel confident that we can achieve a great deal in the future. Right now, I'm in the process of writing several short stories, and I'm hoping to publish at least some of it this year. And maybe in a couple of years, I could publish my very first novel. With the obstacles I'm facing, I'm sure I can beat them.<br /><br />This is why \\"The Pursuit of Happyness,\\" and Chris Gardner himself, is so special. It's a constant reminder that are dreams can be fulfilled. We have to work hard and believe in ourselves. If we quit, then we are disappointing ourselves and the people are supporting us. In the end, it's all about perseverance.<br /><br />\\"You got a dream, you got to protect. When people can't do something themselves, they want to tell you that you can't do it.

B00204AA0O|4.0|Hard-to-classify Regina Spektor came out of nowhere with her intriguing \\"Soviet Kitsch\\" debut album in 2004, which she followed up in 2006 with the \\"Hard to Believe\\" in the same vein. Now, after a 3 year studio hiatus, comes Regina's highly anticipated third album.<br /><br />The opening sounds of  \\"The Calculation\\", which is the opening track from \\"Far\\" (13 tracks; 47 min.), might give the impression that this album will continue the quirky soundscape from her previous work, but nothing could be further from the truth. Indeed, after that opening salvo, this album paints a newly evolved sound, in which Tori Amos-meets-Fiona Apple-meets-Judie Tzuck. Not as edgy as before, but instead mostly sophisticated piano driven music. \\"Eet\\" sets the tone. \\"Machine\\" is one of the more catchier tracks on here, and probably my favorite track of the album, although I also like the whimsical \\"Laughing With\\" right after that. Other highlights include \\"Human of the Year\\" (with its uplifting Hallelujah! shout-out), \\"Two Birds\\", and \\"Dance Anthem of the 80's\\". The album might've been served better with a slight shorter running time (cutting a couple of songs towards the end), but overall this is a satisfying album.<br /><br />I can imagine that some Spektor fans from the early days are cringing a bit when listening to the album, as this album is much more conventional. But it is no less enjoyable, in my opinion. Two thumbs down, though, for not including the song lyrics in the album art. That is just inexcusable for an album such as this one.
B0002YLC24|1.0|It flat out sucks and is boring as hell. Just 80 minutes of blah blah which we just fast forwarded through.
0385474547|3.0|If you like literary style type of story telling,you may give this book 4 or 5 stars. If you prefer action-packed fast paced story telling, then you will be disappointed and may give this work one star. I was leaning towards the 1-star group.But somewhat admiring the literary aspect of the whole work inclines me to give it a 3. However, other reviewers view this as plot-less and yes, for me it does seem plotless but a better description I think would be \\"weak plot\\". The story revolves around a a tribal leader named Okonkwo who tried his best to shield his tribe with its traditional culture from the influence of \\"change\\". (Reminds us of what we are undergoing in our own century, doesn't it, with everone clamoring for \\"change\\"). But the \\"change\\" in Oknokwo's world is something that appeared to be less violent and more compassionate as taught by the European missionaries. As other members of his tribe begin to accept and adopt the new doctrine, Oknokwo's world and culture had come to an end which eventually led to his inevitable fall from grace with his tribal society. As with other reviewers,I find some of the pages less interesting that I skip them but those belong to Part One.However, as one peruses or examines Parts Two and Three, the pace gains some momentum as the clash of cultures intensifies and as the doctrines of Chrisitanity begin to enlghten and inspire the African mind.
B00005JKGK|5.0|As much as I think it's a great movie, thanks to the sensitive directing of Wayne Wang (an Asian American male), the biase against Asian males bordering on racist stereotypes simply comes through. I can empathize the venomous comments by some Asian males here, but I think it's going a bit overboard. Even though stereotypical caricatures are often based on partial truth, I find the cheapskate jerk Asian American husband portrayal the most troubling. Oddly, most Asian guys are the opposite when it comes to money. The husband, by all accounts even though Asian, is really embodying western values of individualism and legalistic formal contracts rather than the Asian traditional emphasis on community, sharing, and personal trust. I can understand the historical premise behind the negative portrayals of wife abuse and concubines by Asian males, but there is no basis to use an Asian male as a cloak for the sins of western values.<br /><br />The last part of the movie is beautifully done. Wayne Wang's directing and cinematography is superb and Rachel Portman's melancholic scoring adds so much to the emotional catharsis. When June says \\"cheah cheah\\" (which is so fitting as a sign of love and respect for the two \\"elder sisters\\") and starts breaking up .... that's where I break up too!<br /><br />I must end by saying that even though my race and gender gets knocked a little bit by the negative portrayals, both justified and unjustified, this is a must see chick flick for any human who has an ounce or more of universal love within them regardless of race or gender! A 5 STARS MOVIE!

B00127RAJY|5.0|I've been a pretty active person for most of my life - I've been working out 4-5 days a week since I was in high school. After giving birth a year ago, I felt like I needed to jump-start my exercise routine. After hearing raves about this dvd from other new moms I decided to try it. All I can say is WOW. I actually considered skipping Level 1 since I consider myself to be an intermediate to advanced level exerciser. I'm so glad I didn't! I was sore the next day. I've been doing it every other day for a little more than a month and just started Level 3 yesterday. I'm so sore, but I'm loving it because I know I'm getting an effective workout.    I highly recommend this dvd to everyone, but especially to new moms. We all know we have at least a few pounds to lose and not much free time to work out. Even if your little one only naps for 25 minutes at a stretch you will still have plenty of time to complete a workout. I love the Shred and will continue doing it for quite a while!

B00204AA0O|4.0|Regina Spektor has been stricken with the 'smooth' production bug. Her last album, \\"Begin To Hope\\" was raw, original and innovative. It took her first three albums and capitalized and consolidated her sound. \\"Far\\", unfortunately, is competent, but not very creative.<br /><br />Sure, there are glimmers of that old Spektor originality like the amnestic \\"Eet\\", the charming \\"Folding Chair\\", and the robotic \\"Machine\\". There's even a vocal moment of bliss during the middle section of \\"Human Of The Year\\" where she hits a vocal tone she's never hit before. There is the wry \\"Laughing With\\" and the droll \\"Dance Anthem Of The 80's\\".<br /><br />The problem is that the production sterilizes the music. Sanitizes Spektor for a more marketable target audience. Sure, the producers are great, Jeff Lynne, Jacknife Lee, David Kahne and Mike Elizondo, but let me tell you from experience--Jeff Lynne can really be both blessing and curse, just listen to Tom Petty. No, Spektor should have gone with one producer, someone less known.<br /><br />That being said, \\"Far\\" for all it's homogeneity, for all its watered down ideas, is still equal to \\"Begin To Hope\\", just in a far different way. The melodies are intact, the lyrics are still developing and maturing. Spektor certainly avoids any cringe-worthy moments as are found on her first two albums. \\"Far\\" is good, not great. It is somewhat of a letdown, but not a complete washout.<br /><br />Here's how \\"Far\\" compares to Spektor's other works:<br /><br />2001 11:11: Two and a Half Stars<br />2002 Songs: Three Stars<br />2004 Soviet Kitsch: Three and a Half Stars<br />2006 Begin To Hope: Four Stars<br />2009 Far: Four Stars
0486237664|5.0|I loved this Book!  I first saw it at the library and checked it out.  But when I got it home and started looking at it, I knew I had to have it for my library.  Great graphic drawings of animals in different poses.
B00004U8JV|5.0|I'm probably one of the few people that likes The Lost World waaaaay better than Jurassic Park 3. Apart from Sam Neill and Laura Dern, I thought the acting was horrendous in 3 and about ruined the whole film. They didn't have much of a good script to work with, though. In this one however, everybody is great and Jeff Goldblum is brilliant as usual. I don't think the plot is as poor as people've made it out to be. It possibly could've happened, and sure the girl doing gymnastics on the raptor was silly but the trailer hanging over the cliff scene was much scarrier than anything on JP3. There's more deaths and violence in Lost World which could take away from the magic but it adds more to the concept that they're very dangerous creatures. Both Lost World and JP3 have a lot of action, but it feels overkill and monontonous in JP3. Maybe I'm being unfair and should watch the 3rd one again, but this movie definitley doesn't deserve all the criticism it's received!
0143113100|4.0|Overall, this book came off as enjoyable and exciting, as well as scientifically enlightening.  The author does a good job of relating the current research in the field of neuroplasticity to techniques we can use in our daily lives.  The software developments Doidge tells about are especially relevant -- games that can teach us to think better? Do tell!  I can't wait for the knockoffs.    The only reason it got four stars instead of five is because the author had an axe to grind about how animal rights activists delayed some of these developments in neuroscience, and so complained about the animal rights activists and then completely ignored the ethical issues.      Human life outweighs many considerations, and many extraordinary developments, including things we take for granted like surgical techniques and antibiotics, owe their existence to certain cruelties of medicine. It's disingenuous for such a brilliant author to respond to ethical criticism by skipping the issue entirely, and I understand why it might have been a sore point, but it would have been nice, *especially* after the slings and arrows of ill-thought activism, to see his reasoned take on the matter of this ethical ambiguity -- and an otherwise great book is poorer for the lack of it.  Aside from that, I can wholeheartedly recommend this one.
B0026NWBY2|3.0|But it's cheap $. There are several very KEY songs missing as has been noted, such as Bangla Desh, Dark Horse and Crackerbox Palace. I prefer studio recordings and wished they had used them instead of the live ones. Then, most long time fans will not be completely satisfied with any comp CD of George's music.     There is a lot to recommend here. George Harrison was a premiere rock song writer and his post-Beatles work was by far the BEST of any of the Beatles - yet it doesn't get the credit or exposure that Lennon or McCartney's do.
1573300403|4.0|There are some standout reasons to own this DVD:<br />- Smooth Criminal - The original version (from Moonwalker), not the horrible blurry remix video<br />- 1995 MTV VMA performance.  Amazing Dangerous choreography. Great medley.<br />- Billie Jean - Motown 25 performance - totally classic MJ moment in history.<br />- Videos from History hits like They don't really care about us, Scream, SiM, Earth Song<br />-$8.99? what a bargain for some of the greatest music videos of all time<br /><br />Thriller and Beat It are amazing as always, but they were also on History - Video Greatest Hits (Vol. 1), so not sure they needed to be repeated here, when they could have added Leave me Alone or The Super Bowl performance to make it a better collection that goes together.  I would say this DVD would rule out needing the Vol 1. except Vol. 1 has the full versions of Bad, Remember the Time, B&W, and The Way you make me Feel, which makes it totally worth getting as well.  The two together make almost a complete collection.  I also highly recommend getting live in bucharest.  What would I love to see released?  One DVD with all the videos that were short films in their full lengths, the ones on these two dvds with Ghosts and You Rock my World added :)<br /><br />One caveat, I find it really annoying that you have to flip the disc over 1/2 way through.  With a run time of 106 minutes there is no reason on earth it can't all be on one side.  That's probably my main reason for taking away a star.  However, I do think this is absolutely worth getting as Michael Jackson was a music video and performance genius!

This debut novel is beautifully written, told from Alice's point of view.  The author does a wonderful job of presenting the confusions, memory lapses, and gradual loss of \\"self\\" the disease heaps upon Alice.

B00004WG2F|5.0|A masterpiece in its genre, post Indian war frontier films, Montana in that case. A masterpiece too because of the three sons entirely entrusted to their ex-officer of a father because of the running away of the mother who could not stand the cold winters of Montana and was afraid of grizzly bears, that loving friendly species of furry animals more or less the cousins of our home-friendly teddy bears. Then the eldest son goes to the city of his mother to study and comes back with a fianc&eacute;e, but it is 1914 and the three sons can only follow their patriotic call to go and fight in Europe on the English side. The father is furious but nothing can stop that call of the wild. The picture of the first world war is dramatic when you see these British soldiers running to the German lines with simple rifles and no helmets when the Germans have machine guns, helmets of course and gas masks against their poisonous gases. The eldest son is killed and the youngest son does what an old Indian rite tells him to do. He gets the heart of his brother out and eventually sends it back to his father for it to be buried in due place. Then he gets his Indian colors on his face and goes out to kill and scalp two German machine-gun operators, two of your teeth for one of my teeth. The middle son, wounded on one leg, is sent home and the younger son eventually comes back home. The real stake of the film then is Susanna, the fianc&eacute;e of the elder son who was killed in the war. She was in love before the departure of the three brothers and still is after the war with the younger son, a wild but thrilling personality. A competition between the two surviving brothers starts then. Susanna chooses the younger one, but his wild side, what the Indian story teller calls his bear side, calls him away and he yields to that call and leaves the ranch for several years in order to discover the world and conquer his thirst, hunger and even his ravenous greed for the unknown and the savage. When he comes back Susanna has gone to the middle brother who has become a congressman in the meantime. The younger son, Justin, then accepts the situation and marries the daughter of the main family working on the ranch, from an Indian mother and an American father. He will get two children from her but he will try to compete with the prohibition traffickers who have the full support of the local sheriff. That will lead to a drama, the death of his wife, then his vengeance as soon as he is out of prison, on bail I suspect, and the attempt of the main moonshiner with the help of the sheriff to come and kill that rebellious man. And there the plot thickens and from dramatic we jump to tragic. And the main character of the story all get the ends they deserve, the middle brother, the younger brother, Susannah, the father and all the others, including the local moonshiner and his police friends. The end of the younger brother, in 1963 mind you, is absolutely brilliant. Add to that very strong story the beautiful and breathtaking landscape and mountains of Montana and you really enjoy every single scene. And after it all, when the last die is thrown on the marble of the tombstone you keep in mind the strong images about the first world war and the no less strong discourse of the father against all kinds of war that are declared bad by principle. Are they really bad by principle? Is there nothing to save a war now and then? For this film certainly not, and that is the fault of the politicians who are ready to do any kind of profitable maneuver to keep their juicy positions in government.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines, CEGIDack Susanna has gone to the middle brother who has become a congressman in the meantime.

1400063736|5.0|Philippe Petit's heart-stopping performance, as he walks between the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center in 1974,  becomes the pivotal event of this magnificent  \\"New York novel\\" in which Colum McCann examines many facets of the city's life.  Focusing first on the down-and-outers--prostitutes, the desperately poor, the drug- and alcohol-addicted homeless, the infirm elderly, gang members, casual thieves, and bright young people with no futures--he recreates the lower depths of New York, a place where its citizens every day walk the fine line between survival and death on a completely different tightrope from that of Philippe Petit.<br /><br />The novel begins with the arrival in the South Bronx of Ciaran Corrigan from Ireland, seeking his younger brother John Andrew, known simply as \\"Corrigan\\" or \\"Corry,\\" a monk who has studied in Belgium and who now lives a bare-bones life among addicts and prostitutes in the projects in the South Bronx.  Often the brunt of their jokes and sometimes of fists, he provides a way-station for the prostitutes who need a place to stop between tricks.  Two of them, Tillie and her daughter Jazzlyn, have good intentions and great street smarts, but they are unable to escape their surroundings, which offer a much-needed quick buck and help them support Jazzlyn's two little girls--and her dangerous drug habit.  Ciaran, afraid for the physical and emotional welfare of Corry, tries to persuade him to return home to Ireland, but Corry, in the midst of a spiritual crisis, will not take the easy way out of the ministry he believes he was meant for.<br /><br />Misery is not limited by economic boundaries here, however, as McCann also shows through other characters, in other parts of the city.  The emotional paralysis of Claire Soderberg, a Park Avenue matron, unable to resume her life after the death of her only child in Vietnam, is shared by her support group of four other mothers from all over the city, who have similar devastating losses.  An artist from upstate New York, involved in a terrible accident in the city, is overwhelmed by her sense of guilt, and an educated Guatemalan immigrant, who had hoped to finish medical school in the U.S., must let go of her dreams.  Each of these people must find some source of enduring beauty, however small, in order to go on. Dense and impressionistic in style, McCann illuminates the lives of many well-developed characters living in various parts of New York City, always doubling back to images of Phillipe Petit on his tightrope, and always showing his characters' overlaps.<br /><br />Life in general is \\"nasty, brutish, and short\\" here, with no guarantees that it will ever improve, and as Tillie says of her life, \\"I don't know who God is, but if I meet him anytime soon ... I'm going to slap Him stupid.\\"  In the final section of the novel, McCann fast-forwards to 2006, as a character studies an inspirational photo of Philippe Petit walking on his tightrope, with a low-flying plane above him, the plane appearing to be just a few feet from flying into the World Trade Center:  \\"As if the walking man were somehow anticipating what would come later...[But] the plane passes, the tightrope walker gets to the end of the wire. Things don't fall apart...the man alone against scale, still capable of myth in the face of all other evidence.\\"  In his gorgeous, lyrical descriptions of Philippe Petit's walk, McCann suggests that this walk may be an extraordinary \\"gift\\" of beauty to a city which, collectively, may have thought it had seen it all.  With this novel, however, McCann makes another such gift, an extraordinary homage to New York, with all its flaws, its traumas, its heartbreak--and its moments of great beauty.<br /><br />[[ASIN:0312421974 This Side of Brightness: A Novel]]<br />[[ASIN:0312423187 Dancer: A Novel]]<br />[[ASIN:0312423381 Fishing the Sloe-Black River: Stories]]<br />[[ASIN:0812973984 Zoli: A Novel]]pstate New York, involved in a terrible accident in the city, is overwhelmed by her sense of guilt, and an educated Guatemalan immigrant, who had hoped to finish medical school in the U.S., must let go of her dreams.

0061231401|5.0|I have read every Sigma Force book, as I enjoy adventure stories.  After a rocky start, I've really enjoyed the last few, until the last one, The Last Oracle.  It was not nearly as good as the previous few, I just could not suspend disbelief on all the wacky stuff that kept happening.  SO, I was a little nervous about reading this new one, but I was so very wrong.  This was totally believable from beginning to end (you know, as far as these major action stories go!), loved the twists, loved the mystery of the \\"Key,\\" as well as the social commentary on the world's food supply (thus the 'nod' the Crichton).  There was even a great scene where Monk's prosthetic hand came in 'handy,' if you'll pardon the pun.<br /><br />One of the things I particularly enjoyed was the section after the novel, where the author explains about the stuff in the book, and the vast majority of it exists or is a true commentary, on some level, of what's happening now.  That really made it that much more realistic, that he took so much 'reality' and melded it into an action thriller.  I appreciated knowing that!!!<br /><br />A Home Run for Rollins!!!<br /><br />If you enjoy this one, try Clive Cussler (fav was Atlantis Found, but most before it were quite good, his later ones aren't nearly as good), Michael Crichton (Congo, Sphere, Jurassic Park, Lost World, Next, Prey, Timeline, all excellent!!!), and, of the other Sigma Force novels, my earlier favorite was Black Order.

0143034901|4.0|I picked this up at Costco on a whim.  Found the story totally engrossing.  I found my self so wrapped up in the book I didn't want to put it down, but sometimes had to anyway as I found it totally draining.  Not predictable at all.  Usually I can figure out where the writer is going early on and I did have some things figured out, but there were still surprises.  Good read - I recommend it if you're not looking for something light.
B00004S367|5.0|It is no secret that Stevie is a genius. Its a shame he has watered down his music into stuff that just pays bills now. He has grown old and fat just like his music. This album was when he was young lean and mean. He was dealing with Berry's doubts about his music and wanted to do something different. Although blind, Stevie used to listen to movies and musicals especially one done by Rodgers and Hammerstein.He also was intrigued by the Beatles and the Stones. He later would open for the Stones. He longed to bring out the side of himself that these guys helped to create. With almost a million dollars (9.3 million in our time)he went ahead and did this album. It seems he just placed a cathode in his brain and poured out this stuff. It changed mine and many others lives. Stevie observed the way Marvin Gaye approached music and decided to do the same. I can hear the conflict going on inside a young 21 year old man dealing with war, sex, love, fame, marriage, and religion. You can almost live it with him as he is influenced by his ever loving mother, his new fiance, and his chip he had on his shoulder for Berry.  My favorite song is \\"love everything about you\\". You can tell he was dealing with the relationship he had with Syreeta and how others were telling him to break up with her due to her older nagging ways. I had the chance to meet Stevie back in the seventies and noticed how Syreeta was getting frustrated with his exploding stardom. Women from all over were trying to get a piec of him and he loved it. He told me father that he loved him some P...y! I wish Stevie was less interested in making babies and singing his pop tunes and that he would do us a favor and sing some of the other songs he so richly wrote. Evil is a great tune and his voice is prime in it. I love the mixing of the tracks as well. I wtruly wish someone would sit him down and play the five fab albums he wrote and let him hear the pure innocence he had at that time.
B0017UOU9Y|5.0|Maggot Brain is a 1971 album by the American funk band Funkadelic. It was released on Westbound Records. The music swings through psychedelia, hard rock, gospel and soul music, with tremendous variation between each track.<br /><br />In 2003, the album was ranked number 486 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time. Pitchfork Media ranked it #17 in their Top 100 Albums of the 70s list.<br /><br />\\"Maggot Brain\\" - The song's story<br /><br />According to legend, George Clinton, under the influence of LSD, told Eddie Hazel to play the first half of the song like his mother had just died and to play the second half as if he had found out she was alive (other variants of the story suggest that he was simply told to play as if he had found his mother dead.) The result was the 10-minute guitar solo for which Hazel is most fondly remembered by many music critics and fans. Though several other musicians began the track playing, Clinton soon realized the power of Hazel's solo and faded them out so that the focus would be on Hazel's guitar (the band can only truly be heard during the end of the song, and even then, it is barely audible.) The entire track was recorded in one take.[1] The solo is played in a pentatonic minor scale in the key of E over another guitar track of a simple arpeggio. Hazel's solo was played through a fuzzbox and a wah pedal; some sections of the song utilize a delay effect. This style would be revisited later in Standing on the Verge of Getting It On on the track \\"Good Thoughts, Bad Thoughts\\". The original version with full band accompaniment was released in 1997 on the album \\"Funkadelic Finest\\".

0061537969|3.0|The early part of Racing in the Rain I found to be stilted and amateurish, as though the author (human) was having trouble with dialogue for his dog, Enzo.  However, as the book progressed perhaps he improved on Enzo's thoughts or I was just caught up in the tale.  I am an animal lover, not a fan of racing, so many parts of this book troubled me when others mistreated or demeaned Enzo.  I found it hard to grasp that Eve would not see a doctor and more disturbing that her loving husband didn't force the issue.  Where was his head?????  So many things in this book bothered me, but I plunged on.  It is the selection of my small book club, so that's why I read it.  The problems Denny encountered were almost too much.  I could buy the selfish actions of his in-laws since newspapers often carry stories of grandparents trying to get custody, but the girl Annika?!  The descriptions of her actions I found comical and Enzo's description of her breasts a bit strange.  And Denny seemed dense to the dangers of taking Annika to his home.  Recognizing he was exhausted and had much on his mind, he still was not the brightest bulb in the package.  Normally, I steer away from animal books since they disturb me and bring tears.  SPOILER ALERT:  I didn't cry at the death of Eve, but I did when Enzo passed.  I have never had a dog or cat die a natural death, so that was so much easier on Denny than if it had been otherwise.  After all was 'fixed' we have a Hollywood ending that was nice, but hard to swallow.  I did not find this easy reading and it took me much longer than a 500 or 600 page book.  I think this book has a lot of merit for some and had an interesting plot, but I am glad to be through with it.

B000VDDDY6|5.0|Quite a few of us actually search out this dual format version because we still have an HD DVD player. That hi-def format may have been discontinued but the discs still work fine and look as good as the Blu-ray version. I'm glad to get HD and SD versions in the same box. Quite a deal!    The packaging is the only down side and you must be careful handling the two-sided discs. Otherwise it's 5 stars all the way.
B001FB4W0W|4.0|I used to avoid the whole vampire genre; it seemed dead to me. Where could daring writers take this medium after such epics as \\"Vampire in Brooklyn\\", \\"Jesus Christ Vampire Hunter\\" and \\"Salem's Lot\\"? Enter stage left: True Blood. I picked this up this on DVD because it was very cheap and I had an uneven coffee table that needed something this exact size. After being assured by the local pawns-men this was worth more than a well balanced table, I popped in disc one. To my amusement, I was warped to an alternate New Orleans where fake-blood swilling creatures of the night rubbed shoulders with four-toothed NASCAR fans. Immersed in a fantastical world, my mind raced: Where will this story go? After all this imagery would there be substance? Was this all flash and fake blood? After the third episode, it started to gel for me. This is a retelling of the best parts of the Bible, Moby Dick, some sliced up portions of The Wizard of Oz all wrapped up in 3 layers of social commentary. How does this happen? How do these writers weave such a multidimensional fable for the ages? I went from concerned coffee table owner, to wide-eye child-like wonderment, to skeptic, to fan, to enlightenment. Heck this is called True Blood. It seemed simple at first, but really what do they mean by True? Think about that. You see where I'm going here. The name of the fake blood is \\"true\\" the name of the show is \\"True Blood\\". These characters are being forced to live the lie of fake truth for a really real reality, in which, day walkers and night crawlers cycle on independent axis's within the same sphere. This is like when you were forced to go to the circus as a child. A large metal sphere rolls in to the arena being propelled by two clowns riding scooters. Gravity defying scooter heroics moving the round sliver cage betwixt the elephant dung and the human cannon ball. True synchronicity creating inertia from two clown-laden scooter-demons dancing within a sphere much larger than life. Dancing with sword jugglers, fire eaters. Dancing with the edge...<br /><br />Anna Paquin! She brings, sassy, head-strong independent womanhood to the forefront of this gem. Between her drawl, witty quips and Madonna like dental-styling I keep looking at the screen, hanging on every word. Her character Sookie shines a bright light on a world that might otherwise be too heady, too dark and too real. What's the frosting on this cake? She's hot: like, Denny's waitress hot, and then some. Almost Applebee's waitress hot, but let's not bring Applebees in to this, they're a great family eatery that delivers on the fun and the food. Olive Garden hot, yeah, that's probably the most accurate. And for newbies, she plays a star-crossed waitress so it's all very fitting. Very fitting indeed. See what I mean by three layers?<br /><br />So here I am, I've just returned from local pawnshop after watching every episode of season 1. The pawns-men and I had a good laugh. He even offered me some punch and called it True Blood. I ended up putting my beloved wonky coffee table up for sale as a down payment on the season 2 dvd set. I got some NASCAR beef jerky with cheese in the middle too though, it was a good deal. As I left I looked at the front of the shop and chuckled, this is where the magic started and here I was again, ready for the next wave. Life is funny sometimes.th sword jugglers, fire eaters.

B000M3452Y|4.0|James Murphy has really put it all together with his LCD Soundsystem project. This band displays influences as diverse as funk, electronica, punk, krautrock, glamrock, dance and more. Some may consider the tracks to be repetitive, but a big part of Murphy's plan is rooted in build-up and crescendo over superficially repetitive vamps. That said, when you dig deeper, you find that that's not the case, as there's enough subtle shading and variations to keep the proceedings interesting. Murphy's cleverly comic and frenetic vocals only help add to the sense of buildup. I tend to find it all to be a mesmerizing ride. The varied sounds, ranging from vintage production values to the tasteful use of old-fashioned synths, really makes this project consistently interesting to the ears. While it might be fair to characterize Murphy's influences as derivative and dated, that is precisely his aim here; and his perfect balance in displaying said influences aptly demonstrates his shrewd ear for production and his knack for writing an eminently infectious groove.  Great project and I hope to hear more sonic goodness in the future.

B000ZEE3I6|4.0|I never thought I would be disappointed by \\"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince\\" movie adaptation. My expectations were not high. The book is so great it is simply impossible to spoil the movie. Alas, I was mistaken.<br /><br />It was surprising how unbalanced the plot was. Seems like too much emphasis was put on the romantic relationships. So much so that we completely lost touch with the main theme of battle of good vs evil. Don't get me wrong, I loved Ron/Hermione/Lavender and Harry/Ginny scenes in the book. But in the movie these scenes overshadowed the main event - Dumbledore's death and Snape's seeming betrayal. I remember crying over this scene while reading the book, I remember despising Snape. No luck here. The crucial scenes went by in the movie so fast that I didn't have a chance to feel anything for anybody. At all.<br /><br />The love between Harry and Ginny never blossomed, there was no chemistry between the actors unfortunately. Slughorn came off as an old whimp. Where was the Order, where were Death Eaters, where was Voldemort? Forget it, instead we got endless fluffy teenage romance scenes.<br /><br />The only redeeming scenes in the movie belonged to Draco. I felt his moments, although never written, were brilliant. I thought he totally stole this movie.<br /><br />Overall, the movie was just too light, too long, too anti-climatic and yes, even boring at times. Where were the darkness, the tragedy, the feeling of an impending doom? Sadly, gone...<br /><br />I would certainly recommend watching this movie, even just for glorious visuals effects. But ultimately, this movie was a disappointment.
B000002W9Q|5.0|This is wonderful. Sure does take me back to a gentler, stress free time in my life. I was in my mid 20s in the 80s but loved this music. I ordered this one along with Footloose and Flashdance because it was package deal I just couldn't ignore. I couldn't be happier. With the exception of needing a pile driver to open the darn sealing tape on the top of each jewel case (whew!), these are in excellent condition, sound amazing, and I can't stop singing along (but I can't understand why the room clears when I begin to sing...) Even peeling potatoes for supper I found myself clumsily dropping stuff into the sink because I couldn't keep my feet from dancing around the kitchen. Even one of the dogs got so excited feeding off my newfound energy and lifted spirits that he was prancing in circles along with me. Now THAT takes some doing seeing as how he is 12 years old. All 3 of these CDs are big hits in this household and I am so happy I took advantage of the 3fer offer. Funny, after all these years, I STILL can't decipher all the words to Flashdance's \\"Going on a Manhunt\\"...
B0000AI45P|4.0|Side One is astonishing; It offers up an avalanche of gnarly, glistening urban psychedelic punk, with guitars that gurgle, froth, tangle, giggle, and swoon under the Highway 61 revisiting vocals of Tom Verlaine. The only real chore is picking out a favorite, what with all four tacks one-upping each other with such relentlessness and valor. Sometimes I imagine that \\"See No Evil,\\" with its intertwining melodies locked into one gleaming fist of sound, has won me over, but then \\"Venus\\" comes sighing into view and wipes my mind clean with the cracked beauty of its chorus. \\"Friction\\" tears off in the other direction, with Verlaine's bitterness sounding every bit as endearing as his dream-speak. And then the title track comes on, and I'm in another (vastly superior) world for ten minutes.     Side Two slow-plays you; It's not as immediately satisfying or as memorable as the first half of Marquee Moon, but it gets better and better with successive listens. Here, it's all about fluttering guitar pop, with guitars that skip and stumble. \\"Prove It\\" is every bit as gorgeous and enchanting as the stuff on side one, and what a great vocal! \\"Torn Curtain\\" offsets its dull, dirging verses with the hypnotic soulmelt of its chorus. \\"Elevation\\" and \\"Guiding Light\\" are stuffed with pretty little moments.    A damn good album, then. Get it, and be sure to get the reissue with all the bonus tracks, so you can have the way-cool \\"Little Johnny Jewel\\" single.

B000002KNY|3.0|For their third album, Talking Heads dig deeper into the arty funk and urban paranoia that had simmered on their earlier efforts. David Byrne's quirk, innocence, and anxiety seem to reach a breaking point, entering realms of surreal panic that even \\"Psycho Killer\\" couldn't have foreseen. \\"Heaven\\" vents an almost suicidal desire for peace and quiet, while \\"Paper\\" bubbles with existential panic. The music is grimier and more labyrinthine, with Brian Eno stuffing electronic jitters into the cracks of their funky brain-pop wall of sound.     Which is both the advantage and the downfall of this record. On the one hand, it furthers many of the things that make Byrne and friends so appealing; there's jittery paranoia, fractured pop, and nervous energy to be found in tracks like \\"Cities,\\" \\"Air,\\" and \\"Life During Wartime.\\" Problem is, there's also less wit, charm, poignance, and willful naivete. Nothing wrong with moving on, of course- I wouldn't admire Talking Heads so much if they spent their whole career rewriting \\"The Big Country\\" and \\"Don't Worry About The Government\\"- but the problem is that they replace their endearing innocence with... well, with nothing. There's a certain hollowness to Fear Of Music that simply doesn't exist on any other Talking Heads record. I find myself completely unmoved by a lot of these tracks. \\"Animals\\" has this really annoying Cookie Monster vocal and no musical qualities that are worth mentioning, while \\"Memories Can't Wait\\" falls flat on a stiff guitar riff. And speaking of guitars... \\"Electric Guitar\\" has a plodding rhythm, a turgid main melody, and an okay-at-best Byrne performance. \\"I Zimbra\\" is fun enough, but not much more than that. Sorry, but I can't run with the crowd on this one.
B001R4KQDE|5.0|Oh. My. God.  Blu-ray was made for this.<br /><br />Every single pore on an actor's face.<br /><br />Every single strand of an actor's hair.<br /><br />This is one of the two or three most impressive live-action blu-ray discs ever released.  The stylish part-animated scenes are beautiful with their detail in backgrounds and crispness in foregrounds.  The close-ups show every crater in every face, every reflection off a spot of blood on every cheek, every fuzzy hair on every lip or brow.  Even dark scenes have no apparent black crush.  Not a trace of disturbing film grain or digital noise touches this picture.  There may never be another occasion to make a film on blu-ray disc that is this pretty, this perfect in every respect.  The opening scene is one that many filmgoers have dreamt of seeing in beautiful digh-definition, with glourious colours added in just the right places, and finally here it is.<br /><br />A film noir mixed with comic-book sensibilities, \\"Sin City\\" is a masterpiece of popular art.  It's \\"Pulp Fiction\\" with better art direction and an even more stylized sense of the absurd setting.  It's the hardboiled detective's own incarnation of John Ford; it's the art house Akira Kurosawa for nihilists who wished they were romantics.<br /><br />The film is a visual treat, 90% black & white but with coloration added for artistic purpose in spare amounts.  Its detail and style are unparalleled.  Nobody makes a film like this anymore, nobody ever dared, and it's a miracle the Weinsteins funded this one in the first place.<br /><br />The Canadian blu-ray disc release got alot of positive press when the US version was yet unreleased.  The US version lives up to every expectation and is excellent in every respect.  If you have the DVD version of this film, this is one of the few I insist you upgrade to blu-ray.  But don't trade your old one in, as this one doesn't have the pack-in bonuses like the graphic novel included with the DVD edition.
B000000OTY|5.0|Great live album.  Peter Gabriel's songs are better when heard live.  I've seen several videos related to this tour and have been really impressed.  I have not actually seen Peter live in person. I saw Genesis in 1978 in New Orleans.  Although I really injoyed the show, I was upset because Peter had already left the band.  I feel that Peter's move to go solo was the best thing for not only himself but for the music lovers out there that like good, well written songs that also have a captivating sound.  He continues to surround himself with some of the best musicians in the world which make his songs shine as some of the best in rock-n-roll or new world music.  I recommend this disc set to anyone.  The music is great!
B001JKGF9A|4.0|The God Delusion is one of the latest in a series of books that denies the existence of God or any of the many monothiestic gods populating the earth (pick one). It is a well written, reasoned book by Richard Dawkins. He along with Christopher Hitchins, Daniel Dennett etc. are engaging mostly in an intellectual exercise that sells lots of books. After all, it's a living. Very few believers would even pickup Dawkins' book, especially with it's tone of ridicule, belittlement & shame. That never works on anyone. This is not his target demographic. But he does not tire in poking fun of people who embrace a religion as a path to an non-existent entity. But there are billions of believers & there are billions of fence-sitters, agnostics & don't give a damn folks. They will buy, listen & read his words. One of his main talking points refuting the theory of Intelligent Design is Darwin's theory of evolution partuicularly the part concerning Natural Selection. To him it is so clear & obvious that a child can grasp it. Believers are not children but they'd also learn somthing. In any case there are are six billion people on this planet & presumably more in the universe that God must tend to. How important must person think they are that God is paying attention  when they thank him/her for a favor granted (such as getting a base hit), or asking, thru prayer for a favor. That he/she can even pay attention  boggles the mind.
B000ZELISO|2.0|JR reviewer gets it right. As adult fans of both HP books and movies this one just missed it by miles. I think we all need to chant loud enough together to shake the earth under Warner's feet....\\"WE WANT THE BATTLE>>>>WE WANT THE FUNERAL>>>>WE WANT A WEE BIT MORE ACCURACY to the book. But insulting the fans by not including the great battle at the end closer to the books rendition was most unkind. Not just unthoughtful but down right mean and cruel. I was upset many years ago after Chris Columbus first assured he would make all 7 movies and stay as close to the books as was reasonable.... his \\"all actors have to be UK born\\" rhetoric& promises to both JKR and...the world viewers. Yet when most are 8-12 year olds and as adult fans we too could care less about the MOVIE BIZ perse which CC was really concerned and posturing to back then. But then what happened....by Movie 3...CC was bored stiff and wanted out & somehow he was allowed to distance himself....so what does CC make of this mess. I would like to see JK Rowling herself step up if she has anything to say these days about the let down of this movie to her fans. And also please Ms. Rowling....please if you have influence rights still make sure the next so called two movie episodes will be done to honor the viewers and readers and all YOUR fans alike...do it right Warners. This missed by a mile. What happened? Warner insulted not just the fans of course but Rowling herself.  I debated on giving it only a 1 star. But there were some redeeming parts. The responsible people behind this sad cut needs to be kicked to the curve. Make the movie longer to tell it right if you need to...kids and adult fans alike would agree. Anyone up for a remake of this one? Send your votes to Warners!
B0000025KI|5.0|I was in high school when this album was released and my girlfriend gave it to me as a Christmas present.  Being what you could call a \\"music freak\\" but from the South (Georgia), I really hadn't listened to much of Bruce's work prior to that point.  I'd obviously heard \\"Hungry Heart\\" on the radio prior to receiving the album but wasn't necessarily enthusiastic about it.  As a matter of fact, Bruce's voice on that track sounded much different to me than his earlier songs that I'd heard (and even to other songs on \\"The River\\").  In any case, after hearing \\"The River\\" track (LP 1, track 6) I was definitely hooked.  I'm a big fan of lyricists and that song will probably remain my all time favorite for the rest of my life.  I realize that, like all others that write reviews for this album, have their own personal reasons for liking/not liking this one.  I like most of the songs but not all of them.  Being that it came out during a very impressionable time for me, I will always hold a special place in my heart for it.  It reminds me of friends that I still have and some that were lost over the years.  And that's all I can ask of a record ...
B00024I2Z4|5.0|I love the DVD Mulan that I purchased on Amazon.com.  I was pleased that the movie was shipped to me in a timely manner, and the that it arrived at my door in excellent condition.  Thank you for the great merchandise!  I highly recommend this seller.  I know that I will definitely make another purchase in the future.
B000G6BJS0|5.0|The Shostakovich Jansons box set is recorded over almost a 20 year period.  The undisputable gems are the 1st, 5th, 7th, 11th, and 15th. In short Jansons is strong where Shostakovich's popularity is generally strong.  When I say gems I mean they are like diamonds.  Not only are they the best in the set they are some of the best recorded and performed Shostakovich ever.  The most popular Shostakovich symphony the 5th was recorded live with the Vienna Philharmonic which is probably the greatest orchestra in the world at the time.  It's hard to find this version as a single now although it deserves to be in every serious Shostakovich collection.  The 1st symphony is with the second greatest symphony orchestra in the world the Berlin Philharmonic!  It is played and interpretted with precision.  It is my favorite 1st in print only otherwise available coupled with the piano concertos of Shostakovich with Mikhail Rudy.  The 15th symphony is with the London Philharmonic. It is sometimes perceived as quirky, but Jansons gets it right in the slow movements.  Also sometimes out of print and very valuable recording.<br />The 7th is almost historic being played by the then Leningrad Philharmonic.  I didn't look at the credits to see if they changed to the St. Petersburg PO.(same city). This 7th used to be in my top three picks out of about 50 recordings that I have of it.  The 11th is a very underrated symphony and Jansons shows why it is one of Shostakovich's strongest dark horses.  This alone should sell you on this set. But there is more.....<br /><br />Jansons recorded the 6th and the 9th early in his career. They are very good don't get me wrong, but the Largo is the 6th and the psuedo-slow movement in the 9th are both just a tad fast kind of like Mravinsky.  His 8th seems a little out of place.  Oddly enough there is a part of a rehearsal included on the CD with the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra. The 10th is good, but I am really picky when it comes to this great work.  I would probably take Karajan or Jarvi over Jansons.<br /><br />More or less the rest of the set the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 12th, 13th, and 14th are with the Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra.  Jansons has matured, but at the same time he has lost some steam.  The best with the BRSO is the 14th symphony which everyone hates because it is really song cycle. If you just listen to the percussion and strings Jansons does a top notch job.  Only the soprano with her whispery wispy voice seems to mar this otherwise outstanding performance. The 13th is the next best CD and the bass soloist has recorded this for about the fourth time on CD!  I think he is getting a little bit tired.  The 12th symphony passes with my friends and they like it so I won't comment further.  The 2nd and 3rd symphonies are Shostakovich's worst and a good effort, but no prize.  The 4th symphony holds it's own with the competition.<br /><br />So ends the Jansons box set.  As I say this is about as good as you are going to do at this point.  Conductors are only good at conducting some symphonies of Shostakovich.  Giving the time frame here it is surprising just how cohesive this cycle is.<br /><br />If I were to guess another Shostakovich cycle I would say Haitink's, but then I hate his 14th symphony because it is in original languages.<br /><br />If you ask me about Kondrashin.  I would say that his interpretations seem to be more self-indulgent and lack the moderation that Jansons brings to a more tempered rendition.<br /><br />But staying focussed and on this Jansons set I think it is worth every penny especially what others are asking for their sets.  Don't forget the gems in this set either!<br /><br />[[ASIN:B000P733I4 Shostakovich - Complete Symphonies - Kondrashin (11 CD Set)]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:B000F3T7RO Shostakovich: The Complete Symphonies]]ly take Karajan or Jarvi over Jansons.

0307473465|1.0|THE READER has been billed as everything from a holocaust story to a love story.  It has been touted as a \\"must read\\" and has appeared on the LA Times Book of the Year list, as well as being an Oprah selection. (Being selected by Oprah should have been a dead give-away.....I have yet to like anything she selects).<br /><br />At any rate, one would think that this story of the relationship (both emotional and sexual) between a fifteen year old boy and a 40 year old woman played out against the aftermath of the Holocaust would present a compelling read, but if these were your expectations then you, like I, would be sadly disappointed.<br /><br />The lovers don't really share anything remotely related to love, Hannah is secretive and remote and as a couple the two protagonists are distant and unsympathetic (almost appearing as observers in their own lives rather that participants).  The courtroom scenes are bland, and the final revelation of \\"Hannah's secret\\" is an almost laughable \\"sin\\" when compared to the horrors of the concentration camps.<br /><br />This is one of those \\"what is it\\" stories.  Is it supposed to be the story of a country's collective guilt, a coming of age tale, a crusade for literacy, or just the mundane tale of a basically self-absorbed, insensitive woman and an impressionable young boy?  Whatever the author intended, all that comes across is a bland recitation of dates, times, facts and suppositions which fail to engage the reader.<br /><br />How Hollywood ever chose this monochromatic book as appropriate fodder for a movie is beyond me. If it were possible to give this book less than one star, I would.

B001KVZ6F2|5.0|I loved this movie, my husband loved this movie --everyone I know loved this movie.<br /><br />Why?? Such a great story where you actually get to feel what the chacters are feeling --raw emotion. The main character, Walt Kowalski (Eastwood), has just buried his wife. He lives alone, a retired Ford factory worker for some 50 years. A lapsed Catholic who despises the church, and a Veteran of the Korean War, he is a bitter man.<br /><br />Walt hates the way his neighborhood has been taken over by African-Americans, Hispanics and Asians. His new neighbours are Hmongs, mountain people from Laos, Vietnam and Thailand. Walt unwillingly becomes the mentor of a young Asian teenager who lives next door. Walt rejects any act of kindness shown by his sons, and then and later is rejected by them in turn. Walt is all for justice, and when the shy boy he has been mentoring, and his sister are attacked, Walt is determined to even the score.<br /><br />A well preserved 1972 Gran Torino in Walt's garage is his prized, but there is much much more to this story, and lessons to be learned by all.<br /><br />DON\\"T MISS 79 year old Clint Eastwood, at his finest!

0307387178|1.0|Although I have enjoyed every other Krakauer book I've read, this one was a huge disappointment.  The only saving grace is that I borrowed it rather than shelling out my own money for it.  This is the story of a self indulgent spoiled brat who died through his own stupidity.  While this may make for entertaing fiction, as a true story it's sickening.  It seems to be the authors goal to glorify the actions of a young man who threw off society's conventions and lived his own life.  Instead what you see is the utter disregard for his family and friends of someone who is self centered and in love with his own sense of finding the \\"truth\\".  Possibly the most ridiculous thing about the book is the title.  Into The Wild?  He was ten miles off a highway, living in a school bus that caribou hunters used during hunting season.  That might qualify as the wild if you live in Manhattan, but in Alaska?  If you're looking for a good book by Krakauer, pick up Into Thin Air or Under The Banner of Heaven, but leave this one on the shelf, you'll thank me later.
0060557818|5.0|This book drew me quickly into a world I found hard to leave and wishing there was more when the book had come to its conclusion.  The amazing array of characters from the London Above Richard to the London Below Lady Door, the Marquis,Earl's Court, Old Bailey, Hunter, and numerous others including a dastardly duo you will loathe and yet love at the same time. If you read to get away from it all then this is the book for you. If you read for entertainment then this is the book for you.  If you can turn the written word into your own visual images of the characters then this is the book for you.  Dare to enter London below because once you do you will find it hard to leave.
B000ZEE3I6|5.0|Just watched the newest screening. It's amazing. The art direction is stellar, and the story is executed very well. The love stories are nicely fit in. the action is extremely good, though the action in Goblet of Fire is yet to beaten.  Daniel Radcliffe has improved very much, and is not the douche bag he was in ORDER OF THE PHOENIX. In fact, he is the heart if the film. Micheal Gambon is the DUMBLEDORE we wanted in this film. Grint as RON is amazing, and we get to see how he gets rid of his predicament-in the form of Lavender Brown- amusingly. Emma Watson is better than Grint, and her performance is top-notch. She's also extremely gorgeous (I'm 15, I'm allowed to say that).  But the real scene-stealer is Rickman as Snape.He's awesome, and no one else can be Snape. This is MR. Alan's breakthrough performance.  The rest of the actors are magnificent, while Helena B. Carter and Maggie Smith shine. The only complaint is the girl who plays Lavender Brown. She plays her finely, but I hate her character. I guess she did a good job, then.  Bonnie Wright is really good (in acting, she needs to look better like Emma).  The art direction and effects are, as always, incredible.  It surpassed my expectations. As good as Goblet of Fire!  EDIT: WATCHED IT AGAIN. IT'S JUST BEAUTIFUL. SO BEAUTIFUL THAT I ALMOST DIED.

B001PPLIEG|5.0|This movie was truly the epitome of character performance. Craig delivers yet again. His Bond persona, deeply impacted by the death of Vesper Lynd, evolves from the impulsive, fresh spy to a cold blooded, calculated killer. The transformation is truly breathtaking. The actions seens are plentiful and easily keep an audience on the edge of their seats. I recommend a neck brace as fat people will fall off the edge.

After the first time I did it, I was very sore, but got used to it.It has good core workouts and o'brien leads you through proper posture and proper stance.

B001NY4X46|5.0|Just a couple of clarification points for anyone thinking about purchasing.    Screen Aspect Ratio is NOT 2.35 as shown in the Amazon Product Details.    The Screen Aspect Ratio is 1.85 and is Anamorphic, NOT Letterbox as on the 10-21-1998 DVD release.    GREAT movie, one of my top 10 movies .... Glad I now have the WS (1.85:1) Anamorphic format.
B000A2RRF4|5.0|This DVD is a must have for any MJ fan. From the very first minutes of the concert you are plunged into MJ's unsurpassed showmanship, when he's propulsed on stage and stays there without moving for a few minutes in front of an audience going literally crazy. What an amazing, admirable entertainer. His singing is great, his dancing tentalizing, his presence unforgettable. Really worth the purchase. I already watched it about 4 times and I can't get enough. Enjoy it!!!!! We miss you Michael
B001PA0FFO|4.0|From DEER HUNTER to DOUBT, Meryl Streep has undoubtedly cemented herself as probably the best American female actress of the last 30 years.  With 13 Oscar nominations, two Oscar wins, 16 Golden Globe nominations, 6 Golden Globe wins, and 2 SAG awards, Meryl Streep is one of the most decorated actresses of all time. The movie DOUBT is no different. As great as Phillip Seymour Hoffman is, Streep steals every scene she is involved in. Amy Adams is great as the submissive, sweet Sister James. Viola Davis, who is in the movie maybe 15 or so minutes, had me sold she was the character she was portraying.     Now as for the movie, some people call it slow. I watched it with some friends of mine, of which they love silly comedies and CGI action movies like TRANSFORMERS, and they didn't like the movie. I had seen it before at the theater and it was great. If you can't sit through a movie with an uncomfortable subject matter and a lot of dialouge, then this movie probably isn't for you. As mentioned, there is an uneasiness throughout the movie that can't be explained. It pulls you in and if you don't know the subject matter, that is all the better. I wish I could watch every movie I've seen again, but with no preconcieved opinion of it or memory of it. This movie is one of those because when you find out the issue at hand, it's very unsettling for you and the characters of the movies. This movie is an instant classic that will be watched in 20 years with the same prestige it has today, without a doubt.
0374139563|4.0|I bought this book cognizant of the negative reviews, and I break with them in giving this book four stars instead of one, two, or three stars.<br /><br />This book is worth reading, and it makes points that I summarize below that are in my view meritorious.<br /><br />The book loses one star for being Goldman Sachs pitch on emerging markets dressed up in a Don's robes.  I note with interest the 13 July 2009 Rolling Stone article by Matt Taibbi, \\"The Great American Bubble Machine\\".  I venture to suggest that the only thing worse than the combination of blind aid and unrestricted indigenous leadership corruption might be Goldman Sachs in charge of an African Union IPO.<br /><br />That having been said, I find the author's contribution quite worthwhile.  In condemning aid--and especially aid blindly given to dictators and known world-class thieves in high places--the author laments the cycle of corruption, disease, poverty, and aid dependency.<br /><br />As summarized by Niall Ferguson, chronicler to the banking barons (e.g. [[ASIN:1594201927 The Ascent of Money: A Financial History of the World]]), the author posits four alternatives:<br /><br />01  International Bonds<br /><br />02  Chinese and other Foreign Direct Investment (FDI)<br /><br />03  Free Trade with an emphasis on ending US and other subsidies (but later in the book the author also observes that the Africans themselves are killing each other with import taxation)<br /><br />04  Financial intermediation inclusive of micro-finance, home plot titles, and efficient trusted remittance (and savings) management.<br /><br />I met with the CEO of a $200 billion a year asset management company in January 2008, and all he could talk about was Emerging Markets.  It is in that context that this book strikes me as a massive pimping of Africa for Goldman Sachs.<br /><br />On a more interesting note, I find the author's passing and always favorable references to China's deepening engagement in Africa to be both helpful, and worthy of a separate book.  I have been studying China since 1975, am particularly admiring of the manner in which it uses non-governmental capabilities to \\"wage peace\\" and achieve its objectives, and have written a short memorandum easily found online, &lt;Chinese Irregular Warfare>.  Between their dominance of cyber-war, which includes the ability to incapacitate any US military platform, and their coherent strategy of creating the infrastructure they need to vacuum Africa of its resources, I am totally impressed.<br /><br />The other negative, one highlighted in another book on Africa, [[ASIN:1403976511 The Trouble with Africa: Why Foreign Aid Isn't Working]] is largely ignored in this book: the raw fact that African trade is down by half, or $70 billion a year.<br /><br />Overall I find in this book a useful summary of the history of aid to Africa from the 1960's, rooted at first in the proxy wars of the USA and the USSR, then going through phases focused on poverty, development, stabilization, and most recently good governance.<br /><br />In passing I am delighted to read of Paul Collier (Cf: [[ASIN:0255364660 Living Down the Past: How Europe Can Help Africa Grow (Studies in Trade and Development, 2)]] and his distinction among three categories of African countries:<br /><br />01  Resource poor with coastlines, do better than the other two<br /><br />02  Resource poor and landlocked (with a large part of the total African population locked in here)<br /><br />03  Resource rich with or without coastlines<br /><br />It is in connection with the latter that I note no mention of the looting of African natural resources by multinational corporations that have bribed their way into possession with exemption from virtually all export fees.<br /><br />In summarizing the negative impact of aid, the author states that after 60 years and $1 trillion in aid, there is nothing to show for it.  Clearly an over-statement, it is followed by the author's view that aid feeds corruption, reduces the middle class, undermines social capital, promotes conflict and black markets (William Shawcross says it better, see [[ASIN:0743200284 Deliver Us from Evil: Peacekeepers, Warlords and a World of Endless Conflict]]), promotes inflation, and reduces the value of exports.<br /><br />The author spends a few pages negating the impact of tribal and ethno-linguistic diversity (e.g. 1000 tribes across sub-Saharan Africa) but observes that the 1885 Berlin Conference and its partitioning of Africa did not help.  I quite agree, and point to the equal insanity of the Treaty of Westphalia, see Philip Allot's [[ASIN:0521016800 The Health of Nations: Society and Law beyond the State]].<br /><br />I rather like the conclusion, in which the author posits an ideal future in which each African nation (I prefer integrated economic zones myself) reduces its reliance on aid to 5% while substituting 30% trade led by China, 30% Foreign Direct Investment, 25% efficient use of remittances and internal savings now held back; and 10% from the capital markets, i.e. bonds.<br /><br />The author talks briefly of direct aid (\\"conditional cash transfers\\") to individuals instead of governments, and generally speaks of the Western mistake of aid with no strings, while China is \\"all business.\\"  Much of the author's discussion is facile, and the brilliant bibliography is not at all integrated into the work as a whole, but no matter.  This book was worth my time and money.<br /><br />The author's final paragraph struck me as worth quoting:<br /><br />\\"Africa's development impasse demands a new level of consciousness, a greater degree of innovation, and a generous dose of honesty about what works and what does not as far as development is concerned.

The author spends a few pages negating the impact of tribal and ethno-linguistic diversity (e.g. 1000 tribes across sub-Saharan Africa) but observes that the 1885 Berlin Conference and its partitioning of Africa did not help.  I quite agree, and point to the equal insanity of the Treaty of Westphalia, see Philip Allot's [[ASIN:0521016800 The Health of Nations: Society and Law beyond the State]].     I rather like the conclusion, in which the author posits an ideal future in which each African nation (I prefer integrated economic zones myself) reduces its reliance on aid to 5% while substituting 30% trade led by China, 30% Foreign Direct Investment, 25% efficient use of remittances and internal savings now held back; and 10% from the capital markets, i.e. bonds.    The author talks briefly of direct aid (\\"conditional cash transfers\\") to individuals instead of governments, and generally speaks of the Western mistake of aid with no strings, while China is \\"all business.\\"  Much of the author's discussion is facile, and the brilliant bibliography is not at all integrated into the work as a whole, but no matter.  This book was worth my time and money.    The author's final paragraph struck me as worth quoting:    \\"Africa's development impasse demands a new level of consciousness, a greater degree of innovation, and a generous dose of honesty about what works and what does not as far as development is concerned.

0385340575|4.0|Once again Jack Reacher has wandered off into the sunset, wounds healing nicely, ready to fight another day.<br /><br />Reacher shows up every year just about this time, avenges a horrific deed or two, kicks some butt, excuse the vernacular, beds a smart tough woman and then disappears. Here, today. \\"Gone Tomorrow,\\" just as the title promises. Before his departure Reacher gets tangled up with two vicious women with ties to al Qaeda who torture men with knives until they resemble butterflied racks of lamb with heartbeats. A lot more entertaining is the fact that author Lee Child, who sells a book every five seconds somewhere in the world, uses Osama bin Laden, goats and inappropriate in close proximity.<br /><br />The story starts off with Reacher on a New York subway at 2 a.m. He spots a woman he deduces is very likely a suicide bomber. He confronts her and he realizes, too late, that he is only half-right. The only one Susan Mark eliminates is herself. New York police question Reacher, as do others with ties to unnamed federal agencies. They are dangerous men who establish that they have no problem killing civilians to get what they want. As Reacher gets more enmeshed in the mysterious details surrounding the woman's death, he gets more interested. He discovers that Mark was carrying data downloaded from the government that would compromise a U.S. senator a little bit and al Qaeda a lot. Weapons of destruction include hammers; guns; butcher, carving and double-edged knives; fists, hands and feet; dart guns intended for gorillas; and very sharp, very powerful elbows.<br /><br />Reacher, a 6-foot, 5-inch former military cop, may be a finely honed killer and master deductive thinker, but he's a bit too predictable. One, this hero's only flaws are his mounting battle scars, though after \\"Gone Tomorrow,\\" even his scars will no longer be considered flaws. Two, he's always right. Three, he's a font of arcane facts. If he didn't possess steel-belted muscle fiber, he'd be a tiresome know-it-all. Maybe that's why he keeps moving. He can't risk getting found out.<br /><br />I like a protagonist who, along with others, tortures himself a bit. Adam Dalgliesh and Hieronymus Bosch and Superman, for example, suffer when they go home at night. Reacher doesn't have a home and he doesn't suffer. But he's got Lee Child and a 14th adventure coming this time next year. That gives us a year to do something about the PTSD.. Maybe that's why he keeps moving. He can't risk getting found out.

B000A2RRF4|5.0|I just finished watching this video. Out of all the concerts I have seen, this is the best ever. I am a musician/singer with an understanding of what it takes to put on an international show. This exceeded my expectations and was well worth my money. I bought it because I had never witnessed a full MJ concert. You owe this to your self. I read someone elses review here when purchasing this. Of whom said, that they showed more of the audience than the band. I have to disagree with that. This video was shot with marvelous balance of both. It really gave me the full experience of being there and seeing the show. Michael is in good voice. His dance moves for THE ENTIRE SHOW are nothing less than amazing. His band was tight. So many messages in this concert. The Energy never fell. He slowed down and demonstrated that he was still a crooner. I was tired at the end of this show! Every dollar this man had, HE EARNED!! This video demonstrates that fact. He never cheated his fans. Take your rest now Michael. YOU EARNED IT.
B00005JL0I|4.0|Casino Royale is a splendid, hilarious spoof of James Bond films--despite the fact that the film could be seen as being divided into long sequences or segments that are somewhat loosely tied together. The plot is easy enough to follow despite the fact that you will be introduced to a myriad castoff characters; and I really liked those funny scenes that poke fun at the romance scenes in the real James Bond flicks! The cinematography and the choreography are brilliant and the acting is convincing, too. The casting is also good and there are so many jokes and good performances here you'll never get bored in the slightest!<br /><br />When the action starts, we quickly meet the \\"original\\" James Bond (David Niven) who is coaxed out of retirement by a small group of international emissaries sent to his reclusive home. There's a real problem all right--spies from all over the world are being killed off; and the world can only count on James Bond to solve the problem. Bond is quirky all right; and David Niven plays Bond to the hilt. We see Bond begin to counter evil forces when he delivers a toupee (yes, a toupee) to the widow of one of the emissaries who is in actuality \\"agent Mimi\\" (Deborah Kerr); and among the countless funny scenes is agent Mimi who winds up swinging from a drain pipe in a poorly planned attempt to get out of a locked room. Moreover, we also see James Bond take charge in London where he decides to name all the agents in the group James Bond so as to confuse the enemy organization SMERSH and also do away with \\"Le Chiffre\\" (Orson Welles), a man who raises money for his own gambling and SMERSH who aces his game at baccarat by wearing special glasses that let him see every card on the table!<br /><br />James Bond (Niven) also must reunite with his daughter by Mata Hari, Mata Bond (Joanna Pettet)--and Joanna gives an excellent performance as Mata Bond who helps her father fight SMERSH and \\"Le Chiffre.\\" There's another great performance by Ursula Andress as double-agent Vesper Lynd - 007; and Peter Sellers gives an outstanding performance as yet another \\"James Bond\\" spy whose name is actually Evelyn Tremble! Sellers as Tremble ahs some wonderful scenes playing baccarat with Orson Welles although reportedly they disliked each other so intensely that the camera crew had to film each one of them at a time and then cut and paste film together to make it look that they were at the table at the same time!<br /><br />Of course, from here the plot can go anywhere; and the cast of character actors only serves to make the movie even livelier. Who exactly is \\"Le Chiffre?\\" Who is in charge of SMERSH--and what do they really want from James Bond and the forces of good? What happens when Vesper Lynd is kidnapped and Evelyn decides to rescue her? No plot spoilers here, folks--watch and find out!<br /><br />The DVD has a few good bonus features. We get a copy of a television show from 1954 about Casino Royale from Climax! Mystery Theater; the theatrical trailer and a feature entitled \\"Psychedelic Cinema.\\" The 40th Anniversary Edition should have additional features including a \\"making-of\\" documentary.<br /><br />Casino Royale may not have been the best picture ever produced; but it's funny as all heck! This is great fare for people who want a lot of laughs and the sight gags are terrific, too. In addition, people who like the real James Bond films may also want to add this to their collections.er Lynd - 007; and Peter Sellers gives an outstanding performance as yet another \\"James Bond\\" spy whose name is actually Evelyn Tremble!

0060557818|5.0|A well-conceived imaginative tale from the inkwell of master storyteller Neil Gaiman: Neverwhere takes us on a fun-filled adventure with everyman Richard Mayhew, as we join him on his odyssey from the mundane and banal world of \\"London Above\\", into the alternative-dimensional world of \\"London Below\\": a magical, dark, gothic, subterranean world inhabited by a hodgepodge of fantasy characters who consider themselves outcasts from the world above.  His journey ultimately leads him on a perilous quest which becomes a metaphor for Richard's own self-discovery.<br /><br />Highly recommened for fans of fantasy, sword and sorcery, dark fantasy, horror, and adventure.
B001U0HBPG|4.0|Director David Fincher always has kept his worldview dark and depressing, and \\"The Curious Case of Benjamin Button\\" is no exception. He again directs Brad Pitt (previously in Fincher's [[ASIN:B000050FEN Seven]]), this time as a man inexplicably born with all the physical characteristics of an 80 year old who then ages in reverse. All this while his mental faculties work in standard time, so he gains an old man's lifetime of memories. While Fincher usually pulls at the strings that manipulate us into staring at the darkness of man (think [[ASIN:B000QUCNP4 Zodiac]]), this time he goes right for melodramatic heartstrings.<br /><br />It's not always a perfect fit. While Fincher has, as usual, made a gorgeously rich looking movie, there are times when you wonder why Benjamin was just free to wander aimlessly through life, not having scientists and doctors swarming around him. And while the story of the clock at the beginning of the movie is a poignant allegory and therefore seemed useful to the film, the element of Hurricane Katrina as a timing device seemed crowbarred in. Will that stop you from needing at least one box of Kleenex to make it through this movie? Not at all.<br /><br />\\"The Curious Case of Benjamin Button\\" is a moving story of how aging takes us through life, both in love and in tragedy. \\"We all end up in diapers,\\" says Daisy (Cate Blanchett, amazing as always) who tries to make sense of her love with a man that can only drift away. The cast is uniformly strong throughout, with Taraji P. Henson as Queenie getting the best 'wisdom' lines, a scene stealing Tilda Swinton as Benjamin's first love affair and Jared Harris as Capt Mike, the swashbuckling tugboat man with the heart of an artist. The overall tragedy is speckled with bits of humor and lots of deep love.<br /><br />In the end, though, the movie belongs to Brad Pitt. Through make-up, CGI and other devices, he portrays Benjamin as man out of time, trying to comprehend the way life has changed the world as he moves in reverse of everyone around him. Even though he is absent from the last 30 minutes, his presence is felt in the way Daisy takes him back to where everything began. Sad and beautiful all at the same time, \\"The Curious Case of Benjamin Button\\" is a grand movie that falls short of greatness; nonetheless it is worth your time.e of everyone around him.

B0000541AM|1.0|I should have given it a 1.5 stars instead of 1, but Amazon doesn't allow half stars.  Anyhow, I just bought this DVD (in the original theatrical release version) based on some fairly positive reviews.  I must say I got burned.  Major issues: bad screen play and the movie is padded (you could cut the running time in half without losing anything).<br /><br />I am guessing that the guy who wrote the screen play learned about NYC gangs by watching West Side Story.  He then added in some dialogue borrowed from some hippie films.  Right there, you know this is going to be cheesy.  Sadly, it was not cheesy good, it was cheesy bad.<br /><br />The reason it was cheesy bad is because 1/2 of the film is footage of a bunch of Fame extras walking around NYC.  So while I appreciate the \\"so bad it's good\\" thing, any humor provided by the goofy dialogue was lost in the ensuing walking scenes.<br /><br />In the plus column: zombie baseball players, black hockey stick wielding ninjas, & sinister use of 3 empty pop bottles.
B000002U8G|2.0|Pink Floyd is such an iconic band - and has such a loyal fan base - that it's hard to assess the group's work free from outside pressures and influences. For starters, rabid Floyd fanatics consider every note of every album (at least until bassist Roger Waters left the band!)to be pure genius, so any criticism is GUARANTEED to generate a hailstorm of negative response. It's no wonder that most of the Amazon reviews give Meddle five stars!    So at the risk of alienating millions of PF disciples, I'll say it: this is not a very good album. Several of their records are among the best rock music ever recorded, but Meddle one ain't one of them. The opening track (\\"One of These Days\\") is first-rate Floyd, but the rest of side 1 is fairly forgettable filler. If you don't believe me, ask yourself why the band almost NEVER plays this material in concert or includes the songs on compilation CDs or videos.    Then there is Echoes, the album's magnum opus. It's one of those things that's better in theory (or in hazy memories of hazy college dorm rooms) than in reality. Yes, it was groundbreaking for 1971, but it's also hard to listen to from start to finish. Want proof: on PF's compilation album (called \\"Echoes\\") the song was cut down to less than eight minutes!!! And even at that, it's still too long.    Buy The Wall. Buy Dark Side. Buy Radio KAOS (Waters' solo album). But don't waste your time with Meddle.
B00127RAJY|1.0|I must say, I did not like this DVD.  I'd never seen Jillian Michaels before, but her style really annoyed me.  What bothered me the most, however, was how unhealthy this workout actually was!  She gets your heart rate pumping, then has you lie down for ab work.  The \\"cool-down\\" was just going straight from the ab section to stretching, which jarred me and actually made me sick.  If I ever did this DVD again, I would have to add a 5-minute cool-down so I could get my heart rate lowered before I started stretching.  She keeps saying she doesn't want people to get injured, but between high-impact cardio, jarring shifts in position and the abrupt ending, this DVD seems like a great way to hurt yourself.

B0014Z4OQG|1.0|this has to be one of the worst movies I have ever watched. this will be my first one star review. the whole movie is shot with one hand held camera. it is hard to tell what is going on half of the time, when they run you pretty much just see there feet , alot of the shots you have to tilt your head to watch , 80% of the movie is just interviews , it has no ending it just stops filming , do not waste your time . I noticed that this movie only cost a dollar on Amazon , do not waste your dollar ! I checked this out from the library and I feel as if they need to give me something for watching this horrible movie. I didn't like the way the Blair Witch was filmed but this is much worse . the whole movie is you looking through the camera from what the annoying camera man sees . over 200 people gave this one star , the numbers don't lie !!!!
B000OVLBHG|1.0|I normally don't bother with these reviews, but Jeff Shannon's primary review is so incredibly lost--and combined with Mike Gambit's line, \\"I'm amazed that so many people can blindly miss the subtleties of this movie.\\"  Well, that's just too much.  Talk about clueless.<br /><br />There is a novel, \\"Starship Troopers,\\" written by Robert Heinlein in the 50's.  It caused a firestorm because it envisioned a society where citizenship was conditioned on responsibility.  Whether that provision would have made a better society can be debated, but that the concept evoked horror among the moneyed parasites and inveterate leeches was undeniable.<br /><br />In the novel, Heinlein's society was tested in a war with an alien civilization.  Johnny Rico was a rich kid who almost accidentally learns he lives in a society and that it takes effort and sometimes sacrifice to keep that society alive.  It was a great story and remains, after forty years of devouring novels of all genres, one of my favorites.<br /><br />The movie completely distorts the novel's theme, turning it around 180 degrees, losing plot, detail and characters until it's not even a reflection in a crazy-house mirror, becoming an utterly cheesy production.  In the process, a great story remains untold, replaced by a mindless, insipid caricature of immensely entertaining and thought-provoking piece.  Any shallow Hollywood drone could come up the \\"themes\\" buried in this movie, which is obviously what occurred.  The producer, director and writer behind this travesty took a gem and turned it into pond scum--not even good, healthy pond scum, but the gray, slimy stuff that stinks and won't leave your memory.<br /><br />Miss the point?  Unbelievable.  The only points in this production were on the tips of a number of heads.
B0009XNUK0|5.0|After Michael Jackson's untimely death, I realized I had taken his music for granted. It had been so much a part of the landscape of my life, from the early Jackson 5 records and TV appearances enjoyed by my sister and me, little girls who were around Michael's age, through the radio-play ubiquity of \\"Thriller.\\" I hadn't collected his recordings, I guess because I thought MJ would always be around. His passing made me reconsider the sheer joy and artistic perfection of his music and dancing and the positive spiritual messages that informed his songs. This collection by necessity is incomplete, but it's a good overview of Jackson's music from his incredibly precocious early days to his slick, spirited and unjustly underrated later records. You can't feel anything but happiness when listening to these discs.
0452289963|3.0|I've dillydallied with many a self-help books and I like this but I'm skeptical of anything that Oprah endorses because it becomes so mainstream and fadish. Tolle's book is interesting and he explain a lot of things about life that most people already know such as treat others how you want to be treated, live in the moment, accept what life brings, and don't limit yourself to labels. I like that he includes advice for parents such as pay attention to your children, allow them to be, and try to overlook the ego and painbody in them and that we as parents can't protect them from all suffering.   I don't know that human consciousness is going through some grand transformation, I hope so but I don't know that and neither does he. He doesn't include much practical advice, practical as in how to practice living enlightened. He's created a business much like other people and I don't know what he is doing with the money generated from his book sales, dvds, cds on meditation, downloads, seminars, etc., but it'd be interesting to know.  The book has a simple message live in the now, the only moment there is. It makes sense and is easier said than done. So for now I'm staying on my antidepressant because I still have to be a parent and function enough for that.
1401216676|4.0|This isn't the best graphic novel that I have ever read when I really think about it, but it is still really interesting and good. One of the flaws of the story is that it is too short. Another complaint I had with the story is that it doesn't confirm that this is the Joker true backstory since Joker mentions that he likes to have a multiple choice for a past. Meaning everything in this story with the Joker's past very likely didn't happen. Then why even bother telling the story if it isn't the truth? I guess they didn't want backlash from the fans saying \\"That's not how it happened!\\" I'd recommend reading it. It is a fun little story and fans of the Joker will really enjoy it.
B000063JZQ|3.0|The most commendable aspect of this adaptation is the filming. It should be seen for the opening act alone.  The witches' spell on the shore, Macbeth's castle on the hill, the bleak shots of the landscape - all truly remarkable!!    The acting is another story.  Its not bad - but its not particularly effective either.  The actors do not attempt to engage their audience.  In fact, they ignore their audience altogether.      All of Macbeth's solo speaking parts are portrayed as thoughts.  Therefore, Finch doesn't have to actually act (or even memorize) much of his role.  He simply has to \\"look\\" thoughtful while a prerecorded track narrates the lines for him.  Not only does this approach come across as cheap, but it also removes that vital bridge that needs to be built between the hero and his audience!  These are times where the character is, more or less, speaking to the audience, to draw them in.  That bond never happens here.  I don't believe Polanski really grasps how Shakespeare is supposed to work.    Otherwise, the costuming is fine - most of it is 14th to 15th century period, rather than 11th, but Shakespeare, himself, was as guilty with anachronisms.
B00284BMBM|5.0|I am not much of a Rock fan, However I must say I like this CD way better then his first one. This CD in my opinion is eclectic. I think It has Rock, County with a little soul.

B00005QGAV|5.0|When people talked about MJ's music, it's almost always Billie Jean and Beat it, but I found MJ has so much more to offer. The first couple of times I listened to this album, I was moved to tears by Heal the World and Will You Be There. But as I listened to it many more times, the songs that really have sinked into my mind are Who Is It and Give In to Me. MJ's earlier love songs, Liberian Girl and I Just Can't Stop Loving You are pure, beautiful and imaginative fantasies by a artist in his early twienties. But nearly a decade later, MJ wrote/sang the love songs with such pain, loneliness and haunting desperation. I do not know what was left of him, I do not how will he sing in his next album. I felt a lot of things must have happened that something precious was being destroyed inside him. The man has taken a journey, but people are not accepting it, they want the old Michale Jackson, which is just not possible.

But this CD, I am so pleased with it.  This is one of those CD's that you can put in and totally listen to all of it without skipping any songs.  You can just relax and chill.  Pretty Wings, oh Pretty Wings, I've been there before.  Fistful of Tears is my #1 song.  I can relate to this whole CD.  This CD is so DEEP!  I think everyone will love it.  Everyone will relate to this one.  I'm anxiously waiting on his next and I know it will be spectacular.  If you're not a fan, you will be after this CD.  Believe me, it was worth the wait.  Oh, I could go on and on.  THIS IS IT.  We need more music like this.  I can't stop screaming.
B0018QCXH8|5.0|I am mystified by the negative reviews many people gave this movie. How can so many miss the moral (not to mention cinematic) power of this film?! Daniel Day Lewis is simple incredible in leading us through his character's \\"road to perdition\\".  Unbelievable cinematography, screenplay, directing, editing, musical score, and acting.  Surely to end up high on the AFI top list of movies when they next re-assess their list.
0321544080|5.0|This is NOT a paint by numbers book.  I'd be very disappointed if it were.  This is a book that discusses lighting, and the years of experience behind coming to an understanding of the magic of light.<br /><br />In this book are the recipes for cooking up some good lighting to enhance your photography.  Understanding light and lighting doesn't come to you overnight, and this isn't a book to get on the same day you buy your first DSLR.<br /><br />If you've begun to understand the camera basics to control light, and make images, and not just grab shots, this is a great book to further you along your path.<br /><br />Consider it a road map to lead you in the direction of mastering light, and working with lighting equipment.  That's what it is.  It's still up to the photographer to use what he/she learns and apply it to their work.<br /><br />What clicked for me with this book was the approach to lighting and the thought process going into the various challenges and situations.<br /><br />I also very much appreciated Joe's sharing of his personal experiences.  All of us face challenges, and not just with lighting, and Joe provides some inspiration to confront and overcome these challenges.<br /><br />A book that approaches a subject such as light that really makes you think about and start to understand the subject matter is the best you could ask for.

B00005KAQP|5.0|What a classic. I don't really like Goldberg but she was great in this movie. I loved her quirky personality and her no nonsense attitude. Something I noticed in the movie was that when Delores went to the police station in the beginning she tells the detectives that she overheard Vince say to Joey, \\"say goodnight joey\\" . But Delores barged in AFTER Vince said it and right when he shot Joey. So I was wondering how she could know that? Other than that, I absolutely loved this movie. The singing nuns were fun and I love how Vince's cronies change in the end and can't shoot her and how Delores and Reverend Mother seemed to have mended their differences. Vince was a snake, though. I hated that he used Delores AND he gave her his wife's fur coat! I don't care that it WAS purple mink. How tacky is that?<br />Definitely a keeper!
B0007G89G4|4.0|The movie \\"Stand By Me\\" was a film based off the novel by Stephen King known as \\"The Body.\\" But for all who have seen it, you may notice it doesn't seem like the Stephen King type, I mean compare it to \\"The Shining\\" or \\"It,\\" this is a family flick with an R rating. I mean don't get me wrong, it's got a lot of adult content throughout the film like Chris (River Phoenix) swiping a loaded gun from his wasted dad, Ace (Kiefer Sutherland) almost stabbing Chris in the throat, Gordie (Wil Wheaton) threating to shoot Ace with the gun, the kids smoking, most of the characters constantly muttering bad swears, you know the rest. The part that most of the viewers out there including I, made us pee our pants was the train scene which Teddy (Corey Feldman) declares \\"the all-time train dodge.\\" Aw, Speaking of Teddy I love that little guy! He's not afraid of nothin', he wasn't afraid to cross an old 100 foot bridge, he wasn't afraid to dodge an on-coming train, and he almost joined the army, what an awesome dude. And Vern (Jerry O' Connell) a little chubby kid who is afraid of everything, unlike Teddy. If you must know the plot it's about 4 12 year olds who set out to find a dead body and bring it back and become heroes. The emotional scenes make you realize that they have horrible lives in a small town, and by the end, you feel glad that they get out of their town. And if I could add a new scene it would be the boys encounter a vicious animal like a wolverine or a coyote and the grab the gun and blow it away. Oh well the rest of the movie was very entertaining! The set up to when the boys find the missing corpse keeps you anticipating it. Complete with a terrific music score which you may recognize from George Lucas's classic \\"American Graffiti.\\" So overall, it's a great movie, so definitely see it, if you have it. If you don't then rent it, buy it, it's worth it! RIP River Phinoex :)
0393316041|5.0|I don't think I have ever in my life used the word \\"delightful\\" to describe anything -- until now.    This book is delightful. Feynman is a unique human being, and lived life in a way that we should all try to emulate. I wish I could have met the man, and even better taken a physics class from him.    Buy this book, read it, and learn what you can from it.
B001GGPBUG|5.0|This book profiles the life of an extremely courageous woman who risks her life to express her beliefs and tell her life story.  She is a champion of not only women's rights, but human rights, decency, and compassion.  Infidel is very easy to read and you will find yourself captivated by the experiences that Ayaan has had.  Much of her book is incredibly personal; you almost feel that you are a close friend of Ayaan's discussing her life over coffee.  Regardless of whether you believe in Allah, Jesus Christ, or no God at all, you will be challenged by her rational and straightforward conclusions that she reaches as the result of her life experiences in Saudi Arabia and Africa.      Ayaan's close friend, Theo van Gogh, was murdered.  Pinned to Theo's chest was a personal note to Ayaan.  Their crimes:  expressing their criticism of Islam publicly.  Ayaan clearly states that Islam is not a \\"religion of peace.\\"  After all, if you are unwilling to publicly confess that Islam is a \\"religion of peace\\" and publicly state that Allah is not God, you are subject to execution under Sharia law.  Ayaan is shining a bright light on extreme intolerance...which is why she is still a target for Muslims and which is why she is one of the most brave and influential women on the face of the earth.
0061684384|2.0|She's 27!!!!!! How can she write a book about \\"HER LIFE\\"??? She HASN'T lived! Yea,  I read it. In fact, people who I apprenticed with know her. She is a very competent artist! But her TV show, and all the glitterati surrounding her character really do detract from her abilities as an artist. Her show is SO detached from tattooing that it's quite insulting to artists working in this field. Please, if you want to read an autobiography of someone who has \\"LIVED\\" a life, read \\"the Longest Winter\\" or the \\"Forgotten Soldier\\". THEN you'll know what hardship is!!!

Once word gets around about WHEN YOU REACH ME (trust me, it will), kids will be doing precisely that with this thoughtful and thought-provoking book. The characters are real and believable, even when something clearly out of the ordinary is going on and Miranda needs to solve the mystery. The clues are all there. The puzzle makes sense. Time to read the book again.
159448385X|4.0|I thought this was a very good book. I read it in a book club, and we certainly had a lot to discuss. We chose this book because we had all read the Kite Runner and enjoyed it. This book is similar to the Kite Runner in that it provides a glimpse of life in the Middle East. However, this book is seen through the eyes of mostly women, which I found interesting. I would certainly recommend this book to anyone that enjoyed the Kite Runner, and pretty much everyone. However, it is not a light read. It can be pretty depressing at times.
B0009XNUK0|5.0|This is a great compilation of MJ's hits and some of his best music released including recordings dating back to his first number 1 with his brothers.  If you just want a great CD set with lots of variety, look no further.  There isn't a single song you won't enjoy and if you're near his age when he passed, it will bring back fond memories of your youth.  If you haven't discovered what a great talent he was before his untimely demise, this set should get you well acquainted with the King of Pop.

B000J5XS3C|4.0|I bought this to setup my own little home recording studio. It was the best value for money I could find and the reviews seemed mostly good. It works as desired and meets my needs well. I later found out after I bought it that Behringer is a very well respected brand in the industry. My only grouse with this product is that there's no on/off switch on the unit. This is turning out to be a little annoying. I have it plugged in with other equipment into a powerstrip, and there are times when I don't need the mixer turned on, and so I have to go scramble around under my desk to unplug it (and plug it back in later), or unplug it at the unit which you have to be careful while doing a lot since the power pin is one of those cylindrical-with-three-pins-arranged-in-an-isoceles-triangle-type plugs. But this minor gripe aside, it works great and is excellent value for money.
B001E5FYS8|1.0|This documentary about the tightrope walker who walked between the World Trade Center towers was ruined for me because of the inability of the French to describe anything without being over-the-top and histrionically flamboyant. It's not enough that Phillippe the tightrope walker and his girlfriend are in love. Every time they embrace it has to be like they \\"will never see each other again.\\"  He doesn't just look at her; his eyes are filled with madness. She doesn't simply start dating him; she comes to the  philosophical realization that she has no unique destiny of her own --her \\"destiny is tied up with his.\\" He doesn't just like the idea of walking between the towers; he has to believe that they were put there for him. It's OK if he dies falling because it is beautiful to die doing something you are passionate about. When he walks on top of Notre Dame cathedral, his girlfriend is \\"dumbstruck\\" to discover that priests are being ordained inside the cathedral (why was she dumbstruck? Notre Dame is a Catholic cathedral, after all, not some fried chicken joint). Everything he and his girlfriend do and say is wildly theatrical and exaggerated. They are passionate --correction, wildly passionate-- about life and its possibilities (if I thought that life's greatest possibility was to perform a circus act, as these two apparently do, I would put a pistol to my head). I mustn't have felt as passionately about walking on a tightrope as these two hyperventilating French lovers do because  this film bored and annoyed me. I found myself wishing that Phillippe would stumble and fall to his death - as passionately as I know that he was capable of doing, of course. I'm not one of those Americans who hate the French--yet. But if I am ever exposed to another ninety minutes of French emotional mania, I may decide that the only proper response to anything even remotely French is the kind of loathing that throws the doors of hell open.
B000B5XOSO|1.0|I love batman. My favorite comic book character by far. I also really liked the first movie. And have seen the other 5. Given that the newest three (Nolan's trilogy) are the best, and forever/batman&robin are considered to be the worst. I must say that I have to put this movie in the bottom of them all. I just purchased and watched the bluray anthology just to double check... yep this movie sucks. Heres why:<br /><br />-It's not about Batman. Micheal Keaton who is the best Bruce Wayne ever is barely even in the movie (Bale is a better Batman). The entire film focuses on the 3 (!) villains! Remember the last superhero movie with three villains? Spider-man 3, and we all know how that turned out.<br /><br />-Batman kills people... If you're a fan of the comics you know how important it is that Batman does *not* kill, ever. It is one of the largest character traits in comics. Seriously this is such a big thing... it's like making a Superman film and having Clark Kent be born on Earth and gain his powers through some radioactive heat wave. Batman's inability to kill anyone is an inherent part of this personality, as much as Superman being an alien. It is their greatest strength as well as weakness. It defines him, it makes Batman a Knight, not just a vigilante out for revenge.<br /><br />-Bastardization of the comic books continues. Catwoman's and Penguin's characters are completely absurd and their origins are made up from nothing. Terrible stories and visions. Sorry Tim, you went crazy. The best 'villian' isn't even from the comics! (Best largely because he is played by Walken). It's almost as if there were no Batman fans in the production staff.<br /><br />-Stupid plot all around. Really now, this is the dumbest plot of any batman movie devised. Why? Rocket wielding penguins... that's why.<br /><br />-The score. The music is excellent HOWEVER, it is completely inappropriate for this movie. I was ready to turn this crap off as soon as I heard the cheerful and circus-ysoundtrack to Batman beating up some goons or Catwoman doing backflips. This was done again in Batman & Robin....<br /><br />To summarize, this is the worst Batman film because it's not a Batman story, it just uses all the Batman characters to wrap around an existing plot, this would've been fine if the plot had been tweaked to cater to Batman's universe. It wasn't.<br /><br />Overall the only good thing about this movie are the performances of the actors playing the terrible characters. The actors are all top notch and I commend them for the excellent job they all did. Devito is excellent. Pfeffier is amazing. Keaton is inspiring and Walken is as always, a show stopper. I feel bad for all these people having to be associated with such terrible direction.
B0011ZNAIC|1.0|Made it through 30 minutes of this movie and turned it off. The premise of a \\"factory\\" that produced honey was so far out that I could not accept any part of it. Jerry Seinfeld's voice was right out of his sitcom. Bland!  A big waste of animation talent.

B0027WNRJ0|4.0|Adrenalize caught a lot of flak from fans and critics when it first came out in 1992, and as my title indicates, even the liner notes of the deluxe edition admit that it's the \\"runt\\" of the trilogy (Pyromania, Hysteria, and Adrenalize). And I certainly know that many people would've liked to have seen a deluxe edition of High 'N' Dry instead of Adrenalize. But I happened to think Adrenalize was a decent follow-up to Hysteria and that despite some shortcomings, the deluxe edition is still a nice addition to my Def Leppard collection.<br /><br />The deluxe edition contains all 10 tracks from the original album remastered on the first disc. Although admittedly no Pyromania or Hysteria, Adrenalize contains some great tracks: \\"Make Love Like a Man\\", \\"Stand Up (Kick Love into Motion)\\", \\"Tonight\\"...just to name a few. It would be an understatement to say the album isn't too deep, but then again Def Leppard was never exactly known for thought-provoking music. I personally enjoy the carefree, light, tongue-in-cheek attitude that defines most of the tracks (it's the funniest Def Lep album to date, but in the best way possible). Just like with the deluxe edition of Pyromania, I've heard people complain that the remastering is not really noticeable, but again I have to disagree. The sound quality is definitely improved and it does help give the songs a boost. And just like Pyromania, it really is nice to hear remastered versions of some of the lesser-known songs that haven't made their way onto a compilation album (\\"Tonight\\" and \\"Personal Property\\" are great examples).<br /><br />The second disc contains the Adrenalize B-sides as well as some live recordings. The B-sides are nice to have on one disc, though to be totally honest most of them are nothing special. The exception is the \\"Tonight\\" demo, which I think may even be better than the version that actually made it onto the album. The only real problem I have, though, is with the live recordings. Of the four live recordings(all from a Bonn concert in '92), only ONE track is of a song off Adrenalize (\\"Let's Get Rocked\\"). While the others: \\"Hysteria\\", \\"Photograph\\", and \\"Pour Some Sugar On Me\\", are great recordings, it just doesn't make sense to me why they didn't include more songs from Adrenalize in the deluxe edition of Adrenalize. How about a little \\"Make Love Like a Man\\" or \\"Stand Up (Kick Love into Motion)\\" instead? I would've loved to have live versions of those songs (which, excepting poor-quality bootlegs and extremely rare DVDs, don't exist).<br /><br />Unlike the Pyromania re-release, this one isn't necessarily a mandatory purchase. In conclusion, it's pretty decent and there's just enough worthwhile bonus material to keep it from being superfluous. I say if you don't already own Adrenalize and are looking to get it, buy this instead of the original 1992 version. The extra money you'll have to pay is still worth it.
0451207521|5.0|Jackdaws is set in occupied France in the ten days preceding the D Day invasion of June 6, 1944.  The basic story line is almost exactly the same as The Dirty Dozen, but this time it's a half dozen, and they're an all woman team.  Like The Dirty Dozen we have a band of rejects, some criminals, and all with her own reason for wanting to strike a death blow in the Nazi beast's backside as the allies are massing to hit the beaches of Normandy.  The target is a strategically important telephone exchange in an old chateau, the destruction of which would make the Nazi occupiers more vulnerable to the allied invasion.<br /><br />The name of the book comes from a poem by Richard Harris Barham (1788 - 1845) titled \\"The Jackdaw of Rheims.\\"  (Rheims seems to be the Anglicized spelling of Reims).  A Jackdaw is a crow-like bird known for stealing bright objects.  The poem deals with a bird that stole a ring from a Cardinal, who, in order to flush the thief out, places a curse on him.  When the jackdaw shows up showing the ill effects of the curse, his crime is exposed.<br /><br />Author Ken Follett selects Reims, France for this novel's action and uses the name \\"Jackdaw,\\" as the British Special Operations Executive dubbed them, for the female dirty half dozen parachuted behind enemy lines to coordinate with the French Resistance to blow up the telephone exchange.  The leader of the Jackdaws is a special operations veteran, Felicity, or \\"Flick,\\" Clairet, married to the leader of the Reims Resistance, Michel.<br /><br />Opposing our superheroine is Major Deiter Franck, an active duty German policeman whose specialty is torture-based interrogations.  We know that any member of the Jackdaw team that is captured will suffer the cruelty beyond the reader's imagination.  We are not disappointed.<br /><br />The Jackdaws face operational obstacles from the start, and the combination of their amateurism and Major Franck's professionalism results in one disaster after another.  As the weather clears over the English Channel, and the full moon illuminates the Reims countryside, the plan goes forward despite the long odds against it.  As explosives rip through the old chateau, Franck captures or kills most of the Jackdaws and closes in on the surviving three as they await their airlift out of France.  The tension builds to a climactic shootout on the runway.<br /><br />Follett is a master storyteller and he deserves top marks for Jackdaws despite some minor faults.  1)  It would be unrealistic in the extreme for British Intelligence to suspect that the Nazis were using Helicopter's radio.  2) There was no way Paul could have known that Chatelle was in total darkness.  3)  Franck wouldn't have been alerted because two middle class French women were eating at the Ritz.  4)  How could Franck have known that Flick had killed Stepanie?  5)  Flick assumes everyone talks when captured and assumes Franck has their information, but she fails to assume that Franck has Michel's information though his capture is nearly certain.<br /><br />Ken Follett's Jackdaws is everything a thriller should be: great characters, non-stop action, and steadily increasing stakes.  Adding the historically accurate backdrop of D Day along with the compressed time frame is the work of a pro.ish Channel, and the full moon illuminates the Reims countryside, the plan goes forward despite the long odds against it.

B0027WNRIG|5.0|When I heard earlier this year that Def Leppard was releasing deluxe editions of Pyromania and Adrenalize, I was ecstatic, to say the least. The only downside was that I had to wait 3 months to get my hands on them, but for Pyromania, the wait was definitely worth it.    The deluxe edition is a must-have for any Lep fan. It contains all 10 tracks from the original album remastered on disc 1, as well as a complete live concert recorded at the LA forum in 1983 on disc 2. I've heard some complain that the remastering on the first disc isn't that noticeable, but I can't agree with that. Comparing the tracks on the deluxe edition with tracks from the original 1983 release, you'd have to be deaf to not hear the improvement. The sound is clearer, crisper, and brings new energy into the songs that you can't get with the originals. This is especially great if you happen to like songs off the album that weren't necessarily big hits and haven't yet been re-released and remastered on a compilation album (\\"Comin' Under Fire\\" happens to be my second favorite song on Pyromania, and I was always disappointed at not having a remastered version of the song, but now I do!).    While the remastering is a great treat, the second disc is really what makes the deluxe edition a must-have. Its 15 tracks cover an entire Def Leppard concert at the LA Forum in 1983 (and I do mean the entire concert...they even left in Phil and Steve's guitar solos). While bootlegs of the concert have been around for ages, the mastered recordings on the deluxe edition sound SO much better. Joe's voice sounds great (he was only 24 and at his prime) and the instrumental backup he has from Phil, Steve, Sav, and Rick is just absolute perfection. For many, this is also the only time you'll ever get to hear professional, mastered live recordings of some of Def Leppard's earlier songs off High 'N' Dry, since there are no other recordings of these save for some extremely rare limited release DVDs.    To sum it up, Pyromania the Deluxe Edition is worth every penny it costs. In my opinion, it should've been released a lot earlier (I'm surprised it didn't come out with the deluxe edition of Hysteria) but better late than never! Any true Def Leppard fan should pick one up as soon as possible and even casual listeners should seriously consider owning a copy.
0061231401|5.0|I always look forward to another Sigma Force story and this one managed to live up to the others.  As always, Rollins does a great job taking true facts and weaving them into a great fictional story.  While you don't need to have read the other books before this one to enjoy it, knowing the backstory for the characters really adds to it.<br /><br />This story has provided the most information on \\"The Guild\\" by far but still doesn't tell us much which leaves you waiting for the next one.  I highly recommend this book to anyone that enjoys fictional suspense tied in with science.

B001993Y2C|1.0|Yes, this is bitterness to some extent, but this release is -NOT- complete. It does not include the second TV movie, The Plan (which will be released in November), and it does not include the special web-episode Face of the Enemy which has crucial details included regarding the final seasons storyline.    My rating is not for the show, but for the false advertising and obvious eventual double-dipping once Face of the Enemy and the Plan will be released as part of the 'Complete' set in the future.    Battlestar Galactica is, in all honesty, one of the best shows I have ever seen. But this set is not Complete.

0060557818|5.0|It's 5 in the morning and I've just finished reading Neverwhere. This has got to be one of the most enjoyable reads I have chanced to stumble upon in the past year. It had me hooked from the moment I flipped the first page. I was sucked into the the dark world of \\"London Below\\" and by the end of the book, found myself wishing for more. Neverwhere is a brilliant fantasy novel speckled with shades of humor. My only beef with it was that I found myself begging for a sequeal (well it's not much of a beef to be honest). By the end of the book. there is no paucity of unanswered questions and I really really hope Neil Gaiman releases a sequel soon.
B000FG0DKG|5.0|Everyone knows who Pink Floyd are, everyone knows of Dark Side of the Moon. For the few who don't please read the audio CD reviews for the album, as I'm trying to fill the void for this specific version.<br /><br />Mobile Fidelity Sound Labs or MoFi are a company who release audiophile master recordings. Their efforts are often seen with high appeal due to the astonishing sound quality they provide. They also are known to make great collectibles even when their albums aren't met with the quality audiophile hopefuls expect.<br /><br />You'll be able to depict a MoFi recording by a highlighted color bar on the top of an album. It should say something along the lines of 'Original Master Recording', people will often abbreviate the companies releases to MFSL. Some take the liberty in looking down on this company, but let it be known they are capable of great quality recordings.<br /><br />This particular recording of DSotM is a pleasure on the ears. Though I have herd from the grapevine that the original Harvest issues of this sound better, I can not agree or disagree as I haven't listened to that one. I do own the Capitol U.S. copy and can easily say this is of a higher caliber.<br /><br />You will see some disagree with production of this with remarks of an odd EQ, opinions aside clarity can't be denied (okay that's an opinion as well). The older MFSL releases were released on 'super vinyl', with a claim of them being resilient over time and use. They also go on to claim they don't wear down like other records, hey if you have a bad needle I can assure you it will take its toll on this. All this info can be found as a insert located in the records sleeve (obviously).<br /><br />This isn't a two record set, it is one LP a half-speed master by none other than Stank Ricker! Ricker does well with this having helped create this time consuming technique while working with I believe JVC, then having a good switch to MoFi showing off his methods. Those unfamiliar with his work can find him doing more contemporary work with artist like Wilco and Linkin Park.<br /><br />Musically the album glides, psychedelic flourishes, spin rinsed jazz, glistening single coil guitars, top notch background singers, it stayed in the charts for a reason is what I'm trying to spit out. With an album this good one should treat this music with care, MoFi have done that. From the first time I herd the alarming bells on \\"Time\\" I knew this was right, I knew reviews sometimes are unfavorable toward a certain sound, but this clicked for me. The realism I herd made me question (although I knew the answer) whether or not I rigged my speakers with said bells all along the innards of my system.<br /><br />Dynamically too this excels, many records of the 70's were gimped on quality due to inferior recycled vinyl. Another interesting thing to note is the track separation for once on \\"Speak/Breathe\\". Now their own entities to shine on your crazy diamond needle/stylus combo.<br /><br />If you are a fan of this album, this genre, this era pick this recording up if cheaply available like its current rate of 20ish bucks.

Can you see that sound for me?ork with artist like Wilco and Linkin Park.    Musically the album glides, psychedelic flourishes, spin rinsed jazz, glistening single coil guitars, top notch background singers, it stayed in the charts for a reason is what I'm trying to spit out. With an album this good one should treat this music with care, MoFi have done that. From the first time I herd the alarming bells on \\"Time\\" I knew this was right, I knew reviews sometimes are unfavorable toward a certain sound, but this clicked for me. The realism I herd made me question (although I knew the answer) whether or not I rigged my speakers with said bells all along the innards of my system.    Dynamically too this excels, many records of the 70's were gimped on quality due to inferior recycled vinyl. Another interesting thing to note is the track separation for once on \\"Speak/Breathe\\". Now their own entities to shine on your crazy diamond needle/stylus combo.    If you are a fan of this album, this genre, this era pick this recording up if cheaply available like its current rate of 20ish bucks.

B00005NB8K|3.0|Everyone has covered their views of Jim Morrison in more detail and length then his actual time in the limelight at this point. The Doors film is one of legendary proportions, often portraying the excessive more so then the intellectual elements that occurred. With so much coverage on Jim, as so with almost every Doors related book and article we'd think the DOORS MOVIE would maybe shed some light off the lizard king?<br /><br />No, this movie is strongly centric on Morrison. As a movie though it holds up, it's interesting and lengthy. As a portrayal it has hits and rapid fire misses. Trippy effects, surreal warmly euphoric moments, bizarre lighting it's all here.<br /><br />Unlike other movies there is no main underlying problem anyone sets out to fix, after all it's meant to be somewhat real right? Stone has fudged the truth to make possibly quick a buck or add the missing elements needed for a hit (like it wouldn't have been already). Jim Morrison was a funny, passionate, at times other worldly guy. While that is shown in brief amounts through speeches, we see his other capable side amplified. The side capable of inciting crowds, dangling off buildings to incite more people, and drinking heavily to incite the people around him. He was also a very deep thinker with a supposed IQ of 149, we find ourselves missing wondering where the other 49 went in this film. He's portrayed a sociopath with a drinking problem more so then the poet we've come to know him as.<br /><br />Aside from my little rant the movie is rather enjoyable. Good music is good music and the Doors had a wonderful catalog of music. A good movie is a good movie, it offers a colorful view on an era so hazily colored. When combined it works nicely, but the falsities are my underlying disapproval of anything greater then average toward this film. As a movie it holds its own, as a tribute to an amazing band it's a bit upsetting.<br />----------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Quick run down:<br />Pros: Great renditions of a classic rock group, provides some uniquely odd scenes, insightful for quite a few Doors related things, impressive acting.<br /><br />Cons: Detaches from reality, endorses a destructive lifestyle without the conscious normal views of these people, some scenes grow boring due to length.at renditions of a classic rock group, provides some uniquely odd scenes, insightful for quite a few Doors related things, impressive acting.

0307269981|5.0|This is a series I would sit down with and read all three of the trilogy in one sitting.  The two books so far are not too similar in plot, but the characterizations are all filled in in the first story.  You definitely get disturbed, moved and  so caught up in the intelligently written plot.  I loved this sequel as much as the first book of the series because you get to know the people from the first book much better, especially Lisbeth.  You should definitely read the girl with the dragon tattoo first because a lot of history on Blomkvist's character and relationships are really spelled out there, and he will seem only to be a cardboard cut out  if you start off at this book.  That may be the only criticism I have of this installment of the series.  I can't wait for the third and unfortunately last book in the series to come out.<br /><br />Lisbeth's back story is totally filled out in this book, and totally makes sense of her unique character.  You feel her gut wrenching hurt, and so much empathy for the person she turns out to be.  I love a good conspiracy theory and this delivers in spades!  The premise is that Lisbeth is a suspect in three parallel murders, and Blomkvist has a gut feel that she is innocent and sets out to prove it.  The first book explored one facet of misogyny and this one explores the sex trade.  I was so disappointed that the book ended!  Can't wait for #3, but in a way I'm happy that I have a years wait -- this is a very intense peek at more of the dark side of the world and reading the books back to back would be too much.

B000000OF6|5.0|Queen's Greatest Hits Volumes i and 2 (a/k/a The Gold Queen Collection) was released in the US in November of 1995.<br />Prior to its release, it was available an import in 1994 via EMI. Then to cash in on the release of Queen's final studio album Made in Heaven, Hollywood Records released this compilation in the US and Canada.<br />Disc 1 is the 1981 Greatest Hits in its original UK tracklisting featuring \\"Another One Bites the Dust\\" which was Queen's biggest US hit which hit #1 in 1980 and a rock disco classic. Plus Queen's first US Top 10 and first UK #1 in 1975 hit out of \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\" which reached #9 in the US in 1976 and this classic needs no explanation. We also have the band's first US #1 from 1980 out of \\"Crazy Little Thing Called Love\\" which is a classic rockabilly romp. \\"Killer Queen\\" follows and was the band's first US Top 20 hit in Spring 1975 in the US and hit #2 in 1974 . Included is the single mix of \\"Fat Bottomed Girls\\" which is a nice different version to the full album track and that was a Top 30 US hit in 1978 as was its A-side \\"Bicycle Race\\".<br />We also have \\"We Will Rock You\\" and \\"We Are the Champions\\" which both hit #4 in early 1978 here in the US (the tracks are separate but the US record company insisted on playing the two together) and both are classic rally cry/victory cry songs and were #2 in the UK. Also included is the single mix of the song \\"Flash\\" which was the theme to the 1980 film Flash Gordon (did well in UK but not so well Stateside). Also on this is the US Top 20 hit from early 1977/UK Top 5 from 1976 out of \\"Somebody to Love\\" which was a great gospel tinged rocker. The 1976 US Top 20/UK Top 10 hit ballad \\"You're My Best Friend\\" which was the follow up single to \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\" on A Night at the Opera is here. Plus you have the UK Top 20/US Top 50 hit \\"Play the Game\\" from 1980, great ballad.<br />The other tracks which were the rock radio hit \\"Now I'm Here\\" (a UK Top 20 in 1975), the classic \\"Good Old Fashioned Lover Boy\\" (a UK Top 30 in 1977 but not released as single Stateside, instead it was \\"Long Away\\" that got released and tanked), the classic \\"Seven Seas of Rhye\\" (a UK hit but stiffed here in the US in 1974)\\", the big UK Top 10 hit \\"Don't Stop Me Now\\" (which was well received on US rock radio but flopped on pop singles chart in 1979, Bee Gees and disco ruled the roost on singles in US) and the ballad \\"Save Me\\" (which was a UK Top 20 in 1980 but an album track here in the States as the song was not issued as a single in the US) round out the first disc.<br />Greatest Hits II which was released in October, 1991 in the UK (and in a somewhat inferior version to some as Classic Queen in the US in March of 1992) and made its Stateside debut on this collection.<br />It has two US Top 40 hits which were \\"Under Pressure\\" (which hit #29 Pop and Top 10 Mainstream Rock in the US in 1981) and \\"Radio Ga Ga\\" (which hit #16 Pop in the US in 1984) plus \\"The Show Must Go On\\" (which hit #2 when released in 1992 as double A-side with \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\"'s re-release). It also has some of the band's huge US rock radio hits out of \\"One Vision\\" (here in its single edit and superior to album version on A Kind of Magic IMHO) (#20 Billboard Rock Tracks in 1985), \\"I Want it All\\" (here in its single edit) (which hit #3 on the Billboard Rock Tracks chart in 1989), \\"Headlong\\" (here slightly edited) (which hit #3 on the Billboard Rock Tracks chart in 1991) and \\"Innuendo\\" (which hit #17 on the Billboard Rock Tracks chart in 1991).<br />Also here are songs that were hits in the UK/Europe but sadly tanked in the US which were the classics \\"A Kind of Magic\\", \\"Breakthru\\", \\"It's a Hard Life\\", \\"I Want to Break Free\\" (featured in its superior single mix) and \\"Hammer to Fall\\" (also here in its single mix). Also included here are songs that were singles in Europe but not here in the US but are great album tracks to us Yanks which were \\"The Miracle\\", \\"The Invisible Man\\", \\"I'm Going Slightly Mad\\", \\"Friends Will Be Friends\\" and \\"Who Wants to Live Forever\\".<br />Although it didn't chart upon release in 1995, The Gold Queen Collection eventually proved a consistent seller and has gone Platinum in last decade with sales of over a million copies in the US.

B000ZEE3I6|3.0|I am a huge fan of the Harry Potter series and I think they have done a great job with the movies so far, however I always think the book version is better than any movie version.  I went to see this with two people who had not read the book so I was interested to see how well were able to understand what was going on without the background.  I also re-read the book a couple of weeks ago to refresh my own memory.    A few observations:    - I was disappointed that they started the movie off with a scene that never happened in the book; Harry in a cafe.  - I had been waiting to see how they handled the meeting and conversation between the Muggle prime minister and the minister of Magic but they skipped that part completely.    - the movie Harry never really mentioned Dumbledore's hand and neither did anyone else for that matter.  In the book it was a matter of gossip among all of the students.    - they skipped the first memory that explained Tom Riddle's witch mother and muggle father, how poor and proud they were and the significance of the both the ring and the locket.    - they skipped later memories that explained how Tom Riddle ended up with the ring and the locket.  - Bill and Fleur were both completely missing  - Dobby and Kreacher were both completely missing   - The battle at Hogwarts when the Death Eaters came in was missing  - they left out the whole funeral scene where everyone came to see Dumbledore off; even the mermaid people showed their respect.  - I have no idea why they stuck in the scene where Harry and Ginny were running through the cornfield and Bella burned the Burrows.  That did not happen in the book; in fact the Burrows was well protected.      To me these are some of the important scenes that were left out.  My friends had a hard time understanding what was going on.  I am glad I re read the book recently or I might have had a bit of trouble following it since they seemed to leave so much out.    On the other hand the special effects weregreat and I have to give credit, coming up with all of the creative things that JK Rowling comes up with for the books has got to be a challenge.    I think the actors all did a pretty good job.  The actor playing Malfoy did a fine job of showing his angst about the job he had to do however the whole story about the two vanishing cabinets being connected was fuzzy.  They did a great job on the scene where Harry finally got the memory from Slughorn but then they followed it pretty closely from the book.  I loved how positive and upbeat Harry was after he had drank the liquid luck.      I gave this three stars because they left so much that was vital out and added a couple of things that were completely unnecessary.  There was much to like however.  I think this movie would have been better if they had made it in two parts as they are planning to do with the last one.  Books 5, 6 & 7 just have so much information that one 2 hour+ movie simply cannot do them justice.
0525421033|4.0|I must have a heart of stone, because this book did not make me cry. I've seen that most everyone has cried. It was very sad, I'll give you that. But it was a bittersweet kind of sad, I think. Which only made the book all the more better.<br /><br />Gayle's writing is brilliant. The scenes alternate between the present when Mia is in the hospital and past events that have affected Mia in some way, which increases the emotional intensity in the book. Seeing Normal Mia in the past while she does normal things makes realizing just how dire Mia's situation all the more sad. The scenes give the characters, and the book in a general, another layer of realism.<br /><br />Also, I loveloveloved how music played such a big part in this book. Even though many books contain lots of music, the classical music mentioned in this book gave it a little something unique. Mia was often shown playing music or being around music, which made her even more real than all the other characters. LOVE.<br /><br />All in all, If I Stay = fabulous. It's worth every penny you'll spend on it.<br /><br />**Accidentally hit 4 stars instead of 5. x)
0316017922|4.0|Both a keen eye for shrewd observation and a sure grasp on historical evidence serve author Malcolm Gladwell fruitfully in this fascinating look at people who appeared at first to be \\"outliers\\" compared to mainstream society only to find themselves at the pinnacle of their fields through a symbiotic combination of talent, vision and intelligence. What made them outliers was out of their personal control, but what they make of the extraordinary opportunities they face is what sets them apart. Gladwell has already proven to be masterful at identifying social phenomena that no one else has discerned quite as lucidly, such as the source of fads and cultural changes in [[ASIN:0316346624 The Tipping Point]] and the effect of snap judgments in [[ASIN:0316010669 Blink]]. His approach here is no different in that he articulates his theoretical observations and then follows up with a series of brief, engaging case studies portrayed as real-life examples of his theories.<br /><br />The book's first section is a series of profiles high achievers and the historical conditions surrounding their successes. Gladwell puts forth the \\"10,000 Hour Rule\\", that is, the mastery in any field depends on 10,000 hours of practice, or approximately three hours a day over the course of ten years. Having that time made available is a key success factor for outliers. Case in point is Bill Gates, who at 13, was given access to a school computer where he could program for the next year. His passion was such that at 16, he gained access to the mainframe at the University of Washington where continued to hone his programming skills, all of this occurring at a precipitous time when computers were about to change drastically the landscape for information access. In the book's second section, the author moves away from circumstantial good fortune to the broader scope of cultural legacies we inherit from our ancestors.<br /><br />The most intriguing tenet he explores in this part is showing that it is more than cultural stereotype as to why Asians show strength and dexterity in academia. It started with the agrarian Southern Chinese, who have engineered and built farming and irrigation systems in rice paddies for centuries. This commitment toward efficiency and productivity contrasts with the more haphazard efforts of their European counterparts during the same time. Gladwell asks us to look at all this evidence, and we are led to our own conclusions. One cannot separate a success story from the host of events both in a person's lifetime as well as his ancestors'. Because he is an engaging writer who can tell a compelling story, the author can convey his ideas in a way that entertains as well as stimulates. He can ask questions, synthesize ideas, and connect the most remote dots into a pattern that provides not only credibility but sociological resonance. I guess the old clich&eacute; is right -- timing - as well as the right genes perhaps - is almost everything.stereotype as to why Asians show strength and dexterity in academia.

0307450570|1.0|I had purchased this item to give to my daughter who has just acquired her first sewing machine (at 30!) to inspire her to wonderful quilts/ clothes for her children/ cute stuffed animals for the fete/gifts for friends made from fabulous fabrics (eg cushions and bags). I was desperately disapponted to find that no needlework/use of fabric of any kind was part of Martha's \\"endless\\" ideas of craft. The level seemed more aimed at school children or craft teachers in Primary school with instructions for glitter eggs and paper printing and flower pressing. The only suggestion for a quilting ruler was as \\"the best way to cut paper\\" (!!).I would have thought(and clearly did) that an encyclopedia of craft would include Knitting, Crochet, Sewing, Quilting and so this book is anything but an \\"encyclopedia\\" for my purposes. Maybe I should have enquired more into Martha Stewart's domain.

B000UOGHKS|5.0|With Erotica, Madonna distanced herself from catchy pop hooks and embraced a more trance like quality.  Many listeners rejected this new approach. As a result, the album and subsequent singles sold below expectations.  When one listens to the tracks, it's readily apparant that the chorus sections are less \\"in your face\\" from M's previous efforts. Instead, the vocal hooks are interlaced more closely to the accompanied instrumentation. In addition, swirling stereo effects and growling bass lines are creatively utilized to pull the listener into the mix.  Sex isn't really emphasized much on this album except on the title track and Where Life Begins.  This nonsense, regarding the album being rejected by the buying public because of it being too sexual is absolute rubbish.  The record, although great, incorporated a sound that was less poppy than the general audience wanted from Madonna and therefore it struggled commercially.   A shame really, as it is one of her most accomplished and unique recordings to date.
0143036556|5.0|This book is certainly thought-provoking and will lead you to question  your own living habits and impact on the world and others regardless of your opinions on the book's content. As someone concerned with the future of the world, our resources and ability to co-exist, I happen to agree with most of Diamond's sentiments. I also, however, have some questions that I think would be interesting if Diamond or any other scholar decided to pursue them further.    My biggest question regards one of Diamond's biggest claims is that paucity of resources can lead to conflict, potentially leading to collapse of societies. He then goes on to note that this does not need to be a death knell for any society. Yes, a paucity of resources might make existence more tenuous but it does not automatically lead to collapse as noted by cases like Iceland. Instead, Diamond states that the way that a society reacts and responds to the paucity of resources or fragility of its environment ultimately decides that society's fate.    Are certain cultures more predisposed to respond appropriately to particular challenges?    Another question regards resource use and rational thinking; in particular, the usage and extraction of resources that can cause environmental harm. How do we go about selecting which places are more preferable sites for extraction/pollution than others? For some (not me), isn't the focus on protecting the environment irrational? The idea here might be that 'hey, I'm only concerned about my good and if I don't do it, someone else will. We're all going to suffer, I might as well make a bit more profit in the meanwhile.'    On the whole, a great and thought provoking book. If you enjoyed Guns Germs and Steel, you will like this book. Thank you, Jared Diamond, for another thought-provoking and insightful book.

B000002TWN|5.0|By 1995, the new jack swing era was history and mainstream R&B was dominated by glossy productions, calculated harmonies, and hip hop electronica. Chart-toppers even exhibited strong influence from the thriving rap scene, and the seemingly unlikely man to change the tides was a 21-year-old from Richmond, D'Angelo, with his absolutely brilliant debut \\"Brown Sugar.\\"<br /><br />\\"Brown Sugar\\" proved immeasurably influential as the first to explore a sound that would be labeled neo-soul and imitated by many in both the R&B and hip hop worlds for years to come. Bearing many nods to 1970s-era soul music as well as jazz and blues, D'Angelo manages to execute a gorgeous, nostalgic sound while maintaining a foot in the modern hip hop era as well. Produced, written, and recorded entirely by D'Angelo with a few contributions by legends Raphael Saadiq and Ali Shaheed Muhammad, the album is a masterpiece on all fronts, with beautiful music, wonderful performance, and incredible artistry.<br /><br />To call \\"Brown Sugar\\" smooth is like calling Jordan a pretty good ballplayer. D'Angelo's ingenious sound relies on slick keyboards, organic percussion, laidback basslines, and often other instrumentation including strings, horns, and pipes. And if the creative music isn't enough, vocally he is fantastic. With a range stretching well into falsetto, his voice moves from a light, airy, angelic quality to a smooth, full-bodied soulful tone. He has a one-of-a-kind voice, but his delivery is equally essential to his sound. In addition to his melodic singing, his delivery is just as often conversational and flowing, lending to a periodic hip hop vibe in light of the rich soul music.<br /><br />At ten tracks, \\"Brown Sugar\\" is a perfect length and bears incredible consistency. While he effectively explores a wide range of emotions, it never deviates from smooth soul and remains a powerful mood-setter throughout. Beginning with the classic title track, a hit, D'Angelo enters with a hypnotic groove immediately evoking an earlier urban era. D'Angelo uses a clever double entendre to croon simultaneously to a woman and his beloved herb, using language reminiscent of 1970s ballads but a sly humor as well. The hook is gorgeous, his light delivery allows his voice to soar, and this is truly one of the finest singles of the 1990s.<br /><br />After the superb \\"Alright,\\" an inspiring midtempo jam, and the yearning of \\"Jonz in My Bonz,\\" \\"Me and Those Dreamin' Eyes of Mine\\" impresses as a melodic love song with great guitar instrumentation. The transition into its follower, \\"S..., D..., Motherf....,\\" is flawless, barely noticeable until D'Angelo begins to express his surprised rage at discovering infidelity in a relationship. Even with all the raw feeling in this song, the music remains extremely mellow and enjoyable.<br /><br />The intro to \\"Smooth\\" is fine live jazz on piano, building into an uptempo jazz track. He then covers Smokey Robinson's \\"Cruisin'\\" with a lush arrangement of strings and soaring vocals. Still my favorite song might be \\"When We Get By,\\" a catchy, jazzy blues number with a tight horn arrangement, winding bass, and one of D'Angelo's finest performances. This song has a really inspiring feel and great mood. Both closers are absolutely brilliant, the awesome \\"Lady\\" and the moving \\"Higher.\\"<br /><br />It's amazing that this album is over fifteen years old now, because its currents are still so visible in modern soul and hip hop. Its nostalgia hasn't aged a bit and it still sounds brilliantly fresh and innovative. This is the type of feel-good music that never gets old and can be appreciated by any listener. Ever an artist, D'Angelo has only released one follow-up to date (1999's [[ASIN:B000035X1M Voodoo]]), and I highly recommend this essential listen to any music fan.n earlier urban era.

Even with all the raw feeling in this song, the music remains extremely mellow and enjoyable.    The intro to \\"Smooth\\" is fine live jazz on piano, building into an uptempo jazz track. He then covers Smokey Robinson's \\"Cruisin'\\" with a lush arrangement of strings and soaring vocals. Still my favorite song might be \\"When We Get By,\\" a catchy, jazzy blues number with a tight horn arrangement, winding bass, and one of D'Angelo's finest performances. This song has a really inspiring feel and great mood. Both closers are absolutely brilliant, the awesome \\"Lady\\" and the moving \\"Higher.\\"    It's amazing that this album is over fifteen years old now, because its currents are still so visible in modern soul and hip hop. Its nostalgia hasn't aged a bit and it still sounds brilliantly fresh and innovative. This is the type of feel-good music that never gets old and can be appreciated by any listener. Ever an artist, D'Angelo has only released one follow-up to date (1999's [[ASIN:B000035X1M Voodoo]]), and I highly recommend this essential listen to any music fan.
B00297FEUI|5.0|As soon as I saw the movie I knew I would have to get the score.  I loved the score for the first film, but I've learned from past experience that scores for sequels are not necessarily as good as those from the first film (and often they just recycle the entire score from the first).  I was happy to discover that this score has a lot of new music, while retaining some of the underlying themes from the first film.  That's as it should be, in my opinion.
B000ZN803G|3.0|When I heard about this story, I really wanted to like it.  Unfortunately, the story is told in a scattered fashion - It jumps from scene to scene and although it is not hard to follow; the story line gets too long and dull at points.  I have nothing against long movies but they have to be able to maintain my interest. i.e. Titanic, Magnolia, Gladiator...  What if I started to tell you an interesting story and after a few minutes I began to tell you a different story that was no longer compelling?  That is what this movie feels like.  One moment your involved with the movie, but the next moment your wondering if you should throw in the towel and turn on the SNL rerun.  The best things about the movie are the cinematography and the music.
B001O9BYGU|5.0|Probably one of the few books from my childhood that I don't mind people seeing on my book shelf. This story is a in a different level than the other kinds of fantasy if not a little gloomier. The aspects in this story are new and one of a kind; who thought bells could be weapons?? I never would have come up with that. The type of magic that is used throughout this book is realistic and fits into the environment.<br />The protagonist, Sabriel, is shown having to go through multiple trials in order to save her father and like most journeys Sabriel grows stronger both in her magic as well as emotionally. She is joined by a motley crew of characters that help her through this wonderful world filled with danger and above all death and all its manifestations.<br />A very enjoyable book with strong characters and a wonderful plot. Highly recommendable to both hard core fantasy fans as well as those just starting out. :)

Jamie Lee Curtis MADE the movie.  Her role just seems like it was effortless on her part, like that was the real her.

B0013NBBOW|5.0|Khan manages to do what no other Canterbury band seems able to do on Space Shanty: create something musically interesting and retain good lyrical content, with a decent singer to boot. Hillage's tone is unmistakable, and all the instruments are used with masterful taste. There's a good deal of counterpoint on the album, as well, which makes for good repeated listenings. I'm going to do this track by track, to provide a general feel to the album.    Space Shanty (8:59) - The opening track starts off with a sort of Led Zeppelin vibe: bluesy, spacey, and generally stuff that I don't like in my prog, but listening to the entirety of the track is rewarding. It's a very energetic song, but not my cup of tea. Some good Hammond organ that persists through the rest of the album. The texture changes pretty frequently, and the lead in to the solo around 3:00 is pretty cool. Despite the blues inflections, the structure of the song makes this an interesting track, with plenty of tempo and rhythm changes, as well as some harmonic exploration.    Stranded (6:35) - Less bluesy than the previous offering, with a descending piano motif that reminds me of Debussy's Second Arabesque. Harmonized vocals are prominent here, but not offensive. The track starts off pretty tame, but breaks into a diminished arpeggio around three minutes in that gets the energy going. The trading soloistic ideas at the four minute mark are ear-catching, and Steve Hillage's guitar sounds almost violinlike in the background. The end of the track transitions into the next track, but if you were playing it by itself, neither track would be harmed by the edit.    Mixed Up Man Of The Mountains (7:14) - A return of the bluesy sound (which I generally don't like), but I think that it works well for this track. One of the best tracks on the album, in my opinion. Some really nice guitar sounds on this track, distinct sections, imitative parts, organ shredding, awesome bass, and seamless integration of jazz and rock elements Hillage's solos.    Driving To Amsterdam (9:23) - Lyrically, the best track. I would say that this is the best track on the album. Good complex structure, yet strophic enough that it's pretty catchy. 4:37 is awesome. Changes in texture are frequent, and range from soft and introspective to jazzy to straight up rocking. There's a really neat ascending bassline at 6:15.    Stargazers (5:32) - This one starts of with a really cool and rhythmically active mallet riff that creates a spacey atmosphere, but the music degenerates into some hippie psychedelic-sounding crap that absolutely ruins the song.    Hollow Stone (8:16) - A good closing track. One of the few tunes on this album that has a minor feel to it. On the goodness scale, it competes with Driving To Amsterdam. The lyrics were written well, and there's an awesome heavy metal section at the end with some stereo phaser effects on the lead guitar, followed by about a minute of some awesome, awesome noise generated by the collection of instruments, notably by the organ. Not quite Penderecki, but any fan of tone clusters and stereo panning should be happy.

0307386171|5.0|Beautiful prose, minimalistic, poignant, insightful, inviting and extremely sad.  How the author accomplished all this much in such a short book is a true wonder, and only possible because of his mastery in language.  This book is about the precariousness of youth when it is entering into untested territories, full of uncertainty, hope and fear, undefined love and vulnerability, misunderstanding and unrecognized sincerity.  The different psychology of the virgin bride and groom on their first night, what a refreshing topic it is in our time, and furthermore it is done with intelligence and class!  This is an excellent book.

0441017177|3.0|The only thing I disliked about this novel is the insistance of the author to limit the travel between stars to sub-light velocities.  It's absurd to believe that these civilisations could maintain any cohesiveness when eons are required to maintain contact.  I dont trust \\"scientists\\" who place absolutes on any hitherto undevelopped,undiscovered. or currently impossible technology. That the boneheaded present-day non visionary crowd who have consistently made fools of themselves by pronoucing \\"we will never/can...(you fill in the blank}.  I like to quote Arthur C. Clarke:\\"When an elderly but distinguished scientist says  somthing is possible he is probably correct, when he says something is impossible he is very probably wrong\\"  There is current research(e.g. the Tau Zero Foundation)seriously considering faster-than-light  propulsion-Read \\"Centauri Dreams\\".  It is entirerly concievable that FTL will/could be a reality in the  distant future-Especially as distant an epoque in which the novel takes place.  It is really very irritating indeed for a SF novel to be so thoroughly  entrenched in such a present day technological quagmire as to render  the story unrealistic and to hobble the vision of an unimaginably  advanced future.  I'm impelled to quote Clarke again but adding his notion that \\"Any  sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic\\"  As far as this opinion being \\"Unhelpful\\" to a narrow few the reviews of the story are quite  clearly elsewhere in these pages.  My point was not to provide a synopsis of the novel but to illuminate those who are fatuously  unaware that a technology a million years advanced from ours would not adhere selfrighteously  to the present physics quandry of how FTL can be manifested.  Read the theories of Alcubirre, regard the possibilities of Zero Point Energy or antimatter.  Jesus! This story takes place in a type 2 civilization where they can harness the power of  whole stars!  Why don't the naysayers who regarde FTL as impossible scoff at this possibility  too?  SciFi is supposed to be visionary not stuck in the ignorance or understanding of present  day physics.
B001P3SA94|4.0|This movie tells the story of the Chicago electric blues scene that emerged in the post-World War II era and the profound influence it had on the future of popular music, especially rock and roll. Len Chess is a Jewish immigrant from Poland who attempts to bring black music to a wider audience. The early part of the film features Muddy Waters, the man who brought the blues of the Mississippi Delta to an urban audience by plugging his guitar into an ampiflier. He is joined by the talented but self-destructive harp player, Little Walter. Later Chess brings in other major blues musicians such as Howlin' Wolf and Willie Dixon, along with rock and roll pioneer Chuck Berry. The final 1/3 of the movie focuses on singer Etta James and her relationship with Chess.    The music featured here is outstanding and blues fan will likely enjoy the movie for that alone. I liked the first 2/3's of the film better. But the last 1/3, focused mainly on James, begins to drag and go off course. It also feels disconnected to the rest of the film, almost like the director, Darnell Martin, was making a different movie altogether. The film is also marred by various Hollywood cliches and historical inaccuracies. This is still a movie worth seeing. But it's a shame it is only good when it could have been great.
0307408833|2.0|I hate to say this because I had high hopes for the recipes...but they just don't taste good.  I made 6 of the recipes, and every single one of them ended up in the trash.  They ranged from not good to inedible.  I realize what Erin is trying to do is difficult...making things vegan, gluten free and egg free... so I give her props for making her bakery successful...but I question how much of it is hipe and how much of it is actually her food.  Anyhow, I would not suggest buying this cookbook as I unfortunately spent a LOT of money on the ingredients just for them to end up in the trash : (
B00000JGOJ|4.0|As soon as I heard the opening, voice-over monologue from Joan (Angelina Jolie), Playing by Heart had me. I knew it would be interesting, but I also saw the trap the writer/director/producer (Willard Carroll) had set for himself. I wanted to shout through the screen and warn him -- if only so at the conclusion I could have the schadenfreud of saying 'I told you so.' Because Willard Carroll, who has many more credits as a producer than he has as a writer or director, was making the rookie mistake of being too clever. Like one of his characters, Meredith (Gillian Anderson), a theater director, who when given a compliment that someone liked her play has to ask: \\"Before or after I deconstructed it?\\"<br /><br />Let's take a moment to deconstruct that opening monologue. First, Joan name drops Chet Baker, and this shows that she is very sophisticated, to appreciate Chet Baker. Even to know who Chet Baker is colors me impressed. But would she be the kind of person who appreciates Chet Baker for purely superficial reasons; like his movie star good looks that led photographer Bruce Weber to become a fan and make a documentary called Let's Get Lost that dwelled on Chet's Matinee Idol looks; and paired him with Chris Isaak, though their music was apples and oranges, merely because they both made photogenic models? Or would Joan be the kind of jazz fan who loved Chet for his beautiful sound and lyricism, even if years of drugs had taken their toll on his looks, and a drug dealer had smashed his teeth in, forcing him to adjust his embouchure to allow for playing with dentures?<br /><br />Besides name dropping Chet Baker, which could be either a good thing or a bad thing depending on whether Joan was sincere or merely a poseur, she quoted a line that I have always admired, or at least a paraphrase of it. The musician who played like Chet Baker was supposed to have said, when Joan wanted to talk about how his solo made her feel, that talking about music was like dancing about architecture. Or talking about love, also like dancing about architecture. I know this quote, actually it says that writing about music is like dancing about architecture, but the problem is, her friend, the Chet Bakeresque trumpeter, is not the person who made up this quote. I thought that Elvis Costello had said this, and he did say it in an interview in 1983, but when asked about it later, he didn't remember saying it, but thought he had heard Martin Mull say it. It is also attributed to Steve Martin, Frank Zappa, and Laurie Anderson. Even Frank Lloyd Wright is supposed to have said it, but that seems Frank Lloyd Wrong, because, being an architect, he would have seen no contradiction in dancing about architecture. Willard Carroll was so enamored of the simile that the original title of Playing by Heart was going to be Dancing about Architecture. But Willard Carroll, the producer, wisely decided that it would be too clever, much to the chagrin of Willard Carroll, the writer, and also Willard Carroll, the director.<br /><br />Playing By Heart shows various couples, seemingly unrelated, but all in various stages and phases of love. Joan (played to perfection by a young Angelina Jolie) is the kind of woman who talks too loud on the phone, yelling the intimate details of her life even louder to be heard over the din of the L.A. nightclub she is in. Keenan (Ryan Phillippe) is a keen observer. He doesn't say much, but you can tell that he doesn't miss a thing. He sees right through Joan, but keeps his own cards close to the vest. But it seems like to an extrovert like Joan, Eau D'Indifference is the most irresistible cologne of all. As she tells her sister afterwards, once again talking too loud into her phone:<br /><br />------------------<br />Joan: The lad doesn't say much and when he does, he finds just the right words to crush my soul.<br />==========================<br /><br />Angelina Jolie and Ryan Phillippe look like they would make a very cute couple, but here I have to say that they are both acting up a storm. Their good looks are like masks actors put on to portray characters. This film is pre-Oscar for Girl, Interrupted, and really shows great potential for Jolie. I would almost say that she is acting better here than in GI. Phillippe is an excellent foil for her. He is understated, while she chews up the scenery and spits it out. The more he holds back, the more you wonder: what is his deep dark secret?<br /><br />-------------------<br />Joan: [to waitress] I'll have a vodka martini, very dry, straight up. three olives, and... my sullen friend here will have...<br />Keenan: A Coke.<br />Joan: The poster boy for designated drivers will have a *Coke.*<br />===================================<br /><br />Paul (Sean Connery) and Hannah (Gena Rowlands) are also going through a rough patch, but the month is December rather than May. They banter like an old married couple, because they are an old married couple.<br /><br />------------------------------------<br />Paul: Don't look at me with that tone of voice.<br />===========================================<br /><br />Paul corrects Hannah's grammar. At one point she says she wouldn't feel any different, and he says 'differently.' Remember that distinction, because there is a small though subtle pay off later, in what passes for a running gag among the chronically clever. A lot of Playing By Heart concerns how we show our love by paying attention to the minute details of what is said by our loved ones, even if we correct their grammar:<br /><br />----------------------------<br />Paul: You're overwrought.<br />Hannah: I'm perfectly wrought. Given the circumstances, I'm even a little underwrought.<br />Paul: There's no such word.<br />Hannah: There is now.<br />==================================================<br /><br />The cleverest couple, and the character who lets her cleverness sabotage her happiness the most, would have to be Meredith (Gillian Anderson) and Trent (Jon Stewart). Meredith is, of course, if you have been paying attention, the play director. This is how her version of 'meet cute' plays out:<br /><br />---------------<br />Trent: You know I'm not just asking you to dinner as a pre-emptive strike against litigation. I'm asking because...<br />Meredith: I'll have dinner with you.<br />Trent: What changed your mind?<br />Meredith: Anyone who can say 'preemptive strike against litigation' with a straight face deserves a dinner companion.<br />=============================<br /><br />Trent is a match for Meredith in the clever department, but at least he doesn't take himself or his own cleverness too seriously. Just as in Jon Stewart's real life gig, as the anchor of The Daily Show, Trent knows the importance of humor:<br /><br />-------------<br />Meredith: Wow.<br />Trent: Yeah I know, the flowers are a little much, but I'm late. But only because I had second thoughts about the flowers and threw them away halfway down the block. Then had third thoughts and went back and got them.<br />=================================<br /><br />Sometimes though, in love and life, it is best to go with your first inspiration. The first thought, let alone the second or third. There is such a thing as over-thinking, Meredith. That is what Trent is trying to tell you, though he does it in a self-mocking way. I think he likes you.<br /><br />While Meredith and Keenan seem to resist falling in love and getting in a relationship with Trent and Joan, respectively, Gracie (Madeleine Stowe) and Roger (Anthony Edwards) just want a physical relationship without any emotional baggage. They are both married, but not to each other. Madeleine Stowe steals the show with her passionate performance. She, not the guy, is the one who pushes for the no strings set up. Anthony Edwards will be familiar to those who have seen ER in the early seasons, where he played a doctor. He is a different kind of professional here, but I wouldn't dream of spoiling the surprise by telling on him. By the way, there is a clever reference to the spoiler of all spoilers in this movie, so if you still don't know what Citizen Kane means when he says \\"Rosebud\\" you had better watch that one first.<br /><br />Another mystery is just who is Hugh (Dennis Quaid). He keeps turning up and telling people harrowing tales, and you really start to believe his sob stories, but the problem is he tells everyone a different story. If he is a con man, then what is he after? He never seems to get anything out of it. At one point he claims to be a TV exec in charge or ABC's Thursday Night Line-up. His wife is shacked up with the guy who is in charge of NBC's. Oh, the bitter irony, when he gets fired. The lawyer who is hearing his tale of woe is played by none other than Nastassja Kinski. But he passes up her offer of 'coffee.' What gives?<br /><br />-------------<br />Hugh: I'm better at all these lies I've manufactured than I am at the ones I'm living.<br />=====================<br /><br />Another sub plot involves a mother and son. Paul (Jay Mohr), the son, is dying of AIDS, and is using his last days to finally get straight, so to speak, with his mother, Mildred (Ellen Burstyn). Meanwhile, the movie keeps cutting back and forth from Hugh, Mark and Mildred, and the different couples.<br /><br />Back to Trent and Meredith:<br /><br />----------------------------<br />Meredith: Well, That doesn't take long does it?<br />Trent: What doesn't?<br />Meredith: I mean, you turn a guy down a-and WHAM. he just metamorphoses into an anger ball.<br />Trent: An 'Anger ball'?<br />Meredith: See.<br />======================================<br /><br />By the time the third woman has thrown out an 'anger ball' epitaph at her man, like it was the phrase that pays in a radio contest, you begin to suspect something. Just who are these sisters talking to? Who are the sisters they are talking to? Is it all relative? Stay tuned.<br /><br />The final scene is where all the cleverness takes its toll. What kills it for me is the sound track. They are all at an event with live music, it is actually supposed to be the jazz band that Joan dug. The trumpet player is the guy who said the line about dancing about architecture. But the music is smooth jazz mixed with an orchestral score, all obviously dubbed in. Jonathan Demme in Rachel Getting Married used lots of musicians playing live. It was well integrated into the scene, the only thing you could complain about was perhaps they had too many musicians. It is so fake in Playing By Heart, and the whole effect is ruined. Another example of jazz music being used in a film, but in a good way, would be Mo' Better Blues. I'm not saying that the music in Playing By Heart was bad, just that in this scene, where everything was riding on its integrity, it was fake, not the music that the band was playing. They had Chris Botti writing some tunes and playing trumpet, and actually had two composers scoring the soundtrack -- one was scrapped for some reason. There were a couple of Chet Baker recordings used for some scenes. But in the final crucial scene, when all the chips were down, writer/director/producer Willard Carroll choked.<br /><br />Still, I am giving this 4 stars for all the clever dialogue, and the stellar cast who really delivered their lines as if they had thought them all up themselves.<br /><br />---------------------------<br />Meredith: I'll tell you what I don't want. I don't want all this calculated artificiality. This dress, these stupid little bows in my hair, they aren't me. I mean, look at you. You - you don't sit around your house in an Armani suit, do you?<br />Trent: No. My house is black-tie.<br />====================================<br /><br />[[ASIN:B0019XZDZO Smart People]] (2008) ....

McCann uses this as a metaphor for freedom and the fact that most of his characters and us will never experience it. It's only for the truly daredevil or death-defying to gain it. Of course he doesn't mean in a physical way, but a spiritual. He uses a priest, prostitutes, artists, and mothers who lost their sons in the Vietnam War to show that life wasn't so rosy before 9/11 either. That there have always been lost souls moving and bumping into each other on the streets of New York City.  That seminal event didn't introduce New Yorkers to tragedy or the means of transcending tragedy. It's always been in the character of the city as exemplified by the struggling characters in McCann's novel. A good read.
0385341008|1.0|Do I need to introduce this unanimously praised best seller ? I'm sure I don't. Even the French blogs are all won over by this cute and pleasant story. I couldn't wait to read this book so I ordered the English edition, much cheaper than the French one. I was full of hope and pretty sure I was to love it, for all what I had read about it convinced me. Actually, the first half is really nice, interesting, and even funny. I liked the characters, very different but all are endearing in their own way. It was a good start, however, I suddenly realised that nothing retained my attention, and worst of all, the end of the story was predictable,(I had a confirmation by reading more reviews of the book). The story and plot could have been interesting, thanks to the historical context, but in the end, the novel is too superficial, too corny, too cute ! I haven't been able to finish it, I very seldom give up on a book before the end, but in this case, I felt like I was wasting my time.
B00004U8P9|4.0|The other reviews here talk about the picture and features, which are great.    Except for the audience participation track, which was what I was most interested in.      The comments that the fan club make are rarely \\"right\\", and rarely understandable, compared to the midnight shows I went to in NY back in the '70s and '80s.      These people don't even agree with each other about what to say, are constantly over shouting each other to the point that you can barely make out a word, and they Never, Ever, shut up for a second.  From the opening Lips shot to the closing credits, it's impossible to hear what either the fans or the characters on screen say.    If a studio ever made a solid attempt to get this part right, I'd buy that version in a heartbeat.
B000S88JTS|5.0|If you have any motorcycle movies or ride you must have this. It has been the classic motorcycle movie for almost 40 years. I still get stoked every time I watch it. I have had the good fortune to talk to many of the riders featured in it and they are real people who happen to have a real passion for motorcycles. It's good enough that I went AWOL (didn't get caught) in 1971 to see it for the second time.

0805079831|1.0|The evils Klein describes are those of fascism, and statism in general. It is in statism that the government is allowed to take someone's property by force. Pinochet and Allende were both statists, and the claim that Allende gave more back to the people, even if true, does not erase the fact that his government could only give back by first taking from the people. Like fascism, other variants of statism such as communism, socialism, despotism and feudalism are all based on the premise that in varying degrees, you do not own yourself, the State does. Or the King. Or the Country. Or the Majority. Or the Party. Or the People.    Capitalism by contrast is based on individual property, and no one is given the right to take away anything from you, or force you to do anything. You are free to trade with anyone on terms you both agree to. You are free to purchase as much contract insurance and law enforcement as you wish, from companies competing for your business. The potential problem of competing law enforcement companies using violence against one another rather than reaching a more profitable agreement, or the other potential problem of these companies joining to form a state, i.e. an entity with a monopoly on violence within a certain geographical area, are to be contrasted with the actual evils perpetrated by past and existing states, such as those Klein mentions.    Replace the word capitalism by fascism everywhere in the book and it will be a lot less wrong. If capitalism does not exist on earth now, it is mostly because of people like Klein, who should know better than to misrepresent it. Capitalism is in Klein's self-interest too, although she would have to switch to a more productive line of work than propagating lies. For a good introduction to statism vs capitalism, see Ayn Rand's Atlas Shrugged.
B0027HOBM2|4.0|Has anyone else noticed a glitch on Season 2 Disc 2 on the first episode? The episode will not play from the beginning; it skips ahead a few minutes?? Looks like a firmware upgrade will be needed.
B00009Y3L4|5.0|This movie is just a classic, one of the few, or maybe the only one picture that talks about the Weigmar Republic in Germany before the Nazis, but more important the decadence of a nation with a mask of entertainment, Liza Minnelli and Joel Grey are great in their performances, I recomend this movie 100%.
B001FB55H6|1.0|I was ready to purchase the Blu-Ray Director's Cut, but assumed it would include \\"Tales of the Black Freighter\\" material. It does not, thus ensuring a future release that includes it. Why do companies do this? Very disappointing - and a long wait before I will buy.
B0014I4KIK|4.0|Duffy should be here to stay.  Her album Rockferry is phenomenal.  I first came across her music on the website Pandora.  Her song Delayed Devotion made me want to hear more.  Each track is fantastic with Serious, Mercy, Warwich Avenue, Rockferry, and Delayed Devotion as standouts.  it is worth owning the entire album.  Duffy's voice is reminiscent of Etta James and the soul singers of the '60s.  Her voice reminds me of Amy Winehouse and Adele, but crisper and clearer.  Her talent should only grow and I am excited to hear what Duffy comes out with next.  Four stars!
B000026258|5.0|This release caused quite a stir when it originally appeared, and it is still a remarkable performance of a remarkable work. I think I would recommend newcomers to Reich's style to start with a later work - Different Trains would be an obvious choice - but you cannot, in the end, get around this hypnotic, straight out weird work. It won't ever be for everyone (again as opposed to his later work) but its status as a masterpiece isn't in doubt; perhaps not in the league of the equally revolutionary Pierrot Lunaire, but still a masterpiece. One thing is the general overarching idea(s), but listening to the piece one will also realize how eminently skillfully and ingeniously well-crafted it is; the textural variations work together subtly (such as the darkening occurring at the end of the opening, middle and final sections, working together to create a sense or an illusion of development and culmination). Compared to other versions, this one is rather quick-paced (not a criticism), although the shorter total timing is to a far greater extent due to the number of repetitions of the elements; balanced so that the piano is rather prominent (perhaps a tad too much so?); and generally rhythmically tauter and more urgently propulsive. But it is just as fresh-sounding and idiomatic as any of the later sets. If I have one major reservation, it is that the whole thing is fitted onto a single track; while I realize that, despite being divided into sections, we are talking about a single overarching span, at least ECM should have insert individual tracks to help listeners the first times around.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|Food Inc. is the new brilliant documentary which should shock all Americans about what has become of our food supply. It begins with the camera slowly panning through a supermarket, focusing on row after row of sanitized food products. The point is made that there are only a few multi-national corporations who actually produce the vast majority of food products seen on our supermarket shelves today. They seek to lull a complacent public into believing that the food we eat is wholesome and is produced in the simple spirit of our agrarian forefathers. Of course, we soon see that their marketing seeks to cover up a much more sinister reality.<br /><br />Food Inc. first focuses on chicken production. The filmmakers got a hold of one chicken producer who raises chickens for Tyson Foods, perhaps the largest poultry provider in the country. The chicken producer was more than willing to show his behind-the scenes-operation until he was told by Tyson to shut up. It's obvious they didn't want him to show how the chickens were raised--thousands of them shut up in a building devoid of sunlight and being fed with cheap corn products to fatten them up. Today's chickens were contrasted with the chickens of yesteryear and today they are twice the size. They were able to interview a woman who raised chickens for Perdue. She apparently was fed up and refused to go along with Perdue's directives to raise her chickens using mass production techniques. But even with her more humane efforts, many of her chickens were dying due to antibiotic resistance. The woman herself indicated that she had developed health problems as a result of contact with these antibiotics. One of the film's revelations I wasn't aware of, was that these small businessmen are at the mercy of the conglomerates and if they don't do what they say, they'll be put out of business.<br /><br />Another segment involves a food safety crusader who lost her three year old to E Coli contamination after eating a tainted hamburger. She sponsors \\"Kevin's Law\\", named after her fallen son but gets little support in Congress due to the lobbying efforts of the food industry who have prevented passage of the bill.<br /><br />More shocking revelations abound including an extended segment on just how pervasive corn has not only been utilized as a cheap source of food for livestock (leading to the proliferation of manure that gets into our food supply) but also how it's used to create new processed food with little nutritional value. We also meet a lower middle-class Hispanic family who can't avoid eating fast food even though they're aware how unhealthy it is for them. The father is suffering from early onset Diabetes which is becoming one of the fastest growing health problems linked to eating unhealthy meals of processed food. The family not only doesn't have the time to shop for better foods but they don't have the money--so they end up going to McDonald's instead.<br /><br />Immigrant workers are also exploited by the multinationals who used to recruit farmers in Mexico who could no longer compete against the big food producers in the U.S. They shipped the workers here in droves where they're now economically dependent on these corporations despite working in horribly unsanitary conditions. Now with anti-immigrant sentiment running wild, a few token workers are rounded up everyday to appease the public and the corporations are never charged with hiring illegal help.<br /><br />The most shocking information we learn is the role of Monsanto Corporation monopolizing the soybean market. As a result of a Supreme Court decision, Monsanto now holds a 'patent' on their genetically modified soybean. They've ended up destroying the careers of small farmers by suing them for violation of their patents (Monsanto's soybean ends up as part of the farmers' crop so they're accused of infringement). What's worse is the long line of government officials, former Monstanto employees, who are now (and have been) in the highest positions in the Food and Drug Administration responsible for food safety oversight. Ten years ago, there were 50,000 food safety inspections a year--last year the FDA only authorized 9,000. And these officials weren't only appointed during the Bush administration. President Clinton also had a healthy share of these former Monsantoites working at the FDA.<br /><br />While Monsanto is clearly the biggest villain among many, Food Inc. attempts to highlight more productive people in the 'system'. One interview focuses on an organic livestock producer who feeds his cattle grass and not corn. While it's clear he treats his livestock better than the conglomerates, I'm not a believer in the idea of 'compassionate slaughter'. Why eat meat at all? There's also an interview with the president of Stonyfield Farms, famous for organic yogurt. He ended up selling out to Walmart but he feels it was a good thing since 'better' products were made available to the public on a mass scale. Again, the sale of any kind of dairy products (organic or not) is not a good thing in the long run for one's health.<br /><br />Food Inc. attempts to end on an optimistic note. It's up to the consumer to choose more healthy food. The example of successful consumer action is cited in the case of the tobacco industry which was brought down after the public woke up to the deleterious effects of its products. Until the public is willing to look behind the veil of unhealthy food production in this country, they will continue to enjoy bad meals at McDonald's and other nefarious 'restaurants'. Food Inc. is one of those rare documentaries which can open peoples' eyes--and that's not easy to do!Drug Administration responsible for food safety oversight.

B000YIGNKE|4.0|If you love the story of Persuasion as I do, you will enjoy this version.  If you appreciate good filmmaking, however, you will find some of the storytelling choices kind of odd.    I am an Austen fan from way back.  I've read all the books, seen every possible film version, and even visited her house in Chawton.  I loved the 1995 version with Amanda Root and Ciaran Hinds because they made a good couple, even if they were both a bit older than the roles.  That version was mostly faithful to the book and flowed really smoothly.    Now, this version I got for the flippin' gorgeous Rupert Penry-Jones, whom I have loved in the series \\"Spooks\\" (MI-5 in the U.S.).  I thought he was a terrific choice as the dashing Captain, the subject of an eight-year obsession on the part of Anne and an undeniable Regency chick-magnet.  Sally Hawkins, on the other hand, took a little time to grow on me.  In modern dress and make-up, she is a beautiful woman, but in this version she often looked a little ill and greasy-haired.  I found it harder to believe that Wentworth would still be in love with her (although that's what I really wanted to believe).  In the 1995 version, the character of Anne underwent a gradual makeover, both in her appearance and her confidence, so that in Bath she looked quite fresh and lovely again and had some backbone.  Here Anne looked kind of the same, always off balance with her family, timid with even her friends, and terrified of Frederick.    I liked the fact that they showed some scenes of Frederick and Harville alone, telling his side of the story for a  change.  It removed the suspense about whether or not he still loved Anne, but it was a good way to insert things from the book that Wentworth just tells Anne about in the end, when it doesn't advance the plot.    I was not fond of many of the supporting cast, especially Elizabeth and Mary, but I could overlook that.  When one has enjoyed one version of a story for so long (and the 1995 film had such an excellent cast), it's sometimes difficult to appreciate a different take on the roles.  I also wondered why they had changed certain things in the story that worked so well in the book and previous version (overhearing the conversation between Harville and Anne).  I understand them wanting to put a different spin on things this time, though.    A couple of times one character yells another character's name over and over to the point of being annoying.  I think the screenwriter could have come up with some better dialogue than just, \\"Harry!  Harry!  Harry!  Harry!\\" or \\"Anne!  Anne!  Anne!  Anne!\\"    Minor complaints and personal preferences about casting or liberties taken with the story can be forgiven.  However, the ending to this movie was so incredibly botched it's a wonder what they were thinking.  It feels like they must have run out of money for the budget and had to slap together an ending to film in one day or something.  After all the slow build up, the climax is completely rushed and silly, not least because Anne takes it into her head to go sprinting from the Royal Crescent down to the Roman Baths and back (which is about two miles each way, if my memory is any good), with the same form as an Olympic marathoner!  It is so out of character for a lady of that period, whatever she might be feeling about her long-lost fiancé, even more so than the very awkward, public kiss on the sidewalk.  It also doesn't even make sense because she had just CLEARED UP the misunderstanding with Wentworth with regards to Mr Elliot (which was kind of sweet, how they did that), and yet he goes walking out the door and she feels like she must follow.    Her conversation with Mrs Smith was not only shocking because of her inexplicable recovery but the Deus Ex Machina-like way she runs into the picture to \\"explain everything\\" about Mr Elliot but without giving any evidence.  And, somehow, this quick chat gave Wentworth enough time to go home, write her a letter, give it to Harville to take to her, and run off to the Baths with the Crofts.  There must have been some kind of warping of the space-time continuum for this to occur!  I just hope Wentworth was on horseback for all his excursions around town (the same route that Anne took but without ever crossing her path) because he seemed to go a lot faster and yet wasn't out of breath as she was.  I could have forgiven her one crazy sprint through town, but she went and did it twice!  The very last scene, although also an invention, did a lot to restore a little romantic dignity to the characters.
B000025SL5|5.0|Christopher Columbus was, of course, a villain. It's a pity the Caribs didn't eat him for lunch, with chianti. The movie \\"1492\\" isn't good either. It's frankly boring, and I never managed to sit through all of it. However, Vangelis' soundtrack \\"1492 - Conquest of Paradise\\" must be one of the best soundtracks ever made! The music he made to \\"Blade Runner\\" comes as a good second.<br /><br />The best track is, of course, number 2, \\"Conquest of Paradise\\". Its even been released as a single in some nations, used during sport events, election campaigns, etc. Another favourites of mine are tracks number 3, \\"Monastery of La Rabida\\" and number 8, \\"Eternity\\".<br /><br />Listening to this CD during a very chilly, dark Swedish winter night is perfect...<br /><br />Enough said. But mark my words: he should have been EATEN.
B0013D8LCW|3.0|It's not a bad movie, but it's really no better than \\"average.\\" I don't understand why it's so overpraised. The acting is pretty bad at points, and some of the writing is awful (the main character's sister is a total caricature). It's a cute gay movie with a happy ending (and, let's face it, not many gay movies actually end with \\"boy gets boy\\"). If that's what you're looking for, you'll find this movie satisfying. But if you are looking for anything more, you're out of luck. Again, a decent movie, but nothing more than that.
B001UW58WW|4.0|I heard David Garrett performing and talking about his music on Public Radio recently and it was very refreshing.  I purchased this CD and have found it to be very entertaining with several very upbeat violin tracks on a wide variety of fairly well-known compositions.  This is not a good choice for those looking for traditional classical violin music; but it's very enjoyable for those looking for something contemporary, fresh, and lively.  Highly recommended.
0385340575|5.0|Neither Lee Child nor Jack Reacher disappoint! It's as good a page turner as any other \\"Reacher\\" novel. Full of action and suspense. I highly recommend this book.
B001KR0BDI|5.0|A brilliant debut novel. Neither the main character nor the author pull their punches. This will disturb some parents. If you are ok with your kids being engaged by a persuasive and sensitively written fantasy novel that is not afraid to grapple with issues of violence, sex, abuse and love, this novel will be devoured by you and your kids. Our 11 and 15 year old boys tore through this one. Kids are exposed to these themes whether we like it or not. I was very happy to leave them--and myself--in the caring and capable hands of this author.
B000OZ2CZW|5.0|This is the first R&B CD I have ever purchased.  Previously I have never felt that moved by R&B music but the work on this CD seems different somehow.  I like everything about her music.  Something about the music has all the movement you would get from good pop music but the lyrics are like poetry. She's amazing.
B001KVZ6F2|5.0|I won't bother with another run-down of this film's plot, I just wanted to add my nod of approval. Although the story poignantly portrays the clash of old America versus the new America, it is also a timeless tale of redemption, courage, sacrifice and humanity. Somewhat cliched at times, but overall much more thoughtful and touching (and funny) than I expected. As has been noted, the film is incredibly \\"politically incorrect\\" but alas, real life often is. 4.5 stars.<br /><br />PS- This film actually made me quite emotional. The ending was very sad but at the same time uplifting. I'm not a religious person, but the story brought to mind the words of the world's most famous philosopher:<br /><br />\\"There is no greater love than for a man to lay down his life for his friends.\\"<br /><br />Amen
6304140428|5.0|I remember the first time I saw \\"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?\\" It was for a film class in college. I was riveted to my seat, and although I realised that the dining hall would be closed and I would miss dinner if I stayed to the end, I stayed.   A brilliant production, and Taylor and Burton seem made for the parts! The viewer gets pulled into the created world of this disturbed relationship, and leaves feeling eviscerated. How vulnerable we humans are, even as we construct hardened shells to protect ourselves!
B00005JN0T|3.0|I was interested to see how they would turn Asimov's book in to a Will Smith vehicle.  The actual way they did it was not that bad.  They kept a few characters from the book and the three laws of robotics, and then went wild.  In that its not all the bad.  It successfully presents many of the themes and concerns that Asimov had in his stories and extrapolates further on them.  There are various event that were taken verbatim from the stories in the book.      The big problem I had was with the execution of the movie.  The story seemed to jump around with very little character development or explanations as to why things were happening.  At the movies conclusion, I was still left somewhat confused as to what ultimate outcome was intended. With a little more attention to the story and characters, this could have been a very good action movie.  Instead it seems that the 'glue' was cut to make more room for action sequences.
1400031524|1.0|This is my first Wallander book and I found it heavy going.  It started out well with the two dead men on the raft drifting into Wallander's jurisdiction, but once he goes to Latvia, it's just one vague, awkward paragraph after another.  Lots of hints about great suspense, possible death and a revolution brewing but the details are never filled in and you find yourself more and more fed up with Wallander and his endless cups of tea, sleepless nights and trips to the crapper.  I never really felt like I knew what was at stake in this novel, it was all very vague, full of insinuation and very little actual political detail.  I'm not sure why I kept reading it.  I guess I wanted to find out if it ever picked up and got good.  It didn't.      I'll read another Wallander, just to see if this was a fluke.  Hope so, because I like the character, but the writing was mediocre and the suspense non-existant.
B001KVZ6ES|5.0|Good movie, reminded me of my husband, he was a Korean vet.  Had a interesting ending.
B0019NB9NO|4.0|Star Trek: First Contact, is in my opinion, the best \\"next generation\\" movie out of the four TNG movies, by far, and one of the best overall star trek movies. It has everything: Good acting, good story, action, suspense, best star trek villians: the borg. One of the best things about the movie is that you will enjoy it if your a star trek fan or not. Can't wait for this movie to be released on blu-ray.
B000VDDDY6|5.0|I originally watched most of these from my fathers VHS versions from Paramount, some episodes he didn't have, and even he said, these remastered ones are MUCH better, while the original effects were by no means crap, because they were the best of the era.    The packaging is very nice I think, even though the disc trays are a bit fragile, you just have to be carefull...but shouldn't you be carefull with all DVDS/CDS? the discs are a little slipcase kind of thing, and the discs fit into the plastic outer casing, which is very nice, and keeps them safe.    The discs are double-sided, this season is HD/DVD combo format, and so you know which episodes are on which discs, it comes with a set of cards with that information, and they have pictures on the back, very nice!    The first season is classic, and these remastered ones make them even better than they already were.    If you are not a purist, these remastered ones will make you feel you are part of the crew, even more!    Thanks Paramount/CBS!
B00127RAJY|4.0|I purchased this DVD with the intent to tone up after my 2nd pregnancy. I was a little skeptical as to how good of a workout I would get in 20 minutes, but I'm impressed! The workout got my heartrate up and my muscles fatigued. The exercises and position were fairly straightforward. I started at Level 1 and even though I exercise at least 2-3 times a week, it kicked my butt! I love the fact that I can get a good workout in my living room with my just hand weights for the equipment! I'm not sure that I will use this everyday, but I consider it a great option for a workout!
B001FB55H6|5.0|The comic itself is a slow meditation on the nature of man and how we perceive ourselves; the heroes we prop up are representative of our best and purest qualities, yet there is no escaping our humanity, our own personal comedy of errors.     The story is a character driven drama. It was written as an intellectual piece meant to challenge everything from political belief to media culture to you the reader. This is definitely heady stuff, and probably a little too high-brow for mass consumption (at least our modern undereducated, self-entitled, fat, lazy, American society).           This movie is not X-Men or Iron Man. This is not Michael Bay. If you want to see a by the numbers, action movie where stuff blows up, then by all means go see one, there are a million to choose from.    I felt the movie 100% captured the essence of the comic while giving in it a much needed redux. For younger generations the comic was becoming inaccessible and antiquated. The movie makes the comic once again relevant, for now and into the future.
B00005JMK0|5.0|I loved this movie ever since watching it as a kid. I happened upon it at the local video rental store, when I was all of 8 years old - I was immediately drawn to the cover art, which clearly depicted the premise of a \\"living\\" computer, amidst a (then modern day) romantic comedy.     I grew up tinkering with computers and listening to classical music. I'm also a self-taught keyboardist/musician, and I'm well too familiar with the part of the lovesick, hopeless romantic--more than I'd like to admit. So I'm not sure if this movie appealed to me because of these things, or perhaps even had an effect in becoming the person I am today. Who knows?    The thing I do know, much to my surprise and comfort, after recently watching it again, as an adult, and after having never seen it since, through the eyes of that little 8 year old boy, was that his movie still held up to my present day expectations. I was worried of course, because of how some of your childhood favorites don't always hold-up to the memories you once had of them, when you try to relive it again.     This movie astonished me. It was still able to make me laugh, and even shed actual tears - something I don't even recall doing as a child. I do remember the laughter, though!    Perhaps, in some ways, it's even more relevant to me today, then it was back then; in broad terms, maybe, in personal terms, there's no doubt.     In short, if there is such a thing as a soul, this movie could fit mine like a glove.    I just hope the 2010 remake lives up to this classic... in my book, anyway.
B0017VG69U|5.0|A great second season (I like all 3), but this may very well be the best, and the remastered shots/audio look great (as with all 3 seasons), the stains, cuts, and so forth has all been cleaned up, and I can compare, I have 38 of the episodes on VHS that Paramount released back in the 80s.    Now, the first season is in HD/DVD format, this season is not, nor is season 3, but oh well, I just love that I can watch any episode, any time I want, and that's what it's all about!    Standout episodes...all are great to me, but these are the best to me.    Mirror, Mirror    Patterns of Force    A Piece of the Action    Bread and Circuses    The Gamesters of Triskelion    Obsession    The Deadly Years.    Great season, great remastering job, if you are a Trek fan, I do not think you will be dissapointed, if you are a purist, you may be, but I am not.    Thanks Paramount/CBS!
B00001OH82|5.0|OK, so as a long time Bowie fan I must cop to the fact that I really, really like this album. Alright, I love most of it. There. Now somewhere in some box in the basement I still have the cassette tape I bought back in the day when it came out... After watching some YouTube videos of Tin Machine live I am feeling inspired to update and get the CD of this excellent album.     But... what I remember from the tape [granted quality was not so great on commercial tapes etc.] was that the mix was very aggressive and sometimes sounded a bit wacked. So I am wondering, does anyone know if this remastered \\"ECD\\" version is an improvement over the original release in terms of \\"listenability\\" or overall mix?     Looking forward to revisiting Tin Machine - and a great phase in my life...
B0017SWPXY|5.0|In my job long flights and weekends alone are common so having companions along such as \\"The Art of Racing in the Rain\\" form strong attractions to get back to the book after a long day. The approach taken by Garth Stein is very creative with a dog who wishes that he could have been fitted with the Stephen Hawking voice box. This is an up and down emotions filled read and ends the same way as \\"Water for Elephants\\" with a satisfying close that make you feel happy to have invested the time with this author.
B001U0HBPG|5.0|One of the best D.V.D's I have ever seen. I would rate this one 6 stars!
B000A2RRF4|5.0|This is Michael Jackson at his tender, talented, exicting best. Not only is his performance over the top, the flow of the show is really engaging. The love and appreciation of the audience is phenomenal to watch. Grew up with Michael and the J5 but never got to see anything live. This is a must have for M J fans anywhere to treasure always!
0312360266|3.0|In a genre that is oversaturated with paranormal novels read by both adults and teen readers it is hard to come up with a unique twist to a story about vampires.  I think the Cast's did a pretty good job making the House of Night have a different premise than most.  All books marked at teens and involving vampires are going to draw comparisons to the Twilight series.  I devoured the Twilight series like it was crack or something, but I don't consider it one of the better teen vamp tales out there.  I don't think Marked was better or worse than Twilight but it is certainly different.  Marked is the tale of a teen named Zoey who has been Marked to begin her change to vampyre.  To do this, she must enroll in a school especially for the marked children.  The vampyres are vampyres-to-be worship a Goddess and theirs is a pagen religion.  This series definitely does deal with religous aspects.  The pray to the air, fire, water, and earth.  The envoke the Goddess when they pray.  The do rituals of purification to keep evil spirits at bay.  Zoey enjoys this and is drawn to it but is quick to learn that her fellow student, Aphrodite is performing the rituals with a dark twist.  Zoey is already disliked by Aphrodite and her crowd because she has a special mark on her forhead that sets her apart as being special, or futher along in her path to vampyrism than they are.  Zoey and her new friends come up with a plan to bring down Aphrodite and show her for what she is.  \\"Marked\\" is certainly a first novel because it spends a lot of time just setting up the culture, beliefs, and characters.  There are plenty of hints at things that never get resolved in this book.  Is Neferet, the headmaster type at House of Night really what she appears to be? How do the teachers and administration seem to know every thought by every student?  Why does Zoey have the special mark?  Why is she drawn to blood sooner than any other newly marked student?  I enjoyed this book and I have the next three in my TBR stack so I surely will read them.  The scenes of Zoey and her friends are fun as is watching Zoey come to terms with the changes in her life.  Zoey isn't exactly an every girl.  She is super pretty and has two would be boyfriends.  She is smart and special.  I didn't find her obnoxious or overly Mary-Sue typical.  Her friends are a hoot and add something to the book.  I didn't care for the drawn out pagen rituals and found those scenes really slowed down the rest of the tale.  My 13 year old daughter usually reads books after I have read them, but this one was leant to her by a friend.  I was horrified when I later bought it and read it to find out there was scene involving oral sex and an overabundance of really vulgar words used.  I don't mind either in a book I am reading but I don't think its necessary for a 7th grader.  It was a little too late for me since she had already read the book, but I wanted to mention it as a warning to others.  Parents might still think its ok, but its better to read and decide yourself.  As for me, I look forward to continuing this journey through the house of night but further volumes will have to be approved by me before going to my child.n my TBR stack so I surely will read them.

B000ZEE3I6|2.0|I was very depressed when I saw this movie.  It was absolutely nothing like the book which really sucked.  My kids liked it though but they haven't read any of the books.
B001PU8N0I|5.0|I never really liked Dickens - felt that his stories were too depressing and bleak.  But with \\"Little Dorrit\\", I was hooked from the first episode!  The cast was perfect - especially the leads (Matthew Macfadyen and Claire Foy), who brought passion and warmth to the show - you really root for them to come together.  The story was surprisingly heartwarming (for Dickens) and ended on an uplifting note.  The only character I didn't like was Andy Serkis's bad guy - he was overly camp and stuck out like a sore thumb amidst all the other excellent actors.  A wonderful and refreshing series!
B0021L8UM6|5.0|Today I had the privilege to view \\"Little Ashes\\" which Robert Pattinson starred in prior to becoming famous for his performance as \\"Edward\\" in the \\"Twilight\\" Saga.  I would like to extend my sincere gratitude to the great American Amazon site and to the British one as well who delivered the released DVD into my hands for this purpose.    To this date, I have not publicly reviewed any of Mr.Pattinson's movies, mainly because there were so many reviews already present, but today I felt compelled to share some of my thoughts because of his awesome performance in \\"Little Ashes\\".    Mr. Pattinson-Salvador Dali still remains as an image in my head; vestiges of emotions also linger. I know for certain that this movie will stay with me forever.    Before I watched \\"Little Ashes\\", I was already convinced of Mr.Pattinson's talent because of what he demonstrated in his three earlier artistic movies; The Haunted Airmen, The Bad Mother's Handbook\\" & the musician Art in How To Be. I should note that I will not make mention of \\"Harry Potter\\" or \\"Twilight\\" in this review mainly because of my personal preference for artistic, independent and expressive films. All three artistic movies that I mentioned above can be categorized in this genre of movie-making.    These three films were made before \\"Twilight\\" but after \\"Harry Potter\\".  Mr.Pattinson carefully picked these roles, and challenged himself by extending his talent beyond a cookie-cutter role that a young handsome man could easily have accepted. He acted convincingly and should be extremely proud of this. These different roles allowed him to shine and confirmed that he is on the right path in his career. He has already been rewarded with worldwide fame and glory because of his starring role in \\"Twilight\\". I am convinced of his talent and am glad that he is receiving all of this recognition. He deserves it!     As a Dali fan as well, I was really looking forward to viewing another creative movie about him. Other films have been made on this subject but if weren't for Rob Pattinson's rising star status because of \\"Twilight\\", this movie would never have seen the light of day on DVD format. Mr.Pattinson played the role of the world famous artist/surrealist painter, Salvador Dali, or as others know him, \\"Salvador Domingo Felipe Jacinto Dali I Domènech\\", convincingly and memorably. The haunting story of forbidden love, the love between two men. The audience is left with the eminent question of whether one can deny their one-and-only true love?     During the film I was skillfully carried away on a roller coaster ride of intensity and emotions; laughing, enjoying the Spanish music, the idyllic surroundings and Lorca's poetry reading. The subtitles were crucial because of the strong Spanish accent in his use of the English language. It was easy to feel a part of their lives with how intimate the scenes were. I felt as if I was sitting beside them, reaching into their vulnerability.    Mr.Pattinson pushed his limits playing the iconic & genius Dali; hysterical but incredibly shy, wrapped up with his bizarre and frequent out-pouring of complex behaviours; pushing the contradictions and eccentricities of behaviour in a matter of hours, and always living a life with no limits!     I applaud Robert Pattinson for stepping so adeptly into this iconic and complex individual; a multifaceted exhibitionist and genius on one side, and an awkward and annoying Salvador Dali on the other.  This bi-polar complexity took an immense amount of skill, not to mention courage, on the part of Mr.Pattinson. He did this with precision resulting in an extraordinary performance.     Mr. Pattinson's own career is bi-polar much like Dali, namely Pattinson's involvement with big budget Hollywood films, which in my opinion are made for a large consumer marketplace, as well as his emotional & intelligent passion for making \\"art\\" on the big screen.    I know this is just the beginning for Mr.Pattinson in terms of his career.The stage is set to accept and reward his efforts in the art genre... the doors are wide open and waiting for him.    My dream is to one day to see Johnny Depp, Jack Nicholson and Robert Pattinson acting together in a movie directed by Tim Burton.      I would like to thank Mr. Pattinson and wish him a well-deserved rest from the \\"Twilight\\" worldwide hype. I hope he knows that after this break at his home in England, the doors of the art movie industry and the big screen will be here waiting for something different...again...something different.....from this extraordinary Robert Pattinson.
B001GQACGO|5.0|Im not about to write a long a#%$# review...If you love beyonce you will love both cd's. The first cd with all the slow songs are awesome you can listen to it when you clean your house or have friends over. The second cd is what you listen to while driving in the car. loooove them!!!!
B00275EGWO|4.0|As I watched this powerful drama about a bomb squad set in Iraq 2004, I kept wishing that someone could strap Bush and Cheney into some seats and make them watch what their pre-emptive war does to human beings. The basic drama (it's not a documentary) follows three members of an Explosive Ordnance Disposal team, whose specialization is to find and defuse the infamous \\"improvised explosive devices.\\" They find these devices under piles of trash, in human bodies, in the trunk of a car, and in the Green Zone. But there's a larger drama at work here, as we watch how three very different soldiers cope in very different ways with this job, and what it does to each of their psyches. In this sense, the film is far more personal than political. The film does an especially good job of showing how difficult it is in Iraq to distinguish between friend and foe. The Iraqis watching the soldiers from their balconies and minarets feel as ominous as the bombs themselves. The Hurt Locker was filmed mainly in Jordan and has received uniformly rave reviews.
0316779237|5.0|I was given this book as a Christmas gift many years ago.  Laugh out loud funny so I lent it out to a co-worker.  He left the position and I never got the book back. I bought the book again and the exact same thing happened.  I have a copy now that I will never let anyone borrow again.  Buy your own because you cannot have mine!  Seriously, David Sedaris is one of the most brilliant writers I've ever read and having dressed up as an elf myself once before, I was crying because I was laughing so hard.  Definitely a great stocking stuffer if you are thinking of shopping early for Christmas...
0439023483|5.0|I'm not a big reader of kids or sci-fi books. I tend to stick with dramas and thrillers, but I'm starting to branch out, pretty much to get something less predictable(I can peg the 'killer' in a crime thriller in the 1st 30 pages or less). I'd heard about this book in random places, so I finally decided to go get it at the library.<br /><br />From the first page, I found this book to be shocking, amazing, gritty and totally engrossing. It had all the best elements of a good book, with lots of adventure and a little romance mixed in. Like many, I had trouble putting it down! I admit, it doesn't take a lot to entertain me, I love to read and if it's engaging, you won't see me throwin' stones. I don't care how original/unoriginal some claim it to be. It was an absolutely fantastic read and I can't wait to get others to read it, so I have a discussion partner!<br /><br />By all means, no matter what your taste in book, read this. I'm am kicking myself for not waiting a couple weeks to start The Hunger Games, because I swear, I'd give a limb to get my hands on the new one right now instead of waiting 5 more weeks!
0316017922|5.0|[[ASIN:0316017922 Outliers: The Story of Success]]Malcolm Gladwell's newest book, Outliers, is a remarkable reminder that success means different things to different people at different points in their evolution.  Communities - some not identified as such - create and nurture individual and group passion, energy, drive and results when collaboration, idea-sharing and skills are shared while weakness is shored-up. Passion, drive, innate talent and team collaboration replace entitlement, trust funds and genius IQs and work together to build strength and success.  This is an excellent read - both as a reminder that individuals and nurturing yet challenging communities are far more important than throwing money and privledge at any goal;  and it is a stimulating reminder that the definition of success should not be determined by external forces and/or those who are merely imposing intellectual or political influences - because they can - but rather by those on the ground and challlenged to achieve any goal - no matter how small or insignificant it may seem in the \\"greater\\" scope of \\"things...\\"
B000002KNI|2.0|Everything I hate about live concert recordings are in this CD:  half the CD space is wasted by audience noise and applause, plus introducing people I couldn't care less about; background noise; live action that does not provide good quality sound or music.  It was great listening to songs I haven't heard in years, but I would prefer to spend the money on MP3 downloads and get good quality.  For the people at the concert this would probably be good memories, but concert remakes should be cleaned up better for sale to others.
B001HDO4Z6|4.0|This Ep is composed mainly of outtakes from Cold plays \\"Viva la Vida\\" album, so you might expect that the level would be somewhat lesser than the \\"motheralbum\\". In my opinion this is not the case. Apart from the rather short playing time, the EP actually works well as a small album.<br /><br />This, of course,  is due to the fact that the EP offers a handful of very fine songs. Not the least vocal version of \\"Life in Technicolor\\" is a highlight. \\"Glass of Water\\" and \\"Rainy Day\\" are both fine compositions that easily could have been used on the \\"Viva\\" album. The acoustic closing number \\"Now My Feet Will not Touch the Ground\\" is a perfect conclusion to a fine release. If you, as I do, enjoy \\"Till Kingdom Come\\" from \\"X&Y\\" \\"Now My Feet Will not Touch the Ground\\" will be a safe \\"hit\\".
B001QT766K|5.0|I really enjoyed this story. Sophie Kinsella's books are always really easy to read and funny. This is no exception but its also a book with a heart. It makes you think about what if you had a seemingly 'perfect' life but you weren't happy? Would you be brave enough to give it all up for happiness? Read this, you'll like it!

0316168815|5.0|This book is so different to anything I have ever read before. The beginning is very uncomfortable to read, I found it disturbing and wanted to put the book down but I couldn't. Once you get through that initial discomfort of the storyline topic it becomes a haunting, thoughtful, spiritual book. I thought the authors descriptions of Susie's heaven were really beautiful and comforting in some way. This is a book I will never forget reading.
1932100660|3.0|I am enjoying this read, but am disappointed that he is totally blaming ALL cancer and degenerative disease on proteins and animal products!  I am sure the evidence is compelling for EXCESS consumption, but what about wheat and sugar?  I have Celiac disease, and he suggests whole grain wheat bread is great for you!  I think a large salad with sliced up grass fed beef would be healthier......and safer for me.  His chapter on autoimmune, again, blames it all on casein!  I do believe that misses the mark almost completely again.  The glutens in wheat, rye, barley and contaminated oats is being shown without a doubt to be a HUGE contributor to many, many autoimmune---specifically the Type 1 diabetes and MS he says are all related to increased dairy consumption.  I am disappointed that he is a total vegan who supports gluten grain consumption-----he needs to study up on Celiac disease and perhaps the health benefits of grass fed meat and dairy and organic eggs and poultry.  I think proteins in moderation is a very great idea---but human beings ARE omnivores.  I would be leery of grains LONG before I took out moderate amounts of grass fed meat and dairy.  And no fish?  Tell that to the Eskimos.  One more thing----he thinks soy is healthy protein.  I am shocked by this.  Soy has anti-nutrients in it that defy that claim and this also has been proven.  Even the Asians eat very little soy---if they do it is in small amounts and the soy is always fermented.  I wanted to gag when he was talking about finding some really great whole wheat pasta for his veggie primavera sauce............this 'healthy' dinner would make my entire family sick for weeks of agonizing symptoms of Celiac disease.  I still find this book valuable---but again I don't trust him entirely because of his ignorance about soy and wheat not being for everyone.

Definitely recommend this movie to anyone.

B001EN71DQ|5.0|I think that both theese boxsets are good but alot of people don't like star wars trilogy episodes IV-VI. Because it's has the same orininal updated movies and a copy of the original theatrical editions and the bonus material disc is gone. But I think you should just buy a copy of the bonus disc and buy both star wars boxsets. And whats the big deal.
B0013TPVXS|5.0|Many sequels can turn into a repeat of the first book - similar pacing, same characters, reminiscent feel. Not so in this book - this is certainly \\"the next story\\" with enough continuity to keep you coming back for more chapters, and enough differences to keep you riveted.
B001ED7C58|5.0|The music for this movie was surprisingly superb. I thought the variety and uniqueness of the music composition was great. I also really liked that one of the songs featured were actually performed by Rob (edward) himself. The music really matched the mood of every scene and the producers did a real fantastic job.

Steven, Thanks for your contribution.
0385340575|3.0|Child is in better (but not his best) form after his last book, Nothing to Lose, which was, in my opinion, a debacle, since Child felt he had to put HIS political words into Reacher's mouth. Child must have read the reviews and decided this was not a good path for Reacher.<br /><br />But he still had to let us know his views on American foreign policy in this new thriller, which I find annoying. Authors and actor should do what they do best and leave political opinions to others.<br /><br />The book is beginning-to-end action, tightly written and with some interesting information, like the \\"12 signs\\" developed by Israeli intelligence after 9-11. Some rambling detracted from the action, and I felt the plot and premise were weak. I also thought the ending was not totally credible.

0452295548|5.0|Like lots of people, my introduction to Jill Bolte Taylor was her TED talk, which I found incredible, inspiring and compelling--if not a little incomplete.  I wanted to know more;  more about the brain, her stroke, her recovery, the left and right hemispheres... just more!  The book was just as inspiring and compelling and mostly complete.  My only complaint is it's a short read--less than 200 pages--and I was sad to reach the end.<br /><br />I'm far from a brain scientist and don't regularly read up on the subject, but I never once felt lost reading this book. I enjoyed and respected the straightforward, sincere and passionate way Taylor narrates her experiences. I think there's much to contemplate in \\"taking responsibility for [our:] energy,\\" and \\"stepping to the right.\\"  I especially loved reading about the brain's capacity to heal and its determination to communicate.<br /><br />I just love Jill Bolte Taylor's story, basically. I think everyone should pick this book up and give it a look (at least watch the TED video!). I learned a lot. It was a fascinating story that made me feel like one amazing, incredible, miraculous machine and gave me a newfound appreciation and interest in what's going on in my brain and everything it's doing for me.
B00004RF8J|5.0|This big screen adaptation of the long-running Broadway musical is amazingly superb on every level. From the unerring direction of Frank Oz, to the wonderful performances (Moranis & Greene are perfectly nerdy & sympathetic as the lovers, and Martin is terrific as the sadistic Elvis-like dentist), to the chock full of cameos ( Bill Murray just about steals the show as a masochistic dental patient), to the creation of the manipulative, down-right nasty Audrey II (voiced brilliantly by The Four Tops' Levi Stubbs, Jr.), to the Greek chorus of Motown girls who offer musical narration, it all seems to work.   This is one of the most offbeat musicals I've seen, and one of the more excellently executed ones.
B001AUKUUO|5.0|Had this CD when it first came out back in the day. But like most of my hair metal CD's, traded it in when I lost the 80's mullet. Although I am not a huge White Lion fan, this CD was one I definitely had to have as I try to reacquire some of the past gems I had gotten rid of. Vito's guitar work is amazing! Mike's voice, although not my favourite by any means, is also pretty spot on. The rest of the band pull their weight too.   All and all, not a bad debut! Worth a listen or two!!!
B0000CDL93|1.0|As a political progressive with a lifelong interest in forensics - perhaps triggered to some extent by my childhood experience of the Kennedy assassination - I don't know which dismays me more: Oliver Stone's `truth-y' fiction about the JFK assassination; the credulity of those filmgoers who've given it 5 stars; or the way `JFK' has become the definitive version of events in so many Americans' minds.    Actually, I can relate. When I first saw the film in 1991, I wept alongside many others in the audience, shaking with indignation at LBJ, the CIA, and all the others implicated in Kennedy's `execution'. In retrospect, we could all be forgiven for our gullibility.  After all, `JFK' used real footage and was about real people, and its director had appeared on countless news shows, passionately defending himself and saying in all sincerity that he wished for nothing more than to set the record straight.  The conspiracy in the movie was, he claimed, a composite of the various true findings by researchers and investigators, and although he had employed `dramatic license' here and there, he stood by the basic conclusions.  Garrison was a hero who was onto something. Oswald & Ruby were pawns in a CIA conspiracy. The highest levels of government were directly involved.    `JFK' also boasted a terrific cast. It was hard to take your eyes off people like Tommy Lee Jones, Joe Pesci, Jack Lemmon, Sissy Spacek, and Gary Oldman.  (One bizarre note: the real Jim Garrison could be spotted in a cameo playing Earl Warren - a nasty irony if ever there was one.) Then there were the actual figures of the day, cleverly spliced from newsreel footage and conscripted into Stone's service without permission in order to lend the proceedings a veneer of documentary verisimilitude.      Make no mistake: `JFK' was exceedingly well-crafted - its editing and cinematography won Academy Awards - and my wife and I found the result powerfully compelling. Here's the problem: `JFK' is a crock. The movienot only gets the facts wrong, but willfully and hurtfully so.      Let's put things in perspective: JFK, LBJ, Oswald, Ruby, Clay Shaw, and Jim Garrison were real human beings. Understanding who they were and what they did is worthwhile and potentially precious to a country and its people trying to make sense of a painful event in the past that changed the course of history. But when a director - Oliver Stone or anyone else on the right or left - decides to portray history using actual footage and characters, success cannot be defined simply in cinematic terms. This is particularly true when director and producers are exploiting a national tragedy - think 9/11 - and profiting from it in direct proportion to the intensity of our feelings about it.     Frankly, I question Stone's motives. Surely he knew he was doctoring the facts, not merely indulging in `dramatic license', when his characters made demonstrably false claims about Oswald's skill as a marksman, the timing of the shots, and the so-called `magic bullet' that careful examination has revealed to have been perfectly ordinary in trajectory and effect. By 1991, when `JFK' was made, there was little doubt that the Warren Commission's findings about these matters were correct: Oswald was a crack marksman whose Marine target practice scores show he could hit rapid-fire bullseyes at 200 yards - more than twice as far as in Dealey Plaza.  He knew how to fire and reload the Carcano rifle smoothly and accurately, unlike Gary Oldman, and probably took 8.3 seconds instead of 6 or 7 because he lingered on the last shot for accuracy, as plenty of other marksmen have since demonstrated.    But the biggest absurdity of `JFK' was the very premise at the heart of the movie - that the deeply disturbed, manipulative, grandiose paranoid Jim Garrison was some kind of American hero. He wasn't, and his malevolent conduct was quite different than that portrayed in the film. For the record, it only took the jury 45 minutes to acquitClay Shaw. Garrison outed him as a gay and ruined his life, but Shaw had nothing whatsoever to do with Oswald...and neither did Carlos Marcello, Sam Giancana, Fidel Castro, LBJ, or the CIA.    It has been hard for many Americans to accept the truth about the JFK assassination.  If you look at the state-of-the-art forensic and computer analyses of the assassination that have been done in the past two decades, it is clear that Oswald acted alone.  Furthermore, he did it in a surprisingly coincidental, random fashion after reading in the Dallas papers on November 16th that the presidential motorcade was going to pass right in front of the building where he'd gotten a job one month earlier.  As is well-known, when Oswald made the decision to commit an assassination, he actually had a different target in mind: the ultraconservative General Edwin Walker, who lived across town. Unlike the Kennedy murder, the Walker attack on April 10th was carefully planned for more than a month and included surveillance, an alias, and mail-order purchases of a pistol and then a rifle. Of course, both were eventually put to other uses on November 22nd.      Remember, Oswald was an expert Marine-trained sharpshooter. Detectives estimated that his one shot at Walker from 30 yds would have been a hit if it hadn't been deflected by the window's crossframe, whose fragments struck Walker and knocked him out of range. Oswald was also volatile, erratic, and rage-filled - a loose cannon who had called an inordinate amount of attention to himself in the preceding year with his pro-Castro antics and embassy visits.  He was not the sort of man who would likely have been recruited by the CIA, KGB, or the Mob.  The same goes for Jack Ruby, whose decision to kill Oswald was clearly impulsive - he had actually gone out on Sunday morning to drop by the Western Union office and wire some cash to a stripper in his employ. On the way home he swung by the police station, and when he saw the commotion outside,he decided to park the car, leaving one of his beloved dogs on the front seat while he ran inside to catch a last glimpse of Oswald.  Ruby, a staunch Kennedy supporter who had been obsessively hanging out at the station since Friday, later told his rabbi that when he saw Oswald smiling, he snapped - `I just had to shoot him'.  Of course, he thought everyone else felt exactly the same way he did, and was reportedly stunned to learn that murdering Oswald had not made him a national hero.    But why was Ruby carrying a gun? He was a strip club operator who disdained bouncers and often threw out unruly customers himself. His friends and employees later said that he always carried a loaded revolver - hardly abnormal in Texas culture then or now. It's likely he'd wrestled all weekend long with his rage at Oswald, and perhaps with the notion of shooting him. When Ruby went out to Western Union that Sunday morning, though, he didn't know it was going to be his last hour of freedom. He just happened to show up at 11:20, and out walked Oswald at 11:21. It all happened in an instant, as so many murders do.    Was Ruby part of a conspiracy? In the film he's depicted surreptitiously planting the `magic bullet' on a hospital gurney, but the idea was as preposterous in 1991 as it is today, and Stone knew it.    Back to Dealey Plaza - forensics, computer simulations, and reenactments of the shooting have all been consistent with the autopsy findings and demonstrate that both `hits' -  the Kennedy-Connally first shot, and the fatal head wound third shot - were fired from the 6th floor window of the Texas Book Depository, not from the picket fence or grassy knoll. The first shot passed through the president and then the governor in a relatively straight line, not the zigzag claimed by the movie Garrison. Although flattened in the process, the recovered slug was sufficiently intact - though hardly `pristine' - to be matched conclusively to both Oswald's rifle and the fragments in Connally's right wrist.  As for the third shot, a careful examination of the cratered entry wound in the posterior aspect of Kennedy's right parietal bone, coupled with a comparison to his filmed position at the instant of impact, confirms that the bullet was fired from above and behind.  The subsequent head motion `back and to the left' - endlessly intoned by Costner in a truly dreadful sequence - could be expected and has been replicated numerous times in various kinds of simulations.  This was all in the Warren Commission report, and available to Stone.    In forensic, behavioral, and circumstantial terms, the case against Oswald as the lone gunman was always overwhelming and extremely robust.  Were it taken to trial - then or now - conviction would be a certainty. But if you ask a broad sample of Americans for their opinion about the JFK assassination, a majority believe the movie version is closer to the truth. In my view, this is yet another layer of the Kennedy tragedy, a fire on which Stone et al have thrown gasoline.  `JFK' is an entertaining film, to be sure, but for the wrong reasons. The Kennedy assassination was one of the most shocking, puzzling, and painfully tragic events in the lives of many Americans, and yet somehow Stone managed to exploit and distort its indelible images into a film  that is anti-history, and whose legacy is ignorance. One star, and less if I could.

B000002GBK|5.0|After recently purchasing an Audio-Technica USB Turntable and a Logitech 2.1 speaker system for my computer I began gathering up some of my old friends from the 70's.    First, I need to explain to you younger folk what I am talking about. These \\"old friends\\" are black vinyl, with a hole in the middle, normally having a round paper label attached to said middle. We called them records, or albums, or simply LP's.    Secondly, I need to admit that I've never listened to any other Wakeman solo albums or CDs except for Journey to the Center of the Earth. I've also never listened to Myths & Legends of King Arthur & The Knights of the Round Table except on vinyl, although I do own over 250 CD's, this is not one of the titles that I own.    Thirdly, I am no audiophile by any stretch of the imagination, BUT, I know what I like, you can debate facts and fiction with me, and whether or not it is popular or not makes no never mind to me. I stick to my guns.    OK, all else aside here is my review. I listened to this LP ALOT in 75 & 76 and loved it. After listening to YES Fragile on my new set up (and loving it) I pulled out this LP and began to listen to it. Was it as good as I remember it being some 30+ years ago? absolutely not!! It was even better than I remembered!!! I love the composition, the music, and the sound ROCKS. I love the orchestration combined with the progressive rock sound (perhaps that's why I think Metallica's S&M is the best Album they have released thus far ... I own it on CD and vinyl and in my lowly opinion vinyl far outshines the CD version). Face it, you either like symphonic progressive rock or you don't. If you like The Who's Tommy (not the Movie Soundtrack), Metallica's S&M, you may like this one. As for me, I love it.
B00007GZR5|1.0|This DVD is marked as closed captioned, but what's missing is that there are no closed captions or subtitles in English, only in French and Spanish. I don't know French or Spanish, and need English closed captions. Luckily I got this DVD from the local public library rather than bought it before I found out I have no access to the movie through lack of English-language closed captions. There's no way to add this information near the top when the specific features of the DVD are given, it only says that a movie is closed captioned or subtitled or not, so I can only give this information down here in the comment section.     Amazon.com, please allow for the ability to say whether closed captioning means English or not. It's not meaningful to say a movie is closed captioned if it turns out none of the closed captioned languages are in English.    I wish I could give zero stars rather than one star, because this movie wasn't even accessible to me at all.
B000ZEE3I6|4.0|The sixth installment in the Harry Potter film series, HALF-BLOOD PRINCE, has its moments.  Indeed, there are twists and turns and plenty of romance galore that are threefold.  Consisting first and foremost, Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) continues his wizardly quest for good over evil despite the ever-menacing spirit of Lord Voldemort, which left movie viewer's gasping during the ORDER OF THE PHOENIX, second, Harry as possible candidate under the tutelage of Professor Dumbledore (Michael Gambon)to become his successor, and third, the hyper-sensitive hormones that Harry and his peers, Ron (Rupert Grint) and Hermione (Emma Watson) simply cannot escape as part of their stage of adolescence.<br /><br />The film appears much darker than the previous two and breaths similarities to the cinematography of a LORD OF THE RINGS or Tim Burton film and other epic renderings that have had a medieval-like quality depicting heroism and myth.  With that in mind, there are high and low points of the film that avid Harry Potter movie fans may notice.  Indeed, the lighter moments are exhibited with the giggly somewhat sappy scenes that show new Hogwart's Professor Horace Slughorn concocting magical love potions that get the wizards abuzz.  Ron experiences his first romantic encounter with Gryffindor student, Lavender Brown (Jesse Cave) while at the same time Hermione appears to have a crush on Ron that has her feeling a little left out; Harry is also game with Ron's sister, Ginney (Bonney Wright).  But there are scenes and characters in the film that simply did not have enough of an impact and attempted to put a bit of a punch within the film, such as the conflicting scenes with Professor Severus Snape (Alan Rickman) and Harry as well as the presence of femme fatale Bellatrix Lestrange (Helena Bonham) who looked like something out of Edward Scissorhands with her gothic persona, and the mystery surrounding the Half-Blood Prince and looming suspicions of Draco Malfoy (Tom Felton).  But film-goers will no doubt be looking for the concluding climax of the film that did not appear unpredictable, especially for readers.<br /><br />For the most part, HALF-BLOOD PRINCE was highly entertaining and clich&eacute;.  Harry Potter fans will flock to see the film as they see the intensity of the scenes but may also leave one either empty handed or hungry for the next installment.  The film is indeed filled with a mix of emotions and love potions thus earning 3.5 stars.l no doubt be looking for the concluding climax of the film that did not appear unpredictable, especially for readers.

B001N44BVQ|3.0|I guess most of \\"Body\\" was shot in Morocco and it's fun to watch.  But keep your forefinger on fast-forward at all times because things occasionally get ridiculous.  Leonard DiCaprio has proven himself at times to be a really good actor.  This isn't one of his best efforts, but he's earnest and lithe.  Crowe is wonderfully chubby, crumpled, and self-absorbed -- and with that familiar glint in the eye.  Boy-toys and black SUV's kicking up dust zoom onto the screen just in time to save you from yawning.     The love interest is intelligent and lovely and a cut above the rest of the film.  She has a sister who asks the question we all want to ask: what the heck do we Americans think we're doing over there, kicking up dust and murdering whoever gets in our way?! What was it, after all, that we're saving the world from?
B0000683DH|5.0|I've watched this so many times that I think I've memorized it.  And why not?  It's always entertaining.  You can't beat Montalban hissing and threatening as the insanely vengeful Khan, Shatner in a controlled performance as the aging Kirk who finds out about a relative he didn't know he had and also loses someone close to him, Bibi Besch as the lovely and sensitive Carol Marcus, Nimoy and Kelley maintaining the right balance for Shatner, Nimoy giving a very moving performance towards the end, and Koenig and Winfield suffering very palpably under the influence of those nasty little Ceti eels!    The director's cut mainly provides some extended footage and a few more lines of dialogue here and there.  Of course, it's also a better resolution than before.  I did not watch the extra features but they sound good.    If you like the story, I highly recommend the novelization of it too.    Get the popcorn and enjoy this film!
B000Q6GUW0|1.0|Some people deserve to die.<br /><br />With this feeling, I was attracted to Dexter. Maybe he would be a genuine hero. Superman has an irrational conviction against killing. The Dark knight on his motorcycle had a chance to mow down the evil Joker, but the Dark Knight was shy.<br /><br />I looked at Dexter's customer reviews: out of 444, only 27 were below four stars. But even though I had bought the first season of Heroes because of its high reviews, I hesitated to buy Dexter. After all, Heroes turned out to have a despicably silly character named Hiro Nakamura. And amazon.com posted still photos from season one of Dexter. They made me think that the program had not been done seriously. So I rented the first disk. My apprehension was confirmed. This show has too thick a strain of levity.<br /><br />If you are like me, if you want a serious theme to be treated with gravity, I recommend that you rent before you buy. Or do neither.<br /><br />Maybe I should have given it two or three stars instead of one. Yet, one star indicates something not worth your time. I will stick with one star. Better, more serious ways to spend your time are available.
B000067CQK|2.0|We all know this is a landmark album, we all agree on that point.    However....    The ENTIRE STEREO L - R CHANNELS ARE REVERSED!!!  Not just one song, EVERY SONG!     Many are wondering how does it sound?  I am a sound geek, here is my take.  The bass and drums are a touch muddier and have more warmth then the previous releases.  I think that is good because Bowie's vocals are more prominent in the mix giving each song more bite.  The older pressings on cd have more of a vintage feel.  This is basically Ziggy Stardust version 2.0 for a new audience.    But still, how can you have the sound channels reversed?

0439023483|5.0|Because I definitely can't. This book had me captured from the beginning, and, once Katniss volunteered, I couldn't stop, I couldn't tear my eyes away (though, unfortunately, my mom made me go eat dinner). Well-developed characters, interesting plot line, excellent twists in the story. I don't understand how someone could NOT like this book. A brilliant woven story of romance intertwined with action and adventure. It felt right, and it was right, and left me craving for the second book. I've been waiting for seven months, and I don't know how I'm supposed to be waiting any longer. This book has crept up the list and has now claimed the spot of my favorite book of all time. Right now, the only book that has a chance of dominating is Catching Fire, which is the sequel to this book, and hasn't even come out yet.    For those who say that this book is too much like Battle Royale, I will say that it is like Battle Royale, but also completely different. And this story goes further with romance, and a possible rebellion in play in the next book. I cannot WAIT for the next book to come out.
0394873742|5.0|This book is bigger and there is more to view than the description credits, the best of Richard Scarry.

1400063736|3.0|Like several other readers, I really wanted to love this book and get into it, and the premise sounded really interesting. It didn't really hook me though and I couldn't finish reading it. Maybe it's just not my kind of novel, as it seems others have really loved it.
B0017ZB8M6|5.0|It's different but a great album, I love her song \\"thinking of you\\", my fav song. \\"i kissed a girl\\" is sort of embarrassing for a straight girl to like, but it's an interesting song.
B0027G783W|5.0|I will be the first to admit that I was not fond of Moby's previous album LAST NIGHT, his return to his dance roots. I must admit I was a bit nervous with his most recent WAIT FOR ME but thankfully I had nothing to worry about. WAIT FOR ME is Moby's return to what I have come to know and love from Moby. The music on WAIT FOR ME is reminiscent of Moby's breakout album PLAY with gospel/blues tinged songs like \\"Study War\\" and the title track.Unlike 18 and HOTEL, I find myself able to listen to WAIT FOR ME without skipping a single song.I really enjoy the melodies through out the album. I find the music great to unwind to after work or chill out in the morning with a cup of coffee and the newspaper. I certainly can see WAIT FOR ME being in my top ten albums of 2009. I think it is fantastic. This is the Moby I have come to know and love.
B0006GAO3G|5.0|I rate Get Shorty five stars as an enjoyable and very funny film about the gang, movie makers and what they may or may not have in common. John Travolta was the best of the ensemble including Danny DeVito, Gene Hackman and Uma Thurman. When I first saw this film in 1995 I told my wife that I understood calculus better than this plot. After watching a few minutes of this old film on TV I recently decided to see it again and give it a second chance.  It was clear, very funny and I really enjoyed it on my second watch.<br /><br />John Travolta plays a loan shark and collector who doesn't enjoy his line of work or hurting people. In fact, he would really like to make films, his greatest passion. That alone should be enough of a hook to get you to buy or rent this great film.
1603420398|3.0|This is an attractive book, good format, but after 2nd reading, I conclude it's of little practical value to me, as I'm mainly into crocheting afghans of my own design, and hoped this book would provide some inspiration, particularly with squares and hexagons.    However, the squares don't really grab me because many of them are too dense or heavy for afghans (OK for potholders maybe), or have too many long skip stitches (snag on afghans), or would be difficult to execute without a messy wrong side.    The hexagons are few in number and have the same problems.     And the book fails to point out to those who are somewhat challenged geometrically that pentagons (5 sides) cannot be assembled in a flat sheet and so are only good for doilies, decorations or potholders. Beginners especially need to be warned about this before they attempt to use a pentagonal shape as a modular unit.     Triangles in crochet are very problematical due to the difficulty of getting sharp points and straight sides, and most other \\"unexpected shapes\\" or other regular shapes aren't really good for modular assembly either. (Octagons are OK, but you have to use square fillers.)     So while I don't regret adding this book to my library, I probably won't do more than get it out once a year to see if it inspires anything.
031236198X|3.0|A wonderful, creative attempt to teach through storytelling and fables.  Highly effective and entertaining .
B00003CWL6|3.0|This movie came up in conversation today and I remembered I had bought it because I really like Kevin Spacey and because it won Oscar for Best Picture. So I watched it and am really weirded out. This is a 1999 movie and when it was made, I would have been exactly Kevin Spacey's character's age. Having undergone one myself, I totally understand his midlife crisis and somehow, even his solution. The Burnhams are very real due to the acting talents of Spacey and Bening; however, the movie is unreal. Or is it the other way around? There are so many inter-connections and twists and turns, yet it's predictable at the same time. At least there are only 6 major characters to deal with: two married couples and two teens, the couples' children, no less.<br /><br />I'm giving this 3 stars because it's close, on the positive side, to 2 and 1/2 stars: totally midpoint since I am so muddled and ambivalent about this movie.
1400049628|5.0|This book is so researched around zombie movies, it makes the perfect gift for any fan of the living dead!

B0011NVC9I|4.0|Beowulf is a magical piece of literature. And it's a good idea to keep some of the Anglo-Saxon original text. The director tries all he can to make the setting and costumes and psyche of these people realistic for the fifth and sixth centuries after Christ when Denmark was still believing in the Nordic Gods, Odin first of all, and before the arrival of Christianity at the beginning, after its arrival at the end. Interesting too to change the tale slightly to make the two half into one logic, the second half being the sequence of the first. Interesting too to use the magic of these old days and hence have some supernatural beings and events. It is true Grendel, his mother and the dragon were supernatural alright. But instead of making explicit the references to the giants and pre-human species surviving in total exclusion, instead of making explicit the reference to the runes brought to human beings by Odin himself, the director chooses a sexual line, from beginning to end. Then the monster is the son of the local Danish king and the mother who does not have a name but is a gorgeous woman disguising some kind of witch, a sorceress who has little difficulty mesmerizing the local king with promises of power into providing her with a son who will eventually be the scourge of the country and will have to be killed.  Hence Grendel is the \\"son\\" of the local king when Beowulf arrives in Denmark and the dragon will be the \\"son\\" of Beowulf himself. He will kill Grendel, then tame the mother by giving her a son, and finally kill that very son, the dragon. This addition kills something in the tale. Beowulf is the obvious Christianization of traditional Nordic tales and sagas in Anglo-Saxon territory in the seventh to ninth centuries. This is present in the film, but the sexual dimension of these monsters goes against this Christianization since it states that every generation will have to live under the menace of a monster produced by the fornication of the previous king with the supernatural woman, as if such pagan facts could survive in front of the Christian faith. This rewriting of the tale is thus for a modern audience, what's more for a young audience. This is quite clear in the electronic and computer game conception of the fights.  And this young audience does not care for all these religious things, including Christianity, and they can very easily imagine Christ having dinner with a dragon and being served by some unicorn. Dropping that dimension of believing and even faith that the saga originally had transforms the story into some kind of post-modern fantasy for a world that does not believe in anything and where believing has been transformed into some kind of personal private matter whereas it was a public communion with the whole society through its common rites and fears and hopes. Then the end of the film is the promise of a third monster, whereas the end of the saga was a final stop to the existence of all monsters.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines, CEGIDhe supernatural woman, as if such pagan facts could survive in front of the Christian faith.

B0018BB20W|3.0|No question, for clarity of sound the 2008 remaster is the best CD issue of this album ever, but....    Those of us who have been listening to this album (on vinyl) since it's release in 1967 were no doubt perplexed when we first heard it on CD. Why? Because the LP and the CD(s) contain different mixes. The story, as I've heard it, was that the album was remixed in 1978 because the original master tapes had deteriorated and all subsequent issues of DOFP have been made from this remix which lacks several key overdubs found in the original.     To some, perhaps most, the mix differences are inconsequential and hardly noticeable. For them I heartily recommend this CD. The clarity here is stunning and aside from a few instances where the musical background overpowers the vocals its about as good of a remaster as you're ever going to hear. The bonus material is interesting as well.    What is disappointing to me is that no CD has been released of the superior original mix. I have heard that there were plans to release one in 1997 (from a submaster?) but that never came about.     Until that happens I will jealously guard my early pressing of the vinyl LP as my preferred listening source for this classic album.
B000W91RUG|1.0|I can not comprehend the rave reviews for this series.   It is one of the worst I've seen.   The characters are NOT multi-dimensional or interesting -- they are the most one dimensional gag puppets bad sitcoms have ever produced.   That is especially true of the much praised Simon -- a ridiculous, thoroughly unconvincing cartoon character, whose only motivation is to look goofy and odd.  Gilligan's Island and My Mother The Car look like great, intellectual works of art compared to The Big Bang Theory.
B002E01LL6|4.0|If you are looking for a gritty docu-drama about steet fighting...this is not it. However, if you want an uplifting story with some good acting and a few fights thrown in... Welcome! I gave it four stars out of five for its entertaining value, rather then the artistic achievement (for that it would have been two stars only).<br /><br />Based on the title, I expected roughly 90 minutes filled with an assortment of muscle bound men who tried to kill one another in creative ways (and what's better to relieve the stress of a long day in the office?). Instead, what followed was a charming story about an underdog who wins in the end, and, of course, gets the girl. The story is not new. And yet, such is man's hunger for the uplifting value of the tale, that we continue to crave it, and I'm sure will do so for millennia to come.<br /><br />The strong point of the film were its lead performances, particularly that of Terrence Howard's as Harvey, the hero's street wise, but vulnerable and down on his luck, handler. The hero, Channing Tatum (Shawn the Street Fighter), should have worked harder pre-movie to build a believable street fighter physique. As he was, one had to engage the suspension of disbelief quite frequently in order to \\"buy\\" his supposed fighting prowess. In real life, anyone betting on him to win would have had to be either drunk, or his mother. However, what Tatum lacked in muscle power, he more then made up for with his charm. The chemistry between the three leads (with Zulay Henoy as...Zulay, the love interest) carried the story.<br /><br />So, what was missing? Motives are always important to the viewer. But, it seemed the writers had spent very little time coming up with good ones. Extra few minutes of work on their part could have saved me from having to work extra hard on developing empathy for the hero (yes, I'm a lazy viewer; for $9.00 plus cost of popcorn and soda I want it handed to me). Secondly, the fight scenes could have been better. Aside from Tatum's toothpick appearance, I felt the visual potential and the high energy charge of a no holds barred match were never fully realized. Inexplicable, given the talent Hollywood seems to have on its beck and call these days. I felt the creators shortchanged themselves by not fully utilizing Tatum's opponents, mainly Yuri Foreman, a real life professional boxer, and Cung Le, a world class martial arts champion.<br /><br />Overall though, I am pleased I saw \\"Fighting\\". I left the movie theater with a wistful smile on my face, glad that the good guy had prevailed once again...ready for another day in the office (where the good guys/gals don't always win...alas...).arance, I felt the visual potential and the high energy charge of a no holds barred match were never fully realized.

B001QTXM5Y|5.0|I give it 4 1/2 stars in reality, but I rounded up. \\"Watchmen\\" is a great film. I know a lot of people, including the creator Alan Moore, disagree with me. Well, let me frankly state that they are biased fools. I will explain why.      There's two ways to look at \\"Watchmen.\\" One is as a movie, without thinking about the source material. Is this regard \\"Watchmen\\" is great, because it makes you think. Maybe it's a little slow for all the automatons who want nonstop explosions, but then I'm sure you also would've preferred McG or Michael Bay behind the camera instead of Snyder. It's gritty, it's rough. Bad things happen to good people, good things happen to bad people, vice versa for both. Like all the great treasures, it appeals--not to humanity's joy of pretty lights and sounds and fire--but to resonating within us; to a degree, scaring us with what could be. It was similar to my experience with \\"V For Vendetta\\" (another Moore adaptation he [shockingly] disliked.) When I walked out of the theater, I was grateful I didn't live in V's world. Same for \\"Watchmen.\\" The shots were well done, the violence never really feeling overdone because blood and bones really DO act like that. PEOPLE really do act like that.       Looking at \\"Watchmen\\" as an adaptation of the graphic novel, I have to wonder what people are talking about when they say it wasn't accurately represented. Some of the camera shots were EXACTLY as the panels are in the comic! Maybe a thing was tweaked here or there, but otherwise it was one of the most accurate representations I've seen. Now, I know what you Doubters [also known as Mindless Moore Monsters] are saying: the ending. Well, people, I have to say the movie ending made a hell of a lot more sense than the comic's. In terms of terms logistics of the bad guy's plan alone [go ahead, MMM's, look the word up up; I'll wait] it's a better storyline. Snyder cut out only what he needed to cut out, only tweaked what needed to be tweaked. That's why I'm veryexcited about the Director's Cut, because it PROVES Snyder cut for necessity, not style! Anyone who thinks otherwise needs the Comedian to slap them upside the head.      Does \\"Watchmen\\" have flaws? Yes. Manhattan's a little too proud of his firehose and the sex scene(s? can you really count Dan's failure one?) is unnecessary and rather badly acted (the only part though!) Otherwise, it's a spectacular film, both on its own and as an adaptation. Alan Moore wouldn't be happy unless it was done verbatim, scene for scene and line for line, from the source. And even then he'd still probably throw a fi
0061767581|4.0|I'm from SoCal and I've been a fan of the show way back when it was called 'Laguna Beach'. I feel the need to defend this book because so many people are freaking out about it's success.<br /><br />Some people need to realize that these shows have A LOT of fans and these fans aren't necessarily reading this book for it's literary value. They are reading it to be entertained and to learn behind-the-scenes info about the reality show business. FYI, Lauren's book is pretty informative in this area and I'd recommend it to any young girl or boy who wants to move to LA and live the glam Hollywood lifestyle.<br /><br />Anyway, according to [...], Lauren had a ghostwriter helping her with the book named Nancy Ohlins so it's really childish for people to make 1-star reviews ASSUMING that it will be a bad book just because someone from an MTV reality show wrote it when they haven't even bothered to READ the book. Being a grownup means you should actually read a book before reviewing it, or are you really any better than the person and the book you are attempting to criticize??<br /><br />All that being said, if Lauren really did have a ghostwriter, Nancy Ohlins did a hell of a job making it look like some writing N00blet 1st timer wrote this book. The writing was choppy and stilted at times and didn't flow well but it found it's rhythm eventually. The characters weren't really elaborated on and it was just too easy to put cast members of the show into the roles. Jane is Lauren, Whitney is Hannah, Madison is Heidi, Jesse is Brody, Scarlett is a mixture of Audrina (looks) and Lo (obnoxiousness). anyway those are my theories, I'm sure other fans have their own :D<br /><br />The book ended at a cliffhanger with nothing resolved, which was disappointing but on the other hand I know I will have 2 books to read in the future while lounging next to the pool or at the beach so I'm not too broken up about it.<br /><br />Final note - I listened to this on Ipod w/ Lauren reading it.

B0001EFTVA|5.0|One of my favorite things about most of the anime out there is its ability to have heart, be funny and yet show a point of view from an angle not expected by most Americans. Tokyo Godfathers not only does that, but it has actually 4 or 5 distinct viewpoints running throughout it, depending on what character you are focusing on. The character sare all completely selfish, yet care about this baby in their own way. Awesome animation too. A definite must-own.
B0008ENICU|5.0|This was the first time I got to see The Women although I've heard about it for years.  Men is the subject but not one single man is seen in the movie.  The acting holds up, the characters hold up.  Very enjoyable.  Very believable.

B000IOM1Z0|5.0|What I really love about this album, is just how strong the theme is throughout it. Some of APP's albums, like \\"Eve\\", \\"Gaudi\\", and \\"Ammonia Avenue\\", are only loosely held together by some points of commonality. And of course, \\"Tale of Mystery and Imagination\\" has a \\"theme of inspiration\\" as opposed to a \\"theme of content\\". But \\"Turn of a Friendly Card\\" not only adheres as closely to its theme as \\"Tales...\\" does, but the basis of it is so well executed. The only other APP album which comes as close to telling a full story is \\"Eve\\".<br /><br />There is something about the album which appeals to me at a deep emotional level. I've never had a gambling problem (which is the theme of the album), but the recurring line of the album, \\"the game never ends/ when your whole world depends/on the turn of a friendly card\\" just feels like so much of my life. I think anyone who lives life not accepting what they have, but wanting more, or who has ambition, or has taken risks can identify with that feeling, the feeling of being on the rollercoaster and just not being able to get off of it. And the album captures that so well.<br /><br />I have yet to meet the APP album I didn't like. I was introduced to them via \\"Vulture Culture\\" and then \\"Stereotomy\\", eventually I got the \\"Best of...\\" discs, but didn't listen to them for years. After emerging from a decade of Metalica and Marilyn Manson, and rediscovering the music I grew up on, I pucked up \\"Turn of a Friendly Card\\". I now own all of their albums, and I like something about each one of them, but \\"Turn of a Friendly Card\\" gets heard more than the others put together.
B000MX7V5M|5.0|Cary Grant and Grace Kelly star in the 1955 Alfred Hitchcock film.  This version is almost technically perfect and the surround sound is excellent on a home theater system.<br /><br />Grant plays John Robie a retired jewel thief known as \\"The Cat\\".  While enjoying retirement on the French Riviera, he learns of a copy-cat thief that is stealing gems from the luxury hotels the way he used to.  Robie is out to clear his name.  He recruits the aid of an insurance man and meets a wealthy American heiress, Frances (Grace Kelly) and her mother (Jessie Royce Landis), thus romance ensues.  Robie's old pals from his past come about and as with any Hitchcock film the audience is not disappointed.  The breathtaking views of the French Riviera make the film even more enjoyable.<br /><br />The chase is out to find the copy cat thief.  The movie never lets you down, a total action thriller!  There's a great car chase scene through the mountains of southern France with Grace Kelly at the wheel---wait a minute, is this a foreshadowing of what would happen in the future?  In this pituresque film, she drives like a professional through the windy roads.<br /><br />This is one Alfred Hitchcock movie that you should not miss.<br /><br />Watch it and enjoy!

B000TEUSJA|1.0|I spotted this while walking idly around \\"Best  Buy\\" last night.  I bought it, brought it, watched it, and will be putting it in the trash tomorrow.    The only thing that makes sense is Nerva's suicide:  Sir John obviously wanted out before this movie stank the place up.  After that, you're left with the feeling that Tiberius hates Caligula, Caligula *loves* his sister, and not much else.    It's just a sort of aimless, purposeless, display of decadence.  In the end, Caligula decides to kill everyone in order to take their wealth and keep the games going, and everyone rebels.    It's just kind of disgusting and hard to make sense of, with no redeeming features.  Avoid this DVD at all costs.

B0021L8UMG|3.0|For most of his life, Salvador Dali denied that he had ever been lovers with the tragic poet Federico Garc&iacute;a Lorca -- until the end of his life.<br /><br />So, writer Philippa Goslett and director Paul Morrison explore what may have been in \\"Little Ashes,\\" in which two young men become close friends, more-than-friends, only to have their relationship splinter apart. It's a powerful little story with astonishing acting by Robert Pattinson and Javier Beltran, but it tends to meander and shake way too much.<br /><br />In the Madrid of 1922, a shy and awkward art student named Salvador Dali (Pattinson) is drawn into a circle of  vibrant, iconoclastic young artists, including filmmaker Luis Bu&ntilde;uel (Matthew McNulty) and poet Federico Garc&iacute;a Lorca (Javier Beltran). Lorca in particular is intrigued by Dali, who is just discovering his unique melty surrealist style -- and it's not a platonic crush. And though initially he fights against the attraction, a trip to the seaside reveals Lorca's feelings to Dali.<br /><br />But as their attraction grows, Bu&ntilde;uel feels shut out and tries to pull Dali out of Lorca's orbit -- and after an unsuccessful attempt to consummate their affair, Dali vanishes to Paris without a word. A possibly insulting movie and many years widen the split between them, until Lorca meets Dali, now world famous and in love with the \\"witch\\" Gala (Arly Jover). Dali has changed, and so has Spain -- with terrible results.<br /><br />I know relatively little of either Dali or Lorca's lives, but it seems that \\"Little Ashes\\" is less about what happened than about what MIGHT have happened. Unfortunately it also falls prey to a common flaw in biographical movies, even if they're semi-fictionalized accounts -- it meanders randomly much of the time, and has awkward jumps between the different phases in the two men's lives. And what is up with Beltran suddenly reciting poetry in Spanish?<br /><br />But if it meanders, it's a picturesque meander -- sunny streets of Madrid, shadowy apartments, rocky beaches, weird surrealist visions of Paris, and fun nightclubs where bright young artists congregate. Paul Morrison has a straightforward directorial style with few ups or downs, but there are some beautiful moments sprinkled throughout it -- such as a balletic swim in a moonlit blue sea, or the bittersweet final scenes for Lorca (interspersed with Dali frantically smearing black paint all over).<br /><br />But this movie would be utterly forgettable if it weren't for the leads. Both are painfully magnificent, both in their chemistry and in their attempts to embody their characters. Beltran is a tragic figure who brims over with passion, sorrow and integrity, and somehow you know that things never end happily for this poor man.  Marina Gatell has a small but well-acted role as a young woman passionately in love with Lorca, but obviously she can be nothing more than his friend (and once, a sexual proxy for Dali).<br /><br />And Pattinson exudes almost Johnny-Depplike skill in almost becoming Dali. This is no glamorous \\"Twilight\\" role -- at first Pattinson plays him as a twitchy, painfully awkward and shy young man, but as Dali grows in confidence he also becomes more insistently eccentric and flamboyant, to the point where Lorca no longer recognizes him as a person. Mad laughter, insane grief, and all the time we're never quite sure what he's truly thinking about anything -- except, at the end, about Lorca himself.<br /><br />\\"Little Ashes\\" is a flawed portrait covered in jewel-like paint -- the actors are truly astonishing in their skill, but the direction is a straightforward and spotty affair.

B001FB4W16|4.0|This Tv show really has it all, Sex, gore and some truly interesting characters. Just the kind of show HBO needs to bring it back into the mainstream.

B000002LE6|5.0|Prince was not the most successful aritst sales wise of the 1980s (even though he toppped the charts with \\"Purple Rain\\" and a number of big singles) but arguably it was his greatest decade of musical output.  Nearly every year the prolific singer-songwriter-musician had a full studio release out (excluding only 1983 when he was touring, making \\"Purple Rain\\"  and working a handful of albums for others in his Minneapolis fam).  In the case of \\"LoveSexy\\", the experimental musical madman messed with the emerging format of compact disc.  Instead of letting listeners go right to their favorite tracks, one of the many benefits of the new media, the 1988 album was released as only one long track with nine songs almost seamlessly mixed so that it is almost one continuous song.    Thematically, the album is a companion to the dark, dense and humorous \\"The Black Album\\".  Released as a substitute when that album was pulled and shelved by Prince and Warners, \\"LoveSexy\\" sounds like the complete opposite (although the trademark offbeat humor is there).  Nearly every track has a euphoric upbeat groove and lyrics as exhibited in \\"Positivity\\" (\\"Have you had your plus sign today?\\").  There is something so urgent yet peaceful as Prince sings over layers of guitars, keyboards and drums.  He is a at peace about having \\"No smack on his brain\\".  While the funky and carefree \\"Alphabet Street\\" (featuring playful banter with rapper Cat) was the hit, the two singles that weren't so succesful are gems not to be missed.  \\"I Wish U Heaven\\" starts with a simple drumbeat (likely provided by Sheila E. as it is in the video) but then the track soars as Prince's vocals and a beautiful musical arrangement carry this request out.  \\"Glam Slam\\" is an effective rocker with a passionate Prince screaming over a wailing guitar and great synthesizer work.  While the album is mostly dance music with a very positive message about God and love, \\"Anna Stesia\\" is sinister song about sin (where Prince seems to confess in order to be saved) while \\"When 2 R In Love\\" is a sexy ballad that seems strangely out of place thematically here as it did on \\"The Black Album\\" where it was originally a track.  Still, the album has no weak spots and the reason for making it one track makes sense so it feels like such a full experience rather than just songs placed on an album to fit an obligation.     As a follow up to \\"Sign O the Times\\" and the predecessor to the misguided \\"Batman\\" soundtrack, \\"LoveSexy\\" is arguably one of Prince's last great albums that works as a tight concept album but also an amazing sounding pop album filled with joy filled bliss about heaven but also some great Prince kinky quirks (including the controversial cover) that showed Prince was still not a saint and certainly not stale.

B000ZEE3I6|4.0|Briefly, this latest rendition of the Harry Potter saga was quite well done, an above average of the series and could possibly be the best so far.<br /><br />Not only was it a darker, richer story, but the scriptwriters were surgically precise in cutting out of Rowling's book all the fat and leaving the meat.<br /><br />They cut out the Dursely's (SP), which is fine with me. Off with the Minister of Magic, including Fudge and his replacement. Away with many of the Tom Riddle memories that were expounded in the book. No Snape detention sentences. No Dobby!<br /><br />And that's OK. What was left?<br /><br />Teenage angst in the form of loves lost, loves gained and love POTION! The film concentrated on personalities for the most part and the fun and excitement of Quidditch (kinda like wizard soccer).<br /><br />The acting was not overdone, but in many ways subdued with was a point of contention with me. Also the ending was much subdued than the book. The book's exciting battle of Hogwarts and the confrontation with Snape and Harry were extremely suppressed to a minor ten minutes. Damn few wizard battles though the attack on London by the dark wizards was fascinating.<br /><br />The Pensieve and the whole memories smoke thing was intriguing but new viewers who have not read the books may not totally follow.<br /><br />We're rooting for Harry, Slughorn and wondering about who the Half-Blood Prince is (which revelation was much better done in the book). A character dies, a chapter closes, and hints for the next segment make you want more.<br /><br />And the soundtrack score at the credits is to die for.<br /><br />Highly Recommended.<br /><br />[I'm not understanding why my positive review is getting negative votes! Please do comment on why this is.]<br /><br />Also you should pick up on Amazon:<br /><br />[[ASIN:0439785960 Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (Book 6)]]<br />[[ASIN:B001DPHDI8 Harry Potter Years 1-5 [Blu-ray]]]
0307278255|3.0|Unfortunately, I have to agree with those who have raised issues with Lahiri's single-minded focus on one group of people, telling and retelling the same story but in separate settings and with slight variations.    Do not get me wrong--Lahiri is an extremely talented writer, but this collection is not as \\"piercing\\" or \\"raw\\" as her Interpreter of Maladies.  Nonetheless, UE is a wonderful, hard-to-put down book. You get drawn to the characters, their well-being, their flaws.    Here is another fixation of Lahiri's that I've seen now in story after story, and it is getting tiresome:  cultural assimilation and inter-racial marriages.   She is obsessed with mixed marriages, and yes they happen, and it's no big deal.  But with Lahiri, it seems to happen all the time, as in every story.  The majority of Indians still marry Indians among the first generation here.  Once in a while, she should showcase that reality, with the truth and emotion that she treats mixed marriages with.      And yes there is assimilation. It happens in all societies.  But Lahiri has an uncanny ability of picking out the most fractured, f***d up people you can find.  And this is not an honest representation of 1st generation of Indians here.
B00003CXTG|1.0|I really can't sum up this flaming pile of turd any better than Trey Parker already has:    I miss you more than Michael Bay missed the mark  when he made Pearl Harbor.    I miss you more than that movie missed the point  and that's a lot girl. And now, now you've gone away  and all I'm trying to say is Pearl Harbor sucked  and I miss you.    I need you like Ben Affleck needs acting school.  He was terrible in that film.  I need you more than Cuba Gooding needed a bigger part.  He's way better than Ben Affleck and now,  all I'm trying to say is Pearl Harbor sucked and I miss you.    Why does Michael Bay get to keep on making movies???  I guess Pearl Harbor sucked just a little bit more than  I miss you.
B0000640VO|3.0|Don't get me wrong, I like quirky movies, and the quirkier the better; but there's got to be more to it - it's got to ring true on SOME level.  That's what this film is lacking - the ring of truth on any level.  Boys don't just leave their prize possesions in a box behind the wall and forget about them, ever - not unless they've been dragged away by wolves   (which would have been a nice touch).  And it's exactly this same style bilge the movie keeps piling up ad nauseam.      I don't blame the French - this is clearly a film that was made for the export market. I'm sure shallow and self-centered women from Liverpool to Los Angeles have no problem seeing themselves as this beautiful girl, wamdering the anticeptically idealized and sepia tinted streets of Paris, doing utterly implausible good deeds for people without ever a single thought of their own happiness.  Of course they do find a good looking hunk to love in the end - otherwise what would have been the sense doing all those stupid good deeds for people.    Oh yeah, the girl is beautiful and the film is well made - for what it's worth...
B001QTXM5Y|4.0|This is not so much a review of the film, but a comment on the dvd.  The Tales from the Black Freighter was said to be included on the director's cut of the dvd, however, it seems the additional footage are cut and extended scenes from the movie, and a 2nd director's cut is to be released in Dec. '09 which would be the definitive version with the extra footage and the Tales from the Black Freighter footage cut back in.      I really hate double and triple dipping by studios, and I am not saying not to buy this when it comes out, but be aware that another version of the film is to be released at the end of the year.    \\"Warner Bros. will release a director's cut on July 21, 2009, and the extended version with the animated film edited back into the main picture in December\\"  --Wikipedia

This DVD is amazing to watch and is close to recreating the magic that he most certainly gave to his concert fans. And he did give his all...the dance segments, choreography, and sheer magic are incomparable. I'm amazed at how much energy he put into his performances. I highly recommend this DVD...it does not disappoint.  RIP Michael. You were a genius and your legacy will live forever.

0765322889|3.0|I started writing a scathing review of Mr. Erikson's writing technique and then asked myself what I had ever written. The answer was \\"nothing\\" except for some papers for school. Having realized this, I decided to change the tone of the review (although not the grade I give this book). This is what I would like to have seen: a more consistent story line in which events are connected by something more solid than mere juxtaposition. I understand there is magic involved but in some instances I would have liked to understand how characters come by certain pieces of information (example, how does Lorn find out that Sorry is no longer possessed by the Rope?). I would like to have seen more elaborate world construction. Sometimes, this world feels like a sketch. References are made to events that are not present in this book and are not fully explained ipso facto.  Overall, I am willing to give the author the benefit of the doubt and read the second book of the series in the hope that he will have learned something from this book and imporves in the second one.
0786888628|5.0|A look at the U.S.' forgotten war, even more despised than Vietnam. Mr. Halberstam brings together elements within Communist and Nationalist China, Stalin's USSR, North and South Korea, and our own political maelstrom to show how the war started. He details how the military's de-masculation after WWII leads to the nation being totally unprepared to fight a land war in a remote nation few were familiar with. He paints a less than complimentary picture of U.S. military leadership, leading to the complete failure of U.S. troops in the early phases of the war, the totally disastrous decision to advance to the Chinese border, and the bloody battles which are fought to an ultimate stalemate the remainder of the war.
0307454541|5.0|In this absorbing, intricately plotted mystery, I felt like I was right beside our journalist-turned-detective as he works to solve the mystery of a girl who disappeared some 40 years ago. Mikael Blomkvist, a disgraced journalist found guilty of libel, agrees to take on the assignment offered to him by the head of one of Sweden's wealthiest families. And why not? The job will provide a hefty paycheck and he has little to do anyway as he awaits a prison sentence. It turns out that Blomkvist's experience as an investigative journalist makes him the right man for the job. Larsson immerses us in Blomkvist's routine as he hunkers down in a cabin in the remote lake country of Sweden and methodically sifts through reams of old police reports, family photos and other materials, and slowly learns about the family's dark history through his explorations of the small island community.<br /><br />Some reviewers have complained that it takes too long for Larsson to tell us what happened. And, true, it is well past the half-way point of this lengthy tale before we even know the nature of the crime involved (Then again, we do have a good idea, thanks to an idiotic blurb on the back cover from USA Today that tells us more than we need to know by comparing the story to an infamous thriller that I won't name). But for me, the charm of the story is in how the mystery slowly unwinds and in Larsson's ability to make us feel like we're participating in the investigation right along with Blomkvist and the sidekick who joins him - a tattooed social misfit who has some very handy computer skills. Yes, Larsson is methodical in providing the smallest details - how many sandwiches Blomkvist eats, whether the sandwich is liverwurst or roast beef, how many cups of coffee he drinks at 2 a.m. while doing his research, etc. Again, this wasn't a shortcoming for me - instead these details helped set the scene and involve me in the story. Stylistically, Larsson might not measure up to Graham Greene or Raymond Chandler, but he proves to be a tale-spinner extraordinaire.<br /><br />Patience is required, but the resolution of the mystery is satisfying and very dark, although I must admit I had to suspend my disbelief somewhat. And if the central mystery wasn't enough, the last 90 or so pages wrap up the side story involving our hero's attempt to exact revenge on the corrupt businessman who framed him at the start of the novel. This section is also incredibly detailed, and it was a bit exhausting to read-- almost too much after we find out the solution of the core mystery following 500 densely plotted pages. But it's here that Larsson gets to show his in-depth knowledge of the financial world, and some of his comments seem to predict the global financial meltdown that occurred four years after he wrote the book. His character Blomkvist (who probably shares a lot in common with Larsson) offers some scathing observations on the corporate world.<br /><br />I'm definitely on board for the final two installments of the trilogy. It's downright heartbreaking that Larsson passed away before he could enjoy the international success of these books, and sad too that we won't be able to read more stories from him after the third is released. I heard he planned to write a series of 10... that would have been something.d Chandler, but he proves to be a tale-spinner extraordinaire.

1439138311|5.0|Why is it that three Irish-born writers, the always excellent Colm Toibin, Colum McCann (Let The Great World Spin), and Joseph O'Neill (Netherland) are writing this generation's great books about New York City--multilayered, fascinating people, lyrical writing?  I don't have a glib answer, but it seems to be true.  Brooklyn is the gentlest of the three books, but Toibin sweeps you up in his own way, and you really care about the fate of this woman who must make a choice about life.  I am always in awe of this brilliant writer, and reading Brooklyn is a wonderful way to welcome him into your world.
B0000AM6K2|5.0|I read through some of the other negative reviews of this album and, quite frankly, became pretty puzzled. One review really slammed Josh for the lyrics, but they are just that ... lyrics. His art for you to enjoy. This disk, in particular, is fantastically enjoyable because it is light and entertaining. I have listened to the disk over and over and over again and it just keeps getting better. I highly recommend it. Try to enjoy it without feeling the need to decipher the lyrics and deconstruct the sentence structure - taking this route will just allow you to loosen up and relax the music (and life).

I am so happy I ordered this!! I never saw Childhood, They don't care about us, Stranger in Moscow and Blood on the dance floor until I viewed this and I am speechless!! Earth Song shows a strong message.  The whole cd has so much energy you can't sit still watching it!!  Michael was a special person! Such a great talent gone too soon!! I'm happy I grew up in the same era Michael grew up and remember what a great talent he is and always will be!! Thank You Michael!!
B00164KYV4|5.0|So I knew that I wanted to see this movie, but never got a chance to do so until it came out on DVD. I kind of knew what to expect, but at the same time I also didn't. After having seen it now, I'd have to say that it was a pretty good movie. I hesitate to say that it was one of the best movies I've ever seen because it didn't quite have that quality that I look for when I think of a movie as truly great. It was most definitely a lot different than some of those typical, run-of-the-mill romantic comedies. This was in my opinion one of the better if not the best romantic comedies that I've ever seen, and that's saying something. I'm not saying that I've seen every single Rom-Com out there, but I've seen my fair share of them. The movie called Definitely Maybe is pretty much the only other one that I consider to be a really good Rom-Com. Well, maybe not but it's the first one that comes to mind. I like it when a movie's plot isn't super complicated and you're trying to figure out what on earth is going on while still paying attention to the movie. This movie was very easy to follow. At first, I was going to say that one of the relationships that takes place in the movie seemed a bit much or something like that, but as I continued to write my review, I realized that it kind of drove the point home a little more by having that relationship there in the movie. Basically, if you're in the mood for an entertaining movie that is less likely to make you feel like checking your watch or a clock halfway through, then this might be a good option for you to choose.
B0028T6XXY|4.0|What there was of it was good. But why not put the whole concert on? I did like the presentation of Michael singing without the mic at the end of the show, the several times I've seen him in concert that is the most amazing part to me.
B00003CX9S|5.0|The message of this movie is the beautiful human spirit and soul that is inside John Merrick who has been displayed in side shows as The Elephant Man.  His condition, neurofibromatosis is progressive and is characterized by the growth of hard, fibrous nodules over portions of the epidermis.  They may later spread into underlying structures and interfere with other bodily processes, hindering breathing, speaking, hearing and motility of the effected parts.  It is usually not a symetrical abberation, adding to its grotesqueness, and causing imbalance.  Of course if it appears on the face it becomes quite disfiguring and startling to observers caught off guard.  In Victorian England, where John was exploited and knowledge of medicine was not in its present state, a mystery and apprehension surrounded it.  This horrible life he had to live, being feared, gawked at, examined were unbearable, but throughout the horror of his life, he was able to remain a pure and beautiful soul.  The acting by John Hurt (Merrick) is phenomonal, Anthony Hopkins is brilliant as the doctor who finally provides a kind of friendship with him, and offers him some hope of having a beneficial life, if only for the sake of science.  Who would make a lovely black and white movie about a bizarrely sad life such as this?.  It would be David Lynch, of course.  To view it is to break your heart.
B000FVBLEI|5.0|I haven't much to say, but I love this album. I'm not a big fan of melodic singing in metal, but All That Remains definitely hit the mark with this album. Please, oh Goodness Gracious, PLEASE, come back to this (or This Darkened Heart's) sound in your future albums! the Overcome one had too much melodic vocals, and I wasn't as impressed (sorry guys, I'm super drunk right now). Either way, I definitely love this album! PEACE!
B001GM28HO|5.0|Love it .. bought this for my 11yr old daughter's pre-teen birthday party .. (Had heard Lady Gaga on the radio .. liked it myself!)  Brilliant.
B000268QB2|5.0|I first heard Keane on the HDNet concert from Chicago. I heard it last year and just thought, holy smokes what a refreshing and wonderful sound. Some people compare them to Coldplay. In my humble opinion Keane are far superior. This album is great from the first song to the last. I never get tired of listening to it. What honestly great songs these really are. Under the Iron Sea their follow up is just as good. Unfortunately, the same can not be said of Perfect symmetery. But, take the first two cd's and treasure them. They are truly wonderful.

0316017922|5.0|This book might appear obvious and even questionable to many people, but it contains several reminders and eye-openers that all of us often keep forgetting every day: true success and notoriety are for few - the environment, time and cultural heritage which one was born and raised are, putting them all together with hard work, persistence and a certain level of intelligence, decisive factors which set one individual or another apart from the others.<br /><br />If one takes the time to think about the core message, it will certainly draw the conclusion that it all makes perfect sense. The world is full of intelligent, brilliant and hard working people and only if there were enough chances for each and everyone of them to show and develop the correct abilities at the right place, by the right time and to the right people, chances are that he/she might become an outlier on his/her field of expertise. The point is that nobody chooses whether or not to be an outlier, it just happens.<br /><br />The author points meaningful considerations about the how the educational system and other purely cultural aspects may affect the ability of an individual or a group of them to develop hard work and constant practicing, which is absolutely relevant for creating the conditions for more and more people to be a potential \\"Outlier\\". And here is where the book starts to function as a provider of a powerful message, rather than a simple shortened biography of some outstanding people - you don't have to be an outlier, but you can be somebody which can make the whole difference.<br /><br />Good book, entertaining and inspiring from start to finish.
B002BI4Y06|5.0|Before you write a review for this CD, You have to watch the blu-ray! What they did has never been done before. Get the blu-ray or DVD and then download these same songs on Rock Band 2!
B000UX6THK|5.0|Fantastic show.  It's a shame Lynch lost interest towards the end, although I can't help but sympathize.  Fortunately, he kept making movies!
B00005MP58|3.0|Undoubtedly, the show is 5-star, as evidenced by the accolades heaped upon by viewers.  My rating is for the poor quality of the DVDs.  There are many bright white flashes in between scenes (on both discs) and it's rather annoying.  I can't imagine that a show this recent is in analog format so there is no excuse for the poor quality of the DVDs.  I hope the Blu Ray discs are of better quality.
B001JDS7CU|4.0|My family really enjoys all the DVD's of Planet Earth.  We have spent hours learning and re-learning about the earth... and the beauty of Bluray really takes watching this to another level.  It's entirely worth the money.
0307341569|4.0|As a fan of mystery and crime novels, I found Gillian Flynn's [[ASIN:0307341569 Dark Places: A Novel]] to be a compelling page-turner that, even as it trotted out one unlikable character after another and strained to impress its sense of utter despair upon me, hooked me on its central \\"whodunit?\\" question and consistently kept me wanting to solve the mystery to the very end.     The novel centers around the character of Libby Day, a thirtysomething woman who, at the age of seven, had survived the brutal massacre of her mother and two older sisters on their Kansas farm. Libby's testimony in the aftermath of the murders helped to put her older brother, Ben, behind bars for life for the crime, and she spends the next twenty-five years trying not to think about the incident, while simultaneously being unable to ever move past it. All of that changes, though, when Libby is contacted by a group of people who are convinced that Ben is innocent, and the story follows Libby's journey as she confronts the ghosts of her past to reveal the truth of what happened on that awful night.     The story uses an interesting narrative structure, as the point-of-view alternates between Libby in the present day and the various members of her family on the day leading up to the murders. As Libby delves deeper into her investigation, the author gradually unveils the parallel story of the murders themselves, culminating in a climax to each storyline that brings everything to a satisfying conclusion.    While the plot itself is strong, my enthusiasm was tempered a bit by the largely unlikable cast of characters. Libby, as well as just about everyone she meets along her journey, and in addition to the majority of the characters from the storyline of her family's past, is a human train wreck, even considering the circumstances of her life. Most of the rest of the cast of characters is equally pathetic, at times almost comically so, which can make the book seem as though it is depressing just for the sake of being depressing.     These are minor annoyances, though, as the central mystery is strong enough to make up for the overbearing characterizations. The only other small complaint I had was that the circumstances surrounding the night of the murders seem to involve an incredible number of extreme coincidences, but not enough to overshadow the overall story. To anyone who enjoys a good mystery yarn, I highly recommend [[ASIN:0307341569 Dark Places: A Novel]].
B00284BMBM|5.0|It took a high level of justified self-confidence for Daughtry to follow their blockbuster debut album with one that gives a nod to its predecessor while at the same time going above and beyond it with risk-taking.  The criticisms \\"it sounds like the first album\\" and \\"it sounds like Nickelback\\" are tired cliches.  A band is going to sound like itself -- which in the case of multi-platinum-selling Daughtry is a good thing.  Saying they sound like Nickelback is a lazy person's way of trying to make it look like they know something about rock music.  The reply to that irrelevant stab is, \\"So what?\\"  Ironically, it's much more of a compliment than a put-down.   I dare anybody to listen to No Surprise three times and not be humming it the next day.  If you want hard rock, listen to You Don't Belong.  For country, go with Tennessee Line featuring Vince Gill.  If Christian music is your thing, give a listen to Open Up Your Eyes, with its life-ever-after theme.  There is not a song on Leave This Town that doesn't have a singable chorus and a hummable hook.  If you like to think of yourself as a rebel, and you're not comfortable liking what 5 million other people like, give it a shot.  Sometimes the mainstream is cool.
0441017177|5.0|Some of the best science fiction works I have read have come from former engineers, physicists or scientist that have become science fiction authors and fully understand the technology they are creating. They provide a framework of believability that makes the story much more interesting to read.    Reynold's has truly produced a great piece of work that can only be compared to one other great science fiction author, Arthur C. Clark. Both writers have different writing styles, but in the end they know how to engineer a masterpiece that keeps on climaxing throughout the book. I rarely ever write a review, simply because I don't know if I can provide feedback that might be useful to other readers.  Since I use the feedback myself, I thought I should give back.    After looking at my bookshelf, which is now full, which is why I read on a Kindle these days, I notice that I have read science fiction authors like Clark, Niven, Card, Asimov, Hamilton, Baxter, Adams, Reynolds, etc. So when I say this is one of the best pieces of work I have read in a long time, you understand what I am comparing it to.    This book needs no sequel and ends as goods as it begins. Thanks for the great work.
B001TN1EBG|5.0|In \\"The Sparrow and the Crow,\\" William Fitzsimmons weaves intricate guitar work, occasional piano, and soft spoken, pure vocals together to tell the melancholy story of a relationship that did not make it.  The album is quietly beautiful, driven by very real emotions, strong musicianship, and heartfelt lyrics.  Do not miss out on William Fitzsimmons' \\"The Sparrow and the Crow.\\"
0743297334|5.0|I know that I should have read this book again, before I made my final decision of 5 stars. But, Hemingway's writimg style and language are just so perfect. I love how Hemingway's writing is blunt, and so to the point. It's like he writes directly from trhe heart, without thinking too much. Like oh this sound good, or no, this sounds better. He just states his thoughts on love and on life.    I remember a documentary I saw on Hemingway; about having his heart broken by a women he met during his own service during war. Don't know if a majority of readers are already aware of this. So, as I continued reading the book I kept sensing connections between Cohn and jake, to Hemingway. I think both characters contained certain traits which related to Hemingway's own personal characteristics. I think Hemingway wished he could have been more like Jake in instances of his own life. How Jake was very strong and in control of his emotions, and his resistance to falling absolutly in love with Lady Ashley. Cohn on the other hand makes a complete fool of himself by going head over heels for Lady Ashley. Love showed how weak Cohn is, and how strong, and cool Jake was. Maybe Hemingway's wished he could been more able to be like Jake, and therefore impervious to ever becoming heart-broken. Good read, there's a lot more I want to talk about, but better read it again before I start making anymore conclusions. Great read for anyone!
B001QOOCTE|4.0|When I played the CD, I was deeply touched by the music. It grabbed at me and wouldn't let me go until I had played each song several times. However, when I finally played the DVD some weeks later, I was floored by the way the makers of this music wove themselves together from so many different cultures and musical traditions. Don't wait to watch the DVD, even if you have to go over to a friend's house to arrange a viewing. If you love music and especially if you love music-making, you will find yourself deeply touched by the DVD's elegant simplicity. I have played on the streets of New Orleans, Seattle, France and Belgium, etc. Watching the DVD, I recognized a special breed of musician -- hearty souls who love and live their lives for music, come what may. Their many lifetimes of whole-hearted dedication to music shines through every note.
B00284BMBM|1.0|If I was describing what bland, boring, repetitive noise was, I'd have to put a picture of this album and this faux band.  There's nothing, NOTHING original, interesting or even semi-creative about this piece of crap album.  More Nickleback copy-cat stuff.  Most of the reviews of this have been awful and rightly so.    SAVE YOUR MONEY, music fans, and look for something from some really great talented rock artists.  These posers aren't it.
B000002KHI|4.0|I remember this as my first and only Sabbath Album, Not growing up back then but now, and Finding this tape in a record store, which I since sadly have lost! Thought it was and is a Good Contribution to Rock N Roll before  all the Horrible Rock and Horrible Music came on the scene and before Ozzy turned into a goof and a sellout. Favorite track Paranoid and Iron Man, The Boys from Birmingham were not the Best but were sure good at it. Nothing like the Original.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|This is one of those games that takes awhile to explain the first time around, but once you go over the rules the play of the game feels natural and flows easily. The game is great for people who have not played that many complicated board games before involving resource management, risk management, building, trading and has a variable board which allows for different game experiences.<br /><br />I have found that four players gets to be a crowded game and can take a long time to finish, with a three player game it tends to take between 45 mins and an hour.<br /><br />Its a classic game that I constantly enjoy playing.
B000JQUZCI|5.0|I always avoided reading this book because it was one of those often assigned in high school - while I enjoyed some of the books we read, I am still scarred from the Red Badge of Courage and Tess of the D'Ubervilles. When I saw Frankenstein available free on the Kindle, I figured I may as well suck it up and give it a shot. I loved it! I found it a fairly quick read, though that may be because I couldn't put it down. I apologize to high school English teachers everywhere - I will have more trust in the future!
B002BIULQ2|5.0|I Saw this movie in May And I knew It was going to be good Because I love the Show. It was actually better than I expected.

B001QOOCTE|5.0|I just bought 3 copies of CD/DVD Songs around the world.  This is too good to keep to myself so I will give copies to friends. An absolute inspiration.  Thank you to producers and performers.
0307341550|3.0|As many people, I picked this book up because Stephen King had a wonderfully good quote on the cover recommending it. And I actually agree with his quote, it was nasty, with sharp writing, and the story stays in your head long after you finish it. It was a very decent story and quite unique. A troubled reporter returns to her hometown to investigate the murder of two preteen girls and, in doing so, has to confront her many issues with her equally troubled mother. It is a very interesting book and kept me very engaged, but it seemed to lack something, perhaps it was just too cold? I am really not sure, but as King said, it is nasty. I recently read on Flynn's website that the movie rights have been sold and she is currently working on the screenplay. It should be a pretty good movie. Also on her website is an essay to her reader explaining why she is writing about a typically left alone subject (nasty women), which was worth the read, I think. I definitely liked her second book, Dark Places, better than this, but it is still a worthwhile read, and overall I would recommend it to most horror-, thriller-lover fans, especially those looking for something different. If you are just into mild murder mysteries, this may not be the book for you.
B0013NS6EU|3.0|The content of the book itself is pretty great. However, it does not seem to be truly optimized for the Kindle DX, as advertised, as many diagrams are too small and of too low resolution to be read clearly, which greatly detracts from the experience. Even if you zoom in to the image on the kindle, it looks blocky and small text is unreadable.<br /><br />So, 5 stars for the contest, minus two because it's not \\"DX optimized\\" as stated.
B0006A9FKA|3.0|The only real negatives are the pervasive coarse language - Brits must have much more tolerance for the f-word than Americans do, because you rarely got through a scene without a thick scattering of them - and some excessive gore. But, well, it is a R rated zombie flick.<br /><br />And it does a wonderful sendup of the genre. No cliche is left unmolested. You really do end up laughing at most of the scenes. Some of the humor is clever and most of it is ironic. Respect the R rating for what it represents and you'll probably have a good laugh.<br /><br />The ending TV snippets are much funnier than they should be.
B0013FXWU6|2.0|I wanted to like this movie. It was filmed in Texas. It was hyped in Texas. Alas they set in California. Why not Texas? Must have been the Sinclair book. This movie has some awesome things. Some of the exterior shots are great. Daniel Day Lewis is a good actor. He has some good scenes in the movie. I liked the movie' score. Incredible music, but a little too huge at times. So why doesn't this movie work? Too long, story too slow, not sure, but it doesn't work. Maybe the plot is covered up in music, oil fires and some long boring scenes. It just did not get to three out of five. PS I got it on netfix, but saw the cardboard that some have been moaning about. Cardboard has been used for years on CDs and it works fine.
B001FOR5XU|5.0|First of all, let me say that I Am Legend is a true classic and when looked at in the context that it was written in 1954, it is an amazing work.  But when you read the book in 2009 and have already seen the Will Smith movie, it is not quite what you expect.  The book is very short, only 160 pages or so.  Also, the story is very different from the movie.  Not saying that either one is better, but they are just very different.  I would say that reading the book is definitely worthwhile because it is so different.  Say what you want about I Am Legend, but it was certainly a groundbreaking book.
B001UJ6IJC|4.0|This is a great production.  The voice acting is solid enough and keeps you in the story.  I was really and truley pleased with the production untill I realized that it was missing about half the book.  They clearly picked the most stories that coverd the most ground - but calling this \\"unabridged\\" is in no was accurate.  The stories that were told were, for the most part, left alone but so much of what was cut was refered to in what was left in - I like those stories: the decimations in russia, the K-9 retirment home, the houses on stilts, the reporter on the aircraft carrier at the political summet.  So much of the fine detail is missing.  I gave it 4 stars because they did not finish their work.  what they did was great, but where is the rest.
B001Q8PC8A|4.0|A mate bought this movie around last night. I watched it without knowing anything about it.<br />I liked it a lot. Scirpt was tight, Very nice Editing-Smooth moves whilst all the clues were presented without knowing on first watch.<br />Al Pacino Particularly shines. 30 years of repiticious police work for the NYPD shows through.<br />It's worth a second look which for me means its Good, DeNiro was Deniro but his character does change, in a clever way.
0756405890|2.0|I had complicated feelings about this book. On one hand, I loved Patrick Rothfuss's writing style and the way he set up the world. He managed to keep me engaged throughout the book, the settings were detailed, Sympathy was incredibly clever, the University was cool--the set-up was just fantastic. The idea was intriguing, as well; I haven't read many, if any, books with this premise. The whole idea is that Kvothe is already a legend, and is recording his story.    However, the main character got in the way.    I found Kvothe to be unrelatable and irritating. I don't want to give too much away, but I didn't feel anything for him during any of his hardships. The whole book is just a platform for Mr. Rothfuss to proclaim how amazing his protagonist is. At one point, Kvothe's first mentor tells Kvothe's parents that their son will excel at anything he does, and become the greatest whatever the world has ever seen. Kvothe has no flaws--he's a genius, he's the most talented musician anyone has ever seen, he rescues people, he makes friends, he's the 'plucky underdog' who stands up the mean, rich bully--he's annoying! True, there are books where you're supposed to dislike the main character, but this isn't one of them. I'm supposed to like him, but he's too convinced of his own superiority.      I also disliked Kvothe's girlfriend. She changes her name often, but Kvothe calls her Denna. She's basically a female Kvothe, which explains why they get on so well. However, where Kvothe is learning Sympathy, Denna is essentially a gold-digger. But it's all good, because she's beautiful and life is hard for attractive, single women! I sort of understand what Mr. Rothfuss is trying to explain when another character gives Kvothe this whole speech on why Denna acts like she does, but it just came off as \\"That's all attractive women can do!\\"     Actually, that was the thing I disliked about this world--women don't really show up. There are some people in Kvothe's troup at the beginning, there are a few women learning Sympathy, and there's Denna. I would be fine with what Denna does to survive if it had been handled better, but it wasn't. She's portrayed as bright, and women are allowed into the University--why doesn't she study and apply? She's apparently the only musician who can rival Kvothe--why doesn't she try to make a name for herself as a singer and get a patron? She's apparently a good actress--why not act? The justification for what she does is basically \\"she's hot and it's easy money.\\"     A lot of the minor characters were more enjoyable--Devon and Bast, especially, except for when they're sucking up to Kvothe. Interactions between the two of them are...interesting, to say the least. However, a lot of the minor characters simply provide a background that Kvothe can shine against. They're there to make him look good. In general, the teachers either love Kvothe or hate him. The ones who love him are intelligent, good people, while the ones who hate him are EEEEEEEEVIL pigs or idiots.     Master Elodin is one of the exceptions. He's totally mad, and is my favorite character in the book. Also, he convinced Kvothe to jump off a roof, which is reason enough to love him. The librarian, too, is likable. He catches Kvothe with a candle in a stack of old, rare books and bans him from the library. He's overprotective of his books, which I can totally relate to.    Overall, I would give this book 2 1/2 stars, but I'm rounding it down to two. While I did enjoy Mr. Rothfuss's writing style immensely, his characters need a major overhaul. I won't buy the next books, but if I could borrow them from a friend, I would read them, just to see if the characters get more likeable.    The reasons legends work is because the characters in them are legends. They don't need to be human; we don't expect them to be, we don't want them to be. Patrick Rothfuss tried to make a hero a person, and didn't quite get it right.
0307473465|4.0|This novel felt like three different novellas, tied together. This first, where a 15 year old has an affair with an older woman in Germany in the 30's, is quite good. Part 2, the Nazi war crime trial, is the least engaging. Part 3, the post-trial era, pulls together the first two parts, and I enjoyed that quite a bit. It is certainly the most emotional segment of the story. I heard the audio-book for this novel, and the reader was quite good and appropriate for this first person narrative. While I never quite felt as connected to the narrator as I would have liked, I enjoyed this original novel.
0689865384|5.0|I have to start saying that this is probably my favorite cover of all times. Really! I mean, you can guess by my blog that green is my favorite color, so that has to do with it. But also, I've always love half-face pictures, the tricky part is.. can you actually tell who it is from it? Not really, its hard! But anyway, I love the cover art. Way too much!!    The plot was terrific. This has been one of the best scenarios that an author has managed to stick in my head. The whole ugly-pretty thing, wow! What a concept! When I was not reading, I was thinking about the book, the world, the story, everything. That's the power of a great book. It was excruciatingly hard to stop reading. The characters are great, I love Shay.    Maybe at first it took a while to get me interested, but then I figured he has too much to explain. The way Westerfeld makes you look at the world today, is priceless. It has definitely been more than just a novel for me. It has a message of equality that screams out of the story. I had never read his books, but he just became one of my favorite authors.
B000UEWVVW|5.0|This is one of those rare novels that makes the reader increasingly anxious, sympathetic to the main character to the point of disbelieving all others, and in the end - oh, the end!  The pieces fall in place; the obfuscations and deceptions are suddenly revealed as though Lehane has ripped away a veil.  For a first read-through, I recommend not solving the cryptograms - the last couple are revealing enough to spoil the fun - but this is a book that demands to be reread almost immediately, so certainly work the codes out for yourself then.<br /><br />Shutter Island is an intelligent and satisfying suspense novel, with tightly controlled character development, realistic emotional scenes giving the plot momentum, and absolutely no wasted words.  I recommend it without reservation.
1439157383|4.0|Everyone has told me that I should read Jodi Picoult, and this was the first book of hers that I read. Going into it, I thought that it would be a teen book, but found it extremely well-written and very thought provoking. I ended up reading it in one day because I couldn't wait to see what happened! I have to admit that it was a bit of a tear-jerker!
0743455967|5.0|I am not a Stephen King aficionada. I am too much of a scaredy-cat to read horror. But. I write and I recognize that Mr. King probably knows a thing or two about writing. So I bought this book and I am pleased with my purchase. I am also pleased with the Kindle discount. The Kindle layout was very readable and I had a hard time putting it down. (I had to, though, with a nine month old.) Mr. King offers practical advice and inspired me to write more. He also shares vivid experiences from his own life that help his reader understand him better. I doubt you will be disappointed with this book.
B000WS4QJG|5.0|The Thriller Album is Michael Jackson's star making album. Especially if you're a child of the 80s. It was a mulitple grammy award winner when winning 1 grammy was a big deal.     The album holds up well. I recommend the 25th Anniversary edition, because I'm one of those persons who likes updated versions. But it isn;t necessary. The newer songs just don't add to the originals.     As for the DVD, it's a gem because it features that famous Motown performance. You know the one where he debuted the moonwalk.
B001H5U232|5.0|I was initially dubous about arrangements of existing Metheny tunes, but after hearing three tracks, I was thinking how I'd love to hear MORE arrangements by MANY OTHER arrangers because, frankly, Pat's compositions are intrinsically gorgeous and I can't get enough of them. I'd really like to hear how others will rearrange them in the future. Having them reinvented is a delight I'd never considered. I know and love virtually every PM tune ever composed, so this washes over me as a refreshing revelation. I can't stop playing it around the house.<br /><br />Since PM has always had a propensity toward singers who either sing in Spanish or unintelligible \\"chanting\\" it made perfect sense that a gorgeous female voice (in this case, Polish) would be the main melody throughout. There's something about a foreign language set to music because, after all, music IS the nebulous, beautiful language. They seem to go together well, to my thinking, and Metheny's music has always transported me to a better world: serene and perfect.
B001SGEUNI|5.0|I bought this album and thought not another pop singing female but the first song suprised me. it really sounded really hard and good for a woman singing rock. it's unheard of a good singer along with a good band. well this fits the bill nicely. Lizzy sounds really good, even better than most of the male singers in this generation. The band backs her up with all the hard rock sounds that still just rocks. caution: this isn't another evanescence or even paramore (the closest female singer to rock there was before this band). this is hard rock not another pop artist just trying to take your money without working for it.
B000A2RRF4|5.0|WHAT A VIDEO, AMAZING, EXTRAORDINALRY.  MICHAEL JACKSON  SHOWS IN THE VIDEO WHAT HE IS CALLED 'THE KING OF POP'.  HE WAS, IS AND WILL BE STILL THE GREATEST ENTERTAINMENT IN THE WORLD.

B001DHXT6G|3.0|A set if this size is obviously for someone who knows and loves the series.  As much as I like  the show and the chance to see some favorite episodes (for which I would give the series 5 stars), I think the packaging and labeling here is some of the worst I have ever seen. Each season comes in its own clear clunky plastic &quot;holder&quot; box and then the disks for the season are in a set of book-page like folders.  It would have been a whole lot easier to slip the disk boxes into simple paper or plastic sleeves and also would have taken up much less shelf space (about 1/3 less).<br /><br />A real annoyance for me is that there are no labels on the individual disks other than the tiny lettering in the ring of the disk that says &quot;Season 1, disk 1&quot; etc.  It would have been much more helpful to have printed the season/disk on the individual DVD.  The problem wouldn't be so bad if it were easy to figure out which episodes were on each disk. The way the disks are packaged, there is a set of plastic cards (one for each disk) and a set for each box you need to rummage through trying to figure out what actually is on the disks.<br /><br />The whole set could have been much more user- and eco-friendly if it had simply been packaged with a slip case and a well-labeled box for each season that (gasp!) listed the episodes for that season on the back of the box.  Better yet, geniuses who put this set together could probably have created a small booklet to put into the larger sleeve that would have listed episodes in order (perhaps with dates and a few lines of plot summary)and then added an appendix listing each episode by name and location on the set.  Even if the disks had NOT been better labeled, simple addition of a better printed guide instead of the dumb cards would have been much more helpful.<br /><br />A PS:  I can't resist saying that I really don't like  being able only to see the &quot;added in&quot; and cleaned up special effects.  Part of the charm of the original Star Trek was the sometimes cheesy (but usually impressive given time and budget) effects.  I think most DVD players have the option of switching angles , so I wonder why it wouldn't have been possible to have an option of watching original or enhanced scenes.he original Star Trek was the sometimes cheesy (but usually impressive given time and budget) effects.

I especially love the Jackson 5 songs--Michael looked like he was having a fun time during the show. My only complaint--I wish it was longer and had more songs--it's just that good. Man in the Mirror is absolutely beautiful and brought me to tears...I will treasure this DVD.  RIP Michael--You will live forever in our hearts and memories

B001PJRAUS|5.0|When I saw \\"Lost In Austen\\" as a preview on an another movie I had just purchased, I KNEW I had to buy it.  I bought it on a Sat afternoon, and by Monday I had watched the whole movie 4 times. That does not include the 5 or 6 times I've rewatched favorite scenes. I can't get enough of it.  Even though it's a 3 hour movie, it's so quick paced you don't notice. This movie gave me \\"Austenitis\\" I'm now pulling out all my Jane Austen books to reread.  Honestly, if you enjoy Jane Austen, and you have a great sense of humor, you will enjoy this movie.

0545123267|5.0|I was excited but nervous to read this one. There's so much buzz surrounding it and I didn't want to be let down. I shouldn't have been nervous-this book exceeded my expectations and I was drawn in to Sam and Grace's story.<br /><br />Shiver is paranormal romance at its best. This book did exactly what I want other paranormal romances to do (I'm looking at you Twilight). The story draws you in and will not let you go. You are engaged in the characters. You care about what happens and you're left breathless and have to keep turning the pages. This is a book that when I stopped reading, I had to come out of a reading fog because I would be so drawn into the story it took me a minute to remember where I was. This is one I'm already passing on to friends and talking up because I want to share it with everyone.<br /><br />Sam and Grace are both strong characters who are also flawed. They have numerous obstacles to overcome and life isn't sunshine and roses for either of them. I knew why Grace was attracted to Sam, and it wasn't just because he was a hot guy-he had depth. He was sweet and charming, but was also broken, which made him an interesting character.<br /><br />The chapters are told in alternating viewpoints, so you really get inside both Sam and Grace and learn who they really are. I thought this would be confusing, but after I read a few chapters I got used to it and it was easy to follow who was telling the story.<br /><br />Maggie Stiefvater's writing is very lyrical and poetic. The story isn't full of action, but that was ok. The story may move at a slower pace than other books, but the plot unfolds quickly. There are multiple layers to the story and that adds to the delight of the reader as you unravel the many stories that are wrapped up here. Yes, it's mainly Sam and Grace's story, but there are other stories and characters that I can't wait to read more about.<br /><br />There are some loose ends, but I think with the sequels we'll learn more about the wolves of Mercy Falls and Shiver stands on it's own very well. If any book is going to dethrone Twilight's reign and have adult appeal as well as teens, I think Shiver could do it. A beautifully told story that is a must-read for paranormal fans-add this one to the top of your reading pile!very well.

B000ZEE3I6|3.0|Agree with some earlier reviewers on too many important things being left out and other scenes that were added that never occurred in the book and did absolutely nothing for the story (Harry with waitress at beginning, burning the Burrow(!)).  While I've enjoyed the 5th movie a bit more with each viewing, and probably will for the 6th as well, I do not like this director's (same guy for the 5th and 6th movies and, unfortunately, for the remaining two films) handling of the story.  One more thing I haven't seen addressed, unless I missed it--the absolutely horrible music in the 5th and 6th movies by Nicholas Hooper (who most likely will also do the remaining two films)--completely unmemorable, bland, generic movie music, unlike the music of his two predecessors, John Williams and Patrick Doyle, who both contributed outstanding scores.  As a musician myself, I feel the score adds so much to the movie.  This guy missed the boat completely.  What a shame.
B001KVZ6F2|5.0|I'm a big Clint Eastwood fan, but even if you're not, Gran Torino is a very good movie. It has an excellent plot, great acting, and a realistic though bittersweet ending. It is an action movie, but also touching in that it explores growing old, changes in society, honor, standing up to the \\"bad guys\\", and overcoming prejudice (from all sides). This movie has a lot of cursing, but it is in context with the gang culture and times, and some of the violence may bother some, although it has no more than most R-rated action movies out there, and once again, it is in context to the plot. At times it is funny, at times disturbing, and at times touching, but it remains true to the context of the plot. Great movie!
