B007J4T2G8|5.0|I Would like to finish the book before I fully comment on it but I did enjoy it very much.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Love period shows. Everything is so well done, well acted. And all classes have their problems and issues. Such a great show to watch. Can't wait for season 4!
B006UG90RM|5.0|While it isn't the old familiar VH, it is nice to hear something new from them! Wolfgang does a remarkable job of filling in for Michael Anthony. I thought the band would be missing his background vocals and in some ways it does (those are some huge shoes to fill), Wolfgang impressed me. I watched one show for this tour and I regrettably have to say that David Lee Roth is actually terrible. :( I never thought those words would ever come out of my mouth. Now, I understand we all get old and time goes by, but he did almost nothing except shuffle his feet around. He even was up to his old antics and \\"Forgot the f-in words\\", his words not mine. He attempted a split kick once and a round house kick once and failed miserably at both, however, he did nothing to excite the crowd and has obviously lost a lot more than a step. As far as vocals go...well, they were okay but it's obvious that his 80's screams have taken their toll. So, back to the album! The studio stuff is okay the first play through, but then give it a listen two or three times even as background music while doing chores and you may even find yourself singing along, tapping your toes and maybe even dancing along. That's the sign of a good album at the very least! Alex Van Halen is an awesome drummer, he never says much in interviews but lets his drumming say it all and I'm glad he does. His brother says enough for both of them. Eddie is the usual amazing Eddie, if only he would take a cue from Alex and shut up!<br /><br />Song #1 Tattoo when I first heard it I was a little disappointed, but I let go of the original Van Halen and listened again and felt better about it. Now when I hear it, I can't help but get excited and feel the adrenaline pumping. Song #2 She's The Woman is the closest to the Van Halen we love! The bass, guitar and drums have their original sound! Awesome! David Lee even sounds Awesome, love the energy he give this song! Song #3 You And Your Blues is shows the bands awesome vocals in frontand back! Catchy Chorus and the bridge is perfect! Song #4 Chinatown is a ROCKIN' good time and my favorite of them all and I don't even know all the vocals but Wolfgang Hits everything with perfection! Song #5 Blood And Fire sounds a little thrown together a little strange and not smooth at all but after the intro things click. #6 Bullethead sounds to me like maybe this was Wolfy's idea? I don't even know what bullethead means or is referring to. My least favorite. Song #7 As Is, love the intro but shouldn't it have been called As If? Not sure but it's still decent. Song #8 Honeybabysweetiedoll isn't bad but the album dies off a bit in the middle and this song doesn't help. Song #9 The Trouble With Never is better than the last two, but still missing something. Background vocals are very good here too. Song #10 Outta Space. Well the jury is still out on this one. I don't hate it, but I don't love it either. Song #11 Stay Frosty, Great song. Reminds me of Ice Cream Man and I think that's on purpose. The chorus and bridge moves and flows perfect! Love IT! Rocks after a while and well worth the wait. Song #12 Big River, is bass driven and I'm sure Eddie wanted it that way. Good tune! Song #13 Beats Workin' I'm sure they know all about that but the song is only good. Alex and Eddie ebb and flow to perfection.<br /><br />In closing, I love the album and I am glad it's finally here. If they come around our area I will go see them because, lets face it...it's VAN HALEN! I hope they can keep it together long enough to put out 3 or 4 more albums before calling it quits.<br />Hope you enjoyed my first ever review. Let me know what you thing. Too long? Too boring?
B005PK57IK|3.0|This is a great series.  Season 1 and 2 are better, but the characters have me hooked.  Overall, the series is one of the best I've watched.  A series where plot and character showcase the writing and acting and don't depend on the shock value of sex and violence.
B00CDV6WDS|4.0|I needed something to keep my mind occupide<br />this seemed to fill the bill. it is easy to follow the indtructions
B008OM0EDO|5.0|Sacha has done it again, he as  given me a belly ache from watching this stupendously hilarious flick. He deserves 5 fatwas to be carried out by being  hung by his nipples, dipped in hot boiling oil and quartered using a rusty saw, whilst he watches his mother abused by a pack of rabid hyenas. Best comedy I have seen in a long time.
B0067R0APK|3.0|while it seems to provide a good take on the weather, it is hard to use and to find what the weather really is.
B00BETX5PS|5.0|Relative to the other Bond films, I would definitely rate this one being one of the very best. This latest 007 entry is now a more evolved and sophisticated story line. It was very interesting to see both Bond's and the villain's  nitty- gritty, warts and all psychological state, adding more intrigue to an already fascinating Bond level of action
B008VBYN80|4.0|as good as clash of clans. fast paced once you get the hang of it. def worth giving it a try.
B00881VLCE|4.0|This app is fun but challenging.  It really needs to have a few more instructions on how to use it , but maybe when I figure out a few of the obstacles I will enjoy it better.
B00BESM14U|5.0|No one, and I mean no one in this day and age can touch ANYTHING John Hughes did in the 80's.  That being said this movie is the granddaughter of John Hughes vision of teenagers.  I don't care how you were in high school, everyone had a goofy, geeky, nerdy, shy down moment at one time.  This movie shows it and shows the strength of owning it.  I don't care how many people you have on facebook or twitter, the golden rule of life is.  &#34;You can alway count your TRUE friends on one hand.... maybe two.&#34; The soundtrack is a perfect match for the movie.  The SMITHS  is always about being a wallflower.  NEW ORDER helps you dance you blues away.  Enjoy this movie, and remember what it was like to be...............simple.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This game is fun and a little challenging, but it really needs to have a little more explanation on how to play.  I am sure that once I get the hang of it I will enjoy it much more.
B00COHAUD4|5.0|Okay as you all know I don't do spoilers.  That is for the weak minded.  What I will tell you is.  HELL YEAH watch this movie.  This movie was soooooooooooo creative and will make you jump and get nervous when you go to bed.  Any shadow you do see.... you will have a flashback to this movie and you will have a small panic attack.  Enjoy this movie with friends.  Enjoy this movie with a good cocktail or beer.  I dare you to say Mama while looking in a mirror after you watch this.... if you do, look around and see what shows up.  Try not to scream out.
038572179X|1.0|This is my first book by this author.  From the outset one feels some slight pressure to like this novel because of all the blurbs announcing it as a work of genius and one of the greatest books ever written, etc.  But isn't that the age we live in - all hype and say anything to sell product?  This is a dull, plodding book.  The author is capable of intricate and at times even pretty turns of phrase, but the texture is all one; each long sentence begins with the same timber and temperature and, usually several lines later, ends where it began.  That is what is finally so wearying - the dense, relentlessly uniform texture of the whole fabric.  Instead of a tapestry it is a bolt of corduroy.  Each chair, wall, and sunbeam, meticulously described, attain the same level of importance until, after endless iterations, one realizes that none of it is important.  It is all filler, creative writing, poetic prose, call it what you like.  Apparently there are many readers who go in for this sort of thing.  I am not one of them.<br />BTW, if you're looking for an interesting contemporary British novelist, try Beryl Bainbridge if you haven't already.  She is recently dead but her pages are very much alive.
B001EYK54W|3.0|Kinda slow compared to the remake from the '90s, showing its age.  Acting was OK, but lacked the tension of the remake.
014241543X|3.0|I've heard great things about this book so I wanted to check it out. I have to say I'm not a huge fan of the way the book keeps switching back and forth between past and present - while I do understand the reasoning for it.
B001FVV2X2|5.0|I live this show can't believe it's not running. Thank goodness for amazon. I get to catch up on all the episodes
B005LLSZNM|5.0|Really like the characters...has you routing for the bad guys and the suspense is really captivating.  Definitely great escapism.  5 stars.
B009ZZDNT6|2.0|The volume is very low. I don't think it will wake me. I don't know if I will keep it.
B0064MPXFA|4.0|But the show is really good until they get their lib on.  Sad. Hilary is pictured with one of the lead characters...Socialist Hilary.
B003Z0BWRM|5.0|This is a book where you can truly escape into another world that is the mortal instruments. There is never a dull moment and is always so hard to put down!
B002DOSBMK|5.0|i really hate writing reviews and that amazon makes me write words in order to start something so I'm just filling it in with this.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I downloaded this game last night and have been having a blast playing it. What I really like about it is you don't have to worry about running out of energy unlike some games but this game will drain your tablet's battery pretty quick. I guess that's due to all the graphics but I don't think it's a big issue. The graphics are colorful and the characters are very cute. I rate it 5 stars and would suggest it for anyone :)
B005LCYR7Y|4.0|Time travel is one of my favorite plot devices and I think it is really intriguing that this book takes a real life world changing event and fictionally tries to change the outcome via time travel.  Stephen King is the master of horror, but this is not a horror tale in the true sense, although there are some malevolent forces apparently at work here. It is a very complicated action, political thriller, science fiction, and romance novel. I admit I had a little trouble keeping track of some of the characters and sometimes had to pause to reflect on exactly who they were when they were mentioned again later in the book.<br /><br />It raises a lot of good points about the butterfly effect (also known as the ripple effect) of time travel and how we really just don't know the far-reaching consequences that each and every tiny detail of our daily lives can have.<br /><br />You can read more of this review (and others) at abshepherd dot net.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is awesome! I got stuck on level 10. PLEASE download it now. Have you played clue? IT IS JUST LIKE CLUE!!
B003ODIZL6|4.0|It was good it told me all of the things I wanted to know the meaning of however there was some words that I wanted to know but it did not find it. Overall though it was good. Lol
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It is a very fun fast paced game, based of the hilarious Despicable Me movie. This game does require quick reflexes and fast thinking, but overall a great game
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|All the books of this series were spell-binding. A very tough book to put down with twists and turns at every corner.
B00004ZB9D|5.0|I bought this CD so that I could load the hits on to my MP3 player in uncompressed form (i.e. as .flac files).
1451696191|5.0|I'm writing this review so, amazon can leave me alone. I thought it was a good book. the book has a fascinating perspective on teenagers suffering mental disease and trauma.
B0007P0LO8|5.0|Mirellia Freni and Placido Domingo were definitely at the top of their singing game for this filmed version of the opera. The singing was excellent. Their voices were very emotive and shimmered - never strident  and no straining for high notes. The Vienna Philharmonic under Herbert von Karajan played beautifully - very much an ensemble and with no weird tempi. Many have given this filmed version of the opera a poor rating because they felt something about the sets, staging and/or acting wasn't authentic or good enough. Don't let this stop you from buying this DVD. The sets, staging and acting were just fine. I however, don't give too much importance to these as long as they are not done poorly. It is my opinion that opera was created mainly as a form of music and thus depicts/expresses the human experience on an emotional level through sound. Thus, it would never be able to depict the human experience authentically on just a visual level no matter how great the sets, staging and acting are. That is why the performers have to sing and play well. If you want to see human experiences depicted fairly realistically on a visual level, watch a film or attend a theatre performance - and even those two don't always do it well.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I never really leave reviews but this is a great game to past the time and its very addictive. DOWNLOAD NOW!
5551369242|5.0|While these stories are available individually, I encourage you to purchase this collection. It includes Rage, The Long Walk, Roadwork, & The Running Man. All of these were published under Stephen King's alter ego, Richard Bachman. They remain some of his best work. Rage reminds me of the Columbine Massacre. In fact, King wanted it to be out of print long ago. The Long Walk is one of the best stories I have ever read. It is about a marathon that decides the winner by who walks the furthest. Everyone else is shot dead. Roadwork is an interesting tale of revenge. The Running Man is different from the excellent movie with Arnold Schwarzenegger but is very compelling as well.<br /><br />If you haven't read these wonderful stories then I envy your first reading experience. Buy this book. It went out of print long ago but is well worth the money to get a used copy.
B00C7LB20C|3.0|I do wish we could rate with half stars.  On my scale, 3 stars means a movie is a must rent on home video, and might possibly be worth buying.  This is an overall entertaining spy thriller in the tradition of the Bourne films, just not nearly as good.  It slows down a bit too much in the middle, and the actors are far from Hollywood's A list.<br /><br />Still, if you're in the mood for a decent flick, this one will entertain.  But if you never get around to it, you're not missing too much.  I rate it two and a half starts.<br /><br />*  = This movie is bad.  You'll have more fun getting a root canal.<br />**  = This movie is passable.  If you're bored, you might find it somewhat entertaining.<br />***  = This is a solid movie, definitely worth renting, possibly worth buying.<br />****  = This is a must see on the big screen and a must own on home video.<br />***** = This is one of the greatest films of all time, a serious contender for Best Picture.
B00DU73T08|5.0|Great movie and production! I highly recommend it! I was kinda skeptical about at first but man it was a great movie!
B007TNS6JI|4.0|I really like this type of game, especially for break time boredom. I think more games like this should be made into console games, personally.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I've read this book about three times and I absolutely LOVE it. Katniss is a wonderful down to earth, flawed heroine who doesn't view herself as anything more than a person who's gotten very good at survival. Highly recommend the entire series.
B001VLXNLU|5.0|Five stars is what it deserves I can't think of anything less then that the book simply did not just tell you what was going on it showed you I can't till I read the next one
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|If you've ever wondered what goes on in the video game world, here it is!  Sweet, inspirational and creative.  Good movie.  yes yes.  We will probably buy this one.
B00CLZ4B4I|4.0|This is a good movie over all. James Franco did a good job in it. Worth seeing if you are a fan of the wizard of oz.
B00DHNBPA6|3.0|If you do a remake, please try to hold my attention.  After an hour had passed, I really lost interest in how it all ended.
B004XZ99LO|3.0|My third Cirque DVD and OK so far in 2D since I dont have 3D player and TV. Story and production less spectacular as Worlds Away (also on 2D) but impressive in the usual Cirque artistry.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Update 08/16/2013<br />Okay - now I have this on 2 TVs and a Projector.  These are the two key points I wanted to know about when I bought the product:<br /><br />* Why a power cord?  With my TVs, I don't need to plug the power cord into a wall outlet... this was confusing me, why they had this.  BUT, I finally realized the \\"big deal\\" - if my TV is off, I just go to my content on my phone, tablet, or Chromebook Pixel (the computer google pays you to buy, get it, it's awesome), and then I click the button to start a \\"cast\\" on whatever app/webpage, and my TVs turn on automatically, turn to the right input, and everything is done.  It is truly amazing to me... no more remote.  I'm kicking myself that I just bought a $300 Logitech remote... which is now completely, 100% obsolete.  Replaced by a $35 thingy for my TV.<br /><br />* Simple, simple, simple... I was going to film it, but it goes like this: doorman gave me the package, I had the chromecast out of the box by the time I got up the elevator and walked in my front door, then I plugged it into the back of the TV, connected the power cord, turned it on, ran the chromecast app on my Nexus 7 tablet (which I love as well, and I'm a former Apple fanboy... hard-core Apple fanboy dating back to 1983, that's how hard-core, and I could care less about Apple now), and it was working.  The entire process, including the opening of the amazon box and packaging, took less than three minutes.<br /><br />* Bonus: content is great... LOVE how you can be using your phone/computer/tablet as a controller, and even walk away, close the app, etc and it still continues to broadcast the content for the person who's still in your house... in my case, my boyfriend, who can then continue on with his iphone (I'll get him to change... his screen is cracked and delicate-as-an-egg glass back is all shattered, whomever designed that iphone sure wasn't thinking about usability when it came to the physical design!).<br /><br />* I'm really hoping future TVs will just be \\"monitors\\", no built-in tuners or wi-fi or anything.  Even with the limited apps on chromecast, I'm 100% planning on getting rid of cable tv in the next few months... $158/mo for 5 TVs to have cable TV with showtime and HBO is foolish... and embarrassing.  For that price, I could take two trips to hawaii each year...<br /><br />Original Review<br />This is the best device I've seen yet... watch the looooong 3-part 75 minute long demo of this product, and you'll start to get it... for most stuff, it sends an instruction to get the content from the cloud, not from your phone, so it's not draining your battery as much...<br /><br />Google Play Music at $9.99/mo is the best thing yet too... combines your library, pandora-like radio stations based on anything you type in, and spotify-like music on demand... you'll never buy music again.... the Chromecast works for this too.<br /><br />Now, what I want to see is TVs that come out without any tuners, without any built-in apps or wifi, just an HDMI port with this... because I bet it'd really help drop the prices of TVs...<br /><br />And finally... the best thing this is for, at least to me... is PROJECTORS... I have a projector connected to a Sony 3D Blu-Ray connected to Netflix, Hulu, Vudu, etc., etc... this will allow me to get rid of that extra piece of equipment.<br /><br />I'm sure they'll have hulu, vudu, etc. soon... and many, many more applications...<br /><br />I bought three.uture TVs will just be \\"monitors\\", no built-in tuners or wi-fi or anything.

B00004R95G|5.0|I think this is a wonderful family movie! The music is great, as is the acting. There are very funny moments in the way the story is depicted, as well as touching and moving times. I love the way the transitions take place, especially Joseph's entry into the auditorium! The kids who had the luck to be chosen to play parts in this film must have had a fabulous experience!
B004P8JPS6|3.0|Lee Child's keeps the action coming and not as predictable as it may appear an enjoyable read can't wait for the next adventure
B001ANSSDC|4.0|I appreciated how the author got into the characters' heads and let you know how/what they were thinking.  The only character I really didn't care much for was his father. Good read though. I would certainly recommend it.
0451219597|5.0|I picked up a copy of this book at a library sale.  I had never heard of it, but I was a longtime fan of \\"The Eye of the Needle\\" and \\"The Key to Rebecca.\\"  For years, I had purchased novels by Alan Furst, because he is supposed to do WWII spy novels so well, but this novel by Follett is so good with character, situation, and suspense, he makes Furst look like an amateur by comparison.  So many small items of daily life in Occupied France are blended into the narrative.  I recommend this novel to anyone who enjoyed Follett's earlier WWII novels and has not been so pleased with the very ambitious trilogy he is currently publishing, bit by bit.
B00AHHODH2|5.0|At first pass, the neighborhood of Gordonston, only a stone's throw from Savannah, Georgia, seems like the perfect place to live.  Lovely old homes, nice yards, and a park in the center for running the dogs and passing the day-what an idyllic setting.<br /><br />But while the dogs play together at one end, the Gordonston Ladies' Dog-Walking Club (total members: three) catfight at the other, hissing and spitting behind their genteel Southern manners.  Replace the park with a shark tank, and you wouldn't be far from the truth.<br /><br />Behind the well-constructed façades of the good neighbors of Gordonston lie sinister thoughts and devious plans.  I won't go into any of them here; suffice it to say that almost every inhabitant of Gordonston is in danger of losing his or her life-at the financial hand of those they trust the most.  There are those who have the motive and the financial means to get rid of those who stand in the way of their ambitions.  The question is-who will survive who?<br /><br />This is by far the most intriguing murder mystery I have ever read.  Instead of a \\"whodunit\\", it's more like a \\"who's gonna get it, and why\\".  Mr. Whitehead weaves a tale as intricate as a spider's web-and ten times more captivating.  Twists and trysts, turns and red herrings, are sprinkled throughout the story.  Characters come to life under his crafting, and they are all very real-and very unforgettable.<br /><br />But what will really be worth the wait for the reader is the unveiling of the hired killer-and even more so, of the one who hired this assassin.  The reader is kept guessing until the very end.  And that, my friends, is what makes a good murder mystery.
0805047905|5.0|This was the first book I bought for my little one when I was still pregnant. Eric Carle is a staple in the world of children's books. I remember growing up reading them, and I want my kiddo to do the same :)
B004LE7PCM|5.0|The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes is very interesting including every story by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. This was a truly amazing book. A Study in Scarlett being the best and most interesting part.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Great first season.  Even when the writers have to spend the first few episodes focusing on character-development, the episodes still fly by.  It helps that there is an overarching plot that we can follow, so it's not just a show where each episode is independent from the others.
0761172726|5.0|Second year that we use it. Great. Everybody loves that. Good overview, nice stickers. Funny pictures. Best. Best. Best. Best.
B005LAII8K|3.0|If I had it to do over, I would not have purchased this movie. They sold me on the marketing hype.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|Although I love his writing, I found myself laboring through this book. I absolutely loved his first two. Will still look forward to his next book.
B008G12ERC|5.0|This album has been playing in my car non stop for 2 months. It's one of Muse's best albums ever!
B003XVYLDU|3.0|My first Vonnegut book. I found this book barely readable but there were some funny and interesting parts. It's more like the writer showing off than giving the reader a gripping story.
1423136802|5.0|This book is awesome! I lost both my children to this great series! They can't get enough. When the two of them start their own book discussions unprompted by an adult... well enough said!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Great read!  I didn't think I would like it, but wanted to see what all the rave was about before the movie comes out.  I was pleased and will finish reading the trilogy.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Short, but good and intriguing. Definitely leaves you wanting to explore and solve more at the end. Fun while it lasts, looking forward to sequel.
1442474440|5.0|The illustrations are those I remember pouring over in my own childhood copy of the classic story, and I have ordered duplicates to give to my own grandchildren.  If you haven't re-read &#34;Treasure Island&#34; lately, I highly recommend it -- the story is still fresh and exciting, and this particular version is of high quality in the print, paper and binding in addition to the excellent Wyeth illustrations.
B001NLL93W|5.0|Great read, I love the entire series and, what the author has done is just spectacular!i love the sense if humor the most!
B0042UEU8M|4.0|Magical, pulls on your Heart Strings... I found myself pulling for Charlie and the girl... You could tell they were Perfect for One another.
B001CZVVW8|3.0|If I hadn't known better, I would have thought that this opera was recorded in some sort of school lecture hall! Acoustics is far too dominant, lighting most unprofessional, stage set-up painfully dull.<br />Certainly Renée Fleming (Tatyana) has a beautiful voice, so have Dmitri Hvorostovsky (Onegin) and Ramón Vargas (Lensky). Elena Zaremba as Olga sings unfortunately as she suffers from constipation, though.<br />The periodic clothing is fine. (However, someone has put what looks like half of a grapefruit on poor Lensky's head. (The \\"fruit\\" falls fortunately off later). The night letter scene is great, thanks to dazzling singing and acting by Fleming. Also the orchestra performs fine with the experienced Valery Gergiev as conductor.<br /><br />Some reviewers claim that the simple stage set-up makes the viewer concentrate on the action and draws the viewer into the plot and the mood more easily. I presume those reviewers would settle for a VHS version of the opera, instead of high definition blu-ray disc.<br /><br />I can't in all honesty recommend this blu-ray, although this is not the fault of the singers or the orchestra. The stage director and the producer must take the blame entirely. I will approach future Met releases with great caution.<br />Of course this is not the first time that stage director Robert Carsen has ruined a fine opera and I doubt it will be the last...
B00CH26TL8|5.0|This game is very addictive! I can't seem to stop playing it on Facebook & now I have it on my Kindle. Fun fun fun
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Bringing all the loose ends together from the first two in the series was definitely a plus.  In fact, I could not stop reading until I had finished all three books.  The ending was not what I had expected; however, I was pleased that many of Christian's issues were resolved and that he and Anastasia appeared to be happy.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I highly recommend this fabulous drama.  It is well written.  I love the civility and class of the British!  Very refreshing from the normal sex and killing that dominates most of the American shows.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|The book was well written; however, the verb clamber was used way too often in all three books.  The book grabs your attention and keeps it.  The story line is very sensual and very moving. I enjoyed it and definitely had to read Book 3.
B008Y5UADK|1.0|this was in black and white and I do ok with that mostly but it was just a strange movie
B0034DGPEU|5.0|Kept my interest every moment.  Good character development.  Felt like I was there in the time and culture of the period.
B001UGB1X8|3.0|I like Tommy Lee Jones but this was not one of his best and I guess I was expecting this
B002PYW26O|4.0|My kids were watching the old series on ME TV and I remembered the movie so we watched it together.  It might not be the best movie for the original series fanatics but we really enjoyed this theatrical version of the Lost In Space series.  I found it to be much better viewing with my kids then when I first saw it by myself before I had kids.  They had all kinds of questions about the original series which I could not answer because I was a Star Trek fan in my youth.  I may be catching up on some old episodes myself now that my kids are interested.
B005LJITS0|5.0|They change the origin story, but if you just look at it as a stand alone movie its very good.
030758836X|5.0|Really good read, kept my attention for the entire book, would recommend it to anyone it has a little of everything.
B00CHI5B7A|2.0|Eye candy couldn't save it.  I got 45 minutes in, wandered off, and never came back.  That probably tells you all you need to know.
B00B7Y0206|5.0|It has. All my PLAYLISTS. You could download full albums of your favorite artists. Yesterday I found you could download movies,in fact for all fans of Electric Dreams that you can`t get anywhere I downloaded it , it's not the best quality and has Spanish subtitles It's great to see it again.
B0063IH60K|3.0|Nice version. Not the best I have ever played. But still pretty good. Lots of styles to choose from. Overall it remains a good way to pass a lot of time.
B0052RE4MQ|4.0|The book itself was great. In my opinion,the first book, Matched, was better. I do look forward to reading crossed inthe future.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Keeps my attention but not too hard. Able to complete each level so far without wanting to quit. each level gets a little harder and has more clues to find.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I love this app! Fun mini-games, good graphics. I like being able to interact with friends. I would definitely recommend it.
B002PEP4SC|4.0|I enjoyed reading this book very much. Just like the Castle Tv series, but much better. Once I started reading it I couldn't put it down. I wanted the book to be longer because it was so good.
B00DEG4Z1W|2.0|It doesn't come with a lot, all it has is two people instead of four and, like, 5 hair color dyes. I like it and all, but it isn't as good on my kindle as on my phone.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Fun and keeps me occupied. Lots to do. The graphics are really good. The more I play the better the game gets. A lot of cool horses.
B0054LJGWS|5.0|I love the Disneyworld series and  I LOVED American Gods, and this delightful book did not disappoint. If you like either author, you'll love them in tandem!
B005MMY9A8|4.0|If you ever wondered how Thor arrived to super heroism, this movie is for you. This movie brought the human element into play in a very entertaining fashion. The evolution of Thor was very captavating as he was grey from a mere mortal to a super hero. The human element of innonce regarding our realm was classic.<br /><br />I do recommend that others watch this movie.
B0042J6VUS|3.0|The holder will only fit my phone if it's protective casing is removed. The holder is lightweight plastic at best.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|I loved this movie. It kept my attention from beginning to end. It is action packed and displayed the reality of molding selfish egos into a true team for a common cause. I look forward to the sequel.<br /><br />I recommend that you watch tis movie.
B00DYTKKGI|4.0|Brilliant but thers a glitch and it wastes my animal jam time. I play this maby once a day or maybe twice on my b-day. Right now I'm listening to big time rush 24-seven. So plz fix this glitch and wat they say is stupid. Another glitch is it won't let u take the wrapper off sometimes and I am about to delete this stupid app it's just stupid.
B00873GRU4|4.0|It was a good book. It was let down during the most pivotal moments, the touching scenes where emotions run high.<br />&#34;Damn them to hell!&#34; Lines like these are too generic and those very dramatic moments did not have a huge impact on me because they seemed to borrow lines from other movies, books. These few moments were cringeworthy.<br />Other than that, a very engaging book from cover to cover. I think the premise for the book was a great idea. Post apocalyptic silos... I like it!
B00AE2IJIE|3.0|I wouldn't want to go the movies to see it, but if you have a child I think they might like it.  Make sure the kid doesn't frighten easy.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is so much fun and its just so hilarious because of the minions. I loved the movie and now i just adore the game as much as the movie :) gotta say its one heck of a game.
B0095MVOMC|5.0|Good for both eye and brain functions.  I get frustated when I can't find a number but it keeps me coming back until I find it.  I won't use the help light what the point of playing if it does the work for you.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|I used to love the Weather Channel app. I relied on it daily. With this latest version, I have come to hate it. I have tried and tried, just can't learn to live with it. I have switched to Weather Bug.
B005LAJ212|5.0|This is the only way of looking at a weekly series.  You get your popcorn and watch all the way thru. DVD arrived on time and in good shape.  There are no complaints.  Would gladly recommend.
B00B5AP7NY|4.0|Although I could not watch the movie since this item was exported to Australia, my son was happy to receive the Clark Kent LEGO figure which was not available in Australia.  The package arrived to Australia about a week ahead of schedule.  Well done!
B00CA3C1N4|1.0|It may be ok on a PC or tablet, but it was horrible on a phone. Not worth the time
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I've been a Chromecast user very much since 'day one'. As a 'cable cutter' person, I rely on various streamers or devices with streaming features to bring content onto our screens.  Chromecast didn't replace or displace our Roku, PS3/PS4, or our Blu-ray players with streaming capabilities and so forth but there are times and situations when you don't have access to any of the above and then a Chromecast should come in handy and the price is low enough to get one and keep in as a backup, just in case. And there are some very interesting capabilities that, if further developed (see my experience with playing off a NAS device) could turn the Chromecast into a revolutionary solution overtime. Should also work well as a first time streamer for anyone who doesn't want to spend a lot to try streaming.<br /><br />Our Chromecast is currently attached to the 'main', large TV in the living room. I am using mostly to cast Youtube and Twitch streams and, occasionally for Netflix.<br /><br />_____________________________________________________<br /><br />Here you have it, a quick FAQ on 'day one' or rather 'hours one and two'. I will update this as I use it more, literally 'as we go'.<br /><br />Q: What can I do with Chromecast?<br />A: I was able to stream Netflix, Pandora, Google Music, Google Play movies or YouTube, stream content off my own HDD and perform some limited browsing.<br /><br />Q: Could a Chromecast completely replace an already installed Roku or PS3, Xbox, Blu-ray player, media hub or whatever streaming solution?<br />A: Not at this moment. There's a lot more content available through the other 'streamers'. Roku has thousands of channels including Netflix and Youtube, the PS4 and Xbox and have both YouTube and Netflix and lots more including Amazon Prime and some basic browsers. I expect that Chromecast will quickly add many more services soon so time will tell.<br /><br />Q: Will a Chromecast ever fully replace a larger or more expensive streaming device?<br />A: Probably not or rather not immediately, but it's a good, inexpensive, entry-level streaming solution and it's likely to get better.<br /><br />Q: Is it equally easy to use it off a Mac/iOS as it is off an Android/PC?<br />A: I am sorry, I did not test it on a Mac/iOS device.<br /><br />Q: What are the best uses for Chromecast?<br />A: Anyone who doesn't already have some streaming device attached to their TV could use the Chromecast if the TV has an HDMI port. It could also be used on 'bedroom' TVs if they don't already have access to a streamer. It could prove itself most valuable while on the road for as long as Wi-Fi is available and you can actually access the TV's features and HDMI ports (good luck with hotel Tvs).<br /><br />Q: Is content truly limited to the services currently supported through apps such as Netflix, Twitch or Youtube?<br />A: Not exactly. You can also stream whatever content you have stored locally and just about anything you can get playing on your Chrome.<br /><br />Q: Will Chromecast suck up all the data off my phone's data plan if I use my phone to control streaming?<br />A: Probably not. In my case, once I told my Netflix app running on my phone that I wanted to watch on the TV, it started to stream Netflix directly to the Chromecast/TV off our Wi-Fi router, treating the phone basically as a remote control.<br /><br />Q: How do I setup my Chromecast?<br />A: You go to a provided URL with your browser and the Chromecast will be added to your Wi-Fi network.<br /><br />Q: Does the Netflix app on my phone need an update to work with Chromecast?<br />A: The odds are it's updated already.<br /><br />Q: Does the Chromecast power itself off the HDMI?<br />A: With HDMI 1.3 I need to power it off the TV's USB port. If your TV doesn't have one, it comes with a USB charger powered off an AC outlet. I wasn't able to test with HDMI 1.4 yet.<br /><br />Q: Are all needed wires and a power adapter included with the Chromecast?<br />A: Yes.<br /><br />Q: Does my TV need to support Wi-Fi?<br />A: No, it's the Chromecast that talks to your Wi-Fi router. The TV simply gets the stream through the HDMI port.<br /><br />Q: Can I use my phone to turn my TV on/off once the Chromecast is attached?<br />A: I couldn't find that option yet.<br /><br />Q: Can I stream whatever is in my Chrome browser to the TV?<br />A: I tried and it's pretty decent. Of course, it depends on how your other hardware involved performs: computer, router.<br /><br />Q: Can I stream from sources other than the Web, such as another computer or a NAS on my home network?<br />A: I just made it work, from a Windows 7 PC by placing file's path into the browser's address and it worked with a video file that was on an NAS (HDD on my home network).<br /><br />Q: Do I absolutely need a phone or tablet to set up and run Chromecast?<br />A: No, you can do it off your PC as well but I believe you need a Chrome browser.<br /><br />Q: Can I return the Chromecast if it doesn't work for me?<br />A: Amazon will let you return anything that's defective for free but you may have to pay for shipping if you return something because you don't like it.<br /><br />Q: What are Chromecast's best features?<br />A: Low price, easy installation, easy to move it from one TV to another.<br /><br />Q: What are Chromecast's main shortcomings?<br />A: Not as many streaming sources as Roku or a Google-enabled TV but that there are more almost every day.<br /><br />Q: Can I use it if Wi-Fi is not an option?<br />A: An Ethernet adapter is now available as a separate purchase.Q: Does my TV need to support Wi-Fi?<br />A: No, it's the Chromecast that talks to your Wi-Fi router.

B000T433CO|5.0|Great story line, actors/actresses are wonderful.  Movie the whole family can watch throughout the whole year (not just on Holidays).
B0049GYXDG|1.0|I purchased this item with good hope that it would work. I have never bought from this company before.  The disk arrived and I was very disappointed that the blu ray disk would not read.  I tried it in multiple players.  Now I wish I had bought this new instead of used.<br /><br />I have contacted the seller and we will see if they can rectify the situation.  If they do I will come back and edit my review.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This app is not as difficult as some of the others and I more than appreciate that. I have been able to solve the puzzles without having to look for cheats.
B005O7PXNS|5.0|This is the first season we began watching and really enjoyed it.  Now we have to go back and watch the rest of the seasons!
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Great game! I love to play! Wish collection items were easier to get but still fun! I could play for hours and most days do!!!!!
B0064X7FVE|2.0|New update was unnecessary and now it isn't user friendly. I don't even like the look of it now. Why did they have to mess with it? I hope they go back to the old version again!
B004GUSG4M|5.0|It was A tear jerker. A must read. It makes you consider your life and what is important to you.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|A great finale to the wonderful hunger games with a happy ending! I would definitely recommend the ENTIRE series to anyone and everyone including the gregor the overlander fans!!!
B004UJ81IA|3.0|Travels are not the same with out thinking of the Burro ahead of me. Enjoyable and fun to read. Get it.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|Definitely a must see movie . This is good entertainment For the whole family.  We will definitely be watching for the next one to be released.
B004J4WLPU|2.0|The story was confusing.  Often could not tell who was speaking as it jumped back and forth between characters.  Long and involved then solved in a few pages without much meaning.
B008NC1LJ6|3.0|The plot was interesting in the way everyone's lives were connected and affected each other. I would have liked less characters and more in depth stories within fewer characters.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|George R.R. Martin really takes you to places you would never expect. You see the diffrent paths cross in the most mindblowing ways. Two thumbs way up.
B00A757EFW|4.0|I love the game. Sometimes it's hard to maneuver around the corners on the Kindle.<br />Brings back a lot of memories.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|Takes you along a diffrent path than the rest but that makes it all the more interesting. A great read...
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Requires very quick responses without a lot of time. Very Challenging and lots<br />of fun. Takes many coins to collect boards and people.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|George RR Martin continues to be both engaging and surprising in his writing. The books may be long page wise but you get so engaged they go quickly, and he always leaves you wanting more...
B00992CF6W|5.0|I think it's worth 5 stars because it has fun things to and its fun to build things.<br />I like the graphics.
B000AJIF4E|4.0|I have been in the broadcast industry for over 30 years.  I am very fussy about the sound of my headphones.  I love these, and have purchase several over the years.  I'd give them 5 stars, except for the fine wires that tend to cause one or both sides to &#34;cut out&#34; over time.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|I like that it has all the towers and different buildings.  Has good graphics, easy to play and good upgrades.
B0027MJU00|4.0|This has a much better ending than Gone Girl. I really liked this book and had trouble putting it down.
B005HSL626|5.0|I love the game, sometimes it can be challenging not hitting the bombs.<br />Would recommend to people of all ages. I really like the fruit facts they show.
B0098460O4|5.0|Amazing vocals and music.  I love this album.  Hope to see more of these two on DVD and elsewhere.  Love it.
B005DJREGQ|3.0|Typical coming-of-age scenarios with triumph over adversity.  The acting is only fair.  At least the girl has supportive friends.  She is better off than some!
B003I55BIA|5.0|Perfect Chemistry is one of those books that I kept seeing everywhere. It was popular, and I was suspicious that it was going to be a miss for me, but I was proven wrong. I love Simone Elkele's writing and really cared for the two main characters, Alex and Brittany. I like how the book demonstrates that in every family, there are good and bad things like anything in life. It isn't just black and white. If you want to read something gritty and intense in YA, definitely check this book out.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|this game is fun. I love the minons. I only wish that you could get rewards better. it is hard to get coins and stuff. but it is fun.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|Initially the new format was disrupting, but I&acute;ve gotten used to where things are.  If I have a complaint it would be navigating between saved locations.
B00821PCJS|5.0|Falling Skies is the best sci-fi in years. The story line and events all seem plausible. As yet I have not viewed any scenes that seem unbelievable. I will be watching Season Two shortly!
B00AZMFO6I|5.0|This is a Marvelous movie!  It was well conceived, and well acted - It was enjoyable from first to last.
B00DJFIMW6|2.0|No instructions what so ever. Game requires you to slide finger across screen to make Minion move. Poor responce to movement . You have to jump over items. No idea how. Big let down. Video before game starts was more interesting then the game
B007V2UGPE|5.0|It's very good good graphics nice game play the thing is I wish you could fight on your own I like how they made a second
B007FTZDN8|5.0|There are some I don't like, but most of them I really do! There are so engaging, interesting, cutting edge and knowledge packed. I keep telling my friends about TED talks. I love having access to these incredible lectures.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I find this apps to be a fun, time consuming game to play while I'm relaxing watching a movie. Very entertaining and a good way to relax before bed.
B005GY0Y8S|3.0|Took along time for me to get into his book mainly because i don't speak or write french. The story about maggie being a private detective just takes too long.
B004WO57E4|4.0|I have always loved and played these games.  When I was a kid, I played I and II and only got the rest of them now.  I haven't played through all five yet, but the first three are pretty good!  I absolutely LOVE the first two.  The reason for the rating of only 4 stars is that they keep freezing and locking up my computer until I open a task manager and close the game.  This has happened with all three that I have played so far.  I have windows 7.  I assume it is because the games are for windows 95 and MS DOS that they continue to give me this problem.  Game play is as awesome as I remember it being!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this is a really great game my daughter loves it.! i really like it too. i just wish it didnt make you rely on gems so much
0307914550|5.0|...And I've bought huraches for running.  McDougall is a very good storyteller and the characters are so well developed that when I run, their traits amuse me for miles on end.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Game is so much fun and very addictive. Love playing it!  I find that I will need to do an update!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|My favorite TV series. I just wish their season had more episodes... Nonetheless, this season is just as good as the others.
B000SJ5XF0|5.0|Purchased this to listen to around the house. It's an awesome album well worth the money. You can never really go wrong with a Led Zeppelin album no matter what your musical tastes are. Don't miss out on this one!
B00847KFDS|5.0|I have liked John Fogerty since I was about 16 years old (50 years ago) and it is very nice to have old songs in a new format to enjoy all over again.
B00AEUPOVQ|1.0|-hard to follow dialogue - accent and delivery - needed to read subtitles<br />-hard to believe in attraction between characters - lead female's character was so undeveloped - and she was so dowdy - I just don't get it<br />-very hard to follow story line<br />-pretty much a waste of time<br />nothing redeeming -<br />-I don't understand how others gave it a higher rating??
B00C7KYXHW|4.0|You get so frustrated when Hannibal keeps getting away with stuff. But Hugh is sexy. Fun show. Keeps me interested
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|This game is awesome and fun! I do realy like it! I have fun try to know the draw! Nice game!
0920668372|5.0|I had this book when my 3 children were babies.  Gave this as a gift.  This book still brings tears to my eyes.  I would recommend the packing be a box so the book doesn't arrive bent through the mail process.  It is not a hardback book, which would have been nicer as a gift.
B00A11AN6O|2.0|I downloaded it thinking it was like the photo transfer app.  After installing I discovered it was not what I thought, so I don't use it.
B0090SI4OC|2.0|I'm one of the only males on the planet Earth who actually admit to liking the \\"Twilight\\" movies and books. That being said, I have to say I was excited when I heard sci-fi Director Andrew Niccol was adapting Stephenie Meyer's other novel, \\"The Host,\\" for the big screen. \\"Gattaca\\" was widely acclaimed and even \\"In Time\\" received mixed reviews. I was hoping Niccol would at least find a happy medium in between those two and give author Meyer's fans something to be proud of. Unfortunately, I didn't get what I wanted upon viewing the movie.<br /><br />Aliens have invaded Earth and taken over the bodies of humans as hosts. The process erases the memories of most of the victims. However, a select few have been found to be strong-willed and fight for their individuality and humanity. Melanie Stryder (Saoirse Ronan) is such a person. Her drive to save her brother (Chandler Canterbury) and boyfriend (Max Irons) from being captured by the aliens creates turmoil within. Melanie battles the entity inside her for control of her body and mind.<br /><br />I'm going to compare \\"The Host\\" to \\"Twilight\\" throughout this review. There's no way to avoid it, so I'll just embrace it and suffer the wrath of millions of Meyer's enthusiasts worldwide. The similarities are too obvious. Both feature a love triangle and deal with a female facing the loss of her humanity. Yes, one is a vampire and the other is an alien. Aren't we just splitting hairs here?<br /><br />Let's talk about the good aspects of \\"The Host\\" to begin. The cinematography looks beautiful and adds grand scale to the production. With the exception of one or two scenes, the CGI is convincing and doesn't pull you out of the film. That's more than can be said about the \\"Twilight\\" movies. Most the acting comes off as genuine, although there's definitely some heavy-handed dialogue for the actors to fumble through.<br /><br />We now move on to the negative aspects found in \\"The Host.\\" Saoirse Ronan's inner dialogue gets tiresome very quick. I can't necessarily tell you what filmmakers could have used in place of it, but it became painful within the first few minutes after it started. Secondly, the action sequences in the film almost feel forced. I haven't read the book, so I can't tell you if they were added or expanded to give guys ANYTHING to enjoy when they're girlfriends make them watch this.<br /><br />There's nothing too threatening about \\"The Host\\" as far as subject matter is concerned. It's a bunch of new age-sounding gobbledegoo about living in harmony with everyone and striving for peace on Earth. It also endeavors to show people can overcome incredible obstacles if they just put their minds to the task. There are a few scenes of sensuality between the three main characters which some will find offensive.<br /><br />The DVD release of \\"The Host\\" comes with a few special features for those interested. The featurette \\"Bringing 'The Host' To Life\\" includes interviews and behind-the-scenes footage. It also contains deleted scenes and \\"Seeker PSA\\" feature commentary.<br /><br />\\"The Host\\" isn't going to satisfy anyone except possibly fans of the book. It definitely won't win over any serious sci-fi fans or compel them to pick up the novel. The movie is another failed and dull attempt at starting a young adult fantasy franchise. It's even left open for a sequel, which given the movie's poor box office performance, we'll never get (at least on film).y quick.

B00634GHJA|3.0|I had a bit of trouble trying to figure out what to do after downloading the app.  There is quite a few steps involved including downloading the same software to your computer  and then trying to sync my Kindle to the computer I had to do manually, which took me a while to figure out as I am not computer savvy.  But once I finally got it to work, it does work!
B00C2VIA52|5.0|Love this game so much I play it all day only downside u gotta pay for the best cards<br /><br />All in all very fun
B00CWVGBEO|3.0|If your looking for a deep movie, look elsewhere.  But for a straight entertainment, action packed movie, Arnold does great.
B008OOYALE|5.0|fun game to play. it can get very additive trying to get a certain dragon. my kindle needs to reboot periodically due to the app locking up though.
B00DHNBPA6|4.0|Good movie. Despite straying from the original, this movie was actually very good and managed to keep some key components of the original, and even a little bit from Evil Dead 2.
B0050PYNP8|5.0|This movie is very cute & funny! I saw this movie when it came out I'm the theaters and I had to buy it.  Would definitely recommend it
B00DU74U74|4.0|It wasn't what I was expecting so when I watched it I was more than pleased and would recommend it to others to watch!!!  If you did or didn't like twilight I do think you'll like the host so don't base it off the author of the books.
B001NFNFNU|5.0|This is one of the best movies I've ever seen. Angelina Jolie did an excellent job. The story is just amazing. It's a must watch movie. Defiantly worth every dollar payed.
B005K0HDGE|3.0|I was excited to think after all these years, there actually might be a location other then Maine... No such luck. I was happy with the changes Mr. King has made here. I quit reading his work about 5-6 years ago, because they got to be boring, but I tried this, and was surprised.<br /><br />It could have been much more- great premise, but missed the mark at the end.
B0002KPIQY|5.0|This is the best movie I've ever seen. I'm do glad I bought it because I loved it so much. I watch this movie every chance I have. If you're undecided to buy this well I would take the risk. You won't regret it
B00BSBUZT6|5.0|You don't need to be a fan of the Eagles to enjoy this DVD. This will make you wonder why you ever wanted to be a rock star because there is so much clashing of personalities in that lifestyle.
1401902197|5.0|Wonderful book full of affirmations that can be applied to your life at different times. I am really enjoying it.
B000ID1J0E|5.0|I really recommend this movie based on a story by Hunter Thompson if you want to have a special an fun time. This movie is quite unique and interesting, too. You learn a lot about the effect of drugs. I have not laughed so hard and much in a long time!
B000N5F6OW|4.0|This is just a great classic movie with John Wayne and other actors. It is a little long, but a wonderful clean movie.
B0088W7VNG|5.0|I Like all the seasons.  I think that the series was cut too short and the ending should have had more leading up to it but overall this season is as good as any of them
B00BJKYM40|5.0|I loved this book. An alien comes to earth with a set of assumtions about Humans and slowly starts to change his view of how life should be.<br />Excellent stuff - well written and wise.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|Once you finish the first chapter you will be hooked! Love the characters and story line. Book is very easy to read and follow.
B005XDHNF4|5.0|I had no idea they made a Lego cake topper until I was shopping for an interesting topper and this popped up- all of the regular toppers suddenly seemed boring in comparison. I like that you can choose the bride's hair and flower colors, and I like that you have to assemble it yourself. The groom's facial expression was a little strange, but all the new Lego faces are. I suppose I could have bought a new head at the Lego store. As for size, the figures by themselves would have been too small, but with the platform and arch it was the perfect size for our 3-tier, 80-serving cake.
B000AGTPUK|5.0|We enjoy this movie a lot, it is now a part of our Christmas veiwing traditions. Anything that includes Tom Hanks is #1 in our book.

B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Best show on tv.  Maggie Smith is fabulous. The characters and scenery are exquisite!  I wish it came on more than once a week!
B002JXK5VU|3.0|Light entertainment for those nights when you don't want to have to think too hard.  As the title of the review says, it is what it is.
B0000844M8|5.0|But giving a 5 star rating because of the film itself. I'll get back to you once I've watched it, in regards to any quality-of-dvd issues that might exist. If I don't, then everything's great.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|LOve this show!  Never would have given it a second look, but all of the awards and Maggie Smith, so glad I got to see it!  Now waiting for the next season, not so marvelous!
B004LP3AYI|5.0|As the second book in the series, Stone of Tears is a fairly good read. Having read this one many times, I was a bit surprised to find myself realizing that the writing is a bit weak (at times). I think Goodkind was still finding his voice/writing style. But, the story line(s) are fantastic. I hate seeing Richard and Kahlan separated, but the particular event seems to be a recurring theme throughout the series. I had a lot of emotion invested in the story as I watched Richard struggle with who he is while traveling in the Old World as Kahlan fought to lead the Midlands to freedom from the Imperial Order. Once again, strong characters (especially strong women) dominate this story, but it is a page turner. I absolutely love Sister Verna. She is a breath of fresh air. I'd love to see a side story done about her someday.
B00CXQL828|5.0|Fantastic line up's or the term supergroups don't always produce great results but this one does. With Guitarist Richie Kotzen, Bassist Billy Sheehan and Drummer Mike Portnoy make one of the best 3 piece groups i have heard since Cream. They come right out with massive power but they are textured & melodic. This might be the first time that Richie Kotzen really get's to show what he can do as a guitar player & as far as his singing my first thought was wow he sounds a bit like Chris Cornell in some spots. With Billy Sheehan You know you have a monster no matter what he is on it's going to have monster grooves & great change up's. Now add Mike Portnoy & you have a drummer that can handle there speed & crazy change up's but still be powerful & beat the drums as hard as John Bonham.End result is you have a album with well thought out change up's,crushing monster grooves that has ton's of texture & melodic chorus lines & very original music.
B0064W67IM|5.0|After hearing about the Sandman series for several years, I finally decided to visit my local library and pick up the first volume. The concept of a graphic novel as an intense storyline with stellar art was, to me, intriguing.<br /><br />Although I used to read comics when I was younger - mostly Marvel and DC's Star Trek line - I'd moved away from that medium shortly after high school. I'm glad I listened to the recommendation for Gaiman's Sandman series - arguably Vertigo's most popular publishing - as the book to bring me back to illustrated storytelling. The art in each novel is unbelievable, and Todd Klein's lettering is fluid and beautiful!<br /><br />The premise of the first volume is this: After being imprisoned by a power-hungry human for 70 years, Morpheus, commonly known as Dream, escapes captivity and sets out to recover the objects that give him his power, which were stolen from him. As he travels, he has dealings with Lucifer (a recurring character in the Sandman universe), John Constantine (a popular comic book character), and ultimately encounters a mad-man who uses one of Dream's objects to wreak havoc on humanity.<br /><br />The storylines range from surreal to absurd,  but that quirkiness is what makes this novel so interesting. Gaiman weaves in facets of ancient mythology and religion to create a multitude of worlds through which Dream travels.<br /><br />Gaiman's unique voice comes across in each tale, and each novel as a distinct story-telling style. The issues in this first volume contain DC-character crossovers, that while interesting, tends to detract from Gaiman's established voice.<br /><br />Dream is a gorgeous character, illustrated in dark violets, whites and blacks. The stark beauty of the Dream King is haunting, and the landscapes in which he moves are breathtaking.<br /><br />The Sandman Vol. 1: Preludes and Nocturnes is great when simply judging it on writing alone, but when you add in the incredible artwork and detailed lettering, the novel becomes a stellar find and worthy of reading several times.<br /><br />Readers should be warned the Sandman series often features graphic subject matter - sex, drugs and death being common themes - but it is never gratuitous and always serves to progress the story.the novel becomes a stellar find and worthy of reading several times.<br /><br />Readers should be warned the Sandman series often features graphic subject matter - sex, drugs and death being common themes - but it is never gratuitous and always serves to progress the story.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|I don't have it, and wont be getting it. It appears to be another canned apps streaming device. I had Google TV. Content was limited on google tv, and streaming from chrome tabs is in beta, and reported not to work very well. You also need a minimum i3 equivalent CPU. Streaming from a cell phone is cool. Perhaps in a year or two when you can truly stream the web, I will get an unlimited data plan on Tmobile and watch all the web video I want with it. Until then, I still have the cord to the cable internet provider, and my WHDI stick that lets me stream anything I want from my laptop to my HDTV.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Zombie mythos is at an all-time high, as evidenced by the popular The Walking Dead graphic novels and television show, Zombieland and just about every other incarnation imaginable. So, it shouldn't come as a surprise that Max Brooks' popular first-person, biographical account of the Zombie War has become a classic, must-read zombie novel.<br /><br />The reprint cover boasts \\"soon to be a major motion picture\\" and, hopefully, the movie will stay true to the book (although that is so rarely the case).<br /><br />The premise of World War Z is this: The 10-year nightmare that soon became known as the Zombie War nearly eradicated humanity. Max Brooks, a federal employee charged with compiling a report that detailed the events of the war, soon discovers the United Nations Postwar Commission failed to truly capture the horrors, loss and bravery of the war and those who survived.<br /><br />Brooks, armed with a notebook and recorder, travels across the United States and throughout the world to capture first-person accounts of those who fought in the war. His subjects range from military brass to political figures to moms and dads who did their best to save their families from the mobs of the undead that took over the world of the living.<br /><br />Fresh on the heels of a tenuous victory over the zombie army, Brooks recounts harrowing tales of combat, unspeakable loss and bravery from the unlikeliest heroes.<br /><br />World War Z is an interesting take on the zombie mythos. It's engaging, thoughtful and stands out from many of the other zombie stories out there. The personal recollections from characters who could be a neighbor of family member lend it a believability that's rare in the undead genre. It's almost easy to forget that this is a fictional account of an impossible reality.<br /><br />However, that being said, the story suffered a little because of thinly veiled pop culture and political references - Paris Hilton, Bush, Obama, television shows, etc. It's always dicey to dated references in a book, because eventually, those examples become outdated and ultimately detract from the story. Brooks could have foregone those and had a stronger story.<br /><br />The first-person narratives could have been tied together a bit more to create a stronger continuity. At times, it felt like the book was left hanging, especially at the end.<br /><br />Aside from those criticisms, World War Z was an enjoyable and it'd be great if a sequel was written, specifically one that delved into the stories Brooks left untold.dicey to dated references in a book, because eventually, those examples become outdated and ultimately detract from the story.

B002ZB26AO|4.0|Who doesn't know life in North Korea has to be difficult. However, this book details, through stories from those that escaped, just how terrible life really is. Citizens are forced to work for no pay, prevented from engaging in any activity that might help them survive, and starved to death. I recommend this book to anyone that thinks life in America is tough.
B0064W63D6|5.0|In this collection, we meet the Sandman's family. Most of the remaining Endless - Destiny, Desire, Death, Despair and Delirium. Called by Destiny for a family gathering, Morpheus (aka the Sandman) realizes he must enter Hell to rectify a mistake made 10,000 years ago. But when he gets there, he finds that Lucifer Morningstar has abdicated his power in the Triumvirate and has forced everyone out of Hell. Upon locking up the final gate, he gives Morpheus the key to Hell and tells him that it is now his responsibility.<br /><br />Faced with the daunting task of deciding what to do with this new kingdom, Morpheus soon finds himself host to several different beings all claiming their desire for the ownership of Hell. Each has something to offer in return for the Key. In an interlude between chapters, we are allowed to see what happens when the dead return upon Hell's closure. In issue #25, \\"In Which the Dead Return; and Charles Rowland Concludes His Education,\\" we witness the life of a young man at an English-boarding school and what happens as long-dead boys began appearing at the school. Although this is never revisited in the collection, I read that Charles' adventures continue in a series called \\"The Dead Boy Detectives.\\" This brief tangent of a storyline is perhaps my favorite in the entire collection. Something with Charles and young Edwin Paine resonated with me. I can imagine that I will be reading \\"The Dead Boy Detectives\\" if I can get my hands on a copy.<br /><br />\\"The Sandman\\" is definitely a mature reader series with sex, death and violence scattered in every other panel. That being said, there's something so compelling about this series. I can't put these books down!
B001NLKZUA|5.0|Loved the second installment of this series. It was fast paced and it kept on the edge of my seat the hole entire time. I also loved seeing the other characters views as well.
B009QA3VY2|4.0|This is one of my favorite classic novels. The conflict between the upper and middle and even lower classes is fascinating to me, especially as those class distinctions were slowly starting to blur together.<br /><br />The struggles Margaret Schlegel faces in choosing between her ideals, her family and her love for Henry Wilcox - who is staunchly set in his beliefs - is compelling to read as the story unfolds.<br /><br />In the end, I think all parties are left vaguely dissatisfied, except for Helen, but I still find the book very gratifying. Although I've read the book several times, I opted to listen to the audiobook this time, because Emma Thompson narrated it. Ear candy!
B0064X7FVE|1.0|Change it back ........ PLEASE. I am back to using the Web Page.<br />At the very least get rid of all the baby blue....it is nauseating.
B00A8ECU24|2.0|My daughter and I love the show and were SO excited when we first started this game. It didn't take long, however, for me to realize how much overtime I would need to start pulling if I want to do ANYTHING other than work those poor ponies into the ground for days at a time for a measly payoff barely large enough to even dip our toe into the water that would otherwise be one of if not the best game in the entire android library!<br /><br />I mean, I get the free to play/micro transaction model. In most cases I prefer it and honestly probably end up paying more over the course of play than I would for a game with an up front fee. But when there's an option to spend $100 in a children's game you know something's wrong. At first I thought it was a typo. That there could be no way these jack holes designed a game that pretty much forced you to shell out hundreds of dollars for BASIC gameplay and potentially thousands to play with any real sense of completion. Honestly, it makes me sick. I have spent $0 on/in it and at this point never intend to out of principle. Had the prices been reasonable, I can see being ok with dropping $20, $30, $40 he'll maybe more over a few weeks/months. Instead, it goes the way of every other disappointing beacon of greed: remove from carousel, remove from device.<br /><br />So, unless you're just dying to throw a couple hundred bucks at it, it's really best to just save you and your child the heartache and stick to developers who haven't gone completely bananas.
B000HX4ZF6|2.0|It's a given that Hollywood blockbusters are not faithful to reality, so let's ignore the absurdity of the clothes (off by 500 years in either direction); the tactics; the distortion of history that turns Robert the Bruce (the original &#34;brave heart&#34;) into a traitor, the fecund bisexual Edward the Second into a caricature of an effeminate gay man, and William Wallace into the father of a bastard line of English kings.<br /><br />Mel, nearly 40 at the time, is not credible as the young man in the romantic comedy segment leading up to his wife's murder: his adoring gaze from behind cover looks more like a desperate creepy stalker following Catherine McCormack. We get to enjoy Brendan Gleeson, Patrick McGoohan, Catherine McCormack, et al. for a while, and then Mel gets captured and tortured in a scene that was, in retrospect, just a warmup for his directing role in &#34;The Passion of the Christ&#34;.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Parts of this book weren't easy to read...no parent wants anything like this to ever happen to their child.  But overall, it was interesting.
B009FZFONO|5.0|Very engaging...  love the character development.  Excited to see what happens in season 4.<br />Was very easy to stream off Amazon!
B0031YJFCQ|4.0|very exciting and followed previous books.  easy to keep up with. characters very real. had a hard time putting it down.
B0090SI3ZW|1.0|One might expect a pretty thrilling action film when the cast includes Crowe and Dave Bautista, but this movie was a laughable attempt to mimic old martial arts films from many decades ago.  The wigs are hilarious.  Not meant to be, of course.<br /><br />The action is fast and complicated, but no one cares.  Why?  Because the camera shots are way too close!  Sometimes it's like watching a fight scene from one of the fighter's pockets.<br /><br />There is a lot of killing and bloody spurts, but it looks fake and is often for no good reason.  Storytelling is this movie's weakness.<br /><br />The narrator is ponderous, boring, and ghetto--which makes no sense.  He is the worst part of the movie.  The blacksmith who loves a lady of the night.  Sounds interesting, right?  It's not.  The story is narrated as if from a fifth-grader's perspective.  In fact, I bet some kid wrote this film.<br /><br />Here's the thing: The story has to be well-written BEFORE you add all of the gore and fight choreography and gratuitous sex!!!<br /><br />NEVER BUY.  NEVER WATCH.  NEVER REMEMBER THIS FILM.
B006M7JCC2|4.0|Very interesting reading, breaking down the fear of the unknown in a simple personal experience level. Such misconceptions exist due to societal conditioned learning, this book breaks it down! Very enjoyable reading.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|As usual Nicholas Sparks wrote another great love story. It had suspense and love and a little comedy in it too.
B000PC0SPU|5.0|It is very interesting to learn about how our present & future is/might be shaping up!<br />Brilliant study by the author, really enjoyed reading this book!
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|Quite recently I got exposed to these Marvel movies, (I don't have any kids) and I really like them. Amazon instant video is a very convenient way to catch up! The picture quality is good with a good connection, and the price is very reasonable.
0763644765|5.0|My son received this book for his 2nd birthday.  He isn't quite ready to start potty training yet, but I wanted him to understand the idea behind it, so when he is ready, he will know what is going on.  From the first time he opened this book, he fell in love.  By the last page, he was already saying \\"again!\\".  As other reviewers mentioned, it is mostly illustration and not a lot of words, but the book is adorable.  We use enthusiasm when reading to our son, and in turn, he really gets excited about reading.  He understands what the book is about (dog going potty, kitty going potty, baby going potty).  The book is perfect for 2-3 year olds and isn't too bogged down with a lot of dialogue for the child to get lost in.  The pictures and words allow for us to talk about what is happening in the book, and creates a good understanding of what the potty is all about.  My son is exceptionally verbal at only 24 months, speaking in full sentences most of the time, so the idea that this book is beneath children with advanced verbal skills is silly.  It is a cute book, grabs my son's attention in a fun way that allows us to teach and him to learn.  We love this book and have since bought others by Leslie Patricelli because of it!
B00DHNB5CY|5.0|This is one of the best remakes one can possibly find, of any genre of film for that matter.  This movie is macabre to the bone.  Straight up disturbing and chilling.  There's no humor to it, like in the original either.  It's pure terror.  Make sure you have someone to grab while you watch this, because you'll need someone for sure.  Again, one of the best remakes of any film I have seen in my life.  Take it from a guy who's been around for close to 4 decades.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|Up lifting and fun. just challenging enough to keep me playing. love me some ponies!! I wish it was cheaper to get them but the game is free afterall. I love MLP FIM and this game complements it perfectly
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Even though I just started I am already so impressed the minions are up to this task. I think it is a fun activity for everyone, Vector, and Meena are awesome people to defeat as a challenge. Maybe there may be more surprises for me later on in this great game.
B00CAJMGDI|5.0|I usually only like alt rock, metal and things like that, but I find this music to be pretty awesome to help me concentrate on studying!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I loved the whole series!!! can't wait for next one.... whenever that is. I am definitely hooked and tell all my friends to get them...
B00992CF6W|5.0|My 9 Year old son loves this game.  He has fun building things and playing in survival mode which requires strategy.  He likes that he can shut his kindle down and pick right back up where the game was too.
B007CKNX28|5.0|I had never even heard of Jack White before watching the &#34;It Might Get Loud&#34; documentary in 2012. This man is interesting and engaged (I'm not speaking in the marital sense) and his music is so fresh. If you're interested in a learning a bit more about him, check out the Jack White-Conan O'Brien &#34;Serious Jibber-Jabber&#34; conversation online. It's worth the hour and a quarter. :-)

B0063IH60K|3.0|I love the game and play it daily; however, they recently upgraded there ads and the new ads are so intrusive that I'm now looking for a new game.
B0018RWMNM|4.0|I've seen the movie many times, one of my all time favorites but sound quality was off for most of movie
B003G4W49C|5.0|I am looking forward to reading the next one. Great plot, and kept me engaged and wanting more. Worth getting.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|Great movie, hope there is another Avengers to come out soon.  Maybe other super heros can be a part of the next one.
B0083ZRAJS|3.0|Very different from what you expect, having seen the film first.  Not bad—just different. I enjoyed a lot of the little details that were lost in its adaptation. Other parts were just *weird*.
B009RH9FR6|5.0|This product exceeded  all my expectations and then some.  Easy to put together, looks great, protects my Kindle, functions with ease.
B00CDT41RY|1.0|I really can't comment on the video because it never loaded for me. What a disappointment!-especially as I was on a date.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|fun for everyone in the family. super addicting! find out the rest for yourself by getting the app! : )
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|The characters are so alive and the period is one that I just love.  Of course, I have been in love with the characters, so when one leaves, it really saddens me.  Great job on the show.
B00DM0XXCM|2.0|This film was a total waste of effort by the effects team because it attempts to deal with story built upon a preposterous and inconsistent premise.  The fantasy of negative gravity could have been interesting if there was some consistency in its application.  However, the screen play chose to ignore its premise whenever convenient to further support a manufactured story dependent upon the premise.  What the viewer gets is a circular mess of inconsistency that is almost comical in its execution and a screenplay that seems to make things up as it goes to get one to a very predictable conclusion.  While I think Jim Sturgess, and to a lesser extent, Kirsten Dunst made a decent effort with such weak material, it is a shame that the effort put into a premise without regard to consistency, made the entire film a meaningless waste of time for the viewer.  I can admire those filmmakers who successfully use a hypothetical setting to add a contemporary relevance to an old story, but in this case, it stretches credulity so much as to cause the viewer to completely discount the premise.  The only entertainment provided by this film is the visual depiction of a world within a world where negative gravity can exist.  If you can get past the absurdity of the premise, you will not be able to accept the convenience of inconsistency in its application.  A Romeo and Juliet who must overcome gravity is an absurdity that I can do without.  What a shame so much visual artistry was wasted.  I suppose it only demonstrates that visual effects, no matter how well done, cannot be the foundation of  a good film.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I had heard people rave about this show, especially when the series ended.  It has lived up to the hype.  I think people would be surprised to see a PBS series, be this great.  Highly recommend.
B00CDV6WDS|5.0|This is a very fun game.  My favorite part of this version of Mahjong is that every game is solvable.
0307593312|3.0|Reading this book is like traveling down a slow moving river. It keeps you moving without rapids and waterfalls. There's time for reflection and wondering what's ahead. It's a mind-bender and you will speak in metaphors. You may even see two moons in the sky from time to time.<br /><br />Even if you don't want to read the 900+ pages, browse the hardcover version for the graphic design characteristics. Note the placement and style of the page numbers.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This was excellent! This was exactly what I was looking for, and it was convenient to stream.  Amazon Prime is definitely worth it!!

B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I had some hands on time with the chromecast today at the event and I can say that it is almost flawless. Everything connected super quickly and google's solution to TV video streaming is perfect. Even the laptop chrome tab viewing (which is in beta) worked without a hitch. You also do not need the power cord if your HDMI port is relatively current (I think it's HDMI 1.4 and up?). Additionally, because it is totally cross platform, it makes it useful to anyone. At the 35 dollar pricepoint, I can't fathom why someone wouldn't want this device.
B009E3EY38|5.0|With all of the attention swirling around this &#34;reunion&#34; and concert, I was glad when it was announced that a CD/DVD was to be released covering the event.  I was saddened that it took Jimmy Page so long to do that, but I am thankful that he did.<br /><br />There are a few places in the video that are obvious 'do overs' from the original soundtrack, but all in all, this is Zeppelin some thirtysome years on.  I will give them the nod that they did these songs well, a fitting salute to Ahmet Ertigan.<br /><br />And now, this can all be put to bed.  Unless Zeppelin decides to go back into the studio and record some new tracks, I'll be perfectly content to let this be their Swan Song.  I don't need to see them out touring the same songs night after night.  This was enough.
1451627297|5.0|This was a great read I must say. It caught my attention (like every Stephen King book does) and kept the pages flowing. I thoroughly enjoyed this book and all it had to offer. The characters were just amazing and well fleshed out. The setting was beautifully written! Made me feel like I was at home.<br /><br />As with the plot, the plot was VERY interesting and intriguing! All together Stephen King created a heck of a book once more and made me a happy reader. This book will not fail to please people!

B003O86FMW|4.0|Really good read. I didn't feel like it was beneath me, although I'm an adult male. Wasn't put off by a female main character.  Suzanne Collins is a fine writer whose plots are interesting and innovative enough to engage older readers, but she's a godsent for young readers.

B00BETX5PS|4.0|I have not been a big fan of the successors to Sean Connery or Roger Moore or of the movies made with 007 since Connery & Moore retired from the role. Skyfall and this &#34;version&#34; of Daniel Craig were very satisfactory over all. Some of the sequences, like the villain's escape from MI-6 HQ and the subsequent chase through London to Whitehall(?), were suspenseful but ultimately over-the-top with the special effects. Give me Matt Damon's Jason Bourne first.
B004TI5N38|3.0|Pretty good read.  Not filled with excessively crude language.  A bit too predictable, tho. Appreciated the fact that the hero & heroine did not have the standard torrid love encounter.

0143120530|4.0|Did you know that there was a yearly U.S. Memory Championship where indiviuduals compete with one another to memorize random digits, decks of cards, and poems as quickly as possible? Well, I wasn't aware - until I read this book. I browse through a lot (and I mean a lot) and book blogs and websites, and I had seen this book pop up quite a few times. From the description, it seemed interesting, but since I have such a huge TBR pile and I'm supposed to be on book-buying ban, I made myself hold off. However, a month or so later my boyfriend asks if I would be interested in reading this book, because he got it for free from his university. Of course I'm interested! I was very pleasantly surprised by what I ended up reading.<br /><br />In this informative book, Foer not only explains the interesting and extensive past of memory and how it has evolved through time, but he also takes us along with him on his daunting journey of preparing for the U.S. Memory Championship.<br />If you want, you could think of this as a self-help book with a nice to story to go along with it. As Foer repeatedly states and exemplifies, any normal person can vastly improve their memory with a lot of practice! Foer gives many helpful tricks to memorization while sharing his own methods of practicing. Along with this, Foer delves into a brief yet thorough explanation of memory throughout history and cutting-edge research and experiments that have been and are currently being performed to help people better under how memory works.<br /><br />I really enjoyed this book; I was afraid the subject matter may get a bit boring at times, but was very pleasantly surprised when I realized that it wasn't boring at all. Foer uses a very engaging and amiable voice that draws the reader in and doesn't let them go.<br /><br />What it boils down to: If you're looking for a nice mix of entertainment and education, here you go! I definitely recommend this book to anyone who finds this topic even remotely interesting.

0544139453|5.0|This was the first book I read by Mohsin Hamid, and I was not disappointed. I tend to have a rather short attention span, and it  only took me about a day to read this book. Hamid has an extremely unique way of telling a story that makes it impossible to put down his book.<br /><br />This book is basically a conversation that takes place in a cafe in Lahore, Pakistan between a Pakistani man, Changez, and an American visitor. Changez relates his story as an immigrant in America, from his rise to the top to the tragedy of 9/11 and its effect on his position. The man lays out his life, opinions, and relationships to the American. It is written as if you are the American visitor and Changez is speaking directly to you. I can see how easy it would be for many authors to go wrong with this style, but Hamid does it beautifully; it is simply captivating.<br /><br />The Reluctant Fundamentalist is full of symbolism, wisdom, honesty, and passion. If you are uncertain of whether you should read this book - do it. You will not be disappointed.

Lots of good tracks on the first album including some big radio hits like &#34;Home&#34;.  Lots of stuff to sing along too.  Really an enjoyable debut album, he could have a great career ahead of him in music.

B005WUHAX8|5.0|I was very impressed with this case from the moment it arrived (only 4 days after I ordered it!) sometimes I can be a bit technologically challenged so when I opened it to find no paper instructions I thought surely they forgot to pack my instruction packet.  Upon further review all I saw we're two pieces of plastic ( the front and back cover)... How were these two pieces supposed to keep my phone safe? Nonetheless After looking at the pieces inside if the box I found that you must go to their website to get directions.  All of the directions were very simple- though he website makes them seem more complicated.  Very easy- place tissue/napkin inside of case, snap case together completely and submerge in water for 30 ,minutes.  After test use a coin on corner of phone case to begin opening phone and the rest should open very easily (mine did).  Take tissue out, make sure it's not wet ( mine was 100%dry).  Wipe off case and place iPhone inside!  Your phone is ready to be protected!  Before this case I went almost 2.5 months with no case on my iPhone and was always so worried something was going to happen.  I can tell you this is by far one of the slimmest cases I have ever owned as well.  Well worth the investment-cant wait to test it out in our pool this weekend :)

B000W4E3OS|3.0|Let me start with a few caveats, or as some would probably have it, a few mea culpas. I am not a musicologist, nor expert on Scriabin. I am an amateur pianist, fairly talented if I do say so myself, and do what I can to study and research the music I want to play. I have been playing Scriabin for a few years, and have come to appreciate his work quite alot. He had originally daunted me as a composer, I think mainly because he was presented \\"backwards\\" to me, as a strange mystic who saw colors in music. I learned of the latter-day Scriabin first and I heard his later works first. He was alot more than what he became, and for me it is each individual piece that is important, not an \\"ouevre\\". These may be fighting words, but that's what I believe.<br /><br />I can fully appreciate the scholarly approach Ms Lettberg has taken, especially if she has, as one comment says, written a thesis on Scriabin. And I appreciate her taking three years to do this project. But after living with this set for about 4 months now, I have to ask why she did it. It seems that everywhere you look now, in the classical CD world, there's another \\"complete set\\" that's come out. It's as if we're being told that encyclopedias of music (and encyclopedic knowledge) in our life are more important than, well, than music.<br /><br />I can't criticize Maria Lettberg's technical skills. To accomplish something like this says that she is able to play whatever she sets her mind to. But why is it that I feel nothing, or very little, when I listen to a piece  on this CD? It all feels so rushed. It feels like she is just getting through one piece to get onto the other. Yes, I could be projecting my own bias towards a \\"complete set\\" but just the same it's a bias that I've developed because I'm not tone deaf, and I do know how to \\"feel music\\".<br /><br />I'm tempted to say that she's no Sofronitsky, but I find such comments facile. It does a disservice to a live flesh and blood artist to take potshots like that. We have what we have, and at least as a listener, I find it unfair to pit today's musical artist against yesterday's. I'm sure Maria Lettberg has had her own \\"I can't live up to Sofronitsky\\" moments, and such doubts are between her and Sofronitsky, not her and Sofronitsky and me.<br /><br />But aside all that, feeling the music is feeling the music. If she studied him as she has, she must understand that Scriabin would play his own pieces differently each time, ignoring his own written score. It seems to me that here is a composer that allowed for an extreme flexibilty to his own music. I daresay the music itself invites such self-immersion and a variety of interpretations. (Sofronitsky too would not play in the same way twice.) Of course this is but one recording, but it feels so rote. I have to wonder whether Ms. Lettberg, for all her work, might be too much in awe of all she has discovered of Scriabin and thus adheres to an exactness and a preciseness, rather than allowing herself to step back and let Maria Lettberg to play Scriabin's music. Her playing might be valid on paper, but in the end it just feels cold.t. We have what we have, and at least as a listener, I find it unfair to pit today's musical artist against yesterday's.

BUT Christopher Nolan has put together SUCH a good trilogy with these Batman movies. This is a very good and fitting end. It wraps up the series very well. This is for sure a must see. Even if you're not a huge Batman fan, or one at all, I still think this movie has something for you.
B000ODV4IK|5.0|I purchased this item because I lost my original copy in a move. Was very happy to have acquired this one. Information is very precise and simple.<br /><br />Thank you!
B003LQ3YXU|4.0|There are so many iconic references regarding Dr Who  ex: even TARDIS in the NYTimes crossword, that I thought I would watch and see what the draw and attraction is. I have a vague recollection of watching a previous version of the series with seat of the pants costumes and sets.<br />I did enjoy the first two in the series and will come back for more, but with space in between. The science fiction is outlandish, and of course, the time travel genre allows even a simple story line multiple layers of meaning.<br />Overall, the humor was fun even if a bit gory or macabre at times.

B008G3N71W|5.0|Chloe Thurlow has written one of the most brilliant pieces of full length erotica I have ever read.  It is also one of the most disgusting. This is not a romance.  There are secretions, sticky and sour-sweet, sweating, and odors.  The sex here is real and physical, biological.  It is not the frilly love scenes with innuendoes instead of description.  It is shameful how arousing it was, but this is not porn.  This is erotica with style.  The first 3/4 of the book reminded me of The Story of O, but for the modern day.  It is filled with BDSM, restraint, whipping, humiliation, and a lot of sex. The last quarter is human pony play.<br /><br />Greta is a failing actress about to turn 20.  A simple phone call changes her whole world.  Richard shows her how to be her best self.  Her adventure is one of self discovery, and she finds true freedom in surrender.  She has many encounters with strangers, reveling in her wantonness.  At first she thinks of it as playing a role, being someone else, but then she realizes that all the time before was the role and now is the real her.  The story is filled with her inner monologue and she really grows and develops as a person and a performer.<br /><br />At no point did it feel like Greta was being abused.  She was into it the whole way, even sometimes not realizing what she needed until it was halfway over.  There is some caning and whipping and other rough stuff but it never even skirted the edge of rape.  There was never any doubt that Greta loved it.  If you feel very strongly negative about bodily fluids, this story might not be for you. This book was intense and I would suggest it to all lovers of BDSM, pony play, and edgy erotica.  It wasn't shocking for shock's sake.  It all served a purpose and helped Greta be the woman she was meant to be.  You may be embarrassed by how much you enjoy it.<br /><br />I received a copy of this from the author in exchange for an honest review.

B000SGGUWS|4.0|I am in my 40's and hate to admit I watch the TV show - seems I shouldn't watch a show about high school girls, but it's really good! So I bought the first book to learn more of the background that you don't see on the show. I really enjoyed reading it. I'll probably try to get through the whole book series.

B00B2QG3K2|4.0|Love Paramore, didn't like the lyrics so much for this album as I have others. I'm an English major, so Haley's continuous use of double-negatives grinds on my nerves. But other than that, a fun listen.
B00870ZH3U|2.0|The music isn't aweful, but it's not great. The setting is very interesting but seems awkward at best. The story is strange and for those of us who know the story, not  the fanfic, it's a bit impossible.ok, completely impossible. on the other hand we are all pleased to find out that raoul is still a prick! the phantom . . . is still no better. the voices are lovely but the score leaves much to be desired. all in all, it's a bad telling of a dreary story that is not really broought to life. there's only so much mundane one can put into a synopsis.
B00A4FOWYQ|4.0|Tegan and Sara didn't tickle my music nerve as much on this CD. It's more dance-y than I'm used to with them, and it gets boring really quick. Not to say that if the music was mixed into a playlist that I'd skip the tracks. By itself though, it doesn't pop out.
B000GCFBQU|4.0|A fine novel but since I read it after the Burgess Boys it paled in comparison.  Still, I would recommend anything written by<br />Elizabeth Strout.

Unfortunately, every subsequent book has been a pale imitation, and effectively a rehash of his time in PNG.<br />Overall, there is very little genuinely new material in this book, and as much as it pains me to say, it is boring. I stopped reading it half way through.

B007V2WAR6|5.0|This movie is a real representation of a heroin addict. It's right there with &#34;Requiem for a Dream&#34; in terms of stunning portrayals of strung out dope feigns. Humor is satisfyingly thrown in through out the movie. Just watch it. Some will love &#34;Trainspotting.&#34; And some will hate this movie.
B002NNA9N0|5.0|Besides being a terrific (though sad) commentary on our times, this movie beats the stage production in that there is an additional character that really helps with both background and moving the plot forward.  Love the play, love the movie.

0061353248|4.0|Mr. Ariely has written a book that will explain to you why you make some of the purchases that you do and the rationalization that goes on in your mind when you make them. It is an interesting study of the thought process that occurs when we are presented with choices in life. The \\"anchor price\\" explanation was most interesting to me considering I have seen the price of a bottle of soda go from $.10 to $1.50 or more in my lifetime and how difficult that is to reconcile in your mind when you are buying it. The book gets a little tedious in spots but, overall, is a worthwhile read. I would recommend it to anyone in a marketing or economics class. It is a good read regardless if you are a student or not.
140006922X|5.0|I'm rating this book based on the quality of Reza Aslan's writing, and the amount of effort and care he has it into his books, including this one. I rarely write book reviews, but having seen a flood of one-star reviews with little more content than quotes and extracts of an op ed that featured on a Fox News site a couple of hours earlier, this is most disappointing, as I'm now convinced few of those reviewers are motivated by objective literary or scholarly criticism.<br /><br />For what it's worth, I found the book a good read, and am now planning on buying and gifting a copy of this book for each such one-star review.<br /><br />In an interview, Aslan was quoted as saying that it's possible to follow Christ when not a Christian, just as its possible to claim to be a &#34;Christian&#34; and not follow Christ. It saddens me that so many rushed to prove that point true.

I was disappointed after I bought another Kindle and the other puzzles were locked, even thou when I purchased the remaining puzzles, it said it was multi-device.

B00BRUQ7ZY|1.0|This book sucks. It is an opinion of a Muslim trained mind, not an objective piece of investigative history. COMPLETE TRASH.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I tried the lite version and only a few days after I used it I knew I had to buy the full version. The potential combinations of sounds is wonderful. Spent many a night carried into wonderful sleep by this app. Recommended for sure.
B00CO6QGCE|5.0|I downloaded this to replace my \\"not working on my kindle\\" Fire DJ app and couldn't be happier. Nice big graphics, intuitive interface - and simple crossfading between the two virtual turntables. The only complaint I might have is that it takes a while to get a file to start to play. I suspect that this is so the graphics showing the turntable's tonearm/needle moving in to place can look cool (and it does!) but you do have to learn the timing in order to get things loaded in time!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I had never heard of this book until it was recommended to me by Amazon. I figured I would give it a whirl, and holy crap am I so glad I did. This book is wonderful. The dialogue is authentic and witty, and the relationships between the characters are deep and emotional. SPOILER ALERT----The book does focus on sexual abuse, and it is very emotional but done is such a beautiful and poignant way that even though the story deals with something very ugly, you are left with a beautiful after glow. I am not doing this book justice, just read it, and I am almost positive that you wont be disappointed. Seriously.
B004UPANGM|4.0|Enjoyable, funny, over the top gore entertainment. Definitely recommend watching all 3 movies in the trilogy; Evil Dead, Evil Dea2 and Army of Darkness.
B003G4W49C|5.0|This book was amaze I loved it. There was a lot of surprises I can't wait to read the next book in the series.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|We enjoyed every moment.<br />As with most of the british series.you never know what will happen next,and the ending is completely unexpected.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Fun, Fun, Fun for everyone. I like the variety of moves in the game.  We had the whole family trying on their turn.
B007PT1PEY|5.0|Sir Arthur's work stands the tests of time.<br />I read these stories as a kid and they are the main reason I  enjoy this genre so much today.<br />Reading them again is like being in a time machine... If I knew then what I know now...
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Fun, Fun, Fun for everyone. I like the variety of moves in the game.  We had the whole family trying on their turn.
B004LROMWU|2.0|The first season was a tough one to get through.<br /><br />The DVDs are of excellent quality however the show itself leaves much to be desired.  We see the aftermath of an alien invasion where we lost and are doing a guerilla warfare on the aliens.  Aliens roam around creating slaves of the young ones.  But the story is mostly focused on the internal struggles of the humans and the historian who acts as an ad hoc leader.<br /><br />The stories are plodding; the action is nearly non-existent; the characters are cookie-cutter and hackneyed.  Don't really care for any of them.<br /><br />I heard Season Two is better.  We shall see.
B004MC8CA2|3.0|When in range of WiFi, it is excellent.  Not available without WiFi.  Wish it could be downloaded to view at all times regardless of the access to WiFi.
B008XKSW7M|2.0|Good laugh for moms and expecting moms. Didn't get \\"Murphy\\" character reason for being stole model to the dad group though.
B00821OX98|4.0|I like sci-fy so I naturally like this show.  It is too bad that the show starts after the fall of the Earth's armed forces encounter.
B008IYR2BA|5.0|I love Dexter so much and am so sad this is the last season. I had to watch a couple episodes on Amazon to go because it was no longer on on demand. I highly recommend watching all of the seasons.
0984380213|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  While I don't necessarily agree with every item in the sales process they describe it certainly helps generate ideas about establishing a modern sales process.  I also benefited from a few of the overall management/ceo tidbits it provided.
B008XKSW7M|5.0|Nice to watch especially when you're trying to get pregnant or are pregnant. Definitely a girlie movie but super cute.
B009HQ9UHC|3.0|Okay to put it  bluntly, I FREAKING LOVE BAD PIGGIES!!! But the Kindle Tablet Edition, well, uh, just let me put it like this. IT IS MESSED UP. Let's just think what Amazon and Rovio were thinking. &quot;I know how to become super popular! I'll simply make a Kindle Tablet Edition of bad piggies and exclude Rise and swine and Road Hogs! And if anything fails, we'll include the Field of Dreams, and sell it for 2.99! Brilliant!&quot; Yeah... smart thinking, you two.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|My husband and I loved this movie. Great action and ties in all the avenger characters nicely. Can't wait for Avengers 2.
B00B7ERH04|3.0|Starting  today, I have decided to make a top ten worst apps ever list.<br />Now remember this when I say this: This is just my opinion. The apps on this list will have no higher than a three-star rating. So without further ado, let's get started. Okay, I know that a lot of people hate this app, and some of  you may have had similar problems that I had. So #10 is the Funtastic Camera. This app is mainly on the list because of the fact it wouldn't let me do videos, despite the fact it has a video mode. So this application, brought to the Kindle fire from Making Art Studios, this is bad. Real bad.
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|This is a powerful movie and kind of makes u never want to fly again. Denzel is an amazing actor and this a must see.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I can't belive I love this crazy game. I can't get enough. The different levls keep you wanting and wanting more.
B0054SMID0|5.0|I really liked this movie. The whole story line was great and I liked how everything tied together at the end. I would recommend seeing this.
B009WUBERW|3.0|It was entertaining.  I don't feel as though I wasted my money and it killed some time on a weekend.
B002ZM74Y6|5.0|Scorcese's finest piece of work. It's unbelievable that this film did not win the Oscar for best picture.  Joe Pesci is magnificent as Tommy, and provides so many memorable moments both funny and appalling.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|So far I am loving this game it's so cute &amp;sweet . I think there should be many more games like this one because this is wicked cool . I love it.
B00B99KJR0|4.0|This game is very fun and also addictive. It can be frustrating at times when you get close to reaching a 3 star score to complete a level and pass the time needed but I guess that's what makes it fun. Very good FAOTD!
140006922X|1.0|Media reports have introduced Aslan as a \\"religion scholar\\" but have failed to mention that he is a devout Muslim.<br /><br />His book is not a historian's report on Jesus. It is an educated Muslim's opinion about Jesus -- yet the book is being peddled as objective history on national TV and radio.<br /><br />Aslan is not a trained historian. Like tens of thousands of us he has been formally educated in theology and New Testament Greek.<br /><br />He is a bright man with every right to hold his own opinion about Jesus--and to proselytize his opinion.<br /><br />As a sincere man, Aslan's Muslim beliefs affect his entire life, including his conclusions about Jesus. But this is not being disclosed. \\"Zealot\\" is being presented as objective and scholarly history, not as it actually is--an educated Muslim's opinions about Jesus and the ancient Near East.<br /><br />\\"Zealot\\" is a fast-paced demolition of the core beliefs that Christianity has taught about Jesus for 2,000 years. Its conclusions are long-held Islamic claims--namely, that Jesus was a zealous prophet type who didn't claim to be God, that Christians have misunderstood him, and that the Christian Gospels are not the actual words or life of Jesus but \\"myth.\\"<br /><br />These claims are not new or unique. They are hundreds of years old among Muslims. Sadly, readers who have listened to<br /><br />interviews on NPR<br /><br />, \\"The Daily Show,\\" Huffington Post or MSNBC may pick up the book expecting an unbiased and historic report on Jesus and first century Jewish culture. (I will let my Jewish friends address Aslan's statement on MSNBC that, \\"there were certainly a lot of Jewish terrorists in first century Palestine.\\")<br /><br />As a journalist and author who is Christian I cannot imagine penning a so-called objective biography of Muhammad and then concealing my conflict of interest in national media interviews.<br /><br />In world history there are no religions more violently and anciently opposed than the crusading, fighting, at times blood-shedding rivals of historic Islam and historic Christianity. Even non-violent Muslims and Christians, like Aslan and myself, understand that we hold aggressively oppositional views--particularly about Jesus. National news coverage of \\"Zealot\\" has ignored this conflict of interest.<br /><br />\\"Zealot\\" is written with the self-assumed authority of groundbreaking revelation from a historian. In reality, it is a religious person's opinion about Jesus--from an adherent to the religion that has been in violent opposition to Christ for 1,400 years.<br /><br />Aslan informs us that we cannot trust the Gospel of Mark--because it was written 40 years after Jesus' death. He then chides us to trust his new book, written almost 2,000 years later.
B005544TRQ|5.0|I enjoyed every episode.Watching the whole season at my convenience with NO commercials was much appreciated.<br />Did I mention it's FREE to Prime Members which of course I am.Getting started on Season two now.
B007NU54H4|5.0|My daughter loves Tinkerbell and this one didn't disappoint and I especially love that it has the 30 minute bonus of the Pixi Hollow Games on it.
B00B81B0HC|5.0|Gave this album a shot and so glad I did! Smooth flowing from start to finish. IMO, it's a mix of Coldplay meets Foo Fighters meets Matt Kearney. This is their debut album? I can't wait for more. Well done!
B00C90T4QK|5.0|As always this is another great CD by Michael Buble. A nice mix between old classics song and some new soon to be favorites ones too.
B005HEDI3K|5.0|A must see for any human on earth. If you havent seen star trek the original series youre truly missing out.
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|I like Draw Something on the Kindle Fire HD because I can use a stylus.  It sometimes gets pretty difficult to draw with your finger on the iPhone (probably could have used a stylus there too but didn't have one).  The only draw back is that whenever I use the Kindle Fire HD and submit a draw I get a notice that &#34;it appears that you are using two sources of technology for this game&#34; and &#34;please try to use only one source of technology when using Draw Something&#34; so will probably go back to using my iPhone for that reason.
B00003CXDV|5.0|We are a Star Trek and star war family.  This parody was great.  The whole actor/actress area were great.  It has comedy and some suspense.
B008YKGQR4|4.0|I like the full version of Full Facebook on the Kindle, it's better than what's on my iPhone, however it's very slow and jumpy.  I think I'll probably continue to read Facebook on my iPhone and iMac for that reason.
B003YWPN08|5.0|This movie shows so much. What  a few power hungry people can do.  What happens when countries don't communicate.  How a few errors can really mess up.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I have this app on my iPhone and have gone through it pretty quickly, so now I just &#34;re-do&#34; the puzzles!  I was so excited to get this app on the Kindle HD because of the enlarged size and the help of using a stylus.  Very great puzzle game and now more exciting in full size!
B004FUPK6U|4.0|Let's get right to the heart of it. Underneath all of the creepy skeletons and demonic withes, this is a movie about love.  A master's love for his trade.  A father's love for his daughter.  A husband and wife standing amidst a storming abyss.  Dario Argento may work in the horror genre, but his cinema speaks to a deeper emotional current, one that so-called modern-day &#34;auteurs&#34; seem unable to reach.  This film seeks to top even Suspiria in its bizarre blending of the macabre and the erotic, yet it is ultimately marred by its wild stabs at random horror and a meandering plot.  Watch this film for what it could have been, not for the exciting yet directionless slab of horror it unfortunately becomes.
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|I always use google search so it was a no brainer to put in on my new Kindle Fire HD.  Wouldn't use any other search engine ever!
B000SVZIDA|5.0|This movie is one of my absolute favorites, I always want to watch it again and again. Until now I couldn't because none of the online streams worked right. But now I own it, Bwahaha!!!!!
B009NY43NY|4.0|This book was good! When it reached a climax I thought it was over and the rest of the book would be fluff. Nope it had many climaxes and kept me reading. I am, however, disappointed in the ending. If this is in fact the last in the series it could have been better. But overall a great book for the series!
B00DRPVE3M|2.0|If they advertise it as free it should be free.  Not having to buy tokens to play.  If I wanted to buy  tokens I could go to the arcade.
B00BSBXZDY|5.0|We watched this with my four year old son.  It was beautifully done.  I hadn't read any of the books the movie is based on and I had no idea what to expect.  There is a little darkness at times but it didn't go too far and I felt it was appropriate for my little one.  We really liked the story and will probably be looking to purchase this for our collection in addition to checking out some of the books.
B00632HWOG|4.0|Yahoo mail is kind of a standard so it's easily accessible on any system.  I don't love the way the emails are displayed on my Kindle, but it's okay.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is totally awesome .the moment  I saw this game I knew I would love it. Trust me I know what I am talking about
B007XKEY6Q|2.0|Previously i would have given this app 4 stars (needs more words was my only complaint.)  However with this latest update i am knocking it down to 2.  Suddenly i can no longer send drawings to someone if they are in the same house as me (same ip.)  We get an error that says &quot;oops, it looks like you are trying to play on more than one device.  Please only play in one device.&quot;<br /><br />It then acts like it sends the image but the other person never gets it, and when you restart the still it acts like it is still your turn.<br /><br />If anyone else is having this problem, we've gotten around it by logging out when we send an image to someone in the same house.  Annoying.<br /><br />Ok, first of all, is it really that uncommon for there to be two people, each with their own device, in the same household, who want to send drawings to one another?  I mean at one point when i was visiting family there were six of us under the same roof all playing.  With this new update we couldn't do that.<br /><br />Second, honestly?  Even if someone were &quot;cheating&quot; at this game by playing in two tablets at once, what is the worst that happens?  They can use more colors?  They view twice as many of the ads?<br /><br />Seriously, get rid of the lame ip restriction.
B0035HKWM6|4.0|I like Jim Carey's movies and I this one is a great movie. I can't wait to see it again.
B0049J2BSM|5.0|Great movie for the kids and for grown ups.  Excellent animation and voice acting.  Snoogly bear is probably the best monsterific character ever.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This game is a lot of fun for all ages. I would highly recommend it to people that love horses.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Loved the book. Couldn't put it down. I hated the ending. Just wish it had a better outcome. If the ending was a &#34;happy&#34; ending I would have given it 5 stars.
0425263924|2.0|I enjoy reading series books....... This one, not so much.  I was excired for this one to come out and even preordered it.  I understand cliff hangers.....make the reader want more.  But usually a book gives closure at least.  This book did not.  I feel like the author was just trying to sell another book instead of satisfying the reader,  in this case that plan might have just backfired.  I will not be purchasing the next book when it comes out.
B000HWZ4CA|5.0|We have been wanting to get this video for some time and once we did we were not disappointed.  As believers ourselves, we just love the way this true story was put together.  It is very encouraging as it took great faith for the real Sergeant York to accomplish what he did and to see his humble attitude after the fact was really refreshing!
B0000024ZT|5.0|I love Bruce, but I had too many items on my wish list, so I had to delete items. I made a second list, but can't get items to go to it, even when I pick the second list. It's impossible on the kindle fire HD.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is a awesome app the levels are easy in the beginning and then they get harder so if you like challenges like I do you should get this app
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I downloaded this for my 5 year old and he LOVES it!  Challenging enough to keep him engaged without discouraging play.
B005D0RDKW|5.0|Rush is always awesome, and this concert video is no exception.  Sound quality was great, excellent song list, video quality was great.  I bought 3 of them to give to friends as birthday gifts and was well worth it.
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|Wish the lives would come quicker &amp; more coins 4 better scores but it's so worth it I like the special moves too....having to use gold to buy extra moves is a bummer tho
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|The only reason I gave it a four star is I had to wait for several months to be free with Prime.
B003Y3ZTGA|4.0|This is a great CD! I love Katy Perry and I love most of her songs too! Her songs are upbeat and fun to dance and sing along to! :)
B005S9EJ14|5.0|I first thought I wouldn 't like it, but got into it quickly thanks to the superb cast, and the storyline. I would recommend that one see it more than once, use the subtitles to catch all the fast talking and muttering and enjoy the message there for all of us.<br />I advise anyone who has retired or is thinking about it, to see this and do some rethinking. Not, to move to India, but to get a better grip on what it's all about.<br />great film
140006922X|5.0|I would first like to comment on the negative reviews here...it is obvious that these people are only here to attack Reza Aslan and not actually provide a review of the book. Whether you are religious or not, you cannot deny the quality of writing and research that went into this book (2 decades!).<br /><br />I urge you to read this book regardless of the negative, purely destructive reviews from close-minded bigots. You will find that it is so well-constructed, so well-informed, that you absolutely cannot put it down. In fact, if you read Aslan's note in the beginning, he discusses his love and admiration of Jesus, not hate. This book is not intended to crush Christianity, in fact, it is only intended to show us a truer side of Jesus, one that I have done my own research and have found it difficult.<br /><br />I applaud Aslan and his book. I truly mean it when I say that this is the best book you will read this year. Please do not listen to bigots or negative, close-minded people.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Loved the plot carrying from the proposal of Matthew to Lady Mary on thru to the birth of son, and the shocking end of the season. It has enough storyline and subplots, that one would want to watch it over several times for what was missed.<br />Anyone who has Brit ancestors or even friends would love to watch this development of the class system.
B00BJ9VBLI|4.0|This match three game is challenging enough to keep my interest but not so challenging that it frustrates me.  I like that I can play without the timer.  I play games for relaxation and I trust the quality of Big Fish Games.
B005TBWN0K|1.0|Do not get this app unless you don't mind installing Evernote, the app where it states in &quot;permissions&quot; that it can and will record audio (outside noise) I read this is exactly a sign when an app will probably find your information and sell it to hackers That's my two cents.
B00CWVG1Z8|1.0|this sucked i couldent watch it for nothing my xbox 360 was haveing compications would cool if got a refund because move took 6 hour to watch not what i was expecting
B0063IH60K|4.0|This is okay but there is no option to close it when you are done so when you hit the back button to try and exit, it just moves you backwards.  You have to go to your main page for it to close.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I thought that the gqme wqs fun and challenging. It made you think and problem solve without needing to be a rocket scientist.
B0066WJLU6|5.0|I love this app.  It is a bright LED light that lights up the whole area you are looking for.  Used it on a non-lighted street on a country road to get home from a neighbors.  Great appl.
B004UID2LC|1.0|Do not get this app it runs like a virus and it also crashed my kindle I had to restart it twice and the last update caused all of this because all of my Anit-virus protection programs detected it as MALWARE so trust me do not get this app
B006X5L6VS|5.0|Wanted to find a star gazing app for my husband's phone.  He loves being able to view the sky and see the planets with the names.
B001DHXT2U|1.0|I'm am very unpleased with this movie it only works in a computer not a DVD player.<br />This will be my last time I will buy anything from you. I have brought item from Ebay an was<br /> very well please. I am sorry but unless this is made right I wont be back
B00CTKHXFO|1.0|What was the point in offering a collection when Metal Gear 1 was not going to be on the Disk? My fault for not reading the fine print but its still useless in my opinion. All the games should have been on disk otherwise it doesn't really seem like a collection. Waste of money.
B003UYV08E|5.0|It is a great movie.. works great in my DVD player..and me an my family truly enjoyed the movie..thank you
B00B0X4PIO|3.0|After Hosseini's first two books which were so wonderfully written and in which the stories were so horrible, I found this book a little bit dull. Don't get me wrong, the book is also well written and the stories that are told are all meaningful, it's just that it seemed to be a little bit dull compared to his previous two books. It's still a good read, but don't expect it to be as emotional as his first two books.
B00005JPS8|5.0|My family an I truly enjoyed this movie and the price was great. I thank you for a wonderful movie.
B00004Y5A8|5.0|If you are a Bowie fan and you haven't heard this, consider it an absolute MUST HAVE. It's a stunning live set to a small audience. The versions of Wild is the Wind, Absolute Beginners and Seven are absolute standouts. Every track on the disc is a credit to Bowie's ability to spin new twists on his legendary back catalogue. I'm not so fond of the Let's Dance era Bowie but how he brings this track on is pretty amazing.
B009YP9L7U|3.0|The story is predictable but it was a good pass time to read. Fun and some dialogue are just made to keep you stuck with it until the end.
B009WUBERW|4.0|Just like the first one, there are lots of your favorite stars.  Just like the first one, they do the impossible.<br />But it is still entertaining.
140006922X|1.0|There is absolutely nothing new in this book apart from the fact that it has, for some strange reason, managed to become an Amazon bestseller despite its disingenuousness. The author is a devout Muslim, though that fact seems to be avoided for some reason. In this book, he has merely scribed the 1,400 year old Islamic party line regarding Jesus under the guise of \\"new research.\\" So, as a new \\"take\\" on the person of Jesus, this book is useless. If it is presented as the discovery of some new knowledge about Christianity, then it is a lie taking advantage of the gullibility of the de facto dhimmi of the media and the left. I have no problem with the author holding his own beliefs. Certainly, the book does serve a purpose by exposing more of the core beliefs of Islam and the unabashed willingness of even the most \\"modern\\" Muslims to practice \\"taqiyya,\\" or lying to promote Islam. When the wolf laughs with the rabbits to discredit the tiger, it's only to eat them over the tiger's corpse.
B007URVZJ6|3.0|Pretty detailed if you're converting a Word manuscript into whatever format Kindle requires, not enough information if you are trying to make a picture book. (Maybe they have a separate book for that, I don't know.)
B004P8JPS6|5.0|It caught your attention and held it.  Jack Reacher is a great character and fascinating story.  I recommend this anyone.
B005544TRQ|5.0|We're glad this was available on Amazon, because we had missed several episodes.  Great actors, a really fun and interesting show.
B0041KBWM0|5.0|Best version of EMMA yet ..definite must see .. Johnny Lee Miller does an excellent job as Mr Knightly and the costumes are beautifully designed
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this game is fun for the whole family. from the littlest to the biggest we all had a great time.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|Straightforward to use and does what it's supposed to do straight away. A gentle wake up alarm tone and a googd snooze option. I recommend this app.
B008Y6WMEY|5.0|A little crazy at the end about underground shelters since the end was obviously happening already but with suspended disbelief, OK.
B00BIVN82M|5.0|She is absolutely thrilled when it came to the Mail, we are avid fan of Mr. Buble...in fact we saw His Concert down in Atlantic City a couple of years back!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Can't wait for the next season. This program hooks you and keeps you there. Highly recommend this, if you haven't seen the second season, or to watch it again. Brilliant!
B00003CXRM|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies!! It's funny and entertaining. The music is absolutely fantastic! It’s that old time uplifting spiritual music that doesn’t get enough credit! But, I’m sure that since this movie, this type of music has indeed gained popularity across a variety of audiences. It surly won me over; I loved it so much that I had to research the soundtrack and find out all I could about its’ origin. Very interesting! Anyway, this movie will have you in stitches! I would recommend this to anyone!!<br />Thanks
B008QMMEOE|4.0|Simple and easy to solve. My toddler loved it. Bright colours and different machines make it hours of fun!!! Must have
B0000714BP|5.0|This movie is really funny yet, does have some serious situations. I love the way Noxy dresses in this movie! I think that all 3 actors were great!! Try it! It's a keeper!<br />Thanks
B000RO9VJK|5.0|Great book about \\"How to change Yourself to change the company\\" Good reading for anyone who owns small/medium business or who is going to start one soon.
B00CEQ1HQE|5.0|When I first saw this Lagoona's promo pic, I thought she was ugly.<br />I bought her because I needed her for a project, and now that I have her I realized that I was very wrong. She's so pretty! The brighter colours make her stand out from my other MH dolls. I love the little turtle accessories and the dragonfly earrings. She also has a cute pink flower clip in her hair.<br />I'm glad I bought this doll. (: There will probably never be another Lagoona like her, so I would recommend getting her.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is so fun i love it i love it i love it!!!!! IT IS SO SO SO SO SO SO FUUUUUNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN!!!!!!!!!!  &lt;3 *~*
B001HNE3NO|5.0|A very compelling WWII story. I could not put it down. To say I &#34;love it&#34; is not the proper comment because the subject is hardly &#34;loveable&#34;. However, it certainly was riveting and tells the story of those who suffered under Hitler.
B0031RSBU0|5.0|The story was quite nerve wracking at one point, a real who dunnit detective story. It got 5 stars because it was well written.
1908117230|5.0|i collect good cook/baking books. i have a few macarons books, this is by far the best one among my collection. highly recommend.
B0038AUYKU|5.0|Wallander has great intuition,  I just know even if he's on the wrong track he will figure it out eventually.
B004FRX0MY|5.0|Works absolutely great! I have recommended the app to  others and apparently they are satisfied also. Thank you very much Amazon.
B008XKSW7M|3.0|I didn't really laugh much and thought it was just ok. With all the top stars I thought it would've been funnier.
B00DFFI7K2|2.0|I should have waited for the rental. I missed it in the theaters and got too excited to wait until I could rent it for much less, so I bought it. I've been a big G.I.Joe fan since I was 10 years old ... but this movie was just so cheesy that it was bad all around. There were two or three action scenes that were pretty amazing ... but most the this movie was just set up for fluff & bravado. This movie just wasn't fun. Waste of my time ... I want my money back, and I really don't say that often.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Its good but its weird cuz you dont usualy get to take care of the horse your self so that is like weird but cool
B0094BB4TW|2.0|The app randomly closes out and never wants to stay open. The app completely sucks it needs to be improved.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This app is GREAT for kids and adults. It stimulates young minds and is very interactive. Kids will love it. And....it's FREE
B00127RAJY|4.0|Just love the way she can keep you motivated. It is hard enough to really make you really work for it.
B009MF56GC|4.0|I enjoyed the film and It's always good to see the great action stars in here on one movie.<br />I liked the first one a little bit more. This one was a little campy, but like I said - I liked it.
B006M6NV0M|5.0|What more could you ask for? Well, except more sequels with more appearances by action stars of the past. Definately a must own for any action movie fan.
0061733199|5.0|this book has everything for the survivor.it is the survivors bible. i would def ine tly rec omend it to everyone
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|The new blu ray transfers on these films is excellent. The soundtrack is even better, if you are watching the movie with surround sound, you will not be disappointed. At $35 for the set, the price is irresistable, and you are getting more than your money's worth. Every films has been given the respect and care that they deserve. I am very happy with the great job that has been done on both the transfer quality and the soundtrack.
1412960991|5.0|Just what I needed for designing a qualitative study for my dissertation. I would highly recommend this book to others with similar needs.
B008MEM24S|4.0|Here's the deal: Short but Sweet! Disney has created another great app. Finished in 1 HOUR! Needs more stuff. Don't wanna pay $3.00 for 2 addons. Really want DEI,  though.
0062255657|5.0|Loving the magical/spiritual aspect of this novel. Enjoying the detailed descriptions of the author's memories of his childhood. A short but great book.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Enjoyed the game was challening enough to hold interest.  Not so difficult you get frustrated.  I wish it had been longer but since it was free can't complain.
B0054SMID0|5.0|Great movie<br /><br />Plot development and characters<br /><br />One of the best movies that i have seen this year.<br /><br />Good buy well worth it.
B009M7G1PU|2.0|I've heard a lot of hype about this book for so long, I thought it was going to be breathtaking and exciting and it's just not. It's like reading Downtown Abbey or Jane Eyre (but not as good), and as much as those things may be great, it's not what I expected with a book of this reputation.
140006922X|1.0|Historically inaccurate. Written by a muslim man who sits on the board of a front group for the Repub of Iran.
B00B7Y0206|4.0|I like this app because its easier than getting on the web on my kindle to watch youtube videos.  Sometimes I have to wait a long time for the videos to load and they keep pausing and I can't understand what they're saying when it pauses and plays again and again.  Sometimes I have to remove it from the device and download it again to get the videos to work for me.  I like this app, but it does have its flaws
B000FCKGPC|4.0|Could do without the gratuitous profanity and sex and be a fantastic read. My only complaint with the entire series. Characters come to life, drama and intrigue abound. Hard to put down.
0743529030|5.0|I recommend this book / CD. It is very inspiring and encouraging. Every time I listen to it I get a new burst of energy to continue on with my business or venture. It helps sharpen my ideas and directs my more in a positive way to excel
B00BRUQ7ZY|1.0|If there was a \\"zero\\" start rating, I would have selected that.  This isn't even worthy of one star.  Unless you want to read a Muslim's opinion of Jesus, don't bother with this book.  It contains zero factual history.  It is pure opinion. It is highly probable that Reza Aslan is a Board member of the National Iranian American Council (NIAC).  Not an author I would trust to tell me solid history about anything concerning Jesus or religion other than his Islam.  Don't waste your money.  If you're a Christian, this book is definitely not for you.
B005S9EKCW|4.0|The singers and approach are great, but some scenes and special effects were irksome. I prefer the sparseness and darkness of the stage arrangements on Broadway, rather than the poorly crafted first few minutes, or the overly-colorful scenes of outside monastery. Things that worked well in the understated format of the stage just seem too grandiose in this film. It's just a matter of preference. Both can exist and do. I do feel sorry, however, for those who didn't see the stage version first.<br /><br />It was nice to see the original Jean Valjean playing the abbot! Without him the musical may have never been a success at all.<br />I recommend at least listening to the original Broadway recording on CD before watching the film. The story is totally self-explanatory, and though the book is a huge hefty thing filled with philosophical asides and essays, that might be a good idea for some.<br /><br />I have to say: Hugh Jackman had scared me as a choice for this, because his work as Curly in Oklahoma was so lackluster (and I LOVE Hugh)...but his performance in Les Mis is sterling. Anne Hathaway is gifted and always has been, as a singer, and she did a swell job. Fantine is sometimes a sidenote in the stage version (and afterthought) and she was given the best female role (or in my opinion, she and her director made it into the best role). The young couple was adorable, and the young man/love interest was a great surprise to see, as I had adored him in Pillars of the Earth and Tess of the D'Urbervilles (BBC). We had no idea he sang so well. The young lady who played Eponine was so professional that it almost didn't suit her. She would be a much better live performer...oddly enough. I felt she emoted in a stage style rather than for a good close-up film performance. If you did watch the Academy Awards performance by the cast, she was the best part...and she had the chops and training and poise to sing live that the others didn't have. Many, I'm sure will be dismally disappointed by Russell Crowe's performance as Javert, as was I, but I knew beforehand that he wasn't a singer by any means. I felt mad that he had not been able to turn the role down, most likely. Who could, really? Javert is fascinating and the baritone/bass up to tenor range makes it the most challenging singing in the entire musical. I doubt any actor in Hollywood could have done it well. However, to point out his acting chops: even though he seemed far too depressed and worried about his singing to come across as a good Javert, he did have moments where he emoted the conflict within Javert better than anybody probably ever has. At moments in the barricade scenes, he defined what Victor Hugo was reaching for, and the role took on a 3-dimensional quality that you would never get on stage. The gray areas of Javert and his self-loathing for where he came from are very clear at moments, and I have to applaud Crowe for his acting abilities, given the setbacks. Just remember that Hollywood and British actors have all ruined well-loved musicals callously in the past: Richard Harris as Arthur in the film of Camelot, Vanessa Redgrave in the film of Camelot (who replaced Julie Andrews from the stage version), Even those actresses and actors who have had another voice dubbed-in for them have been very disappointing in the past: Natalie Wood's substitute in Westside Story, or Audrey Hepburn's part-time substitute in My Fair Lady (which also had belonged to Julie Andrews on stage)...even they were pretty lackluster and the director's could have had the pick of the litter instead.<br /><br />Overall, if you aren't hypercritical, I'd say this was better than I'd ever expected....and I'm a meanie.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is fun and addicting, all ages should be playing this game. Download and start playing today, don't wait.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|I normally read action adventure, but what can beat real life. From the very start I was hooked. Having flown as a certified Air Crewman in the USN, I could quickly relate to the crews of the bombers.<br />A fact I didn't know until reading was the Gernan Air Force could not belong to the Nazi Party. They only fought as any soldier would under orders. As you read you'll discover the humanity of a few good men on both sides. I enjoyed it very much.<br />Now back to Dirk Pitt!<br /><br />Just my opinion<br />Larry Bolger
B0028IDXDS|5.0|I bought two of these: one for my daughter and one for a friend.  LOVE the Wubbanub!  My little girl was tiny, so other pacifiers could get lost so easily and fall down into her car seat or furniture.  Not the Wubbanub! I could lay it on her chest while the pacifier part was in her mouth, and she LOVED petting the fur! Also, on the rare occasion that she did drop it, it was MUCH easier to find than a pacifier alone!  HIGHLY recommend!
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|[[VIDEOID:mo3C1XI8YZ9YN06]]Edit:  Yay!  It works now!  Bumping the review up to four stars.  After two days of troubleshooting, I reconfigured it from a Windows 7/Chrome box.  I'd been configuring it from a Mac in Chrome.<br /><br />Girls always tell me, \\"It's not you.  It's me.\\"  Read about my issues with ChromeCast.  Maybe it's not ChromeCast.  Maybe it's me.<br /><br />I bought one today (7/25/13) at Best Buy.  They thought I was making it up, until I showed them a picture from another BB store. Then they went on a 20 minute treasure hunt for it, so that was fun.  We all cheered for the guy who found it and I put in a nice word with the store manager.<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Small.<br />-Looks cool.  Has an LED to let you know when it's powered up and ready to go.<br />-Easy setup.  Make sure to install the ChromeCast extension for the Chrome browser.<br />-Casting a Chrome browser tab works seamlessly.<br />-Works seamlessly with YouTube, in Chrome (Win 7, Mac).<br />-Three months free Netflix makes the price a no-brainer.  (Oops, MADE the price a no-brainer.)<br /><br />Cons:<br />-I have not been able to get it to work with Netflix.  I've tried casting from iPhone, Win 7, Mac, and Kindle Fire HD.  The Netflix optimized playback in Chrome and the stand-alone apps all connect to ChromeCast, but report a generic \\"having trouble\\" error.  You can tell because ChromeCast switches to a Netflix background.  It knows you're trying to play Netflix.  I've reported the error to Google and hopefully they'll fix it.<br />-Instructions aren't helpful.  It's two pages of setup and ten pages of legal/warranty/license stuff.<br />-The HDMI plug bends easily.  I bent mine a bit removing it, after I wrote this review.  Don't man-handle this device.<br /><br />Neutral:<br />-Requires USB power for my TV bought in Dec 2012.  Comes with a nice little USB power cord and plug, if no USB power is available on your TV.  People complaining about this are looking for an excuse to complain.<br />-Chrome browser casting works, but loses resolution.  Other reviews have pointed out casting a browser tab is at 720p, not 1080p.  I'm casting from one identical 24\\" monitor to another.  The ChromeCast screen is noticeably fuzzy.<br />-Casting a Chrome tab redirects the volume to the new tab.  For example, when I cast Pandora, the songs are no longer heard on my Win 7 box.  I'm sure this is by design.  Struck me as interesting.<br /><br />Overall:<br />-I'm disappointed.  If even one of the four devices worked with Netflix, I'd give it four stars.  Don't hop on the bandwagon, just yet.  Fix the Netflix issue.  Add Amazon Instant.  I'll hold on to mine, until it works as advertised.  With the three months of Netflix, I'm out like $15.  No big deal.
B009WUAK2M|4.0|Crazy a** movie. Great cast and chemistry. Better than the first film. I am a big fan of 2.5 star flicks (on the street reviews) and this has a lot of 2.5 star action. Note: I watch them. I am no critic or arm chair student of film.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I haven't had a problem with the game at all. It works great. I like these type of games. I don't have anything bad to say about kg at all.
B000FC1GJW|3.0|Not for children or anyone who may even remotely question their faith.  I remember this series being called &#34;blasphemous&#34; and was confused because the first book was rather vague regarding theological issues.  I'm enough of a scifi geek to &#34;explore other worlds&#34; where God is seen differently, but the remaining books (especially as the story progresses) could easily confuse or corrupt a young person.<br /><br />Not &#34;devil worship&#34; or anything overtly evil involved, but the author clearly has some issues with &#34;higher powers&#34; and parents should be STRONGLY cautioned.
B009KWU6Q2|4.0|This is an amazing classic tale starring Robin Williams. It was a favorite of mine and now one of my sons.
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|It actually is  a well written and acted movie. All of the actors hold their own and they did deserve their award nominations .I highly recommend it!
B00466HM28|5.0|Title says it all. If your on the go or have a low budget, the Akai MPK Mini will get those notes laid down!  Only thing I wish it had is a pitch/modulation control but other than that, the pads are where it's at in my opinion!  its the sacrifice you get for having the pads, otherwise don't be cheap and cough up another $125 and grab the MPK 25!!
B00CW665VI|5.0|Amazing!!!! You'll not want to miss this book. Written entirely from the male POV, it is immensely entertaining,ultra hilarious and an absolutely super romance.
B00CKJ2KK2|5.0|I have been playing since 2012 till 2013.And I got to say good graphics and pictures nice job Game loft<br /> company.
B002BSHWUU|5.0|These recordings sound great!  I love to blast my b&w speakers and listen to the Beatles!  Since they've been remastered, the sound just comes alive.  Also is the fact that they are the Parlaphone recordings. This is how they were released in the U.K. I just love it!
B005OK721G|5.0|Ms Saldana put her thing down... This is a must have...  I also love the fact that I rec'd this item quickly.  I will shop with this seller again
B00BETX5PS|5.0|Loved it:)  Had a few pacing issues but even though I loved Casino Royal, I could tell the producers of Bond were trying to go a different route with it.  Quantum solidified that even further from Bond.  But I think the producers finally,y realized that Bond has to be Bond and without spoiling the movie I will leave it at that:)
B009IF8CH6|5.0|I have loved the Big Bang theory since season 1, and this season did not disappoint. I love watching how the characters have evolved over the years.
B00BRUQ7ZY|1.0|This is not a work of history.  This is not a Christian book.  This is a slanderous book written by a devout Muslim looking to tear down the Christian faith.
B0091XEW9M|5.0|Wouldnt mind seeing this go down in America. (Pray my house doesnt receive a drone strike in the name of freedom)
B008P1EWIM|4.0|I have family all over the country and I like being able to flip from where I am to where my kids are to see what kind of weather they are enjoying----or not!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Absolutely love this app! Not only is it convenient, but it has a variety of translations to choose from. Everyday I'm reminded to study my plan. This app truly helps you stay connected with God &amp; His word. To date, I haven't experienced any unexpected crashes or glitches. I've had other apps, but they all fail in comparison. Thank you creators for allowing us to experience God on different levels!!
B009XIXVU6|4.0|Love reading all your books.Very spiritual.I enjoy the culture and foods. Always makes me hungry. The characters are so real. But I had a little trouble tying all the stories together. I don't know, maybe it was just me. You are a beautiful writer...
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I think this is very mind thinking .I love to solve the problem get this game .it's a very tricky game.5stars
B006LSZECO|5.0|SPOILER ALERT: Like many other reviews, I did not like the ending. However, it doesn't make me like the book any less. I just wish the wife wouldn't have gotten away with all that. I wish the husband could have been free of her. But the ending was not poorly written.
B00BH0VSM6|4.0|having read most of Nesbo's Harry Hole series before finally reading the first, I can easily give this a 4 1/2 star (but can't figure out how to make a half star!). Nesbo equals or exceeds Eric Larson (RIP) in holding the reader's rapt attention. his mysteries are without par and The Bat is no exception.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|This book has a great story line. The dog narrator is hilarious. I recommend this book to all dog lovers I meet. It's a quick read because you won't want to put it down. Excellent writing!
B000QRIGLC|5.0|Great book by a great patriot who has been there and done that!!  Every American (even liberals) should read this book.
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|The game is fun and all but crashes from time to time. Somedays it works fine others it crashes midgame.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Watch Downtown Abbey on my long runs on the treadmill....definitely makes my runs so much better, so happy to have found this series!
B002DQLGHU|5.0|My daughter grew up watching Harry Potter, but I never saw it until now. She asked me to watch it with her and it was great!
B007BVOEPI|5.0|I really enjoy it. It's actually less graphic than the books, which is a major plus because I could barely stomach reading them. Yeah, some characters are either missing or mashed up into new ones, but it's still really well done.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|This book was very easy to read. It's actually quite short, so I ended up flying through it. The story is sweet. There aren't many surprises, just more of a feel good, summer read.
B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|Average book, reads like well-written fan fiction.  There was nothing either good or bad about it, just average easy read.
B003G4W49C|5.0|This is an old favourite of mine and has become a classic in the genre for good reason.  Read it, recommend it to all of your friends.
B000VSAEYI|4.0|This pool was a great source of fun for my 3 year old and I until that fateful day when my 40 lb dog decided to jump on it. I haven't even tried finding the hole to patch it as it seems like a daunting task but i would recommend the pool to anyone considering it. It has a lot of room and I like that there's a \\"deep end\\" for my 3 year old but I can keep the other section shallow for my 1 year old. I ended up cutting the slide off to create even more room as my kid didn't really care for it (she's less than adventurous) and we kept it to the side in case we wanted to mess around on it. It seems to hold weight well as I couldn't resist trying it myself just as long as you really blow it up to capacity. The sprinkler worked really well and was an appreciated feature even with our terrible water pressure. My only complaint is the palm tree. It serves no purpose only than to annoy you when it starts to flop over into the pool. Wish i could have cut that off too but it's attached to the main part of the pool so no dice. But, like I said, good fun and worth the price.
0812982622|5.0|When I saw the number of pages and the fairly small print I thought this would take me quite a  while to read.  However, from page one it was riveting and after a  long weekend with a  few flights in between I finished it, unable to put it down. The story is down right fantastic, the pace exciting, the characters endearing and capable of harnessing great empathy, and the writing is an incredible and superbly done blend of English and north Korean propaganda and cultural prose. The author's imagination and his attention to the writing style that makes us feel we are inside North Korea while at the same time you feel lucky not to really be there.  SUPERB < SUPERB < SUPERB! hats off to Mr Johnson. A really well deserved Pulitzer prize.
B004GYOQ6A|4.0|So fun...time goes so fast when you are playing it...it is very accurate - amazing. Really hard to put down.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. The depth of the characters is impressive and keeps the story intriguing.  Chock full of surprising plot line twists.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|The first book in this series was very well written and quite enjoyable.  The 2nd was a little less so.  This final installment had some good points and an excellent plot, but in spots, the writing was poor...amateur, even.  At some points, Collins was too wordy and I found myself glossing over parts here and there.  There were also a few times where I found myself reading a passage and thinking that the wording choice did not fit with the rest of the dialect from the story.  Certain phrases here and there...something Katniss would say that didn't seem to fit in with my understanding of her character.<br /><br />It felt a bit too drawn out in parts, as well.  Unlike the Harry Potter series, where I wanted more...at the conclusion of this final novel, I was glad to be done with the series.<br /><br />Overall, The Hunger Games series was done fairly decent.  But this final novel...I think Collins could have been better.
B009LDMJBU|4.0|After the concert wanted to buy the new record being very much Ramazzotti style you can trust in ,nice Italian music
B0091QS88K|4.0|somewhere between 4 and 5 stars<br />pretty much the entire Dr Panda series is similar (well the ones I've seen in play)
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|Can't wait to read The Only Thing Worth Dying For!! Eric Blehm did great with Fearless!! Definitely worth reading for Spec Op/military enthusiasts!!
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|my view is based on the ipad version, I have only just started with the android version<br /><br />pros - in game currency doesn't feel as annoying as many of the other games I have played - there are in game mechanics that supply you with enough gems for the &#34;can only get with gems&#34; items<br /><br />cons - requires online connection to play
B0042VJ1PI|4.0|I liked the romance and the comedy -love and laughter, you can't beat it. I also like the way it resonates with the TV series
B00BP29SAA|4.0|somewhere between 4 and 5 stars<br />pretty much the entire Dr Panda series is similar (well the ones I've seen in play)
B008AYA7WE|3.0|its the triditional tetrix lol what more else is there to say. poor graphics though. that could use some work
B00C3UUZVE|5.0|somewhere between 4 and 5 stars<br />pretty much the entire Dr Panda series is similar (well the ones I've seen in play)
B0018OHFK0|5.0|one of my top 10 favoret movies of all time. i would recomand it to any one who is an import fan, and loves raceing
B00DAXXO98|5.0|I love politics and intrigue, and this has plenty of both...  If you aren't acquainted with the dysfunctional rules and dynamics of politics and the press in America, however, it'll seem a little like their speaking a foreign language.
B008KE3960|4.0|a new twist on a bloown pop ganw i used to play. fun, love the steatig part of it. good game
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I just love this series!  I Can't wait for the next season.  It is the best show with the best cast!

B00CL68NOG|4.0|very funny . I enjoyed watching Streisand after all these years...She was very funny and looked great. Very good movie
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This is one of the better books I've read in a while. Great setting and quick paced enough that I could read a few pages at a time and still felt like the story advanced.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|This game is amazing and it&acute;s really fun i love this game and i love the wave rider its so fun.
B00AEFYCL4|5.0|Every single day each of us can do at least one right thing, some thing that even in memory and old age will delight us : we can hug our mothers. As he studied and experimented away from home,Michael Faraday, the creator of the first dynamo and hence the first motor, realized his mother was the first and greatest sweetness under the sun. Perhaps as a result of this poignantly tragic film thousands of clueless sons and daughters will come to their senses and call home and hear that voice which is like no other. For all of his piercing insights our inexplicably callous hero missed INSIGHT NUMBER ONE until it was way too late. Insight number two comes from that wise old man who befriended Alexander Supertramp , \\"When you forgive you love and God shines His face upon us.\\"
B004TACMZ8|4.0|a very important tool to use before drill. I need it to not have any mistake. excelent product, works well.
B003YL4LYI|2.0|I am slowly losing interest in the these books. The 1st 2 made me a believer but the  last 2 leaves a lot to be desired.  Cathryn coming back, Brin's attack and  Arya's fate all these twist and turns are making a wonderful plot and story line, tedious and  sad and I am on the cusp of breaking up with the book. That makes me sad. Ah well.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|This game is really fun and addictive. I enjoy playing with real people. I only wish we could play with out tokens. Other than that it is a lot of fun.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|The characters are complex and well developed.  It's an intriguing view into a time period class system few north Americans are aware of and can conceive of.  Draws you back for more.
B0091WD4ZQ|2.0|Good story, good actors; yet a little too explicit for me. I am a romantic at heart and old fashioned person.<br />  GEN
B003TSEL7S|5.0|This book an amazing page turner, another true masterpiece by Rick Riordan. I highly suggest this amazing book. This book will keep you wrapped up until the every end. I love how Rick jeeps up the suspense by changing the narrator at the most exciting part. Well done.
B004S9AK9U|5.0|I could not put this book down. From the very beginning it drew me in. Well written and worth reading.
B005N09L5C|4.0|It was an excellent movie.  However, having just finished the book made it a much richer experience.  I do recognize how difficult it is to adapt from a book.  Overall, 1984 is a classic and well worth the time and energy.
B008KMHFJY|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. It is a light romance that once you've started you can't put it down. Worth a read!
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Love Facebook, you can play game, keep in contact with your family's and friends what more do you need. :)
B0066WJLU6|4.0|The Flashlight LED is very handy since I always have my cell phone at hand. The regular light through the camera flash LED works better than many flashlights. And did I say, it is always at hand whereas flashlights, including keychain lights, are not.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|After down loading this app on my new Samsung Galaxy S4 I couldn't believe it even knew which page I was on in my Kindle tablet. How they do that???
B00B32YK96|5.0|I have seen this movie a few times, but not for some time, loved it really funny and light. Great to see some of theses actors so young, truly a classic to me.
B00821PCJS|5.0|I absolutely love the series and have begun watching Season 3 on TNT.  The suspense is so raveling that I cant seem to contain myself to wait to see what happens next.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I hate writing reviews, but for this show it's worth the trouble. Excellent writing, acting and direction. And Maggie Smith plays a part for the ages.<br />I can't wait for season 4.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I loved this book so much that I'm still not ready to move on to something else. I'm a lover of classic literature- I love the language, the story-telling and the expert writing that makes those works classic. Hossein's work, in my opinion, does not fall short in comparison. He has quickly become my favorite contemporary novelist, and I enjoy each of his book as much as the last. The subject matter and stories within 'And the Mountains Echoes' are no less difficult and tragic than events from his earlier works, but there is something very uplifting about the humanity, emotion, redemption and loyalty that happen in spite of and because of these tragedies.
B000I9YV12|5.0|Tom and Denzel are simply amazing. The movie is a great study in prejudice and redemption. Springsteen's title song is hauntingly perfect. Highly recommended.
140006922X|5.0|Unlike quite a few of the reviewers here, I actually have read Zealot. Aslan is a fine, fine writer, and much of what we teach in critical biblical scholarship comes alive on the pages. I will certainly recommend it  to students and all who want to understand this person, Jesus of Nazareth. There are multiple perspectives at work in the book; I disagree with Aslan in some of his interpretations of biblical apocalyptic and Jesus, but that is a certainly open to debate. I loved the admiration and even affection Reza Aslan has for Jesus. I strongly urge that people get it and read it. It is challenging and very informative. Rev. Dr. Susan Thistlethwaite, Professor of Theology, Chicago Theological Seminary
B007XNTDPA|4.0|In this third book in the wonderful series of criminal law for younger readers, our hero THEODORE Boone finds himself under suspicion for the theft of highly valuable and state of the art computer equipment.  And on top of that, he finds himself the target of some pretty nasty vandalism and implied violence from someone in the neighbourhood.  Fortunately for Theo, he finally gets a chance to explain what's been happening to his family and he gets the chance to think the situation through.<br /><br />Grisham's writing style is once again clear cut and direct considering his target audience and it makes the book a breeze to read and enjoy.  One logical flaw in the series is the lack of growth any of the main characters get to demonstrate.  This is mainly an issue for young Theo.  The books get published in close to twelve monthly intervals and yet it seems that barely a month has gone past in the town in book-time so therefore Theo's reactions and thought processes haven't really changed, or matured.  And yet Grisham's readers' have.<br /><br />Significant moments of a young boy's life, however, are referenced within the narration and feel good moments with a touch of emotion can be found easily.  Naturally young Master Boone finds his way out of the quagmire without too much difficulty and consequently I am glad to award this wonderful book for young readers a very healthy four stars.<br /><br />BFN Greggorio!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Exceptional period piece. Maggie Smith is marvelous. I cannot wait for coming season to see what is in store for the house and village of Downton.
B00AQL8VU4|1.0|This was supposed to install on my tablet, but it's nowhere to be seen. Also, this reply box goes to the top of this page after EVERY letter I type. Wazzup wit dat?
B000SCHC0Q|4.0|Very topical and beautifully written; Hosseini captures the horror of tribal warfare and religous persercution through the life of one family.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|A wonderful, realistic portrayal of teens caught in disease and death, without sugary sentimentality.  The  characters rang true; having known thousands of teens in my career,  that's what often grates on me in many otherwise great novels.  This was wonderful.
B00DU74U74|2.0|I really did not think the script was very good. I was torn out of the movie by bad dialog.
B00821OX98|3.0|I thought it was pretty decent although I wouldn't get all that excited about it. That said, I will continue to watch to see if it reaches it's potential.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|I loved this book! Kept me engrossed from start to finish. Would definitely recommend to anyone who likes all thing supernatural.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Great reading for both teens and adults!  I enjoyed the series as much as the kids did!  Way to go!
B00CLD65X0|5.0|It was marvelous!  So well written.  I got caught up in it and had a Downton Abbey marathon.  I wish there were more like this and I hope season 4 is as good as the previous seasons.
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|Enjoyed this book.  Told from the perspective of a 7 year old boy, it describes friendship and the fantasy of childhood.
B00513DGIO|2.0|Too much filling, it's a short story padded out. Not interestingly written. Couldn't recommend it. Save the trouble and just read a review.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Great graphics especially for free game. Very addictive and fun! Would love more levels though. Would highly recommend to everyone.
B002UM5BXW|4.0|A very well written journey through life in the world of kitchen whites. Simply a great read even if you've never worked the grill
0345803485|1.0|HATED fifty shades of grey.  I stopped reading it almost halfway through because life is too short to waste on a book that is only good for shredded pillow stuffing.  If you want to read a good book try Peyton Place or Pillars of the Earth.
B003PGNBO8|3.0|This series starts with an interesting premise but somehow as the season develops it lost its way.  Too many side plots to really keep the focus on the main premise which is the 2 minutes 17 seconds that are lost in the world at the same time. Some of the action sequences are very reminiscent of Jack Bauer in 24 but not quite as good.  How many times can a person lose fingers if they don't tell what they know?
159562015X|2.0|DO NOT BUY A USED BOOK.  Each new book has a unique code to access the internet, necessary for completion.  I bought the book used from Book Worm and the code was missing.  I did not know about it until I got 1/3 of the way through the book; it was too late to return it.  If anyone wants my worthless copy, hurry because the trash man comes tomorrow.
B00CDV6WDS|5.0|I like the different game, and have enjoyed it very much.<br />the different backgound are nice too.  I like it because it is game anyone can play...
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Well written story line and characters. The acting is superb. The set, the costumes are incredible. Do yourself a huge favor and add Downton Abbey to your queue.
B00BEPVAV8|4.0|I do think that's it an awesome game but it's hard and u don't tilt it, just saying cause I didn't know that, but i do suggest it and it's even better because it's free.
B009NQZVKG|4.0|This book was Not quite a page turner as most of Rollins books are. Slower paced and somewhat disconnected storyline.
006117758X|4.0|I was bored after the first 3 chapters. But I kept going but it was an okay book depending on how you read it. I don't recommend it but give a shot if your eager to read the authors book.
0553106635|5.0|good book, the show game of thrones is based on this.  It took me a while to figure this out.  This one is season 3
B002LC8HF0|5.0|If you have not yet read the book descriptions, don't.  They spoil the endings of the first two books and take away some enjoyment.  Maybe you will be 'saved' by my words.
0553108034|5.0|good book, the show game of thrones is based on this.  It took me a while to figure this out.  This one is season 2
B0026IUXO2|5.0|I've watched this movie maybe 20 or 30 times. I used to have it on VHS and bought the DVD so I can keep watching it.
161383280X|4.0|if you watch the show then this is definately worth the time to actually read the book.  I love it
0812975219|4.0|Good solid book about randomness that let's you see how sometimes people who are successful are just lucky.<br /><br />In our society we look at people like Bill Gates and Warren Buffet as having some secret to success and never consider the fact that with millions of investors someone will rise to the top regardless if they are smarter.  Men like Buffet are seen as successful because they took risks and therefore you are told to take risks and you will be successful.  You are never shown all those who risked in business and investing who failed.<br /><br />My favorite part of the book was the analogy of Russian Roulette and also the end about living with randomness.  The analysis about the book The Millionaire Next Door was excellent as well.  The author also explains how you can set yourself up to succeed through randomness although I wish this were a larger part of the book.<br /><br />The author himself has a very high opinion of himself and can come across as bragging (especially about his extensive education) and that can turn off some readers.  Also remember that he was relatively unknown until he predicted the crash in 2008 but he also could have just been lucky as out of millions of investors someone will always get it right.  The author would agree I'm sure.<br /><br />I enjoyed this book and will be reading other books by Nassim Nicholas Taleb soon.
0553801473|5.0|good book, the show game of thrones is based on this.  It took me a while to figure this out.  This one is season 5 (not showing yet).
B004W1GCNC|5.0|This is a great series.  It has somewhat the feeling of Downton Abbey with beautiful costumes, settings, and interesting plot lines.  LOVE Ed Stoppard.  :)
0606238433|4.0|good book.  If you watch the show, then these are the books to read ahead of the show.  Different show if you read the books!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This is a wonderful series.  The costumes, acting, story lines, everything is amazing! Definitely a MUST to watch.  You will be addicted.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I love that amazon gives this app away free. Too cool that you can read your amazon content anywhere. Thought it would be too small to read on my phone. I Although it is small and you would not want to read a whole book with this, it is great in a pinch. Just nice to be able to access your library if you need to.
B001N4RORE|5.0|The movie was a pleasure from start to finish.  I would recommend to anyone who likes musicals, and Meryl Streep.
B004WR125O|1.0|What a piece of garbage. I wouldn't use this on my worst ememy. Do not buy it unless you have an Onkyo system. It is very limited and a huge waste of money.
B000002KET|5.0|Black Sabbath will always be credited as the originators of the heavy metal genre. Unfortunately, the brummies are rarely given their due as being ahead of their time as well as being excellent composers, arrangers and musicians. \\"Sabbath Bloody Sabbath\\" is far from a straight-ahead heavy metal album and it's interesting to listen to Sabbath albums in order so one can not just hear, but really feel their transition and evolution as musicians and composers. The opening cut, \\"Sabbath Bloody Sabbath\\", one of metal's greatest anthems, comes at the listener like a freight train. Then, once the listener is more or less run-over, the album backs off showing the listener a slower, layered approach in songs like \\"A National Acrobat\\" and \\"Spiral Architect.\\" \\"Fluff\\" is Tony Iommi showing his versatility on the classical guitar. As different as \\"Fluff\\" is from the rest of the material on the album, somehow, it fits. \\"Looking for Today\\". \\"Who Are You?\\" and \\"Killing Yourself to Live\\" have a more textured quality to them. Their arrangements more dense than cuts from previous albums and points the way to future jumps in engineering prowess like \\"Sabotage.\\" Clearly, these guys know their way around a mixing board. What is also astounding is how well they can deliver this material live!
B00000JQ0E|5.0|I have always loved the Red Hot Chili Peppers, but only recently had the urge to listen to them on vinyl.  It is a quality way to listen to a quality band.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|When I first got it I was very confused but now that I know what to do its a great game!
B008XOXGL0|5.0|I had bought this album digitally, but had not thought about buying it on vinyl. Since the artist did not release an official vinyl of it, this was one of the only ways to find this product. I am not disappointed, the sound quality is great and everything works perfectly.

B0042AEOG0|4.0|Continuing my Mariah Carey Album track by track reviews.<br /><br />Merry Christmas II You is Mariah's 12th major studio album (excludes MTV EP, #1's, Greatest Hits) and another underrated gem, though I guess that mostly applies to all of Mariah's albums from 2000 onwards. This album features 4 brand new original songs to go along with holiday classics and medleys of classics.<br /><br />1. Santa Claus is Coming to Town: 23-second melody without vocals to get you in the Christmas mood.<br /><br />2. *Oh, Santa: It has the same message as \\"All I Want For Christmas is You\\", but the melodies are nothing alike except for both being quite upbeat, this one even more so. 8/10<br /><br />3. Little Town of Bethlehem/Little Drummer Boy: Great medley and Mariah really goes for those vocals in the ending. 8/10<br /><br />4. *Christmas Time is in the Air Again: Breezy melodies and vocals and one of the best songs on the album. 9/10<br /><br />5. The First Noel/Born is the King Interlude: The First Noel is silky smooth, but the Born is the King Interlude is the one that really stands out with an R&B vibe reminiscent of her Butterfly album. 8/10<br /><br />6. *When Christmas Comes: Similar in composition to a few songs off of her Emancipation album like \\"Circles\\" and \\"Fly Like a Bird\\". Truly gorgeous. 10/10<br /><br />7. Here Comes Santa Claus: Awesome upbeat number with some R&B-Hip Hope vibes. 8/10<br /><br />8. Charlie Brown Christmas: Short, but lovely. Mariah's vocal here is very reminiscent of \\"The Wind\\" a bit of jazz and very restrained. 8/10<br /><br />9. O Come All Ye Faithful/Hallelujah Chorus (featuring Patricia Carey): This is the opposite of restrained, ridiculous vocals from both Mariah and her mom, a former opera singer and vocal coach who can still sang at over age 70! 8/10<br /><br />10. O Holy Night (Live from WPC in South Central Los Angeles ): There's some confusion with this song, the truth is this was recorded in the year 2000 as opposed to 2010, hence the more powerful full-blooded vocals. 9/10<br /><br />11. *One Child: Biblical story telling with accompanying children's choir. of \\"Christ, the lord\\". Very close to 90's Mariah here, just glorious. 9/10<br /><br />12. *All I Want For Christmas if You (Extra Festive): VERY similar to the original which proves that her vocal demise was greatly exaggerated. This version has a slightly faster beat and a few other minor changes here and there. 8/10<br /><br />13. Auld Lang Syne: Starts out beautifully and then gets perhaps too upbeat and a bit repetitive. There's no doubt that her vocals are impressive though. 7/10<br /><br />Final Album Rating: 8.33<br />*Original songsre powerful full-blooded vocals. 9/10<br /><br />11. *One Child: Biblical story telling with accompanying children's choir. of \\"Christ, the lord\\".

B007EECSFA|5.0|One of the most amazing books I have ever read. It captures your attention immediately and holds onto you until the last paragraph of the book. Kate Morton uses the literacy device of flashbacks to weave the reader between 1941 and 2011. I plan to reread this book to dig deeper into her inner thoughts as an author.
B00AALHW6Y|3.0|I like Durius Rucker and have been a fan for a long time.  But \\"True Believers\\" misses the mark for me, as does much of what's on Country Radio today.

1616551607|5.0|I am still in shock, but lets see if I can manage a quick review.<br /><br />This is probably the best investment in printed media I have ever made. When the package arrived, it felt like it was loaded with bricks. When I opened the package, I got my second surprise: The gorgeous box containing the books themselves. I was under the impression it was a real 'slipcase' from the item description - a circular piece of paper or printed plastic that slid off from around the books. No, it's this big, sturdy case covered entirely with the fabric cover illustration. The case has a tab that opens the side panel which snaps shut well with all three books inside.<br /><br />The books themselves are delightful. Not only containing Amano's most iconic works from 1987 to 2001, the books also have countless character, monster, and location illustrations. The reproduction is gorgeous, to the point where I'm still not completely sure I paid as little as I did for this collection.<br /><br />If I had to lay out a drawback, I would mention that this collection does not encompass Amano's work on Final Fantasy XI, which I consider to be one of his peaks of illustrative perfection. The only other con would be lacking the goodies of the very limited run first edition 'box set', but most of those box sets were snapped up by scalpers and now run for literally 10 times the current price of this item on Amazon.<br /><br />Summary: If you're a fan of Amano's work and would consider one of the many collections available, this set should be the top of the list without question. It is more comprehensive, at a lower price, than pretty much any other on the market.
0743201140|5.0|Must read for everyone who wants to know how to navigate through this very difficult self assessment of one's talents and abilities
B004EPZ06G|4.0|Great sequel to the first movie.  Very similar storyline and humor, which is exactly what you want in a sequel.
B0073HNL3Q|2.0|It's banal and not for adults, for morons with a childish taste. But the narrative structure is not as silly as the style. The writer never really succeeds in being persuasive. I read the first 150 pages. Thank you.
B002ZG997C|4.0|A good movie. Denzel is great in his role, as is Mila Kunis.  Movie can be a bit slow at times, preventing it from being great, but a very good watch and recommended.
B008JFUNYG|3.0|Probably a C+ compared to the A+++ original.  The actors were good and entertaining, aside from all the profanity, which didn't add anything to the movie.  The original was much more scarier without all the language.  As far as the gore, this move was a step up, but not by much.  Of course, the gore is not the standard for a good storyline.  This movie was very dark most of the time, and the characters were more serious.  There was no humor in this movie at all.<br /><br />It's a little hard not comparing the actors in this movie, to the actors in the first movie.  The storyline had some similarities to the first, with some twist and turns.  Ash, played by Bruce Campbell was much more funnier, showed many emotions, and very easier to feel sorry for.  He was perfect to play that part.  I don't remember the name of guy playing Bruce's part, but he was a bit boring.  The girl doing most of the screaming and fighting in the movie was really good.  All and all, it was an okay movie with a lot of gore for those into that.
B0014LRQOW|5.0|In the two-channel SACD mode to which I listened, RCA slightly improved the sound of Modest Mussorgsky's \\"Pictures at an Exhibition\\" with Maestro Fritz Reiner and the Chicago Symphony. The highs no longer sound quite so bright or hard-edged. However, I also happened to have on hand the audiophile-remastered JVC XRCD disc of the same Mussorgsky recording, and I found the JVC smoother still, with a marginally greater depth of image. But that's another story. The differences among the two-channel renderings on the three discs are really so small that I doubt most people would notice them except on direct comparison, let alone care. So I suppose the point is mostly moot unless you really, really love the performance, which I do, and then you want only the very best version of it.<br /><br />The main thing about this whole affair is that Reiner's 1957 interpretation of the Mussorgsky work is still the best one available, each \\"picture\\" an elegant little masterpiece, and RCA's SACD edition has certain advantages over its regular competition. The SACD sounds good in two-channel stereo, with wonderful detailing and range, if not quite so good as the higher-priced JVC. It offers three-channel performance for those able to play it back that way. And coupled with it you'll find the additional goodies that also come on the regular RCA release: Mussorgsky's \\"Night on Bald Mountain,\\" Tchaikovsky's \\"Marche miniature,\\" Borodin's \\"Polovtsian March,\\" Tchaikovsky's \\"March slave,\\" Kabalevsky's \\"Colas Breugnon,\\" and Glinka's \\"Russlan and Ludmilla Overture,\\" all of them filled with the color and excitement you'd expect from Reiner performances.<br /><br />Don't you hate decisions? I'm glad it's not my job to make them for you. But for myself alone, I can't think of a better Mussorgsky Pictures than Reiner's.<br /><br />John J. Puccio<br />Classical Candor

B00499QUK2|4.0|Only 3 episodes per year?  REALLY????  The show is excellent, but surely they can manage more than just 3 per year.  That's just ridiculous, in my opinion.  I would have said 5 stars, but they only deserve that if they do a full set of episodes each season!
B000002URV|5.0|This is the CD to put all others to shame. In my humble opinion, that is.<br />Nothing calms your frazzled nerves, lift your spirits and takes you away quite like Enigma Mxmxc a.D. can.<br /><br />I have yet to find anyone with the skills that Michael Cretu possesses. I have been enjoying Enigma for 23 years. In those years, I have listened to others. While beautiful in their own right, it still doesn't quite reach the brilliance of Cretu's style.  I see him as the true pioneer that others have tried to follow but haven't quite found the recipe as Cretu has. He mixes music from different genres, countries and cultures with sultry sounds, thought provoking lyrics in different languages and Gregorian chants like a true musical alchemist.  His music has managed to break the boundries in order to create his own genre. Not New Age, Rock, Spiritual or Classical but a combination of sounds, voices and lyrics that pull in bits and pieces of these genres into a truly seamless and unique sound.  Each song melts into another without breaking rhythm so the CD ends up sounding like it's playing just one complete song.<br /><br />This 23 year old CD manages to stay high in the rankings which should indicate at what kind of musical genius Cretu is. As of today, 7/24/13, it is #1 in World Dance.<br /><br />This CD starts with 'The Voice of Enigma', a kind of prologue to the rest of the 'story'.  Already, we are given an idea of what to expect from this album. \\"Turn off the lights, take a deep breath and relax\\".  Exactly.<br /><br />'Principles of Lust: Sadeness/Find Love/Sadeness (Reprise) (Medley)' contains some of the most beautiful chants in Latin, highly erotic sound of whispers, sensual beats and French lyrics sung with amazing vocal ability. 'Sadeness': This song refers to the Marquis de Sade, a Frenchman who thought that sex had to be painful if it was to be pleasurable. Hence the term 'Sadism'.  Lyrics:  \\"Sade dit moi pourquoi le sang pour le plaisir ?  Le plaisir sans l'amour.  N'y a t'il plus de sentiment dans le culte de l'homme?  Sade tell me why blood for pleasure?  Pleasure without love.  There is no longer any sense in the cult of man?\\"<br /><br />\\"Sade dis moi, qu'est ce que tu vas chercher ? Le bien par le mal,  Sade dit moi pourquoi l' 'evangile du mal ? Quelle est ta religion ou` sont tes fide`les?  Si tu es contre Dieu, tu es contre l'homme.\\"  \\"Sade. tell me, what do you seek?  Good with evil, the virtue of vice.  Sade tell my why the Gospel of evil?  What is your religion?  Where are your faithful?  If you are against God, you are against man.\\"<br /><br />Given the words, Sade could also be seen as the devil.  The mix of good and evil; virtue, which is a moral excellence; vice, which is immoral wickedness.  What is he looking for?  Does he think that giving pleasure in the name of virtue is acceptable?  He wonders how 'Sade' can give pleasure or give someone joy, yet be against God.  It's a struggle to fight temptation because it is around us every day.<br /><br />'Callas Went Away' is about an American born soprano named Maria Callas.<br /><br />'Mea Culpa',  'An acknowledgment of one's fault or error.'  I'm guilty.  I think she feels guilt because she has given herself over fully to her desires and fantasies.  She asks Christ for mercy.  She feels like she is going crazy for letting herself go &agrave; la fin de ses fantasmes--to the end of her fantasies.  She knows it's forbidden but the temptation is very powerful.<br /><br />'The Voice and the Snake'. This is based upon 'Revelations' from the Bible. Each sentence is a clear link to each angel and their trumpet and what will happen after each one sounds. \\"The Earth turned grey\\". Read Revelations 8:7.  And so on.  This is the one and only song that gives me chills.  It's about how the world will end and this song definitely has a bone chilling sound.<br />Cretu: 'And when the Lamb opened the 7th seal, silence covered the sky'.  Revelations 8:1 \\"And when he had opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour\\".<br />'Knocking on Forbidden Doors';  'Back to the Rivers of Belief: Way to Eternity'/Hallelujah/The Rivers of Belief' is a continuation on the Book of Revelations.  I find this song very soul soothing.  It gives me a sense of inner peace.<br /><br />I liked what someone had said before. That 'Enigma can be about the conflict between our physical and spiritual selves\\".<br /><br />Enigma is my #1 go-to music.  I listen to it almost daily.

B007L3BMGA|2.0|I found this book to be just short of ridiculous. The shame is young women are going to believe that this is how they are supposed to feel.

B0041KXUGQ|1.0|didnt find out til it was too late that the movie was in Italian and i had it sent to my son, who is in a hospital in FL....so it would take more effort to return it than to just buy him one in English
B0046B3QTG|4.0|The movie was great but it had to be reset because the Roku interface is horrid.  Every time we stream a movie we have to reset it at least once; The download speed is fine it's the interface that's the problem and everybody is complaining about.  Please do something!
B001ANSSDC|5.0|This is such a great book. This kind of book doesn't come along very often. However take my advice do not see the movie before reading the book. The movie is good on its own but it's not the book by any means. The book is absolutely fantastic.
B003G4W49C|5.0|From the beginning of this book I was hooked.  What I found incredibly interesting was how the children were used and trained.<br /><br />I would recommend this book to anyone that enjoys well written science fiction.
B00CRWJ5GO|2.0|I know this was about how different generations can affect other generations of the same lineage, But it wasn't tied together in an understandable way. I did appreciate the cinematography and the acting but when you can't really figure out what is going on or how it relates what good is it?
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Love this game! super fun and addictive. The only complaint I have is that it does freeze occasionally, and one time it was on my best run (I am playing on a Kindle Fire). But it's just a game, so no tears here.
B008JJM88Q|1.0|kind of stupid.  glad it didnt cost any money.  some of these free games are just a waste of space.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|They would sit on this for hours! kind of wish there was a time limit!! then it would be perfect
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|It is very entertaining, dramatic, romantic, devious with lots of twists and turns. Excellent drama series that the whole family enjoys. The acting is superb and each character is full developed.
B00BF11STU|5.0|You might think you know it all, and yes Bin Laden is dead. But this lady knows how to direct a film. Its still filled with tension and all the inner workings of govt agencies etc which kept my attention for the length. I wish more movies are made like this.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Quick game, needs more levels! Hints would be nice to. Maybe one level could open onto another another level using what you've previously found.
B002KGEORM|5.0|I LOVED THE SHOW, VERY INTENSE.  I think Jax is the best and I hope he takes over SAMCRO.  Gemma is great
B000641D2Y|4.0|It was a good, healthy, family movie.  Good entertainment.  It is a good show for the whole family to watch together.
B00CDV6WDS|5.0|Has a lot of different formats of the game on it! I am glad I have it on my Kindle!
B007UR1OHO|1.0|I was so disappointed by this movie.  Once again, Hollywood took so much liberty with the story it was hardly recognizable.  My advice:  Skip the movie, read the true story in the book, The Vow.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|Nice to listen to before I go to sleep at night. Is real relaxing and nice to have on my Kindle.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Grandson got me interested in this game.  Great for my aging mind  Anxious for new rooms to open. Love the challenge

B006OAB3ME|5.0|I saw a program about the recording of this cd on PBS and knew I wanted it for my collection.  Am so happy I purchased it
B009MYARIK|5.0|Sophie Kinsella's characters have such natural speaking styles and interactions that she makes it easy to get lost in her writing.  Her books are always a nice escape from reality with characters whose endearing flaws get them into seemingly impossible situations, but like all good romantic comedies, the girl gets her guy in the end.  Thank you, Ms. Kinsella for never disappointing me!
B00CA3C1N4|4.0|Its too tough for me even on easy mode. I ended up losing hard 3 games in a row. Uninstalled from my phone.
B0041SGYVQ|5.0|Although this version of Emma irritated me at times, I must say she is more realistically portrayed in this adaptation. This also makes her more relatable and \\"human.\\" Don't think that I disliked watching it though! I actually adored this overall and think that all the actors/actresses did a splendid job. Definitely will watch it again. A must see!<br /><br />P.S. I loved the \\"daydreaming\\" sequences and also agree with the other reviewers that the dancing scene between Mr. Knightley & Emma is divine!
B00BNGFGIQ|4.0|Unfortunately, I do not love Angry Birds. In fact after the first several levels I uninstalled this game. It wasn't difficult. Wasn't challenging... just ehhhh, with nice rich graphics.<br />Launch your monkey and try to grab all the bannanas, if you miss no problem, you just start over. Search for hidden items along the way and build up your stash.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Nice romantic read with a twist of drama.  It will keep you turning the pages hoping for the hero to save the day.
1446249182|5.0|The author is very silly and has a dark humor; however, he put practical examples and he explains in a easy way. I'm getting an A+in my class :)
B0000064TT|4.0|I like Steve Morse and really wanted a cut of Ice cakes.<br /><br />Love that song, and the rest of the CD is pretty good as well.  Not enough to make me rush out and order up the entire Dregs catalog, but definitely better than average!
B0087JTAKW|5.0|This book lets the reader into the common question of the  meaning of time. Mitch Albom creates an interesting world in which two strangers learn the meaning from very different points of view.
B00CI1TQHM|5.0|This is an absolute must hear! Every song is good. You won't be disappointed. The '80s are on a comeback!
B00D5O7BPU|4.0|I think this app is better than any other weaphone the others don't update it and give u more guns so this is the best app ever
140006922X|1.0|Reza Aslan, author of the new book, \\"Zealot: The Life and Times of Jesus of Nazareth\\" has been interviewed on a host of media outlets in the last week. Riding a publicity wave, the book has surged to #2 on Amazon's list.  Media reports have introduced Aslan as a \\"religion scholar\\" but have failed to mention that he is a devout Muslim.  His book is not a historian's report on Jesus. It is an educated Muslim's opinion about Jesus -- yet the book is being peddled as objective history on national TV and radio.    Aslan is not a trained historian. Like tens of thousands of us he has been formally educated in theology and New Testament Greek. He is a bright man with every right to hold his own opinion about Jesus--and to proselytize his opinion.     a sincere man, Aslan's Muslim beliefs affect his entire life, including his conclusions about Jesus. But this is not being disclosed. \\"Zealot\\" is being presented as objective and scholarly history, not as it actually is--an educated Muslim's opinions about Jesus and the ancient Near East.  \\"Zealot\\" is a fast-paced demolition of the core beliefs that Christianity has taught about Jesus for 2,000 years. Its conclusions are long-held Islamic claims--namely, that Jesus was a zealous prophet type who didn't claim to be God, that Christians have misunderstood him, and that the Christian Gospels are not the actual words or life of Jesus but \\"myth.\\"  These claims are not new or unique. They are hundreds of years old among Muslims. Sadly, readers who have listened to interviews on NPR, \\"The Daily Show,\\" Huffington Post or MSNBC may pick up the book expecting an unbiased and historic report on Jesus and first century Jewish culture. (I will let my Jewish friends address Aslan's statement on MSNBC that, \\"there were certainly a lot of Jewish terrorists in first century Palestine.\\")  As a journalist and author who is Christian I cannot imagine penning a so-called objective biography of Muhammad and then concealing my conflict of interest in national media interviews.  In world history there are no religions more violently and anciently opposed than the crusading, fighting, at times blood-shedding rivals of historic Islam and historic Christianity. Even non-violent Muslims and Christians, like Aslan and myself, understand that we hold aggressively oppositional views--particularly about Jesus. National news coverage of \\"Zealot\\" has ignored this conflict of interest.  \\"Zealot\\" is written with the self-assumed authority of groundbreaking revelation from a historian. In reality, it is a religious person's opinion about Jesus--from an adherent to the religion that has been in violent opposition to Christ for 1,400 years.  Aslan informs us that we cannot trust the Gospel of Mark--because it was written 40 years after Jesus' death. He then chides us to trust his new book, written almost 2,000 years later.  I believe in Aslan's right to hold and propagate any opinion. It's a right that, ironically, Christians do not have in many Muslim countries.  My concern is that national media coverage be smart and forthright about this conflict of interest, just as it would be if I--a Christian author and pastor--wrote a book about Muhammad.  Pouring praise onto \\"Zealot\\" as new information about Jesus, without explaining its author's devotion to a combatting religion, is blatant bias. This same bias would be unthinkable if the Christian and Muslim roles were reversed.  With its riveting demolition of Jesus, \\"Zealot\\" will continue to attract interviews--some from reporters who want to see Jesus deconstructed. Many more interviews will come from reporters who simply don't understand that Reza Aslan has a horse in this race. He is not an objective observer, but, to use his own word, a zealot, with religious motivation to destroy what Western culture has believed about its central figure for hundreds of years. In many ways, this conflict is larger than Christianity and Islam. It is a conflict of Western and Middle Eastern foundations. These are great and important debates that we should welcome, but let's be honest about our motivations, positions and conflicts of interest as we dialogue.  Let's hope reporters in future interviews will, being informed, mention the glaring conflict of interest in this Islamic opinion of Jesus. It is no more objective than my educated views about Muhammad, as a Christian.  \\"Zealot\\" is not new work from a historian. It is a sophisticated presentation of views that Muslims have held about Jesus for more than 1,000 years.    Read more: [...]

140006922X|5.0|Reza Aslan's accessible \\"Zealot\\" vividly evokes the historical Jesus of Nazareth, Jesus as a first-century messianic Jew living under violent Roman occupation. Aslan's exhaustive grasp of Roman and Near Eastern history, as well as Jewish and Christian scripture and apocrypha, enables the author to peel away the ahistorical and improbable and reveal a striking portrait of the life this man most likely lived.<br /><br />*Jesus and his followers were to begin with known--indeed, derided--as Nazarenes, products of rural Galilee. Contrary to Matthew and Luke's nativity stories, no Roman census demanded imperial subjects abandon work and property to be counted in their *birthplaces*; only a symbolic retcon of Jesus' birth to David's Bethlehem would have necessitated this convoluted fable. Jesus' home town of Nazareth was a farming settlement unmarked on ancient maps, unlikely to have supported schools or literacy, or to have provided steady work for the skilled carpenter or \\"tecton\\" he was said to be. Searching for work larger nearby towns, however, Jesus would have learned of proto-\\"zealots\\" who were active in the area: pious, nationalistic Jews agitating against Rome. If he did not already know, Jesus would also have heard of John, whose ministry offered Jews ritual purification in the Jordan River their forefathers had surged across to conquer Canaan. This baptism in the Jordan offered the ideal embarkation point for a Jew's messianic journey to reclaim The Promised Land.<br /><br />*Years later, the rabbi Jesus' confrontations with Jerusalem authorities would revolve around Rome's role in the capital and Temple, particularly the presence of imperial coinage in that sacred space Taken literally, Jesus' \\"render unto Caesar\\" maxim has the Galilean not simply advising Jews to pay their taxes but demanding Caesar's surrender of God's Holy Land, Chosen People, and sole Temple. Paired with Jesus' subsequent assault on the Temple's money-changers, this seditious defiance of imperial legitimacy and authorty makes Jesus' arrest entirely predictable. Roman governor Pontius Pilate's question \\"Are you the king of the Jews?\\", then, is far from a joke, but the standard imperial demand of a messiah-rebel. Still less plausible is the Gospel account of Pilate \\"washing his hands\\" of Jesus' fate. The historical Pilate's hands already bore the blood of thousands of Jews, and sending rebels to the cross was a routine matter during his governorship. He would not have required or sought the Jerusalem public's input before crucifying a Jew for talking sedition. Crucifixion was indeed the standard Roman penalty for traitors and rebels. The Romans routinely dismissed such insurrectionists as \\"bandits\\", suggesting that the men crucified alongside Jesus were also something more than common thieves.<br /><br />*But what happened to this historical Jesus? How did we get from this crucified rebel to the Christ? Aslan traces this shift to the conflict between the early Jesus' movement's \\"judaizing\\" Jerusalem church and the \\"hellenizing\\" universalism of Paul and his followers. The apostle James' Jerusalem church preserved the memory of Jesus as Jewish prophet and messiah. But Paul, who never knew Jesus in life and rarely spoke of him outside of the sacramental context, reconceived of the movement's founder as a \\"God-man\\" more akin to a figure from pagan mythology than anything in Jewish tradition. Still more radically, Paul re-imagined Jesus as a *universal* savior. While the Jerusalem church endured, the \\"hebraizing\\" view predominated, even forcing a humiliated Paul to return to Jerusalem to account for himself and endure an orthodox purification ritual. But the mother church's destruction in the course of the second Roman-Jewish War threw the movement's center of gravity into the diaspora with Paul's \\"hellenizing\\" followers. Through Paul's letters, Luke's Acts, the increasingly mystical Gospels, and later works, these \\"hellenizers\\" rewrote Jesus the messianicnationalist Jew as the Christ, savior of all mankind, the eternal Word, coequal with the one universal God.<br /><br />*With the Jerusalem church gone and Jews marginalized throughout the Empire, Pauline Christianity offered the Jesus movement a possible future in and beyond the Roman world. And yet, Aslan argues, 2,000 years after the conflicts which so obscured Jesus' historical reality from view, the human being who inspired the primitive church is discernible and worth contemplating: a provincial Jew who gave his life confronting the vastest empire his world had ever seen for the sake of his people and traditions.

B00A8GBW3U|5.0|I already had Born To Die and Paradise on their own when I bought this CD, but this is so much easier carrying around than the two CDs. Being a diehard LDR fan I had to get this version. Also whats great about this is that it has every track from Born To Die including Lucky Ones and Without You. Buy it!!!

B007TFG2Y2|5.0|This Deluxe Edition of Electra Heart includes the three tracks 'Buy The Stars', 'Living Dead', and 'Lonely Hearts Club'. Absurdly, the original US version does not have those tracks so I had to buy this version, too. It was so worth the buy because those tracks are FLAWLESS and diamonds in their own sort. The only thing missing from this album is 'How To Be A Heartbreaker', but I still think that this version is much better than the US.
B0046B8GEQ|3.0|But I am not the intended demographic.  Both my kids loved it, though, and really, fart jokes are always funny.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|Incredibly lifelike. I feel like I'm really taking care of my own horse! If you were that kid that wanted q pony when you were little, then this is the game for you.
B0049J2BSM|5.0|Enjoyed watching this movie again, this time with my 3 year old. She really liked it. I was nervous about whether the monsters would scare her, but this issue is handled very tactfully, and in my opinion, there are only 2 times when monsters do something scary (roar), and it is either immediately followed by something silly that makes the monster look ridiculous or contrition on the part of the monster.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this app is so cool I love it me and my cousin love it and its so awesome and cool
B003QTSMXE|5.0|Absolutely perfect movie for kids, adults, families, anyone. We thoroughly enjoyed it and will definitely watch again. Very entertaining and a great story as well. My 3 year old loved the robots.

B0094K1WZE|4.0|As with all of Tom Cruise's Mission Impossible movies, Ghost Protocol features fast action and incredible stunts and camera work. If you focus on that, you'll love it. To me, the basic premise was a bit hard to believe. But I love action flicks and this one did not disappoint.

B009CGYO0K|1.0|The title intrigued me, but I did not appreciate some of the language.  Was not as funny as I had anticipated either.
B00DHSK3RM|3.0|There were a few good tips, but the levels the writers highlighted were not the levels I was having difficulty with, so it was a little frustrating. If they were going to do a help book, shouldn't they have included all levels? I will keep it in my cue until I pass the few remaining levels they highlighted, just incase I need help with them.
B002NN5F7A|4.0|Great line up of actors, FANTASTIC movie if you're in sales.  Use the Alec Baldwin scene to motivate our team.
B0092SQ5EG|5.0|Awesome view into Katy Perry's life I love how she is all about her fans and making people smile. Defiantly buying
B007MJSYF0|4.0|It is difficult not to compare &#34;Battle Royale&#34; to &#34;The Hunger Games&#34; though the stories are quite different. For example the reason for having the annual death game, the way the game is conducted, who is behind it and what their motive is, and the strategies and outcome are all dissimilar. So, Battle Royale should be evaluated on its own merits.<br /><br />The story really speaks to the pitiful state of Japan's public school system, the lack of discipline, the disrespectful children bullying and breaking rules and often laws without the fear of punishment at school or at home. To me, the entire movie is a Japanese teacher's dream - unruly and unworthy students atoning for their misbehavior in a bloody game of death. Lord of the Flies psychology kicks in after the kids realize their dilemma. Some pair up, others form groups, while a few go solo.<br /><br />The weakness of the story is a lack of background. The characters are not very well developed, including the punitive teacher hosting the event and having too many unanswered questions is more annoying than interesting.<br /><br />The strength is in the original theme and fascinating cultural-anthropological look at a &#34;Hello Kitty&#34; society reverting back to bloodier times.<br /><br />Overall, it was an entertaining movie with twisted scenes that were often more funny than horrifying.
B00CWVG1Z8|2.0|This movie was just OK. Nothing amazing. It definitely wasn't worth 3.99 to rent for a day. I watched it on my ipad while I was flying home from vacation. That is the only reason why I liked it was because it distracted me.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is an awesome game!  I am totally hooked.  I reminds me of temple run.  Very exciting! Highly suggest that you download.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Both my kids and I love playing this game. It keeps you busy while waiting at the doctors office :)
B00CTXBO9M|5.0|Great game! Everyone in the family loves it. Though it does lack some of the functionality of the iOS version.
B00DJZI2N0|5.0|It may seem redundant to write the 742nd review on this book, but I couldn't resist.  I am more of a cozy mystery fan, but this thriller/nail biter had me on the edge of my seat, and I couldn't stop reading it.<br />  The main character of Into the Darkest Corner, Catherine, was very brave.  She will have every reader rooting for her.  The author, Elizabeth Haynes, spins a mesmerizing tale.<br />  Catherine Bailey is a young somewhat carefree woman who enjoys men and the social scene, but that all changes when she meets Lee.  Soon, Catherine and Lee are dating each other exclusively.  Her girlfriends are excited for her that she managed to snag such a wonderful catch.  He's handsome and anyone can tell that he really, really loves her.  When Catherine starts to see a more sinister side to Lee, it is as though no one will believe her.  She tries to get away from him, but Catherine knows at the same time that he will murder her if she succeeds.  If you've ever wondered why abused women stay with their abuser, this story does explain it, in part.<br />  Catherine realizes that she needs to help herself, and fight for her life and her sanity.  How the story unfolds is very satisfying, complete with a, perhaps unexpected, ending.  Very absorbing reading.
B001BC5HXG|5.0|The struggle in understanding good and evil as the essence of our humanity is the theme of this novel.  I remember the movie with James Dean from the l960's.  Elia Kazan, the director, chose to focus on just a piece of the book, which, I realized upon reading the book, is only a fraction of this epic novel.  I think this belongs to the list of classic American novels because it describes the american landscape with its setting in Salinas, California; but it also reflects an American spirit of self-reliance, entrepreneurship, and the yearning for freedom and independence.  Under that story revealed in generations of families seeking to farm the unwelcoming land and make something out of less than enough, there is a unconquerable courage to seek fulfillment in relationships, even when rejection is overpowering.  The obvious theme based on the biblical story of Cain and Abel is the clear motif within two generations.<br />A son's jealousy of his sibling, a son who can seemingly do no wrong,  a stern father who demands conformity to his expectations and is apparently unable to express his love---this is what drives the story both in the movie and in the book.  Even as a long novel, East of Eden was a page-turner.  Steinbeck's skill as a storyteller made me think about our human propensity for both good and evil and, most especially, that we share the capacity to choose how we will act as part of our common humanity.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|This book had laughs, cries, love, anger, passion, pain,friendship, jealousy...and nearly everything else a teen novel should have. I enjoyed every page.

0312106122|5.0|These are early Wilbur Smith novels and the River God takes you back to Pharoah Egypt. The novel is<br />detailed and puts you completely in time with characters that are more realistic than most novelist can<br />even hope to create. Be sure to start the series with the first novel! The read them in the order they were<br />written, finishing with THE QUEST which I think is his most brilliant. Wilbur Smith should win the nobel prize<br />some day.
B004J64QSI|5.0|Fabulous voices, great story. Same story from the classic book by Victor Hugo of forgiveness vs hatred and redemption vs grudge. I reccomend watching the old black and white movie versions and/or any you come across for good insight as to the story line first befor watching this 25th anniversary version (if you haven't read the book). This version will capture you with the tremendous vocals and you may otherwise be lost or miss the depth of the passion from the players. Absolutely wonderful !!!!!!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Interesting solutions required. Not too obvious.<br />Fun for all ages.<br />Need to have the will not to give up.<br />Yay
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|Evernote is simple and very easy to use. Never have a problem with crashes and its easy to get to my info on other devices.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I love this app. I'm not addicted to it, but I play it when I go on road trips and when I get bored. its so easy to get points to unlock great/fun games! get it, try it, like it.
B000PHVZNE|5.0|Great the first time that I saw it years ago! EVEN BETTER NOW :-) Some things are just that way.
B006RXQ800|5.0|Great Show.  GIves a good fell of what the time was like and the accepted social values and the anti irish felling in the country
B005GFPZYK|5.0|This book reminded me of what a great country we live in and how proud we should be of our soldiers. I know not every soldier feels the same as Chris did, but I can understand his perspective. It was a great read.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|What can I say... it's a cult classic in the making.<br /><br />The writing style is good and it's an easy read. The plot is, well, interesting. I have to admit I did enjoy Ana's inner monologues being shared with the reader. It's done in a way unlike anything I've read before.<br /><br />Apart from being a totally unrealistic sexual fantasy novel, what more can I say?
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|this the best. I love playing the game thus far. haven't had any problems or isssues with it yet. I recommend it.
B000JCQCW4|1.0|I did not like the movie at all, I could not watch all of it! not my kind of movie
B00C7NKPPS|5.0|This is in my opinion the best rock concert at that time. Paul was at his best all the musicians are exellent. But. Jimmy was an outstanding guitar player. This is a balanced concert. I recomend any rock fan to buy it. And like always amazon acconplished. Thanks amazon.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I love that it is out of stock already a few hours after release.  Good thing I got mine.  I can't wait to plug it in and stream freely.
B00CGPPMKU|4.0|This is just the ticket to spend some time making new pictures with your finger.  It fills in the gaps while waiting for the doctor or at the pharmacy.  I haven't found a way to save the pictures I create.  So it is just an ephemeral game to keep me from tapping my fingers while waiting.
B0089LOG02|4.0|I thought it was a very good book.  The two stories went together very well.  I could feel the emotions of the charatures.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Ender's Game is one of those books I feel everyone should read at some point, along with the entire series.<br />Truth be told, I am a bigger fan of Speaker for the Dead (the second book in the series) because I love the Piggies so much, and the ethical issues the book touches around anthropology and science and sentience. But to get there you must know Ender first. And the battle scenes and strategy in Ender's Game are worth the ride.<br />I've read it more than once. :D
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|buy it. i know 3 bucks is high for an app but its worth 100 dollars. just buy it. seriously buy it.
B000E6EGXM|5.0|Britten's War Requiem is one of the most significant choral/orchestral works of the 20th century.  Its combination of the liturgical text and the anti-war poems by Wilfred Owen creates a work of enormous emotional impact.  This CD is the original recording, with three of the finest singers of that era as soloists, conducted by the composer.  What's not to love?
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|The minion s are always fun. Great game and the price is just right. I'm enjoying the play. Give it a try.
B008602KQI|3.0|If you don't mind seeing children getting hacked up, stung to death by wasps or just plain mutilating each other than this movie is for you.  Why did I give it 3 stars (It's okay)?<br /><br />The film is predictable as I wrote in the subject line.  However, at least it's not another vampire movie.  The story line is consistent  and nothing was left that didn't make sense.  Of course the sequel is supposed to be out at the end of this year or the beginning of next. Though it has clearly ended with a setup for the next movie in the series it could still have been a stand-alone movie and the ending makes sense without having to see the next one.<br /><br />It was worth seeing once.  If for nothing else, to see if the characters were believable.  A few of the adult characters were a little strange but their characters were supposed to be that way. The child and teenage actors were by far the best and seemed most real.  The writing is mediocre but the young actors still managed to bring some life (...and death) to the parts.<br /><br />The movie is clearly intended to appeal to an audience under 20 years old; like the vampire movies.  And it succeeds in doing that.  I've never read the books that this was adapted from so I can't give a comparison.  Actually, I wasn't even tempted to read them.  Unlike the Harry Potter series where I read each of the books before seeing the movie.  And while they didn't follow the books exactly, they story line was close enough to the books that even without reading the books they would have connected to each other and made sense.  Let's hope the next Hunger Games movie can do the same; to pick up logically where this first one left off.<br /><br />If you like adventure movies (and in some ways, a &#34;coming of age&#34; plot line) than you will probably enjoy this.
B00CLD65X0|5.0|Just a can't miss TV series. Very high quality production that leaves you wanting more episodes to watch.  Very compelling cast and top quality acting make your experience as life- like as possible.
B004SBQGHS|1.0|This gane is not ad free ... who do I complain to? NOT AD FREE!!!!!  NOT AD FREE!!!!!  NOT AD FREE!!!!!
1781162646|5.0|King at his best, just a good old nostalgia story, with a little of the occult in it, The older he gets the better he writes
B008JFUQ3O|2.0|Went to see this with my daughters(7 and 4) on opening weekend with much excitement and anticipation since we are all fans of the first Despicable Me but we left very disappointed...even my girls could barely force a laugh and the only truly genuine laugh was from the minion pretending to be a fire engine and the minions singing a wedding song at the end and that was more cute and silly than ha ha funny. The movie felt rushed, the editing could have been better to cut out the slow parts. The scenes b/w dialogue were slow and awkward (the theater was silent enough to hear people eating popcorn 10 rows away). Kristen Wigg was an overacting animated version of an early Jim Carey, slapstick humor can only carry you so far and the movie was predictable from the introduction of her character. My eldest daughter said that they will probably get married at the end. We even knew where Dr. Nefario would turn up and what was happening to the minions. People rushed to get out of the theater not even waiting for the closing credits. I even saw a few families leave b/c it couldn't hold their kids attention. Very disappionted in the sequel. No one stood up to clap there was nothing to suggest an entertained audience just one that was forced through the motions for the sake of their kids. Ken DeJong's character had a small role and truly a waste of his talent. Go see Monster's University for truly ha ha sidesplitting moments (my daughters' complained that the adults were laughing too loud too hear anything), even Turbo has better moments that D.M. 2. I will not purchase this on Blu-Ray. I wish I could ask for a refund since it cost us over $60 for the movie and some food. I guess the only good thing is it was nice and cool compared to the 90+ degree weather outside and a great time to catch up on some sleep (yes some little kid feel asleep). That's my rant. I truly don't understand the Critical praise for the movie but taste is subjective and critics are easily bought. If you really want to see the movie rent it, don't waste your money on buying it. Bring back Vector.
B000FCKC4C|5.0|A must read, don't live your life without discovering your Personal Legend. I recommend this book to everyone I know!
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|The game is very fun I just wish you had unlimited tokens to play the games and you didn't have to pay real money for them.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Thank you, Suzanne Collins. The Hunger Games series are absolutely wonderful books. I have read them over and over. Thumbs up.
B0081336FO|5.0|Season 2 is a wonderful wrap up to a very well done reboot of Sherlock Holmes. The rapport between Holmes & Watson is hilarious. And Sherlock shows his affection for those closest to him in some of the most interesting ways possible. The only thing that I didn't enjoy was the fact that between season 1 & 2 there are only six episodes.
B001BR5NN0|5.0|I have always loved this movie. We watched it the other night and I felt like I was in high school again. Memories.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is great! I love all the animations, it's fun and easy, and challenging. This is my favorite game ever:)
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Thank you, Suzanne Collins. The Hunger Games series are absolutely wonderful books. I have read them over and over. Thumbs up.

B003O86FMW|5.0|Thank you, Suzanne Collins. The Hunger Games series are absolutely wonderful books. I have read them over and over. Thumbs up.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This is one of the best books ever  it has so many twists and turns that leave you on edge  I  recomend this book for almost everybody 8 and up
B005HED1BE|5.0|Watch and learn.  This is how it was and how it should be for future ages.  Yes, this has been digitally updated.  I acknowledge that, but there are no Ewoks.  Original Trek is the only Trek.  Ironic, yes?
B00CCCF4NW|4.0|This latest effort is a slightly new direction than his prior work, IMO, but Coldplay has done the same and I still love them! The singles 'Abandon Window' and 'Immunity' most closely resemble, to me, the John Hopkins that I am most familiar with. I LOVE those cuts in particular, and I am sure the rest of this CD will grow on me as well! One of my newest and favorite artists, for sure!
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|The only things that could make the game better are more mini games, more skins, more items, and more villains to fight
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I loved it but you get hooked and then you go to Silo Saga, etc...now I waiting for &#34;Dust&#34; coming out in August.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Rebecca made me review this game. I'm not very good but it's mostly because she cheats a lot cuz she is a cheater
B0060MYM7O|5.0|Addictive and satisfying, GRR Martin delivers.  We like to make a marathon of each season.  Total immersion is definitely the way to go.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I DRANK in The Kite Runner and A Thousand Spendid Suns.  The character in those books, especially the women, were so well developed and I was amazed, just amazed, that they were actually contemporaries of mine.........our worlds are SO far apart it was hard to believe we grew up on EARTH at the same time!  I learned a lot and both books haunted me for months after I finished them. I couldn't wait to read &#34;Mountains&#34;, and I was not disappointed.  I didn't feel this book had the underlying message of HOPE and SURVIVAL of the other two, but it did keep me riveted and I loved the format.  I was profoundly sad during much of the reading of this, because Hosseini draws you into his characters lives and souls so beautifully.  I wanted a silver lining, a big, happy ending or at least a much anticipated joyous reunion, but that never really came. It is another triumph for this very gifted and talented writer..........I hope he keeps them coming!!!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I loved all three books!  Not just the sex but the romance and story are great!  Very good and easy read!
B0040I09RM|5.0|A bunch of co-workers were constantly raving about this series so it was time to find out what all the fuss was about. I just finished season 3 after watching the first two over a span of two weeks. Episodes fly by and you can't wait to check out the next one. Gritty at times with violence and language, but not too over the top. Highly recommended.
B00571F26Y|5.0|This was a very informative book and I learned so much about the effect that wheat has on our bodies!
0062124293|4.0|I picked up How to Be a Woman after hearing glowing reviews from numerous social circles.  I loved Caitlin Moran's voice and sensible advice for the modern feminist woman, although some of her anecdotes resonated more than others.<br /><br />To me, the best part of How to Be a Woman comes when Moran defines feminism.  It worries me (as a 20-something) that so many of my peers view feminism as something scary, alienating, and overly forceful.  In reality, though, Moran brilliantly lays out what it means to be a feminist woman: to have a vagina, and to want control over what you do with it.  Actively working towards an even playing field with the men of the world doesn't mean not caring about makeup, throwing away your bras, or refusing to ask a man to help you open the pickle jar.<br /><br />The only thing that detracted from this memoir-cum-feminist-manifesto was Moran's uneven handling of certain issues.  Lady Gaga = good, but Katy Perry = bad.  Full support panties = good, thongs = bad.  Burlesque = good, strip clubs = bad.  Surely Moran can support her arguments for these judgments, but drawing categorical good/bad lines in the sand undermines her larger point: that young females of the world should embrace womanhood and feminism and many of the wonderful things that come with being a woman, while rejecting those that undermine female equality.  Focusing on why having a full bush is superior to waxing (despite the author having a valid argument about porn culture) detracts from this larger purpose.<br /><br />All in all, though, I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  It was humorous, it was engaging, it made me laugh out loud.  If this is what it means to be a woman, then I certainly want to be one.  Highly recommended for men and women looking for a hilarious, modern take on feminism.
B00B29J0I6|5.0|This game is best for children 7 years or older.  A younger child can become frustrated for always losing.  This game requires strategy skills.  It is even challenging for adults...I play it, too.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Great story and characters. Very exciting. Can't wait to get to the next one and find out more about the other silos.
B0096DFBZQ|5.0|My children are really into this version of Pac-man.  They like the original version, but this one is very entertaining and engaging for them.  They are used to the 3d effect games rather than the old school 2d versions.
B0065CCM76|5.0|Do you really need to read a rating to buy this?<br />It's Bob Seger for crying out loud.<br />You won't be disappointed.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game requires special coordination skills...age 7 or older...maybe 9.  Adults would love this, too.  My husband can be found playing this game for at least an hour.
1781162646|3.0|i kept reading and reading waiting for it to get better and finally 3/4 of the way thru i just skimmed the rest--not usual stephen king that keeps y ou reading
B00992CF6W|4.0|Your child is able to build 3d things by using different shapes...house, room, plane, etc.  You can also demolish it when you are done.  Some boys love the idea of demolishing things.
1603429999|5.0|i purchased this for my mother<br />she had gotten it from the library and liked it so much she wanted to own it
B00A757EFW|5.0|For all those old school people who grew up in the generation of Atari...this game is a hit.  My children get excited when I tell them that I used to play this game when I was a child.  They love playing it, too.
B00005QZWI|2.0|When I saw that some of the music was done by Enya I bought it.  Was not really happy with the cd.  I thought there would be more of her music there.
B005HSL626|5.0|Wow!  What can I say...this game is so much fun.  I play it, too, on my children's devices...a must.  Adults will enjoy it, too.
B002RV01QI|5.0|Always love her music and this Cd was great.  I was very pleased with the arrangements and the variety of music on the cd.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I love this game but I don't like how quickly you finish because there are not enough levels! Would love more levels that were promised &quot;soon&quot;!!!!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This is such an awesome series.  I love all the characters and the interactions between them.  Maggie Smith is so witty and animated.  I can't wait for the 4 season to come out.
B00APUQH0W|3.0|This is a pretty light hearted, easy movie. Decent acting, predictable plot. Check out rotten tomatoes for your movie ratings.
B00821OX98|5.0|Never was really into this series but then gave it a chance and it leaves you wanting more. Love it now
B00847KFDS|5.0|Love the music, John Fogerty sounds amazing! I especially really love the Kid rock song &#34; Born on the Bayou&#34;.
B00CA3C1N4|1.0|Looked interesting for my grandson, but it was not good.I do not recall asking for &#34;full&#34;starling, I just wanted to trial a free version. It was not suitable for us.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|All I can say, wow!  You have to  be<br />A really great detective!<br />I would recommend this game to all my puzzle loving friends!<br />What a great game.  I will keep on playing, . Keeps you entertained for hours!
B00BFIFIPS|4.0|First of all, this case is one of the nicest cases I ever had for any phone.  It looks very sleek and it feels like it's made of good materials.  The color is exactly what the picture looks like.  The ports accept all standard cables and all the earphones I own.  It doesn't offer screen protection because the edges don't come up off the sides, so if you don't have a screen protector, I wouldn't recommend this case.  But for people like me, who do use screen protectors, this isn't a problem.<br /><br />The only thing I don't like about this case is that the sound/mute switch is very hard to reach.  I don't have nails, so I have to flip it with my finger, which barely fits.  If you have big fingers and no fingernails, it is impossible to reach this switch without some other help.  If the hole was a little bigger, it would be the perfect case.  Overall, I think this is an excellent quality case for the price.  I may even buy other colors later since you can just switch the backing out easily.
B0026Q8EWW|5.0|Well written book turned into movie.  Not some hard to follow legal mystery, but a down to earth david vs. goliath story.  One of my favorites of all time.
B00C1BU8G2|3.0|Looking at JP3 out of the trilogy it is my least favorite. However taking place on the second island( the same island as the Lost World), and bringing along some pretty cool dinosaurs you didn't get to see in the first two films I would give Jurassic Park III a 7 out of 10(10 being the best). It is a great film to enjoy!
B008XG1X18|4.0|I have recently started using Pinterest, and I have thoroughly enjoyed it.  The only negative thing is I wish someone could comment on a PIN.....like leave a suggestion or whether they liked it or not.  Other than that....I intend to continue pinning and using other pins.  GREAT ideas!!!
B005CRQ2XA|5.0|The book was funny In a lot of parts because have the move and the movies just like the book.but I loved the book they both make me laugh and I mean a lot.<br /><br />Jeff Kinney  you rock.
B00BIVN82M|5.0|Michael Buble's music is always so upbeat and relaxing.  This is the third time I purchased a CD by him.
B00992CF6W|1.0|Survivalcraft is better if u have money get survivalcraft!!!I tried this app and there's not even boats .worst app ever!!
B00BQ1DBUS|3.0|I believe I have all of his CD's,  Although this is not my favorite CD by Rod, I still like it.
B006AZZPCM|3.0|In my opinion it wasn't that good. I was learning how to use the app, and I press the desktop button to see what it would look like, I saw it and I wanted it the other way, it won't change back.<br />Then the porn adds, I know you need to advertise, but little children use this app and I know the parents don't want to see that, I don't want to see that.<br />But besides that, the app has good quality and it lets you download the videos fast and it is good quality as well when it is downloaded
1400052181|5.0|I love that this book was written in narrative form and from a &#34;non-scientist&#34; perspective.  This should be required reading for anyone in health professions.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|im very glad that you all brought this game to the amazon app store. it is very great..no freezes or anything.
B004ZN9W5M|1.0|I expected a cd case and legit cd's, it was a cardborad cover and the volumn will only go so high , not as loud as i would like.
B008FRFN7A|5.0|This little app puts the Kindle or any smartphone in the games as far as network printing. Can'tget much better than that.
1936608898|5.0|I was impressed with the speed of shipping and the condition of the book I received. This was a great buy and a life changing read!
B005723JSQ|5.0|As always Sophie Kinsella delivers &#34;quirky&#34; characters that keep you smiling.  You cannot help laughing along the way thinking that the plot is not even possible.  The main characters capture you from the beginning.  Had a smile on my face from start to finish.  A great light, happy read.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|A good ending after a long journey. Life is and always will be about choices made and balance obtained. The Divine Designer made us people of free will as this book so ably explains. Without free will there is no life.<br /><br />Glad yet sad this journey is concluded.  But Robert Jordan and company has given this world an amazing epic that profers such wisdom.  CLASSIC
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Having a book affair with Christian Grey was intense.  I loved him and his love Anna so much.  Wanting and fighting along with them to get together to find their happy place.  Loved the series, it opened my eyes to a wicked, wicked sexy world.  Thank-you E L James!!!
B001HBYHFA|5.0|I love the Firefly television show and Serenity was great! I wish they would either bring back the show or make another movie.
B00846REIS|5.0|After a high from 50 Shades, I didn't think I'd have anything to compare.  Tumbled upon the Bared to You series which leaves you wanting more from this very powerful, intense couple.  You feel their heart ache and pain, just wanting them to find a way to push aside all their fears and nightmares from the past so they can finally find happiness in their future together.  A must read.  Can't wait for book #4!!  Anxiously waiting.
B00BP4WAZS|5.0|The movie that game forgot.....<br /><br />This flick is easily summed up in one word....F-U-N. While soaking up the pheonominal palate of colors and beautifully flawless animation, I became instantly transported back 20 years or so, back to when I was a wee little teenager, learning all about how to play the old school monster-tall video game units. Back then life was FUN, and not complicated. I believe I connected with the characters in this flick right off the bat. Try it, you may end up playing air guitar and waving your 80's mullet around going &#34;freedom rock rules man!!!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Began 50 Shades without a clue what I was getting myself into.  Glad I started the series!!!!  As with the 1st book, this book does not disappoint.  I could not put it down, that's how intense it gets!  Nothing left to the imagination, it's all spilled out for your eyes.  Christian is a dream, as intense and moody as he is, you cannot help falling for him.  A 5+ star recommendation in my view.
0812983459|5.0|I had not idea about if before I purchased it.  It's is being used for a book club. It was absolutely wonderful. The ending was so<br />insperrational. Yes I would recomend it, as my daughter already has read it because of my raving about it, and I and lending the book to a friend.<br /><br />There should be more books like this.
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|I must have a really filthy mouth because I did not notice that this movie contained a lot of cursing.  Not until I began reading the reviews here, that is.  People really have to chill out.  This guy is a messed-up alcoholic.  Of course he curses.  It would be weird if he didn't.  Why does cursing ruin the movie for some people?  Can't you appreciate the realism even if it's not the way you like to conduct your own life?  Movies are supposed to transport you to a different world.<br /><br />Also, I can't believe all the people who said \\"I watched 5 minutes and shut it off because it was porn.\\"  Porn???  Really?  I know that in the first scene they show a naked woman walking around the bedroom after obviously having spent the night with Denzel.  But porn????  Come on, people.  Those who turned the movie off in the first 5 minutes missed a really good movie.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This game is so addictive. Love it<br /><br />I play it on my kindle and on my cell phone. The variety of cars rocks.
B00BUADSMQ|1.0|So BORING I quit in the middle of a would-be exciting chase scene. Not one likable (or even interesting) character.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I can't believe the ending to this book. Very well written. First book I read by this author and I will definitely read another book by him again.
B0036FOGTW|4.0|The model that is laid out is a good one.  How to make the change over is the big question.  The author gives one much to think about when writing checks for projects in Africa.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This game is really entertaining and its like having a real horse in your back yard you can feed it and enter it in competisions and train it this game is really great
140006922X|5.0|It looks like a group of pretty hateful, insecure, paranoid \\"Christians\\" has recently taken on the task of bringing down this book's ratings... Incredibly disappointing.<br /><br />As a Christian myself, in no way am I threatened by the idea that one can talk about Jesus as a man ....vs. always talking about Jesus as Man+God in the same breath. After all, Jesus WAS A MAN. This book is not about permanently extracting God from Jesus. It is (among other things) about looking through a historical lens to learn what we can know of Jesus' earthly life. Christians: you can still add God on top of that if you so choose. But that, as Aslan himself points out, is a matter of faith.<br /><br />READ THIS BOOK! All it can do -- and what it has done for me -- is enrich one's understanding of Jesus, a human being who walked around this planet like the rest of us. Believe it or not, that can strengthen your faith in Jesus the Christ. If it doesn't, because you are a person who fears information, don't blame the book. Blame the strength of your own convictions.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is so much fun! Especially if your a creative person. Me and my family play together and its really fun! 2 thumbs up
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I was really surprised at the quality of this game given that it was free.  I'm only at level ten so far but I'm hooked. I'm really  looking forward to more levels.
B00AFPTSI0|1.0|This is another in a long line of business books, designed to sell many copies, make the author a lot of money, and collect prestige and power at his school.  The pattern is formulaic --- print a ton of endorsements at the start; give a bunch of random examples that peripherally might bolster your case, or not; and write as if you found the path to wealth.<br /><br />You can skip the book and save some money by re-reading Napoleon Hill, &#34;In Search of Excellence&#34;; &#34;The Seven Habits&#34;, or dozens of others exactly the same.  This one adds nothing new, and seems to subtract a little.
B00DHNBPA6|1.0|frankly i thought the first one was over the top and silly, this one i found to be boring, predictable and just plain stupid...that's why for curiosity, hoping this one would be better i paid 4.00 to rent it and not waste 20.00 buying it.
B004TJ1GVK|5.0|old but good and very entertaining.great quality , very glad it was a Blue ray. We enjoyed watching this movie.
B001UV4XFG|5.0|i was really satisfied with the product it was in great conditions and it arrived really quick, very happy that there were no damages to the movie.
B001N4RORE|5.0|The cast on this movie is great, music is my kind of music, my grandkids couldn't believe grandma knew all the words, It's a wonderful show.
0060936223|5.0|I loved this book and cried through a big chunk of it. It's a really touching, deeply personal look at Patti's Smith's relationship with her one time love and long time friend. Read this!
B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|This was a fun game and very entertaining. The graphics are amazing. Very well done. I just wish it would have been longer.
B00CPTUN5G|5.0|When the first screenshots for \\"Equestria Girls\\" surfaced, let's just say \\"love and tolerance\\" weren't the first words that came to mind. No, instead, I reacted like a good portion of the fanbase: angry, upset, and honestly, like I had been deeply betrayed. It appeared that Hasbro had finally forsaken the audience that made \\"Friendship is Magic\\" such a big deal in the first place, and that they were solely pandering to the intended demographic. But upon actually watching it, my tune has changed. \\"My Little Pony: Equestria Girls\\" reminds me why I fell in love with this series in the first place, and why I'm still proud to call myself a part of this excellent fandom.<br /><br />The story kicks off with protagonist, Twilight Sparkle, getting used to her new princesshood after the events of Season Three. She doesn't have much time to adjust, however, as an old student of Princess Celestia's steals Twilight's magical crown in the middle of the night, and bolts off to an alternate dimension. Tasked with regaining it, and with all of Equestria at stake, our heroine dashes into this strange new world of... humans?!<br /><br />That's right, as you might have guessed by the promotional materials, Equestria Girls is a seemingly cynical attempt to sell humanoid dolls to children. Twilight finds herself in a high school, complete with human replicas of her friends, and must become Canterlot High School's equivalent of the prom queen to get back her crown. Unfortunately her rival has some nasty tricks up her sleeve, such as spreading gossip and framing Twilight for acts of vandalism. All this, and the fledgling princess has to deal with her first crush. Oh, what's a girl to do?<br /><br />Yes, it all sounds very silly and childish, and that's really because it is. This is more blatantly pitched to little kids than the series has been recently, and because of that, it's almost like a breath of fresh air. There's a certain vibe of innocence to it that can't really be explained, yet somehow managed to make me smile the entire time. Through cheesy \\"girls' night makeover\\" montages and through positively adorable music numbers, I could not stop grinning and laughing like I was ten years old again. It takes a lot for something to make me drop my naturally cynical streak, but \\"Equestria Girls\\" managed to disarm and charm me in one fell, joyous swoop.<br /><br />Not to say there isn't stuff for fans here as well. Longtime viewers will likely laugh with glee (I know I did) as fan-favorite background ponies get humanized, with charming results. Especially great is the focus on characters whom the community has embraced over time, such as \\"The Great and Powerful\\" Trixie Lulamoon (whose cameo had me in stitches) and DJ Pon-3/Vinyl Scratch. And yes, before you ask, a certain lazy-eyed pony makes an appearance, but you might have to wait a little while to see her...<br /><br />With colorful, vibrant animation, and an infectious musical score, this movie exceeded all of my expectations. This is something that I feel any child would adore, and that any parent would get a kick out of watching with them. Not only that, but it carries on the series' fan-pleasing tradition, and evoking memories of those late 90's Cartoon Network shows we all loved so much. Everything about this movie made me happy, and I watched in thrall until the end of its disappointingly short runtime.<br /><br />\\"My Little Pony: Equestria Girls\\" is more than I ever expected it to be, and quite frankly, more fun and zesty than a good portion of Season 3. With the ending acting both as a potential lead-in to a spin-off AND to a stellar fourth season, this is one movie that kids, parents and fans alike should not miss out on. It's definitely worth adding to your collection.<br /><br />Now... can we get that Season 4 premiere date, please?<br /><br />Overall: A-somehow managed to make me smile the entire time. Through cheesy \\"girls' night makeover\\" montages and through positively adorable music numbers, I could not stop grinning and laughing like I was ten years old again. It takes a lot for something to make me drop my naturally cynical streak, but \\"Equestria Girls\\" managed to disarm and charm me in one fell, joyous swoop.<br /><br />Not to say there isn't stuff for fans here as well.

B003QP4NPE|5.0|A Sci-fi story that takes place in our current world. To see what technology can do to us if used by the wrong power is scary. I recommend the book to everyone that has an interest in technology and how it influences our world
B005NFVZTM|3.0|Wasn't done as well as the other X-Men movies. It did give a little insite as to how Eric and Professors split and were mystic came in.
B005LAIH2M|4.0|This was a fun, wild ride!  NOT for children!  You get a lot of violence, a little sex, lots of cursing, but it's a funny movie and a bit like riding a runaway train.
B00AXIZ5WC|5.0|Never had much luck growing carnivorous plants and the information was scarce and sometimes too much academic.<br />I had to import some books from France to understand  a little more about this amazing critters, but it was never quite suffice.<br />This is a great and very interesting book with lots of important information. I wish I had found it earlier. - It would had save me lots of money in plants that died under my clumsy care and in boring books filed with scientific jargon that was in most cases useless in a practical manner to keep the plants alive and thriving. Pages and pages of dissertation about the discussion on how to or why to classify this particular species in this particular group.<br />I call this Book a Manual because there are so much important stuff about how to grow, raise, reproduce, maintain, fertilize and feed Carnivorous Plants that is like a consulting book that stays available to know more and how to solve problems when they arrive with dealing with those amazing unusual plants. But don't get me wrong, No one reads manuals like reading a novel but you will read this book from its first page to the last one.Very well written and very interesting practical information with hundreds of pictures that will clarify your concept of Carnivorous Plants.<br />Loved reading the book and the Author even throws some pieces of humor dealing with technical  and scientific stuff.<br />If you want to know about Carnivorous Plants, get this book.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|It is a great game. I am having a lot of fun. It is very fun but I think it is kinda hard
B00CWY76CC|5.0|BEST GAME I'VE PLAYED IN A LONG TIME! IT KEEPS U THINKING!  SOMETIMES I'VE TO HAVE HELP!  BUT REALLY FUN! I RECOMMEND U DOWNLOAD THIS APP!
B0054SMIH6|5.0|I loved this movie! What a cast! Matthew McCaughey is good in everything he does! Great movie! Well worth the money!
B000BTC5LW|5.0|This is the best concert video ever.  I waited 10+ years to find it on DVD after owning the VHS.  It was worth the wait.  The Cadillac of concert videos.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|challenging,  would like more levels. this is a good brain exercise.  nice change from your average puzzle games,  you actually have to think.
B008AK8FHM|2.0|This book drifted many times from the point of the book and went into great detail on things which are irrelevant especially to the average reader (ie not a doctor). I only care about the experience but a summary of circumstance surrounding it would have been sufficient.  it is not a medical text book. I felt you tried to make up bulk.  Keep the journey the centre piece. That's important. I enjoyed the experience mainly.
B00COGZ8FU|4.0|Good movie. I never read the book so I have no beef with it, but I guess when I do read books and movies I never expect it to be the same experience. Either way, its a enjoyable movie. I like the character, Jack Reacher. Hes such a smart ass.
B0092SQ5EG|4.0|This certainly makes her look good, but it's well edited and entertaining. I am not a die hard fan, so for me it was interesting to hear about her background and how she became such a mega star. I enjoyed it much more than expected.
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|I love this game it is amazing you got to have this game!!!!! It is the best. It gits hard.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|The kids love to spend time taking care of their horse. This game provides hours of fun. Highly recommended for horse lovers of all ages!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I think that temple run is a good games to play and to see how much you. can run fast and very far to for distants
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|I need sixteen more words to finish so I will say that I recommend seeing the action-packed thrill right n
B00D5TASN2|5.0|This guy takes his dabbling seriously!  I love the simple yet effective musical sensibilities of Dave's songs.  Place cotton in Dave's cheeks, Marlon Brando style and start singin'.  That's the sound you get when he's in character during a number.  Put this album on repeat and you will begin to love it even more.  I love familiarizing myself with his quirkiness as Dave is an artist who fills me with inspiration.  So glad he's around!
B008XG1X18|5.0|easy to use, mobile version has all the same features as the computer version. Great Thanks. Requiring a set amount of words is why I don't usually rate.
B002RTMXIY|5.0|Decided to buy this scary gem because I've never been touched so deeply and probingly as this film.  Eye and oral exams have had a different ring to them ever since.  I can say with certainty, if you ever happen to come across a UFO hovering over your head, run your sweet little cupcakes far away from the scene.  You won't be sorry you did!
B0020BUWX2|5.0|This was outstanding. I sped through this book in little over day (and I had a very busy day to boot) and it usually takes me at least a couple to read through a book. It is a beautiful, deep, thought provoking read.<br /><br />If I Stay gutted my heart little by little. One thing would happen and just when I would recover, another thing.<br /><br />I know I am slightly behind the \\"phase\\" when this book was popular. So many of my bookish friends may have already read it.  If not, consider picking up a copy and giving it a chance.<br /><br />I am not really sure if I can portray the meaning and emotions justly in a review.  But, I will at least, give y'all some of my first thoughts:<br />(Sorry if this review is a little scattered -- it's late and I wanted to type it out before I went to sleep)<br /><br />This is my first book by Forman -- but if her others follow suit -- I'll be picking them up. Forman really has an art for creating well designed characters that I love.<br /><br />I loved Mia's family from Grandpa and Grandma to Mom and Dad to little brother. They were all unique and different but 'flowed' well together as a character group.  All of their relationships seemed realistic and genuine.<br /><br />Plus, it was so refreshing to read  a book about a family that wasn't totally dysfunctional. Mia's parents -- different and cool ex-rockers  -- really loved their family and made decisions that were best for the family.<br /><br />More than once, I would read through a passage and think, Mia has good father (mother, grandpa, etc.) It was just a nice picture of a family unit. She has one of the best book dads that I may have ever read  (okay, okay...it's late here -- but he definitely is one of my favorites). His personality as an individual and a dad shined through.<br /><br />And the flashbacks (which is what built these thoughts) were bittersweet. The flashback would show different moments from their past. It was hard to compare that to their current situation.<br /><br />And Adam -- sigh -- sweet, edgy, romantic Adam. I understand now why I see him on so many book boyfriend lists.<br /><br />He's definitely made my future list.  He fits in with Mia's family, believes in being romantic, supports her dreams, and the two can sit in a comfortable silence. I could go on and on -- but don't want to give anything away.<br /><br />I need to read Where She Went soon -- but sequels sometimes  make me  a bit nervous.  It's in Adam's POV and sounds like an amazing read though.<br /><br />If I Stay resonated deeply with me.  The subject matter is heavy and heart wrenching, but well done and well wrote.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|A mix of temple run and fruit ninja :P Both together adds challenge and total awesomeness, this game is the best free game ever!
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|I love the game but I am unable to connect to Facebook.  IPhone version has more levels but I'd rather play on my kindle.  Please update!!!
B0084AZXKK|5.0|I have not read many of the classics.  This book was great.  Reminded me a lot of the movie, Pirates of the Caribbean. Fun read!.
B00BIR381W|5.0|So glad I bought the 3rd season! Have 1 & 2 already. Extras & deleted scenes are awesome. So much more affordable here than other places I looked.
B002ECN4P0|4.0|I had become a mad Zeppelin fan but as soon as John Bonham died and I was devastated. Bonham's death meant the Rolling Stones at that time as the best rock and around.<br /><br />I was not a Stones fan but wanted to give them a chance based on a recommendation from a school friend. I as advised to purchase a best of (compilation) as opposed to buying an actual album that I may not like. I settled on Jump Back and was not disappointed. There are excellent songs chosen from their '62 - 1989 period.<br /><br />I recommend it to anyone who is unsure about the Rolling Stones, or, embarking on their Stones journey. Jump Back is still their best \\"short compilation.\\" Other compilations contain songs from a particular era that only suitable to hardcore fans OR a quick cash grab in from a money starved distributor.<br /><br />My favorite song on Jump Back is \\"Bitch\\" as it has a killer riff and rhythm section.<br /><br />4 Stars and recommended to anyone who does not want the overly large BUT brilliant 40 Licks.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Never wanted to put the book down. Holy<br />Hell...hot! Hope a movie is made from this series!!! Great great book
B005VPRETE|5.0|This Lego set is just as I expected it would be and the birthday girl will love it!  Amazon Prime makes this an even better deal!
B0042TV4IW|5.0|When my wife started watching this I grit my teeth and just endured the first episode. Not really my thing but I indulged her. (heaven knows she has to put up with my repeat viewings of such films as Quantum of Solstice and the like.) Well after watching a few episodes I have come to appreciate the story for what it is. Sure there are times I worry that I might be found out and I would have to give up my man card, but the show is well put together, well acted and for the most part entertaining. Most importantly I never have to worry about my 11 year old walking in and seeing or hearing something I wish she hadn't. It is a clean uplifting show.
0465068367|2.0|Would not recommend to anyone minimally sensitive about the brutality of war.  Events described about the conflict with the Japanese during WW II were horrific.
B008602KQI|3.0|Had to skip over a lot of very slow sections; overall ok; some brutal scenes...<br />not for me; but worth at least looking into, maybe you like it
B001B6PBBK|3.0|Not one of her better movies. The poorly given reason for the poor accent was her brief stay in America.
B00CL68NOG|4.0|I think the acting is good. Sweet and some funny parts but not hilarious but good story and message.  I would say good couple meeting or something to watch with your mom.  If you like WeightWatchers, HSN and Peanut M&M you will like some of these references.  I like them all!  Worth renting or even buying.
B00C7JGDBW|2.0|it was ok, but just not what I was expecting.... but I'm sure the kids like it better than me
B008MIMWOO|5.0|This is awesome 3 Austinpowers films one price the PQ is decent the sound quality is good lots of extras including deleted scenes trailers and more the first two are funny the last one not as much why because of the main female beyonce knowles who can not act well fat basterd was funny once but not twice
B00BUAEYVK|4.0|I love all the die hard movies, can't wait for the next one, hopefully soon. I always like to see who he pairs up with
B00AEFXN46|5.0|All I can say is its about time this film is a masterpiece it has excellent PQ the sound is excellent great extras the casting is spectacular because ofJjack Nicholson and Faye Dunaway
B0013FSL3E|5.0|I use it my 1st grade class to teach about Earth Day and Recycle/Reuse/Reduce and saving our Earth's resources. Kids get it.
B001W79MB8|5.0|I love this movie i watch allot of movies and this is the second movie i have ever bought if you havent seen it YOU MUST WATCH IT
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I will be getting this not because I can stream from Netflix,Pandora,YouTube, or Google Play but because this is effectively allowing the ChromeOS experience to be integrated on any tv. As you know if you have the Chrome Browser it has an app system set up in place and until now it was not used very extensively but thanks to this product this would no longer be an issue you could just use the apps on the Chrome Browser to improve the product even more. The one question is how do you interact with your browser with no set up control system well you can do that with apps like Kainy to use them as your virtual desktop mouse and keyboard on any mobile device and bingo a working cloud OS for your Tv.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|I sew full time and need a break from it and this is my ultimate way of doing that.<br />MrsCraftyRVing
B00AYB1TP0|5.0|my daughter isn't even two yet and she loves this app. its<br />teaching her so much. worth it for sure.
B00005JKG5|5.0|I bought this for my student, who is learning the music.  I loved the movie now as much as I did years ago.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|Very good story that does not follow the movie by the same name.  This book contains numerous in depth memories of survivors.  It is greatly detailed and left me with vivid mental images.  If the Zombie genre interests you, I feel this is a good read.
B000TNI370|5.0|Cute tiny figurine, very well-done, looks very detailed & it looks just like my dog. Happy with the price too because breed-specific ornaments tend to be very overpriced.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|Love playing uno. There are so many different ones now and I have most of them. Love being able to play on line also.
B0037NVM1I|5.0|More dialog for character development.  I never realized that the T1000 was malfunctioning in the final scene until I saw the directors cut which showed the malfunctions more clearly.
B00C1BUYX4|4.0|I had to stop and ask about history since I am not from this country. Overall it was a good movie to see.
B00B5A9FLY|5.0|It is no wonder this was a 5 season BBC production. Very high ratings and many many disappointed when it ended.<br />Hope they make a movie some day
B00AHTYI5M|5.0|I went in with few expectations -- and was blown away!  I'll date myself -- having lived through the actual Iranian hostage crisis (and remember it), it was amazing to see the backstory on something we as the viewing public, enraptured by the news every night, had no idea was going on!
B00CTKHXFO|2.0|where's the art book that was advertised with this product?<br />would like too have it if it is available as advertised...
B0039PPW60|3.0|This mixer is alright.  It's certainly not professional quality, but it's not bad.  The only issue is that you can't record with it, despite the USB function, because it gives a constant, high-pitched feedback when connected to my laptop.  It's great for live use, but the USB connection gives white noise.  Very frustrating.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I really enjoyed Season 3; great acting by just about everyone -- and no one is better than Maggie Smith -- she can deliver a one-liner with the best of them!
B004LROUNG|4.0|Wasn't his best but it's still John Grisham book which makes it a must read.<br />Couldn't put it down once I got near the end.
B00DHNBPA6|5.0|I saw the original and I hate remakes that do not deliver. This one delivered well. The blood and gore went none stop. Only thing I could say, &#34;Woooooo!&#34;<br /><br />A must see for my horror fans out there. Buy and enjoy!
B003YGSLDA|5.0|Got this for my friend for christmas because it is her favorite christmas movie<br />If you have not seen it you should because it is a classic to some of us
B002KLOPF8|5.0|I love the movie. It was one of those timeless movies of Parris Island basic training boot camp. And been a Marine I can verify the realness of the movie. Parris Island was hard and the movie got the gest of it.<br /><br />So if any of you brave souls wish to become a Marine then this will give you insight on training. I hope none of you will be Private Pyle. Buy and enjoy!
B006GWO5NE|1.0|I was sent this product for free from customer service and was told that this would solve the problem of my relatively new Kindle Fire not charging.  I was told charging problems were common and that this charger solved the problem for many others. It did not charge my Kindle.  Customer Service told me they were sorry it didn't work and that I was welcome to purchase a new Kindle Fire.  No thank you.<br />So, this is not really a review of the cable itself, but if you're buying it to &#34;repair&#34; a charging problem, beware.
B007REW8AC|5.0|Ok so I think Christina has one of the best voices out there and is severely underrated so far.  Why do we listen to this junk on the radio while Christina is still relatively obscure?  Pure genius lyrics and a voice that would soothe the mad.
B00B81B0HC|5.0|iTunes said it best: the sound has great breadth, but can sometimes lack a bit of the richness and depth that I want to hear in some tracks. Also, songs like Radioactive plod along a little bit, but overall this is a really incredible album, and I'd highly recommend it to anyone who liked the overall feel of fun.'s Some Nights, or the general feel of Passion Pit.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Fun!!!!!!!!!!I have a boner with no pants on to get her scream and the best way to get her scream the best possible freelance work with no pants on
6305428298|5.0|A friend of mine found this to be terribly depressing, however I love this movie.  the characters in this movie are wonderful.
B00C7KYXHW|5.0|NBC has outdone itself with a show that is unique and brilliantly delivered. The casting, acting, and dialogue are second to none.
B007L6VR12|5.0|Should have seen this in the theater, but missed it.  something about this movie touched me.  Love all the characters.  Can't wait to watch it again.
B0091REZMW|1.0|Takes up to much space and I have to delete almost all of my other games and stuff in order to make room. Not a good app and I would not recommend this app at all.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|I love this series and hope it stays around well into the future.<br />Will and Alicia are a powerhouse when they are together!!!
B004HWYTP4|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.  I will admit I am a Helen Mirren fan and was surprised she didn't appear until the middle of the movie.  She did however, hang on until the end! The story was just something to sit back & relax with.  Even the guns & fists seemed to be fun.
034580404X|4.0|The writer herein will capture your attention immediaately with the underlying sexual adventures between the male and female stars of this almost X rated series.- an unparalleled epic you won't resist reading until the very end.  Patricia Clark
B00AMBLXP8|4.0|So funny! And Mark W. really let loose on this one. Although gross humor at times its still hysterically funny.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|When I picked this book up I was expecting the typical gothic romance novel along the same lines as Twilight and Beautiful Creatures. I found myself very surprised to uncover a historical fiction novel that sucked me in and did not let me go until I turned the last page. This is definitely a book that cannot be judged by the cover and cannot be judged against other similar appearing books. It must be read to be fully appreciated. Once you are a chapter in you will come to this realization yourself, and give yourself time to read it because you will not be able to put it down.
B006IGZX0C|4.0|Emma Stone did a great job in her role and Viola was worthy of an Oscar. Very well done film.
B00CL66FEQ|3.0|The movie was okay. Not a winner, but it killed some time on a boring evening.<br /><br />I read the description of this movie and the very first word used was HILARIOUS. I cannot agree, while a few parts had humor, the movie doesn't qualify.
B006RXQ5WQ|3.0|The movie was good, but couldn't relate to all the hype behind it.  Viola Davis was a pleasant highlight of this film.
B0094K1MH2|1.0|My older son and I tried watching this movie but it was slow and looked dumb so we never got passed the first ten minutes.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|its finally on the kindle fire it is a very fun game sucks that its hard to get double rainbow I wish they can make some dragons for sale but this is a very fun game I rate it 5 stars :D
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I would recommend to anyone -- there's a reason it's so popular and it's not just for the sexual ness
B005EHQGTS|5.0|I love this app! I am able to remotely control my PC from any wifi hotspot. My tablet has become even more useful.
B00CKJ2KK2|5.0|This game makes me puke with joy. Toilet bowl cleaner is not an acceptable drinking fluid.  Licking socks is illegal on other planets.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|so far its pretty damn good looking forward to finishing this season and maybe starting over again at the beginning.
0761169253|5.0|I would recommend this to every designer, and even non designers. Great advice to live by and put into practice.
B00B7Y0206|1.0|I thought this would be a great app to use. But every time I try to watch a video the app freezes and I get a message that the app is not working so I have to close it. I haven't been able to watch even ONE video. There may be a good youtube app somewhere but this isn't it.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|It starts off rather simple.  Keeps your curiosity to see if you can actually get out.  if you like puzzles you will love this game.
B005FLX1HS|2.0|A few of the songs that were supposed to be on this track are not even on the CD -.-
140006922X|1.0|The author, Reza Aslan, is an Islamic supremacist who poses as a \\"moderate\\" by donning a suit and calling himself one. But guess what? That's good enough for the liberal media. In reality, Aslan is an agent of the Iranian government, ever-ready to defend their nuclear program and brutal oppression of religious minorities. Such is his lack of concern for the truth that he called the would-be genocidaire Mahmoud Ahmadinejad a \\"liberal reformer\\". His portrayal of Jesus Christ--by sheer coincidence, of course--is perfectly in sync with Islamic dogma. But just as the rest of the Quran is riddled with demonstrable errors (e.g.: Human sperm is produced in a man's back. The sun sets into a small muddy puddle. Camel urine has miraculous healing properties and should be drunk for good health.), there is no evidence whatsoever to support its claims regarding Jesus, such as that he didn't really die on the cross.<br /><br />As asinine as this book is, it's a virtual certainty Aslan would not be capable of writing it. Others, including those who gave him unfavorable reviews, have called an \\"educated Muslim\\". He may be a Muslim, but he sure as Jehannam isn't educated. In fact, he doesn't know basic English grammar, as he demonstrates whenever he attempts to write something as simple as a tweet. Actual quote: \\"[X] is a clown and clown's are meant to be laughed at\\".<br /><br />The fact that Aslan tries to pass this book as objective history rather than an as a piece of Islamist polemics only makes it even more of a fraud.<br /><br />Also, check out his Web site, at rezaaslan-you-know-what. It's good for a laugh.
B00BW0QC8G|5.0|First a caveat: I am not of the generation who grew up carrying backpacks to school and I do not have a lot of shoulder/upper arm strength; in addition I have arthritis in my neck, so to me any backpack seems a bit strange, stiff, and awkward. Frankly, I think if I'd had to carry around all the books I did in junior high school in a backpack (none of my classes were near my homeroom locker, so there was none of this dropping books off routine--we only had three minutes to get between classes), I'd have severe back problems right now, remembering the thick English, math, science, Italian, and history textbooks, plus a full size ring binder. Oy.<br /><br />Now to our backpack: I like this. We have less expensive backpacks in our home, to use as a \\"bug out\\" bag in case of emergency. This is much nicer: padding, quality of material, and lots of nice pockets (I am a pockets-type person). I particularly like the \\"hidden pocket\\" that faces your back, which would be useful for money or any other valuables if you were backpacking or traveling. I have preliminarily tested this by putting my laptop and my 10-inch tablet in the space provided and walking around for a bit. My laptop is six years old and weighs a ton. However, the padded shoulder straps and the sternum strap were helpful in keeping this balanced well on my back. I went up and down stairs a few times and did not feel unbalanced or \\"top heavy.\\" (I do now, however, understand why people like Airbooks.)<br /><br />In addition to the laptop pocket with the inner sleeve for the tablet, this has a central compartment with two pockets, one zipped, and an outside compartment with all sorts of slots for pens, memory cards, CDs, whatever. A small pocket on the top of the back could hold a cell phone or perhaps your printout of a boarding pass, parking ticket receipt, whatever, and there are two small pockets, one on each side, one with an opening so you could put an .mp3 player in the pocket and have your earbuds come out through it. This is all in addition to the \\"hidden pocket.\\" There is a strong handle at either end of the backpack as well as a handle.<br /><br />My goal is to give this a better workout at Dragoncon, where I can carry lunch and snacks and juice boxes in the central compartment, carry my tablet in the laptop compartment, and also carry my camera, instead of slinging a lunchbox and my camera case over my shoulder. It seems like a much better option. I also see it being useful on the occasional weekend trip. If it works out for me, it's possible my husband might enjoy one as well.<br /><br />[September: This was really, really good at Dragoncon; I will be using a backpack again next year. Much better than carrying the lunchbox and the camera separately and wearing a pouch. I put my tablet in the laptop pocket, my lunch things (juice boxes, sandwiches, snacks, fruit) in the middle pocket, and the camera in the outermost pocket. The little pocket at the top held my spare cell phone batteries, and my wallet was in the hidden pocket. This backpack needs a strap at the bottom, and, instead of an iPod holder, a water bottle holder. That's the only thing I can see wrong with it. Yeah, I could have put a water bottle inside with my lunch.]<br /><br />[PS I liked this so much I bought my husband one for Christmas.]hrough it.

0425252868|5.0|When I first heard about the story behind these two courageous pilots, I could not believe what I was reading!<br />Charlie Brown (The B-17 Pilot) and Franz Stigler (The Bf-109) Pilot both showed amazing courage and combat<br />chivalry.  I've ordered the Model Set, but it is not available until &#34;November 2013&#34;.  Can't wait to get my hands on<br />it. I've read the book twice and still can't get enough of it!  Hope there will be a &#34;DVD&#34; coming out soon or perhaps<br />a full length feature Movie.  Hats off to their surviving family members.

B00DR0PDNE|4.0|So the way Chromecast is primarily intended to work is as a client for cloud-based services like Netflix that have been enhanced to specifically support the device. In those cases the cloud service is able to use whatever proprietary compression and DRM google has implemented to be able to stream at 1080p directly to your Chromecast.<br /><br />You start a movie on your phone and when you say \\"cast this to my TV\\" it doesn't start broadcasting from the phone, it simply sends a command to the Chromecast telling it to connect to Netflix (or wherever) and continue streaming the same content. This is great for performance and battery life on your phone, but it does mean that what's actually going on is not exactly what it might look like at first.<br /><br />However if your stream is coming from a local device in your house, such as casting a Chrome web browser tab or sending a local video file to it, then it appears that it will only do 720p quality video.<br /><br />Still a very useful gadget, but it's not currently usable as a local \\"dumb\\" WiFi to 1080p HDMI adapter unless it's pulling its data from an outside cloud provider. You can't send your own 1080p content to it.<br /><br />Of course it's new and much of this might be subject to change.<br /><br />G.
B004KPX4W2|4.0|Really watched this to be 'up to speed' for version 2. Sadly, had I just scrolled down in my DVR list, I already had it recorded off of ShowTime or HBO or one of them, and I could have saved the $2.99. Not Amazon's fault though. I am still amazed at how well the streaming works, even with HD content (given my crappy DSL broadband connection and the fact that I'm streaming via WiFi, not wired!) although I don't think, and I may be wrong, the surround sound is sent with the video - my system seemed to only be simulating 2 channels of sound out to the other speakers.
1455523550|5.0|Love the plot, the characters and the setting of the story. The story is just beautifully written, and i can imagine each scene vividly in my mind - if you start reading it, you would not want to put it down to the ending of the story (though i wish it had more pages at the end...)  Great stuff!
B004H4XDBI|3.0|I loved If I Stay, and when I found out that this book came out, I was so excited to read it and find out where she went (ha!). I finished the book because I 1. paid for it and 2. wanted to know what happened, but I was really disappointed it how it went. I would recommend it if you read the first one, but it's not a book I would rush out to buy.
B00846REIS|5.0|one of the best series I've ever read! I definitely suggest this series to all who love reading. I'm sure everyone will enjoy as much as I did!
B005FISBTO|5.0|I wished I had read the reviews before I bought both season 6 and 7. It started in season 5, but in season 6, and as I read it, season 7(haven't watched yet), the beginning of the discs have the worst advertisement for Showtime shows. As stated in previous comments, you cannot skip in any way the 2 minute \\"Showtime is awesome\\" ads. I get that Dexter is a Showtime show and that you might like other Showtime shows ( there are some I think would be interesting, but not to buy on dvds now), but that they made it impossible to skip to the show you bought and want to watch makes me mad and not want to buy/watch any of their other programs. Dexter is an amazing show, I think all of the seasons are worth owning to watch for the first time without commercials and all at once, and to re-watch, but Showtime ruined the positive reasons for waiting for the dvd set.

B004Q3SGWG|5.0|First of all, we love movies that are based on real life stories. This was an excellent depiction of what this gentleman went through during his 127 hour ordeal. Had to make life/death choice! Highly recommend it for the &#34;adventurous&#34; individual!!

B00338QENI|5.0|It seems silly to go over the \\"plot\\" of this biography of Mrs. Lacks again, so I will just say that this non-fiction work details how Mrs. Lacks and her family were lied to, misled, ill informed, taken advantage of and used by the medical community after her cancerous cells were found to be able to multiply indefinitely.  Without compensating, or even acknowledging, the person from whom the cells were obtained, her cells were first given away, then sold, in order to advance medical knowledge.<br />The book is exceptionally well written, reading at times like a medical thriller.  But at others, it serves as an introduction to medical/scientific ethics and experimentation.  Skloot writes clearly enough so that even those who failed high school biology will get the gist of the medical experience of the Lacks family.  Author Skloot becomes a major player in the book when she engages Henrietta's daughter, Deborah, as  friend, mentor and ally.  The author's involvement in the story and with the central players may become a topic for book groups to discuss.  How \\"disinterested\\" a writer can an author be when they are so intimately involved in their investigation that they become a part of the story.  Would the book have been a bestseller if Skloot was not a part of the story?  Could it even have been written?<br />Book groups will find the ethics of the various medical teams to be incredulous in the face of today's laws concerning medical privacy.  Groups may want to investigate the case of John Moore, a \\"modern\\" lapse of medical ethics, mentioned briefly in the book.

B009UNGYHG|3.0|Just got the case and my initial thought was how cheaply manufactured it felt.  Not only does it feel like there's wasted space, and the bottom is so hollow that it makes thunks when you tap it or place it on your desk.<br /><br />I bought it thinking that it might almost make up for Plantronics pulling their same proprietary charger crap again like they used to on all their old headsets.  While I can see using this when traveling, and maybe as a charger then since it allows for a micro-USB cable.<br /><br />In contrast to the actual Voyager Legend, the build-quality of the charge case is so cheap that I wonder how Plantronics gets away with charging nearly $30 for this.  For that much money I would have expected a much more solid feeling device, maybe even a brushed aluminum backing that wouldn't feel like it would shatter into a million pieces if I dropped it.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this game was awesome and I hope everybody else loves it. I love horses and this is the game for meeeee!
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|This game is much better than the first 3 Hungry Shark games. It's so great, one time I played for 18 minutes without a break. I mean you have to admit that there's a lot of detail to the rocks. This game is so awesome that it even has a map. Games don't get much better than this!:-)
B00D6BQG1W|4.0|I actually rented this movie and justified it to my wife by saying, &#34;Well think of it this way. We didn't waste as much money as we would if we saw it at the theater.&#34;<br /><br />This movie wasn't bad at all. It was a pretty good zombie movie.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I watched all three seasons in a week. This show is fascinating in that it looks into the life of aristocrats, but also their staff. There is plenty of drama, humor, and love, yet also an emotional rollercoaster. A hallmark of a great show!
B00DBSZEH2|3.0|I thought it was going to be a waste of money and we would just chalk it up to, &#34;yeah,we saw that.&#34;  The movie was rather entertaining to watch. I wouldn't say it was a waste.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|[Update Below: They now say that I will get the promotion, and that it will physically come with the device. Expect another update when I get it tomorrow.]<br /><br />[Update, Again: I did get the promo code emailed to me by Amazon. I'm satisfied, but spent about 3 hours of my time making sure that this would happen. Now that I got it for $11 I can say that I'm impressed by the Chromecast. But, not that impressed. It doesn't really do very much. Sharing a tab from Chrome is kind of cool, but not that useful. I'd like to share a tab from my phone, or something, but it's been over a month and nothing is materializing. And, Google has squashed one developer's homebrew app that allowed streaming content to the Chromecast. Looks like this device will be a dud because I don't give a cr@p about youtube videos on my TV and every device on the planet streams Netflix. Why would I buy this instead of a Roku?<br />Do yourself a favor and buy a Roku instead.<br /><br />I purchased this at 1:30 PM pacific time from Amazon by linking from the Google product website. After hearing of some confusion over the free netflix promotion, I decided to do some digging:<br />- I called Amazon customer service. They were unaware of the promotion at all. They suggested I call google since it was their product, and they provided me with a number.<br />- Google told me that the promotion wasn't honored if you purchased it from Amazon. I protested since I linked to Amazon from tgoogle's own product page and this difference wasn't made clear. They said there was nothing they could do. They suggested that I call Netflix since, strangely, they claimed that this wasn't even their promotion, it was Netflix's.<br /><br />I'm going to call Netflix, but I suspect that they won't claim responsibility. I don't blame them, really. I blame google. I could have easily purchased it from the google store if I had known there would be a 68% price difference! Jeez! That's mostly the reason I purchased it in the first place. It's already on its way and will be here tomorrow, so it's too late to cancel. I'm really p*ssed about this.<br /><br />Update:<br />- I contacted netflix. They actually seemed to be aware of what I was talking about! They told me that I should get the promotion no matter who I bought it from. However, they said that the promotion was Google's responsibility. They reiterated that they think that I should get the promotion and suggested that I contact Google again. Poop. Overall, though, they were much nicer and sounded much more informed that anyone else I talked to.<br /><br />- I contacted Google again. They told me AGAIN that they could do nothing for me and that I would not get the promotion because I purchased it through Netflix. I, again, asked to speak with a supervisor. After a minute the agent told me that he had new info. They now say that I WILL GET THE PROMOTION and that it will come with the device. Whew! I asked him to email that info to me for confirmation. He did. I'm satisfied for the moment. End.Story.
B0058YPL66|5.0|These are awesome! Ordered the second season right away!
0553801473|1.0|It seems (judging from his own website) martin has put ASOIAF for years on a backburner and has been milking (to put it mildly) his fame for years with plenty of unrelated side projects or pure merchandising .<br /><br />Too bad as the series started out very good, lets hope he finds a bit of his elan back in the conclusion of the series.<br /><br />The book itself is not as well written, overly long, has barely any progress on the main story And is now weirdly split up over volumes and in POV's .
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|..you guys are kidding right?  PLEZZZZZ, don't even waste your time with this, I only gave it a one cuss I couldn't go any lower!!<br />....COME ON GUYS...GET THE REAL THING!!

B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Really liked it. I would watch it again and highly encourage you to as well.  You won't be dissapointed. Really...
0307474275|1.0|I read The Da Vinci Code shortly after reading Umberto Eco's Foucault's Pendulum, so the story in Brown's novel was glaringly obvious.  When the characters realized something, I wondered what had taken them so long.  Of course, I'm not sure why this book has different names, since all the characters sound alike and do what the author needs them to do, not what they would out of their natures.  The flow is one of cliff hanger to cliff hanger, leaving me feeling jerked along, but since no time is given toward interesting things like character development or meaningful interaction, the reward in the next chapter for the cliff hanger is only the saving of characters that I have no emotional investment in.  I realize that this book is a thriller.  What I didn't find were any thrills.<br /><br />Review by the author of [[ASIN:0983687242 A Draft of Moonlight]]
B001DHXT2U|4.0|Not my thing , however my husband and son both liked the movie. It held my sons attention well and he seemed to be enjoying it.
B0097GVJWQ|4.0|the minigames were the only drawback for me...the instructions were not as full as I needed!  or I am just slow!  the game takes you all over the town and countryside but has a map that you can consult at any time so see where you need to go next...on the map there is a pin for where you are and a pin for where there are activities to perform...I enjoyed it...looking forward to sequel...
B00005JNBQ|5.0|Original,<br />Very quirky,<br />Very very funny<br />Very very very sweet.<br /><br />A rare gem. I highly recommend it for all ages
B003TTH4IU|5.0|Timeless . One of my favorite shows of all time . I can watch it over and over  it never get old.
B00886XQO0|5.0|The benefits of this headset exceeds expectations. The features are awesome but take a little time to figure out the hardware and preset settings. Once you do, it's on!
B004QX07G4|5.0|Would recommend if you like Ellen! Easy and quick read! Couldn't stop reading it, got me laughing. GET this book!
B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|It is a beautiful and sad story; I just felt that with all that drama, the writer could have given us a little bright side and showed how they moved on with their lives.  It was a very intense book and for me, it took the romance away very quick.
B009R659L8|3.0|This book kept me reading, but I don't consider it one of her best.  There were too many characters to keep track of which made it hard to stay focused, especially during the first half.  I found myself getting engrossed in some of the sub-plots which could have been developed into separate novels.  All in all, it was a good read, but it could have explored fewer characters on a deeper level.
B00COGXGNQ|5.0|Not only is the story line great, but the actors are so great together. Perfect for a girls night in!
B007U1FEJE|5.0|This is an exceptional late career recording of iconic artists. They sound as good as they did in the 60's. Highly recommended.
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|This was a great movie. The chemistry between Jennifer Lawrence and Bradley Cooper is great and really made the movie that much better. It's emotionally driven and definitely worth watching!!
B003QSMCKO|4.0|A good cartoon.  I didn't like the dragon very much but it was entertaining and a well made movie.  The kids liked it.
B002VECM4A|5.0|This movie is not for the faint of heart. It's very emotional and dramatic with some graphic a sad scenes. However, the story is incredible, as is the acting. This is one of my favorite movies! Definitely a must see!
B00BP4ZNFM|4.0|I liked this movie as a child.  It seems to be silly enough to not scare children while introducing them to the idea of aliens.
B000E1YW0E|5.0|This is an incredible movie and the music is addicting! I can watch this over and over again! Love it!
B0049J2BSM|5.0|My children liked this movie.  My husband even likes it.  It helps children not be afraid of monsters as much.
B00002SSKI|5.0|Perfect movie for a group of friends to watch on a girls night! Such a heartfelt story of 4 girlfriends who stick together until the end!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This series is amazing and I am anxiously awaiting Jan for Season 4. Superb acting, perfect costumes and amazing setttings.
6305657947|1.0|Never got the product because it wasn't delivered and they refused to send a replacement. Not worth it. It was supposed to be a gift and now I have to re-order, which is annoying because I don't want this scenario to happen again. Customer service did not help me at all either.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|take it or leave it it is still a very good game. you have your own opinion but i have mine.
B004WKH516|5.0|Has been one of my favorites since I first saw it as a young girl Veda's age!  Always recommend it to friends!
B00CWVG1Z8|3.0|Read the books, they were very good!!!  This movie doesn't follow the book hardly at all, very disappointing in that respect! I gave it 3 stars because as a movie it was just okay...I would have given it 2 and a half, but that wasn't an option.
B00CC9P99E|5.0|What a wonderful album. Plain and simple. If you like Lloyd Cole, this is a must. If you are not sure, but you like music with intelligent lyrics supported by complex musical backing played on typical rock instrumentation, this is a must. Something new pops out and catches my interest with each listen.
B0035XVVDY|5.0|Although I thought there could have been a better choice for the Jamie Foxx character, all in all a great movie. Not many movies I want to see more than once, but this is one of them. I would have liked a different ending, but...
B006VFLIYK|5.0|It is hard to put this book down. There is suspense at the end of every chapter and you want to keep reading.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|Quite frankly, if racists who have clearly not read a single page of the book, but are just furious about a \\"Mooslim writing about Christ\\" can give this a 1-star, then I too, without reading it can give it 5-stars.<br /><br />I don't pretend my review is of any real worth but all I know is Reza Aslan is an engaging writer and a solid intellectual who has done a tremendous amount of research for this book. So all I want to say is read it with an open mind and make your own conclusions. Many reviewers have posted solid critiques of the book and that is fantastic, but it is the most un-Christian and most un-American thing to attack an author simply because of his religion.<br /><br />Oh, and .... Aslan's wife and mother are Christians. *Minds explode*
B00994WQ78|5.0|This movie is one of my all time faves since I was a kid, and to see it in HD! It never gets old and is just as funny as the first time I saw it.
B00B1RB942|5.0|What the title says a great anime film loved every second of it and have actually watched it like 10 times since i bought it at the beginning of july
0312641893|5.0|I bought this book for my daughter who after picking it up from the library decided she just had to have it! She absolutely LOVES IT and can't wait for the next book of the series to come out!
B00CKOYVG8|3.0|This is OK if you have nothing else to do.  Thought it was fun at the start, but it got boring.  Like more challenging games for the brain.
B00BXUG0KU|5.0|Eliane Elias is really a gifted performer. She understands a song and gets to the real point of how it should be presented. She has a sultry voice and great piano skills.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|This is a challenging game.  I play it every day and more.  Always trying to better my score and to see if I can complete in lesser time.
B002AWJEU8|5.0|I have seen Steve Vai in concert 3 times. His mastery of the guitar is amazing!! This DVD really broadcasts his gift!! Prepare to be Mesmerized!! The musicians who accompany him are Top-notch... Do not take my word for it, purchase this concert and see for yourself.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|Interesting and fun and challenging, But I got so far, then I'm stuck.  Some math problem to unlock the next piece.  Oh well, need some help with that.
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|I heard about the game and wanted to get a free one first to try it out.  The guide without the game?  Not so good.  Also do you need to have an app toplay?
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Can't stop, must upgrade everything!!! Just when you think you're reached your goal it sucks you back in for more.
B002QGUFWE|5.0|Good variety of her first releases...and 2 CD's in the set for the price normally charged for one. Highly recommend...
B00AB7HESI|5.0|A fun and simple puzzle game for everyone, easily worth the price of 99 cents.  A few more levels would be a great addition though
B00454U1NS|4.0|If you are a Pink Fan, you will like this CD. The unrated version is what I purchased and I am good with it as I do not have teens at home to hear it.
B0018OHFK0|5.0|This is my favorite movie of all time, no matter how many times I watch it, it's still amazingly good.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|I love the Harry Potter books so I wanted to own all of the movies. This box set has all 8 movies for a great price. It would be so much more expensive to buy all 8 movies separately. The dvds are clear and there are no previews which is great. I highly recommend this to anyone who just wants to own the movies. If you are looking for a true collector's set then this isn't for you.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|it works great.<br />my son would sleep with it if i let him.<br />delivery was perfect.<br />registering was easy, user-friendly.
B00B2G2RG6|4.0|This was a very suspenseful and action packed thriller series. My wife and I are anxiously awaiting season 2.  I only gave it 4 stars since there are numerous holes in the story line.
B004VMUS9G|4.0|This app is easy to use. Especially if you only need it for just an alarm. I like the easy set up and the fact that you can use your own music to set up the alarm. I didnt pay for the ad free one but this one works just as well. I only need it for an alarm and nothing else the app provides so didn't seem to need to pay the extra money. I have set up three different alarms and all three has worked. I don't know if you can do more for I haven't tried it hey.
B0046B8GEQ|4.0|Good for kids to see that people who don't seem so great at first can change, and become loving and respectful.
B000UX6THK|5.0|It was the most innovative, creative series on TV at the time it was introduced. The Complete Series Gold Box edition brings all of the amazing characters, the creativity and the quirkiness right back to me. I love it still.
B004T32SOK|5.0|Box has its issues on the pc, but the android app is just what you would think it was, an app to download files to the android.
B00A6RCSKC|5.0|I have played this on the computer but this is better. On the computer you have to buy heros with points but not on here all you have to do is unlock them by playing it. That's the only real difference between this and the computer version and both are awesome.
B006LRUVUA|5.0|Works just like the PC version.  It's teamviewer, its free.  What else can I say?  I need 5 more words to submit this review
B00D2K40WY|3.0|My little cousin loves this app but gets bum when she can't use all the makeup and stuff she wants to use but over all a good app
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Awesome game and I love it! It is very realistic and teaches people how to raise a horse! I love it and will play it
B006S01GH2|5.0|Fun and entertaining. I couldn't get enough of the star. She is adorable, unpredictable and very entertaining. I could and willwatch this movie more than once.
B0063IH60K|2.0|My husband loves to play solitaire on the computer but he couldn't figure out how to play it on our kindle fire 8.9.  Granted we are up in age (in our 70's) and this kindle is new to us.  Is there another version of solitaire that may be easier on this kindle?  Thanks.
B0058YPLA2|5.0|Once Upon a Time is a lot of fun to watch.  Owning it on blu ray makes for hours of entertainment and always better than sitting through commercials.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I absolutely Adore this app! I used to have a hard time falling asleep at night but now with this app, I just set it to the sound/s I want to listen to and I'm out within just a few minutes. I love how customizable it is. You can mix and match sounds to work for whatever mood you're in that night. And it's free!! The only downside I've found is the lack of a timer. I've fallen asleep with it running and it was still on 6 hours later, really draining my battery. But still a great app to have.
B00CRVZRUS|5.0|Very impressive. Crystal clear restoration!  Excellent sound! Well worth the wait. Overall exceptional quality.  Happy that this film has finally been released!
B000FC130E|5.0|I enjoy this type of book ad you never really know what to expect from the story next.  If you enjoyed Anansi boys then you will almost certainly enjoy this.
B009C7ZQM4|2.0|This application does a great job of turning off all of those pesky programs that keep running in the background. There's only one problem with this: it considered my phone conversations to be one of the applications needing to be killed. Several times, I had conversations completely cut off because of this application. Also, this application puts ads in your top status bar that have to be cleared daily. If these two problems were corrected, I could go from two stars to 5 very easily.
B0087ZG7UW|5.0|Hitchcock was the best.  Love this movie, bought this copy for my daughter and her husband, they loved it too.
B00C7JGDBW|5.0|Beautifully done well crafted story that kept us thinking about it. Each time we play it again we see more interesting subtleties.<br />The characters were very appealing. James Franco made a love-able rascal. There are a lot of wonderful twist and surprises.<br />The women are beautiful and the wicked witches terrifying. It echos the The Wizard of Oz in it's format, compatible story-line<br />and ambiance. It is a perfect prequel to it. Always we feel so uplifted by this movie. It's perfect for family viewing.<br />It is a brand new classic!
B004HWYTP4|5.0|This movie was a cross between Oceans (11, 12, 13) and Bourne (1, 2, 3) but with senior citizens. Whoever said that age and treachery will always beat youth and skill nailed it on this one. Lots of fun through the whole episode.
B007SGM084|5.0|I had read the original fan-fiction of this story as E.L. was writing it.  I did not have the luxury of burning through the pages as you can in this re-vamped version.  It was beautiful torture, I had to wait for each and every chapter to come out.  This was a fantastic read, but not just for the reason everyone heard about this book.  The love story and both characters growing so much, that is why I loved it.
B00BL5YQKS|5.0|I used to arrange my work schedule to be able to watch the new episodes every Tuesday night. Now that it's streaming, I enjoy the fact that I can hang out on the couch once all caught up with life and watch an episode (even though I do own all of the seasons on DVD).
B0057KXXFM|4.0|Was a huge fan when i was in grade school. Still am. Saw this album new I needed to hear it. Like how it has songs that sound like all of their different albums put together.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|Great movie, funny! Wonderful for all ages old, young, n more! I'm glad they have continued making pics like this it's very healthy to laugh...
B000ULQV0W|5.0|I'm a big fan of Pearl Jam.  Love all their stuff.  This album is great.  Several great songs  - Rise, Hard Sun and Society all rock!  Short album.  Wish it was a bit longer :(
B0040HO01Y|5.0|I just love this series!  It has interesting story, colorful, whimsical characters and beautiful scenery.  Each episode makes me feel good and leaves me wanting more.  I put it up there with Road to Avonlea (my favorite of all times), Downton Abby, Anne of Green Gables and Emily of New Moon.  Great series!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This is so different from anything I normally read. A good friend of mine recommended it and she and I have similar taste. Because she raved about it I bit the bullet and read the trilogy. So glad I did! This is one of the best Ive ever read. The first book was my favorite but you really must read all of them to get the full story.
0062200399|5.0|Neil Gaiman intentionally asked the publisher to make the book in a fantasy retro style. I bought this specifically to get it signed by Gaiman (as all I owned was a well-used paperback of the book) and it was worth every penny.
0345529057|5.0|I have always been sort of a bookworm. I have been watching the show on HBO and love it. I have just started the books, as in most cases the books are better than the shows or movies. witch ever the case may be
B00CBKLO52|1.0|want games that are fun and exciting this was just hard and boring. Liked the sceneery but not much else
B008M4MB8K|5.0|I bought this because it had the original theatrical release that is narrated by Harrison Ford. I believe it had the philosophy behind the movie/book and although Ford did not like the narration, there are some scenes that make the movie a classic sci-fi. I've looked for years to get that rendition of the movie and now I have it!
B00CH87HF4|4.0|Nice graphics, great music. The  characters are great and easy to control. La mejor parte es la m&uacute;sica, en un juego bien logrado para los amantes de la aventura
B006BDHAX0|2.0|I tried the free version, and liked it enough to buy the full version. I would have rated it 4 stars (or 5 if it didn't have bugs), but after playing for a month, it reverted to the free version complete with annoying ads. If it doesn't get fixed, I'll come back and give it only ONE star.
B002KEDQJQ|4.0|Yet another directors cut that falls short. The additional scenes were out of place and unnecessary. They do not add anything to the film.
B0055QYKQO|1.0|After installation of 32GB RAM (via 4 8GB chips), the BIOS (version FB) reports 32GB, so does the app called CPU-Z.  But Windows itself recognizes only half, regardless of how many chips I install or in which slots.  So, of 32GB total, 16GB is usable in Windows.  The remaining is described as \\"Hardware Reserved\\" and therefore unusable.  Believe me I tried a million different settings and researched online heavily but nothing seems to solve it.<br /><br />I re-installed Windows 8 twice and all of Gigabytes drivers, same result.  I opened a Gigabyte Tech Support case, and the response is:  \\"How Windows detect the memory and the amount of memory usage is beyond our control\\".  So, no ideas or support from them.  I will return the board.<br /><br />I will re-install my existing MSI motherboard and continue using it with the same RAM.  I had purchased this new board because it supported RAID.  But I need the full 32GB more, since I run several Hyper-V's in my development system.<br /><br />As a note, the memory is recently bought, made by Crucial.  Gigabyte tech support ignored my request to recommend any 8GB chips that are compatible with this motherboard.  The online documentation suggests many 1 and 2 GB chips, but only one 8GB chip (from Samsung), but Google cannot find it anywhere so that is not a solution.  I am sure the business of designing, manufacturing and supporting motherboards is extremely complex.  Too bad there is not a way to fix this situation.
143350393X|5.0|I still like having my old NIV as well but this bible offers so much insight into the details. A fantastic copy and the price was perfect and much cheaper than any of the christian book stores I went to
B002R5QPRI|5.0|Took this long to get it because I was busy.  Just wanted to sit down and enjoy. Well worth the wait.  Well.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Who doesn't love these adorable little yellow minions?? This game is super simple ... run, jump, duck and sometimes tilt your device. And it's super addicting. You keep playing over and over again trying to bet your previous score.
B002WV5A9G|5.0|If you are a Trekkie fan, this is your drug. If you are a sci-fi fan, this is a steak dinner. If you like to be entertained, this is just fine. I can't get enough of it...I'm hopeless...
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I'm a guy so I'm not completely a fanatic about horses but this is changing me! It's crazy but I would say that this is more like having a horse in ur backyard than other simulators.
B004HWYTP4|4.0|This movie isn't going to win any awards but it is fun to watch. I like almost anything with Morgan Freeman.
B006Y9BVRM|5.0|This is a great dive watch. I love the added functionality of the chronograph and solar power. The luminosity is blazing bright.  As others have noted the band is stiff and uncomfortable, but I will switch it out with [[ASIN:B0081OZP34 20mm SOLID 316L Stainless Steel Super Oyster Straight End Watch Band-PVD Black]]
B000YMJA7I|4.0|I like the fact that you can download the whole album to cloud player which I recomend to everyone to listen to music
B003BW0CB6|3.0|The Lincoln Lawyer was an interesting perspective on an ethically challenged criminal defense lawyer.  While one could take issue with his choices and the way the system was depicted, it was an interesting book.  In the The Reversal, there are two reversals.  First, that of the bad guy, who is awarded a new trial and second the recruitment of the Lincoln Lawyer to be the prosecutor at the new trial.  Connelly has made this a cross-over novel, bringing in his detective protagonist Harry Bosch from his other main series.  There are some hard to swallow portions of this, e.g. when it turns out that Harry is related to Micky Haller yet has never met his ex-wife (and mother of his daughter).  The real problem with this book is that it is not realistic.  Events happen at trial that either would not be allowed in real life or simply wouldn't occur.  The resolution of the book is contrived and extreme and leaves the reader unsatisfied.  Simple mistakes exist throughout, many of them minor, but still irritating.  For example the case is referred to as California vs. the Defendant.  Anyone who has set foot in a California criminal court knows that the case would be referred to as &#34;The People&#34; vs. the Defendant.  That's a minor error, but you wonder where the editor and the legal advisor were when they should have caught this.  In all, this was not a very interesting read and I would not recommend it.
B008673ZAQ|3.0|Not anywhere near as good as Grey. Grey had me dreaming of being loved and adored by Christian. I just wanna leave this jerk!
B004HWYTP4|4.0|I especially like Helen Merrin.<br />Action is a farce and has some really funny parts.<br />As entertainment, it rates as one of the best.
B003V2HWP0|5.0|This is a very old film. I saw it years ago as an alternative film. I loved having it available. Thank You Amazon!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I always enjoy reading Nicholas Sparks, and this book was no different!  As usual, it was much better than the movie.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|I love this game. I am addicted to it, even more than candy crush saga. I  get annoyed with how fast I use my coins. If coins regenerated quicker, game would be perfect.
B005NPCUC8|1.0|The first song on the playlist, Us and Them, ends abruptly before proceeding to next song. In other words, it is cut off. I would call this not a very good remastered album and you can save money by not buying this product. Buy the CD instead. This product does a dis-service to the group as well as anyone who buys this.
0307887960|5.0|Great product! I love it, and it works just as advertised. I would recommend it to anyone, even if I didn't know them.
B0006J28MI|5.0|I really liked this movie it was funny and it teaches you to not to underestimate kids at what they can do if you would teach them
B001NLKZUA|5.0|I loved this book! !!  It was suspenseful and exciting ! The whole Jace being her brother was kind of gross though . I was happy when they said they weren't
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|I have been reading Jack Reacher novels in no particular order and have loved every one of the probably 10+ I've read.  This is the first in the series and it was great to learn the beginnings of the saga.  I especially loved the authors intro in the kindle version I read that gave insight into how he developed the character and the plot.  What a great premise to base a story / series on!<br />Reacher will keep you on the edge of your seat and generally unable to predict the end - time after time - through every book in the series !  Try it - you'll love it !
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Finally got my hands on one. My first impression- \\"This is exactly what I didn't know I had been searching for!\\" I have tried many other device-to-tv streaming services, but most have failed to impress. All of them seemed to be unreasonably priced for the limited amount of things they could do, and the cheap ones like the Android Smart TV Sticks just never ran as smoothly as I had hoped.<br />The Chromecast is as easy to use as it looks. On the inside of the box, there is a 3-step process: 1) Plug it in, 2) Switch input, and 3) Set it up. Within minutes, I had fired up Arrested Development on my Galaxy S4, and was able to pause it from my iPad. Beautiful.<br />I love how Chromecast streams from the cloud rather than the device, so it frees you up to use your device while still watching video.<br />I tried out the Chrome Browser as well. Google is still currently working on getting this to run smoother, but as is, it's a little laggy with video a little choppy. Not quite as smooth as Netflix or Youtube, but still doable. I'd imagine the fact that it's still in beta has something to do with it...<br />Currently we can only stream content from Youtube, Netflix, Chrome (beta), and Google Play. However, from the remarks made in the conference, I have confidence we are going to see many more amazing things that this little, affordable device will be able to offer us.<br />Bottom line: Unbeatable Price for an Unbeatable Product<br /><br />Update: I have now used it with my MacBook, iPad, and Galaxy S4, and it runs very smoothly with each of these devices. I was curious, so I tried it on a couple of different TV's and also with my computer monitor. I found that I only had to set it up once on my network, and after that, all I had to do was plug it in and hit play on my device! When unplugging it from the monitor, I didn't hit pause on my phone just to see how the dongle could handle it. Netflix instantly paused. When I plugged it back into the TV, all I had to do was hit play, and it resumed where I had left off. Brilliant.
B0091WNK8M|5.0|What kid would't want to find prates treasure map hidden away in the attic. The Legend of One Eye Willy and the clues left by the last explorer Chester Cooperpot lead you into an adventure filled with monsters, traps, and villians. This is a great movie for young and old that crave adventure. With the backdrop of good ol 80's rock you will love this movie.
B000002JSN|1.0|the cd is in bad shape could not put it in my library.the songs skip and it will not play
