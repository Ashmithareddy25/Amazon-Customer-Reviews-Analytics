B003XF1XOQ|2.0|I wish I never read any of these books.. this last one especially.  The bit about Buttercup at the end was too much  too painful to read.  There wasnt necessary closure between Gale and Catnip either.. but perhaps that was what the author wanted.  The ending is not &#34;happy ever after&#34; rather it is just what one does with loss..you pick up the pieces and do the best you can.

B004HO6I4M|3.0|\\"Rio\\"  (Twentieth Century Fox, 2011)  --------------------------------  I didn't have high hopes for this one, and was still disappointed with what I got.  Weak characters, cookie-cutter plot, borderline racism in the presentation of the Brazilian characters and, worst of all, the samba was way, way watered down.  I mean, seriously... if you're going to do a movie set in Brazil, play some real samba music, not the bland R&B mix this film wallows in.  Also, did Tracy Morgan really have to be the voice of the Brazilian everyman -- er, bird -- gettin' all funky with his natural self and acting all street and spouting all that tacky, dated slang?  Are there no Brazilians to hire for these roles?  Sure, there's hip-hop culture in Brazil, but was it really necessary to present such a North Americanized version of it in an attempt to make this film, I dunno... more accessible to some imaginary version of an American audience that couldn't handle the Brazilians seeming more Brazilian?  It's just one aspect of a general tepidness that drags this film down... Some pretty colors, but otherwise a rather leaden production, with a predictable plot that just drags itself to the finish line as we wait and wait and wait for it to be over.  I suppose if the music had been better, I might not have been so annoyed, but as it was, this flick evaporated from my mind the moment we left the theatre.  3.5 would be about the right rating.

B004H1V5RU|5.0|I bought the original Superplexus that was made by Tiger Electronics when it was on clearance at a toy store about 8 years ago. This toy is not quite as high quality as the original was. But this maze is even better. The original was made of two thick, hard, clear plastic shells, that were screwed together. This versions housing is very thin, and can be dented with a finger, (don't press too hard or that dent will become permanent). The new Playsmart models also don't have any electronics in them. Although they didn't do much more than keep time and beep in the original anyway.    The ball on this model does get hung around the middle quite often, (near the blue ring on the outside) and more than it should. This can lead to having to smack it to free the ball. More than likely this is where the breakage issues people are reporting are coming from. The good news, is that this toy is covered under a really neat thing called a warranty. Both Amazon, and the company that makes the Epic, will replace them if they break, (within reason of course). If it breaks within the first few weeks, return it to Amazon for exchange. They'll even cover postage both ways. If it breaks after that, contact the manufacturer Playsmart. Look at the comments section in any neg. review here, and you'll see that they care, and want to fix any defects.    Now, on to the rest of the review...    This model has several features that make it an improvement over the original Superplexus. The numbers are easier to see than they used to be, (but still not as easy as they could be. How about some black paint!) and the Epic comes with a stand!   This version is also quieter because of the softer clear housing. The maze is even more amazing than the originals was, since it has an extra 25 obstacles. This version has teeter-totters, and funnels, and stairs, (oh my!).     It's a real challenge to get through everything, and well worth the $. Once you start playing with it you won't want to put it down. Even when you aren't playing with it, it makes for an awesome decoration. A true piece of art.     The Epic also has several places along the maze that allow you to start further along, so you don't have to start from the beginning every time. This is handy if you need to practice a hard spot further along. A great hands-on toy that doesn't need electricity.
B004T0XYM8|5.0|This is the best western of all time and the soundtrack is way up there as well but be warned if you are not able to appreciate good quality cinema and find yourself enjoying more of the mindless action shoot em up genre, this is probably not for you. It may take 2 or 3 viewings to fully appreciate this film just because there is so much to take in but once it clicks you will keep coming back just to admire the cinematography, soundtrack, dialogue, etc... Once upon a time in America is very much done in the same style as this movie but falls way short in my opinion. Once Upon A Time In The West is Sergio Leone's masterpiece and I cannot wait to own the blu-ray version of this movie. It already looks great in DVD upscaling for a movie that is well over 40 years old. There aren't too many movies that truly deserve five stars but this movie, without hesitation, is a true five star movie!
B000LB7G00|5.0|For years, I have been working on 3D CAD stations using a regular mouse and keyboard controls. The last company I worked for allowed me to purchase the SpaceNavigator. It took some getting use to, but in no time at all I felt like I had been using it for years. When I started using my laptop more for 3D CAD I finally decided, I could not go any longer without my own unit. Again, it takes some time to get use to all of the possible movements. Trying to perform one movement like \\"Zoom\\" without also having the model rotate can be difficult. You need to practice, practice, and practice.    The SpaceNavigator is set up on a Toshiba Laptop running Win 7 Ultimate x64 and SolidWorks 2011. When I started to load the software it asked if I wanted to check for updates. I selected Yes and found that there was one. Once the update was installed I plugged in the SpaceNavigator and I was up and running, no problems.    Hint: I found that in the control software you are able to turn off the blue leds.

0061353248|5.0|I found this book to be incredibly interesting. It's the one book I constantly find my self asking people if they've read; and if not, recommending it! There are so many parts of this book that made me really stop and think about my everyday life and how I make my decisions.    Each chapter is it's own experiment, so it's an easy read in that sense. I don't even know what else to say without giving too much away... buy it, read it! I bought this book for my mom for her birthday, and she loves it too!
B0051QO4QY|3.0|I was looking forward to this album for months, and with it being billed (by her) as her best album yet, I was expecting something amazing.  I was a bit disappointed.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, the album is good, but it is lacking in so many ways.  First of all, it felt like it was either extremely rushed or just not well written and produced.  Many of the songs sounded not only similar to past songs by other artists, but similar to one another.  There were few songs that stood out on their own, which was really disappointing.  After her debut of The Fame and its extended play edition of The Fame Monster, I was expecting something really amazing.  Both of those albums had something special in them, but Born This Way didn't.<br /><br />Aside from the already released singles, the quality of the songs on the album was really and truly lacking.  Sure, there were some that were enjoyable, i.e. Fashion of His Love, but there weren't enough to help this album live up to its hype.  Part of what made this album miss the mark was the recycled sounds of '80s songs.  Another failing of this album was the continued use of religious imagery.  It's okay to use such imagery in one song, maybe two, but it seemed like every other song on the album was about something religious.  Honestly, it got tiring.<br /><br />I know that the album is a success, and that isn't surprising.  Gaga fans are extremely loyal, but I think that if Gaga really wants to stick around as a major artist, she is going to have to up her game.  If she keeps putting out albums that are (in essence) flops artistically, I don't see how she'll be taken seriously in years to come.
B004XDYJRU|5.0|A genius app. This doesn't just stream every radio station in the world; for some stations (like NPR) it can locate and play particular episodes of radio shows, like a podcast catcher but without the need to subscribe. Very smart user interface. Recent version seems to have improved buffering.
B001VLXNLU|4.0|I'm a big fan of fantasy, especially anything to do with vampires, but even so I'm usually skeptical about picking up a new series. The cover for this book caught my eye immediately. The title, while intriguing, didn't do a lot to tell me about the story. Zoey is a character every girl can relate to right off the bat. She has problems with school, boys, and family just like every other teenager. She's witty and sarcastic in a lovable way. The first page was a real gripper. The line about seeing the dead kid at her locker is something that you can't forget. Not only is Zoey dealing with all of the regular teenage issues life throws at her, she learns she's been marked to attend a vampire school. She'll either become a full-fledged vampire in the end, or die.<br /><br />Mother and daughter writers PC and Kristin Cast are brilliant in this coming-of-age story that spotlights the trials that young adults face and the friendships and bonds that form from experiencing something new. Fans of authors such as Stephenie Meyer, Richelle Mead, LJ Smith, and Ellen Schrieber will fall in love with Zoey and her friends at the House of Night school.

0142437611|5.0|Originally published in 1957, Saul Bellow's Seize the Day is considered one of the twentieth century's finest works of fiction. It chronicles a single day in the life of one Tommy Wilhelm, a failed middle-aged actor, living on a precipice. Out of work, nearly broke, and estranged from his wife and children, he is haunted by all of the setbacks in his life and is searching for salvation in the form of an easy financial win that will solve all of his problems.  On the advice of a mysterious psychologist, Dr. Tamkin, he has invested the last of his savings in the commodities market.  Dr. Tamkin's advice extends beyond investing and he provides advice to Wilhelm on how he should shed the burdens of his failed past and live in the here-and-now, in other words, to \\"Seize the Day.\\"<br /><br />Tamkin's council and Wilhelm's inability to shed his burdens only serve to heighten Wilhelm's sense of failure.  Wherever he seeks sympathy, whether it be his estranged wife who continues to make financial demands on him while refusing to divorce him or his father, a comfortably retired doctor, finds nothing but reminders of his failures.<br /><br />Born Wilhelm Adler, he changes his name to Tommy Wilhelm to further his acting career.  His career never takes off and so he fails in his attempt to actually become Tommy Wilhelm, a failure he is constantly reminded of by his father who insists on addressing him as \\"Wilky,\\" his childhood name.<br /><br />Seize the Day is a distinctly American story.  Whereas British fiction from Daniel Defoe on up through today's Ian McEwan is preoccupied by social and economic class distinctions, American society prides itself on being free from class.  No matter what station we are born into, we believe that through hard work, perseverance, and strength of character we can succeed.  If we do not succeed, it is obviously due to some flaw in our character.  American fiction has always explored the chasm that exists between that Great American Ideal (and mythology) and the stark reality that the Universe has no concept of fairness.  American literary characters, unlike their British counterparts, are therefore imbued with a greater sense of anomie. While British heroes and heroines may struggle to overcome the rigid class distinctions in their society, and usually fail, there is at least the idea that there is a sense of order in the Universe, no matter how harsh it may be. American literary figures, from Dreiser's Clyde Griffiths to Fitzgerald's James Gatz to Salinger's Holden Caulfield to Miller's Willy Loman, fight not against society but against nothingness.<br /><br />Years after writing Seize the Day, Bellow said in interviews that never liked Tommy Wilhelm very much.  Indeed, Wilhelm is not particularly likable and the reader is likely to feel as much sympathy for him as the other characters in the novella.  \\"Stop whining, be a man, get a job!\\" we want to say to him.  And yet, the story is compelling and unconsciously reaches those hidden parts of our psyche that fear the stark nothingness, and leads us to the novella's surprisingly cathartic conclusion.eality that the Universe has no concept of fairness.

B004TJ1H3C|5.0|I'll just say it now - I did not like Season One of Stargate Universe.  It was plodding, boring, and rather uninspired, taking way too much from both Battlestar Galactica and Star Trek: Voyager.  The season certainly improved, but when Season Two premiered on SyFy, I didn't bother watching.  (For the record, I'd give Season One three stars out of five).    However, I did still keep tabs on the series.  And imagine my surprise when I heard that the show was actually starting to get good.  In fact, by mid-season, most people were saying that the series had finally found its footing and was moving forward in a solid direction.  I thought about watching it again.  But then SyFy went and cancelled it, so I figured there wasn't any point.  It wasn't until after the final episode aired that I finally decided to sit down and watch Season Two of Stargate Universe.  And it was pretty fantastic.    First off, Season Two is incredibly streamlined.  Nearly all of the episodes contribute to some ongoing story, whether it's a Lucian Alliance attack on Earth, tensions among the crew members, or Rush's discovery of the bridge (and the true mission) of Destiny.  This makes the show much more watchable than it was in Season One, but it also has a real sense of urgency to it.  There's no time to mess around in this season, and I would say that there's really only two or three episodes that don't contribute much to the overall story.    Season Two is also significantly darker, and I was very pleased with that.  When SGU first premiered, we were promised a dark, character-driven entry in the Stargate canon.  Season One did not provide us with that, but Season Two brings it in spades.  Characters are permanently killed off (except for Telford - they've killed his as much as Daniel Jackson), and this has a real effect on people.  Events are set in motion in earlier episodes that have major repercussions later on down the line, and it's very rewarding to see this kind of payoff.    One thing that was not a problem in Season One was the acting, and I'm happy to report that it's just as good in Season Two.  Robert Carlyle is fantastic as Dr. Nicholas Rush (easily the most unique and interesting character on the show), and the rest of the cast brings their A-game as well.  Louis Ferreira has quite a few great moments as Colonel Young, David Blue gets to show his acting chops as Eli Wallace, and Alaina Huffman is great as Tamara Johansen.  All of these characters are put through the wringer, and all of these actors do a great job with it.    SGU's production values are also top-notch.  This season showcases the best visual effects that the Stargate franchise has seen, and that's saying something.  The music is also much better this season; gone (for the most part) are those annoying musical interludes, as they are replaced by instrumental score.  New aliens and threats are also introduced that have a very different feel and are quite unique.  Overall, Season Two throws a lot of new stuff at the seasoned Stargate viewer, even after sixteen seasons of television.    If you haven't figured it out by now, I loved Season Two of Stargate Universe.  When SGU was announced, I knew that it had potential, so I was disappointed when Season One fell short of that great potential.  Season Two, however, fully realizes the potential that Stargate Universe had.  It is incredibly disappointing to see such a fantastic series end well before its time.  One can only imagine what the show would have done if it had continued on.  However, despite the fact that SGU ends prematurely, Season Two is still well worth the ride.  For individual episode recommendations, Aftermath, The Greater Good, and Twin Destinies are all great.  And Epilogue is easily one of the best hours of television in the entire Stargate franchise.  If you're a fan of Stargate, science fiction, or just good television, do yourself a favor and pick up Season Two of Stargate Universe.  You won't regret it.
B004J4WN0I|4.0|This book made me laugh out loud in sheer delight more than once.  A kick-ass Druid, his sidekick wolfhound, witches, werewolves, gods, demons and a retiree sounds like a huge mess, but Mr. Hearne manages to turn it into a fast-paced, very clever series opener.<br /><br />Although I knew that everything would turn out alright-there's none of the soul-wrenching darkness in some UF, I still loved the ride that it took to get there.  The magic worked for me and to anyone who might complain that Atticus had too much power, I'd point out that he's been around for 2000 years, he'd be incompetent if he had less.<br /><br />The world that Atticus lives in is big enough to handle any number of sequels as well as a spin-off or two for a couple of characters.  All in all, it reminded me just how fun UF can be when done right. Not everything has to be doom, gloom and angst.<br /><br />I loved Atticus O'Sullivan. He has the right amount of snark, cheerfulness and the arrogance of being around for a couple of millennia.  I wondered if I could introduce him to Kate Daniels; I think they'd end up great friends.<br /><br />I enjoyed this book enough to put the writer on my instabuy list, and can't wait for books two and three which will be coming out later this year.<br /><br />Favorite line: Did she think I was some sort of lame-assed neo-Druid mucking about with holly branches and mistletoe?
0307454541|3.0|I finished reading this book a few days ago, and it has left a huge impression on me, I can't stop thinking about it, and usually that's a good thing. The main plots are the mystery of the disappearance of Harriet Vanger, whose uncle hires Mikael Blomkvist, a journalist with a tarnished reputation, to investigate the events that led to her disappearance, and uncovering the corruption within the Wennestrom corporation, a major industrial force in Sweden, and the reason for Mikael's professional demise as a journalist. The author doesn't do a very good job at keeping the suspense in either one of these plots- the information that's presented is so scattered that it's difficult to follow with an interest, for me it was just mild curiosity that kept me reading.<br /><br />SPOILERS BELOW<br />  The interesting twist for me was figuring out Lisbeth Salander, the young woman who is highly intelligent, a computer hacker, and a private investigator who helps Blomkvist with his research and eventually falls in love with him. She is considered by the state mentally incapacitated, she has a number of tattoos and piercings, and leads a rather dubious lifestyle. She is also very opinionated about people's own responsibility for their actions as opposed to their upbringing and socialization, and she stands up to victims of sexual abuse, and even though she herself becomes a victim of sexual abuse, she never once acts the way a victim would- she simply strikes back and defends herself. She is someone I was able to look up to, regardless of the fact that she has no social skills and has trouble trusting anyone. Eventually, Lisbeth makes the mistake of falling in love with Blomkvist, which makes her an even more likeable character, because despite her hard shell she shows vulnerability.<br /><br />  Overall, while i didn't think this was a great mystery and suspense book, I enjoyed reading about Salander and speculating what her past would reveal. I thought the ending was unsatisfying, because i would have enjoyed it if Salander opened up to Blomkvist more and shared her own experiences with abuse and she revealed what happened to her, that was only once referenced as The Great Evil that happened in Salander's past.ld have enjoyed it if Salander opened up to Blomkvist more and shared her own experiences with abuse and she revealed what happened to her, that was only once referenced as The Great Evil that happened in Salander's past.
B004IFYMWK|5.0|I watched the Valerie Plame hearing on TV when it was shown.  What got us in the Iraq war amoung other things was what had been done to the Wilsons when Joe Wilson wrote his op-ed about Niger not selling anything to Saddam Huessen.  This goes into more of their behind the scenes life & how Joe Wilson fought what the G.W. Bush admin was putting out especially V.P. Cheney.  But even though Cheney was behind it all & \\"Scooter\\" Libby took the fall for him & when Scooter was sentenced, Bush IMMEDIATELY pardoned him before he even spent a day in prison (he did pay a $250.000.00 fine & lost his Lawyers license) but they in my estimation WERE THE WINNERS.  Joe Wilson & Valerie Plame came out clean but the administration was raked over the coals.  At the end of the movie it shows Valerie Plame walking into the Capital to testify---that was her.  IF YOU WANT TO LEARN HOW OUR GOVERNMENT CAN TURN LIES INTO THE TRUTH----YOU NEED TO WATCH THIS MOVIE.  BUSH HAD SAID ON TV WHEN THEY \\"OUTED\\" HER THAT IF ANYONE IN HIS ADMINISTRATION HAD ANYTHING TO DO WITH IT HE WOULD FIRE THEM.  YOU GUESSED IT------NO ONE WAS FIRED---ANOTHER LIE STRAIGHT FROM THE PRESIDENT IN REAL TIME.  So enjoy the movie---it's good.
B000003S5H|5.0|I'm a collector of ambient & electronic music, from Jean Michel Jarre to Eno to Ulrich Schnauss, music from the very masters of electronica. This album had somehow slipped through the cracks for me. What a masterpiece! It brings back all sorts of memories, like perhaps I heard it in the background through the 90's & 00's but never knew what it was. A truly brilliant album. Put it on your Ipod to listen to at 38,000 feet, put it on for some sophisticated background sounds at your party, or put it on just to listen to. A true pleasure.
B004IQMXD4|1.0|Stevie Nicks' best album? In your dreams! I'm sorry but that pun is sarcastic and totally intended. She has been on a steady decline ever after 'Rock a little (1985)'. This new album does have a new sound compared which her first 4 albums. Unfortunatelly it's the sound of forgettable music. This is a new low really. I'd choose &#34;Street angel&#34; over this and that album really is mediocre.  I was hoping for at least something good on this album. &#34;Moonlight&#34; starts out really good. It's virtually the same as &#34;Lady from the mountain&#34;, my favorite demo. Unfortunatelly it continues with a new bloated forgettable chorus. Whatever happened to 'less is more'? &#34;Annabel Lee&#34; is my other rare favorite on this album. That's also an older song.  I really hope Stevie Nicks is going to do just one more set with all her remaining demos and outtakes + &#34;Buckingham Nicks&#34; on digital format. That would really be interesting. Other than that, Stevie Nicks (and Dave Stewart) please stop embarassing yourself and retire.  Disclosure: I'm a softcore fan of Fleetwood Mac, Stevie Nicks and especially Lindsey Buckingham since 20+ years. The latter has impressed me. His last two albums (2006 and 2008) are so much better than this. EDIT: love Lindsey's 2011 album. Man, he's only getting better with age! Simply amazing. Certainly can't say that about Stevie...  At the time of the release of 'Street angel' and Fleetwood Mac's 'Time' I was excited about the tracks on those albums. But it didn't take long to realise that the albums really weren't that good. I've grown up after that and no longer I'm excited just because there's a certain name on the sleeve. I'd encourage any 5 star-raters of this album to grow up too.  ** UPDATE ** ============ Looking back at my own review, I'm not going to take anything back, but add some more comments about the music mainly. The standard 'You only listened to the samples' or 'The cd will grow on you' doesn't apply. Well, my impressions do change actually, but they are only getting worse. That is not a good sign.  So about half of the people here seem to agree with me. I suspect the other half are either the delusional hardcore fans who won't vote anything less than 5 stars or others which will slam on 5 stars because they like a few songs. It's very telling how many of the fans's reviews start which something like &#34;She did it again. She's back!&#34;. You won't see someone neutral or unfamiliar with Stevie Nicks comment like that.  Secret Love: ------------ This song has a very thin melody, too simple and corny really, which basicly just repeats itself throughout the entire song in one form or another. Dave Stewart added a very slimy production to make it radio friendly. Yuck! Sometimes a demo should stay a demo. This is a great example of that. And this is supposed to be a single? Go figure.  For what it's worth: -------------------- A rehash of 'Rose garden' and listen to Annie Lennox's 'Why' if you wonder where you heard the 0:29-0:35 part before. Maybe Dave S. brought that in? This song sounds like it's stuck on repeat, quite annoying.  In your dreams: --------------- Rejected by Tom Petty & The Heartbreakers?  Wide Sargasso Sea: ------------------ Nothing remarkable and way too long  New Orleans: ------------ Annoying and very cliche chorus  Moonlight: ---------- I prefer the demo intro but I like this sweet one also. Unfortunatelly the song is ruined by the new chorus.  Annabel Lee: ------------- This is classic Stevie. Thank god the original version was left largely intact. Love this song. Notice the similarities with &#34;Dreams&#34; in the percussion. The only highlight on this album. That is actually pretty poor is it. :-(  Soldier's angel: ---------------- Might have rehashed elements of 'Desert Angel'? Just compare those songs anyway and be shocked how much richer and interesting 'Desert angel' sounds.  Everybody loves you: -------------------- This song really makes me puke. The chorus is just too cheesy. To make matters worse, two old farts are singing it, at least that's how it sounds like.  Ghosts are gone: ---------------- bad ZZ Top rip-off? It has some really annoying cliche parts and it's way too long.  You may be the one: ------------------- The chorus might actually be the best part but perhaps I should say the least worst part. Did I say something about many songs being too long before?  Italian summer: --------------- Another song which makes me inclined to vomit. I cannot believe Stevie Nicks has lowered herself to these types of songs.  Cheaper than free: ------------------ The title sums it up quite good. Totally forgettable tune and now there's a creepy video of it?? OMFG. :-O  ANOTHER UPDATE (2/25/12) ======================== I just listened to a cd I compiled years ago. This can safely be classified as a collection of her most beautiful songs.  1) Silver Springs (The Dance '97) 2) Sleeping angel 3) Landslide (The Dance '97) 4) Battle of the dragon 5) The tower (demo) 6) Dial the number (with Kenny G) 7) Beauty and the beast 8) Mirror mirror (demo) 9) Rhiannon (The Dance '97) 10) Beautiful child 11) Leather and lace 12) Real tears (B-side 1989) 13) Races are run 14) Storms 15) Has anyone ever written anything for you  I'd add Julia, Prettiest girl in the world, She loves him still, Forest of the black roses, Rock a little, Alice, Love don't fail me now, Sara  I very much respect Stevie for the work she has done in the past, but really cannot respect her for this album. The above songs are all gems. I encourage anyone to listen to her old work before voting on this album. Name one song on IYD which still has something special besides Annabel Lee and a bit of Moonlight. There aren't any others really. The Other side of the Mirror was still special. It's mystical in spades. I love 'Alice' for example. But that's where it ended.  I consider TISL good now (it took me 10 years) but there's nothing special about it. It seems like she fell off a cliff after TISL and Say You Will (still good). For me, with IYD the songs aren't even ok anymore. Almost all of them are bland, rehashed, pathetic or annoying. I sincerely wish it were different. Maybe a new album with Fleetwood Mac might give her a dead cat bounce?  YET ANOTHER UPDATE (12/14/16) ======================== Well, how about that. I've started to like &#34;Secret love&#34;. It's just sweet. Any other songs too? Nope.  Album rating: 1.5 stars
0061122416|1.0|I just finished The Alchemist which tells the story of a shepherd from Andalusia who finds himself on a quest for treasure near the pyramids at Giza. I picked it up at the airport bookstore because I'd heard good things.    It turns out to be extraordinarily heavy-handed. The plot serves only as a chance for the author to espouse his ideas about \\"Personal Legends\\" and following your dreams. The story is dressed in innumerable cliches about love at first sight, women who wait passively while their men go off on adventures, soulmates, and so on.    The author's heavy-handed message for the reader is as dangerous and enticing as that of The Secret: the Universe helps those with the courage to pursue their true purpose in life. The flip side of that idea is that those of us who experience trouble, poverty, and failure in life must have been doing things wrong. This idea strikes me as something only someone born into wealth could believe.    I am also troubled by the idea that we have a single important purpose in life. From my experience, most successful people accomplish many important things in their life. There's no single great quest that is the central narrative of their lives.    This is a weak, uninteresting story told in the service of questionable feel-good ideas that are too simple to reflect reality.

B004K4AUZW|5.0|Let  me start off by saying  I LOVE LADY GAGA. Her first album was awesome the 2nd is epic,and this one just proves how fresh she is.  In my opinion shes THE NEW MADONNA for my generation. All in all amazing album. IM ADDICTED ALREADY!
0061120073|4.0|A Tree Grows in Brooklyn is such a beautiful title as it highlights the tree that continues to grow through the cracks in the concrete despite harsh conditions. It's such a beautiful metaphor for Francie who continues to blossom and even thrive through her difficult childhood with her alcoholic father, severe poverty, and the other harsh realities of her life. The tree continues to grow, despite all efforts to destroy it and is a strong symbol of overcoming adversity. I love that Francie is a reader and that her books help her transcend and escape from the world around her.     Francie's innocence and perseverance was amazing. One would think she was gentle and passive as she would delight in the smallest things such as the beauty of the flowers. Don't let her fool you, though. When it was important, she would stand right up and do what she felt was right. She even found and lied her way into a school that would provide her with a far superior education to the one she was receiving from the school in her neighborhood where the teacher regarded her as worthless because she was poor.     The touching and beautiful tale is a tribute to hope.
B002ZG99IG|1.0|Anyone who thinks this movie was good, had a good story/plot, had good acting, etc., are as stupid as the good roommate (and her idiotic friends).  I rented this with a free promo from redbox, so at least I only wasted a bit of my time watching it.  Utterly pathetic.
0060751967|1.0|I guess I have read too many books with depth in them to like this book.  I was greatly disappointed in it after reading the reviews before buying.  I guess these people have not read such authors' books as Gena Showalter, Jacquelyn Frank, Cynthia Eden, or even Jeaniene Frost.  I mean....it took half of the book before Roman's tooth was put back.  The book really had potential and it started out great.  Any of the authors I mentioned I think could have taken the storyline to a new level, especially with the hero Roman Draganesti.  I have ordered other books by Ms. Sparks due to the reviews.  I hope I have not made a mistake.      However, if you like a light read in which one can put the book down and go about their business until the next spare-time slot, then this is the book for you.  Unfortunately it was not for me.
B004Z2TUGE|5.0|I enjoy watching science fiction movies but find many of them today so caught up with the CGI that the story line is completely lost in translation, as if the story no longer matters today.   I found this movie both entertaining and fun.  It had good character buildup and did all of this with the fun of science fiction.  A true gem amoung todays films.  It was also nice not to have anything I found to be offensive in the movie.    I hope they continue this and build upon the movie with sequals but since I didn't know of this being a major blockbuster I am assuming this is not going to be the case.
B004A8ZWSS|1.0|Absolutely no chemistry between the leads, almost painful to watch them together. Horrible movie and the surprise twist was easy to figure out within the first few minutes.

B004UOE7VA|1.0|Par course for  \\"American\\" electronic music that leads to the likes of Alice DJ via the philosophy of \\"all electronic sounding music is the same, so we'll just cram some random no-name artists together who we can pay minimal royalties to and call it a day!\\", this album is no different. The only song I chose to take along with me on my droid was the Avicii remix of Derezzed. Not sure why this one was marketed so much and the Daft Punk Tron release wasn't, but that one was much better. This is probably the \\"me too!\\" release to get some extra money.    I don't know if this was meant to sound like Daft Punk or not, but whether or not it does is beside the point that these remixes are averagely uninspired.  If you like songs like those on the original Daft Punk Tron release, you're not going to get more like yd.m here. If you want anything electronic worth listening to, you're not going to get that here, either. Stuff like this and Alice DJ are a disgrace to electronic music (I call this stuff \\"cheese techno\\" because it's obvious no time was spent on it) and are why nobody in the states likes it.
0061726826|3.0|Earlier in the week I read Lauren Oliver's debut novel Before I Fall and loved it. So I eagerly downloaded her second book, Delirium, on my Kindle/iPad and set to reading. Ick.<br /><br />She's a very good writer, and the prose style is nearly identical, being first person present from the POV of a 17 year-old girl. For all it's flaws (I'll get to those), the voice is still very good, and makes for compelling reading at first. Oliver's still great at inner monologue.<br /><br />But everything else falls pretty flat.<br /><br />Let's begin with the premise. First of all, it feels like someone told Oliver that \\"dystopian is hot\\" and she jumped on the bandwagon. As far as I can tell, she shows no knack for it whatsoever. And worse, she pushes in this direction at the expense of her considerable talents elsewhere. This version of America exists an ill-defined period in the future, probably around 2050-2075. The central premise of the society is that LOVE has been diagnosed as a disease and the source of all societal ills. But fear not, a cure exists, some kind of magic brain surgery that gets rid of most feeling and desire. Everyone gets this at 18, because conveniently, that's the age \\"the cure\\" works at.<br /><br />Now besides this ludicrous premise, which involves a drastic about face of human tenants consistant since the dawn of time, we have to accept that in 50 years almost no technology has changed. Sure there are a few nasty totalitarian rules and such, but they still use cell phones, they still text. The book has absolutely NO description of anything different other than attitudes. Hell, there was probably more innovation between 1300 and 1350 than shown here! I just completely didn't buy the world. Not one bit. There's no way we could get from here to there. And it's been done to death before. Better. Delirium is like a lame The White Mountains crossed with Uglies. Both books are far better (particularly the first). The whole thing felt entirely forced, like it was all derived from the high concept premise without any other consideration.<br /><br />In Before I Fall, Oliver showed herself adept at painting peer groups. This is hard stuff, and fascinating when done well. But we don't have it here. We have a protagonist, who isn't bad, albiet a little generic, but then we don't have too much else. Next up we have the romantic interest and best friend -- both okay also. But that's it. The other characters are like cardboard cutouts. I find this hard to jive with her first book where even the minor characters are deftly drawn.<br /><br />Also in her first book was an intricate and cleverly woven progression of plot and character, while not perfect, it formed a lovely little puzzle unfolding across the length of the novel. And most importantly, giving a sense of emotional depth.<br /><br />So what happened? I'm forced to conclude that either: 1) she spent much much longer writing her first book and really polished the hell out of it (nothing wrong with that) or 2) that she should have stayed more firmly rooted in the familiar early 21st century as the complexities of world building (even this minimally) sucked her focus.<br /><br />Or both.<br /><br />Still, I do have to give her credit for prose skills. They pulled me enthusiastically through the first third, then groaning and moaning through the rest. If it hadn't been for this I would have chucked it in the middle and you wouldn't have seen the review (I rarely review the many books I give up on -- doesn't seem fair).<br /><br />I'm sad. It could have been so much better. I have nothing against dystopian -- I am after all a hard core sci-fi reader -- I'd have read nearly anything she gave me and enjoyed it if she just provided some reason to care.concept premise without any other consideration.

0385523912|5.0|If you're going to read one book on North Korea, this should be it.<br /><br />It's a compilation of stories of those who have escaped in one way or the other, usually via China.  Writer by an American reporter who did the Korea beat for the LA times for a while, I think.<br /><br />I really wanted to read one book about North Korea and did so, choosing this one.  I was comprehensively satisfied:  I basically get it now.
1151097764|2.0|There are a huge number of typos that are very distracting and frustrating. As stated by other reviewers, multiple words in a row are smushed together and there are random symbols floating around the pages. I recommend going to a used books store or something similar to get the book, because this version is not worth the money.
B004K4AUZW|3.0|The first rule of following up a successful debut is you don't over-stuff the turkey. At 17 tracks I understand Gaga wants to give her fans more bang for the buck, and at .99 cents for the whole album, sans three tracks found here, it might seem that she is being uber-generous to her fans. However, if you read the press, it appears the .99 cents is just one more marketing ploy to get another jewel in the crown--a million copies sold in the first week and a number one album. How cheap and sleazy. Talk about not trying. I remember the days when you had to make a great album with great songs in order to earn that million copies sold. Now you can just sell it for .99 cents like a cheeseburger at McDonalds. This is definitely the sophomore slump curse, barring \\"The Fame Monster\\" which for some strange reason was categorized as an EP rather than a true album. Again, I remember the days when an eight song album clocking in at 34 minutes was considered a legitimate album, not some four or six song EP. Even the, I know Yes made three song albums that were 40 minutes in length, but I digress.<br /><br />As so many others have intuitively pointed out here, \\"Born This Way\\" is over-produced, bland, repetitive, and worst of all, forgettable. Is this the same artist who just gave us \\"Telephone\\" and \\"Bad Romance\\"? Heck, is this the same pop star who gave us \\"Poker Face\\", \\"Just Dance\\" and \\"Paparazzi\\"? None of that is evident here. There are fragments of songs, bits and pieces of good ideas scattered all throughout \\"Born This Way\\", but it never really coalesces. Even at 14 tracks, there are still four tracks too many. This could have been a half way decent ten song album with seven tracks left out for b-sides for those die hard Gaga fans, and sparing the rest of her fans like myself who just want something neat and tidy. Get in, and get out. Less is more.<br /><br />The lyrics are all over the place. Who is Stefani Germanotta? I can't tell from her first three recordings. Comparisons to Madonna abound, but guess what, I am old enough to remember specifically what Madonna did that made her the success she is today. She grew musically from album to album. She did not re-tread and recycle. By her fourth, and arguably her best album, \\"Like A Prayer\\", she had fully matured into a compelling superstar. Germanotta is floundering here due to her absolute love of her fans. You can't do that. Fans are extremely fickle and you can't cater your music and beliefs to them. Look at Alanis Morissette--mega success, then boom! All her fans disappeared, and she did change drastically from album to album. But, she followed her mega success with the over-stuffed and disjointed \\"Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie\\" at 17 tracks and nearly 80 minutes in length. That just might have been responsible for killing her career. It certainly scared off the majority of her fans.<br /><br />Germanotta is 25 and, based on her lyrics here, seems to be pandering to 13 year olds. Why? She could be using her stance on acceptance, equality and being herself/yourself to much greater use. But she just wants to have fun (and that killed Cyndi Lauper's career in the end). In order to last, you have to demonstrate growth as an artist and on a personal level, neither of which Germanotta seems willing to do (yet). Songs about \\"Goverment Hooker\\", \\"Hair\\", \\"Highway Unicorn\\", \\"Heavy Metal Lover\\" and \\"Judas\\" just don't add up to much here. Even \\"Born This Way\\", a celebration of individuality comes off as a stolen riff from Madonna's \\"Express Yourself\\". She can't offer something more original than that?<br /><br />With no less than eight producers, \\"Born This Way\\" is too much. The production is so inflated and generic, it strips the life right out of the album. I suppose if you listened to some songs in isolation they might fool you into thinking that this is a great album, but that's not the way to listen to an album. You have to listen from beginning to end and see how you feel when it's over. I start to get antsy around track five or six, and my mind starts to wander because there's nothing there to anchor it. Someone else said there's nothing here, nothing memorable at all. I wouldn't go that far, but this is average compared to what else Germanotta has given us before.<br /><br />Here's how \\"Born This Way\\" compares to Gaga's other works:<br /><br />2008 The Fame: Three and a Half Stars<br />2009 The Fame Monster: Three Stars<br />2011 Born This Way: Two and a Half Starsack five or six, and my mind starts to wander because there's nothing there to anchor it.

B0051QIGP4|4.0|By fizzling, I mean I've listened to this album too many times and the newness is wearing off so it's not as exciting anymore...but still amazing!     I agree that this album is polarizing based on the love it/hate it reviews here (excluding Amazon complaints). I can basically split Lagy Gaga's (LG) fans into the Fame era and BTW era: one desires bubble-gum and flamboyant pop (Fame) and one craving the energetic and hard variety (BTW). Then there's the fans who like everything by Gaga, though they are few apparently. I put myself into the BTW era because I love the dark and club-inspired vibe that LG exudes. In fact, I don't really like The Fame and only became a LG fan with the Fame Monster.    I love most of the songs on the album because they are dance-heavy, especially Scheisse. They do not need remixes to dance to, which was what I found lacking with previous albums because of the lack of speed and require remixes. The songs I do not really like are Highway Unicorn, Bad Kids, and You and I.    Highway Unicorn: Sorry but I just can't take a song seriously when it references unicorns, and the beats and lyrics aren't that great. With more listens, I like it less.    Bad Kids: reminds me too much of The Fame style, which is the reason for my lack of interest, but it's growing on me!    You and I: Nothing wrong with this song just not my type of music genre (country).    Another observation: low-star reviews claiming that all the songs sound the same are probably from people who download the album based on LG's fame and .99 cent deal and/or not fans of techno. I used to hate techno because I also thought it all sounded the same but now I know better. So, best to disregard these reviews.    I guess this review is more on social observation than actual album review. But if you love club music with heavy beats, you got to get this! Seriously, I dance/feel like dancing everywhere whenever I listen to the album (in my chair, bed, eating, etc.). Thanks for reading!

B004IQMXD4|4.0|After a decade of silence Nicks fans finally have a forum to gush their bias over \\"In Your Dreams\\". The overzealous sect of Nicks worshipers get to weigh in and tip the scale in an overly-rose colored perspective of her new album. I prefer a more objective and tempered approach to discussing Nicks. Firstly, I thoroughly respect Nicks both as a singer and songwriter. \\"Buckingham/Nicks\\" was released in September 1973, before I even turned 1 year old. I have grown up with Fleetwood Mac, Stevie Nicks and Lindsey Buckingham. I listened to each of Nicks' albums in sequential order leading up to \\"In Your Dreams\\" so that all her material is fresh in my mind.<br /><br />The most surprising thing about \\"In Your Dreams\\" is how good Nicks' vocals sound. I mean, she still has 'it'. This is amazing considering how much cocaine has assaulted her throat and how many benzodiazepines have sedated her. Clean and sober sounds great for Nicks. The other thing here is the smart choice in picking Dave Stewart of the Eurythmics to produce, along with Glen Ballard (Alanis Morissette). This significantly paid off in the flow of the album and the strong hooks that are found here. I mean, \\"In Your Dreams\\" is better than 2001's \\"Trouble In Shangri-La\\" which had a whopping eight producers and sounded flat and disjointed.<br /><br />This isn't to say that \\"In Your Dreams\\" is, \\"the best album in Stevie Nicks' career\\". No, but it is the best thing she's done since 1989's \\"The Other Side Of The Mirror\\". On the positive side, most of the songs are fairly memorable and well produced. On the negative side, by track 13 there is a feeling of long-windedness. Like this album is three songs too long. There was nothing wrong with the length of her first three albums, but beginning with \\"The Other Side Of The Mirror\\", Nicks has felt the need to gorge her fans with an hour of music each time out. There's nothing wrong with a ten song, 42 minute set of music. Get in and get out. Less is more.<br /><br />So, I think she could have cut \\"Moonlight (A Vampire's Dream)\\", \\"Annabel Lee\\" and \\"Soldier's Angel\\" and been no worse for wear. These three middle tracks just feel like the slow the momentum set by the first five tracks and the last five. Try it. Cut those three tracks out and listen to the album again and see if you don't agree.<br /><br />The best tracks here are the first single, \\"Secret Love\\", \\"For What It's Worth\\", \\"In Your Dreams\\", \\"Everybody Loves You\\" and \\"Cheaper Than Free\\". These five tracks almost restore Nicks to her former glory. Still, I could not help but feel after listening to \\"In Your Dreams\\" all week long that the album still lacks a compelling hit single, just like \\"Trouble In Shangri-La\\", and even \\"Street Angel\\". When I listened to \\"The Other Side Of The Mirror\\" again with a fresh perspective, I was struck by just how many good songs are on there. Even \\"Rooms On Fire\\" is very sharp. That's what is missing from \\"In Your Dreams\\". There's no hits here, just Nicks comfortably cruising along with some pleasant sounding tracks, tracks that are better than her previous two albums, but not quite the measure of her 1980's solo work.<br /><br />Three and a half stars for an unusually strong effort for 63 year old Nicks. If this is a sign of things to come, let's not wait another ten years please.<br /><br />Here's how \\"In Your Dreams\\" compares to Nicks' previous works:<br /><br />1981 Bella Donna: Four Stars<br />1983 The Wild Heart: Four Stars<br />1985 Rock A Little: Four and a Half Stars<br />1989 The Other Side Of The Mirror: Four and a Half Stars<br />1994 Street Angel: Two and a Half Stars<br />2001 Trouble In Shangri-La: Three Stars<br />2011 In Your Dreams: Three and a Half Stars\\"Moonlight (A Vampire's Dream)\\", \\"Annabel Lee\\" and \\"Soldier's Angel\\" and been no worse for wear.

B0052VUNHC|5.0|Author Jamie McGuire has solidified her spot in my list of favorite authors. Full of suspense and action, romance and drama, Beautiful Disaster had me hooked from the opening sentence. The characters are down to earth, realistic, life-like and easy to identify with. The story is well written, entertaining, witty, and engaging. I fell in love all the characters: Abby, the good girl flirting with her dark side; Travis, the irresistible bad boy that your mother would die of shock if you brought home (my type of guy *swooon*); America, the best friend that every girl needs to have; and Shepley, the boyfriend that every girl wishes she could have. If you are looking for a book that will draw you in and not let you go until the last word is read, Beautiful Disaster is the book for you. A definite must read.

0385732554|5.0|I originally read this book back in middle school, but didn't really remember it.  So, I thought it was high time to read it once more as an adult and teacher.  I enjoyed it just as much as the first time.  I think this was probably the first dystopian book I had ever read, and now I'm hooked and I think I have this book to thank for that.  When reading it for the second time, I did notice some plot holes and some improbable events.  But, it didn't ruin anything for me because I automatically suspended disbelief.  After all, who knows what really is possible in such a future?  Plus, what may be unrealistic to us may not be unrealistic in this world, as the people truly don't know any better.  Really, if you like dystopians, this a classic book you have to read at least once.  If you don't think you like dystopians, this would be a great segue into the genre.  I will fondly look back on this book as one of the first YA dystopians and an excellent story.<br /><br />I listened to the audio book and I absolutely loved the narrator.  He has such an amazing voice that is full of emotion.  He truly brought the book to life.  I also would love to use the audiobook in the classroom because kids could learn a lot about reading aloud from this narrator.

1582701709|5.0|I just finished listening to this on audio book which I recommend rather than reading it.  I would listen to it while driving and it would be put me at complete ease.  As for all the negative reviews, everyone is entitled to their opinions.  Here is what I know for myself~the Secret has absolutely changed my life.  I look at everything through a positive eye and do not allow myself to be pulled into the negativity around me.  When people in my life (family or strangers) have a negative attitude I simply do not let it bother me.   My mind has completely shifted in it's thought process.  My outlook on everything is one of abundance and goodness.  This has changed my relationships with my children, spouse and everyone I come in contact with.  I see people responding to me differently too because I do not have that omnipresent chip on my shoulder anymore.  I think if you open your mind and allow yourself to think outside the box then you will benefit from The Secret as well.  Blessings to all.
1423389387|5.0|Review for The Wise Man's Fear on Audio CD.<br /><br />I listened to The Name of the Wind, and couldn't stop.  It took me a couple CDs to get used to the narrator, but after a while I really grew to like him.  He does a decent job acting out the characters. I think the audio format for this book is excellent, as it is a narrative anyway.  My complaint with The Name of the Wind is the CDs used 99 tracks per CD to help prevent copying of the discs, but this causes issues with some players (slow to load and hard to get back to your track, or if you want to listen to it on your iPod or anything).<br /><br />Thankfully The Wise Man's Fear fixed the CD tracks and went back to having 15 or so tracks per disc.  It has the same great narrator I grew to like in the first book, and the CD's are stored in a nice convenient sleeve case.  Another really nice thing with this audio CD series is the volume is much higher than most audio books.  Many books are too quiet, but this plays at nearly the same volume as most albums.  My only complaint with book 2 is the narrator changed pronunciation on one of the lesser characters, Devi.<br /><br />I won't discuss the content of the story much as it has already been done to an extreme extent in other reviews.  I love the story and the narrative first person perspective.  A nice change of pace from other fantasy.  As an engineer I enjoy a lot of the technical aspects behind the magic.
B000B8GEQU|5.0|While being one of the best movies ever, the audio on VHS, while not of supreme quality, is of far higher quality than the DVD.  Good audio is more essential to video than the video in many cases.  This is one such case.  The VHS adds an air of third dimension to the program.  A true classic.
0061537969|5.0|I liked it enough to give copies to dog-owner friends. Fun to read, and some nice philosophy thrown in.  Slightly odd and uneven at times, but an interesting perspective.
B0051QK87S|5.0|I will start by saying, I love mother monsters new album! No it isn't Fame Monster part 2. Is that what people wanted? She is growing as an artist, so her music must reflect that. The only issue I have is the fact that I preordered this album, and put it in my cd as soon as I got it. WTF?? Bleeps during the songs? Amazon did not notify anyone on this fact,which is a huge disappointment. If I had know it was censored I would not have purchased it. I'm a grown man and i should have the choice of censored or not.    So Gagas new cd is awesome, but amazon... Get it together. You need to give people ALL info on a product that is pertinent. Sooo disappointed in them.
B004PHE9F6|5.0|If you like fast cars and the roaring sound of \\"VAROOOOM!\\" this is the movie for you. Or if you prefer soap opera romances and beautiful clothes, you, too, will like this movie. It opens with a bang on the picturesque streets of Monte Carlo, as the 1966 Grand Prix racers are bolting through town. We meet drivers from America, England, and France (James Garner, Brian Bedford, and Yves Montand) and follow their rivalry through the racing season. We also look behind the scenes at their love lives as they deal with conflicting feelings about racing.<br /><br />This is an exciting and very enjoyable movie. Yves Montand never looked hunkier, even though he plays the oldest racer on the circuit. He's dreamy and so much better than his love interest, Eva Marie Saint, who is drab and dull and totally miscast as a fashionista. Brian Bedford, with his cute babyface and stiff-upper-lip is memorable as a sensitive driver who never quite lived up to his famous brother. His love is well-played by kittenish Jessica Walter as a model with a roaming eye. On the down side, handsome James Garner isn't given much to do and his character is bland and uninspired. Many real Formula 1 drivers have minor parts and several  Grand Prix races were filmed in various countries adding an authentic flavor.<br /><br />The film comes in two discs and the Extras are quite interesting, featuring interviews with director and cast that were filmed in the nineties. We learn that the stars didn't use stunt drivers, but actually drove at high speeds for close-ups. The special effects are impressive, done decades before CGI. Maurice Jarre's soundtrack is lovely (and sounds a lot like his \\"Lawrence of Arabia\\" and even a bit like \\"Dr. Zhivago\\").<br /><br />This is a movie with something for everyone - high speed racing excitement, romance, and quiet, dramatic moments. The acting and direction are excellent. Highly recommended.
0802136834|4.0|I have been watching the HBO Series \\"The Tudors\\" and wanted the real story so I bought this book. Series really doesn't follow the book (which is supposed to be true history). I am enjoying the book (it is huge and heavy) but it is taking forever to read. Lots of interesting info from that era but it does bring in so many characters I get confused at times. But, all in all I'm glad I bought it. It will probably take me a year to read and absorb the information. I bought this book through Amazon and it came immediately.
B003DO13NS|4.0|A very relaxing piece of music with all of Mike Oldfield's genius. It is still rock, simply more mellow. Having enjoyed Oldfield's music for quite a few years, I am surprised that this album had not been played by me yet.    The album is probably not one of Mike Oldfield's most popular, but it is still worth listening to.
031261246X|4.0|I heard about the book on the TWIT podcast Security Now by Steve Gibson and Leo LaPorte.  I went straight to a local bookstore (B&N) and read it over the next 2 days very unusual for me unless I am on vacation.<br /><br />The book reads fast and easy similar to a Clancy thriller with very memorable characters.  Some you care about most you really don't and inevitably when they die off you don't miss them.<br /><br />The real lesson here to me is similar to Richard Clark's message.  Until we all care about computer network security we are all vulnerable to cyber attacks whether terrorism in Zero Day or the common cyber thieves that rob people of their credit card funds to clear or usually not the malware \\"found on your computer\\"!<br /><br />The downside to me at least was the gratuitous sex references tossed in that I could do without and found a bit annoying and wonder if I should let me very Techno Savvy teenage son read it now or not.  I probably will still let him read it.  There were several just dumb typos/mistakes left non corrected that indicate the proofing was lax also a bit distracting.<br /><br />Keep them coming Mark!<br /><br />Warren Tripp<br />Madison, WI
B00007KWHG|5.0|Wow! All the great songs and hits from my generation. The true Jersey Boys live on in this cd. A definate must have!
B000U0F7RG|3.0|It said it was used like new...but it wasn't quite like new. The box was damaged, and after checking each of the 42 dvd's, I found five or six that were scratched. After watching some, I have even found one or two that aren't being recognized in my DVD player. For the most part I guess it's what I paid for, but I am disappointed. If you say it's like new, it should be in that condition for all the pieces.
B00007KWHG|5.0|What a great CD - this will take you back in time.  Every song is a hit and every song still works today.  The Four Seasons have never gone out of style and never will.  Pop this CD into your player and your chores will be done in no time flat.
1565016491|5.0|The video cassettes are in perfect condition. The script stays very close to the original book, the acting is superb. All this together with the colors of the English landscape and the costumes really make the period come alive. A treat from beginning to end.
B002HFP0QU|5.0|The complete collection of all their many hits. Brings back the memories of another time/place in life. Listening to one after another just makes you want to get up and boogie away!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B004G5ZY7E|5.0|I can not say enough good things about this book. It was terrifyingly captivating. I would suggest it to absolutely anyone.
0316069353|5.0|I could not put this down.  My housework never got done till I finished this book.  Mickey Haller is a very likeable character , one that you get attached to.  If you liked \\"Presumed Innocent\\" and \\"The Firm\\", you will like this too, only this is a faster pace.  Can't wait till Connelly writes more with Mickey Haller.
B004K4AVAG|5.0|wow this album rocks!! her best album yet! and i think its the best Album this year with Adele and Britney's album! i love every track on this album.. and i can see any song as a single! just a Masterpiece! and im sure its going to be the Grammy Winner next year!
B001QWBM62|5.0|I use this recorder in-conjunction with the 5d2 or just a separate audio recorder. It can take some serious sound damage, more specially from live stages and still be able to capture good audio out of it. See for yourself : ---[...]<br /><br />The thing just works, works very well even for interviews and documentary style stuff,<br /><br />thanks.
B0036S4C6G|1.0|I can not understand how this book got such great reviews. I am not picky when it comes to books but i would not recommend this to anyone. About 25% into it I wanted to stop reading it but decided to stick it out and give it a chance. Unfortunately, it had no redeeming qualities.<br />All of the characters are depressing and (at least on a kindle) the plotline is very hard to follow. Toward the end of the book the texting is very hard to read Bcuz its typd lyk ths.
B003UD7JEE|5.0|Nikita needs another person reviewing, like it needs another plot twist. Everyone else has said what needs saying. Watch the damn show! Yes, it is that good.
B0041KKYBA|5.0|After viewing this film it was very clear to me why people are clammoring that the banksters go to jail. The topic is rather complex but explained in a way even I could understand! It would seem that a crime of such imense proportions which took half my 86 year old mom's savings from her should be taught in high school/college classrooms. There is also a pleading to contact your congressmen and insist laws that Congress trashed be reinstated that prevented this destruction of retirement savings. ( I felt the topic important enough to comply. I called them all) I wish to put this on the \\" all US citizens must view list\\".
B00013M6NK|2.0|I was initially disappointed when the Nikon EN-EL5 Rechargeable Li-ion Batteries I ordered didn't charge fully the first time.  I did some research, and found out that when first charging, the batteries can overheat (meaning they have to be plugged in again and again), and this problem should not reoccur once they've gone through a charge/discharge cycle.  We'll see.
B004TJ1H3C|4.0|The first season of this show was truly fantastic.  Unfortunately, the first 5 episodes of this season were pretty slow.  As is the case for cable shows, if it starts slow, it loses people, and the decision to kill it comes quick.  Really too bad as this ended up being fantastic.  The ending isn't great as it is obvious they expected another season.  I'd have loved that as well.  But if you have the first season, you need this one.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|The first sharpener I got, which was more expensive than this one, I not only wanted to sharpen knives, but also my scissors. After I tried it on my scissors it nearly ruined them. I later learned that you can't use the really basic model for sharpening scissors. The Smith's PP1 Pocket Pal has not disappointed at all. I was able to use the tapered diamond rod to sharpen 3 pairs of scissors! I'm glad I didn't throw them away, because they now cut just like new! I really like the fact that the carbide slot and the ceramic slot have a little label next to the slots, so someone like me doesn't use the wrong side. This is lightweight, pocket size, and a very handy tool to sharpen almost anything you need to sharpen. I'm going to use this next to sharpen my wood saw. I'd buy this product again in a heartbeat!
B004G606K8|4.0|It starts out a little slow but the entire trilogy is really worth while and despite lacking anything incredible, the whole adventure was really fun.
006145205X|4.0|Maybe I should have read more reviews before getting this book.  I think the basic concept is still good.  The writing, when it uses anecdotes, is engaging.  But it can be infuriating to read the examples cited from history that are wrong or at best misleadingly simplified.  I think what made me put the book down for a while was how the author wanted so much to credit the Philistines with the first use of iron that he described the Hittites and dismissed them in a sentence.  (The Hittites are generally credited with the first widespread use of iron, not the Philistines.)  Still, this book is a good one.  I'd recommend it.  It's a head-shaker in the way it rewrites historical facts and timelines, though.
0307887960|2.0|I realize the good doctor has implemented this method for many years, but in reading the book I came away with a program that is distinctly South Beach in style, with the added fad of an oat pancake eaten daily.    Mmmmm.    Overall this diet - like most - is faddish and odd.  It simply doesn't line up with real life.  If you're looking to accomplish lasting weight loss, you must make lasting change.      Not recommended.
6304099355|3.0|529 aphorisms may survive a play but not a serious movie...uh, excuse me, film.<br /><br />Very strong performances by Pacino and Aiellon and Cusack; lukewarm, one-dimensional job by Bridget Fonda - not even good enough for a bad sitcom. I'll have to watch some more of her works to see if that good family gravy rubbed off on her blouse. (No sexism intended).<br /><br />Script needed a paring down and the movie itself needed about nine minutes to be cut.<br /><br />Pacino's mayor seems to be a hybrid of Edward Koch and Mario Cuomo, Koch's ethnicity to the fore. Just like Al overdid the Hispanic \\"accent\\" in [what's the name, I'll look it up], his Jewish voice is not to be believed. I guess he watched \\"Independence Day\\" one two many times, and replayed Judd Hirsh's part two too many times. But this dude can act and some nearly laugh-provoking passages are overcome by his expressiveness.<br /><br />Fun to watch \\"real life\\" Politicians take parts here and not all in \\"Political\\" roles.<br /><br />Nice location shooting.<br /><br />[Year of release of this edition not seen].
0060920084|1.0|I read A Walk in the Woods, and though it had a slow section in the middle I thoroughly enjoyed it.  So therefore for my birthday I asked for and received the Lost Continent.  What a mistake that was.  I read it until he was in North Carolina.  That was about 5 states too far!  I literally threw it at the wall after I read yet another condescending slam on some poor American slob just like me.  What an ignorant idiot this guy is (or was back then).  He should have stayed in England if America sucks so bad.  I buy books to read and keep.  This is absolutely the first, and hopefully the last that I ever threw away, and then made sure I dumped coffee grounds on it in the trash the next morning.  Take that Bryson.  Stay in England!
0307595862|3.0|Simplistic writing style. It reads like Nesbo popped a couple of adderall and went to town writing lol. All and all not to bad. The ending wasn't as surprising as I thought it would be or should be. The plot kinda seems like its all over the place and eventually by the end, if you have been paying attention to the context clues you can guess \\"who done it.\\" Not a waste of $15 but I would probably think twice before I picked up another Nesbo novel.
0307272702|5.0|The best book about weight loss I've read, no doubt. Even though based on innumerable research reports over the last century, it is easy & fun to read -- fun because it enlightens. You begin to see the big picture. And it confirms my own experiences over the years, with dieting & exercise for weight-loss ...
B0051QIGP4|1.0|I wasn't sure if I was going to purchase this album based on the singles I've heard on the radio, but when Amazon had it on sale for $.99 I figured, why not?...Then I listened to it and figured out why it was on sale for $.99 on it's release date.    Nearly every track on Born this Way makes the weakest tracks on the Fame Monster look like masterpieces. There's nothing that even comes close to Just Dance, Pokerface, Bad Romance, Telephone...etc.     The Best Tracks (Best not to be confused with all that good):  \\"Born this Way\\" - Catchy, although it's a pretty blatent rip-off of 1980's Madonna.  \\"Heavy Metal Lover\\"  \\"Electric Chapel\\"    The Average Tracks:  \\"Judas\\" - this reminds me of a crappy remake of \\"Bad Romance\\"...without the lyrical ingenuity of the original.    The Boring Tracks:  \\"Marry the Night\\"   \\"Hair\\"   \\"Bad Kids\\" - What's with the weird 80's throwback vibe anyhow?  \\"Highway Unicorn\\"  \\"You and I\\"  \\"Edge of Glory\\"    The Seriously? Tracks:  \\"Government Hooker\\" - I hope this is the worst song of her career because I'm not sure I could take any worse.  \\"Americano\\" - Is this supposed to sound Latin? Italian? Cause all I hear is stupid.  \\"ScheiBe\\" - The English part is almost catchy. The German rapping(?) makes my ears bleed.  \\"Bloody Mary\\" - It was a tough choice between Boring or Seriously?...it qualifies as both.      We get it Gaga - you're all into self-empowerment and the 1980's on this record. The problem is you aren't particularly good at writing songs in those themes.     Overall verdict: If you spent $1.99 or less on this album, you're probably not too disappointed. You probably have that much change in your sofa afterall. I would NOT recommend spending any more - it's called buyers remorse for a reason!
B004VMUS9G|3.0|This would be fantastic except for the fact that it won't allow you to move the app to the sd card. Change that, and this program is a solid 5 stars.
1597801585|4.0|Paolo Bacigalupi's The Wind-Up Girl has a lot going for it: good writing, interesting characters, a sense of place, and new ideas.  I enjoyed Bacigalupi's depiction of a future post-global warming, post-petroleum, post-pestilence Thailand where Monsanto-like international corporations can decide the balance of power.  His understanding of Thai Buddhism is quiet good -- better than John Burdett's (and I like John Burdett).  I enjoyed his depiction of the clash of cultures (Farang, Chinese, Thai, and Japanese) and his depiction of political dynamics in his dystopian world.  He also has thoughtful things to say about ecology and evolution.  Best of all, it's a good read -- I found it hard to put down.  My only complaint is that the ending, while satisfying in some ways, also seemed a bit  random -- the book could have ended in an infinite number of ways depending on how certain details worked out.  I suppose that's how life actually is -- the way things work out is somewhat random and contingent.  I enjoy fiction more, however, when the ending feels inevitable -- the only satisfying conclusion to the novel.  Nevertheless, I highly recommend \\"The Wind-up Girl.\\"  Bacigalupi us right up there with my favorite SF authors - Vernor Vinge and Neal Stephenson.
0143038419|1.0|This book has been so often-recommended to me that I thought I should buy it for my latest-generation Kindle. I will not finish it. I was very bored: She is so \\"more sensitive than thou\\" (\\"I honor the sensitivity that resides in me, but not in you\\". And all that weeping on bathroom floors? Maybe she overcame that, but what about those bathroom cooties?

Nov 11,2011...Ijust purchased part 2 of this movie at Walmart  for $19.96+tax.As with the Part 1 disc,Wal Mart has exclusive distribution rights.

159420229X|3.0|Since reading 'The Memory Palace of Mattheo Ricci' I have been interested in this way of memorizing things. I picked up this book not as a guide to memnonincs but rather I wanted to have an entertaining romp through the art of memorizing.  This Foer definitely delivers. Therefore why do I only rank a 3 out of 5?  First, because Foer writes so much in the self agrandizing style which I know so well from my friends who do or did science in Ivy league school. Everything always had to be the best, the weirdest, the craziest. People do not become intoxicated, they become homerically drunk. It is not a rowdy party but 'the rwodiest party ever seen in......' Everything always has to be a superlative.  This can be nice, as it is a way of seeing the unusual even in ordinary events and people. But it tends to get out of hand. Thus these memnonists Foer describes maybe nice, interesting etc. people, but are they really 'the wild bunch'? Or just geeks gone wild?  Foer also shies away from calling a spade a spade or a fraud a fraud, which sits ill with his journalist credentials.  Yet finally where he disappoints is with his statements regarding the practical applicability of these memnonic techniques. After explaining how for many thousands of years Memnonics was a core of western learning he in the end basically says that it is useless and impractical. This surprises. Were all others before him stupid?  Did Matteo Ricci use his memory palace in vain for learning Chinese?
B004RC8NUQ|2.0|If you are a high school boy you might like this moive.  Other than that it's a played out plot line that just makes adolescents think having sex means nothing.  The movie takes about 45 minutes to even get into anything of substance.
073935650X|4.0|Gifted Teen Commits Suicide, Tortures Peers From Beyond The Grave.   That's the headline, and that's the premise of Jay Asher's novel, Thirteen Reasons Why.  Hannah Baker kills herself, but creates a set of audiotapes beforehand detailing how thirteen different people contributed to her death.  Then she blackmails the people on the tapes into sending the set along to the rest of the incriminated group by duplicating the set and leaving it with an anonymous \\"watcher\\" tasked with ensuring all Hannah's intended listeners indeed pass the tapes along.  If the chain breaks, the watcher will release the tapes to the public.    A rather creepy premise indeed, but one that holds a distinct appeal to teens.  It plays on the misapprehensions and emotional confusion so prominent in teenage life, and this novel realistically and grippingly explores the cruelties that some teens deal out to each other on a regular basis, serving as a clear cautionary tale for those who trade on rumor-mongering and bullying.  Its heroine, Hannah, is reasonably self-aware and understands her own participation in her demise, though she feels powerless to control her emotions or to stop her downward spiral into depression, isolation, and death.    Despite the harrowing subject matter, I found this to be a worthwhile listening experience, both in substance and in form.  The story here is tautly woven and uncomfortably addictive.  And this audio performance features two engaging actors (Debra Wiseman and Joel Johnstone), perfectly cast as the dual protagonists Hannah herself and Clay, the entirely decent young man who's listening to the tapes and waiting for the moment when she reveals what he has done to deserve inclusion on her list.    If you're going to try Thirteen Reasons Why - and if you're a parent, friend, or mentor of young teens, I suggest you do - the audio version is well worth your time.      But do be prepared:  This is a trying experience, even though it's quite well paced and well donein every respect.  Even if we're not on the list, we feel the same horror, frustration, and powerlessness that Hannah's listeners do, all thirteen steps of the way.
B004FOA84A|5.0|i really liked this game. i didn't think it was too short, especially for a game on my phone. look forward to sequel.
B004Z2TUGE|2.0|I am not great movie at all. Lets just say this is a horrible high school drama crap movie with a 30 min action scene. Not the greatest movie to spend 3.99 on. I just did not enjoy this movie. I have to say that the special effects look nice other than that its not that great. Its a waste of time even to read or write a review for this movie. I am writing this review for the people out there. This movie is like a huge mix of Twilight and any super hero movies which did not come out that great. The squeal might be better than this since the book seemed a lot more interesting than the movie.
B0041KKYBA|5.0|I've read some other reviews, and I still want to get in my 5-Stars. I was ignorant to so much, as were, I'm sure, many others, so when the bomb dropped, I wanted answers. Charles Ferguson's film is the first important film to attempt to lay out, in reasonably understandable terms, what went wrong. I'm glad I saw it. I don't trust government either, but the problem was deeper than that at its beginning. What's at stake here is the trust we simple, hard-working Americans can place on any institution: Banking, government politicians, higher education \\"advisors\\" ...all getting rich, while I pay taxes to support low-lifes, barely getting by on my own. What's happened to our country...and our Constitution?
B0051QJ83S|1.0|I bought this for 99 cents and I'm glad I didn't pay a penny more.     This is a rehash of just about every dancey, techno-pop song I heard in the 80s and 90s. Lady Gaga might seem original and genius to people who weren't around back then but take it from an old Gen X'er, she's not.
B004K4AUZW|5.0|I am in love with this album!!! It has a little bit of everything and gives what her fans want. Gaga is the one artist to stand on top of them all for originality and true lyrics that pump out the best album I have heard from any pop artist. She is just more than an amazing voice with pulse pounding beats. Gaga is a true inspiration to us all and her music from this album and her other albums prove she is not scared of all those haters! No one can tear her down! This album is another reason that proves her longevity and  heart that goes into her music. Long Live Lady Gaga!!! WE love you so much!!! Keep it up!!! My Favorite Tracks include Marry the Night, Born This Way, Government Hooker, Judas, Hair, Bad Kids, Heavy Metal Lover, You and I, The Edge of Glory.
B004H8GLXQ|4.0|This is a very well written book. It is a haunting tale and it keeps you guessing much of the time. It is full of surprises and there were times when I found myself holding my breath. I read it pretty quickly, which is always an indicator of just how good a book is.     While it isn't one of those books that I will read a multitude of times, it was certainly well worth reading and I enjoyed being captivated by it while it lasted. I readily recommend it.
B00300013I|5.0|I bought this game for my children in Europe when they were the age recommended 4-8. They are now 9 and 12 and we still play.  I wanted to check Amazon if they had the game to order for a girlfriend who has twins of 4 years old. Made my day to find it here.
0811875555|5.0|Some art books skimp on the details and just give a few sketches. This book, however, it chock full of high quality paintings, sketches, drawings, and storyboards for Disney's Tangled. The subjects in this book range from concept art (extremely detailed and by famous animator Glen Keane of Little Mermaid fame, as well as many other skilled artists), extremely in-depth details of the tower in which Rapunzel grows up, and text explaining the influences of the animators and design artists on the piece and their process working on Rapunzel.<br /><br />A very good book - and definitely great to read if you like to peek behind the curtain on one of Disney's latest masterpieces.
B004498KPU|5.0|I know I'm gonna get ridiculed from my buddies for this, but I HAD sit down & write something about this musical genius wrapped up in a frail human body.  You may not like the man, but if you enjoyed music video during the 80's \\"Thriller\\" & \\"Bad\\" were the ULTIMATE albums.  I bought this DVD set just to see the video for \\"Ghost\\", but have yet to make it that far.  I don't remember seeing some of these long-form videos upon first release except for \\"Thriller\\" & \\"Black or White\\".  Just watching these videos or \\"short-films\\", brings me back to days when I enjoyed listening to these perfect albums (or cassettes, in those days).  If you grew up during the 80's & a music or video fan, then you HAVE to get this collection.

B000AYEL6U|5.0|Who can add to over 500 reviews? I can only say I added this DVD to another purchase (which was Pride & Prejudice 2005) because it kept popping up--period drama, BBC...reviews kept saying it wasn't about the Civil War. I could not figure out how North & South BBC could have 5 stars in the majority of the reviews. I mean really!  Didn't watch it for 2 months. Then one night at 10:00 pm I dropped it in the dvd player.  I had no idea it was 4 hours long! Thought I would watch about an hour and a half and watch the rest the next night or when I had time.    The first 20 minutes or so I'm thinking why is this so great.  Then, It happened. I was hooked and 3-1/2 hours later, and several rewatches of key scenes I had to tear myself away from the tv to go to bed.      I can't tell you how many times I've watched N&S.  The story draws you in. It is better not to watch clips on the internet, rather get the whole effect, like I did, from beginning to end. At the first viewing I had reservations about some parts and interpretations and it took two or three times watching the full dvd to absorb and think about the story line.  North & South is not just a love story, it has depth, complications, social tension, winding several stories around life during the industrial revolution in the mid 1800s in England. There is so much that goes on in the 4 hours of viewing that one needed the end for closure.  It blew P&P (all of them) out of the water!  To me it is that good and one of my favs.
B004Z2TUGE|3.0|This was a fun movie with a lot of action. I am not a huge sci-fi fan but this was an enjoyable movie for me. The pace is quick and you'll love the dog.
B002ZG99QS|5.0|I didn't have high hopes for this movie when I first heard of it, thinking it would be just another over-done theme with too much action, tasteless \\"romance,\\" and a worthlessly laughable villain.<br /><br />I was very wrong.<br /><br />This movie not only made me want to watch the original, but I bought the DVD after renting it once. The actors in it were sublime (as if having actors from TRON wasn't good enough, there's a Cillian cameo that I LOVED, being a huge fan of his work), and the set-up for it was surprisingly well done. The plot was easy to follow, but not completely predictable, and the ending was satisfying enough to not make me nervous but cut just right that I wouldn't shun the idea of a third movie in this series. The soundtrack was amazing, and kept me engaged. There was enough action to appease my dad, but not so much as to put me off. There was a hint of romance in it, but it was subtle and innocent. The progression of the movie is believable, and I love Sam because he looks/acts like one of the my book characters! Comedy was well-placed, and the dialogue for Kevin Flynn was especially amusing.<br /><br />The protagonist was believable, and the antagonist surprisingly understandable while still being exceptionally evil. As a writer, this was an extreme plus for me -- also, I have been royally disappointed by most protagonists and antagonists that Disney has given us in recent years. It felt very deep to me, not having the one-dimensional feel that most movies have. It felt like things were happening that we couldn't see, like the Grid was a complete world and not just a setting for a guaranteed victory -- or a victory at all, necessarily.<br /><br />The effects of this movie were amazing. The light cycles and suits in it make me very jealous of the people working on this film! All of it hints to a hidden depth that makes me want to watch it until I understand more. ;)<br /><br />Watched this with a bunch of kids between the ages of 8-13 -- as well as a few adults -- just the other night and every one of them absolutely loved it. As I've said before, my father also enjoyed it, and he tends to only be interested in war films such as Kingdom of Heaven or epic fantasies like Lord of the Rings. We'll definitely be recommending this movie to others. :Dand every one of them absolutely loved it.

B001HN6918|5.0|Movie studios nowadays seem to cash in on movie sequels; if the first one is a success, than there is a sequel in the works. Dreamworks COULD of made a poor sequel, and people would of seen it. Fortunately, Kung Fu Panda 2 is one of those RARE sequels that actually is BETTER than the original.     The second film starts out with Po (Jack Black), he is now the Dragon Warrior, along with the Furious Five; Tigress (Angelina Jolie), Monkey (Jackie Chan), Mantis (Seth Rogen), Viper (Lucy Liu), Crane (David Cross), and Master Shifu (Dustin Hoffman) are reprising their voices to these characters. Now, they have to go against a new villain named Lorn Shen (Gary Oldman) who is going into the villages and taking anything metal with him and his goons.     Yet, there is something interesting about Lord Shen that Po see's; it's a symbol that Po has seen before, but he is not quite sure of what it means, but Po thinks it has something to do with his parents. After some asking from his dad Mr. Ping (James Hong), he tells Po what happened.     As the story progresses, it turns out that Lorn Shen has a weapon, and has evil plans for this weapon, so now it's Po and the Furious Five's job to stop Lorn Shen.     This film is aimed at kids, but adults can enjoy it too; I went to go see this with my fiancée opening night, and not only did she love it, but I loved it too. The writing is excellent, the animation is a mix of 3D and hand-drawn animation (a couple of scenes here and there are hand-drawn, and even they look excellent), it's funny when it needs to be funny, it's touching when it needs to be touching, and overall, this is a good film. Dreamworks put a lot of time into the animation and writing, and definitely a lot of time in character development, they definitely have a winner with this one. If you have kids, or an adult that LOVES animation films, go see this.
B004EPZ06Q|3.0|The Hangover 2 is almost an exact copy of the first film, with a new location and a slightly higher shock value of course. The boys are headed to Stu's wedding in Bangkok, but of course they get drugged again, wake up with all sorts of problems, and have to solve the puzzle of what happened.<br /><br />There is nothing really wrong with this movie other than the fact that we've see it before. You can tell they went with the \\"if it ain't broke, don't fix it\\" approach. The main difference I noticed was the much darker vibe and it's less fun because of it.<br /><br />Still, the cast is good all around, with Zach Galifianakis still providing most of the laughs with his weird humor, and there are more than a few moments that had my whole theater cracking up really loud. I know it's going to make a ton of money (I just saw it has already made over $60 million in two days) and I do recommend it if you liked the original, but I don't think we need a third Hangover.
B004469BQA|5.0|It's not hard to predict that the release of another album by a veteran guitar virtuoso will be heralded by critics and fans as an instant classic.  But with time, even great performances sound a little tinny and dated.  I'd be willing to bet this one doesn't go that route.  There is some overlap with previous albums; you can hear familiar echoes of Flying in a Blue Dream and the Extremist throughout, but there is something much more here: From the first track there's a driving groove that grabs and holds your attention.  More like a good jazz backbeat overlaid with bluesy electric keys, and set off with melodic and then growling guitars.  Simply put, it's a very tight, complex production.  When I got my first Satch album in the Mid Eighties, we were going through the long-haired shredder metal phase.  It was our generation's bell bottom craze: cool and innocent while it lasted but we're a little sheepish looking back 20 years later.  Surfing with the Alien set itself apart from all the noise; it was great, because it showed Satriani's command of the guitar and his complete, if sometimes brash, versatility.  The albums I mentioned above followed soon after and were both equally good.  This album is the grown up version: with mellower tastes, richer layers, and less foot on the gas rocketing down the highway fret shredding.  It's more subtle and every bit as memorable.  Buy it, listen to it; savor it.  This may well be an unsurpassable achievement.
B000AM2L1O|5.0|I got this doll for my daughter for her one year birthday. I read all of the reviews saying how great Calin was, but I wasn't quite sure if my dd would really play with her. My daughter loves this doll! She carries Calin with her everywhere she goes. It is the perfect size and weight for a one year old. It is a high quality doll, too.
B004SBX112|1.0|I love Angry Birds but this last update is lame.  It has invasive ads in pay version.  And I just got a rad score with one bird left but it glitched up.  Two blue birds got stuck on bouncy thing and it slowly moved across screen.  Even after hitting wall, the game would not let it end.  Now I have to give up my high score and possibly 3 stars to get unstuck.  Lame, lame, lame.    UPDATE:  Seasons just got worse.  My phone (Defy) does not handle WiFi very well but the new update requires it.  Now it just crashing on level 4.  Worst version of Angry Birds ever.  And just to rub salt int he wounds, I actually paid for this version.    Do not waste your money on Seasons.
0307454541|4.0|At almost 600 pages, it must retain a grip on the reader. It does. It's about a family; not dysfunctional but deranged, some of which, over decades, has descended to the depths of criminal, sexual depravity. On top of this is another story, about the shenanigans in high commerce, stock exchange dealings and the role of investigative journalism. The two central characters unfold in different ways; their eventual coming together being a key to the investigative process. The writing is lucid, with phrasing at times, based squarely on British English colloquialism. For a Swedish author, this is almost triumphant in itself. Even here, love emerges from a surprising source. I now start reading his second book!  Ian Hunter.

B002EAKWEI|5.0|I don't think anyone considering a purchase of this set needs a review of the series material. It is the definitive Holmes.<br /><br />If you have the ability to play Region 2 DVDs on a universal DVD player or with a software solution on computer, buying this is a no-brainer. It is much less expensive to get than the USA Region 1 version, and the image quality and subtitles (which were subject to  major screw-ups on the first USA release) are excellent. I had previously seen the series on murky videotapes. Then I checked out the USA DVD release from the library and found the image quality was not much better than the videotapes. There is now a \\"remastered\\" USA/Region 1 set, but as I said, much more expensive.<br /><br />I was impressed with the image quality of this Region 2 set, actually. Good sharpness, color, and contrast. Given the source film, this is probably about the best you will see for DVD home video from a 16mm film source.
B002VKB0M4|4.0|Life has a way of dealing us random cards at times ~ some are good cards, some are not so good cards. Paris is a movie which captures a dealt hand at a particular moment in time and what people do with their hands. The character with the most to loose, is in fact the most happiest and it is through his dispair that he sees how truly amazing life really is. All around him, are unhappy Parisian's and yet they don't know how lucky they are. As each of them moves through their moment, life has a way of working itself out. No-one is immune to happiness just as no-one is immune to pain. It is how we deal with these humanistic traits is how we measure our own success. Paris is a beautiful city and I can't think of a better location to shoot such a gem.
B0036EH3WK|5.0|The product is just amazing. The ship was done right on time. Just beware that the season 3 and 4 are zoned on zone 1 !!!
B004JZBGWI|3.0|Good memo program with nice features like list thats great for shopping but beware of the updates! They don't save your memos. Ran an update, one of 7 other programs. Got to this one, didn't pay attention &amp; missed this was the only update that didn't say data would be saved. My bad but lost a lot of info. Boo. Stupid not to save memo program data, poor programming techniques.
B004U8VWLE|1.0|This is another case of Hollywood trying to force garbage as art on the public.  I can think for myself, thank you very much.  Details: not worth my time or yours.  BS...the acronym says it all.
B002G1YPH0|5.0|Superb cooler that is quite and efficient.  Although installation requires a motherboard with a CPU cut-out or you have to remove the motherboard to install the back plate, the extra installation effort is well worth the additional quality, stability, cooling efficiency, and quite operation realized.  Quieter than the stock Intel i7-950 processor cooler and keeps the CPU cooler in all situations.
B004M66YSA|4.0|As pure as the first two Girls albums and owing as much to the Jesus and Mary Chain, though less moody, and that's were the popness comes in. Maybe a bit anachronistic and lost in the late 80's or early 90's sound that also longed for Phil Spector's Wall of Sound. Drums were never so simple; feedback pop was never so enjoyable.
0345529057|4.0|The reason I purchased this set of books is because I am loving the tv series on HBO. You know what they say, \\"the book is always better than the movie\\". I probably would enjoy the books except I do wear glasses and even with them I am having a problem seeing the words because they are so small. I am sure the books are great but with such  small print and over 1000 pages in them I am having a problem seeing the words. I'm sure someone with good vision would love this set of books and it was a great price. I am going to get a magnifier but thats just something else to slow down what is going to be an already long process. So I am not one who can give a fair review on the content of the book other than if it's half as good as the tv show then anyone would love it.
B004K4AUZW|5.0|A Kid's Review:    So after Gaga's successful debut studio album 'The Fame' and her 8-track EP 'The Fame Monster', we have her newest effort 'Born This Way'. I have to say, I loved all the songs, it takes a few listens to familiarize with all of the 17 new songs + the 5 Remixes, making 22 tracks to familiarize with. I finally got the opportunity to review the new songs, here it goes:    Disc 1:    1- MARRY THE NIGHT - This is a nice opening track, with a nice beat that you will for sure enjoy. 10/10  2- BORN THIS WAY - This is the first single on the record, and of course the one that most identifies it, with this nice anthem that makes people love themselves and who they are because they were born this way. 10/10  3- GOVERNMENT HOOKER - The start for this song is really weird, but it's also very funny and the chorus has good beats. 9.5/10  4- JUDAS - Second single on the record, when you love someone again and again even if they keep on making mistakes. 10/10  5- AMERICANO - Very nice song, loving the Spanish lyrics. Not the best though. 8/10  6- HAIR - This is the promotional single for the countdown to Born This Way. A nice song, loving the sax. 10/10  7- SCHEIBE - Love the German lyrics, I just love Gaga singing in German. The music is also amazing. 10/10  8- BLOODY MARY - This is my favorite song for sure, the chorus is beautiful, the best slow song on the record. 10/10  9- BLACK JESUS AMEN FASHION - Kind of forgettable for me. 7.5/10  10- BAD KIDS - 9/10  11- FASHION OF HIS LOVE - Gaga sings about someone she's sure she was made to love. Cute. 10/10  12- HIGHWAY UNICORN (ROAD TO LOVE) - I was expecting something more epic to come out from that title, but still 8.5/10  13- HEAVY METAL LOVER - The chorus is addictive. 10/10  14- ELECTRIC CHAPEL - Very sweet. 9.5/10  15- THE QUEEN - 10/10  16- YOU AND I - I really love this song, a sweet slow song near the end of the record. 10/10  17- THE EDGE OF GLORY - The best closing to the record, about the last moment on Earth. This was the perfect third single, can't wait for the music video. 10/10    Disc 2:    1- BORN THIS WAY (COUNTRY ROAD VERSION) - I like this version, but it doesn't beat the original. 9/10  2- JUDAS (DJ WHITE SHADOW REMIX) - This is ok. 8.5/10  3- MARRY THE NIGHT (FERNANDO GARIBAY REMIX) - Amazing remix to this amazing song. 10/10  4- SCHEIBE (DJ WHITE SHADOW MUGLER) - Way too long. 6/10 (I could have given it 7/10 if it wasn't so long)  5- FASHION OF HIS LOVE (FERNANDO GARIBAY REMIX) - Another incredible Fernando Garibay remix. 10/10    So, that's pretty much it. Mother Monster's new album doesn't fail, it may have some forgettable songs but it still gets 5/5 or 10/10 in my average rating.
B0034G4ORC|5.0|One words....Epic.  Getting a weekend off and watching movies ranging from Red and even the King Speech.  This was far the best I have seen in a long time, hell this movie even beats out Thor.  If you are in the military no matter what branch, this is a must.  There are underlying themes of duty, honor, sacrifice,courage,commitment,dedication.  You don't have to be in the military to enjoy this movie, it has fine character decvelopment in which you the viewer will learn and feel.  Overall, this movie is Epic.
B0051QIGP4|5.0|I love Lady gaga's born this way album! 99 cents for the whole album is such a great deal! my faves are boody mary, edge of glory, electric chapel and you & i. I love Lady gaga.

B002Q1YDLI|5.0|This is the best one of the series! I found this book first years ago then got Something Borrowed after. The story pulls you in and you learn to love Darcy, spoiled silly girl that she is. I swoon at the thought of sweet sweet Ethan. Truly a cast of characters you could love & a must read :)
B000BWI9U0|5.0|I remember being so disappointed when this album was first released.  It just didn't sound like I expected.  Now, a half decade after the fact, it is the one Strokes album I continually return to.  Their first album might be artistic perfection, but once you've absorbed that album, there's not much new to the experience other than to have it all over again.  This album is far more varied and different songs tend to stand out at different times.  It simply has much more to give over time, even it it is somewhat less successful as a work of art.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I've had the Kindle app on my EVO phone since last November, about ten minutes after I got the phone. The app works smoothly, and I've had no problems with it at all. I enjoy having some books with me on my phone; it's surprising how often I read something using the Kindle app on my phone when I'm waiting for an appointment somewhere. I still carry and use my Kindle 3, but this app has turned my phone into a very handy supplement to the Kindle. Syncing to the \\"furthest location read\\" between and among my Kindle-equipped devices has always been easy and accurate.
B002ZG99IG|2.0|This movie did not impress me at all, if you ask me, I would tell you that Single White Female was better in that it had key stars in it, this movie was alright, so what is going on with this girl?  There is no real premiss for her being strange.  I am trying to get into the movie, but it doesn't take me there, it drags, it's so similar to the Single White Female in that there is the issue with the cat, (SWF had a puppy), fixated on the room mate (same in this movie, with wearing the other girls clothes), being jealous of the boyfriend, well I think you get the picture, if you want to see the movie, you are better off renting it, or viewing it from your IPAD or computer, I am glad that I didn't waste money buying this when it first came out.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I held off on reading The Hunger Games, even at my friends' urging to read it.  No one ever told me the premise of the book, and the name just turned me off for some reason.<br /><br />However, one day I found it at the library and decided to just pick it up in case I did not like the book I had come in search of.  I wanted to read Graceling, and at the time there was no Kindle edition of it available.  It makes me very sad when there is no Kindle edition of a book, or when the Kindle copy is more expensive than even the hardback; however, that is neither here nor there.  In this case, my trip to the local library was not fruitless.<br /><br />After even the first chapter, I was hooked.  I was absolutely enthralled by the plot, the premise, and the characters.  The story does a good job of being both simple enough for a young adult reader, and complex and fulfilling enough for an adult reader.  Along with the Harry Potter series, I think this series in one of the few that can honestly walk the line between teen and adult readers, and satisfy both.<br /><br />I loved Katniss' character.  She could be difficult and infuriating at times, but such is the way in a dystopian future where your government officials are trying to kill you.  The only people you can care about fully are your family because you cannot realistically protect more than that.  All other feelings for other people have to be quelled.<br /><br />This book is definitely one I'd recommend to anyone over the age of, say 13.  As long as you aren't bothered by gruesome displays and descriptions of death and violence.  Although, to be fair, this book doesn't describe them in as much terrifying detail as the latter two (especially the last) in the trilogy.  For parents who are concerned for their children who want to read this series, my advice to you is to read the books for yourself, then allow your children to read them.  You will both enjoy the series, and you'll know exactly what happens in the novels if you choose to censor one from your kids.m your kids.
B0041KKYEM|5.0|I watched this film at a theater near me on early march when was available in my town, after the academy awards and was a shock! Actually this is a great film, some kinda mental but with the thriller at the core with some traces of good old horror flicks. I remember the comments on amazon abut this one when I didn't see it, one was remarkable talking about an Argento style rip-off. Anyway, here is what you got: a sneak peek into the ballet (I'm a totally ignorant about it) world with the just portion of sensuality and sexual intensity with both feeling repression and untamed rage in a black atmosphere of human emotions and mental affections. Great film for troubled mother-daughter relationships...and Natalie Portman,  & Mila Kunis are/look so gorgeous, and a very decadent Wynona Ryder and Vincent Cassel as usual, totally amazing performance of the whole cast and the music is simple sublime. I'm going now through the extras that are a deep view on the film-making, not to forget the pretty double ballerina of Miss Portman. Now I understand why Degas loved so much the ballerinas!
B003O86FMW|5.0|If you were hooked at The Hunger Games, and yourself hungered for more, you will not regret buying or reading this book.  It picks up right where the last left off, and takes the plot so much further.<br /><br />The ending is a wonderful cliffhanger, and I was left waiting with baited breath for the final instillation of the series to get published.  Luckily, the Kindle edition came out when the hardcover did, and I was not left waiting any longer.  :)<br /><br />You get a deeper look into the Capitol and it's workings, and just how fragile this society could be.
0385495323|5.0|This is just one more excellent book from Simon Singh.  It probably had less to surprise me than his other books, since I am a long-time fan of [[ASIN:0684831309 The Codebreakers: The Comprehensive History of Secret Communication from Ancient Times to the Internet]].<br /><br />But I would like to break away from reviewing this book (which already has more than 200 reviews) to make a more general statement: Simon Singh has written three books that I know of, and THEY ARE ALL EXCELLENT.  You should not miss [[ASIN:0007162219 Big Bang: The Origin of the Universe (P.S.)]], nor should you overlook my favorite, [[ASIN:0385493622 Fermat's Enigma: The Epic Quest to Solve the World's Greatest Mathematical Problem]].

B0033AI4CK|5.0|I loved it from the beginning to the end.  Great script, great acting, great cinematography.  One of the finest movie ever made about the media.  This movie was made in 1976.  The media of today didn't change a bit.
B001LMU182|5.0|I've heard of AKIRA for so long that I can't remember ever NOT knowing about it.  This week, however, was the first time I'd actually seen it.  This is no Saturday Morning cartoon.  No wonder it's still around 20+ years later.  It's terrific!  Interesting story with characters you actually get to know and care about, visually engaging animation and a really good soundtrack!      Sorry, I can't compare it to too many other animation classics because I just haven't seen all that many.  Still... it's a matter of \\"I know what I like\\" and I liked AKIRA!
B0015AARJI|4.0|this product is okay for a second hand remote.  it don't vibrate like the real dual shocks.  and you can't go in a straight diagonal line.  other than that i say a okay.
1878424505|5.0|The Four Agreements is truly life changing the more you apply and the deeper depth you can understand to the meaning of the messages.  To take nothing personally is a real challenge for me (one of the four) but the more I work on this I find my view radically changing!  It is an awesome book even if you think you already \\"know this stuff\\".
B00514HDNW|5.0|In short this was a suspenseful, fast paced story. Once I started reading it I couldn't put it down. Nothing like the movie (they rarely are). The ending was classic, you won't be disappointed.
B004K4AUZW|5.0|Simply put, this record is beyond words...Gaga has, in one fell swoop, cemented her stature as a serious artist on a mission, one with a future, and one for the ages...and you really get the impression that, as great as this album is, she will be soaring to even GREATER heights as she evolves over the years.  \\"Born This Way\\" is both sheer perfection and humanly IMperfect...you really cannot ask anything more of the greatest artists, and Gaga is now slam-bang in the group of the greats...I even love her more than Madonna, who did not write much of her early work, not even \\"Like A Virgin\\", but Gaga's written basically everything (songs released AND unreleased) and she's a MUSICIAN, playing multiple instruments, and composing since age 4, plus she's a visionary who turns everything to gold that she touches, and she's FASCINATING...college courses were made about Gaga and fame.  Plus, she's a social advocate and is a really sweet person who exudes good vibes, and she knows how to throw a party.<br /><br />But this is about \\"Born This Way\\", Gaga's 2nd REAL album...\\"The Fame Monster\\" was an add-on EP to her great debut \\"The Fame\\"...and she's so far ahead of everyone else in the pop stratasphere that I can only imagine how the copycats will attempt to catch up now!!  They have their work cut out for them, for sure.  I love that at the root of Gaga's music is a living and beating hard rocking heart, she's no pop tart at all, and those hardrocking elements have come to the fore on \\"Born This Way\\".  Here's the breakdown of the rocking AND eclectic \\"Born This Way\\"...the full 17 track version...not counting the remixes on Disc 2 which are hit & miss.<br /><br />1-- \\"Marry The Night\\"...10/10...great catchy opener with a nice chorus that would work on pop radio...great fullbodied vocal by Gaga.<br /><br />2-- \\"Born This Way\\"...10/10...even tho it was highly exposed, it's still a great song with a great message...even tho there are similarities to Madonna's \\"Express Yourself\\", I love BTW even more, it's more satisfying a song and Gaga wrote it.<br /><br />3-- \\"Government Hooker\\"...10/10...wow, I love this song, the operatic vocal with the pingponging club beat...it will throw off EVERYONE, which cracks me up just thinking about it...nice lyric about JFK too.<br /><br />4-- \\"Judas\\"...10/10...wowza...my fave Gaga single to date, from the odd structure that works, the hard industrial feel mixed with catchy pop, that epic chorus...it's just creative, it works and it has cool, provocative imagery, what's NOT to like??<br /><br />5-- \\"Americano\\"...9/10...I really like this song, this mix of flamenco, latin, club and pop...it's not as good as AZ's Roger Clyne & The Peacemakers' catchy rocking song from 2004 of the same name, but it could work as a mashup together???  Someone hop on it pronto, maybe I will??  Gotta figure out how.<br /><br />6-- \\"Hair\\"...10/10...the first of 2 songs on BTW featuring Clarence Clemons from Bruce Springsteen's E-Street Band on sax, and it's got a great new wave feel, melody, chorus, message, vocal...the works.<br /><br />7-- \\"ScheiBe\\"...10/10...OMG...one of the coolest songs on the album, and the intro IN GERMAN is similar to the English breakdown on 'Judas'\\" bridge...listen and compare, same metre...but it's just COOL and epic and dark and catchy as hell...pretty cool song idea too...LOVE it!!<br /><br />8-- \\"Bloody Mary\\"...10/10...freaking awesome...has a nice oozing slow gloomy dramatic Doors/Brecht feel that is just epic played loud...I can just picture a cool remix of this, official or not, in the future...maybe I should attempt this too??<br /><br />9-- \\"Black Jesus + Amen Fashion\\"...10/10...the first of 3 bonus tracks...LOVE it and the purchasers of just the regular 14-tracker are really missing out...it has this utterly GREAT dark gothic death disco feel, like Sisters Of Mercy or PiL's \\"Death Disco\\"...typical Gaga subject matter, but picture a black runway, nice.<br /><br />10- \\"Bad Kids\\"...9/10...the first

0670022411|1.0|I had read a review in a magazine highly recommending this book, and I thought the premise sounded interesting.  I was quite excited to order it on my new Kindle and patiently waited two weeks for the book to be officially released.  Oh,  how I wished I had waited.  The first few chapters were rather engaging, but after a while, I found myself wondering when the story would move along. I felt like I was stuck in a morass, while the author dithered away repeatedly describing the same things over and over, never moving the plot along.  I actually stopped reading the book about three quarters of the way through, I just couldn't take it anymore.  I consider myself an avid reader and I have to say, this one did me in, I simply could not finish it.   I checked the reviews here, just to see if it was only me, and I have to say, the other dissatisfied readers reviews were far more entertaining than this book will ever be.  Maybe, if I get really bored ( or have a bout of insomnia ) I will eventually return to finish this book.  But I doubt it.  I gave it one star only because there wasn't anything lower.
B003Y5H556|1.0|What a Boring piece of Tripe. Made Twilight seem fast paced and exhilarating. The story is convoluted, the pace is mundane and the acting is Childish. Want to say something good , well the girls in this village are all attractive , apparently no ugly people in this land either.
B0019NG73G|5.0|As a child of the 1990s, I first encountered \\"Gettysburg\\" during one of its myriad screenings on the TNT cable network. I immediately connected with the film, a connection which has germinated into, if not obsession, certainly a keen interest in this period in our nation's history. Slavery, independence, invasion, politics, economics, brother against brother -- all ingredients for a potent and portentous conflict, and especially for great drama. I've also read Michael Shaara's great, Pulitzer Prize-winning novel, [[ASIN:034540727X The Killer Angels]] from which this film was adapted, and it is certainly worth your time and makes an excellent companion to the film.    The film's strengths are its focus, length, and authenticity. By concentrating on a single conflict -- the pivotal battle at Gettysburg -- author Shaara and filmmaker Maxwell are able to delve into the psyche of their three leads, Confederate Generals Lee and Longstreet and Union Colonel Chamberlain, and paint an impression for the audience as to how and why these men were locked in such a long and bloody struggle. The level of character development is almost unheard of for a war epic, and a leisurely-yet-assured pace holds the viewer's attention for the duration of the film, which isn't the case with this film's companion prequel, \\"Gods and Generals.\\"    As for this Blu-ray, I'm very pleased. The 271-minute extended cut of the film and commentary track is presented on the first Blu-ray disc while the documentaries, battlemaps, and trailer from the DVD release are housed on a second disc, also a DVD (and thus in standard definition). The digibook packaging is very attractive with vivid colors and the film's title is embossed; it's really quite striking. The 40-page booklet inside features cast and crew bios, as well as some commentary on the film and battle, along with a Civil War timeline. It's an excellent package.    The video presentation, while not reference quality, is quite good. Colors and finedetail are greatly improved over the DVD. There is significant film grain throughout, and, having never had the good fortune to view this in a theater, for the first time I really felt that the movie looked like a film. Watching this Blu-ray, you will wonder how you put up with that smeared DVD for so long. Audio is much the same; presented here in 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio, finally with a dedicated LFE channel for your subwoofer, so that cannonfire, gunshots, and Randy Edelman's stirring score all have far more oomph over previous incarnations.    All-in-all, if you own the DVD, this Blu-ray makes for an excellent and worthwhile upgrade. If you're new to the film, this is currently the best way to experience it. Very highly recommended.
B004Z2TUGE|1.0|This movie felt like nothing more than a trailer for the sequel.  Casting was terrible, save for Timothy Olyphant, who was chronically underutilized; story was lacking(surprise!);the pace was alright, but the plot was less of a coordinated mash-up than an absolute cluster-cuss crafted from Bay's previous partial storylines, with no direction, no ending, and no depth.
B000PKX2KA|4.0|Bought this to use with a netbook running Windows 7. On the upside, the hardware couldn't be simpler, locking onto satellites after the first time is surprisingly fast, and Streets and Trips seems to like it just fine. It picks up satellites faster than either of my dedicated GPS units do. The only con I have is the lack of even a one page getting started guide in the box. This would be especially useful for Windows 7 users since you need to grant the GPS Info software the right to run as administrator or it won't work. (This was mentioned in a document downloaded with the latest driver from the website, and might be mentioned in the docs on the CD, but I didn't check.) Anyway, the steps to happiness are: 1. Install driver; 2. Plug in GPS; 3. Install GPS Info; 4. On Windows 7, go to the install location and set the GPS Info executable to run as administrator; 5. Start GPS Info and you should see the data being dumped from the unit. If not, try another COM port in GPS Info. (You may see a message when you first plug in the unit as to which COM port is being mapped to that USB socket - probably a good idea to use the same socket each time or a different COM port may be assigned.)
B001HN6918|5.0|My husband, child, and I are fans of the original Kung Fu Panda, but I was rather wary about this sequel since most sequels are never nearly as good as their predecessors. Well, I am glad to be proven wrong by Kung Fu Panda 2! All three of us thought this was not only a worthy successor to the original but actually much better. The key elements that make an animated movie a winner are all here - a stellar cast, impressive animation, well-written script, and a story that appeals to both children and adults.<br /><br />The original cast returns in this sequel with Jack Black providing the voice of Po the adorable Dragon Warrior Panda; Angelina Jolie as Tigress; Jackie Chan as Monkey; Seth Rogen as Mantis; Lucy Liu as Viper; David Cross as Crane; Dustin Hoffman as Shifu the Kung Fu Master; and James Hong as Mr. Ping, Po's dad. In this sequel, viewers are introduced to a new nemesis, Shen, a magnificent peacock skilled in Kung Fu, yet possessed of the blackest of hearts. Shen is ably voiced by Gary Oldman, and every nuance and turn of phrase conveys the evil residing within this creature. One of my favorite Asian actresses, Michelle Yeoh provides the voice of the Soothsayer Ram, an important character in this movie.<br /><br />The story this time centers around Po trying to find his inner peace as instructed by Shifu. Trouble is, Po is haunted by questions about his past, triggered by an encounter with a bandit wolf. Meanwhile, as Po goes through this inner conflict (something which he chooses not to share with his friends), there is serious trouble brewing over in the capital city. Shen, who was once the heir to the Peacock Throne has amassed an army of ferocious wolves, and most importantly, invented a weapon that makes Kung-Fu seem almost obsolete. Shen is enraged when the Soothsayer Ram refuses to back down from her prediction made many years ago - that Shen's fate is intertwined with that of something which is black and white. So the stage is set for a showdown between Po and Shen.<br /><br />The story flows seamlessly, and the animation is of stellar quality. We watched it in 3-D, and I enjoyed the effects, especially the battle scenes (and there are tons of those in this movie). The talented cast makes this a pleasure to watch as each actor brings a unique interpretation to his/her character, and it wasn't about Jack Black voicing a panda, but Po as a real character that comes into his own in this sequel. As in the original, positive messages abound here and these are woven seamlessly into the fabric of the story without seeming to come across as overly didactic. Themes such as the notion of what constitutes a family; loyalty; friendship; ambition/greed/evil; and self-identity are all portrayed in a convincing manner, and best of all, there's lots of humor in here, even when the subject matter is serious. This perfect balance of light and dark, the comical and serious, goes perfectly with the Eastern philosophy of Yin and Yang, and Po is the embodiment of these contrary forces.<br /><br />Kung Fu Panda 2 is rated PG, with a running time of 90 minutes. It is a movie that will appeal to both children and adults, and is entertaining, fun, and poignant. Highly recommended!.    The story flows seamlessly, and the animation is of stellar quality.

0761129235|5.0|What this book teaches is a very simple and effective program for problem solving and achieving personal goals.  We Westerners believe in achievement through sheer will power, but those who follow this approach usually end up exhausted and eventually quit.  For example, how many of us are able to keep those New Year's resolutions of daily exercise, weight loss diets, or quitting smoking, just by will power?  Very few.  Will power works for a week or two until you quit in frustration.  On the other hand, the Japanese philosophy of small steps or Kaizen, (which started in the USA, ironically) shows people how to achieve their goals much more effectively through gentle daily persistence.  In this book, psychologist Robert Maurer says Kaizen works because it teaches people to avoid their \\"fight or flight\\" response by taking absurdly easy daily steps.  He's right, but I think there is more to it than that; Kaizen likely engages the power of the subconscious mind.  If you work with this faithfully, you'll find that there is a learning curve; something mysterious kicks in like power steering to make the task easier than it should be.  The 4 main techniques this book will teach the reader are: ask small questions, think small thoughts, take small actions, and solve small problems.  This is a different way of thinking about problem solving and goal setting than we're use to.  It doesn't require Herculean effort.  It can't be that easy, can it?  Yes.  Every problem I've focused on using Kaizen has been successfully resolved.  As an illustration, I've used it to lose weight when other approaches didn't work; I have used it to break the addictive habit of eating certain junk foods; and years ago I used it to quit smoking.  After trying to quit cold turkey a couple times didn't work, I reasoned that it took many months to get addicted to cigarettes, so couldn't I slowly reduce the number of cigarettes I smoked over many months?  Starting with a pack a day, I decided to reduce just one cigarette every 3 days.  I stuck with it, patiently, and never felt overwhelmed.  By the time I got down to 5 cigarettes, all physical and psychological desire for them left me, and I just stopped, without any agonizing withdrawal symptoms.  That was many years ago.  You're only limited by your imagination on how you apply this in your life.  This book is worth every penny.

B004EPZ06G|2.0|On the commentary track for David Gordon Green's \\"PINEAPPLE EXPRESS\\", Seth Rogen compares the audience of that film, watching him put his blown off ear back together, with the audience that can watch \\"HOSTEL\\" and \\"SAW\\" unflinchingly, then decides that they both might be the same audience. There was an eruption of laughter in my theater during the original \\"HOSTEL\\" film, when Jay Hernandez's torturer slipped on two severed fingers, accidentally driving a chain saw through his midsection. I heard similar outbursts during a fantasy sequence in \\"SUPERBAD\\" when a security guard brutally slashes Jonah Hill's throat with a bottle. There is a line that's no longer fine when dividing horror realism with comedy or vice versa, and Todd Phillips' \\"THE HANGOVER PART 2\\", has no idea which side of the road it's on.    The picture opens with a small gathering of laborers putting seats together by an alter for a wedding. An impatient bride receives a phone call from Bradley Cooper, who is not her groom to be. His side profile shot leaves just enough room in frame to show Ed Helms and Zach Galifianakis, staring at the ground in defeat. \\"That's not going to happen\\", Cooper responds to the question of a yay or nay wedding. Cut to rolling camera overheads of empty landscapes featuring the sounds of Danzig. Sound familiar? If you've seen the original, you've basically seen the new one-but instead of Las Vegas, they're in Bangkok.    I find it unnecessary to explain any of the plot, seeing how the original has generated almost half of a billion dollars and is considered the highest grossing R-rated comedy of all time. I doubt there's few who have any interest in this picture at all that don't know what the scenario is. What the original lacked, this one tried to make up for, and unfortunately failed in the process. Like a \\"SCREAM\\" movie, these characters aren't stupid and are very aware of what they did in the movies before, which weeds out a lot of guess work, but makes it hard for the formula to be executed as well as the original.    Todd Phillips is a constantly maturing filmmaker, and I believe the original \\"HANGOVER\\" will remain his most gifted work (it even brought him a Best Film in Comedy or Musical category at The Golden Globes). He became noticed with the forgettable yet disturbing documentary, \\"FRAT HOUSE\\" followed by the equally forgettable \\"BITTERSWEET MOTEL\\" where he followed the band Phish, for reasons I still don't quite understand. \\"ROAD TRIP\\" was a success but didn't have the comic fortune that his \\"OLD SCHOOL\\" did. There should be no question that Frat Boy humor is what his pictures bleed from the frames, and probably always will. So setting his first sequel in Thailand, I anxiously awaited the plethora of \\"Bangkok jokes\\" that would fall flat, only to discover there would be just one...and anything but flat.    There was a dark ferocity in part one that didn't go too far over the limit. There were times I thought the missing Doug might be dead, and the film was structured to such a confident degree that it would have maybe even worked better if he was. They played with jokes about the date rape drug, and I was somewhat disappointed that none of them were. For the most part, he makes up for what I was hoping would happen to the characters, with \\"HANGOVER PART 2\\" and goes to the darkest territories he's yet to uncover in a picture. But again, I was disappointed that he didn't see them all the way through, (one including a potential death that would have honored the ever present dread element).    The biggest uproars in the theater were not laughs, but gasps. Sure to be the most talked about involves Ed Helms' character, Stu, with something that had people rolling in the aisles in \\"NAKED GUN 33 1/3\\" and had mouths drop to the floor in disbelief with the clever twist in Neil Jordan's \\"THE CRYING GAME\\". This is neither, because it is pure shock value, and this is where the two genres of Comedy and Horror share a dysfunctional marriage. \\"THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY\\" was an enormous success, because in between the I-can't-believe-it's, was a clever Rom-Com with a superior script. Movies like the \\"AMERICAN PIE\\" series and virtually every Ashton Kutcher flop, had no talent executives see two scenes and think \\"we got to up the ante\\". The ante became nothing short of trash and not even blanketed with a clever script around it. Hard to believe now, because of films like \\"THE HUMAN CENTIPEDE\\" and \\"TEETH\\", but less than a decade ago, people flocked to the theater to see the original \\"SAW\\" because they thought, \\"is he really going to cut his foot off?\\" That one foot spawned hundreds of severed feet, where a whole generation of moviegoers now yawn at detachable body parts. Just because it's bloodier or grosser does not make it scarier or funnier.    There is a new breed of comedy that's been creeping up through the cracks, that's darker, meaner and fiercer. Filmmakers like Jody Hill who gave us \\"OBSERVE AND REPORT\\" and HBO's \\"EASTBOUND AND DOWN\\" are scoring big with audiences. Anything goes for a laugh nowadays, be it violence, rape or heavy drug use. There used to be a time when marijuana was the only drug you could make jokes about, now we're asked to laugh at heroine use and roofies (with a little cocaine on the side). Phillips seems so desperate to play with these ideas, that the context they're being used in is inappropriate for the movie that we're watching. That's not to say the \\"mean bone\\" the comedy skeleton has been adapting by way of Comedic Darwinism is a failure-I think Danny McBride, Seth Rogen, Will Ferrell and Adam McKay are all greatly onto something, but when you're funniest character (and most lovable if you could say that) is still the naturally born clueless dim-wit who cries for friendship, you need to keep that bone out of your skeletal structure. Phillips was so desperate to get blood on the side of the characters' car, they pointlessly drive through a dead pig. Not to sound like apsychopath, but if you're going for that effect, why not hit a character?    There is, however, no argument that it was fun to see this group again on the screen. Every actor is as gifted comedically as they are dramatically and as usual, Galifianakis is the show stealer. I laughed quite a bit, but not as hard as I wanted to...I mostly closed my eyes. There is a look to this movie that I can only compare to Eli Roth's \\"HOSTEL\\" films. The grit, the uncertainty and the nastily rusted hole in the wall rooms that look like torture chambers, sort of worked perfectly with this picture. In the marketing for both \\"HOSTEL PART 2\\" and \\"THE HANGOVER PART 2\\", we see empty rooms with spinning fans and leaky pipes that are so dirty you wouldn't want to put your worst enemy in them. Without any major props, blood on the walls or talent, your mind races by just seeing these empty rooms thinking \\"how did they get there?\\" and \\"what could have possibly happened?\\". \\"HANGOVER 2\\" also beautifully plays with the horrors of not knowing where you are overseas, that \\"HOSTEL\\" and John Landis' \\"AN AMERICAN WEREWOLF IN LONDON\\" earned 80% of their atmos-fear from. I don't think it's a coincidence that all three filmmakers (Phillips, Roth and Landis) have intertwined violence with frat boys, going back to the original with Landis' \\"ANIMAL HOUSE\\", which is the reason we even have a \\"HANGOVER\\" in the first place. They're all extremely gifted filmmakers, who all show similarities in style. I eagerly await Todd Phillips' horror film, if it ever finds its way down his career path.    \\"THE HANGOVER\\" worked itself to such a clever limit, where every obstacle was a discovery and within each discovery were more hilarious details and anecdotes, whether believable or not, they complimented the talent and the story. A high speed drive in a beaten down Mercedes, where a van pulls alongside of them, tossing out their wedding tuxedos, followed by a complimentary close of one character's misfortune turned to discovering $80,000 worth of Bellagio hotel chips, works so much better than just a straight boat ride home with no catharsis. Take a tattoo, shaved head, nasty hotel room and a monkey. Does that even come close to the efforts of a smoking chair, Crystal champaign bottles set like bowling pins, missing tooth, Tiger in the bathroom, baby in the closet, valet attendant returning them a police car and an unexplained chicken? No. You give more, you can work with more. \\"HANGOVER 2\\" resides on old elements that aren't half as clever as the first.

Those are my times too & I have made peace with the new world just like Clapton. If you can't, I feel sorry for you. Finally, for those of you who expect Eric to be the standout front man on this album it's not about that; It's about this great blues man leading a team of great blues men & women in doing what they all love deeply.
B004SBQAN8|2.0|Not having read any of these teen-angst-superpower-secret-lives novels, I have to admit that I enjoyed the '[[ASIN:B001P5HRMI Twilight]]' films. But having been exposed to and experienced that world, I am less enthused with the stunning array of wannabes that have been spawned in their wake. Had no idea this movie was based on a similar set of teen storybooks (learned it only after reading fellow Amazon reviews) thinking instead this might be an original concept. So to say I'm disappointed would be an understatement.<br /><br />That's not to fault the actors, all of whom did a decent job in their archetypical roles. But even solid acting can't save a director's snooze-fest. And this reveals another pitfall of the uninspired - plagiarism, intentional or not, can be deadly for a film. Rarely are copies, in any media, as bold or engaging as the original.<br /><br />Where Twilight had a quiet electricity, both in terms of performances and tempo, the same formula in Four is incredibly stodgy and the pace molasses slow. Where Twilight is understated, Four is shallow. And I won't count the stunning array of plotholes in this flick, suffice to say there are quite a few. I often wonder if these directors ever take the time to work out the basic framework of these projects in pre-production? How difficult can it be to sit down and ask the writers some basic queries? Seems like there's no end to the simple questions with simple answers that elude these filmmakers.<br /><br />Won't count them, but I'll highlight a few:<br /><br />- If their intent is to destroy worlds, and according to Timothy Olyphant's character, that's their purpose: Why are there only a half dozen bad guys? Is their entire race comprised of six humanoids and their two whatchamacallits? And since they were so easily killed, doesn't that put a crimp on their destroy-the-world campaign? Why haven't the bad guys sent in an army? And why stop at an army if your intent is to destroy a planet - wouldn't you basically have an entire battle fleet? In other words, your intent is to destroy a world - what do you do? Send in six of your men with two attack creatures to slowly hunt down the remaining victims from your previous conquest AND THEN set out to destroy the world. No one sees a logical problem with this?<br /><br />- Why are the bad guys hunting them in order? Is it important? Symbolic? Does it have some significance to the symbols? If so, why wasn't it explained? How long would that have taken - thirty seconds in the film?<br /><br />- Why only one bodyguard per Number? If you were testifying against the mob - the FBI throws a virtual mini-army around you. Is it the 'Spartan' thing? One man = one army? Another 30 seconds, maybe less for an explanation.<br /><br />And I'm only asking those few because I don't want this review to become thesis-length, which it easily could do.<br /><br />There really isn't a nice way of framing this next critique. But I'm really amazed by how incredibly stupid some directors are when it comes to family pets - especially dogs. I'm not certain the current crop of film school graduates understands that there is a vast amount of pet lovers in America, their primary audience and market. And that market does not like seeing pets, even fictional ones, hurt in films. And in truth, stupidity would be a step up from emotional disconnect.<br /><br />Because if you lack empathy - you're not human. I'm not being glib, I mean it seriously and literally.<br /><br />My definition of 'humanity' requires empathy as one of the building blocks. If you're missing it, then you're fundamentally flawed. That isn't to say you're not functional, so I'm not suggesting serial killer or the like, but clearly you're damaged goods. And I would certainly never trust you in any capacity, under any circumstance, for any reason however trivial. Essentially, if you think it's okay to hurt a family pet - even a fictional one - you're a certified freak in my book. And again,I would never trust you or ever turn my back to you.<br /><br />Nor watch any of your films.<br /><br />I think directors or soon-to-be directors need to quantify who and what they want to be on a professional level.

B003ZSJ212|2.0|With star wars returning to theaters yet again in 2012 this time in 3D i expect they'll quickly return to bd in 3D  next time and with extended editions and new transfers.  If these movies had better transfers and were extended editions i'd be so there. At least dts is finally being used but we all realize a cash grab when we see it and this will be followed up with a better set after the new theatrical run.
159420229X|3.0|Found this book to be an \\"OK\\" read.  I wouldn't suggest it to a friend.   It would be easier for me to just summarize it for them and save them the time.   One thing that frustrated me was his coach telling him he needs to get into shape to be competitive.  And the subject isnt touched on at all after that.  Did he get in shape or not?  We'll probably never know if it would have helped unless he did one year out of shape and another in shape.

B002HJ9PTO|4.0|I bought this product to use with my new Canon HF R200 camcorder. The sound quality of the internal mic on the camcorder was OK...if you were within about three feet of the camera. Beyond that the audio quality fell off quickly, and at about 10-12 feet was pretty much lost in the backgroound noise.<br /><br />I wanted to do educational videos for YouTube and wanted better sound quality. I didn't want to spend lots of money for a wireless lavalier, so I bought this one. It has a 20 foot wire (I'm sure it could be extended.) that is adequate for my needs.<br /><br />The improvement in sound quality was very noticeable. It is battery powered and must be switched on for each use (and off afterward to save the battery). I chose a lower priced product because I was unsure if a lavalier mic would solve my audio issues. Perhaps a more expensive lavalier product would do a better job, but I'm happy with this product so far.<br /><br />If there is a drawback, it is that the clip for the mic is fixed...it does not have a swivel head and sometimes it is awkward to get the mic positioned for best audio quality. However, the mic is very sensitive and placement anywhere within about 12-15 inches of the speaker's mouth provides adequate quality.<br /><br />Good product, good price. I recommend that you give it a try, especially if this is your first external mic purchase. You can see the improvement in sound quality on my YT channel nov51947.

B004K4AUZW|4.0|I finally got my copy after waiting almost a month from pre-ordering it. When it finally arrived and I listened to the whole album I realized that this had been censored. The most notable censorship is on the song \\"Government Hooker\\". This is a GREAT song, but the lyrics have been censored. When I called Amazon customer service they have advised me that this is the only version available from the manufacturer. It was not advertized in any way as being a censored product so in that respect alone I am disappointed, and in Amazon as the only solution was to return the item for a full refund. After waiting in anticipation for a month I am torn on what to do. I love the album otherwise. The variety of the music and lyrics make this album a must have for any true little monster. My only advice would be to Amazon to make sure in the future that they know the details of what they are getting from their suppliers before issuing pre-sale on the albums. I am sure that I am not the only one that was disappointed to find out that my long awaited copy of \\"Born This Way\\" by the Mother Monster herself, Lady GaGa, had been censored. I am sure that she wouldn't have wanted it this way...
B004RRVHCW|5.0|I offer this assessment of the new album by Thurston Moore not as a Sonic Youth fan, but as an admirer of Moore's last outstanding solo record Trees Outside the Academy. Trees...had a similar approach to the music, but I find Demolished Thoughts to be a more fleshed out and fully realized set of songs. The fact that Thurston Moore collaborates with Beck Hansen -- who is the producer, an arranger, and plays synths, bass and sings -- does give this set a kind of aura of Sea Change. But at the same time Moore's tunes are entirely his own, and each unique. Hansen's production work ensures that the accompanying instrumentation is complimentary to the songs. Moore is a very good guitar player and his dusky, rich vocals, are totally wrapped up with a big hug and a kiss by fellow musicians Samara Lubelki (violin), Mary Lallimore (harp), Bram Inscore (bass) and Joey Waronker (percussion). Most of these songs are slow burners, with the openers Benediction and Illumine setting the pace. But Circulation rocks a wee bit and Orchard Street stretches out a long while with instrumental flights of fancy. That track is a marvel. Recording engineers Dean Nelson, Cole Marsden, Greif Neil, Cassidy Turbin at The Library and Justin Pizzoferralo at Flowers and Cream studio, working alongside producer Beck, have done an exceptional job making Demolished Thoughts sound so gorgeous. While there aren't blasts of noise-scapes like you'd hear from a Sonic Youth record, surprises abound. The whistling part early on in Mina Loy is one example -- proving that Andrew Bird isn't the only tunesmith on the block unafraid to whistle while he works - and in the same song Moore repeats the line \\"Without shame\\" with devastatingly beautiful impact. The fact of the matter is very few artists are brave enough to make albums like this anymore. Thurston Moore is willing as he ages to create mature music, working decidedly outside the box. And in the lovely suite of songs that is Demolished Thoughts he goes forsimple beauty to grand effect. Bravo!
B004K4AVAG|5.0|I ordered Lady Gaga's new album because I have a deep and abiding love of Gaga. It's something I can't explain, but my love of this woman's music runs deep. I did not like either of the singles very much, but I decided to give the rest of the album a chance.     I've seen a lot of bad reviews of this album and, after listening to it for three straight days, I'm not sure I understand why. This album is a lot different than the first two, yes, but why would anyone expect this woman to follow up with something similar? She likes to keep us guessing, after all.     Born This Way is darker than either The Fame or The Fame Monster, and both of those had their darker moments. Born This Way is a deeply personal and political view of Lady Gaga's take on the world, and it is amazing.    This album is all over the place musically speaking. It goes from slow, building ballads to dance beats to rock to techno. It keeps you on your toes. It's all listenable though. Very dramatic and well put together. I have trouble skipping most of the songs.     The lyrics are on par with what we've seen in the past, possibly better. Some of them are more cryptic, but it's all beautiful.     Her voice has undergone some changes too. It has more range here. She goes from her booming choruses, to her sweet verses, and sometimes she screams it. Sometimes her vocal instrument is just dedicated to sounds that aren't always intelligable, but always breathtaking.     I don't regret buying this album. I would buy it again. I'mlistening to it right now like I've been doing since it arrived.

When I opened my package from Amazon, I was disappointed to find this book is the physical size of 3\\"x3.75\\" and as you can imagine, contains less than a full chapter of information of the full sized book.

Make sure you purchase the full sized book, not the \\"Miniature Edition\\".
B002ZG997C|4.0|Don't let the first 30 minutes or so of 'The Book of Eli' fool you - it comes off as a bleak and moody mix of other post-apocalyptic stories like 'Mad Max' and 'The Road,' but by the time the credits roll you'll see the heart that beats beneath this cracked skin.<br /><br />There's a lot of story to uncover in 'The Book of Eli,' more than I initially expected, and the themes and ideas expressed here surprised me. In a very good way.<br /><br />Denzel Washington pulls off a subtle and understated performance as the lonely survivor of a cataclysmic event, as he moves with steady determination across dry desert landscapes - west, west, always west - protecting a book that he won't let anyone see. The other actors in the film are no slouches either, from Gary Oldman capturing the wonderfully twisted man in charge (recalling his bent cop from 'The Professional' for me) to Mila Kunis in a sidekick role that has impressive depth to Michael Gambon as a paranoid old man armed to the teeth and more.<br /><br />The tone of the cinematography matches that of Denzel's character, harsh and raw and blasted into wide-open silences. The music carries us along in this vein as well, menacing and stark.<br /><br />The action sequences are shot elegantly, almost like a dance - though often a dance where limbs fly and the dance only ends when the bodies stop twitching. These scenes do, however, stretch credibility to the absolute breaking point, as Denzel faces off against multiple enemies repeatedly and rarely gets a scratch. There is a possible reason for this explained about halfway into the film, but it comes too late and explains too little. This is probably the only weakness in a story that is otherwise impressive and unexpected.<br /><br />The final scenes are simply a marvel of storytelling, and almost perfectly executed.<br /><br />The wonderful thing about 'The Book of Eli' is the discovery of it. It methodically blasts away at every glimmer of hope...it does not flinch or look away. But then there is one who holds on. One who walks west, one who protects a single book with his life, one who will not give up, even when everyone around him already has.<br /><br />For a film to express the ideas of hope and faith while avoiding trite, saccharine sentiments completely isn't just impressive - it's practically a revelation.who walks west, one who protects a single book with his life, one who will not give up, even when everyone around him already has.

B0036T31YY|4.0|I can see why many reviewers compare this in some ways to Momento, both tease you well and with a good pay off. I can't think of anything that hasn't been said except the one moment that really opens our eyes to where the movie is going - the mirror scene with the record player playing Anchors away. t is a classic moment I don't think I have ever seen before done in a film.<br /><br />There are some similar that are for shock value - scenes (unlike this movie's one) where the person in the mirror does something different that the person being reflected, here though it cements a journey that takes us on this fun ride!<br /><br />The one scene that is creepy that is worth mentioning, I refuse to give anything away, although likely MOST of the readers of the reviews of Triangle WATCHED Triangle already - that scene is where the dying girl is on deck and the viscous loop that happens in Triangle seems to resonate the haplessness of the situation, this and the the tossed bird scene as well as the skipping record all burn the reality that this women is hopelessly trying to correct.<br /><br />Great film, unique and gripping - tells a paradox story better than most I have ever seen before.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|Don't buy the bluray and do what I just did.  I just ordered the DVD set with the original versions.  The original version on DVD is not perfect.  They are not formatted in 16x9.  But I adjust the settings on the TV and it fills the screen.  Picture is not perfect but I don't care because I want to see Han Solo shoot first and I want to see the original Jabba band and song.  I also want to hear Han Solo say \\"trust me\\".... not \\"I can see a lot better now\\".      Don't get me wrong.  I love when they release the movies with added scenes.  I just don't like when they change the scenes.  Just plain dumb!    Just wait on the Bluray.  George Lucas will eventually release the bluray set with the originals in about 2 years.... just like he did with the DVD set.  I got suckered into buying the first release of the DVD set but should have waited for the second release.  I refuse to buy the bluray.
B0051QIGP4|3.0|Paid $7 for the album because Amazon servers went down from the huge demand when it was on sale for $1. The album is okay.
B004NYQYNQ|5.0|Adele could teach the current generation of girl power singers a thing or two.  With her huge, expressive voice, modernized version of the Motown sound, and emotionally compelling lyrics, she has written an album that is almost as good as pop music can get.  I've probably listened to it two dozen times now, and it's just growing on me more and more.     As I said, Adele's voice is huge and expressive, such a crowd pleaser that the first time I heard her, I assumed she was a graduate of American or British Idol.  (In fact, she's even more democratic than that -- she got her break as a self-published MySpace hit, then got discovered.)       This isn't quite a concept album, I really like that it's got enough of a theme to it to make listening to the whole album a different experience from the sum of its parts.  Adele apparently wrote it while getting over a breakup, and that loss forms the theme.  The songs go after her ex, plead with him, cry at him, and ultimately come to a kind of peace.  Even her cover of the Cure's \\"Lovesong,\\" which some people think is the weakest part of the album, works really well in this context -- singing along with old Cure songs is exactly what I would expect a heartbroken 21 year old to do.  (And I like the cover a lot, for the record.)     The lyrics are often beautiful and haunting, enough that I can easily overlook a few clunkers (like her ex playing Adele's heart \\"to the beat\\" or Adele being \\"born and raised\\" in a \\"summer haze.), and they tell real stories, using a few words to paint a whole relationship.     The music and production is just about perfect -- a modernized Motownish sound that goes perfectly with Adele's soulful performance, and tight, cleanly produced songs.    Since it holds together, I strongly recommend the full album, but if you're looking for a few tracks to sample, I strongly recommend :Rolling in the Deep,\\" \\"Rumor Has It,\\" \\"Set Fire to the Rain\\" and \\"Someone Like You\\" as starting points.
B002ZG97RY|1.0|The movie does not play. I have already informed the seller and received no response. The digital copy works but that is no use in seeing the movie on a large screen in Blu-Ray.
0440180295|1.0|Touted as a \\"masterpiece\\" of science fiction, I picked this up in the hopes of it being a good read. Boy, was I mistaken.    The book is a boring snooze-fest about an imaginary man who travels between moments in his life. Oh, and it has a few aliens in it who kidnap him and put him in a zoo on their home planet. The latter covers perhaps four pages in total and the \\"time travel\\" schtick serves no purpose whatsoever as it jumps back and forth between moments that could just as well have been told chronologically.    The style of writing is simple and childish. The depth of the characters is nonexistent. There is no story to speak of. Oh, and the author apparently thinks it's funny to end every other paragraph with \\"so it goes.\\"    In the offchance that you consider this book because the rear flap touts it as \\"one of the great anti-war books of all time\\": forget it. The bombing of Dresden is barely addressed and the coverage of war limits itself to a handful of boring situations the main character finds himself in: wandering around in the Ardennes, on a German train as a POW, in a prison camp for two days and subsequently in Dresden. There is no war story to speak of, and the book is mostly about boring, metaphysical musings the main character is having.    What a complete waste of time and money.
B0042U94UQ|5.0|Steve Carell is a riot in this great movie. I was skeptical of the film (due to what I feel were mis-representing ads) going in, but soon was laughing out loud (literally, I'm not just saying \\"lol\\" for kicks) at the genius mixture of jokes and humor (largely due to the little things, like facial expressions and body language). I would HIGHLY recommend this movie to anyone.
B002VPE1Z2|5.0|This is my second AmazonBasics camera case. The first one was a leather case that I used for a Sony DSC-TX7. That case worked perfectly for as long as I owned the camera, the only reason I stopped using it is that the new camera, Sony DSC-HX9v, won't fit. I sold the camera to a friend and gave him the case.<br /><br />The Sony DSC-HX9v fits perfectly. I wear mine on my belt and even if it is bigger than my previous case it doesn't bother me at all. The interior is very soft and has plenty of room for cameras bigger than this one, I see at least one finger width of play at either side of the camera, but it doesn't move much once the case is closed.<br /><br />There is only one pocket (external), and it only expands on one side so I doubt you'll be able to cram more than two batteries in it. If all you need to carry is extra memory cards, space won't be an issue.<br /><br />As for the belt loop, so far it has done the job. I can wear the case on my belt for a full day without any issues, even if I am in the car.<br /><br />The outside material is a dull ballistic nylon-type material, with a small vinyl tab sewn onto the flap. All the stitching is solid. The velcro on the flap is sewn assuming that you are cramming the case, if the case is only carrying a camera like mine then you will wish that the velcro could reach at least another inch.<br /><br />Overall I am very pleased, I don't see why anyone would spend so much money for the Sony branded cases when this clearly does the job. I imagine image conscious buyers will want some kind of brand displayed on the case (this case only has one tiny brand on the zipper, which is hidden from view if the case is closed and the zipper is tucked in) but in my particular situation I want stealth and this case does the job perfectly.

B004G600A4|5.0|This movie is a favorite of my wife and I. We saw this while we were dating, and it was an instant favorite for us. It's a pleasant and genius conglomeration of humor, romantics, and action. Each character is 3-dimensional (i.e. not too simplistic) and adds a certain aspect to the film that makes the whole absolutely awesome! Just to reiterate - this film is a GREAT date-night movie for those who are dating, engaged, newlywed or going on a date as a not-so-recently-married couple. THREE thumbs WAY up!

B000XUBFE2|5.0|Last weekend I finally understood the meaning of required reading. (Yes, yes... I'm 30 and should have figured this out years ago, but lets face it...I'm a late bloomer.) Anyways, my point to all of this is (as long winded as it may appear to be) is that finally, after all of these years of brooding and general combativeness regarding primary school literature, I have realized that the younger we are, the more open we are to learning life lessons. Some lessons may be as simple as friendship, others may be about forgiveness or learning to let go, and then some, like \\"The Book Thief\\" (by Markus Zusak) are about nothing more than learning how to breathe.<br /><br />  \\"Set during World War II in Germany, Markus Zusak's groundbreaking new novel is the story of Liesel Meminger, a foster girl living outside of Munich. Liesel scratches out a meager existence for herself by stealing when she encounters something she can't resist-books. With the help of her accordion-playing foster father, she learns to read and shares her stolen books with her neighbors during bombing raids as well as with the Jewish man hidden in her basement before he is marched to Dachau. This is a story about the ability of books to feed the soul.\\"<br /><br />I have never finished a book before and instantly thought, \\"God, I wish I was an Lit teacher so I could force kids to read this\\" but that is exactly what happened to me when I let the final (devastating) words of \\"The Book Thief\\" seep into my core. WWII is not an untouched subject in HS, but an unadulterated understanding of the pain inflicted on ALL sides is. We read \\"The Diary of Anne Frank,\\" or \\"Ghost Soldiers.\\" We study the cruelty of the Nazi party and concentration camps, but what we don't study is the effects this particular war had on every day, run of the mill German society. We (as students) are not taught that members of Hitler's \\"superior race\\" were also forced to live a poverished life. That baths for children were rare and food was hard to come by. We were not taught that neighbors bred unnatural amounts of hate towards each other for no other reason than coffee or cigarette rations, or that children as young as 10 were forced into finishing camps, made to run for hours in freezing temperatures all in a thinly veiled hope that one day they would become a better collection of SS soldiers. No, we were only taught to understand and appreciate the side of the sympathizer, the Jews, the poor souls that had their lives dramatically changed, or more importantly ended for no other reason than to stroke a insecure man's ego. So imagine my surprise, that at the age of 30 I was finally offered a glimpse into the other side of a crumbling existence.<br /><br />Now, I could go on for hours about the complexities of this book. The plot, the characters, the way in which the story weaves in and out of itself like a perfectly pieced together quilt, but my adoration for this mesmerizingly beautiful piece of literature will never find justification through the words on a blog. I cannot write \\"aching\\" I can only describe it, and as I sat there last week, reading the words that caused even death himself to shed tears, I suddenly understood that none of these \\"things\\" (that we go on and on about when talking about books) mattered. What mattered is that I knew (without a doubt) that I would never look at a war (I was so well acquainted with) the same again. Instead, I would look at it through the eyes of a little German girl, who stole books to give the impression of peace during a time that was anything by peaceful.<br /><br />I stand before you a humbled woman and encourage each of you to open your mind, so we can learn from our past mistakes instead of dooming ourselves to repeat them.<br /><br />Happy reading my fellow Kindle-ites and remember: there is nothing more beautiful than a full heart.We were not taught that neighbors bred unnatural amounts of hate towards each other for no other reason than coffee or cigarette rations, or that children as young as 10 were forced into finishing camps, made to run for hours in freezing temperatures all in a thinly veiled hope that one day they would become a better collection of SS soldiers.

B003OFHMKO|2.0|If you like Esperanza Spalding, you'll probably like her latest effort, \\"Chamber Music Society.\\"  In many ways, it builds on the style she's cultivated since her release of \\"Junjo.\\"  While Ms. Spalding is certainly an accomplished musician and excellent singer, I'm not sure she's established a firm sense of who she is as a musician yet.  Since \\"Junjo,\\" and now with \\"Chamber Music Society,\\" her approach seems to be modal but not quite in the traditional hard bop sense of say a Wayne Shorter or Andrew Hill.  I may be missing something but most of the songs here aren't what one could call \\"blues based\\" but seem an exercise in chromatic modulation up and down the fingerboard.  As a result, there's plenty of \\"esoteric\\" harmonies but there's an absence of soul that's present in Shorter, Hill, or Hutcherson.  At times, she reminds me of Flora Purim, only without Corea's Fender Rhodes.  And that's okay -- she doesn't have to sound like anyone else but herself; I just wonder if the reason why the songs on her albums seem interchangeable is because she hasn't figured out how to break out of the approach to writing and playing that has defined her so far.  While I liked \\"Junjo,\\" \\"Chamber Music Society\\" left me a bit disappointed.  In fact, insofar as the Grammys are ever \\"fair,\\" Wynton Marsalis should have taken the award for \\"Vitoria Suite\\" before this album.  But, perhaps a renewed interest and larger audience for jazz can be affected by Ms. Spalding's popularity.

B002ZG977Y|4.0|The original movie was better. The 2010 remake provides an equal amount of adventure and mythological romaticism.  All of the acting was top notch too.  But they left out (yet paid hommage to) the owl in the original. The movie seem rushed to me. Special effects are good and its still entertaining to watch.
B004OEIL54|5.0|I decided to buy this movie on blu ray after having the dvd version of it. I`m trying to upgrade all my dvd collection to bluray discs... and let me tell you, this movie still kicks ass!!! The sound and image are great but the only thing that I think it`s missing are MORE extras. I love watching making-of, trailers, music videos related to the movie, etc... and since the bluray has more capacity and the Scream 4 had just came out when this was released, Dimenson could have put tons of extras over there.<br />The price was very nice as well, so I ended up buying the entire trilogy.
B000002LEM|4.0|This is the second round of Van Halen reborn as a Zeppelin'esque hard rock band with the powerhouse singer Sammy Hagar. It introduces 5 iconic tunes : the superb Mine All Mine, Cabo Wabo, Black and Blue, Finish What Ya Started, and When Its Love. The two heavy rockers AFU and Sucker in a 3-piece mirror early Van Halen songs I'm the One and Van Halen. Feels So Good is a Genesis like melodic rock tune, very sophisticated stuff. The sound, overall, is uneven. It needs to be remixed first, then remastered to give it a second life.

Loss of control, Tora Tora, Fools, look like loose jams with not enough to mature into a song. Dave recorded his yelling over Eddie's guitar in a way bearable only for Dave's inner circle. Eddie got his chops and mind together to unleash a new era of music for the band with the superb follow up Fair Warning.

B004DH8IK0|5.0|Pendulum is always fresh and this album is no exception. Rock, Techno, Electronica, Drum & Bass and even hints of Dumb step  can all be found on this album. Appealing the most for this album has to be the how many tracks we hear Rob Swire on. In conclusion buy this album if you want a fusion of fresh original \\"Drum & Bass\\" music, you wouldn't be disappointed!!!

B00004ZAV3|4.0|My wife love the Beatles, and mentioned that she would really love a Beatles album for our long drives.<br />I looked up a few, this seemed the best, so i bought it.<br />I was not disappointed, a lot of really great tracks, and great value!<br />Very happy with the purchase!
B004R63MWQ|2.0|I see why this film tanked in the theaters. It's a very empty vessel. It's worth the $1.99 I paid for a 48hr rental, but not more. Hollywood screws up another potentially great sequel w/the cheapo approach. I'm not surprised.
B004X0Y5GI|4.0|Ok, first thing, I'm a Gen Y Stevie Nicks fan...so keep that in mind...    I bought the album and listened to it with the realization that this is all new material, so I probably would not like it right away, so I promised myself that I would listen to it twice all the way through back to back before I picked 'my' songs.    I'm really happy I gave it that second shot...  My first observation on the second time around, is that the songs are in two parts each.  The first is a sort of extended intro where Stevie tells the story she's writing about.  Then the actual, what you might call 'song', begins.    This is where this albums true colors SHINE.    I bought this album this morning and have been listening to it all day, and it just keeps getting better.  I'm finding new levels to each song every time I hear it.      This is her best solo work since \\"The Wild Heart\\"    A must to be sure, but keep in mind that it's all new material, stuff we've never heard before...And you MUST listen to it two times in a row, back to back, if you want to 'get it'.
B001E45XT4|1.0|This is the second product I've purchased based solely on star reviews and been completely disappointed. The ear muffs are hot, scratchy, and attract a lot of lint and dust. The sound quality is mediocre at best. They're very heavy, bulky, and just overall uncomfortable. The sound quality just isn't that good. The speaker sensitivity is low so it's very difficult to get them very loud, without some type of external amp. I hate these things. The microphone isn't bad, in fact the recording quality is quite good. But I just can't stand to wear them for me their to hot, heavy, and annoying.
0981321119|5.0|What else I can say? Pride and Prejudice is classic. This specific one is for collection. The paper is clean and especially smooth.
0307887960|5.0|I've tried MANY different diets. Shots, shakes, pills, points, but this one works for me.  I don't feel cheated, starved, or the least bit hungry, but then I'm the type of person who really feels yucky if I eat too many carbs.      Do I miss snacking in general? Yes, I do.  However, losing the weight is more important to me.    This book is wonderful.  No counting calories, no watching what you eat.  You have a menu, and you stick to it. I've been able to go out to restaurants and eat well, still losing the weight, on this diet.  I never thought I would like the plain greek yogurt (0% fat), with a bit of Splenda for sweetness each day when I get home from work, but I do! It's like pudding and tastes great.    There are 4 phases to this diet:  Attack:  This is where you lose the most initially, and you are on an all-protein diet, for a short period of time.  Cruise: Here you have alternating days of all-protein and protein and vegetables (from a list in the book).  You are on the Cruise step until you get to where you want to be weight-wise.  Consolidation:  This is where you stabilize your weight loss. This phase of the diet is based on how many pounds you have lost, or 5 days for every pound.  Here is also where you are re-introduced to fruit, whole grain bread, cheese and some starchy foods.  Stabilization:  Where you have reached your true weight.    Dr. Dukan also promotes exercise, starting with a 20 minute walk each day, working up to 30 minutes.  He also promotes eating Oat Bran, going from 1 1/2 Tablespoons to 2 Tablespoons per day. In the book there is a recipe for an 'Oat Bran Galette', which is very tasty.  I don't do that, I just put the oat bran into my scrambled eggs; it works just as well.    Dr. Dukan also has many tips for people in various stages of life, from teens to peri- or post-menopausal women; to those who have a family history of obesity; to those who have tried every diet and whose bodies have become resistant to dieting. I've never seen this before, and I enjoy the fact that he recognizes that not all of us are size 8, wanting to get to a size 0 and are 21-35.  I'm now 50 and a size 14, and I just want to get back to where I was about 8 years ago, because I felt healthier.    Conclusion:  This is a very practical diet, and easy to follow.  I have a semi-sedentary job, and at home I'm a self-avowed couch potato.  I've lost weight, haven't excercised (except running down the hall at work when someone's screaming about drop-kicking their computer!) and I've STILL LOST WEIGHT!!!
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|I have not wrote that many reviews but I had to share how much I just loved this book!  It is wonderfully written and just lovely to read!  I cannot wait till the next one comes out!  I highly encourage you to give it a try!  I know you'll love it as much as I did!
0026009102|1.0|That's really all that needs to be said.  I started reading this book because a girl I liked loved this book.  I started out wanting to like this book.  By about page 200 I just gave up.  I have no problem reading long books.  I love Dostoevsky, Tolstoy, et cetera.  But if the book is going to be long it needs to have substance.  From the stand point of literature this book was horrid.  It had shallow characters and a predictable plot.  I was really excited to read the book because I was interested in learning about Ayn Rand's philosophy.  From what I've read her objectivism was not fully developed when she wrote this trash.  Fair enough.  But the philosophical ideas presented in this book (and they were presented AGAIN and AGAIN and AGAIN) were pretty shallow and really turned me away from caring to follow up and look into her more deveoped ideas.  This book was just aweful.  It was aweful from the stand point of literature.  It was aweful in terms of the philosophical ideas presented throughout the plot.  It was just aweful.
B002JVWRAO|5.0|I've been a fan of SUPERNATURAL for some time now. From the get go I was fascinated by the storyline that pitted two young brothers against a raging tide of formidable fantasy creatures of the night. The most amazing thing about the series is how it never stopped and never got stale; how it kept a story going that was hinted at from the first episode and played it out over time.<br /><br />If you've never seen the show then by all means start picking up the series in boxed sets. A basic background for the uninitiated is that the Winchester brothers, Sam (Jared Padalecki) and Dean (Jason Ackles) are monster hunters. When the series started, Sam had abandoned the family business and gone to college only to witness his fianc&eacute; die the same death his mother had years before, pinned to the ceiling and engulfed in flames by a yellow eyed demon. Now Sam wants revenge and rejoins with his sibling to take down all monsters and demons they come across.<br /><br />The boys were trained by their father who has disappeared and are part of a chain of hunters that they encounter every now and then in an episode. They also stay in touch with a man who holds more knowledge than anyone and who was sort of a surrogate father to boot, Bobby Singer (Jim Beaver). As the series progressed many things happened, including Dean's dying and being taken to Hell and Sam's learning that he held a power that could be fueled by drinking demon blood (which had terrible side effects). As angels and demons got involved the story changed from simple fighting a monster each week to discussions of the Apocalypse. And that's where season 5 opens.<br /><br />At the end of season 4, Sam had unwittingly opened the gates of Hell, breaking the seventh seal and setting free Satan himself. Now the brothers were on a quest to stop Satan and kill him. But as an angel, as an angel of great power, could Satan be killed? Worse yet the boys have been informed of something they never knew: Sam is the vessel of Satan while Dean is the vessel of Michael, the Archangel. By vessel we're talking the human host or body that will hold these opposing forces as they meet on the battlefield to fight their apocalyptic battle.<br /><br />Both refuse to allow these angels to possess them though and each week we find them searching for an answer that will prevent the apocalypse, deal with the guilt Sam feels for initiating it and find a way to get rid of Satan. Along the way they also must attempt to find God who seems to have disappeared, a search being done for the most part by renegade angel Castiel (Misha Collins) who has helped the boys on their journey.<br /><br />Episodes this season are fantastic with some of the most thought provoking and the most funny. Yes funny. One episode deals with a prankster they've encountered before who places them in various TV series like a CSI MIAMI satire, sitcom and GREY'S ANATOMY satire. Each is done like those series and comes up with laughs.<br /><br />On a more serious note, the boys find themselves dead and on the road to Heaven. What each of them views as Heaven, or their own version of it, is touching in so many ways. The question of God and why he would leave us to our own devices is brought up here and in other episodes as well. One would think that a movie that involved demon fighting and a ton of dark images would not bode well for those with religious beliefs. But the fact is that through it all the idea of faith runs strong from beginning to end.<br /><br />Season 5 focuses almost solely on the attempt to find a way to rein in Satan and deny him the use of Sam's body, to end the Apocalypse and to prevent the four horsemen from releasing their ills against humanity. It's a journey that holds your interest from start to finish. And it's a credit to the cast and crew that they can make you believe the story they are telling, to render portrayals that never get stale, to make you feel for these characters and to make you want to know thestory of Sam and Dean from start to finish.
B004EPZ06G|5.0|Let's get the meat of the review out of the way right away: if you enjoyed the first movie, there's no reason you shouldn't enjoy the second.    Yes, perhaps it is the same basic plot-line, but that's part of what makes the movie so funny. \\"It happened again\\" Phil says. \\"Seriously, what is wrong with the three of you?\\" Tracy replies.  Somehow, these three can't keep out of trouble.    But perhaps this time is even a bit more insane. Because this time they're lost in Thailand and have lost Stu's 16-year old brother-in-law.  Only this time, not only do they have no idea what happened, they have no idea how they became so inebriated that it could happen in the first place.  They only intended to have one beer...and of course, just like the first movie, we don't see the events occur. We learn about them as they flush out what happened.    If you're easily offended, this movie isn't for you.  If you didn't enjoy the first one, there's nothing about the second one that changes enough to make you like this one any more.    But if you want to bust a gut laughing, go see The Hangover Part II.
B003VS0CWY|5.0|This is a great musical even for those who don't like musicals as a rule. The flawless performances by Julie Andrews, Christopher Plummer and all the children make this a visual delight and heart touching movie especially for those with knowledge of the true story behind the movie...
B004SBS8LA|4.0|I like the new graphical style.  It's very unique.  What I don't like is in the May update, things are hovering in air instead of falling on stage 4. I consider that a bug, or at least a bad design.  I noticed the same thing in angry birds seasons.
B000P0J02E|5.0|I am normally very critical about Zimmer's work, considering his constant reverting to recycled themes with no creativity involved, relying solely on rhythm, resonance, and powerful ambiance. With \\"At World's End,\\" I was very skeptical, especially after hearing his metal-styled score for \\"Dead Man's Chest,\\" incorporating about 3 or 4 new themes, two of which he had already written for the first movie, but laid aside. I saw the film in theaters, didn't particularly like it, but found the score to be... not what I expected.    In fact, listening to the score made me eventually come to love the film. Zimmer, contrary to his normal style with synthesizers and recycled material, actually managed to write completely new material for the third film, as well as incorporating a primarily orchestra-based score. Coming from a person that does not take a liking to Zimmer music normally, \\"At World's End\\" was superbly composed with amazing ability and creativity, incorporating the already-established themes from the first two films with fantastic precision, and limiting the electronics to a minimum while still using the synth whenever appropriate (\\"Multiple Jacks\\").    In the process, Zimmer's \\"I Don't Think Now is the Best Time\\" was practically a musical suite of the entire film, as well as giving various winks and nods to the first movie. Clocking at almost 11 minutes, this track is possibly one of the best action/adventure cues I've ever heard, and I'm a soundtrack collector (89 scores). His new love theme for Will and Elizabeth especially shines as the driving force of their love, pronounced specifically in \\"One Day.\\" It possesses a certain \\"epic tale\\" quality to it, never ceasing to play on the adventurous circumstances which the two came to love each other. Sadly, this is the only movie which uses this theme.    The main theme for \\"At World's End\\" is finally introduced in all its bombast and glory in \\"Up is Down,\\" continuously repeating itself over and over throughout the track, but managing to keep one interested, considering the various instruments used. The main theme is also brought to us in \\"At Wit's End,\\" but isn't nearly as pronounced. \\"At Wit's End,\\" by the way, is also yet another cue that introduces us to many other newly created mini-themes that recur throughout the album, as well as finding their way into the fourth film, which I found astonishing. Zimmer almost never uses soft-spoken moments in film to exercise his creativity, but he does in this. \\"Hoist the Colours,\\" I'd say, is really the secondary main theme to \\"At World's End.\\" Sounds strange, but if you listen closely to the entire album, you'll see what I mean. It's more of the heroic type of theme that Jack Sparrow never had in the previous two films. Yes, in \\"Curse of the Black Pearl,\\" we were introduced to \\"The Medallion Calls,\\" but as a theme, it's more like an introductory piece to Jack, rather than a defining \\"hero\\" theme like the one presented in the third film. The \\"Hoist the Colours\\" theme is again donned in \\"What Shall We Die For?\\" but with a fuller orchestra, emphasizing the epic nature of the entire movie, as well as putting a face on the story's thematic point given in the entire trilogy.    Finally, we're given a greatly-satisfying conclusion in \\"Drink Up Me Hearties.\\" My only complaint is how the entire end credits weren't included in the track, which happened to contain music not given to us in the album. Instead, Zimmer later released this previously unreleased music in the fourth disc of the \\"Pirates of the Caribbean: Soundtrack Treasures Collection.\\"  As far as the lone cue on the \\"At World's End\\" album goes, it still satisfies. While listening the first time, I thought about how all the music in the album just screams, \\"LEGEND!\\" The music encompasses the film's epic style, rather than focusing exclusively on individual moments like what was done for the first film, and a little for the second film.     And praise Calypso, there are absolutely NOear-killing electronic remixes included in the score. All in all, this entire album as a whole became my favorite score, and still is, despite my loathing of Zimmer's musical methods given in most of his other works. If you're a Zimmer fan, you'll fall in love with this soundtrack immediately. If you're like me, and don't normally take much liking to Zimmer, trust me. This is incredibly well-composed material that you do not want to pass up.    5/5 stars
B002UAJ0BS|5.0|The best Nirvana album in this history of this band's inception.  Good times with this album and bad equally as well.  My only thing to tell anyone is watch out for the greatest cut on cd or vinyl or cassette.  Good luck and let the engines be ready.
B003UESJF6|5.0|The movie is really funny. Will Farrell delivers an awesome performance as does the rest of the cast. The soundtrack is awesome (AC/DC, GNR, G. Thorogood, Ozzy)
B003VANOFY|5.0|This headset is just awesome...I received it today (so this is based on a day's use).<br /><br />The audio quality this headset gives off is awesome...the bass is a little \\"Ehh..\\" when the volume is turned up too high though...but can be set fairly loud without bass distortion.<br /><br />The durability seems pretty good...again...a day's use...which means they really haven't come off my head all that much.  heh heh...but this is a solid headset no doubt.  I can't see them breaking just by an accidental drop or something (from the average person's height of course...not some crazy test drop).<br /><br />The headset is totally comfortable...no joke.  I love headsets that cover the ears, and that's just what this headset does... I used to have a headset where the ears are pushed down by the cushion...which just got irritating after a while.<br /><br />The look of this headset is just awesome...I love the design.<br /><br />This headset has an adjustable headband...meaning you can adjust the size of it...nothing new.  My head is fairly small, so I use a size 2 out of the possible 16....  I am pleased to say that even though I have a small head, the headset fits nice a snug....doesn't have a \\"loose\\" feeling.  I know they won't slip/fall off by turning my head fast. (I've had this problem in the past with another headset)<br /><br />I love the mute options the mic has.  You can simply lift the mic to mute, or press a button on the side to mute.  But one of the most \\"geeky\\" and awesome features of the mute function is that when the mic is muted, you get this easy red light at the end of the mic...signifying that you are muted.  This is great if you are using skype lets say...and your wife, mom, sibling or friend starts talking to you....just press a button on the side of the headset...and you can confirm the \\"mute\\" was successful with the red glow.  The glow is just the perfect tint as well...not super irritating to the eye or anything...just enough to let you know what'sgoing on.<br /><br />The Volume scroll is awesome...it has a nice feel to it while scrolling.<br /><br />Now...the G-Keys...they are not fully customizable...you get a few programs to use them with...so it's not like you can program some crazy game commands.  But hey,they are there,its a nice feature.<br /><br />Very happy with my purchase.
B0051QIGP4|5.0|I bought it yesterday, saved it to the free Cloud here and downloaded it to iTunes today. Almost flawless! The only issue that I had was with the songs that had non-standard characters in the titles. I renamed them when I downloaded them to something a little less exotic, and iTunes uploaded them with no issue.  I'm a happy little monster!!!
B004LL1HM4|1.0|I cannot understand what all the fuss is about.  This collection of songs is mostly pointless drivel, sung by a guy with a mildly annoying voice.  Destined for remainder bins and elevators.
0316098337|5.0|I just happened upon this book as I was perusing the local Target...read the first page and immediately purchased it. I could barely put it down. Room is one of the most engaging and entertaining reads I've experienced since my last Stephen King novel, \\"Under The Dome\\". You'll immediately fall in love with 5-year-old Jack whose only world is Room...the 11x11 space in which he and Ma have been isolated since his birth and a total of 7 years for Ma. The voice of Jack is innocent and exquisitely naive in the all of the expected places, but wise and mature in places where one least expects it. As the story unfolds, you quickly realize how dangerous their situation is and how much of the danger little Jack is completely unaware of. The story is told in 3 parts and the middle portion will keep you precariously perched on the edge of your chair. Donoghugh does a magical job of bringing the characters to life and, despite the medium of the written word, you quickly become completely immersed in the lives of these two extraordinary people. I cannot praise this book enough. Highly recommend, 5 Easy Stars!
B003L20ICE|3.0|The Kids Are All Right, starring Julianne Moore (Jules) and Annette Bening (Nic), follows a married lesbian couple who are raising two children, Laser (Josh Hutcherson) and Joni (Mia Wasikowska).  The kids enjoy a normal everyday life - well, normal for upper middle class white America - despite the fact that they have two moms (and despite the fact that one of them is named Laser).<br /><br />I say this because if you were to insert a dad in one of their steads, the first act of this film would become incredibly boring.  So, while it's refreshing to see a two-mom household depicted like that of any other, and while I wanted to applaud this film for showing that children of said union do grow up to be &#34;normal,&#34; the fact that the beginning of the story is underwhelming offers a subtle nod to the situation, which is the same as dragging it into the spotlight.<br /><br />We are shown potential romantic interests for each of the couple's children, both of whom are of the opposite sex to drive home the point that you don't choose with whom you fall in love, an idea that becomes confusingly crucial to the plot later on.  As for their parents, Nic fulfills the &#34;fatherly&#34; role in that she is the stricter of the two and the bread-winner of the family.  Jules is her motherly compliment, reigning Nic in when she becomes irrational. Nic is the parent you would not want to meet at the front door if you blew your curfew. Jules is the parent who would wipe your tears afterwards.<br /><br />As is to be expected, Laser and Joni throw their nothing-wrong-with-it home life into an upheaval when they decide to meet their biological father, Paul (Mark Ruffalo), the sperm donor by whom Jules and Nic were both impregnated in order to birth each of the couple's children. Joni takes instantly to Paul, while Laser is apprehensive (of course, else we would have no movie). When the kids inform their parents that they have established contact with Paul, the ladies invite him over for dinner in an attempt to get to know him.<br /><br />Over the course of the meal, cute conversation is made, like how Jules and Nic first met. Paul makes the girls an offer to help landscape their backyard, and Jules accepts - a decision that we know will come with its own set of consequences during the second act that will probably be resolved in the third.<br /><br />Paul is, of course, a complete contrast to Nic and Jules: he's a bohemian who grows his own vegetables and rides a motorcycle. He participates in the kinds of activities that a teenager would think are cool and ends up becoming &#34;the coolest parent&#34; (cue tension). Through him, Joni finds her sense of independence, while Laser is resistant to Paul's charms (yawn).  Laser instead spends most of his time with loser friend Clay (Eddie Hassell), whose pastimes include skateboarding off of roofs and peeing on dog's heads.  Kind of textbook, really.<br /><br />The interruption that is Paul challenges the strength of the union between Jules and Nic. While Paul may end up getting the short end of the stick in the end, this isn't his story.  His existence here serves as nothing more than a catalyst to help the family see the bigger picture and appreciate the love they have had all along.get to know him.

B0002VFXFE|5.0|Small amount but excellent product. I used this thermal paste in between my old Dell laptop hit sink and processor. It definitely keeps the temperature cool. I highly recommend this product. The shipping is fast too.
B004XWLI4I|3.0|I wanted to watch this because the trailers actually made it look really good.  It looked creepy!  Plus, some of my favorite actresses are in this. I wasn't going into it with high expectations given the fact that a lot of people gave this bad reviews. For movies of this genre, I lower my standards. Unfortunately, I should have listened. This was pretty much as bad as described. It was a total rip off of Single White Female, only a lot cheesier. There were a couple of moments that could have been creepy, but something was just a little off. Either it was the acting, or casting, or dialogue... Something made the whole thing just not believeable. I felt like the characters didn't behave very logically. It was hard to believe someone so psychotic would be running around campus. I have had my share of bad roommate experiences in college, but this was just too exagerated. The main character should have paid more attention once the first red flag was waved. I feel like this could have been really good, if they had tried harder.  Instead, I found myself finding a hard time paying attention to the whole thing.  I'm still giving it 3 stars though because I like the actresses Minka Kelly and Leighton Meester.
B0051T47NQ|4.0|I saw this movie a couple weeks ago and loved it. I was expecting a low budget film with puppets or bad CGI, but i was pleasantly suprised.
B004HO6HWA|4.0|I saw this in the theatre.  Amazon has pretty good streaming quality for its videos. I've never had a problem.<br /><br />This is a very suspend your disbelief type of action movie. There's a lot of violence, macho-man-ness, and blow 'em up fighting. For an action film, I found it very cleverly done. There were deeper thought moments.  The acting was pretty good. It had interesting character interactions. Many of the actors faces I recognized. The plot even ended up having a little twist. I enjoyed this as an action piece. I have never seen the original, but I can compare this to other films of the same genre in theatres today. I would say this is better than most in theatres now.
B001UV4XHY|4.0|Although you know there is one more movie coming, you just don't want this one to end.  Brilliant cliffhanger to make you crave the next installment.
B0040JHF28|5.0|Her playfulness, her ease, her joyfully purled high notes, her melodious allure and the coy sparkle: Whether in opera or concert, Diana Damrau is a perfect joy to experience... capable of making believers out of doubters and turning hackneyed roles into three dimensional, intriguing characters. If you haven't the opportunity to hear Mme. Damrau live, the proof is in her latest pudding... err: CD release on Virgin Classics. Strauss' finest orchestral songs, recorded with the best Strauss-team available at the time: Christian Thielemann and the Munich Philharmonic, an orchestra capable of world class performances if (and only if) prodded in the right ways. The loving, caring sensitivity of Thielemann's support (! - no orchestral ego here at all) is oozing through the music everywhere; he accompanies in the best sense: eager to let Damrau and Strauss shine in the best possible light.<br /><br />Sixteen of the 22 songs on this disc were recorded live at a concert at the Munich Philharmonic Hall that I happened to catch (reviewed in a column for WETA [...]). The rest was recorded later (the liner notes won't tell and the sound doesn't give it away) to give the CD a more generous play time and help a few more Strauss gems to this luxuriant treatment. As predicted immediately after the concert: the resultant disc goes immediately to my Want-List; as it would have to do for everyone who likes Strauss.
0425241505|4.0|This is a first installment. I was hesitant even though it had a quote from J.R. Ward on it. I feel like she steered me wrong with Dianne Duvall. Usually first books have pacing problems and can be difficult to read. This was paced beautifully. Just enough background information to help the reader along without getting stuck. The characters were fun and interesting.  I also liked that there was a definite sense of humor. So many paranormal books are missing that. Katie MacAlister does some but it's more cheesy and annoying. I would have liked a little more from the hero's POV. Usually when that happens the corollary is that I also wanted less from the other main character. But Pia is such a great character that I definitely didn't want less of her. The secondary characters are entertaining. I definitely want to read the next one.
0345529057|5.0|The main problem with this series of books has been puting them down to go to work, feed the family and do house work!!  They are well writen and get you involved with the characters - it has been a while since I have been so involved with a  series of books. I would recomend them to anyone who is a fan of this genre.
0596805888|5.0|This book was a gift to my techie daughter.  It is a little heavier than Alton Brown's books, and a bit less glamorous, but very entertaining, especially for those of us who enjoy learning WHY something happens the way it does in the kitchen.      Fortunately, there were a few weeks between the time this book arrived at my home and the time my college-aged geeky cook arrived home from school, so I had a chance to read a few pages.   I think it was very interesting myself and may just purchase another copy for myself!
B00328G4V6|3.0|I have to give the HENDRIX estate much props for this solid release! The sound quality is very good and the choices of most of these songs are also top shelf. Some of the other things that I think are really solid about this album are the artwork and photos,the inside of the album being Jimi's original work. There is also a lot of info on these recordings as well as some great pics that even I as a serious Hendrix aficionado have never seen. Now, getting to the music. I think that some of these songs are some of his best recordings. The album focuses on songs that were recorded mostly in the winter and spring of 1969, when the: JIMI HENDRIX EXPERIENCE, were going thru a difficult time. Although a lot of these songs have been played before, most if not all of the songs have been released here for the first time. It's amazing how this genius of a musician and composer can play these songs so differently. The first song; \\"STONE FREE\\" is played with a much funkier groove,\\"BLEEDING HEART\\" is also played with much more bottom,and brings a tear to my eyes because it's some serious Blues.\\"HEAR MY TRAIN A COMIN'\\" and \\"RED HOUSE\\", are some the best Blues you will find anywhere. There is also a smokin' set of the song; \\"FIRE\\" that is one his best renditions ever! The guitar solo's on that track are so damn nasty! But my favorite track on this  compilation is the never released song called; \\"SHIPS PASSING THROUGH THE NIGHT\\" which I think is worth the price of this album alone! It is;\\"THE FUNKIEST JHE TRACK I HAVE EVER HEARD\\"! Jimi's singing is very soulful,and his guitar playing on that track is; psychedelic,rockin',fluid,and just stanky as hell! Mitch Mitchell's drumming is; tight,on time,and he always keeps the beats in the pocket,while Noel Redding's Bass guitar is constantly groovin'(That cat doesn't get the props he deserves for being one of the greatest bass players in the history of rock music). The synchronization of this band on that track is stupendous! I'm not talking about BAND OF GYPSY's level of: \\"FUNKATIVITY\\", but it is a brilliant song, and some serious nasty Funk-rock! Anyone, that would claim that this is not a good HENDRIX compilation must not be a fan! The only reason why I did not give this album four or five stars, is because it's not nearly as good as the original HENDRIX albums that were released in his lifetime. Check this album out, it's great for even first time HENDRIX fans! PEACE OUT
B004UUKDNA|4.0|Foster the People has created a high-energy album just screaming summer. With their hit breakout \\"Pumped Up Kicks\\" released prior to \\"Torches\\", this band was destined for success. The album introduces wonderfully catchy tunes and a voice unique to Mark Foster.    1. \\"Helena Beat\\"-(8/10) With a catchy chorus and tune that stays stuck in your head for days, \\"Helena Beat\\" is a nice reflection of Foster the People's work. Although the intro is a tad too long and the chorus is the better part of the song, \\"Helena Beat\\" still hits a high note.    2. \\"Pumped Up Kicks\\"-(9/10) Perhaps Foster the People's main hit, \\"Pumped Up Kicks\\" incorporates a dark story of a socially unfit boy with an upbeat, catchy tune. The playfulness of the song, with the whistling and summer feel, introduces the world to Foster the People and their unique sound.    3. \\"Call It What You Want\\"-(7/10) One of their not-so-successful songs, \\"Call It What You Want\\" sounds quite repetitive. With an extended intro and a chorus that never seems to end, the song does not impress.    4. \\"Don't Stop (Color On The Walls)\\"-(8/10) \\"Don't Stop\\" sounds as if it belongs in a commercial. This does not necessarily have to be bad, it just depends on the listener. The song does have a beat that makes one want to get up and dance.    5. \\"Waste\\"-(9/10) One of Foster the People's less upbeat songs, \\"Waste\\" is a nice change-up from \\"Pumped Up Kicks\\" and \\"Call It What You Want\\". The band's sound meshes so well on \\"Waste\\", it is hard not to like.    6. \\"I Would Do Anything For You\\"-(9/10) A more chill version of Foster the People, \\"I Would Do Anything For You\\" seems to tell a narrative with its flowing tune and meaningful lyrics.    7. \\"Houdini\\"-(9/10) \\"Houdini\\" comes in second to \\"Pumped Up Kicks\\", with its interesting change in chorus from the other songs.     8. \\"Life On The Nickel\\"-(7/10) Perhaps the least awe-inspiring song on the album, \\"Life On The Nickel\\" simply makes no sense. A jumble of random sayings and instruments, the song has a sound that just does not sound right.    9. \\"Miss You\\"-(9/10) A song titles \\"Miss You\\" would seem to include syrupy melodies and a slow tempo. Foster the People takes a new approach to the sad \\"I need you back\\" song. With a poppy sound and Mark Foster's voice, the song impresses.    10. \\"Warrant\\"-(8/10) A nice end to an amazing album, \\"Warrant\\" closes \\"Torches\\" with a chill feel that still stays true to what Foster the People is all about.
B000EOUSJU|4.0|Mott's last studio album was made with a new lineup as founding member Mick Ralphs had departed for Bad Company in late 1973. Ariel Bender replaced him but Ian Hunter was left to his own devices and as a result `The Hoople' isn't as good as `Dudes' or `Mott'. That's just my opinion but it seemed that the band was missing the chemistry that was the Ralphs/Hunter partnership (as well as Verden Allen as well who also left during the making of `Mott'). Ralphs does make contributions to the current LP as pre-release single \\"Roll Away the Stone\\" features his striding rhythm guitar (it was a `Mott' left over) while Bender's lead was overdubbed onto it. \\"Stone\\" is probably my favorite song on the record along with nostalgia tribute \\"Golden Age of Rock n'Roll\\" which served as the opener. \\"Marionette\\" is `The Hoople''s showpiece and is very much another side of the theme Hunter explored in the `Ballad of Mott' about the pain and frustration that show business can bring along with the glory. Good record, solid way to end the Mott story but ultimately unsatisfying for me as the prior two records were better.
B0051QIGP4|1.0|Only by coincidence while checking upon another product on Amazon, a garbage disposal unit, I stumbled upon an ad for Lady Gaga.  Having heard some buzz in the media and out of sheer curiosity I decided to listen to sample cuts of her albums.  To give this some justice I must admit that I am a white male in his late 50s having grown up in the 60s era of pop music.  I was astounded by how this electronic mumbo-jumbo of repetitive disco rhythms created by a synthesizer with a 2nd rate female vocal sounding more like an unrefined Madonna in an echo chamber somehow can be passed as artistic expression.  Meanwhile young people who are attracted to current pop culture are being fed and encouraged to swallow this foul 2nd rate product.
B004R0WKNE|4.0|To some it may be predictable, but to me it was refreshing, in genuine, subtle, sweet way. McAdams brought an earnest joy to the character, in a time where realism is sometimes over done in cinema, this was a fun, amusing treat, with a cute soundtrack that left me wanting more!
B000K1P66W|5.0|This is one of the best books I have ever read. It changed my life totally, in the best way. I bought each of my children a copy and talk to all of my clients about it.  I wish the whole world would read it.
0920236162|3.0|I love the idea of a strong female character - especially given when this was initially published.  It kind of turns the classic \\"damsel in distress\\" on its head, where the princess saves the prince.  I also liked that the princess had to out-smart the dragon - she succeeded by using her brain.  That's what I liked....    But, I think I would have liked this a lot better had it only been about the dragon, or only been about the relationship with the prince - but I didn't like them both together because one seemed to undermine the other.  (without giving away the end I can't really explain - but it's kind of a \\"if the princess is so smart, then how come...\\")  I also thought it was kind of bad that in her attempt to outsmart the dragon, she egged him to destroy 100 forests.  Now, I know this is a fantasy, but still - obviously this was written during the women's lib age, but pre the \\"go green\\" age ;-)  Either way though, it seemed a little selfish of the princess.  And, the only thing that didn't burn up was a paper bag...  I'm sure it was supposed to be funny, but.. . for me, it was more annoying.    The illustrations are fun!  Though I wasn't overly impressed with the story telling.    I've friends love this book, and I've enjoyed other Munsch work, but this one just fell flat for me.
B00005JMYI|1.0|Greetings,  My beef is with the scene where Jack Black kicks a dog off of a bridge, and this is supposed to be humorous.  Frankly, this is extremely disturbing to me as an animal lover.  Perhaps the only thing I hate more than seeing an animal struck (whether real or not) is to see it made into a joke.
B003VS0CX8|5.0|Very excited to have this classic in our Blu-ray collection.  Amazon had a great price and now the hills are alive around here!!
0811874192|5.0|I purchased several copies of this book  to give as a gift to family and clients. The recipients have been glowing in their comments and appreciation of such a beautiful and unique gift. Ray Marshall's previous children's pop up book  - the clever and witty \\"The Castaway Pirates\\" - is a favorite in our son's library, so we were excited when we heard that he was working on an \\"adult\\" pop up book.  That project, Paper Blossoms, was worth the wait.  Marshall once again proves that he is one of those rare human beings who is endowed with incredible artistic talent as well as capable of technical wizardry.  I can't wait to see what he comes up with next!
B0041T52S6|4.0|I'd never heard of this movie or the book that it was apparently based on, but watched it last night.  This movies is a weirdly appealing mishmash of twenty-something angst, a comic book plot, videogame fight sequences and hard-driving punk rock.  It's also one of the funniest movies I've ever seen with a huge number of laugh out loud sequences and dialog, example:    Scott, picking up a guitar:  \\"I wrote a song about you.\\"  (plays a tender, haunting song mostly repeating the name Ramona)  Ramona, after song ends:  \\"That was nice, let me know when you've finished it.\\"  Shot of Scott looking perplexed.    Ramona:  \\"Back then I was bi-curious.\\"  Female Evil-ex:  \\"Now I'm BI-FURIOUS!\\"    I'm not going to get into the plot of the movie, which is mostly irrelevant anyway.  This film is just an escapist roller coaster.  Forget about anything making sense and enjoy the ride.  It's a blast.
B000002I2G|5.0|In my view, the title track itself justifies my \\"five star\\" rating.  It's a well produced, well written, highly detailed track that continued to build in intensity.  The second half the album (known as \\"side 2\\" for those who remember vinyl) gels better than side 1.    The bottom line is that this album is a \\"must\\" for any Doors fan.  Listen through a decent stereo (or even a high quality pair of earbuds) and you'll discover a whole new appreciation for this release.
B0042MEQVG|2.0|I suppose I was naïve to think that this third installment of the Twilight cultural phenomenon would be any better or more interesting than the first two \\"films\\" in the series. To be honest, I watched this (and read the first three books) out of a sense of pop culture obligation--I do need to stay abreast of the popular trends in YA literature and culture. Sometimes that obligation is enjoyable and rewarding (e.g., the Harry Potter novels and films), and sometimes that obligation is an excruciating act of penance (e.g., any and all things Twilight). What can I say to express the profound artistic void that this film represents? That the acting is wooden and hammy? That the story is about as interesting as watching bread mold? That the script is amateurish and insipid? That the film looks as if it were shot in a teenager's basement and backyard? That the special effects are, in effect, anything but special? That the only thing worth looking at in this entire film is Taylor Lautner's bare torso? I shudder to think that the final installment of this series will be divided into two films. Please, have mercy and end this entire Twilight fiasco already.
B002RHGYOA|4.0|In this book you won't only find mysteries and involving stories but there is enough space for many elements of the police procedures and surprisingly the Fermat's last theorem and  old Swedish stereotype telling that Sweden is a sexually promiscuous place in other words the feminine universe is heavily denigrated by an homophobic society.<br /><br />The antithesis of this masculine's philosophy is Lisbeth Salander, Mia Johansson and (surprisingly) a man called Dag Svensson (in my opinion the voice of the author of this trilogy)<br /><br />The most complex character is obviously Lisbeth Salander as we know, she's been officially declared incompetent but in reality she is a brilliant researcher and also, she is able to absorb a continuous and subtle degree of pain.<br /><br />Nevertheless she won't use her hate against the society but on contrary she will fight against the rapes and every king of abuse against women where (in my opinion) the main symbol is Nils Bjurman's tattoo.<br /><br />Cheers<br /><br />Italo
B0042X9L6A|4.0|Nice features on a lower level flash, compared to the SB900, which I do not own. Controls are much more accessable than on my SB800 and SB80. Output is more than adequate when paired with my D7000 because of the higher iso capabilities of that body, as well as my D300. So far, exposures appear to be consistant. The release on the head is a little stiff to allow bounce and swivel, so I hope that will loosen somewhat with use. I do like that there is only one release to do both and that you can swivel 180 degrees either direction from straight on position. Comes with a more secure soft diffuser than previous models, as well as tungsten and fluorescent filters. For the money, I would have liked to see more of a colored filter set included, like the SB800. Of course, the Nikon Creative Lighting System compatability is a big plus. Also included is a nice rectangular case to store everything, including a provided stand, although I don't use it, since eveything goes in my bag. Overall, a really nice flash for most lighting situations. Would like to see Nikon (and the other major makers) bring their prices down a little so freelancers don't have to surrender body parts to buy equipment needed to stay competitive, especially since this particular flash is made in China. Having said that, it does appear to be relatively solid in construction. Time will tell how well it holds up.
B004KV92ZE|5.0|Original blu-ray plus a DVD copy. A good deal! Movie itself is excellent on Audio and video quality. Can't wait to preorder Kung fu Panda 2 Blu-ray.
0316056863|5.0|This book is hilarious! Sometimes while reading it, I laugh so hard that I cry! It would be a great gift for yourself or a friend. In fact, I promised a friend to give it to her when I'm finished reading it and she is looking forward to it. However, now I'm not so sure I want to let it go. It's filled with cleverly told stories and funny pictures from the extremely talented Tina Fey's life, told with her trademark self-deprecating humor (as in her tv show \\"30 Rock.\\") It's the funniest book I have ever read.
B004498KPU|5.0|Was very disappointed with previous greatest hits collections on DVD of Jackson's film clips such as Number Ones which never mentioned anywhere on the cover that their tracks were shorter edited versions of the clip you saw on MTV and other music TV shows when they first aired.  Whilst there are still a few big Jackson songs missing from this, especially if you're including the Jacskon Five era, the really big success wise songs and film clips are on here in all their glory.<br /><br />There's a lot of great intros to the songs which are interesting to see.  Granted on repeated viewings you may skip (fast forward) through some of them such as Bad where Michael travels on a few trains from university to whichever slum suburb in New York his character lives in, but they are interesting to watch. Maybe they could have made the intro and where the song begins as separate tracks, which you wouldn't notice if watching but if you chose later to just want to have playing from when the music began you could have picked that option on the menu.  I liked how Smooth Criminal gives the extended version where Michael shoots a lot of people (although you can still get a longer one if you're including the whole Moonraker movie).  I like how this collection hasn't edited the clips to make them family friendly or avoid the backlash of the moral extremists, and that we still have the smashing up the car, turning into a panther realising quite a while after transformation back to human that his fly is down scene at the end of Black of White.<br /><br />The collection is divided into three DVDs.  Granted you are probably going to spend most of your repeat watching time on the first one where, Thriller, Bad, Man in the Mirror, Smooth Criminal, Dirty Diana and the other first half of his career songs when he was at the top of his fame and talent.  It also includes the Leave Me Alone film clip where Jackson made fun of the tabloids as well as Liberian girl which, although not a good song is interesting to watch with others where you guess the celebrity when they were younger, as the premises of the video is that Jackson has brought along heaps of 80s TV and movie stars to the set where they did not know about the others and they are all wondering why they are there.  They are pretty much just making fun of themselves.  I wrongly assumed one guy was Lionel Richie, all their names are given at the end in I guess a thank you for participating inclusion, so it's a fun game to play.<br /><br />The second DVD is the 90s onwards era, like me you may even be unfamiliar with some of these clips such as Ghost, an average song but interesting film clip where Michael rips of his skin and dances around a mansion as a skeleton in a milder less blood wise similar sort of thing to which Robbie Williams did in one of his own song's videos.  There's an interesting video with Chris Tucker for the Song You Rock My World where a lot of the lines from 80s songs such as Bad are used by Tucker and other characters in another dance fight type scenario where Jackson and Tucker are trying to get with a really sweaty woman in a skimpy black dress.<br /><br />There's also a third (called Bonus) DVD with three Jacksons songs, Blame it one the Boogie, Enjoy Yourself and Can You Feel It.  I'd never even heard of a song called Say Say Say, but it's a very listenable to song with a good film clip where a young Paul and Linda McCartney, and Michael operate a snake oils men type scam/entertainment company called Mack and Jack.  The trio along with a muscleman con locals, visit an orphanage and do a magic/clown show sort of performance at a tavern with the police in pursuit. It's a lot of fun to watch and looks like it was to make as well.  A better film than on the second DVD for They Don't Care About Us (called Prison Version although there's only a few prison scenes) is also on this disc.  There's also a previously unreleased track called One More Chance but it's nothing special.g to watch with others where you guess the celebrity when they were younger, as the premises of the video is that Jackson has brought along heaps of 80s TV and movie stars to the set where they did not know about the others and they are all wondering why they are there.

B002R88G5E|1.0|Contains spoilers.<br /><br />The first few chapters were really good.  Some good dialogues, the sharp contrast between Nana and Jalil, the kid Mariam's innocence, her want to learn things, etc.  It was all good, until Mariam is forced to marry.  The kid who haven't seen anything beyond her tiny village, the kid who didn't dare to come out of her room in Jalil's house to face anyone, gives a big-girl speech to her father.  She starts \\"I used to worship you\\".  If that wasn't unnatural enough, she goes on to say that Jalil was ashamed of her.  She isn't saying that he made her feel ashamed -- which is what the narration leads you to believe, but that Jalil was ashamed of her and that's what hurts her; not her own shame.  She says \\"Don't come to see me ever again.  Ever,\\" and leaves.<br /><br />Then the story of her marriage.  The kid who gave such a bold speech goes on to the street and guess what?  She's scared of everyone on the street.  Like, really?  What for?  First day she gets scared and runs back in.  That's okay, maybe that's normal.  But after that she never goes out.  All the women who were curious to talk to her make no further attempts to befriend her and she simply remains friendless.  Even as a kid she had about half a dozen friends in her tiny village, but as a housewife who spends all day alone at home she gets no new friends.<br /><br />And the marriage.  It keeps getting worse over time.  The author does capture the way the relationship deteriorates, but making it look like there were no good moments whatsoever is just not natural.  I mean, how can a guy be always angry with his wife?  Won't he act like a good guy now and then, at least to sleep with her?!  Would he always come home in a bad mood after work?<br /><br />I was irritated by all these oddities and decided to stop reading after reading the first 24%.
0307408833|1.0|so i'm on board with most of the 1 star reviews here. i'm an experienced baker and i hate this book. i'm so glad it was a gift and i didn't buy it myself. i bake with coconut oil regularly and i have agave on hand at any given time. i also bake with bob's red mill gf baking mix and like it a lot. this book seems like it was thrown together without any testing. i made the red velvet cupcakes - following the recipe to a T - and i ended up with expensive red velvet hockey pucks. i highly recommend cybele pascal's allergen-free baker's handbook. for frosting, i love vegan cupcakes take over the world (which includes 2 gf recipes) by isa chandra moskowitz & terry hope romero.
B004EPZ06Q|5.0|\\"The Hangover Part II\\" is great! This is how the story goes: Phil, Stu, Alan and Doug travel to exotic Thailand for Stu's wedding. After the unforgettable bachelor party in Las Vegas, Stu is taking no chances and has opted for a safe, subdued pre-wedding brunch. However, things don't always go as planned. What happens in Vegas may stay in Vegas, but what happens in Bangkok can't even be imagined.    The cast led by Bradley Cooper (as Phil), Ed Helms (as Stu), Zach Galifianakis (as Alan), Ken Jeong (as Mr. Chow) & Justin Bartha (as Doug) is great. The directing by Todd Phillips (who also produced) is great. The story & screenplay by Phillips, Craig Mazin & Scot Armstrong is great.    The music by Christophe Beck is great. The cinematography by Lawrence Sher is great. The film editing by Debra Neil-Fisher & Michael L. Sale is great. The casting by Justine Baddeley & Kim Davis-Wagner is great. The production design by Bill Brzeski is great. The art direction by Desma Murphy & Philip Toolin is great. The set decoration by Danielle Berman is great. The costume design by Louise Mingenbach is great.    This is a great sequel that is funny and entertaining, just as its original was. This is just as great as its original, as well. This is one of the best movies of the summer season, so far, by far.
0205313426|5.0|I was introduced to it in college and it was a huge help as I was drowning in textbooks. I always felt writing was too rigid with all its rules that I didn't even try, things are different now.<br /><br />It is easy to read and a quick guide.
0062515675|4.0|I bought this book after reading the charming 'Serendipity's Secret' which also uses the fable format to good effect. I thought 'The Monk...' had some great ideas and I enjoyed reading it. Just like Serendipity's Secret, I loved the idea of a 'coach' and a 'coachee' as the central characters and the useful summaries at the end of each chapter were effective.     Yes, some of it is a little cheesy and the dialogue a bit stilted at times, but this made it no less of a compulsive read which I looked forward to getting stuck into each day. I loved the use of Yogi Rahman's fable to summarise the ideas in the book, which I now refer to daily to remind me to put the book's teaching into practice. Overall, an enjoyable and practical read.
030746363X|5.0|So far I lost 14lbs and my overall health is better. Before trying this diet though I did go to a doctor and got full blood work done.<br /><br />Most of the book is for men but I read it anyway as I love to read about self experimentation. I think overall its a great resource for people wanting to lose weight.
0061122416|3.0|I bought this book after someone compared its fable style to the wonderful 'Serendipity's Secret', a book I absolutely loved. Both books tell the story of a journey of self-discovery where the message is all about going after your dreams, listening to your heart and not giving in to your fears. However, whereas 'Serendipity's Secret' is full of practical suggestions about how you can achieve this, the Alchemist left me with a sense of 'So, now what?' at the end of it.     Yes, it is certainly an inpiring read and on the whole,I did enjoy it. However I found it got slightly 'wierd' towards the end, especially when Santiago starts talking to the wind and sand etc. I also couldn't really bond with, care about or root for Santiago in the same way I could for Serendipity, the heroine in 'Serendipity's Secret'. I suppose I like my books to not only inspire but aso give me practical solutions to improve my life so maybe this book was never going to blow me away. I think it's great that so many people love it and I really wish I was one of them. I would, however, recommend it to anyone who needs some inspiration in their life and believe most will feel better for reading it.
B003UESJ9M|2.0|'Country Strong' received massive amounts of hype, with a lengthy trailer for the film being played prior to what felt like 90% of the movies in theaters a few months prior to its opening. Gwenyth Paltrow did extensive promotion, as she had the lead role. This led to a surprisingly pleasant performance on the television show 'Glee', and then the movie arrived.    It must first be understood that this movie is nearly two hours long, and suffers deeply from the sometimes tiring scenes that could have been trimmed down. A drama like this needs to keep a high-octane level of self-deprecation, or else it begins to simply wallow in its own self-pity. This film resorted to the latter, and while there were some enjoyable moments of fine acting from Paltrow, the majority of the film was so overwrought that the ending felt almost like a blessing.    Another point that should be made is that, while the film seems to center around Paltrow, the real star is Leighton Meester's Chiles Stanton. While the previews project this character to be a conniving girl attempting to take Gwenyth's throne, she is actually a nervous rising star desperate for success but scared of how she is supposed to get there. Leighton acts the hell out of her character, drawing forth unsureness, drive, desire and fear all into single shots, giving her character a third dimension that may not have been intended in the script.    As the film goes along, it is at once relieving and disheartening that 'Country Strong' isn't the uplifting tale of a grand comeback that the previews have made it out to be. The film is often dark, and the characters have all have a realistic stubbornness to not change their behavior despite the negative results these actions result in. It's nice that the plot isn't optimistically contrived, but instead it is cynically contrived, and feels like it is pandering the audience far too often.    'Country Strong' amounts to some potentially interesting characters not given enough room toshine in a plot focused only on delivering the melodrama that it never included in its mission statement. This is quite a deceiving film; if you enjoy treacly, hopeless melodrama, this is sure to be your cup of tea. To all others: 'Blue Valentine' was recently released on DVD. I suggest that instead.
1582701709|2.0|I, like many people bought this book after hearing all the hype. I read it quite quickly and overall found it an inspiring read. However, I did find it a little repetitive at times, with the same point being made over and over again by different people, ie you will manifest what you think about. The basic message itself is a positive one and if we can all be encouraged to think more positively that can only be a good thing. The use of visualisation and focusing on the positive are all great tools to have as you are then more likely to be drawn to good things, be more in touch with your intuition and to notice opportunities. However, sometimes we might start out thinking we want something and then discover it isn't what we wanted afterall, so the ability to be open minded to adapt our goals and desires are also important.     If you want to make improvements to your life then this is a good place to start. However, to make long lasting changes, then I truly believe that more is required than just postive thinking, such as setting goals, taking action and developing resilience. If you want a book that helps you achieve all this, then I would recommend adding a little Serendipity to your Secret and read 'Serendipity's Secret' as well.
B002F6FQGK|4.0|Overseas act Florence + The Machine truly hit it big following an outstanding performance of 'The Dog Days Are Over' on the VMA's. It was the best of the night, and iTunes downloads of the single surged accordingly. 'Dog Days' has a plinking introduction that bursts into a rooftop shouting chorus, stomping beats making up the backbone of the lyrics.<br /><br />Surprisingly, 'The Dog Days Are Over' is one of the weaker tracks on 'Lungs'. It's difficult to comment on specific songs, due to the overarching togetherness that the album has, but there are definite standouts with not a weak track to be heard. The whole album has a very grand persona that permeates everything about it, with Florence singing her heart out on the majority of these tracks. When she isn't doing that, she is injecting the songs with a mischievous tone or singing over a beat as though she has all day to get the track recorded. All of these things add up to a fully formed persona for Florence as an artist, something that rarely happens on a debut album.<br /><br />Highlights of the album include 'Howl', a roaring anthem of a song, 'Girl With One Eye', a tension-laden girl fight, and 'Blinding', an explosive track that has a killer chorus. The very centerpiece of the album, however, is 'Cosmic Love', the musical equivalent of the the first Fourth of July. The beats pound with an urgency that is only exemplified by Florence's impassioned delivery, which all adds up to an epic single that could hold weight a decade from now.<br /><br />Most artists set out to create a foundation for their style with their first album. Florence has managed to burst onto the scene as a full-fledged artist with only one album. Combining alternative, indie, opera, rock, and pop into one distinct sound, Florence + The Machine has harnessed a sound all her own.
0783240236|1.0|I hate this Movie, because where I'm concerned, this is Extreamly to Spokey / Scarry to be watching.  But if your the type of person who Craves / Loves Scarry Films, then and only then is this Movie for you.  If your like me where you Don't like them, then all I can say is DON'T watch it, it could give you Nightmares if your NOT Carefull!
B004A8ZX28|3.0|Very simple really. If you've seen \\"Total Recall\\" with Arnold Schwarzenegger then you've seen this film. Change it from Science fiction to action, change the setting from Mars to Berlin and replace Sharon Stone with January Jones and it's the same thing. Liam Neeson is obviously no \\"Ahh-nold\\" when it comes to the body but he's a much better actor which gives this film a much needed boost.<br /><br />**********Spoilers**********<br /><br />Why did I give it 3 stars? Because it kept me guessing until just the same spot that \\"Total Recall\\" did. When he finds out that he's not really who he thinks he is, you pretty much know where it's going to go from there IF YOU'VE SEEN THAT FILM. I found myself fast forwarding just a little bit at a time and nodding to myself. It was still entertaining.
B001KX50BK|5.0|I love this Movie, it's really good aong with the Music.  Beside's, it has a GIRL in it, HUBBA HUBBA, O LA LA, O LA LA, O LA, O LA, O LA LA, HUBBA HUBBA O LA LA.
B004X0Y5GI|1.0|I was disappointed.  I love Stevie's voice and style, so it makes me sad that the lyrics sounded like a sixth grader wrote them.  Nothing remarkable at all.  Back to classic Fleetwood Mac.
B003IWZ1D8|5.0|This Movie I like, in my ow Opinion, I would have to say that it's filled with Adventure and Mystery, and I like that.  If your like me, then I suggest that you check it out, but if your not, then I suggest that NOT watch it.
B001NXBRJG|2.0|Don't need to review the movie itself: easily one of the best sci-fi movies of all time.    The Blu-ray transfer is what I have the gripe about. The audio mix was substandard. The dialogue was difficult to discern and the gunfire and other effects were flat. The picture quality is fine, but if you have invested even a moderate amount of money on your home theatre audio, then prepare for The Matrix to disappoint.
B00007FOMP|1.0|Being a recording musician myself, I was SO excited to get this well-reviewed album, which I had never heard despite being an \\"old timer\\". What a disappointment! It seems to me to be an uninteresting pile of mush. Crooning and strings, crooning and strings - no hooks, no beats, no dynamics, no arresting melodies, no actual SONGS. It just plays and plays and plays and plays, kind of the way my wallpaper just sits there on the wall day after day. I found myself forgetting the songs AS THEY PLAYED. I tried it twice and nothing left the slightest trace.    I read all these glowing reviews and I have to think that I have been listening to some other greatly inferior album! Either that or I'm a Philistine. I threw the thing out today.
B004RE29PO|5.0|This Blu-ray rendition is top-notch. It purposefully retains the film's grain - a decision that likely was made as opposed to smearing the image in attempting to remove it.    The audio is superb - one of the best mixes for any movie. It is clear, impactful, dynamic, and engaging. Mixed in DTS, you'll get your moneys worth out of an upper-end home theatre sound system.
B00005T30L|5.0|I loved this film.  It was well done in every sense.  You must have an appreciation for film directors who really show life the way it is, and are not afraid of meaningful pauses where they need to be.  I cannot say enough good about this film.  The only thing I would change is the ending.  It felt rushed and I was disappointed with the way it was done - even though it had to end this way, it could have been done with more style.  Excellent film, which led me to Welcome to the Dollhouse, another probably under-rated but excellent film.
B000IZ7YK6|4.0|After the 2010 fall demise of FX underrated Series Terriers. I started to read articles from creators Ted Griffin and Shawn Ryan. One of the recurring things read is that this movie was a big influence. I can tell that statement is the truth. From themes like money and power having great influence over institutions. The Underdog out of his depth facing the all powerful opportunist. I can quite see the similarities between both protagonist Jake and Hank. I am happy to experience both. I watch China town twice and also gave terriers mutiple viewings. I hope that this brand storytelling has bigger future in next couple of decades.
B004IQMXD4|5.0|Stevie Nicks is back with \\"In Your Dreams\\", and it is one of her best records in over 2 decades.  Dave Stewart brilliantly produced this, despite some calling it \\"country\\" or \\"rock-a-billy\\", after a few listens this CD is pure Stevie at her best.  What makes this record different than any of her others, here you can really get a feel from Stevie--perhaps a gift that comes with age.    Of the 13 tracks, I absolutely love:    Secret Love (the first single)  In Your Dreams  New Orleans  Moonlight----I want a dance remix of this so badly!  Does anyone know how to mix?  Annabell Lee  Italian Summer  Cheaper Than Free    Don't be surprised to have this record show up with many Grammy nominations.  It's that good.
B001UV4XHY|4.0|Harry Potter and the Deatly Hallows part 1 is an much bigger improvement over The Half Blood Prince. I went to the theatre to see THBP and was seriously bored. There were some comical moments that got a few laughs from me and the audience at least. The problem was the whole thing was almost entirely focused on romance. Only the last few minutes do they show what Voldemort's crew are up to. And it was not much unfortunately. I heard the book had much more to them on the final scene of the movie.    The Deathly Hallows Part 1 gets us back on track, where the Harry Potter series has been going. The best thing the previous Potter showed were the Horcrux's. I won't spoil what that's about, but Harry is on a quest to destroy these artifacts. Voldemort is around more this time. He has sent out his Death Eaters to infiltrate the Ministestry of Magic. Many laws are changed, especially against the muggels, the non-magic users.     Bellatrix and a few other Death Eaters play a seprate roll from the infiltrators and that's to go capture Harry Potter. Hermoime and Ron stick very close to Harry, and not just out of friendship. Alastor, Hargrid, and many others try to use themselves to shield Harry from harm. Harry openly objects to everyone doing this. He cares a lot about his friends and mentors. The Death Eaters won't rest in this one. They actively are on the hunt for Harry.     There is a big break from the constant action later on, which was needed eventually. I thought that provided good pacing in that way. At this point in the movie Harry is in hiding along with Hermoime and Ron. They help Harry on his quest to destroy the Horcrux's at the same time. The stress of the situation really does show with the three. Ron is scared and barely talks, he is on edge. He keeps listening to the radio of the take over from Voldemort. Harry gets very defensive to everyone. Hermoime is despressed, but deals with things not too badly in this nightmare scenario.      This feels like half astory, well...because it is. That's why I couldn't give this one 5 stars. This is much more improved from the previous movie. The Deathly Hallows part 1 makes a nice setup for the second one coming this year. It'll be the last of the Harry Potter's, so this one is a definite watch to complete the whole story.

B004L49K20|1.0|This album is very chart pop friendly and safe, but lacking that musicianship and songwriting that Duran had even when they were top of the charts with Rio.    A song by song analysis has been done to death in many places and this album doesn't deserve that. There's nothing here that hasn't been done and heard before. Ronson is an inexperienced media darling sensation and has contributed nothing to Duran Duran. He merely uses Duran as a vehicle to indulge in his ongoing 80s and personal childhood obsession. And Duran were seduced by his enthusiasm as they were by Timbaland's hype.    Fans of good music would do well to ignore the overwhelming number of positive reviews which are posted by Duran's core fanbase, who are more into Duran's importance and place in music and chart history for their own egoistic reasons than in Duran's quality which hasn't been seen in more than a decade.    Buy Rio, Notorious, Big Thing and the debut. Ignore this unless you love modern day chart pap and everything American idol/boyband/sitcom soundtracks and lame.
B002BU0DPE|5.0|This headset is amazing. I got it for only 50 bucks and boy it gives me the chills. You can basically hear anything around you within like 100 feet. Good for shooting games when you can hear footsteps. I don't know what hissing people are talking about. Bass is awesome, sound is awesome, mic is awesome. Buy it.
B004K4AUZW|4.0|Stefani Germanotta is a fabulously attractive and talented singer, songwriter, and musician. But Lady Gaga has turned into a walking, talking Halloween billboard for herself. I liked Gaga better when she was mysterious and somewhat a part of this universe.<br /><br />If \\"Born This Way\\" had not been so over-hyped and \\"leaking\\" out all over the internet, if the videos had not been so far behind the songs that were released, this might be a somewhat enjoyable, and maybe even surprising, collection. But nothing could have matched the advance mismarketing hoopla. And so the let-down is big.<br /><br />There are more than a few songs on this album that play happily on and on in my head. After all, she is the Queen of Hooks. However nothing really fits together. The CD cover is hideous, the material is dark and solely meant to be controversial just for the sake of being controversial. It doesn't work as a package of art at all.<br /><br />I truly do adore Gaga, but she cannot make a career out of pushing the envelope. It's dial-back time, Stefani.
B0041KKYBA|5.0|This is an excellent film and quite worthy of the awards it has won.  I watch a lot of documentaries and this is among the top five I have seen -- possibly the top three.  While it did not have the brilliant humor that one finds integrated into the Michael Moore films, there is clearly nothing funny about how the American People are continually ripped off by the wealthy and their puppet politicians.  This film exposes in great detail and technical accuracy the specific methods used to get middle and upper middle class people to invest their money in ways that will allow the wealthy to eventually, using smoke and mirror investment strategies of their own, to skim off huge amounts of \\"surplus\\" wealth and leave everyone else high and dry (or should I say under water).  Perhaps more importantly, the film shows how the wealthy use the political-economic system they have carefully cultivated to get the same people they have ripped off to bail out the companies that they used to rip off the public in the first place. Having taught about these issues for many years I know that representing this complicated process in one video is no small accomplishment. My hat is definitely off to all involved with the production of this excellent documentary.      John C. Alessio, Dean  College of Social and Behavioral Sciences  Minnesota State Mankato
B001UV4XHY|4.0|The movie itself was good but it was difficult to see everything going on because it was always extremely dark.  My son watched it on his computer and it was much better,  but we were disappointed in this.  We also would have purchased the next one when it comes out - the second part of this story - but now we are wary that it is going to turn out the same way.    Incidentally, we now live in Springfield, TN, not California.
B001DJ7PQ4|3.0|the stories themselves were quite good. but donna (the companion) sucked!!! actually sucked the life out of me every time she spoke! annoying!
B000W7JWUA|5.0|My son first played this game at camp when he was 15. He asked for it right before his crew season started, as their race days are spent with many hours of down time between heats. He also brought it to a few out of town regattas, and it was great for the team to play at night when the coaches didn't want them in the hotel pool (where they could be injured) and when they needed a quiet evening before a crucial regatta.     He taught it to me, my college age daughter and husband and we really enjoyed it. Hard to figure it out before you really start playing, but we are all now hooked!
B000003CMB|5.0|Hey Everyone:    A friend of mine is an afficinado for The Grateful Dead, and the Allman Brothers Band.  He steared me in direction to Amazon.Com, urging me to get the Live 1971 Allman Bros. Band, so I purchased it.    So I've been luxuriating in this two-desk set.  Usually, I listen a couple of times, and then let the time go by, since I get bored easily.  The more I listen to this Frisco-scene band (I had live in Frisco and in Berkely several years before they did this album, my Hippy Journey.    I think what I realized as I was listening, how versatile the band is, but the base is always Southern Blues.  I don't think you can go wrong on this one--so why not purchase it from Amazon.Com?    Peace Out,  Christopher Bear-Beam, MA, LPCI
B004KSQN7C|5.0|I always liked Britney.  She may not become the next Madonna, but she still has it in her to be a great performer.
1577314808|5.0|It's been 7 years since I've read this book.     And it's changed my life. I assure you, it will change yours.    This is not some fake gimmick like 'The Secret' is. This is true, basic, factual information on the thought process and how it influences our ego, our behavior, our lives, and most importantly, our sense of being.    If you Wiki Eckhart Tolle, you will see an amazing story of a man who's passion for seeking answers to his existence enabled him to survive while being pushed to the brink, in a vat of depression, nearly committing suicide. In an instant, he was awakened with very simple truths that positively changed his life forever.    His focusing on the 'Now' is a golden message unto all. A highly recommended book for those from all walks of life.
B004EPZ06G|2.0|Todd Phillip's 2009 comedy film The Hangover, while unoriginal in the sense of a buddy comedy gone wrong, did have its moments in the spotlight. The idea behind the film was simple, formulaic at times, yet was very good at providing a good pace for our 3 amnesiac heroes as they blindly stumble from one crazy incident to the other. I didn't get the sense that it dragged at all there was always something going and really seemed  to feel as though the writers had found somewhat of an even flow. Even when it seemed to drag it always found some outrageous allusion to popular culture such as Mike Tyson, Rain Man or other moments that the 3 leads could work with especially the character of Alan ( Galifanakis). However this was not the case with the 2011 follow-up entitled The Hangover Part II. The title just with the incorporation of the roman numerals seems to suggest a tongue-in-cheek prestige, with the promise that it could live up and dominate the first in situation comedy.               Right from the get go I felt like the actors were sort of going through the motions and more ad-libbing moments to creative \\"authentic\\" comedy rather then follow any sort of script. It struck me as though Phillip's had no clue as to how to live up to the hype that would sure to be created with the announcement of a sequel and thus half-assed the script. The plot to me didn't feel believable at all in terms of following up the first film with Stu and the gang heading for his Thai wedding. To me what appealed to me about the ending of the first one was the seemingly romantic relationship with Heather Graham's character and the baby Carlos which was pretty darn funny at points. However, much to my chagrin this was not taken advantage of most likely to avoid repeating shooting in Vegas which as all of us known had been done before. Characters such as Mr. Chow who makes his grand re appearance in the second does not have the same presence that he did in the first in terms of laugh out loudmoments. For the first half of the movie it felt strained and I found myself yawning on many an occasion as I felt as though I had seen this all before word for word. Certainly this movie at least for the majority of the film follows the same situations that the first did with very slight twists on the ideas. For the example the tiger is now a cigarette smoking monkey, the missing tooth is now a tyson-esque tattoo, the \\"misplaced buddy\\" is now a misplaced future brother in law etc. While in theory these  ideas should work as they did fine in the Vegas strip they unfortunately do not. Bangkok while alive in culture did not provide the same wild backdrop that first did almost becoming more of a sheet on a tack for a puppet show then an real comedic element/prop that the actors could work with. When the film does drag ( and does frequently) it tries to distract us with various displays of lewd, gross-out humor, that seem almost unnecessary like when someone talks really loudly when they fart so you don't hear it. Unlike the first film it felt long to me, I started marking the plot points in the film like bulletpoints on a list. We get one or two unexpected cameos to reward us for our patience but really nothing left me ultimately satisfied by the end of 102 minutes.           When the film does eventually end it is a relief as by the 75 min mark I had already seen all that I needed to be satisfied. Literally the film ends exactly the way the first one did almost word for word and quite ridiculously. In the end what could've been a decent follow up ending up being a waste of a film which to me felt like a much better films ugly rude cousin. While the jokes do break through on rare occasions, The Hangover 2 is definitely one worth skipping unless you're a die-hard fan of the original. Otherwise it might be a contender for worst sequel ever that one could almost guarantee months ago would be either hit or miss.
0446691437|5.0|I am so glad I ordered this book. It's totally changed how I think about my \\"work\\".  You never quite know how useful a 'motivational' book is going to be, but this one trumps all others, in my opinion.  It doesn't pander, and it's short and to the point. This book held many \\"lightbulb\\" moments for me.  Unlike a lot of other motivational writers who have never done a thing in their own lives except tell others \\"you can do it\\", this writer has fought the good fight and knows of what he speaks.
B001MWBK4U|4.0|When I received this BluRay, it was mailed from the US but when I opened it, the BluRay was from Canada.  The cover was even in French!  Well, I held my breath and popped it in and thank God it 1) worked (I thought regional coding might come into play) and 2) it was in English with no auto-subtitles.  When purchasing the disc, I don't remember seeing anything stating it was foreign (meaning not from the US).  If I had, I would not have purchased it for fear it wouldn't work in out player.  However, it worked, arrived on time and other than having French and English titles, was in great condition.<br />For the movie itself, I had already seen it and simply wanted to own it.  I feel it's an epic love story/tragedy set during the US Civil War that focuses on the lives of those left behind and a soldier trying to get back home.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I am not a fan of run of the mill fantasy stories but this book is hardly run of the mill.  Just as HBO chose this novel series as a TV show, it is exceptional in its presentation.  HBO has only deepened some story lines slightly, there is a lot of dialog and story lifted right from the book.  I am very impressed and will read the second installment of this terrific story.
0316066524|2.0|For well over a thousand pages, Wallace attempts to impress us with his wit and knowledge. It doesn't work. The book ends up being a pretentious and self-indulgent mess. Wallace wants to posture himself as a Joyce or a Pynchon or even a Fuentes, but falls woefully short. The characters are shallow; many sub-plots are left unresolved; and too many witticisms are purloined from other sources. If this is the new direction literature is taking, please God, let me off of this bus before it crashes and burns.
B002ZG974M|5.0|I had watched this movie alone when it first came out, but when I came across it again as I sorted through our videos, I got the idea to watch it with my nine-year-old son. He has always adored babies and he is an only so hasn't had much experience with how babies are raised. I wanted him to see the cultural differences, I wanted him to see how babies could grow up happy and healthy with almost NO material things(unlike him),and I wanted him to see that mothers all over the world love and care for their babies, albeit in different ways, and the babies thrive from that love.   My son LOVED it. I loved watching it with him. We laughed. A lot. We added our own dialogue to what the baby must be thinking at the time (WHY can't I get this STICK to stay in the CIRCLE?). AND as a bonus it led to lots of questions from my son, questions about \\"did you do that with me?\\" and \\"did I do that?\\". I also am very pro-breast feeding and had no problem with his seeing the breasts of these mothers as they fed their children.   He did go around afterward and tell his friends about the movie - especially the breastfeeding part. I may have some parents upset with me that my son made their kids come home with questions (\\"is that really what breasts are FOR?\\") but I realy don't care. I hope it opened up dialogues at other homes, to be honest.   So yes, there are lots of breasts. But my son simply accepted that this is a natural part of raising a baby and in some places it is the only option.   It was a wonderful experience for both of us. I really liked watching the babies in Mogolia and Africa, in cultures SO different from our own. I wish there would be a Babies II with 4 new babies in 4 new, exotic locale, so we can see how even more cultures raise their babies. But it brought my son and I closer, and we are keeping the movie to watch again some time in the future.
0385342055|4.0|I bought this for a summer or a vacation read.  I love the Shopaholic series so I'm looking forward to reading this book; hence the 4 stars instead of 5.
B003AYPMBU|1.0|The reason I gave a one star rating for this CD is because you can't play it on a computer. The CD is detected as a data CD which basically makes it redundant. I don't know whether it plays fine in a CD player. So I request whoever is buying this to do your research first.
0316017922|5.0|Outliers is truly one of the best books I have read over the past few years, and I read a lot of books.  Gladwell couples his fascinating evidence with his marvelous writing ability to put together stories of success that are both entertaining and strongly supportive of his thesis.  It has changed the way I think about the world.  Sometimes I will will reread a chapter just for the fun of it and to remind myself of how amazing this book is.  Don't even get a sample.  Just Buy.
B0031ESW8O|5.0|It is enough to recommend this book if only for its' style!  I have never read a book in which the characters each recount their perception of events as the plot unfolds.  It was a fasinating way to tell a mystery story!
B000AJIF4E|5.0|Had this pair for a few weeks now and they are way better sounding and comfortable than the flashy looking one they replaced. Have yet to see how well they last.
B002BSHWUU|5.0|This has been one of the greatest musical purchases I have ever made!  I strongly recommend that any Beatles fan fork out the $180 because it is wonderful.      Packaging-  Love the box (it's the perfect size; very sleek and classy).  The CD cases are awesome.  The cases are beautiful and the CD's look great as well as the booklets (which are chock full of information and photos).  Sound Quality-  Although I love vinyl and mono mixes I can't deny that the remastered stereo is delightful; very crisp and clear.  The Music Itself-  What can I say, The Beatles are the greatest band ever and to have all their albums is a true blessing!
0785151303|5.0|As a fan of \\"behind the scenes\\" movie books, this particular book is top notch! Wonderful art, concept designs and sets adorn this lavish hardback that comes in a beautiful slipcase! Of course, the text is awesome, too! I cannot wait for the Art of Cpatain America, too!
1400049628|5.0|I'll try to keep this review short & sweet.  I am a bit of a Zombie fanatic.  I really enjoyed this book.  It is what it says it is.  It explains how to properly prepare for Z-day.  It has sooo much amazing info & tips on just about every subject you could think to wonder about when it comes to Z-day!    Great book!
B004SB60OC|5.0|It's so refreshing, hearing, appreciating, a truely talented artist instead of today's overmanufactured music. Her voice so honest with emotion. Composing all types and moods with each song. From my eight year old daughter to people in their 40's, joining together as fans of Ms. Perri's music. Listening to an individual song, the more I learn and want to hear more. It flows together where you don't want to skip a track. Most importantly, pure enjoyment!
0307346617|5.0|If you have read Max Brook's- Zombie Survival Guide, you will enjoy this book.  The entire book is set up with the author interviewing different people about their experiences during World War Z.      It is very detailed and conveys emotion perfectly.  I have read thru this book twice so far, and plan to re-read it again, just for the fact that every time you read a book, you find something new that you didn't catch before.  :)
B004SBB0LU|5.0|Can you get all of these songs elsewhere? - Yes    Is this the forth time around remastering? - Depends on if imports and Japan releases count!    That being said, is the sound better than any other version? - Oh Yes!!!!    This time around they got it about as right as the master tapes are ever going to allow!!    I'm very pleased with the sound. That made it all worth the cash out lay.
B0036R92V2|4.0|First off, it's old and Italian. I did not expect the transfer to be magnificent. With that in mind the review is fairly positive. Its obvious that one can draw comparisons between Django and the Man with No Name. For me that's a plus. I love the old westerns where it stars an amoral anti-hero; not of that over goody-goody hollywood stuff. This is a much more rustic and in my opinion a more realistic portrayal of the wild west. Towns were ruled by gangs of thugs who had more guns than the towns. Django came in a reluctantly saved what was left of the town. I love the film, the look was grainy but this is a low budget Italian classic so please lower your expectations prior to watching.    Enjoy!
B0000029AP|5.0|This one remains a rock masterpiece and sadly only a few songs are played on the radio from it. In the old days real dj's would play the whole thing! Oh, well.<br />the song has lots of classics on it, 'sweet emotion', 'toys in the attic' , 'walk this way' ,  'uncle salty' and others including a ballad that's pretty good. Oh yeah , the cool 'big ten inch record' song is on here as well. The band was peaking in their first run here and on their next one, although 'draw the line' was a fine disc to be sure. This was a band running on all cylinders making intricately cool rock songs that will stand the test of time.  The early releases also clicked well but were the band leading to this one for sure.
B0016CO2HS|5.0|THANK YOU AMAZON for having the sense to offer this album/mp3s for sale.<br /><br />I know it's a long-drawn debate, \\"stereo vs mono\\" but in mono songs like \\"Paint It, Black\\" and \\"Mother's...\\" just don't have the same impact.  Same goes for the stereo version of \\"I Can't Get No(Satisfaction)\\".  If you are lucky to possess THAT in stereo you indeed have a very rich Stones collection.  Unfortunately it cannot be tied to a specific RS album or anthology, so tracking it down can be tricky.<br /><br />I'm going out and telling everyone if you want stereo versions of several classic Stones tracks - purchase Aftermath or the specific songs from Aftermath that you like, and strap on a good set of Beyers or Sennheisers - your ears will be delighted!

This is the only app I've found where I can change the bookmark icon from the &quot;red ribbon&quot; that is not useful, to any icon I want ( which I download from the web).  Icons can be changed everywhere, which makes your device look great.  Great work!!!
B004K4AUZW|5.0|Usually, it's very, very rare for me to like every single song on an artists album; it seems there are several good hits and the rest are just meh..not worth listening to.  This isn't the case for Lady Gaga and her new album Born this Way. I can listen to every single track on the CD over and over again. She really cares about her fans and puts effort into every single thing she creates. She's great, buy this album!

0316056863|4.0|I'm not the biggest fan of Fey. I liked the pilot episode of 30 Rock, I never watched her on Weekend Update, the Sarah Palin thing got on my nerves after the first 30 seconds, and honestly, I think I like her voiceover work better than anything else she's done (wait, I forgot Mean Girls). That being said, I did not expect to enjoy this book. I have been reading a lot of books by comedians and comic actors recently, the waiting list at my local library wasn't too long for this one, and I thought I'd give it a shot.   Aside from a bit of excessive self-deprecation in the first chapter (\\"you people have no reason to like me- no one ever did\\" is kind of the tone), I found Fey's writing style to be pleasantly casual. I think it's a mark of a good book that you can \\"hear\\" someone narrating the text in your head. I could imagine Fey saying each of these words out loud, which I guess means I thought the book seemed very genuine- I have read plenty of celeb biographies that were as fake as the subject's tans. Some bits of the book went on a bit long: she spent a few pages talking about her scar, or rather, a paragraph explaining vaguely where it came from and then a few pages talking about people's reactions to it. To be honest, I didn't ever notice her scar. Maybe my eyesight isn't so good- but I hope that's not the case since I'm in my early 20s! I like the way Fey talks about subjects that could come off as preachy or incendiary without being rude. She had several gay friends growing up, and basically says \\"these people should be allowed to get married already\\". Even in the chapter about her \\"impressions\\" of Sarah Palin, she seems sensitive to the fact that her celebrity status could really upset some people if she gave her honest political opinion. She said that her \\"Bitch is the new black\\" line, referring to Hilary Clinton, came from her surprise that America seemed less comfortable with the idea of a woman in the White House than a Black man (another running theme through the book is Fey's encounters with sexism in an industry usually dominated by males). When Sarah Palin was slated to appear on SNL, one of her biggest concerns would be that the audience- composed of primarily left leaning New Yorkers- would boo her. She didn't want that to happen. If she really hated this person, as some members of the media wanted us to believe at the time, wouldn't she have WANTED that to happen? Sounds like the perfect setup for cruel, comedy gold. I was pleased that even though a significant moment in her career happened because of the events of the 2008 election, Fey didn't harp on it. She wasn't nasty towards particular political sides, and that in itself is refreshing.     While I can't say I will ever read this book again, I would recommend it to others. I had a good time reading it.

B000VWE5OY|5.0|Like, the title of this review says, just...wow.  I have just finished watching the entire series and I LOVED it.  I had heard of the show before, but never gave it much thought.  I've always been a fan of the X-Files and CSI, which this show is somewhat similar to, but I just never really watched it.  I'm glad I decided to give the first episode a try...I was hooked from the start.<br /><br />What I especially love is the writing and the acting.  Eve Myles as Gwen Cooper is great.  She is probably the heart of the show.  Sure, John Barrowman is the lead character, but Eve somehow just gives the show heart.  Don't get me wrong; John is incredible in his role as Captain Jack.  I never saw the show Dr. Who, so I can't really compare him to what he was like on that show.  I think that the episode that stands out for me is \\"The Keep Killing Susie\\".  I loved the twists and turns in that episode; just when you think she (Susie) is dead...she's not and we have no idea why until the final 20 minutes or so of the episode.<br /><br />Torchwood is definitely a darker drama/action/sci-fi and every now and then humorous show.  I just hope I am able to watch the fourth season in some way.  It's going to air on a channel that I do not get and hopefully BBC America will still be able to pick it up (or it'll maybe be available on Amazon Instant Video...???).  At any rate, this is a show that I wish I had discovered when it first aired.  Thankfully it's on DVD and I am eager to watch the bonus features on the DVD.  So far I have only viewed the actual episodes, so this will definitely be a 'bonus'.
B004K4IZ54|5.0|I watched this with my 18 yr. old son, and we were both blown away by the 3d.  When we saw it in the theatre, we opted for the 2d version.  That being said, the 3d was worth the wait for the home theatre experience.  The story is entertaining, but the effects are what make this movie.  Plenty of ways to watch as well, with 4 discs provided.  I have only used the 3d disc, so can't say anything about the others.  What a fun ride!
B004EPYZUI|5.0|Okay, now you know how I feel about it so let me attempt to review. Sucker Punch is the first movie I've gone to see twice at the theater in decades. I would make it three times if it was still around since there's noting else I want to see this weekend. I realize that most critics are trashing it and apparently a lot of viewers are disappointed. I will ramble a bit but try to eventually address those reactions.    First of all, critics had their own preconceived ideas of the movie they wanted to see and they didn't get it. They persist among other things in believing it is wrong that perfectly normal people admit ambivalence fascinations concerning sex and violence directed towards women. They also believe that too much action, music and camera work mean a movie can't have any real emotional impact. Oddly at the same time these folks complain that Sucker Punch is a downer. Can it have no emotional impact and be a downer at the same time? Some have said that the movie is a mishmash mess. Some have said it feels too much like a video game. They are all wrong. They don't \\"get\\" it.    The movie fits together like clockwork. Every little thing is important. It all comes full circle. All but the first ten or fifteen and last five minutes are not real. (Guestimated times) The first section depicts the traumatic event that has created the mentally disturbed Baby Doll character. I think some critics are forgetting that she may actually belong in the institution. As a result the jarring music and camera work makes sense for the first section to depict her trauma and then the rest of the movie is not supposed to be real. It is a depiction of multiple levels of the world created in Baby Doll's mind to deal with her situation. I think it works perfectly in that regard. Do girls dressed as schoolgirls or dancers in wild fight scenarios look like a video game. No doubt. There's a reason. Baby Doll has imagined them as kept girls in a dance hall setting, but the dancing is a euphemism for sex. So when she jumps to the other level to escape that horror of the institution she leaves them in that costume in her mind. Clues in the opening section and dialogue in the last section explain how all the action scenes are euphemisms for the struggles to do the things that transpired in \\"reality.\\"    I think some viewers were disappointed that the climax wasn't a huge winning-battle fist-pump moment, but by the time the movie gets there the conclusion made perfect sense to me. Sure, part of me wants to see everyone escape and triumph and get revenge and all that. But that would be the same sort of empty lame action movie conclusion that critics generally pan. Not that I'm not a \\"sucker\\" for those sorts of endings myself, but this movie takes another approach to identifying what triumph is.    I've chatted with a couple of folks who didn't like the movie as much as I did and here's the thing. I believe Jack Snyder made the movie he wanted to make, something which movie makers don't get to do all that often. He's a geekdom enthusiast. His style is live-action comic book style. He made 300 and Watchmen for heavens sakes! What did the critics and people expect? Sucker Punch is a powerful movie with depth but comic book sensibilities as to pacing and visuals. Some of us like that! I personally don't need a lot of touchy feely meandering around to get to know the character stuff. As a comic reader a couple of frames that hit the nail on the head to explain the character are enough for me. It would ruin this movie to meander around getting charactery since the whole thing functions as a modern allegory or fairytale. Snyder keeps things moving like a good comic at all times. There is no rest for the viewer.    I think everyone, even the critics, agree that the visuals are stunning. I would point out that the girls are as well. And they all do an excellent job. I often roll my eyes at actresses in these sorts of action sequences, but never did here. Not that they're accomplished martial artists or anything like that, but Snyder understands how to make the action look good. On the flip side they are all excellent actresses which means they deliver the dramatic moments quite well.    Obviously I loved this movie. Easily movie of the year, perhaps the decade. Snyder took chances and made an original movie. I can certainly see why some folks don't like it. Perhaps they wanted a rah rah victorious ending and didn't get it. More likely they don't have comicbook sensibilities. But for anyone to claim Sucker Punch is not an amazing work is to fail to see how well crafted it is.    The critics asses are mine!  I have all the weapons I need. Now I WILL fight!

B004I8WD6E|4.0|The screen protector was easy to apply and stuck to my phone in one time without a single bubble. I did a practice run before removing any protective sheets above or below the screen protector. Also, I applied it from the middle of the phone first, and then smoothened it outwards towards both left and right of the center line. That  helped avoid the bubbles.   The display of the phone is very bright and clear through this screen protector.  The only two drawbacks are that it is hard to wipe fingerprints from this protective sheet, and second is that when the phone is not powered on, you can see an oily film kind of reflection from the screen protector.    The clear case fits the white iPhone 4 perfectly. All buttons and connectors are easily accessible (except the Sim card slot which hopefully no one needs to access :-) ). Looks well built and better than many expensive cases.    In summary, this package is an excellent value for money, even if only for the case.

B004XUD762|5.0|'The Song Remains Not The Same' is a great new album from one of metal's heavyweights, which will appeal both to those who have been fans for a long time, as well as help to get BLS back into the minds of the metal community and no doubt create new fans too.  The album is clearly heavily influenced by Zakk Wylde himself, who conceived the idea of the album.  The unplugged versions of songs from the latest album, \\"Order of the Black\\", are simply beautiful and there are some great new tunes in there too.
1416583408|2.0|I expected to love reading this book, but found that I was barely able to hold my frustration in check long enough to get through it.  While author Alexandra Horowitz does impart some interesting information that I suspect many dog lovers do not already know, there is much more that is repetitive and, at least to this dog owner, obvious.  Many of the 'experiments' that the author undertakes to test her own dog's knowledge end up supporting what any observant dog owner already knows.  And her descriptions of said experiments are, for the most part, tedious.<br /><br />If you have owned a dog (or dogs) for awhile you have probably noticed behaviors that are interesting, even humorous to us, which most dogs seem to share.  One wonders what there is in the dog's makeup that makes so many of them want to roll in that dead woodchuck along the roadside or stubbornly mount the leg of your elderly aunt. Well, you won't find out from Ms. Horowitz, who skims over most of the intriguing questions and dwells unceasingly on the things that you could care less about.<br /><br />Bottom line: Skip this book and select one of the many others that offer more practical insights.

0307454541|4.0|If someone called me to read a book focusing upon Swedish Nazis who entertained pederasty, incest, rape, kidnapping, murder - and  serial acts of all of the above - I would likely have declined.  This book is about those topics, and has been a resounding success - so I joined the ranks and pulled the book off the shelves.<br /><br />Intrigue is always formulaic for a best seller.  Intrigue meshing the above-named sexual promiscuities will either compound or defeat the success.  In this case, the lack of detail on the topic of the sexual conduct, I believe, is how the reader can withstand the topic without abhorrent reaction.<br /><br />The best part of the story is irony.  The tattooed and pierced eponymous character (Lisbeth Salander) is the good guy (or gal), while the gray- suited, white-shirted, -single-toned tie wearing crew are the bad guys: they are the ones doing things behind closed doors which earn the disdain of the \\"Girl.\\"  And, they pay a price if she encounters them in the act.<br /><br />And, a bit like Dan Brown's [[ASIN:0307474275 The Da Vinci Code]] the pieces of the puzzle require some basic knowledge of the \\"Good Book\\" where some of the stories revolve around some not so good lessons. In [[ASIN:0307474275 The Da Vinci Code]] the detective is a professor, here it is an inquisitive reporter - Kalle Blomkvist.  And, through the less known  dark passages of the enlightening Christian tome, we learn some literal interpretations can be unfathomable eccentric and horrifically accountable - such that those who obey the literal words are no less defensible than the Nazis who we universally detest.<br /><br />Whenever I read books which have sexual conquests by men my age with girls the age of my children, I ask myself just how accurate Oscar Wilde was when some of most unprinted words were uttered: \\"If you are going to put me in your book, at least make me good in bed.\\"  And, in this book - where the parallels in life and character between the author and sexually triumphant middle aged Blomkvist are too numerous to count - Wilde's words can be appended with: \\"If I write about me in the book, I will make sure I am good in bed.\\"<br /><br />I liked this book and recommend it to others, but will make one critical remark below which includes references to the book which may be called \\"spoilers.\\"  So, before reading further, don't do so if you wish to remain surprised.<br /><br />This is only for those who either have read the book or do not care about spoiling the ending.  In the end, the patriarch of the family of pederastal, maniacal, serial raping, serial mutilating, serial murdering, and serial disgusting people tells Blomkvist that he will not say he is sorry to Blomkvist for hiring him to investigate the family.  Now this has to be taken in context.<br /><br />First this family is rich - Rockefeller rich. And, what they had done to one of their guests is irresponsible, impertinent and grossly negligent.<br /><br />Secondly, these words were uttered after: Blomkvist was shot at, robbed, strangled, and orally violated by one of the family's most respected members. Blomkvist was scarred for life where the noose had caught his throat.<br /><br />Thirdly, Blomkvist, who was hired to write a family history by this patriarch, knew all about the family's grotesquely dirty laundry - and had full right to publish the same which would have done more than affect the few family members who had been raped, sodomized and abused by the bad boys - it would have financially ruined the family in a manner which we can only imagine (think about how hard the Kennedy clan fought the much simpler crime of William Kennedy Smith for a date rape).<br /><br />Fourthly, Blomkvist found the grand-niece who had been thought dead for a period of four decades -- a miracle which police and Rockefeller-moneyed investigators had failed to obtain prior to this time.<br /><br />Fifthly, I don't care if you live in Sweden or litigious America -- if yourhomeowners strangle people in the basement which is a room of horrors, lawsuits ensue with large settlements.  This was waived by Blomkvist. To that alone, thanks are obvious.<br /><br />I know the people in Sweden may not be as warm and fuzzy as Americans, but please - if I invited anyone into my family and subjected them to such deathly throes, an apology would be in order, and perhaps gobs of money would accompany the apology.sue with large settlements.

B004B4RCDE|5.0|This album is great, and something needs to be said about Cheers which has been rejected by many reviewers! You need to have the right attitude listening to this song to accept it, and then love it. Just because it is talking about drinking doesn't mean it's a bar song, that's not the vibe and it doesn't need a club beat. It has a very laid back Jamaican feel and that's what is so great about it! The guitar is so mellow and Rihanna lets her accent flow through (especially with the line, \\"don't let the bastards get you down, turn it around with another round\\"). The Avril bit sounds like it was remixed in, I would rather hear the song without it because I think it would take the confusion out of the bar song/chill song ambiguity, but maybe what makes this song so unique is it doesn't distinctly subscribe to one genre.

B004K4AUZW|5.0|Before the release of this album I constantly said that when it was released I was going to be EXTREMELY strict on it since I have always been sceptic about Lady Gaga's ways on this business (the way she is, the way she dresses and the songs she makes). Well, after listening \\"Born this way\\" several times already I now stand corrected.<br /><br />This is a great pop album. From beginning to end Gaga doesn't stop enjoying herself on her songs and the whole production that OBVIOUSLY she put behind them. I understand harcore fans when they're saying that the album is kind of dissapointed because this is not a DANCE album as \\"The fame monster\\" (2009) was. This is more like a pop record with plenty of beats here, there and everywhere but not quite to play on a party for instance but they shouldn't worry about that at all. I'm sure there are plenty of remixes to come for these songs for them to enjoy. I must say that \\"Born this way\\" has a huge Madonna's influence from her music back in the 90's and a bit of the 80's (you must know this by now with the \\"BTW\\" single). Personally I love songs like \\"Marry the night\\", \\"Born this way\\", \\"Government hooker\\" and \\"Scheibe\\" (great, great beat on this one), \\"Blood Mary\\", \\"Black Jesus/Amen fashion\\", \\"Bad kids\\", \\"Edge of glory\\"...these pop songs are top notch and that Gaga has shown on this record she can handle perfectly. Now, I must stand out other ones on their own for personal reasons: \\"Americano\\" must be the song I like the least. The issue I have with this one is that it sounds full of latin cliches (acoustic guitars, spanish vibe) and even the way Gaga sings sounds cliche. This could've been a decent B-side but not worth it to be on this great album. \\"Hair\\" is so far my favorite of this record. The music is great and it's memorable but, the lyrics are simple and clever. When Gaga sings the line \\"I am my hair\\" establishing it as a part of her personality... hahaha! those are clever words to say to kids these days. Love it! The fact that I didn't mention the rest of the songs doesn't mean that they're not good, in fact if you like rock music you might find \\"Electric chapel\\" and \\"You and I\\" guitar parts nice.<br /><br />Lady Gaga is a character to pay attention to on her own and eventhough I don't buy her whole image thing and her points of view on what she calls \\"art\\", her music is fun and really entertaining. If you ask me, \\"Born this way\\" is a BIG step forward for Gaga since now she has proven she can make a good, solid pop album. Now, I'm just expecting from her to released a record that breaks her frame and goes beyond her own boundaries... what do I mean with this? well, listen to Madonna's record \\"Ray of light\\" (1998) or \\"American life\\" (2003) and you'll know how I felt about Madonna herself when I thought the same about her.<br /><br />Congratulations to Gaga's new release.

B003L77GRO|2.0|I found the new series a disappointment.  It lacked the tight, creative writing with twists and turns that commonly found in the previous season; the plot line seemed to be on autopilot.  Also, the story is also becoming even more less believable, which takes away from it (e.g. dexter investigating the blood sample of a fellow co-worker who is suspected of murder, a pickup truck that happens to throw every body all over the road, and other silly incidents).

0689878451|4.0|I had heard of And Tango Makes Three by Justin Richardson and Peter Parnell because the gay penguins apparently \\"broke up\\" and one of them finally hooked up with a girl penguin, learning from his past sins apparently. Depending on what site you link to via Google, Silo left Roy for a California chick (who wouldn't) but that relationship lasted less than a year - though he hasn't gone back to Roy. Tango, the little girl they raised is now an adult lesbian penguin who has been in a loving relationship with another female called Tanuzi since 2005.    If your local library or book store doesn't have it, you can have it read to you in a really fuzzy YouTube video.    I was thoroughly disappointed at how un-radical this book was. I mean, to be challenged so many times for so long, I though it must have hot penguin nudity and the baby penguin turns out to be half-pig or something because of \\"being born\\" to two fathers. Instead, it was a cute little true story about cute little animals who like each others' company and aren't very swift as they try and hatch a stone (which is why there's got to be a female in the relationship; otherwise, nothing would ever get accomplished!). I tended to view the story as more about Tango - who got a chance to live since her mom already had another egg to nest.

0802798225|5.0|by Kay Fraser<br /><br />I have to say that this book hit close to home for me for various reasons. I guess I lived the whole Perfect Chemistry novel; in many ways, this novel describes my own relationship. Me: 100% Hispanic. My man: 100% upper middle class Minnesotan. Me: dark brown hair, dark eyes. Him: blond as can be, bright blue eyes, tall. We have always been opposites, yet...there is something there that seals the deal...where extremes collide to make perfect chemistry. Like magnets attracting, and bouncing off. There are no language barriers and no cultural barriers that can't be broken when you really want something that feels true to you, and it's just right.<br /><br />Perfect Chemistry is the book where those same differences collide. It mixes Legally Blonde and West Side Story, bringing the plot to a whole new level of complexity.<br /><br />This book is the story of Alex Fuentes, bad-ass gang member, and Brittany Ellis, high class Burberry queen. They sadly get stuck with each other in Chemistry class as partners. They hate each other with a passion, but deep inside...opposites attract.<br /><br />Both Alex and Brittany are leading dual lives; they each have the one others have built for them, full of appearances to be kept, and the one they wish they had for themselves.<br /><br />For Alex, there is no leaving his gang, the Bloods. A true Mexican gang, being a member of the Bloods will keep Alex's family safe. He was initiated after his father was killed, and Alex's participation guarantees that none of his younger brothers will have to join.<br /><br />For Brit, her life is about looking perfect and being the perfect daughter her parents always wanted. But Brittany has  an older sister with a disability who she adores and feels responsible for. Brit's sister might be the person Brit connects with the most in her life; not her best friends or her boyfriend.<br /><br />As they get to know one another, Alex and Brit discover that appearances mean nothing... yet would you give it all up for something that has no future? Someone that will only bring pain and misery to your life? Someone you know no one will ever compare to?<br /><br />I loved this book for many reasons. I haven't read an issue driven book in a while, and this one displays emotions and the true natures of the characters. Narratives are outstanding and each character has a voice of his own. Alex's mix of English and Spanish made me giggle. I don't always agree with the author's choice of words, but most of the Spanish  adds to the story. Perfect Chemistry made me want to try to look back to my Hispanic roots when writing, something I haven't considered in a long time.<br /><br />This is definitely a must-read for lovers of the YA genre. After I finished Perfect Chemistry I had to buy the second installment, Rules of Attraction, and now I can't wait for Simone Elkeles latest book, Chain Reaction, which will be released August 16th. If the days would only go faster so that I could get my hands on it! A girl can wish, verdad?no future? Someone that will only bring pain and misery to your life?

B000002AHC|5.0|One of the things that occurred to me while listening to this for the ten millionth time (thick, eh?) is that the Byrds were once considered a forward looking outfit. \\"High flying,\\" I think they said. And that was the aspect I liked. I liked that they were going someplace--indicating \\"future\\". Instead, McGuinn and Hillman suddenly dropped one of the aggressive, growing elements of the band--Crosby. He would have left anyway, but the reasons they put a horse in the window seem sort of silly now. They reversed course and went for all the stuff I had hoped to move away from--the traditional country past. I wanted forward and different. They backed up. Strange move. Of course, they did great with their versions of that time-honored music. Certainly, Sweetheart was a big deal. Artificial Energy, Natural Harmony, Draft Morning, Change is Now, Tribal Gathering and Dolphin's Smile were what I wanted more of, though. Jazzy, spacey, effecty stuff. Sustained solo guitar--soaring vocals. All that. All the songs here are beautiful, as everyone knows, and there was a time when this album was hugely important to me. Diluted over time by thousands of other records and trend after trend after trend. In someways it's home. I loved all their output ultimately, and I followed all of it beginning to end. This just seemed the peak to me.
B0047S1KMS|5.0|After watching The Walking Dead, I had heard that the UK put out this excellent zombie series.  I was not disappointed.  Where Walking Dead is more epic in its story, Dead Set is gloriously brutal in its brevity.  Knowing the show has a finite run adds to the experience.  You never know who's next, anyone can die, there's no second season that the main characters HAVE to survive until.  The show has an incredibly raw and realistic feel with some midnight black humour throughout.  If you are into the undead genre then you have to check out this series.  It has the quick undead of 28 Days Later, a darker humour than Shaun of the Dead, and all the fear and hopelessness of Romero.

B000F3T3CS|5.0|This may be the most enjoyable operatic performance I have ever experienced, and I have enjoyed many of them, both onstage and on DVD. I do not include LP or CD versions, since the visual aspect of opera is absent there.    Comedy, in any setting, is among the most difficult of endeavors to pull off. Timing is everything, and for an early (1832) 19th Century opera to still be comedic seems even more difficult, especially since most operaphiles know the work, thus surprise is unlikely. I think that the fact that this disc has generated over 50 reviews, some both detailed and scholarly, reflects on the success of the performance.    I for one, do not subscribe to the cult of former great sopranos, but I do not mean this in any way to be critical of those who do. I have seen Sutherland, Caballe, Sills and others in performances, and have and enjoy recordings of these legendary singers. But living where live opera ain't, to indulge my operaphilia ( OK, addiction!), I must rely on the DVD, of which I now have about 90. That means experiencing and evaluating and enjoying relative newcomers  (for me) to the stage.    My first experience with Ms Netrebko was in the two German galas, one from Berlin and the other from Baden Baden (both available here on DVD). Metaphorically, she blew my socks off! She has a smooth, rich voice, and her technique, especially vowel placement and pronunciation is fantastic. Admittedly, she lacks the extended range of the true coloratura, and the vocal flexibility associated with that voice, but her Norina is credible as a character and vocally stunning, IMHO. Her acting skills are remarkable, too, and it is clear that she really enjoys what she does.    Similarly with Villazon: he has a big, bright tenor voice with a brilliant legato line and an evenness through the registers. He really hams up the role of Nemorino, especially in the first part of Act I. His is simply a first rate performance.    I have always thought of Leo Nucci as a Verdian,and have enjoyed several of his performances as such. But he really shines in this comedy. So does Ildebrando D'Arcangelo as Dulcamara. This is my first experience with him, but I note that he does a phenomenal job as Escamillo in the new Carmen on Decca (Covent Garden) His is a rich but bright tone with a huge top.    But as exceptional as the singers are, it is the totality of the performance that makes this a five star review. It all just works!    Disc quality is what I have come to expect of Decca. Clear, crisp focused video is combined with the sonic detail of the DTS surround to make the recording the \\"next best thing to being there\\". And I can reprise the event any time I wish.
B004X0Y5GI|5.0|I've heard Stevie on a few talk shows here and there and haven't really thought she sounded that great.  But, I love her so much that I didn't even hesitate to buy this CD, even though I was a little worried.  Well, she sounds completely different than the way she does on TV - actually just like she always has.  I am amazed that she just turned 63 (I think).  Every single song on this CD is good, but my favorite is Annnabelle Lee.  As far as I can tell it's the actual Edgar Allen Poe poem, only set to her music with her beautiful voice.  If I hadn't liked the rest of the CD, that song alone would have made it worth the purchase.  But, like I said before, I loved every single song on this CD.  Don't even think twice about buying this - I'm sure you'll love it.
B002UBRFDC|5.0|Shogun is a great book - this is my fourth or fifth time reading it.  I'm finding quite a few typos in this Kindle edition.  So five stars for Shogun, but I would only give the Kindle version three stars, at most.

B003XF1XOQ|3.0|It's interesting reading some of the glowing reviews of this final book. It's almost like the \\"Emperors New Clothes\\" story- readers are trying so hard to find meaning to this story that they can't see that there simply is nothing there.        I disagree with those who are praising the author of stripping the book of all feeling and emotion because \\"war is hell\\". I would say war is hell because of emotion and feeling. The underdevelopment of all the characters simply led to a sterile, dull finale.       I think some of the problem, too, is the believability of the story. The concept is great, but there is simply nothing to make a reader believe that this \\"heroine\\" is capable of rallying anyone to do anything. It's such a silly stretch that I can't help thinking that the author simply lost focus, and the story became too big for her.       Is it a terrible book? No, but I found myself wanting to turn pages not because of a gripping story, but just to be finished with it.

0307595862|5.0|Of the four Harry Hole books by Nesbo available in the States, The Snowman is the best by far. Fans of this series might wonder how this could be possible after losing so many wonderful characters in previous novels, but Jo Nesbo does a superb job of creating wholly new characters for us to enjoy as well as bringing back a few of the old ones and nudging them further into the light. The Snowman sees a dramatic change in Hole as he accepts the leadership thrust upon him at the end of the previous book. He still struggles with alcoholism, but his perspective seems to have changed towards it, imperceptably. And his nemesis in The Snowman is truly quite the monster, and perhaps the worst one he has had to face of the entire series. Excellent and tough to put down, The Snowman is everything you might expect from Inspector Harry Hole, and everything you want in a detective thriller.
B0029QRA1U|4.0|I recently lost one of the most influential women in my life, my Granmama.  She had an extensive album collection that I wanted to covert to digital. This turntable has been exactly what I needed to do so. You just download the program from the provided dvd, plug it in and begin. Simple as that. The only reason I give 4 stars and not 5 is because on the Mac you have to manually split between songs. This makes it rather time consuming because you can't leave it for long. That said I'm so glad I will be able to capture these treasured albums as they are such a part of my memories with my Granmama.

B000S1M9LY|4.0|I'm currently reading and enjoying my Kindle edition of Infinite Jest. The footnotes are easy to navigate, and unlike my Kindle copy of A Supposedly Fun Thing, I have yet to accidentally lose my place and furiously click back to where I was due to a slipped finger. Good job on that front. I also love the fact that I am not lugging around a giant copy of this thing wherever I go: I doubt I'd get as much outdoor reading done with that edition.    That being said, I don't really understand the draconian limit on sharing clips (Amazon's terms for notes / excerpts), which seems to be imposed by the book's publisher (according to my reading of Amazon's \\"What's This?\\" notice next to my clips). Is the publisher afraid that someone is going to clip the entire book and sell it on the black market? I am the nerdy sort of Kindle reader who likes to occasionally share passages via Twitter, and the publishers are stonewalling me here. How am I supposed to show my internet friends that I'm reading a trendy book? Like actually reading it and everything?
B004EPYZOO|4.0|Drive Angry has everything you could want from a trashy action film: cool muscle cars, over-the-top shoot-outs, larger than life baddies, and a cool good guy with a mission.<br /><br />There is an audio commentary by director Patrick Lussier and co-screenwriter Todd Farmer. Lussier jokingly refers to Drive Angry as his \\"subtle, gentle road movie,\\" and battles through a bad case of laryngitis, which makes it difficult at times to understand what he's trying to say. But he soldiers on with Farmer as they talk about how the film was made. The two men tell all kinds of filming anecdotes as they talk us through filming. Lussier points out that Clint Eastwood's protagonist in [[ASIN:0783225725 High Plains Drifter]] was the model for Nicolas Cage's character. They give shout-outs to various crew members' contributions on this solid track.<br /><br />\\"How To: Drive Angry\\" is one of the better promotional featurettes. Amazingly, the studio gave the filmmakers the creative freedom to do a hard R-rated supernatural action film. They talk about shooting in 3D as opposed to converting it in post-production. The filmmakers also talk about working with a modest budget and solving certain problems creatively as opposed to throwing a lot of money at it a la Michael Bay. It's nice to see that many of the stunts in the film were done practically.<br /><br />\\"Milton's Mayhem\\" is an amusing extra that compiles all of Milton's action sequences and attributes a point system to every punch and gunshot like something out of a video game.<br /><br />Finally, there are two deleted scenes with optional commentary by Lussier and Farmer. We see a little more with Piper and her boyfriend and another scene with the Accountant that were both rightly cut.
B004IQMXD4|5.0|In 1973, Stevie Nicks began her career as a recording artist with the album Buckingham Nicks. That album bombed so badly, she was dropped by her label. What a far cry from her first solo album (Bella Donna) eight years later. Bella Donna hit number one, unleashed four top 40 hits, and launched her to a level of stardom reached by few rock artists: she was a member of one of rock's biggest bands and she also had a hugely successful solo career.    It's been 30 years since Bella Donna established Nicks as a force to be reckoned with in or out of Fleetwood Mac and, over the ten years since her last studio album, she seemed to be headed towards a kind of retirement: touring and releasing compilation packages. If In Your Dreams turns out to be the capstone of her career, then she's going out on a very high note. However, the album is so good that it suggests it would be a shame for Nicks to stop recording as she obviously has a lot of great music left in her. Simply put, In Your Dreams is her best album since The Wild Heart and it is the best solo effort of her career in terms of merging her mystical and rock sides.     Lyrically In Your Dreams is the most open album of Nicks' career, reminding us that Nicks is at her best when her moony mysticism and snaky incantations are married to sassy rock and roll attitude. This marriage is partly achieved by Dave Stewart's melodic and tight production. He rarely ventures into the meandering over-instrumentation that has haunted every Nicks solo album since The Wild Heart, yet he lets Nicks breath and indulge in the drama that has always formed the core of her allure. He clearly 'gets' what Stevie is all about and his production lets her be herself while deftly setting some boundaries to keep things rock and roll.    Nicks responds as she did when Jimmy Iovine pushed her this way: she gives tremendous, emotional performances. While there's no question that Nicks' voice isn't what it used to be, she seems to have accepted that hersultry vibrato is a thing of the past and is singing with what she has rather than trying to force what she used to have. I noticed this approach during her Soundstage performance as well. The result is Nicks sounds alive, energized, and happy throughout the disk, as if she's really into what she's doing and comfortable with it. In fact, I don't think she has sounded so utterly invested all the way through an album since...again, The Wild Heart.    Frankly (and I know I'm gushing now, but I've been a Stevie fan since Rumours came out when I was ten years old), In Your Dreams is the CD I have been wanting Nicks to do for decades. She's abandoned the over-production and layered instrumentation. The songs sound very direct and simple, yet the sound is still lush and full of sonic details that support the mood of the songs. As to a favorite song...sorry but I can't pick one. The songs all touch different emotions, and I love how Nicks alters her delivery for each of them. There's Nicks' always alluring overgrown romanticism ('Moonlight', 'Italian Summer'), hooky pop tunes ('Secret Love', 'New Orleans'), country twang ('For What It's Worth'), thoughtful ballads ('You May Be The One', 'Cheaper Than Free'), a dirge that verges on slowed down black metal ('Soldier's Angel'), an upbeat take on Edgar Allen Poe ('Annabel Lee'), and straight ahead rock (the title track). Even the to-be-expected loopy tracks ('Wide Sargasso Sea', 'Ghosts Are Gone') seem to work. That said, there is one song that suffers by comparison to the rest of the material: 'Everybody Loves You'. It just doesn't belong on this CD because it's clearly a Eurythmics song in need of Annie Lennox's icy cooing. Nicks hasn't got an icy note in her body, and it just sounds wrong.    As on Trouble in Shangri-La, most of the best songs are the ones Nicks writes on her own. So if I were to ding In Your Dreams, it would be for Nicks' continuing reluctance to step up the plate and write more of her own material. While I'm not crazy about her culling songs from her vaults, if she's got gems like 'Secret Love' and 'Annabel Lee' stored away, then I can't complain too much can I?    Bottom line: I have this CD in my car and just let it play over and over. I haven't given a Nicks' CD this kind of spin priority since Rock a Little. The quality and energy of this album will no doubt go down as one of the biggest surprises of the year. Nicks knocked this album out of the ballpark!
0061998494|4.0|I had a celebrity crush on Craig Ferguson going into this book, and reading it just made it more intense.

6304981635|3.0|I had shied away from watching martial arts movies from the 70s because they always looked a bit too cheesy. But a friend told me I had to watch Enter The Dragon. So onto the Netflix queue it went.    No doubt there is a lot of cheese here, largely because the movie so clearly shows its date. The \\"70's mandude\\" swagger will make you roll your eyes more than once. The music is all over the place; one minute it's like bad James Bond spy music and then the next it sounds like something from Shaft. The audio track stinks and makes it seem like you're watching dubbed foreign film when the whole thing is actually shot in English. John Saxon for me is always a Rashid Ahmed from Dynasty. Lame acting, weird clothes and hair, a thoroughly ridiculous story, and a silly villain.    That's a lot to look past, but this movie does a great job serving up some really sweet fights. No question about it! The rough cinematography actually works in favor of the film as there are some scenes where you totally feel the power Bruce Lee brought to the table. I knew Lee was big into fitness but holy crapballs! This guy has a V-back I would die to have, and he ripples every time he moves! His skills are presented in amazing clarity, and it makes me understand why Bruce Lee fans object to the slicker cinematography of today (even the stuff that I don't see as slick must seem like it is to them). A roughly shot movie like this further emphasizes that slick studio magic tends to dull the edge of a martial arts movie.    From what I understand, Lee had a lot of control over this film, and I can see it in the way there are pieces of martial arts philosophy lovingly worked into it. Apparently, this special edition has re-inserted these scenes as - back in the day - some movie studio douchebag cut them from the film after Lee's death and prior to the initial release. Brilliant decision to put them back in. I just do not get why this material seems to offend the US movie industry so much. Even today,such material is routinely cut from foreign movies for US release. It deadens the spirit of the films to cut it.    So, okay yes, there is a lot about this movie that is dated. No, I can't quite get past the high pitched 'whooo-ahhh!' that Lee lets loose when he's fighting sometimes. Yes, there were times I was watching the story and thinking \\"WTF?\\". But I really can't imagine any fan of the genre not being satisfied by Enter The Dragon. The spirit of the martial arts is definitely here, Lee's presence is awesome and smashes through all issues you might have, and his skills are so strong that you can easily see why he became such an iconic figure. I enjoyed this movie quite a bit, and I would consider checking out some of his other films which is surprising given my feelings going into Enter The Dragon. I think I'd even consider buying a copy for my martial arts movie collection.     RIP Bruce Lee
B004SBQAN8|4.0|The action in the film is almost nonstop and thrilling. When i bought it I wasn't sure if it would be hit or miss, but as I sat down and watched it I saw that \\"I Am Number Four\\" was a big hit to me and my family. But I believe that the book might be better than the film. I'm very excited to see the sequal to this film and see how they put it all together. Out of 1-5 stars I give it a 4 1/2 star rating. It was definitely worth the money I spent on it.
B004I1AGTM|1.0|I was really looking forward to Ip Man 2, as I enjoyed the first movie a lot (see Zen Throw Down review: [...]). Unfortunately Ip Man 2 is a disappointment and a surprisingly weak film. It's a classic case of a martial arts movie getting too slick for its own good while trying to go mainstream. Ip Man 2 lacks the fights needed to appeal to fans of the genre, but it's not strong enough in plot and characterization for mainstream audiences to care.    Ip Man 2 is certainly a well-crafted flick, but I just didn't find any heart or soul in it. The fights contain far too much Matrix-esque wire-fu and some of it is so silly that it makes the film ridiculous. You can't treat it as anything other than a popcorn flick, and yet it's trying to (I think) have some kind of heart. Worse than that, there are tons of fast cuts that prevent the performers from showing off their skills, and this makes you wonder if it's all special effects. Big turn off for a genre fan.    So what about the things mainstream audiences will look for: plot, acting, characterization? Ip Man 2 doesn't deliver any of this. Donnie Yen reprises the role of Ip Man capably enough, but his sincere performance seems lost and out of place in this silly movie. It's almost as though he and his character are beside the point. His student, Lueng, was well-played and interesting, but the character is not developed and goes nowhere. His wife's pregnancy was all front and center but has nothing to do with anything. A close friend of Ip Man is homeless after taking a Japanese bullet in the head and...not sure why that's in the movie as it also goes nowhere. Sammo Hung has great presence, but his character is undefined. First, he's a Hong Kong martial arts mafioso (which is a bit silly all by itself), but then we find he's working for the Brits, but then he changes sides...sort of. Huh??? What's the point of this? The final scene with a young Bruce Lee is dorky and feels tacked on to the end of the film.    The main reason Ip Man 2 will fall flat - for any viewer - is that there is no conflict. Who or what is Ip Man fighting? First we see him trying to open a martial arts school to make ends meet. Then he comes into conflict with Hung, but since Hung's having his chain yanked by the Brits they become allies in short order. Then the rest of the movie is about a boxing match with a British boxer, which Ip Man has to take on and win because...uh, well...I'm not sure why he has to take it on or win. So there can be a big fight at the end of the movie?     I also have to say that this Western fight/match with crooked 'bosses' rigging things was done far, far better in Fearless. In that movie, if Jet Li's character didn't take the match or lost it then his school and people would be shamed. Ip Man 2 tries to mine this vein but lacks the heart and soul to make the sparks fly. Ong-Bak worked this angle better, too, and it wasn't even trying to nor were those fights the core of the film (except as awesome displays of skill!). In Ip Man 2, the crooked Brit police chief running the match is too poorly played and laughable to be a real villain. His arrest at the end is corny. The match itself is not very interesting, and I still don't get the 'realization' that inspired Ip Man to open the decisive can of whoop-ass at the end. Lame.    Without much martial arts action and without a central conflict or a reason to care, it's hard to find Ip Man 2 anything but empty and directionless. This undermines the impact of the fight scenes, especially since they aren't being showcased for their own sake. I walked away from the movie feeling as though its only point was to cash in on what I understand is an Ip Man phenomenon in the East. Donnie Yen lost a good deal of credibility with me on this one.    Worth renting if you're a huge Donnie Yen fan or can't live without seeing more of his Ip Man franchise. Even in that case, though, don't expect much.
B0042JTDXK|5.0|While I own all of Mr. Groban's CDs, and enjoy them all, I must admit that they were all beginning to sound the same.  David Foster is very talented, but his music highlights the musical arrangements rather than the voices of his singers.  The first listening to Illuminations blew me away.  While the arrangements certainly are not stark or overly lean, Groban's voice is allowed to shine through first and foremost unlike in his previous offerings.  And voice is what this man is all about.   I can understand (although not agree) where some people might have a problem with the songs chosen for this project, but I can't understand how anybody can criticize his vocal prowess.  I would highly recommend this CD to any of my music-loving friends.
B000JMLFLW|4.0|I have always had a soft in my heart for Jane Austen. In fact, I can not say that there is any of her books that I do not like. About a month ago, I received my first kindle, as a graduation gift, from my boyfriend. I have to say at first I was very uncomfortable with using it because it just seemed like it would be very hard to read from it. I hate reading off the computer. However, I promised him that I would try. However, with this experiment I did not want to waste money on a book that I may never read from the piece of equipment. After searching Amazon I found the free section of ebooks and was delighted to find my tried and true author amoung those. This was the first ebook I had heard and though it has been many years and still enjoy it, greatly. Plus, I found that the kindle was right up my alley.<br /><br />Thanks, Jane; for giving me a book that never fails to capture my attention.

She makes any awkard situation that I've similarly had, seem like an event that I no longer have to cringe over. She's one of the hardest working people I've ever heard of and she deserves all the success she achieves. The audio book is full of \\"laugh out loud\\" moments, that must have made me look like an idiot at traffic lights while sitting in the car by myself. Thanks Tina!
B002NPCUDU|1.0|Every Trump book that I pick up talks about having passion for the business that you are in. It makes sense, but I was looking for some more meat to this book. A lot of filler and worthless information. I try to be a fan of Trump, but its hard after this book. He even tells us that he got to where he is because of luck. If it wasn't for a lucky event with a group of bankers, he would be cleaning my toilets.

B004X0XA82|1.0|I really don't get the hype around Fleet Foxes. They had one song off of their last album that was GREAT but the rest is just so bland and boring. Additionally, last year, I was excited when I saw they were opening for Phoenix at the Hollywood Bowl. I figured, they MUST be good live. That must be why they are the new darlings of Indie. NOT. I have never been so bored at a concert in my life - coming from a girl who has seen Michael Bolton LIVE (only for the radio station I worked at, not because I actually like him). FF is totally overrated.
0425241505|5.0|In my best Dragos impersonation:<br /><br />\\"Even if you don't normally read books about spells and witches or elves, fairies and fae or heaven forbid dragons, YOU MUST READ DRAGON BOUND NOW...please!\\"<br /><br />I'll admit it. I caved to the Tweer pressure of my peeps and all the accolades Dragon Bound was receiving on Goodreads. I had high hopes for this book based on all the hype and I can say I was not disappointed and that's coming from someone who is not a huge paranormal junkie.  I gobbled up this book like a ravenous dragon dining on a human feast...or maybe like a dragon who used to eat humans eons ago before he gave up eating creatures who could talk.<br /><br />Dragos Cuelebre.  He's big, he's badass and he's older than dirt as one of the Elder races. He's a multi-millionaire businessman with thousands of people working for him, at his beck and call and who cower in his presence.  In his human form he is formidable at almost seven feet tall and three hundred pounds of pure hard-bodied masculine muscle. And when he unleashes the beast - he's as big as an eight-seater Cessna jet. And yes he will hunt you down and rend you limb from limb if you steal from him...even if it is just a penny...after all it's the principle of the thing.<br /><br />Dragos doesn't forgive or forget - he exacts his revenge and he's hot on the trail with a steely determination unlike any he has ever before experience in his time on earth of the little thief who stole from him.<br /><br />Important lessons learned about dragons: They don't like twizzlers or cherry Coke slurpees from 7-11 and whatever you do...Don't piss off the dragon or you really will get burned - just ask those stanky, little goblins how it turned out for them - if you can find one still alive.<br /><br />Pia \\"I'm not special I just look like Greta Garbo\\" Giovanni  knew her days were numbered the day she had no choice but to steal from the most powerful man in New York City Dragos Cuelebre.<br /><br />Pia's a mystery. Even Pia doesn't really know what Pia is or is capable of.  All her life she's heeded her mother's dire warnings about keeping her abilities a secret and uses a dampening spell to conceal herself in human form.  She's one of the few people who has messed with the dragon and lived to tell the tale.<br /><br />Dragos is amused and entertained by Pia.  She gets all up in his face, pokes her finger in his chest, pushes his buttons, makes him laugh and feel things he has never before felt for another creature. But more importantly she's the first person he has ever forgiven.<br /><br />Dragos and Pia have a great, fun, flirty, feisty and playful relationship. I loved how she stood up to the big guy and told him repeatedly \\"You are not the boss of me!\\"<br /><br />Dragon Bound is fast-pasted as Dragos and Pia's relationship develops quickly over a few short days. They are in life threatening danger on more than one occasion as other dark forces are at work to kill the all mighty Dragos and capture Pia.<br /><br />Did I mention how HAWT Dragons are?

B00004XPPE|5.0|For many years, I thought that this film was treated very unfairly because of the comparison to the film Dr Strangelove.  I never cared for the latter film and always believed that Fail-Safe is a far superior film.  The fact is that these films are not at all alike and comparing them is like comparing apples and oranges.  In my opinion Dr Strangelove is just plain silly.  Fail-safe is deadly serious.  I am happy to see the high marks Fail-Safe now gets from Amazon viewers.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I was skeptical of this book....I normally don't read science fiction type books....but this was amazing! The story is so very clever, but easy to follow. I definitely recommend!
0061928356|5.0|This book really kept my attention and moved me to tears. I highly recommend it. I'm looking forward to her next one.
0525422943|5.0|I loved If I Stay and so I had to run out and pick up Where She Went as soon as I finished it. This book broke my heart from the moment I read the blurb on the back and it kept tugging those heart strings all the way through. I couldn't believe Mia had just walked away from Adam but I understood her need to start over. I just wished she'd have explained it to him rather than just taking off, that was a little harsh and it made me a little angry with her.<br /><br />In this book you get to see exactly how much Adam loved Mia. In If I Stay, I believed they were in love but I saw it as any other teenage romance. At the very end of If I Stay you get a glimpse of the strength of their love when Adam convinces her to stay. However, right from the beginning of Where She Went you get to see the depth of Adam's love for her and how much it destroyed him when she left.<br /><br />Even after they were reunited, I worried and read with trepidation. I was so afraid that Adam would get his hopes up only to be devastated again. I found myself mentally threatening Mia, telling her not to break his heart again. I don't know when exactly I jumped to Team Adam but I ended up being totally in his corner through the whole book.<br /><br />I won't say of the heart-fail continued or if there was a happy ending for these two. You'll have to see for yourself. However, I will say that I totally loved this book, possibly more than If I Stay. I recommend you pick them both up. They're not too long, I think I read both in 2-3 days. Just keep some tissues handy.
B002N5N5M0|5.0|Season 4 is the best Dexter yet. Nearly every episode is a cliff-hanger. How they managed that over and over is genius. Poor Dexter finds himself in more and more situations requiring him to act \\"normal\\". Having a family is taking its toll, and nearly costs him everything. There's tension between Dexter and Rita, Dexter and Quinn. He's making enemies right and left.     This season's bad guy was sheer genius as well, first for being cast, as well as his acting (which is no great surprise - he's just amazing). His first scene involves no dialogue at all, and is absolutely chilling.    I can't recommend this season highly enough. But if you haven't experienced Dexter before, do yourself a favor. Start from Season 1 and watch them all in order. You'll see the evolution of one of the greatest characters ever written (which I think far surpasses any of the Dexter books) and experience one of the best shows on TV. Ever.
B0000BWTK3|2.0|I was eager to get my hands on this (Schumann) performance but after listening to it I still favor (by a lot) the Schumann done by Staier and Herreweghe. The problem with the the Andsnes performance is not the piano playing but with the over-orchestration by the Berlin Philharmonic. They are overpowering (and overbearing) to the point of sounding like they're playing in the bottom of a tub filled with mud....this is supposed to be a delicate piano concerto not something Beethoven would have pounded out for his Emperor. Unfortunately the Staier is hard to find but once found you'll throw all of your other cd's of the work away..it is THE definitive performance if there ever was one. The performance is crystal clear with all the beautiful nuances of the orchestra exposed. If is a refreshing performance that I have listened to time and again. It (of my 500 classical cd collection) is maybe the best recording I have.
B00521LT8O|5.0|I know Amazon is new to this digital delivery thing, so I'll cut them some slack.  Their customer service has been wonderful, but that doesn't change the fact that there is no consistency or communication regarding what should be a weekly on-time thing.  Episode five had issues queueing, and now episode six is not available (Because of Memorial Day?  What, people don't watch TV on holidays now?) apparently until next week.  This means that we'll be a week behind on viewing, which on the internet with its now now now spoiler culture is a virtual eternity.    I predict that Amazon and iTunes will notice a sizable drop in purchases of the next two episodes as fans find *alternative* sources.  Which is sad, because I'm more than willing to pay for a timely well-produced product.  When I am made to wait for no other reason than some conglomerate's ephemeral distribution contracts, I say screw copyright law, I'm getting it somewhere else.
0525422943|5.0|I am torn between suggesting you read this book slowly and savor every minute or lock yourself in a quiet space for hours and finish it in one sitting!  This book is so amazingly wonderful, it is heartbreaking and uplifiting all at the same time.  I loved Adam in If I Stay but I love him even more after reading Where She Went.  Where She Went is told from Adam's point of view and it is so emotionally raw you can not help but feel his heartache and his dreams.  You'll cry, smile and go along with Adam and Mia in this incredible story!  I hope Adam and Mia appear in another book. I am only glad I found If I Stay late because I did not have to wait long for Where She Went.  These books are joining the few that I will read again and again...
B001IYCMNA|5.0|After reading some of the stronger complaints and one star ratings, I still bought the WAP4410N, based primarily upon my experience with Cisco products. Once received, I immediately downloaded the latest firmware update: WAP4410N-fw-2.0.2.1-K9.img. Connected the access point to my computer and followed the quick start instructions provided. Flashed the firmware and rebooted the access point. Set the configuration to work with my gigabit network configuration and then reset my HP wireless printers and wireless computers.     This works as designed, no issues and no drops. So I'm not sure what those 'experts' are saying when they complain. Maybe they were on an older version of the firmware, maybe it was something else, but this access point is much stronger than the old Netgear WG302 access point we had.     As far as experience goes, I have 25 years in IT with a good bit of that in network appliances. This is a good small business/home business network appliance. And I do recommend it, above and beyond the negative comments posted here. And we do intend to buy more.    The price is good and the warranty is 3 years.
B004XKMNWG|5.0|this by far is the best album of the year....i think this album will get the recognition it deserves later on this year. every single song on this album is just simply amazing, this might seem so girly but i feel like she is talking to me!! LOVE LOVE LOVE this JLO and the album. soundtrack for summer '11!
B003G4W49C|3.0|This book came highly recomended to me and after seeing the very good reviews I bought the book. It was a good book but I have read so many that were better. It seemed to move too fast with not enough detail. I never really thought the part about the work that enders brother and sister were doing on Earth was in any way believable. I wouldn't say not to read it but I probably wouldn't recomend it either.
1401301363|5.0|Nigella Lawson is amazing!!!  I recently got on a cookbook-buying craze and her recipes (especially the chocolate ones)are surprisingly simple and extremely delicious.  I recommend this book to anyone with a \\"taste\\" for the divine...
0375842209|5.0|This book is astoundingly good. I've been listening to it on audio (reader is great as well) and Zusak's word choices, the way he uses the different perspectives of his characters, his voice is phenomenal. I love it.
B004K4AVAG|4.0|I like Born This Way quite a bit.  There's really very few artists in history who have been able to come up with 3 consecutive albums, all of which contain multiple huge hits in them, but Lady Gaga has already achieved that.  Strangely, it's some of the songs that haven't hit the airwaves (yet) that I like best.  To me there are fewer songs that I like than the previous albums however, so 4 stars instead of 5 for me.  Still a great effort.  And if she tours this album I'm sure I'll find myself going to that too.
B000003FMY|5.0|This CD is a wonderful combination of technical skill in recording and artistic rendering of beautiful music.  Other reviewers have commented on the Pictures at an Exhibition tracks.  I think this is the benchmark which performances of this work should be judged. An extra dimension to the CD is provided by the enthusiasm  and energy of the orchestra in all of the compositions. Every time I listen to it, I get a better appreciation of its beauty and the talent of the artists.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|This is the first game that we picked up for the Pandigital eReader and it works perfectly.  Game-play is fast, fun and additive.  Fun for myself, my wife and 7 year old son.  Definitely a crowd pleaser.    Highly recommended for all, and great value for $0.99
B0032JTV74|5.0|What can I say... :D Glee is my 2nd favorite TV Show and I say it is an international and well known TV series! I always wanted to buy this on Blu-Ray, and I finally made it! This TV Show is one of the best TV Show's I have ever seen! It is... just GREAT and INTERESTING! Good cast, GREAT plot and dramma, nice setting and very well directed/produced!!! ;)
0061537934|5.0|Being an aminal lover, it was really different to read a book where the dog is telling the story.  The author really did an excellant job of placing himself in the view from a dogs eyes. I found the book to be interesting, laughable, and tearful at times. It also involved me in the story. Next to Marley and Me, this comes in second in favorite books.
B004Z2TUGE|2.0|I would have liked this movie (more) if it had moved fast like SALT. Unfortunately, it is way too saturated with (to put it mildy) high school gumi poo poo. A little less high school poo poo and more action would have pleased even the HS crowd and brought in more mature audiences. Straight up, not enough action! Disappointing. Poor studio, director, writer judgement. Certainly the overall draw was/is/will be impacted by this lack of insight. Rich with inane highschoolish nonsense.
0316056863|5.0|I found the book to be quite interesting and gave me new insight to the real Tina Fey. Would recommend to all SNL fans and even those causal viewers such as myself.
B0041I0N9A|5.0|This is a great model that looks amazing. While slightly repetitive with the wings, it was a fun build. The stand allows the ship to be displayed perfectly with the wings in flight mode and gives a great perspective to view it. I wish they could have done something like that with the UCS Falcon. The figures are a nice add-on, although the shuttle only seats 4 so somebody has to stay behind to guard the landing gear.    A terrific set that is well worth the money.
B003KUSUG8|5.0|Recovery is great not his best but its up there. My favorite is the Marshall Mathers LP. All the people with negitive comments are the people who only like Slim Shady, only a true Em fan love Marshall, Eminem, and Slim Shady. Now compared too all his other album this is the most calm and his first without skits. If your a huge slim Shady fan songs like (3 am, The real slim shady, My name is, I'm shady ect.) and you think those songs are the best then don't get this album. But if u think songs like (Halie's Song, Like Toys soldier, Lose yourself, Rock bottem, yellow brick road...ect)then get this album if u like all the people then mos definatly get this album, theres no songs on here that scream CRAZY, its full of Marshall and Eminem with a sprinkle of Shady
B002BSHXJA|4.0|Picked this up at a nice price (compared to the INSANE original retail price). Really got into it last night with some good phones. I, like many of us, have multiple versions of the music. I've also got those U.S. versions from a couple of years ago, as well as the original releases. I really enjoyed opening and playing these cd's. I think my major observation is that they should have included both mixes on one box set. That was done of the U.S. versions. It's inconvenient and expensive to have to buy two sets. But I digress. These sound very good and it's an all round fun package. I actually have mixed feelings about some of the versions. The vocals are a little bit recessed relative to the stereo mixes. That takes some getting used to. Even though the stereo mixes are really annoying (especially on headphones), the separation gives a kind of clarity to some of the elements. The up front vocals on some of the previous versions have a bit more sibilance, whereas the mono mixes have reigned that in to some extent. I always hated the White Album, but I have given it more of a listen with this set. Still not too crazy about it (much of it just seems pointless to me), although Savoy Truffle is a favorite. OK, this is a pretty rambling review, but if you can find this at a decent price, I don't think you will regret it. On one last note, I don't see why they can't create a new mix that gives us just enough separation to provide a slight sense of \\"space\\" without the ridiculous \\"fake\\" stereo. Having the drums in one ear and the vocals in the other doesn't present a sense of three dimensional sound. I hate tinkering with history, but that would be interesting to hear. Oh, and another thing. Am I the only person out here who would love to have the U.S. version of the Hard Day's Night soundtrack? George Martin's instrumentals on that were awesome (and very nostalgic to me). I'd have to crank up the old Thingmaker and cook up a few rubber bugs to that background music! :D
B002M3SP28|5.0|I have listened to many of Jeffery Archer's audiobooks. His stories are magnificent! I was unaware that Paths of Glory was \\"based\\" on the life of George Leigh-Mallory, an actual British mountain climber of the early 20th century. As with all of Mr. Archer's work, the story and characters are very well developed. You really feel as though you know, and very much like, the main character and his wife and peers.<br /><br />Without spoiling the story, I'll simply say that I believe he accomplished his life's goal...<br /><br />Hats off to a master storyteller. Mr. Archer, please keep them coming.
B004R0N0TM|5.0|Natalia Kills is truly the future! She is not afraid to make music that you can dance to, or torture your ex-boyfriend  to, and makes it work. She has a style different than any other artist, and she will surely reach superstardom!
1400079144|2.0|After his other books, this one was a disappointment.  It had an interesting mystery, but the resolution was pathetic.  It was like that riddle about what's always coming but never arrives (Tomorrow - only this time, tomorrow never came).  It was also rather ponderous without being genuinely intellectual.  I think Brown would do better to cut the verbiage and give his books a more exciting driving force.  In this case there was none of the sense that a lot hung in the balance, as there was in Digital Fortress, Deception Point and Angels and Demons.  In that respect it was more like the Da Vinci Code, but less interesting.  It has got to the point that the Dan Brown imitators are more exciting than Dan Brown himself, and that suggests that he's past his sell-by date.  I was recently reading [[ASIN:B004XOZ9JG The Moses Legacy]] by Adam Palmer and it reminded me of all that a Dan brown book SHOULD be.
B004K4AUZW|1.0|I think if she concentrated her strong vocals with songs similar to speachless from her previous album than this album could have been a fine piece of work.    Instead shes really just an act, a show.What makes this album different from all mindless dance albums ? Such a shame.Her career is done before it even started. And that album cover? What?
B00005JMFQ|1.0|there's a good version of A Y N I L but otherwise I found the movie to be pretty boring and slow. Just fast forwarded through it. Not recommended.
B004EC5IUW|4.0|I enjoyed this movie. The video was very good on Blu-ray. I do not think I understand the true importance of the ending. I am eager to see the third movie in the series. I have never seen the TV series. The movie was in English and I thought the actors did a very good job reading the lines. There are many questions yet to be answered about what is really going on behind the plot in the movie. Who are the real good guys and who are the bad guys and are the EVAs just pawns for a true plot not yet revealed.
B00337KM2S|3.0|ok movie - a bit slow but tolerable and entertaining. I don't like the way Anna Kendrick talks: total loss of femininity that is so common in US among some women.
B004HO6HWA|5.0|Dont let the fuddy-duds that are stuck on the original movie ruin this one for you. If you like explosions, great fight scenes with Stathom, lots of gun action, then this movie you will love. No, it does not have alot to do with the original, and thank God it doesn't, because I too am tired of remakes from originals. But this movie shouldn't even be related to the original, its on its own. Dont miss his one, if your a Jason Stathom action fan!!!!!!
0553381695|1.0|When I read the first book I was enthralled, ensnared, spellbound, enraptured. I damnnear almost literally couldn't put the book down. If I was eating, I was reading. Walking my dogs? Also reading. Cooking? Reading. Bath? Reading. Waiting room? Reading. Checkout line? Reading. My Kindle was practically glued to me. I had to charge it twice in three days!     But that was the first book. The second book? DISMAL. Bloody, horribly DISMAL. 50% characters blathering back and forth at each other, 40% description, 10% action. BORING. BORING. BORING. I fervently do not recommend this book and it's a crying shame because the first one really had me going. I don't think I'm going to waste my money on the third book. Don't get me wrong, I'm still terribly, painfully curious to know how things turn out but I honestly don't think I can bear to sit through another thousand pages of dialog and description.
B002ZG99IG|2.0|Its what looks to be a very poor attempt of recreating the movie \\"single white female\\". This movie keeps you hanging on the whole movie then finally something happens the last 15 minutes. Save your money and rent it if you want. Go and rent or  buy \\"single white female\\", its a much better suspense thriller with more chills and action.
1878424114|5.0|I really like this book. This is the 3rd coppy that I have purchased and 2 were for gifts. One was an actual request as a gift. I enjoy the peace I get from reading it. It aslo has helped me understand how I can move forward in attainment of my desires.
B000UAFDP2|1.0|While the film may share a title and character names with a great novel that is about as far as it goes. One could easily have simply titled \\"Dude wheres my car\\" as Starship troopers and come up with the same results. Only the film Dude wheres my car has better acting, better directing, better screen writing, and an ability to hold the attention of the audience that this film just does not have.<br /><br />One could only hope for a real zombie Apocalypse so that Heinlein might visit the director and exact his vengeance upon him. Paul Verhoeven does for Heinlein what the Vandals did for Roman Architecture.
B000002U94|5.0|This tape was my running companion for years, I finally wore it out and was happy to find it again  on a CD from Amazon. I don't run anymore but remember all the good times at road races when I listen to it. Bob Seger and the Silver Bullet Band, my all time favorite!
0061537969|5.0|There is not a question, that if you have a dog, love a dog, know someone who has a dog and loves it, THIS is a book you must read. From the first page until the wrenching ending, you will not put it down.  You will keep looking at your own dog and always wondering what he or she is thinking. We already know how smart our dogs are and that they can 'talk' but this book says it all  It's brilliantly written and the story woven in is spectacular even if you know nothing about car racing.  The last time I cried so much was when my own dog died and now (SPOILER) I know how he felt.  Yet, I know he has come back in my next dog.  This is a book for all ages.  I loved it so and now my husband is reading it.  We are both in our 60's...
B001GJ9G90|5.0|Sexy. Dangerous. Secretive. Did I mention sexy? Loved the interplay between the characters and the chemistry between the actors. I could sense a passion being stirred. Vince Vaughn is a treat. Just an all-around funny guy. All Jane's assistants' names started with a \\"J\\". Kewl, huh? This movie gets better and better every time I watch it. Sorry Aniston lovers - Jolie is way hotter and much less annoying.
0393338827|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  The author's approach of weaving through story through the experiences of a small collection of hedge fund investors / managers - helped to keep the thread of what was going on alive.  As a fan of Liars Poker - I enjoyed the opening and closing chapters as well...nicely done!
B002M3GPOI|5.0|You know you want it! Just buy it! Great re-mastering, and the 5.1 is very nice. It is like a KC revival in manmy ways - sounds great!
B000GPIPTW|5.0|The merits of this album need not be discussed here. Pet Sounds has been widely regarded as a pop classic for over forty years and its popularity shows no sign of letting up. What does need addressing, however, is the sound Capitol has achieved in rendering this recording in Mono on CD.<br /><br />The remastering game that has been going on for the past decade has yielded mixed results. Record companies promising superior sound have come up short more than half the time when it comes to reissuing classics. Lucky for us, that's hardly the case with this reissue of the Beach Boys' finest hour.<br /><br />Pet Sounds in Mono is what every fan hopes for when plunking down hard earned cash for an album he already owns. The sound is incredibly warm with every instrument coming through distinctly. The harmonies coalesce in a way you simply don't hear on a stereo mix. And the immediacy is impressive.
0553103547|5.0|My review is short and sweet:  I love this book in the series!  The characters are well developed; the story has a good pace with lots of twists and turns and intrigue.
0451228375|5.0|World Without End was amazing. I'm a huge fan of Pillars of the Earth, and started WWE as soon as I finished POTE. I couldn't put it down. In my humble opinion, I thought WWE was perhaps even better than POTE.
B00336G7HI|1.0|I purchased this battery for use with a SONY Camcorder HDR-CX700V. The charging light on the camcorder was flashing when I tried to charge the battery. The SONY NPFV50 that originally came with the camera was charging normally as was the SONY NPFV100 that I purchased subsequently.<br /><br />The battery did appear to be charging but when I operated the camcorder with it, the display indicated \\"use only original batteries\\" and shutdown after about thirty seconds.<br /><br />I did notice that this battery appeared to be marked differently than the other two batteries. The circular recycle emblem with the 800 number was missing, the engagement slots were square instead of rounded and the serial number was in the middle of the label instead of the bottom right-hand corner. The \\"ActiFORCE\\" label on the front of the battery was shiny and looked as though it had been added afterwards.<br /><br />I spent several hours on the phone with SONY Customer Support. They did not recognize the markings on the battery label or the serial number. The implication was that this was a counterfeit battery.<br /><br />I emailed images of all the batteries to the Amazon Vendor who kindly offered to replace the battery or give me a refund. I opted for the refund which was provided promptly.<br /><br />I  still need the battery so I am ordering a replacement though another Amazon Vendor. I hope this one will be the real thing.
0689835604|4.0|I enjoy Karen Katz' illustrations, we have 3 of her books, and my toddler has been taken with this one in particular ever since we got it.  We tried to read it with her only when supervised, but still we have lost a few flaps which must be glued back in place.  Lift-the-flaps are so enticing for little ones, I wish they made them more durable.
0312600844|2.0|I found this book indulgent and waaaay too long. I hung in there until the bitter end partially because I thought something spectacular was going to happen. I will say, that at times the author surprised me with a beautiful line here and there. All in all it was a bit too much of not much going on.
B003INBNXO|5.0|I rented this based on all the positive reviews.<br />So I'd like to extend a big thank you to my fellow reviewers.<br />I watched it, I loved EVERY second of it.<br />The good?<br />Incredible acting.<br />Fighting scenes that were out of this world.<br />A deep and touching story that evolved nicely.<br /><br />What didn't I like?<br />Nothing, when it comes to martial arts movies this one is sheer perfection.<br />I'd write more but why?<br />If you love Asian film then you'll love this movie.<br />Highly recommended.
055357342X|4.0|Like the first two books in the series, I enjoyed this book.  I am becoming a bit frustrated with some of storylines at this point though. I would have liked to see it move a bit faster; the pace is starting to become a bit frustrating as well as some of the storylines.  Still a great read!
0679745653|3.0|This was a quick fun read.  Holly Golightly is of course the perfect name for this character.  Read the book and then see the movie.  For a change, think the movie was better
B0041TM5OU|5.0|This always hits the lists of the best Jazz LP's of all time and that is no surprise...This latest re-issue of the classic has barely audible tape hiss at the beginning; however, the timeless beauty of this record more than makes up for it. A must for your collection of vinyl if you were not fortunate enough to get an earlier re-issue.
0761119752|1.0|My daughter, who just loves books and always has, thankfully finds this as boring as I do.  We have given it away finally as it was just taking up valued book shelf space.  The pictures aren't nearly as engaging as some of Sandra Boynton's other work, and the worst part is the rhyme.  It doesn't flow nicely at all.  It seems this was written and illustrated in a day.
0783229526|5.0|Unless you have read Hunter's books or just have any knowledge of his exploits you will not fully understand him or even try to.  Terry Gilliam has done a remarkable job of bring  a book to film.  And the work of Johnny Depp in portraying Hunter should have given Johnny an award for his performance.  The book was hilarious but to see it in film made me split my side from the hilarity.  Bill Murray could not pull off Hunter in \\"Where The Buffalo Roam\\" But Johnny Depp was Hunter's twin.  Where are you now \\"GONZO\\"?
0553381695|5.0|As with the first book in the series, I enjoyed reading this second book.  The pace is fast enough; there are lots of twists and turns and intrigue.
B002ZG994U|5.0|this movie is better than the expendables if you've seen it already. when i saw it it was great i wanted 2 see it over and over again.
B0000UJDLM|4.0|The 80's decade has a lot of great movies. Short circuit is one of them. Watching this movie again made me feel a little bit nostalgic about those years. About the DVD itself: you will get only the DVD and the case, don't expect a list of chapters, promotionals or anything additional. Also in the DVD there is not subtitles and no other languages (the description at Amazon indicates subtitles and Spanish language, but there is nothing of that). The DVD menu gives you this options: Start, scenes, languages (5.1 or 2.0, both of them in English)
0671449028|3.0|This wasn't all I had hoped it would be as far as a going to bed book was concerned.  Firstly I hate that they are exercising after they've put their pyjamas on. How do you explain that one other than that it's silly?!  We've been reading to our daughter since she was born, and she loves books, but this one never really grabbed her attention and she never chooses it of her own accord.
B004H1V5RU|3.0|I ordered perplexus for my 10 year old son.  we have the first one, and this one seemed a great challenge.  however, it came with a broken piece!  i was not surprised only because i have read this in previous reviews! it is obviously poorly constructed.  now i have the headache of returning it.
B0051QO4QY|5.0|I really enjoyed this album compared to the Fame Monster. I felt that album wasn't as good as The Fame, itself. I felt that it lacked alot of spunk compared to the first album and was alittle worried that this one would,as well. Boy was I wrong! This album took me completely by surprised. This has to be one of the best electronic albums this year! Schiebe, Judas, and Bad Kids are three of my favorite tracks. Bloody Mary and Americano are also good as well. In fact, I thought Born This Way was the weakest of the tracks. (Which may have been a smart marketing move!)I felt like she did a great job of picking out producers/ musicians. It reminded me so much of Deadmau5 and some newer Pet Shop Boys type music. She does a great job of mixing in 80s pop with modern rhythmic beats. This album is playing along side, Calvin Harris and Goldfrapp's releases from last summer on my mp3 player. I felt like she outdid them both by a longshot. Lady Gaga is really a good student of music, and I'm sure she'll have a successful career. One as long as Madonna or any of The Jacksons has yet to be seen. This is defiantly a good album to have if your a fan of pop music. Lady Gaga's really done a great job!
0316056863|5.0|I love reading about other peoples lives and I thought Tina shows a lot of what life is like full with ups and downs. I would recommend this book for lovers of memoirs.
B004SH40BQ|5.0|I took a chance on this as it appeared to be new and didn't have a lot of feedback.  Wow!  This is a great little bluetooth adapter.  I'm using it on my 160 GB IPOD Classic and it works great.  I also bought a wireless headphone set--Subject PLS-9400, Pulse low profile Bluetooth with mic--what a fantastic combination.  I'm thrilled to finally have a way to listen to my IPOD without the pain of using wired headphones that always tangle.  Try this, you won't regret it.  Try the speakers too, they're awesome.
0446691437|5.0|Fab book: relevant, articulate, simple, profound. Every creative person should read this. I'm buying 10 for my dearest friends and family.
B003Y38YFS|3.0|I wear a 7-7 1/2, so size 7 is what I ordered. They fit when I tried them on and I started to fall in love with them... and then I took a walk... A really short walk to my mail box. They were sooo uncomfortable. The strap that goes between your big toe and second toe really rubbed them the wrong way. There's no way I could ever wear them anywhere because the pain is so irritating. I've never bought crocs before, so I really was taking a leap of faith by ordering these. I thought they were cute and were going to be ever so comfy... wrong.

B0036TGT3E|1.0|Hopefully this blu ray dvd of the Lion King is the ORIGINAL movie version. Not the done over Michael Eisner remake with the extra scenes which make the dvd pause for about 2 seconds. Plus the extra scenes did not do anything for me or the extra song. Why they have to do stuff like that who knows. Let's just hope that Disney did not screw this one up.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|This app is great. Why bother with buying the actual Kindle and cart around yet another digital device when I always have my phone on me? And you can't even read a Kindle in the dark! But my Galaxy S4G is always handy, in any conditions ! Even if this were a paid app, it's worth the purchase!
B0000CEB4V|5.0|I just can't imagine a better concert film.  The sound is impeccable, the musicianship is superb, the songs are at once familiar and yet underplayed.  Superb guitarists like Marc Mann and Andy Fairweather Low capture George's guitar parts note-for-note.  Eric Clapton directs the music and takes it as seriously as he always takes his projects.  Highly recommended.
0316069353|5.0|I'm wondering if the large number of unjustified 1 star reviews are organized by fanatical Republicans reacting ... consciously or not ... to the complex but recognizable psyche of the defendant in this fine book.  It's an excellent read.
B0034G4OUY|4.0|I thought it was a good action flick. I also liked the back story. The beginning seems to be a little confusing but when they start to explain why he is out for revenge then you can get what is going on. I would see this movie if you get a chance. The Rock is getting better.
B0041KKYBA|5.0|This documentary explains the financial collapse so obviously that you'll want everyone to see it.  So many times people blame the other political party for our economic disaster, but this movie should prove that there's blame for everyone in American politics and especially the top financial companies.  Highly recommend this movie.  It will motivate you to action.

B004HO6HWA|4.0|Producers Irwin Winkler and Robert Chartoff have dusted off the screenplay by Louis John Carlino and remade their early seventies Charles Bronson vehicle 'THE MECHANIC'-1972 by turning it into a high gloss, crisp nail biter under the direction of action auteur Simon West. This version as the original resembles a western in its construction as we have the professional gunfighter becoming a teacher in gun play to an amateur who's father the gunfighter has assassinated and will escalate the revenge motif in the climax of the film.  It is almost a carbon copy of screen writer Luciano Vincenzoni's script to the Lee Van Cleef/John Phillip Law Spaghetti Western  'DEATH RIDES A HORSE' aka 'DA UOMO A UOMO'-1967 but naturally without the intrigue. I will go to see anything with Jason Statham who seems to select his action roles with great aplomb and this one has all the moves that we can expect from him.  Ben Foster who dons the Jan Michael Vincent role and who literally stole Director James Mangold's '3:10 TO YUMA'-2007 right from under the noses of Russell Crowe and Christian Bale makes a great partner for Statham until the excellent climax. Donald Sutherland shows up as Staham's mentor and his presence lingers throughout the proceedings.  Fans may clamor for Director Michael Winner's original but you can't deny the power of this films action sequences as West denounces character development in favor of rip-roaring set pieces.  The music score is by progressive jazz writer Mark Isham and Sony Entertainment releases it in a sharp 2.35 transfer enhancing the photography by Eric Schmidt.  Whether he flits through the films of Guy Ritchie and throttles his way through the 'TRANSPORTER' franchise, Jason Statham continues to be the king of the action genre and the modern day movie industry is all the better for it.
B004BSFSTA|4.0|I bought these as a replacement for my Panasonic RP-HTX7; phenomenal headphones which lasted for more than 12 years and took a ridiculous pounding.  The Panasonic retails for $70.  You will find these for about $100.  With that in mind, they are perhaps the best pair of headphones your going to find for $100 bucks.  I did not get these on     I tried these headphones out on an iPhone 3GS, Macbook Pro, and out of a 12 channel Behringer mixer I use for my video game and movie audio system.  It needed more voltage to perform well with the iPhone, mainly because the iPhone audio signal is low voltage and has audio limiting on it (anyone can correct me on this).  The Macbook and the mixer both made these headphones sing.    Burn in period with them was about 2 to 3 hours before they became warm and leveled out.    Sound quality and quantity are on par with the Monster Beats Solo and the Skull Candy Aviators.  The aviators, although perhaps looking very cool, do not sound very good in a crowded room.  The Monster Beats Solo are a great piece of equipment, but I see them on everyone.      A couple of points which may be of concern:    1.  The size of the ear cups was surprising to me.  I thought they were going to be bigger.  They are tiny.  Do not let that fool you.  After your initial encounter with them, you will appreciate their small form factor.    2.  The cable on this is coiled for half the cable.    3.  The audio jack is of VERY high quality.  Textured for easy gripping and the cable has a spring coil sheathing it into the connector.  Very nice construction.    4.  The headphones are a bit small. So people with HUGE heads may not enjoy these.    5.  They fold up.  I did not know this but I am pleased they do.  I was not pleased a carry bag did not come with it.    6.  The box is very pleasing to open.  It is not just some junky clamshell inside.  They put thought into this.     7.  The materials used in construction of this feel nice.  Not like the Monster or Skullcandy headphones, which feel very plasticky.  The Monsters have a reputation for having their plastic break on the headband.  This will not.    Bottom line:  These were meant to be a pair of headphones I could take with me everywhere I went.  I travel a lot in my day and escaping from the noises of other people into music is quite important.  These will get you there and you will not look ridiculous either.  It will not look like you grabbed your studio headphones for a jaunt nor will it look like you can not afford better.    In short, go for them.
B000H5V8DG|2.0|I decided to order this based on the latest review that they are now coming with protective plastic sleeves. Unfortunately, this doesn't seem to be the case. Perhaps random ones might occasionally get it, but mine did not. Every disc has one or more scratches on it. I did call Buena Vista Home Entertainment (a Disney phone number) to confirm, before purchasing, that they would still replace the discs and sent me a UPS label to send them back. I'm probably going to send all the discs back, since they all have scratches on them... some might play, but there is no reasonable way I can test 5 seasons of dvds within a proper return period.  ** EDIT **  Just realized I never edited this review with my final comments. I did send back the entire 5 seasons of discs to BVHE, since I couldn't reasonably test them within the return period. I received the UPS label promptly, and got a new set of unscratched discs back very fast. Probably within a few days of them receiving the return. Excellent customer service.
B000AMJC2K|2.0|Installed two of these via a through desk mount (not the clamp).  Adjusting the arms isn't quick as it's difficult to reach and change the adjustment points while holding the monitor in position (recommend having someone else helping out with this).  My issue was that regardless of how I adjusted them, I could not get two monitors to line up with each other.  There was always at least a 1.5\\" vertical difference between the two.  Would probably be fine if you're using a single monitor.  I ended up returning them.  Really appreciate Amazon's return policy!  Kudos to Amazon.
B002BU0DPE|4.0|I love my Turtle Beach PX21s. It's been a year since purchase and there's really only been one complaint, and it's not really even a complaint. First off the first pair of headphones I received had been damaged in packaging ... the pin holding the belt clip was wound too tight and the plastic had shattered. But contacting TB for a replacement was less trouble than I expected, so yay Turtle Beach on that front. But other than that they've worked as or better than expected. Managing the wire is a bit of a pain as it becomes \\"stressed\\" and twisted quite easily ... they should have designed it more like the coilly phone lines we used to be accustomed to. Other than that, they're great and great for gaming.
B0000028MA|5.0|This album encapsulates grunge music. It is a great mix that puts you back into the early 90's, making you want to reach under your bed and pull out those doc martens. Good for anyone who doesn't have a collection yet or just to use as a mixtape. A must have.
B001FB4W0W|2.0|Yes, Six Feet Under and American Beauty were outstanding productions, but Alan Ball's True Blood is such a rabid piece of simpleton crud that one wonders if Ball's earlier efforts were massaged to greatness by more talented minions.    What's good? The production values --nice lighting, good framing and production design.    What's crap? The writing. Oh please, the dialog is groaningly cheep and clichéd. So is the workman-like acting. How can anyone actually identify, care about or even marginally like a single character in this series? All are cookie-cutter flawed, none have any interesting or marginally redeeming qualities. You'd think Louisiana anti-heroes would be a bit more like gumbo than off-white paint.     Drama, context and depth? There's some blazé humping. Oh boy.    Commentary on racism? Is that what it is?    Season's story arc? Who cares? We've got blunt-force innuendo and blazé humping.    Vapid and boring: Nothing but a poorly written/acted soap opera with good lighting and dull dead-meat characters.     Oh yes by all means, do enjoy this bubblegum-naughty extravaganza.
B003UESJHE|1.0|I will not be reviewing this item as it won't play on my DVD Blu Ray player. I have other Blu Rays from you which do play so there must be something wrong with this disc.    I won't be ordering any more films from you.
B004H0N4PC|5.0|The Whole album is cohesive its just that you have to give it time, but eventually it grows on you,     If you are not conscious of the whole concept, each song builds the whole concept, and they are the parts of a whole, as is a body,mind and soul that and more its definitely cosmic if you love a breath of fresh air purchase it
B003F1WM2K|4.0|I have followed Smith's music career since her heyday of \\"Because The Night\\" back in the 1970's, always thinging \\"...what a totally out-there gal!!...\\".  Little did I know!!  I admit, as have other reviewers, that I would not have read this book if I had not been intruiged by its winning of the National Book Award...which would have been my loss!!  Smith writes in a voice which soothes the soul of the reader and draws one into her early life in the heartland and her journey to New York to seek fame and fortune in the thriving art scene. Then, along comes Robert Maplethorpe...an interesting, caring, talented, and demon-drivin man whom the vulnerable and giving Smith comes to love for a lifetime.  I found the story or their love affair, Smith's emotional acceptance of Maplethorpe's homosexality, and her lifelong dedication to her first love moving and told in a poetic and loving manner that brought tears to my eyes with each page.  The short retelling of Maplethope's passing and the effects of this loss on Smith shook my heart and soul...what a love story and so beautifully written!  \\"Just Kids\\" well deserved the many weeks on the best seller list and the many awards it received.  Ms. Smith is a writer that I, most definately, hope will not lay down her pen with this one contribution...I hope to read her again and again in future efforts.  A stunningly beautiful book and story of love, friendship, and artistic partnership...simply a MUST READ!!  Bravo, Patti Smith!!
0756405890|5.0|Even infinite potential can be tempered by absolute apathy. This is an endearing tale of a boy that grows into a legend to be respected and feared.<br /><br />I'll start this review off simply: If you love fantasy, don't bother reading this, just go read Rothfuss' The Name of the Wind. Of the books that I have reviewed over the last year or so, this is quite possibly the best. It is hard to adequately convey just how good this book is. It may not be perfect, but it comes close.<br /><br />For the rest of you that insist on knowing more, or have long since made this novel's acquaintance, read on...<br /><br />Kvothe is a singular talent. A man of song and heart, cunning and thievery, power of mind and magic. He is many things. Success is always at his fingertips, and yet he is broken down by horror, stretched thin by a life turned hard and he very nearly forgets all that he was. This is a story of a boy seeking to unravel the mysteries of the universe, and a man waiting to die.<br /><br />Being first person, it should be no surprise that Kvothe is the very foundation and substance of this novel. Kvothe carries this story on his shoulders, bearing its sometimes incredible weight, even though it breaks him in the process.<br /><br />For much of the novel, I tried without success to dissect Rothfuss' story and learn what made it so compelling, however it was so well written the prose was mostly invisible. So, instead I learned about life.<br /><br />And that's when you know you have something special in your hands.<br /><br />The book does have one weakness, one flaw that some might find issue with: plot. Largely it lacks an apparent overarching plot. There is one, but it is far in the background, moving slowly, a specter that we wish to see more of, but have to wait until the fullness of time has come about and given us the opportunity. In the mean time, the plot becomes Kvothe: his life and his trials, and lays the foundation for what I feel are great things to come. It is without doubt a journey, though one incomplete. A beginning.<br /><br />To someone who has not read The Name of the Wind, this may sound like a huge failing, and if Rothfuss had managed a stronger overarching plot, it would have made the book that much better; but it should be noted the author's sheer skill with telling a story is such that it renders much criticism: moot.<br /><br />This book does not read like a debut, it reads like it is from the hands of a master, experienced in his craft. Yes, it had its irregularities, but one might argue that these are not a detriment and could very well be part of what makes it great. At times I was ready to call this book 5 stars, but as a whole I give it 4.5 incredible stars. Even though the ending does suffer, you are so thoroughly ensnared by the novel by then that you really don't care. For me, I can't wait to read the sequel. It's out now, so what are you waiting for?<br /><br />Come read more on my blog [...] where I document my own writing journey and artistic pursuits.beginning.

B004XDYJRU|4.0|awesome sound quality &amp; picks up great stations! I love the ability to record &amp; save favorite stations. pretty fast as well.
1400049628|4.0|This book was great, even if it did have a few small flaw's(though I am survival trained, so it's not really fair for me to nit-pick). I got some really good laughs from it, and was amazed at the detail put into here. From guns, to hideaways, to basically everything else, somehow the author was able to cram in into a small book. I can only imagine the endless researching the author had to do for our entertainment. Big gold star to him!<br /><br />Basically, if you are looking to survive the coming zombie apocalypse, then this is the book for you! Though of course a gun might help too...
B004G600A4|5.0|This movie has everything. Interesting storyline, great music, magical moments, humour, romance and action. We saw it first at the movie theatre in3D, but the 2D experience is no less enthralling.
0470932139|5.0|As a food blogger I have been following Helene's blog for years and have admired her beautiful pictures.  When I heard about this book I had no doubt I wanted to read it and learn her tips on taking food pictures.  What I love about Helene is that she wasn't trained as a photographer, she became one, and her style of writing is simple, to the point, and also light and funny.  This book is not super technical so if that is what you are looking for, this is not the book for you.  It is written for a wide audience, people who love cooking and want to improve the quality of their photos.  It is organized in chapters about camera settings, light, composition, etc.  The most interesting chapter for me was the one on light, one thing I always admired in her photos.  With few photos Helene shows how the same composition can look with unfiltered, diffused, or bounced light. Really simple and easy to understand and try at home, not fancy equipment necessary.  Her explanation on soft light, which contrary to what I thought you achieve it at a distance from a window, is excellent.  She also pushes her readers to move away from the automatic setting of the digital camera, and go back to the manual or semi-automatic settings (which I learn before digital photography).  Three chapters are dedicated to composition, set up, and styling, which are all so informative.  What I like about her writing is that Helene makes you feel that she is next to you, explaining all those concepts verbally. Moreover, her photos are visual aids to get her point across, but be aware, they make you salivate!
B0052U59F4|5.0|Wow, what at ride!  This story has it all.  A man that learns to love with his all, a woman that can teach him what he doesn't know about love, and some suspense that makes it a bonus!  This book will make you laugh, read out loud to your significant other and maybe even teach you a few tricks to spice things up.  I loved it!  Can't wait for the next two books to follow.  The author gives you exactly what you want, and then some.  Bring it on E L James, you know what we like.

B002G1YPH0|4.0|PROS: Keeps my CPU at FULL load in the 30 degrees celcius range!!  Its very cheap.  It works with BOTH AMD and Intel mobo's and chipsets.  Its so cool.  I cant hear the fan working inside.    CONS: The directions are pretty crappy.  The one thing they dont tell you is that you need to first put the backplate on the motherboard BEFORE you put the motherboard into the case.  I ended up getting everything put together to find out I had to pull everything apart to get the backplate on the back of the mobo to mount the cooer    OTHER: it's a tad bulky and will probably not work in midtowers.
B004G600A4|5.0|Whats not to like about this movie? The graphics are amazing and the story line was awsome. There is something for everyone in the family in this movie.. even my 15yr old son enjoied watching it with me..check out the mobile above her as a baby..she meets each one of the them through her adventures out of her \\"tower\\"  The only thing I liked better than the movie, was the prestine condition the dvd was in... :)

054531058X|5.0|This is the best series I have ever read.  I have read Harry Potter, Twilight, and The Overlander series, but this book is 1,000,000 times better then all of those combined.  The mix of the bloody action scenes and the romance made me stay up for hours every night reading this series.  Best books I have ever read!!!
0891419063|5.0|I throughly enjoyed reading this book.  The author does a great job of showing us, in vivid detail, the realities of combat.  Reading this book will give you a new appreciation for what our fighting men go through.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I LOVE this workout. I am constantly looking for workouts that push and challenge me. When I put in the effort, I want it to count. Enter Jillian Michaels. You will not be disappointed in this workout. You are up, you are down, you are doing jumping jacks, then lunges, then jogging in place, then abs. She has you working a wide range of muscles constantly. The great thing about this video is that they are easy moves, but difficult to do. You do squats, lunges, jumping jacks, crunches, etc. They aren't moves that are difficult to master, but they work core muscles and they are difficult to do.<br /><br />I haven't gotten passed Level 1 yet. I have been doing it for about 7 non-consecutive days, about every other day. I am waiting to move to Level 2 when I can wake up without any fatigue in my legs. Day 1 was rough, I had to stop a lot and I wasn't able to finish all the moves. However, I pushed through. I was sore the next day, and had to take about 4 days off from it. Day 2 was hard, but I was able to get through a little more of the video. I wasn't as sore the next day. Now, advance to Day 7. I am now able to get through the whole Level 1 just stopping for a second to drink water and continue on. My legs are fatigued the next day, but not sore.<br /><br />I would recommend getting through what you can the first day, and keep doing this. Each time, it will get a little better. Don't beat yourself up and don't quit. Keep working through with the goal to complete the entire Level without having to stop. You will get there! Progess not Perfection, as they say. I think this applies well to this video. I can't tell you how excited I was to get through Level 1 the first time without stopping!
B0000524CY|2.0|Fat too many people slow down for a car wreck.  What is it that they want to see?  Mangled bodies and blood?  Here we have a young girl masturbating with a crucifix and shouting, \\"F*** me!  F*** me!\\" to a priest.  Now if that's your cup of tea, you'll love this movie.  Great performances, excellent atmosphere, and technically proficient, but very sickening.  After watching \\"The Exorcist\\" you may have a desire to take a shower to get clean again.
0156027321|2.0|Life of Pi, in a nutshell, is a story that addresses religion, survival, political intolerance, and life. Before reading this book, ask yourself if you're interested in reading about faith-building and shipwreck. If your answer is yes, then this book is not for you. Pi Patel, the protagonist, participates in three major religions and is perplexed as to why they're viewed as private religions. After the first 100 pages, it's nothing but a boy, a tiger, and 21,000 miles of the Pacific Ocean. The story line is a great idea, but it is too dragged out and gets a bit tiresome since the author's point is being stated repetitively for hundreds of pages. It reads like a survival guide more than anything else, but fails to deliver what it promises. In the beginning, Pi's uncle says, \\"[This book] will make you believe in God.\\" I was not expecting for my belief system to change after reading this, but I was expecting at least some type of disclosure that will get me thinking about religious conviction and principle. Mission failed. Not to mention, it is in no way relatable to the readers! The chances of getting stuck in the middle of the ocean with a tiger as your partner are slim to none. I praise Martel for attempting to write a book that is so different from the others on the shelves, but this story seemed atrocious to me. Evidently, many people found this book to be remarkably beguiling, but I follow into the category that found it uncanny, tedious, and dull.
B003Y5HWJU|5.0|A riveting tale of gangsters and politicians.  With the steely sharpness of a scalpel, the writers and director manage to bring out and dissect, in haunting detail and clarity, issues of good and evil.  They dig deep into the soul and old time religion to bring out a tale that challenges the viewer as much as it does the characters in the story.  This is spellbinding entertainment that for me has created a wholly new interest in the 1930s, much like HBOs \\"Rome\\" created interest for me in that era (if you liked Boardwalk Empire and haven't seen Rome, you're in for another treat).  Don't listen to the naysayers about Boardwalk Empire.  It's not the Sopranos, so don't try to make it that.  But on its own and without need for comparison, this first season of Boardwalk Empire is already heading for a place among gangster classics; and stands as an original and unique addition to that genre.    ...but what did you expect with Scorcese and Sopranos writer Terence Winter in the project?      Empire may take a few shows to convince you of its brilliance and I'll grant it had a weak moment or two in a couple of the beginning episodes. One that comes to mind is The Wire's Michael K Williams (he was \\"Omar\\" in \\"The Wire\\" - another great HBO show) who plays \\"Chalky\\".  I come to like his character later in the show, though his initial entrance comes off too modern with the swearwords and \\"from the 'hood\\" attitude for the time period it's supposed be in.  Later however, he does seem to bring something of an older and different era character to his character.  Likewise for Buscemi's performance.  I wasn't initially convinced he'd pull off this lead role, but as the series continues you come to enjoy and realize he is a perfect \\"Nucky\\".
B001HN6918|5.0|Kung Fu Panda 2 is the much anticipated sequel to the 2008 hit movie. This movie has two plots. The first plot involves an evil peacock named Shen. He threatens to destroy kung fu with a cannon. It is up to Po and Furious Five to save kung fu and stop Shen's evil ways. it is established in the first movie that Po's father is a goose named Ping. A goose can't be the father of a panda. This movie explores Po's roots further and answers the question of what really happened to Po's parents. Po is the dragon master, but he is advised by Master Shi fu to find inner peace. This quest for inner peace gives this film a spiritual quality the first film did not have. Po learns that it does not matter how a panda starts out in life. The important thing to remember how a panda chooses to be and live his life in the present. This lesson can also be applied to people as well.<br /><br />Gary Oldman provides the voice of Shen. His movements are quick and graceful. I love watching Shen move especially in the fight sequences. Oldman's voice work is very good here. Jack Black is equally excellent providing the voice of Po. He is so funny in one scene trying to eat as many dumplings as he can. He is fun to watch fighting wolves or dodging blasts from Shen's cannon. Dustin Hoffman provides the voice of Master Shih Fu. The fun is figuring out who provides the voices of the minor characters like the crocodile and hippo. Every scene of this movie is bright and colorful too. Kung Fu Panda 2 is a very entertaining movie.
B004LWZW24|5.0|Wow, this film was great.  It scared the mess outa me. I LOVED IT!!! I could have sworn that I had already reviewed this film. Oh,well...NE-Wayz, This film is about a sweet American Family with three children -two boys and a baby girl. Everything seems perfect about this family, mom works from home as a song writer, dads wears a suit and works outside the home and all is well in Mayberry. Then the sounds begin. Voices on the babymoniter, doorbells and banging and why is this happening? I dont want to spoil it but this movie is awsome.  One reviewer says this movie works well in the movie theater setting and I would have to agree with that person.  The bangs and the thumps and the hissing and yelling really have an effect with the theater sound system.  My favorite scene in the movie is when the mom is taking out the garbage and the song on the record player changes. Mom walks up to the house and peeks in the window to see... OMG!! You have to see this movie.  Some people didnt like the \\"Ghostbusters\\" but I loved them. They got a little corny, but overall I thought they were a neccessary comic relief (RELIEF being the operative word) this movie gets to the point where it is too scary and we just need a break. The ending picks it up again and I look forward to the sequal... A GOOD SEQUAL por favor.
0671891634|4.0|I recommend this book to those: who are relatively new to the financial / investment arena and are looking for some insight into a sound investment *plan*... and can tolerate some very outdated examples.<br />----------<br />I enjoy Mr. Lynch's insight into what makes a good investment plan and have gathered some very useful information from this book.  I will admit to having to maintain a constant \\"what CAN I get from this example?\\" approach to a majority of the book as it is a bit out-dated.  Then again, *wisdom* is never out-dated... just the parables.<br /><br />Go in with an open mind, a hungry drive, and pluck yourself up some useful tips from a very knowledgeable individual.<br />----------<br />Found it for $1 @ GoodWill.

B004UXUSIM|5.0|Midnight in Paris is the most entaining film I 've seen. It has wit, great story like Cinderella when the clock strikes 12 midnight things really begin to happen.  Great views of Paris, great acting, great story and music ala Django Rheinhart, and most of all Woody Allen is a genius.    I recommend this film for everyone to see. You get your money's worth and then some and leave with a smile.  Del Casher
B004QYZATW|5.0|I rented this video for .99 cents and I definitely would've payed full price to see it in theaters if I had known it was going to be this good. I've seen through a lot of plots by the time the first five minutes have passed in the movie, but this one truly kept me guessing until the end. Depp plays the part of the tourist perfectly, and the twists in this movie put me in a good mood for days. Definitely going to buy this.

B0051QIGP4|1.0|I was one of the many that tried unsuccessfully to download the album the first day it was offered for 99 cents.  I tried multiple times over the course of hours without success.  As we know now, this happened to many customers.  When Amazon Customer Service responded to my request for assistance, they offered to sell the donwload to me again!!  Please help me understand why this could be considered acceptable.
0470932139|5.0|I've been following Helene off and on since she began her \\"Tartelette\\" Blog. I dabble in food styling and photography of food. I wanted to learn more.  This is a book for beginners of photography however, advanced photographers will gain from this. She opens with the very elementary of explanations of photography. Very shortly into the book she gets into the diffusers, showing comparisons in them. Her studio/bedroom is in her home and outside.  Eventually she makes it through composition and angles. Ending with workflow and copyright information. The book is very detailed filled with examples. Well worth the purchase.
B002L9N4DS|5.0|In my opinion, this was one of the best movies ever made, and the acting of  Tom Hanks was genuine and  absolutely superb-I  rank this among my top 10-no doubt.
B000AJIAOO|5.0|Excellent CD.  I am a new listener to Within Temptation, I heard about them on the Internet while looking at other groups.  I am glad that I purchased this cd.  I can listen to it all day and not get tired of.  I went out and bought 3 more CDS from this group.
B002ZG9800|1.0|I was not able to watch the movie as it is in a format that is not compatable for Australian Television sets of for a DVD.
B002ZG983M|5.0|There are a lot of live action comic book movies out there.  Some, like Nolan's Batman movies are deadly serious epics about ethics, corruption, organized crime, etc...  Others, like the Spider-Man franchise with Tobey Maguire, and the Batman movies of Tim Burton, incorporate some humor via dialog and action.  Then there those like Iron Man where the main character itself provides the comedy by trying to be funny in the movie.  But never has there been an absolutely outrageous and hilarious comic-book movie like Kick-Ass.  From start to finish this movie is loaded with laughs of all sorts.  From slapstick action scenes to sarcastic dialog to ludicrous outfits, all accompanied by fast-paced music, this is the funniest comic book movie I have ever seen, and one of the funniest movies released in 2010.  But don't take your children to watch it.  This movie earned its \\"R\\" rating on many counts.  With bad language, some nudity, and a lot of bloody violence, this movie, which features more children than most movies, is certainly adults only.<br /><br />For those wanting to know what this movie resembles, I would answer \\"Kill Bill\\".  Both Kill Bill and Kick-Ass are titled after a male character in the movie, even though the principle character in both movies is female.  In the latter case, it is a pre-teenage girl.  In both Kill Bill and Kick-Ass, it is the female character that has the most action scenes, and the most kills.  And in both movies, most of the main characters have nicknames.  Other common threads are the excessive violence, large body count, gritty action, iconic musical score comprised of pop hits, and the theme of revenge flowing throughout.  Kick-Ass came in the same general time frame as other comedy movies about average people trying to become superheroes, movies such as Super and Defendor.  A sequel is in the works, so it looks like we have a new genre of not-so-superhero movies coming to Hollywood.  Overall, a great movie; and my vote for best comic-book movie of 2010.vie of 2010.

1599218011|1.0|Given the powerful momentum and marketing of the vegetarian culture I expect only critical thinkers w an open mind and little invested in the movement as something passion based vs health based to look into anything I am going to say. This is for those of you that are into health for being healthy to fight disease and to live long enough to enjoy others and be a benefit to those around you. Please check out the Perfect Health Diet. This diet is based on what food is when its inside you NOT what it is before you eat it. Carbs, fats and proteins all change in drastic ways vs what we are told by those that have an agenda other than eating health.     I am not trying to convince anyone of anything. I am offering another viewpoint put together by scientists using a method that with my 22 years of training people and improving their diets works better than any version out there. When there is a better one I was promote that one. I am also not saying dont do this do that. I am saying if you health is worth the price of a book then read the Perfect Health Diet as well. Then if you have questions you can go to their blog and ask the authors questions and talk to others on the diet. please do this just so you have more than one side. Everyone should hear all of the facts. Thank you for taking the time to consider!    [[ASIN:0982720904 Perfect Health Diet: Four Steps to Renewed Health, Youthful Vitality, and Long Life]]

B004DLPXAO|2.0|...the App develops a needed two page display for landscape like the Google Book Reader's display. The weight of the device makes it very uncomfortable to hold in the portrait mode and the width of the display makes reading in landscape mode visually uncomfortable.  As the owner of two Kindles, I am extremely sorry about this, but until this is resolved I will have to make ebook purchases from Google Books.  The App is 5 Star on my HTC EVO and would no doubt make that score for Honeycomb Tablets with the addition of the two page landscape mode.
B004XWLN20|5.0|I started watching Smallville after season 9 was started but I'm the type of person who has to watch things from the beginning, so thats what I did. I went and watched the first 9 season online, then I bought half of them on DVD and now I wish I hadn't. I wish I had know that season 10 would be the last when I bought all the DVDs because I would of waited and got this set it looks amazing. So if you havn't already got the DVDs get this and I will be jealous. [plus the aquaman pilot always wanted to see that]
B004UXUSIM|5.0|As an avid Woody Allen follower (I've seen all of his movies, many numerous times) I am so happy to say something about his this movie that I haven't said in 15 years about his work: I loved it and can't wait to see it again.  It may be his most charming film.  Sure, it doesn't have the depth of \\"Hannah\\"or even \\"Purple Rose,\\" but it sets out to do something and succeeds wonderfully.  It's his best movie since \\"Bullets Over Broadway.\\"
B0044XV684|5.0|I just got this book so I have not made anything yet but I`m giving it five stars anyway. I read through it and the recipes aren`t too complicated and some things do look really delicious(I`m a very picky eater). I like how there are the foods that Harry and his friends eat that we hardly even pay attention to while readung the book and not just the classic dishes like Cauldron Cakes and Pumpkin Pasties, though I still enjoy those very much. I only have this HP cookbook so I cannot compare it to any other ones. However, this book is fabulous and it is worth buying.
0739378112|4.0|The plot was interesting but secondary to the view into Kurt Wallander's mind at 60 years of age.  A wonderfully stark and terrifying end to a fabulous series of books.  You won't forget it.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|I love the book; I love the movie!  Yes, the longer BBC version is wonderful and follows the book more closely, but this movie is outstanding, too! Joe Wright really captures the essence of the book and its characters in such an artistic way! Even the music is phenomenal! I have read and reread every Jane Austen book more times than I care to admit so I am pretty critical of most movie renditions. I would say this version and the BBC version with Colin Firth are my favorites. Make sure you have quiet when you are watching this movie because there are many small details that you need notice. Enjoy.
0385512058|5.0|After reading this book I couldn't decide if Keith Ferrazzi was a networking genius or just another party animal. I finally realized that either way, this book is a winner and no business person who is serious about networking and growing a business should be without it.<br /><br />Ferrazzi is a firm believer in the \\"it's not what you know but who you know\\" adage. Except he goes about telling you how to get to know the \\"who\\" in \\"who you know.\\" He masterfully leverages technology to reach out and touch his contacts in a systematic, yet unobtrusive way that strengthens and reinforces those relationships over time.<br /><br />He also takes maximum advantage of social gatherings to update his rolodex. He'll throw a party for the movers and shakers in his field for just about any reason. In fact, his events are so legendary he's all but guaranteed a stellar turnout every time. I never realized that partying every weekend could be so lucrative.<br /><br />Some may find such assertive behavior a bit unsettling, but from my perspective, timidity in business is the kiss of death. If you're an introvert, you're better off being an accountant, locked away in your 4' x 4' closet with your abacus and sliding rule. Not that I have anything against accountants, I don't, but don't knock the bold and the brave just because you're insecure.<br /><br />This book is a plan of action. Make no mistake about it. If you want to expand your contacts, increase your influence, and create bigger business opportunities for yourself, then do yourself a favor and buy this book.<br /><br />Joe Waynick, Author<br />\\"Internet Bookselling Made Easy!\\" series<br />[...]
B00127RAJY|4.0|This DVD is a great workout. It gets your heart rate up and uses a lot of fantastic workout moves.   A lot of the reviews mention injured knees or soreness while following this DVD, often by people who claim to have been in shape or in good physical condition before they did this DVD. It's important to know your body and the signals it gives when it is being overextended. I personally take an extra 15-20 seconds for each exercise, particularly those that strain the knee, so I can make sure my form is correct and I'm avoiding injury. I also repeat the warm up twice and do a couple more stretches before beginning as the short warm up doesn't work for me.  It's irresponsible to assume that whatever Jillian says on the video is targeted directly for you. As with any workout regimen, you have to modify it to your body and your level of fitness.  The basics are the most important: keep your heart rate up the whole time, be consistent, and don't take breaks. As the video says, if you want to work out for only 20 minutes and see weight loss, breaks are not included.   I give this four stars because it's a great workout but, like all exercise videos, it doesn't spell out that each person needs to customize for their body, which may include adding more time or decreasing the pace.
0374158460|2.0|I chose this book because it was the selection for a book club I just joined. I was excited to be part of the group, and from what I could tell, their past selections were interesting. I know the idea of a club is to expand your reading selection, but I couldn't even finish this book. The characters were all miserable people! It never seemed to get better the further I read and finally, I just had to close the book and leave them pressed together in the pages of their sad lives. I will never know if their lots improved, but mine did, when I switched to another book and left this one in the donation pile.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|It has been a long time since I have heard an album this good.   I am a newcomer to Adele, and so far I am amazed how good she is.

B0047Y17P2|5.0|My first Connelly novel was The Reversal, followed by the Lincoln Lawyer and I am now addicted to the Mickey Haller series and read them all. Connelly's prose is crisp and down to earth and very engaging. He is a master storyteller. I'm somewhat surprised by the number of negative reviews, but to each his own. Also, it's completely unfair and reprehensible to rate the book based on its price.  A book should be rated on its content. Authors spend months and countless hours writing books for us to enjoy and yet people are upset they have to pay $12.99 or whatever.  As a result, many of the Kindle version book reviews here on Amazon are skewed.

B003XF1OJK|5.0|Eric Nuyland has ceated an amazing book and praise him for the amazing work. I was a little dissapointed about how the book wasn`t really realated to the game (Halo: Reach) itself. Otherwise than that, the book was very entertaining and found myself reading it very often. If you enjoyed the book,  recomend reading the book Ghosts of Onyx, also by Eric Nylund. I am looking forward to Eric`s next book, good job!
B00006I53S|5.0|This lens is fantastic! It's a good zoom lens, and a good macro lens. If you need one that will carry you through the day and will take all kinds of pictures, this is the right one. A con of this lens is its weight. Since it is glass, it weights a lot for a lens, and that can get even heavier over a long day. I suggest buying a small backpack to keep your camera in if you are going to use it over a long day. All in all, I am very happy and highly recommend this lens!

B004YEJGEO|5.0|A fun and challenging puzzle game that works great on a touch screen. The problems do get quite complicated, but as you experiment and make adjustments there is a sense of progression that keeps you hooked. Adding to the addiction is the fact that this feels like it is good for your brain; I didn't feel compelled to quit because I was just wasting my time. I'm sure there isn't any actual IQ boost provided by playing this, but it feels cerebral enough to justify spending time with it.
B000001F7R|3.0|The songs are raw and unpolished but sometimes, you just want to hear the band before Mutt Lange sanded off the edges.  I prefer the band once Phil Collen and Steve Clark began dueling their guitars but the oldies are still good to hear.

1594202710|1.0|I have not read this book entirely, but I have managed to read the detailed description of its content as well as some excerption. It is my understanding that if one writes a comment on the main political philosophy and ideas rather than on the anecdotal minutiae of a book, one do not necessarily need to read the book from the first paragraph to the last in order to write a relevant and cogent review. Plus I have read other books of the same author in the past and have known his view and stance on China very well. It didn't surprise me at all after I got myself familiarized with the main idea of this book, Mr. Kissinger remains steadfastly the same old good friend of China placing his obsequious loyalty to China and its leaders above all with all his pretentiously and cloyingly suave words of political whitewashing and deception.<br /><br />With full candor, Mr. Kissinger's knowledge in China, its history and national characters can fairly be described as severely shallow and smattering, with occasions of being outrageously defected and untrue. He has spent lots of words promoting and preaching how peaceful, harmonious and internally-oriented a people the Han-Chinese (the majority ethno mammoth in china making up more than 90% in population and dominant in all aspects of national life from politics to economy to culture) are, which, unfortunately, runs exactly to the opposite of the truth. Despite ostensible and superficial gesturing and posturing of peace and friendship which the Chinese are super adept and adroit at feigning with a super-developed propaganda flair unrivaled on earth which it has spent hundreds of years to hone and whet to almost perfection, in effect the Chinese has always remained a very expansive and aggressive people throughout its own history. Where their nasty tentacles could reach, rulers of all different dynasties in the history of the Han-Chinese have openly advocated and practiced a bare-buckled racialist and discriminatory doctrine and polices to invade, oppress, exploit and trample the land, life and rights of various minority nationalities including the Tibetan, the Mongol, the Uygur, the Hui Muslim, the Manchurian in the North, Northwest and Northeast as well as numerous smaller ethnicities in the Southwest, to conquer them by either brute force or ruses and subterfuges and include them into the ever expanding Han-Chinese empire which originally only inhabited an area less than one fifth of the territorial expanse of today's China.<br /><br />The minorities were mostly subordinated to a miserable subjugation under the intensely oppressive and exploitative rule of the Han Chinese whose invasion into the areas of minority nationalities around it always adopted a pattern of following military aggression with armed paramilitary and massive civilian settlement of others' lands by taking advantage of its own much larger population and better tools than the owners of their native lands. This is so, of course, in the most cases when the Han-Chinese was strong and relatively less occupied with internal conflictions. In the rest of cases when it was internally unstable, afflicted by either major natural or artificial problems, it chose to deceive and swindle its way through with such acts as frivolous awards, grants and bribes, as well as patronizingly marrying a usually phony imperial princess to local chieftains to continue its expansionist agenda and enlarge its tyrannical control to foreign territories in such a less conspicuous fashion of gradual encroachment. Since the founding of the red China in 1949, the regime has adopted a escalated racially and culturally intrusive and destructive policy towards minority nationalities in neighborhood to the Han-Chinese land including major ethnicities such as the Tibetan, the East Turks and the Inner Mongolian with forcible annexation by armed forces and has conducted unspeakable crimes of ethnic cleansing, cultural and religious destruction and forced assimilation. The oppressed and brutalized peoples of the minor nationalities, especially the Uygur and the Tibetan, have put up heroic resistance against the Chinese aggression but were met with bloody crackdowns of the Chinese government, resulting in countless unknown atrocities. The latest turmoil of massive protest in Inner Mongolia about a week ago, triggered by a deliberate and callous murder of a Mongolian farmer at the hand of Chinese real estate developer, witnessed the volcanic eruption of the pent-up rage of Mongolians, a largely docile and obedient ethnic group compared with the fiery Uygur and Tibetan, whose fury and indignation toward the Chinese have reached the limit after decades of land plundering, resource depletion, environmental degradation, rampant corruption, relentless exploitation and sheer human rights abuses brought by massive Chinese emigration into the land of their ancestry. This is a plain truth backed by undeniable evidence as known to most people in today's world with basic education and a decent conscience and thus need no more verbose explanation from this writer.<br /><br />Mr. Kissinger tries to corroborate his claim of a largely peaceful and non-provocative and unassertive nature of the Chinese even in most historical time so as to justify his claim that China will remain so even under the current picture of its enormous economic development and the evident and conspicuous military expansion and increasingly assertive stance on the international stage. This however couldn't be further from truth and only revealed the staggering fallacy and ignorance if not the ulterior motive of Mr. Kissinger and his supporters in advancing their relentless China-appeasing and glorification for personal fame and gain. It is true that the Chinese empire has largely ignored the rest of world and posed little material threat to the West in its various past feudal dynasties as claimed by many panda-hugging China-researching scholars in the West, being either irremediably infantile or dedicatedly apologetic for China or both. However this claim by no means serves as a sound and tenable defense of the so-called \\"peaceful\\" and \\"non-aggressive\\" nature of Chinese as a nation. In fact, the contrary is true, and getting ever truer with the passing of time into this age of Chinese neo-imperialism.<br /><br />In its long history, China has lived largely in its own world besides not infrequent invasion and incursion into surrounding areas with a relative reclusion to the Western world in old times mostly because it has managed to stay self-sufficient and self-sustained throughout most of its history, and its rulers have had an inexorable mental complex of inherent and inveterate cultural egotism on its own and misgiving on alien cultures and thoughts from faraway which they worried would permeate into their own society and cause unnecessary trouble to their iron-clad rule of absolutism. That being said, however, no nation could ever remain and would either want to remain eternally unchanged. After a state of indifference and unconcern for the outside world of a thousand year or so, China has every reason to be tired of this old state of monotonous continuity and want an approach drastically new, having experienced the so-called humiliation at the hands of Western powers with strong and indelible sense of stigma forever stamped in the minds most Chinese rancorously and spitefully, and further stoked up by cunning and ruthless dictatorial regime to serve their ulterior motive of maintaining an iron grip on power who was shrewd enough to sense the ideological demise of communism and thus moved quickly to promote incessantly and strenuously an anti-West chauvinist ultra-nationalism in the last twenty years in the Chinese society and spoon-feed the Chinese masses with poisonously vindictive and vengeful agitations of resentful jingoism and hegemonic ambitions for the exciting and galvanizing scenario of a resurgent Chinese empirebringing the West down to their collective knees and dominating the whole world as the new regal and reigning king. Realizing this ultimate strategic goal rests on playing on the greed of unvigilant, selfish and myopic Western transnational businesses to get China more rich and powerful together with continuing to agitate nationalist sentiment and cultivating such a militaristic and excitable social ambience domestically among the emotional and easily manipulated Chinese masses, the regime reckons it will be thus be able to cling to its absolute power perpetually. This is the most prominent guidance and policy the Chinese rulers have been adhering to and practicing internally and on the world stage ever since the failed student uprising in 1989 when the regime astutely perceived the utter failure of the old Communist doctrine as a leading ideology and deftly shifted to foster and enlist the magical power of ultra-nationalism and Chinese supremacy as a new central rallying voice in the land after having bathed the students in blood pool with tanks and bullets.<br /><br />Under Deng, the superbly insightful and ambitious supreme leader of China made up his mind to pursue as China's top priority the strategic path of strengthening China by feigning innocence and modesty and winning Western cooperation and appeasement in the late 1970s soon after it had recovered and straightened itself politically form the devastating cultural revolution, Chinese started to really devote itself to the cause and made assiduous and sedulous effort to empowering and strengthening itself materially and comprehensively enriching and consolidating its inner strengths by using the useful idiots and proxies like Mr. Kissinger and his disciples in the West and in the mean time teaching and brainwashing its own people to hate the West and prepare a revenge war energetically and patiently. Thirty years of deliberate and dedicated effort has born great fruits and produced magnificent and astonishing effects primarily as a result of their skillful and cunning utilization of Western capital and technology via both Western investment and its hyper-active industrial espionages at all level and by all imaginable and unimaginable means to grow and advance itself. Due to such unprecedented determination and concentration of purposive effort and the seamless execution thanks to China's scheming resourcefulness and the stunning naivety and myopia of the West, China has been able to maintain a double-digit military budget growth for more than 20 years annually along its premeditated planning based on its flamboyant economic growth.<br /><br />Having far exceeded the scope and degree of its deceptively claimed purpose of self-defense, the Chinese military power and prowess at present has already reached the second position in the world, only after the US, with an seemingly unstoppable momentum to catch and surpass US in a not distant future. China has already proved itself an extremely potent threat to the world peace and existing global order as well the most dangerous existential enemy to America more than patently and evidently with its numerous open swashbuckling and browbeating including direct threatening to nuke half continental US West of Chicago if US dares to stand in its way by defending Taiwan against potential Chinese military attack, a remark made by the visiting Chinese military brass General Zhu to his US counterpart about ten years ago (the Chinese could only have become more rampantly and flagrantly daring with its continuous economic and military empowerment in last ten years thanks to its rapacious trade with US siphoning off wealth and high-techs from US endlessly under the consent and active cooperation of the wretched and treasonous American political and economic establishment elected and given a free run by the Americans themselves). The Chinese arrogance, pugnacity and bellicosity has also been constantly manifest in its repeated and blatant military provocation at Japan, its constant and growing military threat to Taiwan and attrition with India, its purposeful and masterminding role in global nuclear proliferation and environmental degradation and unending moral and material support to all Anti-US and anti-West human rights-trampling and/or genocide-practicing rogue states in the world from North Korea to Iran to Sudan to Zimbabwe and so on.<br /><br />Meanwhile, inside the Chinese society, the hateful and hideous anti-West mind-control and indoctrination campaign has also reaped great achievements with a new generation of Chinese youth submerged in a twisted and sadistically and exorbitantly militant culture zealously and meticulously cultivated in years and bombarded by ubiquitous media with contents of the most sensational and draw-dropping belligerence. One of the thought-provoking and alarming scenes in China's publication circle is an overflowing presence of anti-West, war-trumpeting, ultra-militant and minatory tabloid newspapers prevalent in the newspaper stands in most China's cities including the capital Beijing. They exist in such a glaring way and pervasive extent that let alone Chinese, even a foreigner with a modest understanding of the Chinese language and certain curiosity and observing eyes will easily perceive this obvious phenomenon. These tabloids are more than indecent and irresponsible to any person who is sane, as what they are carrying and trumpeting are nothing but articles calling for swift and ferocious military actions to annex Taiwan and shouting exhortations in the most saber-rattling and chest-pounding fashion for wars with the evil Japan, India and US aggressors etc. for the ultimate survival and ascendancy of the great Chinese nation with such precipitous and unscrupulous titles and most brutally dishonest, wicked and lurid contents that reminisce if not actually eclipse Nazi propaganda in the Third Reich era. Anyone who is understood of China's ironclad government control and censorship of public media including all publications, big or small, can only wonder how such newspapers so openly and hysterically war-mongering, so disgusting and so exceedingly dangerous and distorting to receptive and malleable minds of youngsters could have appeared so prevalently in the streets everywhere without the government notice and actually its full consent, encouragement and purposely instruction.<br /><br />The specious and spurious argument of Mr. Kissinger based on his flawed knowledge and selective application goes on unabated. For example, he claimed in the book with his shoddy and smattering knowledge, that the communist rule in China is essentially ineluctable as linked with the intrinsic authoritarian and patriarchal tradition in the Chinese pattern of civilization from ancient time to today, and thus is not particularly reprehensible or condemnable and should be understood and accepted tacitly by the West. But in fact the communist ideology was a foreign import from Russia in the wake of Leninist Russian communist revolution combined with the exceptional personal inhumanness and cruelty of Mao who has for his life time put the grasping and consolidation of absolute power before anything else including the life and happiness of his family and his women, let alone common Chinese people whose collective life he has all along dismissed as little more than that of a worm to be readily sacrificed any time he wanted. The result was an overall death toll of Chinese in peace time caused by massive political persecution and man-made agricultural disasters under Mao's willfully destructive anti-human policies which doubled the combined number of those died under Hitler and Stalin. If as Mr. Kissinger declared that China's modern political system would rightly fit in the category of being a continuation of its patriarchal and Confucius feudal tradition, what we are witnessing now would have been a typical traditionalist style and patriarchal ruling system as existed in Taiwan before 1980s of Chiang Kai-shek, the former Nationalist Kuomintang leader and his son or a similarly authoritarian but somehow more modern and better known government system of the famous president Lee and his son of today's Singapore but never the satanically anti-human Mao who didn't ever treat any other people as human being, his successor Deng who ordered the cold-blooded massacre of student demonstrators in the central square of Beijing in 1989 without a blink as well as the succeeding Jiang, the current Hu and the predicted next supreme leader Xi who has been close to the political and ideological hard line and will most probably maintain and even further tighten the internally freedom suppressing and externally expansionist and intimidating policies in line with their well-known long standing political stances and actual conducts.<br /><br />Exactly because of the toxic and noisome existence of such unprincipled and spineless figures like Mr. Kissinger and other high-ranking American political elites in charge of foreign diplomacy and a large number of so-called \\"China Hand\\" prominent intellectuals dominating the China Study domain in major American universities, institutions and think-tanks and exercising a great influence in the circle in more than last half a century, the same group of people who have always taken a set of pink-colored glasses to observe China (the truths and facts be damned!), all the major policies US has taken regarding China and Chinese issues have been a consistent and abject failure since the end of the WWII for basing themselves on starry-eyed fantasy rather than the unpleasant yet sober reality. Constantly beguiled and befuddled by the cunning regime feigning a pro-American posturing with sugar-coated sanctimonies starting from such incident as the official Xinhua Daily featuring on the front page such nauseatingly fawning and fraudulent propagandistic slogans like \\"Long Live America! Happy Birthday to You!\\" in its July 4th special edition in 1945 (a far cry from their diabolic anti-American stance after they assumed the reins in 1949) under the historical background of a triumphant Chinese communist party eager to wrestle the controlling power from the nationalist government after the defeat of Japan where the communist realized the importance to curry favor with US with feigned affinity of democratic value and to alienate the relationship of the Chinese government and US, an alliance forged and tested in the joint war against Japan, the US political and diplomacy circles have not even for once got China right in its dismal analysis and judgment on China from that distant time of 70 years ago to today. The image of China as a country and a collective nation has remained invariably a harmless and benign panda instead of a fire-spitting, flesh-munching dragon albeit which comes much closer to the hidden reality than the former. It is a painful yet undeniable truth that US has rendered significant aids and supports to the Chinese communist after the surrender of Japan, a betrayal of its ally in hardship the Nationalist Kuomintang and its leader Chiang which resulted in the latter's eventual defeat and retreat from the mainland China at the hands of the communist who has ever since dominated China and ruled with barbaric terror and brutality internally and anti-American stance and policies externally causing tremendous troubles to America in Korea in 1950s and Vietnam in 1960s and 1970s, troubles that could have been avoided and precluded otherwise had US been wise and sober enough to resist the communist enticement and stood firm with its tested old ally in China.<br /><br />After the breakout of the Korean War and the rampant Chinese armed intervention, US had a chance to nuke China as it did to Japan to totally terminate the commie tyranny and build a new democratic and free China subsequently hence end the communist nightmare once and forever had it followed theadvice of General McArthur (the Soviets didn't yet have nukes then), but instead the half-hearted and indecisive Truman fired McArthur and blinked first and squandered the best chance of driving a deadly stake into the chest of the hideous monster before it grew stronger. Then came the Nixon's strategic blunder of the first rate to approach and reconcile with China under the consideration of offsetting the Soviet, an understandable but certainly not the only option and was unnecessary in effect. The move however opened the Pandora's Box and invited endless troubles for it opened the door of US assisting and enabling an arch evil and monster which could fairly be rated as much more problematic and life-threatening by historians of future generations in the West (if the West still exists in the day of overall China hegemony on earth brought into life by the West itself). To relate the story after that would be a repeat of my already exhaustively explained content, but the gist is certainly a senselessly self-defeating of aiding and strengthening America's biggest potential challenger and adversary by the big business community and their political bed fellows, while the American working class with their continual job losses and sinking actual income have become their largest sacrifice, the totally expendable ones in those elites' eyes together with the whole nation being put at increasing peril by such viciously erosive act of back-stabbing. Alas, the American people have really been cheated and shrouded in the dark all the time by the unpatriotic and treacherous political and business elites of this country driven only by pure greed in total disregard of the nation's future as a whole and the crime they perpetrated against the nation and their fellow citizens is indeed ugly and atrocious as to deserve the severest punishment.<br /><br />Presumptuously self-anointed \\"realists\\" like Mr. Kissinger have in fact never been realistic but lived all along in a self-delusional fairy land whose only consciousness lies in always putting self-aggrandizement as ones' top priority above anything else including one's inner conscience and loyalty to ones' sworn duties and commitment to ones' nation. To save America and our future generations from complete subjection to China and the possible conquest and enslavement from the latter in less than half a century from now, we must first thoroughly and unsparingly debunk and discredit figures like Mr. Kissinger whose incorrigible panda-hugging and shilling for China derived from a convinced and most despicable vanity and venality. The panda-panderer-in-chief and his detestable company deserve to be tried for treason, tarred, feathered and pilloried if America is to awaken itself in time and wrestle her future fate back to her own hands from such dark and ignoble souls. Second, with an overwhelming public opinion uniting behind a strong will to fight and prevail over the Chinese aggression, it is imperative that US must first regain its economic independence and self-reliance from the present overdosed addiction to China's imports which only served to weaken America's base and strengthen China's. US must act at once to end the ridiculous and economically suicidal free trade practice with China negotiated by political traitors' clique under the guidance of Mr. Kissinger and his political disciples which has served only to subsidize China and bankrolling its expansion at the expense of crucial national interest of US. US must act now to rebuild itself in a noble and necessary spirit of self-reliance and to overcome the ill and nefarious over-dependence on Chinese junks and stop subsidizing China and denying this pernicious and malevolent beast and arch-rival the opportunity of further piling up its foreign reserve largely built in US dollar and using it as a potent leverage to obtain the most valuable American high-techs and hijack the US foreign policy on China, and therefore pulling America back from the edge of the cliff which leads nowhere but to the ever deepening decline and debasement towards serfdom and subjection to China and America's perdition as a sovereign nation eventually.<br /><br />It all boils down to the substantive and everlasting issue of the big power rivalry, a timeless and solid issue eternally relevant and significant as long as there are different human entities on earth. Please consider this last bottom line question with your primal instinct: how is the strengthening of a universally acknowledged potential archrival good to the interest of America? How possibly can the merit of that process, even if there might be any, outweigh its huge demerit? America has little to gain and lots to lose in substance in face of a powerful and ambitious China. I'd bet on the veracity of this statement of mine with my life. The good thing is that the seemingly swelling and swaggering China is but a paper tiger, a parasitic beneficiary indeed of the grievously mistaken and misguided US political and trade policy sucking all the time on the tits of the wealth and techs of the West for fuel and nutrition. The seemingly unstoppable Chinese juggernaut can easily be held at bay and terminated only if the West and especially US has the WILL. But we must act soon or the Frankenstein will grow too big and violent and rampage out of control. My words may be hard but my heart is sincere. As the proverb goes, Good medicines though bitter can cure, candid words though harsh can correct. Wake up and act, Americans! Don't wait until it's too late, and don't say you were not warned.blications, big or small, can only wonder how such newspapers so openly and hysterically war-mongering, so disgusting and so exceedingly dangerous and distorting to receptive and malleable minds of youngsters could have appeared so prevalently in the streets everywhere without the government notice and actually its full consent, encouragement and purposely instruction.

1594202842|1.0|Chua is a really miserable human being disguising her abusive tactics behind the 'results' it creates.  She attempts to forgo criticism by hiding behind ethnicity, but the reality is that Chua comes off as an abused child who has completely bought the abuse and is now is inflicting it on her own children to justify it.  The pity is that she's withdrawn into a state of denial and ego-inflation that nothing that a rational person could say would break her of that conditioning.    \\"My children are geniuses at this because of my tactics!\\"  No, they're suffering from Stockholm Syndrome because their mother is freaking out over small things.  Chua reveals her abuse and denial of it throughout the book and uses accomplishments--not done out of passions but of fear--to show that the abusive means leads to favorable ends.  The ends, however, are Chua's own goals.  Since her children's feelings are not worth examining, it's a victory by exclusion all around.    This book does have a point.  It shows the rationalizations that occur when someone takes abuse so much to heart that it makes them an abuser as well.  This book shows that repressive environments (often excused by 'tradition') destroy humans and turn them into monsters.  I feel for Chua's children, and her grandchildren.  The cycle of abuse will probably continue.

B002G1YPH0|5.0|I just finished installing my Hyper212 in my HAF922 case, on a gigabyte 890GX mobo running an AMD Phenom II 1090t cpu.  It was kind of a pain to install.  With my case, I could have theoretically installed it from the other side without a total take-down, but gravity was not out to help.  So I took the mobo out, laid it flat, and installed the new mounting brackets, and then set it all back up.  I did add a second fan to the other side of the unit for a pull-push effect to blow the air right into one of the case exhaust fans.<br /><br />It is a large unit, and pre-measuring your available space is a must.  Any bad reviews based on it being too big for their case is someone who didn't check the clearly stated dimensions against their available space.  My only concern was my RAM clearance (since the slots rest close to the socket), but a little algebra (using the fan dimensions and the overall dimensions) told me I would be fine.<br /><br />It is very effective.  It knocked 5 - 10 degrees off my temp readout (using CoreTemp software).  I recommend this to anyone who wants to get more cpu cooling without wading (get it?) into liquid cooling.
B00466HM28|5.0|Let me start off by saying, I've been playing piano for a little under a year now but have been producing music for a few years.     This unit is great at the price point, I got it here at amazon a few months ago for about 68 dollars. It slides into my backpack along with my laptop and is quite sturdy considering I bring it with me everywhere I go and that it's made out of plastic. The keys are small, but that's to be expected due to it's portability; but the keys are responsive, pressure sensitive, have a decent feel, and a nice aftertouch to them. The MPC-like pads are similar in responsiveness as the keys and are comparable to the MPC at our studio and my personal MPD32. As said before, it is a plastic, toyish-feeling product; but it is very rugged. It may be toy-like, but armed with a nice DAW and some great VSTs, it becomes quite a playable keyboard. Not performance worthy of course, but still quite impressive.    That being said, It's absolutely wonderful for on-the-go production, but the usb cord build isn't as solid as I'd like it to be. The unit I have is actually the second I received from amazon. The first lasted about 24 hours. As I plugged in the cord it pushed the female connecting pins back inside of the unit making the unit inoperable (the gap is too small to repair it yourself, and I'm not a fan of opening up brand new electronics). Amazon accepted my return and sent me another, so I kept the knowledge of being careful with the cord in the back of my head. Well just yesterday, I had a similar problem. I went to plug it in and this time it was the male end that had the pins pushed back. Luckily I'm a tech junkie and have plenty of spares. I realize this is a small problem and will not reflect it in my rating of the product, this is just for fellow musician awareness. I googled the issue and didn't find anything on the issue, so I hope this helps someone out there to be aware that a little gentleness will be involved in keeping the usb's life expectancy numbers up.    A pitch and mod wheel would be nice also, maybe a future build will bring those, though I can map those to a dial so it's not too big of an issue to me. As far as a sustain pedal considering the size of the unit, you won't be banging out too many two handed chords with this thing so the sustain button works just fine. Plus if you're handy with your DAW software, you can add-in/edit your sustained notes at will.    But to wrap this up, it's a great, inexpensive, and portable unit that (in the right hands), can be a powerful addition to your portable production needs.     Personal rating 4.5

B000JMKRKC|2.0|I received this book as a gift from a friend who worked for one of the big book stores at the time.  I was delighted at the thoughtful gift because I am an avid reader; however, half-way through the book, I was sorry I'd begun reading it.  The story seemed overly dramatic, predictable, and at times clich&eacute;d. I sold the book back to a different book store shortly after finishing it, and felt just a little bit guilty about putting it out there for someone else to be disappointed in.

B004DLPXAO|4.0|At first, I didn't know how I would like reading an electronic book, but when I got an Android phone, I decided to test the Kindle app. It is awesome! Some of the highlights for me are:<br /><br />1. Take an entire library with you wherever you go. I hate waiting and reading keeps me occupied.<br />2. Instant gratification. I want that book now. No problem!<br />3. Read in bed without annoying your significant other with the light on.<br />4. If you have the Kindle app on multiple devices, it will sync to where you left off last.<br />5. Don't know the meaning of a word, click on it to get the definition instantly.<br />5. The highlight and note taking features are also cool. You can to back and search your notes.<br /><br />The one thing that I don't like is that when I zoom in on charts or graphs in the book, it gets larger, but is totally blurred so I can't read and since I do most of my reading on my phone, that sucks. I am not sure if that is a Kindle issue or a publisher issue.
B002G1YPH0|4.0|I picked up this fan because $30 is worth having a cool processor, and this fan keeps my processor way cold. I have an AMD Phenom II, quad core, and with this set up my processor doesn't go over 45c. My only complaints are: 1.) The setup took me a half hour to install. It did require taking out the standard mount, which has bolts on top and nuts underneath. This means you need to remove the standard mount before you install the motherboard in order to use their mount. 2.) Secondly, this heatsink is the size of a grapefruit.  Because of this, my ram wouldn't fit in the slots nearest the processor. I am not using these right now, so it's not a problem, but I don't know what I'd do if I decide to upgrade.

1401307450|4.0|I read this book because I have an addict son. I read everything I can about drug addiction, drug addict artists, effects of drugs on the individual and the family and friends.  It is excellent in describing Anthony's long journey beginning at a very young age his incredibly hard journey with drug addiction. I liked the RHCP but that's not the reason I read this book.  It is a book of hope to me.  Anthony's struggles will resonate with anyone who is an addict, IF they can see themselves, but especially families of addicts who suffer as much as the addict. Congrats for making it Tony.  I know that it was alot of luck you survived but I'm so glad you are well and alive to help others.  If you made it, then I believe my son (and his other addict friends) can make it too. Thanks for the hope.
B004DNWPY4|4.0|I was referred this book by a friend who is a very successful entrepreneur. I highly recommend it to everyone, especially those who live a high-consumption lifestyle.    I have always been pretty frugal and reluctant to pay for anything that I didn't think I would get full value out of, so a lot of the book's advice seemed natural to me, and am not surprised to learn that there are many frugal millionaires. It was more surprising though to find how many high-income earners so freely spend all of their money, and I think this book is most useful for them.    However, this book has helped keep me grounded, as I just graduated college and have a well-paying job, and I was definitely getting excited to spend more and throw out some of my frugal habits. I also found some very valuable insights, such as being a meticulous and avid investor, treating one's income/spending as a business where profit is the goal, maintaining a detailed budget, setting clear goals for oneself, and how to raise one's kids.    I give it four only because it's not a very entertaining read, and some parts seem a little repetitive. The knowledge gained though is extremely valuable, for some more than others.
1932100660|5.0|So much great information, presented in a logical and credible (not to mention well researched) way.  Definitely a life changer.  If you don't go completely vegan you'll at least cut way back on the animal products.
B0034G4P80|5.0|Guilty as charged - I go to the movies for a sense of escapism and \\"Thor\\" did not disappoint me.  The Norse tales are all built on perception and Branaugh took the challenge and made something both entertaining and a tribute to a bygone age - at least for me, he gave Norse mythology and folklore a whole new dimension.      The dialog is solid.  Thor is believable - if you choose to - and his \\"friends\\" display a solid chemistry, as well as loyalty, that has you cheering when the good guys win.  And yes - I did cheer.  Nothing quite like a good story that reaches out and pulls you in.    But don't listen to the critics, or to me - go see it for yourself and decide for yourself.    I am excited at the prospects of the DVD release.
B002G1YPH0|5.0|This cooler didn't fit my good ole' CoolerMaster WaveMaster case. I have the side panel loosely on. One would think that it would be compatible with their own cases regardless of how old it is. I can live with it though because this cooler is amazing.     I had a stock intel cooler installed on a Q6600(B3) and my temps were @ ~32c(idle), ~60c (load). After installing the Hyper 212+, temps are near ~24c (idle) and ~50c (load). The reason I got this cooler was to overclock. Right now, I'm at 3.0GHz. Worth the money.     Btw, I ran Prime95, the highest temp is ~65. If I tried running it with the stock cooler, it would probably get over 80c.
B000I2J6K0|4.0|It was hard to find a prenatal workout that included cardio, but after reading many reviews on several products on here, I decided to go with Erin O'Brien's  The first couple of times I tried it I was a little disappointed bc I didn't feel like I got much of a workout.  However, after I learned what moves were coming up, I wasnt wasting time watching what she was doing and could get every rep in, which helped a lot. I wouldn't consider this intense cardio, but it does raise my heart rate and gets me a little winded. I was used to doing the Insanity workout, and continued with it until 21 weeks. However, it got too difficult and many of the moves are dangerous that far into pregnancy, so this workout was a welcome relief. It is a good mix of cardio, strength, and flexibility moves, and the 40 minutes go by quickly because you're never doing the same move for long. I'm looking forward to getting back into my more intense workouts postpartum, but am enjoying this one for the next 14 or so weeks.

B004K4AUZW|5.0|Before hearing this album I was sceptical about \\"Mother Monster\\" being able to deliver material equaling or even bettering the content of \\"Fame Monster\\". I discovered that \\"Born this Way\\" made for addictive listening...so much that I cannot think of any album at this time that delivers so flawlessly. In addition to this artist's stunning vocals, the musical arrangement is impressive especially on her more up-beat tracks. If she continues in this vein she would be a worthy successor to Madonna should Madonna retire from recording. Only time will tell if she will be able to match Madonna's longaevity, or whether she will be able to successfully re-invent herself as Madonna has done so frequently to sustain the interest of her listening market.    Even at the age of 46 I couldn't resist becoming a \\"Little Monster\\"!    JANSEN (NYC)

B0049JPU8A|4.0|When I listen to this album, a lot of the lyrics has to deal with relationships sometimes when things are not working, sometimes when are done and sometimes when they are fine. It's a great sophomore for The Script. I like the whole album and has good tracks.
B004EPZ06G|3.0|Full-disclosure: I thought the first Hangover movie was among the best in its class.<br /><br />I remember comparing it favorably to \\"Old School\\" and \\"American Pie\\" when I encouraged friends to see it.<br /><br />But, let's call a spade a spade.<br /><br />Part II would have been more aptly named \\"Part 2.0\\" because it is essentially a re-imagining of the first movie.<br /><br />Additionally, nothing of note happens until the \\"Wolfpack\\" gets to Thailand one-third of the way through the film.<br /><br />With this having been said, there are a few really cool moments -- such as Alan's (Zach Galifanikis) flashback that tells you everything you need to know about how he views the world; a hilarious version of Billy Joel's \\"Allentown\\" with poignantly-disturbing lyrics provided by Stu (Ed Helm) and some rather shocking disclosures toward the end of the movie involving a bad night in a strip club and a dismembered finger.<br /><br />This movie would have been a classic if it had been the only \\"Hangover\\" film ever released. But, it suffers in comparison to its predecessor.<br /><br />I would compare it to a DJ remixing an already perfect song. It may be interesting to listen to. But, honestly, you'd rather he played the original version and left well-enough alone.<br /><br />Yes, Hollywood, sometimes, less is more.
B004DI7HZ6|4.0|First of all, I need to get a couple of things out of the way:<br /><br />1) $14.99 is way too much to pay for an e-book (especially one that can't be lent). I bought it anyway only because I had some credit remaining after receiving a Mother's Day giftcard. This is the costliest e-book I've purchased and I will not spend so much again.<br /><br />2) There are a few too many descriptions of the heroine's outfits. How many black turtlenecks and yoga pants can one historian own?!<br /><br />OK, now I'll share the good. A Discovery of Witches is a clever, entertaining read with an interesting premise. Decades of repressed magic, an enchanted book, witches/daemons/vampires and an ancient, secret society all figure in the plot at appropriate places. The story is mostly a romance, though--laid against a backdrop of growing supernatural conflict. The supporting characters are well-sketched out, and humor is sprinkled here and there to great effect. I did find the continued attacks on the protagonist and subsequent rescuing by Matthew wearing a little thin, but overall I enjoyed this book and will look for the sequel (but wait for the price to drop along with the release of the paperback).
B001QUL73W|5.0|When it first appeared, this recording woke the world up to the gifts of Vasily Petrenko, now 34, a boyish Russian who has by now put the Royal Liverpool PO on the map. Now the Oslo Phil. has signed him up as music director, and everyone expects that one of the major orchestras will come calling sooner rather than later. In every respect Petrenko displays his charisma in this, the opening salvo of a complete Shostakovich symphony cycle, but more importantly he redeems some mighty claptrap in the process.<br /><br />To me, the Shostakovich 11th, premiered in 1957, is a suspiciously mawkish tribute to the innocent citizens mowed down by the Czar's Cossacks in the bitter cold of January, 1905. The music is programmatic and as easy to follow as a Hollywood soundtrack -- we witness historical tableuax from the first public gathering at dawn in Palace Square, St. Petersburg to the massacre, a period of mourning, and then the wild ringing of the tocsin that sounds the promise of a victorious future, i.e., the October Revolution of 1917. It's always uncomfortable when Shostakovich does his duty as a loyal Soviet artist-- a \\"people's composer\\" -- and it helps only somewhat that he later told interviewers that this work, although supposedly a paean to revolutionary glory, was actually a covert criticism of Moscow's brutal suppression of the Hungarian uprising of 1956.<br /><br />However it's sliced, the Shostakovich 11th is problematic musically, needing a great deal of help to get beyond its rum-tum depiction of patriotic blood and tears. Petrenko succeeds through a combination of incisiveness and serious intent. He doesn't cheapen the movie music, and he looks past the propaganda value of the score to the human sacrifice that lies beyond, for both the victims of 1905 and the composer.  I've noticed that post-Soviet Russian conductors like Gergiev seem eager to minimize the very qualities that saved Shostakovich's skin repeatedly -- the easy-listen tunes, the visceral bombast, the patriotic rhetoric.  Petrenko falls into this trend, and I'm happy to say that on that account this is one of the least sleazy Shostakovich Elevenths I've ever heard; I believe in the conductor's attempt to find nobility in the music.  I wouldn't rank it above Gergiev's recent account -- the two reach the same high standard, with Petrenko scoring on thrills at the close.hetoric.

B0051BVQFG|5.0|I was hoping this would not be a movie like skyline which maden it seem like it was going to be a good scifi but bombed, was pleased this movie turn out to be such a great movie, like the way the military was shown in this movie from the stand point of a rifle platoon fighting in urban combat never giving up and ensuring that the civilians they rescued stay safe. Special effects were of the mind blowing kind, if your a scifi fan that likes a movie where there is good plot line and lots of \\"HOLY SMOKE\\" special effects, Battle LA is a must see movie and a must have in your DVD collection.

1400052173|4.0|What an eye opener.  We can see how far we have come since 1951.  This women saved many lives and if it wasn't for this diligent author no one would know what she did for the WORLD.  The injustices of that time and the advances in medicine.    Sometimes the book was repetitive but on the whole it was a great read.
0446563048|3.0|When I told people that I was currently reading a book on the start of Zappos.com, the response was always the same: \\"Why?\\" I'm not exactly sure what interested me in this book, but I found it in the thrift store, and I was eager to read it. Aside from theology, my favorite topic to read is the history and evolution of the computer industry. Reading a book on how an online shoe store became a powerhouse retailer seemed to be perfect.<br /><br />This book is part autobiography of Tony Hsieh and part how-to-be-a-leader book (a genre that I usually try to avoid). I enjoyed reading the start of young Tony with his entrepreneurial endeavors and accidental encounters that led him to Nick Swinmurn, the owner of a business called shoesite.com, which then transformed into what we now know as Zappos.com. Tony's dedication to Zappos (even when business logic told him it is a losing proposition) was inspiring. It made me want to buy shoes at Zappos.<br /><br />Before you readers get too inspired and leave this review to buy the new Nike Frees, I want to give what annoyed me most about this book: Tony Hsieh himself. He is an arrogant, condescending, and strange man. He is smarter and richer than you, and he makes sure you know this. He loves to refer to his friends as his \\"tribe\\" (so annoying), and tells of the epiphany he has in a rave. (Tony makes it clear that he liked raves before they were popular). Somehow, that trippy experience inspired him to provide excellent customer service.<br /><br />Hsieh pontificates how amazing the Zappos culture is, and, frankly, I don't care. While I appreciate good customer service, let's keep in mind that they are selling shoes, not running the United Nations.

0385474547|4.0|Things Fall Apart tells the story of the Ibo tribe in Nigeria around the late 1800s. Okonkwo is one of the leaders in the tribe, admired for his strength and courage. He has many negative characteristics as well, particularly through our twenty-first century eyes: he is prideful, impatient with his son's \\"manliness,\\" and he is violent to his wives. The main story is how the tribe reacts when European missionaries come to the village on their \\"iron horses\\" (bicycles). Okonkwo is faced with either acceptance or violence.<br /><br />One of the most powerful scenes occurs early in the book when a slave boy from a neighboring village is captured and comes to live with Okonkwo and his family. After three years, Ikemefuna is treated as one of the family, even calling Okonkwo \\"father.\\" The Oracle tells that it is time to kill Ikemefuna, so the tribe takes him outside the village. Okonkwo is told not to, as this is his adopted son. After the first blow lands, Ikemefuna cries to Okonkwo for help, and Okonkwo runs to him killing him with a machete, just so others would not think him weak.<br /><br />I taught this novel for the first time recently, and I was pleased at how students seemed to enjoy the story and discussions. There is much to discuss in this book: colonialism, culture differences, gender roles, and religion. Overall, it was a good experience. However, there was a disturbing part of having taught this. During discussions about Okonkwo's beating his wives or killing his son, I heard over and over again, \\"Who are we to judge?\\" and \\"That's their morals\\" and \\"We can't force our morality on others.\\" I was stunned to see relativism so deeply ingrained at such a young age. We are training a generation of young people to think that it is wrong and America-centric to consider some actions as more correct than others. This may be true if we were talking about style of homes or clothing or television shows, but we are talking about something far more important than that. Some students in my classes could not admit that it is universally wrong to treat women like property or to kill your innocent son. They begin their objections with that pseudo-intellectual start, \\"Who are we...\\"<br /><br />You are a human being, that's who you are. As humans, we must address these universally wrongs: killing the innocence, enslaving others, abusing women and children. This is a good list with which to begin.<br /><br />If you don't agree, perhaps Okonkwo can come to your house and try to change your mind. A few minutes with him, I'm sure you'll be quick to say how many universal crimes against humanity he commits.y classes could not admit that it is universally wrong to treat women like property or to kill your innocent son.

B0051QIGP4|5.0|Call me an obsessed Little Monster. Revoke my indie kid card or my credibility as a reviewer. Call me a crazed teeny bopper who wouldn't know good music if it bit them in the butt. I know what I like, and I *love* this album. It is every bit as epic as I anticipated, exceeding all the expectations I had for the album and, in my opinion, leaving The Fame and The Fame Monster (Both incredible albums in their own right) in the dust.    I've been in love with music for as long as I can remember. I got my first \\"Big kid\\" album at the tender age of 5 (it was Britney's debut album, and what can I say? I was born just in time for the pop music craze), and it all just escalated from there. It's been my obsession for a decade at least, very probably more. I've gotten a reputation for being both a bookworm and a music junkie, in addition to writer and, for some reason beyond me, singer. In any case, music is my life blood. I'm all about the music, which is why I love Lady Gaga (she also has an incredible passion for music, not just as a luxury, but as an art form), and why I love this album. Each song is a little gem, and they each have their own individual quirk and flavor, but they all have this big sound, and from beginning to end, this album is epic.    1. Marry the Night- Gaga starts us off on the album with this song, and it's epic sound, with the sound of church bells in the background, and powerful lyrics, it's a love song to New York, and also an incredible dance song. It was definitely an instant favorite for me, from the first verse, to the addictive chorus, it's got an incredible, powerful, epic and haunting quality, I think. Gaga's vocals are incredibly solid, as they are on just about all the tracks off this album. More on this later. I love the sound and the feel of this track, and something about it is just special. 5/5.    2. Born This Way- Okay, I admit, I've grown a little weary of this song due to it's extensive exposure through different media outlets, after initially falling in love with it the night it dropped. I still love it. It's message is empowering, especially for someone, like me, who has always felt out of place, who felt like a \\"freak\\" however you define it. It's catchy, danceable, has strong lyrics and vocals, and an incredible moral to it. It's only shortcoming, in my eyes, is that it has suffered from over exposure the way that all popular artist's singles eventually do. 5/5.    3. Government Hooker- Not one of my personal favorites. I like it, but in comparison to the rest of the songs on the album, I'm not crazy about it. It's a good song, catchy, provocative, good for the dance floor. The vocals aren't lacking, but they aren't as strong as on other tracks. I think this song may be an acquired taste, because it has grown on me more as I've listened to it again and again. 4.5/5    4. Judas- As much buzz as this song created before it even premiered, I was expecting something incredibly controversial. But when I heard it, I barely even raised an eyebrow. I didn't find it offensive at all. What I did find it was catchy, another fun single from Lady Gaga. Vocals are reminiscent of \\"Boys, Boys, Boys\\" and \\"The Fame\\" mixed with \\"Alejandro\\". It's not my all-time favorite, but it's probably in the top 5. 5/5.    5. Americano- I wish I could say otherwise, but I just don't like this song at all. There's nothing really wrong with it, it's just not my personal taste. It's very Spanish/Italian, it has an exotic, European feel to it, and it's catchy, easy to dance to. I think this one is a matter of taste, and, unfortunately, it just isn't quite to my liking. Still, there's nothing technically wrong with it, alright vocals, not as strong as the other songs, but still acceptable. 3/5.    6. Hair- Personal all-time favorite. Catchy tune, relatable lyrics, and great vocals, it's a dance song, but it features some great, strong vocal moments from Gaga, especially toward the end. Gaga, of course, has her own sound, butwhen I heard it, something in the back of my mind went to Cher. I think there's definitely something in here reminiscent of a song like \\"Believe\\". Whether you agree or not, I love this song, and I'm so glad it's a single. 5/5.    7. Scheibe- At first, I couldn't make heads or tales of this song. I like German, but I was iffy on the intro. The rest of the song is thoroughly enjoyable. I do like the song, but I feel like I'm more inclined to listen to it if I'm in a certain mood. Of course, another decent dance track, and the lyrics are good, vocals are nothing to sneeze at. Sort of middle of the road, for me. 4/5.    8. Bloody Mary- This one takes a while to get going, but once it does, it is a very enjoyable song. Not my favorite, it's a bit repetitive, and the vocals aren't as impressive on this one as on other tracks, but it's a nice mid-tempo song, not as dancey as the others, but enjoyable in it's own right. 4/5.    9. Bad Kids- Another relatable song. For anyone who's ever felt like a \\"bad kid\\", whatever you and those around you define that as, this song tells you that \\"you're still a good kid\\" to Gaga, even if you're a bad kid. The lyrics and tune remind me a bit of Madonna, to be honest, at least in the chorus. I am forever quoting this song, and it's definitely on my list of favorites. 5/5.    10. Unicorn Highway (Road to Love)- One of the more epic songs on the album. All you have to do is listen to it to know what I mean. This is one of those songs that they play for Pay-Per-View commercials when they televise a commercial, complete with clips of screaming fans and grand entrances. If this doesn't become a single, I'll be a bit disappointed. It's also another very empowering song, encouraging you, and telling you that \\"we can be strong\\" on the road to love. Another one of my personal favorites. 5/5.    11. Heavy Metal Lover- Another one I'm not so keen for. It's just a bit whispery for my liking, though it's nowhere near as off-putting as \\"Americano\\". It actually sounds more like a La Roux song than a Lady Gaga song. Definitely not a personal favorite. 3.5/5    12. Electric Chapel- I do like the electric guitar in the beginning. The sound on this one is big. It's a song that would be good for dance parties, and the vocals, though not weak, go from different levels of strength as the song goes on. Another middle-of-the-road track, in my mind. 4/5.    13. You and I- This track is another great one. It has a great rock feel to it, and the vocals on this song are probably the strongest on the album. It's a love song, but it just has this real great rock sound. If you only listen to a few songs off the album, make this one of them. Definite favorite. 5/5.    14. The Edge of Glory- Talk about ending the album with a bang! This is probably THE most epic song on the album, complete with strong vocals, a great dance beat, heartbeat songs, definitely a prom/wedding/NYE dance song. The lyrics are beautiful, they make me feel energetic and lighthearted, and, in my opinion, this is the perfect song to end the album with. 5/5.      Cheesy, though it sounds, I give this album a 10/10 rating. It's everything I wanted and more. Lady Gaga delivered with this latest gift of music, and now I can't wait until some far-off day when I can finally afford to go to one of her concerts. If I was just a fan before, I'm a Little Monster for life, now, and there's no stopping me. I was born this way, baby!
B002ZG99J0|5.0|A Single White Female Remake/Rip-off? Yes, it is, but this time it's better. I actually really liked the Roommate. Yes, it is a very cheesy movie, but it's pretty enjoyable. I like teen screams, even though this one is not very scary. I think teens will like this one. The cast isn't the best, but good enough to keep the movie going, I am a fan of Aly Michalka, but disappointed with her short appearance and I like most of Cam Gigadent movies too.<br />The Roommate is a winner and looks great on Blu-Ray!

B001DTPZNY|1.0|I can't add to much of the disappointment already written about this film, suffice to say it's another huge disappointment that I lay at the feet of the once-great-but-now-obviously-insane George Lucas. Swinging through trees with monkeys after speeding cars? Really? This movie is a CGI-enhances mess with no plausible plot, poor acting and even poorer direction. After ruining Star Wars with the Episode I, it seems George Lucas simply isn't content until he ruins every good childhood movie that I enjoyed while growing up. Shame on you, Lucas.
B000W8OM5Y|5.0|Those who complain about its lack of historical accuracy miss the entire point. This is not historiography. This is Hollywood and as such, it can do what it wants with history, simply in order to entertain. However, the essence of the story is sound. He wins at Stirling (Bridge). There is a mixed outcome at Falkirk. Finally, he is betrayed. His end is awful even by the standards of the time. The fact that the battle at Stirling does not include a bridge simply permits the visual spectacle to unfold. The charge is everything that one could wish for; the spectacle and the music (akin to that in Olivier's Agincourt or Errol Flynn's Charge of the Light Brigade, especially when he takes up the falling Union Jack from a dying comrade at full gallop). The point of the Stirling battle scene was probably the speech Wallace makes before the fighting starts. 'Yes', more fiction but no-one with Scot's blood in their veins could avoid being moved by his stirring words. Another truth: there was always bickering with the Scots nobles, such that the modest Scottish political elite of the time had no hope of contending with The Hammer of the Scots. Love and its tragedy had its place too. For a more sober account of matters, read my review of A History of Scotland.  Ian Hunter.

142311339X|4.0|Its amazing to me the way Rick Riodan keeps cranking out these books - they get very predictable as the characters lurch from one encounter with a mythological monster to another -- yet I still enjoy reading them.  Perhaps the best part is that my 10 year old son and I are reading the books together - we swap between the Greek, Roman and Egyptian versions and its give us lots of things to talk about.
B003ERQWD0|5.0|I've seen this movie about 6 times with my kids. They love it and I actually haven't gotten tired of it yet, it's that good and entertaining. The story is very good and the message it sends to the kids is a positive one -- to learn to appreciate your parents even though they may not be perfect. I have to admit though that there are some scary parts but I was surprised that my usually easily scared daughter is not deterred by it. The special effects of this claymation (clay animation) is superb! I had to finally buy this movie because my kids want to rent it all the time.
0307474712|4.0|I read this book over a long period of time, picking it up and reading a chapter here and there. We spend a lifetime with the two man characters, and my particular reading habits gave me an accurate representation of the passing of time.<br />The writer, David  Nicholls, is very talented; he particularly shines in his observant and acute descriptions of middle-age. However, the book's ending is a letdown. It seems as though the writer didn't know how to end his story, and thus betrayed the audience. One Day's unsatisfying ending has a negative impact on my star rating. Before reading the last thirty pages, I was prepared to give this book a perfect grade. I am still looking forward to the movie, but don't see how they can compress such an epic book into a two hour movie.
159562015X|5.0|Strengths Finders is an excellent way to help managers understand the strengths of their direct reports and for peers to understand each other. This is a quick and easy assessment and all of my staff found that the report of their top 5 strengths nailed their attitudes and abilities. I had my managers each read the first section of the book, then take the assessment, and then I compiled the results into a matrix and had them read only those sections that applied to the strengths that were identified on the team. This allowed us to avoid reading 40% of the strengths, since none of us had them. That made the exercise fun, fast, and useful. At this Amazon price, you can't go wrong for an inexpensive way to uplift your team and learn how better to work together.
B00013M6NK|1.0|The pics show this to be an ORIGINAL Nikon stamped EN-EL5 battery. What was received was a generic battery which I could have paid less for with other options on Amazon.
B003F3NDOO|1.0|This show gets 5 stars for staring the awesome Courtney Cox.  Cox is amazing, gorgeous, and I'd watch her play a tree in a kindergarten production.  But the show drops to 4 stars because of the lousy sets.  In no way does this show look like it's set in South-Central Florida (in one scene there's hills in the BG!) and the homes look about as lived in as a soap opera set.  Note to set designers: Watch \\"Invasion,\\" \\"Burn Notice\\" or \\"Dexter\\"--other Florida based shows with FAR superior \\"Florida-ish\\" set design.  The mediocre writing drops the show down another notch to 3 stars.  The dialog and scenarios are mostly a snooze and every episode is SO similar that they all \\"blur\\" together and it feels like every episode you're watching the same episode over and over again.  The supporting cast takes it down to a 2 star show--not sure if you could find more bland supporting actors, and my God, her \\"teen\\" son looks like he's a 35-year-old accountant.  But what absolutely destroys the show and nose dives it down to a 1 star is BUSY PHILLIPS.  My God, how does one even begin to describe the horrible \\"actor\\" that is Busy?  Let's put it this way, a 55-year-old, 400-pound, chain-smoking, white trash, trailer-park-living grandmother with no teeth would have more sex appeal on this show than Busy Phillips.  The barrel-chested, broad-shouldered, wide-bottomed man-thing that is Busy Phillips should in no way be cast in this show.  It renders the show unwatchable.  Note to casting agents and producers: Please \\"kill off\\" Busy Phillips' character and \\"re-cast\\" BIJOU Phillips instead.  Same initials, same last name, same white trash vibe, only Bijou is about a billion times sexier and a far better actor.  It's called entertainment, folks!  We want to watch pretty, sexy and/or actually funny and likable actors.  Not \\"things\\" like Busy.  Oh, and God, is her voice annoying!!!  You hear if and you want to kill yourself.  And is there a Get-Busy-Phillips-Off-TV campaign website?  Because someone needs to start one.
B004SBQAL0|4.0|I did not see this movie in the theater,  I think that it might have been more enjoyable if I had done so just because it is in many ways, a big screen action movie.  The movie will appeal to fans of super hero movies, as well as action junkies.  I would also have to agree with some of the other reviews that compared this movie to the Smallville and Super Man Franchise,  but as some one once said their are only so many keys on a piano, so of course certain movies are going to seem similar.  If you enjoyed this genre you will most likely enjoy this movie.  Timothy does a good job acting in this movie,  he tends to fall into that category of actor who always plays the same person,  not a bad thing but he is who he is.  The actress from Glee surprised me with an unusually good performance,  I thought that she actually created a character for this movie as opposed to just being Quinn from Glee, however I do not think that this movie would appeal to fans of Glee unless the LOVE Quinn in which case they might enjoy this movie, and for these people I would suggest renting the movie, borrowing it, or maybe watching it on Netflix watch instantly or cable when it becomes available,  I do not think that this is a movie that any one will need to rush to see,  If you were a fan of the book, which I never read you have probably already seen it, and if you have not seen it,  I think it will be easy to wait instead of paying top dollar for it right now.  I think that this movie is worth watching,  I will not be buying a copy,  I watched it on demand, I payed 5.99 to watch it twice, over the course of the 24 hour period that I had it,  I did spring for the extra buck to get it in HD.  I would have to recommend getting this in HD, as much of the special effects and action sequences will probably not be as Shiny in regular formats,  This is defiantly a big screen movie,  I would recommend turning the lights off and sitting down to watch this movie, so often now a days people multi task,  turn a movie on and do other stuff,  But this movie tries very hard to build a story.  It builds up over the course of the movie,  in the same way the main character,  who I thought did an average acting job,  it is not good and it is not bad, grows so does the movie progress.  The action mainly takes place at the end of the movie,  in this regard it reminded me a little bit of the movie Equilibrium,  (but that movies last action sequence was much shorter and the early action sequences were more plentiful).  I would have to say in order to compare it to something that it is better then the first x-men movie,  Because they had to introduce every one they kind of dropped the action sequences.    I did want to add another thought which is that,  I wish the initial fight scene had shown more of that persons powers or the term that they used in the movie which is \\"legacies\\",  it would have been cooler if that initial confrontation had a bit more oomph  to it,  but I am guessing that he might be younger, then the others,  It would have been nice if they had clarified the ages of them all,  I am not sure why But I assumed that they were all around the same age, until mid way into the movie when you see number six, who I think is at least a couple of years older.    So this movie is worth sitting down and watching not from the corner of your eye, or you might miss some of the better acting and little things that made this movie worth while for me.  I do not think that I will be buying it,  but I have watched it,  I have described the movies and such that if you are a die hard fan of you should buy or at least watch this movie,  if you are not that big a fan then I would have to recommend waiting until it drops in price, or until it comes out on cable,  another option I forgot to mention is the pre used copies you can get at blockbuster, that would be a great option as well for people to save a little bit of cash.  Bottom line I think this is a good movie,  I would highly recommend watching it, even if you have to wait for the price to drop a little or to find it on cable.  I hope that this review helps any one who was curious about this movie,  Unfortunately the negative reviews here on amazon are not particularly well thought out,  I think this project if much better then they made it out to be, and that you will enjoy it,  I just do not think it is super important that you rush our and buy it or rent it right this second, unless you are a huge super hero fan or Glee, she does a great job,  One other plus for me, was that in most super hero movies you get one guy, in this movie their are a number of super powered people that he has to find, and they are being hunted,  kinda like xmen they have to learn to work together,  the powers and that stuff was much more original then a movie say like, Heros,  and the bad guys were also quite well created.  Some people wanted more background but I think with as much story as they gave in the beginning people would have gotten even more bored before the big action numbers.
B002TO1Z8Q|5.0|I never saw GM in concert. After watching this DVD, I sure wish I had. Amazing singer and performer.     George can move from pure joy (Fantasy) to heartbreak (My Mother Had A Brother) with ease. The stage and lighting are a feast for the eyes and never overwhelm the performance. It's clear from the documentary that George is a likable guy, and surrounds himself with similar people. His band is superb. Their vocal warm-ups are a joy to watch. Damn they're good!     This is a keeper. I've already watched (experienced) it four or five times. Just one note: George uses the F word a few times (I thought the Brits just said 'bloody').  Anyway, if you ever watch it with your little nieces, like I did, you'll want to know where to hit the mute button (like I did).    Superb!
B003NFM3JU|5.0|The 3D is AWESOME!  It looks so real and lifelike.  I actually felt like I was in the movie.  It was pretty much the same story of Scrooge.  I liked the movie and felt like it was Christmas while watching it.  The snowflakes actually look like they're coming at you.  You'll definitely want to add this to your 3D collection to impress your family and friends.
B004QKNXIQ|5.0|Our entire family loved this movie.  So well thought out and put together.  There's enough depth and talent on display for the parents to enjoy, with more than enough fun for the kids (and the adults).  Our children (boy age 8 and girl age 5) watch it daily.  Definitely one of our favorite Disney films to date.  We're huge film buffs, and even bigger Disney fans, and this film did not disappoint.  We're so grateful to the talented people who continue to make wonderful films like this that our whole family can enjoy together.
B000002B2T|5.0|Although I adore Alice in Chains, they had a bad habit of applying layering to a lot of their songs-which distorts Layne's lovely voice.  'Above' doesn't do that, at least not a lot, and as a result sounds much more raw.  If they had done just one more record, I would happy.  Not to mention the artwork on the front makes this a good record to display, if you're in to that sort of thing.  Dark lyrics, great music...this might be my favorite record in my collection.  HINT: listen to this when you have a high fever.  It'll be a very interesting experience.
B003UESJHE|1.0|WHat the hell is worng with Amazon?!!!  This movie stops playing at chapter 13.  I thought my dvd player was going out then I tired it on another player and even my computer--the same result.  I noticed that the dvd version is now out of stock.  I guess so.  It is an inferior piece of crap!  I can't believe Amazon sold these.  I would never even bother with the blu ray version period.
B003UYUP6M|4.0|A well-written, readable introduction to the history of Google. Levy has spent a lot of time interviewing Googlers and writing about Google and so the book is well-informed. It contains little about outside views of Google, it's really \\"Google in their own words.\\" An enlightening book about a company that has reshaped our internet.<br /><br />One piece of trivia: Levy seems to like the word \\"peregrinations.\\"
0307477479|4.0|I really enjoyed reading little connected short stories, which I did not expect. I thought that this would be a typical novel but I realized it wasn't about three chapters in. I loved that a minor character (or just a name mentioned) in one chapter was the star of the next. Really, I LOVED that. I loved that the author was able to describe certain feelings (loneliness, embarrassment, longing, etc) in an extremely creative way - she really put into words the visceral reaction that comes along with pangs of guilt or awkwardness.<br /><br />One of my favorite chapters is the slide journal chapter. I understand that some people might hate it or think that it doesn't fit into the book, but the author uses a different writing style for each chapter, representing the inner workings of that star character. The slide journal is written by a tween girl in the 2020's, and I thought it was a perfect representation of a young girl in the not-so-far-off future... especially considering PowerPoint techniques are currently taught in schools!<br /><br />I wanted some chapters to go on and on so I could learn more about the characters, but I wanted some chapters to end quickly because I didn't really care about those events or people. I didn't like the texting in the last chapter, but I did like the author's views on the future and on how we will communicate. A lot of her observations/predictions had me thinking a few days after I completed the book.<br /><br />I really enjoyed this book, and I would recommend it for anyone looking for a series of connected short stories that provide one with the \\"big picture\\" of different times and events and people.
B004LWZWEC|4.0|5/29/11 just picked this up at Second Spin (not sure why they had a copy so early but I wasn't asking questions). The reason I'm rating this 4 stars is that this limited set is WAY over priced. The blue ray inside is going to be available without the small prints and over blown essay and tin container and THAT at a nice price would be 5 stars.     GOOD NEWS..the movie looks wonderful and sounds awesome... its only 1:33 aspect ratio so no widescreen which I'm assuming was the format they shot it.    BORING NEWS... the endless talking head extras add nothing and I'm a guy who loves behind the scenes bonus features but these are a series of 10 minute videos of writers and the odd musician saying how great AC/DC is ...how their riffs make your private parts shake and you want to tap your foot and it gets old in about a minute. This is a perfect example of taking what could be done in 10 minutes and stretching it out into an hour just to up the price with \\"cool insider bonuses\\" SNORE.    DON'T hate me for my 4 star rating...its ONLY for the LIMITED Collector's edition over priced set....anything else 5 stars ALL THE WAY....it is Great to have Bon Scott in HD!!! OH ..and its \\"Limited\\" to 90,000 copies...such a rare item   It DOES have a DVD version included which is nice , but I still believe at its list price its not a 5 star value for a few pictures and a booklet with kindergarten size print to add pages.    Warner Brothers suckered me into this kind of version of Casablanca ....only to come out with a NON box set later and that is the one I'd recommend...you have to have this by the way if you love Rock n Roll!
B000SFZ05C|3.0|This is definetely not one of their best albums. I can say its one of their worst but not so bad to be characterized as a bad album. There a re no tracks to make the difference and they are a little boring
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised by this book, it was a wonderful read. I can't wait for the other two to come out!
B004TJ1H3C|4.0|The first fizzled but the second season ended very strong with strong characters and excellent plot lines.  Too bad the writers weren't as skilled during season one. I really miss the show, it was gritty and flawed and had some characters you loved, some you hated and sometimes it was the same character.  The Stargate series will be missed.
B0046XMT6A|3.0|Still a good show, but not as good as the first season. Season one was more intense and the acting seemed more realistic.
B004X75RK4|4.0|Sandra shines in this movie.  I have seen better chick flicks, but this was worth a rental.  I did like that the movie was relatively clean compared to some.
0802473164|2.0|The book has been a good reader so far. But I was very unhappy with the three weeks to get here, when amazon promised it to arrive within a week (5 business days) of ordering it! The five love languages book is really a good inspiration to a couples life together and journey through understanding each other. If we men are needing a better understanding or maybe just some clarification then this is a good book to help our love lives with more than just our wife or girlfriend. It can also be our kids parents and friends too! Its a good book so far, I have only just read 1/4 of it but worth getting!
1401223176|3.0|Having read Jeph Loeb's earlier outings (The Long Halloween and Dark Victory), I had high expectations of this one. Sadly, I finished it feeling slightly underwhelmed - the artwork is indeed great, but the storyline felt to me like \\"Batman's Greatest Hits\\", and simply didn't sustain the dramatic tension. I would certainly recommend Loeb's earlier work over this.
B00005ABKC|5.0|this is one of his epic classics. you must have H.P. in you collection. his early stuff is just the best. if you like Petty, and don't have this one, get it. you will love it. we were listening to this back when it was new. what memories.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This is really a special show.  It's a grave travesty why Firefly would not get a second season while garbage like The Bachelor/Bachelorette would be in its 23rd season.      Firefly is not cerebral techno-babble science fiction.  There are no razzle-dazzle laser battles, alien civilizations or vessels zapping away at warp speed.  But that's OK.  There's no reason why all TV and film depictions of space-faring humans should be a Star Trek wannabe.  Firefly has it's own defiant brand of originality.      My only complaint about the series is, both pilot episodes (the actual pilot \\"Serenity\\" and the intended pilot \\"The Train Job\\") were the worst of the series.  The show didn't start off with a big bang, which may be one reason why it failed to gain a critical mass of TV audience in 2002.    Still, after finishing the 14 episodes and Serenity, you'll probably be in mourning, scouring the internet to find any morsel of recent news on whether Firefly will return.    I'm consoled in the fact that Firefly/Serenity still has a large dedicated fan base seven years after the show left the airwaves.  As of today, the Serenity Facebook page has almost 400,000 members.  And the number grows as a new generation of Browncoats discovers the series on DVD or Blu-ray.     I highly doubt we'd ever see Firefly again.  Our only hope would be, somewhere in the future, someone does a \\"reimagined\\" version of the series, similar to what they did with V and Battlestar Galactica.      Speaking of which, Battlestar Galactica (Syfy version) is still my favorite show, but Firefly has a bit more heart.  Firefly is like a once-in-a-lifetime love affair that ended too soon.      Thank you Firefly for the short time you were with us.
B00127RAJY|4.0|At first, you want to stop. It's hard if you're not used to constantly working out, but this DVD gets you moving and sweating. You stop if you need to, but you Jillian doesn't let you stop. Sometimes, you feel like she's right there telling you to keep going, which helps. I did 2 days so far and I'm sore, but I feel great. I'm motivated to do this and can't wait to see results. You have to buy weights though, so if you don't want to spend money on ANY equipment, don't buy this, but if you can spare $15-$20 on weights, go for it. I like this DVD :]
B001NTJV6G|4.0|I consider this album one of the top r&b soul albums of the 90's. I still pull out my CD case and pop it in, and groove to the songs and the whole progression of her work. Yes there are a couple of missteps, but this album shows the promise of the artist. If you are into Badu now, reflect on where she has been and see that her talent has progressed and continues to push envelopes.
B0052U59F4|1.0|This was a very good story however that fact that is was originally written as fan-fiction based on Stephanie Meyers Twilight series. I can not condone that she is now getting money for work which originally had a disclaimer that she was receiving no money for this and that copyright infringement was not intended. I am fan of fan-fiction it was thing to start as fan-fiction and then create your own stories. But changing names is not changing enough to call it original work to me.
B0043HA1K0|4.0|Songs about poverty, making a difference, social economic change: was this stuff written 40 years ago or this year? Wake Up is a great mix of tribute and haunting commentary on today's changes with songs that marked these changes in the sixties and seventies. Instead of trying to totally rework a song and make it brand new, John Legend and the Roots enhanced on the qualities that made these songs great in the first place. I love it when artists can recognize that great music deserves to be honored. John Legend actually felt the lyrics and The Roots is indeed the greatest house band on earth. It is indeed time for all of us to Wake Up.
B003UESJ9M|5.0|Very good performances, went to see the movie because of Gwyneth Paltrow and ended up falling in love with Garrett Hedlund and Leighton Meester's characters. The singing is amazing... and the conection between them even better, the songs unbelieveble too... and i'm not a country music fanatic.   I do believe that while the movie is about Gwyneth Paltrow and Tim McGraw's characters, Garrett's and Leighton's end up taking it away from them.     A must watch... wont be disappointed
B004IQMXD4|5.0|Everyone should have this CD!  Another rare gem by Stevie Nicks.  Well-written, intriguing, such a beautiful voice!  I love Stevie, and this addition is just more proof of her innate talent.  Missing is Jimmy Iovine, and the tempo is more laid back, a little slower, & not as catchy perhaps... Still great listening, & you'll not want to miss a single word.  Awesome!
B003UESJH4|5.0|I originally saw The King's Speech in theatres not long before the Oscar ceremony at which the movie took home three of the top awards (Best Picture, Best Director and Best Actor).  I was happy to be able to cheer for it on Oscar night, knowing first-hand that it was the best movie of the year.  I knew then that I would own it on DVD because it is one of those movies you can enjoy multiple times.<br /><br />The King's Speech, based on a true story, begins while King George V is still on the throne but is in failing health.  As he is portrayed in the movie (by Michael Gambon), the King is a masterful orator and a strong leader, but a cruel and impatient father.  His eldest son, David, the Prince of Wales (Guy Pearce), a man too busy living the good life to care much about his responsibilities or his country, is next in line for the throne.  His younger brother, Albert, the Duke of York (Colin Firth), has had a crippling stammer since early childhood and, as a result, he has been treated as being \\"less than\\" his entire life and considered unfit for the throne.<br /><br />After the crippling failure of a public speech, Albert (aka Bertie) begins seeing various speech therapists, each with crazier ideas about how to \\"fix\\" him and all to no avail.  Finally, his wife Elizabeth (Helena Bonham Carter) finds an unorthodox speech therapist named Lionel Logue (Geoffrey Rush) on the sly and enlists him to work with her husband.  After a shaky start (Lionel insists on working with the Duke as equals, which doesn't go over well with the Royals), Bertie actually begins to have success at speaking without a stammer.<br /><br />When King George V dies, David ascends to the throne as King Edward VIII, but his heart is not in it.  He is in love with a married American woman and is told that he will not be permitted to marry a divorced woman and be King, so he decides to abdicate the throne at the end of 1936.  This thrusts his younger brother into the role of King, which requires much public speaking. At that time, the wireless radio was new and was used to address the masses.  With the help of Mr. Logue, Bertie faces this new challenge head-on and surprises everyone.<br /><br />This film has a perfect blend of drama and comedy, as well as a great motivational story.  There are some heart-breaking moments, but the movie never becomes tear-jerky.  There are also some hilarious moments, usually in the treatment sessions between Bertie and Logue, when Logue's irreverence pushes Bertie's buttons and his odd treatment methods make for some wacky visuals.  It is a joy to see these two become dear friends.<br /><br />Firth is impressively believable not only in the physical manifestation of the speech defect but in portraying a man who feels helpless, trapped and embarrassed by it.  Rush is both hilarious and touching as Logue in a wonderful performance that I wish had been recognized with an Oscar (he was nominated but did not win).  Helena Bonham Carter brings a combination of upper class charm and surprising wit to her role as Bertie's loving wife.<br /><br />There are a number of extras on the DVD, including:<br />* A commentary with director Tom Hooper.<br />* A documentary on the friendship between Logue and Bertie.<br />* A Q&A with director and cast members.<br />* Two of the film's pivotal speeches as given by the real King George VI.<br />* The Real Lionel Logue: A family member speaks about him and the diaries and letters he left behind that were used as source material for the movie.<br />* A website for The Stuttering Foundation, where stutterers can get help.<br /><br />Highly recommended even if, like me, you aren't much of a history buff.t time, the wireless radio was new and was used to address the masses.

0062060554|5.0|I found this book to be an amazing read.  I was very surprised to see that it was S.J. Watson's first novel.  None of the rookie errors including unbelievable characters or unrealistic plot twists are here.  Watson hits the literary scene with a superb psychological thriller up there with the best of them.  The story grabs you from the beginning and never lets up.  Christine wakes up every day not knowing who she is.  She thinks she is in her 20s and always shocked to find she is a middle aged woman.  For the first three quarters of the book there are basically three characters.  Christine, her husband Ben and her doctor, Dr. Nash.  Each day her husband must remind her who she is and answer her endless questions.  He has also pasted current photos on the bathroom mirror to remind her of what is real.  She slowly gains knowledge as the day progresses but when she goes to sleep at night it all leaves and the next day starts the same.<br /><br />But when she gets the first call from Dr. Nash he tells her there is a journal in the closet where she has been writing all her memories on a daily basis.  He calls her each day to remind her of the journal and every day she then reads it and learns some dark secrets and memories.  Also each day she adds the new memories that come to her.  The real reason this novel works is that the plot is very plausible and the reader is filled with fear and apprehension from the very beginning.  Christine was in an accident that caused her amnesia.  But she is getting conflicting stories from her husband, her doctor and her own memories in the journal.  We follow Christine just as scared as her each day as she wakes to nothingness and slowly starts to put everything together.  But it is not that easy.  What is real and what is her mind making up?  And can she believe those who supposedly care about her?<br /><br />The suspense and trepidation here is endless.  Watson is a very crisp writer.  There are many suspense or thriller writers out there today but not many as good as this.  To provide a believable, deep thrilling plot with multi-dimensional characters is one thing but writer Watson adds even more.  He writes with great intelligence and respects the reader.  As the plot moves along right when it may seem to be working towards something unrealistic he pulls it right back on track.  More characters are added in the latter part of the book and the ending builds to a superb and satisfying cocnclusion.  There are many questions that must be answered in this book and they all are in a very realistic way.  It has been a very long time since a book pulled me in like this.  It had me guessing over and over as to what was really happening.  Watson writes with such skill and I was truly on the edge of my seat throughout, spellbound, quickly turning the pages.  First rate suspense here with great psychological intensity.  This is a writer I will definitely follow and I highly recommend.ot many as good as this.

144937980X|4.0|As an artist determined to learn the this new Processing language I needed a book that walked me through the baby steps before I got to one of the bigger books. This was perfect, highly recommeded for all creative types that have never programmed.   One thing... some of the graphics are just terrible! I mean really, the words/number aren't even legible. What's up with that??
B0051SNO90|5.0|ok finally.  do not read any further if you dont want to know the ending.  stop here.  do not read.  ok, its the last episode of the season. i think it is or im going to look real dumb. anyway, this is about two years to late but they finally did it.  of course its a little out of character for booth to have a kid without being married since he did that the first time. and he is almost perfect.  so maybe this is a good thing.  things are not always planned. but married or not, i could care lesss.  temperance is having booth's baby.  finally.  i would love to have seen a season of dating, growing pains, and a wedding. but this will do.  now, it was implied that they slept together. but we saw nothing. and nobody said a word. although angela with her look figured it out. and temperance's dad figured it out. i hope they dont screw this up with fights and unrealistic fights and ideals.  i hope they just let this happen.  i hope they they let us in, and a more normal couple, as in we see them together, falling in love, and watch them get married.  but they could screw it up. for some reason they dont put these two together. its to the point of being really silly. no two people who love each other the way they do would have stayed apart this long.  not possible. now what they can do is this. so far i love the fact they are together. im assuming they are. but they can have her lose the baby, hence they are not going to be together.  if they do that i will most likely not watch anymore.  its just become to dumb.  they did it right with angela and hodgins. so if they know what is good for the show they will allow these two to get together.  in the forums everyone is pissed or was pissed they were not together.  its been to long.  she better have this baby with him, and get married.  not because they have to get married, but because they love each other.  since i see know sign of love in real life a little fantasy sounds good!!  and it seems the ones you do love are taken.  so lets hope they get it right.  it was a silly show with the bowling but it was funny. and they made up for it with the birth, and booth and temperance having a baby.  so lets hope they continue to get it right. or this show in my humble opinion wont be on more than another season..  so lets hope they get it right.  it was a silly show with the bowling but it was funny. and they made up for it with the birth, and booth and temperance having a baby.  so lets hope they continue to get it right. or this show in my humble opinion wont be on more than another season.

1416550534|5.0|I had a hard time putting it down because it was so interesting.<br />Told by a 98 year old woman who is in a nursing home in 1999. She recounts her work with an elite family which started in 1914 when she was just 14. There are so many twists and turns that this book made me want more of the story, but the mystery is finally told by the one person who could tell it (the others died). Grace kept the secret for many years-a major part of her life.<br />The book is told from Grace's point of view until later in the book, when it switches to Hannah's point of view. It felt strange, at first, but it did make sense after a while.

B000XR4OC0|1.0|We purchased two pairs from Toms.  Both were size women's 8.  One pair was about an inch shorter than the other so I called to request an exchange.  After being on hold for what seemed like forever, I left a message with a recorded promise from them to call back within a couple of business days.  A week went by and nothing . . . Then I called again, this time determined to stay on hold until I spoke to someone.  I finally did and she told me to photograph the two shoes side by side and e-mail it to their warranty department.  I did.  No reply.  Then I finally got a reply from someone who requested I send the shoes back and they would reimburse the shipping costs as well.  But wait . . . there's a catch.  They needed a \\"request/exchange form\\" filled out and the link on their website doesn't work and the return address isn't on their website, only on the form you can't download.<br /><br />All of this has taken a considerable amount of time and patience and their website clearly says exchanges will be accepted only within 30 days.  We're not about to bump up against that deadline so I'll update the board on what happens next.
B00009AOBI|5.0|The dvd was brand new as stated. My wife loves this movie. Still can't believe the super low price I paid for a brand new dvd I can't even find in the stores. Arrived much faster than expected.
B0051QIGP4|1.0|I really wanted to like this album, but sadly, it's just plain awful. All but two songs are worth listening to - Born This Way and Judas, but that's because we've heard them before. Born This Way is a reworked version of Respect Yourself (Madonna) and Judas sounds an awful lot like Bad Romance. It's not like GaGa doesn't have the smarts or the ability. This album suffers from expectations that were set too high, a hype machine that's tired and out of gas and a production team that peaked and then floundered in the 80's (and should have been left there). Let's just hope that this is the nadir of Gaga's career and that she can claw her way back to the top.

B004EC5IUW|5.0|I'm a big fan of Neon Genesis Evangelion.  I was skeptical when they released news of a remake.  After watching the first one and seeing the difference I couldn't wait till the second came out.  True to the series, it's character development is amazing, the story line is different from the original, the Blue-ray graphics are mind blowing.  I am counting down the days till the 3rd release.  This is a must buy for Eva fans, and anime otaku.
B0051QO4QY|3.0|I have listened to this album a couple times and have a few short conclusions:    1. The songs are catchy - I have had a couple stuck in my head over the past few days.  2. Although they are different, many of the songs sound pretty similar.  3. There is a creepy Gaga voice on a couple tracks that I can't stand so I have to skip them.  4. I can't understand half of the lyrics because of her diction. (I'm 23 so I should be able to understand her, right??)    I didn't buy her first couple albums but I'm glad this one only cost me 99 cents. She could have done better.
0670022411|3.0|I read this book on the advice of a number of friends and various web sites that gave it great reviews.  When we first meet Diana Bishop she is in the library reviewing alchemical books for research.  While there she calls up a mysterious book and after a few notes she returns it to the library.  What she does not know is that this book is very powerful and other vampires, witches and daemons have been trying to get their hands on this book.  While at the library she meets Matthew Clairmont who becomes her friend and eventually her lover (but not in this book!).  The story is interesting at times and is full of historical references.  The problems I had is that I feel Diana is this loner, friendless, woman who wants nothing to do with her witchcraft and spends most of the book getting herself into situations that Matthew has to help her get out of.  They proclaim their love for each other but you will have to wait until book two to see if they marry or consumate the marriage.  Its things like this that made me thing \\"wait-I already read the Twilight Series-is this happening again?\\".  The story has its good elements but it could of used some better editing and the author could have made Diana a little more likeable and a bit more resilient.  It is an overall good story and I am hopeful that with the second book the author will correct some of these problems.
B000E41MS6|4.0|I haven't yet had the pleasure of experiencing \\"old\\" Doctor Who. I started out with this \\"first series\\" re-vamp set in the 21st century with leaps back and forward to different time periods and different planets. The awful, eye-roll inducing low budget special effects and feel almost sent me packing but the characters, the Doctor (of course!) and Rose Tyler got me hooked and never disappointed. So much fun, extraordinarily entertaining and incredibly addictive. And so, so much more than the cheeky science fiction I expected.
B000J5XS3C|4.0|This mixer does the trick for me. It has ample inputs and is pretty simple to setup. I really would have liked for it to have XLR outputs though. The only thing that I have a little problem with on this mixer is the power light, its a bit too bright.

B004LUHQ1G|2.0|The latest Foo Fighters album should be re-titled Waste of Time. I've been listening to rock music for over 40 years and have heard the very best, the very worst and everything in between. The biggest compliment I can pay Dave Grohl and company for this new disc is that it proves that the band is environmentally friendly, at least in the sense that they recycle riffs as conscientiously as any band in rock. This whole album, which sounds good by the way, is filled with derivative power chords. At times I was reminded of Pearl Jam, old Kansas and even, dare I say it, Nickelback. There are so many ideas in each song that it seems they need to over-flow before bursting. Caution, if you live on a flood plain don't play this album; it may be hazardous to your health. There are a few good melodic hooks here, but mostly these hooks are wasted in a desperate search for an actual song to latch on to. Arlandra is the one stand-out song for me. Although, Dear Rosemary is pretty good, particularly because of a cameo appearance by Bob Mould. The rest, especially the simply awful White Limo and The Matter of Time, is really hard to take. I know I'm in the minority here giving Wasting Light two stars, but I set the bar high and I call them as I see them.
B001U0HBQ0|5.0|this is the best film of 2008 and in my list of favorite films of all time. masterful direction of david fincher, brilliant ensemble lead by cate \\"the great\\" blanchett and brad pitt - probably his best so far.amazing score by alexander desplat, stunning visual effects, cinematography, production and art design, impeccable make up. deserving of 13 oscar nominations but unfortunately only won 3 when it should have won picture/director/score.
B002LVUKIS|5.0|So, I'm in a difficult position with this, because I've got to rate the collection as well as the individual games.  Well, let me start off by saying that, yes, the collection is definitely worth it for the first two games alone.  The original Thief games by Looking Glass studios definitely belong in anyone's list of Top 10 best games ever made.  A deeply developed setting, engaging story, gameplay and atmosphere immersive enough that it overshadows the few small bugs that pop up now and then.  Thief 1 and 2 are fun games well worth playing.  Thief 3, not so much.  The levels are much smaller and lose a lot of the exploration element that made the first two games so much fun, the controls are not as tight and the story, while good, doesn't quite live up to the original two.  All of these would have been forgivable if not for some jarring inconsistencies in the world details that repeatedly took me out of the game - including one with the Keeper Assassins that is so bad that I'm not sure it isn't just a glitch in the AI programing.  It's kind of a shame, actually, because with some of the gameplay changes they made, along with the vastly improved graphics and AI, this game could have been better than even Thief 2, the highlight of the series, but as it stands, I'd rather play the other two over it.  That's the game themselves.  The only problem you might find is that the first two games are incompatible with duo-core processors, making them unplayable on modern computers without a special emulator program, which any of the many Thief fansites will be happy to point you to.  Me, I still have an old computer that the games will run on, so it was definitely worth the purchase for me.  If you want to consider yourself a true Gamer, these are games you have to play.
B002ZG975Q|5.0|this is a movie made for its target demographic. a simple yet sweet modern take about beauty and the beast adapted from a book that inspired that old tale.it is fun to watch and i can highly recommend it to the whole family to enjoy. just don't be like a picky critic and you will definitely have fun watching it.many film critics hated it ( as if this film was made to win awards )but fortunately there are a few who did liked it who knew from the start that this was made for the viewers to enjoy and not to be impress by its technicalities/acting,etc.
B000PMLFRA|1.0|Just like everyone else here has stated, I will not be buying the bluray set unless the original un-altered versions are included. Remember what happened with the original release of Gladiator Bluray; it was crap, however due to overwhelming dissatisfaction from the fans, the studio was forced to re-release a proper version.     Hopefully the same can be done with this trilogy that we all love and want to see properly on bluray.
B003Y38YFS|5.0|I wear a size 8 and this shoe fits perfectly...is very comfortable, even between toes when doing alot of walking.  I did experience some discomfort between toes when driving long distance with them - so I'll just make sure I wear different shoes when driving.  Otherwise,  I'm going to get other colors.  When I tell friends these are croc sandals, they are amazed at how stylish they are and ask me where I bought them.
B004EPYZOO|1.0|How far would you go for someone you love?  After the murder of his daughter and the kidnapping of his grandchild John Milton (Cage), escapes from Hell and tries to save the baby from a cult.  Before we begin I should let you know that I am not, nor have ever been a Nic Cage fan.  There are a handful of movies of his that I do like, and this one is in no way part of that group.  After watching the preview I was not looking forward to watching this and after seeing it, it was much worse then I expected. I really am speechless about this movie.  The effects were kinda cool.  William Fichtner was actually good in this, but the dialog made his character not as threatening as he could have been. This is from the same director of \\"My Bloody Valentine\\", so if you have seen that you know what to expect.  The fact that this movie tried to take itself seriously and not a tounge-in-cheek movie like \\"Machete\\" was makes it even worse.  Roger Ebert says you should not be friends with anyone that likes this.  Peter Travers says it would be better if you were stoned or at least buzzed.  I say the movie was 97% total crap, the 3% is because there was a lot of nudity.  I know many people will love this because there are a lot of Cage fans that rent from us.  That makes me sad.  A big perk of my job is getting to watch for free and not paying $12 for a 3-D theater movie. I just wish I could get the 2 hours back.  I give it a D-.<br /><br />Would I watch again? - No chance in Hell (get it?)<br /><br />*Also try - Ghost Rider & Machete
0684857219|4.0|This book is very good.  It teaches u everything about body building if you want to join that career.  What i love about this book is that he tells you what exercises u should do for each body parts, and if you have a weakness in one of parts in your body part(such as you have a weak part in your chest form) than he tells you what you should do to make it better.  Why i gave this a 4 is that he does expect to much from us, such as working on a body part two times a week on a 2 X 3 day split.  Can be to much for casual body builders, I guess this book is for hardcore body builders who wants to win.  Other than that, this book is GREAT!!!
0553106635|5.0|This is Book 3 of the Song of Ice & Fire novels, set in the medieval land of Westeros. I came to these novels late and have wondered how on earth I could have missed them for so long.    This novel focuses on a smaller number of characters than the earlier novels as if to settle in to a deeper story for those it includes. Arya, Sansa, Catelyn, Jon, Jaime, Tyrion, Bran, Daenerys, Samwell & Davos are all there so readers of the earlier books will be pleased about that. However, Cersei and a few others such as Robb Stark do not make an appearance in their own right.    This is a great book and continues GRRM's Shakesperean 'tragedy/history play' style of piling atrocity upon atrocity (especially to our heroes) only to leave the reader hoping things will turn out well in the end. But that will be left for later books, if it does indeed transpire the way we all want it to?    I cannot recommend this book highly enough. For all those who like medieval history fiction, fantasy or otherwise. Just make sure you have read A Game Of Thrones & A Clash Of Kings first.

B000EHSVS2|5.0|A daring film enterprise at the height of the anti-war and anti-military sentiment in this country, the film seemed to satisfy those who supported the military and those opposed to it. George C. Scott embodied Patton fascinating both audiences who seemed transfixed with a fine script and superior performances of all players. Patton's genius was praised and his neuroses were exploited by those who felt he personified military immorality.<br /><br />Several viewpoints of Patton' personality and leadership are explored. His staff seem sychophantically loyal, and his soldiers appear to love him or hate Old Blood and Guts (Our blood, his guts)! Eisenhower's chief of staff Bedell Smith couldn't stand Patton, and Patton had a running competition and animosity for Bernard Law Montgomery. Karl Mauldin, plays Omar Bradley who first serves as his assistant division commander and then his superior. Bradley is portrayed as the benevolent and unassuming general who challenges the morality and military wisdom of Patton's decisions.<br /><br />The Germans seem to be unanimous in their esteem for Patton's audacity and military prowess. When Patton is relieved of his command for slapping a soldier, he is assigned to Sardinia, then Malta, then Cairo, and finally to England opposite the Pas-de-Calais where the allies set up a fictitious army around him. The Germans cannot believe that the best allied commander would actually be relieved for slapping a soldier, and they actually moved troops around the Mediterranean in anticipation of Patton attacking in Sardinia, through Greece, and at the Pas-de-Calais.<br /><br />Standing at 6'1,\\" George C. Scott seemed better at Patton than Patton did who matched him in height but had a high-pitched voice. Scott played up Patton's lack of verbal impulse control, his iron discipline (he was famous for fines), a lack  of patience with subordinate officers, and for slapping a soldier. (Actually, he slapped two). The viewer gets the impression that Patton is a neurotic military genius who is willing to sacrifice his troops to satisfy his vainglory and destiny. His performance is so effective that people will proably remember Scott as Patton rather than Patton as Patton.<br /><br />Detractors of this movie say that Patton was far more caring of his men than the script allowed. He was liberal with passes, ensured that mail arrived regularly, and that showers and hot food were provided more often than in any other command. He only relieved one general for cause as opposed to Bradley who relieved several. He was always found in front of his men rallying them from the side of the road or walking among them offering us an impression of a man whose bark was worse than his bite. There is no doubt that he instilled pride in his troops and made them believe they were invincible against any enemy.<br /><br />In spite of the movie's detractors, everything about this production is phenomenal and George C. Scott in a defiant Patton personna, refused the Oscar for best actor that Ryan O'Neil panted for in \\"Love Story.\\" (Well, love is never having to say you're sorry). It has withstood the test of time as being an all-time military classic.<br /><br />The speech he gives at the beginning of the film is a compilation of many of the salty and foul-mouthed expressions he made over his career. This part is not to be missed, along with the rest of the movie.<br /><br />Charge into this one!on is a neurotic military genius who is willing to sacrifice his troops to satisfy his vainglory and destiny.

0061726826|5.0|I really enjoyed Delirium! It was a romantic dystopian novel, about love, loss and finding ones self. I thought it was a novel Idea to use love as the catalyst for this society. I liked Lena and felt for her as she struggles to figure out what she feels, what she wants, whats real and what she is told is real. The man who tries to captivate her heart, what a guy and the lengths that he goes to do so!Her family drove me crazy! This story made me reflect on how fortunate we are to love and be loved!:)       F word 3 times, otherwise not many other language issues   sexual tension, one inappropriate situation but nothing happens. not for my teen.
B004UXUSIM|5.0|In my opinion this is Woody Allen's best movie which rivals RADIO DAYS. While in Radio Days we have a compashionate nostalgic return to the culture of the 40's, in Paris we have a comic study of the whole phenomenon of nostalgia that we all suffer from, this time mainly to the 20's and its famous literary characters. This movie is a delight for anybody older than 65.
B004EN9WCQ|5.0|Brilliant electronic music with roots that go deep. This album is a perfect contemporary for anyone interested in where electronic music can be today. It can be listened to intently, in the background, to sleep. This could be a perfect soundtrack for a choreographer for modern dance. The texture and the sound, it's wonderful. Nicolas Jaar is not pushing the envelope here. He has created a gorgeous album that in on par with Gudrun Gut's \\"i put a record on\\" of a few years' back. It's the kind of music that, if you hear it somewhere, you are likely to ask with curious desire: \\"What is that?!?\\"

B004G5ZY7E|4.0|Last summer, when we were going on vacation and I was looking for good vacation reads, my spouse suggested I try reading the Stieg Larsson series starting with \\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\\" based on reviews by other Amazon readers.  I love crime/mystery thrillers, but typically have only read American authors in the past - not intentionally, but it just turned out that way.  Once I got into the style, I quickly loved the Larsson books because  I love the cold weather and unusual locations of the Scandinavian settings, unlike reading about the USA.  When I finished the last Larsson book I searched Amazon for series that other readers liked if they enjoyed the Larsson books.  My first find was \\"The Snowman.\\"  The title and the subject of a serial killer got my attention.  It was also my first Kindle book (and I did not know how I would feel about the Kindle - I, like others, said \\"I like how a book feels in my hands and don't know if I would like it).  Turns out I loved the kindle and the book!  Det. Harry Hole is a great character - I started reading and did not stop until it was over.  Even when I would ordinarily turn on the TV at the end of a night, instead I read \\"The Snowman.\\"  I just ordered my next Jo Nesbo book.  I will not give away the plot or details of \\"The Snowman,\\" but I will say that if you liked the Larsson books, you will probably like \\"The Snowman.\\"

B002ONC9NC|5.0|One of the most moving explorations of the parent bonds coupled with parental hopes in opposition to teenage desires I have seen so far. Other reviewers place this delightful comedy/drama in the coming-of-age realm, but I place this diamond a part of the trilogy of teacher/student films,a completion of \\"To Sir,With Love\\" and \\"The Prime Of Miss Brodie.\\" In a little more time than an hour, you will have a glimpse of a teacher's private abode establishing correctness of high standards of conduct. The casting is flawless when only describing Carey Mulligan's face that luminates between juvenile to pixie-ish delightful in a few seconds. As you view this school girl slip into the dangerous waters away from her protected boarding school and deceivingly beyond her parental moorings, a familiar tension heightens to a frightening level only a parent or sibling would comprehend. While witty and smart, the drama becomes sinister and threatening. Will this child/woman rebel or listen to wisdom? The mannner and way she resolves her dilemma is magnificent. The viewer is equally seduced by the charm and allure of the swinging-sixties crowd and music as much as the supporting cast that wraps this tale in brushstrokes from many British swinging movies like \\"Darling\\" and \\"Georgy Girl,\\" which means you are in for a very special treat indeed. It is so spot-on in 60s atmosphere that I expected Michael Caine to pop in any moment. \\"An Education,\\" preaches loudly in one scene late in the movie when Mulligan's character must confront a perceived spinsterish school martinet in her own home that luxuriates with more sophistication than this adolescent girl could summon in her 17 years in a slow pan of the camera. That confrontation alone, where both characters make peace in minimum words was the pivotal tipping point in the film that propels this British film into a classic.

1934356476|4.0|Before anything else, I have to say I really didn't like the style the author chose for the first part of the book. In the chapters named \\"Monday\\" to \\"Friday\\", you go through your first week in a new job, doing pair programming with your colleague \\"Bill\\".  While this is fun for about half a page, sentences like \\"Bill walks over to the whiteboard and starts drawing a blablabla\\" get old fast. Very fast. I'm not exactly sure why the author decided on this style, since in my opinion it doesn't add anything to the text. As Greg Brown showed in \\"Ruby Best Practices\\" you can write an engaging text about advanced Ruby concepts without falling back to alibi prose. The second part of the book deals with some Rails internals and is written in a \\"normal\\" style, which I much prefer.<br /><br />With that out of the way, \\"Metaprogramming Ruby\\" is a very good book. The concepts and their presentation are solid and the author knows where to draw the line and leave things for further exploration by the reader. I think there's a slight over-use of footnotes and sidebars, which can disturb the reading flow a bit, but it's not very dramatic and unfortunately this is not that uncommon in technical books.<br /><br />What I like best is the author repeatedly points out that the distinction between \\"regular\\" programming and metaprogramming are blurry in Ruby at best, and that the latter in the end isn't some obscure sort of magic, but \\"just\\" a powerful set of tools that can be immensely helpful when used responsibly. Even advanced Ruby programmers are likely to pick up a new trick here or there or at least further their understanding of certain concepts.
0553582038|1.0|Reading this book was a vast disappointment after book 3.  It seems Martin may have peaked early in this series.  I found that I had to force myself to continue reading to finish this book.  Not very much action and the continuity is totally absent due to the changing perspectives of unsympathetic characters.  Book 4 offers all the excitement of watching a bag of popcorn in the microwave, with the caveat that all the corn has popped in volume 3.  You keep waiting and waiting for something to catch fire, but alas there is not even any smoke.

B000002N1E|5.0|Omigod!!    I was (and still am) living in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil when I bought this album in 1995.  I was already hoping for something of the \\"let's raise the bar a bit\\" category from Prince, but was totally unprepared for something of this caliber. This was music from a master musician with his back against the wall, fighting with his long-time label and out of step with the predictable shlock playing on the radio, and yet defiantly playing his kind of music with the best band he ever had, the New Power Generation (NPG).  Everyone is in top form here, from press-roll master, drummer Michael Bland to Tommy Barbarella (keys), to Maceo Parke (sax-y funk meister) et al.  First and foremost, of course, is the sheer brilliance of Prince himself.    Long considered a musician's musician by those in the know, especially on lead guitar (hark the words of Carlos Santana who called Prince \\"the most underrated guitarist around\\"), Prince excels also in his ultra-funky rhythm guitar (check out \\"319\\") and on every other song herein. The song for song quality of this album is impressive: I don't think there's a bad song in the lot, and although I'm a big Prince fan, I certainly don't think all his work shows such consistent brilliance.  I was truly saddened later to discover that this album remains somewhat unknown, probably due to its being lamentably out of print for a decade -- probably due to the machinations of Warner Bros., or the languishing state of musical tastes in general, one supposes.  The good news is: it's BACK IN PRINT!    So, please pay attention to these words:  This is the absolute finest Prince/NPG album of the nineties (and there's some stiff competition there, no?), and (track for track) is definitely one of his top five albums of any period (in no particular order: Dirty Mind/Purple Rain/Sex Symbol/Sign 'O' the Times) and a must-have for any Prince fan or lover of 90's music.  Do what you must to have this album -- it's that good.

B000KC8O3S|5.0|I'm not much of a soundtrack person, I tend only to listen to soundtracks if the music really moves me or inspires me.  This soundtrack does both!  I love the music on Doctor Who it really is amazing, I think that even a person who has never seen the show would find most of the tracks interesting and pleasant.  I really love all the songs but a few shine through more than others:<br /><br />The Doctors Theme:  This is the main reason I bought this CD, I loved this song in the show (though I didn't know what it was called I referred to it as \\"The Bad Wolf Theme\\"  because it plays when the Doctor kisses Rose in the last episode of season 1)  It's a deep and moving song I love it!<br /><br />The Face of Boe:  A short but powerful song that makes me misty eyed at times.  Very well done with a ton of emotion.<br /><br />Madame de Pompadour:  Like 'The Face of Boe', this song is deep and powerful.  Every note soaked in a penetrating sadness that is amplified if you have seen the episode \\"Girl in the Fire Place\\"<br /><br />Doomsday:  Don't let the name fool you this an amazing song and is my favorite on this CD.  This is the music that plays at the end of season 2 at Bad Wolf Bay.  It is very similar to 'The Doctors Theme' but with even more emotion and sadness.  I sometime cry when I listen to this track.<br /><br />Song For Ten:  Really a great song, I find myself singing parts of it at work all the time.  This is the song that they play at the end of the Christmas episode of Season 2 when David Tennant becomes the new doctor.  Just a all around sweet song that makes me feel good inside.<br /><br />The Doctor Who Theme- Album Version:  A longer version of the theme song that really gets your toe taping.  I dare you to try and not hum along with this catchy tune!

B000FSME1A|4.0|Wow, what a fantastic film.  Loosely inspired by Josef Conrad's novel, HEART OF DARKNESS, Apocalypse Now  dives deep into war, all levels of individual sanity (or insanity) and evil manifest. Capt. Willard (Martin Sheen) is assigned to dispatch \\"with extreme prejudice\\" Green Beret, Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando) portrayed as  a rogue officer with a \\"god\\" complex. The symbolic journey up the river is like an escalator ride into the deepest levels of Willard's own  tormented soul. Will killing Kurtz , in turn satisfy his own needs?  Although set against a Vietnam backdrop, this movie is more about humanity, and personal struggles to preserve it.

B003L77FYS|5.0|OK, please don't misunderstand me: I absolutely LOVE the \\"Castle\\" series. But love doesn't have to be blind, and being completely loyal doesn't mean you can't discuss imperfections of the ones you love, right? So let me start by saying that \\"Castle\\" has brilliant writers, great plots and plot twists, murder-mystery suspense and action, clever wit and amusing humor, intimate moments, touching pathos, attractive and lovable primary characters and chilling villains, a wonderful cast of very talented actors, great directing and editing, colorful framing shots of New York City and inspired musical soundtracks. In sum, \\"Castle\\" is, by far, my favorite show on TV. BUT as much as I love this show, I'm sorry to say that I sometimes felt disappointed by some of the episodes in season three. Seasons one and two felt consistently stimulating and satisfying to me, in nearly every episode and in nearly every way. But to my sensibility, while season three achieved more spectacular moments, it also suffered from more disappointing aspects. First, in season three, the writing of the stories and the dialogues was sometimes uneven. At times the writing was MAGNIFICENT (like in the season three finale), but many other episodes were not as clever, intriguing, amusing, or touching as  the episodes mostly were in seasons one and two. The primary and secondary actors are still delightfully talented, but without the best writing, the actors cannot shine to their fullest abilities. Second, the producers and writers made the debatable decision to make the relationship between Rick and Kate suffer a major setback and take a long detour. While there may be dramatic (and financial) reasons to extend the show in this way, it felt contrived and frustrating to me. For example, at the end of season two, at the very moment that Kate is apparently about to tell Rick that she loves him and wants to have a romantic relationship with him, the writers have Rick suddenly reconciling with his ex-wife and going away with her to the Hamptons for the summer. And worse, the writers make Rick completely obtuse and oblivious to all of the obvious signs of emotional turmoil in Kate, just as she is trying to talk to Rick about her feelings. This major turning point that sets up season three seems very contrived and contradictory because Rick is usually exquisitely observant and insightful about so many details and motives of crimes, and yet here (and elsewhere) he fails to observe and understand the emotions, desires, and needs of Kate. The writers (whom I deeply appreciate) repeatedly do this to Rick and Kate (and to us, the fans) at the most important romantic moments, like when Kate aches for Rick to tell her that he loves her, when she longs to hear that he wants a romantic relationship with her, and when the big lovable dope repeatedly should just kiss her! Similarly, I think it is very unrealistic that two strong-willed, highly intelligent and articulate characters like Rick and Kate have never (after three years now!) had a self-revealing, heartfelt conversation about how they feel about each other and whether they both want a romantic relationship together. This three-year failure to talk heart-to-heart would never happen in real life. And after the first two seasons, as the love between Rick and Kate intensified to the point of breaking through their insecurities and fears of rejection, in season three the producers and writers made Rick and Kate pull way back from each other emotionally and relate to each other often as \\"just friends\\" and \\"professional partners\\". I felt frustrated and less interested when their relationship became more disengaged. Third, all of the secondary characters (who were given more lines and better lines and a lot more time onscreen in seasons one and two) got neglected and excluded too often in season three. This decision hurt the show's quality because all of the secondary characters act very well and really add depth to the show (and addenjoyment for the audience) when they are given a chance to participate more in the dialogues and stories.   Back to the positive side of season three: it's a pleasure to see Kate's vulnerable and self-protective character grow psychologically and open up interpersonally -- often due to her interactions with Rick and her deepening feelings for Rick. And season three did provide several intense and touching experiences between Rick and Kate, and with Ryan and Esposito, and with Captain Montgomery in the season finale. The finale was AWESOME and actually exceeded the high quality of seasons one and two. The confrontation of feelings between Rick and Kate was raw and honest, and the final scene between Rick and Kate was especially poignant. At long last, Rick finally tells Kate that he loves her -- under extreme circumstances that are desperate and life-threatening. BRAVO! I just hope that in season four the producers and writers will finally allow the characters of Rick and Kate to have a full and satisfying romantic relationship together. Enough already with the frustrating dragging out and postponing of the love we all want to see fulfilled! Let Rick and Kate be happy in a loving romantic relationship with each other. And let me and millions of us fans be happy for them. (Ha! It's funny how emotionally involved I feel toward these make-believe characters.) So let's see \\"Castle\\" portray and explore a mature and deeply loving relationship between Rick's and Kate's characters. Doing so should enhance the show and advance the story, not harm or end it. There are still countless ways to make Rick's and Kate's romantic relationship have dramatic challenges and interesting developments, and touching, profound, bonding experiences. The keys to keeping \\"Castle\\" successful rest in choosing the smartest direction for the overall story, and then investing enough money and talent in the writing of each episode. If the direction of the overall story is satisfying to the viewers,and if the writing of each episode is consistently suspenseful, insightful, amusing, and poignant (which is difficult to maintain at the highest level), the actors, directors, and production staff have proven that they are immensely capable of bringing the writing and the stories to life in a thoroughly enjoyable way. So best wishes to season four! May \\"Castle\\" achieve more consistently the best writing of the first three seasons -- and explore even higher and deeper realms of life and love!  UPDATE on June 10, 2011: I've changed my rating from 4 stars to 5 stars because the more I review past episodes and think through the evidence, the more I think that Rick's and Kate's three-year inability to tell each other \\"I love you\\" and to at least TRY to love each other in a romantic relationship may NOT be due to the writers using the old formula of keeping our hero and heroine \\"in-love-but-apart\\" to create tension and interest in the audience. Instead, Rick's and Kate's three-year inability may be a dramatic reflection of their life experiences, fears of being hurt in a romantic relationship, and psychological and behavioral defenses. If anyone is interested in my evolving thinking along these lines, please read my two comments below the review by \\"Trueheart.\\" I welcome your comments about my theory (and your own theories) about this three-year difficulty by Rick and Kate. Cheers.  UPDATE on October 9, 2011: I just watched all 22 episodes of Castle Season Three on DVD over the past week and it confirmed some of my views, but it also changed others. Changes: the time devoted to the secondary characters in Season Three (and the actors' performances) are excellent. I don't remember why I originally felt that there was less time devoted to the secondary characters in Season Three.  I guess it was because of one or two episodes where the story focuses more on Castle and Beckett. Also, the writing quality throughout Season Three was consistently superb, and in the season finale, it was absolutely magnificent. Confirmations: the writers keep having Rick \\"choke\\" and \\"screw up\\" when it comes to expressing his love and desires to Kate. After three seasons (and now into the fourth season), the writers still have not explained why Rick consistently fails to speak and act well romantically when it comes to Kate. After all, Rick is a fluent writer of over 20 best-selling novels; he is extremely observant, quick-witted, and articulate in person; he has been married three times; and he has charmed many women, in and out of bed. So why is Rick so unable to talk with (or kiss) Kate?   Here are some of the many examples of Rick's romantic malfunctioning: In the \\"plucky sidekick\\" episode, Kate asks Rick emphatically \\"So, why do you keep coming back, Rick?\\" It's a real moment-of-truth and a golden opportunity for Rick to tell Kate that he loves her and wants to be with her in a committed romantic relationship. Rick hesitates, fails to tell her he loves her, and evades the question. In the episode \\"To Live and Die in L.A.\\", Rick tells Kate that he admires her strength and her heart, and tells her that she's \\"hot,\\" whereupon Kate tells Rick that \\"You're not so bad yourself.\\" For once, Kate looks imminently receptive for Rick to kiss her. But Rick fails to kiss her, and hesitates for so long that Kate becomes self-conscious and uncomfortable, and therefore excuses herself and leaves. In the season finale, when it becomes clear that Kate is a target for murder, Rick goes to Kate's home to ask her to \\"walk away\\" from trying to capture or kill the murderers of her mother -- so that Kate might save her own life. We expect Rick to understand Kate's character and psychology, to have thought through ahead of time the best way to persuade Kate, and to talk with Kate in a sensitive, empathic, supportive manner. Rick starts out well, but then loses his focus and his temper. He fails in several ways: when Kate says \\"Is that what we are?\\", she is clearly challengingRick to finally tell her that he loves her and wants her romantically. But again, Rick fails to say this essential truth. (Why?) Instead of remaining empathic and sympathetic to Kate's underlying emotional needs and desires for love and commitment, Rick overreacts to the surface of Kate's anger and fear, gets defensive, loses his temper, and instead of expressing his love and desire for Kate, expresses his frustration with their relationship, and ends by aggressively telling Kate that she is \\"afraid\\" and  \\"hiding in nowhere relationships with men you don't love.\\" Rick may be accurate in his description, but he is horribly wrong in his manner, timing, and focus. That wasn't what Rick should have told Kate at that moment, it wasn't what Kate needed from Rick at that moment, and it wasn't even what Rick came over to talk with Kate about. And it sure wasn't loving and helpful. Even when Kate forcefully tells Rick that \\"You think you know me, but you don't!\\" Rick can't or won't stop the tirade he's on, can't stop to ask Kate to help him understand her better, can't get himself on Kate's side at that moment, for both their sakes. Rick has seriously mishandled several steps and several goals of his visit to Kate. (Why?)  In the same episode, Rick tries to express to his mother how he would be utterly devastated if Kate were to be killed, but again the words get caught in his throat. Martha says something like, \\"Oh Rick, for someone who is so good with words, you often can't find them at the right time.\\" Rick chokes on his words and actions, when it comes to Kate romantically. (The writers have gradually revealed why Kate \\"is fighting her feelings for Rick\\" and is \\"hiding in nowhere relationships\\", but the writers still need to explain why Rick, who can speak and act so effectively in a range of situations (including life-threatening situations) suddenly fails to speak and act well -- and even speaks and acts poorly -- when it comes to Rick's romantic feelings for Kate. I hope the writers will soon start revealing Rick's previous life experiences and the psychological reasons for his many failures with Kate romantically. And I hope the explanation is a lot more interesting and profound than simply that Rick doesn't want to ruin what he and Kate currently have, and also is so intent on not harming his future chances with Kate romantically that he keeps holding back on taking any chances with her in the present.)   But for all of Rick's inability to tell Kate that he loves her over the first three seasons, Rick breaks through his fears and inhibitions when Kate gets shot and may be dying, in the final moments of Season Three. Twice, Rick tells Kate that he loves her. That's a huge breakthrough and I'm very glad for it. But we've now seen three episodes of Season Four and Rick is still not talking with Kate about his love for her and his desire to start a romantic relationship with her. Personally, I think the writers need to have Rick and Kate start talking about their love for each other, and then start acting on their love for each other. Either that or start having episodes that explain in much more detail why Rick and Kate are not yet able to talk and act on their love for each other. Unless we know more about the reasons for Rick's and Kate's romantic dysfunctions, watching two beloved characters be unable to romantically behave normally or happily for three or four years is more frustration than I think is fair to the fans.   For anyone interested, please read my comment (#23) about the first episode of Castle Season Four (and the psychological reasons for Kate's romantic conflicts regarding Rick) in the comments to Trueheart's review below. Cheers.
B0034G4P80|2.0|Funny. I didn't get bored once during the course of \\"Thor\\". But if i start to think about it, most of what i have is complains. Not so much for what's on the screen but mostly for what is not. The music, especially the main theme, of Patrick Doyle was awesome and the charisma of the actors literally saved the day, that i can say. But too many questions are left unexplored and too many occasions are missed in order for me to fully appreciate this film.    The religiosity of it all disappointed me. The lack of it, to be more precise. What is a typical day for a God or a half-God? Do they simply sit on thrones and say important things? Do they simply stand still and look at space? The everyday nature of things was not clear and i do feel that this is an important point if you want to understand why those Gods love their home and their role. I would much rather stay on Earth, with the beautiful Natalie Portman, then return to Asgard. I never felt like i wanted to be there in the first place and live their lives.     And Gods cand die? Is that it? And they're capable of showing childish jealousy? What happens when we, ourselves, die? Do we go to Odin? So then, Jesus does not exist?     When you want to install a universe as a background for a story, don't you need to know every little detail even if you're not going to use them? In \\"Avatar\\" or \\"The Lord Of The Rings\\", you really do feel like you're in a \\"real\\" world with its complexities. Not Asgard. It feels static, like if every little place was built only because the script required it. It exists only for the duration of the scene.    On another level, super heroes have big cities to play in. Thor has... what? A small rural county lost in the desert? No headlines or media coverage? No chance for us to witness the heroism of our Hero through the eyes of the world? And is it normal for the character of Natalie Portman, a scientist, to believe so rapidly in Thor?     Basically, i feel like this movie wasn't taken seriously and that the universe and characters weren't really \\"loved\\" by the auhtors. Even the end was a let down. First, with the hammer (that simply \\"goes\\" to Thor ratter than being pulled from its plinthe, like the Excalibur sword) and second, with the ascension of The God of Thunder himself.     This last one (the ascension) is personal to me but darn it! The last track of the soundtrack is called \\"Earth To Asgard\\" and is simply glorious. Knowing the story, knowing that it's the last track, i would have thought that the last image of the film, accompanied by that great theme, would have been Thor flying with all his newfound glory to the sky while smiling and/or winking at Jane. A perfect way to end on a high. And boum! Fade to black. Instead, we have Thor sit around and laugh with his God-like Friends in a God-like Cafeteria.    I feel that this isn't the way you leave characters you truly love.

B004EPZ06G|5.0|This movie had me laughing hysterically throughout.  Sure, it was almost EXACTLY like the first \\"Hangover\\" and had none of the originality that the first one did, yet it was still consistantly funny.  Whereas the first movie was a bona-fide five stars, this one gets 4.5 from me, simply because I think it copies a little too much from the first film. Yet, I see no reason to completely change a formula that obviously worked the first time.  This one is way more crude and crass than the first one, but to me it also has more memorable lines.  The part with the riot and where they kidnapped the monk were CLASSIC!!  I don't think this movie is as bad as most people think.  If people went in expecting that it would be more original than the first \\"Hangover\\", they were setting themselves up for disappointment.  I knew it would be more of the same. I just expected to go in and laugh for 1 hour and 45 minutes, which I did.  Therefore, when standing alone and not being compared to \\"The Hangover\\", this movie is nearly as CLASSIC as that one.

0743455967|5.0|My copy of 'On Writing', authored by Stephen King is by and large, permanently attached to me. It has been invaluable to me as a writer,and should be a staple in every writers library.<br />But this book is more than a 'how to', it is a story. King tells of his life. The background ideas for many of his books come from school experiences, as well as other experiences that influenced his life and his writing. He lets us inside early failures,from magazine stories,and teaches the do's and dont's, those little notes from early editors which ,he explains, helped, as well as those he didn't give any mind.Stephen King fans are happy he did as he pleased.<br />As always, King produces a masterpiece. He affords to us the details of his run in with the car, which almost killed the brilliant writer.<br />Read,and enjoy often.
1595826971|5.0|This is a highly recommended product to anyone who is a fan of the game as well as those interested in Tim Burton art style( with a little more twisted imagination added to it). The price is definitely very reasonable compared to some other artbooks which is double the price and have less content. This book shows the devlopment process to realizing the game's amazing art style and direction and has comments by the artist on their thoughts and devlopment process.     To reiterate, this is highly recommended and definitely worth checking out. Digital copy is also available via the darkhorsecomics website and a mere 10 USD.
B003X8597A|2.0|Wagner wrote three early operas that are relatively unknown since they are rarely performed, including die Feen, das Liebesverbot, and Rienzi. They are operas that are not typical of  Wagner's mature style, but do show development toward the final Wagnerian style. Rienzi is the opera that launched Wagner's career as a musician, and several of the pieces including the overture are still occasionally performed. There were no available movie versions of this opera until this performance came out, so I decided to buy it, especially with the reasonable reviews given to it by Amazon.com reviewers. This performance has its merit. The singers were faultless, acting and singing well. The recording was high quality, though there were often problems with mixing of the sound of the singers and the orchestra, in that the orchestra tended to drown out the voices on stage.<br /><br />My problem with this performance is the staging. I don't object to modern versions of operas, so long as they don't distract from the story and theme of the original opera. If the staging is such that it creates another theme or story than the original opera, or if it restricts itself to being solely a commentary on either the opera or the composer, then it should not be considered as a legitimate version of the opera. I recall the Peter Sellars versions of various operas that attempted contemporary contextualization of 18th and 19th century operas, yet they were never sold as straight opera renditions. Creative license with modern European staging tends to destroy the composers intent, and this should be overtly stated. It would be like re-writing a Beethoven symphony for a Jazz band but calling it the original symphony. Liszt did not have the audacity to do that, but was willing to call his transcriptions something else, and bizarre creative staging should be called something other than the original opera.<br /><br />The staging used in this performance is indeed bizarre. The citizens of Rome come out masked at first, eventually removing their masks and donning suits that looked more like Soviet peasant outfits. Rienzi and his daughter appeared more like Adolf Hitler and Eva Braun than a noble Roman tribune. The themes of Stalin, Hitler and Mussolini prevailed, forcing the entire opera into an entirely other interpretation. Adriano, the traitor, is made into the hero, and Rienzi is reduced to totalitarian scum. The final scene, with Rienzi in Hitler's bunker and Speer's model of the new Berlin before him was exceptionally distractive to the aria \\"Allm&auml;chtiger Gott...\\" and completely out of place. The videos of Rienzi as a totalitarian propagandist before microphones appearing on television were seriously distracting. Wagner's character development in the opera was completely re-written. The behind the scenes slaughter of the assassins at the end of act 1 altered the story of the opera. This is not the way Wagner intended the opera to be, and the staging was too divergent from the actual opera story to be legitimate. I'd rather just listen to a recording than to watch what St&ouml;lzl has given us.<br /><br />Whatever one may think of Wagner, I suggest that performances should leave Wagner alone. It is true that Wagner was a truly despicable  egotistical, racist person, yet his composing is sublime. It is quite easy to see his anti-Jewish sentiments throughout his operas, which must be overlooked. Thankfully, many Jewish Wagner conductors and performers have been able to do that, producing some of the best performances of Wagner in existence (eg., James Levine's Ring, Leonard Bernstein's Tristan und Isolde). To be obsessed with mid-twentieth century totalitarianism when performing a Wagner opera deprives the opera of its legitimate interpretation and reduces the performance to just another case of Euro Trashirst, eventually removing their masks and donning suits that looked more like Soviet peasant outfits. Rienzi and his daughter appeared more like Adolf Hitler and Eva Braun than a noble Roman tribune. The themes of Stalin, Hitler and Mussolini prevailed, forcing the entire opera into an entirely other interpretation. Adriano, the traitor, is made into the hero, and Rienzi is reduced to totalitarian scum. The final scene, with Rienzi in Hitler's bunker and Speer's model of the new Berlin before him was exceptionally distractive to the aria \\"Allmächtiger Gott...\\" and completely out of place. The videos of Rienzi as a totalitarian propagandist before microphones appearing on television were seriously distracting. Wagner's character development in the opera was completely re-written.

B004NSULHM|5.0|With this album Radiohead shows again that they are unique in the music world. No group or musician sounds like Radiohead. They are giving a message that they will not stop discovering, ever. And definitley it is far more creative then In Rainbows. It is what i expected from Radiohead. Because they do not make music to make people happy or satisfy. They make music to innovate new things each time. This is a true art and it deserves huge respect.
B004NJW96C|5.0|This album is a warm welcome back for Moby's biggest fans. Most reviews i have read have found fault with the long, minimalist ambient, instrumentals on the album. I for one have been wishing for an album   with long minimal ambient music, akin to his album The End of Everything. For a decade now Moby has split the difference between making pop leaning material and the dark ambient electronic music i loved him for. Destroyed is the first time he has come close to doing both with gusto. The second half of this album is perfect.  The Violent Bear it Away, Lacrime, Victoria Lucas , Stella Maris are flawless. Stella Maris a particular stand out is the 3rd in line of songs which tap the grand strings set against tiny ghost like voice...like songs My Weakness, and A Seated Night before it Stella Maris is intense and beautiful, painfully so. Blue Moon is the We are all made of Stars of this record, a sleazy synth pop tune with a powerful chorus. the Low Hum is spooky and has a electro vibed ending that is stunning.
B003VR5PPY|5.0|This is the first time since Myst that I have found a game that does the puzzles the right way!<br />This game comes down to to things:  Number one, the puzzles.  Number two, he story.  So lets go over them...<br /><br />The Puzzles<br /><br />I love puzzle games, and I have played almost every one that has ever been made.  Most of the time I get frustrated because the puzzles are: a) Too easy so that my intelligence feels insulted.  b)Too obscure and random so that the solution to the puzzles just don't make sense.  c) Outrageously tedious and boring so that I loose interest altogether.<br /><br />999 really does puzzles right.  The puzzles range from easy to rather tricky.  I never once felt frustrated with a puzzle or that I was being led to the solution like a little child.  Some of the puzzles took a bit of time and a bit of scrap paper.  I enjoyed every minute of the solving.  Even when I came up with the wrong answer I found myself excited at the challenge of finding the correct one.<br /><br />I like that the puzzles are done in one section at a time this makes everything so much easier.  You don't have carry around some pointless item throughout the game only to forget about it seven hours later when you need it for a puzzle.  The puzzles just make sense, they are logical, they  have deeper meanings and they play well into the story, which brings me to the next part...<br /><br />The Story<br /><br />Now, I haven't finished all the ending yet, but I have seen enough of them to get a good feel for the writing and the plot.  The plot really is rather good, at first everything seems random and scattered, but as you progress through the game the plot begins to come together and it come together very well.  The writing is the only part of the game I wasn't entirely satisfied with.  Don't get me wrong most of the writing was good, but there were a few parts that could have been better in the dialog that could have been improved.  The characters are strong for the most part, some more than others.  The dialog is very heavy with profanity which, I find takes away from some of the more exciting parts.  If you are going to make a M rated, very text heavy game, save the profanity for the extreme moments to add effect.  It's used so much in this game it kinda makes some of the scary and exciting moments a little less then they could have been (I prefer no profanity but that's just me)  still, the plot holds strong and make for one amazing game.<br /><br />Overall, I think this is one of the best games out there to date.  I hope to see more like it in the future.og is very heavy with profanity which, I find takes away from some of the more exciting parts.

0439023521|5.0|(This comment encompasses feelings toward the trilogy as a whole, not just The Hunger Games...)    Collins has created a world that is so raw, so powerful and real.  The characters were real and I cared about them, despite their faults.  The story is compelling.  You're drawn in from the first page and consumed by the emotion of it all.  It's full of action and violence and suffering, but the way that it is presented is perfect...it isn't gratuitous.  The love story made my heart ache, but the physical romance wasn't over-the-top.  There was a real sweetness to that aspect, and when coupled with the tragedy, new meaning was added to each.  The writing was spectacular... all the right words - nothing too flowery, nothing too plain.  There was a catch at the end of almost every chapter that made continuing necessary, but it never felt forced.  Each of the books in this trilogy leads to an end that you think you can predict...but this story is really in the details.  There is no way to get to the end of the first book and not NEED to read the second, and then the third.  I fell in love, had my heard broken over and over and sewn back together, had hopes shattered and renewed...lost track of how many times I actually cried.  It's rare that any book can move me so much.      Thank you, Suzanne Collins, for creating and sharing such an amazing story!!!
B001NLKXK2|4.0|I knew not what this was about when I read it, and I really did enjoy it.  It's a very sad story about early onset Alzheimer's disease affecting a 50 year old woman, Alice.  It is told from her perspective, helping us all understand more of what it feels like to have Alzheimer's and to help us understand it better.  I knew very little about the disease when I read this book and found it very interesting.  I read it because it was recommended to me by Amazon.  It's certainly not a \\"juicy, couldn't put it down\\" novel or anything if that's what your after, however it's books like this that make me feel more knowledgeable about life.  It's a little sad but after all, life is sad.
B004Z2TUGE|5.0|Had not heard of this show and watched it on a whim - nice action, good music, tight special effects, nice climax to the ending, which did not leave you feeling like you just wasted 2 hrs of your life.  This show is entertaining and is one of the few shows that I would watch a second or third time.
B0042EJD8A|4.0|This is a Michael Moore kind of documentary, that is, before he became rich and famous. There's all the down home kind of people being featured and they're fighting, in this case, Big Gas, which means ExxonMobil, Halliburton and various and sundry others. I really don't know enough about the situation to pass judgment on the central accusation of the film, namely that hydraulic fracturing causes long-lasting environmental damage and the poisoning of water supplies. The fact that film maker Josh Fox shows several homes with water that can be set afire at the kitchen sink tap is however a bit disconcerting to say the least.<br /><br />The problem seems to be that the methods used for fracturing employ a number of chemicals that are carcinogenic and, most significantly, there is no way to control the spread of those chemicals to areas around the wells including into the atmosphere. It's clear to me that there is not one executive at ExxonMobil or Halliburton that would want any hydraulic fracturing done anywhere near his home. Not in my backyard or across the street or even several football fields away is how just about everybody feels about this technique for getting oil and gas economically out rock/shale formations.<br /><br />But there is a lot of money to be made and there is the argument that using such techniques can alleviate our dependence on foreign oil. The amount of natural gas and oil that can be fractured out of the rocks in the United States is enormous with some estimates claiming the supply is over a hundred years at current energy consumption levels. But Josh Fox's point is, at what cost? What personal and environmental cost?<br /><br />What this film pinpoints is another example of how the economic interests of a few large corporations trump the lives of countless number of people and how the real environmental and human costs of production are dumped onto the public, especially the public that is our children and our grandchildren to come. The sad fact is that energy is relatively cheap today because the real cost of that energy is being charged to coming generations in a kind of Ponzi scheme. Since ExxonMobil, Halliburton, et al., have a shareholder horizon of the next quarter's earnings numbers, it is impossible for them and their execs to give a flying you-know-what about tomorrow's children or the world they will face. The future can take care of itself is the position that they are embracing. Meanwhile they personally are not polluted directly or inconvenienced or made cancerous since they live far, far away from the effects of hydraulic fracturing, and presumably with all the money they are making they can provide for their children and grandchildren to continue to live where they are (relatively) safe from the pollutants that are being expelled.<br /><br />But I have to say that this is not a great documentary. Its budget is obviously quite a bit short of what some other film makers can afford, yet Josh Fox makes his point very well and does a great public service in calling to our attention the dangers associated with hydraulic fracturing. I notice that there is a lot of advertising on television paid for by e.g., ExxonMobil that is trying to make this kind of natural gas and oil production as sweet as Tupelo honey with smiley faces and fields of flowers and greenery in the background. It's nice to see a counter to that, even if the film's budget is probably a fraction of the cost of one ExxonMobil commercial.<br /><br />It is gratifying to note that the positive reviews for this movie greatly outnumber the negative ones. It's clear that the industry's attack team has taken a pass on this one, hoping, I guess that it will go away from lack of interest. Take a look and see why this issue is not likely to go away; in fact I predict another more powerful film to come, which WILL be viciously attacked. Stay tuned.latively cheap today because the real cost of that energy is being charged to coming generations in a kind of Ponzi scheme.

B004IH0TS4|5.0|It takes some good action in a book series to get me hooked. This book was so great and I didn't even notice I was getting educated. Great twists and turns from the beginning to the very end of the series. You follow Percy through Camp Half-Blood all the way to tarturrus in the Underworld. Extra parts that make the book longer are always exiting and end up effecting the main plot greatly. If you love Harry Potter and The 39 Clues, buy this book. Rick Riordan follows closley in the footsteps of J.K Rowling, Gordan Korman, and Roald Dhaul.          Z.C
0553386794|5.0|A Game of Thrones, book 1 of an eventual 7 book series, is an epic fantasy novel. I'm not going to get into plot or anything that you can see from the thousands of other reviews, just note that this book is not for everyone. There is a TON of characters. Seemingly small details in book 1 may turn into bigger plot points in the later novels. I would absolutely recommend this book, but if you don't have time to read all the released books together, you may want to wait. You're not going to want to give enough time for yourself to forget some of the smaller details.

1905236042|5.0|I like these cards a lot. The only thing is, I found that I can't read from them in all audiences of children because the children want to play with them.  It is hard enough to keep preschoolers on their yoga mats.  When I turned around from helping one child, I found another one playing with the cards on my mat:-)
B004KPLVW2|3.0|Special Affects were pretty primitive by today's standards, but story line is much better than the new movie.  Interesting to see how far we have come with computer animation.
B0009UC7H0|1.0|Don't mistake this film \\"Sahara\\" with the excellent 1943 film starring Humphrey Bogart. Instead, this is a pathetic waste of money in a film that has poor acting, and a ridiculous script. It stars Matthew McConaughey and Penelope Cruz, two actors that have yet to produce any memorable performances, in a failed attempt to reach the \\"Indiana Jones\\" franchise fans. Of course everyone's reaction to films is a personal issue, but it can be noted that the film received no major awards or even nominations for awards in a year (2005) that didn't exactly produce an outstanding list of films. Bottom line - give this one a miss.
B004K4IZ3G|3.0|I was disappointed in the movie.  First move was better from a story perspective.  Affects were much better in this movie than the first movie though.
B0043KK4N6|5.0|Love Cristina Aguilera voice.  Love Cher voice as well.  Would wish to hear more of Cher singing in this CD.
B004IE9REE|3.0|Though I love the concept of this book and enjoyed reading it, it leaves me a bit hollow in that many of their top picks are UNAVAILABLE--and the book is far from comprehensive.  I can list ten to twenty colognes that are not in this book that I've owned over the years that were fantastic and far from obscure... Krizia, Tres Homme de Caron, DK Men, Salvatore Ferragamo, Byblos just to name a few.  But the authors have both wit and style that make the histories and reviews very fun to read.
0545123267|1.0|This is such a blatent Twilight ripoff.  Let's see...wolfpack. Disenfranchised, unusual high school girl with long, beautiful hair and two girlfriends--one is shy, the other outgoing. Werewolves change into wolves due to a certain cause. Conversion to being a werewolf is through a bite, which painfully spreads the \\"poison\\" through your veins. The girl was seemingly born to be a werewolf, as she has certain unexplainable senses and abilities. Main protagonist werewolf is fascinated with girl, spends large amounts of time watching her. Werewolves communicate telepathically, mostly in images. One angry, embittered female werewolf in love with another of the werewolves, who loves somebody else (the main protagonist girl).
0060007737|5.0|I bought this book after reading Al Ries' book \\"22 immutable laws of marketing\\". Like that book this one was refreshing, informative, and straight to the point. It cut through the marketing hype and tells you what works and doesn't work around branding.
B00402FGE4|2.0|Interesting concept that suffers from uneven dialogue writing and stupid plots.  A certain mad scientist gets annoying with his tantrum throwing. Sci-Fi dumbed down right before your eyes.

1402238843|4.0|I have long been a fan of Georgette Heyer.  In Venetia, she manages to have the heroine get where she wants to be, both the author and the heroine.  Heyer's complete understanding of the times and mores of the Regency period enabled her to let her characters bypass the strict behavior modes in vogue at the time.  The characters did that only to get to their ends.  Heyer seemed to base some of her more ridiculous characterizations on real life.  That made her novels all the more absorbing.  Lately, I have been wondering at the injustices of the Regency period.  The elite were complete snobs and uncaring of those who waited on them.  However, Heyer's novels are among my favorite.
B0029LHW68|4.0|I can't give this five stars, but it's a really good album. I actually started listening to it again. Kings and Queens, I must have played that song a hundred times. What a great song. The lyrics are awesome. I applaud Jared Leto for taking this band as far as he did being an actor.
1592402690|3.0|My favorite Beatles book is by Bob Spitz.  This doesn't even come close.  There are some interesting elements in it, but I constantly felt like the author was trying to pump himself up by putting the talents of the others in question.  In his view, he's a genius.  He may well be, but he was surrounded by genius. Methinks he doth protest too much.    In fairness, he alienated me early on by being dismissive of Rubber Soul. It's a common thread throughout the book.  If he wasn't the engineer, the work just wasn't very good. This kind of ignores the fact that Rubber Soul is considered by a significant number of people to be one of, if not the best Beatles album.  In my case, it and Abbey Road are my favorites. Sgt. Pepper's has some great moments but I always thought it was overwrought and over produced.  It had amazing innovations but for me it hasn't aged well.     He is obviously in Paul's camp and it shows in every part of the book except the end. I think Lennon and McCartney are/were both geniuses.  Lennon's work appeals to me more, I see him as more of an artist and McCartney as the better musician, but then I listen to one of Paul's better songs and shake my head. One thing I feel certain of is that the whole was greater than the sum of the parts, even when they were no longer actively writing together.    You are left with the impression that George Martin didn't have much to do with the success of the band, it was largely Geoff's genius that made Martin look good.  OK, whatever. Harrison couldn't play guitar, Lennon was talented but needed a lot of help, Ringo was a marginal drummer.  Only Paul escapes most of his criticisms.  There's probably some truth to all of that but I think he overplays it to lend credence to his unspoken assertion that he was the magic that made it work.    Frankly I came away from the book feeling like I understood why George Harrison didn't like the author.  Based on the book, I don't either.
B004UC1WN8|5.0|I have to listed to this CD several times but I have finally come to the conclusion that I LOVE IT!  When JLO became Jennifer she lost a lot of her fan base then she released only spanish speaking CDs and not a translated CD she lost even more.  I noticed this CD is JLO and it shows.  The CD is definitely a club favorite.  There are several solid songs on this CD and her music has evolved.  Nowadays the music is about the hook.  That is why so many not worth mentioning has hits.  I think she has given us more than the hook.  Great CD.

B000J10ERO|4.0|Oh my goodness, I cannot believe how this movie gets a bad rap despite the fact that it is, in my humble opinion, a quality action/superhero movie.  Obviously if you dislike Superman movies or action/superhero movies in general, you are probably not going to be reading this review anyway.  I am aiming this review towards people who like this genre but have been deterred from renting/buying this movie because- allegedly- this movie is a travesty of epic proportions.<br /><br />I will try to avoid spoilers whenever possible, but in short this movie is essentially a sequel to [[ASIN:B0012QVJXS Superman: The Movie]] and [[ASIN:B000059XUI Superman II]]; Superman has returned to Earth after being gone for 5 years searching for the remains of his home planet.  Lois Lane has moved on with her life and has a boyfriend and a son, and meanwhile Lex Luthor has been released from prison and has a new scheme to make a fortune on real estate.<br /><br />Director Bryan Singer is clearly in love with the style and presentation that Richard Donner originated in Superman 1 and Superman 2 (at least before Donner was fired by the producers on the second film).  We get the classic John Williams soundtrack, an outstanding opening credits sequence that pays homage to the credits sequences of the first two movies, as well as nods to memorable scenes and lines of dialogues from the first two films.  The movie features excellent effects (you will believe again that a man can fly!), a decent story that builds upon the themes of the first two movies, some genuine tension and jeopardy for our hero at the end, and an uplifting ending that opened the door for future sequels.<br /><br />So far, so good, right?  Well, let's go over the chief complaints that have been leveled against the film:<br /><br />1. *The movie has no action*  This is a curious criticism to make for a movie that features the following (minor spoilers): Superman saving a jetliner (and Lois Lane) from crashing, Superman stoppingan armed robber armed with a machine gun, Superman saving Metropolis from natural disasters while using many of his superpowers (heat vision, super strength, freeze breath, and super speed/flying), Superman lifting an ocean liner to save Lois/her boyfriend/her son, Superman lifting an entire continent - a continent containing Kryptonite no less!- to save billions of lives.<br /><br />Oh wait, I forgot.  Superman doesn't fight anyone or trade punches with a supervillain.  Please.  Does this really constitute a valid complaint against the movie?  Does every superhero movie we make have to pander to the 10-18 year old male demographic?<br /><br />The original Superman movie is widely accepted as a classic, and Superman does not fight anyone in that movie.  Watching a superhero overcome over obstacles should be as entertaining as watching him punch out a supervillain.<br /><br />2. *The movie has bad acting*  Substantial criticism has been directed towards Brandon Routh as Superman and Kate Bosworth as Lois Lane.  First, Routh makes an excellent Superman.  His resemblance to the late, great Christopher Reeve is well documented, but Routh gives a complicated performance as both Superman and Clark Kent that comes across as much more than a Reeve caricature.<br /><br />The Bosworth criticisms have some merit to them.  Bosworth is an attractive, talented young actress, but it is a bit of a stretch to accept her as a spunky go-get-`em reporter.  To be sure, the script could have given Bosworth more to work with, but I think the main problem is that she simply looks too young (especially since this movie is supposed to come after [[ASIN:B000059XUI Superman II]], which featured a Lois Lane that looked to be in her early 30s).  Bosworth's age could have been a potential asset if the movie had led to more sequels, but that ended up being a nonissue with a reboot due to come out next year from Director Zack Snyder.<br /><br />A special note of praise must be directed to the always-excellent Kevin Spacey as Lex Luthor.  Spacey's performance is clearly inspired by Gene Hackman's classic portrayal of Luthor, but Spacey makes the role as his own, mixing Hackman's comedic take with a sinister edge that is delicious to watch.<br /><br />3. *The movie's plot was too derivative of the original Superman movie*  Some have criticized the movies storyline- particularly Lex Luthor's villainous scheme- as being too similar to the original Superman movie.  While this movie is indeed quite similar to the first one (which I am certain was entirely intentional on Bryan Singer's part), it is hardly the remake that some have made it out to be.<br /><br />In particular, Lex Luthor's scheme makes perfect sense.  Again, this movie is a sequel to Superman 2, and in Superman 2 Lex discovers the Fortress of Solitude and the Kryptonian crystals contained within.  Once he is released from prison, does it not make complete sense that he would travel back to the Fortress to exploit the advanced technology contained there?<br /><br />(Minor spoiler) One can criticize that the landmass that Luthor creates with the Kryptonian crystal would be uninhabitable and therefore useless for him to sell, but any supervillain scheme in a movie like this one is going to have holes and flaws.<br /><br />4. *Gasp! Superman has an illegitimate child!  Heresy!*  Some have been offended by the idea of Superman having a son with Lois Lane (which apparently was a result of their intimate encounter in Superman 2), with the son being born while Superman was away from Earth.<br /><br />Haven't we accepted the idea of other iconic heroes having children while unmarried- for example, Captain/Admiral Kirk in Star Trek II, and Indiana Jones in \\"Kingdom of the Crystal Skull\\".<br /><br />Now, I think one can certainly criticize the timing of giving Superman a child.  \\"Superman Returns\\" was designed to re-introduce the character after nearly 20 years of not being on movie screens.  It would have mademore sense to have Superman and Lois get married in a future sequel (an idea that has already happened in the comics, the \\"Lois and Clark\\" t.v. series, and even the recent \\"Smallville\\" series), and then have a son.  Alan Moore's excellent [[ASIN:1401227317 Superman: Whatever Happened to the Man of Tomorrow?]] story - which ended the Silver Age Superman stories- featured a poignant scene at the end involving Superman's son that would have played well in a \\"final\\" Superman movie (had Bryan Singer been allowed to direct a series of Superman movies).<br /><br />In summary, Bryan Singer gave us a good- but not quite great- Superman movie.  It is a real shame that he was not allowed to make a sequel.  In 2002 Director Sam Raimi gave us a good but not quite great [[ASIN:B000O19EWK Spider-Man]] movie, and then followed up in 2004 with one of the greatest (and I would argue *the* greatest) superhero movies in [[ASIN:B000I9YV2Q Spider-Man 2]].  I think a Singer Superman sequel could have followed that pattern and given us a truly epic Superman movie on par with the first two films.  Singer had stated that he planned to go in the direction of \\"Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan\\" with a second movie, so it likely would have been a movie that featured Superman going toe-to-toe with a supervillain, a la Superman 2.  (Hopefully Singer will give us some details on what he intended to do with his Superman sequel while promoting the new X-Men film.)<br /><br />Instead, we will be getting a reboot next year from Zack Snyder that will feature General Zod as the main villain, and is rumored to have Clark Kent traveling the world before deciding to don the Superman costume.  At least \\"Superman Returns\\" had Superman already *being* Superman right from the start, but hey, even if the Snyder film spends 3/4 of the movie with Clark debating whether to actually be Superman, all will be forgiven if the last 1/4 of the movie features a Superman-Zod slugfest with Snyder's trademark slo-mo action and plenty of gore/blood, right?<br /><br />If that happens, Bryan Singer's intelligent, emotional film may finally get some well-deserved respect after all.
B000003CM9|5.0|This is the second album from the Allman Brothers.  It wasn't a big seller in it's day because the Allmans did not appear on many people's radar until \\"The Fillmore East\\" album, but it is loaded with songs that made the Allman Brothers great and ultimately put and kept southern rock on the map.  It includes such classics as 'Revival', 'Midnight Rider', and 'In Memory of Elizabeth Reed', and the rest of the album is filled with solid southern blues/rock.  A worthwhile addition to any collection.
1444710338|2.0|After I recieved these books, I decided I did not want them.  I then learned that it is difficult to return items- I finally emailed the vendor (in the U.K) and he sent me an address to send the  books back to. It has cost me $13.00 to return a $25.00 purchase, and Im not even sure he will refund me.  Its incredible that there are no vendors in the U.S. that had this book so I wouldnt have to pay this ridiculously expensive fee for a return.  I will probably not purchase anyhting from Amazon again because of this .     Thankyou,   Kimkaye Jenkusky
B0034G4P80|3.0|On the plus side, Kenneth Branagh's Thor fulfills its intended purpose: to introduce the comic book character Thor to audiences prior to the release of the upcoming Avengers movie. The movie draws on the original Marvel comic book's background for Thor's origin as the Norse god banished to Earth by his father, Odin. While it preserves most of the relevant Asgardian characters (Thor's scheming brother Loki; his comrades Fandral, Hogun and Volstagg; the warrioress Sif, the guardian of the Rainbow Bridge, Heimdall; and others), there are some variations to the original storyline that fans of the comic will notice. That said however, the differences really won't matter to anyone not familiar with the comic and so aren't worth going into here.<br /><br />Note: for those who are not familiar with the classic Marvel superhero team, the Avengers (in the upcoming film version anyway) consist of Iron Man (already introduced in the two Iron Man films of 2008 and 2010), the Incredible Hulk (introduced in the 2008 film of that name), Thor (introduced in this film) and Captain America (to be introduced in a film coming out later this year). Two other Avengers, the Black Widow and Hawkeye, while not being given their own films, have been introduced in the others, the Black Widow in a cameo in the second Iron Man film and Hawkeye in a cameo here in Thor.<br /><br />I can't say that Thor is a great film. It's watchable and fulfills its mission, but I think less would have been more. The back-and-forth plot that keeps switching between Earth and Asgard makes it hard for the film to really build up any momentum. The beginning is, quite frankly rather slow as it fills in a lot of background, and the film doesn't really seem to hit its stride until almost an hour in. This is definitely a case where less would have been more. A slimmer, more focused film would've allowed for more character development and more heart.<br /><br />The casting is something of a mixed bag, though to be fair to the actors the script's frequently banal dialogue doesn't really allow for much character development. The good news is that Chris Hemsworth fills the bill as Thor, and looks awesome when he's in full armor (though they thankfully ditched the stupid helmet from the comic). Anthony Hopkins is a decent Odin, and Tom Hiddleson actually manages to imbue Loki with some surprising depth.  The two most pleasant surprises were Idris Elba as Heimdall and Josh Dallas as Fandral. More than any other actors in the film, Elba and Dallas seemed to really _get_ the whole heroic comic-book feel that the film called for, Elba in his solemn, duty-bound but conflicted guardian Heimdall, and Dallas in his dashing, reveling-in-the-fight Fandral who really lights up the screen when he's on.<br /><br />On the down side, Natalie Portman was wasted, mainly again due to the script, which limits her to a brilliant-female-scientist-who-falls-in-love-with-muscular-hunk-because-the-plot-demands-it role. Ray Stevenson, whom I've loved in other rolls and who can be heroic and wickedly funny at the same time, was also wasted.  He's well cast as Volstagg, who is _supposed_ to be funny, but the script never lets him actually _be_ funny. And Tadanobu Asano as Hogun is just _wrong_; Asgardian warriors should _not_ have Japanese accents.<br /><br />There are a few cameos to watch for.  Stan Lee, the writer who essentially created the Thor character for Marvel comics back in the 60's, is in there.  J. Michael Straczynski who wrote the story for the movie (not the script - can't blame that on him) is in there. And a recent two-time Oscar-nominee whom I won't name but who you'll immediately recognize, gives you a hint of what he's going to be like as Hawkeye in the upcoming Avengers film.<br /><br />As for the 3D, Thor is a classic case of why retrofitting a film into 3D is usually a bad idea. It makes a film darker, literally, and this effect really shows up in Thor. Some sections are so dark they'll have you instinctively squinting. And quite honestly, I can't recall a single scene where the 3D was even really noticeable, let alone noteworthy. You won't be missing a thing seeing this one as a normal film.<br /><br />Recommended for anyone with an interest in Marvel comic superheroes and particularly for anyone planning on seeing the upcoming Avengers film.ly, I can't recall a single scene where the 3D was even really noticeable, let alone noteworthy.

B0030ZOYHC|5.0|The series reboot of Evangelion is the best thing to happen since the reboot of Fullmetal Alchemist. In this, you'll find that the retelling of the story is (not) the same as it was before. You don't meet any new characters in 1.11, but you'll find that the characters are brought up better, and the story goes pretty fast (because of it being a feature film). For Neon Genesis fans, you'll find that Shinji isn't so whiny anymore (take note that I said \\"isn't so\\") and he actually has \\"dropped one\\". The visuals in 1.11 are amazing to say the least. If you have a Blu-Ray player, get it so you can watch it in HD (Again, for previous fans of the show: Ramiel looks so cool). It's fun to look at, and there's plenty of action in this to keep an Otaku and a person new to anime excited.<br /><br />Pros: Story retelling, new characters and improvements to the previous characters.<br />  Stunning visuals, especially in HD.<br />  Action-packed.<br />  Not episodic.<br />  Lots of Extras.<br /><br />Cons: The story does go pretty fast, so those of you who didn't watch Neon Genesis Evangelion might get a little lost.<br /><br />On a side note for Parents: It is boarderline PG-13 - R. It is mildly graphic in violence. There is mild language, but no F-Bombs for those of you that care.<br /><br />Rating 5/5. Good job Funimation, and you too Hideki Anno. Also, the Japanese track is available. I recommend you watch it both ways. I love the english cast, and the japanese cast is amazing too. (Whoo for Spike Spencer!!!)
0761158464|4.0|This was a fun and interesting book for any star wars fan that is looking for the little memorabilia that other won't have.  the product is very unique and in a very good hard binding.  however, the silver finish can not take wear and care very well.  this isn't like your typical pop up book, more like a version for adult but would be loved for kids too.  i suggest it.
B004EC5IUW|5.0|I loved 1.11, but compared to 2.22 I just LIKE 1.11. 2.22 Starts off with a bang, and then just doesn't stop. You'll be on the edge of your seat from beginning to end. The new character in the movie will start the pattern for the new direction that the tetraolgy will be going in. The story still follows a little toward the anime still, but you'll be able to tell that the next movie will be totally new. Again, I'll have to praise the visuals. They turn up the figurative heat on the action, and it is just fun to watch. The way the Evas move, and fight is just so much fun to watch. Also, added perk: The japanese track is on here. I recommend watching it subbed, and dubbed. Both are equally good.<br /><br />Pros: So much action in this one, you'll be on the edge of your seat with your heart pounding through your ribcage.<br />  Visuals and action together. Great in HD.<br />  Japanese and English tracks.<br />  Tons of extra stuff after the feature.<br /><br />Cons: The story doesn't move as fast, but as I've said on my review for 1.11; if you didn't watch the anime series or 1.11... you might be a little lost.<br />  3.33 won't be out until 2012... late 2012... possibly early 2013 for us if Gainax flips a gasket again.
0061997811|5.0|Haha, it sounds like I love everything I order here. But why else would I order it?  This Magical book about the Harry Potter films is extremely good. If you want to know everything behind the scenes, this is the book for you. It even contains a sneek peak of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, part 2.  Funny facts about everything, and you can even have your own Marauder's map, your own programme of the Yule Ball, etc etc.  If I can find one bad thing? I would like more facts about the last movie, but hopefully there will be a book about just Deathly hallows ;)
B004EPZ06Q|2.0|This month, two hotly anticipated sequels were released- Pirates 4 and Hangover 2. For me, this should have been an awesome movie month. Well, OK, Bridesmaids and Thor were awesome movies- however the thing is, these aren't sequels, they're original concepts (OK, well not really original- I'm talking original as in \\"The start of something\\").<br /><br />OK, now Pirates wasn't a bad movie, it had its share of entertaining scenes, but felt undercooked for the most part, and sadly, Hangover 2 suffers from exactly the same problem... except Pirates 4 was unfortunately much better.<br /><br />Now, I LOVED The Hangover. I remeber when it came out back in 2009 and I loved it so much, I saw it twice. Every viewing was just as entertaining as the first. When I heard a Hangover 2 was being made, I was excited. I figured the first movie was good enough to have a solid sequel, and Todd Phillips knew what he was doing was good. So I patiently anticipated this movie, and when it got released, I was one of the first people in line.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this is no sequel. It is essentially a remake of the first movie. Why is that a problem? Because the first movie was way funnier.<br /><br />The plot is essentially exatly the same... except this time it's set in Thailand. This time, Stu is getting married to a beautiful Thai woman,<br />and Allan is not invited- he has even been rendered Catatonic for that reason. Yet after a bit of convincing, Allan is suddenly invited along, and alredy having problems with the chosen best man- Teddy, Stu's wife-to-be's brother. After a rather disconcerting celebratory dinner at the resort, the gang, with teddy, go down to the resort's beach and have a few drinks... and then the first movie happens... again.<br /><br />I'm sure I don't need to tell you the rest, because I'm assuming you have seen the first movie already, and if you have, you've seen this movie too.<br /><br />The problem with Hangover 2 is that it's just plain not original AT ALL. While it did have a few belly laughs, in particular a scene involving Stu discovering he had sex with a transvestite stripper, they felt forced, and I had felt like I saw it already two years ago. Plenty of people I know, my girlfriend and manager at work included, asked \\"Why didn't you like it? It's exactly the same as the first.\\" The latter sentence is exactly why I was disappointed- I felt that with this being a sequel, they could have introduced something new. Sadly this wasn't the case- everything came from the first movie, and by the end of the movie, I just wanted it to be over. Because I saw it two years ago already, but much funnier. In my opinion, only one movie got away with being a carbon copy of its predecessor- Escape from LA.<br /><br />That being said, maybe if you haven't seen the first movie, you will love this. But if you have, well, hoo boy, prepare yourself for a mega disappointment. They practically REMADE the first movie, all the way down to Stu singing a song about the crap they're in and then some. If you must see it, rent it on blu-ray- it is not worth the $15.75 UltraAVX price I paid to see it.<br /><br />OVERALL: 4/10<br /><br />PROS:<br />-Some great laughs<br />-The cast is great<br />-They did the \\"Photo during the end credits\\" thing again<br /><br />CONS:<br />-A remake, not a sequel<br />-Way too familiar<br />-Familiarity even drives the film to the maddening point of predictability<br />-None of the jokes seem natural at all- forced at best, really.icular a scene involving Stu discovering he had sex with a transvestite stripper, they felt forced, and I had felt like I saw it already two years ago.

B0051QIGP4|3.0|As a huge Lady Gaga fan, I was expecting the new album to include songs with a more pop/dance-like feel. I was slightly disappointed when the new album contained songs very similar to Madonna and not anything like the previous. I think all of her songs now include some hidden \\"message\\" and it doesn't have that same feel-good vibe. There are a few songs that are worth hearing, but other than that, the only good thing about this was the 99 cent deal from Amazon.
1416596585|5.0|Steven Levy is one of the world's best writers when it comes to the intersection of business and technology.  In \\"In the Plex,\\" he does a superb job detailing the roots and rise of Google and how the company has become a major force in people's lives.  I think he gets into the head of Larry Page and Sergey Brin better than any work published to date.  Well, Brin is perhaps still a bit of a mystery, but we surely get to know the character of Page, a thinker of big, bold, audacious ideas with the stomach and strategic vision to act on them.  For much of the public, Page and Brin are the interchangeable 'twins.'  In truth, they're not.  The book makes clear that this is Page's company.<br /><br />Here's Levy spot-on summary of the Page that dominates these pages:<br /><br />\\"[He] was not a social animal - people who talked to him wondered if a jigger of Asperger's was in the mix - and could unnerve people by simply not talking.  But when he did speak, more often he would come out with ideas that bordered on the fantastic.\\"<br /><br />It's that description that led Google's early VC backers to plead that Brin and Page accept \\"adult supervision.\\"  [In a great side story, they relent but insist that they would only consider Steve Jobs.]  Levy's book ends full circle with CEO Eric Schmidt stepping down after 10 years while noting that \\"Day-to-day adult supervision no longer required.\\"<br /><br />It's also worth noting that Schmidt delivered that missive via Twitter.  That brings to mind the strength of his book: though Levy got the approval and cooperation of the ruling troika, he doesn't pull any punches here: while lauding the company for its massive successes, he's not afraid to note where they're fallen short, most notably on the rise of social networking and, in a different vein, on its desultory history with China.<br /><br />On the social networking miss, Levy's writing is especially trenchant.  He notes that a company based on algorithms was blind to the fact that the best recommendation could come from a friend or colleague.  When Google does try to get in to the game late with its \\"Buzz\\" offering, Levy shows how its corporate myopia (thinking that a Google employee was representative of a 'typical' user) blinded itself to a privacy blunder committed on rollout that damages the service right out of the starting gate.<br /><br />While the book loses some steam at the end (the \\"Google.gov\\" chapter before the epilogue is the weakest material), it does not diminish Steve Levy's achievement here.rom a friend or colleague.

B00192KCQ0|5.0|No matter what you do, someone will always complain. People before were complaining how Metallica doesn't sound like they did in the old days. Now they do, and yet people still complain. \\"The Day That Never Comes is a rip off of One and Fade To Black!\\" How exactly do you rip off your own songs? People will continue to complain no matter what. Fantastic album. The mix kinda blows, but I end up listening to the Guitar Hero rips anyways.  Thank god for bands like Metallica and Megadeth still making good music.
B0007LXPBI|4.0|The Parent Trap(1998) is a remake of the 1961 version of The Parent Trap starring Hayley Mills. Both films are based on Erich Kastner's novel Das Dopplete Lottchen. Director Nancy Myers succeeds in keeping the film from getting campy and she does justice to the original 1961 Parent Trap. She also wisely updated the film for people watching it in 1998. A picture of Ricky Nelson is replaced with a picture of Leonardo DiCaprio. The film stars a young Lindsay Lohan when she still had a squeaky-clean image! The story is familiar: two similar looking girls meet at summer camp. They find out that they really are twin sisters. They plot to have their divorced parents get married to eachother again, but a golddigging, sexy blonde woman is after their father and his fortune. Hayley Mills sang 'Let's Get Together' in the original Parent Trap and Lindsay Lohan whistles the tune in this movie. The writers borrow some dialouge from David Swift's script for the 1961 Parent Trap. This Parent Trap remake earned its PG rating. There's a graphic shot of Lohan getting her ears pierced by a needle! Alan Silvestri's music score for The Parent Trap remake is quite solid. This Parent Trap remake is better than those bland, low budget Parent Trap sequels made for television.
B001EN71DG|2.0|I am a Huge star wars fan and bought these DVD's to start sharing them with my 2 year old son.  I was excited that this set had both the original and the newer version of episodes 4-6 that lucas screwed up by adding more scenes.  I was really disappointed that the original versions were only 1/3 the size of the picture on my TV and extremely poor quality.  My VHS copies of these movies were much better quality than these DVD's.  The original versions were obviously after thoughts to try and get people like me to by the set with the newer versions.

0785151303|5.0|I also have The Art of Iron Man 2, and the Thor edition is much better, in my opinion. I love the slipcover, the brown faux leather and gold printing with all of the detail, it's much more impressive than my Iron Man 2 book. I am very glad I bought it, it was a must have for my collection, and it's become one of my favorites.
0316056863|5.0|So glad I was able to pre-order this book for half the cover price! Tina Fey is amazing and I absolutely loved this book. She is so real it's hilarious. She doesn't try to be preachy and say that her way of life is the best, just explains why she is the way she is. I'm glad she did theater for all those years! :) A must read for any fan, and even if you're not, jut try it. The font is big enough where you feel like a speed-reader reading it.
0385333846|5.0|For years my only association with Kurt Vonnegut was from the Rodney Dangerfield movie Back to School. In case your husband hasn't forced you to watch it numerous times (help me!), I'll give you a quick synopsis. Dangerfield plays the part of a successful and rich business owner who goes back to college to help support his wimpy and struggling son.  Only, Dangerfield discovers that he prefers college-style partying to studying so he pays Vonnegut (playing himself in the movie) to come and write a paper about himself for his English course. He fails the assignment because as the professor (and love interest) claims, obviously Dangerfield didn't write the paper himself and whoever did write the paper didn't understand the first thing about Vonnegut.<br /><br />My long-distance book club that I maintain with former college roommates added Vonnegut's Slaughterhouse-Five to our reading list last summer, but we fizzled out and didn't get to it. So we decided to try it again this year. I didn't know what to expect. Honestly, because of the title, I have confused it with Sinclair's The Jungle for years. Surely it has something to do with our meat industry. Right?<br /><br />It's not like that. At all.<br /><br />Vonnegut's Slaughterhouse-Five is funny and irreverent and shocking and hysterical and moving and poignant and seriously disturbing. I enjoyed every minute.<br /><br />And just so you know, Vonnegut is a creative genius nutcase. Oh and he swears. A lot.

B000C13Y2S|5.0|I work in IT, and it is not unusual for me to find myself at a machine somewhere in our office building or at a customer site peering into a darkened spot in the device wishing I had a flashlight handy. I keep a flashlight in my car for other reasons, but it is very inconvenient to have to run out to the parking lot to get it, especially when at a customer's office.<br /><br />I decided it would be a good idea to get a keychain flashlight for my work keys so I always have it handy when I need it at work. Our office is a secure building and I need my keys to move from department to department, so this is the perfect spot to hang a small flashlight.<br /><br />Having already discovered how helpful tripod flashlights are with the [[ASIN:B001DV7PBW Stanley 95-155 3-in-1 Tripod LED Flashlight]], I was delighted to find that Stanley makes a similar flashlight for keychains. Buying the smaller version of the tripod flashlight was just a no-brainer for me.<br /><br />Already I have found the Stanley 95-113 to be indispensable. The versatility of being able to hold and point the flashlight or set it on its tripod to be able to use both hands is immensely helpful. No matter if I need to read the model number on a computer motherboard or get a good look inside a scanner or printer, this flashlight does exactly what I need it to.
0756404738|2.0|About a little girl who's whole family was killed by a big, bad wolf.  She is on the road looking for the wolf, when she comes upon a house, the house has three beds, she tries the first bed, too firm, she tries the second bed, too soft, she tries the third bed, just right.  After taking a nice long nap, she goes downstairs and there are three bowls of porridge, she tries the first, but its too hot, then she tries the second but its too cold, then she tries the third and its just right.  After gobbling all of that porridge up, she hears a noise, and three bears come in, she screams and runs away back onto the road, after travelling all day she sees a little cottage, and its made completely out of candy!  Curiously she walks up to the house and breaks off a piece of brick, but its actually ginger bread, and it tastes amazing, just then an old lady opens the door, and invite the girl in to have some dinner.  The girl is much obliged because she has been walking all day and is very hungry.  The old lady is heating up the oven and they engage in a nice conversation, and talk about how her house is all made of candy, and how wonderful that is, and then the oven is ready and all the sudden the old lady grabs the girl by the hair and tries to throw her in the oven, but the girl is not having any of that and kicks down hard on the old ladys foot sending her reeling back, and then the girl throws the old lady, who she now realizes is a witch, right into the oven and she closes it and runs.      This is how this book is.  It is not bad writing, its just completely random, all over the place, and has nothing to do with the storyline we are expecting.  Hey you wanted to pretty much ignore the chandrian, and Kvothes parents death in the first book, so you could give us an idea of who Kvothe is and his trials and tribulations of life, you took us on a journey that really didn't prove anything of the main storyline of the Chanrian.  But now you release a second book, that is insanely long, and has even less to do with Chandrian and Kvothes lust for revenge.  We spent the second half of the book without any of the characters we actually know and love.  Through the entire journey of the book we learned nothing new or exciting and the book ends in entirely the same fashion as the first.  Like I said, the writing was great as usual, and the first 40% of the book was fine enough, but it never went anywhere, and we learned nothing.  Overall a complete waste of time that I can sum up the storyline, to anyone not willing to read the entire book, in a short paragraph below.    **SPOILER SUMMATION IN A PARAGRAPH**    Kvothes story continues at school.  He has more problems with Ambrose and they fight a lot.  Kvothe talks more with Denna and has problems getting close to her  Kvothe has to leave school for a term because he had a big fight with Ambrose.  Kvothe goes to the other side of the world to serve for a noble man, he saves his life and also takes care of bandits stealing the kings taxes  Kvothe also meets a faerie who he has sex with and she tries to keep him forever, but he uses magic and music to impress her and she lets him go  Kvothe then goes to a school with someone he met during bandit killing so he can clear this persons name of teaching him a secret way of living and fighting, they invite Kvothe to learn their secret craft, and he does and everyone loves him  He leaves there and finds people pretending to be Edema Ruh troupers that have taken two beautiful 16 year old girls as slaves and are raping them daily, Kvothe kills them all and saves the girls and sends them home  Kvothe returns back to the school where he talks with his friends again, and talks with Denna, but still can't get as close as he'd like with her.  Kvothe stops telling the story and goes to his room to wait to die.    The end.
B001GCUO5M|5.0|Superb!!    First half of the movie is slow, dark, and many times boring. But don't worry, it gets much better.    Prepare yourself for a twist that will sweep you off your feet! Guaranteed.    Its the kind of movie that you will want to watch all over again to check all the little details and clues that make the final conclusion make sense.
B002SSUQFG|5.0|First, it took 6 days from the day I ordered this watch until I received it in Iraq (via APO). That is amazingly fast for anything that goes via the APO system. Kudos to the vendor sfor racing this out the door so quickly.<br /><br />Second, the packaging and documentation are straight forward. It was quite simple setting the watch up for its first use. The fabric strap band is comfortable, and unless you have forearms like Popeye, you will be able to adjust the tightness to their preference. The watch is analog intuitive, so just set the date and time, put it on and go.<br /><br />Third, this is not a bulky wristwatch. If you think you need a larger watch this one is not for you. The Seiko SNK809 is a clean design with a low profile. To me that means there will be less to get caught on sleeves, jackets and so on.<br /><br />Another great Amazon experience. Thank you.
B004EPYZP8|3.0|I am not sure why, but I got the impression that only people in specific professions/fields (e.g. Law)would appreciate such a movie. It is too detailed and complicated that won't be appreciated by everyone. I tried to pay as much attention as possible to the story's details however still got lost and didn't get all of it.    I know this is a good movie, however not for everyone.
B004JN1D2I|3.0|As many who reviewed this item, I agree that the kindle version wasn't well planed due to the fact that all the books are in a single file.  On the other hand, the books are great. I'm finishing the first one and I can't stop reading.  Therefore I give an overall three stars review for a five stars book compilation with a one star Kindle version.    How ever, it is readable so If you wan't to buy it (knowing the fact that we are talking about four books in one file), DO SO. These are GREAT books after all.

First of all, it's impossible to take my phone out of my jeans without turning the pocket inside out. Plus, I always have to use both hands.  Second, because it's better at sticking to pocket liners than the phone, the case invariably becomes partially removed. It's incredibly annoying.
B000SMWUPS|5.0|I bought this to use as a cup holder on my BOB Revolution stroller, since the ones from BOB cost more than twice as much. This fits the stroller great. A few reviewers have mentioned needing to take the holder off when you collapse the stroller so you don't bend it - but this is not an issue with the BOB. The pouch has a metal ring around the top surface that holds it open, but the sides are just fabric. With a stroller with 2 individual handles that collapse inward you would need to remove it so as to not bend the metal, but if you have a bar handled stroller you can collapse it and it collapses vertically just fine.    The two cupholders on the sides are neoprene dividers, they seem to accommodate a large range of cup sizes so far. The large center section has a zippered pocket it the back that is pretty small but would hold a set of keys or a phone. I'm not sure why you'd need to zip something in unless it was going to be something you'd leave with the stroller between uses, but there you go. The center compartment can hold a lot - phone, snacks, toys, etc. You can also put the neoprene of the cupholders to the sides if you want more center room or only have one cup. It attaches to the stroller handles via two velcro loops on the sides - the velcro is the whole length of the loop so it would fit a very wide range of handle types/sizes.     Overall works great for me.
B003ZSI7R2|3.0|I love the band - having heard them on Jools Holland I was excited to get a CD but...  it did NOT do them justice - I think because of the quality of the recording - not enough treble - just nowhere near as good as their live performance, what a shame.
B004Z2TUGE|4.0|this was a fun and entertaining movie to watch, if you are not just into being a critic, trying to analyze it to death.
B00006LLLN|5.0|We saw this group way back in the late 80's (If I remember correctly) in Manitowish Waters Wis. Alison was sick with the flu and still gave a fantastic performance. They even stayed around afterwards to jam! I have always loved this group since. This album has it all, everything you would expect from them. The special guest added a depth to the album also. Hands down the best Bluegrass performers today!
B0051MKMNC|4.0|Limitless has a fascinating premise: what if there was a pill that would make you smarter. Of course it's not that simple; the film does raise some good moral questions about such a pill and its consequences, and I would've like to have seen that avenue explored a bit more. The performances are adequate, and Robert DeNiro has a few good stand-out scenes. The plot is paced fairly well and a few actions scenes are peppered in for good measure, but what you'll likely enjoy most about this film are the conversations you'll have with your friends afterward.
B00005JY1O|5.0|Sounds very pure and clean. No scratches or any other problem i could detected. Arrived on time. Everything was OK.
B004WCTLNY|3.0|Based on a short story by Philip K. Dick, this isn't at all the Bourne-esque action-thriller the trailers led me to believe it would be. I don't feel like I can say much without spoiling the plot and some interesting reveals; so, on that note, I'll just say it's a story about faith and faith in love and one's own right to choose how to experience love. The performances were adequate, the concept intriguing, but I never really connected emotionally with the characters as people. The ending was gratifying yet fairly predictable, and I left the theater feeling like I saw an OK film that had missed opportunities to be a great film.
B00275EHJG|5.0|Aw! Watched this with my 15 and 22 year old kids...and it made us cry (okay, not my 15 yo son, but he still laughed a lot and enjoyed it).  There was such a feeling of nostalgia in this movie.  I thought of all the toys my kids used to play with, how much they loved them, and really hoped they were all safe is boxes in the attic to pull out and reminisce over someday. Toy Story 3 was full of action and comedy and a lot of heart.  Great movie!
B0050PYNP8|3.0|Simon Pegg & Nick Frost have made a career of simultaneously parodying and creating films of the genres they love. They did it masterfully with zombies in \\"Shaun of the Dead,\\" and not quite as masterfully with action films in \\"Hot Fuzz.\\" \\"Paul\\" is their take on the sci-fi genre and it falls somewhere between their previous two collaborations in terms of success. The film either goes for laughs in mostly slapsticky, crude ways, or relies on nods to previous genre films. The film's goal to cram in as many ball jokes and geek references as they can kind of leaves me wishing for some wittier dialogue like Pegg & Frost had in their BBC series \\"Spaced.\\"  For sci-fi geeks this film is a no-brainer (Braiiiiinnnnsss! Sorry, bad zombie pun.), but non genre fans will likely find themselves wanting for laughs.
0891419063|5.0|I read this book some time ago, before the HBO mini-series that relied heavily on this book.  If you are looking for a book that will give you an historical account of the marines in the Pacific, this book is not for you.  If you want an accurate account of what it was like to actually be there in the nightmare that was the war in the Pacific, then you have come to the right place.  Pfc Sledge wrote most of this book as it happened.  It was taken directly from the daily journal he kept during the war and reflects his personal experiences of battle.  There is no attempt to romanticize or glorify war, nor does he seek to embellish the role he played.  Although the events he described are historically accurate, this book is meant to be experiential rather than historical.<br /><br />Mr. Sledge takes us from his life before the war, through basic training, and then through the battles in which he participated.  Unlike others who reviewed this book, I found it neither repetitious nor too long.  It is only as repetitious as war itself.  To me it is essential that the book be as long and detailed as it is.  Although Peleliu and Okinawa were as intense as Tarawa, they did not end in 76 hours, like Tarawa. They went on for weeks, and in the case of Okinawa, for three months.  Both these battles are a testament to the incredible endurance and comittment displayed by all those who fought, bleed and died for their contry, both American and Japanese.<br /><br />If you want a feel good book about the war in the Pacific that is an historical chronicle, essentially devoid of the emotions that make war as horrific and real as it is (like \\"The Pacific\\"), then this is not the book for you. If you want an accurate,raw and reaistic depiction of the war in the Pacific, then this is the book to read. If there is a true classic that came out of the war in the Pacific, this is the book.  It is as much a classic as the Civil War classic \\"Company Aytch\\".  I have read probably too many books about the marines during WWII, and, to me, this is the best of them.  Also, Eugene Sledge has been cited by more writers on this topic, including Ambrose, than just about any other author. Kind of says something.during WWII, and, to me, this is the best of them.

B0034G4P8A|5.0|Marvel Studios pulls off another great superhero film that has a story so wisely rooted in humanity (the relationship between a father and his sons) and well told that it doesn't matter that the father in question is the inter-dimensional king Odin and his sons are Thor and Loki. It's a very epic, very Shakespearean story in nature, so it was equally wise Marvel got veteran on-screen Shakespearean Kenneth Branagh to direct.
0817439390|3.0|Don't get me wrong, this book is a great tool for the beginning photographer.  However, I found that you can learn just as much by reading articles and blogs online.  Some of the concepts and terms in this book are a bit advanced, so if you are a beginner, you may not understand some of the material.  However, I think the book is definitely a good read for the beginning photographer and a pretty good deal.
B0050PYNN0|4.0|Much like \\"Pineapple Express\\" was a stoner comedy set in an action film, this is stoner comedy set in magical, medieval times. The film tries to straddle the fine line between parody and, uh, not parody. Unfortunately, it fails more often than it succeeds. I should probably give this film three stars, but it has Natalie Portman kicking butt and showing it; that alone bumps this film up to four stars. Bottom line is if you like these two genres then this will be a movie worth your time. If not then it's not.
0446677450|1.0|It's easy to point at Bill Gates and other few rich people, who didn't finish the university, but what about the other 99%, whose life gone downwards? You might not set up a new Microsoft, just because you are bored of learning in school...    It's easy to pick the businesses that worked out, he tells in his book to start your own business so you are nobody's employee, BUT what about the 80-90% of the businesses that aren't as successful? Does every enterpreneur get rich? Nope.     What IS true is that he has got a good nose for money, as this book is quite popular, isn't it?
B003Y5H5KQ|4.0|A rudimentary summary of the film's plot is an adolescent girl is kept in isolation and trained to be an assassin. But it's so much more than that. The film is a hyperbolic take on a modern day Grimm's Fairy tale. Most people forget these fairy tales were originally meant to teach children about the dangers of the woods (world) as they were meant to entertain. And such is the tale of Hanna, whose father teachers her about the dangers of the world and tries his best to protect her from the wicked world and the wicked \\"queen' out to see her slain.    This film gets a bit heavy on the Brother's Grimm analogies and symbolism, but has great, Bourne-esque action sequences, wonderful characters and performances (even though Cate Blanchett's Southern accent is kind of awful) and an intriguing plot. Not to mention the excellent soundtrack by the Chemical Brothers.
0689835604|5.0|My toddler was given this book when she was about 18 months old.

B003XX2PD6|2.0|There is nothing that stands out on this album. The singer is nothing special. The band is nothing special. It's all pretty much slow tempo, alternative rock music that could have been written during anytime from the 80's to today. The only thing saving this album from a one star rating is the creepy dwarf on the cover of the album and the fact that they write and play instruments.
B00020VWMS|5.0|This is a must have part of your indie, dance, electronica library. If you don't have it, buy it because you have missed out for a decade on an awesome music and band!

B004NSULHM|4.0|I will buy radiohead music no matter what, that's my mantra. This album is just as enigmatic and contagious as their previous work, though they sound different, different beat, tune which I can appreciate. I listen track 1-4 over and over and the later track I get lost and can't tell the difference. I commend that they tried for a different sound and beat. Thom also has extended his vocal cord (higher pitch) yet still sound rhythmic and the familiar melancholy feel.
1400079144|3.0|In chap. 107 of this book, the author writes about one of Ms. Katherine Solomon's Noetic Experiments: Weighing the Soul of a very old man ready to die in a completely closed plastic box, using her very sensitive scale. The normal weight of the experimental subject just before his death was 51.4534644 kg! What a sensitive scale! (if such a scale is really available for human weighing.) And Katherine got a minuscule decrease in the weight after his death. How much was the minuscule decrease? Unfortunately, the author did not report. The decrease might have been exactly 1/3000 of an ounce, 1/2222 of the 21 g, which Dr. Duncan MacDougall reported for his first patient in his experimental paper published in 1907. (As you might know, the 1/3000 of an ounce appeared in a tabloid, Weekly World News, Nov. 1988, as an experimentally measured weight of the soul reported by the then East German scientists.) There have been criticisms against MacDougall that he failed to do the experiment putting his dying subjects in a completely closed system. Hence, it appears that Katherine used a completely closed box. Even if Dan Brown may think that this procedure of Katherine will not be scientifically criticized, there are several criticisms, which appeared at the website \\"Noetic Sciences.\\" These are: (1) the claimed experimentally measured weight of the soul, 1/3000 of an ounce (0.00945 g), for 200 terminally ill subjects reported in the tabloid apparently has no scientific ground (because there exists no corresponding peer-review paper published in any scientific journal), (b) if one takes into account the dynamic effect of heart beating (the maximum amplitude of beating can be as great as +/-150 gf), as well as breathing, on the weighing experiment, it will be impossible to measure the weight of a living human in such a precision, 51.4534644 kg!  Hence, the author had better revise the writing before going public with his new-coming movie.  By the way, the gruesome manner the bad guyimposed on the three, apparently good, people in the book is really nauseating, at least to me. If Dan Brown really thinks a possibility of our thought having mass (M), the energy (E = Mc^2) might be so great that his description of this merciless deeds of the bad guy may have a bad impact on the society. Hate of bad deeds will never be an answer to eliminate such deeds; only love for good deeds brings about the condition for good deeds!
B003Y5H53S|5.0|It's  not really a kids movie per se, although my 7-year old was entranced and was able to provide quite a thorough summary the next day. Don't assume your child won't like it. Many of the reviews already mentioned how magical the film is and the wonderful animation. I would concur. The only thing that most people didn't mention was the wonderful music. Many of the scenes are tied together with a little animal mariachi band in a sort of tribute to Cat Ballou. The film is masterful and I wouldn't wish to spoil it for anyone by telling you any more. Take a chance on this one, I think you will love Rango!

1932100660|2.0|I've studied nutrition all my life, having been a marathon runner and body builder. This book flabbergasted me. The author advocates low protein diets, and advises us to stay clear of milk protein, the best type of protein. His research also suggests eliminating all animal protein from your diet, such as beef, and pork. Beef is known to contain high amounts of B complex vitamins. The author also tells us to get our protein from plant food. It's common knowledge that plant protein is incomplete protein, and must match up with other types of protein to be useful to the body. Moreover, the author also tells us that milk causes cancer. And that calcium causes cancer!<br /><br />I've seen elderly people close to death because of being over medicated; doctors didn't have a clue. I suggested they go on a high protein diet, using whey protein shakes, and the recovery was amazing. They were up and about, appetites were back, and energy levels picked up. I seriously doubt the validity of claims in this book, although the author states the research doesn't lie. Most of the research was carried out with rats.<br /><br />It's true that colon cancer is more prevalent with meat eaters. The author doesn't look at exercise in the diet, and obesity. He states that cancer can be reversed by diet. It reminds me of the macrobiotic diet fad years ago, when people ate brown rice alone. I suggest that a person's life style, diet and exercise all contribute to cancer. We're born with genetic dispositions, and how we deal with our genes is extremely important to our health.<br /><br />Added on 3/5/12: Since learning milk contains toxins, from chemicals farmers give to cows, I stopped drinking dairy milk. I now drink almond milk, and feel much better.
B0051QIGP4|3.0|Album is alright.  Not as good as I expected but I'm not a huge Lady Gaga fan.  It was, however, definitely worth the $0.99.  I'm actually really only writing this review because I wish Amazon had been better prepared.  I bought it the second time it was $0.99 and it DL'd in a minute.  The Cloud service rocks and I think this promo may really help them.  I'm backing up all my music as we speak and will likely buy the $20 a year for 20g package.  I just hope the mess-up didn't send more customers running than it converted over.  I'll be buying all my music through Amazon instead of iTunes now.  I still don't understand why iTunes forces you to install the application to buy music.
B0045FTR0K|5.0|The 5 star rating is for the content of the disc and the sound quality of the mastering. I own Songs in the Key of Life on vinyl LP, the original Motown/ Tamla 2 CD set, and previously the AF gold disc. Imagine this: would you rather have creamy smooth full-flavored ale or a Budweiser? The SHM-SACD is hands down the most dynamic, full-bodied presentation of this classic recording I've come across. It is also the most expensive. So unless you have a dedicated SACD player you're better off trying to find yourself the original Tamla 2 CD set, which is sonically comparable to the AF gold disc. Not much difference to justify the extra cost there. Avoid the remaster (harsh). Regarding the SHM-SACD, the low-end is well extended, mostly punchy, but slightly boomy on some tracks. Mids are forward and lush, and highs are well controlled and not harsh in the slightest.  I also find the recording generally mellow, and in a very good way. Listening to the SACD I feel like I've been transported back in time to the days of 70s hi-fi, where the sound is beautifully analog, warm and smooth, which IMO adds more depth and character to this particular pressing. It has all the characteristics of a nice vinyl pressing, but without the surface noise, snap, crackle and pop. It seems like great care was taken to preserve the natural sound of the original recording (regardless of the source) and provide us with a nice solid flat transfer. If one desires more emphasis on the top end you only need to adjust your treble a bit and you should be plenty happy. Overall, I prefer the way it sounds as is and feel no need to tweak any settings. It's perfectly \\"imperfect\\" if that makes any sense. There are reports that this SACD has issues playing back on some players during track one. It plays back on my Yamaha DVD-S1800 with no issues. However, I've read that there is a firmware update available to address this issue on some units. The disc itself is packaged in an mini-LP style case and rest in a scratch resistant inner sleeve housed in a hard paper outer sleeve. Given it's a Japanese import there's an obi strip for your viewing pleasure (apparently this matters to some collectors). Liner notes are mostly in Japanese. Universal Japan SHM-SACD build quality is second to none. You can easily tell great care went into the manufacturing of these discs. The SHM coating is supposed to enhance sound quality. Apparently there's some science behind this claim that I won't go into here, but Google is your friend if you want to learn more. Personally, I'm not sure if I buy into it, but the discs do look uber sexy if that matters to you. One thing to note is that the SHM-SACDs typically are not hybrids, so don't dive in expecting this to be a dual layer disc that you can play on any old standard CD player. Overall, a worthy investment if you're a fan of this album. Be warned that once you go SHM-SACD it can be a very expensive (but rewarding) path to sonic ecstasy. Given Innervisions, Fulfillingness' First Finale, Talking Book and Hotter Than July have all been announced on SHM-SACD, it can prove to be a very expensive year indeed, especially if the mastering is just as pleasant as SITKOL. Good luck.

B00511ONPG|5.0|In the spirit of transparency, I worked very closely with Dave with making this book happen, but that doesn't mean I can't put in my two cents to help realize what you're about to dive into.  Whether you're a small business owner looking to crack into the social media space to help your business excel, a social media enthusiast who wants to see exactly what it means to be \\"likeable,\\" or someone who knows NOTHING about social media and wants to see what the craze is all about...Likeable Social Media will appeal to you. If you look at the chapters as rules and guidelines instead of just chapters the read will be extremely fun and exciting. As that small business owner, Dave's action items will be great to test out just how likeable your social media endeavors really are. The appendix at the end, which is really more of the ultimate guide to all things social, will help the beginners out there get started and give a refresher to those who think they know it all.  In the end, the best take away you will get from Dave's book is learning how to be truly likeable.  ENJOY!

B004Q7E0TA|5.0|This book took me by surprise. I bought it because it was on sale and I knew of Portia from \\"Arrested Development\\", one of my favorite shows. Although I recalled reading about how she had an eating disorder in some gossip magazine at some point, I shrugged it off as another Hollywood actress succumbing to the spotlight pressures. After reading this amazing book (in one day, I might add), I feel ashamed by my initial cold and heartless reaction. I think that as a society, we've become so desensitized to \\"skinny Hollywood actresses\\" with anorexia that we fail to recognize the reality of this life-threatening disorder. Recounting her struggles with eating disorders in incredible detail, Portia writes about her battle with poetic flair and emotional sincerity. \\"Unbearable Lightness\\" is a terrific book and I certainly recommend it!

B00511ONPG|5.0|I originally thought that Social Media was just a digital platform for narcissistic B List celebrities who had a recurring need to inform the world when they were eating or waiting for a cab. After reading Dave Kerpen's \\"Likeable Social Media\\" I now realize how narrow minded this view was. When used correctly, Social Media is an effective tool which companies of all sizes can use to identify, grow, connect, inform and serve their customer base.     Effective Social Media involves listening to your customers in an honest, non-phony way; providing real value for free without worrying about \\"giving away the store\\"; promptly responding to crises; developing a feel good online persona and inspiring the customer base. The book is packed with numerous case studies and action items detailing exactly how to achieve these necessary attributes.     This is a book which must be read slowly, earmarked, and read again and again. There is so much to digest--even the author admits most Social Media success is the result of a consistent slow, well thought out process. I intend to employ as many of these valuable ideas into my small tutoring business. Maybe, just maybe, I will be able to take this business to the next level on a shoe string marketing budget.

B000GL1BHO|5.0|This is a wonderful Pteranodon. Papo figures are exquisitely hand painted and relatively lifelike. Although this is a small figure, I believe it to be the most realistic of all the versions I have seen.

B004K4AVAG|2.0|I think I have figured it out. This is actually just a weird performance art piece and the joke is on all of us. The idea was to regurgitate everything bad about 80s and 90s music and see how many people will buy it and actually think it is good and intended to be good, just because they love Lady GaGa.  With the Born this Way album we get a few awful 80s style saxophone solos that are cringe inducing at best. On top of that, we get a bizarre, no reason for it, song sung half in German (99 Luft Balloons anyone?). The bad keyboarding reminds me of Tiffany and Debbie Gibson. Now I know Gaga was busy being born when those two were popular, but even the teens then knew the music then was awful. And electric guitar solos? I kept thinking this has got to be a joke! To make matters worse, there is a cacophony of all the worst 90s techno noises here and there for no apparent reason other than to grate on your nerves and see if you can make it through the song without intentionally ramming your car into a wall. Given her past creativity and overall talent, I can't come to any other conclusion than this is all just a joke on all of us. Personally I love The Fame/Monster and actually like the title track, and less so Judas. The final indication of her performance art intention is the inclusion of obvious Madonna rip offs, including the reworking of \\"Express Yourself\\" into \\"Born this Way\\", and all the catholic Jesus, Mary, Judas references. I mean \\"Black Jesus\\"? Seriously? That is so \\"Like a Prayer\\" 1989.
B004A8ZX2S|5.0|It's a film about love and nothing else except its succeeding and failing through and beyond death. The eighteen year old eldest son of this family dies and the film is the full description of the process of mourning for the father and the mother of that child who had two other brothers and these son's mourning is intertwined into that of their parents. That explains the practically uncontrollable expression of pain and suffering of the beginning and the rather tamed final scene of that mourning after or around the burial of the son or brother.<br /><br />The mourning process is psychologically traumatic to the two parents and sends them back into the past. Since the son died then this death's concatenation with what we know of how he lived explains, justifies or caused this death. They start from the beginning, from their own encounter, and then all the important events in the family, for the parents and for the children will punctuate what happens on the screen. The point is that the whole film is a collage and that makes it difficult to follow but fascinating to the eyes.<br /><br />Difficult to follow because actually fully acted scenes with a fully developed dialogue are rare and short. Most of the film is the evocation of events in purely visual scenes and special effects. Passion, birth, that enormous trauma for the parents and the child is systematically evoked by volcano eruptions, lava flowing, incandescent pictures over-invading the screen.<br /><br />Those scenes are meaningful because of the linear and transitive line of the visual show. It would be a mistake to identify one of these visual effects as having a clear meaning. It is never the case and the volcanic eruption comes several times, each time carrying the memory of the previous time and enriching the new instance with its clustered circumstantial new meaning.<br /><br />Three sons in one family make the Oedipian complex of one of them, in that case the one who will die at eighteen, the eldest son, difficult to assume and negotiate. The father wants to literally possess his eldest son and he wants his wife to reject this son, in order to reinforce the father's takeover. It does not work because the father does not understand the attachment to the mother is natural and the inspiration from the father has to be based not on the rejection of the mother but on the project the son may have for himself.<br /><br />A severe economic crisis in the family will naturally build tremendous frustrations and thus will support a never clearly said vision that the death of the eldest son was the result of his suicide death instinct rooted in the deep resentment of the extreme and even excessive authority of the castrating father.<br /><br />But the film is a great film because the plot could be made explicit and detailed in one page, whereas in this film most of it is the expression if not telling of that plot along two visual lines. On one hand the parallel between the visual effects on the screen and the story of the film. On the other side the architecture of the visual medium, effects, scenes. Then it becomes the plot of the visual effects, how they progress and build a beginning, a middle and an end.<br /><br />We have to feel that plot, that depth, that drama in the mourning with our eyes and ears but not with our brain or linguistic capability. This film is thus the acme of cinematographic art since it mainly speaks to us through its visual and auditory , if not only sonorous, mediatic dimensions.<br /><br />That cinema is a universal language and the words, the few words, are no longer important, except in their tones, in their musical dimension.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAUtiate. The father wants to literally possess his eldest son and he wants his wife to reject this son, in order to reinforce the father's takeover. It does not work because the father does not understand the attachment to the mother is natural and the inspiration from the father has to be based not on the rejection of the mother but on the project the son may have for himself.    A severe economic crisis in the family will naturally build tremendous frustrations and thus will support a never clearly said vision that the death of the eldest son was the result of his suicide death instinct rooted in the deep resentment of the extreme and even excessive authority of the castrating father.    But the film is a great film because the plot could be made explicit and detailed in one page, whereas in this film most of it is the expression if not telling of that plot along two visual lines. On one hand the parallel between the visual effects on the screen and the story of the film. On the other side the architecture of the visual medium, effects, scenes. Then it becomes the plot of the visual effects, how they progress and build a beginning, a middle and an end.     We have to feel that plot, that depth, that drama in the mourning with our eyes and ears but not with our brain or linguistic capability. This film is thus the acme of cinematographic art since it mainly speaks to us through its visual and auditory , if not only sonorous, mediatic dimensions.    That cinema is a universal language and the words, the few words, are no longer important, except in their tones, in their musical dimension.    Dr Jacques COULARDEAU

0399536108|4.0|\\"You can create the life you want, you can make the world a better place at the same time, and you can have it all.\\" ~ pg. 43<br /><br />Some people would love to travel the world while working on their laptop computers. This is the type of person this book will inspire.<br /><br />Basically this book is an explanation of Chris Guillebeau's lifestyle, his choices and his preferences. This is part memoir, part travel stories, part rebellion against working in a cubicle.<br /><br />I liked Chris' idea about \\"radical exclusion.\\" By making some things a top priority you can get a lot done. I've been living this principle in order to review thousands of books over the past eleven years. I don't like to travel the world as much as I love to travel through author's minds. I also think his ideas about giving up TV are essential if you want to get more done.<br /><br />There is some conflicting information in this book like Chris talks about a 168 hour work week with basically no sleep and then admits he takes days off and probably actually sleeps now and then. He also talks about becoming a virtual recluse and not answering the phone or dealing with email. He then explains how he answers lots of emails. He admits to being a bit of an introvert.<br /><br />What is missing from so many books on living your own life is the concept of giving back to the world in some way. I like that this author talks about giving to charity and also volunteering.<br /><br />What I didn't find out by reading this book is how exactly the author makes money. For information on how to start various businesses you will need to visit the author's site. I would have enjoyed being enlightened on how the author makes money with his writing.<br /><br />So this book is more inspirational than practical. Although there are some ideas about traveling cheaply and some ideas about how to get people to support you in your new ventures.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review
1594484805|5.0|As an expert recruitment consultant, understanding human behavior and motivation is important to my clients' success.  Therefore, when a client suggests that I read a book I read the book.<br /><br />\\"Drive - The Surprising Truth About What Motivates Us\\" by Daniel H. Pink is one of those books.  I read the entire book in two sittings over a wet Memorial Day weekend.<br /><br />Over my 30 years as a professional in the recruitment industry, I have observed human behavior and obviously tried to influence change.  There were times that I observed behavior and motivation with interest, but did not understand what I was observing.  Dan Pink's book helped me understand the science behind my observations - and even my own motivations and behavior.  (Interestingly I am listening to Bob Dylan's \\"All I Really Want to Do\\" right now)<br /><br />There have been clients that knew they needed change in their recruitment efforts.  They resisted change with all of their might.  Clients have looked at tweaks in their recruitment process that I suggested and told me the company was not ready for change.  Another HR department required that I take HIPPA training prior to accessing their applicant tracking system (not sure how HIPPA and ATS interact - they are not medical records).  These companies will have problems moving to the newest release of motivating employees - Motivation 3.0.  Dan uses scientific evidence to demonstrate many companies need to change from management by control to influencing companies to encourage autonomy, mastery, and purpose among their employees.<br /><br />Isn't it interesting to hear companies complain about poor retention and then are too \\"busy\\" to do anything about it, especially initiate needed change?  For those companies, employees are a commodity not valued as contributors.<br /><br />Dan looks at companies like Atlassian, an Australian software company that instituted \\"FedEx Days\\".  \\"At two P.M. on a Thursday, the day begins. Engineers...crash out new code or an elegant hack - any way they want, with anyone they want.  Many work through the night.  Then, at 4 P.M. on Friday, they show the results to the rest of the company in a wild-and-woolly all-hands meeting stocked with ample quantities of cold beer and chocolate cake.  Atlassian calls these twenty-four-hour bursts of freedom and creativity \\"FedEx Days\\" - because people have to deliver something overnight.\\" (Page 91)  The company has benefitted from these creations.  How many of you use Gmail? Google engineers created Gmail during a similar exercise.<br /><br />This book packs a punch! Dan discusses how compensation may create behavior that is opposite of the expected result.  He demonstrates that employees whose jobs \\"flow\\" are more productive and happier.  He points out that in many cases our education system is working against science in the education of our children.  More importantly, Dan uses that science to suggest how to attain Motivation 3.0.<br /><br />Dan includes a Type I toolkit to help companies move from Motivation 2.0 to the new release, Motivation 3.0.  The Toolkit is very interesting with additional book suggestions.  Read \\"Drive\\" prior to reading the 3 different synopsis of his book.  I highly recommend this book.hey want, with anyone they want.  Many work through the night.

B0026OR2PE|4.0|Fascinating book not just on the so called myths around inventors and their innovations but also on the challenges of managing creativity. In the beginning Scott provides perspective on famous and historic inventors and inventions. Later on he provides structure on fostering personal creativity, managing other possible innovators and provides a framework for pitching your eventual brilliant idea to other people.<br /><br />I've long since realized well-known creators are normal people who have an uncanny talent, drive, and (lots of) help to see their mission through no matter what the cost. I respect it, even if it's wrong and/or they fail. I also understood before this book that most \\"innovations\\" are just continuous, progressive steps and not epiphanies or leaps. Other concepts such as the Innovators Dilemma come up when reading business books.<br /><br />The most fascinating / important parts of Myths of Innovation revolve around Scott's desire to help others foster their creativity. He shows people ways to leverage their creative time, what types of roadblocks they can expect to see in the future and even how to pitch their eventual ideas. After all, the most difficult periods the inventor and idea have are from conception to the time right before it becomes accepted. Well worth the read. Good history lesson.
054531058X|5.0|ok, this book blew my mind (sorry for the redundancy). It was so well written, so action packed, and did I mention well written?  PROS  -the author cleverly uses the present tense.  I know this does not seem like a big deal, but it really affects how the book is read. I think this is what sold the book, its all stream of consciousness, first person, present tense.  The events of the book happen as you read it, which makes the story so much more immersive and gripping. the tense doesn't seem like a big deal, but subconsciously, it reels in your mind and makes it more...tense (pun alert).    -the action/plot.  If you like action, look no further aside from the tense bit, this book seems like, no, IS a modern adaptation of a Roman Coliseum arena match.  But is more immersive because we know the characters and feel their desperation. Some whine the first 50 pages were boring, but it wasn't that bad and it was necessary exposition that simply made the rest of it all shine  -clever writing.  collins uses allusions to Roman era/Julius caesar wisely.  lit dorkinesss aside, the plot is constructed nicely, its gripping, and collins manipulates tragic and morbid elements well enough to create shock, but not too strong as to totally destroy the novel.  -the setting. THe setting (panem, a dystopian, post-apoctalyptic america) is punished for a failed rebellion by forcing kids to compete in a labyrinth ala crete/roman gladiator style. very creative, strong roots in classical literature/history, and feels so relatable because its so heartbreaking and, let's face it, feasible.  There's nothing fantastic (as in made up) its in the future, and tyrannies can be cruel.  Who knows what america has in store in the future, are we the precursors to the citizens of panem???    CONS (as if)  -a little short for my preference.  this is just nit picking honestly, the book is so amazing im whining that it ended so fast! just 300 ish pages? really? i could read a doctoral dissertation on this stuff for crying out loud!  -that love triangle. to prevent spoiling anything (although i wouldnt call it spoiling) collins uses a certain love triangle thats obvious from less than page 100, it was a little cliche and predictable, even melodramatic. but heck, what's a little cliche gonna do?    all in all, despite it being short and having that one painful element, you'd be stupid not to read this book! 5/5 stars for hunger games!!!
0375831002|5.0|I had heard of this book before but never had a chance to read it until now.  I'm sorry I waited!  It is one of those books that you can't wait to get to the end but you want to read it forever.

0061537969|5.0|Regretfully, I wasn't expecting much of this book.  I usually dislike books that give animal's a human voice and feelings.  This book, however, is charmingly written.  The dog does have human as well as dog feelings and knows something about incarnation which figures in the plot at the end.  I thoroughly enjoyed this book and wish my dog who sometimes seems to have human feelings could communicate out loud instead of inside his head as the dog in the story does.  Anyone who has ever loved a dog and had to say goodbye before it seemed time to do so will identify with the characters in the book.  I recommend it highly as it is both a quick read and a believable plot.  It's a book that will stay with you for a long, long time.
B000A2W1X2|5.0|I was captivated by this lavishly filmed and well acted movie. When I first watched Firelight, I was wondering how come I had never heard of it before...and felt strangely betrayed, as if left out of a special secret that some people knew about but I didn't. I am a huge fan of Jane Eyre, Wuthering Heights, Pride and Prejudice and nearly all other Hollywood, Masterpiece Theatre, or BBC productions of the same genre: scenic English countrysides, heart-wrenching romances,period pieces, etc. This movie was so spellbinding that I've watched it three times in less than a month and bought three copies to keep and give as gifts. Also, this is no ordinary \\"chick flick\\" as the guys who see it are also emotionally moved. I am looking forward to checking out the newest version of Jane Eyre (2011), but I believe Firelight will remain my new favorite movie for a long, long time. By way of information, I hate gratuitous sex scenes, and while this movie has sex scenes, they are tastefully done and move the story along...in other words, they are not randomly tossed in like spare change. Additionally, the copy which is available on Amazon has a Chinese cover, but the movie is in English. Enjoy!

B0051QIGP4|5.0|This album, in my opinion, is Lady Gaga's best and most consistently-listenable album to date. I've heard someone say that this album may be her \\"Thriller\\", and that person may be on to something.  If Michael Jackson's \\"Off the Wall\\" preceded that classic album, then Lady Gaga's \\"The Fame\\" may very well precede a classic in its own right as well - \\"Born This Way\\".         What I love most about this collection of songs is that apparently, they all encompass everything that Ms. Germanotta loves about music over the last 20 - 30 years, and I doubt that she even cares what people think about how everything ended up. The album covers a wide array of sounds, and includes elements of rock, electro, and the usual Gaga-fied dance-pop.  \\"Born this Way\\", \\"Judas\\", \\"Government Hooker\\", and \\"Sheiße\\" are the dance tracks, not to mention a very campy and theatrical number thrown in -- \\"Americano\\".  What interested me the most are the throwback tunes.  For example the opening track, \\"Marry the Night\\"; it sounds like something Donna Summer would've recorded in 1980 because it has the classic melody and hook that was so personified in late 70's or early 80's disco.  \\"The Edge of Glory\\", \\"Hair\\", and \\"Highway Unicorn (Road to Love)\\" are the kind of rock anthems that are a breath of fresh air in the year 2011, with the former two songs destined to be hit singles.  Anyway, if you are a connoisseur of good pop music with a promiscuous ear, then I would strongly recommend this album.
B0051T47NQ|4.0|I wasn't sure what to expect when I set down to watch this film.<br /><br />'Found lost tapes' style movies are hit or miss with me, and this definitely qualifies as a lost tapes movie. The camera work is wobbly as expected but not so much as to make you queasy (Blair Witch and Cloverfield...). The premise is fun: a student film crew investigating bear poaching instead find a man with an unusual profession. While the characters don't really develop and there is not a speedy-fast plot, I still enjoyed myself a great deal more than I expected I would. The CGI effects are very nicely integrated and definitely give the movie a feeling of quality production value.<br /><br />I wouldn't call this movie horror but it is definitely fun. As an added bonus you get to see parts of the world you normally would not. I guess I have to wait until the August dvd release to see it again.

0307595862|3.0|It took me about 150 pages of torture to get into this book; many times I almost put it aside and gave up because it was so slow moving. But then....all hell broke loose and my head was spinning, trying to keep up with all that was going on with all the twists and turns in this novel. I think so much is lost in translating novels from other languages and that may have been one of the problems with this book for me.<br /><br />Based on the last half of this book, I've got to give this a middle of the road rating; not a great book but not an awful book either.

1593974744|5.0|I just removed my earbuds moments ago, marking the end of Orson's comments that told how Ender came to be, etc.      Ender's Game was suggested to me two days ago, and I literally could not stop listening.  The story telling is fascinating on so many fronts.  The story is largely told through the thoughts of this child-genius who has the intelligence of an adult, maturity (gravitas?) of a pseudo-adult, yet still lacks the life experience to correctly process all the emotions and other input that his hyper-emotional life throws at him.  The story was written prior to the Information Age - before we really knew where these crazy computers were going to take us as a species - which (as an IT guy), is fascinating in the extreme.  I have little doubt that Al Gore (inventor of the internet ;-)) and Steve Jobs (inventor of the iPad) read this book at least once.      The two greatest parts about this book were subtle.  First, until Orson mentioned in his comments that he didn't waste a lot of words on description, I didn't realize he hadn't.  My mind was free to create the descriptions.  More effort was put into the lake and the odd tunnels at Command School than almost anything else.  Magic!  Second, there is no real \\"bad guy\\" in the story.  With few exceptions, every character is simply compelled by some motivation or other.  Peter, Bonzo, Major Anderson - even the buggers - we're simply reacting to life with what God had given them.  A whole collection of \\"Ender's Shadow\\" books could be written from the points of view of the multitude of characters.\\"     Finally, I am convinced that every author should provide insight to their creation process as Orson did.  Talk about gold.  As a sci-fi guy, a published author (who also carried the germ of his novel with him through his 2 years in the mission field), and bibliophile - I loved every second of it.  Next to \\"The Elements of Style\\", Orson's comments might be the most insightful work on writing that I have come across.    Bravo!  I'm off to enjoy \\"Speaker for the Dead.\\"     ~Mike Steffen

B003ZSJ212|1.0|If these Blu-rays feature the 2004 versions, I strongly recommend you do not buy them, because the 2004 versions were a rush job, resulting in messed up picture and audio, and changes that were made at the last minute.     If, by some miracle, these problems are corrected (including properly filming Hayden for the end of Return of the JEdi instead of just using bad stock footage of his head), then this set may be worth my time.     so wait and read the reviews before you buy this. if these Blu-rays are not improved from the 2004 releases, would you really want to lay down the money for a substandard product from a company that is capable of so much more?    otherwise, seek out the 2006 or 2008 releases that have the unaltered versions included.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I am quite suspicious of my son's recomendations for good reads, (he is  in his 20's, I am much older). So, I took it with a grain of salt when he said, \\"...trust me...\\". I quit reading it after chapter 1 (maybe it was chapter 2), I was already too unnerved. My son said, \\"no, read a little further...\\" I did, as fast as I possible could, downloaded the second and third book as fast as I possibly could, wow! What a story! I then ordered it for my other son, (through the mail) and can't wait for the movie! (I, who am into only serious and mature reading, silly me!) A must read for anyone who enjoys fabulous writing and imagination, and the unfolding of a great story!
B004SBQAN8|2.0|Wow, how original: A high school scenario with the following characters:    1)An attractive new kid who's misunderstood and harassed.    2)His new friend, the science geek.    3)The attractive female who becomes the love interest of the new kid.    4) The bullies who taunt and attack the new kid and his geeky friend. Oh, and get this - the     leader   of the bullies....his ex-girlfriend is the attractive female lead who's now going out with the sensitive and misunderstood new guy at school/main character. He's really angry about this.    And hey, there were all these cool and original scenes of the bullies harassing the new guy and his buddy at their lockers in the crowded hallways....wow, I've never seen that in a high school film!    Such an amazingly original set of characters.     Oh, and how many high schools have you seen where everyone looks like they're in their 20s and they're ALL amazingly good looking?    There were some interesting action scenes, a somewhat interesting sci-fi storyline, and - admittedly - some beautifully filmed scenes in this film. However, the worn out \\"high school film\\" formula made this a tiring watch. Too bad, it had some potential that was wasted on the cliches and predictable character development.

B001UV4XHY|2.0|It's obvious that this is only the first part of a two part story. It's entirely a buildup to the final chapter, which will, hopefully, be more exciting to watch. \\"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1\\" is 2 1/2 hours of a dark lit, hard to see road picture. Very little of the enchantment, humor and wondrous effects are present. For the time spent, not much happens. It consists of Harry, Ron & Hermione walking from one point to the next, looking for and destroying one Horcrux while camping out in a tent. It could all have been condensed into a movie less than 1/2 the time. Of course then the makers of it would have made less money than they did by stretching one movie's worth of story into two movies. After spending time at the edge of my seat being thrilled by the previous 6 movies which seemed almost too short, this one is shockingly dull and had me looking at my watch wondering if it would never end. I recommend you ask someone who's seen it to update you what happens in this one - it should take about one minute to describe the important facts, instead of wasting 2 1/2 hours you can't get back. Then wait for the last part to come out, and see that.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I normally wouldn't even think to pick up a book like this, but after reading the reviews and seeing recommendations by friends on Facebook, I decided to buy it.  I am so glad I did; I finished the book in 2 days, and bought Catching Fire immediately after.
1439156816|5.0|Years ago, I read Stephen King's \\"Danse Macabre,\\" and was surprised at how much I enjoyed such a long non-fiction book.  My tastes were decidedly more make-believe, so I didn't know beforehand what to expect, but I soon learned that King had a very friendly, humble tone, while also sarcastic, witty, and funny, when writing non-fiction.  To my delight, I found all of those qualities still intact upon reading \\"On Writing,\\" and if possible, they even seemed sharpened by the intervening years of experience.  This book was every bit as interesting as one of his novels, judging by the fact that I couldn't put it down.<br /><br />Readers should understand that this is not just a book on how to write, it is subtitled `A Memoir of the Craft.'  And, as that subtitle promises, many pages are dedicated to King's early development as a writer, helping us understand the variety of forces that molded his writing influences and habits, and by extension, those of every writer.  However, King also offers much advice on grammar throughout the book, showing samples of his and others' work before and after editing.  The most helpful points for me that I use as often as possible, not only in my own writing but as a high school English teacher, are the tips about adverbs.<br /><br />In the 'Toolbox' section, King writes, \\"The other piece of advice I want to give you...is this:  The adverb is not your friend.\\"  The point he proceeds to make, as he does in general elsewhere in the book, is that in strong writing, less is more.  If you've established the context of your situation, you shouldn't need excessive amounts of modifiers; be direct and clear, and if you're writing fiction, let your characters act and speak naturally instead of filling up your writing with clutter.  As he also says, overusing adverbs can reveal a sense of inadequacy in the writer, who tries to show how \\"smart\\" he is by peppering every sentence with flashy, empty descriptors.<br /><br />\\"On Writing\\" provides great information for writers, amusing and interesting anecdotes for general readers, and a thoughtful point of conversation for both King fans and linguists.  I recommend it for anyone who likes to be entertained, while having the opportunity to learn something at the same time.amusing and interesting anecdotes for general readers, and a thoughtful point of conversation for both King fans and linguists.

This book is directed toward young women, but I think all women and young girls would enjoy this book very much. I highly recommend it. The only issue I had was with the price of the book.

B001M4YZ90|5.0|Well-written crime films are a guilty pleasure.  It's not the cruelty and violence that attract me but the wit and temerity it takes to survive (and succeed) in such a harsh, dark world.  Along with the surprising humanity that appears to flourish among the baddies.    Of Guy Ritchie's British gangster films, this is my favorite so far.  Good cast, good story, tempered by humor (but not to the point of farce or silliness).  AND Gerard Butler.  ;-)    The single-disc version doesn't have any special, behind-the-scenes features, but I didn't miss them.  The film itself is enough.

B003L77G06|5.0|This show remains one of the big pleasures of sitcom television.  Wisely, its creators keep the focus on what worked on season one, that is the everyday hilarity of being family members to this extended nuclear family. Last year my favorite couple was Cam and Mitch, the gay guys.  This year I have to say that the daughter and Phil come into their own. Phil especially takes deadpan comedy to totally zany hilarity. He is especially funny whenever in the presence of his father-in-law Jay, who can turn him into jelly in less than five minutes. Jay's Colombian wife Gloria remains very funny as well along with her son Manny.  When Jay finally gives in on getting Manny a dog, it is a real high point. This show stays tightly focused on these characters inside the family, getting the comedy out of every interaction.  This is its genius: never straying off point or far afield from its premise of showing the comedy of modern family life.<br /><br />Visit my blog with link given on my profile page here or use this phonetically given URL (livingasseniors dot blogspot dot com).

B004H2ZFPW|5.0|Goodbye Lullaby, Avril Lavigne's fourth studio album (not including that \\"Essential Mixes\\" thing), is both like and unlike any of her previous albums. It is an odd mixture of upbeat, poppier songs and sad, mellow ballads. For the most part, however, I'd consider this album to be a downer. If you like downers as much as I do, then this may be just the album for you. The reason for the delays and strange injections of pop (which don't feel like they fit) is a story by itself. You may look it up if you wish, but I'll just say that she and her label had \\"creative differences\\" when it came to what they felt the album should be. Anyway, I'll get on with the review proper.    Unlike her previous albums, half of the songs on this one were written solely by Avril Lavigne (not including bonus tracks), and she even produced two of them. It even includes \\"Darlin,\\" a song she wrote as a teenager, but was never able to get on an album until now. In general, the first half of the album is collaborative, and more mainstream. The second half is deeper and a closer look into Avril's world. Even the songs written with her long-time friend Evan Taubenfeld just feel more genuine than those written with the aid of Swedish producer/writer Max Martin.    Some standout tracks include \\"Black Star,\\" which is surprisingly good for a jingle, and the explosively happy \\"Smile.\\" \\"What The Hell,\\" the most mainstream song, is fun and light, and pretty good for being a bit on the bratty side. The album ends with the reminiscent and sad \\"Remember When,\\" and the bittersweet \\"Goodbye,\\" which are really where the albums ends (even Avril thinks so). Everything that comes after that is pretty much bonus material.    Also, if you buy the deluxe edition (as I did), you will also get three \\"acoustic\\" versions of three songs and her cover of Joan Jett's \\"Bad Reputation.\\" The \\"acoustic\\" versions of \\"What The Hell,\\" \\"Push,\\" and \\"Wish You Were Here\\" all lack drums and have a more stripped-down feel to them, and Iactually prefer them to the regular albums versions.    This is just me, but this album fits my taste almost perfectly. The lyrics aren't very complicated, but that sort of writing is to be expected from this artist, and it's one of the qualities I like. Though this album may not be as popular as her previous three, it is definitely worth a listen. Perhaps go online and listen to some of the songs to get an idea. If you like it, buy the album. If you don't like it, then walk away. Simple. Just don't make a judgement until you've had a sample. What do you have to lose other than a little time?

B002UXRGM0|5.0|Narrated by David Attenborough, this is another great BBC production that rivals Planet Earth and The Blue Planet. Four years and 3,000 days of filming makes for an awesome product.    This transfer provides excellent video and audio quality. My only complaint, which many likely won't notice, is that a single episode, Plants, is in 1080i.  All other episodes are in 1080p as expected.

B004K4IZ54|1.0|sometimes the disc would load, most of the time it would not, it jamed the machine and I had to unplug the player to get it to re set, other 3D titles played fine so there was something wrong with this disc.    On one attempt it did load but there was no 3D effects, we went through the entire movie, the tv stayed in 3D mode and activated the 3D glasses but there was no 3D effect...... something clearly wrong so I sent it back, Amazon is a great company and as such they were great taking the defective title back, I did not re-order another of the same movie.    I also had purchased the 3D TV and dvd player from Amazon at a great price as always.

B004FEL6GO|5.0|Bumblebee is awesome!I know some people are gonna judge this version of Bumblebee more sceptical because of looks,but the DOTM version is a great all around transformer.If you skip on this version because you judge it on looks then you are gonna miss out on a sweet transformer that is perfect for all ages.Bumblebee has great detail in camaro mode with the racing stripes and spoiler addition.In robot mode Bee has great articulation in the legs,arms,body,and head piece.This version also features some cool new weaponary with the Mech Tech arsenal.Bumblebee includes a Blaster that converts to a Plasma Cannon which attaches to the arm in robot mode and to the roof in camaro mode.The poseability is outstanding with great stability for creating cool battle scenes or poses for when you want to display the autobot hero.The durability is excellent as well with secure joints and a solid build in either camaro or robot mode.The transformation level is intermediate meaning if you have plenty of experience with transformers there is a mid-level difficulty.If you are a parent buying for a child of 5-6 or younger you might have to help some in the process.Honestly Bumblebee is very versatile for all ages with a managable transformation.To start the process lift up the top part of the entire vehicle.The rear piece with the spoiler rotates forward as the rest of the piece rotates straight up.The hood piece will then fold inwards as the headlight pieces pull out then rotate up.The front wheels rotate out while the doors do the same.The arms flip out then rotate around as the piece below the front fender flips up.The front section of the camaro then rotates down to reveal the head piece and connect the upper and lower torso.The rear front wheelrim pieces rotate up as the legs rotate down.The arms rotate once more with the hands flipping out as the wheelrim pieces rest on the leg.The rear section of the camaro then seperates as the top section of the vehicle folds in to rest on Bumblebee's back.The feet then rotate out for the final step.Bumblebee is now ready for battle!Bumblebee DOTM is a high quality,well-made,10 out of 10 transformer all fans will enjoy.I highly recommend Bumblebee to all transformer fans and collectors out there.Bumblebee Rocks and Transformers Rule!!!e's back.The feet then rotate out for the final step.Bumblebee is now ready for battle!Bumblebee DOTM is a high quality,well-made,10 out of 10 transformer all fans will enjoy.I highly recommend Bumblebee to all transformer fans and collectors out there.Bumblebee Rocks and Transformers Rule!!!
B00006JLX4|5.0|I hate when people think Pavement is overrated. This is impossible as I know few people who have heard of them, let alone *actually* listened to their music (only listening to Summer Babe and Cut Your Hair doesn't count-- go listen to everything from You're Killing Me thru Carrot Rope and come talk to us). No one I know currently discusses them. Pavement definitely isn't an easily accessible band. People think they sound 'weird' and immediately make it a negative review. We get it, if Pavement isn't your thing. But it doesn't mean people who like them don't know what they are talking about. It's just not your thing. We get that, that's fine. Now please stop saying it over and over and over again. Learn to say you don't like a band without making it into a crusade to make sure everyone knows your opinion. (Besides, we all know you like Pavement secretly, and you just don't want to admit it. Why else would they bug you so much? =) Give them a chance. If you don't like them fine. Just stop trying to out-indie people by not liking something other people like. I love Pavement but I hate the indie-connection that has to come with them.    This is an amazing album.

B003HGKJ3M|4.0|I'd been waiting for this album to be remastered...it was exciting to see a deluxe set with two discs of material.  I looked over the track listing and noticed something was amiss, but I ordered it, hoping it would be good anyway.  I would have bought this even if it had been a single disc collection, just to hear the better sound quality.  The old disc is kind of flat.<br /><br />I love this remaster.  The original 10 track album is crisp and clear with a fuller sound.  Songs like Train of Thought have sounds in them that I couldn't hear before.  It almost feels like listening to the song for the first time.  Even the song everyone knows and has heard a million times, Take On Me, sounds fresh.  Included are remixes, b-sides, previously unreleased songs, and demos.  They used a good extended mix of The Sun Always Shines.  I never heard the 12\\" of HHAL.  It's better than the album version.  The demo is quite different from the album version and is interesting to hear.  Some people are not into demos.  I think it's interesting to hear a little of how a song goes through changes during the recording process.  But most of the demos aren't any I'd want to listen to over and over.  The b-sides are the best part.  I like \\"Stop! and Make Your Mind Up\\".  It's a bouncy little song.  \\"Dot the i\\" and \\"Nothing to It\\" are other good ones, and \\"Driftwood\\" sounds very early 80s, the beginning is even similar to Michael Jackson's \\"Off the Wall\\" in a way.<br /><br />The booklet looks good, though I wish it had contained a full page color photo of the band.  There are many great photos from the time period that could've been used.  Lyrics are included.  A nicely put together package.<br /><br />The only fault of this release is what I noticed when skimming the track listing, and it's been mentioned already but it bears repeating.  The extended version of Take on Me was *not* included.  It should've been.  One of the biggest songs of the 1980s that had a great extended version.  I love the opening...it's pop heaven.  It belongs on a deluxe set.  The liner notes have stated, \\"this deluxe edition of HHAL is the last word on a-ha's landmark breakthrough\\".  How can that be when an important track was omitted?  It is incomplete.  One song missing isn't a big deal, but it's an important song.  I'd understand if there hadn't been room to include it.  But disc one runs just under 61 minutes, leaving plenty of space for the 5 minute track, with room to spare.  Yet it was left off.  Someone dropped the ball with that one.  Or maybe it has to do with licensing problems.  I can't think of any other reason why it would be left off.<br /><br />This is definitely worth buying if you love the album.  But I do feel disappointed, I was really hoping that 12\\" would be included.  People shouldn't have to locate that track separately--it should have been here as a complete package of a classic album.  Still, I really enjoy listening to the CDs, and I think it's worth 4 1/2 stars.<br /><br />At least there is plenty of material to help make up for that omission.  If you love the album or 80s synth pop, get it.pop heaven.  It belongs on a deluxe set.

0446401307|1.0|Connelly is truly an overrated author who writes the kind of book that people buy at the airport to kill 5-15 hours of tedious flying time. He was a crime reporter before he became an author and his idol is Raymond Chandler. He may have the technical details down as far as police procedural goes and thankfully he doesn't all hardboiled-lady killer-Phil Marlowe on the reader, but his books ring hollow and Harry Bosch sadly never truly comes to life on the page.    I've listened to some of the audio book versions - the talented actors make Connelly's novels far more interesting than they really are. READING Connelly however is no fun - I'm only a few chapters into \\"The Overlook\\" and I'm often half chuckling, half gritting my teeth because of the bad writing. I don't think I'll finish it.
B004EPZ06G|5.0|A good sequel better than the first. The first movie while funny seemed to stop short of pushing the envelope of what could be shown on the screen.  There are no such problems with the sequel.    Todd Phillips reuses the same recipe of hi-jinks and hilarity but pushes it to the next level in The Hangover Part II. This time the laughs and scenarios are a lot more raunchier and bizarre than the first movie.     It's true that setup and certain parts are copied of the original, but to call this a carbon copy of the first would be a misstatement.     The location is different, newer characters are introduced, the characters seem more in tune with themselves than the first movie when they were going through the motions of what was going on. Here they don't seem as shocked by the circumstances surrounding their wild night of debauchery (for example Alan's bald head doesn't seem to phase him, Phil chucking at Stu's Mike Tyson tattoo, and Mr. Chow's sudden friendship with the Wolfpac namely Alan). If anything there seems to be a certain admiring among the guys over what they have done (except for Stu).    They did try to provide a bit more of a back story as well. In the first movie, Stu was a miserable wreck with his relationship, gets married in Vegas (though he has on recollection of what happened) and eventually separates from that girl as well. Here they tried to introduce Stu as happier man when he's about to get married to his Asian bride despite the fact that her father disapproves of their whole union.    The interactions even with some of the objects and animals for example carry in a bit more time and usage. Like the Tiger in the first movie was merely just there as a small side note to the Wolfpac's inebriated rampage over Vegas. In this sequel, the hilarious drug dealing monkey in Bangkok serves a bit more purpose and actually practically steals the movie during a couple of over the top scenes.     Regardless then of whether of you dispute if this is more or the same, the end point of this discussion should be whether this is a great comedy or not. The simple answer to that is DUH yes!!!!!    It has all the elements of a good comedy, it's a good buddy movie, and it never manages to be boring. It delivers the laughs and then some.
0375507256|5.0|Since reading \\"Cloud Atlas\\" I have recommended it to friends and family-- the first book since the George R.R. Martin (Song of Ice & Fire) fantasy series which I have made the effort to recommend. This was the first Mitchell book I've read and since then I've also read \\"Black Swan Green\\" and \\"Thousand Autumns of....\\"-- both also fantastic. It's so wonderful to read quality fiction again, especially if, as I do, you like historical fiction.
B004TJ1H3C|5.0|So they cancelled Defying Gravity and now they cancel Stargate Universe.    This proves that the group at the SiFi channel really do have brains the size of a pea (or smaller) and an IQ measured using fractions. That's what it takes to view and understand the programing which replace the cancelled shows these days. Instead of being satisfied with making the money these shows produce, the pea brains running the SiFi channel demonstrate that they ARE NOT SiFi fans but fans of the dollar and thus they all should quit their SiFi jobs and go get a job at a bank or a casino which do deal in the product of which they ARE a fan.    And ... To the SiFi Board of Directors, Hire executives who really are true SiFi fans and care about the product after you fire this group. It seems to me the purpose of the SiFi channel is FIRST to create SiFi entertainment and SECOND to make 1000% weekly on your investment.
0131480057|5.0|The problem that I've had with most Linux/Unix Sys Administration books is the fact that they're either too easy (assume that you've never touched a command line and don't want to) or they teach the material in the most obfuscated/difficult to understand manner.  This book is great!  I've been a sys admin for around a year and a half and I've learned so much from this book.  Unlike other books, it details the history of certain concepts to enforce the concept rather than just to provide you with a history lesson.  Definitely pick this book up!

0307887960|3.0|I lost 40 pounds...and have kept it off for 15 years.  But not on this diet.  We'll come back to how I did it later.<br /><br />The Dukan Diet will definitely work for some people...just as any diet will.  It is not a bad diet so please read on as I list its pros and cons.<br /><br />Pro<br /><br />1.  You will definitely lose some weight on this diet, especially right away.  However it will mostly be water weight.  This is not all bad as many people need that extra boost of encouragement to get the fly wheel turning.<br /><br />2.  The diet is very well-laid out in steps to get you jump started.<br /><br />3.  I really liked the step down approach that Dr. Dukan takes.  He has the Attack Phase which is the most restricted.  You just eat protein and the oat bran products.  This phase lasts from 1 to 10 days.  And the oat bran pancakes were actually pretty good.  Get the oat bran at your health food store.<br /><br />4.  The next phase is the Cruise Diet.  It consists of protein and vegetables and lasts until you have lost all the weight you intend to.  You still have to go back on the Attack Phase all-protein diet for one day a week.<br /><br />5. Then there is the Consolidation Diet which consists of the first two but you are allowed to add one serving of fruit, two whole grain breads, a teense of cheese, and two starchy vegetables (per week).  You are also allowed to have two celebration meals per week.  You stay on this diet for five days for every pound you lose. This could be quite a long time for some people.<br /><br />6.  The Stabilization Diet is pretty much the same as the Consolidation Diet.  For life!<br /><br />7.  He also encourages drinking a lot of water which you will need to keep your kidneys flushed and to avoid constipation (I recommend Evian).  Lots of walking and maybe some minor exercise.  And some silly stuff like sucking on ice cubes and taking cold showers.<br /><br />8.  One of the sentences which grabbed my attention and should for ALL DIETERS is this, \\"...with each weight loss, your body makes you consume your fat reserves, so when you lose 20 pounds, it is almost as if you had eaten that amount of fat or butter.  Throughout any weight loss period, a large quantity of cholesterol and triglycerides circulates in your blood....People who try to lose weight without success once or twice a year are constantly exposing themselves to high levels of cholesterol.\\"  YIKES!  This is pretty scary.<br /><br />Now for the CONS<br /><br />1.  This is the most boring diet I have ever been on.  You will lose weight out of sheer boredom.<br /><br />2.  It is so restrictive that I doubt many people can stay on this for long and it will quickly go the way of many of the other fad diets.<br /><br />3.  Dr. Dukan repeats the erroneous information that once you have created a fat cell, it will never go away, only shrink.  This is simply not true.  And how depressing for any dieter if it were.<br /><br />4.  This diet just isn't healthy.  I felt sluggish and out of sorts.  I craved my fruits and vegetables and spicy foods.<br /><br />Now....for how I lost 40 pounds 15 years ago and have kept it off.<br /><br />Here is the big secret.  Eat less and exercise more!<br /><br />Yes, you can calculate your approximate caloric needs by multiplying your desired weight by 10 calories for weight loss, by 12-14 for maintainence.  It's just that simple. If you want to weigh 120 pounds, then multiply 120 x 10 = 1,200 calories.<br /><br />I eat three balanced meals a day, and ALWAYS eat a breakfast with protein.  Eat lots of fruits and vegetables.  I NEVER drink any kind of soda.  I exercise EVERY day at least 30 minutes, more for aerobics.  Yes, I do this before work and I get up at 5 a.m.  I keep a food journal, any cheap notebook will do, and record what I eat, when, calories, number of fruits and vegetables, AND junk food calories.  You'd be surprised how those add up (I'm addicted to salty-crunchy things).<br /><br />I highly recommend the latest edition of The Calorie King Calorie, Fat and Carbohydrate Counter which lists most foods, including restaurant foods, and is small enough to fit in your purse or briefcase.  You can get it here on Amazon for under $9.  And, no, I am not in any way affiliated with the authors.  It also has special sections for diabetics, issues dealing with sodium, fiber, alcohol, exercise, and diet.<br /><br />That's it, folks, if you want to try the Dukan Diet, be my guest but if you want to finally lose the weight and keep it off, you're going to have to do it the old fashioned way.  Eat less, exercise more.h to fit in your purse or briefcase.  You can get it here on Amazon for under $9.  And, no, I am not in any way affiliated with the authors.

B002ZBJ6SY|4.0|I have always liked listening to seether when they come on the music channels, so my girlfriend picked me up this album. I now have all their albums! This is a great band and the album doesn't leave you disappointed. I think the fact you can keep listening to the album over and over again shows that you don't get bored of the tracks. Take me away and Broken are two of my favourite songs ever. I will say the album does have one or two weak tracks that I now skip when listening too, but the pro's really out weight the con's. The majority of the album is amazing tracks. I don't think you would be disappointed if your downloaded it.
B003PIUBZS|5.0|This was an awsome series.  Thay have taken the legend of Spartacus and expanded it to dimensions yuou would not have dreamed. He wasn't just an ordinary slave but a warrior recruted by the Romans to be a soldier ans when his tactical mind was greater than his superiors, he joined a coup.  branded a traitor, the Romans sold him and his wife into slavery.  She was his only means of sanity.  The twist was that he was such a good warrior that his new owner thought to regain his good name on the wins of Spartacus in the arena.  If you have seen it you know that I mearly scratched the surface of this blood filled tale of Roman excess and those who haven't.......Well you don't know what you are missing.  If brutally descriptive violence, lust and betrayal are your cup of tea, then this is the show for you.
B004V9J21O|4.0|Well, Neal has done it again!  It amazes me that Neal can churn out epic after epic after all these years, tirelessly it seems.  Even though the winning formula is by now familiar, it is still breathtaking in it's scope and beauty.  The man never seems to run out of great melodies, and engaging prog bravado.      Testimony 2 continues the heartfelt outpouring of his spiritual journey and incredible story, getting rather personal, with songs about his daughters' miraculous healing and his anguish over being on the road, and his tough decision to leave Spock's Beard.  Testimony 2 is another Prog album, but it also contains some great poppish shorter songs, like Mercey Street and Supernatural.  The prog peices build to incredible power and majesty especially Part Eight culminating in the powerful \\"It's For You\\".  There seems to be more orchestration on this album, which gives it an added layer of beauty.    Neal's right hand man, Mike Portnoy is once again behind the drums, kicking things into high gear when needed and playing with power and subtlety on the more majestic passages.  At this point, a Neal album wouldn't be the same without him.  Randy George is rock solid as always too.  Steve Morse turns in a mind blowing guitar solo in the epic \\"Seeds Of Gold\\", but there are plenty of other great guitar solos throughout Testinmony 2, that I'm assuming Neal plays himself, as the only other credit belongs to Paul Bielatowitz for Overture 4 and It's For You.  Neal is burning down the house.       Neal has not produced a weak album so far as I can tell.  I'm amazed another reviewer would think \\"Lifeline\\" is weak.  I loved the format of that album; a single disc with mostly shorter songs, one 13 minute song and a 28 minute epic, every bit of music on it classic Neal.  The variety of formats is what makes Neals music so great, weather he's making a concept album about Martin Luther, going on another amazing journey with his friends in TransAtlantic, or making an album of classic rock covers.  He will probably make a great Christian pop album at some point.  Whatever he decides to do, he will pour his heart and passion into every note, and we, his faithful fans will continue to follow along with him in his incredible musical journey.

My niece and nephew both shed tears before the end of the movie. The adventure, excitment and overall magic level seemed to go up an extra notch in this film. I can't wait for the next one to come out. A must watch for Harry Potter fans and movie fans!
B004IQMXD4|4.0|This is a really good album. Everything that Stevie touch turns to magic. One of the most talented songwriters in music history. This album needs more than on listening, some of the tracks are growers such as \\" for what it's worth\\" which is by now my favourite track on the record. Been a fan of miss nicks for most of my life and can't wait to check out her performance at Hyde park, london this summer. Welcome back queen of rock!
B0016BPWNM|5.0|Wonderful yarn with good colorful characters, cool songs and quite a good all round flick to entertain ages from tiny tots to grandmas.

B004L3AR0K|3.0|Love & Other Drugs started out as something like a romantic comedy.  That was fine with me.  Then, with Gyllenhaal and Hathaway becoming \\"sex buddies\\", the movie almost became a soft-core porn with all of the frontal nudity for Hathaway and rear nudity for Gyllenhaal.  Then with another twist, the movie ended as a drama.  I actually liked the dram spin at the end, and would have preferred that the whole movie start in this way.  I would have also liked to seen it be more, like it started, as a comedy.  But mixing them up like this was just a bit too confusing.<br /><br />Both of the main actors are excellent and believable in their characters.  It just seems that the director changed course somewhere in the middle of filming.
B004Z2TUGE|4.0|The concept was entertaining, yet done before. A group of elite aliens have to take refuge on earth and blend in in order to escape the evil ravaging bad aliens. Come on, hasn't anyone seen Starkid? Totally the same storyline.<br />In all honesty though, I liked it. The plot moved decently well, the acting was pretty good, and the special effects were pretty sweet. I look forward to a terribly corny, overdone sequel. I think the acting by Timothy Olyphant saved this movie from being a total flop. All in all, worth renting for a good date night flick, but not worth the money to own.
B001DPHDCY|4.0|Since I am basically a child at heart, and loved this when my children were small, this was an especially wonderful gift from my (now adult) daughter, and now I can share it with my grandchildren!  \\"Horton Hears a Who\\" teaches tolerance and acceptance, which I find to be sadly lacking in our world today.  If more people really listened, we might all be amazed at what we can hear and learn!
B004KPLVW2|5.0|Loved this movie when I saw it.  Nostalgia being what it is, I still like the movie.  The Blu-ray version is sharp...the movie looks better than it ever did.  Sure, the movie itself is dated but still fun to watch.
B000Q66JXA|5.0|Late in the film, King Arthur is about to fight his last battle against his estranged son Mordred. His kingdom of Camelot is falling; the knights of the Round Table are disbanding; and Guinevere has entered a convent. In short, Arthur's world is collapsing. He rides to the nunnery to see Guinevere for the last time. And there, she produces the ancient timeless object hidden beneath some linen: the sword Excalibur, still gleaming, still magical, still potent to fight in the battle that Arthur cannot win. He sheathes Excalibur, and, in full knightly regalia rides with his remaining loyal knights through the English countryside, their pennants and banners flying in the wind. The fortissimo chorus of Carmina Burana accompanies their ride in perfect harmony, chanting the lyrics from the medieval poem \\"O Fortuna\\". This is the stuff of legend...<br /><br />Artistic treatments of the Arthurian legends date back to illuminated codices from the Middle Ages. Thereafter the first, and one of the greatest, attempts to bring the stories into a novelistic form was written in the late 1400's by a knight, Sir Thomas Malory, entitled Le Morte d'Arthur (\\"The Death of Arthur\\") which is probably the most famous work of English letters proceeding Chaucer but before Shakespeare. Even later renditions include T.H. White's \\"The Once and Future King\\". By the 20th century, theatrical adaptations began appearing as well, including \\"Knights of the Round Table\\" (1953), Disney's \\"The Sword in the Stone\\" (1963), and the musical \\"Camelot\\" by Lerner and Lowe which was possibly the most popular rendition of the story before \\"Excalibur\\". These last renditions, although they have their appeal, cannot measure up to the movie \\"Excalibur\\" which was largely based upon Malory's original tome.<br /><br />Many here have detailed very well the merits of the film, and since most people know the story, I will keep this short. The reason why this is the best of the Arthurian-based films is its imagery and its dedication to the original Arthurian myths. The entire look of the film, which I have not seen in a movie since, reeks of Medieval Legend. The lush forests, the huge castles, and the glittering swords give a visual and dream-like reality. This is NOT how it was in the Middle Ages. This is how people in the Middle Ages would have liked it to have been, which is the entire point of the Arthurian myths. The filmmakers of Excalibur understood that myth is about dreams.<br /><br />Several moments in the film are inspired directly from Malory and earlier Medieval codices. For example, several Medieval illuminated manuscripts feature the hand of the Lady of the Lake bestowing the sword Excalibur to Arthur. Strangely this episode, which becomes an important theme throughout Excalibur, is lacking from other theatrical versions and yet it is central to the original myth. Another is the strange rhetoric that Arthur and the land are one, and when Arthur becomes ill, the land of his kingdom becomes barren. This concept was a widely held belief in the Middle Ages: that the sovereign was essentially married to the kingdom.<br /><br />Another aspect that makes this film outstanding is the portrayal of Merlin by Nicol Williamson. This was possibly the best Merlin ever to come to the large screen. Some of the most humorous moments of the film occur with Merlin. Instead of being the absent-minded wizard of \\"The Sword in the Stone\\", he is the last of the Druids, a race giving way to Medieval Christians. Worth the price of admission. It is sad that he obtained very little recognition for this portrayal.<br /><br />The fact is, a viewer either experiences \\"aesthetic arrest\\" with Excalibur, or he or she doesn't. If the scenes when the knights go riding through countryside with their pennants flying behind them doesn't give you the shivers, this is not and will never be your kind of movie. If Malory had lived to see this film, he would have been awed and proud. Malory gave Arthur to the world, and Excalibur gave Arthur back to Malory., and Excalibur gave Arthur back to Malory.

0307474259|4.0|Gary Taubes' Why We Get Fat and What To Do About It is a treatise of nutritional and metabolic contrarian thoughts and ideas.  The book is well worth your time and effort. Taubes not only rethinks and debunks conventional wisdom about weight gain and obesity, but literally decimates dogma. Be prepared to throw by the wayside much of what you understand as nutritional and metabolic givens. I will place within quotation marks his iconoclastic beliefs.<br /><br />Taubes' premise is that \\"obesity--the most prevalent form of \\"malnutrition,\\" is not a caloric imbalance (more calories in than out), but a hormonal imbalance\\", with a strong genetic component.  If we happen to be born with a fat regulatory system that is efficient at turning calories into fat as opposed to burning them as fuel, and we stoke the genetic edict with a diet high in carbohydrates, then we are likely to get fat.  Carbohydrates--particularly refined carbs, starchy vegetables and sugar/high fructose corn syrup--promote insulin release and hence fat storage, largely driving this pathway.<br /><br />He posits that \\"it is not gluttony, sloth nor excessive caloric intake that are responsible for the majority of us being overweight or obese, but the way we process energy. \\" Based upon genetic decree, some of us have a propensity to store calories as fat and at the other extreme there are the energy consumers, those who easily burn calories. So, energy regulation is responsible for gluttony and sloth--\\"we are not fat because we overeat, but overeat because we get fat.\\" Those with a predilection for storing calories as fat have fewer calories left to run the body.  The more calories fat cells sequester, the more eating there must be in order to compensate--the body figures a way to get calories by increasing appetite or decreasing expenditure or both, promoting gluttony and sloth.<br /><br />Taubes' intriguing theory is that \\"moderate eating and maintaining a physically active lifestyle are the metabolic benefits of a body that is programmed to remain lean\\", not evidence of moral rectitude. If our fat tissue is regulated so that it will not store significant calories as fat or our muscle tissue is regulated to take up plenty of calories to use for fuel, then we'll either eat less, be more physically active, or both.<br /><br />A central theme of the book is that our body fat (fuel) is carefully regulated, and hormones play a key role in this regulation--think how women fatten differently then men.  Local factors also are relevant as some parts of our body are fat-free and others have a propensity for fat storage--think our hands vs. our abdomens. Fat tissue in obese individuals can be thought of in a similar way to malignant tumors, both of which have own gene-dictated agendas and grow regardless of food intake or exercise.<br /><br />Insulin resistance occurs in response to chronic carbohydrate overload--the more insulin secreted, the more likely that the cells and tissues will become resistant to that insulin (as cells already have enough fuel within).  As we age, our muscles get relatively insulin-resistant yet our fat cells always remain more sensitive than muscle. Insulin-resistant muscles partition more energy into fat, leaving less available for muscles and organs to use as fuel, so our cells adapt and use less energy.  In Taubes' mode of thinking, \\"we don't get fat because our metabolism slows, but our metabolism slows because we're getting fat.\\"<br /><br />Taubes opines that \\"energy consumption and energy expenditure are not independent but are dependent variables--cells burn less energy because they have less energy to burn.\\"  He believes that diets do not work because they result in us becoming hungry, cranky, depressed and lethargic and are therefore not sustainable.<br /><br />\\"Dietary fats do not elevate our trigylceride levels and make us fat, but carbohydrates do.\\"  In the world according to Taubes, the predisposition for obesity is beyond our control,but is set off by the carbs we consume. The higher glycemic index foods--carbs that break down rapidly during digestion and release glucose swiftly into our blood, also typically the cheapest foods--promote fat deposition more so than lower glycemic index foods.<br /><br />If we want to get leaner, we must lower our insulin levels and to do so requires carbohydrate restriction.  Even if we don't reduce our quantity of carb intake, we can improve the quality of our carb intake by eating healthier carbs--whole grains, fruits, vegetables, etc.<br /><br />Andrew Siegel, M.D.<br />AUTHOR OF: PROMISCUOUS EATING--UNDERSTANDING AND ENDING OUR SELF-DESTRUCTIVE RELATIONSHIP WITH FOODbut is set off by the carbs we consume.

B003V1WTMM|5.0|I have never read Kate Morton before this novel but quite frankly you dont need to. It reminds me of &#34;Rebecca&#34; by Daphne du Maurier one of my favorite novels.  The mystery of it keeps you guessing till the very end.
B00003CXAW|5.0|I have seen the VHS copy of this film before and, it was very high quality print so, I am pleased that the DVD manages to improve the clarity. This is one of the all-time classics and, it deserves the treatment it has been given with this Collector's Edition, which includes: the film restored to perfection, along with a special features disc of equal interest as the film itself. No, the movie disc does not have any bonus features, they are all on disc 2. Whether you have seen this movie, or not, this is well worth adding to your collection!!!

B0047Y0FGY|5.0|I really got a kick out of the humor which was hilarious at times and \\"laugh-out-loud\\" funny. But, after the breast feeding chapter near the end, it went down hill fast. It was as if the author was simply filling space to meet a deadline. If she could have resisted the temptation to put this book to market without a \\"happy finish\\", it would have been a perfect read.
B003YFIUW8|2.0|I was told that the first quarter of the book was very slow, but to hang with it as it would get better.  While I found the first part tedious, the middle was somewhat better, and the ending didn't happen fast enough.    What I enjoyed about the book was that it was told from the perspective of a five year old boy.  The story itself was incredibly depressing and disturbing.  His mother was kidnapped from her college campus 7 years prior and was held hostage in an 11'x11' \\"Room\\" where her kidnapper repeated raped her over the years.  The boy (Jack) was the result of the rapes.  Jack hid every evening in a wardrobe in the room before Old Nick (the kidnapper) would rape his mother, then Jack would sleep with her after Old Nick left.    The first quarter of the book, Jack describes in great detail their daily life in Room.  They had very little and when Old Nick gets mad at them and turns off the electricity they almost freeze and starve.  They plan and execute an escape plan.    The remainder of the book, is spent between a pschiatric hospital and Jack's grandmother's home.  Jack struggles with new life, and while he speaks well, he is developmentally challenged due to his lack of contact with anything or anybody (except his mother and what was in the room) for the first 5 years of his life.  The outside world is frightening and he has problems speaking.  He wants things fromt he Room, and these items give him comfort, but they are things that stir horrible memories for his mother.    Speaking of Jack's mother, she fights her own demons after the escape.  Again, you see this all through Jack's eyes, but one can only imagine what she must really be going through.  While she was very strong in the room, she falls apart for awhile on the outside (understandably).    The end is somewhat abrupt; however, it is a good ending.  The door is definitely left open for the sequel.    In summary, the book was well written and from an interesting perspective.  However, I can only rate it 2 stars because of the morose topic -- frankly a story that I'll remember even though I'd rather forget it.
B004M9AS3Y|5.0|I was taking a 10 day trip to france and needed a convenient way to take my Camera (Canon D60 with 18-200 EFS lens), an extra lens (8-16mm Sigma) plus stuff needed for day trips.  Also wanted to minimize number of bags for flight and needed a way to take my laptop.  The pack was perfect. For the flight all of the above along with my Toshiba 13\\" laptop, ipod, cellphone, earphones, charger, etc, plus a sweatshirt fit and the bag was my under the seat carry-on: perfect. I will add at this point that it is extremely comfortable to wear even when weighed down, but for the airport the outer sleeve that fits over the handle of a wheeled peice of carry on luggage makes it a dream to travel with.  Once in France, my usual contents would be the camera in the side compartment, extra lens in the pack plus a sweatshirt and stuff I needed for the day. It was incredibly comfortable to wear and walk with - and I did plenty of walking around Normandy and Paris, and the side pocket is really quick and easy access for the camera.  Just drop it off your right shoulder, the bag swings to your side, the zipper opens quickly, and the camera is right there to take out.  Great travel companion.  My only caution is that this is not for a photo safari if you're super serious and want to take multiple lenses plus flashes, and lots of other gear - it's for a day pack with one serious camera/lens combo and maybe one extra lens plus the other stuff you'll need for the day.  It's the perfect size for its intended purpose.
0316098329|4.0|When I started to read the book, I was initially turned off by the language.  Chair this, table that, etc. and felt it would not be a good read.  A friend encouraged me to read on and so I did.  I am glad I started over and continued.  I was pulled into the story and could not put it down.  While I trembled with the mother, I wondered how she could continue educating her son without the outside world.  She did an amazing job.  There are many others who are great in a crisis and then crash when their responsibility is over.  Well written and while disturbing at times, I recommend it.
B000QCS9NM|5.0|It's a bit twisted, like all of Chuck's work, but it's an intriguing read. I loved it. Not a family friendly book by any means.
B004Z2TUGE|4.0|I was thoroughly entertained by this movie.  It doesn't have great reviews besided to buck the system and try it anyway.  I found the plot to be easy to follow but with unexpected twists and turns.  I especially appreciated the introduction and later help received by the dog.  I highly recommend this movie.
1932100660|4.0|Excellent information and fantastic bibliography (1/4 of the book!). I really do NOT want to believe the content, but find myself compelled due to the overwhelming evidence. Some really good take-aways herein.<br /><br />I do have to knock the author pretty heavily for the transition from \\"oh you know, animal protein/fat is kind of bad\\" to \\"the government, big corps, and big pharma are out to get you\\". I really wish he had separated these two topics up a bit, but such is life. Good book, slight propaganda aftertaste - the facts are still the facts.
B003U0I9TQ|5.0|Perhaps THE only cd I've ever heard where I have loved every single track. EVERY SINGLE ONE. Normally, there are one or two tracks I actually enjoy on a CD. But not the case.

You can't help smiling and taping your foot along to the music. Just a wonderful, and addictive group.
0446691437|2.0|The author starts off really strong about the effect of resistance, along with some great insight on moving forward.  Then in the middle of the book he comes apart at the seams, rambling on about muses and angles, artists and the rest of the pathetic world of non-artists.  The end picks up with some good ideas.  I'm glad I read it.  Wouldn't give it as a gift.

B003Y5H54W|1.0|Red Riding Hood is an exercise in endurance because it is so laughably bad. And this review comes from a guy who tends to find redeeming quality in movies that get poor reviews. Almost everyone I knew- teen and adult alike- who saw the movie didn't like it very much. My wife and I still had our hopes up for this movie, realizing in the end it was probably a film geared toward young girls but entertaining, nonetheless.     However, there is very little to redeem Red Riding Hood. Other than some gorgeous shots of the landscapes and panoramic views of the village where the \\"story\\" takes place, this is truly terrible movie.     Looking to make this movie a blind buy on Bluray? Some words of caution: First off, \\"Red Riding Hood\\" is geared toward 13-14 year old girls... and not just any 13-14 girl, but very dumb 13-14 year old girls. Thankfully, most youngsters are too smart for this movie, which is why it was such a collasal box office flop. In other words, this movie insults the intelligence of your average 13 year old girl... adults need not even bother. There's nothing in the movie young (or older) males would like. This is a chick flick that couldn't find success with its target audience... or anyone else for that matter.    I'm being too harsh, you say? Allow me to explain, for those of you who are fortunate enough to have not not seen this movie and wondering whether it's worth a $20 blind buy on Bluray.     The most painful thing about watching this movie is the acting: modern day young actors portraying 19th century villagers... You never for one moment actually feel swept away to another time or another place. For example, there is a scene where the villagers are celebating, and Red Riding Hood and some others are actually dirty dancing!! In real life, no young girl back then would publically grind her pelvis like a pole dancer in a Puritan village! If so, imagine the community uproar! In other words, no sense of realism whatsoever.     At least they didn't attempt to talk in fake British accents- none of them could have pulled it off and it would have made the viewing experience all the more painful to endure.   Let's take a moment and zoom into the village where the bulk of the movie takes place. No time period is given, but made to feel like some time in the 1700's, perhaps early 1800's. However, the paper-thin characters all act as though they are transplanted from modern California. At least they didn't attempt to talk in fake British accents- none of them could have pulled it off and it would have made the viewing experience all the more painful to endure.    We have three main characters: Red Riding Hood, who is upset because she has to marry someone she doesn't want, a young attractive guy who is the noble \\"good boy.\\" She's in love with the village \\"bad boy.\\" Why? Because he's a hunk, of course! He also skulks around and acts angry at the world. Why is he angry at the word? Because he's a bad boy, or course! Duh! Oh, and he's a hunk... with lots of hair gel. That's the extent of the character development in this movie. He looks like a 21st century Elvis who squints like Clint Eastwood, wears too much hair gel, dresses in very fashionable black threads (particularly for a Puritan village) and seems about as much from the 1800's as George Jetson (albiet a young, hunky George Jetson). Oh, and he can't act.    Oh, and there's a big bad wolf who is killing people. The wolf can talk to Red Riding Hood- which was an interesting premise that was never developed upon. The story is too interested in the horrifically cliche'd \\"love triangle\\"... will Red Riding Hood get to have sex with the bad boy??? Will she have to give it up to the noble nice guy who is cute but too nice to consider sleeping with??? Does anyone older than 13 even care?    Then there's the big mystery... who is the big bad wolf? Many people are made the suspect, and sadly when all is revealed it ends laughably bad.      SPOILER AHEAD: DO NOT READ IF YOU DON'T WANT TO KNOW HOW IT ENDS    The ending is the most laughable part of this god-awful movie. After all the suspects are given to us, the real werewolf is Red Riding Hood's own father. To make a long story short, \\"Elvis\\" (and his perfectly gelled hair) comes to her rescue, and they butcher her father with no remorse. However, Elvis is accidentally bitten, which means he will now be a werewolf. They have sex, she's heart broken that he must leave the village so no one finds out. I mean, let's slaughter the hell out of dear old Dad for being a werewolf, then screw the hell out of hunky hair gel boy for being the same damn thing dad was slaughtered for in the first place. If only dear old dad was a hunky bad boy with lots of hair gel..  The two big messages of this \\"deeply profound\\" mess of a movie:      1) nice boys should get respect, but bad boys should get laid.       2) dads are easily expendable- kill the worthless SOB, bury him at sea, then get impregnated by the bad boy (it's the right the thing to do, you know).      END OF SPOILERS    I wish I had something positive to say about this movie. I don't often see movies that are this horrible, so I had to write about it. The writing, the directing, the acting, the music (god-aweful music)... it doesn't get any worse than this. The director should hang her head in shame for making such a dreadful film, or at least consider attending a few classes at film school. This whole current trend of sexy teenage vampires and werewolves can't end soon enough.

B000FC10MU|5.0|American Gods isn't the first book by Neil Gaiman I've read, but somehow I have trouble believing his fantastic writing will show up in every novel that he's written, so I dragged my feet coming to this one. (Note to self: Stop believing my filthy, lying instincts and trust my brain. It's reasonable.) The story follows a fellow named Shadow whose life has been turned upside down (and conveniently shaken free of any kind of attachments - except for the ones that follow him out of the grave), and who is given the opportunity to start over in the service of one Mr. Wednesday. Mr. Wednesday, as it turns out, is a god, and so are most of his cohorts.  In fact he's an old god - Odin - and he's rather preoccupied with the concern that the new-fangled gods we worship - Freeways, and the Media, and technology, and the like - are making him and his ilk irrelevant. The solution? A good, old fashioned theomachy.<br /><br />The Good: The story line is interesting enough, but the characters are stellar. (Hah! I saved you from the miserable pun, \\"The characters are divine.\\" Now you can consider yourself un-saved.) All of the gods Gaiman writes are beyond interesting - they're personable and just enough larger than life to be somehow believable and impossible at the same time. It's like his book is full of Sammy Davis, Jr.'s and Mr. Rogers and Elvises and all of the people who seemed to have just a little more personality than the fates normally allot. The book also doubles as a love story to America, so if you can't afford a road trip vacation this year, American Gods might be second best.<br /><br />The Bad: I'm sure it's intentional, but there's some fairly serious oversight in the list of gods. For all of the Eostres and Lokis and Horuses, where's Jesus? Where's the Buddha? Jesus gets a mention like he's a good old boy who stays out of trouble and out of the way, but if gods have power relative to the amount of worship they receive, as the book establishes, no matter how many lukewarm Christians sit in their churches on Sunday, Jesus/Jeezus/Jebus has to the kingpin god in America, but he gets no consideration. As far as I'm concerned, this is like the blindspot on your retina. Even if you know it's there, most of the time it's ignored and you can move on with your life, but when that blind spot pops out at you, it's hard to focus on anything else.<br /><br />The Takeaway: I'm sure there's a bad Neil Gaiman book out there, but I haven't read it yet. This one is recommended to anyone without hesitation, especially if you intend to use it for reading.ns sit in their churches on Sunday, Jesus/Jeezus/Jebus has to the kingpin god in America, but he gets no consideration.

0321701763|5.0|I just want to say that as far as technical teaching books go.  The Adobe Photoshop CS5 Classroom in a Book is an excellent course.  I have taken this class in a local community college before and this book was actually organized much better.  It also comes with a cd full of examples and exercises.  If you want to learn Photoshop CS5 or for that matter any Adobe program check out Adobes other Classroom in a book series.. You will not be disappointed.  See Amazons' link below.

B000QCS8TW|5.0|GRRM in the first book of A Song of Ice and Fire has not only narrated a vivid story with characters who the reader comes to know and love (or loathe), but he has created an entire world with not a speck of detail left unattended.  Characters are complex and have individual personality, intellect (some being impressively clever), and weakness. The story is told through the perspectives of the characters, changing with each chapter. Different races of humans are present, each with their own cultures and customs, as well as fantastic beasts and creatures. I absolutely recommend this book to anyone looking for a good read (fantasy fan or not). On to book two!
B002NANLCE|4.0|I'd never heard of Robert J. Sawyer before last year's Dragon*Con, when I slunk in late to the nearest open session, which happened to be dedicated to him. Frankly, I was wary of people named \\"Sawyer\\" then, though I've rectified that situation since. It turns out he was a sci-fi author who had written (among quite a large number of other books) a story called Flashforward, which had been picked up and turned into a TV series that I vaguely remember my wife watching.<br /><br />It turned out this guy was Canadian, very bright (obviously), funny but acerbic, an obvious nerd but kind of charming, and did a pretty good job of entertaining a room full of people for 90 minutes. He also turned up on a bunch of other sessions I attended that weekend, said a lot of really clever things, and said one thing that really just completely galled me and left me turning it over again and again in my head in the months after. So, I finally decided to track this guy's book down and give it a hard read.<br /><br />First, the Bad: As soon as I started reading, I snickered. Hee hee hee. This guy is a hack. Clearly, then, it was fluke that he's a successful writer, and what he said that thrust in my side like Longinus' spear was a meaningless wisp of Canadian nerd bitterness. He writes like Dan Brown, but worse. I actually kind of like Dan Brown. Sawyer's characters are templates with attributes - they all feel like the same person with a different feature or experience to mull over. Even his main character - Lloyd Simcoe the Canadian Uberscientist - who alone gets a skoshe of individual development - is developed in a detached, uninteresting kind of way. He starts chapters with paragraphs describing rooms and people that never really matter, packing in detail that borders on obsessive, like he's rendering a 3D environment in case the readers go off the rails and try to peek around corners they weren't meant to. He describes and describes and it just feels like a catalog of details. Perhaps worse, there are quite a few passages (particularly discussions of guns, smoking, and the way women flock to some characters (Canadian scientist guy, I'm looking at you)) that felt more like wish fulfillment than story-telling - like he was trying to build a world in which things happened the way they \\"should\\" (for a value of should that matches his desires and not the way the world happens to actually work).<br /><br />The Good: But after a couple of chapters of my self-congratuatory smuggary, the story grew on me. The idea could be really striking - the whole world loses consciousness for about 2 minutes (meaning that there were millions killed who were driving, standing on ladders, driving planes, performing trapeze acts, etc.) and saw 20 years into the future - if the author developed it enough to really explore how how an event like that would affect daily life for a variety of people.  Sawyer does that excellently. For all of his cardboard people, he is remarkable in their breadth and variety. They may not be believable as narrators, but as acquaintances and friends - people whose thoughts and emotions we only see from the outside - they are uncannily realistic. He explores both sides of debates surrounding the Flashforwards - particularly whether or not the future is fixed or mutable - with a vigor that you'd expect from an actual argument by people who hold opposing view passionately. In this regard - in his ability to think well past the reader not just on one philosophical vector but several simultaneously - he rightfully deserves the title of modern sci-fi master. He may not have a soft hand with language or literary techniques, but he can take a foreign, impossible idea and develop it so completely in the reader's mind that when the story is done and it's time to put down the book, the reader is left a little stunned that it was all just imagination and none of it actually happened.<br /><br />The Takeaway: Even before I finished the book I started watching Flashforward (the TV show) on Netflix, and it's pretty good, but entirely different characters. The central idea is close enough to develop the sundry themes Sawyer did (I believe he said he had a hand in that aspect of the show), but instead of a bunch of nuclear physicists as central characters, the TV show focuses on the American Prime Time trinity of Cops, Lawyers, and Doctors. It's worth a watch if you haven't seen it, at least through the half-dozen episodes I've watched so far. The book, though... Do you like sci-fi already? When you read Dan Brown, do you get hung up on the fact that he's no Tolstoy, or is your disbelief hoisted by its suspenders when you process the scope of the story for the first time? I can't recommend it promiscuously, but if you've gotten this far into this review and still think the book would be a good read, you're right.<br /><br />One last thing: On the immensely minute chance that Robert Sawyer finds his way into reading this review - the TV show we can agree to call science fiction, but this book should be classified as fantasy. We have to hold the science in our science fiction to a certain standard of plausibility, don't we now?

B004XJRQUQ|5.0|The Hunger Games Trilogy is science fiction in the same sense that 1984 or Fahrenheit 451 are science fiction - they're set in a dystopian future (in this case, a post-apocalyptic future) where a criminal centralized government has lost sight of humanity and treats people like resources - or worse, like slaves. \\"Speculative fiction\\" might be a better term for these types of books, or maybe \\"social fiction\\", to contrast with science fiction's typical focus on advanced technology. You won't find any rocket ships or laser guns here, though hovercrafts and force fields and guided genetic mutation do make a showing.<br /><br />The books follow the coming of age of Katniss Everdeen, a teenage girl who doesn't fit into the society she's born into - and how could she? Everyone in her district is a slave, forced to work the coal mines for a pittance, always on the verge of starvation, threatened with whippings or death for so little as catching a turkey when it flies over the electrified fence into their enclosure. When her sister is among the tributes chosen by lottery to participate in the \\"Hunger Games\\" - deadly gladiatorial games meant to show the districts just how subjugated they are - Katniss volunteers in her place and is thrust into a love story and political rebellion she never wanted.<br /><br />The Good - The story is advertised as YA, but that doesn't mean it's suitable only for young adults. The characters are deep, the story compelling and while not exactly unprecedented, there are enough twists and intrigue and good, old-fashioned drama to keep a mature reader hooked. The love story is strong and doesn't feel forced; like any classic the heroine is bounced between the affections of two men (alright, YOUNG men), neither of whom is perfect, but neither of whom is an outright villain, either. Though this amoric ping-pong match continues through all three books, at no point does it feel drawn out simply for the sake of the story - it all feels natural. There is enough action to balance out the emotion, and plenty of introspection and political intrigue to keep the story from being pigeon-holed.<br /><br />The Bad - I've read a few reviews that complained that the story is written in first-person present, but that's only very occasionally a bother. A couple of times I was put off by info-dump-style summaries, where it felt like the author needed to tidy up a point or two and couldn't fit it in dramatically, but these felt in character with the narrator. Each of the books seemed to wrap up a little abruptly (even if book 2, Catching Fire, does have an Empire Strikes Back-style ending), as if the author had approached a word count limit, but by that time the emotional investment I'd formed made me eager to forgive such small transgressions. Some people may be put off by a bit of the violence. Occasionally the descriptions become gory.<br /><br />The Takeaway - These are the kind of books that are likely to turn over in your head for several days after you finish them, which is generally a good sign. I don't think they'll be life-changing or insightful for anyone who has already read any of the other dystopian books mentioned above, but the character arcs make them worth the read anyway.balance out the emotion, and plenty of introspection and political intrigue to keep the story from being pigeon-holed.

0143118706|5.0|I enjoyed most of this book especially those parts in which Gilbert presents historical information and sociological insight into the institution of marriage. Gilbert is a very good writer and storyteller and the story of her own marriage story is for the most part interesting. Her summaries of researches taught me much about marriage.<br />She blends in a lot of personal and family information and does this usually in a readable way.<br />Her description of her relationship with Felipe the man she is to marry sounds honest and genuine.<br />Gilbert is a very smart woman and she knows also how to entertain.<br />I appreciated her quoting opinions on marriage and on her own decision not to have children which were critical of herself. Her open- mindedness and readiness to seek the truth wherever it can be found is refreshing.<br />Among the best parts of the book for me were her description of the way Marriage has changed historically, and how it has in the West become a matter of personal choice and satisfaction rather than communal benefit. She writes about the way stable marriages are made, and how Divorce comes often from friendship that turns to Intimacy which replaces  the Intimacy there was between the spouses. She writes about research which shows that Marriage is in terms of longevity, health, happiness more beneficial to Men than to Women. She writes about the Auntie factor in which ten percent of women as minimum in all societies do not have children, and how they often have other useful social functions. It seems to she is nonetheless most tenuous when she writes about her own decision to not have children. She does not directly connect this with the sacrifices she perceived her own mother and grandmother made in their working lives to do this.<br />The book has a respectful, modest good- spirited  tone and is strong in wit.<br />A very good book.

B004IQMXD4|4.0|I say fun because the songs are catchy and it's a great album to listen to in the car on a road trip.     I say serious because there are some songs on the album that speak of reality. New Orleans is about the strength of that city after the Katrina devastation. Probably Stevie's most serious and captivating song EVER is Soldier's Angel, which is about her time spent with the patients at Walter Reed Army Medical Center. This song will haunt you because of its power.    I say strong because there really isn't a weak song on this album, although Cheaper Than Free doesn't really fit in. It's a cute little ditty, but it belongs elsewhere, not on this particular album. Otherwise, it's almost a flawless record from Miss Nicks.    She brings romance, sexiness, wisdom, heartbreak and hope on this album with her lyrics. It is definitely her strongest set of songs for an album in her long career. There are also a few different influences on the album such as rock, country and pop, which makes for a great mix.

B000FC2L1E|5.0|Voyager, the third book of the Outlander series, begins in Scotland where Claire Randall, who is now a doctor and a widow, has taken her daughter Brianna for a vacation.  I really enjoyed the first part of the novel where Claire, Bri and their friend Roger do research Jamie Fraser and the battle of Culloden.  The story went back and forth between their research in 1968 and the actual events in the 1700s.  Claire longs to return to Jamie after discovering he didn't die in the battle and Bri and Roger encourage her to do so.    After Claire returns to the 1700s and Jamie, the book reminds me of an action movie.  There are often a half dozen wild activities swirling around all at one time.  Claire, Jamie and others go to sea and end up in the Caribbean where they encounter more challenges and lots of action.    Despite all the action, Claire and Jamie gradually learn more of each others activities during the past 20 years.    The writing is excellent as usual.  Characters and incidents that often seem minor have a way of popping up again many chapters later.  Even characters I thought dead turn out to be alive.    It was hard to put this book down and I sometimes stayed up too late reading it.
0670022411|5.0|A young witch who refuses, absolutely refuses, to use witchcraft, finds herself in danger until she falls in love and learns of her powers.  An allegory of a young woman, for young women, witches and crones who love a great story that will have them reading through moonrise.  The author's command of language and syntax turns words magically into weapons of women's power.  This most delightful book treats women as well as men with respect.  The lover is powerful until he falls in love; the gay aunts are powerful in their own rights; the heroine is bewitched through no fault of her own.  An intelligent book for intelligent women who prefer their stories smart and know what the word allegory means.  Buy it!  5 stars

B004SDSSFY|5.0|I've had this app now for a couple of months and so far, it's perfect!  Make sure that you have the free version on your phone first before you upgrade.  Also make sure that you get both versions from the same source.  So therefore, if you want the Amazon upgrade, but you already have the free version from the Android Market, you will need to remove it first and then redownload the free one from Amazon.  Either that or just upgrade directly from the free app or from the Android Market.  I downloaded both versions from the Amazon Mkt being that I already have an account with them and it was more convenient for me to make the purchase from here.  If you upgrade directly from the free app (to be on the safe side) be sure to pay attention to which source it's upgrading from, before you click on the buy button.  This app works smooth for me.  At first, being on the phone took a little bit of getting use to, but it didn't take long at all.  I love being able to edit my documents whenever I want to - and creating them is a breeze.  Just remember to back up and sync to keep the edits in order.
B000002549|5.0|I first heard a track from Classical Barbra on NPR this weekend. I was very impressed and did a search of iTunes to purchase it for my iPad and MacBookPro. Classical Barbra, sung by Barbra Streisand in 1973 and release in 1976 is a recording that will be forever played as long as Western Culture exists! At the time of the recording Barbra was in the 12th year of her awesome career and probably felt she have the power to produce a project regardless of marketing popularity. I think that's really amazing giving that Barbra is a pop singer! this classical album is far ahead of it's time. I think since we have grow up in the era of Barbra we really can not judge the album. Future generations will head this album with fresh ears and not feel the need to compare it with the body of her work that we all know so well. Classical Barbra contains 10 songs in six different languages which play for 33 minutes. The first track, 'Beau soir', just opens your eyes to an imaginary landscape of beauty and sunsets and sea shores. You hear Barbra's up notes and you too rise into the air on the wings of eagles. Maybe it's her accent or her style, but the blend of modern vocal skills with classic melodies is overwhelming. I could be song by song and explain my rapture but you already know about from the other reviews. I can only hope that maybe Barbra will add another album to this classical treasure and this is the really legacy of Barbra imo...
B0000024ZT|5.0|In September 1975, I moved to Hightstown, NJ, 10 minutes from Freehold, Springsteen's hometown. That August he had just released the monster album Born To Run. You didn't have to turn on the record player to hear a Springsteen song - it was everywhere. Like the Centralia, PA coal fires, Springsteen's music was smoldering in the ground beneath our feet, billowing out in beefy clouds from every corner bar, from every jukebox, from every passing car, from every boom box (yeah, portable stereos were getting BIG, literally). We were surrounded, engulfed, infused with his rollicking, syncopated rhythms and murky, bittersweet ballads.<br /><br />And so as I began that high school freshman year I was indoctrinated into the Springsteen Life. I was quickly introduced to his previous album The Wild, The Innocent & The E Street Shuffle. Born to Run was broad, beefy, operatic; the whole album still echoes in pulsing waves through my mind. But the second album was more modest, more contained, more intimate. I actually liked it more. \\"Well, if that's your taste, then try this\\", and so Greetings from Asbury Park NJ was presented to me. WOW! Even more contained, even more intimate. Yes. They had a look of recognition in their gleaming eyes - now I, too, knew what they knew. That first album was sublime. It was so compact, so humble, but it exuded such tremendous power, such intense glorious joy.<br /><br />Greetings From Asbury Park was a communal affair, we all took great personal pride in it. Who knew or cared what the rest of the country or the world felt about it, we knew the truth. It was an organic fact of our lives. It was framed and perched in nooks, garland adorned it, and incense burned at its base. These shrines were tended to with the utmost reverence, the limit of piety. Our few blessings were its doing, its kindness, its pleasure. I'm telling you, that album had some major mojo. And it still does. I still marvel at its almost claustrophobic ambiance, its muscular grooves, its delicate lyricism, and its near catastrophic earnestness. Such a balance of skill and chance, intent and magic, bravado and humility.<br /><br />Bob Dylan certainly exuded this same brazen, folky vibe, and maybe Van Morrison wielded his own Irish version too, but it was more often a quality that I encountered in female artists. Joni Mitchell, to name one. Or Carol King, or Billie Holiday, and of course Janice Joplin. So when women began to cover his songs it could only be good. The Pointer Sisters did a very fine job with his Fire in '78. Natalie Cole just tore up Pink Cadillac in '88. And a decade earlier Patti Smith made a national treasure of his Because the Night. It's a stunning rendition and a preeminent moment in Rock history. I've gone on a bit of a tangent here, but only to illustrate just how elemental was his creativity. His talent transcended standard macho rock & roll norms.<br /><br />Springsteen has had a remarkably successful career, producing quite a few more genuinely stellar hits, shifting and transforming as his muse beckoned. His catalog is a litany of excellence, and his name synonymous around the globe with Mega Rock Star. So against all that I hold up Greetings From Asbury Park NJ as a reminder, a clue, a beacon to all who may have forgotten or have never known just how great, how formidable, how chosen he was right from the start.

I have always been interested in stories regarding the Holocaust and I think it is important to keep our youth educated on the topic. I do not want to spoil any part of the book, but I became frustrated with the main character Bruno towards the end of the book because of his \\"stupidity\\" I would call it. However, I thought that the ending to the book really showed how children can be so naive and innocent and do anything for a friend. I would recommend this book to someone. Cannot wait to see the movie.

B004I2K4DY|4.0|Like many others who've reviewed the 25th anniversary \\"Les Mis\\" here, I loved the 10th anniversary \\"Dream Cast\\" version and for me, many of the main characters remain definitive in that version, more so than this.<br /><br />That said, this is still very enjoyable, with only two drawbacks for me. The pluses? The production itself is superior to the 10th anniversary--the staging, the orchestra and sound, the use of projection screens, the vast audience that clearly knows and loves the material (but has the respect for performers to stop applauding in the encore so we can hear them sing).<br /><br />No one has ever been a better Valjean for me than Colm Wilkinson, but Alfie Boe was still excellent and his more \\"operatic\\" version was still moving. For me, Wilkinson is just such a superior actor and the passion and conviction that he gave Valjean (whether in desperation or in heroism) was so much more successful for me than Boe's interpretation. But...YMMV as both are indisputably so talented.<br /><br />Likewise, I felt this Javert did not have the ruthlessness, nor the intellectual and moral conflict that Phillip Quast did. Norm Lewis was very good, but Quast, for me, was superb and his singing captured the character perfectly. Did they cut Javert's songs? I'm not an expert on \\"Les Mis\\" so I'm not certain if this was a trick of memory due to the performance difference or a genuine difference. Either way, Lewis' delivery was not as memorable for me, including in his final scene.<br /><br />I enjoyed Lea Salonga as Fantine and Samantha Bark as Eponine was very powerful. Enjolras moved me more here than in the original--and he was the only one whose performance I actually felt was stronger than the \\"Dream Cast\\".<br /><br />So? The bad?  For me, there were two performers who didn't work for me at all. First, the much-commented on Nick Jonas. I had an open mind going in, as I was completely unfamiliar with his singing. But, he really does disappoint. Not that he doesn't have a pleasant voice--he does--and I imagine he has -some- vocal training. The problem is...it isn't nearly enough for this role. When Michael Ball comes out in the finale, it just painfully underscored how Jonas' weak voice and inability to project or hit the big notes really ruined Marius. (And, imo, he brought no romantic charisma to his duet with Cosette either--and lacked much emotion at the barrciades as well..<br />If he wasn't \\"Nick Jonas\\" there's no way this man would have been cast in this part, imo. Very unfortunate (and hard to believe it was necessary). And, yes, I know he was Gavroche on Broadway, but that doesn't require the vocal strength of any of Marius' songs. Imo, he took the part from someone who would have been so much better (I'm sure there are many singers who would have been better).<br /><br />But, far worse, imo, was Matt Lucas whose acting, singing and general \\"look\\" ruined one of the biggest numbers, \\"Master of the House\\", for me (including post-Revolution), even bringing down Jenny Galloway, whose Mme. Thenardier had been so fantastic in the Dream Cast performance.<br /><br />But...all that aside, if you've never seen it before, this would be an overall very satisfying production of \\"Les Mis\\". And, if you're a big fan of the Dream Cast, you might agree with me that it's worth getting this for the encore alone--with Colm Wilkinson, Boe, and two current Valjeans singing together--then joined by others from this and the 10th anniversary cast, for a rousing \\"One Day More\\".  That was a GREAT finale and made the entire thing, flaws and all, well worth it for me.ve a pleasant voice--he does--and I imagine he has -some- vocal training.

Very unfortunate (and hard to believe it was necessary). And, yes, I know he was Gavroche on Broadway, but that doesn't require the vocal strength of any of Marius' songs. Imo, he took the part from someone who would have been so much better (I'm sure there are many singers who would have been better).<br /><br />But, far worse, imo, was Matt Lucas whose acting, singing and general \\"look\\" ruined one of the biggest numbers, \\"Master of the House\\", for me (including post-Revolution), even bringing down Jenny Galloway, whose Mme. Thenardier had been so fantastic in the Dream Cast performance.<br /><br />But...all that aside, if you've never seen it before, this would be an overall very satisfying production of \\"Les Mis\\". And, if you're a big fan of the Dream Cast, you might agree with me that it's worth getting this for the encore alone--with Colm Wilkinson, Boe, and two current Valjeans singing together--then joined by others from this and the 10th anniversary cast, for a rousing \\"One Day More\\".  That was a GREAT finale and made the entire thing, flaws and all, well worth it for me.

B001QWBM62|5.0|Above and beyond my expectations the H4n has become a vital part of our bands writing process.  With very little changes out of the box the H4n let's the full band record decent quality tracks which we all use in between sessions to work out our own parts in more detail.    We also hooked it up at a live show through the desk and the quality was good enough for us to post to our [...] site so you can check out the audio quality for yourself.    Definitely 5 stars.
044654759X|5.0|This book was by far one of Sparks' best books EVER. I could not put this book down and finished it in one sitting, in 3 hours. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who is a Sparks fan and beyond. The book of course has a romantic aspect to it, Sparks would not write a book otherwise. It is not my thing to talk a lot about the book, I do not want to spoil for anyone, however, this is an amazing book!
B001QKSWOE|5.0|Pleasant hours of reading,  Funny enought to make you laugh out loud when you are all alone.  Make your day a little brighter.

B003WSFXKY|4.0|bel disco, ottimamente suonato ed arrangiato, qualità audio buona ma non eccezzionale, un pò troppa saturazione e poca dinamica. Il DVD e buono, ma mancano i sottotitoli.

B001F0TM5I|1.0|This movie is boring!!!! Except for the last 10 minutes this movie is just people talking!!! And its not even interesting dialogue like Tarantino usually writes for his movies. I am a huge Quentin Tarantino fan. I even liked his story in Four Rooms, but this one is a total misfire. I was one of the lucky ones who got to experience the full Grindhouse movie in theaters and Tarantinos movie had people yawning and looking at there watches throughout. Very disappointing after Rodriguezs awesome Planet Terror and some hilarious faux trailers.I guess every movie maker has a misfire, and this is Tarantinos which I'm happy to say he corrected with his next film Inglorious Basterds!!!
0307276902|1.0|I was in the middle of reading this book when Oprah found out that Frey was lying throughout this book. In the beginning I was enjoying the book, and felt horrible for all the details that author was describing that he went through. Half way through the book, I heard that Oprah found out that this was all a lie. I forced myself to continue reading the book. I could not shake the feeling throughout the book that the author was lying about everything. I think that if the book was actually accurate and true, it would be an enjoyable read. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME!
0345410025|5.0|I discovered this gem in the late 1970s when I was in my 20s -- a collaboration between basketball star Jerry Lucas and memory expert Harry Lorayne. As a history buff, I immediately put its succinctly described systems to use memorizing a complete list of Roman emperors and other trivia for fun. Later, when my language learning hobby heated up, I used a different technique to quickly remember foreign vocabulary. To this day, I regularly use still another system to recall hotel room numbers and other significant figures. As a mnemonicist, Lorayne was a showman. He made of habit of allowing himself to be personally introduced to everyone in an organization he was about to speak to -- a process that sometimes lasted well over an hour. Once on the platform, after his presentation, he would then recall the name of each person in the audience.

B001SS3JS8|5.0|I love Jodi Picoult's books. I have yet to come across one that I did not enjoy reading. Jodi chooses to write about common controversial issues that many people are faced with, or at least see the arguments in the public. Each book grabs the reader in a different way and I would recommend any of her books to anyone!<br /><br />This is by far my favorite book of hers. I am not the type of person that re-reads books, and I cannot even count the amount of times I read this book. This book shows the love two teenagers had for each other. Picoult describes the struggles teenagers go through with being accepted, loved, and listening to their parents.<br /><br />Tear jerker, but a wonderful read!<br /><br />HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!
0375931007|5.0|Haunting and absolutely unforgettable. My own words honestly escape me as I try to share with you the beauty of this book. Seldom have I read a book as moving and profound. It's narrated by Death, but don't let that put you off. It's not the macabre skull and bones that you might imagine. With each page the story slowly crawls under your skin and reverberates your soul with images of love, friendship, and loss in Nazi Germany. Marcus writes with a beautiful poetic hand. I loved his style - his descriptions are unconventional and mesmerizing. There's enough joy and love scattered throughout that you will be smiling and laughing before you suddenly realize the tears have fallen. If you only read one book this year, read this one. The tears on my face may have dried but I will never forget this story. For sure this is one of my all-time favorite books.
0385751893|4.0|I finished this book in one sitting. I enjoyed reading it. I have always been interested in stories regarding the Holocaust and I think it is important to keep our youth educated on the topic. I do not want to spoil any part of the book, but I became frustrated with the main character Bruno towards the end of the book because of his \\"stupidity\\" I would call it. However, I thought that the ending to the book really showed how children can be so naive and innocent and do anything for a friend. I would recommend this book to someone. Cannot wait to see the movie.

159420229X|5.0|I am about halfway through this book and am very glad I purchased it.  Foer writes very well and keeps the reader captivated throughout.  As was clear from other reviews I've seen, this book is not a \\"how-to\\" for memory improvement.  What is does is provide a very thorough background of the subject's history and relate how numerous experts--from antiquity to the present champions--master the capability.  It is very worthwhile to understand the basics of the subject before getting into its practice, which will be my next step with another book for that purpose.
B0015XAT3Y|5.0|1977 was of course the year of punk and also the year of disco, but two inescapable albums also appeared in that year: 'Rumours' by Fleetwood Mac was released in February 1977 and in November that year, ELO released the double LP 'Out of the Blue'.    I disagree with some of the negative reviews. 'Out of the Blue' is a superb album from start to finish, and one which has really stood the test of time, as it still sounds as fresh today as it did when it was released over 33 years ago.  Written and produced and arranged in its entirety by Jeff Lynne, and recorded at Musicland Studios in Germany, this is an ambitious album with 17 extremely well crafted songs, including three of ELO's massive hits, 'Turn to Stone', 'Sweet Talking Woman', and 'Mr Blue Sky'.     The lush string and keyboards/synthesiser arrangements are faultless.    On the original vinyl release (now a single CD):  Side 1:  1. Turn to Stone  2. Its Over  3. Sweet Talking Woman  4. Across the Border  Side 2:  1. Night In the City  2. Starlight  3. Jungle  4. Believe Me Now  5. Stepping Out  Side 3:  Concerto for a Rainy Day  1. Standin' in the Rain  2. Big Wheels  3. Summer and Lightning  4. Mr Blue Sky  Side 4:  1. Sweet is the Night  2. The Whale  3. Birmingham Blues  4. Wild West Hero    All 17 tracks are superb and there is not a weak moment on the album. Pick of the bunch: 'Turn To Stone', 'Sweet Talkin' Woman', 'Night In the City', 'Starlight', and the four tracks that make up the 'Concerto for a Rainy Day'. These are absolutely brilliant and the rest of the set comes close to matching them. 'The Whale' is the best instrumental track ELO ever did and 'Big Wheels' is their finest ballad ever.    Without doubt this is ELO's best work, 'Face the Music' and 'A New World Record' are good but this is better. Its miles better than 'Discovery' and the band's later work. If you ever own one ELO album, buy this one.     The sound of the remastered CD doesn't have any major enhancements on the original CD, soif you don't want the bonus tracks stick to the original CD, although this is best heard on vinyl.    One not to be missed.

B0034G4OXQ|1.0|Clint Eastwood has to his credit a long list of great accomplishments. This film, which he produced and directed, is not one of them. Oh, it has its moments. The opening depiction of a tsunami striking a populous shore and a few other touching scenes scattered throughout the film do little to balance what is a confusing jumble of disparate story lines. An egocentric French journalist, twin boys trying to care for a substance-abusing mother, and a young woman haunted by her abusive father stumble along toward a nonsensical conclusion.    Matt Damon plays a genuine medium (oxymoron?) who is trying to break away from a lucrative career as a psychic consultant because of the pain it all causes.  Damon is not convincing. Perhaps he should have worn some exotic headdress. A long beard that glows in the dark?  A high-tech crystal ball?    I predict.....a big disappointment that will take up about two hours of your future if you watch this film.

B004K4AUZW|5.0|Lady Gaga's new album, \\"Born this Way,\\" is incredible! Not a single dull track on the cd. A bit different from her earlier all-dance tracks, but still, very upbeat, with many more dance tracks. There is more depth to these tunes, but they are all still very catchy. I purchased the special edition the day it was released at Best Buy. By far my favorite album of 2011! Other than the current hit singles that have been released off this album, Marry the Night, You and I, Government Hooker, Americano and Scheisse are my favorite tracks. Amazing stuff. If you're a little monster, then do yourself a favor, and buy the special edition. It includes a few bonus tracks and bonus disc, with the country road version of Born this Way as well as a few remixes of her hits. 5 stars!

B000OQF6N6|4.0|The Smashing Pumpkins have been through a lot in their almost 20 year career. In 1991, they released their indie debut \\"Gish\\" followed by their major label sophomore breakthrough, the Butch Vig produced \\"Siamese Dream\\". Two years later, they released what came to be their now-classic double album \\"Mellon Collie And The Infinite Sadness\\", an album where they would experience career highs as well as career lows. With their album becoming extrememly successful and almost every single being a hit, they couldn't escape their inner turmoil- such as their touring keyboardist Jonathan Melvoin succumbing to an overdose in the middle of their tour and drummer Jimmy Chamberlin being excised from the band shortly thereafter. Their follow-up album, 1998's \\"Adore\\" saw them issue the most dark and dreary recording of their career- primarily due to the death of Corgan's mother. With a handful of session musicians employed for the album, Chamberlin's playing was sorely missed. By the time they released 2000's \\"MACHINA/ The Machines Of God\\", they reunited with Chamberlin, but by then the band imploded. So, Corgan and Chamberlin formed the short-lived Zwan with former A Perfect Circle bassist Paz Lenchantin on thier first and only album \\"Mary Star Of The Sea\\". After the dissolution of Zwan, Billy Corgan released his debut solo album, the 2005 confessional \\"Thefutureembrace\\".<br /><br />When Corgan announced he was reforming the Smashing Pumpkins, feelings about the reunion were mixed. It was a reunion, but with only two of the members- noticeably absent were bassist D'Arcy Wretzky and guitarist James Iha. Corgan and Chamberlin went in to record 2007's \\"Zeitgeist\\", an album that was produced mostly by themselves with assistance from Terry Date (Soundgarden, Limp Bizkit) and Roy Thomas Baker (Queen, Journey). The album opens with the song \\"Doomsday Clock\\", which could also be heard in the Michael Bay film adaptation of \\"Transformers\\" and leads into \\"7 Shades Of Black\\" which has the vintage sound of their earlier work. Corgan pulls off an unabashed romantic theme on \\"That's The Way (My Love Is)\\", and turns it up a notch on the guitar heavy \\"Tarantula\\". There are shades of progressive rock on the nearly ten minute track \\"United States\\" while the ballad \\"Neverlost\\" employs a noticeably softer tone. There are a couple of uptempo rockers such as \\"Bring The Light\\" and \\"(Come On) Let's Go!\\", and the political nature of the bass heavy \\"For God And Country\\". The album closes with the chamber ballad \\"Pomp And Circumstances\\". While \\"Zeitgeist\\" is good album, it could have been better. The problem with this album is the mixing and mastering on several songs on this recording, where Corgan's voice is at times drowned out by guitars- when his voice isn't fading on a couple of the songs. Overall, it's still worth a listen- even if the name is misleading.d of their earlier work.

B004XDYJRU|5.0|I got this app when amazon offered it for free and I absolutely love it!  You can listen to pretty much anything.  They have all of the local radio stations plus radio stations from all over the world.  You can browse through stations based on genre, language, location, etc. and then once you choose a station, it offers to show you other stations you may like based on your selection.  Not only that, you can set a sleep timer, see the name of the song you are listening to, set an alarm clock, and so much more.  With PRO you can even record stuff.    No more satallite radio!  This app is definitely worth it!!!

B0047Y17P2|2.0|I've read every single Connelly book, but I'm taking a pass on the next one.  This book was so blatantly written with a hopeful eye to the big screen that I felt like I was reading dialogue, staging directions, and set descriptions.  Boring, trite, tedious, pathetically slow.  It even includes the obligatory, but pointless, attack by goons that puts Haller in the hospital.  That should play well on the big screen.  SPOILER ALERT!  For Micky Haller, the protypical defense attorney to switch sides in the last three pages and run for district attorney suspends all credibility.  And we are left with the suspicion that he does it at least in part to get back with his ex-wife.  Really?  I am sick to death of male leads (I'm talking to you, too, Jesse Stone.) who can't grow up and move on after the relationship ends.  Bottom line is that this book turned a complicated and introspective character into a cartoon of himself.  Don't bother reading it.

0345529057|4.0|The books are unbelievable;e, and I would suggest buying them if they were printed on newspaper, which is what some of the reviews might have you believe. I bought the set for a friend since I already had lent out my copies of the series, and we were expecting 'bible paper', 'CVS 99 cent rack\\" quality books, but they were much better then what I was expecting.

B0034G4P80|4.0|The God of Thunder (Chris Hemsworth) is banished to Earth to live as a powerless human in payment for his arrogance, where he befriends mortals (Natalie Portman, Stellan Skarsgard, and Kat Dennings) and comes to the notice of SHIELD, unaware of the cataclysmic political situation playing itself out back on his homeworld of Asgard.    This is a rousing adventure and a very successful adaptation of the comic book.  Hemsworth has the size, the arrogance, and the charm that his role requires.  Anthony Hopkins is imposing as Odin and Tom Hiddleston makes a surprisingly sympathetic Loki.  The complex relationship between the father and his two sons is one of the film's greatest strengths.  Unfortunately, the earthly segments are the weakest.  Even though the filmmakers had a lot of story to get through, Thor seemed to settle into his exile on Earth a little too quickly.  I also didn't believe his romance with Jane Foster.  I could understand why she might fall for a charismatic god who fell out of a wormhole, but it was harder to see why he would return the feeling when she was really nothing more to him than a kind stranger with a pretty face.  Fortunately, the film moves back to Asgard for its rousing finale.  Viewers with the patience to sit through the lengthy credits will be rewarded with a final scene that teases the Avengers movie.

0143039431|5.0|I was reading about religious revival meetings, a topic not far from my own experience growing up in a little country church, and it came to light that such events were similar to 18th century \\"Holy Fairs\\" in Scotland.  As many of the inhabitants of rural America--especially in the South and Appalachia--are of Scotch-Irish descent (many of my own ancestors included) it is natural to expect that the American revival meeting might have its origin in Lowland Scotland.  I also found that these Scottish \\"Holy Fairs\\" were ridiculed by the poet Robert Burns in his poem \\"The Holy Fair\\", as can be found in [[ASIN:1456381040 Poems and Songs of Robert Burns]].  Indeed, Burns considered such gatherings to be an assembly of hypocrites who attended these meetings in order to arrange assignations with the young women attending such events.  Of course Burns (the sire of numerous illegitimate children) was all for debauchery--just as long as it was indulged in a way that was free of pretense!<br /><br />As I continued thinking about this aspect of religious revival meetings I remembered the section of The Grapes of Wrath in which Tom Joad encounters Jim Casy, who had been a revival preacher in Tom's youth.  Casy tells Tom about how he would bed young women in the grass after they had been excited by such meetings, which seemed to have acted as a sort of aphrodisiac.  In Casy's confession to Tom he worried about his own hypocrisy in those days--leading those girls into sin just after exhorting them to shun such encounters.

1439107955|4.0|This is a terrific guide through the recognition, treatment and sometimes cure of cancer throughout history.It reads like a mystery with clues, some blue herrings and some solid evidence but always fascinating.<br />It is strange to say that the history of something so horrible as the \\"big C\\" should be that way.<br /><br /> My family, I thought had escaped its deadly spell of caner.  In the last few years, one of  my cousins died of breast cancer and another cousin has recently completed her treatment against invasive breast cancer also I have what if I am unfortunate could turn into a treatable but not curable cancer. I have learned that cancer is the enemy of everyone's family.<br /><br />It would be impossible to tell the story of all the cancers because as the book states \\"cancer is a variety of diseases\\". But the author does weave in a great variety of different kinds of cancer. And each one must be<br />treated with its own unique and appropriate treatment. I appreciate the tremendous amount of work it must have taken to pull all that together and to check and double check all the historical references,<br /><br />Most of the history of cancer is not that old. A lot of what is known about cancer has been in my own lifetime. Siddhartha Mukerjee, a cancer researcher, himself makes this history more personal with stories of the sufferers and the researchers and oncologists.<br /><br />The history of breast cancer treatment is full of so many controversies and the author corrected some false ideas that I had. The history of the fight against lung cancer includes not only the war with the tobacco companies that most people are aware of but also an unsuspected villain.<br /><br />I appreciate the tremendous amount of work it must have been to pull all this information together in one book.<br /><br />I recommend this book to anyone interested in the historical side of medicine and those who want to understand the process of progress in medicine.

First, I hate remakes, but since I did not know it was one at first, I can live with it.  I do hate the fact that the globalist keep trying to get us used to seeing and hearing British people for their return to ruling the US!  This film was not over the top and the stunts and killing was more realisitc than his other films.  To me, this is what helps me accept Statham more than his Transporter films.    Although they never explain why a British guy keeps traveling all over the US, I still like this one.  I still feel that there are way too many British people in US TV, film and horribly - the NEWS!!!
B004BJMEO6|4.0|Caveat:  I am reviewing this film as a hardcore film fan (all genres) and as a lesbian who finds \\"Claire of the Moon\\" and 99.8% of lesbian filmmaking in general utterly, completely unwatchable, not to mention unrepresentative of who we are.  There are standout films (\\"Go Fish\\", \\"The Kids are Alright\\", \\"The World Unseen\\" being my favorites), but mostly we sapphic types have to \\"make do\\" with failed but admirable attemps (\\"I Can't Even Think Straight\\" features nuanced performances from amazing, alluring female leads who are stuck doing the best they can w/ a miserable script and wooden supporting story and cast), or wildly messy experiments like \\"Girl Play\\" or \\"Room in Rome\\", which even the sex could not possibly redeem.      Girls, you know how long we've been waiting for someone, ANYONE to get it right. This one comes closer than anything I've seen.  I can honestly say the sex in this film surpasses anything that's ever been filmed before (porn does NOT count).  I applaud Nicole Conn (sorry for bashing Claire) for lingering where she should in the intimate moments without exploitation.  And she does linger, and linger, and it completely works.  These women are gorgeous together, and as a story it is fairly believable and their chemistry and acting are top notch.     That being said, this movie is still far from great. While the two main women were written very well, Nicole Conn oversimplified her supporting characters into cardboard, or overdrew them so much that they were total caricatures.  Sam Harris's character is used as an annoying narrative device to get these two characters together, but then he just wouldn't go away!  And of course the end was wrapped up a bit too neatly, but still.  We all can dream we get the straight girl...  Overall, totally worth seeing.

B004X2M3SI|5.0|I've been watching the new series of Doctor Who for awhile now and it keeps me waiting till the new episode comes out. Without giving away too much in spoiler, the first episode starts off with a bang that leaves you questioning many things and quite possibly re watching to see if you missed anything. This season we will finally get to see who River Song really is after being teased with her appearance in the 4th season. Though the mystery of River Song may be revealed I hope she will still make appearances in seasons to come. In the end questions will be answers and even more questions will be raised
B0051QIGP4|3.0|I purchased this when it was a buck.  Yeah, it took a bit to download but it really wasn't as bad as some would make you believe.  Heck, I would have paid the full price for it anyways, so I really got a steel.    BUT!...    I'm not impressed by the music.  Some of the songs were okay, but nothing that blew me out of the water like earlier Lady GaGa songs.  Even Born This Way is kind of dull, and it is easily the best song on the album.  I've listened to the album about three times through and I'm sure I'll listen to the songs again in the future but I thought I'd have this listened to about thirty times by now and only be sick of the songs because I overplayed them.    I hope her next album is better.  I fear this one won't do much for her career, which is a shame because I think she is one of the artists to come around in a long time.  I just think she is better than this album.  Hopefully she isn't getting washed up already.

0670022411|1.0|I have never written a review for a book before and that is because I have a very high tolerance for bad/entertaining writing.  However, this novel was completely contrived, predictable, and excruciatingly annoying.  I couldn't even finish the last 30 pages because the lack of backbone that the protagonist Diana was displaying was unbelievable.  She is such a weak character in terms of development and personality that her presence only fortifies sexist and misogynistic outlooks.  I was expecting an intelligent and modern fantasy novel and all I got was poorly written romantic drivel.  Real fantasy readers please don't waste your time.

0061998885|5.0|He doesn't fail to disappoint.  Yes I understand that all of his crime series novels have the same basic structure but who likes change?  If the formula works why deviate?  This one starts off where the other one left off in series with Patrick Kenzie trying to get his life and detective business back on track after his partner, in more ways than one, has left.  Angela was a big part of his life and he is suffering for it.  He's not nearly as focused on his job as before.  After a former client, Karen, kills herself by leaping off the observation deck of a building it unnerves him.  He neglected to call her back after she left a message on his answering machine.  Could he have saved her?  Why doesn't anything add up?  Could this straight laced girl really become a drugged out prostitute?  What could have caused her to spiral out of control so quickly?
0312600844|5.0|Having never read Franzen before, I wasn't sure what to expect.  It is so rare to read a book that actually lives up to the hype.  I am usually disappointed and was fully expecting to be disappointed by this one.  Instead, I found myself completely taken with this book.  It is without a doubt one of the best novels I've read in recent years.<br /><br />I think the thing that impresses me most is that Franzen doesn't work very hard to impress.  I don't mean he doesn't work hard as a writer.  I'm sure he sweated copiously over each page.  What I mean is that he doesn't try to impress us with a convoluted plot or characters that seem to be pulled from rarified air.  The furthest he goes is some precocious sex between two pubescents and one major character who becomes a rock star.  Otherwise, he sticks to a fairly straightforward, albeit deeply drawn, family story.<br /><br />Patty and Walter Berglund are parents to Jessica and Joey.  Throw in Richard Katz, Walter's best friend from college and a successful musician, and you have the pentagram between which the threads of this story are patterned.  Patty (former athlete and depressive) is pulled between her husband, Walter (insufferably stuck to his own moralities), and Richard (insensitive and hedonistic).  Having chosen Walter, however, she tries to stick with him in her way, smothering her son and ignoring her daughter in the process, leading to not atypical forms of youthful rebellion, aided and abetted by Walter's unflinching view of the world.<br /><br />As I said, there's nothing special about the plot.  What is special is the way the story is told, leading to incredible insight into the characters.  First, the story jumps around in time, allowing Franzen to give us glimpses of the future before taking us back in time to add detail to what we know and then jumping again to a farther future to show us how things develop.  In addition, he makes brilliant use of one of my favorite techniques: he constantly switches between narrators, not to tell different stories, but to give differing views of the same story.  Each of the major characters gets a chance to tell his or her version of the story, spreading sympathy around the board.  It works wonderfully well.<br /><br />In fact, this is everything that I like in a novel.  It is long enough to have some real development.  (Good as some of them are, I tire of these short novels.)  It is about character more than plot, especially in that you can believe this stuff really happened and that these are real people, in the sense that they have both good and bad qualities.  Also, it ends quietly, and well.  A tour de force.  (I guess now I have to go back and read his other novels.)o tell different stories, but to give differing views of the same story.

B000B5OD4I|2.0|This is a great looking watch.  Very durable and I like that the front face is flat, minimizing scratches.  In addition, it has a very clean look which allows the wearer to quickly glance and observe the time.  However, about 2 years into ownership, the watch started to run fast, by a few mintues a day.  I sent it back to Seiko for repair (US Customer service center in NJ) and it appeared as if the problem was fixed.  However after about a year, the watch now runs close to 40-50 minutes fast PER DAY.  As nice as it looks, a watch has to tell time correct.  This one didn't after a while; be wary when purchasing.

0316056863|4.0|Tina Fey never disappoints. From SNL to 30 Rock, I've always been a fan. The poem \\"to our daughters\\" had me in tears.

B00004ZBVG|3.0|Lt.Col. Iceal Hambelton was an Air Force Officer, and an expert in electronic-warfare and ballistic missiles. He had been involved in several missile development programs and other vital aspects of technology. Needless to say, he had a Top Secret security clearance.    Serving on an electonic-warfare plane as navigator, he was the only survivor when he parachuted over Quang Tri province, deep in North Veitnamese territory. In fact, he landed in the midst of a massive NVA ofgfensive, and the attempts to rescue Hambelton were truly epic. Five U.S. aircraft were destroyed, and nine severely damaged. Eleven airmen were killed in action, and two were captured.     Bat21 is a highly FICTIONALIZED account of the historical event. Gene hackman plays Lt.Col. hambelton in this portrayal of the incident. Danny Glover plays Captain Clark, ...an entirely FICTIONAL character, who ultimately rescues the stranded colonel. In REALITY, ...Lt.Col. Hambelton was rescued by a Navy SEAL, Lt.J.G. Norris and ARVN Commando Nguyen Van Kiet.    Despite the enormous Hollywood deviations from reality and the HISTORICAL FACTS, this is not a bad movie. The character of Captain Clark, although fictional, is truly notable as relentless forward air control pilot in a Cessna Skymaster, ...who never gives up in his attempts to guide the downed airman out of harms's way. Like a REAL AMERICAN, Clark never gives up in this attempt. Unfortunately, it is someone like Danny Glover in this role, but he did a good job. I was greatly disappointed to find that this part of the story never happened!    For what its worth, I think this film does a good job of portraying the truest character of American servicemen who bravely risked their lives in Veitnam. It also accurately portrays the REAL brutality of the communist NVA troops.     Some other flagrant deviations from reality:  -Hambelton and Clark engaging in long conversations, ...on the RADIO, INA COMBAT ZONE!!! (as if they were on the telephone)! There are scenes of an NVA communications team listening in on the transmissions. SURELY an electronic-warfare officer would be AWARE of that, ...and the inevitable triangulation from RDF!    ...and a factual observation:  It is noted in the film, that the NVA already has a large file on Lt.Col. Hamblen. Its true. How did this come to be?  ...While REAL Americans were fighting and serving in Veitnam, ....their were leftists on various American university campuses, who were ASSEMBLING RESEARCH ON DEPLOYED AMERICAN SERVICE-MEMBERS. THIS DATA WAS SUBMITED TO THE GOVERNMENTS OF NORTH VEITNAM, THE U.S.S.R., AND THE \\"PEOPLES\\" REPUBLIC OF CHINA!
1599218011|2.0|I've made it thru the first 3 chapters of Crazy, Sexy Diet. I find the subject interesting, and I am a FIRM believer in the connection between diet and cancer. But what a drudge to try and get thru this book!! The author's writing style is vulgar, loud, corny, \\"trying to be hip\\", and in your face. It just screams to me of being a calculated marketing strategy. Quite simply, she's obnoxious. If she talks in real life, the way she writes in this book; how could anyone stand to be around her?    That doesn't mean that the information she provides is not helpful. I fully intend on finishing the book and making changes. At this point I am assuming she knows what she is talking about. But I think the author is a great example of the \\"look at me\\" generation who calculate how to draw the most attention to themselves.     Crazy is right.

0061922315|5.0|It has been many years since I took the time to read an entire book in just one day, but I started Secret Daughter today at 4 p.m., didn't put it down once, and had it finished by 10 p.m.  It was just that good.<br /><br />Perhaps some of the characters weren't as developed as they should have been - for instance, I don't feel that the adopted parents, Krishna or Somer, were as developed as they could have been.  But I don't feel like this was detrimental to the story because Secret Daughter was really the story of the secret daughter, Asha, discovering her Indian roots and learning the real meaning of family.<br /><br />As is often said and is pointed out in the book, at some point family becomes the family you choose, and not the family you are born into.  Secret Daughter is the story of Asha discovering that even though she shares no blood with her adopted family, they are her family all the same.<br /><br />All told, this was a beautiful story that will make you smile and it will bring a tear to your eye.

0810993139|4.0|I picked up this book after my 7-1/2-year-old daughter read it.  In part, I was curious what the fuss was all about, but I also wanted to check out what she was reading and determine if it was satisfactory material for her.  (Certainly, this was something I should have done BEFORE she started it, but we don't live in a perfect world.)  Although the book does use terms like \\"jerk,\\" \\"stupid\\" and \\"moron,\\" its application of those words is hardly something to get too charged up about, since there isn't any name-calling going on per se.  The narrator of the story, a boy named Greg, is merely writing things in his diary.  It's all fairly harmless and amusing stuff.  The copious amounts of cartoons certainly add to the story and help to move it along.  Recommended.

B000JBWWRY|2.0|If your eyes are not open already, the portrayals in this Disney movie are highly stereotypical and misguided. In this film some Indians are shown as acting like stupid, cartoonish, warlike primitives.     There is a song in the film that is offensive called \\"What Makes The Red Man Red?\\". Here are it's lyrics:      \\"Once the Injun didn't know/ all the things that he know now / But the Injun he sure learn a lot/ And it's all from asking \\"How\\" What made the red man red/ Let's go back a million years/ to the very first Indian Prince He kiss a maid and start to blush/ and we've all been blushin' since.\\"      The author of Peter Pan, Mr Barrie, has also been criticized for his treatment of female characters.  Most of the female characters: Wendy, Tinker Bell, Tiger Lily, and the mermaids try to gain immature Peter Pan's affections; and Tinker Bell makes several attempts on Wendy's life out of jealousy, yet Peter shows no empathy and ignores all of their affections with indifference.     Would you like children to watch and learn from this on how to understand Indians? Would boys watching this be helped to learn how to grow up to be mature men, and have happy relations with mature women?  Would girls learn from watching this that its okay to try and have a boyfriend like an emotionally unavailable Peter Pan?

B002HJ9PTO|2.0|I purchased the ATR-3350 from Amazon LLC directly. Product arrived fine with no visible external damage. But there was too much noise and not enough gain from the microphone when used with a Sony Digital Voice Recorder on a plug-in power microphone jack.<br /><br />I saw visible evidence of melted plastic around a solder joint inside the battery compartment, so I immediately requested an exchange from Amazon. That was a hassle free experience and a replacement arrived shortly.  The new mic initially tested good.  Sound quality was excellent and there was no noise in the line.<br /><br />The following day while recording in the field, random pops and clicks from electrical shorts plagued the production.  It was not constant, but it ruined portions of some takes.  When I got home, I experimented with the mic, flexing the cable at the endpoints: plug, two battery compartment connections, and the microphone capsule.<br /><br />The noise was isolated to moving the cable at the base of the microphone capsule.  I pulled the cable straight down and something gave.  The noise immediately stopped. On another production, the mic operated flawlessly with great sound throughout the entire take.<br /><br />For a mic of this type (unbalanced battery powered), the sound quality is very good to excellent.  The components are machined metal, which means the actual microphone capsule is small compared to other brands in the same price range.  The output cord is extra-long, which works well for field video recording:  just run the cable outside of the camera's view from the talent to the tripod.<br /><br />The mic does have a lifetime guarantee and Audio-Technica will repair it for an 8 USD handling fee. But given I received two defective samples, I can't recommend the microphone to people who do not have the time to deal with potential build quality problems.
B004XWLN20|5.0|AUTHOR'S NOTE:  I will highlight and examine pivotal and/or great episodes from all ten seasons in this review.  Spoilers will follow.    REVIEW    \\"Smallville\\" is a phenomenal series, never losing overall creative steam through ten years producing in excess of 200 episodes.  Starring Tom Welling, Michael Rosenbaum, Kristin Kreuk, Annette O'Toole, John Schneider, John Glover and Allison Mack, it expertly tells the story of a youthful Clark Kent, growing up in the titular rural town.  It is arguably the most ambitious, well-executed TV series of its kind.     The first season picks up with a superlative pilot episode, as Clark's spaceship lands during a catastrophic meteor shower.  A red-haired boy named Lex Luthor gets his hair singed off by a meteor but escapes with his life.  The pilot also introduces a man by the name of Lionel Luthor.  Played superbly by John Glover, Lionel is a monstrously manipulative father for Lex.  At the opposite end of the spectrum, Johnathan and Martha Kent find the baby whose ship was the reason for the meteor shower.  John Schneider and Annette O'Toole are a very youthful-looking Johnathan and Martha Kent, and play the parts so naturally it's easy to forget the image of older Eddie Jones and K Callan from \\"Lois and Clark:  The New Adventures of Superman\\" and Glenn Ford and Phyllis Thaxter from \\"Superman:  The Movie.\\"  Mr. Schneider and Ms. O'Toole pair with Tom Welling to form the best long-running representation of DC Comics' Kent Family I've ever seen.      The pilot, simply called \\"Pilot,\\" also puts forth that kryptonite invades Smallville with the meteors and creates genetically altered teenagers.  Admittedly, the first of the bunch, a guy named Jeremy Creek, isn't necessarily the strongest villain.  But, his story presentation sets up iconic imagery for the series.  As Smallville High's first Scarecrow, Jeremy is a harbinger for the brand of torture that eventually befalls Clark himself.  An equally important story theme is the premise that the meteors that Clark rides in with kill Lana Lang's natural parents.  This gives Clark and Lana an intriguing set of issues that keep them apart.  Lana also ignorantly wears a kryptonite necklace as a keepsake that keeps Clark at a distance.             First season episode highlights are \\"Pilot,\\" \\"Hourglass,\\" \\"X-Ray,\\" \\"Leech,\\" \\"Jitters,\\" \\"Zero,\\" and \\"Stray.\\"  Guest stars in the first season include Amy Adams, Eric Christian Olsen, and Shawn Ashmore.    The second season of \\"Smallville\\" is also very solid.  Beginning with \\"Vortex,\\" it presents a new set of challenges for both Clark and Lex and deepens the overall storyline considerably.  Lex becomes more obsessed with Clark and more distrustful and hostile toward his hateful father.  This season sows seeds that the series expands upon for years.  In \\"Skinwalker,\\" Clark discovers a cave system that connects brilliantly to his own life story, and he also develops an infatuation with a beautiful Native American activist.  Here is one of the series' first sustained myth-building devices, as the Kawatche Caves are revisited substantially over the next two years.  The series also takes a leap toward its future with \\"Rosetta,\\" a very well-conceived way for Clark to first learn about Krypton.  Widely-respected \\"Superman\\" film actor Christopher Reeve makes the first of two appearances as Dr. Virgil Swann, a reclusive billionaire scientist interested in Clark's life and powers.    Second season episode highlights are \\"Vortex,\\" \\"Skinwalker,\\" \\"Rosetta,\\" \\"Calling,\\" \\"Ryan,\\"  \\"Suspect,\\" and \\"Insurgence\\".   Notable guest stars for the second season are Christopher Reeve, Terence Stamp, Paul Wesley(billed as 'Paul Wasilewski'), Emmanuelle Vaugier, and Jonathan Taylor Thomas.    The third season is very, very strong as the series matures into a meaty yarn with epic ambitions.  An expansion of a pronounced father-son theme evident from the pilot means deeper storylines for John Schneider as well as John Glover.  The extreme differences between the show's fathers come to the forefront in the third season premiere.  John Schneider's Johnathan Kent is in anguish and desperate for Clark's safe return in \\"Exile,\\" whereas John Glover's Lionel Luthor is nonchalant about Lex's own disappearance.  \\"Exile\\" also features Rutger Hauer as Morgan Edge, a top crime boss in Metropolis who slyly takes advantage of Clark's red kryptonite-affected superpowers for his own gain.  The follow-up show \\"Phoenix\\" is a perfect continuation of the premiere, as Edge and members of his gang trail a safely restored Clark back to Smallville.    The third season is so strong that I could legitimately list eighteen or nineteen of it's twenty-two episodes as highlights.  Nevertheless, episode highlights are \\"Exile,\\" \\"Legacy,\\" \\"Perry,\\" \\"Relic,\\" \\"Shattered,\\" \\"Memoria,\\" and \\"Covenant.\\"  Notable guest stars are Rutger Hauer, Patrick Bergin, and Michael McKean.    The fourth season introduces Lois Lane, at first a recurring character on the show played by Erica Durance.  The season touches briefly on the Lane Family by bringing in guest star Michael Ironside for two episodes as Gen. Sam Lane, Lois' father.  Also, Peyton List appears for one episode as Lois' sister Lucy Lane.  Unfortunately, the season soon turns primarily to Lana Lang and her new boyfriend for the season, Jason Teague.  Played by Jensen Ackles of TV's \\"Supernatural,\\" Jason Teague is a thin character who is upstaged by his mother Genevieve.  Genevieve Teague is deliciously played by Jane Seymour.  The Teagues connect to an ill-conceived witch plotline for Lana Lang that bogs down most of the season.    Episode highlights for the fourth season are \\"Crusade,\\" \\"Unsafe,\\" \\"Pariah,\\" \\"Run,\\" and \\"Commencement.\\"  Notable guest stars are Michael Ironside, Jane Seymour, and Margot Kidder.    The fifth season is terrific, continuing to embellish toward the \\"Superman\\" legend, with arguably the series' boldest character push in that direction to that point.  The seasonintroduces Brainiac in the form of a humanoid college professor played by James Marsters.  Mr. Marsters does a very nice job of playing the character, and he and Tom Welling have a very good season-long story arc together.  Brainiac plays off of Clark and Lex in different ways, and the character becomes both a menace on his own terms and a harbinger of Zod.    Fifth season episode highlights are \\"Arrival,\\" \\"Mortal,\\" \\"Solitude,\\" \\"Splinter,\\" \\"Cyborg,\\" \\"Lexmas,\\" and \\"Oracle\\".  Notable guest stars are Carrie Fisher, James Marsters, Alan Ritchson, and Lee Thompson Young.    The sixth season continues to bring other \\"Superman\\" locales and themes into play.  The season premiere \\"Zod\\" debuts an awesomely executed, fully believable Phantom Zone and an intriguing new female character named Raya.  The premiere also introduces Jimmy Olsen for the first time in the series, played to great effect by Aaron Ashmore.  Oliver Queen is introduced in the season's second episode \\"Sneeze,\\" and debuts his full Green Arrow persona two shows later in the aptly titled \\"Arrow.\\"  Oliver is played by Justin Hartley, and has a prep school history with Lex, explored in the episode \\"Reunion.\\"  Clark is busy battling Phantom Zone escapees, and heartbreakingly watching a very frustrated Lana agree to marry an increasingly nasty Lex Luthor.    Sixth season episode highlights are \\"Zod,\\" \\"Arrow,\\" \\"Nemesis,\\" \\"Promise,\\" and \\"Justice.\\"  Notable guest stars are Justin Hartley and Phil Morris.    The seventh season introduces the series' version of Kara Zor-El/Supergirl, played by Laura Vandervoort.  It's an up-and-down season that is strongest when it focuses almost exclusively on Clark, as in the excellent \\"Traveler.\\"  Big changes come to the cast in general this year.  Notable guest stars are Marc McClure and Helen Slater.    Episode highlights are \\"Bizarro,\\" \\"Traveler,\\" and \\"Persona.\\"    The eighth season brings on both Davis Bloome and Tess Mercer, played respectively by Sam Witwer and Cassidy Freeman.The season also finally makes Justin Hartley a regular.  Allison Mack's Chloe Sullivan takes a dark turn in an unhealthy relationship with Davis.  Clark must contend with the morally slippery Tess Mercer, and the progressively dangerous Davis Bloome.  Episode highlights are \\"Odyssey,\\" \\"Bride,\\" \\"Legion,\\" and \\"Beast.\\"    The ninth season brings Zod on in corporeal form, played very solidly by Callum Blue.  The season does a good job of giving Zod weight, by giving him a true army and a good backstory.  Episode highlights are \\"Savior,\\" \\"Metallo,\\" and \\"Kandor.\\"  Guest stars are Brian Austin Green and Julian Sands.    The tenth season ends the series wonderfully, bringing back veteran \\"Smallville\\" actors in meaningful roles and giving Clark his biggest challenges ever in Darkseid and his minions.  Guest stars are John Schneider, John Glover, Michael Rosenbaum, Annette O'Toole, James Marsters, Christine Willes, and Lucas Grabeel, among many others.  Episode highlights are \\"Kent,\\" \\"Luthor,\\" \\"Abandoned,\\" \\"Dominion,\\" and \\"Finale.\\"    I probably will not buy this set, as it will mostly be repeating what I already own or plan to own with individual season sets.  \\"Smallville\\" is a truly great television series, though.
0307595862|1.0|Would it be too much to say that this snowman was built to melt?  My bad joke aside, the writing is quick and dark in the early parts of this work.  However, the cliched ending becomes transparent relatively early on.  It is not a first order thriller.
B004R13U6Y|3.0|I can see documents but it recently stopped letting me save as... it just says &quot;It is failed to save&quot;. weird.
0142437611|3.0|This is one of Bellow's finest short works of fiction. A lot of his later short novels are spotty at best, but this earlier one captures an American spirit that is fun to behold.
B004AHNIGM|4.0|I've mised you, Gregg - however, am a bit disapointed that you didn't write more of the music on this CD.  It is, however very well done and you sound great!  I have recommended this CD to many and played it for many.
0743297334|5.0|One of Hemingway's masterpieces, this work has everything a reader could hope for in a classic -- sparse prose, compelling characterization, and a definitive look at a whole generation. This should not be missed by anyone seeking to understand American literature.
B00005JNJV|5.0|What is your mission in life? Great cast (Christain Bale, Gary Oldman, Morgan Freeman, Rutger Hauer, Michael Caine, Liam Neeson, and Cillian Murphy to name a few), and as always great toys (The tumbler). Batman is back in a gritty reboot that gets the job done right. Batman Begins is directed by Christopher Nolan. Any fan of superhero films should watch this.
0446613444|3.0|This is a fitting follow-up to \\"The Black Echo.\\" Connelly continues to develop Bosch as a character through the use of jazz and his personal relationships.
B0050VJ29Y|5.0|This is such an intense, amazing album. The more you listen to it the more you get addicted to the sound. The music transport  yourself to imaginary places where everything is possible and can happen. It is not just an homage to Italian film soundtrack it is an homage to ingenuity. Everything is perfect: the rhythm, the interlude, the voices, the orchestra, every single instrument. It is a unique experience, a masterpiece. Although it is hard to pick one single piece, my favorite song is \\"Rose with a broken neck\\". Here Jack White gives the best of himself. There are no words to describe this album: LISTEN TO IT and HAPPY DREAMS!
0375701427|3.0|This is a decent read, but generally I am not a fan of Roth's work. Overall, this is too inside-baseball with lots of meandering, endless sentences.
B004SBQAL0|4.0|I enjoyed this movie a lot.. So much so that I decided to read the book after it... The book itself is amazing and I can't wait to read the other sequels to it.. This movie was very different from the book as far as the action scences.. Either way I did enjoy the movie just wish it was a little closer to the book.. I hope they would make sequels but I don't think it made enough money.. Action is great, Acting is great, I think everyone should give the movie a try then also read the book after..
0312330871|5.0|This, as much as anything, really made me love the mystery and suspense genre. This is a tremendous book that is as classic today as it was when it was published.
0307887960|5.0|Arrived in perfect condition.  Discovered this cost more at Walmart, my girlfriend will order this from Amazon also. Even Dr. Oz has given this a Thumbs Up, says anything that motivates someone to get started losing weight is a good thing.
0425200469|4.0|Some say this is Christie's other great work -- probably because of the movie. This is a very good Poirot novel. However, it fails to come close to \\"Murder on the Orient Express\\" or \\"And Then There Were None.\\"
0425241505|5.0|I so loved this book.  Pia is blackmailed by her ex-boyfriend to swipe an item from Dragos' horde.  She takes a penny but leaves one in exchange.  Dragos goes mad with anger and hunts her down.  This is the story of the most alpha of all alpha's I've ever read.  And I just love Pia.  She really has a way with our yummy dragon aka Big Guy.
1400031524|4.0|This is as good of a thriller as one is likely ever to read. A first-rate work with awesome settings and exciting twists and turns, it will leave a reader exhausted and enlivened.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|Having already read Fast Food Nation I was well aware of the practices of factory farms and the cruelties imposed on the animals there but it was really an eye-opener seeing it on film. The simple message from this film was that you are what you eat and you get what you pay for. It's worth the extra $$ to buy cruelty free and to buy organic, otherwise you're consuming diseased, genetically altered, low quality food that will most likely make you sick.
0446619078|3.0|This book helps further build Bosch as a character as his investigation of his mother's murder shows where he came from before departing for Vietnam. It is one of Connelly's best books in the series.
B0051QIGP4|5.0|I saw this while looking around for products to buy.<br />$1.00 and I had to buy it. Normally an album can range from $10-15 dollars, depends on the store.<br /><br />Lady Gaga has some good songs in this album. I wish her other albums were cheap so I can buy it.<br /><br />5/5 Stars
0312600844|2.0|A terrific narrative style for roughly 400 pages, the ending is ultimately unsatisfactory and messy. Whether because of poor editing or an inability to pull the threads together, Franzen leaves a reader wondering why he or she cared for so long about self-important characters he aptly builds from nothing. **One odd point about the ending is that Franzen delves into the death of a leading character's father (who even she never saw) rather than pull together a real reconnection between the two male leads.** Entertaining, but far from the best American work of 2010.
B004E0Z4XK|5.0|This is a delicious collaboration of several stars under the same roof. It's very moving and actually romantic in a modern sense. Many influences from Italian cinema of the sixties and beyond to todays progressive sounds.<br /><br />I don't know a thing about Danger Mouse but this is the second fantastic album of collaborations I have purchased with his stamp, the other being Sparklehorse and David lynch,\\"Dark Night of the Soul\\". Another great album.  Jack White and Nora Jones are really very good here. Highly recommended.
0802130208|5.0|The last time I laughed out loud while reading -- numerous times, in fact -- was when I experienced this work.  Every situation, every exchange is just plain funny and it helps foster a jovial reading experience.  I intend to re-read this numerous times throughout the rest of my life.
0307477479|2.0|This would not have been a bad book of short stories - it's entertaining in that regard.  But to call it literature  seems odd - to award such prestigious prizes to an author who is not really capable of pulling off metafiction  (her sendoff of David Foster Wallace isn't even close apart from the fact that they both use footnotes) -  is wrong.  The shifting back and forth in time is interesting, but not original.  The plots are interesting, but  not original.  It's not a bad book - it's worth reading and it's a nice book for a beach vacation.  I'm just not  seeing how one would call it literature.  For an interest in metafiction or changing perspective why not read  the real thing?  DeLillo is still writing, Pynchon as well, David Foster Wallace's books are out there,   Faulkner's \\"The Sound and the Fury\\" and Proust's books are worth reading before the goon squad...
0307477479|2.0|This type of fiction is a perfect example of why American writers are often shut out of global awards. The book is too insular, too cute, and too disconnected. Interesting for the sake of being interesting. A few of the passages are finely written, but more often a reader is left wondering why he or she should care about these characters and, later on, why should he or she care if Egan can pull this work off?
B003P2WO5E|5.0|I am shocked! I had seen this book in stores before but had put off buying it for fear of it just being another epic...that sucks. We will see if it ends up sucking but I must say this book turned out to be a fantastic read! I had originally read all of Brandon Sanderson's other books in preparation for his work on the last few books of the Wheel of Time series. You can definitely note his progression from series to series on developing the background and the characters without trying to just rehash what has been done with different names.     Like a lot of other reviews there were times I couldn't wait to find out what happened next only for him to start a chapter on another of the main characters. Not good or bad but sometimes I rushed through a chapter hoping I'd find out what happened in to Kaladin at points. At some points I found myself loathing some of the main characters and genuinely despising them as much as they must have been despising themselves. A very strong ending that makes me want to know what will happen! In another 1.5 years the next book will be released and I'll have to reread the 1st book to refresh my memory, just like I had to do with the Wheel of Time Series.     A good book, I'm glad I waited to buy due to the price drop from last fall until now. My 1st Kindle book too!
0062073494|5.0|It is hard to find anything bad to say about this classic -- it must have been thrilling when it first hit bookstores.
0061733199|4.0|I found this book to be written by a professional individual. It is very enlightening and informative.   I enjoyed thumbing thru this manual(book)to get the over all outlook that the author is trying to convey.   The sections I did make the time to read,I enjoyed and found educational.   I am proud to say this manual will be in my survival(get bag).   I would have rated the manual 5 stars instead of 4 stars but I am yet to finish reading it,I am 2/3rds thru at the time of this review.   D. Wright  Seattle,WA
B000GH2YPG|5.0|This is such a haunting story.  I read it several months ago and still can't stop thinking about it.  What I appreciate most about the work is how it plays with a reader's perspective so well.  Just when one thinks he or she has it figured out, one realizes that one has been completely wrong all along ...
B00003CXB4|5.0|Thank you for keeping your committment and sending the DVD as promised.  It was received quickly and in good shape.
0002312824|3.0|I read this on a vacation and thoroughly enjoyed the mystery Christie creates.  This is a mystery with interesting characters, a compelling crime, and a fantastic setting.  One of Christie's finest creations!
B000001G7O|3.0|I liked this version but have to agree with others who have commented before that it is not the best. It seemed to be missing the intensity that I have heard with some other interpretations. Some passages seemed even a bit sterile. My favorite was on a cassette tape that I bought in the 1970s that I lost some years back and I believe it was by a Russian or an eastern European symphony. If you are purest when it comes to Russian composers then I would say skip this one.
044661758X|3.0|This is not the best in the Bosch series, but is still better than \\"Nine Dragons\\" and some of the other weaker additions. Here, Connelly does a lot to continue building the LAPD detective as a character.
B004O0VAVA|1.0|Don't buy this if you want to read it, the formatting is terrible.  It's like whoever created it just rendered the public domain version in notepad and converted that to a e-book.  Instead buy \\"The Complete Plays Of Shakespeare (Special Kindle Illustrated and Commented Edition) for the same price.<br /><br />Don't take my word for it, download a sample.  I ended up buying the other one.  This version should get zero stars.
B002MAQSJ8|4.0|A gripping read that will have one questioning how Wall Street works and why certain financial moves are made. Lords of the Realm -- Helyar's other book -- is a tremendous work, but this is better and will change how one views the world of business.
B004SBQAN8|4.0|Big, loud and overblown, this Michael Bay production obviously aims for the teen audience in its TWILIGHTish movie.  They even throw in GLEE's Diana Argon for good measure!<br />Is I AM NUMBER FOR a great movie?  Not really.  Is it enjoyable?  Yes, it entertains with its chaotic action sequences and good special effects.  Like other reviewers, I question the kill in order motive, where's number five..etc.<br />Alex Pettyfer looks good but doesn't have a very wide emotional range, but I'm sure that's not what the producers wanted.  Ms. Argon inherits the Kristen Stewart role admirably.  Reliable Timothy Oliphant does well with little to work with.  Kevin Durand's Tim Curry impersonation is fun and Jake Abel's jock is appropriately smarmy.<br />Director D.J. Caruso handles the movie well and hits his target audience.<br />Ultimately, it's enjoyable and a sequel inevitable which will probably feature more of Teresa Palmer's hot #6!
1400052181|3.0|I enjoyed the human interest portion about Henrietta and her family. Skloot's exhausting research and personal involvement in the story added an additional perspective.  The technical portion, while not difficult to follow, was not always as engaging, perhaps because there is a multitude of information! I finished the book quickly and I'd say it was an OK read.  So if this is a book you think sounds interetsting ... go for it
B004I1AGTC|4.0|Great fighting between Sammo and Yen on table. Villian boxer was cast well. Donnie's movies rarely disappoint, I've been a fan of his since Iron Monkey.
0312370849|1.0|The subject matter & the historical events of the time period require not only well-researched knowledge on an author's part but also frankly any well written book should be poignant & beautifully written. Unfortunately this book seems to be written overly simplistically (short sentences, superficial characters, juvenile vocabulary). When there are well written books out there about the Holocaust & other deeply moving events in history, I would not waste time reading a book like this one.     Here's an example of the book's overly simplistic writing style. Chapter one, first & second sentences: \\"The girl was the first to hear the loud pounding on the door. Her room was closest to the entrance of the apartment.\\" Compare that to Gabriel Garcia Marquez' opening sentence from Love In The Time of Cholera: \\"It was inevitable: the scent of bitter almonds always reminded him of the fate of unrequited love.\\"     Everyone has a right to their opinion and some of you may disagree with mine. If you enjoy reading this book, fabulous. I won't be wasting my time reading any more of de Rosnay's novels. Have to say though, I love her name (or pen name).
B003Y5H5KQ|1.0|While watching this movie, it seemed to me that the theme of this movie copies at least one other popular series, the Bourne series of spy thrillers. The only difference is that in this movie, the central figure (Hanna) is female. First, there is a super assassin developed as a result of a covert CIA program, then we see her kill CIA operatives. As a result, the CIA is out to kill her. Just like the Bourne movies, this also includes the appearance of an endless number of men either hired killers or in combat gear like soldiers sent to hunt her down. There is even a scene in which Hannna dives off a wharf into black waters to escape death from an assassin, just like Jason Bourne did. There is nothing original here lending to its boring progression. Cinema-wise, the movie is a knock-off. At the box office, it's a rip-off. And like the other movies of this kind, watch for the follow-on.
0743496736|1.0|Wow.  I bought this book because I know Picoult is a very popular writer & I was looking for an easy holiday read over the long weekend.  At first, I was annoyed, then irritated- and now I am angry.  I feel manipulated & that I have wasted my time, reading a book that has no substance, no character development and a confusing, unorganized writing methodology that yanks my chain.  I can't count how many times I have had to re-read a passage because I couldn't make sense of the sentence structure or the plot contrivance.  I grow weary of constant new characters with little relationship to one another.  Every single person is a cliché and poor ones at that, that don't even make sense.  A defense attorney that can't decide what to wear & throws up on the first day of her new job as a judge?  Mothers who answer poignant, searching questions from their teenaged children with \\"because I said so\\"?  A state governor who chuckles at evasive responses to interview questions and hires Alex anyway?  Come ON!  Why isn't this woman publishing her books online one at a time, is what I would like to know.  Can it really be that easy to crank out a NY Times #1 bestseller?  No research, no insight, no craftsmanship, no style.  And for me, the GIANT research hole- nearly every single school shooter EVER has been a kiddo either on or recently & abruptly withdrawn from psychotropic medication.  And I only say \\"nearly\\" in case there are any I don't know about.  Looking for answers regarding school shooters?  Take a good hard look at Big Pharma for some important clues, cause you aren't going to find them in this book- this is just a portrayal of Jodi Picoult on her way to the bank.
B002Q1YDLI|4.0|After spending days listening to Rachel's \\"poor me\\" tale in Something Borrowed (which I enjoyed despite some slow parts and the annoying narration) Darcy's point of view is surprisingly refreshing.  I'll admit I didn't know who's side to be on while reading the first one and even Something Blue leaves a lot in that moral gray area.  That's what I like in a book though...no one is quite right or quite wrong.  That is reality isn't it?  I personally sympathize with both of them throughout both of their respective tales.  If I had to pick the better book though this is definitely it.  For me it was not only an easier (less whiny) read but also the better story all around.  I love the complexities of Rachel and Darcy and wish there were more books about them.  Maybe in the future we'll get another one :o)
0439023491|5.0|I felt this addition of the Hunger Games series started a little slow, but by the second half of the book I was completely engrossed in the development of the story. Catching Fire is definitely worth reading if you liked the first book in this series! Now, on to Mockingjay...
B0000064TT|5.0|I've only heard this album, past and present. This is not allman brothers style music. Except for the gentle title song this album has a mule kick to it. I really like this album and hope you will too.
0525422943|5.0|I feel as though the first book just kind of tugged and tugged the reader along, and I nearly decided to not finish it. But since it was so short, I went along until the end.    And then this continuation comes out. Boy, am I glad I finished the first book. It's so very different than the first in almost every single way - except for the story. We still have the saga of Adam and Mia, but the timeline has advanced five years into the future. I'll admit that I've read books that have tried to execute the \\"where are they now\\" plot before now and have been always pretty disappointed with the results.    Not with this book.    I can't say what it is - maybe it's the author willing to take some risks with how the characters have evolved from the first book (so many of ones in this genre seem to shy away from it and/or avoid it like the plague), or maybe it's the general tone of leaving one's childhood behind for good. Or maybe it's trying to pinpoint the exact moment where one lost one's innocence. It could be all of these things. All I know is that it all worked wonderfully. I'd love to read another chapter in the Adam and Mia story if there is one.    (originally posted at crossposted to librarything, shelfari, and goodreads.)
B003E33RDW|5.0|I like this album better than \\"kid A\\". I may be wrong but these two albums were nominated for a grammy? Anyway, get this album if you enjoy innovative radiohead.
B001UV4XHY|1.0|If you're interested in this excellent movie, buy a different version...this one was so poorly done, so over-compressed, that characters' heads jumped around by several pixels while standing still, and faces were occasionally obscured by football-sized \\"artifacts\\" -- junk on the screen that should not have been there.  Yuck!  We'll be upgrading to one of the multi-disc versions and hoping that the compression was better done there.
B0000033K2|3.0|Obviously the music contained in this boxset is worth five starts.  On the other hand, the packaging leaves a lot to be desired; the outside of the box chips off very easily leaving you with a battle-worn looking set in no time.    I also don't like the confusing sequencing of the tracks.
B002ZG97EC|4.0|It's difficult to really pinpoint why it took so long to get around to Despicable Me. Animated films are kind of a guilty pleasure of mine mostly because nothing really compares to when an animated film brings together incredible animation, a talented voice cast, a solid storyline, and a strong sense of heart. There's just something about animated films that they're able to affect your entire spectrum of emotions when done right. It's something live action films aren't able to do as often, at least in modern day cinema. I think Steve Carell was the Kryptonite for Despicable Me though. Other than Anchorman and The 40 Year Old Virgin, I pretty much don't care for his work. I enjoy \\"The Office\\" in small doses, but Michael Scott is more annoying and overbearing than anything to me. That can pretty much go for most of Carell's work. Luckily, he seems fairly toned down in this and the odd-accented Gru is really enjoyable to watch. His repeated \\"light bulb\\" line in particular was a personal favorite. Truth be told, Despicable Me turned out to be a pleasant surprise.<br /><br />This film looks really fantastic on Blu-ray. The vibrant colors are practically brought to life in HD. A film like this must've been incredible to see in 3D in theaters. The animation is obviously the drawing factor, but the humor certainly shouldn't be overlooked. While it does get a little crude sometimes, it tends to be a bit more subtle most of the time and focuses on the silly and goofy more than anything. Gru's minions are a big selling point in the humor department. They're cute, their made up language is hilarious to listen to, and they're always getting themselves into funny situations. In fact, I'd go as far to say that the minions are probably the best part of the film.<br /><br />Back on the animation subject, Despicable Me is already very colorful but there's also a bit more to it than that. Seeing some of Gru's and Vector's inventions brought to animated life is a high point of the film. Vector's piranha and squid guns are rather simple on paper, but brilliant to watch in execution. The roller coaster scene is really well-animated, as well. It's probably as realistic as you can get to an actual roller coaster in an animated film. The flying chase between Vector and Gru after Gru steals the shrink ray is also a lot of fun. Watching those two try and one up each other always ends up being both entertaining and illustrates how spectacular the animation can truly get. But the character's facial expressions are where the animation shines the most; Agnes especially. The looks she gives along with her voice is enough to melt anyone's heart in an instant.<br /><br />Despicable Me is an overdose on adorable and overflowing with eye popping animation. Its dynamic use of lush colors and quirky characters is its surface appeal, but the film is a bit cleverer at its core. The animated adventure is worth seeing for Gru's minions alone although Agnes certainly has her moments, as well. Despicable Me could be considered a bit more cute than most other animated films, but is still incredibly entertaining and bound to be amusing for both those in their youth and the young at heart.ha and squid guns are rather simple on paper, but brilliant to watch in execution.
