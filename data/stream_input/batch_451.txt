6305161992|4.0|Showdown in Little Tokyo features some of the original Bad Boys of police movies.  <br /> <br />I admit, it's a little cheesy, but it has everything you'd expect from a movie made for a male audience: Topless girls and kung-fu fighting. There's even a scene where a samurai uses his razor sharp sword to cut people into pieces. COOL!!!
B000002IKR|4.0|I first bought the \\"Very Best of Testament\\" album, to test how does this group sounded (while having not heard one song from them!!). <br /> <br />The song I instantly liked A LOT was Burnt Offerings....which originally appeared on this \\"The Legacy\\" album.  Well....fast forward two more months, and I was finally able to buy a really cheap copy of this album/CD. <br /> <br />It is very hard for me to like right off the bat a new CD....and that is exactly what happened this time.  Some of the songs were OK, Burnt Offerings still sounded EXCELENT....but thought right away that I would play this CD just three or four more times prior to shelving it. <br /> <br />Fast forward three more weeks: I love this CD!!!  I have now been playing constantly on my car stereo for about two weeks, and I have not got tired of it.  In fact, I like now song no. 2, \\"The Haunting\\" almost as much as Burnt Offerings. <br /> <br />Now I like ALL the songs, to different degrees, of course.  And, more importantly, do not find any of the songs as cheap fillers. <br /> <br />I do not like Chuck Billy's voice that much.  Too high pitched ALL THE TIME.  The drums are ok, and in some very particular places withing some songs sound GREAT...but nothing out of this world. So, what I like the most about Testament's sound in this album is the sound of the guitars.  The sound very......DIFFERENT to all the other Thrash Metal I have heard.  Hard to explain, count on it.  But, they are very melodic, hard at the same time, expressive, and not just playing notes for the sake of playing, but playing great sounding chords. <br /> <br />I also bought the \\"The New Order\\" CD, but neither the anthology nor that one is as good as The Legacy, overall. <br /> <br />Great buy!
6305428042|5.0|I remember I saw this movie in the theatres when I was in my early 20s, alone. I noticed all the trailers on T.V. and that I love Bette that I wanted to see it.  Was I glad that I did!!! I could not wait to get it on VHS. (DVD was not even thought of) We are treated to wonderful permormance of Bette Midler and a wonderful supporting cast. Midler, Parker, and Najimy seem to have a wonderful three stooges like chimesty that will leave you rolling with laughter. It can be a wonderful movie to get the whole family ready for trick or treating as well. I watch this movie over and over again when I am feeling down and need a laugh because this move will lift your spirits (no pun). Get this DVD and watch it for a spell, then you will be under its \\"spell\\".
1591840562|5.0|This is one of finest books I have read. If you are an entreprenuer or want to be one - you *need* this book. This is the only non-fiction book that I have finished in one sitting! <br /> <br />I love Guy;s style of writing - wonderful insights packaged with humor! I have read quite a few books - this is definitely the easiest to read. Love it!
B00063F8B2|5.0|I bought this CD before I saw the movie and was very pleasantly surprised, it is a mix of original songs by Alan Silvestri and classic christmas favourites.  While seeing the movie helps you to understand the songs better, you don't need to in order to appreciate Silvestri's new songs.  With Rockin' on Top of the World sung by Steven Tyler and Josh Groban's Believe combined with songs from the movie and very famous classics that include Bing Crosby's White Christmas and songs from Frank Sinatra and Perry Como this album is great for your next holiday party or for lifting your Christmas spirit!
0812550757|5.0|While I'll admit that my first reaction to reading this book was to be less than excited, I have come around as I look at the context in which each story is told.  \\"Ender's Game\\" is an intense, action-filled story, one easy to get hooked on.  \\"Speaker for the Dead\\" takes the intellectuallism present under the action of \\"Ender's Game\\" and brings it to the spotlight.  This is an intelligent book, and equal to it's predecessor in my opinion, but focussed on a different set of ideas. <br /> <br />In this novel, Card focusses on a more introspective struggle, something that is indicative of a more mature subject and more intellectual reading experience.  In short, this isn't for those that loved \\"Ender's Game\\" because of the battle room or the fighting.  This is a psychological and sociological story, not for the action sci-fi buff that \\"Ender's Game\\" was better able to cater to.
0141439475|5.0|Though it must surely be impossible to choose the greatest horror story ever written, \\"Frankenstein\\", along with Bram Stoker's \\"Dracula\\", is certainly near the top of the list. There is so much to enjoy in this book, including some incrdibly tender and poignant excerpts regarding the death of a loved one. I need not say more-if you like horror, or are looking for a great female author, you should already have read this.
0792844890|5.0|This is one of the funniest movies ever!!  It's certainly my favorite Mel Brooks flick.  In basic plot line, the planet Spaceball, run by President Skroob (Mel Brooks in one of his best roles) is running low on their air supply.  So, Skroob's general Dark Helmet (comic great Rick Moranis) intends to kidnapp Princess Vespa (Daphne Zuniga) of nearby Planet Druidia to force the king to give over all of Druidia's air.  Space wanderer Lone Star (Bill Pullman) and his side-kick Barf (the late great John Candy) are sent to rescue the princess.  The storyline is a loose spoof of Star Wars, but every great sci-fi movie or TV show is parodied in this.  This is a laugh-out-loud, fall-off-your-chair, rolling-in-the-aisle movie.  NOT TO BE MISSED!!!
1400032717|4.0|Like many modern novels (particularly ones that win prizes, i seem to be finding) \\"The Curious Incident...\\" has a very isolated feel, all of it being told through the eyes of the main character. For these sorts of reasons, the book's rewards are very subtle and require attention. There is some great writing in here, particularly at the beginning, and it is all realistically and emotionally told, but overall a little over-rated.
B00003CXCT|5.0|Star Wars is just one of those movies that leave you with a smile in the face no matter how many times you watch them, i waited a long time to have my hands on them and i finally do it, i must say that im vey pleased with what i found in the DVD set, the video was amazing and the audio couldnt better (considering that these movies started as mono), i didnt mind the new changes, they dont affect the feeling of the movies in any way...and well the extras were just beautiful, my only problem with it it would be some minor problems with the video but ill give it 5 stars for still being one of the best sagas ever made.
B00009V7P8|5.0|Well, like everyone else that has written reviews for this cd, I came across Damien Rice by accident...I was watching the first season of the OC on DVD and there was this one song on the 17th episode that the guitar solo just blew my mind, so I rewound over and over to try and piece together anny lyical evidence I could get, and I got enough and looked for the lyrics on google, the song was cannonball and I read the lyrics, and man-o-man can this guy write some emotional lyrics, I didn't even need the beat (even tho it was stuck in my head, in a good way) to understand the density of the way this guy feels. I haven't even heard a whole song from this cd yet and I'm on my way to the store tomorrow to buy this one, form everyones reviews and the samples on amazon.com, this clearly is going to be my best buy yet.
B0002Y4T92|5.0|This DVD set attempts to capture a once-in-a-lifetime experience. I was at the Crossroads Festival both days that there were performances. Sure, there are parts I would like to see on the DVD that were cut, but obviously they could not put TWO DAYS of music on two DVDs. As some of the other reviews indicated, I too would love to see a volume 3 and 4, but highly doubt that will happen. <br /> <br />It was a grand event for a grand cause and I would not have missed it for anything. I equate some of the complaints about the DVD set (yea, the sound could be a little better, but it is still VERY GOOD quality) to some of the whining I heard while walking back to my car at the Cottonbowl that Sunday night. People had seen hour after hour after hour of amazing music performances by the top guitarists in the world and were actually whining and cursing about the \\"finale\\" being cut. I don't blame the promoters, the weather was looking quite bad. At the end of the day, you had gotten many times your money's worth and then some. <br /> <br />The DVD set is but a small snapshot of a really fantastic music event. That is all. It is like the photo you take on vacation. It is but a small window, a reminder, of a really nice event that took place and I was truly glad to be there to see it. <br /> <br />Good DVD. I was ready to buy it the second that I read that there was to be a DVD released. If you were there, the DVD is a great reminder. If you were not there, the DVD will make you wish that you had been. <br />
B00003CWTI|1.0|this movie is a hodgepodge of ridiculous religious symbolism and overwrought melodrama. intense profanity masquerades as dialogue with actors often screaming obscenities at the top of their lungs for no apparent reason. The frogs falling from the sky is stolen from an X-Files ep and the intertwining stories seem lifted from Robert Altman's MUCH superior movies. a wildly overpraised movie that will leave you with an intense headache from its length and volume as well as three hours gone from your life. avoid at all costs.

B000001F5F|5.0|Other than being a bit short, this album gives a great glimpse of the early, exciting Live U2. Most of these readings are more energetic than the studio ones(and those weren't too shabby, either:) This is arguably more fun than any of their studio albums, and not even a bad place to start with them.
0887307280|5.0|I liked this book because it uses system to create business processes.  These business processes are used to manage and operate a franchise business. <br /> <br />It focused mainly on franchises even though the same concept lends itself to other type of businesses.  So far, the e-myth, Rich Dad, Poor Dad by Robert Kiyosaki, Stop Working by Rohan Hall seem to be the best on the market.  They have similar concepts though applied differently. <br /> <br /> <br />
B000002UAX|5.0|While this is not as smooth a listening as Sgt.Pepper or even Let it Be, you have to be blown away by the sheer eclecticism here. There aren't a lot of THE very most played radio tracks by the group, i.e. not like Let it Be, All You Need is Love, Hold Your Hand, Help!, etc. This isn't the Beatles at their most \\"easy-listening\\". And there are bound to be one or two tracks you might in the future skip over. But they do so much here so well. The Beach Boys parody \\"USSR\\". The country shaggy-dog story \\"Rocky Racoon\\". The metalesque \\"Helter\\". The classic pop sound of \\"Martha\\" and \\"I Will\\". The blistering guitar of \\"Revolution\\". And it gos on. And so does the legend of this well-deserved classic, along with their many others:)
B000002ULO|5.0|A very heartfelt and moving album. I had been inclined to dismiss Mr. Mccartney's albums over the years as being sort of lightweight, but recently have been re-listening,and very much enjoying some of these albums, so I guess I was wrong! The guy is the master songwriter, and this album is excellent.
B000001E18|4.0|The experimental twin to Achtung Baby, I find Zooropa to be one of or THE most underrated U2 album, perhaps because it lacked a hit like Achtung's \\"Mysterious\\". Most of the experiments are hypnoticly interesting. This might not be an obvious or even proper starting point, but those who enjoy the more out-there parts of Achtung should enjoy this.
B00005LMWI|5.0|Kamelot &#8211; Karma <br /> <br />It&#8217;s fairly simple; if you haven&#8217;t listened to Kamelot then you are missing out on some of the best power metal today. This band mixes power, melodic, symphonic, and progressive elements seamlessly. While not sticking to the same sound of their previous effort &#8220;The Fourth Legacy&#8221;, they made what many fans consider their best album to date.  <br /> <br />Song by song review <br /> <br />1. Regalis Apertura (01:57) - Instrumental intro leading to&#8230;.. 5/10 <br /> <br />2. Forever (04:08) - One of the best songs in the album. This is an instant classic. Great vocals by Roy, great drumming, great guitar work, great bass work and the beauty of it all is how it all blends together perfectly. 10/10 <br /> <br />3. Wings of Despair (04:32) &#8211; A mid-to-fast-tempo song keeping the same momentum from the previous song. A great track. 9/10 <br /> <br />4. The Spell (04:21) &#8211; Kamelot slows it down a notch here into another great song. Khan&#8217;s vocals shine again here as well as Casey&#8217;s drumming. You&#8217;d think this song might not work too well live but it does and surprisingly well. 9/10 <br /> <br />5. Don't You Cry (04:18)  - One of the many reasons I like Kamelot is because they can do ballads without being cheesy. An emotional song about the loss of a loved one. 8.5/10 <br /> <br />6. Karma (05:13) &#8211; Te band speeds it up again for the title track and what a track it is! Another one of my favorites&#8230; So halfway through the album and still not a weak song yet! 10/10 <br /> <br />7. The Light I Shine On You (04:15) &#8211; Another favorite. Once again Khan&#8217;s vocals are great and the lead is awesome too. 9/10 <br /> <br />8. Temples of Gold (04:12) &#8211; Another ballad, another great track. No surprise, great emotion throughout and Khan shows how talented he is with emotional vocals 9/10 <br /> <br />9. Across the Highlands  (03:46) &#8211; And we speed it up again&#8230;. Another well balanced track. One of the faster songs in the album too. 8/10 <br /> <br />10. Elizabeth Part I: Mirror Mirror (04:23) &#8211; First part of the trilogy..very emotional first track 9/10 <br />11. Elizabeth Part II: Requiem For the Innocent (03:46) &#8211; Great lyrics in this one. I like how the song trilogy starts slow, in here it goes midtempo, and then the next song is fast. 9/10 <br />12. Elizabeth Part III: Fall From Grace (11:02, but actually about 4:30) THEY TRICKED US! =] While the cd says its 11:02 it&#8217;s actually about 4 minutes but it doesn&#8217;t take away from being one of the best songs in the album. I will be redundant yet again: This track is great! 10/10 <br /> <br />One of the best Kamelot albums as well as one of the best power metal albums. Kamelot shows they can play anything&#8230; fast, slow, midtempo, ballads, melodic, aggressive, epic, and progressive songs and excel in all. Intelligent lyrics, great vocals, awesome guitar playing, aggressive drumming, and grooving bass work, what more would you want in an album? I know! An album centered on Goethe&#8217;s Faust&#8230; This would be a 10/10 album if and only if they wouldn&#8217;t have released their next masterpiece&#8230; Epica.        <br /> <br />Final: 9/10 <br />
B000001FKY|4.0|While there may be a few filler cuts, the majority of this very lengthy CD reads like a greatest hits album. Mutt Lange's fingerprints are all over this as producer/writer. Contains a number of smaller hits not on \\"Vault\\", including \\"Women\\" and \\"Love and Affection\\". \\"Gods of War\\" is great anti-war album cut. Set the bar for pristine pop-metal(Even Lep couldn't match it). The \\"Thriller\\" of the genre(that is meant as a compliment). Who from the late 80s doesn't remember any of these tunes?
B000002UJQ|5.0|So many bands have been unable to move past the two big rock movements of the 90's, grunge and So-Cal punk. Just ask all the pathetic trend-metal singers who try to sound like Layne Staley, and all the power-pop bands who aren't even smart enough to properly emulate Green Day. What makes Radiohead so impressive- aside from their overwhelming talent and insight to the world around them, of course- is that every record they make seems independent of the existing music scene. OK Computer was one of the top albums of 1997: a post-apocalyptic, luddite cry for help trapped under an avalanche of easily accessible Foo Fighters, Third Eye Blind, Matchbox 20, the list goes on. OK Computer captures what 'alternative' was supposed to be about- music with substance over style, that improves with every listen. There's plenty of complexity on tracks like \\"Paranoid Android\\" and \\"Climbing Up the Walls\\", two of the record's highlights, so that you hear something new every time. Though densely layered, these songs are quintissential rock as well- check out the grungy guitar solo on Paranoid Android! These heavier tracks are offset by the simpler pop songs such as \\"No Surprises\\" and \\"Let Down\\". By making a record that demands an attention span beyond the typical listener's capability, Radiohead elevated their genre immeasurably and, frankly, set a standard that nobody but the band themselves can live up to. In a way it's a shame that no bands have tried to follow in Radiohead's footsteps, but on the other hand it's fitting that the path they blazed, they walk by themselves.
B0002Z1EG2|5.0|I LOVE THE CD AND DONT AND BOTH VERSIONS OF PARTY FOR TWO I LIKE ALOT. I LOVE EVERYTHING SHANIA TWAIN DOES.
B00004XONN|5.0|The long-awaited follow up to the band's most acclaimed work, Kid A is one of the biggest gambles in the history of rock. So many expected Radiohead to pick up the arena anthem torch previously held by U2 and Pearl Jam, and instead, they make an insidiously perfect electronica album.     The ominous hum and gibberish lyrics of \\"Everything in its Right Place\\" throw down the gauntlet in the first 30 seconds of the record: either follow us where we're going, or you'll be left behind. If you follow, you get to experience the chills of a concept piece whose concept is really unclear: is it merely an album about depression and self-hatred? Is it political? Is it about the end of the world? It's entirely open to interpretation, but one thing it isn't is simple. Radiohead as we know it today is defined by this piece, and they aren't looking back.
6305558175|4.0|I had always loved the French film THE RETURN OF MARTIN GUERRE from which SOMMERSBY finds its source.I like SOMMERSBY far better now recast in the post Civil War period with a far more romantic story expertly played by Jodie Foster and Richard Gere.This film is beautifully crafted with breathtaking cinematography and a truly delicious soundtrack to enhance the intense emotion of the heartbreaking story.Few movies make me consistently cry.That is not the case in SOMMERSBY.Foster and Gere do it everytime!Bill Pullman's supporting role is played with appropriate smarminess.A TRULY EXCELLENT FILM.
B000002BBY|5.0|Oasis, at their best, is a rock band. Check out the 'Familiar to Millions' double CD, or the 1997 album Be Here Now if you don't believe me. Regardless, the band is known better for their simplistic pop songs \\"Wonderwall\\" and \\"Don't Look Back in Anger\\", and this album delivers 10 such songs without a trace of pretentiousness. Some of the songs, like \\"Roll With It\\" and \\"She's Electric\\", come off as a little stupid, but only in contrast with the better-crafted songs on the record. \\"Hello\\" and \\"Morning Glory\\" showcase Noel Gallagher's solid guitars, and \\"Cast No Shadow\\" is a surprisingly honest and heartfelt acoustic number. <br /> <br />There isn't a lot of deep meaning on this album, but there are ten solid, if formulaic, alternapop songs.
B0002BO0AS|5.0|Unearth has come a long way from where they were at the start, this cd is amazing. Theres just something about this album and band that keeps hardcore alive. This cd is just awsome, the guitar solos and riffs are amazing. The drummer is intense and the vocals are awsome. This cd should be on the top of your most wanted hardcore list.
B00003CXA3|5.0|The acting, scenery, and gritty realism of TFC make it brilliant. But sadly the DVD (despite two discs) sports no bloopers or outtakes of the movie. Also, why couldn't Hackman and Scheider have a complete and seperate commentary each, instead of the half commentary each their given?
B00005JLEX|5.0|For some strange reason us folks in the Antipodes have been given the rare privilege of a release of these sets before the US. I haven't laughed so much in ages. This set is brilliant. Sure, they're still finding their feet in the first few episodes, but it is great from the outset. George, in particular, is hysterical. The added extras, bloopers, deleted scenes and the doco on the making of the series all make this set (which would've been great with just the episodes) outstanding value for even the most casual fan of the series. Don't hesitate - you won't regret it. If this doesn't make you laugh, you'd better get medical attention pronto!
B00065JTBA|5.0|What is initialy so striking about this set is the great packaging - and I don't mean, \\"oh, the guys are so cute (I am a hetero male),\\" I'm talking about a nifty, high-quality, vivid box and artwork, an indepth booklet with photos, reflections and explinations of the chosen tracks, where they came from and why they are previously unreleased, and the as-far-as-I-Know original idea of including numerous fan essays trying to explain to the non-believers why Bon Jovi is so much more than a has-been relic of the hair band days.  Of course, us fans know they never really were much of a hair band, that's just where they were unjustly lumped.  Furhter proof is the very existance of this boxset.  20 years, 100 million albums later (a fact the guys are not shy about promoting several times throughout the liner notes and on the DVD - but it is a stagering feet for any band, but mainly for this band who have outlasted all of their peers - There won't be a Tesla or Whitesnake boxset anytime soon) Bon Jovi seems as shocked and thankful as their fans are.      This is what a great box set should be, a celebration, a thanks, something that can be displayed with joy (they tend to stand out on the cd rack), and something a hater can pick up and, based on songs, stories and insights listed, have half a chance of finally undersatnding or respecting the band, or at least their journey and what they mean to millions.  The bonus DVD here goes a long way in aiding that cause.  It also seems like required viewing for anyone interested in becoming a musician.  Fans and future box-set planners alike should take note of this package.    Now to the songs:  FIRE INSIDE and OPEN ALL NIGHT (I'm refering to the peppier of the two tracks with this same title) are two of the best Bon Jovi ballads ever!  Both rather typical lyricaly, but FIRE has a curious underlying throb and stripped down quality to it and the emotion isn't as sappy as many of Bon Jovi's worst, overbaked ballads.  OPEN is breezy funand just sounds great.  This could have been an ALWAYS-size hit.  They both have a natural, refreshing and very real energy.  While we're on better-than-average ballads, SATELLITE is almost as good as these, too.    LONELY AT THE TOP was written as a letter to Kurt Cobain's daughter following his suicide, which sounds like a gimick, but it could be written for anyone and the emotion is very real.  It is touching and also says a lot for Bon Jovi seeing as how all of their hair-band-peers in the 80's generally blame Nirvana and their leadership of the grunge revolution for destroying their careers.  This seems even more remarkable considering it was written before it was clear if Bon Jovi would survive this or suffer a similar fate; so kudos for the boys doing this song for Kurt, his family and any one who is going through a similar plight.    Other songs, feel like the leftovers they are, but for die hard fans of any artist this is the stuff you kill for on e-bay, collecting in bits and pieces, between actual album releases.  There are moments of funny studio activity peppered throughout and some songs like Garageland, Rich Man Living In a Poor Man's House, Sympathy, Only In My Dreams (with Tico on vocals), Flesh and Bone, and Last Man Standing (taken off This Left Feels Right, but will be on the new album next year, which Jon says \\"Kicks!\\") are all top notch.  Disc 2 and 3 stand out, but like most multi-disc non-hit sets its a hit or miss grab-bag throughout.  My advice; take a listen, find your favorites and burn them onto your own one or two disc set.  At worst, as is usually the case with Bon Jovi, some songs are pretty uninspired.  Most fans can admit they lift not only from other artists, but often from themselves (example, I hope they are paying CCR royalties for \\"Shut Up and Kiss Me,\\" and how many times has Jon said something like, \\"take a look in these eyes,\\" or \\"I've paid the cost.\\"), but as with all Bon Jovi records the good far outweighs the lame.    There are no hits, which is fine, but I do think Bon Jovi needs to update \\"Cross Road\\" and give us a 2 or 3 disc career hits retrospective.  But for what this collection is, it is impressive, a great way to say thanks, and an attractive addition to the library.
B00003CXTG|2.0|Apart from excellent scenes of the Japanese attack on drunk American pilots and sailors, this film is worthless.
140004281X|5.0|Alice Munro's newest collection of short stories is about time, how small events change lives, and how different those events look as time passes. Several of the stories span the lifetimes of the characters, focusing on one event that changes things forever.  <br />Take \\"Chance,\\" \\"Soon\\" and \\"Silence,\\" a trio of stories about Juliet, a young woman whose choices about who to speak to on a train change her life forever. Munro masterfully picks three incidents, the train ride, a visit home, and a search for a daughter, and through them tells the story of Juliet's life. I found it sad to see how the great passion of the first story ends in an accident by the third. Or \\"Tricks,\\" perhaps the most painful story in the collection. The story opens with Robin saying the most banal thing one could imagine, \\"I'll die if that dress isn't ready.\\" Then we learn why, and when Munro repeats the line again we see it's fraught with meaning. We learn of a chance meeting that offers a promise that's snatched away a year later; only at the end of her life does Robin learn what really happened.  <br />Suicides, lost souls and disappointments thread through these stories. Munro's world is a lost and lonely place, and be forewarned--none of these stories promises a happy ending. But they're beautifully written and struck a chord--don't we all recall brief, seemingly trivial moments years later and wonder what if?
0671510991|5.0|If I could give Kissinger's Diplomacy 10 stars, I certainly would. This book is extremely well written. I was amazed at how well Henry Kissinger explained 300 years of Western history and diplomacy. Because the book is so well written, I would recommend it to folks interested in history, political science, international relations, or for just interesting reading of a good book.<br /><br />I found the early chapter on Woodrow Wilson's approach to American exceptionalism, which included our native idealism, collaborative successes, and mutual security and multilateral action in international affairs to be very insightful and Kissinger returns to these concepts again and again in his analysis of statescraft. Likewise in this early chapter he contrasts Wilson to Theodore Roosevelt's philosophy of action only with clear national interests in mind, a world of realpolitik.  He also explains balance of power approaches and adequately demonstrated the barriers, benefits, consequences, and downside of each of these approaches. After reading this 800 page book, I am ready to sit down and start reading again.  It is really that good.<br /><br />There are numerous highlights but I will share a few with you.<br /><br />His chapter on Richelieu and Louis XIV demonstrated how Richelieu created the first modern state to emerge from the Middle Ages. Richelieu acted to consolidate power for the French king which ran counter to the mind set of the Middle Ages. Unfortunatley, as Kissinger demonstrates, Louis XIV squanders this power with needless wars, for which his relative Louis XVI paid the ultimate price.<br /><br />One section of the book, regarding the Concert of Europe after the fall of Napoleon, reveals statescraft at the heights. Metternich and Talleyrand helped create a peace that lasted over 100 years based on realistic balance of power and alliances based on common values.<br /><br />The development of the German state under the power of Bismark compared to the downfall of France under Napoleon III was very interesting. Unfortunately the power of the new German state was misused in World War I.<br /><br />The sections on World War I demonstrated the pattern by which military decisions and preparedness outweigh and preceed correcting diplomacy. In this section Kissinger and Tuchman offer a common view of the origins of World War I.<br /><br />Kissinger and Tuchman however diverge when it comes to Vietnam. Tuckman's short crisp summary of the tragedy of Vietnam in her book The March of Folley is a very good summary, but Kissinger's chapters on Vietnam in Diplomacy certainly put meat on the bones of fact.<br /><br />Finally Kissinger's analysis of his years working with Richard Nixon were real eye-openers. Richard Nixon undoubtedly had considerable gifts in the area of foreign policy which makes the tragedy of Watergate even more sad.<br /><br />I just do not think anyone with half a brain would be dissatisfied with this excellent book.the downfall of France under Napoleon III was very interesting.

Richard Nixon undoubtedly had considerable gifts in the area of foreign policy which makes the tragedy of Watergate even more sad. <br /> <br />I just do not think anyone with half a brain would be dissatisfied with this excellent book.
0061020680|3.0|<br />Mort has been my second excursion into Discworld after The Truth. And though the earlier book is certainly simpler and more innocent (ie less \\"knowing\\"/intertextual/inbred) than The Truth and (I suspect) many of the later novels in the series, it largely holds its own. The concept is irresistible. Mort is a likeable protagonist. Death is just cool. There are plenty of rib-tickling scenes (Death's careers' advice interview is a cracker), the action is swift and engrossing and the ending is full of pathos (a good thing). In fact, as with The Truth, I am mighty impressed by the way Pratchett wraps up his story. That, as any writer, and most readers are well aware, is an often impossibly difficult skill to master. Some of the best writers around - and some of my favourites - fail at this last hurdle.  <br />My biggest gripe with the book is that some of the language used and references feel a little dated now. But that's like carping at the datedness of Wodehouse or Dickens! (ie not a particularly illuminating gripe). Sure, Mort feels a little flimsy and I get the sense that Pratchett at the time of writing was still in the process of exploring the possibilities of Discworld. In other words, it seems a trifle unsophisticated and less fully realized than The Truth (and, presumably, the later novels), much in the same way as The Hobbit introduces a wonderful mythology and characters while merely hinting at the greatness to come. Essential reading, no doubt, but I'm pretty certain it'll be a while before I come across that bona fide 5-star classic that I just know Pratchett either has already written or is bound to write in future. Unfortunately, every single Pratchett book seems to have its champions on Amazon who proclaim it to be the best of the series. And every single one of them also has its detractors who decry its inadequacies. It's quite infuriating! Anyway, enough babbling, I've got Soul Music and Maskerade to plough through! (I've taken to reading at least two Pratchetts (or more) in tandem to save my sanity and so that I don't miss out on the delights of one Discworld sub-genre while I'm exploring another!) <br />
B00004ZAV3|5.0|I happend to purchase this CD not being a hardcore fan of the Beatles. Though, these are tunes that can bridge the gap between several generations of music lovers. For the price, it is definately well worth it!
B000002G9S|5.0|This version comes from the original 8 track recording, just like the original European version. Later on the English version has been transformed to 16 tracks and some? alternations have been made to satify the European record company. The new USA version with the bonus tracks is the same as the new European version with bonus tracks.
B0002Z1EG2|5.0|Shania always gives her fans the best.  She has done just that with this cd.  It is all of our here best songs on this cd plus three more that will reach #1 no doubt.  She is awesome.  Please keed giving us just this the BEST!!!!!!!!!!
B00005JNBQ|5.0|Best comedy of 2004!  This will be a cult classic! Jon Heder is brilliant!  The quotes from this movie will live forever...
B0002XH9Z4|5.0|This collection spans from 69' to 2004. It includes the new anti-war song \\"We've Had Enough\\". The song sings off of its haunting lyrics. Other new songs include \\"The Way You Love Me\\". There is much in this great collection. Demos and never before released songs. Fall Again is a ballad promoted by Vh1 last week. On The Line was on the soundtrack for \\"Get On The Bus\\". Other favorites include In The Back, a demo for in Invincible album as well as Monkey Business, which may be one of the greatest rock songs with a great guitar rift. Notice how I talk about the new offers on this great box set.  <br /> <br />To a response to one reviewer below, he says that Mr. JAckson's fan base is dwindling?! How would he know if he therefore hadn't been part of that fan base currently. Actually, this album is a treat to any MJ fan, no matter the size (those the size is growing).  <br /> <br />Michael Jackson is known as the legend, and biggest selling artist of all time. The last thing he needs is \\"haters\\" bashing his treat to his true fans that stick by him through thick and thin. 100% innocent!
B00005OMTT|5.0|If you like Enigma, this CD gives you a nice (the best perhaps) collection of Enigma's songs. I got it as gift and it became my number one Enigma CD!
B00028HBKM|4.0|Strong cast; authentic feel, both linguistically and culturally; backed by a reflective and very moody soundtrack -- THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST is probably the most powerful - and gruesome - cinematic depiction of the obedient sacrifice of Jesus for the sins of Israel and the world. Gibson has done a fine, if imperfect, job of reimagining the final hours of Christ's life.    The picture opens in the Garden of Gethsemane with Yeshua/Jesus (Jim Caviezel) praying, agonizing before the Father about what must happen next. A detachment of soldiers - led by Judas son of Simon Iscariot - arrives to arrest Jesus. The party then brings him before Annas and Caiaphas, some of the Sanhedrin, and finally Pilate who, following a very bloody scourging, gives in and hands him over to be crucified. (I especially appreciate the attempt to represent Pilate's own situation.) Jesus, mocked by many and abandoned by even his closest followers, forgives his executioners - a unique response to one's torturers when compared to the responses found in certain intertestamental martyrological texts, such as 2 Maccabees 7 and 4 Maccabees 9-12. The film makes interesting spiritual connections, periodically showing Satan to be tempting Jesus to \\"call it off\\" (even though I think the Gospels suggest demonic forces may have been trying to get Jesus killed - e.g. Luke 22:53; John 13:27-30). Following death, Jesus is lowered from the cross and prepared for burial, which process is not shown. Less than one minute of screen time is devoted to the Resurrection - the movie's final scene - in which the stone rolls away, the linen cloths sink to a formless pile, and a very-much-alive Jesus stands and strides out of the tomb.    Mr. Gibson has made a bold statement of personal faith - faith not in some societal cause or abstract ideology, but in an individual of the historic past. A statement made despite often enormous unpopularity. Agree with his religious views or not, Mel Gibson is a man of great personalconviction and courage.   I do think, the more attention one pays to THE PASSION's characters and their actions, the more clear it becomes that Gibson does not paint the Jewish people with a single brush. There is at least some variety in behavior on the part of the Jews and even the Romans. (It is also worth noting that most people who grow up \\"in the church\\" understand that someone professing similar faith who wants to 'tell the story' on film does so NOT because he/she is anti-Semitic, but because he/she wants to be true to those biblical accounts.) On that note, I would have tried to cast more Middle-Eastern-looking persons for the role of Jesus and perhaps other Jews, to give it an even greater measure of authenticity.    I would also have liked to see something in the way of special features on the DVD: the Making of the Passion, theatrical trailers, and the like (in fairness, however, Gibson may not have had the budget for all of that).    For what it is, the movie serves as an intelligent and unapologetic portrayal with solid performances all around, especially by Caviezel. And ultimately, for the Christian, the tale of Yeshua's suffering and subsequent glorification - and all they involve - remains the most worthy-to-be-told story of this era ... and this film one of the most culturally and cross-culturally potent tools for evangelism I have ever seen or heard about.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|I know that a lot of you theatre buffs out there don't have any patience for Stephen Schwartz, dubbing him a \\"lightweight\\" and not a memorable composer at all.  That may be true, but forget it all and buy Wicked.  Idina simply deserves a chance, and Kristin...well, what can I say?  This is a show made by the performers, and it does actually have a strong score to back it.  Read a synopsis of the musical and the book, and listen to \\"Defying Gravity\\" before you listen to the rest of the CD.  People, give this a chance.  It IS Broadway.  And you'll feel kinship to Idina if you're a belter like I am. ;)
B000002GVO|5.0|It's a great album to listen to while driving, but it's also an album you revisit as you get older for different reasons, stuff that you find in there that you didn't hear before or didn't really notice. And that is a big reason why it endures as well as it does.  <br /> <br />If you are just starting to like \\"classic rock\\" or modern country music, this should be one of the first ones to get. \\"Desperado\\", \\"On The Border\\" and \\"Eagles Live\\" being the next.   <br /> <br />I stopped listening to this one a while back only because I grew tired of hearing the title track on the radio, and eventually over time, I gave in and gave it a listen, as if I never heard it before. So while it's still \\"brand new\\" and before I overplay it, here's my rundown on the songs.   <br /> <br />\\"Hotel California\\". One of the great road songs and rock solos. It's a song that's taking you on a journey into this bizarre world. If you've seen a Fellini film, you see where Don Henley's head is at here. Lots of word play going on (\\"she got the Mercedes Bends\\" for one) and ends off in a guitar duel between Don Felder and Joe Walsh. The only down side is that someone will sing this in a karaoke bar.  <br />  <br />\\"New Kid In Town\\". Glenn Frey's only lead vocal on the whole thing, but still proved to be a big hit for the band. Has the \\"Peaceful Easy Feeling\\", \\"Lyin Eyes\\" vibe to it, a song about hitting the big time.  <br /> <br />\\"Life in the Fast Lane\\". Henley's in the back seat playing the observer to the young and out of control couple fighting, ready to crash and burn. You could put just about any tabloid couple in the music video in your head on this one. Classic guitar solo, an introduction to the (then) new Eagle Joe Walsh.  <br /> <br />\\"Wasted Time\\". Don does ballads like no other. Raspy voiced yet hits the high notes with no problem... just beautiful, the \\"reprise\\" was kind of unnecessary, but not a big deal. Might have made more sense for the album.  <br /> <br />\\"Victim of Love\\". To me,it sounds like something that could have been on \\"On The Border\\" or \\"One of These Nights\\" or \\"The Long Run\\" with no problem and fits in snugly here. To me, this has all the elements of a classic Eagles song. Harmonies, melodies, solos.   <br /> <br />\\"Pretty Maids All in a Row\\". This one I've come to like more recently, and since watching \\"Hell Freezes Over\\". It's something that stands apart from Joe Walsh's other songs with James Gang and solo (DO get James Gang, \\"Barnstorm\\" and his 70s era solo CDs). His unique voice singing over the Eagle's harmonies makes the song even more touching.  <br /> <br />\\"Try And Love Again\\". Randy Meisner's last recording with the guys before he left, having already severed ties with Bernie Leadon by then. Which is unfortunate considering their huge success with \\"Take It To The Limit\\" with Meisner singing. It's a nice song that he left them with..   <br />     <br />\\"The Last Resort\\". The \\"album\\" has taken you on a journey and ends up here. It's just a beautiful song from beginning to end, beautifully written, beautifully sung, one that could be written in 2004 and be relevant, and to me this is the crown jewel of \\"Hotel California\\". If I could pick one song that is my favorite on here, it's this one, and it's the one that I listened to the least off of here before. It's one you have to give it time to grow on you though. <br /> <br />Overall, it's a very satisfying album that is in a category all it's own, that takes you on a journey and one that you'll come back to time and time again. Sure, some of the songs have been overplayed to death, but it's still a group of songs that have held up well and will continue to do so.  <br />
B00005JMXX|4.0|Basically, this movie is a LOVE IT or HATE IT kinda film.   <br /> <br />First of all, take it for what it is.  A fun movie.  It's eye candy and it DOES keep you watching.  Even a gun-happy Republican has to admit that this movie, upon first viewing, keeps your attention. <br /> <br />Secondly, you're a fool if you go in and expect a sci-fi disaster film to be believable.  Like Independence Day, Armageddon, and all the other modern effects-driven disaster machines, this movie takes a concept and pushes it overboard. <br /> <br />But the FACT is, global warming is REAL.  If it is not dealt with, we, as humans, will pay for what we've managed to screw up in less than a century.  That's a fact, folks.  I'm twenty-one and I may see some of it in my lifetime.   <br /> <br />Okay, I'm through.  <br /> <br />Don't believe the speficics of this movie.  Just believe the concept.  Use common sense. <br /> <br />And go enjoy the eye-candy.  Lighten up and have fun, and QUIT giving movies a one-star rating you know good and well you enjoyed.
B000669GAI|5.0|First off, every single Pearl Jam album is packed full of wonderful, amazing music.  Therefore, there can be no exception here.  As a hardcore Pearl Jam fan, it is certain that I have some favorites that weren't \\"hits\\" by Epic's standards, but I don't really feel disappointed that they were left off; after all, the true fans can keep \\"Porch\\", \\"Indifference\\", \\"Whipping\\", \\"Lukin\\", \\"Low Light\\", \\"Gods Dice\\", and \\"All or None\\" (as well as so, so many freakin' others) to ourselves.  Besides, any upright Pearl Jam fan will own their favorites already and won't necessarily need this album.  However, from a collector's standpoint, it's still a must have.  This album also appeals to the not-so-hardcore fans in that it offers basically only what radio stations play or might have played at one time; no outlandish surprises here.  <br /> <br />Any which way you look at it though, \\"Rearviewmirror\\" is no less than Pearl Jam at its most exceptional.  No let down here.
B00005Y7PS|2.0|Once again a mediocre Black Sabbath album with the faceless Tony Martin filling in because Tony Iommi can't get Dio, Gillan, or some other famous name to sing on the record. This album isn't necessarily bad (like \\"Forbidden\\"), its just so mediocre that its painful. If anything good can be said of this record it is \\"Feels good to me\\". The solo is quite memorable, and distinctly Tony Iommi, although the lyrics are so pedestrian that any 13 year old could have written them. The odd thing about this song is that it doesn't fit in with the rest of the record. After all these years I am still trying to figure out if this is supposed to be some kind of concept record. One minute Martin is singing about the siege of Tyr and the next minute he  is up in Norway. If the record was supposed to have a point it could have been consistent. The other disappointing thing about this record is never once does Tony Iommi dish out memorable and heavy riffs. With the exception of \\"Cross Purposes\\" it seems like every time he gets Tony Martin he is inspired to write boring forgettable songs. If you simply must have every Black Sabbath record than my advice is don't spend more than $3 on this thing.
0553266306|5.0|this book is in no way outdated or old.  The swift moving plot, the realistic police methods, the interesting characters, all make for a complete story which never lets you get away - you're hooked from the first page.  Much of the story, like many of Frederick Forsyth's books, depend mostly on the characters, how they think, what actions they take or fail to take.  This story does not rely on advanced computer systems, super weapons or sinister plots carried out by ex-Nazis from underground bases in South America.<br /><br />In other words, a good story no matter when you read it.
B00005Q4CS|5.0|I just watched this movie about a half hour ago.  I found this to be the most moving and thought provoking movie I have ever seen.  Aronosky proved to be a brilliant director once again.  This movie has changed my entire view on people like that portrayed in the movie and it is a definite watch for whoever is willing to sit through it.  Definitely not for the weak stomached. <br />Also, I saw the NC-17 version so I don't know what was cut out of that to make it R.
B00068IOWM|5.0|Another u2 Masterpiece? Could very well be. It might not be at the level of \\"Joshua Tree\\" or \\"Achtung Baby,\\" but its an extremely strong album with no weak tracks, unlike its predecessor ATYCLB.  The 2000 album was very strong, but a couple mistakes made it one step away from a \\"masterpiece\\" which a lot of people said it was. However, I found that this album takes a few listens to grow on you and really appreciate.  This will explain why a lot of people will give it 1-2 stars after a couple listens, or of course those u2 haters that haven't even heard the album.  This album has so many different sounds coming from everywhere (layers of guitars, great double & backing vocals, heavy bass, etc.) This album is another reason why they will be inducted into the Rock n Roll hall of fame in 2005, first ballot. <br /> <br />1. Vertigo: excellent first single and great opener for the album. U2 just doing an exciting track, loaded with great guitars by Edge and heavy bass by Adam Clayton. Hit written all over it. I could have done without the \\"turn it up loud, captain\\" line, but in the end it's just a fun song (9/10). <br /> <br />2. Miracle Drug: Almost perfection in every aspect. The first verse is slow, with stunning vocal delievery by Bono, but then jumps at you when the chorus hits. The highlights of the track are done by Edge, who does a phenomenal slide guitar solo, and then sings the following verse by himself. Chills...Incredible song (9.5/10). <br /> <br />3. Sometimes You Can't Make it On Your Own: I think this is one of the most emotional songs u2 have ever recorded, very confessional lyrics.  The \\"and it's you when I look in the mirror..\\" line sung in falsetto is breaktaking, the chorus is undeniable, and the understated, brilliant guitar work underneath it is perfect. I think the bridge might be a little overdone, but this is a big future single. (9/10) <br /> <br />4. Love and Peace or Else: Is this u2? Who said this album didn't have the usual experimentation?This track has masterful production as u2 do their best Nine-inch Nail impersonation.  Simply stated, this song rocks! And to tell you the truth, it had to with Bono serving the only political lyrics on the album.  Supersonic, dark, evil, distorted riffs from Edge throughout, and great solo to close off the song. A couple corny lines bring the grade down a little (8/10). <br /> <br />5. City of Blinding Lights: Epic u2. Beautiful build-up with the piano and guitar start this very 80s-sounding tune.  I think Bono owns this track, great lyrics and delivery, and an addicitve chorus which will be a big hit on the next tour. \\"Time won't leave me as I am, but time won't take the boy out of this man\\". How can I hate on a song with a line like this in it? (8.5/10) <br /> <br />6. All Because of You: The best song on the album. The intro  makes me want to cry it's so good, the Edge let loose and running wild! It's just a stomping, sing-along rocker with Bono yelling and bouncing you off the walls. It's like the Who made a cameo on the record, very 60's rock here. The way Bono yells the bridge (\\"I'm alive, I'm being born..\\") is one of his greatest moments, and Edge's guitar solo is one of his finest(11/10)!!! <br /> <br />7. A Man and a Woman: Now is when the album will require multiple listens.  This tune is the epitome of SOUL, people will think it's too R&B but that was the goal of this track.  Bono wanted to make \\"a summer Marvin Gaye\\" tune, and listening to this makes me wonder if they were signed to Motown all these years.  The dominator: Adam Clayton. Incredible bass completes this sing-a-long tune that grows on you more and more (8/10). <br /> <br />8. Crumbs from Your Table: Biggest surprise of the record, it is pretty brilliant. Edge swallows the track and dominates it with his guitar work. Bono's delivery makes this chorus amazing, very catchy..the lyrics are very strong, especially the second verse. Very nice surprise, a lot rawer and harder than I expected (8.5/10). <br /> <br />9. One Step Closer: People say it's the weakest track on the record but I can't understand that.  It has such incredible vocal delivery by Bono and fits the music and theme of the song to perfection.  It really would have been a good fit on \\"Zooropa\\".  The Lyrics are just genius to me, and maybe they could have done something more with the chorus, but it has this wierd feeling which grows on you.  Took many listens to feel all this, keep in mind (8/10). <br /> <br />10. Original of the Species = Although I absolutely love this song, I have the most trouble with it because of what it could have been.  First off, this the closest anyone has ever come to sounding like the Beatles.  It is incredible, great piano and its place on the album is perfect. My problem is the over-production, what a mistake! There is too many things going on here, especially the strings.  It should have been more stripped down, it would be far more intimate.  And get rid of the \\"doo doo doo\\" line by Bono, ugghhh (7.5/10). <br /> <br />11. Yahweh: Despite the wierd-sounding title of the song, this has geniunely great lyrics and ends the album very well.  The chorus is a little annoying, but the last half of this track is perfect. One of their stronger album closers, but definetly a grower (7/10). <br /> <br />Here's a statement of how strong this record is: the only real mistake was not adding \\"Fast Cars\\" to the regular edition! It is pure brilliance, u2 at their most experimental.  It is a middle-eastern influenced tune with Arabic guitars by Edge and hip hop style vocals by Bono.  What a gem, they left it off the album and I could see it being a single.  \\"I know these fast cars...will do me no good.\\"  One of the best on the album. <br /> <br />u2 arent changing music history here.  I don't know why some u2 fans want them to do this with every release.  It is just a very strong rock record filled with songs I can't wait to hear live.  Because as good as their album work is, their songs come alive on tour.  A new masterpiece? Only time will tell, but it takes time and multiple listens to really fall in love and appreciate this great record.   <br />
B00006LPER|1.0|That movie was soooo boring. An old teacher living together with her mum, whom she hates, very blunt loud dialogues between them, why does an independent self supporting lady stay there at all, ridiculous.. <br />I was very, very disappointed of actress Huppert's role, it was not her fault, that she had so little to do or say, eg in that scene on the public toilet. <br />E. Jelinek's story was either not transported or is it really so far away from real life, or sex, or even perverse perversion?  <br />I did not even try to find out, too much time spent on that already. Sorry.  <br />
B000089RVX|5.0|I have been a rocker for over 30 years. I have always loved powerful, emotional, and moving music. However, I have never heard anything like this album. I came across it by accident when previewing some music in a music store. And, to put it bluntly, I cannot stop listening to it. It is my favorite album, from amongst 1000's, hands down.<br /><br />Amy Lee's voice is beyond words, simply incredible. I cannot wait for future releases!!!
B0000020C4|2.0|I have been buying from amazon for years and I have never felt so compelled as to write in, until now.  <br /> <br />For everyone out there critisizing the actress who plays Eponine in the original broadway cast recording, may i just ask, to what standard are you holding her? Everyone is complaining that she has a shrill and whining voice, but wouldnt this be logical since she is portraying a poor, beaten down and immature young girl? i think Frances' somber, heartfelt and yearning take fits quite nicely in contrast to the over enunciated, much too happy and almost laughable (actually, very laughable. as soon as i heard it i yelled out loud and then broke out in laughter) rendition by this 10th anniversary company actress.  <br /> <br />i have seen les mis quite a few times off broadway and very recently infact, and in every experience i have had, eponine's tone always resembled that of in the original broadway cast. come to think of it now, but the entire cast takes too much liberty in improvisation and doesnt seem to want to respect whats written in the music. and i have played for this musical, so i know whats written. if its good enough for the composers, it's good enough for you [the actors]. <br /> <br />anyway, i guess i was just upset to have been presented with this version because On My Own is one of my all time favorite songs out of any genre, and this recording just didnt cut it. i will give this edition props though on orchestration. sometimes the broadway recording was lacking, depending on synthesizers much too often. but then again, less orchestration puts more focus on the singing, and thats what i want from les mis....ok but nevermind, thats a whole different story. i guess when it comes down to it, if you want to hear how les mis should truely sound, stick with the original broadway cast recording.
B00004RFFI|4.0|Earning more than $241-Million at the U.S. box office (and just shy of half-a-billion bucks worldwide), &#34;Twister&#34; was certainly a blockbuster hit after premiering in theaters on May 10, 1996.<br /><br />I've been fond of this movie since seeing it for the first time on VHS. This DVD version tops the horrid Full-Frame VHS copy by a mile.<br /><br />Sure, this film is a bit overdone in many places, I suppose. And there are enough contrivances to fill up a football stadium -- but it's still a lot of fun to watch nonetheless.<br /><br />Many people have praised the tornado special effects in &#34;Twister&#34;. But, in my opinion, I found most of the CGI tornado footage in the film to look a tad bit on the &#34;phony&#34; side. I think some of these tornadoes look a little &#34;too perfect&#34; to be &#34;real&#34; looking.  The majority of twisters I've seen in pictures and on video haven't really looked like these so-called &#34;real&#34; storms we see in this motion picture. The movie's twisters, while impressive and imposing, just don't look quite &#34;right&#34; if you ask me.<br /><br />In addition, I found some of the sound effects during the tornado scenes to be a bit odd. The filmmakers have seemingly added some unusual-sounding noises to these windstorms. Since when do twisters emanate &#34;groaning&#34; noises? I've always heard that an approaching tornado sounds just like a freight train. I don't think there's any &#34;freight train&#34; sounds in this whole movie. The movie's storms seem to like to groan and whine; almost as if the filmmakers were attempting to make the tornadoes seem like &#34;living creatures&#34;. Most curious, IMO. But, oh well... :)<br /><br />The flying cows and flying tractors are probably a bit on the exaggerated side as well, but it's all in good fun -- and nobody gets hurt by the orbiting moo cows, etc., thanks to Bill Paxton's expert skills of driving directly through the center of an F4 or F5 monster tornado -- a handy skill to have in this film.<br /><br />Plus: the &#34;flying cow&#34; scene is redeemed by Bill's funny line of dialogue after being warned by Jo (Helen Hunt) of a SECOND flying moo cow in the vicinity -- &#34;Actually, I think that was the same one.&#34; (LOL!)<br /><br />Besides the massive amounts of really windy weather that we experience in the movie, another of the main reasons this motion picture appeals to me (and remains highly re-watchable) is the sheer likeability of the film's characters. The main stars of the film (Helen Hunt, Bill Paxton) perform their tasks fairly well, but it's the secondary (supporting) characters that I really found the most engaging in &#34;Twister&#34; -- such as Jami Gertz, who plays the new woman in Paxton's life. In addition to Gertz, I really like each of the characters that make up the tornado &#34;chase team&#34;, including Alan Ruck (&#34;Rabbit&#34;) and Philip Seymour Hoffman (&#34;Dusty&#34;).<br /><br />The actors that were employed to represent the team of storm-chasers here seem to me to be 'just right'. That guy &#34;Dusty&#34;, in fact, looks perfect for his part. He's totally believable, IMO, as the kind of sloppy-looking, off-the-wall guy who does nothing but chase funnel clouds across the landscape. He gets in a few good zingers of dialogue during the film, too.<br /><br />This Warner Brothers' single-disc DVD of &#34;Twister&#34; delivers the goods very nicely. The disc contains a good-looking Anamorphic 2.35:1 Widescreen print and three different 5.1 Surround soundtracks (a DTS track, along with English 5.1 Dolby Digital and French 5.1 DD).<br /><br />This movie is well-suited, I think, for the really-wide &#34;scope&#34; aspect ratio we get here (2.35:1). A nice-quality video transfer makes the movie shine on this DVD.<br /><br />The DVD has some bonuses worth checking out as well. ..... There's a 2-person Audio Commentary Track, which includes participation by the film's Director (Jan de Bont).

B0002Z1EG2|5.0|I would have to say this CD is a must buy, especially for shania fans. I have always loved Shania's CDs.. then when i heard she was coming out with a review i thought to myself \\"ah! all her great songs in one package!\\" All the songs just make me want to get up and dance!
1400032717|5.0|Smart, funny story in a strange kind of way. I stepped inside this kids head and felt his frustration. Oddly enough, it makes me feel more comfortable with challenged children and their needs. Could not put it down.
0156421178|4.0|What I enjoyed most about this book was that Orwell pointed out that in times of war - where news and descriptions of events are usually reported with great amounts of partisan spin - the only \\"real\\" truth that one can know is what one sees with his own eyes.  <br /> <br />I enjoyed his scientific observations of being in battle and the political manifestations of war. What I disliked about this book was trying to keep track of the many different acronyms which made up the different parties in Spain, having no a priori knowledge of these parties or their political differences.  <br /> <br />I think our embedded journalists in Iraq could use a lesson from Orwell's humanistic approach to war-reporting.  <br /> <br />All in all, I think this is a great book.
B00000J7JO|5.0|an edgy and rockin' album that captures an electrifying band with renewed vigor, stamina and riding the crest of one amazing burst of creative energy. This one has stronger doses of punk and metal to infuse fresh blood into the always delightful funk stew.<br /><br />Like the title suggests, the entire album is a microcosm or biopsy of the California experience bottled for your nervous system pleasure.
B00007KWHP|5.0|Oh how good it is--even after all these years. These guys were so damm good it's sick. How can musicians be that young and put out an album like this? It was so far above what anyone else was doing at the time, and frankly that still holds true to this day. In fact (to my mind) even they themselves never did better. If I were hearing this today for the first time I would still be blown away--in other words it holds up..unlike many of the imitators it spawned. You just can't go wrong with this CD. And by the way it's better to listen to it from start to finish as opposed to hearing a few of these gems plucked out and stuck into a best-of CD. The extra tracks I could take or leave. Cheers Kidos!!
B00027JYLC|4.0|While this an interesting and highly original film, it is NOT the greastest movie ever made, as some of the other reviews here would lead you to believe.  Not surprisingly, due to the lack of cinematic experience by much of the cast, most of the performances are amateurish and difficult to watch.  The story also makes the fatal error of taking it's supremely sympathetic characters and turning them into extremely unsympathetic ones by the films end.<br /><br />  It is, however, a very disturbing film to watch, in an almost voyeuristic sense.  Ultimately, it IS a must-see for real cinema buffs.<br /><br />  This particular DVD's picture quality is fair, but the audio is quite awful, which is of course not Tod Browning's fault, as the bulk of the rest of the films shortcomings are.
B00005JMAH|2.0|I have read 1-5 of the books and found Sorcerers Stone & Chamber of Secrets films had captured the magic of HP.  However, I cannot say the same for Prisoner of Azkaban.  I took my 2 1/2 year old 2x to see this film and he loves it as he loves the other ones, however I found it chopped up, with no flow.  If you had not read the books, you'd be totally lost, no mention of the time manipulator that Hermoine uses etc.  However the Dementors & the Hippogriff effects where just as I pictured.  I hope they will reconsider Christopher Columbus for future HP projects.
B000003N8R|5.0|I love a lot of Coltrane.  I put Crescent on a par with his greatest Albums, including Giant Steps, A Love Supreme, and Expression.  The title track has such a pain to it as if he was aware of his death on the horizon; Wise One has a beautiful form and a nobility that also is unique.  In their form, I think both of this pieces are original and unique in their own way as is what came later.  In spirit I think they forshadow Expression.
B00005JKES|5.0|I remember my first sense of delicious anticipation when I heard back in 1990 that David Lynch was producing a pilot murder mystery for ABC with prospects at least for a limited series.  At the time all I knew of Lynch was based on having seen \\"The Elephant Man\\" and \\"Blue Velvet.\\"  Yet that scant exposure to his eclectic artistic temperament was enough to signal me that television as I knew it was about to be forever changed.  That finally a person of enormous talent would actually consider the small screen worthy of something approaching real vision.  Little did I know...<br /><br />Now almost fifteen years later I look back at the subsequent TV shows that have impacted my life and my thinking and realize that without \\"Twin Peaks\\" they might never have been given an audience: \\"Northern Exposure\\" for one and certainly \\"The X-Files.\\"  And perhaps others that don't immediately spring to mind.<br /><br />But in returning to the DVD release of these initial episodes I remind myself that for an all-too-brief sliver of privileged time I was once witness to the creation of something truly unique.  And to my surprise, what was unique then seems even fresher and crisper today.  No longer am I caught up in the surface mystery of \\"who killed Laura Palmer?\\"  Instead I am immersed in the intricate layers of character development that suggest what might have been for this short-lived series but also underscore what most truly WAS for the brief time it was on the air.<br /><br />I agree with those who regret the absence of the pilot episode but will patiently await its inevitable release.  Nonetheless, the lack of the pilot certainly gives the storyline a truncated feel.  It is too bad that on a limited series like \\"Twin Peaks,\\" that the release of the DVD does not inspire a re-presentation of the original work.  Much like the \\"Godfather\\" series was reimagined as a linear single work, I think \\"Twin Peaks\\" could at least benefit from a re-edited pilot/introduction and perhaps a tidier close.  However I'm one of those people who is more grateful for what I have than for what I lack.  There is certainly plenty to enjoy here.<br /><br />The special features included in this release are amateurish at best but occasionally give a candid and welcome glimpse of cast and crew off set.  The Michael Anderson interviews are priceless and there could be far more of Mark Frost.  It is especially nice that the interviews have been conducted after the passage of time.  There seems to be a greater sense of awareness by those interviewed of the importance of that lost time.  There is the frequent rich perspective that can only be achieved through adequate distance.<br /><br />It would be wonderful to see a more polished approach to these interviews that included Lara Flynn Boyle, Sherilyn Fenn, Michael Ontkean and far more of the fabulous Sheryl Lee.  (Not to mention -- God forbid! -- Lynch himself.)  I would hate to think that any of them feel the need to distance themselves from the past or even consider that a look back in any way risks typecast or reeks of repitition.  We all are what we are.  Revel in your time.<br /><br />What the rerelease of \\"Twin Peaks\\" offers is a chance for a new generation of viewers to experience anew a story rooted firmly in the dark archetypes of the human psyche.  David Lynch takes us into the heart of darkness of rural America (one)armed with a wry smile, one every bit as enigmatic and inviting as Leonardo's Mona Lisa.
0790729644|5.0|This movie has the whole package. If you love westerns, then this one goes to the top of the list. This is a MUST OWN, and a TRUE CLASSIC. The acting, directing, story, scenery is all A+. You can't help but like Eastwood's character and are eager to see him and Morgan Freeman ride off together to collect their last bounty. Gene Hackman's lawman is both calculating and chilling. Eastwood leaves a true legacy with this movie.
B0002Z1EG2|5.0|This is the best Greatest Hits CD or Album in many years.  It packs all of Shania's greats with a few new ones!!!  If You like Shania then this CD is a must have for your listening pleasure and collection!
6304286961|5.0|Ok, I don't care what most people say, this movie is probably 75% or more true than what has been said.  Sure there are a lot of inconsistencies (Such as the New Haven Incident being pegged for 1968 when it was 1967) and charachter mistakes (Patricia Keneally was not backstage in Miami..Morrison didn't meet Pam on the street etc..) but for the most part the actual events such as the New Haven Arrest, Miami, The Whiskey, and to some extent Ed Sullivan are depicted fairly accurately (At the very LEAST a little overdramatized).  I also have noticed that Oliver Stone did a lot of consolidation in this movie (Why not? I mean c'mon you can't sum up the entire Doors Legacy with a 2 hour movie!)but he did it for the most part accurately.  Before passing judgement on this movie read the books (I Highly recommend 'Riders On The Storm' by John Densmore, 'Jim Morrison: Life Death, Legend' by Stephen Davis and 'No One Here Gets Out Alive') the books will paint a picture in your mind before you watch the movie and then you can compare the two, you will find that Oliver Stone, considering the circumstances he was up against did a great job with depicting Jim Morrison and The Doors. Sure, its in no way a complete accurate representation of 'The Doors' but instead it is what Oliver Stone has made them out to be based on talking to the band and the transcripts he's read that were based on those who knew the band and/or Jim Morrison well.  Also, keep in mind, this movie is not meant to be a documentary...its an artists recreation of that era from his own perspective.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|With such an important body of work, The Beatles are one of the most highly regarded bands of the 20th century.  Doing a best of compilation over such as a band has inherent problems.  Because all their albums (especially everything from 1965's Rubber Soul on) are such important monuments of popular culture, any tracklisting proposed as \\"This is The Beatles' best work\\" will be hotly contested, and fans will be left alienated and left wondering why this one song was put in place of another and how dare they leave off this other song.  Even as an introduction to people who aren't familiar with The Beatles (that would be all the people just now arriving on planet earth), any compilation of their work will divide fans, saying there are too many songs missing, and the fans would probably be right. <br /> <br />The Beatles 1 album very, very wisely avoids all this controversy by sticking with their number one hits.  All though there is some debate even over what constitutes a number one song (back in the 1960s some of the different charts showed \\"Please Please Me\\" as a number one), this criteria gives the album a purpose and a goal.  It's also a compiler's dream; rather than sifting through all The Beatles' work and trying to assemble a piece-meal, artificial best of which will ultimately be derided by fans and critics alike, there's a very clear reason why which songs were chosen to appear on this album. <br /> <br />Does that make 1 a good representation of The Beatles' work? Yes and no.  Yes, because the album shows a clear trajectory of the band's evolution, and also how much they changed the face of popular music.  The early, infectious singles are a totally separate era from their middle and later period.  Music went from being primary driven by hit singles to a more album oriented form of art.  The Beatles were largely responsible for this change, and also explains why Past Masters Vol 1 & 2 are so important.  Several of their biggest hit songs (including \\"She Loves You,\\" \\"I Want to Hold Your Hand,\\" \\"I Feel Fine,\\" and \\"Hey Jude,\\" arguably the biggest song of the `60s) never appeared on albums.  1 gives you an aural autobiography of popular music in the 1960s.   <br /> <br />On the other hand, there are some necessarily HUGE blind spots in 1.  There's absolutely no songs from SGT PEPPER (one of rock's most acclaimed records) or THE WHITE ALBUM (which is my personal favorite).  In a way, it's almost appropriate because those two projects were first and foremost albums (especially SGT PEPPER), and they established albums as the dominant artform in popular music.  Their absence from 1 is justified because no chart topping singles were released from either album. <br /> <br />That's why 1 succeeds.  It gives us all The Beatles' number one hits (there's some historical quibbles on this, but not enough to disrupt the causal listener).  It became a huge seller upon its release, showing that in the musical atmosphere of nu metal and nauseating bad pop that The Beatles are still highly relevant.  1 shows the evolution of a musical era long past, as well as one of the most highly mythologised times in the Twentieth Century (the 1960s).  It's an excellent snapshot of rock's most important band, and succeeds because it wisely sticks to chart success, not personal taste (which would be highly contested).  It's certainly not the only Beatles album you need, but it's a great place to start.
B0002XH9Z4|5.0|As you all know, I've been an MJ fan since 1982. Back then MJ changed my life with his music and talent. This box set is a blessing! I've waited many years, as we all have to hear such songs as \\"Monkey Business\\". I remember whenever a song like that was mentioned but then cut from a cd, I always wanted to get my hands on it! I remember spending literally hours watching Captain Eo at Disneyland and wishing daily that I could have that song \\"We Are Here To Change The World\\" on cd. The same with \\"On The Line\\"! What an amazing song! I bought the movie just to hear that song! <br />I know MJ's a perfectionist and it's hard for him to release any songs that he doesn't consider perfect, but I would love for him to continue releasing these unreleased gems! I know he has tons more and I've loved every single one! <br />Throw in all of MJ's hits that I'm sure every fan has in triplicate and you've got literally \\"The Ultimate Collection\\"! <br />This box set is definetly worth the price and the packaging is really cool! So Shammon! Get it!
B00005JNEI|3.0|I personally think that this movie was taken out of context. It may have something that were true, but we as people don't know what really goes on in the White House, and we dont see everything, and if we did this world would probably be worse then It already was, because there thins that we just dont need to know. Since we live in a world of free speech that's all Michael Moore was doing, but that doesnt mean that everything he said was true. Thats just how I feel about it. We have to look at boths sides ot just one and judge someone off of someones opinions.
B0000C1733|4.0|First off I will say that this is a good greatest hits album for the person wanting to cover the career of the chili peppers at the dawn of the 90's. This album starts when the peppers became a mainstream band during the grunge era. Although they are more of a funk band I remember how well the music fit it with others of the era.  <br />What this album isn't, is a compilation of their earlier work. If you are looking for that you might want to buy the \\"What Hits?\\" album which was released before One Hot Minute. Also you might like some of their early albums like \\"Uplift Mofo Party Plan\\". <br /> <br />In response to chili_pepper_chik. Well I will just list a few favorites of mine. You may already be familiar with them, but it's hard to generate a list of the bands you are unfamiliar with. I'd suggest <br />Depeche Mode <br />Bush <br />Offspring <br />Stone Temple Pilots <br />Pearl Jam (Ten) <br />Talking Heads (you mentioned) <br />The Cars <br />Faith No More <br />Van Halen <br />They Might Be Giants <br />Styx <br />Hope that helps out some, if any.
B00005JA2B|4.0|Progressive rock has been spit upon, cursed, and crowned with thorns by the no-nothings who populate the rock establishment.  Rock, the music of rebellion, has an orthodoxy.  Kansas wilfully violated that orthodoxy and got shot from all sides by ignoramuses everywhere. <br />\\"Leftoverture\\" has intense soul.  It bites you in the neck from the very beginning when that grand and beautiful song \\"Carry On Wayward Son\\" opens with the rough-hewn angelic voices. <br />Kansas was the only band that mattered in the 1970's.  While lesser outfits were churning out bad love songs and disco dresque hits Kerry Livgren was pursuing a bright and beautiful spiritual quest with a mighty vengeance.  Livgren remains one of the greatest lyricists of rock music and he combined his lyrics with a sense of grandeur and intensity in the music. <br />Who but Kerry Livgren could concieve of the rock counterpoint we listen to in that masterpiece \\"Miracles Out Of Nowhere\\"? <br />There is something in this albumn that destroys the rediculously mediocre noise we are often forced to listen to on radio or behold in videos on MTV or VH1. As we listen to this music we are confronted with the deep abysm of the self and so much more besides.
B000294SFW|5.0|Motorhead proves that metal is still alive, even though i like most genres of music, i can't stand not having much real old-fashioned metal. Motorhead the only old band coming out with albums that are standable. Ac/Dc and Metallica even though great to hear live but just don't have that effect in their albums anymore. Motorhead is still alive and after over 30 years since their debut, they have proven, music is not just for sales, music is for music.

B0000AMRJC|5.0|The young and fruitfull Al Pacino, without any form of goatee or beard which seems to be permanently plastered on his face these days. Fully equipped with a sinister scar across his left eye, full-on confrontational behaviour, shoot mouth and general 'bad guy' we have Tony Montana. Where Montana ends and Pacino begins is difficult to see, he slips into Montana like a banana skin with absolutely no difficulty. Forget Godfather, forget Untouchables, forget Goodfellas. This is the real stuff.<br /><br />Montana has the most ambition of any man in the world, he's yearning to become powerful is unquestionable. He's ability to offend is also unquestionable, but it's the I'm-not-gonna-take-s**t-offa-nobody attitude that you love about Montana. He has faults, like every human being, mostly in the form of his little sister whom he strives to protect in a rather gung-ho attitude. Their relationship is enthralling, you never know if the evident love he has for her is deeper than you imagine. She eventually leads to his downfall.<br /><br />The music in Scarface is also definitive, mostly for it's original hip-hop style (far from todays so-called hip-hop full of people like Eminem) which is unlike anything today. As much as I dispise the current state of hip-hop, the music used in Scarface is good and fits in perfectly with the ultimately styled film.<br /><br />Director Brian DePalma has his finest three hours with Scarface, three hours indeed. The new Anniversary Edtion is slightly longer and approached three. Along with an interview with Def Jam on the music, the creating of the film and a nice look back at the original, this edition is well worth buying.<br /><br />Simply this is a classic, Pacino at his alltime best, one mean mother.
B00005JM4Z|2.0|Paul Walker can act as well as a brick wall. He is that bad.<br /><br />But beyond that the movie is semi-watchable.<br /><br />The Skyline race at the beginning was the highlight of the film and the rest just went downhill. The cars rocked in the first one from old school muscle to tricked Civics and Supras. What do we get in the sequel? Two Mitsubishi stinkers.<br /><br />Did Mitsubishi pay off the director or something to have their dying car lines in the movie?<br /><br />All in all it was an ok popcorn movie but it is a total waste when compared to Diesel and the first movie.
B00004TH83|5.0|Lara is, by far the best artist out there - Why? Because she produces, arranges, plays the piano and composes most of her songs - and most importantly, she sings like angels in heaven.  She can also sing in more that 4 languages!!!   This self-titled English CD is all you could wish for - passionate, intense, emotional, versatile... Her lyrics are profound and pleasant to the ear. Her vocal range and effortless high notes make her, in my opinion, one of a kind - simply: the best artist. It's a shame she has not conquered the US knowing that she surpasses the talent and professionalism of many new and old artists out there. By the way the song \\"Broken Vow\\", number 9, written by her (among others), has probably the most sensitive lyrics I've heard - It may bring tears to your eyes. By the way, I highly recommend any of her live concerts - you'll be absolutely speechless! It will be quite an experience for you to watch her interact with her audience.
B00003CXZ1|4.0|This is an extremely enjoyable short action film.<br /><br />The pace never lets up and before you know it the movies done with. Jolie fits Lara Croft like a glove and really made the movie what it is.<br /><br />However, dont expect much in the way of plot and what not. This is one of those 'check your brain at the door' movies and theres nothing wrong with that. Just dont expect an Oscar worthy movie and you will enjoy Tomb Raider a whole heck of a lot...
B000002LFU|4.0|Although Murmur is the best REM album, Green stands out the most. It features hits like Orange Crush, World Leader Pretend, and Pop Song 89 \\"Hello, I saw you, I know you, I knew you, I think I can remember your name/Should we talk about the weather/Or should we talk about the government?\\". Great song. Anyway, this is an awesome starting album for any new fan of this great band. It has its flaws, but it wins out. Pick it up along with Murmur.
B00005JMXX|3.0|The special effects for the mass destruction were great!  Throughout the movie, I was impressed with the action and the depictions of devastation. <br /> <br />The story, though, could use lots of work.  My main problem with it was the focus on saving a small group of people, the main character's son and his friends.  After seeing countless millions of people killed, the audience is supposed to be overly concerned about a handful of random folks?  It's not like Armageddon or Deep Impact, where the lead characters are trying to save the planet.  The movie would have been better off giving a broader view of Earth's survivors - which would also suit the title more.
B00003CXCT|5.0|all 3 of the newly restored, repacked dvds are splendid, but the empire strikes back, and return of the jedi turned out to be the very best of the 3 films!  the clarity and beauty, the fantastic thx ac-3 ex sound system particularly on empire and jedi are simply astounding! they floored me! it was like seeing them for the first time, again. they never looked or sounded better even in the theaters! highly recommended, it's a marvelous showcase for the 3 best sci-fi flicks ever made to date! it is a definite must own.  kudos to mr. lucas, and to 20th century fox for their masterful, highly professional presentations here.
B00065JTBA|2.0|Firstly where's that statistic title come from? Anyway whatever it's a great display of unsurprising self-indulgence from Bon Jovi. Okay, I'll be fair - there are a couple of half-decent tracks on here but most of this box set is made up of rubbish that to put it frankly didn't make the cut. Jon Bon Jovi is no Bob Dylan or Bruce Springsteen; they're two artists which have massive amounts of unreleased high quality material and can easily put out a release like this comprised almost wholly of excellent material. Bon Jovi however; yet again Jon has tried to emulate his idol Bruce Springsteen and failed miserably. Springsteen & the E St Band released a similar title a few years ago; the critically acclaimed Tracks which was made up of rare and unreleased songs. Bon Jovi however simply don't have the material to back this up hence this woeful release that can only be defined as substandard.
B0002MPU1K|1.0|Coming at you from the land of Soymilk Lattes, Yoga Retreats, and aromatherapy,this album is a testament to all things mediocre. It is way overproduced, over-hyped, and image driven. It reminds me of Westport, CT and yuppie, watered-down culture. I think firstly, the guy needs to get his mug off the CD cover. Real jazz musicians like Louis Armstrong, Ella Fitzgerald had to rely on actual talent to sell their music. They would never make it in todays market, and this guy is a posterchild for all that is corrupt and wrong with it. His sound is so artificial, I think it might cause cancer. He brings nothing to the table. That lag-behind-the-beat technique doesn't impress me. It's the Berklee/Suzuki method of \\"swing\\" which I've heard ad nauseum.
B00005JKEZ|5.0|Michael Curtz's (\\"Casablanca\\", Academy Award for Best Director, 1943; see my review on it) classic, sumptuous rendition of the Robin Hood legends starring legendary actor Errol Flynn (\\"Captain Blood\\", \\"They Died With Their Boots On,\\" etc) as the dashing outlaw, Olivia DeHaviland (who would next star in the memorable role of Melanie Hamilton in the epic film \\"Gone With The Wind\\", based on the novel of the same name; review of it coming soon) as the beautiful Lady Marian, Claude Rains (\\"Casablanca\\", etc) as the scheming Prince John and Basil Rathbone (\\"The Court Jester\\", etc) as the evil Sir Guy Of Gisbourne is the definitive edition of Robin Hood. The 1991 remake starring Kevin Costner (\\"The Untouchables\\", etc), Morgan Freeman (\\"Lean On Me\\", etc) and Alan Rickman (\\"Die Hard\\", etc) is dark, fast-paced and filled with furious action whereas this one is calm and vibrant. Although Kevin Costner was good as the legendary outlaw, I prefer dashing matinee idol Errol Flynn in the role. I also prefer the lovely Olivia DeHaviland as Lady Marian, a perfectly villainous Alan Rickman as the evil Sheriff of Nottingham and ---- ------- as King Richard. Want to know why I didn't place his name there? Because there may be people reading this who haven't seen it and I don't want to spoil it for them. I'll only say one thing: they'll be very surprised. Watch this version first, as it is the best adaptation of the Robin Hood legends. This version is Not Rated. The remake is rated PG for violence, mild thematic elements, a childbirth scene and brief language.

B0002JJBZE|5.0|A must-have for Trekkers! At last we're given some of this series' best - The whacked-out Spock in rut in \\"Amok Time\\", the annoyingly and unbearably cute (until the Ewoks came along, of course)Tribbles, Who Mourns for Adonais? and Mirror Mirror, just to name a few.  Yeah, so the special effects are dated and cheesy looking in the 21st century. Who gives a flip? It was a great series and finally we have our fix. Rest in peace DeForrest Kelley and blessings and hopes for a cure for James Doohan. You live on on DVD
0767834739|5.0|I really loved this movie and it takes alot to get me to say that about a Sci-Fi movie. It is also one of the best sequels to come out of Hollywood in a long time. <br /> <br />The movie is action packed with a high scare factor, but where Apocalypse excels is with a well-crafted back story and compelling characters. I really appreciated the fact that the movie wasn't dumbed down to merely gore and action, but made you think about what was going on. <br /> <br />This movie reaches very close to Aliens and The Thing (1982) in quality.
B00004Y6NW|5.0|I still remember listening to this album for the first time in the late '70's. It was like something I'd never heard before and a little hard to digest for a Hard Rocker like me.    What I mean to say is that Dire Straits initially were an acquired taste unlike today where the name of the band indicates a type of electronic Dylanisque sound that most people are aware of.    This, the first album of the band is an absolute masterpiece starting with the great first love song by the band `Down to the waterline'(some of the later ones being 'tunnel of love' and 'Romeo and Juliet') with quality baritone vocals and great guitar plucking by Mark Knopfler. Mark was and is the main man in the band contributing on the vocals and guitar besides writing almost all the songs.    This is the album with the original version of `Sultans of swing', which is the most enduring song by the band, still heavily played on the radio.    But the real gems on this album are the mellower ones you may never have heard before like `Six blade Knife', `Wild wild west' and `Lions' all great songs with some fantastic arrangements and lyrics.    `In the gallery' a slightly more powerful song is based on the current state of commercialization of art. It addresses the domination of the art galleries in making an artist a success or a failure. The lyrics are touching and hit the gut.    `Water of love' has some real deft guitar work which quite reminds me of the Indian string instrument the \\"Sitar' (made famous by Ravi Shankar, Gorge Harrison and Jimmy Page in 'Kashmir').    Each song on this album is a classic, the tempo and theme of each song is different making this first work by the band their best.     Dire Straits have some really great albums but they have never bettered this one.
B000002NJS|5.0|Im used to hearing it cause my mom owns it and plays it when she can. I've grown used to hearing it. My favourite song in it is Frozen and Swim. I hope everyone will buy this 1 day and everyone could here how wonderful it is. I guess I'm stuck in the 90s' listening to it. Madonna gots talent. So why do people accuse her of lip-syncing?
B00004RJ71|5.0|I teach gang students in \\"East Los,\\" and to a person they have said that this movie comes the closest to what it's really like out there.  This movie touched me, I've seen it numerous times and every time I hear a line from the movie I hear one of my former students, hear what they want to say.  If you want to know what it was the East Los gang life was like in the 70's and 80's, check this movie out.
B0001LJC2K|5.0|Muse is an absolutely amazing band and i think its a shame they have to be compared to Radiohead.  Their styles are completely different. Radioheads music makes me depressed.  Granted Muse is slightly happier but their tunes make me rock out like nothing else. Matthew Bellamy's vocal range is incredible, gives me chills and he plays the piano beautifully.   <br />Some of my favorites on this album: <br />Time is Running Out - never get tired of this no matter how much its played. <br /> <br />Butterflies and Hurricanes - In my opinion the most beautiful song on the album. Nifty little piano work. <br /> <br />The Small Print - A rockin' song <br /> <br />Ruled by Secrecy - gives you something to think about <br /> <br />Sing For Absolution - Haunting lyrics
B0002Z1EG2|5.0|Hard to believe Shania's been around long enough to HAVE a Greatest Hits album (volume 2 can't be that far off!)! She gives her fans a pre-holiday treat with this collection of her best.  Have fun dancing on New Year's Eve this year with new tracks of \\"I'm Gonna Getcha Good\\" \\"Feel Like a Woman\\" and \\"Whose Bed Have Your Boots Been Under\\" - they're all here! Win Somebody's Love with this CD in their stocking, or buy it for yourself. (Buy two anyway). Thanks, Shania. Your name is really what it means - you're not only on your way, you have arrived as queen of country!
B0006284JQ|1.0|Thank God that Britney spears has finally ended, this album is a big disaster, she has zero talent, zero dancing skills and every song is so stupid and preposterous it makes me sick, she is done my friends, Because Christina Aguilera will take over in 2005-06 and she will become the new \\"in\\" thing. <br />Britney will be forgotten just like limp bizkit and G-Unit in a few years, while Mariah, Geto Boys, Christina, Nas will still live on <br /> <br />One of the worst albums of the year. <br />
B000669GAI|5.0|All is there except for OCEANS! Besides that, the  collection of the hits from one of the best bands from the past 20 years... Enough said a must have for any PJ fans! <br />
B000005C1B|5.0|I remember it well; I watched it in awe on cable and taped it.  I still have the tape.  I have the cassette version of this CD.  When PBS trots it out during a fund raiser, I watch it again.  It is very special to me.  Nobody has to tell you about the vocal powers of Roy Orbison.  The show was no doubt shot in black and white to conceal Roy's less-than-striking physical qualities. People magazine had a picture of him with a reference to his being an \\"antique rocker\\".  But when the lights came up, Roy showed us all that he still had it.  As other reviewers have noted, accomplished musicians with their own fan bases were on hand in backup roles to provide excellent support without displaying any ego of their own.  They were there to support their hero.  This is one of the best filmed concerts I have ever seen and highly recommend you get the DVD as well.  In the filmed version, as the cameras pull back after the concert, Kris Kristofferson can be seen in the audience, playing to the camera and grinning his approval.  This is one item you are bound to treasure.  This is music history made more significant by Roy's sudden death just months later.
B00005JNDX|5.0|I saw this movie a couple days ago expecting to be disappointed due to all the bad reviews I've heard. From the very beginning to the end, it was an excellent movie. Granted, most men or non-Bridget fans will find it boring and preditable, those who enjoyed the first flick and the books will love this movie. It did follow the book fairly closely, but some things were changed or removed entirely (Bridget's mom's African project was not mentioned). The acting was well done, I was happy to see more of Colin Firth although is it true that he had as much variety in expression/voice as Keanu Reeves in \\"The Matrix\\". Hugh Grant returned as the womanizing sleeze and he was great. Renee Zellweger looked much heavier in this movie than the first but she played Bridget wonderfully.  <br />I can see the point of some critics wondering why these 2 men chased after her so intently as it did seem a little excessive, especially when Mark Darcy feared that Bridget had returned to Daniel again. All I have to say on that subject is that it did follow the book, where Bridget was pursued by both throughout the story. <br />All in all, this is a great film and I will be seeing it again. If you loved the first movie, loved the books, and can relate to Bridget, then see this movie!
B0002YLC24|1.0|Like \\"Gerry\\" a walking, talking go-no-where movie.  Sorry, but I found NO redeeming qualities in it, just boredom and blathering.
B00006LIRI|4.0|I think this compilation was aimed more towards completists than newcomers.  If you're looking for a one-disc collection of hits, it doesn't work.  There are too many songs missing.  However, if you already own all of the albums like me, this is still a useful and interesting compilation, particularly if you have the \\"B-sides\\" disc (which is also, unfortunately, imperfect). \\"Electrical Storm\\" is a very strong effort, but I've heard a third version that is harder than either version included on this.  I wish that one were included instead.  <br /> <br />The new mixes of the \\"Pop' songs are so-so; I thought \\"Gone\\" outdid the original and the others probably didn't. And \\"The First Time\\" really should have been omitted.  <br /> <br />Overall, though, i'm glad I own it.
B00005JMJG|4.0|This movie is not for the sequentially minded.  The story line is more scrambled than a three egg omlette.  And that's what keeps it suspenseful and intriguing right up to the end.  For the mainstream movie goer, it may be a bit \\"artsy\\" with it's sudden change-ups and hard cuts.  But the movie takes a risk and there's not a lot of studios willing to do that.  So if you like twisted, bittersweet, thought provoking movies, you'll find this one a jewel.
0446608955|5.0|You have to understand that his book is not meant to be analyzed. It is simple, gentle, and full of hope. I, personally, love a simple love story without pretensions and illusions of grandeur. I know that this book is not deemed worthy of some intellectual types, but it was good enough for a simple person like me.
B00028HBKM|1.0|I don't understand. As a christian, this film made me quesy. All it is schlock and gore. Haven't we all seen John Waters films? This is just propaganda from the catholic church. Seriously, people need to get lives its a movie that entails everything in the bible with a few exceptions. Most people don't cry during church...unless ur a crazy pentecostal! (jk) But really its sad that we have films convert people to christianity that contain such hatreds of jews. I don't understand why he can't have a disclaimer at the beginning of the film. I guess what I want to do is apologize to jewish people everywhere on behalf of this film. not every christian is as intolerant as mel gibson
B0002Z1EG2|5.0|It's hard to believe that after 10 years and 4 albums it's already time for a greatest hits package from the greatest female entertainer of all-time.  The only down side is that she has so many hits she can't fit all of them on the album. <br /> <br />Most of us know all her hit songs like \\"Whose Bed Have Your Boots Been Under?,\\" \\"Man! I Feel Like A Woman!,\\" and \\"Forever And For Always,\\" but what's great about this collection is that we get mixes either not available before or hard to find, like radio versions of \\"I'm Gonna Getcha Good!\\" and \\"(If You're Not In It For Love) I'm Outta Here!,\\" and the pop/world mix of \\"That Don't Impress Me Much.\\" <br /> <br />The collection icludes \\"Any Man Of Mine,\\" the best country song of all-time, in my opinion, and \\"You're Still The One\\" and \\"From This Moment On,\\" Shania's most famous ballads that are staples at weddings everywhere, without the spoken intros featured on the \\"Come On Over\\" album. <br /> <br />Finally, we get three brand new songs.  There is a country and pop version of \\"Party For Two\\" with Billy Currington and Mark McGrath.  I personally like the country version better but they're both great.  \\"I Ain't No Quitter\\" is a fun, cheeky, twangy swing number that's probably the most country song she's ever done.  Finally, the highlight of the new material is a very powerful and deep ballad titled \\"Don't!\\"  This is one of the best songs I've heard in a long time.
B000005JXG|5.0|Shane McGowan's vocals can be an assault on the unappreciative ear, like they were on my own.  But I listened closer, thank the lord.  Some may compare them to other Irish/punk outfits, but who might they be?  The Pogues are a mainstay, a unique and fresh(even now)Perspective on classic rock,punk, and rooted Irish songwriting.  They bridged the gap between my parents' taditional Irish tunes, and my own rock prefernces, and brought a better understanding of both.  I used to hate the old Irish songs, now I devour the trad. bands, Lunasa, Altan, and Dervish.  I'm drawn in to my own American tastes with better perspective, and my best band, Irish as well, U2 has remained the same, yet widened my appreciation of all music. They will always be the best. <br /> <br />Yet through it all, the Pogues are more like the Ramones than the Chieftans(or is it the other way around?).  They are more like the Bothy Band than the Clash(or is that the other way around?)  Comparisons are worthless here.  There are no other Pogues(although I do recomend Shane McGowan and the Popes CD \\"The Snake\\").  The tempo is strong and aggressive.  \\"Bottle of Smoke\\" is an insane whirly-gig of a drunken horse bet. \\"Fairytale of New York\\" is glorious, and pitiful, a great dancing lament.  \\"Medley\\" will be the most recognised, another Irish music purist called it the \\"heart\\" of the record.  The heart of the record, for me, is \\"Thousands Are Sailing.\\"  This is an emmigrant's song, really, a thrusting and angry ballad with soul.  The Brendan Behan referance is perfect.  The Pogues are Irish Music Rebels. <br /> <br />\\"Essential\\" Pogues is more rare, but the best introduction and compilation of great Pogues songs.  If you can find it, grab it!
B00005JMEW|5.0|A great film on its own, even greatter when you watch Kill Bill Vol. 2. Kill Bill 1 is the questions, 2 is the answer.
B000069AUI|5.0|my favorite album of all time, i believe everyone needs a little coldplay if not alot. just get it. there is something about me, where i have the tendency to just skip the first track of every album, and to no surprise i usually do the same here, although i'm sure somebody can appreciate 'politik' a bit more than me. any way its guenius after more guenius as the songs unravel and my favorites have to be 'green eyes' and 'amsterdam'just because of the pure emotion they evoke.i can't live with out it.
B00004XQ83|5.0|This album opened up my mind & ears to how wonderful mountain music can be. Once again, as I age my appreciation of non-rock or jazz expands. This is a perfect CD that was masterfully produced & compiled by T-Bone Burnett. I believe this soundtrack has put bluegrass on the map much the same way Saturday Night Fever did for disco and The Harder They Come did for reggae. All 18 songs are excellent but my personal favorite is Didn't Leave Nobody but the Baby by Emmylou, Alison & Gillian.
B00005K9LK|5.0|...there was this very good, tight record that caught a band at the height of their musical powers, with songs that flowed as effortlessly as the duelling guitar licks of KK Downing and Glenn Tipton. \\"Screaming For Vengeance\\" simply got it right as the perfect summertime metal record. <br /> <br />Two things about this record really stand out for me - the airiness of the production that you feel you can walk right into, and the showcasing of many voice styles & ranges Rob Halford is masterfully  capable of. Sheer brilliance, never since duplicated.

0688158129|5.0|From the moment I picked it up, I couldn't put this book down. It was great. I swear, I had never read a book that got to me like this book did. I read another book by Picoult before, and I love how she writes. This is the only book ever that has made me actually cry. The Lifetime Channel made a movie of it but it was nowhere near as good as the book. I think it was very real. The way the character's feelings are described were just very real. I loved the description she uses. I know I will definitely be reading this book again! I definitely recommend it.
B00005UKE0|5.0|In my humble opinion, this is arguably the best solo Beatle album (along with John Lennon's Plastic Ono Band). I think he had all this bottled up creativity that exploded due to his Beatle input being contained to only one song per album. In addition to being a phenomenal album, this re-release is remastered and repackaged with a very cool colorized cover. It also has 5 additional tracks including a newly recorded stripped down version of My Sweet Lord. And I forgot about the guest musicians! Check out this list...Ringo Starr, Jim Gordon, Alan White, Klaus Voorman, Carl Radle, Gary Wright, Bobby Whitlock, Billy Preston, Gary Brooker, Pete Drake, Eric Clapton, Dave Mason, Bobby Keys, Jim Price, Ray Cooper, Badfinger and believe it or not, even Phil Collins! Derek & the Dominos were formed from the jam sessions they had here. This masterpiece was engineered by producer extrordinaire Ken Scott as well.
B00000BKDV|5.0|I grew up with this band. I bought the vinyl when it came out, and taught myself guitar listening to these songs. <br /> <br />I recently re-discovered Piece Of Mind on my CD Walkman, and found that while working I can play this disc 3 or 4 times and not get sick of it. It is a bit over-mixed and layered in the production, but that is precisely what makes it such a unique an dtrance-inducing record.
B0000013G9|5.0|This CD is SOOOOOOOOOO tight. If I can rate it more than 5 stars, I will. I played it so much that I had to buy another. I still listen to it now. They are the best girl group ever. I like them better than Destiny's Child because neither one of them are trying to be the center of attention or better than each other. They are so real and down to earth unlike destiny's child. Even though they lost left eye, they are still the best girl group and it will remain that way!!! RIP Left Eye.
B000669GAI|5.0|One of the greatest band in the last 20 years finally releases a greatest hits collection. Pearl jam is not one of those grunge band that only bangs on 3 chords with a lot of distortion. No sir, these guys have been releasing some of the best rock, musically and with a concience. Better than Nirvana in many aspects. Besides, this is a band that has never bend over for the record industry and always put their fans first. I wish all bands were like Pearl Jam.
B0002J4X1Q|5.0|A deadly virus has escaped into a underground scientific colony owned by the Umbrella Corporation killing all the researchers and employees, a lovely woman named \\"Alice\\" ( Milla Jocovich) is joined with \\"Rain\\" ( Michelle Rodriguez) and a elite commando squad to investigate the mysterious deaths of the workers. They discover that the computer that runs the place has taken over and accidently unleashes hordes of zombies & mutant monsters, they must find a way out or else end up as dinner before the virus will infect humanity.<br /><br />A well made adapation of my all time favorite video game series of the same name, sure it doesn't have Chris Redfield or Jill Valentine ( whom stars in part 2) but it's a breezy ride loaded with gore, horror, sci-fi, decent acting, cool music score and a twist in the end that leads to \\"Resident Evil Apocalypse\\" which was almost even better.<br /><br />The DVD here has great picture with good sound quality and neat extras like 2 commentaries, featurettes, trailers, and clip from \\"Resident Evil Apocalypse\\", so if you enjoy zombie movies then this is definitely worth adding to the zombie DVD collection.<br /><br />Also recommended: \\" Dawn of the Dead\\" ( 1978) \\"Day of the Dead\\" ,\\"From Dusk Till Dawn\\", \\" The Matrix\\", \\"Blade 1 & 2\\", \\" Re-Animator\\", \\" Cemetery Man\\", \\" Total Recall\\", \\" Versus\\", \\" 28 Days Later...\\", \\"Night of the Living Dead ( 1968 and 1990 versions)\\", \\" The Stuff\\", \\" Scanners\\", \\" Hell of the Living Dead ( a.k.a.

B0000025YL|5.0|This is one really great, fun, aggressive record. In fact I would say get this on import instead of Balls To The Wall, which IMO has these guys thinking too much about their 'formula' while the songs lack the energy and off-handed naturalness of this disc. <br /> <br />On Restless, you have Udo and Wolf hitting full-throttle like no time ever since. Hoffman really has the perfect Flying-V/Marshall buzzsaw guitar sound that he uses to great effect on cutting rhythm riffs as well as leads. Almost a violin-like tone on some solos. Did you know he was 16 when he joined the band?? <br /> <br />If Accept were never to do so well in the end, at least they had this one perfect record.

B000002IV8|5.0|i love OVERKILL, they are a great metal band! one of the few metal band's from the eighties, that is still metal! i own 8 OVERKILL, c.d.'s. but I HEAR BLACK, is by far my favorite OVERKILL, album! this albim is probably their most underrated album to date! it is so underrated that it has been out of print for awhile!? it is not you typical fast, thrash, speed metal album that OVERKILL, is famous for. but this album has a heavy groove through out the album, that just makes it awesome. i rank it very high on my fav metal albums. with bands like, PANTERA, SLAYER, TESTAMENT, SEPULTURA, & FEAR FACTORY! i would recommend this album to anyone interested, before they are all gone! fav songs, I HEAR BLACK, SPIRITUAL VOID, FEED MY HEAD, & IGNORANCE AND INNOCENCE! OVERKILL RULES!!!!!!!
B00007ELEL|5.0|Not much more can be said about it, other than that this movie is just the greatest movie about nothing EVER. I could watch it over and over again, and never get bored of it.
B00068IOWM|5.0|you know you guys are reviewing a pirated version of this album, don't you? Even U2 has acknowledged that the album pirated is the UNFINISHED version. <br /> <br />You haven't even heard of the FINISHED album yet. <br /> <br />Don't review until you got the real thing. <br /> <br />geez
B000021YQV|5.0|The two people below me don't know what the **** they are talking about. SOAD is unlistenable? So Aerials is unlistenable is it? And he goes on to praise Nine Inch Nails LOL. He's got a great sense of humour. Unlike NIN, SOAD actually has a singer that can sing in tune. They also don't rely on samples to make music. When  NIN write a song as beautiful as Chop Suey then you can come and brag until then stay the **** away from the SOAD department and go buy your morbid goth cd's ok loser? <br />Toxicity is the best album of the past 10 years, although Fiona Apple's Tidal pushes it close. As I said Aerials is a stand out track, it is so melodic, I love the middle eastern melodies. <br />SOAD's new album Hypnotize is out early next year, until then I'll keep listening to Toxicity because it never gets old. Also check out Steal This Album, another masterpiece. Daron Malakian is a genius, Serj Tankian is a brilliant singer, John Dolymayan is up there with Chad Smith for drums and Shavo is just plain nuts! LOL! <br />p.s. this album, like all their others was produced by the legendary Rick Rubin, gotta give him props too because producers really help improve the band's songs from the original demos.  <br />Buy this album NOW!
B00005JLEJ|5.0|Exactly like almost any other Kurosawa movie; in other words, \\"brilliant\\".   <br /> <br />The scripting, acting, shooting, and directing are all absolutely wonderful.  It is a film filled with emotion, pulling strings with both the delight of a child and a man's sacrifice for another man he never knew.   <br /> <br />Though it is certainly not as lighthearted (or fun) like Kurosawa's Samurai flicks (Yojimbo, Hidden Fortress), nor as epic as Seven Samurai, nor as thought provoking as Rashomon, Kagemusha holds a very prized place on my shelf of DVD's.
1577314808|5.0|Eckhart Tolle is by no means a \\"copy cat,\\" as some of his Amazon reviewers have suggested. He is a truly important original thinker.  Yes, he is influenced by the Eastern traditions and Western mystic philosophies.  But he is pulling these into a much more empirical framework.  Tolle is striving towards a synthesis of ancient wisdom with contemporary Western humanistic psychology.<br /><br />He echos the main theme of humanistic psychology.  That is, alienated people need to look inwardly, learn to feel their own feelings, develop a \\"strong sense of self,\\" and not be afraid to become their own center of values.  Learning to feel can lead straight through the personality, or ego, into Enlightenment -- the experience of being in the timeless Now, and of having life long inner peace.<br /><br />By thus attending inwardly, one gradually learns that the inner events of which one is becoming conscious are actually less important than one's consciousness of them. Strive for awareness, not analysis.  Liberation comes when consciousness becomes conscious of itself.<br /><br />After Enlightenment, the demands of life can be met without the old fears and doubts.  He says that we will continue to feel Enlightenment as a deep sense of peace somewhere in the background, no matter what happens out there.<br /><br />Contrary to Tolle, the theory of cognitive psychology is that the mind is a busy computational device, very much like a computer, or a bio-machine.  But for Tolle, mental chatter and obsessive calculating is not our essence, its our \\"disease\\"!  The mind's incessant mental noise prevents us from finding that realm of inner stillness that is inseparable from Being. When Descartes declared \\"I think; therefore, I am,\\" he gave expression to modern humanity's most basic error. Thinking and consciousness are not synonymous, consciousness does not need thought. Once this single distinction is fully understood, Enlightenment will follow.<br /><br />Critique:<br /><br />Tolle writes that you are responsible for your inner space; nobody else is. But he assumes that anyone can become a \\"spiritual hero,\\" like he is.  Thus, he seems to be blind to some important facts of life.  One is that all people are not as spiritually gifted as he.  Another fact is that social and economic pressures make attaining Enlightenment impossible for most people.  And, a third blindness is to the ways by which people can act together to reduce those pressures and provide much needed support to one another in support groups.  He warns his readers not to become dependent on groups. To stay consistent with Humanistic psychology, he should find a way to integrate support groups into his program.

But he assumes that anyone can become a \\"spiritual hero,\\" like he is.  Thus, he seems to be blind to some important facts of life.  One is that all people are not as spiritually gifted as he.  Another fact is that social and economic pressures make attaining Enlightenment impossible for most people.

B000006E17|1.0|Boring and stupid.  Certainly there were shocking and disgusting, disturbing moments, but come on.  I can't believe I was able to sit through the whole movie.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|While Avril may not be as talented as Fiona Apple or Michelle Branch she still manages to make a great album by hiring some very talented co-writers. My fave track is definitely Together. This album is just full of catchy guitar pop. You know the kind of stuff you want to listen to on a Sunday evening. If you liked Let Go you will like this too. If you're more into underground death metal music perhaps this isn't for you!
B00004RF8J|5.0|This musical is soo cool! everyone was perfect for the part, lol steve martin just blew the screen off as dentist. soo funny. And Greene was the perfect Audrey. I can't picture Babara stresein (sp?) EVER having the squeaky/high voice Greene could do. That'll just be plain Oo!!!! weird! The songs are also awesome, specially the duets like \\"Suddenly Seymour\\" and \\"Downtown (Skid Row!)\\" also cool. <br /> <br />The movie doesn't have alot of meaning. basically a big evil plant using/manipulating the human, Seymour, to feed it. I like the original ending better. all this happy ending doesn't quite hit it since they omitted \\"Don't feed the plants!\\", but still a good movie with the song \\"green mean mother from outer space!\\".  <br />^_^
B0002Z1EG2|5.0|I purchased this album for my boyfriend.  He is a huge Shania Twain fan and we were both very pleased with the purchase.  It has all the great Shania songs on one CD, plus the 3 new songs.  We both were excited when the CD came out and rushed to the store to get it.  I have to give Shania a thumbs up on this one.  It is the best yet!! <br /> <br />
B00008H2LB|5.0|For all those of you posers listening to Slayer, Pantera, Lamb Of God, Shadows Fall, Anthrax, and Exodus; back off. If you dont like Linkin Park's wonderful music, don't review them. Linkin Park are more talented than Joe Satriani and Cliff Burton combined.  For other great metal check out Limp Bizkit, Korn, and Papa Roach
0786880708|5.0|I recommend this reading to anyone.  It is absolutely a phenomenol book that could quite possibly give you an entire new outlook on life.  The most inspiring book I've ever read. <br /> <br />Why not give it a try?
068987474X|4.0|I was skeptical at first about buying this book, as it's co-authored by two Sex and the City writers, not by licensed therapists. After reading mostly positive reviews of the book on Amazon, I bought it. Boy, am I really glad I did!  <br /> <br />Greg Behrendt and Liz Tuccillo aren't psychologists, but their insights on male/female relationships are both hysterical and extremely perceptive. You don't need a degree in psychology to understand that women deserve to be with men who treat them with respect and love, and not to waste their time on men who don't.  <br /> <br />It wasn't just the content that hooked me, but the way it was presented. Different relationship scenarios are described in detail, using a \\"question and answer\\" format in the guise of women writing to Greg looking for advice on their love lives. It was truly amazing how right on target the scenarios were, almost scary.  <br /> <br />I don't agree with his assertion that only men should the pursuing, though. Some men may need some help getting out of their shells, so to speak, and leaving it all up to them might lead to nothing happening at all. Some reviewers have said that Greg's point of view is chauvanistic. I didn't see that at all. As a matter of fact, I saw the exact opposite: all he really did through the book is encourage the reader to make the right descisions for herself and her well-being. How can that be bad?  <br /> <br />I just got out of a 6-year relationship, and a lot of what they had to say resonated with me. Instead of lamenting on what \\"could have been,\\" I'm taking the steps necessary to move on with my life. It helped me realize that I deserve to be with someone who *truly* wants to be with me, and not to \\"settle\\" for less.  <br /> <br />I'm not saying that this little book completely changed my life; after all, it's written by a comedian and a writer, respectively. However, it did give me the extra encouragement to learn from the past and have some hope regarding my adventuresin the always-unpredictable dating universe.  <br />
B00000JCB2|5.0|Many people say Korn is the best metal band, but I disagree. It would have to be Linkin Park or Limp Bizkit. I remember back in 99 I used to mosh to \\"faith\\" and \\"nookie\\". Boy, Fred is a genius. I met him at a concert a couple years ago, it was the best day of my life. <br /> <br />Rock on!
B000009RC2|5.0|the state of music in pop culture as of today is completely ridiculous. please, if you haven't already, buy this album to enjoy life to it's fullest extent. all your sins in actually liking the crap thats on the radio will be forgiven through buying this cd. whatever. this album is truely brilliant. phenominal musicianship.
0446677450|5.0|I notice that people are either very passionately in agreement with this book or passionately against it.  This the mark of a good book and a good author. <br /> <br />I like this book because the author presented some very visionary business ideas.  You may or may not get rich from them but it's hard to disagree with these concepts.  Concepts like: don't get into debt by buying \\"liabilities\\"; spend your money on things that will put money in your pocket; real estate is a good investment etc.  Face it, the guy is on the money. <br /> <br />Like I said, I like this book because of the concepts presented in it.  The fact that it's been bestseller since the beginning of time says alot as well.  To get more specific details about building businesses and building passive income the e-myth by Michael Gerber is a good book as well as Stop Working by Rohan Hall. <br /> <br />I think to get the full picture you'll have to read a few of these types of book.  Most are not good but some really are.  This one is one of the better ones that I've read so far.
B00005JKNF|5.0|I have never seen the end of an era captured so poignantly. I don't think I will ever forget seeing this film. The scene where the staff is cleaning up and the party is winding down and you can feel an era ending before your eyes, even before the people in the film realize it. <br /> <br />Altman is a genius and it is wonderful to have this movie and the great extras on DVD. Watch the Q&A's with the cast and Altman!
B0000DD7LB|5.0|One word. Fantastic cd. This is the only one I have of hers, partly because her first cds are more bubblegum pop which isn't really my style... but this cd is really really a step in a new direction, very alternative and urban.<br /><br />All of the songs are produced by some of the best and most well-known producers in the world (and just about every song was recorded in a different recording studio in a different state or country) and the beats are all something any young adult like me would listen to. Something I could play in my car or in a club and dance to.<br /><br />Well done Britney..... I especially like \\"Breathe On Me\\" and \\"Showdown\\" and \\"Touch of My Hand\\" which are awesome club songs. \\"Early Mornin'\\" was also a fantastic song.... and on a lighter note, \\"Everytime\\" shows off Britney's whispery voice and is well written as well.<br /><br />Turns out that Britney co-wrote most of the songs herself, way to go.... and I hope you do more like this!<br /><br />A new fan
077106506X|5.0|I'm somewhat ashamed to admit that I'm not familiar with this author, or at least wasn't until I read RUNAWAY: STORIES.  But what a fan I've become overnight!  This incredible look at the human condition and relationships is one of the most moving and enlightening reads I've come across in a while. In a way, I was reminded of Salinger's NINE SHORT STORIES with their insightful peering into the human heart. Some of these little stories are connnected, and, in fact, some of the stories are not so small.  Munro's narratives can sometimes take many pages, but there's a reason for each and every word.  I also very much enjoyed the collection of short stories by author Jackson McCrae, titled THE CHILDREN'S CORNER.  These too are brilliant and each one is expertly crafted and suited to the subject material the author is writing about.
B0002Y4T92|3.0|G.Bohn got it right with his review.  Very dissapointed with the song selection.  Many songs were left out of the Saturday night blues spectacular.  Every song gave me chills that night.  Robert Randolph was absolutely amazing on a couple of songs that were left out.  Jeff Beck's performce was one of the best Sunday night.  You could hear a pin drop throughout the song.  Simply amazing and yet it was left out.  Two songs by Vince Gill and only one by Santana.  And this was a guitar festival?  Needleass to say, this DVD set could have been significantly better.  I only hope the rest of the material is released soon.
B00005JNDX|2.0|I got dragged to this hideous feature by two female friends who had seen and loved the first film.  I hadn't, but I was filled in on the background before it began, and references were explained to me.    Basically, it's a romance involving an insecure fat girl (Renee Zellweger) and the two men who are competing for her affection. She is in love with an human rights lawyer (Colin Firth) whom she has been with for two whole months but finds herself occasionally drawn to a funny, charming, but ultimately slimy TV show host (Hugh Grant.)    I couldn't for the life of me figure out why anyone would be fighting over this woman. She's an idiot. She constantly humiliates Firth's character in front of his professional colleagues. She is completely inept at nearly everything. And none of this is even remotely cute or endearing. Conversely, I couldn't understand what she saw in her boyfriend, who has all the personality of the desk I'm sitting at. Oh, right, the shagging was good. We are reminded of that many, many times over. Grant's character is a jerk, but at least he's funny.    Zellweger is incredibly annoying, with her fake English accent and exaggerated mannerisms. Roger Ebert says he wanted to tickle her under her chin. I wanted to punch her in the eye.  Do women actually relate to this character?  That's so very sad.    Hugh Grant is the only entertaining thing in the movie. His scenes were the only times I genuinely laughed.    The film is nauseatingly sweet at the worst of times, and predictable as well. If you can't see what's coming when someone asks the main character to carry a souvenir item from Thailand in her luggage, then you just haven't seen enough movies. By the time Bridget is singing Madonna songs in a Thai prison, you'll be wanting to ram skewers into both your eyes and ears.    This isn't the worst film I've ever seen, but it is unquestionably the worst film I've seen in theaters in the past year.
B0001I561Y|5.0|The DVD picture and sound are fantastic.  I was surprised at how much better the picture looks compared to my (previously) treasured VHS copy.  The image is widescreen probably 1.78:1 vs. the old 1.33:1 so it gives about 20% more on each side and about 10% more on the top also. the bottom was kept about the same. (I compared a few scenes vs. the old VHS). looks great on an HDTV, showing delicate hues of color all over the place, unseen on the vhs copy. <br />The sound options are great, too. <br />Boxed set doesn't offer much value. it's priced a lot higher than the dvd alone, and all you get is a very average book where they even placed pictures over the spine of the book so it's right over Jasmine or Aladdin's body or head sometimes. The large section with the artists sketches is ok, but I didn't find a lot of value in those, unless you want a copy of each artist's autograph.  The negative is pretty nice if you own a scanner, but a photo of the same image on the box or insert would have been enough for me, so I don't think the extra money spend of those items is worth the extra value.  I got it because this is a one time release, though anyway and it's been a long wait for this to get to DVD. <br />They changed the artwork on the DVD, and that was unnecessary .  The original artwork they put on the VHS was better. On the DVD version they have Aladdin in his prince type outfit, but in this movie he's just got that blue vest the whole time so they shouldn't have changed the original artwork. The boxed set has the night scene of the 'cave of wonders' but I was hoping for artwork of the gang on the box. They should have put some of those great animated characters on the box like Aladdin, Jasmine and the rest of the characters instead of that cave.
B00009V7T2|5.0|This is one of the best albums I've ever heard and I'm hurt to see it get so many negative reviews...particularly when those reviews consist of little more than some meaningless profanity and a declaration that stories cannot be told without proper grammer. I think the problem these people have is that they simply don't understand artistic license. The Mars Volta use lyrics that don't necessarily make sense as a whole, but create an impression of what is happening in the story. This doesn't mean they can't write. This simply means that they don't subscribe to the Dashboard Confessional School of Storytelling (\\"I put on a shirt. Now I am trying to decide what shoes to wear. I want to impress a girl.\\"). People tend to criticize subtlety and ambiguity, which I find incredibly sad. It was that type of thinking that had E.E. Cummings labeled as an untalented hack in his own time because he used words outside of their part of speach. The Mars Volta does very much the same thing with lyrics like \\"track marked amoeba lands craft, cartwheel of scratches\\". If you see creativity as a lack of talent, then maybe you would be happier with a Jimmy Buffet cd or anything by any christian band. Anyway, if you have the ability to appreciate art, or even beauty, then \\"De-loused in the Comatorium\\" is a brilliantly crafted musical experience that you won't be able to take out of your cd player. <br /> <br />The Mars Volta = unbelievably awesome band!!!!
B00005R87O|5.0|It is really difficult for me to pick my #1 favorite vampire film between F. W's \\"Nosferatu\\" with Max Schreck or Bram Stoker's \\"Dracula\\" starring Bela Lugosi. These two films are the perfect reminders of how lighting and atmosphere can have an effect on the moviegoer without a whole lot of special effects. I guess I would have to say \\"Nosferatu\\" is my favorite of the two films because Max Schreck simply gave me the creeps as Nosferatu. Nosferatu was nothing like Dracula. He was not handsome or suave like Dracula was. Nosferatu was and is the scariest looking vampire I have ever seen. None of the vampires today matches the scariness of Max Schreck and this movie was made in 1929. What also makes \\"Nosferatu\\" work so well is the gestures of Max Schreck's character like the way Nosferatu would look at someone (or something) before his head would turn. Then there is in the boat when he rises up from his sleep and out of his coffin. For a time when there was no CGI or any sort of high tech special effects, that scene alone was pure magic. I still get a lot of joy watching that particular scene. The film may be grainy and with a minimal storyline but I don't mind. I think it is still one of the best vampire films out there today. All the special effects in \\"Van Helsing\\" or even \\"Underworld\\" could not capture the eeriness or creepiness of \\"Nosferatu\\".
B00005JNEI|2.0|\\"How can you possibly discuss foreign policies in the middle east without mentioning Israel and its ties with the US ??\\"<br /><br />So one of these reviewers asked. How can you... well, USA exterior policy gives a huge S**T to Israel and whatever happen there between palestins and Israel. Let them blow themselves UP! All the money is going to Iraque War and let me know why they're still there. Sadam isnt there anymore. Mass Destruction Weapons werent there at any time. Probably Osama isnt. So Why? Vietnam didnt want USA provisory government and neither Iraque people will accept it.
B0000AZJXQ|4.0|Though I haven't reviewed it yet, i would give their debut five out of five.  Don't get me wrong, i really like this album but there is just too much filler for my tastes.  Two of the tracks are just short filler interludes.  This normally wouldn't be that big of a deal if the rest of the album was strong.  Which, this is a strong album but not as strong at their debut.   <br /> <br />with this release they are sounding too much like tool, who I hate.  Yeah ok, they really sound nothing like tool but lots of elements (softer parts, ambience, slight progressive side to songs) are coming into play here.  <br /> <br />What i loved about APC so much was that they were totally seperate from tool.  their debut was very much a standard hard rock album, very depressing too.  But with this release they don't rock nearly as hard, they have gotten very very soft and more progressive.   <br /> <br />With all that mumbo jumbo being said, I will actually say some good things about this record, because I actually like it.   <br /> <br />Though the guitars have lost a lot of luster, the drumming has only gotten better.  Honestly, this is some of the best drumming i've heard in a LONG time.  Josh just simply slays on the drum kit.   <br /> <br />Maynard's vocals are yet again very soft spoken but it has a dark tone to it, a disturbing feel which adds to the overall atmosphere of this album.  The last album was pretty depressing but this time around it's more dark and moody, with the bass adding a dark undertone to contrast with the light picking of the guitar.   <br /> <br />All in all, a excellent cd by a very talented band but not as good as their debut.  Worth your money!
0140277447|5.0|It is the first book in English to reveal the bloody Japanese Invation of China and very well written. I am very very sad to hear the death of Iris Chang. She is forever my hero.
B0002BO0AS|5.0|The most noticable thing about this release is the drumming.  it's a high step above most metal bands these days (such as shadows fall, atreyu or killswitch engage) and the music is much more thought out.   <br /> <br />Each song contains several different riffs. Often times, they have thin melodic thrash riffs then a heavier break down.  Each song is just varied itelf though not to the progressive sense.  <br /> <br />Despite what others may say about their singer, I do enjoy him a great deal. He screams/shouts but you can understand what he is saying, much in the vein of pantera's phil anselmo, though they sound NOTHING alike.  Their are spurts of clean vocals here and there (like god forbid do) and his clean voice is really good, i hope he sings more of it later on in their musical career.
B00005JNJ7|5.0|To think, I almost missed this movie at the box office.  My excuse was something like \\"puppets?\\".  If anything, puppets have always caused me that queasiness many get from clowns, or the movie Deliverance for that matter.  I couldn't see how puppets...i'm sorry, \\"marionettes\\" could make for a gripping action/comedy.<br /><br />How wrong I was.<br /><br />The creators (Trey Parker and Matt Stone) who busted our guts with paper cutouts (as in South Park) have once again opened up a new front for their sometimes political, often insightful, and always hilarious expression.  In the first 10 seconds of the movie any pretense or prejudice I had around puppets immediately evaporated.<br /><br />Team America: World Police is a hyper-dramatic odyssey set in modern times.  The movie follows a crack team of American Commandos in their pursuit of \\"terrorism\\".  The protagonists are good natured and simple to the point of absurdity, the antagonists are evil to the point of absurdity.<br /><br />What a fantastic way to make a point.<br /><br />And that they do.  This movie is rife with micro-lessons/criticisms on everything from world politics, to popular culture.  In the creators typical style, they push every character to their absolute extreme, then lay them against a background of total chaos.  What you get are puppets laying waste to every national treasure they end up in a firefight in, then claiming \\"everything is OK, you're all safe, we got the terrorists\\" while the broken Eiffel Tower is laying on top of the Arc De Triumph in Paris against a smoldering backdrop of the Louvre.  Good times.<br /><br />I would be wary of anyone that didn't find this movie hilarious (or at least very entertaining).  For those of you that haven't seen it yet, you have something to look forward to.  For those that have, consider seeing it again, I did, and found it to be (in many ways) funnier the second time around.<br /><br />Enjoy,<br /><br />Christian Hunter<br /><br />Santa Barbara, CaliforniaBarbara, California <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
068484267X|5.0|Frank McCourt has a rare gift for storytelling, that is evident throughout this autobiographical novel. It could not have been easy to write such a book, let alone such a book about your own family. His childhood was amazingly difficult, his parents were hardly able to take care of themselves, let alone 2 children and innumerable dead babies. The Ireland McCourt shows us is divided, cold, rainy, chauvanistic and impoverished. A country that inspires its citizens to love it and hate it simultaneously. <br /> <br />This is a fascinating story, that many of us with Irish relatives can relate to stories we heard growing up about the old country. I find the book to be much better than the movie and would recommend it to anyone who wants to read an well written, moving, true story. <br />
0553801503|4.0|I have to agree with everybody that this is a great series.  Keep in mind though, that Martin never really finishes much of anything in the first three books, so to say that its a series is almost a misnomer.  You could probably just glue them all together to make one book...
B000003N7K|5.0|This CD, \\"John Coltrane and Johnny Hartman,\\" is one of the greatest jazz masterpieces of all-time! Allow yourself to be swept away by this mesmerizing music courtesy of one of the finest saxophonists in the jazz scene, John Coltrane, and one of the greatest vocalists, Johnny Hartman. Together they will beguile your ears with this all-time favorite CD from my collection. Backing Coltrane and Hartman are McCoy Tyner on piano, Elvin Jones on drums and Jimmy Garrison on bass.<br /><br />John Coltrane, a remarkable composer in his own right, had worked with other jazz greats such as Miles Davis, Dizzy Gillespie and Thelonious Monk, among many others. Some of his most significant CDs include \\"My Favorite Things,\\" \\"Blue Train\\" and \\"A Love Supreme.\\"<br /><br />The standouts include an all-time favorite of mine, \\"My One And Only Love,\\" a composition by Guy Wood and Robert Mellin. This gem of a song has the power to enthrall your ears and capture your heart and soul with the duo's superb rendition. Many jazz aficionados believe that this is the most enchanting and stunningly beautiful version ever recorded in the entire jazz history. And ditto with an Irving Berlin classic, \\"They Say It's Wonderful.\\" These are the most beautiful songs from this CD. I always listen to these tracks with a few repeats. Also notables are Sammy Cahn's \\"Dedicated To You\\" and Billy Strayhorn's \\"Lush Life.\\"<br /><br />Experience the magic of this CD...and you'll never stop listening to it. It's pure perfection and completely captivating.<br /><br />With my heartfelt recommendation for your listening pleasure always and forever.<br /><br />* * * * *TEN STARS * * * * *
B00005JNEU|4.0|While it doesn't have quite the impact the book has, the movie \\"Friday Night Lights\\" is definitely better than many other sports movies. This one is up there among Hoosiers and Remember the Titans. <br /> <br />For those unfamiliar with the tale - this movie is about the Permian High School Panthers, of Odessa, Texas. It is the 1988 season, and expectations are high, with a star-studded roster, and many key returnees.  <br /> <br />The back story, however, is what makes the book, and thus the movie - compelling. This is not merely a season-long documentary of the team and their deeds on the field of competition. It is more about what makes them what they are off the field.  <br /> <br />Odessa is a declining oil town in the wasteland that is the Permian Basin, a desert-like landscape nearly oppressive in its endless sameness. The townspeople of Odessa draw virtually their whole sense of community pride, self-esteem and well-being from how well the Panthers perform on the football field. Unfortunately, these are not professional football players, but merely 17-year-old boys who, because of the intense pressure on them to perform, cannot possibly life the carefree life of the normal 17-year-old.  <br /> <br />The movie spends a lot of time on the choreographed football sequences, which are great, but also explores some of the issues surrounding the players and their lives off the field - some have abusive fathers, some feel inexorably tied down by family obligations, others feel like they're just marking time before they go on to bigger and better things. <br /> <br />While some liberty was taken with the book, the essence of it was not lost, and the melancholy pacing of the film is appropriate to how one feels when reading the book.
B0002KVUKM|1.0|I only saw this movie in the theaters because my friends invited me and boy did we get a big laugh!  For one thing, that random turn Dracula did with his one arm outstretched was beyond unnecessary (we're still debating the point of that).  I found this movie to be cheesy and way over the top.  It is full of one-liners that in the end make the movie more corny.  The only ohter good thing about it is &#60;3Hugh Jackman&#60;3 and laughing at random parts.
B0002Z1EG2|5.0|Shania Twain knows how to treat her fans.  And this Greatest Hits album is no exception.  She's packed 21 tracks -- 17 of her biggest hits, and 3 new songs -- on this one CD, just for us.  \\"Party for Two\\" is one of the sexiest, most fun songs she's ever done.  \\"Don't!\\" is so beautiful, probably her best ballad.  \\"I Ain't No Quitter\\" is just a fun country song.  These songs exemplify what Shania has always been about -- the music.  These are songs that make you smile when you've had the worst day -- make you try one more time instead of giving up hope.  Shania Twain writes songs that are honest, that her fans can relate to.  She's also written every song on the album, except \\"You Win My Love,\\" written by her husband, R.J. Lange.  Hopefully everyone will come to appreciate the career she's accomplished.
0448060191|5.0|I'm writing this review, not to tell you the classic story of Little Women, but to strongly advise you to buy this beautiful hardcover.  I was amazed to find this very one on Amazon, because my mom gave me this version 23 years ago, for Christmas!  I'd already read Little Women at least twice before she gave me this book.  The pictures and layout of the book drew me in to read that book countless more times!  Even now, I glance through the illustrations and remember how they enhanced my numerous readings.  This is the perfect gift for a 10 year old girl (that was the age I received this), because she will keep it forever!
B0001MDP3G|3.0|as much as I liked certain parts of Cold Mountain, I disliked other elements as much.  <br /> <br />the pros: Jude Law. Great performance, and I'd watch him sorting laundry for almost three hours any ole day of the week. Renee Z., who I find to be one of our more overrated actresses of the day, was excellent. Although I disagree with her winning the Oscar (hello Academy, Shohreh Aghdashloo from House of Sand & Fog) she was perfect in her role as Ruby, although I understand in the book she was a mulatto character, which pisses me off since a bevy of black or mulatto actresses could have played it as good or better (Thandie Newton, Vivica Fox). But again, it's the first performance of hers truly worthy of accolades. The supporting cast was also fine, especially Phillip Seymour Hoffman, as per usual.  <br /> <br />Anthony Minghella's directing was outstanding, as was the cinematography. Their opening battle sequence was a horrifying stunner.  <br /> <br />Cons: Nicole Kidman. I find her wooden throughout and she and Law share no chemistry whatsoever, which renders their longing for true love story impotent, thus killing off a major theme of the movie. And she was in full makeup even when she was struggling in poverty and famine. What gives? i guess her contract specifies she must look radiant at all times.  <br /> <br />The neverending monologues about the ravages of war were over the top. I get it. Stop Pontificating Already. As timely as this theme is, it is overplayed. I was reminded of Braveheart where Mel Gibson gives the same 'freedom' speech three-hundred times. I get it. I get it. I get it. Nuff said.  <br /> <br />All in all, worth-seeing for the technical artistry and the fine Law and supporting cast. Kidman and the screenplay turn this 'could have been a masterpiece' into an afternoon of Masterpiece Theatre, albeit on a large budget.
0765301598|2.0|I have to say I was somewhat disappointed with the whole book. Don't get me wrong, it was a huge effort to get the stories right and to take over Frank Herbert's Dune story, however, something was lacking. I felt like I was being led blindfolded through a maze of stitched up brainstormed ideas. Caution though, SPOILERS BELOW (sorry!). <br /> <br />1. The characters were too shallow and 2 dimensional with colorfully added titles like Supreme Bashar, Primero, Viceroy etc. Do we really need all that? It makes the whole book almost (God Forbid!) Star Wars-like! I could even start drawing parallels, Omnius is to Emperor Palpatine as Vorian Atreides is to Luke Skywalker? <br /> <br />2. The House Harkonnen/Atreides feud started like that? Gee, and I thought my cats and dogs had better fights! A minor military disagreement that ended up as a murderous feud between the bloodlines? This was the feud that I was actually looking forward to finding out how it started. It ended up as rumors, gossips, myths and fables handed down through generations. Romeo and Juliet anyone? A plague on both their houses literally! <br /> <br />3. The plague was only scratching the surface of the story. If Omnius wanted the humans wiped out, it would have been 100% mortality not just 43% +/-!  I would have thought something more devious, like a gene-select bioweapon that targets selective genes like good eyesight, intelligence, body mass etc. Or something that targetted and killed off the females, so the males wouldn't have breeding partners and would die off naturally. But I guess the Dune universe had to survive somehow. The pirahna mites were a huge joke, I think they ran out of ideas. <br /> <br />4. 20 years and the machines couldn't find a way to destroy the Holtzmann satellites that imprisoned them? Come on! What about some new faster than fold space ships? Omnius couldn't even develop that? If the Ixians could build no-ships, and Omnius couldn't, then it isn't as smart a thinking machineas we think it is! No wonder humanity destroyed it!(or did they? hmm...) <br /> <br />5. Agamemnon was foolish enough to trust Vorian to remove his brain canister from his walker body? I really find that very, very hard to believe, seriously! <br /> <br />Well, I guess through all that, we find out the origins of the Spacing Guild. How the Mentats were founded, although it was too convenient! The beginnings of the Bene Gesserit. And how Corrinos and Harkonnens are actually the same bloodline!  <br /> <br />Still, I'm looking forward to BH & KJA ending our eternal wait (torment) for Dune 7. I pray it will have more depth and surprises than these prequels.
B00004S8OP|4.0|This C.D. is amazing. I'm absolutly in love with alot of the songs on the DVD so I bought the C.D. as well. My favourites are 'Belle', 'Le temps des Cathdrales', 'Dchir', 'Le val d'amour'. It's a great C.D. I recommend it if you like french play type songs.
0783232039|2.0|This movie wasn't scary at all and yes there were a few laughs here and there but overall this movie was not ment to be scary.  There is lots of humor in this film unlike the previous CP films. <br /> <br />Jennifer tilly is pretty average in this film, Chucky is the man..I guess?...And this movie wasn't all that funny either with a lame ass ending to now is SEED of CHUCKY. <br /> <br />Over all this movie could have bin better but well...Not.... <br /> <br />I give this 2 out 5 <br /> <br />Then again I can't force you to not watch it but I'm warning you.....this film is pretty...well......Stupid <br /> <br />Lates
B0002XH9Z4|5.0|This will blow you away! This is truly the best from the King of Pop...need I mention he is a genius and 100% INNOCENT! This is truly a masterpiece. Get it! I just did!
B00005JNEI|1.0|Reminded me of JFK...but way more obvious in its intent.  I love the way Moore interspersed shots of people crying next to Bush smiling and laughing, as if the two unrelated shots meant that Bush was somehow laughing at their pain.  Multiply by two hours of more of same.   <br /> <br />I feel sorry for the people voting for Kerry solely on the strength of this movie (I know people who are doing this) without taking the time to research the facts.  Do you trust that everything Moore says is gospel truth?  Do you research ballot questions or just vote how Barbara Streisand tells you to?  Do you seek out various sources of news, not just one local paper or Hollywood movie? <br /> <br />I am not saying that I am a fervent Bush supporter.  What I try to be is someone who takes in new information with a skeptic's mind.  I find other channels of information with which to compare my current channels.   <br /> <br />I hope that other voters don't blindly trust somebody who makes major motion pictures to take their hands and lead them to the truth.  Please take unreferenced statements with several hundred grains of salt. <br />
B00063MBU8|5.0|This CD is amazing. It's uplifting, entertaining and easy to relate to. Different from their debut album, more of these tracks can be related to late teens, early adults which fits, not only for me, but because they are maturing. The music is technically more impressive, especially with more harmonies, something that was missing generally from their previous release.  <br />Generally this disc is great, and a very successful second album. I'm sure the band will have plenty of hits with it.
0156027321|4.0|At first, I hated this book. I got about to the middle and I just couldn't go on. It was so boring that I couldn't stand it- the fact that Pi practiced three religions seemed not to add anything to the story. But, when I was really bored, I started reading it again. I finished it within a day- it turned out to be an amazing story! I don't know about it making me believe in God, but it made me think about it more than I ever had. The story was sad and hopeless yet \\"uplifting\\" at the same time. I am eagerly awaiting Martel's next book, and I will read it as soon as it comes out.

0316666343|3.0|I really enjoyed the book at first. It had an interesting and unique view of life and death. However, the ending was completely random and rediculous. I won't give away the ending, but those of you who have read it know what I'm talking about. It's given more credit than it deserves.

B00000IL26|5.0|I'm outraged at the previous reviewers because nobody mentioned a track called GARY'S NOTEBOOK. Which happens to be my favorite track. And even though Joe Henderson got off some great stuff on NOTEBOOK, I'm more impressed by Lee's 3-note-shtick solo. NOTEBOOK also wouldn't be complete without one of Lee's goofadelic squelch-notes. (Which you can hear shortly before the start of Barry Harris's piano solo.)
B00005JMUL|5.0|First of all anyone who is reviewing this movie strictly based on the trailer is nothing short of a huge fool. <br /> <br />Second, I had the opportunity to see it in the 3D IMAX version. I can remember as a child wondering what it would be like to be inside a snow globe. While I was sitting there I felt surrounding by the falling snow, the first thought that came to me was \\"THIS is what it would be like to be inside one!!\\" <br /> <br />I cant comment on the regular version. But the 3D IMAX was so very definately going a few extra miles and and few extra $$. <br /> <br />I highly recommend it
0395389496|5.0|This is a favorite book from childhood. I received it for Christmas at age seven and every year thereafter we read it as a family at Christmastime. I remember going off to bed with wonderful visions of magic and the North Pole. The illustrations are phenomenal. I'm thrilled it's been made into a movie by Tom Hanks. I've yet to see it, but I have blissful expectations of being taken back into my fantasy world for a whole 95 minutes.
B000002UAU|5.0|Why visit the Beatles section on Amazon.com at all, if not to enjoy it and to celebrate it. Only morons who listen to moron music of today could criticize this album. Blink 182, Avril Lasagna, Backstreet Boys??? Really??? What are they anyway? They are being forgotten as this review is going up. A reviewer, if one can call him that, feels that the Beatles will be forgotten in a couple of years? It's 40 years since the Beatles first came on the scene, and their music is as alive as ever, and has affected the world in so many ways. It has defined pop culture since 1964, and had a profound influence on every generation since then.
B0000019PA|5.0|This is one of the best CD's that I have ever spend my money on.  THe way that Jeff Magnum sings is so thoroughly depressing that is is absolutely gorgeous.  The lyrics on this album are amazing.  If you consider yourself to have good taste in music, and you dont like this CD, you do not have taste at all.   <br />The Cd starts strong with \\"King of Carrot Flowers pt. 1\\" which ends with magnum singing \\"Dad would dream of all the different ways to die, each one a little more than he could dare to try\\".  It then flows into the next song, pt. 2&3.  That is one thing that I like about it is its flow.  All the songs seem to weave together into a tapestry that is so amazingly beautiful.  BUY THIS CD.
6304539258|5.0|This film, in my opinion, is one of the best movies ever made.  Until this movie was originally released in 1977, most sci-fi movies were low-budget films with spaceships flying around on fishing lines with fake fire coming out from behind.  This movie changed all that.  In this movie, one gets to see awesome spaceships with colored lasers shooting at each other, as well as cool weapons like the light saber and blaster pistol, not to mention droids and strange creatures. <br /> <br />George Lucas' Star Wars vision has spawned five (soon to be six) classic movies that will remain classics for many years to come.  Fans such as myself will continue to watch them over and over with the same enthusiasm as if we were seeing them for the first time.  The characters have become household names; Luke, Leia, Han, Chewbacca, R2-D2, C3PO, Darth Vader, etc.  Much like \\"Gone With the Wind\\" from the 1930s', Star Wars has stood the test of time and remains as popular today as it was thirty years ago. <br /> <br />Needless to say, I give this movie my highest recommendation.  The special effects are tremendous, but the story and character development is what truly draws the viewer in and never lets them go.  A camradarie develops between the viewer and characters, and we truly empathize with them.  There are also some new scenes in this edition, released in 1997 to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the theatrical release, that are not in earlier versions, such as Jabba's visit to Han at Mos Eisley.  Watch this timeless movie and experience the thrill of an epic battle between good and evil.
B0002XH9Z4|5.0|Been a bit out of it lately without any Jackson fix. Well your in for a big surprise when you purchase this ultimate box set of Jackson. Not only will it blow your sox off. It makes you realize why your a fan, why you love the guy, why he's the greatest entertainer there is. If your \\"not\\" a fan, you \\"will\\" be by the time you hear the music. The collection is one you can't be without. The newer songs, \\"Someone Put your hand out,\\" \\"Someone in the Dark,\\" \\"Cheater,\\"  are just a few songs that show what an icon, legend Jackson really is he is  today...tomorrow and forever. A Collection that is worth every dime. A must have ...a great Christmas gift.
B0000AR8NK|5.0|The Bowie detractors will be having a bad year. From the opening number New Killer Star to the haunting, timeless, Jazz Club in the Pressure Dome feel of Bring Me The Disco King, David once again stamps his authority on the floundering music industry. <br /> <br />While ever the Duke can still produce stunning albums like Reality and Heathen, the Bowie bashers will continue to look like the losers that they are.  <br /> <br />This is a remarkable album and yet more evidence of the Man's inventive and unique songwriting skills. Years ago, during the Punk/New Wave era, the British Music press carried a David Bowie ad for albums like Low and Heroes, entitled 'There's New Wave, there's Old Wave, and there's Bowie'. Hype? I don't think so. He really is that good. A truly unique talent, who follows nobody. <br /> <br />David's seemingly endless ability to re-invent himself, whether it be in an Industrial, Retro  or Dance context, is the key to his success. Just when you think you've figured out his next move, he throws in a creative curve ball.  <br /> <br />An outstanding album and one that I have yet to stop playing. For my money, Reality and Heathen are two of the best albums since the many classics of his earlier years, up to the superb Let's Dance. <br /> <br />It just doesn't get any better.
B000002KO1|4.0|This is really the debut of Chrissie Hynde as the modern woman in rock. Before the late 1970s, women had the choice of being faux men like Janis Joplin or the chanteuse out of setting like Nico: with the arrival of Chrissie and Debbie Harry and Siouxie Sioux  we had the option of being who we are in a truly rock setting. Chrissie was, and is, the best of the Class of 1978: a thoroughgoing woman in a thoroughly rock band, not trying to be a man, not playing the Marilyn card and hanging out with New York glitterati who had nothing to do with rock. She played her music her way, gave birth to two healthy kids and kept them out of the limelight, and stood up for her beliefs even though it has cost her a lot professionally and personally. I love Chrissie both musically and as a symbol of true female class and power. (I don't mean to disrespect Debbie Harry at all, but she is really a fifties era pop star born too late, and except for Clem Burke, her 'boys' aren't remotely in the same class as Chrissie's.)
B00001OH7U|5.0|Even by David's standards, this was a truly classic album. <br /> <br />While Station To Station was a move in a Dance direction on the heels of Young Americans, it was also a solid Rock album, which features a superb rhythm section, driven by the exceptional guitar work of Earl Slick (Carlos Alomar on rhythm) and which yielded all time classics such as the title track, the incomparable Stay and David's vocal showcase, Wild Is The Wind. <br /> <br />There are many truly essential Bowie albums, and this is one of the pivotal ones, along with Let's Dance. I cannot recommend this highly enough. Like our Army Vet reviewer bud, I have found that I can track many of my major Life events by a given David album. This man wrote the soundtrack of our lives, as he has continued to do on the stunning Reality album. <br /> <br />A landmark album, for David and for modern music.
B0002KPIQY|4.0|This is really an excellent film and it rightly catapulted Jolie to stardom.  Her performance here is outstanding.  If this had not been an HBO film, she probably would have won an Oscar. It is a beautifully filmed gut-wrenching story.  Not for the prudish certainly, but for those heartier souls, this is a real winner.
B0002Z1EG2|5.0|While I must say the entire album is 5 star material, I'm still feeling a bit odd having a Shania Greatest Hits album; afterall, whenever I've bought one of her albums, it always felt like a Greatest Hits compilation given the number of singles released + fan favorites not released. She truly is a great artist. <br /> <br />One note I must make is that while I had always hoped for a Hits cd, I was hoping it wouldn't come until after her next album. But instead, this one comes a bit early of that and on the downside, also fails to showcase any of her debut album, which I never had plans on buying in hopes that a GH album would showcase it. Afterall, the debut was always thought of as \\"obsolete\\" compared to the albums that followed and only worth the singles. Why aren't they here? \\"What Made You Say That\\" and \\"Dance With The One That Brought You\\" are only 2 tracks. <br /> <br />Nonetheless, the album is simply stunning and features 4 new tracks to go in addition to any fan's collection. \\"Party For Two\\" is possibly one of Shania's all-time greatest (although my favorite single by her, \\"When You Kiss Me,\\" was ommitted..hmm...) and the other new tracks sound great as well.  <br /> <br />And to those that say outside the 4 new tracks everything is what they already have on their albums: WRONG. The cd opens up with the POP RADIO MIX of \\"Forever And For Always,\\" which is edited differently from any of its (3) album versions. Following it comes the video version of IGGG, which sounds somewhere inbetween the country & pop LP versions, but was never exactly released. Also not on her other albums are this albums versions of \\"That Don't Impress Me Much\\" and \\"From This Moment.\\" \\"That Don't\\" comes in the form of a dance mix, while FTM comes in its SOLO (rather than duet) form, and rather than being in the pop mix of THAT that's found on the International Version, it comes with something different to the beat. <br /> <br />This album isn't exactly going to \\"steal your money\\" or make \\"all the other Shania albums obsolete\\" or anything, with it having 8 tracks that don't appear on her other albums, and it missing several of her singles. Megahits \\"She's Not Just A Pretty Face,\\" \\"God Bless The Child,\\" \\"You Got A Way,\\" \\"Home Ain't Where His Heart Is (Anymore,\\" and \\"Ka-Ching!\\" don't make any appearances here, and neither do the flop singles \\"When You Kiss Me,\\" \\"It Only Hurts When I'm Breathing,\\" or \\"Thank You Baby!\\". Buy it, you won't regret it. <br /> <br />If that doesn't help you make your decision, the artwork has lots of new pictures of her, PLUS the lyrics to every one of the songs included and a picture from each video with it. Oh, and did I mention it comes with a $5 coupon for the Scent Stories player? <br />=D
B0006IIPIK|5.0|This is my kind of movie. Pure imagination driven, action/adventure fun. It couldn't have been any better in my opinion.
B0000AMRJC|5.0|Okay, so I'm stealing a great line from Al Pacino!  But let me tell you something.  This movie goes down as one of my favorite movies of all time.  Not my most favorite, mind you, but definitely up there in the top 10!<br /><br />The first time I saw this movie, back in the mid 80's, I was just at the end of highschool, and had started college.  A couple buddies of mine and my brother went to see Scarface and find out what the fuss was all about!<br /><br />We walked out, awestricken!  What an incredibly emotionally charged experience watching Scarface for the first time.  Seeing Al Pacino on the big screen, playing something other than an Italian-American; bad guy Cuban Mafioso punk!  His curse laden slurring pronunciation of words has influenced many poor imitators including comedian Dana Carvy all the way to Tony Soprano!  The storyline has also branched off several imitators, from videogames to B-Rated Movies, hell, even A-Rated movies.  But nothing compares to the original!<br /><br />Do I need to tell you the story?  Probably not.  Maybe it's more fun to just shout out some great quotes and favorite parts of the film.<br /><br />Favorite Quotes:<br /><br />1) \\"Say hello to my little friend!\\"  My college-hood buddy always insisted the line was:  \\"I want you to meet my little friend!\\" but I always knew the truth.<br /><br />2) \\"I never f'ed nobody, didn't have it coming to him.\\"<br /><br />3) \\"In this country, you gotta make the money first. Then when you get the money, you get the power. Then when you get the power, then you get the women.\\"<br /><br />4) Tony Montana: Me, I want what's coming to me.<br />Manny: Oh, well... what's coming to you?<br />Tony Montana: The world, Chico, and everything in it.<br /><br />5) Dat chick he's with - she like me.<br /><br />6) You wanna waste my time? Okay. I call my lawyer. He's the best lawyer in Miami. He's such a good lawyer, that by tomorrow morning, you gonna be working in Alaska. So dress warm.<br /><br />I'm sure you all can think of many more, I'm sure.  All in all, this movie is excellent, and provides a lot of bang for you buck, in a gratuitioutous sort of way!<br /><br />My type of movie.  And on top of all this, directed by Brian De Palma, my favorite all time director.  Two W's up, way up!lot of bang for you buck, in a gratuitioutous sort of way!    My type of movie.

B00005JKN9|2.0|One has high expectations for any Scorsese film, as a result of triumphs such as \\"Taxi Driver\\" and \\"Goodfellas.\\"  He is one of the great American directors, and on top of that, the man really loves film as an art form.  As a result, it's particularly disappointing when a Scorsese film misses the mark.<br /><br />This movie tried so hard to be an epic that it failed in the most basic departments of story and characterization.  The enormous sets, the costuming, the size of the crowds--all of it screams \\"hey, I'm an epic!\\"  But ultimately this movie is a collection of trappings of an epic film badly stitched together into something much less than the sum of its parts.  For the three solid hours that we spend with the characters, we never know any of them (other than Bill Cutting) very well, nor does a coherent plot ever coalesce.  And although the performances are generally quite good, neither DeCaprio nor Bill the Butcher ever quite figure out what accent they want to use and stick with it.  Indeed, about every third line of Bill's sounds like Fat Tony from the Simpsons, and the others sound like standard American English.  And what was up with the ending?  Both anticlimactic and somewhat baffling, it makes the viewer wonder why he just sat through three hours of film.<br /><br />If this movie had been about an hour shorter and focused more on substance than style, it would have been a real winner.  As is, this is best rented, and only if you have 3 hours of time on your hands for something that you probably won't like very much.
B000002AZ8|5.0|Pearl Jam- Vitalogy (1994) Pearl Jam's third great offering... Hey, its me doing another Pearl Jam review, since the band is so good. Their greatest hits finally came out today, awsome! :-D I just felt like writing a review for another one of their albums since its out today.<br /><br />This was their 3rd release, as I said, also their most dark & experimental. (well maybe No Code is more experimental, but I havent heard it yet) But this one is expermintal all the way, hence the non-song experiments Pry. To, Aye Davanta, Bugs, & Hey Foxymorphandlemama, That's Me/Stupid Mop (I'll talk about them later) This also is probably their heaviest release to date, the later are probably much different & more mellow (Yield most certinaly is.) We have the great power ballads (Nothingman, Betterman, Immortality), the upbeat (Corduroy, Last Exit, Not For You, Spin The Black Circle), and the dark and heavy (Satan's Bed, Whipping, Tremor Christ), and most of them are awsome. Here's the song-by-song list like always...<br /><br />1. Last Exit: Great opner, a bluesy intro, but don't let that fool you, it gets pumped up 10 seconds after. One of the best on the disc. (9/10)<br /><br />2. Spin The Black Circle: A punk rocker telling you to never give up your vinyls, vinyls are good anyway, since their memories for your parents when they were in high school & all that. (8/10)<br /><br />3. Not For You: A minor hit from the album, at least its on Rearviewmirror The Hits. I think it shouldve been much bigger, awsome song, probably the best on the album, hard rocker. About no one in particular in youth. (10/10)<br /><br />4. Tremor Christ: One of the heaviest, another minor hit, very sadly too, it wasnt included on Rearviewmirror, which is even worse. One of the heaviest intros to a song ever. Eddie is great lyrically. (10/10)<br /><br />5. Nothingman: Things soften up a little, a hit from the album. A ballad about defeat, very intresting. (8/10)<br /><br />6. Whipping: Back to the rockin, another one of the heaviest on the album, heavy as hell beat & lyrics. (9/10)<br /><br />7. Pry. To: The 1st experimental song, and it sucks! Nothing going on but guitars & Eddie singing something that probably no one's figured out. he dosnt even say what it says 3 pages after Nothingman in the booklet! (3/10)<br /><br />8. Curdroy: Another hit, im sure everyones heard it once. Kick-ass. The lyrics don't mean anything, still one of the best besides that. (8/10)<br /><br />9. Bugs: 2nd experiment, although it seems like a real song since its less than 3 minutes. Kinda funny, but we all know its one of the dumbest things to use on an album ever. We don't need you whining about bugs everywhere, Eddie. And why do you sound so high pitched at the end??? Also a VERY annoying accordian. (5/10)<br /><br />10. Satan's Bed: Kind of an experiment, but I won't concider it one. Among the heaviest song on the album, with especially heavy lyrics. It's not satanic, don't worry, its just about no one in particular accusing Eddie as a satanist. But its someone else in love with him, thank nobody. Not that I want Eddie to be satanic though, obviously. (9/10)<br /><br />11. Better Man: The biggest hit on the album, also one of PJ's biggest hits. Everyone's heard it, so no need to say anything more, other than it sort of reminds me of Dave Matthews for some reason. (10/10)<br /><br />12. Aye Davanita: Oh god, another damn expirement. All of them are soo boring. Just some shaman type chantings that don't mean anything mixed with guitars. The guitars aren't neccicarily bad anyway. (2/10)<br /><br />13. Immortality: The most upbeat ballad on the album, dedicated to Kurt Cobain, but I don't think the lyrics are about him. Still very good though. Also a hit, sort of. (9/10)<br /><br />14. Hey Foxymorphandle Mama, That's Me/Stupid Mop: OMG, OMG!!! This is the worst piece of crap ive ever heard (besides the dialouge & sound effects in that utter carbon monoxide carrying The Big Bounce \\"movie\\")Says nothing AT ALL, just a boy saying \\"I want so much, I want so much\\", and hardly anything else. I always skip it from now on, it makes my ears f*cking bleed to death! (0/10)<br /><br />Overall, besides the idiotic experiments, it was one of my favorite albums so far, and recomended to any PJ fan (well, they all probably already have it) and alt. rock fans in general, just skip the experiments! It was a nice way for PJ to sort of re-invent themselves, since everyone thought they denied themselves from the grunge label on this. Well, they always have wanted to deny themselves from it, sadly, at least they still make SOME more good music today. I'll be reviewing Ten & Yield pretty soon.oxide carrying The Big Bounce \\"movie\\") Says nothing AT ALL, just a boy saying \\"I want so much, I want so much\\", and hardly anything else.

0385335482|5.0|I had heard many great things about the 'SHOPAHOLIC' series but for some reason put off reading it. I think that maybe the title put me off a little bit, thinking that it was more of a diary that an actual story.  Finally, after ages of hearing about how great the series was I borrowed 'CONFESSIONS' from a friend and boy was I glad that I did!  This has got to be one of the funniest books that I have ever read!  Becky Bloomwood is hilarious and I can completely relate to her irrepressible urge to buy whatever is put in her path!  Immediately after reading 'CONFESSIONS' I went out and purchased it (so that I could have a copy of my own) and the following two books in the series and I devoured those too.  The 'SHOPAHOLIC' series has skyrocketed to the top of my favorite series list and Kinsella is now a \\"must read\\" author for me.  If you haven't yet read any of this series GO OUT AND GET IT TODAY, you will not be disappointed!
B00003CXXP|1.0|Steven Spielberg + Stanley Kubrick + ILM + a great cast... This movie should have been fantastic. And, to be fair, it does start out that way. However, as the plot moves along, it quickly goes from fantastic to mildly interesting to vaguely silly to PLEASE GOD MAKE IT STOP. This is, without a doubt, one of the worst movies I have ever seen. The fact that it was directed by Steven Spielberg, widely regarded as one of the best in the business, makes it even more of a tragedy. I realize there are a lot of people who think this movie is magnificent and wonderful. Well, to them I say this: That's what the townspeople thought of the Emperor's New Clothes. I think this movie is absolute garbage, and a must to avoid.
068987474X|5.0|Women do not usually hold out for men who show them zero interest, so what's happening in the examples in this book is that the men are routinely showing patterns of pursuit and retreat that are leaving the women frustrated, angry, and confused. The motives behind pursuit/ retreat are never fully explained here and I think might be more complicated than Greg Behrendt lets on. Could the reasons be that men are trying to grab back some of the power they feel they have been losing? I don't know, but I do know that women still feel undervalued. We've been able to leave behind the lack of respect, attention, and love that women felt in the powerless role of the housewife so that we could establish some power and control in the working world. Yet many of us still feel a lack of respect, attention, and love in our personal lives.     As Liz Truccillo writes in this book, it is very difficult to assume a passive role in the dating world when you don't assume that role in any other area of life. If you think you have a shot, however small, at the job, house, or lifestyle that you want, you go for it. Being passive leads to depression; being active leads to a sense of empowerment, even when you lose. When have you ever heard someone advise a male to be happy with his life, with or without a partner, and to just let things happen as they may? That he should be fully satisfied with or without a love relationship? Men are never told this. I don't think most of them would have much interest in pursuing careers if they knew it would result in zero chance for relationships. We are largely driven by love and sex, after all. Yet women are consistently told they should be happy alone if the right relationship doesn't come along. So many men have complained to me that women hold all the cards in relationships; they seem to have no idea how frustrating it is to have to communicate indirectly instead of just being able to ask someone out and letting the chips fall where they may.I really enjoyed the fact that we get some of the female perspective in this book; Truccillo is not afraid to air her fear and anger over these issues. No wonder Sex and the City was such a consistently good show (until the last episode) and left so many of us feeling bereft when it ended. Unfortunately, a lot of single women in their thirties and forties have so much buried fear and anger over their status that they are unable to articulate and accept their emotions on these issues. New York women are just so kick-[...].     Despite my misgivings, this book DID help me close a door on an unresolved relationship. It does empower you to be active in one sense-- you can actively close the door on one relationship and then actively put yourself in situations where you can meet someone new.
B0006IEVFG|3.0|UPDATE: Lately this watch has been resetting to default settings by itself (about once every 6-7 weeks). It has NOT been exposed to the elements and hasn't been roughed up. I get really angry when it loses all my settings, so you probably ought to look for a different watch than this one. The curved resin band is starting crack and will break on me any day now.    I made the mistake recently of replacing a sturdy Casio (which lasted 17 years) with a Timex Ironman. The Timex lasted only 3 months. So I picked up another Casio. They're nice because their plus/minus degree of accuracy ADVANCES one second, not SUBTRACTING like the Timex per 24 hours. I like the display on this Casio. Unfortunately it includes some features I find useless and it's incovenient pressing the button over and over again cycling to find the mode you want. Too bad you can't override what you won't use. You have to expose it to the sun as it's solar-powered, and the backlight barely stays on long enough to glance at it. So, it's not the best, but the display looks nice and so far appears more dependable than the aforementioned Timex.
B00005JNJ7|5.0|This is hands down the single funniest movie made in the last 25 years.  You want funny?  Hans Blix being fed to man-eating sharks James Bond villain style; American \\"world police\\" entirely oblivious to the disdain of the foreigners who they are \\"protecting\\"; puppet sex; puppet vomit; puppet karate; a macho puppet who hates actors because, as a child, he was raped by the cast of Cats; the accidental destruction of the Eiffel Tower, the Arc de Triumph and the Louvre (complete with a smoldering Mona Lisa) as the puppets \\"save\\" Paris; \\"Everybody Has Aids\\".  This movie is a masterpiece!
B0000019PA|5.0|alright, you've read a few reviews and you've got a bit of an idea what this is gonna sound like. but it seems like a bit of a risk dont it? <br /> <br />everyone is saying it. <br />you'll either love this album. <br />or you really. really wont. <br /> <br />also, what everyone thinks (including me) is that you gotta listen to it for a while and let it grow on you. <br /> <br />the few 1 star reviews on here are admittedly more constructive than most of the trash talking 1 star reviews you get on this place. <br /> <br />the point is, even if you DO give it a chance you may not like it in the end. <br /> <br />it really could go either way. <br /> <br />but i think everyone, EVERYONE, should at least give it a go. <br />cause if, after 9 or 10 listens, it does finally click.. <br /> <br />then just like the majority of us posting reviews, you will have stumbled upon one of the most rewarding musical experiences of your life.
B0000AZJXQ|4.0|Released more than a year ago, 'Thirteenth Step' is undoubtably the most stimulating and inspiring album that I have purchased in years. 'Mer de Noms' was a great album, which seems to be the prefered album amoungst fans but 'Thirteenth Step', for me, was a departure from anything predictable and wornout in music.  <br /> <br />It is the depth, texture and subtly of 'Thirteenth Step' that has held it's longevity with me and the arrangements, for the most, are gentle and spacious, unlike most rock acts who fill their albums with constant heaviness and unrelenting distortion. 'Thirteenth Step' does rock out and drive hard but the cleaner guitar movements make way for Jeordie White's massive bass tone, which in some ways is heavier and more biting than full fledged guitar crunch. He is a credit to the line up and his 'less is more' approach to the songs gives room for the superb vocal melodies, harmonies and lyrics delivered by James Maynard Keenan. Throughout the entirety of the album, guitarists Billy Howerdel and James Iha create an original soundscape of dynamics and melody with the subtle meshing of their independent guitar parts and drummer Josh Freese lays down ideal grooves to compliment every moment. <br /> <br />The production is immaculate but still contains enough grit to sound organic and sustain the dark nature of the lyrical subject matter. 'Thirteenth Step' is also a surprisingly catchy album in the sence that the choruses stay in your head prompting another listern. That's pretty unusual for something that is associated with progressive music but these musicians have been in the game long enough to know how to write a decent tune, especially without resorting to the current climate of trends. <br /> <br />Almost 'Perfect'. <br /> <br />'Thirteenth Step'   <br />4.5 stars out of 5.
B0002Y4T92|5.0|<br />An amazing display of musicality and eagerness to help, you can feel the good vibe in this DVD set that captures the best of the performances from the guitar players that, for 3 days, rocked Texas. <br /> <br />With the benefit of his Crossroads centre in mind, EC and his tour manager organized this festival and got the help of the best guitar players around, including names like BB King, Robert Cray, Steve Vai, Jonny Lang, Buddy Guy, Hubert Sumlin, Robert Lockwood Jr, Eric Johnson, Joe Walsh and many, many more. <br /> <br />I don't have to say that the music is great, and although the selection of songs may not be the most popular (no Layla, no Cliffs of Dover, no The Thrill is gone) it is indeed a very fine sample of the 3 nights of music. <br /> <br />The dvd's themselves (yes, this is a 2 disc edition) are of the top quality. The concert audio comes in 5.1 and Dolby Stereo, and Video is crisp and colorful, and presented in letterbox format, wich gives an elegant touch to it (Same you can see in One More Car dvd, from Clapton's 2001 tour) and also has a multiangle feature included. <br /> <br />Interviews are abound and very funny, and add to the whole intimate experience, since you can feel you are actually in the concert. Camera direction is wise and to the point. <br /> <br />Animated menus are the cherry on top, and visual design is very neat. Dvd comes in transparent keep case with display cardboard case. <br /> <br />In all, a must have for fans of the blues and rock guitar, and sales from the DVD benefit Crossroads centre for substance abuse, so what are you waiting for, help EC and enjoy his music.
B0002XDODU|5.0|Rammstein is a band that has never released a bad album. Each record they produce takes their form of industrial heavy metal to different levels, all of which are purely enjoyable, and `Reise, Reise' is no different. Those expecting some sort of change in form are sadly mistaken, Rammstein put forth eleven tracks of diverse, catchy, elegant, and all out heavy tracks of German know how, and, unlike a lot of their industrial peers, they actually utilize the metallic chops that they posses. The use of keyboards is a bit sparser than on their previous effort - the absolutely fantastic `Mutter' - bringing their sound back to the more riff driven mentality of `Sehnsucht' - songs like \\"Keine Lust\\" and \\"Mein Teil\\" being among the heaviest tracks that they have ever put forth. If you are into the softer aspect of Rammstein - i.e. their poignant ballads - you need not worry, this album takes many of those ideals and applies them, the final three tracks being very powerful ballads in the view of \\"Seeman\\" and \\"Nebel\\". Perhaps the most enjoyable aspect of the album is the catchy nature of the songs. Songs like \\"Amerika\\" and \\"Moskau\\" are the highlights of the album and have choruses that will not leave your head for days. I can't find any faults with `Reise, Reise' - like all other Rammstein albums. If you enjoy any form of heavy music pick this up, whether you enjoy the more mainstream aspects of the genre or are one who tends to stray to the heavier aspects of metal.
0140277447|5.0|The truth hurts, yet it reveals the history.  Why should all these happen to the innocent civilians? The evil side of the war. When a war occured not in the name of justice and defense, it could turn human into evils. As the history wheels turns, peace and love should always be chrished.    War criminals should be punished, instead still worshipped.  The victims should be remembered, yet some people are trying to hide the truth to make them to be forgotten for ever.     Nanking massacre, a tradedy in the human history, should never be forgotten, and should serve a great lesson to both countries.    There is never \\"if\\" in history. We could only imagine what would have happend should Japanese had conquered US continents after Pearl Harbor attack. But you can always seek clues from Nanking masscure.
B000069AT7|5.0|I received this box set as a Christmas present a few years ago and until recently never opened it.  I have the other standard DVD so I didn't see the need to peek at this one.  Wow!  Three discs.  One features the 2002 remastering, disc two the 1982 version (Just a tad more violent) and disc 3 has all the behind the scenes goodies.  There's the soundtrack album CD and a wonderful book included in this set.  It was scheduled to go out of print two years ago.  If you can get one do so.  It is well worth the money.  It is the ultimate on E.T.  Everything you ever wanted to read, see, or hear about E.T. is in this box set. <br /> <br />
B000000WHX|5.0|When the liquid bass line and seductive female vocals on Safe From Harm flooded into my stereo, I was immediately hooked.  The first offering from Massive Attack is a genre defining and genre smashing classic.  This music became known as trip hop, and this is the first classic trip hop album.   <br />The musical styles reach from r&b and soul (Safe From Harm, Lately), to hip hop (Blue Lines, Daydreaming), to dub (Five Man Army) and dance (Unfinished Symphony).  <br />This is the most soulful of the Massive Attack albums, mainly due to Shaara Nelsons vocal talents.  This also has a more organic sound than Protection or Mezzanine.   <br />Though I prefer Mezzanine for it's relentless and claustrophobic sound, Blue Lines is a classic album.  A must have for any serious music fan.  Keep an open mind and you won't be disapointed.
B00003CXCT|4.0|Writing this review of the 'Star Wars' trilogy is a catch 22.  I longed for the day the DVDs came out, but I longed for the old trilogy, or at least the trilogy I saw on those beautiful laserdiscs.  Instead, the ever perfectionist George Lucas, decides to \\"alter\\" his films again.  I don't mind the improvements so much, but couldn't he put the old ones out too?  Part of the original charm was the original special effects.  Now the original movies will get lost, and they should have been preserved for viewings, even by film historians.  These films are now classics, they are pop culture history, We do not want them altered.  They were fine the way they were, warts and all. <br /> <br />On a technical level the trilogy stands way out on its own.  The sound, visual effects, and musical score all work well together, even in the lesser effort \\"Return of the Jedi.\\"  Too many critters (i.e. toys to sell), too long (about 10 minutes) and a convient tie up all loose ends kind of ending bring this episode down a little. <br /> <br />I like 'Empire' the best.  It's loaded with action, plot twists, great visuals, and lots of Darth Vader.
0060506989|5.0|I sat down to read this book, and put it back up,  I did this several times before comitting to it.  I have read several books on Vietnam, but normally prefer to read WWII books.<br /><br />This one really touched me and helped me to see the dedication men have in battle.  When you are reading about men that are shot and have their gun blown out of there hands, so they shoot left handed rather than right, are shot in the throat and can not speak, and still they fight. I was just overcome and moved deeply by the sacrifices these men have continually made.<br /><br />This book has given me such a deep appreciation for our vets, and makes me realize the importance of honoring there sacrifices.  These men were amazing and heroic, and I am glad this book shows a true picture of war for all of those who will never have 1st hand experience, but plenty of opinions.<br /><br />Thank you for your sacrifices!!! And P.S., should any of you go to the Vietnam Wall Memorial in D.C., if you see litter, please stop and pick it up.  Thanks.
B0002Z1EG2|5.0|The best of Shania all on 1 CD! I love it! Plus the new music..... \\"Don't\\", a song that reflects on what happens in a relationship without communication,and \\"Having A Party\\", an upbeat, get your feet moving song. Thanks Shania!
B0002XH9Z4|2.0|Does anyone, except for the members of his rapidly dwindling<br />cult of hardcore fans, really need another Michael Jackson<br />collection?  He's released so many compilations in the last<br />decade that it's become something you can regularly count on,<br />like Daylight Savings Time and Income Tax Day.  I'm not gonna<br />dwell on his pathetic personal life, or his bizarre physical<br />transformation, or his constant \\"I'M the victim!  NO ONE<br />understands me!\\" schtick.  What I can't ignore is the fact that<br />Mr. Mikey has completely run out of original or interesting ideas.  The last CD he released with anything remotely good<br />was \\"Dangerous\\", and even that paled in comparison to his<br />classic stuff.  Putting this material in chronological order<br />really spotlights his increasing reliance on production over<br />good songs, and the frightening way his voice has transformed<br />from the open-hearted, soulful wonder of his youth to the<br />strangled, unpleasant moans, cries and \\"EEE-EEE's\\" of his recent<br />years (which I refuse to term \\"adult\\").  I give it two stars<br />for the J5 through the 80's period, but as for the rest, skip it.<br />Forget healing the world, Michael.  Write some good songs!!<br /><br />THIS IS AN AMENDMENT TO MY ORIGINAL REVIEW:  Some of Michael's<br />fans on this site seem to think that if you don't care for his<br />latest music you're a \\"hater\\".  Pardon the pun, but do you really<br />think the world is that \\"Black Or White\\"?  One guy thinks that<br />all the negative reviews were written by one person.  WRONG.<br />Most of us don't have the time, nor the interest, to do such a<br />thing.  The purpose for these reviews is to tell people what you<br />really think about a product, not to act as a \\"Michael Jackson<br />Can Do No Wrong\\" fan club!!  Maybe some of you need to get out a<br />bit more.  Just as there's nothing wrong with you having your<br />opinions, we are entitled to the same.  The fact that an adult<br />would take a negative review of their Idol's work so personally<br />is a bit scary.  There are dozens of artists I admire, and none<br />of them hit a homerun every time out.  It's that simple.  Some<br />of us just think this boxed set SUCKS.  GROW UP!!
0312330529|5.0|As someone who has lived in Bombay for over a decade in the 80's the time of this novel ...I can say that it really is a pretty true and accurate depiction of the cities underworld and slums...plus its humanity ! The book moves through a series of depictions of the city, its prisons, slums, gangsters, bolly-wood, and does a really good job capturing its unique life. <br /> <br />Roberts can be overblown at times and his descriptions especially of the main gangster and his philosophy is sometimes overextensive ...however the books moves along at a fast enough pace and the descriptions hold your attention especially if you've never been to that part of the world. Most importantly its clear that Roberts loves India and all that is Indian or Mumbai and all its lively charactrers. The portrayals are accurate and sympathethic. The characters are realistic and hold your attention and curiosity all through. Even the main character of Shantaram never seems larger than life...though he's clearly living life to the hilt. <br /> <br />Sure the book could have done with some editing...at 900 plus pages it has a few too many. However I read through it really fast and was never bored ...more like spell bound ! <br /> <br />Definitely recommended !
B0002XDODU|5.0|This is definitely one of my favorite albums of all time... although I haven't decided yet if it is my favorite Rammstein albums, it is still an amazing album. You may have heard that this album is not as hard/powerful as previous releases, but I think that is not true. There is an incredible power beneath the surface, making nearly every song a classic. I would also recommend checking out the Mein Teil, Amerika, and Ohne Dich videos.  <br />Best tracks in my opinion: Dalai Lama, Los, Morgenstern, Ohne Dich <br />Not worst, but not-quite-as-good tracks: Amerika, Stein um Stein <br />I recommend this album to anyone, whether they like Rammstein or not.
B0002XH9Z4|5.0|If you want pretty much every masterpiece from MJ, then look no further than this set. Covering the era's from the Jackson 5 through today, this is sure to have something for everyone.<br /><br />The main reason for buying this set is the new songs and the included DVD of Michael's 1992 concert that he recorded for HBO during the Dangerous Tour. It epitomizes what a great entertainer he is and showcases his superb dancing and singing. He also looks extremely sexy and is a delight to watch for that reason alone.<br /><br />Hopefully, Sony will release the DVD as a stand-alone package, as alot of people won't shell out the bucks for this set. And maybe they will include 5.1 Surround Sound and some additional features. ~:)
B000084T18|2.0|50 Cent is the least talanted rapper that I have ever heard.  I'm sick of so-called rappers like 50 cent, Nelly, Lil' Jon, and any other rappers that can easily be found on MTV rapping about getting drunk and getting laid.  A) These guys are not talanted at all.  I'm white but I could talk over the semi-decent beats that they're given just as easily that they can.  The only reason that this album doesn't get 1 star is because the beats at times are just okay.  I wish one of the nine bullets that hit this guy would have struck his brain and/or heart so that I wouldn't have to listen to idiots talk about how great he is.  B) It's a slap in the face to real artists who constantly redefine their styles and produce socially conscious and thoughtful records.  They are the ones who deserve to be paid a living wage; but instead clowns like 50 Cent parade around acting like idols and continuing to produce garbage music while at the same time not contributing to society.  If you agree with me, then go out and buy a record by Zion I, or J-live, or Blackalicious, or Brother Ali, or Talib Kweli, or Common, or The Living Legends, or ANYONE for that matter that wouldn't typically be found on MTV.  Need help finding those records?  Just search this site and purchase an album that will get airplay for years to come.

If you are looking for a movie that will deliver an excellent story with laughs that will split your sides... this is the one for you.

0452285186|5.0|I rarely buy books on first sight but one glimpse into this small volume sold me. My wife and I took it home and allotted ourselves to two pages a day to make it last. Then we both took it to work and caused downturns in productivity as we showed it to all our coworkers. Now it sits on the shelf in easy reach and gets brought out whenever people come over. Why?<br /><br />Well, this is simply the funniest thing I've come across in a long time. It's a book of simple black and white cartoon line drawings of bunny rabbits either planning their own demise, or showing the result of their suicide. There is no dialogue (except one sequence involving Darth Vader), no captions, just these ridiculous little rabbits with completely deadpan faces and a sadistic self-destructive streak. The most common comparison is to Gary Larson and the talking animals of his \\"Far Side\\" panels. These are somewhat similar in that they unfold in a single panel and are sublimely ridiculous and clever, but there's also often a Rube Goldberg character to the elaborate suicide plans. In terms of tone however, I think Edward Gorey is perhaps more on the mark, in terms of depicting the darkest deadpan humor possible.<br /><br />Non-Brits should note that some of the jokes depend on being versed in British popular culture. For example, one is only funny if you're familiar with the work of Damien Hirst, another is only funny if you've seen the classic British cult film The Wicker Man, and one requires an understanding of British hand gestures (the \\"peace sign\\" being flashed by a bunny lined up with Nazi soldiers cited by one reviewer is actually something rather more rude...). But for the most part, the humor comes from the hilarious juxtaposition of the earnest bunnies and their tools of suicide, example include: windmill + pickaxe, trampoline + helicopter, stapler + angry dog.<br /><br />In any event, Riley's collection of macabre bunny death is pure brilliance, and will doubtless be popping up on t-shirts and postcards soon--in the meantime, the book makes a great gift.p on t-shirts and postcards soon--in the meantime, the book makes a great gift.

B0000931QR|4.0|Son al menos interesantes las muchas referencias a Mecano que se leen en los comentarios anteriores. Y no, La Oreja no es Mecano, pero nadie dijo que deba serlo.

B00005JMUL|4.0|A film by Robert Zemeckis<br /><br />\\"The Polar Express\\" is based on a 29 page award winning children's book by Chris Van Allsburg.  Robert Zemeckis obviously had to expand Van Allsburg's book, but he still begins with the first line of the book and ends with the last line.  \\"The Polar Express\\" is animation like we have never seen before, using a movement capture technology which has advanced far beyond anything that has come before.<br /><br />Hero Boy (Tom Hanks) has lost his faith in Christmas.  He has told his sister that there is no Santa Claus, and while he still wants to believe that Santa Claus lives at the North Pole and delivers presents to all the good little boys and girls, he knows from his encyclopedia that the North Pole is barren with no life.  He goes to sleep on Christmas Eve but is woken in the middle of the night by the sound of a train outside his window.  He puts on his jacket and runs outside and sees a big train in the middle of the street with a Conductor (Tom Hanks) \\"all aboard!\\"  The train, the Polar Express, is headed to the North Pole and Hero Boy is on the list of passengers.  After a moment's hesitation, Hero Boy decides to take the trip.<br /><br />All of the other kids on the train believe that they are truly going to the North Pole to see Santa Claus, but Hero Boy is not so sure.  Despite the magic of a train pulling up to his house in the middle of the night taking him on a wonderous trip, he doesn't believe.  He does befriend Hero Girl (Nona Gaye), however, and after losing her ticket by mistake, Hero Boy has a small adventure on the train trying to find the ticket and then trying to find Hero Girl.<br /><br />Much of \\"The Polar Express\\" takes place on the train until it reaches the North Pole, so the scope of the adventure is small.  But, this is a very visual movie and anytime the movie takes a peek outside the windows of the train it is absolutely stunning.  The animation looks more than real.  Everything is extra sharp and beautiful.  The only trouble is with the human characters.  While these are perhaps the best animated human characters (better than \\"Final Fantasy\\"), they still look a little bit creepy in the face.  They move well, but their faces are not exceptionally expressive and look a bit dead at times.  While the partial creepiness lasts throughout the movie, it takes a backseat to the physical beauty of the animation and the enjoyment of the movie.<br /><br />The voice talent in \\"The Polar Express\\" all does a very good job.  Tom Hanks, who performs as Hero Boy, The Conductor, The Hobo, Santa Claus, the Father, and Scrooge is excellent as always.  Nona Gaye is perfect in her role as Hero Girl and I would suggest that she is really the backbone of the movie.  We also get to see Peter Scolari (better known as the guy from \\"Bosom Buddies\\" who didn't become famous) as the Lonely Boy.<br /><br />\\"The Polar Express\\" has the potential to be a perennial holiday favorite for years to come.  There is a sweetness and a sadness in this story of a child that is sure to resonate with viewers.  This story gets lost at times in the long, though fun, train voyage to the North Pole.  This movie would, perhaps, be better suited to a shorter television special (though I can't imagine any television producer paying the money to make this movie for tv), but it works in the theatre.<br /><br />By no means is this a perfect movie, and far too much attention will be paid to how much \\"The Polar Express\\" cost to make (though it will lead to further innovation and cheaper techniques for other movies to use), but this is a nice, sweet holiday movie.  It is about the spirit of Christmas and holding onto that \\"magic\\" that is the belief of a child.<br /><br />-Joe Sherrysharp and beautiful.  The only trouble is with the human characters.

This movie would, perhaps, be better suited to a shorter television special (though I can't imagine any television producer paying the money to make this movie for tv), but it works in the theatre.   <br /> <br />By no means is this a perfect movie, and far too much attention will be paid to how much \\"The Polar Express\\" cost to make (though it will lead to further innovation and cheaper techniques for other movies to use), but this is a nice, sweet holiday movie.  It is about the spirit of Christmas and holding onto that \\"magic\\" that is the belief of a child.   <br /> <br />-Joe Sherry
B0002Z1EG2|5.0|Well worth every penny. It's not just a compilation of some of her MANY hits but definately an addition to compliment her current album collection. In addition to the 18 HITS you get three awesome new tracks. Party For Two is definately my favorite (and Mark ROCKS!!) but 'Don't' and 'I Ain't No Quitter' are wonderful tracks for sure, with 'Quitter' taking you back to her early roots. If you buy nothing else in 2004 (what's left of it) then at least buy this, and it will also make a wonderful stocking filler :o)~
B00065JTBA|5.0|I just picked this up today, so far i've listened to disc one and most of disc two.  I can't figure out why some of these songs never made it. They're all good songs so far, excellent really.  I can't wait to watch the DVD tonight. I highly recommend this to any Bon Jovi fan.
B000002HK4|2.0|I think it's funny how some of the fans here love this album the most out of Dream Theaters entire collection.   Probably due to the fact that a lot of it isn't even their material. <br /> <br />Stick to writing your own material DT, covering songs has never been very cool except for a few good instances.
B00008QSA5|5.0|Mike Bloomfield who is one of the greatest blues guitarists ever cranks out some great tunes. The first track and best on the album is \\"Alberts Shuffle\\". It has some of the best guitar licks you'll hear. The next best track is \\"Stop\\" which has a funky groove to it that is irrestible.  If you want to hear Bloomfield play some of his best you have to pick up Super Session. Steve Stills also does a fine job on his tracks (6-9) and espically on the cover of Dylan's \\"It takes alot to laugh, It takes a train to cry.\\"
B000002H97|1.0|Well what can anyone say about ZEPPELIN? it's the toughest thing anyone can possibly be made to answer. Maybe it's wise to start with the other great human endeavours, the Ancient Greeks, the The European Rennaisance, Beethoven, Einstein. Put these in a melting pot and the end result would stll be vastly inferior to the worst song by Zeppelin. In fact it's false to think of ZEPPELIN as having a worst song. Every ZEPPELIN song is the azimuth of human genius. o the question is not whether anyone gives a rat's @ss whether or not you use your brain but accept it as a FACT. <br />The human mind is simply unable to comprehend the dizzying magnitude of ZEPPELINS genius. It's like trying to comprehend the vastness of the Cosmos. It can't be done. Just trying to comprehend the tiniest fragment of ZEPPELINS talent would make your head hurt. pink floyd aren't even fit to lick Jimmy Pages boots. All hail the Mighty ZEPPELIN!!!
B0002F6BRE|5.0|Just an amazing Christmas film that drives itself headlong to the top of the yuletide classics heap.<br /><br />I noticed some reviewers had given it 1 star. I don't typically analyze one's character based on personal tastes in films. However, I really have to question the integrity of the reviewer when they blaze onto this site screaming \\"It sucked!\\", \\"It sucked!\\" I mean, how can you not like this holiday film? The very idea of giving 'Elf' 1 star suggests that the reviewer is a frigid, empty suit, or was home-schooled by conservative Christian parents who taught that laughter was a sin against God. Some of you need to put down the corporate nooses and learn to be silly again; learn to be a kid again.<br /><br />This movie is silly, and sappy, and so much damn fun I don't understand how anyone could turn away disappointed. It's akin to hating \\"Rudolph the red nosed reindeer\\", or \\"The Santa Clause\\", or \\"A Christmas Story\\". Perhaps it has less to do with 'Elf' and more to do with a sheer distaste for Christmas. All I know is I'm baffled by it.<br /><br />Go buy this film. Watch it alone, or with loved ones. It's a treasure of a holiday film and enjoyed by just about everyone. Given the ratio of good/bad reviews on this site, it's safe to say that 'Elf' delivers.
0140277447|1.0|This book is written plainly & straight to the point. At times, I'm finding it intolerable to read the book as the activities committed by the Japanese during the war is totally inhumane & immoral. The necessity of us reading & understanding history is that we learn from our mistakes & building a better future for younger generations. What I'm finding intriguing is that till these days, the Japanese Government is still reluctant to apologise & pay compensations to the war victims. Besides, history text books in Japan are written in a way that the war guilt is not with Japan. In a way, Asian countries are not as pro-active as what the Jews have done in claiming reparations from Germany. But what Germany is doing now deserves to be commended for its willingness to work hand-in-hand with the war victims. Its memorials are a reminder to its citizens that in any wars, there are only losers. The truth is now in the open, & this book by Iris Chang is opening door to the war victims & has prompted the Senate to take some actions. I hope the surviving war victims are able to see the silver lining at the end of the tunnel.
B0002OERI0|4.0|Green Day still rocks but in a more mature manner. The music and the lyrics demostrate the band has stood the test of time.<br /><br />This material will attract new fans and satisfy those that have been around for a decade or more.<br /><br />The only disappointing thing I found about the material was the mixing of Billie Joe's vocals. I would have prefered less studio effects. He has a great voice and his style adds so much to the music. Some of that is lost in this effort.
B0006IUDXA|1.0|The series really suffered because of acting and, in later years, writing. The first season is alright, though. MacGuyver doesn't grow a social conscience (e.g., jump the shark)until later in the series.
B00065JTBA|5.0|Apparently \\"Fruit Loop\\", the first reviewer of this product, knows nothing about this box set and has definitely not listened to it.  This is not a \\"best-of\\" set.  Your old favorites are not there.  In fact, none of the songs \\"Fruit Loop\\" listed are even on the box set (other than a rare demo version of Living on a Prayer included as a hidden track)!  Why review something you do not know about? <br /> <br />Anyway, this box set contains 50 rare and unreleased songs.  38 of them have never been available anywhere before.  The other 12 are rare b-sides or bonus tracks from other countries.   The songs are from the 80's all the way through today.  I think this is a great concept for a box set, rather than just giving the fans material that they already own.  Leave it to Bon Jovi to be innovative and give the fans what they want. <br /> <br />To the other reviewers out there, please do not review products that you haven't taken the time to find out about, much less have actually seen or heard.
B00005V1B1|5.0|Quite a leap for a Camel.  The Santana influence has practically disappeared, replaced by a distinctively Canterburarian quality throughout (think early Caravan) but most particularly on the lengthy, multi-part 'Lady Fantasy' bit.  Great guitar solos, Andy.  The Supersister tribute is extremely nice and mellow.  Great flute work, Andy.  But even in 1974 a Tolkien tribute ('Nimrodel' etc) was verging on the corny; it sounds nice, anyway- -Mellotrons everywhere you look.  The live tracks are cool, and yes - - the bonus version of 'Lady Fantasy' is different enough to be interesting and educational.  Camel's lyrics were never much to write about, and again they're pretty cliched here (\\"I'm in a freefall/like a snowflake falling/down, down, down, down, down/oh yeah\\"; \\"Though he seems afar/like a distant star/his warmth he can convey\\"; \\"Oh, my Lady Fantasy/I. . . love you\\").  I don't think they were trying to be funny, even in an English manner.  By the way, I don't know about your copy, but in mine the manufacturer seems to have blown the booklet completely.  Quite a lot of text is missing, and what's there is duplicated, pics and all.  Just thought I'd mention it.
B000669GAI|4.0|The trouble with best of compilations is that they can never quite satisfy everyone.  Devoted fans are usually disappointed because some of the more obscure favorites inevitably don't make the album.  Conversely, the casual fan is often left puzzled by \\"greatest hits\\" they've never even heard of.  More often than not, it the serious fan who is left wanting, because as a general rule, these things aren't made for the serious fan, as they already own all the songs on the compilation.  In the case of \\"rearviewmirror\\" this dynamic is rather exacerbated by the fact that it is being produced by Epic, which owns these masters, but no longer has a contract with the band.  So, while I don't think Pearl Jam is upset by this release, neither has it received the attention that the incredible \\"Lost Dogs\\" did just a year ago.    Actually, to the band's credit, they haven't thrown on one or two new songs for the sole purpose of selling the compilation to their core audience.  So there is nothing on these two discs that you can't find elsewhere; even the relatively obscure \\"Man of the Hour\\" is available as a single.  Plus, the arrangement is nice with the more up tempo songs on Disc 1 and slower ones on Disc 2.  There are some that could go either way (like \\"Breath\\"), but all in all this set-up makes for a listening experience that feels new.  Which brings me to my first point, the package promises re-mixed versions of \\"Once\\", \\"Black\\" and \\"Jeremy\\", but don't get your hopes up.  These are re-mixes, not re-recordings, so if you were looking for new arrangements, you're out of luck.  Actually, the differences are hardly worth mentioning; I'm by no means an expert, but all I noticed were slightly stronger percussions, with Ed's voice being somewhat more prominent in spots.    So what's good and what's bad?  Well, I'm going to try not to be a snob, but there are a few noticeable oversights.  I'm sure they didn't want to overload on songs from \\"Ten\\", but \\"Porch\\" is rather glaring in itsabsence.  Alternately, \\"Once\\" in the place of \\"Porch\\" might have made sense if \\"Footsteps\\" had been included, which is a fairly well known b-side, and which would have also completed the \\"Mamasan\\" trilogy with \\"Alive\\".  From \\"Vs.\\" \\"Dissident\\" seemed like an odd choice as \\"Blood\\", \\"Glorified G\\" and \\"Leash\\" are all absent.  However, given the popularity of the eponymous bootleg from the mid-90's, I suppose this shouldn't come as a surprise.    \\"Vitalogy\\" is well represented; in particular I was thrilled to see that \\"Immortality\\" was included as it is one of Pearl Jam's best songs and is sorely underappreciated by radio.  Personally, I would have left off \\"Nothingman\\" in order to make room for other songs, but it's a good tune in and of itself, so that's not much of a complaint.  As well represented as \\"Vitalogy\\" is, I found \\"No Code\\" to be grossly underappreciated.  While \\"Hail, Hail\\", \\"Who You Are\\" and \\"Off He Goes\\" are to be found, the absence of \\"In My Tree\\" is just terrible.  Likewise, \\"Habit\\" and \\"Present Tense\\" at the least should have made it on.      With \\"Yield\\" it's the same story, while \\"Do The Evolution\\" and \\"Given to Fly\\" are eminently deserving of being included, I could take or leave \\"Wishlist\\", and \\"Faithfull\\", \\"Low Light\\" and \\"In Hiding\\" all would have been better choices.  \\"Binaural\\" didn't really have any breakout hits, so it's hard to argue with only including \\"Nothing as it Seems\\" and \\"Light Years\\", but it would have been nice to see \\"Insignificance\\" or \\"Breakerfall\\" on Disc 1.  The same is true of \\"Riot Act\\" although I think \\"Can't Keep\\" and particularly \\"Thumbing My Way\\" would have been great choices for inclusion.      \\"State of Love and Trust\\", \\"Breath\\" and \\"Man of the Hour\\" are all outstanding non-album contributions and definitely add to the set.  The same goes for \\"I Got Id\\"; over the years the \\"Merkinball\\" single has fallen off the radar, but it was huge at the time.  And finally, while I think most of us have grown a little weary of \\"LastKiss\\" over the years, it's hard to argue with its inclusion given the phenomenon it turned into.      One puzzling aspect of this set is that for a band that has made its name playing live, there are no live performances on \\"rearviewmirror\\".  I can understand why Epic wouldn't have wanted to include a completely different sounding version (i.e. \\"Jeremy\\" from Red Rocks) but any number of live versions of \\"Even Flow\\" or \\"Do The Evolution\\" would have been a real treat for the casual fan.    So, in the end, what is \\"rearviewmirror\\"?  Well, it's basically what it claims to be, a \\"best of\\"; there are oversights, but generally speaking this is a fairly thorough set.  While diehard fans (like myself) may bemoan the absence of certain songs, for less than twenty dollars, it's hard to argue with 33 tracks on two discs.   And for the fan who loved the band early and lost track of them over the years, this is a great buy.  Not only does it reintroduce old favorites, but it offers a smorgasbord of Pearl Jam's newer stuff.  In addition, the fast/slow arrangement makes this a good buy even for the hardcore fan, because, as I said before, it creates a new listening experience and saves you from fiddling with discs in the car if you just want to tear through some of your favorites.

B0000DD7LC|3.0|OK, overall this album is pretty groovy........sweet soul, some bumpin' and thumpin' that goes down smooth.<br /><br />The only reason I was moved to write a review is that the \\"guest\\" vocalist on the song \\"So Simple\\" is so bad that it is almost humorous. Who is Lellow, and who gave her the voice of a mutant mouse? Alicia, you are a real talent, have the guts to say no to helium induced guests in order to please a few execs.
B00005JNEI|1.0|Since ignorance is bliss, all of you Michael Moore lovers must be in heaven after watching this make-believe documentary. Let's get something straight- Michael MooreON hates America. He proved it when he said \\"Americans are quite possibly the stupidest people in the world, I'm ashamed of how stupid they are.\\" He called me and every other American stupid, now honestly, how can you follow this guy? And when will Amazon make 0 stars an option? One star is one more star than this deserves.    President Bush's reelection with more popular votes than any other presidential candidate in history (over 62 million, and I'm proud to have been one of them, the first time I voted in a presidential election) and the first time a presidential candidate has gotten a majority of popular votes since 1988 proves that America sees past Mooreon's lies. Also, Mooreon said that he hoped more Americans would die in Iraq so Bush wouldn't be reelected, he called the insurgents the true patriots in Iraq and said they were going to win, and called Zarqawi, the terrorist responsible for beheading civilians, a \\"minuteman.\\" Statements like this during wartime are nothing short of sedition. Now this socialist fatass is making a sequel to this movie. I'm glad for him, maybe he can use the money he makes to invest in a weight loss and personal hygiene program.
B0002VKZL6|5.0|Sorry, bad pun. But anyway, some people were probably wondering if Mark Knopfler was going to put out a new album any time soon, after the motorcycle accident last year that nearly cost him his life. But he persevered and soon emerged with his fourth solo album, Shangri-La.<br /><br />If this is your first Mark Knopfler album, you might not be the biggest fan at first listen. Not that the music isn't good, but those that have been following Mark since his days in Dire Straits should know that sometimes his lyrics can go from uncanny to risqu&eacute; (remember the line, \\"the little f****t with the earring and the makeup\\" from \\"Money For Nothing\\"?). This album's best example of that would be the very last song, \\"Don't Crash the Ambulance\\". But it's still a great song, and the rest of the songs aren't far behind.<br /><br />Highlights include \\"Our Shangri-La\\", the pensive \\"Stand Up Guy\\", and the memoriam \\"Song For Sonny Liston\\". And \\"Boom, Like That\\" is also a great song. Actually, ALL the songs are great. It may not exactly sound like Dire Straits, as other reviewers have argued, but that's because it's NOT Dire Straits; it's Mark Knopfler (there IS a difference). Anyway, Shangri-La is a must-have in any contemporary music collection.<br /><br />Anthony Rupert

B0002XH9Z4|5.0|Michael is such an unbelievable star, whose growing fans will never give up showing one hundred support to every aspect of him, his music as well as himself as a person. but whose opponents will never be moved by enen the greatest song made from his talent, and his dream!  <br /> <br />one guy above gave the two-star evaluation about this album as well as some criticising words. Please don't cheat yourself and others. Actually it's totally unnecessary for you to give even a single star or say one positive word. his music is not for you! <br /> <br />I haven't yet received this box set ordered from Amazon. But I just listened to all the new materials over the past week. Those songs, especially \\"Cheater\\", \\"We Are Here To Change The World\\" and \\"We Are The World Demo\\" make this box set worth a lot more than 49.99 dollars. What makes me even more excited is of couse, The Dangerous Tour Performance DVD. Having michael's officially released live performance is my over ten years dream, and it will become reality in a few days. Even though I haven't got this cool stuff yet, I have to say, waiting for it is also something enjoyable for me!
B000002LQR|5.0|'Blood Sugar Sex Magik' is easily the band's greatest achievement.  With the always reliable producer Rick Rubin, they cranked out this massive funk/rock masterpiece.  It's leaps and bounds over their 80's albums, and their more pop oriented albums 'Californication' and 'By The Way.' Highly recommended to any music fan.

B0002XDODU|5.0|While it's not quite as groundbreaking as 'Herzelied' or 'Mutter,' the long awaited 'Reise, Reise' continues the brooding, less electronic sound that they started on 'Mutter.'  Many songs on this album are instant classics, such as the singles Amerika and Mein Teil, with Keine Lust and the title track.  This will be an instant purchase for the dedicated Rammstein fan, but new fans should get their albums in chronological order.

B000002GFC|5.0|I must say, I believe this disc is the way to go in putting together a Cream collection, even if you are relatively serious about the band's music, as I am.  The band had a regrettably short lifespan, offering only 4 studio releases (two of them augmented by live versions of previously released songs), and most of their best tracks are included here.  This collection, in particular, renders the band's debut album, 'Fresh Cream', and their most ambitious work, the double-LP 'Wheels of Fire', obsolete.  Cream's swan song, 'Goodbye' really isn't even a collectable, so only 'Disraeli Gears' contains valuable tracks that cannot be found on 'the very best of Cream'.  In addition, all of the tracks are remastered, and we have the presence of an unusual single release.  To top it all off, we finally have a Cream disc where the producer made an effort to include some informative historical information on the band in the form of liner notes, and detailed information on the individual tracks, and several unique photographs of the band.  It's a thoughtful and comprehensive compilation. <br /> <br />The CD starts off with the band's first single, the enigmatic 'Wrapping Paper'.  Its unassuming pop posture is the last thing you would expect from the band, whose members were already steeped in the blues, rhythm and blues, and jazz.  It's more of a curiosity than anything else.  The song somehow made it into 'Fresh Cream' as well. We are then treated to the finer offerings from the debut LP.  'I Feel Free', 'N.S.U.', 'Sweet Wine', 'I'm So Glad' and 'Spoonful' are arguably the best selections from that disc. <br /> <br />Five selections from 'Disraeli Gears', the band's 1967 breakout classic follow.  'Strange Brew', built on the foundation of 'Lawdy Mama', 'Sunshine of Your Love' (the band's first top five hit), 'Tales of Brave Ulysses' and 'Swalrb' are easy selections.  The inclusion of 'We're Going Wrong', however, is certainly debatable, especially when tracks such as 'Take It Back', 'World of Pain', and 'Dance the Night Away' lie in wait.  I would have scratched 'We're Going Wrong' in favor of any of the other three standout tracks from this disc.  These three tracks are probably enough to make 'Disraeli Gears' demand shelf space next to 'the very best of Cream'.   <br /> <br />'Wheels of Fire' is gutted by 'the very best of Cream'.  Every elite song is present, unless you're partial to the overdone instrumentals from the live disc, or Jack Bruce's 'Passing the Time' and 'As You Said', songs I would not consider essential to a Cream collection.  There are seven songs included from 'WoF', and each is a winner, with 'White Room', 'Deserted Cities of the Heart', and the live version of 'Crossroads' being the obvious standouts.  I actually sold off my copy of 'Wheels of Fire' when I purchased this disc. <br /> <br />'Goodbye' is certainly under-represented.  'Badge', being one of Cream's finest compositions, was a foregone conclusion for this disc.  Since the rest of the disc is mostly live versions of previous releases by Cream, there wasn't much else to choose from.  Instead, the producers elected to include the May, 1968 single 'Anyone For Tennis', which is almost as pop as 'Wrapping Paper', and had every bit as much success (none) on the charts.  It is nevertheless a fun, laid-back listen. <br /> <br />Compilation discs often disappoint in one way or another, and while this one isn't perfect, it's darn close.  So unless you're a completist, or tuned into the powerful and often lengthy live productions the band made of their studio tracks over the years, it may well be the only investment in Cream you'll ever need to make.
B00006J9OT|5.0|This was my first Diana Krall album that i've purchased and I'm sure won't be the last. I bought it on a whim because I recognized her from a guest appearance with Elmo on Sesame Street. =) <br /> <br />Ms Krall's voice is magical. Soothing and warm.  <br /> <br />Unlike some other reviewers, I can't go into arrangement, production, and the like.  <br /> <br />But if you want to think cozy warm romantic thoughts, curl up in front of the fire and just relax and listen, than this is definitely the choice for you! Sit back with a loved one, or on your own and let Ms. Krall's magical brandy smooth and whiskey warmed voice take you away.

B00008OWZC|5.0|This three disc album is live music in another stratosphere. Led Zeppelin were at their best performing on stage, and in front of thousands of people Zeppelin put on one of their best shows. You get some amazing performances on the first disc, highlights include a tremendous performance from Page on \\"Heartbreaker\\", the intimacy of Plant's voice on the accoustic \\"Going to California\\" (made all the more appropriate being in LA), and the \\"Immigrant Song\\" is pure power to kick off the album. The second disc gives a great live rendition (that goes on for twenty five minutes) of \\"Dazed and Confused\\", The highlight of the entire album is John Bonham's performance on Moby Dick, the best drum performance ever captured on CD. The thrid disc has a great \\"Whole Lotta Love\\" medley and a sleeper performance of \\"Bring it on Home\\" that has the band playing off each other and has Plant on the Harmonica. For any true fan of Zeppelin, this is a must have for the collection, but it's also a great place for new fans to start, you'll have this album in your player for minths straight like I did. Prepare to be blown away.

B00002R0MC|5.0|Bob Marley is my favorite artist of all time.  I can listen to his music no matter what mood I am in.  The rythyms, the beats, the lyrics....everything coming together to make some of the best music to ever bless this earth.  Much respect to the band.... The Wailers, who were/are often overlooked because of the stardom of their frontman Bob.  They were truely a great band.  Bob and the Wailers music touched on so many topics...religion, political and racial struggles, family, friends, life and so on.....the passion with which the messages were delivered are what make Marley and the boys stand out.  With that said I could sit here and review every Marley and the Wailers album put out, instead I will just review this one in hopes that someone reads this and gives Bob and the Wailers a listen....

Well I guess he is right Meat Loaf's career in over. Oh , one more thing... Meat loaf has made over 24 films since 97', now that we have proven one idiot wrong( I see Dumb people).... Let's say again \\"what a Great Great record Bat 2 is\\" ,  and the  guy who keeps writing trash over and over again.. Should learn what great timeless song writing is all about. Rock on Stienman !!!
B00003CXXJ|5.0|I loved this movie!! It was a wonderful story about storybook love with a twist.  <br /> <br />The best part about this movie is that you as an adult won't be bored with it. The children are entertained by the colors and the simple storyline, and you are entertained by the music and ALL of the jokes. IT IS HILARIOUS! <br /> <br />It was so refreshing to see a cartoon movie ending in such a way. Love winning over appearance, you gotta love that! It shows the viewer that appearance shouldn't be as important as our society makes it seem to be. The movie tells you that happiness can be found no matter what you look like, and above all you should love yourself just the way you are. <br /> <br />Very cute. Very clear. VERY funny. Very entertaining. Something you WILL watch over and over again when the kids get a hold on it. :)  <br />
B00007JMCX|5.0|A moody and cerebral science fiction tale , that works as original device to explore the most intimate places of the human soul from the allienian point of view.<br /><br />This may be the masterpiece of Nicholas Roeg and one the two most terrific performances given for David Bowie (the other one would be Merry Christmas Mister Lawrence best known as Furyo).<br /><br />Do not miss this one .<br /><br />A timeless cult movie .
0446604844|3.0|Total Control begins with two high-tech companies, both in need of technological infusion,  pursuing a smaller firm whose advanced technology will guarantee future success. The potential for conflict is immediately evident as the same high-powered law firm is representing both companies in their bids. Attractive corporate attorney Sidney Archer is handling the affairs for one company, but it just so happens that her husband Jason is the main person collecting records pertinent to the sale for the same company.<br /><br />Matters quickly fall apart when in the midst of a high level meeting involving all the principals of the deal, Sidney discovers that her husband has supposedly met his death in a plane crash, after having told his superiors that he would be home doing odds and ends. Suspicions multiply when the loss of millions from corporate accounts is discovered, not to mention the death of a high-level banking official on the same flight.<br /><br />The story kicks into high gear when crusty FBI agent Lee Sawyer tries to make sense of it all. Of course, what would a story set in the cut-throat world of corporate high-tech be without the obnoxious, ruthless CEO; the brilliant, but slighted, guru; and lots of corporate security involving former CIA and FBI agents. Sidney is desperate to discover the truth about her husband. She finds herself somewhat clumsily navigating through building security systems, surveillance, phone taps, cryptic E-mails, computer security, and strange phone calls. It becomes evident that more than a Bonnie-and-Clyde caper is underway, and the bad guys have vast resources and are playing for keeps.<br /><br />The book is entertaining but not without some problems. For this reader the writing seemed stilted or awkward - it didn't flow too well. There were these constantly introduced little twists like \\"Sidney did not see the man lurking across the street.\\" It feels like reader manipulation. Some of the high-tech seemed either fanciful or was made to seem more difficult than it is. It is understandable that a shrewd attorney would have the wherewithal to pursue the mysterious death of her husband, but the slippage of her role into one of wonder woman, physically confronting truly bad guys, was not convincing. FBI agent Sawyer was probably the most compelling character. For such a lengthy book, the ending takes far too predictable of a turn, but it also manages to be incomplete, as the reader will see.<br /><br />There seems to be a lot of love it or hate it reviews. Yes the book was too long, a bit unrealistic, and somewhat predictable. But it compares favorably to most books of this genre. There are not many Le Carre's or Clancy's out there. It was an acceptable read. I'm not dissuaded from trying another one of his.l or was made to seem more difficult than it is.

B0006284JQ|1.0|What a long, weird journey pop music has had over the last five years.  In January of 1999, a freshly turned-17-year-old Louisiana mouseketeer named Britney Spears released her debut album \\"...Baby One More Time,\\" and with that release, she became responsible for launching a teen pop craze we haven't seen since New Kids on the Block and Debbie Gibson.  But more so than Gibson and NKOTB, Britney's brand of kiddie pop was criminally dull and vapid, and though her look \\"matured,\\" the quality of her songs (most of which were written by Max Martin) never did.  I won't go on about her publicity-motivated marriages, her countless tabloid appearances, or her \\"lesbian\\" kiss with Madonna.  I'll go straight to her hits collection, which compiles all her singles from her last 4 (four!) CDs.  The kickoff track is a cruel desecration of Bobby Brown's new jack classic \\"My Prerogative,\\" and it's rancid enough and sterile enough to make Mr. Brown refuse the royalty check.  Through the dreck of other hits such as \\"....Baby One More Time,\\" \\"Stronger,\\" the annoying \\"Toxic,\\" and the whiny \\"Everytime,\\" we find two noteworthy tracks: the Neptunes-produced \\"Boys\\" and \\"I'm a Slave 4 U,\\" which still hold up as Britney's best singles.  The other hits range from so-so to thunderously bad, and Britney's thin voice does nothing to help matters.  We also get a bonus disc of remixes which could have made this set worth buying, but the CD turns out to be a major botch job.  Though we do get Armand Van Helden's funky re-working of \\"Toxic,\\" the CD misses the opportunity to include better remixes such as the Thunderpuss versions of \\"I'm a Slave 4 U\\" or \\"Don't Let Me Be the Last to Know.\\"  There's nothing wrong with guilty pleasure pop, but guilty pleasure pop that's banal as this hits album is unacceptable.
B00004RIV4|4.0|UK dancepop duo Moloko are in fine form in \\"Things to Make And Do,\\" their third blend of acid jazz and trippy electronica. The talented Roisin Murphy and Mark Brydon create a charmingly erratic dance album that sounds like nothing else, yet never fails to draw you in.<br /><br />It opens with a peculiar piano solo, before kicking into the sexy sax-keyboard of \\"Pure Pleasure Seeker,\\" and the ominously trippy \\"Absent Minded Friends.\\" A darker note enters with songs like \\"Being Is Bewildering,\\" which is technically a more \\"normal\\" song, a slow and rather melancholy song based on acoustic guitar and organ. Same with the lower-key pop song \\"The Time is Now.\\"<br /><br />There are also some more experimental songs, such as the nonsensical funk of \\"Indigo\\" or the creepy psycho-vocals of \\"If You Have A Cross To Bear You May As Well Use It As A Crutch.\\" \\"Remain the Same\\" is perhaps the most experimental, with the vocal sampling and sound of the organ being overwhelmed and sunk by the electronic bleeps.<br /><br />In this release, Moloko downplays the outright weirdness in favor of a more subtle sound. Call it experimental ultraquirk acid-jazz-funk-house-trip-hop. That more or less describes it. It's not just a fun album, but a richly engaging one with some deceptively simple-sounding songwriting.<br /><br />Roisin (no, it doesn't rhyme with \\"raisin\\") Murphy has an excellent voice for this type of music -- it sounds clear and flexible, while being strong enough to rise over powerful music that could have overwhelmed her. And she brings depth to certain songs like \\"Mother,\\" where she lashes out at her mother in a restrained manner: \\"I know somehow somewhere I'll be bumping into you/you see I'm blameless/I had a mother who was shameless/no wonder my life collapsed!\\" Elsewhere the songwriting is just deliciously bizarre.<br /><br />Mark Brydon takes charge of the musical backdrop for Roisin's voice. And a fine job he does too, blending organic instrumentation like piano, acoustic guitar and rippling strings with some vocal sampling and deliciously wacked-out beats, sounding like anything from a DJ on acid to the funkier twin of Portishead.<br /><br />Erratic it may be, but \\"Things to Make And Do\\" is also fun, wild and extremely eclectic, switching styles the way most musicians do instruments. It may not be their best album, but it is a wonderfully engaging, trippy one., acoustic guitar and rippling strings with some vocal sampling and deliciously wacked-out beats, sounding like anything from a DJ on acid to the funkier twin of Portishead. <br /> <br />Erratic it may be, but \\"Things to Make And Do\\" is also fun, wild and extremely eclectic, switching styles the way most musicians do instruments.

6304698682|1.0|How anyone could give this movie a rating of three or higher is beyond me. I might as well come out and say it: Pale Rider is one of the worst movies I have ever seen, which is quite a feat, considering my standards are pretty low when it comes to westerns. This is because I *want* to like westerns. I invite them into my heart. Give me epic, lonely landscapes, a badass gunfighter, some horses and a romantic, sepia-tinted view of the pioneer days--and I'm delighted. Honestly, it doesn't take much to entertain me! Throw in a few ballsy one-liners, and I'll probably watch the movie a second time. But don't give me Pale Rider. I watched this film with some friends, all of us eager to see one more Eastwood western. From the opening monologue, we knew we were in for a bad ride. Only thing we didn't know is just HOW bad this ride would get. When the daughter isn't delivering lines like she's Sam's understudy on \\"Who's the Boss?\\", the other supporting actors--some of them quite good--are tripping all over themselves in the attempt to really OWN those hammy lines of dialogue and make them sound natural rather than... well, bad. This is one of those movies where one is constantly reminded of the script writers themselves (it took two geniuses to stitch this mess together) as they struggle through revision after revision, never quite seizing the magic that makes dialogue both natural and efficient. Instead of being drawn into the story, I kept asking myself, \\"Do the script writers really believe someone would say that? Did this look good on paper to them?\\" I challenge anyone to sit through the melodramatic rock pounding scene without smirking or chuckling under your breath. Try watching it with friends--you'll either be groaning or belly-laughing. Watch that preacher unify the camp and lift the spirits of the poor miners. Watch them all pound that rock. It's hilarious. It's also one of the few times you'll notice the film's music suddenly lurching to a climax. I'm betting thesparse scatterings of music throughout the film are borrowed from stock: no charm, no theme. I'm trying to present my review in some kind of an organized manner, but Pale Rider failed in so many ways-- both subtle and blatant, big and small--that it's like trying to put spilt ratatouille back in the pot, one stewed vegetable at a time. It's all one big mush no matter how diligant you are. How about the directing? Look, I think Eastwood ended up directing some fantastic films, and perhaps some of blame here lies on the cinematographer, but this film had no vision and no style. Unless the vision was to make every shot be just close enough to get one actor's head and shoulders into the frame and NOTHING ELSE. Wait until another character speaks; then lock onto that guy's head and shoulders. Wait until the girl speaks; film her head and shoulders. This whole movie could have been performed by animatronic marble busts of ancient Greeks. You'd only need to call in the human actors once every ten minutes, when Eastwood decided it was time to show several bodies in one frame--though not with any style to speak of. Halfway through Pale Rider, I thought I was going to have a claustrophobic panic attack from the camera's unflagging refusal to pull back and show the entourage, the landscape, or any interest in what is going on other than the interest a ship's porthole might have for the sea: \\"Look through my hole; there's Eastwood saying something. Now look again. There's someone else saying something else. I would show you more but I'm only big enough to show head and shoulders.\\" Even considering who (or what) Eastwood's character turns out to be (don't worry, the writers spell it out for you as though the already know the camera won't get the job done), the camera STILL doesn't show him in any interesting way. He's just your average gunslinging preacher seen through a porthole. Of course, widening the shot would have revealed to anyone with eyesight worse than -3.00 all the goofy mat paintings. At one point, we thought the daughter character was going to run right through a painting, and we all burst into laughter. Another such moment came when Eastwood was lurking around town. Behind him, a breath-taking vista of western mountains. Okay, I confess, it was a massive, admittedly impressive mat painting that looked like it took so much work to create that it left me wondering--why not just find a cheap location somewhere in California or Spain and actually FILM THE ENVIRONMENT? And speaking of Eastwood, he does not redeem this film. Even if all you want to do is watch Eastwood kick ass and hiss out some unforgettable clinchers, prepare to be underwhelmed. Every time a character says something that begs answering, and everyone else shuts up, and the camera locks onto Eastwood's bust, and you just KNOW he's going to kick you in the jaw with a tidy one-liner that might as well be the villain's epitaph--whimper. That's you get, a whimper. Something like, \\"Yeah, I guess so.\\" \\"Alright then.\\" \\"We'll see.\\" That's what comes out of the script writers' word processors after several revisions. They give Clint Eastwood a perfect set-up so that he can slam dunk with the biting, insightful statement: \\"I guess I'll go to town.\\" Eh? Thanks for nothing. To say nothing of the incredible (as in, lacking credibility) idea the villains would desperately try to bribe this preacher out of town instead of just muscling the poor miners away like they were planning to anyway. Oh right, they give him 24 hours to leave. How accommodating of them. To say nothing of the evil marshall and his robotic deputies. I could go on and on. Forgettable dialogue (at best), uninspired style, no pay-off in the finale. This movie is only passable if passable means just laughable enough to carry you through to the snore-fest ending gunbattle. Passable if you mean the equivalent to a typical Van Damn movie--without the leg split scenes.
B000062X90|5.0|This is the greatest rock album of all time. It goes for 42 minutes and not one second of it is weak. There have been other great albums like Led Zep IV and Who's Next, but Four sticks isn't that good and Who's next starts and ends brilliantly but sags in the middle. Not Argus. Melody, energy, vituoso playing and brilliant songs. The Ash never bettered it and no one else has either. Fave parts are Andys solo on Sometime World (my all time favourite song). It is a circular solo which comes back to its starting point every minute or so -I wish it went a couple of minutes longer. Another awesome moment is the twin guitar solo at the end of Throw down the sword. But really the whole album is outstanding. Andy, Mart, Ted and Steve take a bow!
0684857219|5.0|In this new and revised version with Bill Dobbins Arnold gives the A - Z's of Bodybuilding.  Before I bought this book I knew very little about bodybuilding and nutrition but after reading through the book a few times I was an expert in the field.  By using the routine he has laid out And following his nutrition guidlines I have been able to transform my body into a form that could compete in a competition.  I have found no other book that has laid out a plan without using any sort of fad schemes, Arnold uses the basics: Hard work and a lot of discipline.  If you are ready to work hard than this book is for you.
B00065JTBA|5.0|I bought this box set because Bon Jovi has had some pretty good songs over the years that have been catchy.    I could have beat myself for not looking at the track listing, as I just assumed this would be a giant \\"Best Of\\" collection. In fact, Id only heard of about 3 songs on the whole 4 disks (YIKES)!!!  I was going to go ahead and re-sell it, as this is a lot of money to have tied up in something Im not truly interested in, but I figured since I would lose money on it anyway, that I would give it a listen first.    Im very delighted that I decided to do that.    The set is packaged very nicely, and includes a very nice large colored booklet that has very in-depth entries explaining why these songs were written, chosen for the box set, and why the box set has been released.  There are fan testimonials plastered throughout, and it is closed with personal, hand written messages from the band.    Musical highlights include the totally rockin' \\"Taking it Back\\", interesting demos of songs we know well (such as \\"Always\\"), some most excellent soundtrack material such as \\"Good Guys Dont Always Wear White\\", tracks featuring vocal performances by the guitarist, keyboard player, and drummer, a song written to Kurt Cobain's daughter after his death, and many, MANY other standouts.    One song that I believe is a lyrical GEM, quite possible one of the best rock songs ever written (lyrically) was \\"Last Man Standing\\".  Writtin about the late Johnny Cash and Bob Dylan, this song reflects on the direction the music industry is going.  It compares the manufactured stars of today who lip synch to pre-recoded music and sounds to the old school artists who are/were singers, songwriters, and musicians.     \\"Come see those real-life caloused fingers wrapped around those guitar strings, kiss the lips where hurt has lingered, it breaks your heart to hear him sing, his songs were more than music, they were pictures from his soul.....\\"      This is very much like a \\"Greatest Hits you've never heard\\" of Bon Jovi....4 disks worth!!!  There are love ballads better than the ones Im used to hearing on the radio, and songs that ROCK as hard as Ive ever heard this band rock.       Possibly the biggest thing I gained was respect for the band.  After watching the (almost hour long) DVD that is included, and reading the fan testimonials, I can really see how these guys strive to be great artists.       All in all, Im still digesting how cool this is, Im a HUGE fan of rock music, and its like being introduced to this awesome rock band, that has suddenly decided to give us its best work from the last 20 years, all in one shot.      If you're a fan of good rock and roll, give this a listen.    \\"A+\\"
0596007124|5.0|The list of patterns presented is small compared to other books, but this works well since the coverage is more about learning the basic patterns well with a solid understanding. Also of great value is the way each pattern is taught by presenting common problems with the obvious, but wrong, solutions and then leading you out of the hole you dug and highlighting the important steps towards a better and more maintainable solution. <br /> <br />I was particularly impressed how the presentation of each pattern was built on solid Object Oriented concepts. But rather than assuming you know these advanced concepts, they are integrated into the learning exercise and presented as a cohesive bundle. The book is also structured so it refers back to and reinforces both the pattern and OO lessons as you progress. <br /> <br />It's hard to find real fault with the book. At times it jumps between topics, is repetitive and a bit irreverent, but this is all part of the formula and exactly what is promised. <br /> <br />Beginner or experienced, you better be careful or you might learn something. If you're not sure what I mean by this, maybe take the time to flip through the introduction in a shop. I haven't read any other HF books yet, but they'll be the first place I look for future needs! <br />
077106506X|5.0|Recently Ive come across two stellar short story collections, both having similarities and yet completely different.  The first I read was McCraes The Childrens Corner, which contains such a wide scope of feeling and insight into the human emotions that I was just blown away.  Then I picked up Runaway:  Stories by Munro, and I really hit the jackpot.  Some stories in the Munro are connected and some are not.  Still, you should read these in the order they are presented as that does have some impact on what happens and makes for a nice rhythm for the whole book.

0345457684|5.0|Takeshi Kovacs is an Envoy, a sort of cross between a mercenary soldier and a master spy, who lives in the far future, when Earth is the ancient and corrupt home planet of a star-hopping civilization.  The corruption comes from the fact that people have learned how to digitize their personalities and download themselves into new, or alternate, bodies at will -- for a price of course.  This has led to dominance of society by the wealthy, who have ample funds to procure and switch bodies and, to a large extent, are protected from feeling the consequences of their mistakes. (What else is new?)  Thus, the Earth dwellers tend to have an arrogance about life that is more pronounced than on other planets where human digitization is less frequent.<br /><br />On the face of it, humans would seem to be immortal.  As one reads this amazing novel, however, you come to suspect that there is something missing in these digital personalities, and that their moral bankruptcy is less a result of their arrogance, wealth and ennui than it is of something more sinister -- like the absence of a soul.  It becomes clear that in the course of entering and leaving multiple bodies -- or \\"sleeves\\" as bodies are called -- some small portion of a person's memory is lost.  This inevitably poses the question:  At what point does this duplicated personality (who is having new experiences that the original personality did not) become someone altogether new and unique?<br /><br />Working amidst the backdrop of this high-tech existential dilema is Kovacs, descended from the Slavs and Japanese who colonized his home planet, Harlan's World.  Retained against his will by a long-lived Earth dweller who is centuries old (referrerd to as a \\"meth\\" for Methusala), Kovacs must solve a mystery if he is to get his sweetheart out of \\"storage,\\" which is a sort of prison where her personality is stored in digital format.<br /><br />Kovacs encounters a host of odd personalities and dangerous situations in the course of his work, but ultimately solves the puzzle -- to his satisfaction at least, if not to that of all the other characters.  Along the way, the reader is treated to a lot of very clever manifestations of \\"the way things work\\" in Morgan's future universe.  He offers us nifty new inventions and customs, as well as new twists on old ideas.  In the end, even though the surface characteristics of Morgan's future are drastically different from our world of today, the basic human motivations, fears and aspirations are pretty much the same.  And that is the pleasure of this book.  People are people, no matter where, or when, you go.<br /><br />Takeshi Kovacs is a hip new hero who provides intelligent entertainment for readers, and who is likely to go on doing so in future novels of the series.  I enjoyed Altered Carbon very much and am looking forward to reading more about Takeshi Kovacs from Richard Morgan.timately solves the puzzle -- to his satisfaction at least, if not to that of all the other characters.

I first got hooked on the single \\"Somebody Told Me\\" and held off buying the album as I was unconvinced the rest could be filled with the pop-goodness. To my surprise it was.

The Grandaddy of grunge and the first take is good enough has wrapped his flannel sleeves around DVD Audio like a long awaited lover, and the format has responded well by showcasing what a joy and a revolution his protean catalogue has been. Inspite of the many bone-headed releases, and he holds a record for sustaining a career inspite of himself, Ol' Shakey has had some incredible efforts, the highlights of which are included here. Pick up any of his DVD Audio releases and you'll discover his stuff as though for the first time. I'm not sure Amazon is actually offering the DVD A, so, if not, return what you have ordered and go toa place like Tower and get the real thing. <br />As to the moron who made the quip about the paucity of Canadian Rock Stars, it's likely to fall ondeaf ears, but he may have overlooked a few major ones, albeit appropriated by the Yanks, without whom what you think of as rock would no way be as moving. Of course, that then leads you into the whole colonialist imperialism that is calling card below the 49th parallel. We'll leave that to another discussion. Let's just say it took a Canadian to point out the inconsistencies in the first Bush administration. Keep on rockin in the free world, Yank, you've near bankrupted it. Argentina or Brazil, anyone?
B0002XDODU|5.0|Okay, track to track breakdown: <br /> <br /> <br />Reise, Reise (10/10) - Great opener, the best song on the album. A classic anthem. <br /> <br />Mein Teil (9.5/10) - Probably their heaviest song to date. Based on the real-life incident of consensual cannibalism that happened not long ago in Germany. Would be 10/10 if the intro wasn't chopped off. <br /> <br />Dalai Lama (10/10) - From Goethe's \\"Erlknig Erlking,\\" a lot like Spieluhr. Nice build-up to the chorus, with a piano, and for the first time Olli sings. <br /> <br />Keine Lust (8/10) - Heavy, fast-tempo rocker in the vein of Manson. <br /> <br />Los (8.5/10) - Cool acoustic track. One for the highway. <br /> <br />Amerika (8/10) - Catchy, a little too pop, but it does feature an amazing guitar solo. <br /> <br />Moskau (10/10) - nice Sehnsucht-style melody with Viktoria Fersh singing in Russian with Till's low German. <br /> <br />Morgenstern (10/10) - An anti-love song with jazzy drumming, tons of choir, and some \\"Du Hast\\"-style vocals. <br /> <br />Stein um Stein (9/10) - seems inspired from Edgar Allen Poe's \\"The Cask of Amontillado\\". I like how Till makes the transition from singing like he wouldn't hurt a fly to a madman sealing you alive. <br /> <br />Ohne Dich (10/10) - very powerful ballad with Till's best singing that was written during the Mutter sessions. <br /> <br />Amour (9/10) - Flake gets a keyboard solo. Starts off slow but builds up to a fantastic finish with the choir and the \\"gib mir gift\\" part. <br /> <br /> <br />Overall, I'm very pleased with this album and unlike the last three, I can listen to it start to finish without skipping over any tracks, and that's saying something.
B000002H97|4.0|I have to say, while this is a good album, it is by no means Metallica's greatest.

I can't recall an original score being so perfectly mated to a movie. <br /> <br />For those of you thinking about buying the soundtrack you may notice that some reviewers mention there are some pieces that are left out, don't worry, buy the CD and you will find it quickly becomes one of your favorites.  <br /> <br />There are also reviewers who mention that \\"the professionals\\" rated the soundtrack very low. Think about how many times \\"the professionals\\" rated a movie, or album highly only to see it bomb, or the number of times \\"the professionals\\" panned a movie, or album only to see it become a success. My point is: if you like good music, ignore \\"the professionals\\". You will not be sorry. Even if you have never seen this movie you will enjoy the soundtrack, the music on it is good enough to stand on it's own.
0312263120|3.0|I felt the novel was too technical and very contrived. After reading the other Brown books, I can see that this was his first attempt, and it shows. He has the usual ticking clock and the short timeline for the story, but the plot seems unrealistic and the characters are nearly ludicrous.
068987474X|5.0|First, the audience is single women, but I passed this book around the nurses lounge at work and both MARRIED and single women recognized their loser husbands/ex's/S.O's.  No woman wants to tell another woman her partner is a loser, but luckily, this book does it for her. We women are so full of excuses for our losers as to why they are so boorish and how WE are the cause of their boorishness.  Enough already! <br />Second, the end point of this book is finding a good man to marry without changing yourself or tolerating or excusing bad behavior in men.  Other books suggest how to lure a man or change yourself to make yourself more appealing to men.  Enough of that garbage too!  Thank GOD this book exists.  It says, \\"You're fine.  Don't put up with garbage just so you don't have to be alone!\\"   <br />Third, and the only complaint I have about this book is that the endpoint of this book is marriage, i.e. if you get married, everything will be O.K.  Well, guess what?  As I said in the first section, somebody is marrying these boors and once you read it you may find out it was YOU!  Geeze, and to think I've been getting therapy for years to find out how/why I put up with so much garbage from my husband and men in general (boy I hope he doesn't read this) and what I really needed was a guy like the author to sit me down and tell me that ALL men don't act like my husband.  Uh oh here he comes.  Gotta go.
B000007T1M|3.0|Man, are these guys angry, I mean, wow, they are really really angry. Angry. Really. Like really angry. Mad at the world type angry. Angry in like a rap metal type way. Sorta like Rage Against The Machine but maybe angrier.  A N G R Y.
0689862725|5.0|I have not seen the pop-up version yet, but it sounds like a great idea.  My 13 yr old daughter and I have each read the book twice - we both found the book wonderfully frightening and emotionally upsetting, yet we both count this as one of our favorite books.  The book was in the older children's section of our library and is written at a level for children 10 yrs or older, although it might be too frightening for children under 12.  It is a very intense story if you put yourself in the shoes of Trisha, the girl lost in the woods, and you won't want to put the book down.  I believe the story was deliberately written in a slow moving manner because that is the way it would be if you were lost in the woods - one hour would seem like a day...  It is a survival story (physically, mentally & emotionally) and is a good story to introduce older children to the importance of being prepared before hiking or camping in the woods - there are many real dangers lurking in the wilderness...
B000001Y5J|3.0|Here, Trent Rezner actually still sounds convincing angry, although not in an interesting way. Broken sounded like a monster when it came out, but it was the last gasp for Nine Inch Nails, everything that came after sounded like the band was aping it's clones, sad, but true. In retrospect nothing by NIN sounds all that exciting or special, it's just by the numbers angry music for angry teens. If ya ain't angry your own self, it just sounds annoying. Includes an amusing, kitchy cover of the Adam Ant Track `You're So Physical' which, like the rest of this album, seemed hip at the time. The disc includes the obligatory hidden tracks, which seem so clever to artists but really just make the album annoying to listen to, is the disc over? Seems like it's still playing, what track is this, 72? WtF?
0395389496|5.0|This holiday delight warms the soul and brings out the holiday spirit in anyone who reads it.  Readers, both young and old, will enjoy the festive warmth that this selection generates.  It is definitely a great book to share with your children and loved ones this holiday season.  (The new motion picture is also excellent!!!  I'm sure that it will soon be considered a classic as well.)
B0002F6BRE|5.0|I'm not a big fan of Christmas movies. In fact, there are only two that I'll watch every year/every other year - A Christmas Story and The Santa Clause. That is, until I saw ELF in theatres last year. I have to say, this is the best Christmas movie I have ever seen - ELF is a fresh idea filled with great jokes that can be enjoyed by adults, teenagers, and kids. <br /> <br />ELF is a great Christmas movie - Buddy the Elf (Will Ferrell) is a bit...different than the rest of the elves in the North Pole. He's six-some feet tall, can't make toys all that fast, etc. One day, he finds out the awful truth - he's not really an elf. He's a human.  <br /> <br />Buddy goes on a quest to find his real family, and of course, he gets into tons of trouble on the way. This is where the real magic of ELF comes about. Will Ferrell is absolutely charming as Buddy, and I don't know how you could not fall in love with his sweet (but oh so naive) character. As I've said before, the jokes/one-liners are amazingly funny. <br /> <br />ELF is my favorite Christmas movie, and the jokes are always funny. Its cute, charming, and quick-witted. Of course, the end is a bit (okay, really, really) unbelieveable, but thats expected with a Christmas movie. Highly recommended <br /> <br />Overall grade - A+

B000001FS3|5.0|U2's Joshua Tree release from 1987 is a classic and essential for rock music lovers. This disk regularly makes the Top 50 best records of all time. An excellent bridge between the atmospheric experimentation of Unforgettable Fire and R&B tinged American feel of Rattle and Hum, Joshua Tree finds U2 leaving behind the edgy New Wave-ish sounds of their early releases for a fully realized and arena ready sound.<br /><br />The first four tracks alone are worth the purchase: \\"Where the Streets Have No Name\\" has a slow build, and then you feel like you've been propelled onto the back of a speeding train, with your hair blowing in the wind. \\"I Still Haven't Found What I've Looking For\\" has a spiritual theme and a gospel-like sound. \\"With or Without You\\" is U2's most moving ballad to that point. \\"Bullet the Blue Sky\\" is a simmering dark indictment of US policy in Central America in the 1980s. Bono's vocals are top-notch, as is the expert layering of guitars by The Edge. As always, Adam Clayton and Larry Mullen, Jr. hold down the rhythm section.<br /><br />Many of the songs in this cycle deal with themes pulled from the mythos of the old American West. \\"Running To Stand Still\\" with its twangy slide guitar and \\"Red Hill Mining Town\\" are full of such imagery.<br /><br />One of my favorite U2 songs is \\"In God's Country\\" with its powerful guitar parts and Bono's powerful vocal. There are beautiful lyrica couplets, such as \\"sleep comes like a drug...in God's country...sad eyes crooked crosses...in God's country.\\" At the end there are images of the Statue of Liberty. \\"Trip Through Your Wires\\" is a spiritual love ode with a nice jangly melody.<br /><br />\\"One Tree Hill\\" is a song for a departed friend of the band, Greg Carroll.<br /><br />As with most U2 releases, the disk closes with quiet, meditative pieces. In this case, \\"Exit\\" about a suicide and \\"Mothers of the Disappeared\\" about sons and daughters taken away by political regimes throughout the world. It's an Amnesty International song like Sting's \\"Gueca Solo\\" from the same period.<br /><br />So, front to back, this is a powerful set of songs.eca Solo\\" from the same period. <br />So, front to back, this is a powerful set of songs.
B0000024JN|5.0|This is a GREAT album.  Not a single bad song.  I EXTREMLEY reccomend it, whether you're a Beasties fan, a rock fan, or a hip-hop fan.  It's good music and the lyrics and so true nad can be funny.
B000060MWU|5.0|I think that the other reviewer below, Patrick B. Dandenault, was completely right in his guess of the story. The later part of the movie is imagination of Fred while he sits in his cell waiting for his execution. The screaming and smoke in the car at the very end of the movie when Fred is escaping police chase actually represent the execution at the electricity chair.  <br /> <br />This is a true masterpiece. Just don't try to understand everything and let it go. Lynch's movies are conceived and interpreted at a subconcious level. <br /> <br />The closest masterpieces are \\"Mulholland Drive\\", \\"Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me\\" (however makes sense only if you watched Twin Peaks) and \\"Fight Club\\" (by David Fincher). I saw a recommendation on Amazon about Memento and bought it, but I would rate that only 3 stars.
B0006A9FKA|5.0|As one might expect, SHAUN OF THE DEAD is a parodic remake of the classic George Romero film DAWN OF THE DEAD.  It pays frequent homage to the latter film through a host of direct references as well as its general subject matter (for instance, much of the \\"news\\" as read by the television presenters are lifted nearly word for word from Romero's script).  There differences are, however, marked.  Instead of an American location, this film is set in London.  And instead of holing up in a house to fight it out against the zombies, our heroes travel to a local pub.<br /><br />Although I thoroughly enjoyed this film, there is no question that not everyone finds this film that funny.  I'm not sure why that is, but I thought it would be fun to bat around some theories about why the reactions have been so diverse.  This is an important exercise for prospective viewers.  Are you more likely to side with those who find this to be a highly effective and funny farce or those who simply don't find anything funny at all?  So here are my speculations:<br /><br />First, I think some of those who do not like the movie failed to realize that this is an English comedy, with a very low-key, subdued approach to the story.  Before going to see this, I think a prospective viewer should answer is whether or not they enjoy MONTY PYTHON, Hugh Grant, THE OFFICE, and other British comic productions.  If the answer is \\"Yes\\" there is a high degree of probability that you will enjoy this one.  If the answer is \\"Absolutely not!\\" then you will almost certainly dislike this one.<br /><br />Second, I think some people, hearing the basic premise, imagine that this is going to be a bit like SCARY MOVIE or some other such parody of a genre.  I know for a fact that the couple sitting behind me in the viewing I went to had expectations along these lines.  They were expecting more out and out farce, a more frenetic pace, and far more jokes and cartoonish humor.  But because SHAUN OF THE DEAD is more deliberately paced, allows the absurd tale to unfold gradually, and the jokes rationed out more gradually, they were truly upset.<br /><br />I love British humor so I definitely fall more into the class of people apt to enjoy this.  I loved the pacing and subdued reactions of the main characters.  I loved, for instance, a pair of scenes that are allowed to unfold rather slowly.  The first occurs rather early in the movie when Shaun leaves his apartment and out of sheer habit walks across the street and down the sidewalk to the local corner store where he buys a couple of items.  The very same path is followed the next morning, with Shaun without thinking (almost zombie-like?) covers the same path to the store, utterly unaware of how dramatically everything has changed, of all the people he had seen the day before who had been transformed into zombies or been killed.  They were superbly executed scenes, and it is hard to imagine any American studio allowing a scene in a zombie comedy film to unfold so nicely.<br /><br />There are many wonderful scenes in the film, some very short and some a bit longer.  I loved, for instance, the store employee who interrupted a meeting to accept a call on his cell phone.  Or the extraordinary scene later in the film when, to get through a group of zombies, the group of friends mimic the behavior of zombies in order to get past them.  Their rehearsing their imitations of zombies was one of the best scenes in the film.  Bill Nighy, who pretty much stole the show (despite being part of an ensemble cast) in LOVE ACTUALLY as the burned out rock musician, is in a number of nice moments in a regretfully small part.<br /><br />I really loved the great teamwork between stars Simon Pegg and David Frost.  Both had worked together before on TV in SPACED, and Pegg co-wrote the screenplay with director Edgar Wright, also of SPACED.  The cast as a whole is quite strong, though I did find the character of David to be just a tad too irritating.<br /><br />All in all, I really had a great time seeing this one and I would strongly recommend it to anyone who enjoys British humor.  But if overly broad, in-your-face American style farce along the lines of SCARY MOVIE is what you want, you'd better skip this one.and I would strongly recommend it to anyone who enjoys British humor.

6305546797|5.0|WOW, what a special edition.  I made sure to buy this movie because I know that they only made a few and then they will be gone. I remember that I purched the Laserdisk version that I was able to hear the commintaries. It was very interesting they way they filmed some of the scenes.  For example, the scene where Laurie sees Michael behind the buch, walking home with Annie, Annie runs up to the bush to find nobody there.  She turnes and yells at Laurie \\"Lauie dear, he wants to talk to you.\\" One can see smoke float in front of the camera.  Well, that is where John was smoking while behind the camera. Also, the scene where the samera is on Laurie and Tommie.  They are walking to school, and the camera is across the street.  Well the dolly wheels were squeeking way to much, that the 2 actors had to rerecord their diolog and then loop it in later. It would have been nice to see Nick Castle (the shape) appear in the second Halloween. The scene where Michael slashes Laurie on her shoulder and causes her to fall of the second story stair case.  Well, you see Laurie fall back first off the railing, then a cut.  John had placed a camera on a bungie cord and then \\"dropped\\" the camera toward the bottom of the stairs. Thus the effect of looking like Laurie is \\"falling\\" with the camera, but not really. John did want to see a second one made at all. I think that he did a good job on expanding the story to different angles in Halloween 2.  I will not give you the details about Halloween 2 but is a good sequel. I wish that this edition were still avail. I guess that you can find it used.  For you die hard Halloween fans that cannot get enough try to get this version,  you will be glad that you did....
B00008ADPF|5.0|I was surprised by some of the reviews for this CD, that people thought it wasn't any good.  I grew up in the early eighties when good music was actually good.  What a lot of people call good music today is a sad substitute to what we used to listen to.  I'm 38 years old now, mother of two and Nickelback reminds me of the music we used to listen to.  I like the entire CD and in fact have about wore it out.  I'm not sure how anyone can find this unenjoyable.  Well, I take that back.  My daughter is a rap freak and she doesn't like Nickelback either but that's because she wouldn't know good music if she heard it simply because she's grown up in the era of thinking rap was good.
B00000IP4H|5.0|This is one of Testament's BEST albums to date (in my opinion). I started getting into death metal in the late 90's with bands like Entombed, Bolt Thrower, and a few others. I am a big fan of many good death meatal bands now, but am still very picky about which ones.<br /><br />  Having said that, if you know anything about death metal, then you also know that death metal vocalists around the globe sat on the ends of their beds and weeped after hearing Chuck's amazing and natural ability without giving up any clarity. No other death metal vocalist that I've ever heard even comes close to the amazing and natural depth to Chuck's voice that is on this record! And just because something isn't fast doesn't mean that it's not heavy! Quite the contrary my metal brothers and sisters. The end of PANTERA'S  'THIS LOVE' breakdown, at the end of that song throws that theory right out of the window.<br /><br /> Yeah, Gene's superhuman double bass footwork isn't exactly showcased here, but can't a brother stretch his horizon's? This album is about showing others what a REAL solid metal band with REAL integrity is capable of if they choose to pursue a different avenue. Many times it's harder to successfully play a slow solid destroyer, than it is to be able to miss a few notes shredding thru something like Megadeth's HOLY WARS or somethin'. Testament did this album solely to please themselves and hopefully open the minds of many of their fans as well. I was on the same wavelength  with the guys when this came out, so I listened to it many times over with much pleasure. I'm writing this review because I need to buy another copy of this album 'cuz mine is scratched, and saw all of the lame, snap judgement reviews.<br /><br />  So if you're a REAL Testament fan (even if you don't like death metal) I suggest that you buy it anyway and try to open your mind up just a little bit and see what they were trying to accomplish (and did) on, in my humble view,is one of the best \\"death metal\\"albums in many years.
0441003257|4.0|I read this book because it sounded interesting, and it was. With a dry British humor throughout, you'll enjoy the interesting characters. Crawly who was the snake from Eden loves his Bently car, Queen's greatest hits, and the Earth in general. Along with an angel, he wants to stop the Battle of Armegeddon for two reasons; he loves the Earth (except for the boring 14th Century) and the alternative is Hell of course and he's trying to avoid it.<br /><br />The Witch Hunter Sergeant is a hoot and by far the most colorful and funny character. With phrases such as \\"How many nipples ye got laddie?\\" you can't help but love him.<br /><br />The anti-Christ named Adam was switched at birth at the Satanic order of the Chattering nuns hospital, but it was a botched job. You really got to read the book to appreciate this part.<br /><br />Of course no book about Armegeddon would be complete without a visit from space aliens, Tibetans tunneling through the earth, a high speed chase through phone lines, and a 'nice' book that tells the future.<br /><br />Of course it was genious for the Four Horsemen to trade in their horses for Motorcycles. War (a hot babe), Death, Famine, and Pollution (Pestellance retired) now wear Hell's Angels jackets. But can they really get to the nuclear power plant before a floating moped carrying a prostitute possessed by an angel and the witch-hunter?
B000002IKR|5.0|A girl that I met back in '87,when I was 18, at the Shriner's hospital in Chicago while I was recovering from a spinal chord injury that I sustained a few months earlier bought this cassette (at the time) for me because she and her family was going to the local mall that day and insisted that I tell her a tape/cassette to get for me that day. Well, this was the tape I asked for. It took me a few listens to really get what the band was doing, but immediatley dug it because I was into much of the San Fran thrash bands that spewed out of the bay area at that time. This album got me thru alot of crap while staying at that rehab hospital. My  buddy in the bunk across from me was not so impressed because he was soaking up Slayer's 'Reighn in Blood' at that time. We traded tapes for an hour or so, and he didn't like it because it had too much melody, he said. lol. And although I liked 'Reighn in Blood', I wasn't ready to graduate to that kind of destruction until a year later or so. LOL. Steve Souza (vocals for Exodus), originally was to do this record but fell out to join Exodus around the last minute. I'm not sure where Chuck came from, but nevertheless, history was made! That's why in many of THE LEGACY'S songs Chuck uses his voice much in the same manner Steve might have, although as we all know, Chuck is probably the greatest thrash metal/death metal vocalist around!!! Chuck's vocals on the Demonic album blows away ANY death metal vocals I've ever heard, including George from Cannibal Corpse, with great natural depth and control that is just superhuman. The original title of Testament, was Legacy, but I guess the 2 names were a toss up, so they kept Legacy for their 1st album title. <br />  Anywho! If you want one of the 10 best thrash albums of all time in your collection, then quit stalling, and get into one of the best and talented bands to rise up out of the bay area, as well as the 80's!  DISCIPLES OF THE WATCH! OBEY! OR I' <br />LL BURN YA TO THAT CROSS!! (offof the lp THE NEW ORDER by the Testament boys.)
B00005JMXX|4.0|Aright, You're all right, this movie has a really weak plot, but I think the best thing for you people who have nothing better to do than bitch because the plot sucked, or \\"there wasn't enough sword fighting\\", Really need to get a bottle of qualudes, a pack of razor blades, and run yourself a warm bath. This movies great in the fact you don't have to think to hard. You can just sit back and let it take you, or turn it on for back ground noise when you're doing something else, and probably turn around and stop what you're doing because you just caught one of the eye popping special effects scenes.<br /><br />You people who think that the only good movies are those that make you think and go hmmm, are fools. You're all probably the self absorbed idiots who watched Magnolia and thought it was a freaking masterpiece.<br /><br />So for you, The other People who just want to watch a movie and not take anything to seriously, and just be WOWed by special effects then this is the movie for you.... Have Fun and Enjoy.
B000000OPZ|5.0|If you grew up in the 80's, like I did, then you know this album brings back alot of great memories. To quickly answer one of my fellow reviewers, John Sykes came out of Thin Lizzy after Gary Moore left and Phil Lynott died from a overdose and a broken heart. I also recommend most everything from Thin Lizzy, too. Me and my 2nd best friend used to crank this album (cassette)up every morning before school and on the weekends cruising around in his father's '82 black Cross-fire injected Corvette Stingray.<br /><br />  John Sykes is, by far, one of the best rock/metal guitarists in the  world! If you love his sound like I do, go out and get his band Blue Murder, as well. John's vocals are reminiscent of Coverdale and Phil Lynott on his records. Many of the guys who recorded this album left for different reasons before all of the videos were made with Rudy and Vivian in them. Vivian should have stayed in Dio and continued to shred like he used to, in my humble opinion, but I digress.<br /><br /> Every song is pretty much a good rocker. I normally skip over 'straight from the heart', but it's definately a great road trip or party album. David Coverdale comes from that school of vocalists like Dio, Ian Gillan, Paul Rodgers and of course Robert Plant, and he has never sounded better than on this album, I believe, due to the slick, and masterful production that was produced on this album. Although I feel corny sometimes when this cd is played at get togethers today because I used to dis many hairbands that, looking back, I really liked, I realize how good this album really was, and how great the musicians were who played on this album. All things with Coverdale and/or Sykes in them, in my opinion is a winner! Get this classic monster record and take an hour or so trip back to yesteryear. If you really want to hear a massive shredding solo, check out my man John Sykes ripping it up on 'BAD BOYS'.. track 2.
B0002EXH5O|5.0|Rust in Peace is arguably the quintessential Megadeth album. The album is truly amazing, but since recording music wasn't as technologically advanced as they are today, the mix sounded a little flat. Picking up the re-master was excellent. The bass was solid, the guitar work great as always, and even the re-done drums sound good, especcially the snare. Oh yeah, for the Avril fan, you wouldn't know good guitar playing if it took a dump on your face. The guitarist for Avril Lavigne just strums bar chords, while Megadeth has solid riffs and solos that are extremely intricate. Anywhom, that's my 2 cents. Get this album!
B0002XDODU|5.0|I have never been disappointed with this band, almost everything they do I love. Their latest work features two songs fairly typical of their style, Reise Reise and Mein Teil, even in Mein Teil Till explores more vocal range. Dalai Lama is my personal favorite just for its different structure and wide range of vocals. A previous reviewer mentioned Amerika as sounding rather pop, I think that was intentional as the song derides American cultural imperialism, including music.  <br />  I think Till's delving into poetry also helped him develop his lyrical skills as many of the songs feature more intricate lyrics some make use of clever word play.  <br />  A great album that shows the band growing as artists of 'Music designed to annoy your parents' 'Paul Landers'
B0000931QR|5.0|La Oreja de Van Gogh delivers yet again another astounding recording.  It seems they only keep getting better, you can even listen to each album and notice how everything evolves: the lyrics, the music, the voices.  Amaia has grown into one of the most talented singers in my opinion, with the power in her voice to give each song a different quality.  From the exciting, pumping, energetic feeling in \\"Puedes Contar Conmigo\\" and \\"20 de enero\\", to the wishful, hopeful ambiance of \\"Deseos de Cosas Imposibles\\", to the soft, sincerity, and beatiful lyrics in \\"Rosas\\", and even a sense of forceful strentgh delivering \\"Un mundo mejor\\", \\"La Paz de tus Ojos\\" and \\"Perdoname\\".  Undoubtedly their best, and every song has a different feeling, message, and tone.  It's one of those CD's you can leave running from start to finish without skipping. It's got something for everyone without settling into any parameters; it's not pop, it's not rock, it's not mid-tempo or ballads, or any specific genre. For me it's caught somewhere in between with a beatiful twist.  I highly recommend it as well as their new DVD which includes their 2003 Tour concert and a CD with the entire concert featuring their all-time hits.
0784011176|5.0|I loved 'The Piano.' <br /> <br />AND the reason I looooooved the Emperor's new clothes is because I personally designed them! <br /> <br />I've just ordered the DVD for my collection because I loved the setting of the plot and sometimes want to escape to New Zealand, Why?  Because I need to escape the bombardment of the news of the current war/s and their inevetable consequences. <br /> <br />Movies were created I imagine, for us ordinary folk to escape for a couple of hours; get entertained, let our hair down. I believe The Piano provided us that service.  <br /> <br />What's wrong with Harvy's member being shown on screen?  Everyone's father has/had one! (Shame-based assumptions are, in my opinion, possible signs of emotional or mental instability and quite unhealthy.)
B000002AGE|5.0|Blessed be. The oldest band member is fifty-three years older than the youngest member. Some are Black, some are White, one is Asian. All are extraordinarily talented musicians and artists. This charge into ubiquity is touch-starred by the gift known as \\"Birdland\\". A composition omni-present that unfolds like a teaching of the history of man. Everything is there. Tom-toms and Stratocasters, smoke signals and keyboards, snare drums and calliope. I speak not for collections, but for music itself. Give it a chance; you'll be floored.

He mocks people's personalities, and promotes littering. It's all quite sick. None-the-less, it is indeed fun on the sociopath level. The &#34;IN YOUR FACE&#34; blasphemy and disregard for all authority is @ least accompanied by a rush of entertaining music and lyricism. &#62;&#62;&#62;&#62; a humorous and well disciplined party set.

Why did Nixon authorize his plumbers to falsify Daniel Ellsberg's medical records in a desperate attempt to discredit him? For What It's Worth, something is happening here. But something more than protest. This anthology of 60s rock/folk ballads is energizing. The love and joy signaled by the Bluebird of happiness, the heady heart of the Rock and Roll Woman, the message as delivered by Mr. Soul, and the apathy that befalls Clancy, speak volumes for a generation guided by the deceit of thier very own leadership. Oh yes, this thrush of pioneers known collectively as Buffalo Springfield produced some of the most serviant and accessible music of the 60s. Just a listen, and you're hooked. The cast included core members of the Yardbirds, the Byrds, CSN, and Poco. The talent here is undeniable, and this stuff is super ez on the ears. Time Travel: I believe the only way to traverse the time barrier is to become fluent in a dead language. The language of the 60s died decades ago. Thank the Godesses and Gods that a record of that zeitgeist remains extant. And it is called \\"Buffalo Springfield\\". Lovely beyond report.
B0000VD04M|4.0|How ironic can it be? Tim Burton's 1994 comedy, \\"Ed Wood\\" is a really great film, about an absolutely terrible, film-maker. Ever since the book \\"The Golden Turkey Awards\\" highlighted the movies of Edward D. Wood Jr. as the 'worst films ever made', there has been a cult-like fascination with this man and his art. Here was a Director, who created movies, that were so lousy and inept, that today's audiences consider them, 'unintentional' comedies. They still remain more popular than ever, celebrated for their mediocrity. Tim Burton's movie \\"Ed Wood\\" looks at a short, yet very creative period in Wood's life (during the 1950's) in which he created such cinematic non-masterpieces as \\"Glen or Glenda?\\", \\"Bride of the Monster\\" and the pinacle of bad films, \\"Plan 9 from Outer Space\\". Ed (actor, Johnny Depp in a terrific performance) is protrayed as an optimistic, wannabe-artist, who is truely inspired to make his dreams and visions come true. Unfortunately, he was also truely untalented with no money and hardly any resources. The film comically looks at how with the help of his girlfriend, Delores (Sara Jessica Parker) and a stock company of 'fringe' actors, technicians and some rather 'colorful' friends, he struggled to get his grade-Z film epics, financed and made. An important sub-plot of the film is the friendship/business relationship Wood had with the actor, Bela Lugosi (Martin Landau) . At this point in his career the elderly, horror actor was addicted to drugs, living in near poverty and was considered \\"all washed up\\" by the major studios. The film shows how the star-struck, Wood befriended Lugosi and gave him some employment in his final years. Director, Tim Burton has made a really great film about creativity, inspiration and making one's dreams come true. Also, he continues with the themes, that seem to run throughout most of his films of the 'normality' and humanity of people, who are considered 'outsiders' or abnormal by the rest of society. A good example of this is the gentle humor the film bestows apon Ed Wood's unabashedly positive view of his own transvestism and obsession with angora sweaters. The whole cast of the movie is fantastic in their protrayal of these quirky characters. Johnny Depp holds the film together in his great vision of the title character. Kudos also for wonderful, comic acting turns held by both Bill Murray and Jeffrey Jones as Wood's proudly eccentric show biz friends.They made me giggle every time they were on screen. But the real scene stealer is actor Martin Landau's mesmerizing protrayal of Bela Lugosi. This guy really does 'become' the old time Dracula star and roundly deserves his 1994 Academy Award for this role. Finally, mention should be made of Cinematographer, Stephan Czapsky's beautiful, black & white photograpy, which really invokes the old time horror movies of yesteryear. After a long wait, this film has finally made it to the DVD formatt in a \\"Special Edition\\". The picture is crystal clear and the sound is well done. Extras include commentary from Burton and the movie's writers, theatrical trailers and a number of featurettes about the film's shooting, makeup & special effects. This movie is an interesting and humorus look at how we are inspired to create no matter how inept the outcome turns out. Highly recommended!s is the gentle humor the film bestows apon Ed Wood's unabashedly positive view of his own transvestism and obsession with angora sweaters. The whole cast of the movie is fantastic in their protrayal of these quirky characters. Johnny Depp holds the film together in his great vision of the title character. Kudos also for wonderful, comic acting turns held by both Bill Murray and Jeffrey Jones as Wood's proudly eccentric show biz friends.They made me giggle every time they were on screen.

B000002UAR|5.0|If you love rock music, and the music of The Beatles, then this album is like the air.  I have no idea how many times I have listened to Revolver, but it never gets tiresome or old. If you start playing it, then you just have to listen all the way through, it doesn't seem right if you stop or skip songs, it is such a complete entity.  It is all about life, taxes, money love, loss, childhood, confusion, and opening your little mind. Definitely one of the greatest rock albums ever.
B0002Z9HT8|5.0|I was only eight when LIVE AID occured, and yet the memory of that day is one of the most vivid memories of my childhood. I can remember my mother waking me up at 7am and walking downstairs to our living room and watching the majority of the concert the rest of the day with my cousin.  It left a lasting impression on me and I, like many others, have been waiting years for this.<br /><br />Was it worth the wait? Yes, of course. Even in its heavilty edited form, I can still say that something is better than nothing.<br /><br />Watching this DVD is like flipping through an old rock or fashion magazine from the summer of 1985.  The hair, the fashion, the music- it's all there!  The fact that most of these performances haven't seen the light of day in nearly twenty years makes it all the more special.<br /><br />While there are several highlights, there is no denying that the show is stolen by the likes of QUEEN and U2.  But even the bands that sound bad are still entertaining to watch!<br /><br />Much has been made about the fact that there are several hours worth of performance footage missing, and I too would have liked to have seen more, but the fact that LIVE AID was ever released commercially is a miracle in itself.  Bob Geldof didn't even want the BBC or MTV to record the event.  It was his intention to have it be a one-off \\"global jukebox\\" and then disappear into history, only to be talked about by those who remember it.<br /><br />If there is one thing I would have liked to have seen, I suppose it would have been some of the backstage interviews and antics. I wish they included some of the begging and pleading that the artists and announcers made to the viewers at home.  It would have been nice if they had recreated the whole pandemonium, chaos and energy of the day by including some of these backstage moments.<br /><br />With a few shortcomings aside, it's wonderful to finally have LIVE AID on DVD.  July 13th, 1985 was possibly the most important day in rock and roll history and it's great to be able to relive some of the madness, tackiness and good music of that day....even if it's just in small doses!t to be able to relive some of the madness, tackiness and good music of that day....even if it's just in small doses!
B0000027RL|5.0|The instrumentation was laid down by the remnants of Mother Love Bone in 1990, after singer Andy Wood's death. A dub tape of the recordings found its way to Ed Vedder, at the time the lead singer of Bad Radio and a surfer in San Diego. Listening to the tape while surfing, Vedder began to formulate semi-autobiographical lyrics about troubled home life and psychosis, and history was made. The band refined their sound on subsequent records, but it's true that they never quite captured the passionate, disturbed edge that defines Ten as a grunge essential.
B00068IOWM|4.0|This is a really great album! It has some real classics on it like miracle drug and city of blinding lights. These are both breathtaking songs. I was almost hypnotized by them. Beautiful lyrics and awesome melody!!!  <br /> <br />The reason why I give this album only four stars is because bono is a bit loosing the voice he once had. He'll never sing songs like \\"pride\\" again the way he once sang them. His voice has changed. Don't get me wrong, his voice has changed but is still one of the best on this planet. The only thing is... the music remains like it has always been but with a voice like that they should try to make some more songs like \\"all because of you\\". The part where he starts to shout, that's the kind of music he should sing more often. Combined with those hypnotizing songs like \\"miracle drug\\" and \\"city of blinding lights\\" they should be able to make the world's first perfect album. <br /> <br />On the whole this album is fantastic. But to know what U2 is all about, you should buy all their records. They've rocked for more then 2 decades and are still going. Bono sings songs like he never did and he sang songs like he never will again. This band has done it all. These lads experienced an evolution of time and they were always the first in line to understand what their time was about.  <br /> <br />Congrats U2. This is another great album and like almost every album they made, it will have songs that will change the charts of greatest hits in history.
B0002XH9Z4|5.0|CHECK OUT THE BOOKLET INSIDE!!!        I don't know how many people noticed this - I just picked up on it myself four days after purchasing this - but on each page in the insert book are little icons of Jacko in the lower right corner. It's a flip-book of him doing the moonwalk and ending with that trademark whirlwind spind and tip-toe freeze he does. It's kinda neat and easy to overlook.     See my previous review here at Amazon for details about the boxset itself. OnE thing I forgot to focus on mentioning in that review is how beautiful the packaging is - box, booklet, the discs themselves. This little discovery makes it all the more awesome! It really is a great addition to display in your cd library... and the music is great - it is the definative (and yes, \\"Ultimate\\") Jackson collection. Even though many gripe of buying many a Jackson hits already, toss 'em and get this. Thay are not complete - this is. HIStory is missing a ton of stuff and Number Ones is just a pathetic marketing tool. The answer to the problem is here! If someone had no idea why Michael Jackson is so popular, this would be the thing to give them. One listen and they'd get it!     Anyway, GO, SEE THE BOOK INSIDE IF YOU OWN THIS AND HAVEN'T NOTICED YET!    PS    Pick this up at Target or Best Buy for under $30. Also, If you are a fan, the new Bon Jovi boxset is $30 at Target only - lowest price around for that one. Enjoy both!!!!!     ORIGINAL REVIEW; 11/16/04:     Lets just get this out of the way for those who assume my 5-star review is based on my being part of Michael Jackson's \\"rapidly dwindling cult,\\" as one Amazon review put it:  These days it is hard to get behind Michael Jackson.  I say that as somebody who has shouted myself hoarse defending him, but finally am admitting to myself that no matter what the truth to what we hear, the guy is just stranger than fiction.  That, by the way, is not a crime and may also explain why he is responsible for some of the best music of the 20th century:  To quote a general when asked why the military would hire a maniac to build weapons for national defense, \\"sane people don't build things like this!\\"  I can admit though, it has gotten out of control.  I can also sympathise with complaints that Michael Jackson has a)been recycling hits far to often and b) seems incapable of reinventing himself and staying relevent with new material.    There.  That said may five star rating is based on the music and this set alone, not compaired to previous sets or how many other sets are already out there.  Forget all that, forget the controversy and unproven allegations.  JUST LISTEN.  This collection is the stuff off legends.  And remember.  Back to before all this goofy and sad stuff that got in the way of the music, because the music is what it should be all about and this is one of the strongest collections by any artist in history.  It is even more-so impressive when you consider Michael's fairly small amount of studio albums, against say the Beatles or the Stones.  This is a five cd boxset of all hits from a guy who didn't have much more than five solo albums.    That's the defense; now for the fans who want to know if they need more MJ or if the higher box set price is worth it.  Die-Hards don't need me to tell them, they're already in line, everyone else consider this:  HIStory was half-assed.  If it was two discs of all hits it would have gotten the job done.  I love that album, but as a greatest hits it is severely lacking.  Also that was nearly 10 years ago.  Number Ones was even worse.  Songs were edited, it didn't really imrove on HIStory, and it seemed like a marketing ploy, even more so in lue of this collection just a year away.  The label should have just waited to release this package instead.  Also, and this is the best part, this set has Jackson 5 and Jacksons era hits never before included with Michael's solo hits and there are a handful of never before released songs - all of them good.  You can't beat that.  Plus a DVD of the 1992 Dangerous concert which is great for any fan - there aren't going to be too many concert DVD's from Jacko I'm sorry to say, so this is something to have. (Minor quibble:  where are Scream, Blame it On the Boogie, Cry, Human Nature, Working Day and Night, In the Closet, Give In to Me and Will You Be There?  They were all singles.)    I was worried after the hack-job that was Number Ones, but the label really came through with this one.  It's well put together and vividly packaged.    Forget the B.S.  Just listen and I guarantee you will remember what you forgot:  MJ is one of the greats.  This box does his legacy proud!
B000009QO6|4.0|Danzig, taken out of one Misfits rib, a few times great vocalists leave a legendary band to crate a new one , a new legend , examples: Lee Dorrian leaves Napalm Death to form Cathedral, Bill Steer leaves Carcass to put together Firebird and Glen Danzig leaves Misfits to give birth to Danzig, awesome vocals , a mixture between Elvis and Morrison, with sabathesque influences in musical terms , \\"mother\\" is quite a classic , \\"twist of cain\\" deligthfull, \\"possesion\\" overwhelming, a true unique sound , 70 s sound with dark influences  <br />great album, you have to taste this band. <br />Trust me. <br />HM

Why don't some of you guys quit complaining & simply buy a multi region DVD like so many of us in  England. <br /> <br />On the DVD itself - the Wembley concert sent most of us footie fans a little dewy eyed - sadly this great place is no more than a building site right now .Queen & U2 were easily the best & show that quality will out . <br /> <br />DO NOT BUY the new version of  Band Aid Xmas song - it stinks so bad it's like having an over-ripe Stilton coming out of the speakers.
B00004XPPE|4.0|In 1963 Columbia Studio had a bad bout of cognitive dissidence. They were developing two projects that were like fraternal twins, DR. STRANGELOVE and FAIL SAFE; both based on best selling novels. Stanley Kubrick, who wrote and directed DR. STRANGELOVE, threatened to quit, or sue everyone in sight. Columbia decided to release STRANGELOVE first. This was a bonehead political decision, not an artistic one. Kubrick had decided that the subject of nuclear holocaust was too intense to present in a straight dramatic fashion, so he created a classic farce out of it. In retropect we can see STRANGELOVE is a comedy classic, but I would submit that the audiences, the world of 1964 needed a good dose of drama, of grim pessimism, of unclouded ascerbic rhetoric, and more awareness of how close we were to the brink, and to the haphazardness of accidental and total nuclear destruction.<br /><br />FAIL SAFE was shot in black and white, starkly lit, and presented to us like a short jab to the solar plexus. It has been called a \\"Cold War film noir\\", and it certainly was that. It's plot hook was clarion; through a series of human and computer errors, an American squadron of Vindicator bombers would lose contact with SAC, and would end up flying past the \\"fail-safe\\" zone, and head into enemy territory by mistake. The pilots were trained to disregard all radio transmissions. Ed Binns did a fine job of playing the pilot, Major Jack Grady. So even when the President got through to him, and his own wife was put on the horn, he switched them off, and proceeded toward his top secret target--Moscow.<br /><br />Sidney Lumet directed this film. He had a reputation for being a director with a lot of technical knowledge, nurtured for decades while doing live drama on televsion during the Golden Age of the 1950's. He also was known as a director who could get top notch performances from his cast. He was applauded as an \\"Actor's Director.\\" He, also, had an extensive career working as an actor on Broadway, and before that in Yiddish theatre. He believed in rehearsing the material, and this paid off with solid performances from the entire cast.<br /><br />Walter Matthau played Professor Groeteschele. This was a complex role. The character had to be Kissinger on crack, a civilian defense consultant who believed in probabilites and percentages and America striking first. He has always been very effective in dramatic roles, even though he is mostly remembered for his comedic ones. Henry Fonda as the President was excellent. He was so good, we wished he could have really been President, rather than say an actor like Ronald Reagan. Fonda displayed just the right amount of humanity, strength, humility, and heart. He pulled it off magnificently.<br /><br />Fonda was helped immensily by Larry Hagman, playing Buck, the interpreter. Before he dreamed of Jeannie, before he monogrammed J.R. on his lapel, he was just this skinny bright-eyed kid who could act; showing subtlety and compassion. My favorite character was Brig. General Warren Black, played by Dan O'Herlihy. He represented the voice of reason, the good man immersed in a bad situation. He was an old school chum of the President's, who called him \\"Blackie\\". When the President decided to sacrifice NYC as a token of our sorrow for nuking Moscow, it was Blackie he had to trust to drop the payload; even though the First Lady, and Black's family were in town.<br /><br />FAIL SAFE as a film came at you like a rocket sled; relentless, austere, unblinking, and graphic. There was no comic relief, and no musical score. The message was crystal clear.

B0002Z9HT8|4.0|The video and audio clean ups done make this package really jump out.  I popped the first DVD and was blown away by the sound and crispness of picture.  The indexing on the four disks is nicely done too - allowing you to jump to certain artists if you like or view the concert from a single venue of you want. <br /> <br />Yes, there are performances missing, but the key identifying numbers for most artists are there.  Plus, as the liner notes indicate, some footage was just plan lost over the years so it could not be restored. <br /> <br />For a music fan of the time period, this is a nice concert package.  I'm giving one to my brother for Christmas.
0783226837|5.0|TREMORS is one of modern cinema's classic sci-fi/horror movies.  Blessed with an intelligent script, tight direction, a marvelous cast and startling special effects, this movie set a standard for monster films to come.<br /><br />Fred Ward and Kevin Bacon have a remarkable chemistry, and it's too bad they didn't come back for the sequels.  At any rate, their swaggering machismo and down to earth good guy smirks carry this movie.  Add a devilishly clever Reba McEntire and Michael Gross as survivalists who have enough ammunition to fight WWIII, a down home sexiness of Finn Carter, and some really creepy worms and you have the ingredients for this classic picture.  A credit to all involved, TREMORS is one film to watch again and again, it's that fun.

She writes for all of us about wonder- the wonder of everyday life; the small things; the touching things; the things that make you say, yes, this is the human heart; all of these are her fictional world, much as they are our pasts, and our presents. This is a strong collection and an excellent place to get to know what she is about. After this, explore her backlist. My personal favorite besides this is an early collection called,The Moons of Jupiter, which is still in print in a nice paperbak format. I hope you enjoy discovering her as much as I have.

B000000W5N|5.0|\\"Sticky Fingers\\" has probably shown up on every \\"best-ever album\\" list that's been put together since its release, more than thirty years ago. (The author of any such list that does not include it should be promptly \\"volunteered\\" for duty in Iraq.)<br /><br />The real issue is whether or not it should be at the top of the lists. Good arguments can be made for at least two dozen other LP's, but it would be hard for me not to put \\"Sticky Fingers\\" at numero uno.<br /><br />I have to put it at the top of the list of best Stones albums too. \\"Let It Bleed\\" and \\"Exile\\" are masterpieces in their own right, but nothing Mick and the boys did before or have done since this one comes close to its range. It demonstrates the band's uncanny ability to write unforgettable pop songs employing the blues, hard-edged rock, country, and romantic balladry. It also showcases Mick Taylor, who was able to inject guitar wizardry into a band that otherwise has never been known for its virtuosity with musical instruments. Some of the songs reflect Jagger's ability, as a lyricist, to be downright gentle (\\"Wild Horses\\") and soul-searchingly introspective (\\"Sway\\" and \\"Moonlight Mile\\"), an ability that, unfortunately, his words have never really displayed since.<br /><br />The Rolling Stones have never been my favorite group, but their songwriting brilliance is indisputable, and I don't think it's captured better anywhere than in \\"Sticky Fingers.\\"

I enjoyed every single minute of reading this book. Fantastic.

I laughed so hard. Maybe it wasn't meant to be funny. But it was funny.
0316666343|4.0|I've always wondered what heaven would be like; The Lovely Bones gave me a good idea of how to look at heaven. The novel is basically about a young girl who was murdered, now she is in heaven looking down on everyone while they are trying to find the murderer. She also tries guiding people in the right direction of the killer. Overall her help is very useful to everyone who is in search of the killer. Through this story not only did the characters learn a lot about themselves, but also I've learned to view death differently and it's not such a terrible part of life. <br /> Susie Salmon, a fourteen-year-old girl, was raped and then killed by an older next-door neighbor, who goes by the name of George Harvey. Since there was very little evidence Susie tries to guide everyone in the right direction of the murderer.   I think that The Lovely Bones was a very exciting and interesting book. Alice Sebold made the story very detailed so it made everything more intense to read. She described the rape scene, Susie's death, and her idea of heaven very deeply, which makes everything more clear to the reader. This book is very dramatic but also has many other elements to it, which makes it worth it to read.  <br />

0800177177|4.0|Although I was very impressed with Winona Ryder's portrayal of Mina, and Keanu Reeves did a good, if not wonderful, performance of Harker, I was disturbed by the eccentric/mad doctor portrayal of Van Helsing. In many of the Dracula books and movies out both recently and in earlier times, Van Helsing is portrayed as a very clinical, correct person, passionate about his work and sure in his knowledge but not straying to the point of madness. Hopkins plays a fuzzy headed, fast talking eccentric more worthy of a Victor Frankenstien than an Abraham Van Helsing. <br /> <br />I have to point out that while some of the acting in the movie was extremely overdone, Gary Oldman did a superb job. His portrayal of the legendary vampire not only as an instrument of evil but as a somewhat sympathetic character lent a macabre but attractive quality to the character, making us feel like we could almost fall in love with danger. It may not be exactly how the book portrays him, but it most definitely works (one also points out that the book was written through the eyes of the humans, not the vampire). <br /> <br />All in all, a good movie, sticking about as close to the novel as you can expect cinema to get.

B00000AFGM|4.0|In 1996, Marilyn Manson shocked us all with his masterwork, The Antichrist Superstar (basically NIN's the downward spiral part 2). From that point, he caught the commercial mainstream off guard. But here, we are living in 1998 and the singer has lightened his tone.  <br /> <br />Mechanical Animals is a much more fascinating exploration in ethereal sonic atmosphere than Superstar. Early 70's Bowie a la Ziggy Stardust era was obviously a blueprint . . . something critics nailed Manson for ripping off.   <br /> <br />This is a sci-fi concept involving the jaded, strange, drug-induced adventures of Omega (the dope show ; i don't like the drugs).  He is seemingly emotionless on the surface, but the demon does in fact have a heart once \\"the lights are on\\". This is evidenced in coma white. <br /> <br />The only downfalls to Mechanical Animals are : <br /> <br />1. that detailed story is hard to follow at times  <br /> <br />2. Mr. Manson was slighty more appealing as the doomsday industrial shock-rocker we'll more likely remember him as.

B0002Z9HT8|5.0|I think that as far as live concerts go, this one is one of the biggest of our era.     As far as benefits go, I think that we'll be seeing more like \\"Tsunami Aid\\" and \\"America A Tribute To Heroes\\" which are more easier to assemble on a soundstage in comparison or the occasional \\"Concert for NYC\\" after 9/11 and Freddie Mercury tribute (which would be in the same venue 7 years later), but nothing like this...2 (not counting the other countries that took part that day) stadiums, 1 day. Farm Aid also happened the same year, and surprisingly they still do concerts. Neil Young's acoustic Bridge benefit concerts (which should be released on DVD, lots of amazing performances) also stemmed from Live Aid.     The centerpiece is the concert, but the beginning, end and the footage shown throughout the concert puts the event into perspective. The BBC footage at the beginning is truly disturbing, enough for Bob Geldof to try to do something about it (and continues to).     The documentary at the end of the DVD was okay, but they should've made a new one talking about what had happened in years since,esp. in the early 90s. \\"We Are The World\\" and \\"Do They Know It's Christmas\\" videos are also included.     As some of you have been reading, there are missing pieces, the most notable being the \\"Led Zeppelin\\" reunion with Phil Collins on drums. I think they should've included it just because it was a highlight of the concert but it's not really a big deal (you'll hear why they never did \\"Stairway\\" after Bonham died). It was neither Plant or Page's best moment. Yet the Black Sabbath footage made it (not Ozzy's finest moment)... go figure that one out...     No, you're not getting the complete, beginning to end concert. You're also not getting MTV VJs every 2 seconds showing their reactions. But in comparison to \\"Woodstock\\" where far more performances were cut out, this is still a healthy amount of material that you're getting for half the price of the Monterey DVD box set.     The sound is great in surround, mostly used for ambience than separating the instruments the video footage pretty good, although it would get lines across the screen from time to time (something they've improved on since). The rockers from the 60s were still somewhat young, and bands like U2 proving themselves with a billion people watching, Queen proving their mettle as one of the best live acts in rock, and the array of artists (and celebs that would be introducing the acts) that ARE on there is still staggering. Even Brian Wilson made it out to play with the Beach Boys... the only disappointing thing were that the Stones had more or less splintered by that time, Mick opted to duet with Tina, and Keith and Ron Wood opted to back up Bob Dylan. And for some reason, Bruce Springsteen (who was the biggest live act of that year) decided not to take part in the show.     To me, this encapsulates the 80s as much as any of John Hughes' movies have, if not more so (and you'll hear \\"Don't You Forget About Me\\" on the DVD). It's awesome..totally awesome!
B00009L1OB|5.0|This is the album that made me a fan for life. Engaging, mystical, and textured, this album goes between extreme pop (Reflex) and the darker side of the New Romantic movement(Shadows on Your Side, Seventh Stranger). Everything about it screams 80's - the sound, the look, and especially the videos. The singles are all classics, loved by millions. My favorite was always New Moon on Monday.
B00004T9UF|5.0|This is Eminem's 2nd major release and also his best release to date.  This album is in the Guiness Book of World Records for being the fasting selling rap album of all time.  It sold 1.76 million copies in only its 1st week.  This album has good production mostly coming from Dr. Dre.  The lyrics are very good and controversial.  This album was actually protested against because of some of the content it had in it.  The best songs are \\"The Way I Am\\" \\"Stan\\" and \\"Criminal.\\"  I would definitely suggest this album to all rap fans.<br /><br />PSA 2000 (Intro) - funny intro<br /><br />Kill You - good chorus, good lyrics 5/5<br /><br />Stan - this is one of the best on the album 5/5<br /><br />Paul (Skit)<br /><br />Who Knew - decent lyrics, good chorus 4/5<br /><br />Steve Berman (Skit)<br /><br />The Way I Am - song to his critics, BEST SONG!! 10/5<br /><br />The Real Slim Shady - catchy chorus, good verses 5/5<br /><br />Remember Me? - awesome eminem verse, decent chorus 4/5<br /><br />I'm Back - boring chorus, awesome verses 5/5<br /><br />Marshall Mathers - awesome chorus and lyrics 5/5<br /><br />Ken Kaniff (Skit)<br /><br />Drug Ballad - decent chorus, good lyrics 4/5<br /><br />Amityville - nice 3rd verse by Em, good chorus 5/5<br /><br />Bitch Please II - nice guest appearances, good chorus 5/5<br /><br />Kim - song lyrically attacking his wife Kim 5/5<br /><br />Under The Influence - good chorus, good verses by Em and D12 5/5<br /><br />Criminal - one of the best songs, good verses and chorus 5/5
B000268QB2|5.0|Ok so for the longest time, I avoided this like the plague.  First I misassumed it was some hip-hop group, and then began to understand it sounded like Coldplay.  So I continued to avoid it. <br /> <br />And then I heard it. <br /> <br />Now Im assuming that everyone who's heard about the comparison without hearing the music has probably decided to avoid this album as well.  Do yourself a favor and get it. <br /> <br />It's the best album I've gotten in about a year.  The vocals are amazing, the music is beautiful, energetic, and emotional.  I could list every track on here as the best track, and you know what?  I wouldn't be wrong. <br /> <br />'Somewhere Only We Know\\" is, of course, their big single.  It blows my mind every time I hear it.  \\"She Has No Time\\" is a beautiful, remorseful ballad of a slow song which grips my heart every time I listen to the singer croon.  \\"bend and Break\\" is exciting, singable, and wonderful to listen to. <br /> <br />Simply put, this is quite possibly the most underrated album I've seen in a while, and one of the best purchases you can make this year.
B0000CDL93|1.0|Okay, the film is very entertaining.  There, I've said it.  Now on to the serious stuff.  Some people think that even if you don't believe the conspiracy theories about the JFK assassination, it is worth seeing this film because \\"it makes you think\\".  The tragedy of this view is that it destroys people's belief that there is something like \\"the Truth\\" and encourages mental laziness by not pushing people to look at the evidence, and the evidence clearly shows that the Warren Commissions conclusions about the roles of Oswald and Ruby are correct.  Many former \\"conspiracy buffs\\" like Norman Mailer and Gus Russo did this and admitted they had been wrong. <br />Oliver Stone's disregard of the truth is appalling.  First off, JFK and RFK were no \\"liberal saints\\" that were out to overturn a \\"corrupt establishment\\".  JFK was the best friend the \\"military/industrial complex\\" ever had.  He poured huge amounts of money into it by carrying out the biggest peacetime military build-up in history and by giving the go-ahead for the Apollo program to put a man on the Moon by 1970.  JFK moved very cautiously on civil rights and appointed segregations judges to the Federal Courts.  After the Bay of Pigs, he felt the CIA should be more tightly controlled and so he put in brother, Attorney General Robert Kennedy as unofficial overseer of the organization, taking a VERY active role in Operation Mongoose which was to remove Castro from power in Cuba, by assassination if necessary.  Kennedy was making contradictory statements about Vietnam, but there was no real indication he had a concrete plan to pull out, and it must be remembered that President Eisenhower also decided in 1954 not to get involved in helping the French there, thus allowing a Communist takeover of North Vietnam and yet the CIA and the Establishment didn't decide to rub him out. We see that JFK and RFK were no threat to the \\"establishment\\" and even if he was, they could have easily gotten rid of them by leaking informationabout JFKs poor health or  his scandalous womanizing involving women who had Mafia or East German connections, all of which FBI Director J Edgar Hoover and many others including journalists knew about but handled discreetely, so there was no need to come up with the ridiculous assassination scheme Stone invents in this film. <br />In the ridiculous trial of Clay Shaw (who was acquitted by the jury after only a few minutes deliberation-showing how effective a prosecutor that charlatan Jim Garrison was) Garrison quickly points out that there were \\"several teams of shooters\\" in Dealey Plaza.  Where is there any shred of evidence of this?  Yet, this is presented as fact.  This is symptomatic of everything that is wrong with this genre of film.  It is unfortunate that this anti-intellectualism and cynicism is spreading throughout modern society leading to things like Holocaust denial, racism, support for international terrorism and the like.  I hope everyone takes note of this and steers clear of this film and its ilk.
B00005JNBQ|4.0|This has to be one of the strangest movies I have ever seen!  The movie's plot is kind of \\"zig-zag,\\" but I WAS able to empathize with the lead character, who has trouble fitting into a world not accepting of individual differences.  One is re-aquainted with how judgemental and cruel high school can be especially for someone who is \\"different.\\"   <br /> <br />I was pleased that my son, who is in the late elementary grades, enjoyed this film.  I hope he learned something about the importance of tolerance and the value of a friend.  <br /> <br />
B0002Z1EG2|4.0|Haven't bought the DVD yet, But I will Do.  I think most of Shania's material is strong & easy to  Listen to. I'm disappointed \\"When you kiss me\\" is missing.  That song & video say something. I wouldn't mind Having her  2002 Superbowl performance on the DVD/ video (Man,I Feel like  a woman/ Up medley). I used to have them on a Tape of the  Game - sensational (as always).
B0002F6BRE|5.0|Very funny, with a hilarious role from Bob Newhart as Elf's father.  Will Farrell is great in this feel good comedy, good for the whole family.  My nine year old son was rolling in the aisles.
B000669GAI|5.0|When I first heard that Pearl Jam decided to leave Epic records after their Riot Act album (their most recent studio album, released in 2002), I knew Epic would squeeze them by putting together a greatest hits album.  To be totally honest I was not anticipating this release.  I am an avid Pearl Jam fan and own every studio album plus 6 live performances and all 4 dvd's.  I was further hesitant a few weeks ago when I saw the track listings.  And to be sure, there were several omissions on this greatest hits.  \\"Oceans\\" and \\"Red Mosquito\\" in particular.  But being the dedicated fan that I am, I went out on the release day and bought the album.  I must say that I was impressed.  The re-mixes of the old grunge-era songs are fantastic.  \\"Even Flow\\" in particular has a whole new feel to it.  And dedicated fans should rest assured because long time and current PJ producer Brendan O'Brien did the mixing himself.  The first side features more hard rock while the second side is the softer PJ.  It would be nice if this record could work to re-familiarize the band to middle America.  Fans on the East and West coasts know how great Pearl Jam still is, but the middle portion of the country seems to have forgotten that the band is perhaps as good today as they've ever been--both instrumentally and creatively.  This is an absolute must have for any fan of rock music.  And fans shouldn't have to wait long, Pearl Jam is rumored to be headed back to the studio before the new year.
0671027344|2.0|The book The Perks of being a Wallflower is a book in my opinion is not a good book. I did not think that it related to me at all. It was about a boy in high school that writes letters to a friend that does not exist. He does this because he has alot of things going through his mind. He has to deal with the everyday problems that a teenager has. If I were him I would talk to a doctor or something because boys are not sopose to have diary's.I don't really recommend this book bcause i did not like it.
0345409671|5.0|Great it really made me question what I was tought at church what Anne said in this book really made me stop and think esp. since my chrch has a passion for changing there stories from the bible every few years I no longer go there and part of the reason was they wanted me to stop reading these kind of books starting they was of the devil just because it had the name of the devil in it Now I am not saying all the religion is like this but for people like me who live in the Northern Tip of the bible belt we know how it is but back to the book try the book Memnoch's story is great this is one of her best works IMO I am support Anne 100% is what ever she does and I will continue to as well try it out and for all you haters try reading the book with your MIND not your EYES think about it
B0002Z9HT8|4.0|First of all, I want to say that despite the criticism of some, this is still a great DVD. <br /> <br />So, I'll make a comment about this DVD on the good, the bad, and the ugly. <br /> <br />THE GOOD <br />The audio and video quality in this video is great, despite of being broadcasted at a time when Dolby Surround, and HD sound didn't exist. <br />Queen was without a doubt the band that stole the show, and I'm going to have to agree with everyone who said that they're performance alone is worth the DVD. U2, was perhaps the second best but unlike them, Queen made the best out of their 20 minutes of performance. <br /> <br />THE BAD <br />Although Led Zeppelin didn't allow their performance to be included on the DVD release, the big majority of the rest of the artists had no problem with it. Yet still most of their performances have been cut, leaving nearly 2 or 3 songs cut out of each artist set. <br /> <br />THE UGLY <br />As I mentioned before, the most dissapointed of all will probably be the Led Zeppelin fans. From what I've heard Robert Plant and Jimmy Page were so dissapointed with their performance that they told Bob Geldof that they'd rather give a big contribution to the cause than including their set on the DVD release. <br /> <br />------------------------------------------------------------- <br /> <br />It's still worth to buy it for the cause. We shouldn't ignore the fact that famine, disease, and absolute poverty are very important issues in Africa, as well as many other countries around the world. <br /> <br />Please don't forget that LiveAid brought some relief despite the humongous effort put by Bob Geldof, the artists, and all the people involved with the cause. Politicians, millionaires, and people on the highest levels of power have showed too much lack of concern for issues like this. It's up to each one of us to somehow make a difference.
0783226845|5.0|This movie is amazing.  It makes you laugh, makes you cry, and it makes you want to stand up and cheer.  Al Pacino plays one of his best roles ever in playing the Colonel.  The message of acceptance and belonging are shouted from the rooftops in this film.  It shows you how people in different places in their life are still essentially making the same choices.  If you liked Dead Poets Society or Finding Forrester you will love this film.
B000002JKA|2.0|As soon as this album was published I bought it, hoping that it could represent something better and an improvement compared to the first two works:on the contrary, it turned out to me disappointing and boring and so I decided to give up DT.  <br /> <br />Why? I find them self-centred, boring and only hard minded on technic rather than on balanced and better structured songs. When I listen to them (and believe me, I really do it again) I loose myself in guitar and Keyboards solos which are leading to nowhere, just a show of (good?) playing, but no heart and soul.  <br />I mean, the first album reflects the beginning of the band and it's surely not a masterpiece, but I find it more involving, rough and direct, more \\"sincere\\" and \\"spontaneous\\". I really like it and the vocalist was well above the present one. <br />The second release started the new DT and here come the problems. More complicated songs, too complicated; guitar and keyboards heading for nowhere, without a logic and a  direction. There's only good technic but useless, not serving a more articulated project. <br /> <br />And the live show reflect all that:I saw DT live once and I've to admit that I wasn't satisfied at all. They made on stage the same boring show performed in studio. <br /> <br />If I look at the success that DT have achieved all over the world and the huge impact they have had on music and new bands, I might think that I'm wrong or at least a too sever judge. But I've no remorse and no turning back: my judgment still remains .Unfortunately, the world of heavy music is overcrowded with DT-like bands and soloists that are nearly only copying (or trying to do it) the rhymthics and the melodies of DT. We don't need only good technician, but above all more phantasy, more committment, more innovation. <br /> <br />
0440416027|4.0|Young Michael has moved into a new fixer-upper house with his family and \\"stupid\\" ailing baby sister. Get wrapped up in the discovery he's found in the crumbling garage and let your pallet salivate for 27 and 53, \\"Food of the Gods.\\"<br /><br />I can't believe this is juvenile literature! Skellig is a wonderous novel with adventurous, smart, compassionate, and funny characters. The only qualification I can think of for being juvenile literature is that one whole chapter is two or maybe five pages long, that makes for more than a forty chapter book! Brag to your teachers :)<br /><br />I recommend this good read for anyone older than 6 years old because it can be quite scary.
B00003CX9E|1.0|This movie was trash. The writing was a joke, the acting was pathetic, and the cinematography was amateur.  <br /> <br />Cops and Robbersons is a much more complete film and arguably the best movie in American history. Don't waste your time on Citizen Lame. Rent Cops and Robbersons and see what true cinematography is about.
B00065JTBA|5.0|JBJ himself has repeatedly claimed he wouldn't make a good A&R man, as \\"Livin' on a Prayer\\" almost didn't make Slippery. But 9 times out of 10, his conservative \\"playing it safe\\" attitude HAS backfired when it has come to picking the tracks for the official albums. A prime example is the pair of tracks \\"Bitter Wine\\" and \\"All I Want Is Everything\\" that didn't make the U.S. release of \\"These Days\\", but yet were arguably the best songs from those sessions!!!   <br /> <br />Just dive into this box and discover the REAL Bon Jovi. I've always considered myself one of their greatest fans, long before the idea of rummaging through the song vault was in the works. So don't get me wrong, almost all of their album material IS strong. But the band has long been too preoccupied with generating a \\"hit,\\" and finally, for those of us who knew they had it in them all along, their true talents shine through like never before. Better musicianship. More emotion.  Less formulaec (usually, as \\"The Radio Saved My Life Tonight\\" is another example of Richie's continued struggle with underplaying). For anyone who has ever \\"lost\\" the faith with this band, it has been a long time, but do them a favor and give them another shot - raise your glass to the core talents of each member and celebrate, throughout this multi-disc masterpiece, the release that we always knew they had in them.  Good quality rock music. Amen.
B0002XDODU|4.0|Well I was happy to see the Rammstein finally decided to get off their collective butts and give us fans another helping of German Industrial Metal. Well after a long wait it has arrived and I like it!!. It's typical Rammstein, but it also ventures a wee bit here and there off the usual track. It's heavy and melodic, just the way I like it. The vocals are in German off course and this lends itself perfectly to this sound. The vibe that those vocals add as well as the guitar riffage, just seem to fit the songs so well is scary! Rammstein may not be the most talented musicians in the world, but they have a knack of writing good tunes that stick in your craw and get your head a bopping. They have certainly found a formula that works for them and for that I say thank you!<br /><br />Overall I'm very pleased with it. It's still not as good as my favourite, Mutter!!, but it's pretty darn good and well worth the $$$ to pick it up.
B00030590I|5.0|i loved this movie.  I'm sure everyone's already raved about the cinematography and beautiful scenes and colors etc.  I agree with them. <br /> <br />But I also personally liked it because I identified with the culture somewhat.  I hate those kitchy movies involving \\"the Orient\\" from a Western perspective that make it all look stupid and stereotypical and all about yelling martial arts people who don't speak good English.  You know, like Shanghai Knights or whatever.  That type of movie annoys me a lot, because it has no empathy, and makes Chinese culture look like a superficial exotified stereotype from a Western context.  But this movie was wonderful in the dignity of the characters, because the story about the Chinese characters was made from a Chinese perspective and context, and therefore knew what it was talking about, and therefore also had depth and true empathy.  That made it beautiful.  Like...Jet Li in Hero vs. Jet Li in Unleashed.  In Hero, he is in his own language/element and you really see the true magnitude of his ability and dignity and character.  In an American movie like Unleashed (based on the trailer), he's an ANIMAL for crying out loud, and you just notice his broken English and just his typical martial arts fighting skills, and he's just a novelty to be toyed with.  See the difference? <br /> <br />So in short, I loved Hero because it seemed more genuine and had true dignity and gravity and was just beautiful overall, and though it had awesome fights in it, it wasn't ONLY about the fight scenes.  I felt like I really identified with and understood the types of dialogues that happened in the movie.  Very genuine and beautiful in all senses of the word. <br /> <br />I guess this review was sort of irrelevant to most people, but I just had to get that out :)
B000667GFK|4.0|I've always loved Luis Miguel and have had his Segundo Romance in my cd player for 7 years, BUT, this cd would not have been possible without the incredible arrangements and back up of Mariachi Vargas de Tecalitlan.  They have been in the business for over 100 years and are considered the best mariachi in the world.  So what's my gripe?  They are not recognized on this album anywhere.  Where are their album credit(s)??  In the inside back cover is a tiny mention of them (and I mean tiny - you can't read it without a magnifying glass).<br /><br />I would have expected more class from Luis and WEA.<br /><br />But, don't let it stop you from buying the cd.  Vargas rocks and they take Luis Miguel along for the ride.
B00068IOWM|5.0|Worst to date? A disappointment? I am not sure which album you heard, but this one is solid. It has that distinctive u2 sound. I am a hardcore fan since 1983 and have been mildly surprised/disappointed with some of their past releases, but even those have grown on me. On my initial listen (on vh1 website), I knew immediately it was good. Vertigo: a typical flashy u2 single, a bit like elevation from the last one 7/10. Miracle drug is a classic, thats all I will say about it 10/10. Sometimes you cant make it on your own: is an emotional and personal song 9/10. Love peace or else departs from their typical sound to more of a nine inch nails meets black rebel motorcycle club with Bono on vocals- this one will prob take a few more listens for me to really like, and I'll skip rating it. City of blinding lights: classic u2 hooks and piano work 10/10. All because of you: another awesome tune with edge taking over with his trademark repeating and reverb guitar and sounding alot like he did on Boy 10/10. Man and a woman: another departure from their normal sound on this slow r+b/ 'knockin boots song 6/10. Crumbs from your table: BIG surprise, very very cool song with Edge's guitar chiming and wailing like a siren...I like it 10/10. One step closer: long and slow song, very atmospheric. Im sure it will grow on me 6/10. Original of the species: I agree with the other posts on it sounding like the Beatles. Its a pretty good song but sounds over-produced. Yaweah: another classic sounding U2 song. Very uplifting chorus 9/10. <br /> <br />  As with any U2 album, the sum does not equal the total of its parts. As a whole this is a great album, and I am confident that most U2 fans will agree. My only gripe is that the foreign releases get the extra track. What gives? U2 will get more of my money for this cd, and even more of it when they go on tour. <br />
B00068IOWM|3.0|You know, its funny that there are 17 reviews of this album and IT HAS NOT EVEN BEEN RELEACED YET. So many people either saying \\"this is U2's masterpiece!\\" or \\"This album sucks, U2 is dead\\" that its starting to make me sick. Is U2 so huge that people have to comment on them even before they can leagaly listen to their work?  Everywone seems to be obsessed with U2, either obsessed with loving them or obsessed with hating them. Give the Ireland boy's a break.
B0000E1WKE|5.0|When you buy this CD, keep in mind that the tracks on this are not that of the \\"Bodyguard\\" .....very polished and suited to an image, etc.      Whitney Houston can clearly STILL SING HER [...] OFF!!  Overall, i am happy with this CD cuz it gives me perspective on Christmas music that I am sure I have never had b4. Best tracks:    'O Come Emmanuel' - a polished track with Whitney singing in fine voice!!    'Joy To the World/Silent Night' - not as polished BUT with a great arrangement   'I'll be Home For Christmas' - GOSPEL infused and an overall great take on a Christmas song that I've never liked.  I always go to this track and play it first!    'Little Drummer Boy' - Little Kris sings...and its cute!  then mommy changes the arrangement and takes it to another level.  inever expected \\"the Little Drummer Boy\\" to sound like that!!!    Overall, the only traditionally (sung)tune on here is 'O Holy Night' where Whitney is in fine voice. If you like Christmas and its music (gospel/r & b style)  BUY IT NOW!    This is definetly the CD for you.  When listening, you can feel Whitney's musical soul on every track.  Most of the songs were probably 'first takes' cuz you can hear her strained vocals on some tracks but Whitney is a good at what she does so they don't matter. SHE'S HUMAN!!   Good product with great tracks!!!!!     If you want a more tradtional sound for your Christmas, DON'T HATE.........here are a few other options:     Dionne Warwick's \\"My Favorite Time of the Year\\" (2004)     or     Dianne Reeves' Christmas CD    or     Ella Fitzgerald
076790592X|5.0|It was one of those books you just can't put down till your done and even though you know the outcome you can't help but get a little teary eyed when you finish. tuesdays with Morrie is a great book that not only teaches you about life but introduces you to a sweet old man that you wish you could have met. I recommend this book for anyone who is looking for a better perspective on life.
B00000K0DU|2.0|the acting was awful. the gore scenes are lame & the editing is bad. but i could get passed all of that because the plot was pretty good. however, the whole duck thing lost me. any good qualitys this film may have had was ruined by the duck angle. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B0002Z9HT8|5.0|It's true, the much-lamented Led Zep set is not included for scurrilous reasons (so what if they didn't play that well...neither did some other acts, and frankly, I'll take Zep out of tune before some of the acts that performed perfectly!).  I distinctly remember watching the concert, and I recall the Hooters opening the Philadelphia portion.  Maybe they were not an official act, just a hometown act to get the crowd going?  Anyway, I miss \\"All You Zombies\\".  Poor song title given the occasion, but I miss it none the less.  Despite my kvetching, FIVE STARS...twice!
B00003CXCT|5.0|I am a Star Wars fan and will always be, so there was no question: I simply HAD to have this DVD set. Like many other fans, I can watch those 3 movies and can pick out just about every \\"special edition\\" change that George Lucas made and know how it was like before (and yes, I have an old set of the VHS tapes too). Though I didn't agree with some of the changes, I do like many of them (I chuckle when I see that herd of Banthas in ROTJ) and it is just a wonder to see these films on DVD, with the amazing sound and updated special effects.  <br />I know many people felt betrayed by the changes, but in the end, Star Wars belongs to George Lucas and if these new versions are closer to he wanted to achieve, but couldn't because technology hadn't caught up with his vision, then I guess I'll have to accept that these are the versions that we are meant to see at this point in time. Besides, we've had nearly 7 years to absorb some of these changes, so I guess if one is grieving the old movies, I am now in the acceptance stage. <br />The bonus material DVD is an absolute treat! It made it even more worthwhile to buy the set. (I have to admit that I've watched the Episode III material several times already....) <br />The audio commentary is a bit dry sometimes (A couple of the speakers, including Lucas, are a bit too monotonous and drag on a bit). Carrie Fisher is easily the best of the group. Ben Burtt offers some fascinating little nuggets too, but I think I would have loved to have heard Carrie Fisher commenting, all by herself, throughout all 3 movies. <br />
B00005YUPO|3.0|Baby Beethoven was the best, so I didn't hesitate to buy Baby Bach.  A little disappointing compared to the first.  What most annoyed me was the forced spotlight on the two Clark girls.  Didn't add anything to the video and was a little too \\"aren't Julie's girls cute\\" for my taste.
B000669GAI|5.0|I would have to say that pearl jam will go down as one of the best bands ever.  Many people my not think so, but you have to look and see what this band has done.  1.They are the only grunge rock band to still be around,  2. They most certainly love the music and their fans, 3.  They always put on a great show(they play alot of songs so your pretty much going to here a song you like or love), and 4.  They be themsevles which is the most important part of music.  If you are a true pearl jam fan you would agree with me.  But, theres one thing I want to know, why doesnt this band play leash anymore its such a great song.
0062502182|5.0|If you have dreams and goals you like to accomplish this is a must read. It is very inspiring for both young and old alike. Paulo Coelho does a great job in making his readers wonder about their own personal dreams. In this book a shepherd boy named Santiago has a dream, a dream that he was destined to find a \\"treasure\\". On this long journey the boy is taking to The Great Pyramids of Egypt. Along the way he meets a bunch of very fascinating people. Some of which are little shop owners, a king, and a gypsy. All of these people and more help him understand that there is more to life than what he knows and that he should follow his dreams. Even though this book is very easily read the moral or theme is very motivating. It tells you that you shouldn't give up on your dreams and to pursue them.
0802130208|3.0|I've heard so many things about how funny this book is, and I've even witnessed a person reading the novel burst out into laughter, but I've never been able to experience the same phenomena. <br /> <br />In my opinion there are only a few funny parts of this novel.  This is most likely do to my very crude sense of humor.  The parts, byt the way, include: when ignatius masturbates to the thought of his olg dog, \\"The crusade for moorish dignity,\\" and that is it. <br /> <br />Throughtout the novel people may laugh at the rediculousness of Ignatius.  Whether its his political ideas or just way of going about things I dont find it funny.  His whole \\"valve\\" situation is just stupid in my opinion.  When he complains of his injuries (in the Levy pants office, etc.), which he heavily exaggerates, I didnt laugh one bit.  A person may even laugh at how he undercuts his own beliefs multiple times (he wants the world to progress, but wants a monarchy), but I did not. <br /> <br />To be honest, these sections don't amuse me one bit.  I can probably attribute to my hatred of Ignatius, probably stemming from the way he treats his mother.  Furthermore, when people laugh at the rediculousness of his ideas (his book, political party, revolt), I just hate him even more for believing in such stupid concepts.  The way that Ignatius thinks he is always right continually infuriates me, and I just can't laugh at this book.  I always finding myself wishing bad things onto ignatius, and when he is fired from his jobs or mugged, I feel happy. <br /> <br />Anyway, If you tend allow hatred of characters to affect the way you view their comedy, you probably shouldn't read this book, but if you can hold off the hatred to laugh at their mistakes, you'll love this book.  Personally I didn't like it, but I can see how some people with different types of humor and judgement would.
B00065JTBA|4.0|Great to see this finally released.  Glad to see all the rare gems & soundtrack smashes (\\"Edge of a broken heart\\", \\"Real Life\\", & \\"Good guys...\\") all in one DELUXE package!!!! I would have given this 5 stars but where is \\"Does anybody really fall in love anymore\\"??? Was I the only one expecting this to be included??????
B0000797IO|3.0|Jennifer Aniston does a nice job inhabiting a bored woman who feels her life needs a desperate shake-up to keep her from going insane.  The movie itself doesn't have anything brand new to say about such a situation, but it unspools the usual observations we're used to hearing about situations like this- mainly that an exciting, quick fix might not be the great remedy it initially appears to be- with subtlety and knowing humor.  The DVD includes both a widescreen and fullscreen version of the film, plus a nice variety of extras.
B0001IN07Q|5.0|Every once and a while a singer comes along whose voice sounds more experienced than his years such is the case for Michael Buble' add to that his boyish good looks and your in trouble. To use a phrase that is often reserved for Barbara Striesand, his voice is like butter.  To say he sounds like Sinatra is not doing him justice, he excells Sinatra in my book. There are songs you associate with singers but Michael overwites that association.  Take Peggy Lee's standard Fever, Michael did and knocked it for a loop as far as I am concerned the song is his from now on.  Jim Morrison's Moondace has been recorded by other Jazz and pop singers like Sting.  Michael takes the song and makes it his.  I fault the CD in the set for leaving some of the best off and the sound goes to pot halfway through the Roger's and Hart song My Funny Valentine and for the rest of the CD it is at best bearable.  On the DVD that comes with the set you see why the sound goes to pot the microphone is halfway down in from of him. He does a good job on Mack the Knife on the CD and DVD but that song is safely Bobby Darrin's.  He is not as emotional as George Michael is on his song Kissing a Fool but they are great.  Sway makes you want to get up and do a Mombo.  He is a great entertainer, a master showman.  If your a rocker, you will not like Michael, if your tastes run along jazz lines you'll love Michael.  The only thing that bothers me is that I am going to have to by his Enhanced CD to get the rest of the songs that should have been on this one.
B0002XDODU|5.0|Rammstein is probably the only band I can think of that if I didn't have a CD of theirs and I found it in a store, I'd get it on the spot.  I'm not a huge fan, I just really like their sound.  \\"Reise Reise\\" is a bit different from \\"Mutter\\", and actually I think I prefer \\"Mutter,\\" this CD seems to rock out a bit more, and I prefer the more musical sounds of \\"Mutter.\\"  However, Rammstein doens't fail to deliever by any means.  My favorites would probably be \\"Reise Reise,\\" \\"Amerika,\\" \\"Moskau,\\" \\"Ohne Dich,\\" and the haunting \\"Amour.\\"  Rammstein seems to have changed their style a bit from \\"Herzeleid,\\" and \\"Sehnsucht,\\" which are both good, but these new sounds are pretty neat too. <br /> <br />Anyways, my two cents
B0002OERI0|5.0|this album is a new route for greenday,the boys had grown up and this album is just amazing the whole thing is just awesome,if you had never been a big greenday fan you will become one,i see gramy ,i see best alternative album of the year
B00005JMUA|5.0|I won't bother reviewing \\"Kill Bill Voume 1\\" because Quentin Tarentino (\\"Reservoir Dogs,\\" \\"Pulp Fiction\\" and \\"Jackie Brown\\") originally intended this to be one big movie. Therefore, I will rate it as a whole. The action scenes were well-choreographed and the dialogue, said to be Tarentino's strongest point, is snappy. Lucy Liu (\\"Charlie's Angels,\\" \\"Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle\\", etc), Vivica A. Fox (\\"Independence Day,\\" \\"Two Can Play That Game), Daryl Hannah (\\"A Walk To Remember,\\" \\"Silver City\\", etc), Michael Madsen and David Carradine play the DiVAS (Deadly Viper Assassination Squad) of whom The Bride (aka Black Mamba) (Uma Thurman, in a knockout role) was once queen bee and whom Bill (Carradine, scary as hell) has ordered to be executed at her wedding...really. She wakes up four years later, plotting bloody revenge...and she gets it: \\"A roaring rampage of revenge. I roared, I rampaged and I got bloody satisfaction.\\" This movie is one of the best films that feature chicks kicking a-- and a whole lot of action. Special features include a performance by the 5, 6, 7, 8's (who appear in the film), a deleted scene (without Tarantino's commentary, for some reason) and more. The DTS 5.1 Surround Sound lets you get the full impact of this martial-arts homage. The mix of blaxploitation tracks (which includes a track from \\"Zamfir: Master Of The Pan Flute\\") and Robert Rodriguez' (the \\"SPY KIDS\\" movies) own score is awesome. Rated PG-13 for bloody violence, language and brief drug use.
B0002Z9HT8|3.0|One of the most memorable events of my lifetime as I was an awestruck 16 year old keeping one eye on the moving company as they were packing up my family's belongings to move in the following days.....  \\"I said you can pack whatever you want but don't even think about touching the TV..... \\"...... Anyway, it is awesome this long awaited EVENT is finally out on DVD but I have to admit great disappointment over the omission of several acts completely (Rick Springfield,  Power Station, The Hooters, ( & key songs/ performances by Madonna (\\"Love makes the world go round\\", The Cars (\\"You might think\\" & \\"Drive\\", and last but not least considering it was the #1 single on BILLBOARD that week DURAN DURAN's \\"A View To A Kill' .......  If anyone knows the real reason Rick Springfield and/or The Power Station was not included, please feel free to post...... Let's just hope that one day, a more comprehensive version of July 13, 1985 will be released with or without Led Zepplein.........
B00005JMCN|5.0|Seabiscuit is an excellent movie for all ages. <br /> <br />At first, I had my misgivings. Just another sappy, shallow, feel good story was what I thought that this was going to be. However, I was fortunate to at least have an open mind and watch. <br /> <br />The acting is superb; even Tobey Maguire of Spider-Man fame was credible in his portrayal of the jockey, Red Pollard. Intermittently, the narration of the events surrounding Seabiscuit, the horse, and the popularity of horse racing during the 1930's was eloquently delivered by David McCullough, whose voice added flair to the historical accounts in Ken Burns' higly acclaimed documentary, The Civil War. <br /> <br />Speaking of Ken Burns, had he completed a project that focused on Americam life during The Great Depression, then Seabiscuit might have been regarded as one of the excerpted docudramas but with the added detail and close examination necessary for a great drama in its own right. <br /> <br />Though it did not receive an Academy Award for Best Picture of 2003, which went to the immortal classic, The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King, Seabiscuit, nevertheless, could pull in the reins to hold its own and come out as a Triple Crown of a theatrical release.
0446310786|5.0|This superb book contains several moral lessons and subtly points out faults that many of us share. Most importantly, we must follow our conscience and do what we know is right no matter the possible cost. That takes a great deal of courage and most of us have at one time or another failed in this respect. Harper Lee's Atticus Finch on the other hand was more than up to the task even though most of the town and his family were against him. Lee makes no effort to hide the fact that often there will be consequences for those who take a stand and those consequences will not always be pleasant.<br /><br />Atticus Finch is not the main character of this story however. The main characters are Atticus' son Jem and his daughter Scout who tells the story. I advise that you forget looking for the moral implications of the story for they are evident and it is much easier to enjoy this book if you just read it and don't try to dissect it.  Jem (Jeremy) and Scout (Jean Louise) are probably the most interesting literary children since Tom and Huck and some of their adventures will remind the reader of Twain's creations. In short, this book is just plain fun to read and I regret terribly having waited so long to read it!<br /><br />During most of the story the children's adventures tend to revolve around the Radley house and it's most sinister occupant, Boo (Arthur) Radley. Boo is a recluse that hasn't been spotted out of his house by a reliable source in many years and of course the rumor mill in a small town has turned him into a monster that eats raw squirrels. In the end, the Boo Radley story line presents the reader with yet another moral lesson but the trail that leads to this lesson takes many interesting twists and turns.<br /><br />One will also find a very good description of the twentieth century South in Lee's work. From sleeping on the porch in the Summertime to watching the old men loaf around the courthouse I can honestly say I have been there and done that. Class distinction has always been very important in the South and Harper Lee works hard to bring that distinction out. Thankfully African-Americans are currently judged on their merit and not their race so that they fall into the caste system all up and down the ladder. In the 1930s though things were much different. The three lowest rungs on the ladder were poor white trash (the Cunninghams) and low down white trash (the Ewells), with blacks at the bottom. The significance of this being that at that point in time even the lowest whites would be believed over any African-American.<br /><br />Atticus Finch was for his time and place a fairly odd bird and thank God that there really were Finches out there to look out for the mockingbirds of the world.Class distinction has always been very important in the South and Harper Lee works hard to bring that distinction out.

068987474X|4.0|Let's face it... you don't read a book like this, or pick it up, if you don't already know that something is wrong with your current/past relationships. The book is short, easy to read and understand, and speaks directly to us - women who give too much in relationships and do not get half of what we give in return. The 'letters' the authors use to illustrate their points are pretty phony, but the message is clear (he's not into you), and you will undoubtedly recognize yourself in many of the scenarios. The concept of 'he's just not that into you' isn't particularly unique, but it's empowering to read and, if only for a short time, remember your own worth. The book, co-authored by a male and female (although the male writer seems to be doing all of the talking/explaining) is cutesy as well - they have 'exercises' at the end of each chapter that are lighthearted and fun (for example, color a blank flag with a red crayon and keep a look out in the future for red flags). I particularly enjoyed the end.. the authors speak about 'what to do next.\\" Often, books will explain things to you and then leave you pondering over what to do with all the information. Not so here - the authors actually offer suggestions for the future and some advice to overcome unhealthy relationships. Another plus is that the book tackled issues that went beyond simple dating - they also talk about marriage and alcohol and how to make sense of these 'bigger' subjects. I would definitely recommend this book, not necessarily because it's well-written, but because it can particularly help someone who is just getting out a relationship (or someone who needs to). He's just not that into you is definitely something to keep in mind and I think I just might in the future thanks to this little book.
B00005JKEC|3.0|Denzel Washington is a terrific actor and I'm glad to see that he won a well-deserved Oscar for his performance.  Sadly, he is the only reason to watch this film.  I personally feel that he desrved the Academy's Oscar nods for more 'substantial' roles such as Malcom X or  Reuben 'Hurricane' Carter.  Instead, he won for playing a dark, menacing, corrupt (and ultimately just  plain evil) narcotics cop who takes a rookie under his wing, only to later betray and abandon him.  The ending (without giving anything away) is plain Hollywood derivative and disappointing.   <br />Although the setting is gritty and tense and there are some effective moments within the film, the overall package is disappointing.  Still, it is worth sitting through for Washington's outstanding performance.  Now I wish he would win another Oscar for playing someone more admirable (if Hollywood every has the guts to do a story on a great statesman or leader such as Frederick Douglass, Thurgood Marshall, or even Colin Powell, Denzel should be the first one they call on!).
B00005JNEI|1.0|I can't believe intelligent people actually pay for this propaganda.  Personally I really don't care to sit through 2 hours of Michael MooreON's one sided, uninformed, sarcastic comentary.
B00000IMYA|4.0|'Ellington At Newport' turned out to be the best-selling album of the Duke's career largely due to the exceptional performances of the soloists on the album. But Ellington's compositions always gave great scope for improvisation by his band and it's his own enthusiasm and momentum that spurred the band on to great things that night. <br /> <br />On 'Black & Tan Fantasy' Cat Anderson's solo is a throwback to the era in which it was composed, while Willie Cook on 'Tea For Two' swings unstoppable. Ellington himself puts in some spirited piano playing at the beginning of 'Take The A Train' and 'Diminuendo and Crescendo in Blue'. 'Festival Junction' is an inspired name for the opening part of the festival suite as it builds and builds in its thumping and sophisticated way, much like the rest of the concert. Then a slight respite with Russell Procopej's lilting clarinet on 'Blues To Be There', before back to the frenetic pace of the earlier part with 'Newport Up'. Here the notes and tempo seem to crash and burn against each other in a manner more reminscent of bepop than swing. <br /> <br />The there's the effortless, breezy solo of Harry Carney on 'Sophisticated Lady' and try as he might, poor Jimmy Grisham's vocal on 'Day In, Day Out' just doesn't match the power and sincerity of the backing instrumentation. <br /> <br />On Paul Gonsalves performance of his career, the rest of the band aren't slow in egging him on to greater and greater heights through enthusiastic shouts and claps. This appreciative support seems oddly lacking in the other soloists performances. After the riotous greeting of this number, Ellington seems to use Johnny Hodges laid-back playing on 'I Got It Bad' and 'Jeep's Blues' as a way of quietening the crowd. Ray Nance does slightly better than Grisham's earlier performance, with his satchmo-singing on 'Tulip or Turnip' before Sam Woodyard whips the crowd into a frenzy again with his remarkable drum soloing on 'Skin Deep'. <br /> <br />His riot control complete, Ellingtion slips away under the auspicies of 'Mood Indigo'.
B0001ZMWQO|4.0|wow<br /><br />i just bought this CD yesterday and since then fell in love with it. The songs are catchy, funky, and just plain fun. Heres how i rate the entire CD from 1-5:<br /><br />Jaqueline: 4.5- funky song, dont let the beggining fool you- its a great opener and really sets the mood for the rest of the album<br /><br />Tell her Tonight: 3.5- probably my least favorite on the CD.

Love the melody and riffs and changes- great single (and video!)<br /><br />The Dark of the Matinee: 5.0- This song has grown on me. I didn't first like it but now i do. It actually could easily be my favorite song next to Take Me Out. Nice changes and vocals.<br /><br />Auf Achse: 4.5- i like this one...alot. Its another one that grew on me. I like the lyrics and the vocals and the melody alot. It almost explodes from the softish verse to an intense chorus- i feel it<br /><br />Cheating on You: 4.0- its good. not my favorite but its good.

B00005QZ7U|5.0|This movie is like nothing I had ever seen, and pretty much single-handlely brought back the movie musical. Ewan McGregor is so great as Christian and noone could be better than Nicole Kidman as Satine. It's unbelievable the voices that Kidman and McGRegor have. The second disc is great with 15 easter eggs and so many features. Pick up this movie today!
B0002VL0KQ|5.0|This CD is indeed a miracle!  My 9 month old has refused to sleep by himself up until this CD.  No more screaming tantrums for 45 min!  He is asleep by the second song HAPPILY.  This CD is amazing also the lyrics are so true to a mothers feelings that it is hard not to tear up.  I am very pleased that my little one is sleeping alone and being sung to sleep by loving lyrics and a beautiful voice! (And this is the only Celine CD I own so you do not have to be a celine groupie to love this CD)
B00005V3Z4|1.0|I have to laugh at all of the simple people who are in awe of something that is so very insignificant.I obviously hated this movie,so of course all of the idiots who praise this garbage will say that I am close-minded (kind of ironic that all of these people who long for different points of view instantly bash the ones they don't agree with!)    Since so many are so very blind as to what this movie is,I'll go ahead and make it clear:Donnie Darko is just a total attack on religon esp. Christianity,right-wing politics and any form of morality that one might decide to uphold.All of this propoganda is coated with a science-fiction sub-plot of time travel,so as to not make it TOO apparent.    Oh yes,this movie is so very original!Make good people look evil  and evil people look good.Righteousness MUST be hypocrisy...  Gee Hollywood,you certainly haven't been beating that dead horse for the past 30 years.Wonder if you can ever create something new with YOUR closed mind?    And as far as this \\"extrodinary\\" storyline goes,let me just see if I get this straight.... God sends a man who was shot in a stupid looking bunny suit back in time to the man who shot him because he wanted him to kill himself instead of living life because death is better than living with a mental disorder...  I think you should lay off the funny leaves Beavis!    The dialouge in the movie also said that timetravel could be possibile if a large enough vessel was used that traveled faster than the speed of light AKA a spaceship.Uhm,an airplane can't travel faster than the speed of light;even when it's crashing into the earth.Yes,it wil travel very,very fast;but NOT fater than the speed of light.I wonder if the creator of this movie even understands how fast the speed of light is?    Anyway since the airplane crashing wouldn't travel faster than the speed of light,no wormhole would be created,and so that adorable little windbag Donnie Dorko could not travel back in time. Thus our story(or lack there of) is no more.Game over man!    All I know is that I wish I COULD GO BACK IN TIME to stop myself from watching this and do something else with the 3 hours of my life that I lost!!
B000669GAI|5.0|This is a very good album for even the true pearl jam fan like myself that already has everyone of these songs. Yes it would have been a little nicer if the band put a new song or two on the record but what can you say they just wanted the hits and only the hits. As with any greatest hits album nobody is happy as I wanted to see \\"Footsteps\\", \\"Brain of J.\\", and \\"Habit\\" on here as well, but with or without its still a good summary of this wonderful bands career. Hopefully there will be newer stuff to come.
B000003TA4|4.0|Nirvana's debut album is intriguing, to say the least. Because it is the first and one of the very few albums in history that stands alone in it's field and dominated a music generation. While yet remains the fault for today's garbage. Amd Nevermind was the gun that shot off this horrible world of dread and gloom in our society of music. <br /> <br />Nevermind is still a brilliant album filled with Kurt Cobain's teen angst and hard-life anthems (which was perfected by The Who and revamped in grunge form by Kurt). <br /> <br />I missed the Generation X boat by a year or two so I got the best of both worlds from Pete Townshend's anthems to Kurt Cobain's anthems and I still say thet Pete did them better with more passion for the project than Kurt. <br /> <br />But I loved Nirvana and Nevermind as it was on the edge of my generation's moment (whatever generation you'd call right there between the Boomers and Xer's). And I was sadened by Kurt's passing but Dave Grohl fixed that hole with Foo Fighters and all was forgotten when Staind, Nickelback and Linkin Park came to save the already dead day.
B0000E1WKE|4.0|I just previewed Whitney's latest Christmas project.<br /><br />In a few places Whitney sounds as if she needs a big glass of water after each phrase, it is so breathy!<br /><br />In many other instances here, we get flashes of her brilliance and long for our old Whitney to focus and get back to where she needs (and deserves) to be.<br /><br />Even at its worst, one simply cannot deny that this woman is just entirely too talented to end up in a drug-induced oblivion.<br /><br />Many times the hardest thing in the world is to allow our loved ones to do what they need to do in order to regain control.<br /><br />The biggest thing I am reminded of while listening to this is that once she gets past her current trials and tribulations, the music world better watch out becase she will be back better than ever.<br /><br />The highlight here was her wondrous interpetation of Deck the Halls/Silent Night.  You can tell she was feeling the power because this is a blistering performance which indicates that slowly but surely, Whitney will definitely be back.<br /><br />This is a surprisingly pleasing set for the most part with bigger implications of better days and projects  to come from Ms Houston.<br /><br />Personally, I can hardly wait!!!
B000001F3C|5.0|U2 is one of the few bands that can fall into so many different genres and radio formats. I have heard them on Top 40, Adult Alternative, Classic Rock, Retro, Hard Rock, and College Rock radio stations. These guys know what it takes to stay in the game, and also release rocking good albums. \\"War\\" took U2 from a punk college-rock staple and made them rock legends. <br /> <br />A lot more raw and hard than their more recent outputs, \\"War\\" is definitely an album packed with political messages. However, the messages are definitely not a weakness. Instead, they strengthen the music that these guys make. And it's some powerful stuff. \\"New Years Day\\" is a rocking number with a somber message, while \\"Sunday Bloody Sunday\\" sounds like a marching song, a marching song for peace. There are other great songs too like \\"40\\" which are worth checking out as well. <br /> <br />While this might not be as polished or in depth as \\"The Joshua Tree\\", \\"War\\" is a rocking album entangled with strong messages. It gave U2 the boost it needed to attack mainstream radio and establish themselves as one of the greatest rock bands of all time.
B00068IOWM|4.0|I like u2, but I was a little hesitant on ordering this album.  I didn't really get into their last one, but I loved their 90's experimentation with great cds like Achtung Baby, Zooropa, and Pop.  But I've heard this one and it's really good.  I think it kind of takes the flavors of all the different u2 styles over the years.  I love \\"City of Blinding Lights\\" and \\"Sometimes You Can't Make it On your Own\\" they should release them as singles.  I used to love \\"Vertigo\\" but I've played it way too much.  My favorite one by far though is \\"A Man and a Woman\\".  Ladies, you'll love it! It's like a u2 R&B song, kind of different but really great :) Good job lads <br /> <br />
B0002XH9Z4|5.0|Take a look at the man who captivated us. The one who spend over four decades working to entertain us. The one who gave up his childhood to record legendary music, the one who grew up, and recorded the best selling albums in history: Off The Wall, Thriller, Bad, Dangerous, History, BODTF, Invincible and Number Ones. What's sad is that \\"haters\\" use their life to write reviews on a purchase they never made, and spend their day bashing the biggest selling artist. They mark the 5 star reviews as \\"not helpful\\". I pity those people, or should I say, the ONE person who is in disguise as many people.This album is the only career spanning album that covers his hits and most pleasing songs. This cannot be labeled as a repackaged \\"redundant\\" album. After all, these songs helped him gain status as the \\"King of Pop.\\". Since the R&B filled #1 single from 69' \\"I Want you Back\\" to the other 3 #1 singles produced by the Jackson 5, there is nothing that can be labeled \\"disappointing\\". The disco-filled \\"Dancing Machine\\" from the united Jackson's, to probably the best Jackson's song \\"Lovely One\\", this is sure to please any listener. \\"This Place Hotel\\" ranks as one of the best songs recorded in music history. The haunting lyrics read: \\"We went up to the stairs in the ceiling room, there were two girls sitting in the room, she walked up to my face, and said this is the place, called Hearbreak Hotel\\". If compared to Elvis's \\"Heartbreak Hotel\\", Elvis may just have to stay put!The Grammy Winning Album\\" Off The Wall\\" produced #1's including \\"Rock With You\\" and \\"Don't Stop Til' You Get Enough\\". The 1982 unreleased song \\"Sunset Driver\\" would have had a good place on the Thriller album. The fast upbeat song gives a  <br />\\"city street\\" feel. Maybe the most haunting ballad is \\"Scared of The Moon\\", which displays his talented and yet virtually unmatched vocals. It may be the original \\"Little Susie\\" from 95's History album. Bad also produced 6 #1's including Smooth Criminal and the rock anthem \\"Dirty Diana\\". Dangerous, maybe the best album in history in my opinion. Producing hits like \\"Black or White\\" and \\"Remember The Time\\", this can be the highlight of the boxset. \\"Who Is It\\" is remixed. \\"Someone Put Your Hand Out\\" is the highlight of the 3rd disc. Monkey Business, recorded in 89' also is something to dwell on. Ballads on the 4th disc including the autobiographical song \\"Childhood\\". \\"Fall Again\\" and Beautiful Girl could have been released and would make great singles! The jazz flavored \\"The Way You Love Me\\" is so catchy. Finally, it ends with the anti-war song, \\"We've Had Enough\\", which also has some of the most inspiring lyrics. All in all, this is the ultimate collection, worth paying every penny for! <br />

B0002XH9Z4|4.0|The market's been flooded with Michael Jackson product in the last year -- I don't even have any idea what that \\"The One\\" DVD was all about.  I'll let the general public make up its own theories as to why.<br /><br />Its bizarre timing aside, this boxed set was long overdue.  It's been 10 years since HIStory came out (pretty amazing fact, isn't it?), and while Jackson's output since then has only consisted of one inferior album, HIStory itself was scanty to the point of being ridiculous anyway.<br /><br />The music is a fascinating study in pop stardom.  Jackson's music was so dominant in its own time that it now sounds somewhat dated.  There's a reason why The Eagles's Greatest Hits record surpassed Thriller's sales in the U.S.:  We are so familiar with Jackson's music that we now rarely shell out the bucks to buy it.  That, however, is not to be counted as a negative towards the music itself.  It doesn't pretend to be ambitious high art; it's immaculate, immensely enjoyable, catchy and commercial pop/R&B/dance music.  And with the exception of the songs from the weak Invincible album (the first Jackson record not to score a number-one single), you're still guaranteed to pack a dance floor whenever you put these songs on.  This boxed set does right to the Jackson catalogue by including his Motown years, and while those have been covered amply in the many Jackson 5/Jacksons collections over the years, to have a \\"comprehensive\\" Michael Jackson boxed set without this material would have been sacrilegious.<br /><br />That leaves the fifth disc, the DVD of a live concert in Bucharest.  The concert disc is flawed -- I like neither the shooting nor the editing, and it contains far too many audience shots.  If I never have to see a Michael Jackson fan cry or faint on camera again, it would be too soon.  But the concert disc is an incredibly fascinating case study in the midst of that Ashlee Simpson lip-sync scandal.  I've never been to a Jackson concert, so I was very surprised to find that he does sing live -- just not all the time.  The fact is, as early as the Motown anniversary special that had made Jackson into a legend, Jackson always gave a better show when he doesn't have to sing.  However, it's even more illuminating when Jackson does attempt to sing live.  On \\"Beat It\\" and \\"I Just Can't Stop Loving You\\", Jackson is clearly out of breath and offkey...and remarkably human, letting us poke through that artificial, perfectionist showman exterior to see a fallible artist doing his best.  I always wished Jackson would allow more of this side of himself to show -- to humanize his music and persona, and let the flaws be.  On this DVD, which was filmed during the Dangerous tour, you get a chance to see Michael Jackson's more ragged edges, and that is simply invaluable.  And to see the grossly underrated Siedah Garrett (she wrote \\"Man in the Mirror\\", after all, and matched Jackson note-for-note on \\"I Just Can't Stop Loving You\\") and ultra-talented, platinum-haired guitar goddess Jennifer Batten brings a flood of memories...Batten's laser-lit guitar solo in \\"Beat It\\" is so over the top, it's perfect, even though the shaky editing ate into its effect.<br /><br />If you're a Jackson fan, you probably would have bought this already and will like it.  If not, however, this is still a good chance to snap up a large number of Jackson classics in one go.  The concert DVD is also great if you've never seen a Jackson \\"live\\" performance,though Jackson stage shows have been captured far better in previous video clips like \\"Dirty Diana\\" and, even more so, \\"Come Together\\".  And given the low price tag on this five-disc box, from a value-for-money front, this boxed set really can't be topped.
068484267X|5.0|I read McCourts book and it is so real. It brought me back to my Irish roots. I could see my great grandfather in so many of the men who went off and left their families behind with no money . All because of the drink. It was the women who were the back bone of the Irish. Just as it is with other ethic groups .And of course the Catholic church shows itself worthless again and more like the mafia then saving souls.May their souls rot in hell. <br /> <br />Mr. McCourt captures the times , the emotion, the pain and the laughs like few have done in the past. Read this and all his works as well as his brothers books. His name is Malachy McCourt. <br /> <br />YOu won't want to put the book down. One of my ten best ever.
B0001LJCPC|4.0|Great soundtrack, great music selection. Just amazing, but unlike the first one, it has more of a southwestern flair and a spaghetti western feel. You won't find the techno or the high energy music at all, BUT if you loved the music from the movie, get this album.
B0000648WZ|5.0|This movie is brilliantly subversive, and was rather poorly received by critics and audience alike. Why? Many just missed the boat...er starship. It flew right over their heads.    Some disliked it because it was unsuttle - from stage like overacting to bright primary colors in set design - this was not a morally, visually grey film like the 'Alien' series - nor was it meant to be.    Many people disliked it because it was a perversion of Heinlein's classic novel. This is true, though, arguably a straight adaptation would neither have been possible, nor watchable. And the essential theme of the book is preserved.    And still others disliked it because it was mismarketed as a SF action film ala \\"Aliens\\", which it clearly is *not*.    But, I think the reason it failed to connect with mass audiences is the less obvious fact that it makes fun of them - and people just don't like being made fun of. It is a scathing (and sadly prescient) indictment of how easily the general public can (and often has) been (mis)lead.    I will refrain from a prolonged review which will likely be redundant thanks to others here who were able to see beneath the surface on this film to the \\"war makes Fascists of us all\\" theme. Instead, I will refer you to what I believe is a great, insightful review of this film: see Mr. Scott of Silver Lake, OH's review below.
B00028HBKM|4.0|After films like THE GREATEST STORY EVER TOLD, KING OF KINGS, THE LAST TEMPTATION OF CHRIST, and tv miniseries such as JESUS OF NAZARETH and the recent JESUS MINI SERIES(CBS), and endless documentaries on the life of Jesus Christ on the HISTORY CHANNEL, PBS, and TLC etc., etc. (even Monty Python's LIFE OF BRIAN can be put into the mix) one would think that THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST would be a hard sell. Mel Gibson's vision could be viewed as extreme and in some cases unwatchable. The debate(s) in the film are endless as Christianity stresses that Jesus Christ \\"suffered\\" for our sins. However, was his suffering this extreme?  Only the people who who were present could only know. Yet, if one studied the brutality of the Romans as they put on feats of carnage at the Coliseum, one could argue that the same brutality was shed at crucifixions (pre and during).  The other debate is the question of anti-semitism.  No! this film does not promote anti-semitism.  However, it was the Jewish Rabbis and clergymen who forced the Romans and egged-on their 'people' to have Jesus Christ killed because they felt threatened. Lastly, the success of the film is probably due to the timing of its release.  Every once in a while, a reaffirmation of faith is needed by the population and perhaps a serious religious film such as 'THE PASSION...' was needed.  There hasn't been a major release of this type of film in a while and with a slew of recent films concerning the supernatural, demonic, and witchcraft etc. Mel Gibson grabbed his opportunity and the film took on a life of its own. Because of this film, it is now reported that the Bible is being looked at as a new source of ideas for films (Are there Bible related or religious comic books out there?).  The entertainment value of the film is dabatable but it is provoking and it does, to a degree, reaffirm one's faith and to remind one what Christianity is all about.
B0002XDODU|5.0|When I listen to Rammstein I GET SO PUMPED!  I'm just all \\"rrrrrrRRRRRRRAAAGGGGHH!!!!\\"  YES!  It feels so friggin' good! <br /> <br />Honestly though, this is an excellent album.  My brothers and I have been waiting a while for a followup to Mutter, as I'm sure most fans have been, and this album does not disappoint.  It rocks on a level that hasn't been achieved yet this year, and because of that it deserves bonus points or something.  I don't care if these guys are singing about cute little bunnies or eating kittens (I don't speak a word of German) all I know is they know how to rock and they get the job done.   <br /> <br />If you wanna rock then you better rock out with this CD and just go \\"RRRAAAAGGGHH!\\"  'Cause it's awesome!  Oh yeah, and make sure you do that awesome right hand punching the leg thing that their lead singer does when he's rocking 'cause it's so intense!!
B0002Y4T92|5.0|Every performance from the 3 day festival would have to be included to satisfy everyone and even then no DVD can compare to the total exhilaration of being there.  I don't know what people are complaining about.  These DVDs are great and a good representation of the weekend.  I'm thankful that at least a portion of this spectacular weekend is available on DVD.  This was history, I was there, and I can relive it over and over again.
B00005JMEW|4.0|Improbable? Not really. Impossible is more like it and that's probably what writer/director/producer etc, Quentin Tarantino, had in mind. Now I happen to like some Improbable/Impossible type movies. I mean let's face it, something like ninety percent of what comes out of Hollywood runs the gamut from improbable to impossible. Actually I probably prefer impossible to improbable because then I know the writer/producer/director are not trying to put one over on me. And Kill Bill Volume 1, a tongue in cheek wild action movie gives new meaning to the concept 'impossible'.<br /><br />So what's Kill Bill about? Well, it's about bloody vengeance. It's a bloody action-packed thriller about a brutal bloody betrayal and a bloody epic vendetta! Four years after taking a bullet in the head at her own bloody wedding, The Bride (Uma Thurman) awakens from a coma and after remembering what happened to her, lusts for bloody revenge ... with a bloody vengeance! Having been gunned down by her former boss (David Carradine) and his deadly squad of international assassins, the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad, of which \\"The Bride\\" had been a star member herself, she adopts the assassin's Golden Rule - do onto others, what they would do onto you, only get them bloody first! So, \\"The Bride\\" is off to Okinawa to get, what I would call, a magic sword before beginning her quest to exact her bloody revenge upon the six who had betrayed her and murdered her whole wedding party.<br /><br />Now, if you're thinking, gee, thats not much of a story, then you're smarter than I thought. Of course with a flick like this, it isn't so much the story as the clever presentation, the overboard action, nifty special effects and subtle repartees.<br /><br />CONCLUSIONS<br /><br />One thing about Kill Bill, there are no innocent bystanders! Everyone in this movie is a brutal killer (at least those killing and being killed) of course Uma is doing most of the killing. There has never been a superhero that is more deadly than our lovely heroine \\"The Bride\\", in fact in one lengthly scene in Tokyo, she single handedly dispatches the gang of Eighty Eight, a bevy of O-Ren Ishii's personal bodyguards and O-Ren Ishii (Lucy Liu)herself. Amazing!<br /><br />So what do we have? Well if you want reality I'd suggest you watch Hulk Hogan battle The Rock. If you want something akin to fantasy then Kill Bill will warm your tummy for it's a cheesy movie loaded with over the top action, subtle humor and an unbelievable story. How was the acting? Are you kidding, it's a tongue in cheek action movie! For action junkies, ignore the acting, because it's a must-see motion picture event anyway, that has some critics raving and others ranting! However, if you are a grandmother or a nun or a child under sixteen, I'd pass on this bloody flick.that is more deadly than our lovely heroine \\"The Bride\\", in fact in one lengthly scene in Tokyo, she single handedly dispatches the gang of Eighty Eight, a bevy of O-Ren Ishii's personal bodyguards and O-Ren Ishii (Lucy Liu)herself.

B000669GAI|5.0|Pearl Jam's music is too amazing for us mortals to even come close to describing accurately in a review.
B0002F6BRE|4.0|The guy who brought us Swingers and Made makes a movie about Will Ferrell playing an elf?  I know it sounds ludicrous but it's true, and this is by far Will's best work.  The story is awkward but endearing, and all the actors do their best to work with what they are given.  Jon Favreau again does a great job with a movie that he made and while this isn't the funniest or best Christmas movie ever it is definitely worth watching at least once.
B0000VAFO0|5.0|Underworld has everything! Romance, sacrifice, regret, action, romance, and all around great everything. I'm 13 and have watched this movie about 160 times, i know every word and every dialect of the actors. The movie is the closest original Vampire and Werewolf (liecen) movie of our century. The dark and modern time vampire world is blended in with werewolf's and made into the 2 main characters. <br />   A war has spewed over the better part of a thousand years. Celina, the main charactor(kate beckensale)~a death dealer~ is trapped inside the world she has been brought up to believe, and the truth. Who started the war, and what does...this human(hot, scott speedman) have to do with anything? The movie is one to watch over and over again. With a realization of, all this could be true, that you would only hope for. The most fantastic,left on the edge of your seats, ending, and the best selection of music put together ever created. A movie (my favorite movie)i envy for being so realistic, a movie i hope, and wish, they will make a sequel to.
B0002XDODU|5.0|These guys get better with every album. It's every bit as good as Mutter, maybe better. I just picked it up and I'm listening to it for the second time so here's my song review: <br />1.Reise, Reise--Great opening track. Excellent keyboards. Just the kind of new song I've been looking for after a 3 1/2 year gap between albums. <br />2.Mein Teil--A good song, but I kind of wore that one out listening to it on the Resident Evil soundtrack. <br />3.Dalai Lama--The absolute, bar none,  BEST SONG ON THIS ALBUM. True masterpiece. <br />4.Keine Lust--Have to listen to it a couple more times to have a real opinion of it. <br />5. Los--This song sounds like Rammstein recorded it with ZZ Top playing in the background. Another great song. <br />6.Amerika--Coca cola and Wonderbra.  'Nuff said. <br />7. Moskau--I like the mixture of German and Russian vocals.  <br />8.Morgenstern--Keys stand out on this one. Another favorite. <br />9.Stein Um Stein--Took a couple of listens to grow on me, but it did. <br />10. Ohne Dich--Their most recent single, and for good reason. <br />11.Amour--Good closing track. <br />This one is going to get many hours of playtime in my stereo, just like all their other albums. <br />
B0000C8AVM|5.0|A lot has already been written about this album, and I don't have much to add to it.  I will just agree with those who say that this is one of Dylan's best albums.  A masterpiece, and highly recommended.
B00005R87Q|5.0|This movie was so awesome!  It was awesome because Vin kicked massive amounts of rocking!!  Anyway, if you like car chase movies this is the best!!!!!
B0000DD7LC|5.0|I had to get this album when I first heard 'you don't know my name.' She is a very talented woman and this Cd shows it with her vocal ability. She has the voice of an angel. Yo go girl and keep up the good work.
B0006A9FMI|5.0|Assuming that all the extras from the Japanese standard 2-disc edition dvd will make it to the American version I would have to give the actual dvd 2 stars, but of course the film itself gets 5 stars.<br /><br />The (Japanese) DVD:<br /><br />It has a disapointing making of feature that has more interviews than actual video footage of the artists at work. The making of feature on the first film was better than this one. The audio is in Dolby Digital EX 6.1, but I believe the American release will just be 5.1. There is of course a commentary track, a feature that should really appear more often than it does on anime. There is also a long interview with Oshii that I believe was recorded before the film went into production. I doubt this will make it over to the american version as well as the nearly 30 minutes of trailers.<br /><br />The $600 Gynoid Doll Edition had all of the real special features:<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />I hope the American release is this version of the making of feature:<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />The film:<br /><br />I saw this film on DVD before it came out in theaters in America. When I finally did see it in a theater I was blown away by how much visual and audio information I was missing out on compaired to DVD. A lot of things I didn't even notice until I saw them on film (like the viens in the feet during the skin grafting in the opening). I highly recommend seeing this in a theater if you ever get the chance. I don't think this is the best film or even anime ever, but I must admit that this was the best experience I had in a movie theater in years. My favorite scene is the last one. The way the final 2 cuts sum up the the film's theme is one of the best ending I have ever scene in a movie.<br /><br />You do not need to see the original \\"Ghost in the Shell\\" to understand \\"Innocence\\", but it does help as there are some refernces to the first film.as there are some refernces to the first film.
B0002ZDVEU|4.0|[...]  The film starts 2 years after the events from the previous movie. Bourne and Marie are still hiding from the intelligence agencies and other pursuers and are living quietly in India. Bourne is having bad dreams and nightmares as he remembers some details from his previous life before the amnesia. He particularly remembers something concerning his first real mission but can't remember enough to piece the events together.  Meanwhile in Berlin CIA is buying some information but in a professional hit their operative and the seller are murdered. The killer leaves Bournes fingerprints at the scene trying to implicate him in the murder. Then he travels to India with the intention of killing Bourne and covering his tracks. After a high speed chase through a small town in India Marie ends up killed and Bourne is pulled back into his former life again.  It is unclear why he decides to return. Is it to avenge his lover or because he is driven to find the truth about himself. Whatever the reason Bourne travels to Europe and intentionally gets  himself detained by the police. CIA sends its local operative to interrogate him but Bourne uses him to get access to the leader of the team that pursues him.  The CIA team is led by Pamela Landy a female operative who was responsible for the buyout operation in Berlin. She is determined to stop Bourne and uses all her influence to uncover information about the Treadstone project Bourne was part of. She is forced to cooperate with Ward Abbott, previous leader of the project whose intentions are unclear since he constantly shifts entire blame on his dead colleague Conklin and Bourne.  Bourne comes to Berlin, and gains access to the site of his first real mission. He then remembers that it was an assassination of a Russian politician Nesky, who was opposed of the privatization of oil sources in Russia. Nesky was killed so that Russian businessman Gretsky can buy the oil rights with CIA's money which was provided to him by Abbott.  Bourne gets Abbott's confession on tape and delivers it to Landy clearing his name. Then he decides to visit Russia in search of the daughter of Nesky since he feels that she must know the truth about her parents death. He manages to elude the entire Moscow police and a killer Kiril who is responsible for Marie's death.  He then resurfaces a few weeks later to contact Landy warning her to leave him alone. She then gives him his real name and some basic information about his place of birth. Bourne then, in his style again disappears in the crowd.  This is a good movie but it is not as good as The Bourne Identity. There are a few reasons why I feel that way. The Bourne Identity was excellent since there was a great mystery to be solved. The viewer had no idea who Bourne was or why he is on the run. This time the story is much more predictable and so the movie looses some of the appeal. It was quite obvious from the beginning that Bourne was framed and that somebody in CIA was involved. Once Abbott came on screen it was fairly easy to guess that he is league with the Russian businessman.  Then there is the way the movie was filmed. Almost all of the scenes were filmed with \\"hand held\\" camera and it was I presume done so that the story will seem more real and credible. I feel it was overdone making the movie unnecessarily hard to follow and some scenes are almost unwatchable. It was used to great effect in the fight scene between Bourne and a fellow Treadstone member in Germany and that scene looks great. But in the chase scene in Russia it was overdone and actually made the scene less enjoyable. The chase was actually very well done, and was on par with chase scenes in \\"Ronin\\" which I find the benchmark for this type of action. But shakiness of the scenes was distracting and confusing.  The final meeting between Bourne and Netsky girl was supposed to be a very touching, human moment but it came out overly pathetic. Mat Damon as Bourne was very good but Oksana Akinshina as Irena Netsky looked stiff and unconvincing. I would expect more of a reaction when a person is confronted with the killer of his parents.  Concerning realism, most of the movie actually looks pretty real. Bournes actions and spy tricks are believable. I particularly like the way he uses his mobile phone in the hotel to find out the number of the room where Pamela Landy is staying. Unfortunately there is one thing I can't swallow. It is Bournes driving with a bleeding shoulder wound. That kind of driving requires a lot of concentration and both hands and feet working in perfect sync. Bourne not only has a wound, but during the chase manages to cure it with an alcoholic drink (Vodka?) and manages to stop the bleeding by applying some socks he stole from the store also. So much for realism.  The performance of Matt Damon as Jason Bourne is again very good as good as in the first movie. He plays the spy very convincingly and looks very good in all action scenes. Also in more emotional scenes, like the one when Marie dies, he conveys all the emotions well. The rest of the cast is good also. Karl Urban (Eomer from The Lord of the Rings) looks like a killer but has only a few lines to deliver. Joan Allen as Pamela Landy is very good. He plays the female CIA operative with poise and never looks out of place.   Overall I liked the movie but it was not good as the first movie. The ending with Bourne disappearing into the crowd implies there will be more movies with the same character. I hope they will get better  since the Bourne character deserves a good movie.
B0001NBM1C|4.0|I had read good and bad critics about this movie but since I'm a fan of military history I decided to watch it myself and shape my own opinion. The film depicts in fine detail the colourful costumes of the period, the claustrophobic interiors of the early 19th century warships, the cruelty of the sea service, the severe discipline imposed on the crews and the primitive medical care of the unfortunates who were wounded in battle. Females are totaly abscent from this film and although this fact makes the movie a little bit dry it adds realism to the story and respects the historical truth.  <br /> <br />The battle scenes are excellent, especially the first engagement between Jack Aubrey's ship HMS \\"Surprise\\" and his worthy French opponent \\"Acheron\\". The historical authenticity is well preserved, the music themes are very good and the scenario takes some interesting and unexpected twists. Russell Crowe is a convincing British captain although the other characters are less well developed during the film. Peter Weir has brought again to life the romantic and adventurous atmosphere of the excellent books on the subject like \\"The Wooden World\\" (N.A.M. Rodger), \\"Life in Nelson's Navy\\" (Dudley Pope), \\"Trafalgar\\" (Roy Adkins), \\"To Rule the Waves\\" (Arthur Herman) etc.
0553296981|2.0|I have read Anne Franks diary many times, although its a sad story, it is quite boring. Its about a young girl who writes in her journal and is stuck in an attic because of the war. The book does not decribe anything about the war which makes it boring and you hear how she loved Peter, and the same food she ate  day after day.Its a good book in way that a young girl grows up in a 2-year period in an atiic and is more mature than her older roommate Peter. A good book that I recommend about the Holocaust is \\"Night\\" by Eli Wiesel.
B00063MBU8|3.0|personally, from &quot;no pads, no helmets..just balls&quot; to &quot;still not getting any..&quot; i find their first album better than the new one, now dont get me wrong, their new album is alright, I admit that i have it, i'll listen to it every now and then, with new tracks, like &quot;welcome to my life&quot;, &quot;crazy&quot; and &quot;me against the world&quot; to me, personally i dont think there's enough singing on the new album, the sound, is kind of off beat, but thats just my opinion on it, before buying, i suggest that you listen to it at the music store listening booth.
B00006ZCFH|5.0|Erika made a good,good work. This CD is about soul,funky & Hip Hop. In my opinion much better that Mama's Gun. Also the quality of recording is increased. Especcialy the sounds of the Drums is better than the previous CD's. They sounds full , strong and the gave a good vibe to all the tracks on this record.
B0002Z1EG2|5.0|I bought this CD knowing it would be one of my favorite Shania Twain collections. Every song on this album is a hit! I would definitely recommend Shania fans and EVEN non Shania fans to buy this album. You will not be dissapointed. <br /> <br />My favorite songs: <br /> <br />ALL OF THEM !!! LOL
B00005JN2Z|4.0|Collateral is a film that has the same ingredients that the old Miami Vice tv show had , when Crocket got amnesia and thought he was a hired hitman. Basically , due to the fact that they needed a ratings boost , for the hit NBC show. Evidentally it made an impact because , Michael Mann regurgitated this theme , for \\" Collateral\\". Or , quite possibly , he had intended on doing a film on the idea but wrote it into the Miami Vice tv , show. Which wouldn't be unheard of , because Micheal Mann was just starting to make a name for himself , in Hollywood. And to get the \\"greenlight\\" on films from untested director's is nearly impossible. Even to this date , not to mention the 80's. Either way , it's been long enough and so the idea , although used , comes across very fresh and interesting. Tom Cruise and Jamie Foxx , give outstanding performances. Michael Mann has a pention for telling stories in creative and realistic ways ( Thief , Ali , ect )...and this film is exemplerary of that talent. Definately a film to check out.It'll be collateral ..very well spent.
1400034779|5.0|I lived in Gaborone 20 years ago, back when there were no traffic lights, and the road to Kgali hill was dust and bush.  This this book brought so many memories back!  The changes in the city are substantial, but the people remain the same. <br /> <br />Yes, the story is fictional, but the kindness, the concern for any neighbor, the love there is for every brother and sister in that huge expansion of land that is Botswana, remains the same. <br /> <br />The story is a simple one, like the life of the people.  Mma Ramotswe's investigative adventures are not thrilling and suspenseful, but fit perfectly in a world where there are no major complications.  The results of her investigations seem to come easily, but in a world where everybody knows everybody, and is somehow related to everybody too, doors open easily and conversations are started without difficulty. This is not a book to analyze until exhaustion, but one to enjoy for the simple pleasure of a good time. <br /> <br />I'm only reviewing this book, but I read the whole series, and loved it.  For a person that has not had my experience, I recommend the book simply as an escape of the \\"real world\\".  The pages go by fast, the story is light and entertaining, the characters are delightful, it is so much fun!
B0002Z9HT8|5.0|FINALLY!  Last night I watched with unabashed glee most of this DVD set and I was completely transported back to the joy of that day.  I was at JFK (the heat, my God THE. HEAT.) and besides remembering how I nearly melted out there, I remember the excitement, the feeling that we were participating in something that mattered.  Yes, yes, yes, it would be nice to have all the acts and all the songs, but this is far better than what we had before, which for me was home recorded VHS tapes from the TV (thanks, Grandma!) that were becoming unviewable.  The Queen and U2 sets alone are worth the price.  It has instantly become a tresured possession, a way for me to recall a highlight of my life.
B00065JTBA|5.0|Well, all I can say is that some of the songs on this set are bettet than some album tracks. Then there are some songs that have a twin that made a record. Why Arn't You Dead, might as well be the same as I'll Sleep When I'm Dead. Still a very good song. The demo version of Always might be better than the album version, same goes for Someday I'll Be Saturday Night. This version has a much darker message that the Crossroad's version. All in all this might be the best boxed set out on the market this year. I mean you can buy the Beatles new set with nothing new, or can buy this one and get new songs for your hard earned money... <br /> <br />Top 5 Songs <br />1) Nobody's Hero  <br />2) These Arms Are Open All Night <br />3) Last Chance Train <br />4) Kidnap An Angel  <br />5) Lonley At The Top <br /> <br />Oh and Disc 4 Track 13 has a nice little suprise...

B00068IOWM|2.0|Hola. Siento escribir esto pero este disco es bastante decepcionante y mediocre. Creo que U2 han exagerado mucho la promocin de este album diciendo una y otra vez en reiteradas ocasiones que es el mejor de su carrera, cosa que no es cierta. Las letras en este album estn muy bien logradas, con excepcin de Vertigo. Lamentablemente no ocurre lo mismo con la msica, que sigue los mismos patrones de All That You Can't Live Behind, por lo que no sorprende y el resultado es un disco pasajero, intrascendente, que seguramente tendr gran xito comercial, pero no artstico. Parece ser que este es un album que lo amas o lo odias, pero a m, ms que eso, me decepciona profundamente al ver la carencia de compromiso e intensidad musical, repitiendo y volviendo a utilizar la frmula ya probada con All That You Can't Live Behind. Se ha apresurado mucho en poner crticas extraordinarias del disco, de seguro como parte de la campaa publicitaria, pero eso hace que al escuchar el verdadero disco sea an ms decepcionante, ya que las crticas especializadas lo elevan a la categora de obra maestra, por lo que uno se crea tan altas expectativas que al final la cada es an mayor. Una de las cosas ms bajas del disco es la voz de Bono, que inexplicablemente lucha una y otra vez con su voz para tratar de demostrar que an puede cantar registros altos, dando por resultado algo pattico. Lo otro que desiluciona es la falta de continuidad del disco, cada cancin por separado puede ponerse en cualquier single promocional o edicin limitada, no teniendo esa profundidad de Achtung Baby o Pop. Esa visin obsesionadamente comercial por superar las ventas de All That You Can't Leave Behind hacen que el disco pierda toda originalidad, novedad, intensidad, honestidad y compromiso, y se transforme en algo as como un The Best Of 2001-2004. Por lo mismo es que se distinguen claramente las canciones singles de las de relleno, siendo Vertigo, Miracle Drug, City Of Blinding Lights o Crums For Your Table de las primeras, y Love And Peace Or Else, One Step Closer, A Man And A Woman o bien Original Of The Species las segundas.  <br />Si ests pensando en adquirir el disco y tienes ms de 20 o 25 aos, es decir, has escuchado y vivido algo del U2 de los 90, este disco puede causarte una gran rabia y frustracin. Por el contrario, si tienes 15 aos y gozaste con All That You Can't Live Behind, vas a adorar este album. Nuevamente reitero, un disco que lo amas o bien lo odias, para m slo significa una palabra: decepcin.
0881031216|5.0|Here's one more reader who finds Pride and Prejudice an excellent novel. I appreciate the positive reviews as they motivated me to start a classic which I may not have begun without some encouragement.
B0002XDODU|1.0|Well, I guess this album will appeal to the hardcore fans that will accept any kind of crap from der Fuhrer land. I have all their albums to date and I must say this one is pure sheisen - not one good track on this weak ass waste of money. What's with the ballads anyway? This album is so unlistenable as to be painful. I tried to listen to even the semi-metal tracks and I end up turning it off before I throwen sie up. If you want Rammstein, get their DVD's.
B0002Z9HT8|5.0|It was a long wait, but now we can finally retire our tattered off-air videotapes and relive the legendary Live Aid Concert in (almost) all its glory! This was the event that was never 'supposed' to be officially archived (an inexplicable request from organizer Bob Geldof, which I can only attribute to an arbitrary fit of meglomanical pique on Sir Bob's part). Thank God some engineers at the BBC and MTV chose (wisely) to ignore this ridiculous demand. Picture and sound on this 4-DVD set are outstanding, considering circumstances (technical/TV satellite snafus and a limited amount of archival masters to cull from). It depends on who you talk to as to what the highlights of the day were, but there is something for everybody on this collection. From metal, blues, folk, classic rock, soul, jazz, synth-pop, new wave and beyond, its all here (okay, there wasn't so much in the way of prog, reggae or country, and hip-hop and rap were still a few years away from mass acceptance, but Live Aid still stands as the greatest example of genre-blind musical unity, post-Woodstock.) As for reviewers who are crying about how this is ONLY 10 hours long (!)-if you had bothered to read the accompanying booklet, you would learn that lots of footage was either lost or was not (officially) archived in the first place. Would you prefer that the producers of \\"Woodstock\\" had released a 72-hour cut of that event so you could watch all three days in real time? Of course, you are welcome to stick to your pirated VHS version, complete with those annoying MTV VJ's yammering all over song intros (and if you recall in many cases they would cut away from artists in MID PERFORMANCE so you could see how much fun the VJ's were having singing along and mugging for the camera-interrupting an event that was never to be seen again!!) Well worth the investment.
B000062YAZ|1.0|This album is really comical, Hell Awaits was respactable even interesting but this always has been a joke. The guitarists clearly needed a good dose of Johnny Marr.
0060589272|2.0|It is a steamy romance, and the author is trying to use it as a vehicle for an exploration into sex, love, and desire.  I did not believe that a 23 year old girl from the countryside of Brazil could have gained such wisdom and insight and be applying it to her life.
B0000VCZK2|5.0|When my husband bought this, I just rolled my eyes at him, but, know what- I love it. It was great having the whole set and the added extra scenes and the behind the scenes were excellent. Worth every penny, loved the movies and had a blast!!!
068987474X|1.0|I think a good number of the newer self-help (dating/relationship) books out there give a pass to the men who are selfish, immature, and like game-playing when it comes to dating.  This book supports the belief that women are objects to either be chosen or discarded at the man's whim.  It also supports the myth that every woman who is dating wants to marry and very soon.  In a nutshell, this book paints most men to be so egotistical, that they couldn't spot a decent woman if they saw one.  Nor would they want her if she was available because they have so many other choices.  Do you really want to take relationship advice from a writer from \\"Sex and the City\\".  Nah, I didn't think so.
B0000A02TZ|4.0|Oldie but still a goodie. Great to take out and watch with friends. Good old days type fun. Great movie. Not for the kiddies. Get your popcorn and enjoy!
0596007124|5.0|We need more books like this for other areas such as .NET (C#), Web Services as well as software engineering areas.     I started reading this book last week, and I can't put the book down. Being an application framework developer, I think I am going to benefit significantly from a deeper understanding on when and how to apply design patterns.    I will be on the lookout for more books from the authors as well as from this series. Kudos to O'Reilly press.    Great work.
B0002KVUKM|4.0|A most enjoyable film.  Just suspend your preconceived notions about who Van Helsing is based on the old, old movies and let yourself be transported into the world of the \\"new\\" Van Helsing.  It's populated with new creatures, new ideas, great special effects and is just plain Gothic fun.
B00005JLKB|5.0|OK... if you expect these series to be like the Superman movies... one thing I can say about that... don't expect it to be. <br />This show is about a young man starting high school who just found out that he was \\"special\\". Gaining special powers every once in a while even. He feels as if he got the weight of the world on his shoulders. Now, with all that pressure on him, and still growing up in High School... I'm sure he'll be a little bit edgy at times, though I don't find him to be that at all. He's a teenager. So what, he's \\"special\\"... he still has a right to at least act like a teenager. He's trying so hard to just fit in, and he'll go through any lengths just to keep his secret, well... a secret. <br /> <br />Grant it, I never read the comics, but maybe it's for the best. All comics stray from the movies they become to be. Get over it. Not everything stays the same. <br /> <br />Watch the show, and get hooked, as I did. The show is probably one of my favorite TV shows, but then again, I dont really watch much TV. I just turn it on for Smallvile, then an hour later, go back to whatever I was doing. It's a great show. It has new ideas in every episode, and very enjoyable to watch as well. Special effects, humor, action, and drama fomr time to time... all things a great show needs to have.
B00063EMJ6|5.0|i would have exchanged harvest moon for sugar mountain, but the obvious hits are here.  the remastered sound is great.  so now we're primed for warner's to remaster the rest of his catalog.
B00005JMUL|5.0|I have seen the future of movies.<br /><br />As of this writing, \\"The Incredibles\\" is getting all the attention and box office bucks, but if you want to experience a jaw-dropping, eye-popping, wondrous and magical experience, please, please do not hesitate to see this film in 3D on the biggest Imax screen you an find.<br /><br />There's no doubt in my mind that this awesomely beautiful, painterly, digital creation was designed for 3D.  When you put on your polarizing 3D glasses (no red/blue lenses) and the movie starts with the 3D Castle Rock logo, you will be transported to another time and place. And not only that, the incredible feeling of transcendant magic that you always hope will happen in movies but seldom does will stay with you for the duration of this truly amazing film. And hours afterward...<br /><br />Robert Zemeckis and Tom Hanks had a vision for something that we have never seen before and they delivered.  It's not just the idea but the extraordinary execution. If Chris Van Allsburg's illustrated but static story is simple, the seductive power of the expanded, detailed, moving images is huge.  And the theme about Doubt and the Gift of Believing in what seems too good to be true IS of course the heart of the Christmas story.<br /><br />Other reviewers (jealous gremlins from Pixar?) have mentioned the animated kids look like \\"zombies with dead eyes.\\"  I didn't see that at all.<br /><br />The 3D digital version is very much like Van Allsburg's illustrations.  And the powerful steam locomotive has real mass and inertia as it drives the story on its dangerous route to the North Pole and the huge, fabled city where millions of elves serve a mighty but kindly Father Christmas.  This Santa is no department store joke. (But who or what is the hobo on the train? Could he be Santa in another guise?)<br /><br />I can't wait to see it again and sit back as the huge, shimmering, crystal clear fully 3D images come to life in the space between my eyes and the screen, enveloping me in a world of wonder unlike anything I have experienced at the movies.  And the great, inventive sound mix and music score (except for one song) on the 15,000 Watt Imax true surround sound system are an aural delight that perfectly enhances the 3D visuals.<br /><br />I'm sure the 2D version looks just fine. But the real magic only happens on the big Imax screen in 3D.<br /><br />See this film and you will understand why the future of movies has arrived.  An absolute barrier has been broken where ancient art and new technology perfectly merge.  Now for certain, you can make real -- or should I say \\"reel\\"? -- anything you can dream.<br /><br />By all means jump aboard.  Take this ride and you too will go from doubt to believing -- anything is possible.like anything I have experienced at the movies.

0140067477|5.0|In \\"The Tao of Pooh\\", Benjamin Hoff uses the personalities of the characters in A. A. Milne's tales to illustrate Taoism alongside some competing worldviews.      The characters can divided into 3 categories of personality and philosophy: Rabbit/Owl, Eeyore, and Pooh.      Rabbit quickly develops and executes clever action plans that don't capture the essence of a given situation and usually go awry.  Similar to Rabbit in terms of being too clever by half, Owl pontificates and analyzes and never actually does anything.  Eeyore is also clever in his own way, but interprets everything negatively and is bitter and ineffectual.  Whereas Pooh ambles along without the brains of the others, but with a stout heart, and muddles through to contentment.    Rabbit/Owl together embody logical analysis, clever planning, and ceaseless but largely misdirected hard work. The aim of all their analysis and effort is to exert maximum control over outcomes by actively 'understanding' and intervening in every situation.  In the Eastern tradition, this approach corresponds to Confucianism, a very rigid and circumscribed approach to achieving harmony.  In the Western tradition, the Rabbit/Owl approach seems very familiar, as the general attempt to organize and control our physical and social environments with logical tools and techniques is integral to the Western experience.  The Rabbit/Owl approach regrets the past and worries about the future.    Eeyore represents knowing resignation.  The aim of this hopelessness, and the ensuing lack of commitment and activity, is to shield oneself emotionally from the risk and reality of failure.  In the Eastern tradition, this approach corresponds to Buddhism, which counsels that our world is illusion and suffering, and the best response is to actively disengage from it all. In the Western tradition, the Eeyore approach can be construed as loosely analogous to the easy cynicism and disengagement of the many people who are alienated by the overbearing and omnipresent Rabbit/Owl aspects of society.  The Eeyore approach sees endless failure in the past and inevitable failure in the future.    Pooh, on the other hand, embodies warm-hearted, inclusive, and spirited enjoyment of what's happening in the moment.  He unconsciously embodies the fact that we cannot control the infinitely complex interplay of forces and events out there, so the healthiest response to this overwhelming reality is to be true to our inner nature and in so doing, accept being part of the great flow of things.  In the Eastern tradition, Pooh's approach is Taoist.  He does not worry about the past.  He does not worry about the future.  He simply is himself, now, enthusiastically.  He is simply honest and true to his friends and to his own nature.  To Pooh, 'things are as they are', and do not need constant worry, analysis, self-doubt, and striving, unlike the flustered Confucian-Rabbits.  But at the same time, he is quite engaged in the world, unlike the fatalistic Buddhist-Eeyores.  When he wants hunny, he goes about getting it, quite tenaciously at times.  When he wants to help a drowning Roo or Eeyore, he rushes to save them with whatever's handy.  And so on.    \\"The Tao of Pooh\\" is overall a charming read.  Hoff does a good job of maintaining the whimsical tone of the original Pooh tales, painlessly conveying some fairly abstruse concepts about the nature of reality and perception.      To be fair, it should be noted that there's a bit of apocalyptic sermonizing at the very end, to the effect that the Owls and Rabbits of the world will destroy everything if we don't learn a better way to be. Also some readers will construe Hoff's periodic mild teasing of the Rabbit/Owl way as irritating intolerance, hypocritically un-Taoist. Personally, I do not take his teasing that way at all;  Taoist hermits probably did not show much deference to the great Confucian bureaucrats of their day!  To me, these are minor and forgivable blemishes in a book that otherwise has a deft, light touch, though not as light as the childlike wisdom of the Way that it hopes to explain.
B00005AQGH|5.0|Intro 1.bomb first (my second reply) (9/10) This has the outlawz on it, before the song starts you hear a news reporter. Talking about the album.   2.hail mary (10/10) a very well done beat, 2pac out does himself on here. And then the outlawz come in last. The were cold too.   3.toss it up (10/10) I think KC & Jojo were the ones singing. at the end he diss Dre about being gay and not going to Compton.   4.to live & die in l.a. (10/10) This is \\"California part 2 with out [...] a$$ Dre\\" That is what he called it. But this song is 2pac telling much he loves Cali.  5.blasphemy (10/10) which is the greatest sin, to speak against the holly ghost. 2pac really uses energy in this song.   6.life of an outlaw (8/10) This song tells you what it is like to live like an outlaw. The outlawz are on this one.   7.just like daddy (8/10) more for women just like toss it up.   8.krazy (10/10) I like the hook, it is a deep song.   9.white man'z world (9/10) Telling you this is a white man's world and you can get through it if you are smart. A very good song.   10.me and my girlfriend (10/10) the classic bonnie and clyde song, 2pac and his honnie. Jay-Z redid this song with Beyonce.   11.hold your head (9/10) he is saying along with tyrone wrice through everything that is going on. hold your head up.   12.against all odds (10/10) best song on here next to hail mary, he goes all out on here dissing Dr.Dre, Mobb Deep, Jay-Z, Nas, P.Diddy, and some people I don't even know about.     I know I reviewed this before but this album deserves a second review. You can't like rap and don't listen to 2pac. That's like saying I like going in planes but your not flying he was just to good and had to many sides. RIP 2pac.
B00003CXCT|1.0|the sound and picture are all great but the movie is a mutation of the original.These arent the movies people loved when they first came out.I only saw Star Wars around 1990 when I was 8 years old.I loved it then.It became my favorite movie.I was in line for the special editions because I so badly wanted to see them on theater  big screen.  Though the additions to those movies werent needed or liked by me I still loved Star Wars.  I found the laser disc editions of the original versions and they are better than these dvd's.I wont buy these dvds.I say you shouldnt either.  Send a message to George and make it clear we dont want to see his best movies turned into promotional material for the horrible prequel movies.Whats the reason to add characters from the prequel to these movies?Like I said its just to promote his new movies.

B0002OERI0|5.0|Green Day, after there wonderful Debut \\"Dookie\\", have been on a roll. This being their 3rd overall album, is a masterpiece. The ramones, sex pistols, and clash could never and will never make a cd this good.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|The first 2 slipknot albums (ok, not including MFKR to all you true maggots) were great in their time, being pretty different from most things before, with the rapping and unholy growls from Corey Taylor mixed with lethal drumming of joey jordison as well as shawn and chris made quite a nice, thrash sound. <br /> <br />After 2 years of absense, with at least 3 successful sideprojects with members from the knot, they needed to make a new album, or just carry on with these projects for good. Although iowa and s/t were good, there wasn't much left they could do. <br /> <br />When I first heard vol 3, I was dissapointed. All this hype, living in a haunted mansion, blah blah blah. But after listening to it again, I realized how good they actually are. They have combined all the great features from the first 2 albums, and added to it, with solos, romance songs (albeit depressing love songs!), and with a less hip hop feel with more metal. From welcome to circle, they have shown their musical talent in all spectrums, and I think this makes it their best album, by far.  <br />
B0002XDODU|1.0|Another steaming load from the kings of eurotrash.It's sad if this is the best that Germany has to offer.
B0002XDODU|5.0|In their first new album in more than 3 years, Rammstein returns with their most varied and best album yet in \\"Reise, Reise\\".  Their range continues to expand both musically and lyrically spanning from the softer and almost balladic Los, Ohne Dich and Amour to the anthemic Morgenstern, Dalai Lama, and Reise, Reise to the hard-driving Mein Teil and Keine Lust.  They even poke a little fun in the political arena with Amerika and Moskau.  All-in-all, a great album and my favorite released thus far in Y2K4.
B0002XDODU|5.0|This might be the die-hard Rammstein fan inside of me speaking, or it could be my teenage hormones telling me to love the metal music, but I absolutely loved this album. I've been long awaiting their new release, and this album doesn't fall short of my high expectations for the band. I wouldn't reccomend it if you are a new Rammstein fan and looking to check out some of their stuff for the first time, but if you've been a fan of theirs, the album is definately worth it.
B00065JTBA|5.0|`I don't need no sympathy!' is from the second track on the third disc.  I've been Bon Jovi since the beginnings of music for me and I thought I really knew the band throughout all these years.  All the new songs show how the group can really keep their creativity and talent going with the changing times.  There's so much awesome new material to digest! <br /> <br />Highly recommended!  There's no other like BJ and they've always given my musical taste much needed satisfaction.  The DVD is definitely a bonus also~ <br />
B00005JMFQ|4.0|This is the perfect Christmas gift to get any member of the group of free-loading moochers you call your friends.  It's the perfect excuse to have a movie night at THEIR house, and make them ante up some wine, cheese, grapes and lots of chocolate, then hunker down for an evening of cornball romantic comedy with a difference.<br /><br />Chances are, with Colin Firth, Hugh Grant, Liam Neeson and Alan Rickman on show, you won't even notice that the storyline is hardly Pulitzer Prize material, but you do stand the chance of busting a seam when Hugh does his Footloose/Saturday Night Fever/Risky Business impression at Lot 10 Downing Street, and Bill Nighy makes like Robert Palmer for a video shoot of the worst ever chart topping Christmas song.  There's also the incomparable Rowan Atkinson, making like Mr.Bean at appropriately inopportune moments.<br /><br />In case you think it's all about the guys (it is - but one can't take sides) there's a brilliant performance by Emma Thompson, and also Laura Linney, who has the worst cell phone ring tone ever invented.  Keira Knightley is more \\"Bend It Like Beckham\\" than \\"Pirates of the Caribbean\\" in this one, feigning wide open surprise a little too often. She's cute though, even if I always get her mixed up with Natalie Portman, the Amidala girl.<br /><br />There are enough love stories and love disasters here to sink a luxury liner - and yes, there are \\"Titanic\\" references too.  Even though the couples are for the most part separate little stories, there's a connection running through the movie that really ties them all together.<br /><br />The music is great, the movie is funny, and your friends will have to entertain you at their expense - what more could you ask from a movie?  Did I mention it has Colin Firth, Hugh Grant, Liam Neeson and Alan Rickman?<br /><br />Amanda Richards, November 17, 2004

B00063EMJ6|5.0|It is amazing to me how many times record companies and/or the artists themselves manage to screw up a \\"greatest hits\\" compilation. Too often are such compilations done to represent the entire career of the artist, regardless whether the artist's biggest hits stem from throughout that career. The \\"Elton John Greatest Hits 1970-2002\\" is a good example of that: too many latter day non-greatest hits take up space instead of overlooked real greatest hits.<br /><br />Neil Young's \\"Greatest Hits\\" (16 tracks, 77 min.) thankfully is just that: his truly greatest hits, regardless of how recent or not so recent they are. This results then in a compilation on which only the last 2 songs are are post-1979 (1989's \\"Rockin' in the Free Workd\\" and 1992's \\"Harvest Moon\\"). In other words, 14 of the 16 songs on here are from 1969-1979. Although one can always argue whether this or that song should've been on here (I'd say that \\"Comes a Time\\" belongs on here), the truth is that, for the CASUAL Neil Young fan (if there is such a thing), this \\"Greatest Hits\\" CD truly represents his best known songs.<br /><br />For the not-so-casual Neil Young fan, beware: there is significant overlap between this \\"Greatest Hits\\" and the 1977 \\"Decade\\" compilation: 10 of the 16 songs on \\"Greatest Hits\\" are also found on \\"Decade\\". That said, kudos for the audio quality of this CD, which sounds remarkedly better than the \\"Decade\\" compilation. \\"Neil Young Greatest Hits\\" is an essential CD for any music fan.
B0002Z9HT8|4.0|OK just picked this up last night. Forget all the negative reviews. I don't think alot of these people have even seen this dvd set. First I read the insert and it says alot of the performances were of poor quality, wrong they were great. Considering it was 1985 I was suprised at the quality. I would have given this 5 stars but there are some performances that were left out. If you are a Queen fan this is a must have. They stole the show. I hae been buying alot of concert dvds of the classic acts, and I am glad they finally released this. I love the fact that I can share this with my kids now and let them know what a great thing Bob Geldof did for the people of Africa. So just go and buy this set you will not be disappointed.
B000669GAI|5.0|After last year's excellent \\"Lost Dog\\" collection of B-sides and rarities, now comes the more straightforward collection of Pearl Jam's \\"greatest hits\\", surely not in the Top 40 sense of hits, but perhaps better titled the \\"best and most beloved\\" songs of Pearl Jam.<br /><br />\\"rearviewmirror (Greatest Hits 1991-2003)\\" (2 CDs, 33 tracks, 145 min.) is divided up between the rockers and the 'ballads'. CD1 (16 tracks, 66 min.) is the \\"Up Side\\", and covers such classics as \\"Once\\", \\"Alive\\", Curderoy\\", \\"Not For You\\", \\"Hail Hail\\", etc., this rocks from start to end. CD2 (17 tracks, 79 min.) is the \\"Down Side\\" and includes great songs  like \\"Black\\", \\"Daughter\\", \\"Elderly Woman\\", \\"Off He Goes\\", \\"Nothingman\\", and \\"Last Kiss\\", the band's only true \\"Top 40\\" hit. Smartly and rightly, this collection emphasizes the early years: 21 of the 33 tracks cover the first 4 years of the band (up to \\"Vitalogy\\"), whereas the last 9 years are covered by 12 tracks. So thankfully no \\"Elton John Greatest Hits 1970-2002\\" situations, where latter day non-greatest hits are taking up space and block other genuine greatest hits of the earlier days from being included.<br /><br />The cynic deep inside of me wanted to believe that this collection was just another attempt by Epic/Sony, the label Pearl Jam left last year, to squeeze the last financial drop out of the Pearl Jam phenom. And maybe that is what's going on, who knows. But in the end, I couldn't resist having all the best songs of Pearl Jam onto a single collection. In an era where too often \\"greatest hits\\" and \\"best of\\" collections are botched by the record label and/or the artist, this collection was done exactly right.
B00000K3D4|5.0|As many times as I've watched this movie on cable and on tape, I never tire of it.  The story is original and everything about the movie - from the background to the superb acting - sucks you right into the land of the goblins.<br /><br />David Bowie played a fantastic bad guy and his contributions to the movie's soundtrack were equally stunning.<br /><br />Kids and adults alike should be required to watch this movie just to let themselves float into a fantasy for an hour and a half.  It's healthy for the self.
B000002A46|5.0|This christmas cd surpasses any cd i own (vocally). <br />SUPERB job on O Holy Night!!! <br />if only mariah sang like this these days...
B00000K3D4|5.0|Labyrinth is an enchanting, well-made movie. The general plot isn't particularly original, but the way it was made, with Henson's puppets and excellent sets, really makes this a standout. <br /> <br />The music in the movie, which includes songs sung by the goblin king David Bowie, is great. My sisters and I used to run around singing \\"Magic Dance\\" when we were kids. I found Connelly very convincing as the teenaged Sarah and Bowie made a very good goblin king. Some of the special effects of the film, do seem a bit dated now, but they don't detract from the story a bit.  <br /> <br />I would recommend this movie for children who can stand a few mildly frightening scenes. I think most adults would enjoy watching this with their kids, making this an excellent choice for a family movie night. Labyrinth fans will enjoy the extras with this DVD.
B00007G1ZC|5.0|Although lacking the tight narrative movement of some of Kuraswa's best films, this loosely knit series of vignettes have moments of transporting beauty and depth.<br /><br />Kurasawa's dreams will work their way into your own.<br /><br />There are moments of horror, brutality, fear, nostalgia, wonder, sadness and joy. The great thing about Kurasawa is his ability to create a cinematic world in which these feelings are experienced by the sympathetic viewer. I think of these short stories as fairy tales for adults, and the film produces a childlike suspension of disbelief, an acceptance of wonder, and a willingness to be led to truth by beauty.<br /><br />Fairy tales are saturated with mythical achetypes that carry important cultural meaning, and many have a universal appeal to deeply-held belief systems and values. The universal appeal of Kurasawa's work is directly connected to his understanding and use of mythical archetypes. Even when translating a story from a Russian author and plopping the characters down in Edo-period Japan, or setting a Shakespearean  drama down in Japan's feudal countryside, it is Kurasawa's depiction of the universal in the particular that makes him both a great Japanese director and a great world director.<br />Now, I don't love  every vignette in this film equally, but I am truly haunted by some of the images and scenes in a disturbing way that makes my life richer and more interesting. That makes me think that you might like this film, too.
B00000G6FN|5.0|Bought this \\"Best of\\" on Vinyl. Very Hard to Find, Limited Issue, and on Purple Vinyl. <br /> <br />Very Nice Compilation of Deep Purple's Hits - It may not contain all of them - But its really nicely mixed & produced. <br /> <br />If you can find it on Vinyl - pick it up - put it away - and save. This LP is going to appreciate in value based on its limited pressing.
B000069HK2|5.0|the Used is definitely one of best and most suscessful new band nowadays, the highly energetic and emotional performance of volcalist Bert McCracken, and creative instrumentation make the Used very unique among others, listen to tracks like \\"Maybe Memories\\", \\"Bulimic\\", \\"Blue And Yellow\\", \\"Greener With The Scenery\\", you'll see how they combine different moods/style from differnet members, break those barrier, and become something really powerful and you'll keep listening over and over again.
B0002XH9Z4|3.0|******I bough this from bestbuy for $29.99******<br /><br />I would give this set a higher rating but the lack of new material just means sony is trying to milk MJ's legacy as much as they can.  I wish sony would have dug deeper in their MJ vault for more unreleased songs instead of just the 13 rare songs.  Alternate version of already released songs would have been better than just the usual predictable hits.  I hate sony, but love MJ thats why I bought this.  If you are a trendy MJ fan F*** YOU (he's has so many more songs than just hits that are great), but if you are a true MJ fan buy this and enjoy a hint of unreleased material.  Michael said he writes 150+ songs for each album so if that is the cas why do we only get 13 unreleased songs?  Some rare and unreleased songs along with some demos make this set a must for any die hard mj fan.  The concert DVD is worth the price alone, just look at bootlegs of the same concert DVD on eBay.  So in all of my rambling I probably haven't convinced anyone to get this.  All and I mean all of the unreleased material on this set is awesome and unique.  Some songs are raw and sound like demos and others sound finished and refined.  You can't truly appreciate Michael's creative and artist range until you listen to these songs.  Price this before you buy it.  I bought it at Best Buy for $29.99 instead of the $50 everyone else is selling it for.  MJ FOREVER
B00005JMJG|3.0|At first glance, it would be easy to dismiss Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind as just another pretentious indie movie.  And there's a very good reason for that: it is a pretentious indie movie.  A newly broken-up couple deciding to have their memories of one another erased?  Entire scenes filmed inside Jim Carrey's memory?  A stream-of-consciousness narrative with a constantly-jumping timeline?  God, that sounds even worse than the snoozeathon that was Lost in Translation.  However, there's more to the story here.  Unlike many movies of its ilk, Eternal Sunshine doesn't attempt to be all cleverness and originality at the expense of everything else.  It may be a pretentious indie movie, but it's a pretentious indie movie with heart.<br /><br />While Eternal Sunshine does take a little while to get going, and it can take even more time to figure out what's going on, those who stick with it will be rewarded with one of the most innovative and intelligent viewing experiences of recent years.  It's definitely not your typical popcorn movie, but Eternal Sunshine mixes its bizarre plot with much more emotional resonance than you might expect from what initially appears to be a rather gimmicky film.  In fact, the high concept and the underlying lost-love story ultimately serve to enhance one another.  The movie's unconventional idea and narrative structure actually serve to make the central message about holding onto one's memories more, not less, affecting.  It's a pretty neat trick, really.<br /><br />The movie's helped along by some of the best ensemble casting you'll ever see, led by a surprisingly solid performance from Jim Carrey.  There are a lot of prominent characters in this movie, but they're all nicely fleshed out with some economical dialogue and strong if understated acting.  Those accustomed to Carrey's furious mugging in his prior outings will be surprised by what he shows here, as his quiet desperation and occasional befuddlement add to the proceedings without distracting from them.  There are plenty of memorable performances elsewhere, from Kate Winslet's quirkiness and passion to Elijah Wood's underhanded smarminess to Kirsten Dunst's naive innocence.  Not to mention, any movie that features Dunst dancing on a bed in her underwear gets some extra points from me.<br /><br />By this point, two bifurcated opinions regarding independent films have emerged.  People tend to regard them (in general) as either inspired pieces of art free from the demands of commercialism or boring exercises in self-indulgence.  Of course, if you're reading this review you probably gravitate toward the former view, but even if you don't you may well find something to like here.  It can take some work to get past the admittedly weird goings-on here, but some persistent watching reveals a challenging, well-constructed movie with lots to enjoy for the intelligent viewer.  Plus, unlike many indie comedies, it's actually funny.edings without distracting from them.

B0002XDODU|2.0|After anticipating Rammstein's next album for 3 years after the release of Mutter, I wanted to cry when I finished listening to this cd. Rammstein's previous albums were all beyond great, especially Mutter. I truly cannot see how anyone can even think about claiming Reise, Reise as a better album than that. This new release is very disappointing for anyone who fell in love with Rammstein because of their very heavy, melodic guitar riffs and songs put together so well. If you liked Mutter especially for the songs Links 2,3,4, Sonne, Ich Will, Fever Frei, Zwitter, and Adios, you will hate what Rammstein has become. Many of the songs seem very lame, with a background of a boring guitar and singer Till just rambling on forever. Don't get me wrong, if you are not a die hard fan of Mutter and Sehnsucht, Reise, Reise is a good album. I think that the title track and Amerika are the only songs that can amount to the other albums', and Mein Teil and Moskau are pretty good too. All of this is just MY opinion, and thank you very much for considering my thoughts!
B0006IUDXA|5.0|I love MacGyver. It is undoubtedly one of my all-time favourite shows, and I am ecstatic to learn it is finally going to be available on DVD. I can only hope and pray it will be available in Australia, because only one of my DVD players is formatted to play Region 1 disks.<br /><br />MacGyver is a classic action show from the Eighties/early Nineties. It had just about everything - action, adventure, trauma, disaster, triumph, excitement, comedy and even the occasional touch of romance. We have the lead character Angus MacGyver (his first name was finally provided in one solitary episode, much to the character's displeasure), his best friend and boss Pete Thornton, who is head of the Phoenix Foundation, and his nemesis, Murdoch, who pops up every so often with one thought on his twisted mind - kill MacGyver.<br /><br />One of the highlights of the show was watching the title character get out of the tightest jams using seemingly mundane, everyday objects. As a friend pointed out, put a Swiss Army Knife, duct tape and a couple of wires in the guy's hand, and he could blow his way out of Fort Knox.<br /><br />Yes, the show seemed silly at times, but that was half the fun, and it made science fun for those of us ignoramuses who just weren't science-oriented.<br /><br />The beauty of a show like MacGyver was that there were endless possibilities for storylines. I recall a particularly exciting episode in which Mac was employed to break into a hi-tech building in order to test out the new central, sentient computer system. He got in, but then could not get out again when the computer went haywire and tried to kill him for real.<br /><br />In total contrast there was an episode in the same vein as the Harrison Ford film \\"Witness\\", where he is injured and finds himself recuperating in a small Amish community.<br /><br />Unlike so many shows at the moment that are restricted in their plots and end recycling the same monotonous drivel over and over, MacGyver encompassed such a broad range of subjects that, for me at least, the show never lost interest.<br /><br />It is a relief to know that someone has finally seen fit to put at least the first season on DVD. As I said before, I hope it will be available in Australia as well as the US, and hopefully the other seasons will also be released in time.t, for me at least, the show never lost interest. <br />It is a relief to know that someone has finally seen fit to put at least the first season on DVD.

B00000AFDW|3.0|Kiss has everything a band can ask for. Loyal fans, great producers to work with, outstanding stage presence and an over the top show that is second to none. They lack the ablity to write great songs or play with any musical talent... this record is no different. This was the last studio record from Kiss, although they have been touring for the last 7 years since its release.   As for this cd, it has its moments. The title track might be one of the best Kiss songs to date. Within', and We Are One are also great tracks. Dreamin' is a complete rip off of Alice Coopers \\"I'm 18\\" Into the Void, I Pledge Allegiance to the State of Rock and Roll and I Finally Found My Way are just plain bad. Skip those tracks at all cost. If you can get this cd cheap, go for it. If your a Kiss nut, I'm sure you have it already.
B00004Y7SF|5.0|What a fantastic album! Her voice sounds beautiful & the music is very soulful. My favs are \\"The Christmas Song\\", \\"Have yourself a merry little christmas\\" & \\"These are the special times\\".  It would've been a crime had she not released a christmas album, especially since it's that time of year again & it's time to put it on heavy rotation again on my stereo.It's a great album to listen to while decorating the tree. Christina will definitely go down in history as one of the greatest vocalists of all time. She can do so many things with those pipes. She's not at all in the same category as her musical peers, she's light years ahead of them because she can do something they can't do: grab a mic, stand under a spotlight & blow away an entire room of people with just her singing & that alone, but it doesn't hurt that she's pretty, sexy & has a fun fashion sense!
0446310786|5.0|This book i found quite compelling.  It was an easy read, but made your mind wonder to far off places.  Harper Lee illustrates each moment so tediously that you find you yourself become apart of the adventures with Scout, Jem, Atticus, Dill, and Boo Radley.  YOu feel for the characters as if they were really special to you.  I would recommend this book for someone who definitely knows they can understand this book, for there is far deeper meaning within itself.  It also  reviews black racism in an interesting way.   <br />    Atticus is a lawyer and father to Jem and Scout.  The town of Maycomb assigns him to defend an African American.  You see what happens to this upper class family through the stages of this task.  You are shown what happens between the towns people and this family and how many of them become dynamic characters.  Changing their views and beliefs. <br />   Would reccomend this to anyone who is a good reader and has a little interest in historical fiction.
B000023VR6|4.0|Im a huge dre fan and diz album is tight except for the song em is in it coz i realy do not like feminem at all. Anyways,Th rest  of the album is tight with tight production and lirycs which is amazing. Dr. Dre's \\"2001\\" is hott & should be in your collection. F*ck feminem tho...
B0001DI0FI|4.0|I finally got a chance to see this movie and I was not disappointed. I was unfamiliar with the source novels (Patrick O'Brian's novels) but it didn't matter much. This is a movie that takes you back to the days of Captain Blood or the Sea Hawk. <br />Finely made in every way (10 Oscar nominations), Russel Crowe is terrific in the part of Capt. Jack Aubrey and Paul Bettany is great as his friend and alter ego Dr. Stephen Maturin. Kudos especially go to Max Pirkis in the role of the very young midshipman Blakeney. This is not a movie with a message but one  made for entertainment's sake and it does that on a grand level. <br />Highly recommended!!
B000050FEN|4.0|This film is a sinister tale of a  serial killer, seeking retribution on the sinners of the world, it is set in a city that looks like New York but it never tells you if it is or not but I expect it is, in the midst of the dirt and scum covered streets there is a killer on the loose played miraculously and brilliantly by Kevin Spacey, the cops Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman play the guys on his tail but he always stays a couple of steps ahead, it ends in horror and devestating tension, it is a classic but the darkness of everything in it is too unrealistic for me so it loses a star for that, but in terms of  creating a scene by establishng sinister moods that you couldn't even dream of it is a  master and I do love it so. Don't sin
B00005JNEI|4.0|I liked this movie a lot. Not because it was the greatest documentary ever, or that it was the most accurate: I liked it because it showed how free we really are in this country. We can call the president of our country a stupid liar and subtly play the guitar riff from \\"Cocaine\\" in the background while Mr. Moore's narrative spoke of what G.W. Bush was doing during the seventies. There are many nations where this would have gotten Mr. Moore into a great bit of trouble.     I think Mr. Moore's methods are relatively sound in that he shoots from the hip and aims for the heart. Was everything in this movie 100 percent accurate? No. Was this a piece of propaganda? Yes. But at the same time it was propaganda, it dared to ask questions that not many people in the media are prepared to ask. Is the war in Iraq just? Was there another way out? Is everything being done to keep our troops safe? What is the real cost of the war?     There were some amazingly powerful moments in Fahrenheit 9/11. Lila Lipscomb, the mother of an American Soldier who died in Iraq , reading her son's last letter to her. Lipscomb herself was the person who encouraged her son to join the military. Also very powerful was Mr. Moore's showing of the similarities between his run-down hometown of Flint Michigan and comparing them to pictures of post-battle/bomb Iraq.     There were many parts in this film that I thought were appalling, but more than the rampant corruption in the government (which is almost par for the course these days. .) were the lies that the Marine recruiters told the people they encountered. Telling a sixteen year old that the Marines could set him up with a career in music, or getting complete contact information from on boy so they could \\"take [him] off our list\\" is simply wrong. That is sick. That in itself sets in people's mind, from the start, that these are people who should not be trusted, and that is not an example of the integrity that has been a beacon of the Armed Forces.My only real complaint in this is the fact that many people see everything Michael Moore does as truth and not a hyperbolic representation of the facts. There are even more, who lean toward the right, who see him as a liberal poster-child of anyone left of center. I know this in not Mr. Moore's intention, but it is a side-effect.     In my mind, this movie accomplished some things. It showed that people who are liberal still love the United States . A consistent theme in the wake of September 11, 2001 was that people who question the government are traitors and that most of those who did the questioning were liberal. This film showed people who love their country enough to encourage their children to enlist in the services, and still love their country after their child was killed. It also set a precedent that we are again allowed to question the leadership of the country.
B00003CXCT|5.0|this is the box with the best trilogy EVER!!! (yeah, a LOT better then LOTcrap) The acting is great. The sfx are even now still very good. And the sound/music is briljant, best soundtracks even.
B0002VKZL6|4.0|Three albums in 4 years - equivalent to his output for the eleven year period between Brothers in Arms and Golden Heart. Not Bad. But what do we have to show for it? As it turns out, a reasonable amount. I was expecting more of Mark Knopfler's country-inflected musings on this album, but was pleasantly surprised to find that a move out of Nashville-based studios shows in the music. It sure is slow going - Knopfler could not get more low-key than this without inviting his brother David around to write the next batch of songs for him. What interests me about this album is how rarely Knopfler now writes in a minor key - all his classics to date (including Telegraph Road, Sultans, Tunnel of Love, On Every Street) were minor-key epics. Now he seems less concerned with twanging heartstrings than crafting intellectually stimulating, well crafted melodies and riffs (the David Mamet of pop music?). For all that, there is always something on a Knopfler album to satisfy, and for me this came in the \\"The Trawlerman's Song\\" and \\"Don't Crash the Ambulance\\" both of which deliver surprising musical balms on repeated listening. Good thing Knopfler seems immune to criticism from those expecting him to reprise Dire Straits' rock-hero indulgences. As he wrote more than two decades ago \\"He put down his load where he thought it was the best..\\" If that turns out to be Shangri-La studios in Malibu watching the afternoon go by, that's fine by me.
B0000844IT|4.0|Army of Darkness includes the original theatrical release and the director's cut on two seperate discs. The theatrical disc includes a documentary on the making of the special effects, while the directors cut has some deleted scenes and commentary with Sam Raimi and Bruce Campbell. <br /> <br />No complaints about the theatrical release. Classic Army of Darkness. <br /> <br />The Director's cut disc has problems though. Almost every time it cuts to scenes not in the theatrical cut, the picture gets muddy. The deleted scenes are also very muddy. Strange, considering some of these scenes are actually shown in fairly crisp form when the movie is shown on TV. There's really no reason for this disc to get as muddy as it does. The commentary, though, is great. <br /> <br />If you're just looking to own a copy of Army of Darkness, save a few bucks and just get the theatrical release. If you REALLY like the movie, and want to know whats in the director's cut, then get this, since it isn't TOO much more than the normal theatrical release. <br /> <br /> <br />I was expecting a lot more extras than there were, too. Oh well. I got the movie, that's what counts.
B0002XH9Z4|1.0|It is a shame to hear the same old recycled music in a different package. I was not very impressed. After Quincy Jones left the music has gotten very stale. I hope that Michael takes some time to work on something new as it is very unfair to fans to continuously put together \\"greatest hits\\" packages. Perhaps he could use his latest misfortunes in life to catalyst some great music in the near future.
B0001I55OC|2.0|This movie is just flat. There's nothing here to really entertain that hasn't been done before. The storyline flows rather awkwardly, and the acting is wretched.  <br /> <br />Sure, the book wasn't SPECTACULAR, but it was at least entertaining, exciting, and still somewhat original. This movie isn't any of those. It's not so bad that I regret seeing it(hence 2 stars), and I wouldn't shrink away from ever having to see it again, but I certainly wouldn't pay money for it.
0743243307|5.0|I do a lot of reading, and this was the best novel I've read in the last year.  Ali has an amazing imagination, a keen eye for character and human nature, and a wonderful sense of humor.  Her sense of language is lyrical and magical.      I loved how the details of London streetlife are colored by Nazneen's (the main character) lack of experience with the modern world.  The details progress as she becomes accustomed to her adopted city.  And unlike the stereotypical immigrant wife, she's not some helpless victim, she applies her power through the ways afforded to her; subtle, not-so-subtle, and sometimes passive-aggressively, just like in real life.     The work spills over with such subjects as assimilation, the patriarchal use of religious faith as a cudgel against women (of course, this could be true of any organized religion), global economic inequities, the post-9-11 world for Muslims, and incisive observations of what it means to be a human being.  It's a heady mix that sometimes feels like too much but I couldn't put the book down; I became engrossed in Nazneen's plight through  vivid language and Ali's fearless and intuitive storytelling.      Where Zadie Smith's \\"White Teeth\\" never reaches the full promise of its first few chapters, I feel that Ali channels the energy of the book successfully from beginning to end. There were some places where the conflict between the characters felt glossed over, but overall I think this is great work that will stand the test of time.
1592400876|4.0|While I could do without Lynne Truss' rather long passages describing the history of each component of punctuation (e.g., the evolution of the apostrophe over time), her presentation of correct usage is crystal clear.  Never have the rules of usage and their corresponding examples seemed so obvious.  Credit for that triumph goes to Ms. Truss, who has given considerable thought to the pithy categorizations and relevant examples that comprise the backbone of her work.<br /><br />Two wonderful features of the book are:<br /><br />&#62; Examples of bad punctuation pulled from popular culture, the best example being (ahem) an amazon reader review.<br /><br />&#62; Passages repeated verbatim that imply a 180-degree different meaning the second time around simply by dint of using different punctuation.  Magical stuff.
B00005JMAH|5.0|Conventional wisdom has always been that the sequel is never as good as the original, however in recent years several movie franchises have rocked and even outright bucked this theory. First there was the appalling `Phantom Menace' that was followed by the not-quite-as-bad `Attack of the Clones.'<br />Then there was the excellent `Fellowship of the Ring' that was followed by the even better `The Two Towers' and then the academy award winning `Return of the King.' This past summer we also saw that `Spiderman 2' was leagues better than its blockbuster predecessor.<br />Yet there is another franchise that seems to also be improving as evidenced by this year's `Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban.' The movie handily bested both 2001's `Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone' and the following year's `Chamber of Secrets' in both sheer invention and ingenuity - not to mention special effects, acting and nearly every other department.<br />What can explain this welcome trend of ever improving entries? In all the cases mentioned above the fact was that the initial entry had to set the stage for the following pictures. In `Phantom Menace' we had the origins of Anakin Skywalker to introduce and in the `Lord of the Rings' series the filmakers had to set up the history to the ring and start the hobbit's journey. Similarly in 2002's `Spiderman' director Sam Raimi was obliged to explain how Peter Parker came to gain his powers. A similar fate befell the first Harry Potter - both when J.K. Rowling wrote the book and director Christopher Columbus made the movie.<br />Some feared that the third installment would paint a darker and more foreboding picture of Harry's time at Hogwart's following Columbus' departure from the director's chair (he did stay on as a producer) in favor of Alfonso Cuar&oacute;n. Well, the movie is darker and more foreboding, and better for it. The story suits the directing style of Cuar&oacute;n and his presence elevates the movie to the very top of the Harry Potter canon.<br />As the title suggests this installment features the escape of a prisoner from Azkaban - the supposidly villainous Sirius Black (played wonderfully by Gary Oldman). It is feared that Black is out to exact a revenge on Harry Potter.<br />This movie is full of visual delights and the dark tone is a welcome addition. I also liked the time plot device towards the end of the movie (to say anymore would spoil much of the surprise).<br />As with the previous two DVD releases many of the special features are a little too juvenile for adult collectors, but we are treated to some interesting (and informative) interviews with the cast and crew (and Harry Potter creator Rowling) as well as deleted scenes. It would have been a welcome addition to have Cuar&oacute;n provide a commentary however.<br />Fans should note that this DVD is also available in a special three-movie-pack with all three movies in widescreen. Whichever selection you make you will not be dissapointed.tle suggests this installment features the escape of a prisoner from Azkaban - the supposidly villainous Sirius Black (played wonderfully by Gary Oldman).

B000669GAI|5.0|I can be seen grinning like a moron at just the FACT of this hits album.  They continue to be one of (if not THE) smartest, most talented, most lovable bands playing today.  Every song here is a gem, but of course, to a fan(atic) like me, every song they've ever recorded is priceless.  I'm soooooo happy!!!!!!!  I think I'm gonna puke.  ;-)
B000000OAA|4.0|I must admit this album grew on me over time.  Yet it was impossible for it not to, from the strength and power of the composition and the raw energy delivered in just the right places.  You have crazed, frenzied rock and power belting and a few tears as well.  Queen always takes us on a journey, and this album is no exception. <br />\\"Brighton Rock\\" can only be called one of Brian May's greatest achievements, a masterpiece which allowed him to showcase his true genius.  \\"Killer Queen\\" is one of the best-known songs by the band, and for good reason.  The mark of a truly great piece of music is the listener's ability to forget the silliness of the lyrics and just get lost in the song.  \\"Dear Friends\\" is a brief, plaintive heartbreaker.  \\"Stone Cold Crazy\\" will allow you to become just that for a few minutes.  \\"Now I'm Here\\" became a great favorite among concert crowds, with Freddie and a body double appearing in turn at opposite ends of the stage when the lyrics called for it.    And \\"In The Lap of the Gods Revisited\\" gives me chills every time I hear it, and is great for those times when I just feel like belting my lungs out.  But not as well as Freddie.  No one could do it like him. <br />This is not to say that I don't believe there are flaws.  \\"Misfire\\", \\"She Makes Me\\" and \\"Tenement Funster\\" strike me as the filler business found on so many albums in general, not just in the case of Queen.  They could be worse but they could also be a heck of a lot better.  I skip them every time (though sometimes I listen to \\"She Makes Me\\" just to hear Brian). <br />Listen to the reviews that tell you to start with better-known works if you're not a seasoned pro at this.  Buy Greatest Hits.  And if you're hooked and want to delve deeper, start here or at least at one of the first three albums.  See where the band started and just how ahead of the game they were even at such an early stage.  No wonder they went so far.
B0002F6BRE|1.0|Let me start this off by saying, I dont feel the need to post reviews normally but had to in this case.  While I love the classics like \\"Frosty the Snowman\\",\\"Rudolph the Red nosed Reindeer\\" and \\"Santa Claus is Coming to Town\\", the movie \\"Elf\\" is no classic.  This is perhaps the biggest waste of time one could have.  I can honestly say I have lost all respect for Will Ferrell after seeing this movie and one must question James Caan's ability to judge a good script.  The lone bright spot in the whole movie was the acting and actual singing by Zooey Deschanel who has a great voice. I expect her to have a good film career in spite of making this bomb of a movie.  To be sure, I love Christmas movies as much as anyone and picked this up thinking it would be a good start to the holiday season. I WAS WRONG. This movie is one of the worst I have ever seen.  I am shocked that a studio actually spent good money to make this film.  If you thought Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez' movie \\"Gigli\\" was a bomb this movie may actually be worse. In fact if you said for 1 million dollars name 5 movies I have seen in my life that are worse, I am not sure I could.  In short, dont waste your money.  If you are a sadist and want to punish yourself, your spouse and your family, rent it.  At least you can bring it back to Blockbuster if you decide to shut it off. It was so bad that I started to think I should have addressed that 95 minute root canal visit to the dentist that is overdue.  Yes friends it was that bad.

B00005JMEW|5.0|EVerything about this movie is what you'd expect from Quentin. It is comparable to his classic Reservoir Dogs in innovation, style and his innate ability to pick up on popular culture conciousness and take it to the next level. If this homage to 1970s, King Fu doesn't get to you then you just don't like Quentin. The end fight scene is better than any I've seen in action/fantasy, Kung Fu with swords based in the Orient.
0385508417|4.0|I just got finished reading this book and what a quick read it was.<br /><br />My only objection would be the changing of the cover...I got the new cover w/Jaime Lee Curtis and Tim Allen from the movie, so as I read, I could completely see them in those roles :-)<br /><br />My family has decided to \\"downsize\\" Christmas this year and just do \\"stocking stuffers.\\"  The reason?  Christmas is for family and that's what's important.  I think this book catches some of that, even if the motives aren't always the purist.<br /><br />It's about family and friends and being together...
B000068FY1|5.0|This is some good, warm, down-home country-folk-rock.  It's not boundary-pushing like Uncle Tupelo's early work, and it never raises its musical voice to a shout.  It's a lot like Neil Young's \\"Zuma\\" record in my mind, and I'm sure there are other comparisons that would work as well.  In fact, from the moment you put it on your stereo, it will sound like something you've heard before.  But that familiarity is not a bad thing.  It's kind of a comfort-food album for me, and one I tend to reach for when I'm not doing the best.  It's got that simple, home-spun profundity that their later work seems to lack.  I'd recommend it to someone who is already a fan of alt-country music, and is looking to broaden their horizons a bit.  Classic stuff, if you're open to it.
1591840562|5.0|Guy's 'get to the critical issues' approach and his self-deprecating style make this an easy yet immensely valuable read to anyone starting a business. His 10/20/30 rule for making sales pitches and his insights on just getting going would benefit any entrepreneur. A highly recommended read - you'll feel good about things you're doing right, and be able to address things you're doing wrong quickly and practically.
B00006F7S4|5.0|\\"Beck is bummed\\" states the Amazon reviewer in introduction to \\"Sea Change,\\" and the picture of a depressed Beck in painted below by many reviewers who caution the listener to avoid this or risk severe depression.  Well, I don't see it that way, and I think you should take these comments with a grain of salt- or a salt shaker.  In the tradition of classic country and blues songwriters from the past, Beck is harnessing the power of music to turn a tragedy in his personal life into something better, something powerful and uplifting.  This album is poetic in the sense that Hank Williams was poetic.  \\"Your Cheatin' Heart\\" is depressing if you really want to think about it, but it's also an expression of a man's frustration with his current romantic situation, and a catharsis to move on to bigger and better things.  I think of Beck as a modern-day Hank Williams, a real troubadour baring his soul so that he, and the rest of us, can empathize, feel something, and then go on to make the most of our lives.<br /><br />I discovered this album at a time when I was missing somebody who had left my life, and coming to terms with the fact that she and I would not be together.  This album made it feel OK to wallow a bit, to miss someone, but inspired me to move on, which I did.  I know that the album wouldn't have had the same impact on me if I hadn't been feeling this way.  But we all go through this at some point or other, and that's why we have albums like this.  It's not here to make you shake your can, and if that's what you're looking for, go dig out your old copy of \\"midnite vultures.\\"  This album is here to help you think, to help you breathe.  It's lush and rich and deep.  Take advantage of this chance to have  a real experience through music.
B0001Z52RU|3.0|This is a fairly original movie that has several flaws but much to go for it as well. the story of Evan (Ashton Kutcher), a psychology student who discovers the ability to change events in the past, obscured by blackouts but revealed by reading his childhood journals is an entertaining, convincing plot with several interesting incarnations. Just as a butterfly flapping its wings in China is meant to set of a chain of results that leads to a hurricane in Florida, the movie explores the counterfactuals that can result from changing one event in history.<br /><br />Of course, this central premise (the dangers of changing history) is not original, but the movie is saved from cliche by several aspects. Firstly the ways in which the different characters are affected are complicated, varied, realistic and require some sharply changing acting. For example, the character of Tommy - warped from abuse by his paedophile father (played by Eric Stoltz) turns into, at various times, a psychopath and a born again Christian.<br /><br />The themes are disturbing and often taboo- e.g paedophilia and prostitution - it seems director Eric Bess wanted the movie to have a disturbing, frightening tone. Generally this works and the actors play their parts with sinister realism. This is helped by using different actors to play the main characters as children, teenagers and adults respectively. The best example is Jesse James playing the teenage Tommy with sadistic hatred. Stoltz is convincing as the twisted father and Andy Smart deals with the different situations Kayleigh, Evan's childhood friend whom he has a lifelong crush on, finds herself in with commendable chameleon skill. The main problem is Kutcher himself. He is not laughably awful as some critics described him. It is just that he frequently lapses into laughably over the top ham acting with a half silly expression on his face that threatens to drag the film into the realms of black comedy. Essentially, he is a goofy comic actor who makes a commendable but inadequate stab at a complex, serious role.<br /><br />I have other quibbles with the movie as well. The ending - a sort of disturbing antithesis to the message of 'It's a Wonderful Life' is pretty underwhelming and left me feeling that the central message of the film - that changing history has reckless consequences - had turned into a rather bleak and pointless message of the futility of Evan's entire life.<br /><br />But don't let this put you off. Many critics hated this film. It is true that minor details leave a lot to be desired. But the general tone is haunting, tense and packed with nervous energy and some good cinematography. The viewer constantly is on edge, wondering how the butterfly effect will take its next turn.endable but inadequate stab at a complex, serious role.     I have other quibbles with the movie as well.

1559408855|5.0|Salo, superficially an art house film for hormonal frat boys, is one of the finest works of the modernist era and of the past century. The main virtue and justification of Salo lies in its profound and moving portrayal of the relationship that binds victim and victimizer, and also in the poetic and perceptive description of the Italy of the 1970s.  <br />Pasolini's film will be hated by many, which is a lot to say for a film in the current era of shallow yet entertaining cinema. There will be the usual grumbling about morality in film, yet his credo is that there is freedom and safety in sentences, and language replaces the life. He' s playing the one note he knows.  <br />The film represents an era of saccharine cinema that began in the 1970s. We are force fed fecal matter inside theatres, much like many of the denizens of Salo are. Salo, Mussolini's puppet state in northern Italy at the end of the Second World War, was a fascist, much like today's film studios are fascists who refuse to air films that explore deeper human emotions than humor at flatulation jokes and blue humor.  <br />
B00003CXA2|2.0|This is the sort of movie that people rush to embrace with unconditional acclaim as it covers big, simple themes - small town underdog comes good, pursues lifelong childhood sweetheart, has an engagingly simple view of complex affairs, wraps up several huge incidents of late 20th Century history in nice bite sized chunks etc...<br /><br />And it is a tearjerker. That is what clinches it for most people. It does all of the above, and is heartwarming as well. So they get this DVD and sit down with loved ones on a Saturday evening with a large bucket of ice cream and let it all wash over.<br /><br />All of this is fine, but I merely wish to use this forum to express my reservations with the central plot. This is a movie that traces the life of one man. We are asked to feel sorry for this man, sympathise with him, love him and root for him all the way to come good in the end. Personally, I never felt this with Forrest. Basically, he accomplishes too much too easily. He is born half crippled but instantaneously shakes off his crutches to run away from bullies, he is an unwitting Vietnam War hero, he inspires John Lennon to write 'Imagine', he meets and charms three US Presidents, he becomes a shrimp millionaire after a storm wipes out the rest of the industry and, yes, he gets the girl in the end. All of this is accomplished with relative ease. Where is the adversity? Why should we care, deep down for this man? It is touched on. There are several sensitive moments during the movie, such as when Forrest crumbles into tears on discovering that he has an illegitimate son. But these need to be developed far more fully to turn him into a developed hero. As the movie stands, he is more annoying than heroic. Imagine a kid at school who has no apparent ability but sails through life achieving almost anything. Is that a great story? No, it's a tremendously baffling annoyance.<br /><br />There are heroes in the story, but they are the supporting characters to Forrest rather than Forrest himself. Gary Sinise as the legless Vietnam veteran is pretty funny as he goes through various stages of denial and alcoholism before coming to terms with his condition. And Jenny, his sweetheart suffers the tribulations of the last decades of the 20th Century far more realistically than Forrest. She does not sail through every problem but suffers emotionally and physically from the batterings that life throws at her.<br /><br />I am all for huge sentimental, zeitgeist type movies that tell a heartwarming story of a young man who comes good in the end. But I want to care for the character and root for him to the ends of the earth. I just couldn't do this with Forrest.than Forrest himself.

B00003CX9E|2.0|Yes, how bourgeiosie to love this film! \\"BAAAH,\\" says a gullible American public. It is probably otiose to recommend, in reviews or in conversation, a film that is a classic, especially one so waywardly eccentric as this one. It is true that a taste for Citizen Kane must be acquired and that a comparative few will find it worth acquiring.<br /><br />The American Film Institute made this film the #1 film of all time. Why? An incestuous and sychophantic group of directors, screenwriters, actors, actresses, and producers, a largely insulated and undereducated lot, have perpetuated a myth of \\"brilliance\\" around this film. Given the high expectations around the film, it necessarily must attain a higher status than would otherwise be expected.
0316776963|5.0|I had heard so much about David Sedaris that I had to go out and grab a copy of \\"Me Talk Pretty One Day\\" to see what all the hype and kudos was about. I found my answer in no time. As soon as I got into the book, I was chuckling with laughter and wincing with fascination. Sedaris has to have led one of the funniest, most bizarre lives Ive ever heard of. His father's over-zealous attempts to foster a talent in each of his children (in spite of their glaring lack of talent in any of the fields he respectively assigned them) is a source of much laughter in the book. David's encounters with his midget guitar teacher had me on the floor, gasping for breath from laughter. But I think the story that stood out for me the most is \\"You cant kill the rooster\\" about Sedaris's foul-mouthed, monosyllabic, rap-loving brother....that one's a real hoot, I read it and re-read it!!  <br /> <br />Actually, there were so many good stories that its hard to choose a favorite. I love \\"Twelve moments in the life of the artist\\" about Sedaris' phase of amphetamine addiction...his trips on speed are hilarious. Then there's the one after which the book is titled, which chronicles Sedaris' struggle with the French language while residing in Paris. Generally, the first half of the book is better than the second, but overall a really great read....very entertaining, and in my opinion, very endearing as well. Sedaris writes about his human foibles with no shame, there is a loveable honesty in his work, plus he manages to draw humour out of the most mundane of events. Something about him reminds me of Henry Miller, maybe the story called \\"Big Boy\\" about a giant turd swimming in his friend's loo.....very reminiscent of the famous turd scene in \\"Tropic of Cancer.\\"  <br /> <br />And while Im rambling on about the book, I just have to mention the opening story (entitled \\"Go Carolina\\") about Sedaris's attempts to avoid any word with \\"s\\" so as to evade the trauma dished out on him by his speech therapistwhenever he lisps. Hilarious !! At one point, teh therapist asked him what his family generally does on New Year's eve, and he replied \\"on the final day of the year we take down the pine tree in our living room and eat marine life\\" to avoid saying \\"seafood.\\" Haaaaaaaaaaa!! Go get your copy readers, this book's a keeper !!

B0002XH9Z4|5.0|Now, I have all of Michael Jackson's albums (that I can get my hands on). And this box set is unbelievable.  There are songs on here I have never heard of, and I'm glad that I have it to listen too, cause they are just fantabulous. This is an early X-mas present to myself.  If you are a big MJ fan than this is definitly worth the money spent.  And if you still don't know by now who this man is other than what you see and hear on TV than you need to get out of the dark and buy this album.
B000002G7E|5.0|I have, with a few notable exceptions, found that when I play this album, everyone in the room tells me it is the biggest piece of crap they have ever heard.  Granted most of them consider Limp Bizkit to be the greatest rock and roll band of all time, and this doesn't serve as the best background music, but this is one of the few times I feel genuinely pretensious about my musical tastes.  No one I know likes this but me.   <br /> <br />To me, this is where alternative rock really starts.  Yeah, there debut was great, but the VU and Nico lacks the sustained intensity that I hear when I think of punk, hardcore and alternative acts who have been influenced by this album.  The album opens with a shocking drug song that still manages to pack a punch even though the album was recorded in 1967.  It features Lou Reeds trademark vocals in a pre Beatles style that works perfectly in a juxtaopsition with the overall sound of the song and the subject matter.  \\"Ohhhhh, White Heat\\" is the perfect counterpoint to the chugging guitar riff and lyrics about amphetimines.  The Gift is a very bizzare spoken word story over a sludgy bass and fractured guitar.  The \\"awwww\\" after \\"she needed him, and he wasn't there\\" is completely hilarious.  Lady Godivas Operation is a strange take on a classic fairytale and Here She Comes Now is the one quiet song on the album. <br /> <br />After those four songs, The Velvets launch into complete sensory overload.  I Heard Her Call My Name is a free jazz implosion with demented lyrics and a fractured, burning guitar riff from Reed and Sterling Morrison.  If your exhausted from the last song, Sister Ray will blow you away.  A 17 minute magnum opus about sex, drugs, and every activity that can make you go to hell featuring a noisy blurred organ from John Cale, guitars that sounds like broken glass from Reed and Morrison, and a primal drum beat from Maureen Tucker.  This is one of the greatest epics, not to mention one of the greatest songs ever recorded.It's like The End, but with the complete oposite effect.   <br /> <br />This is a truly maverick recording from one of the greatest bands ever.  This is definitley not for the VU neophyte.  But if you like noise rock like The Jesus and Mary Chain, Sonic Youth, or The Stooges, then give this a try.  It requires some effort but it is very rewarding.  It is in my top ten albums of all time.
0684808323|4.0|In the Desert of Las Vegas Nevada is where a lot of the problems of the heads of the Stardust casino are solved.  The bright lights of Las Vegas do not shield the darkness of the desert surrounding it.  In the novel Casino Nicholas Pileggi delves deep into the lives of the shady side of Las Vegas and the people who run it. The protagonist Frank AKA Lefty Rosenthal makes sure the readers understand that if you love someone you have to trust them with your life, with everything that you have because if you don't than what is the point of being in love.  But Nicholas Pileggi puts in his own underlying message of in the life of a mobster you cannot trust anyone including your best friend and your wife. This book is full of non stop action and suspense. It gives you an inside look at the lives of the mobsters that made las vegas famous. I highly suggest readin Casino by Nicholas Pileggi.

B0006AZMFM|3.0|Well she's done it again. The talented 20-year old Delta has returned with her follow up album to the hugely successful (at least in Australia and somewhat in the UK) Innocent Eyes. I got a feeling this one is gonna be on the charts for a long time to come. <br /> <br />With new collaborators and plenty of new experiences to draw upon (a tumultuous year battling with cancer and living with a new relationship), Mistaken Identity is definitely a more grown up, sophisticated and somewhat darker album. <br /> <br />Unlike the other innumerable pop starlets littering the music landscape, Delta has a hand in writing all of her music and you can tell these songs mean something. While not the most powerful voice in the industry, it's still quite amazing and listenable and like her material, has matured with this new record. As an aside, to all the Britneys out there, this girl doesn't need to resort to lip synching (or thong flashing) to entertain. You gotta give her kudos for that. <br /> <br />AS for the album (which is what we're here for!), to be honest I wasn't blown away. I felt that Innocent Eyes was more consistent in delivering enjoyable tunes (that you'd want to listen to again and again), one after the other. Largely piano-driven (like its predecessor), Mistaken Identity has a number of GREAT tunes, but a couple of not-so-great ones which kinda brings it down overall (ie. Disorientated, not too fussed and Almost Here, a duet with Brit'popper Brian McFadden - worst Delta song ever and not worthy of being on the album). Stand out tracks for me include: <br /> <br />* Be Strong - beautiful and inspirational <br />* Electric Storm - very moody <br />* Sanctuary - all around enjoyable <br />* Last Night on Earth - great power ballad <br />* Fragile - downtempo and haunting <br />* You Are My Rock <br /> <br />You cannot go wrong with this album. If you're a fan of Delta, you should already own it. If you're new to her, you need to own it (and of course Innocent Eyes).If you're looking for quality and real talent, you should get your hands on it.  <br /> <br />It was a tough decision but I rate this as 3 out of 5 (I would have given Innocent Eyes 3.5 our of 5). 5 is perfection, 4 is near-perfection and I don't think Delta has yet delivered an album of either of those standards, but she is well on her way and I'll be behind her all the way.  <br /> <br />PS: I really, really do love you Britney.
B000002UB3|4.0|I like this album because it has some of their weirder songs. I like this malbum but not as good as MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR.
B00000258J|5.0|\\"Hard Again\\" is one of Muddy's greatest works. This album is one of several that is produced by Johnny Winter and features Johnny on the guitar and James Cotton on the harp. The opening song \\"Mannish Boy\\" is packed with that great swagger that i always loved about him and Johnny howls in the backround. The best tracks are \\"Mannish Boy\\", \\"Bus Driver\\" and \\"I Can't Be Satisfied\\". \\"I can't be satisfied\\" has Winter doing some impressive guitar solos on his steel-bodied National guitar. \\"The Blues Had A Baby....\\" is also another impressive song with Muddy telling is version of the story of Rock and Roll. <br />This is a must have in your blues collection.

B0002Z9HT8|5.0|You must buy this DVD set, here's why:<br /><br />First of all, there are people starving in Africa, and you will be helping them.  'nuf said about that.<br /><br />But what were they thinking when they priced this set?  $28. for 4 discs of this unbelieveably important historical presentation?  I would have paid $100.  This is GROSSLY underpriced.  The video quality is better than I expected considering the age of the production and the fact that it was never supposed to be recorded in the first place.<br /><br />Yes, there are performances missing from this set.  The booklet inside explains why -- from technical glitches (generator exploded) to lost/missing reels.  But who cares?  There are 10 hours worth of phenominal performances in this set!<br /><br />Suspiciously missing is backstage footage, interviews, follow-up interviews all these years later (where's Sir Bob's take on this whole thing?), etc.  I hope there will be a 20th Anniversary Platinum Edition or something like that with more stuff.<br /><br />Meanwhile, BUY THIS SET, you'll be very glad you did!
B000669GAI|5.0|Being a fan of Pearl Jam since the beginning, I always figured it would be impossible to make a Best-Of album, simply because I love every one of their songs.  How do you choose between Oceans and Once?  Or Long Road and I Got ID?  Luckily for me, both songs from the &quot;Singles&quot; soundtrack, Breath (my all-time favourite) and State Of Love and Trust, were included on the album.  <br />Regardless of what was left off the album, what was included is a perfect depiction of a rock/alternative band who consistantly produced songs that both defined an era of rock, and yet successfully changed their sound slightly with each album.  What we are left with is 33 tracks (three or four from each album, including singles) that flow brilliantly while Pearl Jam's sound progressed from &quot;Grunge&quot; to rock and finally to a combination of sounds (Binaural's contrasting sounds of Nothing As It Seems and Insignificance).  <br />The burning question is: If I already own all of Pearl Jam's albums and can sing every song they have made, why would I buy this album?  The answer is simple: Imagine listening to a remastered version of Alive, followed by Even Flow, Jeremy, State of Love and Trust, Animal, Go, Dissident, Rearviewmirror, Spin the Black circle, Corduroy, Not For You, I Got ID, Hail Hail, Do The Evolution, and Save You, without having to change CD's; just sitting back and listening to the eclectic (yet placed in perfect order) mix of Pearl Jam songs.<br />I recommend this album to any life-long Pearl Jam fan, and even those who only know popular singles such as Jeremy, Even Flow, and Alive: you're in for a treat.
B0002Y4T92|5.0|Heavy Caliber and this is an unforgetable and awesome event in music history and I would have rate it more than 5 if the part of Jeff Beck , Pat Metheny , and Styx weren't ommited. I have high respect for Eric Clapton but I hope he could provide an explanation on the ommision of other respectable worthy artist. Another thing a lot of people would agree that Steve Vai must play more part as he was a scene stealer and a high octane guitar player as everybody was mezmerised by his performance with his awesome band. Nevertheless as Eric Clapton stated that he was in heaven the whole weekend so what are you waiting for, grab and get a hold of this Dvd.
B0002Z9HT8|2.0|The booklet claims that footage has been misplaced or lost or whatever. However, if you watch the way certain acts are edited it's obvious they had the missing footage, and simply skipped portions of performances instead of including the entire set. Secondly, it is inconceivable that there are no broadcast quality recordings of this entire event available. The notes would make you think assembling this DVD was next to impossible, but c'mon. It was 1985, not 1955. We're not talking about lost kinescopes here. No question, this is a scam to release a more complete set in a few years. All this on top of bland, amateur packaging... Yuck. Save your VHS copies.

What they have done is twisted the Cat Woman myth to make her some type of Egyptian Cat powered herion.

B00003CXCT|2.0|I, like many other SW fans, am struggling to choose, \\"To buy or not to buy, that is the question.\\" Since it's release I have had the Star Wars Trilogy (Widescreen Edition) in my shopping cart no less than 5 times. I saw Star Wars when it first came out at the drive-in when I was fourteen. Today my oldest turns 21 and I still can't get the original version in DVD format, I'll be a grandmother before Lucas is done! If these DVDs were only cleaned up and the sound enhanced, I would have bought them in an instant. Unfortunately, Lucas has other plans for his films. Some have stated that introducing new effects and characters aides in the continuity of the other films, I disagree. In my opinion the \\"Old School\\" look of the original films enhance the experience. So, here I sit holding on dearly to my old VHS originals and waiting for Lucas to remember the fans who fell in love with them and would pay plenty to have them on DVD. Who knows, maybe that is just what he is banking on? O.K. I'm taking the box set out of the shopping cart, or maybe I shouldn't...
B000669GAI|5.0|There is nothing I can say that hasn't already been said about Pearl Jam as one of the seminal bands of the '90's.  This collection is nicely done.  All the great radio hits are here.

B00068IOWM|5.0|I don't know why.  Maybe it's because of Bono being in front of news camera constantly, Bono shaking hands with politicians like George Bush, Bono venturing into a deal to make u2 I-Pods.  Or it might just be my brother is a huge fan.  As for his band, I own a couple of their CDS but I wouldn't call myself a fan.  <br /> <br />Because of my dislike for the frontman, I don't like to admit my love for u2 songs.  But I do love their guitarist the Edge and his unique sound, and he carries this record.  So yes, it is a very strong album.  And yes, u2 will dominate the music world for the next year.  Yes, it will sell millions.  Yes, the tour will be the biggest of 2005.  And Yes...we will all see Bono's face everywhere for awhile to come.   <br /> <br />The best songs on this album are Vertigo, Love and Peace or Else, All Because of You, and Miracle Drug.  Not a surprise that Edge has amazing guitar work in all of them, especially All Because of You.  Really, buy the record just for this track.  I'm a big Stones fan, this is as close as it gets.  He also sings a whole verse by himself on \\"Miracle Drug,\\" pretty cool.   <br /> <br />Rest of the album has good moments as well.  Sometimes You Can't Make it On Your Own is actually pretty good, I wasn't expecting much after that excuse of a ballad called stuck in a moment on their last record.  They hadn't released a great ballad since Stay off Zooropa, which was like back in 1994.  But I think you can put this up there.  Crumbs from Your Table is good, but One Step Closer is the best song off the second half of the record.  Pretty deep track, and while I'm not a big Bono fan, he is a great singer and lyricist.  Here he just goes one on one with death, good stuff.   <br /> <br />Overall, good record.  For the people thinking about buying it, I would recommend it as non-u2 fan.  Don't read reviews like that guy below me who obviously didn't even download the album, he's just doesn't like the band.  At least my opinion is educated.   <br /> <br />I would probably just give it 4/5, but because of that deep sigh of relief after knowing its not another All That Can't Leave Behind adult pop record, I'll give it the 5.  I just burnt that off the net and never listened to it much after that.  This album will be bought and I'm guessing will be in my CD Changer for awhile.  <br />
B00006F83Y|5.0|Queens of the Stone Age mocks Clear Channel and our modern radio format with this release. The power rock style of this album is extremely catchy, and this proves to be a great driving, head-banging album. The riffs to No one knows, God is in the radio, and Song for the dead are some of the catchiest I've heard this decade. I'm especially impressed by Mosquito Song, which completely strays from the power rock style of the entire album, and moves into a symphonic folk rock song about cannibalism.<br /><br />Even though Josh Homme kicked out the bassist and played drums for the (joke) band Eagles of Death Metal, I still expect great things from their upcoming 2005 release.
B0002Z9HT8|5.0|There were a number of critical reviews of this set posted here before the DVDs had been released. This is unfortunate because what is contained in this four DVD set is really enjoyable,is bargain priced ( I picked one up for $20), and has DTS sound to boot. As the liner notes indicate, the US leg of the show was not recorded - the tapes that exist are broadcast tapes courtesy of MTV.  <br /> <br />Do I wish it was all here? Sure I do. I was hoping to see the imptomptu CSN&Y reunion, but it's not here. However, there's so much great stuff here that many of us thought we'd never see again. So, I'm glad I get to see Queen stop the show, see Bowie's goofy hair, see Brian Wilson singing with the Beach Boys, and see and hear everything that is here - the good and the bad. It helps me relive a special event where each hour seemed to hold promise and surprise. <br /> <br />So don't be upset because a tune here or there is missing. Take it for what it is and enjoy.
B0002XDODU|3.0|I liked mutter better than Reise Reise..The songs are to soft and all follow a pattern, they get soft in the beggining then get louder. *shrugs* just my opinion.
B00004TRD8|5.0|James Cameron's (\\"The Terminator\\", \\"The Abyss\\", \\"True Lies\\" and of course \\"Titanic\\", which wasn't THAT good as to win 11 Oscars in 1997 [see my review on it]) excellent sequel to \\"The Terminator\\", which brought him immediate fame, is finally on DVD-and WHAT A DVD IT IS!! PACKED with the ULTIMATE IN SOUND (Digitally Mastered by THX, Dolby Surround EX 5.1 and Dolby Surround DTS 5.1) and picture quality (the widescreen format enhanced for 16X9 TV's) is the ULTIMATE in entertainment. Also the six plus hours of bonus features (deleted scenes, trailers, fascinating featurettes, documentaries, etc.) pulls out ALL the stops on this one.

Arnold, who was almost an unknown at the time, delivers a strong performance as the title character, the unstoppable killing cyborg sent to destroy both Sarah and-I'm not going to spoil it. A killer-perfect performance by Arnold Schwarzenegger (who would rise to fame, along with James Cameron) along with the rest of the cast, the score by Brad Fiedel (who would return to score the next film in the series), the widescreen format (enhanced for 16X9 TV's) and the AWESOME sound mix make this film definitely worth having.<br />Rated PG-13 for violence, language and brief sexuality/nudity.<br /><br />TERMINATOR 3:RISE OF THE MACHINES<br /><br />Arnold Schwarzenegger returns to the role that rocketed him to stardom-and eventually, \\"Governator\\" of California-to defend John Connor (this time played by Nick Stahl) and an old flame (Claire Danes) against a new Terminator-a woman (played with sexy murderous flare by Kristanna Loken (you're HOT, BABY).

1401301363|5.0|Nigella Lawson reinvented the domestic goddess concept and is a far better advertisement than Roseanne.  Why?<br /><br />There is just something about the British (though my one trip to London was unremarkable and often disappointing in a culinary sense) that ought to make you slap them but...ah, the accents!  It's Shakespeare!  It's Diana!  It's toffee and shortbread and plum pudding!<br /><br />Nigella is the English Martha and a country that once ruled half the world under Elizabeth I has way fewer hangups about women in power than we do.<br /><br />DOMESTIC GODDESS was so good I had to flip through this book in the bookstore.  It did not disappoint.  It was nicely located next to the coffee shop in Borders and the sensuality that comes through (in an understated way, not in a Desperate Housewives kinda way) in Nigella was nicely augmented by the aromas of Gingerbread Mochas.  A great addition to your culinary library, right up there with CULINARYTHERAPY.

B0002YLC24|5.0|This film is the perfect love story adding to \\"Before Sunrise\\" filmed in 1994 it takes us through the awkwardness of a love so passionately unrequited. <br /> <br />In 1994 a little film was made entitled \\"Before Sunrise\\" and we met an awkward American boy named Jesse (Ethan Hawke) as he encountered a beautiful exuberant French girl named Celine (Julie Delpy). The original movie took us on a visual journey through Europe starting on a Eurorail and ending with the sunrise in Vienna. The couple agreed to meet in the same place and we were left to wonder what ever happened to this engaging couple and their great banter. Well finally the answer can be found in this updated conversation between Jesse and Celine in of all places, the most romantic city in the world, Paris! Jesse, now a writer, is surprised by Celine during his book signing in Paris. Celine has become an \\"angry activist\\" and she still holds a definite opinion about everything under the sun making for yet another fabulous tte--tte. We follow Celine and Jesse through the streets of Paris, sipping coffee at cafs, strolling along the Seine and passing through gardens of excellence, eventually ending up at Celine's Parisian apartment.....will it ever end? I for one hope not!  <br /> <br />Expect nothing short of brilliance from this simple and straight forward film about a couple re-kindling a flame not ready to die. Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy maintain a fantastic rhythm throughout this film walking through Paris while having a most interesting conversation. Despite its simplicity in actuality the writing is quite sophisticated and now very grown-up. All of the passion and chemistry from the first film remains between the characters here and I imagine a third film will be on the back burner. All of the great romances always end in Paris but we are left again to wonder if Jesse and Celine will really make it after all. Director Richard Linklater has filmed pure poetry against a perfect romantic backdrop andhe will leave you begging for more with or without the sun. <br />
B0002F6BRE|5.0|Hats off to the writer, director, and actors who put this great movie together. Will Ferrell played the role of Buddy the Elf to perfection.  By the end of the movie, I was convinced Ferrell could actually be an ELF!  Okay, maybe that's a bit over the top, but he did do a great job.<br /><br />This movie is good from so many angles.  The set designs were great.  The plot has enough side-stories going on that the movie is very multi-dimensional, a great achievement for any Christmas story.<br /><br />I can't think of a Christmas movie I enjoyed more than this one.<br /><br />James Caan is fantastic as Buddy's biological father.  It was so cool to see James Caan playing a role like this.  He truly is a GREAT actor!  I have always enjoyed watching him on the screen.<br /><br />Bob Newhart performed brilliantly as Papa Elf, Buddy's adopting father. He added charm and sophisticated presence to this film.<br /><br />Edward Asner (even with all of his LEFT-wing views) is great as Santa.  He is a gifted actor!  Great job Ed!  I may not agree with your politics, but I do enjoy your acting.<br /><br />Zooey Deschanel did a magnificent job as Buddy's love interest. I can't picture anyone playing this role any better.<br /><br />Buy this DVD!  It is GREAT entertainment for the whole family!<br /><br />See ya next review!<br /><br />Dan Blankenship<br /><br />author of THE RUNNING GIRL

B000002C1V|5.0|Roger Waters wrote most of his music with the Floyd tormented by the ghosts of his childhood: War, overprotecting mother, abusive teachers, and the death of his father. He showed his brilliance and pain though all those years of deep, dark, genial music. It reached a peak in The Wall and concluded in this album. (Has been said that this was originally the end of the wall, but came too long) But in most of this album You can hear his final catharsis and exorcism of his inner demons. After this album the floyd music never was the same again, and Roger was free. You only need to hear \\"Paranoid eyes\\" and \\"Take your filthy hands of my desert\\" and You will understand.......
B00005V3Z4|4.0|It actually is pretty hard to classify this movie as one thing or another... i suppose drama/sci-fi would probably be the best classification.  Don't be fooled by the movie cover, it's actually a lot better than you'd be led to believe... and I don't consider it to be a horror movie by any means, so disregard the little catch-phrase. <br /> <br />Just to answer many of those who do honestly believe that this movie \\"sux\\" or whatever, I can't tell you that you're opinion's invalid... but personally I really love this movie, and in my books its up there with the likes of fight club.  One of the defining attributes that makes this, what i consider to be, a \\"good\\" movie, is that the viewer isn't force-fed a cut-and-dry series of events.  There is some ambiguity in what goes on in the movie, and that is what I believe drives it in a direction that entices thought and discussion.  The non-sense about how this movie is anti-christian or whatever else is purely based upon that individual's interpretation that Frank was actually a divine messenger or likeness of, but that is by no means the only reasonable possibility.  In any case, the story deals too much with the theme of fate and chance to really be seen as a slug at christianity.  It does however do a good job at poking fun at the 80s and some school-experience jokes... i.e. \\"if there is any vice-presidential candidate worthy of my vote, it has to be Dan Quayle\\", and the love/fear exercise. <br /> <br />I gave this four stars because although it is very good, i think it could've been better... i have yet to see the director's cut and perhaps i would view that as a 5/5.  This movie is very well done, with well-composed music and an enjoyable story. <br /> <br />Anyone who wants to get a \\"preview\\" into what this movie is somewhat like or who has seen it and wants to know a bit more, check out donniedarko.com
B000068MKZ|4.0|I love this album.  Carla Bruni has one of the most delicious and sensual voices I've ever heard.  The songs on this album are little more than that gorgeous voice against the light strumming of her acoustic guitar.  It feels so intimate to listen to, as if she's whispering these songs live right in front of you.  Such a refreshment from much of the new crop of singers who require massive studio production just to get out a good sounding song.  The lyrics are absolutely beautiful as well, like poetry.  Cheers to Carla Bruni, who even as an Italian can sing French in the most beautiful and soft of accents.
B000065K8Z|5.0|God where has the world gone? This was a bloody comedy. Clooney, well, he has always played the layed back character who everyone instantly likes. The other guy, he looked like a bloody nut job (:.<br />Anyways, if you think this was horrifying watch HellRaiser, T1, T2, T3, Once Upon a Time In Mexico had more violence, any of the old fashion vamp movies had more violence. This was a joke, really but it's good.<br />Also, watch a movie called Lost Boys with Keith/Donald Sutherland, that was 70s movie and that had more violence. aying this was bloody and violent is a LAUGH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br />ps. I'm 18 and laughed my head off at this movie. And I am not like the average idiot kid who can't tell the difference between movie and reality.
B0002XDODU|4.0|Rammstein continue to evolve in this their 4th album.  Herzeleid was simple heavy guitar riffs and Till barking.  Sehensucht was a masterful combination of fast paced industrial metal.  Mutter retained the great elements of the first two and brought us the epic sounds full orchestrations including strings and choir.    Reise Reise continues the trend and takes the listener on an epic musical journey.  Big walls of guitar sound, an orchestra, choir, and Tills singing! characterize this album.  While it is not as fast-paced, as its predecessors, it very much succeeds.  Songs like Reise Reise, Morgenstern, and Stein um Stein are big and powerful.  Mein Teil and Keine Lust are more like \\"old\\" Rammstein - heavy and aggressive.  Amerika and Moskau and more like pop songs and will get stuck in your head.  Los is a radical acoustic departure from the Rammstein sound, but it really grows on you.  The \\"ballads\\" Ohne Dich and Armour are amazing not just musically but lyrically as well.  The imagery Till uses describing love as a wild animal is really phenomenal.  If you don't know German definitely check out the translations.    Overall, this album was great, but Mutter is still the best.      BTW - The Amerika music video featuring the band on the moon is a must see!
B00005K9LK|5.0|After the somewhat bland Point Of Entry, Judas Priest re-grouped and put out this classic album. The guitars are on fire and Rob's vocals are in fine form. I dig every song except Pain & Pleasure. Electric Eye has a great riff and classic lyrics. The title track attacks your senses and never let's up! I personally dig Devil's Child. Another Thing Coming would be the hit off the album even though I believe it was the last song to be written and recorded. My only complaint would be that the production is sometimes a little clumsy in regards to the drums and guitars. I hope the new Priest album sees them back in late 70's/ early 80' form. I also recommend Killing Machine (Hell Bent For Leather) and Defenders Of The Faith, Priest's best three! (imo)
B0002KVUKM|5.0|What can I say about this movie........if you've seen it, you'll agree it's one cool movie! Hugh Jackman is excellent in the movie. If you loved the old dracula movies, this movie is a must-see!
B000003S09|5.0|I never really got into KC until I got this album about 7 years ago. I always knew of 21st Century Schizoid Man because April Wine did a good cover of it. I was very surprised by the production and songwriting, especially for an album that came out in 1969 (the year I was born). These guys were up there with the Beatles and The Doors as far as talent goes. Ahead of their time actually. The title track is excellent. The vocal delivery is great and the lyrics create wonderful imagery. Epitaph is a beautiful moving song. For those of you who saw the movie Buffalo 66 you may recall that Moonchild was used for the bowling (dancing) scene. 21stCSM is full of classic riffs and great time changes. Greg Lake would go on to ELP and Asia (for a brief time) and Ian McDonald would join Foreigner.
B0006284JQ|4.0|We've read the magazines, seen the photos of her at McDonald's, watched her marry her low-rent hubby. Somewhere, we lost the music. We forgot Britney's a performer, while she was becoming a tabloid queen. Hopefully this album will change that. I think \\"The Singles\\" would've been a better name for this collection, as we've only spent five years with Mrs. Federline. This album is a great dance album, all the songs you love, and three new tracks that show the promise of a great entertainer's future. I really like the bonus remix CD and hope that Jive gets its act together and puts out a full remix CD. As for retirement, don't worry guys, Britney will get her rest, and she'll come back BIG!
B000001EUP|5.0|This album opened the door to big success for the Scorpions and then Love At First Sting blew the door off it's hinges.  I think this is the Scorpions second best album after Animal Magnetism. The album opens with the rocking Blackout and it's simple but classic riff. Can't Live W/out You is catchy and has a short but wailing solo. No One Like You was the hit off the album and it has one of Mathias' best solos ever! You Given Me All I Need is a good emotional ballad. The second side has more classics like Arizona. The album closes with When The Smoke Is Going Down, a slow haunting song. I recommend all of their albums from Virgin Killer (1977) to LAFS (1984). Also, the new album Unbreakable is the best thing they have done in the last two decades.
B00063MBU8|5.0|hi guys!! <br />this album is the best ever, i can't get enough of it!!! it's so good!! make sure you go out and get it, it's awesome!! <br />also Simple Plan ROCK!! <br />bye
B000000WHC|5.0|Most people know of Gary Moore from his work with Thin Lizzy and his solo albums in the 80s (and let's not forget Skid Row-1970, Colliseum, and G-Force). Most of what he had done up to 1990 was hard rock with great lead guitar. But this album showed a side that Gary had only hinted at with songs like Parisienne Walkways and his early work with Skid Row. A good portion of the songs are covers but Gary makes each one his own. His vocals are bluesy and his lead playing is a joy to be heard. I used to listen to this album all the time during my part time job when I was in college. It helped the time go by quickly. It's very enjoyable from start to finish.
B00003CXA2|4.0|I'm going to disagree with a couple of other reviewers on here, and say this is a great movie. Why do people have to over-analyse things? And another thing: does Forrest really get the girl in the end? Cos if you watch right to the end, technically, he doesn't. In a way.<br /><br />My mum is a big fan of Tom Hanks, and watches Green Mile over & over, but whenever I suggest another Tom Hanks movie to her, she doesn't fancy it. I managed to sit her down in front of this, and she really enjoyed it! I love this movie, despite the length, and it has a great many stars in it: Robin Wright Penn, Sally Field, and Gary Sinise, to name but a few.<br /><br />I especially love how when Lieutenant Dan loses the bottom half of his legs, how it's done. It's fantastic! At first I thought, particularly when he was in the bed/wheelchair, that they were underneath him, or put through a hole in the bed, but apparently, his lower legs were wrapped in a special blue fabric that allowed them to be optically removed from the film by computer later.<br /><br />Lieutenant Dan tells Forrest that the day Forrest works on a shrimp boat is the day he'd be an astronaut. This is a reference to the book, where Forrest actually becomes an astronaut, and the following year, they appeared together as astronauts in Apollo 13.<br /><br />The Doors have more songs in the movie than any other band with a total of five. These are, \\"Soul Kitchen\\" (in one of the Vietnam scenes), \\"Hello, I Love You\\" (first song in Forrest's first ping pong sequence), \\"Break On Through\\" (second song in Forrest's first ping pong sequence), \\"People Are Strange\\" (third song in Forrest's first ping pong sequence), and \\"Love Her Madly\\" (when Jenny is leaving the hotel room with a black eye after presumably resorting to prostitution).<br /><br />I love Jenny's character in this, played by Robin Wright Penn. It's the way her whole look changes constantly throughout the movie, while Forrest stays the exact same. I think the character of Kayleigh from Butterfly Effect was loosely based around Jenny's character, as both characters change so much throughout the movie.<br /><br />There's a lot of historical events in this movie, including meeting Elvis and teaching him how to dance, he met John Lennon and gave him his inspiration for Imagine (and two presidents), he was in Vietnam and started the Watergate scandal ... he even got rich and famous. I think the Watergate scandal went straight over my head, didn't understand that bit at all. Everyone knows this stuff wasn't likely to ever happen, and I hate the fact that they used old news reels, and someone attempted (albeit badly) to change the words the people were actually speaking! The lip movements are very wrong.<br /><br />It's hard to believe this movie is now 10 years old, and fingers crossed, in another ten years, it'll be considered even more of a classic than it is now. If you liked the Back To The Future trilogy, and any other Robert Zemeckis movie, then you'll love this. The book's quite different from the movie, but that's worthwhile picking up cheap if you can.character of Kayleigh from Butterfly Effect was loosely based around Jenny's character, as both characters change so much throughout the movie. <br /> <br />There's a lot of historical events in this movie, including meeting Elvis and teaching him how to dance, he met John Lennon and gave him his inspiration for Imagine (and two presidents), he was in Vietnam and started the Watergate scandal ... he even got rich and famous.

B000001ESP|5.0|While Rush has several great albums, it all came together on this album. The musicianship and songwriting are superb. Every song is a classic so I will not bother naming them. The band was in a very good place at this point in time. If you don't have this album order it today! I also put A Farewell To Kings and Signals among Rush's best, but I know everyone has their own favorites.
B000002UA5|5.0|Ummagumma is one of those albums which you either like strongly or dislike strongly. I like it strongly. Specifically, the songs: \\"Careful with the Axu Eugene\\", \\"Astronomy Domine\\", and \\"The Narrow Way\\". Each of them are truely unique and wonderful items.  <br /> <br />\\"Astronomy Domine\\" is best rendered in this version - unlike the studio or later renditions the development of the two themes is fully worked out. <br /> <br />\\"The Narrow Way\\" is comprised of three sections. The first is dominated by an upbeat guitar theme. The second is organized chaos, as comprised of synthisizers, gutars, percussion, and other sounds. The third section first enters with a single continuous note with calms down the cataphony of the middle section. It then launches into the lyrical vocal section. The section and the peice ends with multiple repeats of the them of the third section, then fades. <br /> <br />\\"Careful with Ax Eugene\\" is less about themes and melodies than raw emotion. The feelings and emotions surrounding a major injury or perhaps a great loss are accurately portrayed by the song. Normal existence, then the pain of the event or finding out about a loss, the anger, rage, then slow acceptiance - the music goes from soft and quiet to a loud frenzy, then slowly softens and mellows out until at the end its back to being soft and quiet, just as acceptiance of a major event gives peace.
B000002H2H|5.0|I got RTL on cassette when they were still on Megaforce records. The title track was the \\"3rd most valuable metal\\" song on the radio show Metal Shop (\\"the only show with teeth\\"..Yngwie guitar). At first it seemd a bit harsh compared to what I had listened to up to that time (Ac/Dc, Judas Priest, Iron Maiden, etc.) but I kept listening to the song from my recording of that week's show. I am not a huge fan of Kirk Hammett (a decent player and a cool guy but a bit overrated) but I really liked his guitar playing/tone on that song so I decided to get the album. I'm glad I did because RTL is full of Metalliclassics! For Whom The Bell Tolls has cool bass from Cliff and kick ass singing by James. Creeping Death has a classic riff and great lyrics. Fade To Black was a song I could really relate to in my teens. The only song I could do w/out is Fight Fire With Fire, although the delicate opening followed by an avalanche of guitars was classic for the time. Metallica was a band where each member put their stamp on the music. Whether it was a cool drum fill from Lars or a cool bass part from Cliff (rest in peace). I still can't believe that a little known band I used to listen to in my basement is now a household name. Master Of Puppets is another classic Metallica album!
B00006JLX4|5.0|When thinking about the music that has been the soundtrack of my life Pavement isn't one of the bands that immediately sticks out in my mind, but yet their music has been with me for a long time. I bought Crooked Rain Crooked Rain in 1994 when I was 14 years old. At that time I was deep into indie rock, but had started gravitating toward the music that would eventually dominate my life. The music I am referring to is that of Phish. And while I would also venture into hip hop, jazz, and funk the one album I continually would go back to was Crooked Rain. I would go almost two years between listening to that album, but it was always there. It was always interesting when I would listen to that album after such a long break from it because my ear for music had changed so much over the years, but I had such a deep love for the songs on that album it got better each time I listened to it and it made me appreciate that album even more.  The strange part though is that even though I loved that album I never bought any of their other albums. I guess I was too wrapped up in other music over the years. So now it's been ten years since I bought Crooked Rain and I finally got around to buying another Pavement album. I generally don't like to buy deluxe album packages, but this one seemed like it might be worth it. I might have heard bits and pieces of this album over the years, but I never sat down and gave it a good listen. I knew I would like it, but there was a bit of uncertainty. The truly great albums to me are the ones that never age and this is definitely one of those. There's not much more you could ask for from a studio album except that it was longer, which is why I really like all the extra stuff on this package. Malkmus is definitely one of the original voices in music and the music on this album is surely self-effacing. the best music is when the band and the audience can connect somehow, which is really difficult and rare to do. A lot of people don't truly understand this concept, but I was lucky enough to experience this with Phish and I feel the same when I listen to Pavement.  Being a huge fan of live and improvised music I found the live material on this album to be listenable but not exceptional. This album has definitely rekindled my interest in Pavement and I'm looking forward to exploring the rest of their music and solo efforts. It's really weird to have a band that was a part of your childhood be a part of your adulthood and Pavement is one of those for me. I'm glad I took the time to let them back into my life and I'm sorry for the long hiatus. I encourage anyone with a mild interest to buy their first two albums. If you love music you won't be disappointed.

B0002Z9HT8|5.0|This is the best DVD I own, period.  I am not sure why, after almost 20 years of waiting, people are complaining that it is not complete.  I am so grateful that this has finally come out.  I watched two hours of it last night, and I was overcome with emotion, actually crying tears of joy.  Like other reviewers who have actually purchased it, I was surprised at the high quality throughout.  The technical glitches are minimal, and certainly don't detract from the enjoyment even for a moment.  Yes, I am disappointed that XXX isn't in it, or that YYY's set is edited, but that is such a minor fault compared to the wealth of great music on it.  Tina Turner was so hot! 10 HOURS!  BUY THIS!
B000669GAI|5.0|Pearl Jam's musical genious, ability to rock the F-ing house down, compatibility and poignancy hasn't diminished one smigeon in their years together.  I've boughten each album, nearly every single, DVD, whatever they deserve it all.  I always knew that they weren't in it for the money and if you don't believe me look into it.  They have enough charities and concerts giving away all proceeds to make them look like the innovators of the medium.  I love Pearl Jam unabashedly, I have even since \\"TEN\\" came out in '91 when I was only nine years of age.  They are the longest running favorite of mine, when anyone asks what type of music I love or listen to, I cannot say anything else but: \\"Pearl Jam.\\"  They embody so much of what I have felt through these years on this earth.  I've cried so many times to \\"Black\\" that I'm surprised each time I listen to it, it still gives me the chills!  I don't base other bands weight off of theirs, they are a distinction, a catagory a genre all their own, they defy distinction.  If you want to chill or rock out or meditate or seriously knock a wall down you can usually go through all these emotions on any one of their albums.  They constantly change it up on you but there's always that jammin' style that we've almost grown to expect, they don't have to be so generous with their talents, they just are and they are simply huge because of it.  They've never sold any one of their songs for anything but maybe the poor of this and other nations, and that's not selling, that's giving.  They were rock legends at their inception and that hasn't changed at all.  Who else packs amphitheaters with devotees each year with the same excitement?  I've never been more excited for a live show than for Pearl Jam, because their recorded sound is live.  They make music, organically...I know I'm rambling, but that's what this band does to me, they defy my own praise by just being who they are, something the artists of today should sincerely aspire for.  Thank you boys for all the years of awesome music, you've inspired me to make music my life.
B00006WUWQ|4.0|I like this package. Austin Powers is truly a great trilogy.  The only problem is that 2 of the DVD's are fullscreen and 1 is widescreen.  I wanted all widescreen, but it's ok.  I actually found it at my local Target.  It was a great deal.  Thanks Target!  :)
B0002XDODU|5.0|\\"Reise, Reise\\" is decidedly softer than their previous albums.  The majority of the album is ballads.  It took a few glaces at the lyrics and times of listening to the songs to appreciate this album fully.  The lyrics to the songs are absolutely amazing.  This is where the album really shines.  The only exception to this is \\"Amerika,\\" because its simple lyrics become monotonous quickly.  In my opinion, the most exceptional lyrics on the album are of \\"Amour\\" and \\"Ohne Dich.\\" <br /> <br />Overall, it marks an interesting progression from their previous album and definitely worth purchasing if you are a fan.  It may be too much of a departure from their heavier previous works if you are not a fan.
B000669GAI|5.0|If you're a Pearl Jam fan, you haven't questioned yourself - you have already gone out there and bought it.  This is a must for any Pearl Jam fan.  For others, it can be a great album if you like their few singles (that have videos) or songs you might have heard on the radio.  Nonetheless, this is a great album.    This is divided into \\"Upside\\" and \\"Downside\\", a very creative way to release the album.  The \\"Upside\\" contains the harder/faster songs such as 'Spin the Black Circle', 'Hail, Hail' and 'Do the Evolution'.  It contains reproduced tracks 'Once' and 'Alive' - some people are stating 'Even Flow' is as well, just not stated in the album booklet.  \\"Downside\\" contains the slower/acoustic songs such as 'Nothingman', 'Nothing as it Seems' and 'Off he Goes'.  This also contains a reproduced song, 'Black' which is by far one of their best songs.    This album contains a couple of non-album tracks.  'Breath' which was taken from the \\"Singles\\" soundtrack.  'Man of the Hour' which was released for Tim Burton's \\"Big Fish\\" and Pearl Jam also made a \\"Amazon exclusive\\" single for it.  If you're not a huge Pearl Jam fan, you might not have 'Last Kiss' or 'Yellow Ledbetter' but they are featured on \\"Lost Dogs\\".  Also contains 'State of Love and Trust' and 'I Got ID'.  Most Pearl Jam fans know and most likely have these songs already.    This collection is a brilliant way to get someone into Pearl Jam, an awesome road trip CD (\\"Upside\\") and a great way to chill (\\"Downside\\").  You get the best of both worlds here.  An excellent addition to anyone's collection.  It's Pearl Jam - the Gods of Music - just pick it up.  You will NOT regret it.
B0002XVQNU|3.0|I am sorely disappointed that fans are forced to choose between the two-disc loaded down with goodies edition, and the extended directors cut that appears to be lacking all of the great extras included in the orginal DVD release.  What is up with that.  Please tell me, is there a 3rd release planned with the directors cut AND the goodies.
B0002XDODU|3.0|Since I'm obsessed, whether or not to buy is not the issue. After listening to the excerpts on amazon, I totally know that this isn't the CD I'm going to be \\"rocking\\" out to in my car, with the exception of Mein Teil & Amerika (which will probably get on my nerves after the 50th time listening to it). This CD definitely shows their age and I hate that, next thing you know Till will have his own spoken word albums (like Henry Rollins) and all their music will be slow and devoid of any electronic experimentation. There are no risks taken on this CD, and it's a total let down since they had 3 years to work on it. Having no edge, and with every song sounding too similar, maybe this is a sign that their time is fleeting. But I still love them just the same.
B0001CCXZW|5.0|I just want to say that I LOVE GILMORE GIRLS! The witty humor, fast talk ,incredable amounts of coffee drinking and mother-daughter relationship not only are practically cloned from my life but also make for GREAT entertainment !! This is my FAV. show of all time and this DVD set is great as well, the disc set-up is great , and so are the special features!A great set for everyone- especially mothers and daughters
B000067CPX|5.0|With the exception of the second song, I listen to this album the entire way through without skipping. I am usually in a great mood by the end and I love to sing along. I have all of their other albums and although I have songs off those albums I love more than many of these I love more songs off this one than most of the others...for what it's worth.
B00004XONN|5.0|In the year 2000, Radiohead ditched its former \\"real\\" rock sound for Pink-Floydian, electronic post-rock. The result was \\"Kid A,\\" where they relearned everything they knew about music from scratch. Some people loved it. Some didn't get it, and felt it was \\"pretentious.\\" But there's one undeniable thing -- this chilly, eerie collection is a marvelously complex piece of work.<br /><br />An ominous keyboard melody and gibberish vocals open the album in \\"Everything In Its Right Place,\\" sounding a bit like a possessed radio. Then the fuzz and hums kick in, adding a spacey dimension to an already strange melody. A drum melody kicks in in the title track, followed by the ghostly rock of \\"National Anthem\\" and unearthly lament of \\"How to Disappear Completely.\\"<br /><br />Another \\"real\\" rock song kicks in with the darkly desperate \\"Optimistic,\\" flanked by a pair of softer, eerie songs. \\"Idioteque\\" throws all the rules out the window with sharp percussion backed by weird waves of sound and Thom Yorke's high vocals. And finally it ends on the same note it began -- a stately organ -- in the harp-accented \\"Motion Picture Soundtrack.\\"<br /><br />In a musical world where anything that has a guitar can be called \\"rock,\\" it's difficult to find music that is really creative. It's even harder to find a band that is willing to take risks, and expand their art. But those things can be found in Radiohead, and the evidence is in \\"Kid A\\" -- whether listeners think it's a wild success or a pretentious failure, it has to be admitted that it takes guts to try out something this different.<br /><br />Thom Yorke's vocals are often described as whiny, but they are suited to the music here. Sometimes it's as little as backing \\"ooh oohs,\\" and sometimes he's lamenting about ice ages and suicidal cries of \\"This isn't happening/I'm not here.\\" Do the lyrics make sense? Not at first glance, at least -- they're more like a part of the music than lyrics in themselves.<br /><br />And hoo boy, the music. Few bands do panoramic electronic soundscapes as Radiohead does here, scratched with wailing voices and eerie noises. More ordinary instruments are included, but add to the strange atmosphere rather than grounding it -- razor-sharp percussion, mellow organ, rippling harp strings, and subtle, swelling strings.<br /><br />The Radiohead of \\"Kid A\\" is looking at a bleak, cold place, but not one that is ugly or alienating. Instead, you just want to sink into it and experience its beauty, no matter how cold or bleak it is. A true modern classic.o boy, the music.

B00063MBU8|5.0|The album is just really good. The last album was great too but it was more punk rock but in the new album they have a different sound. It's still great! My favourite songs are \\"Crazy\\", \\"Perfect Word\\", and \\"Shut Up\\". But the whole alum is really great. The songs actually have a lot of meaning and sense. Not like some songs that are just about some girl that dumped them. Simple Plan sings about eveyrthing. About friendships. Relatinonships. Life. Unfairness. Everything. They are just so great! They really have taken punk rock to a whole new level...I recomment this to all Simple Plan fans and also to people who like punk rock and generally rock bands like Blink 182, Sum 41, Linkin Park or Good Charlotte. So crab it now you won't be dissapointed but you'll become obssesed with Simple Plan and will be playing the album all the day long...all week..I KNOW..i do!
B0002XDODU|4.0|At first i was like meh then i was like heh now im like yeh... im starting to love it more and more each time i hear it...and i believe you will too...
B00008EY65|5.0|Spiderman was a good movie, it had action. The action was cool. HOWEVER, every piece of \\"character development\\", drama, emotion - was profoundly fake. The emotional scenes all consisted of camera shots of someone's face looking confused and slightly to the left. Aaaaandddd HOLD. Drama - there you have it. Ok, switch to the other character and launch into a pointless 5 minute monologue.<br /><br />I'm usually content with a shallow action thriller, but Hellboy combines action with some serious empathy for the main chacacter, and excellent, believable character interaction.<br /><br />One of the greatest things about this movie is it's so damn COOL. Every action scene, every monster and character, the entire comic-book styling - they all have this pervading sense of style and finesse that really serve to bring the movie home.<br /><br />The movie was, to say the least, highly enjoyable. I'd recommend it to anyone.
B0002Z1EG2|3.0|This greatest hits in a way is a freaking joke.  All the Greatest Hits are off only THREE ALBUMS, with only a few off the UP album...mostly two albums.  Couldn't she release at least ONE more album before giving us a Greatest Hits album.  Also, why must there be two fricking versions of the song \\"Party for Two\\"  Either choose the horrible singing Billy Currington who has no future in country music or the drunk guy from Sugar Ray...do we honestly need a pop and country version of this song on a greatest hits CD? If you weren't one of the 10 million people who picked up COME ON OVER or one of the 10 Million people who picked up The Woman in Me, then buy this CD.
B000000WCA|5.0|Yes it's pop music, and yes it's the Spice Girls. <br /> <br />But beyond the tiring prejudices of those narrow-minded \\"cool\\" people (whose inaccurate hateful reviews mean as much as dog's poo), fact is this record is one of the biggest-selling albums of the 90's and (brace yourself) the music is good. <br />It's pop at its best (and how it should always be) : fun, funky, saucy, fresh, well-crafted, not taking itself too seriously... <br />No wonder songs like \\"Wannabe\\", \\"Say you'll be there\\" or \\"2 become 1\\" became classics. This album is a must for any pop lover. Push play and enjoy.  <br /> <br />
0064407667|5.0|My 9-year-old daughter and I thoroughly enjoyed Lemony Snicket's \\"The Bad Beginning\\". My daughter, who has ADD, had great difficulty finding chapter books that captured and held her attention. As much as she enjoyed the Harry Potter movies, she could not focus long enough to read the books. <br /> <br />When we started \\"The Bad Beginning,\\" she couldn't stop reading! The Baudelaire orphans each had a quality that interested her. Violet loves to invent and is fascinated by how things work. Klaus is a natural sleuth: an avid researcher and detective in his own right. And Baby Sunny is so infectiously wonderful. She bites, but only the bad guys! <br /> <br />I recommend these books to children and adults alike. We flew through this one and couldn't wait to start \\"The Reptile Room\\"!
B0001FR3IG|3.0|Over-rated? Cliche? Confusing and tiring? Then you just might be one of those lucky, run-of-the-mill suspense flicks that refuse to cease its pounding on Hollywood's door! Come down to the local video store today to find yourself that special spot on the rental shelf, next to \\"Last House on the Left,\\" and \\"Jeepers Creepers,\\" today!    Director Matthieu Kassovitz's intentions were the noblest, Halle Berry pushed as hard as her abilities would allow, as did the most part of the supporting cast, but 'Gothika' has several flaws worth considering.    What do films like \\"I Know What You Did Last Summer,\\" \\"The Haunting,\\" \\"Jason Goes to Hell,\\" and \\"Bride of Chucky,\\" have in common? They're uninspired, trite crowd-pleasers. Emphasis is placed on the gore and creepy atmosphere instead of the acting quality and polishing the plotline.  Scripting is fair, if not somewhat raw, but Downey Jr.--as the skeptic shrink associate opposite Berry--(in this reviewer's opinion) could have shown a bit more skill.   The secondary caracters, considering the compact amount of cellophane they were given, proved good stock characters, but that's the weakness, anyway. Berry reveals her intriguing versatility as the misunderstood psychologist, Miranda Grey, proving a great upcoming role before her plummet into the calamity of 'Catwoman.'    One can be thankful, to say the least, that an excellent score, masterfully crafted by the one and only John Ottman, boldfaces and holds true to the [overdrawn] haunting themes--a surprise, considering he previously scored Halloween H*20 in '98.    On the whole, though folks, we can thank God (and Kassovitz, for that matter) that the gore was kept at a somewhat minimal level, remaining a suspense/drama flick and not insulted to the horror genre at Berry's expense. Average. Not profound, or \\"icily chilling,\\" (Sorry, Siskel and Roeper) but subtely average.    Rented it, liked it a little, flushed it,  --GIGI
B00008J2R1|3.0|I was so looking forward to this release. The masters of these sessions must have been horrible. There's alot of overloading and the channel separation is terrible. Everything is blaring at once, and there's no balance. The vocals are everywhere, and it sounds like he was overloading the microphone. There's no space around the voice. <br /> <br />I like a lot of the songs on this album, but this SACD comes off very poorly. <br /> <br />I think it's great that the orchestra and some instruments have been isolated in the rear channels and now sound clearer than ever, but the overall sound is still very muddy, distorted, and overloaded.  <br /> <br />For die-hard Oasis fans with a need to hear these classics in a Multichannel mix.
B00004XQP4|5.0|This album is great and under rated. The songs are for the most part not as loud as some other Green Day stuff but i really like the album. Church On Sunday is one of my favourite songs...<BR>Uhh ya that's all.
B0000DJZAH|5.0|This album is SO GOOD. <br /> <br />I don't know TOMMY at all, and this is my first WHO album. Listening from this vantage, I now understand why it was turned into a major Bway musical. The performance captured on this recording is dramatic, intensely musical, and intelligent. <br /> <br />In terms of sound, listening only to the 2channel SACD layer, the drums sound incredibly lifelike. The piano has a wonderful live sound, and the guitars and bass sound very crisp and succinct. The vocals are very nice and clear. I like the close-up sound, since it lets you really hear the musicianship, and the mixing creates a nice balance so everything has space around it. I couldn't really tell that this is a 25 year old recording at all. The sound is as good as, and in some places better, than the Rolling Stones SACDs. <br /> <br />I'm impressed and loving the music. I only wish Goodbye Yellow Brick road sounded like this. <br /> <br />While I'm not immediately appreciative of the 2nd disk with alternate material, there is a wealth of different versions of songs, and in some cases, I like the alternates better. It's great to hear the variations. These are also all in excellent sound, and there's a jam session that almost sounds like you're there. <br /> <br />I can easily put this album into the \\"must-have\\" category.
B00005JNEI|5.0|This was a great documentary. However, I find it sad that a single person or perhaps a group of people need to come on Fahrenheit 9/11 daily on Amazon to write a negative review of the documentary without even seeing it.  This disturbs me for three reasons: <br />1. It means you have too much time on your hands and you have nothing better to do than write a negative review and waste space on Amazon. <br />2. Or this means the people who do it are suffering from paranoia and equate Michael Moore with the boogeyman and they fear him so much that they need to write negative reviews about every single product of his without even reading it or seeing it.   <br />3. Or there are people who need some anger management therapy because when they think about Michael Moore that they are about to crap in their pants and they are so angry that they go to all his products and review them negatively - even going into other countries websites! <br /> <br />There is freedom of speech in America. Anytime you try to oppress the person from speaking their views, you are being unconstitutional and un-American. Not to mention just plain scary.
B00064X3FO|5.0|YOUR SONG - Elton's voice is so lovely back in his 2nd album. It receives a gorgeous focus on the center channel. The guitars and harps are so clear that you can hear that they weren't perfectly in tune with each other. :-) The strings are in the rear channels and are very clear, and sound GREAT in the last note. Bass and percussion sound very lifelike. <br /> <br />I NEED YOU TO TURN TO - Harpsichord is isolated in the left channel, Elton in the center. The small string orchestra in mainly from the rear channels. The winding violin figures are clearer than ever. <br /> <br />TAKE ME TO THE PILOT - The bassline will vibrate your living room, and show you how progressive and soulful his writing always was. The various piano riffs move around in position. The guitar solo is clearer than ever. <br /> <br />NO SHOE STRINGS ON LOUISE - the funny background vocals are very clear, and you can finally hear that they are trying to \\"ham it up\\". Acoustic guitars are really clear, and come from the rear channels. The enhanced sound really captures the mood of the song much better than before. <br /> <br />FIRST EPISODE AT HIENTON - This song receives a great emotional boost from the clarity of the harp and guitar and the synthesizer being separated in the soundstage. <br /> <br />SIXTY YEARS ON - The harp solo is so clear! The string orchestra is very, very well isolated. The subtley of the instruments around the solo voice is the perfect balance. <br /> <br />BORDER SONG - HOLY MOSES, this sounds great. :-) <br /> <br />THE GREATEST DISCOVERY - The strings sound so gorgeous here, and it's recorded very close to the instruments. Elton's voice here highlights his great storytelling vocals. The bass drum is more prominent than before and changes the mood of the song a little. I wish the final calls from the brass were more prominent as they were in RBCD. <br /> <br />THE CAGE - Guitar solos and brass?? I didn't even notice them before! The synthesizer solo with rock your house. <br /> <br />THE KING MUST DIE - The percussion entrance is amazingly lifelike! The song builds to an exciting climax with layer upon layer of instrumentation adding up to make a stunning ending to the original content of this album. <br /> <br />The bonus tracks are great, and they have never ever sounded better. The original version of Grey Seal is SO different, and I have always liked this version better. <br /> <br />Like the others in this set of six Elton John SACDs that were released 11/9/04, the standard is very high. If you love the songs on this album, you must have this SACD. <br /> <br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.
B00006RIO7|5.0|I didn't like the movie Chicago at all the first time I saw it, but I thought the music was good. After seeing it a second time, I thought it was awesome. Not long after, I bought the CHICAGO OST and absolutely love it. <br /> <br />Highlights of the disk: <br />*All That Jazz - The \\"main theme\\" of Chicago, I guess. It's an awesome song that really gets you in the mood for the rest of the movie, and who knew that Catherine Zeta-Jones could sing like that? <br />*Funny Honey - The first song you really hear Renee Zellweger (\\"Roxie Hart\\") sing in. I love the lyrics to this song, and I think Renee has a pretty good voice as well.  <br />*Cell Block Tango - Most definately the best song on the CHICAGO disk. Everyone in it sings incredibly well, and I love the speaking parts. Funny and dark at the same time. <br />*They Both Reached for the Gun - This song is, in one word, insane. There's so much going on during it, but its insanely fun.  <br /> <br />All the songs on this CD are great (minus the rap/hip-hop version of Cell Block Tango). If you haven't seen the movie yet, its recommended to anyone that liked the music. <br /> <br />Overall grade - A+
B00003CXCT|5.0|I'm bored with these people who are saying that they want the original trilogy. Your complaining is no sense. The story is the same and the modifications are normally for the better. I also saw the originals, I also fall in love with them. I liked them when I was a child and I like them now when I am a College professor. There is fun in Star Wars, but there are also some important messages for our time. But I'm not writing this to talk about that, but to tell everyone that those who are claiming that this DVD is an adulteration of Star Wars are wrong. The story is the same and the modifications are, as I already said, normally for the better. First let me tell you about the changes I did not like. I did not like the new Solo-Greedo episode and the two new songs in ROTJ (the one in Jabba the Hutt chambers and the one with the ewooks at the end). But the other changes are great. There is really someone who thinks that it is better to see that strange emperor with the freaky eye in Empire which has nothing to do with the Return of the Jedi character. I was disappointed when the special editions came out, because they didn't change that, and now I am glad they did it; this change makes Star Wars a better story, a more coherent one. Isn't it great to see more of mos-eisly when Luke and Obi-Wan enter the town? Isn't it better to have a look at the snow monster that attacks Luke? Isn't it for the better to have more realistic matte paintings in Bespin? Isn't it better to have some new fighting shots when the rebels attack the first Death Star, which gave the sequence more agility and excitement. I could go on and on, but I won't. Star Wars is just the same, the same epic, the same story. All characters do the same things because all the changes are just minor ones, decoratives ones if you wish, and they are normally for the better. Those who still complaint are just irrational people who are engaged in a stupid criticism of George Lucas. They just decided with no reason tohate George Lucas but to love the young version of him, to hate everything he does now and to praise what he did 25 years ago. Let stop this no sense about new editions; new editions are common practice. Nobody complaints when an author publish a second edition of his book, where he makes corrections and additions. Nobody is complaining that the subsecuent editions of Lord of the Rings corrected the errors and misspellings of the first one. No one criticises a scientist who publish a second version of an earlier work, in which he tries to improve his discoveries. Well I leave it at that. If you don't like Star Wars that is fine with me, but don't come saying that you liked the originals but not the new editions, that is plain no sense, contradictory babbling, because Star Wars has not changed, it is the same movie we saw as children and fall in love with but with some improvements. <br /> <br />Let me say just something about the DVD set. It is great, the movies look awesome and the documentaries are fine. The only thing I regret is that they didn't gave us more documentaries material. The ones that are in the dvd are good, but they could make more: how about a documentary about the special effects and other about the construction of Skywalker Ranch and its facilities. They could put more commentaries, the same way the Lord of the Rings extended editions do: one with the actors, with the directors, etc. It would have been great to hear Mark Hamill and Harrison Ford. Anyway, understand what I am saying, the bonus material are ok (I specially enjoyed seeing the first Star Wars trailer) but because I love so much these movies I would like to have more.
B0002F6BRE|5.0|After almost a year of waiting for this DVD to get here, finally it arrives, and I must say that it definitely was worth the wait. Will Ferrell, now the hottest thing in comedy (with movies booked for him till 2007), proves it in the movie about a boy who crawled into Santa's bag at an orphange one Christmas and is then adopted by elves, only to go out looking for his real father in New York City. Of course, having been raised by elves who have never left the North Pole in their lives, this turns out to be a very interesting journey; especially when his father turns out to be on Santa's naughty list. This is definitely a great movie for parents and kids alike, and adults without kids also. I recommend this for everyone.
B0000CAQ27|4.0|If you have liked Pink from the start, you will totally love this album. Pink's voice is amazing. She doesn't sound like every other singer, her voice is beautiful. This album is a showcase of what Pink can really do. She is extremely talented and it is evident in this album. It's completely different from MIZZUNDASTOOD, but it's better.
0375422889|5.0|In her usual creative manner, once again, Marjane explains the challenges of growing up in a foreign country. This book is defenitely worth keeping! The author presents the material in an easy to read, amuzing manner. She is extremely talented. Once again, Well done!
B00003CXXJ|4.0|This isn't so much a review as a comment on some complaints on \\"morals\\" in the movie. One reviewer said that since the moral of the movie is bascially \\"don't judge a book by it's cover\\" Shrek shouldn't be making fun of Farquaads height. This is a fair point, and I can see why some might object. However in the DVD if you play the \\"Filmmakers commentry\\" Vicky Jenson makes the remark that    \\"We're not disaparaging short people. Farquaad has issues. He just can't recognize that of everyone he's kicking out,he would consider himself part of them, but he's got blinders. It's his own form of denial\\"    So you could argue that Farquaad is initially guilty of the hypocrisy. And since Farquaad sends Shrek on a quest to rescue a Princess so that he can have his swamp back which Farquaad populated with creatures initially, I think Shrek is entitled to some bitterness!        One reviewers commented that Shrek is an allegory for Americas foreign policy, where Shrek represents America, and the dragon symbolises the atomic bomb. Shrek plays the role of world policeman, like America. The \\"vandalism\\" scene in the church supposedly represents Americas centuries-old hatred of Catholicism. Well,  if you stare at flower design wallpaper long enough you can pick out certain patterns that can represent rudimentary human faces. The designers of the wallpaper sure didn't mean there to be but if the will's there, you'll see what you want to see. My point is that you could find some kind of pseudo allegory in any movie if you look long enough, regardless if the makers meant there to be any. What next, the shark in Jaws representing the threat of Communist Russia in the mid 70s?     Some complain of the crude humour. I don't care really. I watch Red Dwarf because it can be both intelligent and potty mouthed. It's the contrast between the two styles that I like. If everything was all intelligent, witty, charming and adorable in Shrek, it would be like candy floss. Appealing initially, but soonto overdose on the charming and become tiresome and sickly. And vice versa. That's just my opinion, and if others disagree then I won't argue. It's not about right and wrong, but about personal taste. The potty humpour to me is about being irreverent, not just grossing out for it's own sake. It's Dreamworks The Rolling Stones to Disney's The Beatles. (Hey, I like The Beatles more than Stones in general, but theres nothing wrong with taking a different approach!)    And finally the exploding bird scene, where some said that children cried in the cinema where they saw it. That scene is something that Monty Python might have used. Funny to some, but not to others. It's intentional bad taste. In my view that's the only scene that might warrant the \\"Parental Guidance\\" That's the only scene I personally have a problem with.    But frankly I don't watch Shrek for the \\"morals\\". It's effective on diffeent levels, and I enjoy it for the laugh out loud humour and the visual feast of it's graphics.
B0002IVN9W|4.0|this is my first review, but thats all behind us now. i heard alot of hype about this album from respectable sources, but this thats happened before with not much of a result. i decided to preview it on amazon and listened to 30 seconds of each track. well that was all i needed. i bought album earlier tonight, so this review is a tad premature, but i can already guarantee (on third listen) this is a must have album for many a music fan. definately one of those albums that puts you in a specific space, time, feeling. a nice warm one. words i would use to describe this album: <br />-triumphant <br />-relentless <br />-inspriring <br />-flat-out-beautiful <br />sort of brings to mind a more melodic and danceable broken social scene. i first described it as bowie vocals with talking heads sparaticness and modern, intense, theatrical music. definately worth a chance. hope this review helped.
B0002G2B2M|5.0|Wow...where to start?  First of all, the plot is ingenious and so original.  It may seem like just another love story at first, but once you get into the movie, you realize that this is so much more than a love story.  It is a revelation of how important our memories are and how despite our wanting to be rid of some, they can never be undone and will shape the person we become.     <br />Next, the acting is incredible.  I will never look at Jim Carrey the same way.  While he proved he can play a character other than a quirky dimwit in The Majestic, he has really outdone himself as the somewhat soft-spoken Joel.  I wouldn't be surprised if he gets an Oscar nod.  His performance was that good.  Kate Winslet also did an awesome job as the free-spirited and impulsive Clementine.  You can't even tell she has an English accent in real life!  Dunst, Ruffalo, Wood, etc., completed the amazing ensemble.  However, Carrey and Winslet shine in this movie. <br />Finally, this is the kind of movie where you have to really pay attention in order to understand everything, which I love about it.  The movie bounces back and forth between Joel's memories and what's happening in real-time, so it is definitely not for those who need a sequential movie.  However, if you pay attention, everything will come together. <br />I can't say enough positive things about this movie.  I would say this is one of the best films of 2004, and I would be very disappointed if the film didn't get any Oscar nods.  It definitely deserves it.
B0006284JQ|3.0|If you think about it, Britney has come out with GREAT music these past 5 years and now all the sudden that she has ALOT of money and is able to sit at home all day with hubby.Now,if you think about it she basically used fans to get money and now she is leaving us dry. That is not what i call someone who is devoted to their musicand fans, for example, Janet has been around for decades and still keeps releasing music for her die hard fans,do you really think she needs the money? I dont think so, but on the other hand she is what we call AN ARTIST WHO IS  TRULY DEVOTED TO HER FANS AND MUSIC. WHILE Britney is just a sell out bottom feeding pimp looking for the hard benjamins. I rest my case.  <br />ps. As far as her new cd goes(shes trying to scoop up as much cash as she can before she bounces) the cd is not worth buying, because if you were a true fan (like me) you would already have all her cds and dont need another one with all the same songs, except for three, which is another method of trying to get people in being stuck to buying her cd. Just download them, they suck anyway.
B000002LRX|5.0|It's true that this doesn't exactly fit the metal mold, but maybe that's why I like it so much. Out of all the albums I own, this has to be one of the most diverse. Every song is versatile, and genius in it's own right. To put it simply, \\"Angel Dust\\" is anything but redundant. <br /> <br />Mike Patton (vocals) - Patton's second Faith No More album, and I must say, his improved vocals are absolutely stunning. His vocal performance on \\"The Real Thing\\" was great, but nothing to write home about. At that time, his voice seemed a little nasally, and sometimes even obnoxious. A lot has changed since then. With \\"Angel Dust\\", Mike showcases a variety of different ranges, and I believe it was this album that garnered him the respect he now has. <br /> <br />Jim Martin (guitars) - There's not much to say here, as Martin rarely does anything of importance on this album. Yes, there are some cool riffs here and there, but they're rarely found. I know what you're thinking - \\"a metal album where the guitars aren't the main focus?\\". Indeed, it sounds crazy, but it works. <br /> <br />Billy Gould (bass) - I've always considered Billy Gould to be an underrated bassist, but like Martin, \\"Angel Dust\\" doesn't showcase his best work. However, unlike Martin, Gould does have a bigger role, and his bass is noticeable in almost every track. \\"Crack Hitler\\", in particular, is a nice display of his talents. <br /> <br />Roddy Bottum (keyboards) - Besides Patton, the biggest focus seems to be on the keyboards. Bottum added a nice vibe to the three previous albums, but he was never as dominant as he is here. The atmosphere portrayed by the synths is quite amazing. The best depiction of this would have to be the highlight of the album, \\"Midlife Crisis\\". <br /> <br />Mike Bordin (drums) - The drumming is stellar, like always. \\"Puffy\\" does a top-notch job on each record, so you know he won't disappoint. <br /> <br />Like I mentioned before, \\"Midlife Crisis\\" is a stand-out track, but it would be waytoo hard to recommend only a few songs. Trust me, when you have an album as brilliant as this, you'll want to listen to the whole thing.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|The Beatles had so many hit records including hits in some countries but not others.  For convenience, the compilers chose to include The Beatles' #1 hits on the U.S. and/or U.K. charts for this first-ever single-CD greatest hits compilation.  I need not explain the music.  The track listing explains it all.  The only explainations I need to give is first that the version of \\"Love Me Do\\" is the \\"Andy White\\" version featuring Ringo on tambourine and Andy White on drums.  It's this version of \\"Love Me Do\\" that was released in the USA by Vee-Jay Records on the Tollie label in 1964.  As the running order is based on when the songs were recorded, \\"Love Me Do\\" is the first song on this CD.  The British \\"Love Me Do\\" released as The Beatles' debut single in 1962 features Ringo on drums and no tambourine.  That song peaked on the British charts at #17 and can be found on the \\"Past Masters Volume One\\" CD.  Secondly, the version of \\"Let It Be\\" is the single version with a different guitar solo compared to the Spectorized version on the \\"Let It Be\\" album.
B00068IOWM|5.0|I listened to the entire new recording at U2's official website today(November 17, 2004), and I have one word-- \\"WOW!!!\\"<br /><br />This is the sincerest album yet. Bono sounds so wonderful as always, The Edge sounds absolutely fantastic on his guitar, Adam is still kicking it with his bass lines, and Larry beats a killer drum set as always. U2 has outdone themselves again.<br /><br />This St. Louis, Missouri area fan is forever STILL \\"swinging to the music\\" of the number one rock group in the world(I have been a fan for over 20 years). How To Dismantle An Atomic Bomb is how this group 'reassembled' their place at the throne of the rock society...EOM<br /><br />P.S.--I have ordered this Collector's Edition, and I am very impatiently waiting for its arrival...
B000001FS6|4.0|U2's 1988 release \\"Rattle and Hum\\" captures the music from the film of the same name. If \\"Joshua Tree\\" was their \\"Sgt. Pepper\\" then \\"Rattle and Hum\\" is their White Album. It's ambitious and features some great performances, but is also self-indulgent and bombastic.<br /><br />It's not really a \\"live\\" release in the traditional sense of gathered concert material, or in most cases, concert versions of the hits. This is a hodge-podge of songs. There are live covers, such as \\"Helter Skelter\\" (\\"this is a song Charles Manson stole from the Beatles...we're stealing it back\\") and Bob Dylan's \\"All Along the Watchtower.\\" There are live versions of hits like the excellent \\"Pride\\" and the gospel choir \\"I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For.\\" Bono hits his most strident preachiness on \\"Silver and Gold\\" with the South Africa diatribe and the response to the audience indifferent with \\"Am I buggin' you?<br /><br />Don't mean to bug ya.\\" and his dead-on portrayal of America in \\"Bullet the Blue Sky\\" with the \\"ABC News, Hill Street Blues and preacher from the old time gospel hour\\" and the best line ever of \\"well the God I believe in isn't short of cash, mister!\\"<br /><br />The biggest hit from the disk is \\"Desire\\" with it's edgy three-chord groove and powerful beat. I also enjoy the R&B-style tribute to Billie Holiday \\"Angel of Harlem.\\" There's a guest appearance by B.B. King on \\"When Love Comes to Town\\" and a number of non-live tracks recorded on the road or in sound checks like \\"Van Dieman's Land\\" with vocals by The Edge and \\"Hawkmoon 269.\\"<br /><br />The theme that unites this song cycle is U2 exploring American roots music during their Joshua Tree tour, and exposing both the light and shadows of things they discovered on their journey.
B000000WJZ|5.0|This whole album just blows my mind away. Billy is a tremendous, talented artist who is as good as anyone when it comes to writing a meaningful song. He puts his heart into everything that he writes. All tracks are excellent. My personal favorites are \\"Disarm,\\" \\"Hummer,\\" and \\"Mayonaise.\\"
0486408434|5.0|this book is great! just read it in order without skipping around in the book and u will be able to amaze everyone with card magic on the first day! i've only read through 3/4 of the book and i already know more card ricks than i can remember! easy to learn, easy to preform, near impossible to see how you did it! great way to break the ice or spice up a boring gathering. just make sure to bring a pack of brand new un-opened cards with you so people believe you are not using a trick deck!
B00000FCBC|4.0|\\"Garage Inc.\\" was the only good album put out by Metallica in the 90's. Nothing wrong with hearing Metallica crank out some of their own favorite songs. Not an album for casual Metallica listeners, but a fun one to have.
B00026YO36|5.0|Listening to Lanegan continues to create unique listening experiences.  He comes off as both a wise sage who has come to guide you through some dangerous place, and yet he also comes off as one of the rogues that makes the place dangerous.  He encourages listeners to have patience in life and to wait for their ship to come in (\\"one hundred days\\"), then tempts the audience to give in and give up, to hide, and not care about anything (\\"Bombed\\").  Bubblegum and Field Songs are great albums.  Albums that grow on you (and maybe in you).  Thank You Mark
B0002KVULG|2.0|John Badham's \\"Dracula\\" is still among my favorites of the Dracula legend. Frank Langella added new dimensions to the characters, a smoothness that made the vampire more scary, though just as romantic. Terrific movie and Lucy will creep you out forever. But the DVD treatment is not so wonderful - rather than keeping the contrast deep with real blacks and whites, it looks more washed out than authentic. This may be what the director wanted but it looks too underlit - not the sight of near B&W that was long rumored. I love the movie and will keep the DVD but prepare to be disappointed by the wanting picture quality. For the rest of us, this Dracula is far superior to Coppola's over-the-top fang fest.
B000000HSU|5.0|I can't recommend this album enough - even for just the last five songs.  This is definitely one of the greatest albums ever.
0967851408|5.0|Well, one reviewer tossed his copy in the trash. This is quite unfortunate.<br /><br />I can only hope the garbage man found it and is now living a new life of purpose and power. Perhaps the poor soul who tossed the book away will become his employee some day...<br /><br />This book has that sort of power, if it is actually read and *acted upon*. The author has proof of concept in the accomplishments of his own life.<br /><br />The validation for this system is found with the practice suggestions contained in each module. I humbly suggest that each reader do these practices after reading the associated section. This action will make the difference between genuine personal development and stale philosophical musing.<br /><br />Then join us in a better life. No more need be said. Try it.
0345440900|4.0|I enjoyed reading this book that gave me some guidelines on how to understand my new baby when she comes in March 2005. However, I did noticed that I started to feel stressed out when I was reading it because I was taking too much information in me all at once. I realized that I don't need to follow every word that author has said in the book and learn to use my gut feelings.<br /><br />I definitely agreed with Tracy that babies need routines in their home to help feel secure in their new life. I know it doesn't only apply to babies, but to the whole family as well. A well structure family with a strong foundation tend to come from a family who have routines in their home. I have heard and read so much how researchers and church explaining that families need to set their home in order to have a well secure family.<br /><br />Tracy gave wonderful guidelines on how to set a routine for infants to help them feel secure in their new home and to help parents start off at the right foot.
B00065JTBA|5.0|THIS COLLECTION IS WONDERFUL, IT HAS SONGS THAT WERE RECORDED IN THE 80'S, 90'S AND 2000'S. IT IS THE BEST COLLECTION OF BON JOVI IN A LONG TIME.....
B0000C8AVX|5.0|If you were in 'Nam when this came out, you listened to it.  I think the \\"Band\\" was playing backup, at least the keyboards are up to Garth Hudson's (from the Band) standard.  Which was explosive.  Buy it for Garth Hudson alone,  if not for any other reason.  I really dug this release, and still do.<br /><br />As for Dylan...  I prefer the REALLY early, earthy material... and this.
B00028HBKM|5.0|Non-believers will NOT understand this movie, because \\"their eyes have been blinded.\\" But to the believer it shows the weighty price of our sins and depravity. And makes us realize how much He has given us and how thankful and grateful we need to be for our salvation. Lastly, \\"it pleased God to crush Him,\\" so it probably was worse than this depiction in the movie AND He probably had to endure much more than the average man...He was paying for ALL sin- past, present, future. But the good news comes- He did this for everyone on this earth- past, present, future- accept the Gift that keeps on giving, even after death!
B000000W5N|5.0|Where it belongs on my list, I have no idea.  But the simple fact remains that even more so than the vastly overrated \\"Exile On Main Street\\", this album is a classic in every sense of the word.<br /><br />From \\"Bitch\\", to \\"Can't You Hear Me Knockin\\", the Stones illustrate how sharp their teeth had become; the closest to punk that they'd get in their career.  But \\"Still Got The Blues\\", \\"Wild Horses\\", and \\"Dead Flowers\\" steal the show.  There isn't a weak number on the whole album, and it's more consistant than either \\"Let It Bleed\\" or \\"Exile...\\"<br /><br />Pundits may disagree, but this was the Stones at their peak, and remains their finest hour.
B00065JTBA|5.0|First of all, I'd give this 100 stars if Amazon would let me. I can't express how much I love this box set. <br /> <br />I had high hopes when I heard about this box set. I was worried that this would just contain a bunch of \\"reject songs\\" with no substance. Boy, was I wrong.  <br /> <br />Whenever I buy a CD, I make myself listen to it 3 times before forming any hard opinions. Most people won't \\"love\\" any song the very first time you hear it. It usual takes a few listens which is why I live by my 3-play rule. I'm halfway through my 3rd listening right now, and I really can't find anything negative to write. I may not love every song on this box set, but there are some really, really great ones. Even my less favorite songs aren't really that bad. This set is a unique and interesting journey that includes tunes from the genesis of the band to the present.  <br /> <br />Instead of naming my favorite songs, all I can do is highly recommend this set for any Bon Jovi fan. I'm sure everyone will have his/her own favorites. With all of this new (to the public, at least) material, there is something on this set forr everyone.  <br /> <br />Todd K <br /> <br />P.S. Richie Sambora is a guitar GOD!!
B00005Y7LD|2.0|I hated this album when it came out, and almost 15 years later, I know now that my gut feeling was right.  A big part of it is the songwriting, which is Billy's weakest yet (as of 1990); but then again, he wasn't helped by the extremely session-like dullness of new guitarist Mark-Younger-Smith, who made you wish Steve Stevens hadn't departed.<br /><br />The 'hits' (\\"Prodigal Blues\\", \\"Cradle Of Love\\", and their cover of \\"L.A. Woman\\") are fine, but toothless.  After the pure pop decadence of \\"Vital Idol\\", I suppose I shouldn't have been surprised, but I was.  Skip this one (and Cyberpunk), and stick to his first three albums.
B0002ZYE1Y|5.0|A truly great album. Best of this band.
B000002OX7|5.0|There's a big reason why this album has remained a critical favourite since its release; it's only gotten better over time.<br /><br />Who purists will argue until eternity over which album is better, \\"Tommy\\" or \\"Who's Next\\", but this collection comprises most of their FM-station staples but also a few interesting oddities.<br /><br />\\"I Don't Even Know Myself\\", and another version of \\"Behind Blue Eyes\\" round out the remaster, but they don't detract from the original tracks.  Even in his nadir, the rest of the band was able to coax a few more restrained, subdued drum tracks from Keith Moon, and with all four members firing on all four cylinders with top-notch material, you're left with what's basically a must-own album.
B000055Y12|3.0|THE MOVIE: <br />Topaz is one of those movies that when I watch it I keep checking the time to figure out how much longer I have to watch it. The reason is simple. There are some great scenes and there is an okay story but it takes to long to actually get to the story. The movie picks up for me whem Frederick Stafford goes to New York. I think the movie could have included only a little bit of the things that happened before since we are told that there is a defecting russian (Credits). Then have the russian defector tell what he knows. Finally John Forsyth commissions Frederick Stafford in his hotel room and the movie starts like that. I would take other bits here and there out. It could have been a great hour and 45 minute movie! It would have had it's problems but it would be enjoyable. (Many would disagree that so much could be taken out but this is my opinion.) This brings me to ---- <br /> <br />THE DVD: <br />I like that there is an uncut version on the dvd- the problem is the SHORTER theatrical version should have also been included! It needed the trimming that was done for it's theatrical release! Why didn't they include both versions, or the theatrical version with a deleted scenes archive (prefferably both versions)? The fact that the un tightened version is all that is included adds to what was wrong with the film - even in it's theatrical release. Once again I like the fact the uncut version is included but it shouldn't be ALL that was included. <br /> <br />The documentary rocks. I enjoyed it. It isn't the best documentary in the Universal Hitchcock dvd library but it rocks just the same. <br /> <br />I like that they included the three different endings as well...  <br /> <br />The trailer isn't his best but is worth a look as well. <br /> <br />The other extras are rather standard but it is nice to have them anyway.
B0002XDODU|3.0|I don't know whether it was me that I'm asking too much or what, but I felt rather disappointed after listening to \\"Reise, Reise\\". After \\"the grand \\"Mutter\\", and two great albums prior to this like \\"Herzeleid\\" and \\"Sehnsucht\\", I had my expectations really up high for this one. Rammstein seemed to climb release after release improving on each one of them, creating something unique and, at the same time, innovating.  <br /> <br />But \\"Reise, Reise\\" lacks of all the good things that abunded in the previous efforts: power, hard rockin' riffs and speed, songs that go straight to the point the type of song that will push you to the edge, the song that will make you dance, or shake your head or move your feet. The album lacks of a killer song such as \\"Sehnsucht\\", \\"Du Hast\\", \\"Zwitter\\", \\"Adios\\", \\"Sonne\\", or the danceable \\"Der Meister\\" and \\"Das Modell\\" and stays too much with mid tempos and ballads. In general, I found it monotonous and needing of more layers and catchy grooves and rhtyhms. And I'm not saying that Ramstein sold out, is not a matter of going un metal or crap like that, it's just that the songwriting does not get to the level of \\"Herzeleid\\", \\"Sehsucht\\" and \\"Mutter\\". Slow paced and darker, in general, and even the dozen of listens I gave to the album still don't convince me. <br /> <br />The album opens with \\"Reise, Reise\\", a semi-ballad, that is nothing compared in power and strength to \\"Meinherz brennt\\", \\"Wolf ihl...? and is far beyond \\"Sehnsucht\\". And you have to wait to the fourth song to listen at least to an attempt to a heavy fast song that is \\"Keine tell\\". But I think Rammstein failed in the attempt of creating a heavy album. If you compare the first five songs of all their albums, you'll understand what I'm talking about. <br /> <br />It has some moments of brilliance, but the overall result is flat, without layers. And if the album didn't have enough speed, and you wanted a brutal closure, you'll find three consecutive ballads, yes, three in row, to finish the record. And I'm not saying that i dont like Rammstein's ballads, but the album ends very softly, in an already soft album. <br /> <br />The first song, \\"REISE, REISE\\" is a semi ballad, with a cool riff, but very tranquill in my opinion to open an album. The second song, \\"MEIN TELL\\" is another mid tempo but more interesting, with a cool, catchy and dark riff, the kind of riff that all fans will like, and the album's highlight, without a doubt. The third song, \\"DALAI LAMA\\" is one of my favorites. Yeah, another mid tempo, but gets very interesting with a screaming heavy riff and a nice solo. The fourth song \\"KEINE LUST\\" speeds up a little bit, and has an interesting  jumping riff, but thats' it and the song gets lost in the intrincate drummin and needing of consistency.. The fifth song, \\"LOS\\", is a semi-fast song, with acoustic guitars. Nothing special and monotonous. The sixth song \\"AMERIKA\\", is very sympathetic. The kind of song that is different than the rest for its happy riffs. Very catchy. \\"MOSKOU\\" is the seventh. A fast song, very dark, with children singing the choruses. But needs more of the heavy riffin of \\"Ich Will\\", for example. \\"MORGENSTR\\", the eight song, is an attempt of a fast song than turns into a heavy mid tempo. Another interesting song with a jumpin' rhtyhtm, that has one of the album's best arrangements in the middle, but still lacking of speed. Then you have the three ballads, \\"STEIN UH STEIN\\", \\"OHNE DICH\\" and \\"AMOUR\\". The first one, a little darker with a heavy chorus, the second would be a ballad literally, and the third a calm song witha romantic chorus. Very epical, with a lot of attitude and Ramstein's touch of quality in the three of them. <br />For what you're read before, the album has good and bad moments, many times falling in the intrascendency of not being capable of creating new cool and catchy riffs but, in general, the album is well written.  <br /> <br />But what is most annoying, is that i've waited three years for a newRammstein record, and I'll have to wait three more for their next one. I love all their albums, but I'm sorry to say that \\"Reise, Reise\\" is an excuse for selling CDs and touring, again. <br />
0440418569|5.0|...that some readers with shuttered minds would call this work of fiction a \\"lure into satanism\\".    I am an adult, and thought this series was delightful, marvelously written and wonderful interpretation of \\"Paradise Lost\\".  (Milton was not exactly luring people into \\"satanism\\" in the 17th century.)     If you are feel drawn to \\"satanism\\" by this book, then perhaps you need to take a close look at your own faith.  I once read a book called Galatians, which talked about the fruit of the spirit being love.  Hmmm.  Who draws a more brighter picture of love--Philip Pullman and his depiction of love between a person and their daemon/soul or the reviewer and their excoriation of this book series?
B000024D4R|5.0|Released in 1977, Animals caught the average Pink Floyd fan off guard. The cover alone demands attention. Considered by some to be a \\"cult album\\", Animals seems to be targeted for those who are more artistically inclined. You must use your ears and imagination more than your eyes. It's a concept album but Water's demands his listeners attention with his visceral attacks on society and polticians.  <br /> <br />Animals is an important bridging piece of art rock. It's is not necessarily a peak for Pink Floyd, but is not to be missed. Borrowing from the long pieces of it's predacessor, Animals is one of those quality over quantity albums. It's also a sign of what was to come with The Wall's poltical bitterness and psychedelic isolation. <br /> <br />Animals is probably never going to be as highly sought after as cult pieces like Meddle because it lacks the pop-friendly formula. But as abstract as they are, even black sheep deserve appreciation. <br />
0670033693|5.0|Craig Johnson's first novel is alive with the magic and intellect of his characters - a true balance by all standards - and is filled with a love of the Wyoming landscape and it's people.  Mr. Johnson especially takes great care in crafting American Indian characters with integrity and depth, characters that have strong and true connections to their homeland and culture, something often overlooked in Western literature.  This book may be a piece of great fiction, but it is also brimming with pure poetry.  You won't be able to put it down.
0743454529|3.0|I love Jodi Picoult (I've read most of her books!)  I really liked this one too, however, it didn't end well. Don't get me wrong - I wasn't waiting for a fairytail happy ending but this ending just didn't wrap the book up well!  On the other hand, life is not predidctable and this is just how real life might have turnned out!   <br />Up until the very end - this may have been my favorite Jodi Picoult book - but definitely not after finishing the book!
B00005V3Z4|3.0|I watched this movie and when it was over.... nothing. No deep thought provoking, earth-shattering wonder. It was just a movie.<br /><br />A teenage boy with paranoid delusions can see into the future. He gets his prophecies from a dude in a psycho bunny suit who he ends up shooting. With special effects similar to The Deep or The Abyss, watery auras extend from people's chests and lead them through life. Drew Barrymore plays an English teacher who tries to do things her way and gets canned.<br /><br />The world ends on A certain day as told by the rabbit, but time only stops for Darko because he does not leave his room. A piece of falling airplane falls through the roof and kills him. Of course that sets time back a month and everyone knows they have 30 days or so to live again.<br /><br />All in all the flick was OK, but I wouldn't watch it again. Nor would I want to listen to Tears for Fears in the soundtrack.<br /><br />Patrick Swayze plays a whacko who has a VHS set that helps people handle their fear. He later gets nabbed as a psycho with a child porn ring that is run from his house.
B000063UR2|1.0|This movie is ridiculously lame. I will never watch it again. the only good thing about it is how it 'looks' the costumes and stuff are nice. They barely talk in the movie and the story will put you to sleep (since there isnt much of one anyway). I just don't see the point. This is probably one of my least favorite movies of all time. This movie is barfy and I hate it.
B00063EMJ6|5.0|If a person was just getting into Neil this would be pretty good. Although Decade or Live Rust would be just as good. I would probably take Down By The River, Cowgirl In The Sand, Harvest Moon, and Helpless off of this and replace them with Sugar Mountain, Cortez The Killer, Powderfinger, and Thrasher [or Campaigner]. But that is just personal taste. <br /> <br />Long live Neil.
B0002XDODU|5.0|When listened Reise Reise for the first time, i was thinkin to give it a 4 stars. But hey, i never gave a R+ album 4 stars before, how could i this time. Then i listened 2 times more and oh yeah, now 5 stars. Well, this album may suprise people who has only Mutter or another single R+ album. But if u have 'em all you just love 'em, you appreciate 'em u will love this album. If u call yourself a true   R+ fan, then you should be able look at this album from a different view and appreciate their art. Because this album may sound different then the others well it is not an excuse not to give this album 5 stars. My suprise was the cover and the content of the album. From the color of the album cover(orange), i thought that it will be slower than the dark images of the previous albums or less sinister. But just the opposite, it is very heavy, i mean really heavy and deadly. Like every other R+ song, they will sound as good as or better than the album during the live shows which i cant wait now. Here are my thoughts on the songs: <br />1) REISE REISE: Good intro song, it will remind u some old R+ songs(u find which ones) 4/5 <br />2)MEIN TEIL: my favorite song. Heavy, deadly and sinister. About a german cannibal. I love it...5/5 <br />3)DALAI LAMA: Great song, classic, very nice chorus. It is very close to an old song from Sehnsucht album. Find it 5/5 <br />4)KEINE LUST: One of the heavier and faster songs of the album, nice chorus and riffs...5/5 <br />5)LOS: Slower than the others but good acoustic and blues rhythm and lyrics makes it really good. u listen it more, u ll like it more, very different R+ song 4/5 <br />6)AMERIKA: many people will think that this is an political song, guess what, its not. It is just about Amerika the way it is. Coca-Cola, wonderbra,mickey mouse and freedom. Just a good R+ song. It is stuck in my head, singin continuously the chorus. 5/5 <br />7)MOSKAU: Song is about Moscow. Sounds like Spieluhr from the Mutter. Great song with some russianlyrics and kids singin the chorus. Very good. 5/5 <br />8)MORGENSTERN: Sounds like old R+. Pretty good.Memorable chorus 4/5 <br />9)STEIN UM STEIN: Slow, but nice. My less favorite but still good, 4/5 <br />10)OHNE DICH: Slow but classic ballad or whatever u call it. Till sound excellently dramatic and beautiful. Love this song...love ittt..5/5 <br />11)AMOUR: Similar to Ohne Dich, slow and cool.  <br /> <br />Last words: If you are a R+ fan, you should buy this, if you are not a fan or never listened them before, still buy it, this is ART, not a waste of money.
B00005NB0H|5.0|Well, i have listened to the who all my life.  i have only started liking them a year ago.  i always thought they were a weak sauce rock band but then i saw them on the kids are alright and it amazed me how talented they were.  I then I bought this album which is superb i think.  I first really digged the tommy cd but they are both really great.  i would recommend this cd to anyone who is interested in the who.  this album shows how witty, talented,and rockin' they really were.
0670033693|5.0|I was lucky enough to get my hands on an advance copy and this novel is absolutely, hands down the best and most readable book I've had the good fortune to enjoy in as long as I can remember.  Craig Johnson writes about the West providing the reader with vivid imagery and even more vivid, real, and well-developed characters. The plot will keep you guessing until the very end. This page-turner is a book you can't put down (at least not willingly!)     An absolute MUST READ.
B0002Z9HT8|3.0|When the DVD started I was thrilled....but then....This is missing ...that is missing....Yes I read the booklet in the package. I have the songs missing in my living room...I used 2 video tape machines (1 for MTV feed and 1 for ABC feed) back in 1985. I find it hard to believe that my homemade video is the only one in exsistence. Guess we didn't look too hard. As far as the price it was good...but I would have paid $30.00 more to get the whole thing even without the \\"Led Zepplin\\" immatation
B0001NBMBC|2.0|This isnt the Slipknot I remember and was totally amazed by in 1999.  I know people say \\"Its good for change.\\"  \\"They grew up musically\\".  Well, they may have grown up, but they grew out of their heavy sound and insane music.  Seeing Slipknot live in 1999 was like a blast of metal and just the wildest live show.  Then they hit ozzfest, more kids liked them...and they slowly lost what they originally started with.  The music was very good with their first CD.  This CD sounds like they've gotten too far apart as friends, musicians and a band during their side projects and their little \\"away\\" time.  Joey's drums sound horrible in this recording, you cannot hear them, i always thought he was a great drummer but he just doesnt show it in this album.  The guitars are trying too hard to fit in with whats popular now, Corey sounds like he took his Stone Sour songs and made them into Slipknot with the way he sings through the whole CD.  I like melodic metal, I prefer it over any kind of metal, but it just doesnt work with Slipknot.  It sounds like they could have let go of 3 members on this album.  You barely hear samples or DJing, the 2 extra drummers are mainly something to look at during a live show now.  Its just not what it was, if you're a diehard Slipknot fan, or just a angry teen who thinks they know metal and \\"Hardcore\\" (you know NOTHING about hardcore if you this this album is), or if you just think no one understands you, listen to this because i cannot understand what happened to Slipknot.  Too much publicity, too much rockstar bulls**t, and too much of the evil OZZFEST.
0792844602|5.0|There are films that are classics since the day they are released. This film is one of those. Zoltan Korda shows his elegance and skills presenting us  a typical adventure.<br /><br />Based on the novel by A. W. E Mason, it is the story of young Harry Faversahn born and raised to follow the military life like all his ancestors. Pity that his father is an obssesed of the glories of the Empire, and that his friends bored the child telling stories about battles, slaughters and Baklava (the scene with C. Aubrey Smith explaining the battle with a pineaple and some walnuts is one of the best in the story of cinema).<br /><br />But Harry is a good boy so he joins the army, trains all day and even has time to conquer beautiful Ethne. With that Harry decides to leave the army, but  good things do not last forever, so in the evening of his engagement party his regiment is call to arms. To Egypt to fight against the wicked Egyptian rebels. But Harry refuses and so his former best friends send him three feathers, a sophisticated way to call him a coward. But the fourth, ah! the fourth one is the most terrible of all because is Ethne who gives it to him.<br /><br />So our hero is an outcast, nodoby loves him, nodoby cares for him. And Harry proving that after all he is  a Favershan embarks to Egypt to save his comrades. Disguised as a mute native he saves them all. Crosses the dessert, saves Durrance (who is in love with Ethne too), saves Willoughby and Burroughs from a dreadful prision and evidently gives back each of the four feathers.<br /><br />The locations and the scenes are espectacular. But also the dialogues. The cast is superb, and propbaly you will end watching the film while humming Rule Britannia.<br /><br />No adaptation done after has ever reached its level so do not waste your time with others. This is the version.
B000006TRV|5.0|Even though I find it to be quite a bummer, I agree that The Wall is easily one of the most compelling rock albums ever produced.  I first heard it when I was 17, and didn't have a clue what it was all about. Still, I was blown away by just the sheer awesome SOUND of it. There was nothing else like it in 1979, and also, at that time I was not familiar with Pink Floyd's music, so it was completely new to me. Depressing as it may be, it is impossible to rate it any lower. It is an all time classic rock album.
B00005JNDX|1.0|Prepare to be disappointed.  The first film was tolerable entertainment, the sequel is boring offensive trash.  Ploddingly written, with little wit and a barrage of expletives, this is a complete waste of your time.  It is revolting in its stereotyping of the Thai people - how misguided is it to have Bridget, the ultimate fantasy figure, compare her problems to the real ones of a Thai woman, in jail, a prostitute, beaten and forced to take heroin by her pimp?  Is the child sex trade in Thailand good material for a 'joke', as occurs when Bridget is on a plane seated next to a beer-swiling boor?  Wake up audience!  This is not harmless light entertainment, it is drearily cynical garbage. <br />* <br />Aside from the racial slurs, there is the predictable sexual stereotyping.  Bridget's suitors are rich, intelligent, and, especially in Darcy's case, powerful.  Bridget is less than rich, less than intelligent, and a victim to the point of feeling 'unworthy' - much of the alleged humour is prised from her acute embarassment.  The men use their powers to gain Bridget's affection, which is largely equated with sexual favours, and dreams of marriage and babies.  Her career is belittled, any success seen as accidental, theirs presented as important, glamorous, and well deserved.  Of course it's possible to milk some laughs from all this, but haven't we seen all this many times before?  Isn't it tedious?   <br />* <br />Grant has his character down pat, and he provides the few genuine laughs.  Renee is made to look as unattractive as possible - one wonders whether the men behind the film have deliberately done this, again quite cynically - all very well to say it's 'brave' of the actress, but why are the men presented normally.  Colin Firth - why is he bothering with this?  The minor characters, especially Bridget's so-called friends, are repulsive and unbelievable - her parents are similarly embodiments of a single joke repeated ad nauseam. <br />* <br />In terms of basic plotting, it is also very weak.  For the first half of the film it's only Darcy and Bridget.  He is all wonderful, she is all paranoia.  It takes Cleaver, Hugh Grant, to add any drama, hackneyed those this may be.  All this provoked many a yawn in the cinema audience. <br />* <br />Don't be fooled by those fond of the first film - this is despicable rubbish.
B000002OX5|5.0|I've had copies of this for years, and I loved this album way before the extra tracks were added as part of the CD. Absolutely my favorite Who, and the one that I always reach for when I want to hear some Who. Don't overlook it just because it may be a little older than some of their other classic albums, you'll be missing out on one of the most enjoyable albums of the 60's.
0060730552|2.0|This book has been lauded as inspirational and life changing, but trying to wade through the technical mountaineering jargon is a chore and at its core this is a simple story about a thrill seeker who had a terrible fall but wound up no worse for the wear. Joe was out climbing shortly after this incident that supposedly changed his life. How bad could it have really been? An excruciating read.
B000024D4R|5.0|I'm sorry, but 5 stars is an insult to this unbelievable album!  I bought it on vinyl when I was a kid, and now on CD I listen to it over and over and over again.  30 years later, and this album does NOT tire!  I love it. <br /> <br />This is easily Pink Floyd's best album ever . . . and that's saying a lot, especially since DSOTM is such an amazing classic, and The Wall, of course, is another classic.  But there's something about Animals -- 3 long songs bookended by 2 short ones -- which is the absolute best format for such epics as this.
B00004Z459|1.0|There are exactly three bands that sound awesome with a turntablist. They are: <br />1: Blindspott (A New Zealand band, import there self titled cd if you can.) <br />2: Deftones <br />3: Incubus <br />Any other band who tries to incorporate a turntablist into their music is going to fail miserably plainly because of the high watermark set by the aforementioed bands. Not only do they have much better turntablists, but their lyrics ACTUALLY F*CKING MEAN SOMETHING, it's not just about how painful it is to have millions of record sales and 20 cars in their driveway but their mummy and daddy don't love them. F*ck Linkin Park and any c*nts who try to copy them or listen to them. I'm off to listen to sum real tunes.
B000002JEV|5.0|Led Zeppelin's \\"BBC Sessions\\" is a great treasure trove of live material the group recorded for the BBC between 1969 and 1971. Jimmy Page, Robert Plant, John Paul Jones and John Bonham were one of the rock world's greatest live acts, as this live set clearly shows. Granted, several songs are repeated, like \\"Communication Breakdown\\" (3 versions), \\"You Shook Me\\" and \\"I Can't Quit You Baby\\" (2 versions), but who's complaining? One of Zeppelin's live trademarks was never to perform any song the exact same way, so each version of \\"Communication Breakdown,\\" for example, differs somewhat from the other versions, as the band wanted to jam on it in a different, fresh way each time. And it works. Other goodies include a smokin' version of \\"Travelling Riverside Blues,\\" and a brilliant performance of Zeppelin's signature song, \\"Stairway To Heaven.\\" I also love the band's extended workouts on display here, including an 18 1/2 minute jam on \\"Dazed And Confused\\" (with Page getting some truly wild sounds out of his guitar), and the nearly 14-minute blast through \\"Whole Lotta Love,\\" in which Zeppelin also insert some blues favorites like \\"Boogie Chillin'\\" and \\"That's Alright Mama.\\" So, what are you waiting for, Zepheads---\\"BBC Sessions\\" totally deserves a place in your Led Zeppelin collection.
B000002HFU|5.0|RIP to a true innovator. Thank you for all of your gifts. Brooklyn Forever.
B0002NRRAG|5.0|This is the cd that I thought Norah Jones made, given all the hype (which of course wasn't her fault).  It has nothing in common with the Jones CD so don't look for that.  A great jazz album which, as oft remarked, at times sounds incredibly like Billie Holiday.  The cover of Cohen's Dance Me to the End of Love is perhaps the best Cohen cover I've heard (except perhaps Warnes' Joan of Arc).  The sound is somewhat mysterious but after 3 or 4 listenings, I got used to it. But if you're heavy on the bass like me, I advise that you turn it down.
6305558167|1.0|Some years ago I got dragged to see this movie. The next day I mentioned to my boss I had just seen what might be the worst movie ever made. His reply was that no, he had been forced to sit through the worst he had ever seen, mine couldn't be as bad. To make a long story short, we had both seen Excalibur.
B000669GAI|5.0|The question, has any artist NOT released a Best of/Greatest Hits, is becoming more and more difficult to answer, as Epic/Sony - the recently departed label of Pearl Jam - squeeze blood from a turnip, first with a 2-disk b-sides collection, 'Lost Dogs' (2003), and now with this greatest hits collection. <br /> <br />My cynicism aside, as a fairly heavy PJ fan since the beginning, I can tell the passing fan that this is a great collection, as was Stone Temple Pilot's compilation released last fall.  I can only think of a few great songs that did not make the cut (\\"Oceans\\", \\"Tremor Christ\\", \\"Crazy Mary\\", \\"Thin Air\\", \\"Love Boat Captain\\"). <br /> <br />The set is divided between an \\"Upside\\" disk (i.e., faster, harder tunes) and \\"Downside\\" disk (i.e., lower, more acoustic tunes).  Included with radio favorites are strong album cuts and non-album cuts (e.g., \\"Yellow Ledbetter\\", \\"State of Love and Trust\\"). <br /> <br />Furthermore, I always thought the first record 'Ten' (1991) sounded far more polished than the rest of their records, and if you agree, you will be pleased to find that \\"Alive\\", \\"Once\\", \\"Black\\", and \\"Even Flow\\" (although the latter is not formally credited as such) have been unpolished (i.e., reproduced) by Brendan O'Brien (producer of their second record) without substantively changing the tunes.  (And PJ was far more successful in this endeavor than U2 was in trying to \\"fix\\" the 'Pop' tunes on 'Best of 1990-2000'.)
B0000020C4|5.0|True to its \\"dream cast\\" title, this album showcases the best talents to ever play the major roles in this long-running musical.  The performances here are from the concert staged at the Royal Albert Hall, and as such, are much more exciting than your standard-fare recording.  The number featuring the different actors from around the world playing Valjean is one performance to look forward to, in addition, of course, to Lea Salonga's captivating performance as Eponine (this recording has the best On My Own performance you'll ever hear: perfect emotion, perfect voice -- perfect delivery!)   <br /> <br />If you can, get the DVD/VHS version.  If you're a first-timer to this musical, get this album along with the Complete Symphonic Recording.  Don't bother getting either the Original London Recording or Original Broadway Recording; you'll just be wasting your money.
B00005NGAL|4.0|This is more or less a pure entertainment musical; minimal storyline tying together mostly good musical and dance numbers. I wouldn't really try to read anything more into it than that. <br /> <br />I had earlier gotten the 2 video version and was somewhat disappointed by the sound; you can barely hear the cast during 'The Naming of Cats' and in several spots the music overpowers the voices. Turning up the volume on your TV gives you quite a bit of static and popping instead of clarity. <br />This seems to be from either a bad master VHS or simply how they did this version; they recorded a 90 piece orchestra (as Webber mentions most theatres use about 16 pieces), then the singers, then shot the choreography but didn't use that vocal recording. So really you're hearing 2 recordings dubbed onto the dancing and in spots it really shows. <br /> <br />On the DVD however the sound is much better. Most of the songs are very clear ('Naming of Cats' is still very low)and only in a few spots do you notice sound effects that got forgotten from video to DVD. The picture is slightly better as well but the improved sound is the real reason to get DVD over VHS.  <br /> <br />The major addition to the bonus features is about 7 ten minute or so interveiws with the original production staff; it makes a nice contrast to how the show is now and what it went through to even be shown as a musical. <br /> <br />My only major complaint about the DVD is the very flimsy case; basically it is a tri-folded plastic sheet with 2 thin DVD/CD rounds and a small booklet. <br /> <br />As a final thought all you married men out there probably shouldn't pay too close attention to the dancing during the 'Macavity' number. <br /> <br /> <br />
B0000C9ZLD|4.0|\\"Is This It\\" was a revelation.  It wasn't the savior of Rock N' Roll as some would have wanted, but it changed the musical landscape.  Bands like The White Stripes, Interpol, The Killers, and The Hives have found their own outlet.  Now those bands that I just listed don't all sound the same, but they share the same retro rock roots.  For The Strokes the pressure of releasing their second album is enormous.  For all the praise they received for \\"Is This It\\" there's a great deal of hatred for their particular style.  Those that hate them would love this album to flop.<br /><br />Fortunately for The Strokes people probably will not change their minds because of this record.  The Strokes' fans will love it and that's what counts.  \\"Room On Fire\\" clocks in at around 30 minutes, so it's a very short album.  For a band like \\"The Strokes\\" that's perfect.  Personally I have to be in a certain mood to listen to The Strokes.  Over the past week I've been listening non-stop.  \\"Between Love & Hate\\" is probably my favorite track right now.  \\"Reptilia,\\" \\"What Ever Happened\\" and \\"Under Control\\" are great as well.<br /><br />I highly recommend Room On Fire for any fan of the first album.  The question is where will they go from here?  Also, for anyone that really likes The Strokes check out Interpol.  Interpol has a different feel and is a bit darker but they're an excellent band.
B000023VR6|5.0|I cant believe i havent done a review on this yet. yo this is one of the best albums since pac died. if you dont have this you are not a rap fan. you \\"MUST\\" have this in yo collection. and dont forget that pac cd peace!!!!
B0002858YS|5.0|This is easily one of the most satisfying releases of the year.  The grouped formed out of mutual admiration of Oasis.  When you are listening to Hot Fuss Oasis would not seem like such an inspiration, but the wall of guitars leaves no doubt.<br /><br />If I have any complaints about the album it would be the last 3 tracks.  The album starts off at such a great pace the end is a bit lackluster.  The first 8 tracks are absolutely amazing and the finals songs are good, but the momentum grinds to a halt by the time you get to the final track.  One note, there is a slight difference in the UK and US version's of the album.  \\"Indie Rock n Roll\\" is not included in the US release.<br /><br />Overall this is one of the must have releases of 2004.
B0006284JQ|5.0|Since 1999, Britney Spears has been the pop sensation of our generation. She has been in the industry for 5 years (maybe more). Many people have said that Britney's Greatest Hits album seems premature. I do not agree. Unlike Britney's contemporaries, she has accomplished alot. Countless Top Ten singles and four albums debuting at #1 and Britney is barely 23 years old. Even Christina, Mandy, and Jessica could not release a greatest hits album as appropriately and timely as Britney. I believe that the timing was right.  <br /> <br />Britney is taking a two-year hiatus (whether we want her to or not is a different story), but regardless, we cannot deny the impact she has made in the pop world and more importantly our generation of music-listeners. In an ever-changing industry, Britney has always been ahead of the game. Evolve with the times and molding the styles and conventions of music to suit her sound.  <br /> <br />Everyone knows ...Baby One more Time, everyone knows Oops!... I Did it Again, everyone knows Toxic. We also find ourselves singing to her infectious tunes such as Sometimes, Stronger, and (You Drive Me) Crazy. We also find ourselves dancing to her Me Against the Music and I'm A Slave 4 U. I do not think we can say the same about Britney's contemporaries.  <br /> <br />This album has almost all of Britney's singles (most of which were #1 singles), as well as three new songs. Regardless of whether or not you like her three new songs, this Greatest Hits album will make a great edition to any CD collection, fan or not. I love it and everyone I know who owns it loves it. This album is very timely like I said earlier. It closes the first chapter in Britney's career (hopefully not the last).  <br /> <br />If you do not have Britney's other albums but like her music, get this greatest hits. If already have some of Britney's other albums, but do not want to shuffle through all of them then you should get the greatest hits. If you're a devoted fan... well you probably got it the first day it came out! Of all of Britney's albums, this album reflects our past 5 years with Britney; it reflects Britney's evolution in music and image, and it reflects Britney as the most influential popstar of our times. Britney Spears Greatest Hits: My Prerogative is like looking through a yearbook. The album is worth it.
0375422307|5.0|Satrapi's tale evokes a wide range of emotions from the reader. I was charmed by her excitement to get Western \\"contraband\\" smuggled into Iran that featured American popular music. At the same time, the tragic losses that are experienced by the oppressive government in Iran- losses of both individual freedoms and lives of those who dissent- remind one of the gravity of the situation that Satrapi grew up in.<br /><br />The art is simple and black and white, which for me reinforced the perspective of our youthful heroine. Still, the images were adept at conveying emotion when they needed to; the rare use of large panels made the few that do appear seem very large and powerful.<br /><br />The highest compliments I can pay \\"Persepolis\\" is that I would recommend it to friends who ordinarily do not read graphic novels, and that I could not put it down once I started it. A simple story in the best sense of the world- that anyone can identify with it and enjoy it.
B000000WZ4|4.0|Ultra is the Depeche Mode album that almost never got made. After the Devotional tour, front-man Dave Gahan slipped further into a drug addiction that would almost cost him his life -- the singer flat-lined after a drugs overdose; Fletch suffered a nervous breakdown; and the band's talented musician and in-house producer, Alan Wilder quit after bitter feuds and disagreements -- a loss that is still heavily felt by many fans. <br /> <br />In 1996 the band reluctantly entered the studio with producer Tim Simenon to work on their 9th album. For many fans as well as for the band this was an uncertain period. A year later however many fears were to be silenced. <br /> <br />Ultra is a decent enough album, especially considering the circumstances leading up to its recording. It sees a return of the electronic sound more associated with the band after dark blues rock of Songs of Faith and Devotion. It would be erroneous however to say that this album doesn't suffer from its share of filler; the two interludes Uselink and Jazz Thieves for instance are totally superfluous and demonstrate song writer Gore's laziness more than anything else. <br /> <br />The edgy Barrel of a Gun proved to be a satisfying lead off single. Gahan's voice here sounds suitably strained while delivering such self-pitying, self-deprecating lines as \\"Do you mean this horny creep/Set upon weary feet/Who looks in need of sleep/That doesn't come\\". Listening to this song one can't help but wonder how close these sentiments may have been to those of the battered and jaded singer. It has also been suggested that the sibling in Sister of Night -- another strong track -- is actually a reference to drugs and Gahan's decline. <br /> <br />It's No Good, the strongest single from this album, sees Depeche Mode on classic electro-pop form. This still remains a favourite track today. <br /> <br />A Depeche Mode album would not be complete without a couple of Gore led songs, this time the tracks are Home and The Bottom Line. The former a single and the latter has its moments, but is nothing to write home about. <br /> <br />After the purgatory of Barrel of a Gun, the accusations of Useless, and the resignations of Sister of Night, the album closes with a feeling of new found freedom and emotional liberation. In the country tinged Freestate Gahan advises: \\"Let yourself go/Let your spirit grow\\", and declaring in Insight that \\"...the spirit of love/Is rising within me\\". <br /> <br />Perhaps not quite the glorious phoenix some would have hoped for, this album however did see the band rise from ashes to produce a very worthwhile and listen-able album that, so far, is standing the test of time. Not bad for an album that almost never got made and with a front-man who died.
0393312836|5.0|This book is a landmark, legend, and icon.  Burgess wrote in 1963 and it has been an iconoclasitc classic ever since.  It's an exciting, innovative literary adventure that I think everyone should experience. <br /> <br />Many people are put off by the slang that Burgess wrote this book in.  In his introduction, Burgess said that this would happen because people 'are scared, rightly, of language.'  I think that this book isn't too hard to read and the slang/nadsat makes the book more exciting and intelligent.  This is one book written in the English language that will stretch your mind.  However, once you have gotten the slang down, this book isn't difficult to read at all. <br /> <br />
B0002Z9HT8|5.0|Though an incomplete historical record, this set amazingly captures the bands who captured my heart in my teen years. A beautific Paul Weller, a stunningly slim Geldof, the terribly mulleted but handsome and oh-so-talented Bono, and maybe most heartbreaking, the golden-throated, sultry Freddie Mercury at his very best. The performances are among the most heartfelt I've seen on film -- with U2 being the clear standout (at least to me). Yes, the clothes are dated and the hairdos atrocious - but the music soars and the crowd at Wembley never ceases to take my breath away: so energized, so enthused...so young -- as was I, as were the artists, and as was the idea that a couple of concerts could change the world. For a moment in time, it was all true.     And thanks to this DVD, I can relive that moment all over again.

0395389496|1.0|Have we learned nothing from the 60's and 70's studies of childrens' books? Studies that showed that most children's books, and textbooks, had boys as the heroes, as the active ones, while girls and women were relegated to minor 'helping' roles.  I was about to buy this book for my 5 year old granddaughter, but when I read that it was just another story about a boy and his quest for whatever, I decided not to buy it.  Where are the millennium's great stories with girls as heros?  About a girl's quest for knowledge and wisdom? Oh bother! I won't be shelling out bucks for this one.  How sad.<br /><br />Barbara Hendryson, California poet and writer.
B00005Q4CS|5.0|This movie has truely touched me, despite the graphic nature of this movie, I feel that all teenagers should be shown this, it will jolt them into reality and realize that drugs will just ruin you life.  Being a teenager myself, I know that this movie will change some people. it changed me.
B00007BK2N|3.0|I was actually pretty disappointed in this movie.  I expected it to be more vibrant and exciting, but it just wasn't.  The music is great, obviously, but it just isn't enough to make this movie excellant.  It could have been lots better. <br /> <br />Steve Coogan is better than the movie.  His character(Tony Wilson) isn't all that interesting or likable, but Coogan does what he can with the role.  The other actors are reasonably good too, so the movie isn't unbearable. <br /> <br />There are brief flashes of genius in this movie and they should not be forgotten.  This movie is very different and may appeal some viewers more than others.  Those with an open and receptive mind will probably like at least some parts of this movie, however, people who are used to more Amercanised movie-making may not get this movie at all and hate it.
6301954947|5.0|OK, if you're here because you can't find the Waterloo DVD on the U.S. market as of 11/04, you're not alone.  The DVD has been available in Europe for awhile now, and I'm used to some things coming out in England or Europe first before the American market.  So what the heck is the delay?  C'mon already; with the academic Napoleonic field kicking out some of its best work in years, this movie would definitely sell and sell. <br /> <br />Oh, and according to some information on IMDB, the English version of the movie (just over 3 hours, I think) is the longest version extant.  Sources there say no director's cut is possible...But who really knows? <br /> <br />Also, for the truly desparate, you can find Waterloo on DVD in a kind of video-to-disc transfer, without chapters, region-free...Check eBay.  Don't expect anything at all crisp.  Also, this version sprawls over two discs.  Mine actually had a sticker on it indicating that it was produced by Columbia Pictures, but again, who really knows?
0393035158|3.0|Do you remember? Shortly after Sept. 11th, a few media pundits and academics began to realize that al Quada - the group that levelled the worst terrorists the world over - were bound together by one thing: a passionate belief that the Koran, interpreted literally, calls for an unqualified Jihad. Remember? Remember the controversey that insued, and how they were curtly told to be more 'sensitive' and 'respectful' to Islam? Truth be told religion has been the primary impetus in such deadly conflicts as Bosnia, Ireland, Israel/Palestine, Kurdistan, Rwanda and others. So why is criticism of religion as impetus to violence not allowed to be aired in our PC culture? Enter Sam Harris.  <br /> <br />Harris's view is that religion should be talked about as an impetus to violence. The difference, he says, between faith (belief in something that can't be demonstrated) and reason (beleif in soemthing where argument or evidence can be adduced) is the difference between stopping the conversation and thriving on conversation. If two groups believe in two different gods and that only their group, rather than the other, is the chosen and important one, what arguments can be ofered? None. As often happens, there is little to do but kill the unredeemable other group. (See any of the countries listed in paragraph one.) When two people disagree on something where evidence or argument is available, though, the tendency is more often to engage in a clash of IDEAS, rather than FORCE. <br /> <br />As if this wasn't controversial enough, Harris tries to explode the myth that religions have become more tolerant and accepting of things like science on their own accord - an internal change. Harris argues persuasively that had science not falsified six-day creationism, had medical advances not shown that illnesses had to do with biology rather than demonic posession, had philosophy not chipped holes in religious theology, (etc.) religion would still be where it was - in the dark ages. Historically, this is hardly an exaggeration. From belief in evolution to accepting new social trends (that later become the norm), religion has an embarrasing history of being the last to drag its feet kicking and screaming towards modernity.  <br /> <br />There are several problems I had with the book though. The first is that Harris leaves us with the firm impression that he thinks non-belief would automatically lead to less violence. What about the French Revolution (where atheism was prevalent) or the Soviet experience (where it was a virtual membership requirement)? Harris's answer is that those are faiths too, and therefore do not damage his thesis. In science, this is called \\"fitting the evidence to the theory,\\" when it should be vice versa. It DOES affect the thesis, by demonstrating that even if belief in god were eradicated, us humans can find plenty to kill over (and the fact that zealotry is easy, even without theology).  <br /> <br />Further, Harris notes that those who say that religion has produced more good in the world than non-belief has, are missing a detail: Of course that is true! Religion has been around infinitely longer than non-belief. If non-belief, he says, had the lengthy history that religion has enjoyed, it is possible that as many good things would have been produced under secularism's watch. But can't this criticism apply also to Harris's assertion that most of the world's wars have happened under religion's watch? Of course they have! Religion has a much longer and larger tradition than secularism. Had secularism the lengthy history of religion, might it have produced as many wars, as well? Harris is completely blind to this huge logical gaff.  <br /> <br />The second quip is that Harris derides 'moderate religions' - those that are not violent, are tolerant with regard to ecumenism, and are quite 'modern.' While I agree (paragraph 2) that this has more to do with secularilty than religion, there is little denying that these religionists - ASA FACT - are not violent. Harris's response: \\"They should be, if only they read their holy book. I have passages to prove it.\\" (Never mind the fact that, for instance, mainline protestants ARE NOT biblical textualists). Harris is creating a \\"damned if they do and if they don't\\" scenario. If a religion is violent, he criticizes it as an example of religion's irrationality. If there is a sect that is not, he suggests that it would be if they took their book literally, and then chastizes them as ignorant. So if it were pointed out to Harris that most western religionists are not - as a fact - violent, he might simply say: \\"They would be if they took religion seriously.\\" Not very convincing.  <br /> <br />Third, Harris quite often refers to our current situation as a war between Islam and the West. He suggests that Islamic fundamentalism will only become deadlier by martialing new technologies, and that the only way we may be able to stop it is to engage in a full-on assault on it. While this may be true (I don't rule it out) it seems dangerously close to the \\"us vs. the irredeemable them\\" that Harris chastises about most religious wars. Is he simply replacing zealotry with zealotry (disguised as a reasoned secularism)? <br /> <br />All in all though, this book is an iconoclastic and engaging read. Whether you agree with it or not (I agree with about 50% of it) it will certainly make you think - in ways that the PC police don't necessarily appreciate!
B000089RVX|1.0|That people actually think this tripe is 'goth' music is the reason why I go by 'deathrocker' these days. If you want some actual goth music, try Sex Gang Children, the Virgin Prunes, or Southern Death Cult. But if you like such as whiny teen-angst Hot Topic garbage, this will be right up your alley.  <br /> <br />The name of this alley is 'Baggy-panted Simpleton Teenager Alley', and it is no place for a sensible person to spend their time.
B00005JL0U|5.0|How can they make every other DVD into a movie but not Moonwalker. Micheal himself is a pimp why not pimp his movies. Do yall not know that VHS got played out with the slap bracelets and leather pants. Come on now lets not get old school so quick.
B00005JNBQ|5.0|This is the greatest movie of all time, the acting, the plot, the characters, everything about this is genius, and for the reviewer who stated Pedro only smiled once is wrong, he smiled 4 or 5 times. Peace out, Kip rules, he is the best character ever created, Awesome!
0451204530|3.0|Follet knows his history, which always makes reading his stuff both fun and educational. In this story we're taken back to the McCarthy era and dropped in the world of communist spies and the race to control space. It opens with our hero Luke waking up in a train station bathroom with his memory wiped. He must discover who he is and why he has amnesia. Plot twists ensue. Regrettably, the story is fairly easy to decipher from page one.  But thankfully the characters are pretty interesting, even if they are over the top sometimes.  AS always, his women are very strong independant characters, which is something I find refreshing. Follet's writing is usually a bit better than than this, and he seems more comfortable when he  is in his WWII mode. (Actually, some of the story flashes back to WWII). That this occurs during the 50's may have been one reason the environments and action seem dull.  I read this in a couple of days, breaking for work and what not, but I could easily have finished it  in a weekend, and I'm a slow reader. The only thing that really bothered me was that it took place over two days. Seemed kind of implausible to me.  But it was a fun read overall.
B0001L3LUE|5.0|At 85, Robert McNamara has a lot to tell.  He served three years in the U.S. army during World War II, seven years as U.S. Secretary of Defense (invited by Kennedy), thirteen years as President of the World Bank, and briefly as President of Ford Motor.  Basically, this man has been through a lot and it is incredible that he is willing and able to discuss openly what happened back then.  Some label him as an \\"arrogant dictator\\" that cares more about facts and figures than human life.  Others praise him as the man whose leadership allowed the United States to stand tall through difficult times.  Either way, his life had a tremendous impact on the security and welfare of the world.   <br />     The film presents \\"11 lessons\\" to learn from McNamara's life.  These are no ordinary lessons though; they are of utmost importance.  This is because these lessons were derived from \\"war mistakes.\\"  For example, the bombing of a city could actually be considered a mistake.   These lessons have to be taken seriously as a matter of life and death.  McNamara stresses that \\"errors of judgment\\" in the past were acceptable in the amount of 3 or 4 mistakes, but with the advent of nuclear weapons there can be NO mistakes.  This is because entire nations are now at risk of annihilation.  McNamara is speaking from his heart when he says we have to \\"try to learn\\" these lessons and pass them on to future generations. <br />     The U.S. government \\"looked down the gun barrel into nuclear war.\\"  \\"Ninety million Americans targeted by Cuban warheads.\\"  \\"It was luck that prevented nuclear war.\\"  And best of all, \\"that danger still exists today.\\"  This is pretty serious stuff coming from former Secretary of Defense.  I was captivated at how McNamara's tone of voice is still optimistic about life, after so many people being killed under his watch.  I was equally captivated at his ability to find positive aspects of war.  It's all a little bit scary. <br />     This film is all about human mindsets.  Human mindset is what creates wars and is the only way to effectively stop war before total destruction ensues.  It is incredible to have the opportunity to explore McNamara's thinking so closely.  He was confronted with the core dilemma of war.  For example, if you spare 1,000 Japanese lives today, the result would be 10,000 American soldiers killed unnecessarily next month.  The reason for war is defense; kill or be killed.  Unfortunately, the reason is sometimes based on misguided assumption or lies such as the \\"attack on the USS Maddox.\\"  The decision making process between the United States President and other high ranking officials during times of war is often marked by stress.  The recorded conversation between LBJ and McNamara is incredibly scary.  Simply put, LBJ, the President of the United States, has no deep respect for life and speaks with shocking arrogance. Throughout McNamara's career, he forced himself to answer many difficult humanitarian questions with \\"yes.\\"  His mindset was often:  the strategic answer is \\"yes\\", the internal judgment is \\"no\\", therefore the final answer is \\"yes.\\"  This is unfortunate... <br />     During this film, I could not help but question McNamara's inner motivation.  It really pulled at my emotions when McNamara described his grade school teacher.  He had a \\"superb\\" teacher who ordered the seats in rank according to grades.  Maybe this is where he first encountered the concept of ambition.  It almost brought tears to my eyes watching his facial expressions as he described how he competed against the other students.  Does he really take to heart Jefferson's words \\"that all men are created equal?\\"  McNamara mentions his annual salary at least two times and that his family benefited from his status.  Money is important, but I do not think it should have any motivating force when your career deals with the juggling of human lives.  McNamara depersonalized war decisions.  There is no way he could have carried out his duty otherwise.  McNamara became very emotional when describing the loss of a single American wingman after the bombing of an entire Japanese city!  He could hardly speak without bawling when describing Kennedy's assassination, but gracefully pulls out statistics like 100,000 Japanese (many civilian) die in the fire bombing of Tokyo.  If the fire bombing was more than a mere mental concept, or if his own brother was one of those Japanese citizens, he would have broken down emotionally when telling about them.  His personal reality is real, war is just a bunch of concepts that won't go away.   <br />     Towards the end of the film, it is obvious that McNamara is still haunted by unspoken grievances (personal and political).  I can see some recognition of his own regret and I cannot help but feel sorry for all he has been through.  He acted in the best of his knowledge and ability, but I think he still feels that was not enough.  All he can do now is accept it because it could not be otherwise, move on to greater things, and \\"try to learn.\\"   <br />
B0002XDODU|4.0|Well i just bought the album yesterday, and was listening to it throughout the day today. It is a good mix of classic Rammstein as well as a few new musical elements. There is no topping Rammstein's old stuff, i will always love it. However this new stuff is quite good...a good change. I  have a friend who is a big classic rock fan, and never liked Rammstein...he was pleased to hear the higher level of talent in this new album, when i made him lisetn to it. Definetly worth buying...Go Rammstein!
B00012QM8G|5.0|A facinating tale that makes you almost cry. I am definatly not the type of person who gets teary-eyed over dumb movies. This is a haunting tale that brings out the horrible truth of the Holocaust. And the part that really strikes you when the credits start playing is that this is all 100% real. <br /> <br />People de-humanized simply because they were born Jewish, who are stripped of their reasons to live. But even greater then that it shows the strength of the human spirit when one truley has the will to live. And the strength of one man, Oskar Schindler, a sinner destined for hell, who steps up and puts his life on the line to help innocent men and woman who face almost certain death. <br /> <br />In the end, when Schindler obtains the gold ring, in Hebrew is inscribed a proverb that should never be forgotten.
B00006879E|5.0|Love this CD.  All the songs are great but my favorites are \\"She Will Be Loved\\" \\"Shiver\\" and \\"Sunday Morning.\\"  Definitely a must buy.
B00005JMAH|4.0|The DVD has a much better picture quality than the theaters did.  With the whole movie being dark and a large portion of it cast in little light it was hard to really see things like you can when watching it on the DVD in your own home.  The extras that are on the second disk are rather disappointing to say the least, I had expected much better.  There are better games and interaction on their official website than on the 'extra' DVD.  If you love Harry Potter you have to get it, even if you saw it in theaters... <br /> <br />As for the movie it's self I was disappointed.  There are many important plot points that were changed or totally left out of the movie.  I understand you have to cut here and there, but truth be known they could have cut some of the scenery shots a bit and added a little more fact to the story.  They wasted a good 20 minutes throughout the movie with things that were either not even in the book, or with over-doing certain ideas.  The night bus experience was excessive, the only quidditch match that they saw fit to put into the movie was drawn out for 'effect' I assume and really did not need to be as long.  Seconds could have been shed in so many areas that would have made more than enough time for a few important plot points to be left in.  Then during the directors changes he made many errors regarding the Harry Potter world in general.  The movie starts off with Harry using magic at home under the covers with his wand, then they are going to say after he blows up his aunt out of anger that he is scared because he was using magic outside of school???  Then they changed the fact that Harry got his Firebolt during the school year and make it to were he gets it at the very end, not a major problem with that really, it is just that in the time they used to show it at the end they could have put it in the right place and added to the danger of Sirius Black entering the castle.  But I guess since they left out Christmas all together that they feltit was better to do it this way.  In fact they left out a lot of the 'good' moments.  They left out Harry's Birthday were he finally gets wonderful presents from his friends (including the sneek-o-scope) they left out Christmas where again he feels loved and receives the Firebolt (but at least they added that to the end so he could have it for next year I guess) they left out the good feelings he had during his time at the Leaky Cauldron, which instead they made him arrive there the day before school starts which isn't even practical to begin with since he still had to get his books.  Of course they covered that by having the minister of magic provide him with books.  Then they had Lupin use 'immobulus'to freeze the whomping willow when you know from the books that it will not work you have to touch the nott at the base of the tree.  Lupin could have used a stick to touch the knot just like he did in the book and it would not have taken any more time then they already used, also as Harry and Hermione tried to get into the hole at the bottom of the whomping willow crookshanks hit the knott for them where in the movie it showed them being swung in the air and then finally falling into the hole. Again a spot of wasted time that did not follow the book.  Probably worst of all they left out the details of the marauders map.  Seriously it would have only taken a minute or two, to have that conversation with Lupin. <br /> <br />All in all the movie on it's own was a great movie.  Perhaps too dark and too realistic for children under 10 years old or so.  I do hope the director from the first two movies comes back because he made it more child like and more magical.  It isn't suppose to be real and the director did such a great job making this film 'real' that it barely was able to stay at a PG rating.  In some countries they had to fight over the rating because it wasn't deemed suitable for children.  Considering each book gets darker and darker they will have to 'tone-down' the authenticity a bit if they still want it to be considered a family movie or a children's movie.  They pushed the envelope in this area during this film, and it was brilliant, however it will not work in the future films if they wish to keep a PG rating and not alienate half their audience. <br /> <br />All in all this IS a WONDERFUL movie, just disappointing and did not flow well at all.  If you had not read the book there is a very good chance you would be at a loss, but then again maybe if I had not read the book I would not have been disappointed...
0151008787|5.0|This is one of the best modern works, that I have picked up in a while. Well written (Oz writes with his soul), a true tale of love, growing up & developing. Oz is a real master. Do not hesitate, pick this one up and enjoy. This book flows like water, it is a great story told by a great man!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Gene Roddenberry originally pitched Star Trek to the networks as \\"'Wagon Train' to the stars\\" and \\"'Gunsmoke' in space\\".  I love Trek, but the show always seemed more like a commentary on society.  It used aspects of science fiction as an allegory to address difficult issues of what was going on in the world in the late 60's.    Now, with Firefly, it seems like Joss Whedon has finally realized Roddenberry's original dream.  This is a really fun show.  It is a science fictions show with cattle rustling, gun fights, whore houses, train robberies, bounty hunters, and so on.  Basically, all the essential elements to a great Western.  Admittedly, the show starts out a little dry.  It's my feeling that most shows start out that way, though, because you have to wade through all the introductions to characters, settings, and such.  That being said, by the time I was done with the first disc in the set, I was hooked.  To set the basic story, it takes place in the future where the only two surviving super powers are the United States and China.  This series takes place several years after a war, where a crew of misfits (the best kind of crews!) aboard a smuggling ship are trying to stay independent, and keep out of reach of an increasingly oppressive government.    Firefly is something completely different than anything Whedon did in his Buffy shows.  The most noticeable difference is that Joss and crew are writing for adult characters, instead of characters in their late teens.  There is not the witty back and forth banter that was so characteristic of the Buffy shows.  The characters in this show are a little darker, but less brooding.  They are all conflicted, and they all have secrets to hide.  Sometimes the characters are almost more interesting for what they don't say.  There is a lot of mystery, and a lot of questions in this show.    Unfortunately, this series is barely able to touch upon that.  It was canceled by Fox way too soon.  Too bad, because I think a second and third season could have been explosive.  Hopefully after the \\"Serenity\\" movie comes out (the new Firefly movie Joss is currently working on as I write this review), a new station will pick up the show and let him finish the story.  (I could be wrong, but I believe something similar happened to Babylon 5.)  Anyway, fans of action based science fiction who have been itching for something new should definitely pick up Firefly.  I think people who liked Joss Whedon's work on Buffy/Angel know what kind of stories he likes to weave; and if you enjoy that kind of depth and complexity, you really should check out this show.
B000002H5I|5.0|It is hard to find music, lyrics and emotion blend into an unbelievable work of art. Really makes us wonder about what we call music these days. Think about it... every song has a message, conviction, rhythm and an exceptional beauty to it.  <br />The unusal thing about this album is that each and every song is lovely... Not just a song or two. Simply a superb collection of songs. <br /> <br /> <br /> Just mesmerizing.
B00029LNHS|5.0|Funkier and greater than all Funk/R&B on the market, I must say it resembles Arrested Development. Girl's voice is unbelievable and hopefully not too helped by synthesizers. Once in a while a group make a hit like \\"Where is the Love\\" and two questions arise to my head: Is it a teen band?; Is it a good band that is randomly selected for a catchy song?. I must say the second option fits my ear. It is a great CD to listen from top to bottom. I could hardly hear 2 or 3 songs from 50 Cents, Usher, Dre or anybody  from the corner (OK, Eminem IS very good). This a varied, experimental fusion that really makes funk worth hearing out of a Disco, Night Club or whatever it is called  near your place. For funk-lovers I would recommend, for music lovers I would absolutely recommend this album.
0446677450|4.0|I read this a few years ago because someone I was visiting had it in their apartment.  At one point Kiyosaki says that rich buy assets and the poor buy liabilites.  Basically an asset pays you without you doing anything - for example interest from the bank.  Likewise a liability takes money without you doing anything.  (Although he does point out that in the case of a house and a car both require continuous money for up keep but may be needed for other reasons.)  For me assessing whether I was aquiring assets or liabilities was a breakthrough in how to look at things.  I'm not rich and unlikely to be so (which I'll get to next paragraph), but it has very much helped me to clarify how I think about spending. <br /> <br />Kiyosaki also gives advice about specific types of investment strategies.  Many of them take more daring than I have (and that's why I will never be rich although with longer term planning I will likely do OK).  However all are based on the same strategy of aquireing assets.  Which goes into why reading the book might be good even though I just gave the big secret away.  For example in speculating in real estate Kiyosaki is especially clear on an asset being something that you don't have to continually manage.  In this case have someone else who is unclogging toilets for your tenants.  Treat this employee well and tip your broker and generally pay attention to and be generous with people who are part of your assets. <br /> <br />Basically this is a good book to clarify your strategies involving money.  Even if you are cautious like me it is helpful in terms of helping you clarify how you think about money.  I don't think it can make you \\"get rich quick\\" but it is still very good to have read it.  (4 stars not 5 because the specific investment strategies aren't for my personality)
B00007H1Y2|4.0|The big '59 Cadillac tailfin on the cover of MAMBO SINUENDO should have been a hint: though mostly recorded in Havana Cuba, this is not another Buena Vista Social Club-type recording, though a few tunes hint at that. <br />What MAMBO SINUENDO is, actually, is something of  a throwback to the 'exotica' records of the 1950s and 60s. <br />Some Latin percussion and rhythms are coupled to Hawaiian sounds: throw in surf guitar and you have a great 'lounge' recording to contribute to the mood. <br />

0670033693|5.0|I was fortunate enough to read this gem, of a book, and found it to be very difficult to put down (ask my kids!).  The visual imagery in it paints the Wyoming town and landscape as only a great story teller can capture.  Although, it is a mystery and a 'who done it' to the end, the characters will make you laugh out loud. Craig has truly captured the art of story-telling in this book, and I look forward to more books to follow
0385513755|4.0|I read The Da Vinci Code and disliked it for several reasons.  A major one was the lack of illustrations.  The plot deals with an art historian and a cryptographer trying to discover a mystery hidden by a dying museum curator.  The curator was shot in the Louvre and while bleeding to death left clues which tie in with math and art.  So art is central to the plot.  Illustrations add so much.<br /><br />So including illustrations really helps move things along.  The other flaws still remain, the main one being that the book is poorly written (although the art and math stuff is mostly accurate).  But adding pictures accentuates the positive while eliminating a big negative.<br /><br />My advice is if you are purchasing The Da Vinci Code to spend the extra on the illustrated version, especially if you aren't \\"into\\" art.  The extra five dollars will more than double the value of the reading experience.

B00005ASHM|5.0|This album by the Beach Boys is one of the greats. Each song makes its own musical and lyrical point and the vocal performace by the group, and Brian Wilson in particular, are nothing short of awe-inspiring. This is one of the first albums to really push the envelope as to what pop music could be. \\"God Only Knows\\", \\"Don't Talk (Put YOur Head on My Shoulder)\\", \\"Wouldn't It Be Nice\\" and \\"Caroline No\\" are the best tracks.  <br />   A lot of people mention Sgt. Pepper in their review of this album. Sgt. Pepper, along with Revolver, Abbey Road, and the \\"White\\" album, is better than this album. Proof of this is that there seems to be an insecurity among Beach Boys fans that they always have to mention Sgt Pepper while discussing Pet Sounds. The Beatles are the better band. Period. That is why they top every hundred greatest artists of rock list and the Beach Boys don't even make the top ten.  <br />    Despite all of this, this is an excellent effort by the Beach Boys and the album that makes the Beach Boys worth their place in rock and roll history.
B0001CCXZW|5.0|This, 6 disc dvd set, is absolutely a must see...again! If you love the show Gilmore Girls, you will love watching season One all over again. On disc six it comes with great extras! Deleted Scenes, and interviews with the cast! Even if you are a late comer to the show, you will enjoy starting to watch this award winning show!
B00005JNJT|5.0|I did not know they were making another Batman movie. I think its cool. I love Batman. I own all 4 batman movies on VHS and I own games also. It looked pretty cool but I will have to wait and see if it is really good.  Some people did not like the last 2 movies in the series but I have enjoyed them all myself. I will be 24 when the new batman movie comes out in 2005 because my brithday is April 1st and I was only 8 when the first movie came out. So you can see batman has been around for awhile even before the first movie and how Batman has come along way. When I have seen the movie I will give it whatever rating in my opiion it deserves. But for Now the 5 stars are for the first 4 movies. The TV show and the games. can't wait. Thanks
0553269631|5.0|Simply a beautiful book which focusses on 4 main characters and how they lack the ability to share their life and desires with others.    This is alleviated by the most unlikely character, whom the others are finally able to relate to.  Set in the depression era south, a few of these characters have some radical political beliefs, but I think that is understandable given their economic situation.  I listened to the unabridged audio version and it was extremely well done.
B00028HBKC|1.0|I am not a Christian but acknowledge that Jesus Christ and his followers have had and continue to have a profound influence on my life, in fact on all our lives. I was therefore really keen to watch this film that dealt with one of the most central acts of this often told life -  the actual moments of our redemption. I have never understood what this \\"redemption\\" business is about - what it is from or what it leads to, and I have always failed to see any logic at all in the view that someone's suffering and death could in some bizarre way be the trigger required to achieve it.<br /><br />So my interest was piqued by what this film might offer and by some one the more enthusiastic reviews I had read and heard about it.<br /><br />Well, I have seen a lot of pain and suffering in my time - as have we all if our eyes are open to it - and this was something else entirely. This was fantasy terror, sadomasochism with Hollywood lighting, the inflicting of horrific injuries that would close down or paralyze any human nervous system. One of the points of the Jesus Christ story is that he is supposed to have been a man - a real mortal flesh and blood, thinking, feeling man. Well the stoic masochist in this film was no mortal man. With injuries that would have felled a shrieking elephant, injuries that would have caused everything from hemorrhage to brain damage, he quietly and thoughtfully staggers on his holy way even offering the occasional smart remark to bystanders.<br /><br />This film was just another spectacular portrayal of one of history's most lucrative brands. I realized when it had finished that I had wanted to feel something genuine and authentic, to have some glimmer of understanding about this whole business of suffering as a ticket to good things in the next life. Instead I was almost numbed by its portrayal - if not downright betrayal - of a life well lived, a life that challenged pomposity, a life that offered solace to the poor, kindness and acceptance to so many people who were considered unworthy by those who held religious power, and a life that was finally squashed and scourged and murdered by the religious power brokers of his day<br /><br />If Christ's passion was as full on as the scriptures tell us then Mel Gibson's understanding of passion [as suffering] is less than ordinary. It is truly one dimensional, myopic and what you would expect from someone who is so certain and self-satisfied about their world view, that they cannot see the reality and the suffering and the prejudice and the hatred and the bitterness and the cruelty that Jesus Christ, I sometimes think, understood and indeed experienced.<br /><br />Physical suffering is graphic no doubt but it also provokes real responses like fear and cries of anguish. Surely there was far more to the passion of Jesus Christ - a passion that captured the suffering of the entire world - and the Gibson film connected with none of it. Humiliation and ostracism, being the outcast or the sinner, the epileptic or the leper, the shunned man or the shamed woman, or even the gay man or the incarcerated black American in today's terms, are clearly things that Jesus understood and about which Mel Gibson has absolutely no idea. The passion of Jesus Christ was as much the pain of his rejection by his own, the shame and fear and helplessness he brought to his own mother and those he loved and cared about - to the point that they were not even prepared to be associated with him. Gibson portrays this denial of connection as some kind of fear of physical harm. The fact that it takes courage to stand up and stand out, to be associated with those upon whom the crowd has turned, was as much a part of Peter's fear filled denial of Christ as any fear of being physically harmed.<br /><br />The film just doesn't get it at even the most basic level. Christ was humiliated. He was outcast. He was betrayed by people he would apparently do anything for. His clothes were stripped from him and he was mocked cruelly - the crown of thorns, the sign above him on the cross - all of it as much about mockery and ridicule as it was about the excruciating physical pain he had to endure like a cur in front of - and if we are to believe him, at the hands of - those he actually loved.<br /><br />Has Gibson any understanding of what it might be like to be beaten and broken by those you love - really, honestly love. I suspect that Gibson probably sees nudity as a sexual thing - which of course it often is - and viewers have had the Gibson anatomy pretty much in our faces over the years - but he is seemingly too squeamish to let us see Christ stripped bare, degraded, mocked and totally humiliated. We are also spared the kind of choking tears and heart-rending sense of hopelessness that racked the very being of Christ as he - he who ostensibly would have known so much - begged his so called father to be spared, a father who could not be convinced to let this particular chalice pass. This is the passion of abandonment.<br /><br />The power of a real man reduced to the basest suffering, reduced to the sum of all our suffering, is not to be found in this mawkish film. This is a film for those who like their Christianity white, piously respectable and physical. The fact that so many desperate people have lauded this film, watched and re-watched it, speaks volumes of the intellectual poverty and deep-felt craving which exist among so many modern Christians - their need to have something to pin their increasingly strident and intolerant beliefs upon. You just have to ask \\"What is the agenda for this film? What on earth is Gibson's brutal physical reductionism leading to?\\"<br /><br />The world is increasingly dominated by the new evangelical Christians, and the old traditional fundamentalists, with their noses found deeply in the trough of the world's \\"abundance\\", insensitive to the costs paid by suffering people everywhere for the greed and bigotry of essentially industrialized Christian nations.  Christ is often portrayed in the world's media and many of its televised churches, as if he were some kind of cheerleader for the American military-industrial complex as it crusades to crush all serious opposition once and for all. This film will suit that American mood - or that foul part of it that likes its Christianity muscular. It is as warlike and violent and macho and unthinking as any film you will see. And it has almost become unpatriotic to give it a thumbs down. If you are looking for the man who loved and saved the world you will not find him here. Perhaps no film could ever fully tell the story of Christ. This one doesn't even manage to retell one of the most central parts of it.from him and he was mocked cruelly - the crown of thorns, the sign above him on the cross - all of it as much about mockery and ridicule as it was about the excruciating physical pain he had to endure like a cur in front of - and if we are to believe him, at the hands of - those he actually loved. <br />  <br />Has Gibson any understanding of what it might be like to be beaten and broken by those you love - really, honestly love.

B00005JNEI|1.0|There is a simple test to determine whether someone is to be taken seriously regarding this film.  If they call it a \\"great film\\" or an \\"intriguing documentary,\\" then they are clearly incapable of distinguishing between fantasy and reality.      This is a political attack.  The truth, through an endless series of out-of-context shots and deceitful editing, is brushed aside for the most part.  What this film is not, most definitely, is a documentary.  Of course within the propaganda are \\"real\\" video clips, but without context they mean very little.  It is, however, a megaphonic display of first amendment rights.  God bless America - where else can you defame the President so overtly and be completely protected doing so.
B000669GAI|5.0|One of the best CD's I have ever bought! A must have for any Pearl Jam fan or rock fan for that matter. A classic album by one of the greatest rock bands of all time.
B000002TQV|5.0|I think it says this will be review #422, but I have to add my praise to this mountain of love.   <br /> <br />People always write about this album as the turning point where you can see that Radiohead is about to get good, as though their catalog really starts with OK Computer.  To me, this is the best album Radiohead has put out.   <br />  <br />Kid A/HTTT Radiohead is great, but I think there are millions of us silent, hidden, Radiohead fans who would prefer a great rock song like \\"High and Dry\\" to a brilliant electronica experiment with a cat meowing intermitently.  <br /> <br />I know that they returned to some guitars in their last album, and I'm not knocking the newer stuff, but really, this album-to me and the average smart music listener-is the top of Radiohead's great heap.
B000002UZ4|5.0|Very few could rake as many hits for a short period of time. Pet Shop Boys' stunning coup of hits from 1985 to 1991 are all reflected in Discography - arranged chronologically just like that of the Queen of Pop Madonna.<br /><br />All tracks are great, even those that were not yet released that time. I only wished that they have remastered the tracks during that time.  While the cd does not sound bad, it could have sounded better with a little remastering.  This would give its a more edgy and sharper sonic sound!<br /><br />Nevertheless, Discography is the encapsulation of one of the best groups of the 80's.<br /><br />Walk down memory lane.
B0000AQS6R|1.0|Chevy Chase must've been EXTREMELY A desperate for money if he stooped this low to make a piece of unfunny trash like this.Watch as Chevy throws away his wonderful acting talent in this holiday turkey.Groan in agony as the unfunny relative makes that sick joke about the family cat being fried-a joke that's so sick that it would even make a cat-hater shake with pure anger. Avoid this trashy movie,and if you were unfortunate to have this movie,then burn it.If you want a funny movie,go with \\"Liar,Liar\\" or Jeff Foxworthy videos instead.
B00007E8V4|5.0|If you like System of a Down and are familiar with their other music, this is for you. If you like nu-metal, and are interested in System of a Down, this is for you. If you, like me, have a little brother who heard  <br />I-E-A-I-A-I-O on the radio and then impulsively bought the cd, this is for you. I have the two other S.O.A.D. cds, and I can say, without doubt, that this is the best one. The songs on here are awesome, ranging all the different styles of their other cds. Roulette and Streamline sound modeled after the band's first cd, while Chic 'N' Stu and F*** The System sound like they were taken out of Toxicity. Some of the songs, however, like NuGuns, I-E-A-I-A-I-O, and Highway Song have a style all their own, and I must say, if this is the style S.O.A.D. is sticking with, I'm giddy with anticipation for their next album. For those of you who think compilations can be quite sloppy due to varied styles, ditch that thought. This cd does not even feel like a compilation. In fact, I didn't even know it was until I read a review for it on AOL a couple days ago. All the songs on here have their own style, yes, but they all seem to fit together on this cd. If you're interested in S.O.A.D., this is where to start. If you want some kick@$$ nu-metal, this is where to look. If you're looking for something that'll piss your parents off but make you happy, this is what to listen to. Go pick this up if you meet these criteria, or Mr. Jack will come and get you.
0930289234|1.0|Moore's original burst of inspiration was to take a form of children's literature - the super-hero comic book - and fuse it with the Hemingway-derived melodrama of the hard-boiled school of crime and detective fiction.  Teenagers, poorly-read and possessing malnourished tastes in prose, were predictably awestruck by the results.  They thought it was 'realistic';  they thought this was 'great literature'.
B00030590I|3.0|Basic plotline: The tyrannical emperor of China is on the verge of making China one unified country under his control. However, three powerful assassins have vowed to kill the Emperor for his war crimes. In retlaiation the Emperor has placed the most lavish bounty in history to the man that brings him proof of these asssassins' deaths. Enter Jet Li. He brings the Emperor proof that he's defeted these 3 deadly assassins, but as the Emperor questions Jet Li's story it begins to form holes and only at the film's end is the truth revealed. <br /> <br />Some people may be wondering why \\"Quentin Tarantino Presents\\" is above Jet Li's name on the DVD. Well, truth be told Tarantino had zero to do with the making of this film (so don't expect KILL BILL type action). However, the company (Miramax) that bought the U.S. distribution rights to HERO has a bad history of mangling nearly every Asian film they release in the US, so Tarantino and the company came to an agreement that if Tarantino let's them slap his name above the title of the film then they'll leave the mangling of HERO to a minimum. So U.S. cinema fans owe Tarantino that much, but otherwise his name has no business being associated with this film. <br /> <br />One name that everyone should associate with the film HERO, but few Americans know, is Yimou Zhang. Who? He's the director. Ultimately, direction is what saves this film and it's flimsy plotline and hollow characters from becoming just another low-grade kung-fu B-flick. Nothing wrong with chop-socky B-flicks. I love those, too. But Yimou Zhang elevates the material and makes it cinematic. The fights aren't just cool--they're beautiful. Some may call them too \\"artsy,\\" and it's true the film's use of color to denote perspective can feel a bit heavy handed at times, but never to the point of going overboard. <br /> <br />It seems a lot of reviews are comparing HERO to Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and many ways you can feel HERO trying to be CT,HD. It's true that both films have exceptional cinematography and excellent fight choreography, but there is sadly where the comparisons end. On the down side, HERO lacks the wonderful story and griping characters of CT,HD. HERO has a one-note love story between two assasins thrown into the film just to move the story along. Also HERO is basically one story about two battles told from three different perspectives: Jet Li's Character's, the Emporer's, and then the truth. On the upside, it has a great gimick of showing audiences the same fights but form different perspectives. And the ending wasn't exactly what I expected; it somehow left me feeling both satisfied and a little cheated. <br /> <br />Bottomline: HERO is a kung-fu flick dressed up real nice and elevated by the director cinematically, but without any charcaters of real depth or a strong plot it doesn't live up to its full potential.
B00005JMUL|5.0|I've just returned from chaperoning a large group of 1st, 2nd & 3rd grade students on a field trip to see The Polar Express.  I am amazed at the negative reviews I've seen here.  The movie is absolutely incredible including all the special effects and the animation.  As for the children, they were spellbound.  At points, you could have heard a pin drop, they were so involved with the movie.  They loved the \\"rollercoaster effect\\" and the adventure scenes on the train, some gasping out loud during the action.  <br /> <br />The special animation of the film just adds to the magical dream-like since of disbelief (or belief!).  As the story is a children's classic, it is as if the book has come to life and thrust you into the story. As an adult, I was continuously  blown away with the detail of the artwork and little subtle nuances throughtout the film.   <br /> <br />I believe this film is destined to become a beautiful Christmas classic.  It's the kind of film both an adult and a child can equally enjoy.  I envision yearly Christmas screenings of The Polar Express at IMAX theaters with families returning year after year for a family treat. <br /> <br />(By the way, our group saw the film in a regular movie theater near our school, not an IMAX, but the effect was still tremendous. For full effect, I do recommend seeing it in a movie theater-don't wait until the video comes out!) <br />
0767817664|5.0|Chris Sarandon is gorgeous in this movie. Roddy Mcdowell is great and Amanda Beardsly (name) is very cute. It is very scary also sweet and has some real comic moments. I've seen it many times and love it.
B00012BD0S|2.0|I have to admit that Symphony X's neoclassical fantasy metal style has sort of grown off me these days.  While they are undeniably great for this style of music (which I normally despise), it is a style that can get kind of old.  However, I still think some of their material (namely \\"The Odyssey\\", and to a slightly lesser extent, \\"V\\") is really good, but this album never really did it for me much.<br /><br />First of all, the solos on this album get really boring.  Romeo and Pinella pretty much recycle the same shredding licks over and over, and that really gets old.  At least on \\"The Odyssey\\", they throw in some slower, more melodic stuff to counter-balance things a bit, here it's nothing but shred shred shred.  And besides that, most of the songs here are pretty forgettable.  \\"Sea of Lies\\", \\"Pharaoh\\", and \\"The Witching Hour\\" are just plain annoying (and \\"Twas seven score and sixteen more\\" is one of the most embarrassing lyrics they've ever written).  The title track has a really cool intro, and an awesome outro, but the middle part just bores me to death (and a boring 20+ minute song is never a good thing).  The only song I really enjoy from this album is \\"The Accolade\\".  This was the first Symphony X song I heard, and is still one of my favorites of theirs.  Ok, so the lyrics are goofy, but the song is just great, and Russell Allen really shines on this one.  This song is my only reason for holding onto this album.<br /><br />So yeah, I don't really listen to this band that much anymore, but if I do, it's \\"V\\" or \\"The Odyssey\\" over this one without a doubt.  I'm still interested in hearing Russell Allen's solo album, though, as his tremendous vocals are by far my favorite thing about Symphony X, and it should be cool to hear his voice applied to a different musical style.<br /><br />Oh, and to settle the age-old dispute: I'm not really as big into Dream Theater as I used to be either, but they are INFINITELY better than Symphony X.  Of that, there can be no question.o question.
B0002XH9Z4|3.0|Since I am fully aware of the fanaticism and devotion of Jackson fans, let me first state that I was at one point most likely one of the most devoted of all Jackson fans... my admiration of Jackson began with the release of Bad- the last of his great albums (and in my opinion, the best). Yes, I had Off the Wall and, of course, Thriller... however, Bad was masterfully produced, written, performed, and marketed. In my opinion, it is the true gem of his catalog. Coincidentally, it is also the album that Jackson hoped to sell 100 million copies of (it would ultimately sell about 25 million, I believe).<br /><br />This new release is a compilation that should not have happened. The financial hell that Jackson now finds himself in is the sole reason for this release... normally not a consideration to critique an album, however, the haste at which this collection was produced results in a poorly thought-out product. There is no other rational explanation, otherwise, we would not have seen the release of a similar compilation last year (which may actually be better), \\"The One\\".<br /><br />Jackson's $350,000,000 debt to Bank of America as well as the slew of new business/financial lawsuits (not to mention the crimial suits) are what fueled this release... a well meaning, forsighted manager and advisor (or in Jackson's case, a brother, Randy) would not have allowed it.<br /><br />No one needs another copy of the songs already found in their MJ collection. Furthermore, no one needs a poor concert film of a European show from 1992 that aired originally on HBO (which I have had on tape since that time). The only \\"warranted\\" releases on this collection are those previously unreleased/rare songs... however, for MJ to have released a CD with only those recordings on it, the price would not have resulted in the financial returns that Jackson so deperately needs now. Unfortunately, this release will not have positive results either.<br /><br />I gave this collection three stars. Yes,Jackson is one of the best showmen of all time- that is undeniable. Yes, Jackson is very talented and can dance incredibly. Yes, Jackson has written some amazing songs. However, it is clearly evident that Jackson has lost his songwriting capabilities and marketing genius that he once so masterfully demonstrated. It is rather apparent that Quincy Jones, in particular, and other that Jackson used to surround himself with had major positive input for his creativity.<br /><br />Sadly, Jackson has become stale and robotic. Over the years, had he focused his attention on his \\"gifts\\" rather than his eccentric lifestyle (which has obviously caught up with him), perhaps Jackson could have become one of the greatest living entertainer legends of all time. To the contrary, he has (and apparently will continue to become) one of the saddest cases of celebrity and financial indulgence ever known.<br /><br />Final suggestion- buy Bad instead.
B00009V7T2|5.0|The Mars Volta is a new project from former members of At the Drive-in, that sees them going in a more progressive/jazzy direction.  Imagine a cross between Dream Theater and At the Drive-in, and you've sort of got the idea.<br /><br />But wait, you say!  That combination can't possibly work, can it?  Well, you are wrong, my friend.  Very wrong.  \\"Deloused in the Comatorium\\" is an absolutely fantastic album.  The band combines trippy technical jams with raw indie/punk inspired music, and the result is pretty impressive.  The musicianship is fantastic, and the songs are exciting and unpredictable.  I can't help but make the comparisons to Dream Theater, as many aspects of this album bring them to mind.  Omar's vocals even remind me a bit of James Labrie, only less polished and operatic.  Jon Theodore is a drummer somewhat similar to Mike Portnoy, but he is much more diverse.  Portnoy tends to do a lot of the same things over and over, but Theodore's drumming is skillful, inventive, and always compelling.  But enough with the DT comparisons.  The Mars Volta are a much different band.  In fact, they're sort of what progmetal should be, without the cheesy clich&eacute;s that often befall the genre.  Oh, and it's also worth noting that Flea from the Red Hot Chili Peppers plays bass on this album.  Here, he's showing a less groovy and more technical side, and he still sounds great.  John Frusciante also guest-starts on one song (\\"Cicatriz ESP, I think).<br /><br />The album begins with the short intro \\"Son Et Lumiere\\", which segues into the intense opener \\"Intertiatic ESP\\".  \\"Drunkship of Lanterns\\" and \\"Eriatarka\\" are progressive metal done right, with insane musicianship and wild, unpredictable song structures.  They'll go from complex jazzy/proggy breakdowns to gentle, singable melodies in the blink of an eye.  \\"Cicatriz ESP\\" is the longest song, clocking in at over 12 minutes, which features some bizarre, ambient passages.  This song is sort of like post rock meets early Crimson.  \\"This Apparatus Must Be Unearthed\\" is a somewhat shorter song that is equally catchy and complex (wicked outro as well).  \\"Televators\\" is a break from the insanity, and is soft and atmospheric throughout.  The album closes with \\"Take the Veil Cerpin Taxt\\".  This is probably the closest thing to At the Drive-in you'll hear here.  It's a very manic, punk-like track, but more epic.  This song ends rather abruptly, which is a cool way to end the album, as it sort of leaves you wanting more (even if the album is over an hour in length).<br /><br />Yep, this is really cool stuff.  If you want progressive metal without the cheese, and with a bit more eccentricity, then the Mars Volta is the band for you.  Might be a bit too freaky for some, but if you're into that sort of thing, you'll love this a lot.y Crimson.  \\"This Apparatus Must Be Unearthed\\" is a somewhat shorter song that is equally catchy and complex (wicked outro as well).  \\"Televators\\" is a break from the insanity, and is soft and atmospheric throughout.

B000002GDJ|4.0|Another strong album by the Police, which includes the masterpieces, 'Message In a Bottle', 'Bring On The Night' and 'Walking on the Moon'. The rest of the album rocks, although there are a couple of filler tracks 'Contact' and 'Does Everyone Stare'. Still my favourite Police album.
B000002J0B|3.0|If I could give this a 5/8, then I would.  This would be a better album if they kept \\"Over the Hills and Far Away\\" and side two, but replaced the rest with some of the rejects that appeared on \\"Physical Grafitti\\".  I have complaints and praises for this album.  Lets start with the complaints.  To start, \\"The Song Remains the Same\\".  How could the formerly groovey record that? second complaint is \\"The Rain Song\\".  It's just boring.  Not to say that if a song isn't hard, it's boring, because there are lots of really good soft songs, but this is just bad for 7-minutes.  Then, there's \\"The Crunge\\".  I like that they're trying to be diverse, but trying funk just didn't work this time (But it did with \\"Trampled Under Foot\\")  Now, the good parts of this album include, first off \\"The Ocean\\" with a opening guitar more classic than \\"Back in Black\\".  The next is \\"No Quarter\\", a strong guitar and synthesizer with great vocals.  Then there's \\"Dancing Days\\", a take a chance and win song, along with \\"Over the Hills and Far Away\\" which I regard as one of Led Zeppelin's many classics.  All in all, get this album if your curious or convinced that Led Zeppelin can do no wrong.
6304698526|1.0|This is definately one of the most boring movies I have ever seen. I bought the title because of the ravings about the car chase and forced myself through the rest of the film. Since everyone else rated this movie so well, you might think I'm an idiot for my opinion. If you haven't seen the movie, give it a try and you decide. Oh, and Bullitt and his 68 Mustang are NOT CHASING A GTO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! IT'S A CHARGER!!!!!!!!!!! <br />Thank you very much for your time and consideration!
B00003CXCT|5.0|The original trilogy is classic, so get these DVD...and don't worry about the \\"changes\\".  They truly aren't that noticable - which was the point of the changes in the first place.  Lucas only changed a few things that you'll say, \\"Oh I see something new over there in the back of that big thing\\".  See?  No big deal...nothing seem to be cut out, so nothing is missing.  The overall visual experience is AMAZINGLY better...the quality of video is superb.  When the High Definition versions of these are out I'm first in line...again!  Do yourself a favor and get these DVD's if you have been wondering if you should...the bitching out there is a little rough on Lucas.  I bitched to about a year ago and then I read something somewhere online that said, \\"They are Lucas' babies and he can do whatever he wants...we are the audience and he is the artist.\\"  True.
B00068IOWM|5.0|Reviewer \\"chris the fish\\" is obviously a Nickelback fan. <br /> <br />I say this album is much needed because there are so many albums produced by \\"musicians\\" lately with 1 or 2 \\"hits\\" and the rest is filler. U2 sets the standard higher for pop/rock songwriters, musicians and listeners who love music and picking apart every layer of sound. <br /> <br />With HTDAAB, U2 has produced a fine album of eleven well-crafted songs. I'm not going to bore you with a long-winded review so let me just say if you are a true U2 fanatic like me, this album ranks up there with Joshua Tree and Achtung Baby. Four years of hard work in the studio have obviously paid off. Enjoy!
B00065JTBA|5.0|I love this record!  What a gift!  Thank you all who put this together!  Cannot decide which is my favourite!  All tracks are awesome, so sad they were cut out the original records!  <br /> <br />I always wanted to hear \\"Starting all over again\\", MY DREAM CAME TRUE! <br /> <br />I love \\"Taking it back\\", \\"Temptation\\", all of it!  THANK YOU!  For this real rear stuff!  Good stuff!

When a mathematician refers to \\"Ashley #128\\", the structure has been specified completely.<br /><br />This is history, practice, theory, and fun between the same covers. No working library can be without it.<br /><br />//wiredweird
B0002Z0EYK|4.0|All I have to say about this is penny-arcade.com's review of this movie was exactly right on.  How much cooler would this film have been if the Hulk and Legolas had taken out all those Trojan and Greek dudes?  A LOT COOLER!!!!! <br /> <br />Not that it wasn't fine as is, it was enjoyable, but the Hulk (Eric Bana) and Legolas (Orlando Bloom) fighting off all those dudes as brothers would have rocked!
B000002J1S|5.0|I first had this as an LP, actual a double LP in the 70's.  In LP form, you could read the story that Peter Gabriel has come up here about Rael and his amazing journey.  In this new CD format, your eyes strain to read this which is truly unfortunate.  I have turned many onto this concept album, the best but unfortunately, the last to feature Peter Gabriel as their vocalist.  The title track has received some FM airplay as well as \\"Carpet Crawlers\\" in the 70's.  Otherwise, an album and musical taste that dooes take a few listens to fully appreciate this as the masterpiece that it is.  On every repeat listen, you will hear something new that you swear wasn't there before.  I choose to play the discs back to back.  \\"In The Cage\\" still sounds amazing in 2004.  Album closer \\"It\\" is just fantastic as the album finale as it says tongue firmly in cheek, \\"It is only knock and know all, but I like it\\".  A lot of the earlier remasters from the band are now offered at $8 or less on Amazon, take a chance on \\"Wind & Wuthering\\" or \\"Trick of the Tail\\", both feature Phil Collins on lead vocals but this is before he discovered the solo spotlight and these were still \\"Band\\" records.  Start here though, you'll be glad you did.
B000089CJI|4.0|Postal Servie is a very talented band and I can't wait for more.  The one thing is that they don't have enough lyrics.  Their songs make you want to hear more.  By the time the song is over you want to hear what they think of next.   <br /> <br />Sleeping In is my favorite song.  It puts a new twist on the way you think about things.  The song isn't something you just listen to, you think.
B000669GAI|4.0|Let's hope so.  This is a very good collection of songs that - if there's any justice in the world - should serve as the band's epitaph.  Sure, it would've been nice to have \\"Crazy Mary\\" and maybe \\"Rockin' In The Free World\\" (the live version w/ Neil Young), but this set does a respectable job of covering most of the bases (hit singles, non-hit singles, fan favourites, etc.).  My OPINION is that Pearl Jam's most compelling work is behind them.  I haven't been truly moved by a PJ song since \\"Smile\\" from the \\"No Code\\" album and that was nearly ten years ago.  Good job, boys.  You can go now.
B000001ESJ|4.0|It's 1:00 am on some late-70's weekend, I'm 13 years old, Saturday Night Live has just ended, and it's time for Don Kirshner's Rock Concert (or Rawwk Kawwn-saht as he pronounced it.) I'm a real-life character out of the movie \\"Dazed and Confused\\" with musical tastes beginning and ending with Kiss.  My best bud Kevin and I stayed up to watch SNL 'cuz in those days you didn't dare show your face at school on Monday morning if you weren't up on all the \\"new\\" skits.<br /><br />Ol' Don introduces some Canadian band called \\"Rush.\\"  \\"Hey,\\" I think to myself, \\"I live 5 minutes from the Canadian border.  Maybe these guys are cool and when I get older I'll go see them.\\"<br /><br />Rush comes onstage and plays 3 songs from their new album, \\"A Farewell to Kings,\\" with the title track followed by \\"Closer to the Heart\\" and \\"Xanadu.\\"  And my little 13-year-old world changed forever.  It wasn't the effects of ditchweed on my feeble little mind either.  This music showed me possibilities that I didn't even know existed, but instantly knew I'd wanted all along.  The fact that only three guys could produce such a vast array of sounds blew my mind.  The fact that rock music could be entertaining and artistic at the same time shaped my musical view to this day.<br /><br />The next morning I threw away my Kiss records and went off to the mall to buy this album and then-new \\"Going for the One\\" by Yes, who I had also heard described as \\"progressive.\\"  They were the first two \\"adult\\" albums I ever bought.  I began expanding my electric guitar skills (goodbye Tony Iommi riffs!) and learned to finger-pick acoustic guitar like Lifeson and Howe.  I taught myself organ and piano.  I discovered Genesis, ELP, Pink Floyd, King Crimson and many, many more.<br /><br />With all that personal attachment to this record, I can even overlook the absolute clinker that is \\"Cinderella Man.\\"(Geez,Even typing that title makes me shudder.) But that's nothing folks, you get the stunningly great title track (one of my all-time favorite prog songs) plus the amazing epics \\"Cygnus X-1\\" and \\"Xanadu.\\"  And, classic-rock overkill aside, \\"Closer to the Heart\\" is one of the best prog singles ever with a truly great guitar solo. For prog fans, it rarely gets better than this.<br /><br />The greatest export from our Northern neighbors since Molson Canadian-the best beer ever, baby!!!gs) plus the amazing epics \\"Cygnus X-1\\" and \\"Xanadu.\\"  And, classic-rock overkill aside, \\"Closer to the Heart\\" is one of the best prog singles ever with a truly great guitar solo.

B0002OERI0|5.0|A few years back I was a major Green Day fan and I don't think that ever went away. I might have listened to them so much but I was still a big fan and then they come out with American Idiot. This is a great album and I recommend it to anyone. They have matured in ways but remain as young as they once were with hits like Jesus of Suburbia, St. Jimmy and The Death of St. Jimmy: <br /> <br />American Idiot- 4.5/5 Great rocking single. <br /> <br />Jesus of Suburbia-i. Jesus of Suburbia- 4.5/5 A great start for a long stretch on track two, a cool song about drugs and just being crazy. Hardly about Jesus <br /> <br />ii. City of the Damned- 5/5 Part 2 of a 9 min. 2nd track. An 80's type song with great vocals and amazing background music <br /> <br />iii. I Don't Care- 5/5 The best part of the 9 minutes, which has never been done before, not that I know of anyway. With the five tracks in one thing. It's a very rock song and an amazing bridge. <br /> <br />iv. Dearly Beloved- 3.5/5 Not the greatest, it's slower and half of it is pretty pointless but deep down, it does have some meaning and it is rather pleasant to listen to. <br /> <br />v. Tales of Another Broken Home- 5/5 Awesome rock song, love it!! <br /> <br />Holiday- 5/5 Finally out of the 2nd track and to an upbeat 3rd track. Fun song. <br /> <br />Boulevard of Broken Dreams- 5/5 A slower song about being alone and all you have is yourself, it's great. <br /> <br />Are we the Waiting- 4/5 It's cool, in the mix between slow and rock. <br /> <br />St. Jimmy- 5/5 Classic, good rock song. <br /> <br />Give Me Novacaine- 4.5/5 Slower but still great. <br /> <br />She's A Rebel- 5/5 The best song on the album. Upbeat and fun. <br /> <br />Extraordinary Girl- 3.5/5 Egyptian style song but still pretty cool. <br /> <br />Letterbomb- 5/5 Another great song. I think it is a little mean spirited, but I'm not offended and any fan of Green Day, wouldn't be either, so that's not a problem. It's rock. <br /> <br />Wake Me Up When September Ends- 5/5 A sad slow song, it's so beautiful and motivational(lol) <br /> <br />Homecoming-i. The Death of St. Jimmy- 5/5 Another very motivational song, about Jimmy's, who is made up by the way, death <br /> <br />ii. East 12th Street- 5/5 A great follow up to the next sequence of 9 minutes and 5 songs. <br /> <br />iii. Nobody Likes You- 5/5 The background sounds awesome and the song is just so cool. <br /> <br />iv. Rock and Roll Girlfriend- 3/5 Pretty silly but just the same, it's all right. <br /> <br />v. We're Coming Home Again- 4.5/5 And the conclusion which is also very cool. <br /> <br />Whatsername- 5/5 Ties for the best song on the album. It is slow but it picks up half way through and turns out to be a fantastic song. <br /> <br />Any Green Day fan should get this. And anyone should get this. These guys are awesome!!
B0002858YS|4.0|Because my musical database is so large, all I have to compare these guys to is the recent Franz Ferninand and Interpol, though they seem to be resemble the former qualitatively a bit more, as Interpol seems to stand somewhere on a higher plane.      Anyway, I took in \\"Hot Fuss\\" after falling in love with the blazingly catchy \\"Somebody Told Me\\", which, like Ferninand's \\"Take Me Out\\", has got to be one of the better singles released in the past year, or more. It's unbelievably catchy, with a hook that will dig so deep you'll be crying for more. Not all songs warrant many repeat listens, but \\"Somebody\\" is certainly worthy of them. Thankfully, because the three songs preceeding and two proceeding it all retain wonderful hooks and groovidelic (?) melodies, one need not repeat any song inparticular, as the first thirty minutes of the album are consistently excellent and incredibly fun to listen to. Great energy, great hooks, great times.    Unfortunately with \\"Believe Me Natalie\\" the album takes a bit of a nose dive; actually it begins with the lukewarm \\"Change Your Mind\\", but whatever.     The album is often unapologetically pompous, as heard in the raging choirs hovering behind the lead's vocals in \\"Andy, You're a Star\\" and \\"All These Things That I've Done\\", but its a blistering confidence that freaking screams through these headphones, and I must say is really sheer delight to hear.     I can't seem to get \\"Smile Like You Mean It\\" out of my head, and simply because the first half of this album is so incredibly easy to listen to and immensely enjoyable, I give the album four stars. It might only deserve three and a half or so, but what the hey? This is too much fun.
0671027387|3.0|This was an avg. book in the aggregate, however if you have read any of Dan Brown's others, this one will surely leave no surprises.  The plot is extremely predictable.  That being said, I would strongly suggest reading Angles & Demonds or the Da Vinci Code before reading this as to not spoil the plot of Mr. Brown's best two books.  If you have read the two--A&D and DVC, than this should be a quick and fun read, albeit not extremly surprising.
B0000TB014|4.0|I really liked this DVD.  It was a good price, and had a good collection of some awesome music videos.  The only reason I gave it four stars, is because there were a couple good videos that were left out, but that's why you buy the other volumes.   <br />The videos showed on this DVD however, were really great.  They are quality videos to watch whenever.  My favorites are of course the most popular, Thriller, Bad, and Black and White.  I was a little disapointed that there wasn't much moonwalking, but it really showed Michael at some of the good times of his life.  He was so talented.
B00068IOWM|1.0|Hello hello, the new U2 album came out yesterday in Japan and I had to buy it being a u2 fan.  I had in fact downloaded the album, which were early mixes of the songs.  Sadly though, the final mixes aren't too different, with the exception of some added bass and pumped up bass lines, most notably on sometimes you can't make it on your own, it helps hide the chord progression which I do not like.  I did like the final versions a little better than the early demos but the album is sub-standard for u2.  If you were hoping for a hard rock album with heavy guitar, don't!  The majority of the album is slow slow slow.  Its good music for divorced women over the age of 40!  The album is sterile, lacking heart, soul, honest emotion and creativity.  Quite frankly, this is one the worst albums I have ever heard from a major recording artist.  They should be ashamed of this.  Its an abomination.  The album gets a D-, vertigo saves it from being a F.   <br /> <br />To elaborate further, the album suffers mostly from poor lyrics, which it has in spades, (Don't look before you laugh.  Look ugly in a photograph...  I've seen the clothes you made.  Can you see the beauty inside of me?) and slow uninventive music which sounds as if they tried to remake stuck in a moment and walk on over a half a dozen times.  When you get down to the root of the issue, it is not what they promised or promoted, a guitar driven album.  I strongly urge not buying this CD, but do what you most.   <br /> <br />Fast cars, the extra track on the Japanese version, rocks.  Fast tempo and Arabic guitars, what's not to like?  The title of the album can be found within these lyrics as well.
B0002Z0EYA|4.0|While this film is obviously not a history lesson, as its detractors are determined to hammer home, it IS a grand entertainment.  The \\"homemade\\" critics who seem to crave accuracy over entertainment might want to remember that the purpose of big-budget movies is to MAKE MONEY!  (SURPRISE!) And the History Channel is just perfect for those who really like history. <br /> <br />Our smug cousin \\"critic\\" in England might do well to remember it is American films, not British ones, that have the overwhelming history of selling tickets and entertaining the people.  And as far as history is concerned, we Americans know enough about it to realize that the British would have been speaking German long ago if it were not for Americans putting their lives on the line for some apparently unappreciative \\"dandies\\" who think they won the world wars, a fact some patronizing British AND French might also do well to remember!
B00065JTBA|2.0|I loved Bon Jovi growing up and was excited that there were all these unreleased songs that everyone seems to be saying are worth something. Unfortunately, the set is good only as proof as to why the songs never made it on their previous albums. They are simply inferior. I urge Bon Jovi fans to listen to some selection before forking the $40+ dollars to buy the set.
B0002XH9Z4|4.0|Great cuts.  They sound great.  Good job of remastering.  The album is great fun.  It will be a lot more fun to see what Mike looks like after a couple months in prison.  Now that will be a THRILLER!!!  Yikes!
0930289234|4.0|Overall, I liked this book. It had a very good story for a comic. Most superhero stuff is kinda flat and predictable, but there is all sort of things going on in Watchmen. I liked the authenticity of it - it felt like it could really happen. I know superheros are a fantasy, but its fun to look at what would probably happen if they were real/ or lived in a realistic world.<br /><br />The writing by Alan Moore was top-notch, although kinda wordy at times and confusing with 2 or 3 plots running at once. The art was equally good, Dave Gibbons doing the majority of the artwork.<br /><br />If you're a fan of superhero comics, and if you're an adult(this has some nudity in it and violence and such), check this out. If you're not a big superhero fan, and like stuff like Little Nemo more, this is still worth a look-see - it's a great book.
B00005JNBQ|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie. It was realistic and the people actually looked like real people instead of models. I'm glad they finally decided to make a movie from a geeky person's point of view, since most of the crap that is supposed to portray 'teen life' is stupid and fake like the O.C. For those people who complain it doesn't have a plot, so what? That's what makes it more realistic, as real life doesn't have much of a plot. Get over it.
B000002LE6|3.0|\\"Lovesexy\\" will not satisfy the casual Prince fan. I purchase this album as a kid and never quite got the content of it. I'm older now and I rediscovered it a few years ago. I think that it's one of Prince's best albums. I respect him as an artist and the risk of producing non-radio material. I showcased his skills as a musician and how he always challenged himself to move in unfamiliar territory. It also further has fascination with the blurring lines of spirituality and sexuality. It also includes one of his funkiest tunes ever, \\"Alphabet Street.\\" I think that \\"Alphabet Street\\" is down right dirty and funky. I love it! The title cut is also great and \\"Glam Slam\\" is a tune that you'll grow to love. \\"Lovesexy\\" is a must-have for all Prince fans.
B0002Z9HT8|5.0|I just got this today, and it is incredible! I was too young (3 years old) to see the original, so for me, this is the closest I'll ever get to seeing it live, and it's worth every penny and then some! While some did mention missing performances, you'll never notice unless you're looking for them, the included ones are so great! I was a little nervous about technical difficulties myself, but other than some occasional \\"banding\\" (lines across the screen) it's flawless. And even that is only noticeable in certain particularly loud spots (as described in the program) and doesn't take anything away from the show. I am really impressed at how seamless the transition from UK to US and back again throughout the program went. You wouldn't even know it sometimes if it weren't for the stage differences. Truly great work on here! <br /> <br />Also, this is an absolute MUST for any Queen fan out there! Freddie and the guys are in rare form; the crowd just goes nuts for them!  <br /> <br />Of course, beyond the musical entertainment is the much more serious facts that led to the event to begin with: people fighting, and more often than not, failing, to survive in Africa. It's incredible to realize that wealthy countries such as the US have done so little to help such a poor country. It's not like we don't have the resources!  <br /> <br />Okay, I'll step down from my soapbox now. But seriously, go get this thing. Whether you want to relive seeing it before, or are seeing it for the very first time, you'll never regret it!
B0002Z9HT8|5.0|First of all for those that are moaning about there being songs missing from the dvd...can you read??? It is all explained in the booklet. It's not like this has being marketed as \\"The Complete Live Aid\\".  Secondly..watch the prequel with the news report about the famine in Ethiopia and just thank god that some missing footage is all you have to moan about. <br />This is a great set featuring great performances. Queen and U2 stand out for me. It's like a time capsule from 1985 has been discovered! <br />I thought it was very reasonably priced for a 4 DVD set so anyone accusing this of being a quick cash in is being ridiculous...the profits go to the Live Aid Trust for heavens sake! I for one would be glad if in a few years they find more footage and put this out in an extended version....I'd buy that too. This will do nicely for now. All you moaners can hold on to your crappy bootleg videos.
B00006690G|4.0|Eminem is a talented guy. He has a smooth flow, great lyrics, and always suprises. He's not your typical money/cars/ho's/violence rapper. He writes about whatever he feels- not what his record company is feeling. This album is amazing, I can't tell you how many times its helped me vent my anger thats been given off by teachers, bullies, etc. I'm NOT a preppy/cool kid in school, I'm more of an outcast type, and I stay to myself. This album really speaks to me in alot of ways. Anyways, theres just something about Eminem's vocals and flow that grabs you like no other hip-hop artist. He's the only one who can give me the chills (the bridge rap in Hailie's Song gives me goosebumps everytime I hear it) and make me sing along at the same time. If there is 1 problem with the CD- its the way eh DELIVERS the lyrics, not the actual topics he talks about. Sometimes the stuff he throws in just to rhyme words ends up being stupid and off-topic, but if you have a sense of humor, its easy to deal with.
B000002LFU|2.0|Unfortunately, I bought this on the advice of love-is-blind REM fans, and ignored the level-headed reviewers. <br />Most of the songs are filler-drivel. Orange Crush is OK and you've probably heard it many times on alternative radio. But even OC, though it has a big sound, is repetitive.  <br />I don't like being threatened, as is done in Turn You Inside-out, and I can't stand the self-centered whiney blathering of several other songs - World Leader Pretend, I Remember California, Hairshirt, etc. Go ahead count the number of times the vocals start out, \\"I...\\". It's annoying. Yes, there are a couple of decent songs and good musicianship, but I expect more from REM. <br />If you still want a copy I'll be selling mine...
B000000WA4|5.0|I was lukewarm to this CD when I first heard it back in 2000. But now that I've expanded my musical horizon I surprisingly find myself loving this CD. I have a 3-disk CD player and after listening to Siamese Dream from beginning to end, I listen to this two disk CD from beginning to end. One of my favorite rock albums. <br /> <br />This is Billy Corgan's most honest album and he's being true to his nature as an artist by expanding his instrumental and lyrical tastes: the songs at times can differ from rock to techno but they all reflect Corgan's view of his own world. There are bound to be some songs people generally try to avoid but I've found myself liking some songs more than others. Yet I would say that depending on my mood I could find myself listening to some songs I generally don't listen to. <br /> <br />Everyone has their own opinions; this is one of my favorite albums of my CD collection. I'd suggest to people who haven't listened to all the songs that they should try and find a Pumpkins site that plays the songs in full(there are quite a few) rather than listening to samples because samples won't give you the full intensity of the songs. I wouldn't recommend anyone buying this album without at least sampling the songs because many people have found the songs tedious. Even though I could hear the songs from beginning to end for free on realplayer I decided to buy it used because I want to take this CD with me where I can't listen to it on computer. <br /> <br />This album is awkward in its own way and many people don't like it. I recommend listening to the songs and reading the lyrics to see if it's up to your tastes.
0156027321|5.0|In the beginning of Life of Pi, a fellow tells the narrator that he has a story which will make him believe in God. A man who says as much is either bold and very right, or arrogant and quite wrong.  <br /> <br />A boy named Pi is lost at sea when the cruiseliner he and his family are on board en route to North America from India sinks in the middle of the ocean. He manages to get aboard a lifeboat, with only a hyena, orangutan, zebra and tiger as companions. A harrowing journey takes place over a period of months where Pi and his \\"crew\\" brave the elements: starvation, dehydration, sun, storms and hallucinations. <br /> <br />Portions of the book read like diary entries, and as such are of disparate lengths in accordance with both the narrator's mindset at the time and whatever may have been happening in recent memory. <br /> <br />Does the book deliver? There are some who will say no because of the unusual ending, but I say that this is exactly why the novel works so well because it makes you think about the ways in which we bend reality. If there are different ways of telling the same story, who is to say that one version is better than the other? And as to the claim that this tale will make you believe in God...? I say that this makes me believe all the more in the fact that God exists--such a journey is too amazing for me to believe otherwise. <br /> <br />This novel is a winner and well worth a look. Highly recommended.

B00000ILDE|4.0|The big draw to the Aliens Special Edition is 17 minutes of addition footage originally shot by James Cameron in 1986 but omitted from the theatrical cut. Watching these scenes and moments integrated into the movie, I'm struck by the same thought as when viewing the extended versions of The Abyss and T2: exactly what a shrewd job Cameron did editing these movies for theatrical release. The good news here is that, unlike the T2 Special Edition, none of the \\"extra\\" footage in the Aliens SE is bad. It's just not necessary, and pads a movie that in its theatrical cut is a stripped-down thrill machine. <br /> <br />In the theatrical release the subplot involving Ripley's daughter who died while she was lost in space, and scenes of Newt's family finding the alien spaceship, were cut because Cameron felt they slowed down the beginning of the film, that the important thing was to get the Marines on the planet dealing with the aliens as fast as possible. And he was right. Other bits, like Bill Paxton as Private Hudson being an aggravating a-hole to Ripley on the drop ship as only Bill Paxton can (that was a compliment, by the way), or Ripley and Hicks telling each other their first names just before Ripley goes after Newt, or Ripley hesitating before first entering the terraforming complex because she's so scared she can barely make herself do it, or the entire robot sentry sequence the embattled survivors use as an ineffective attempt to wipe out the aliens before they can reach them, are all great in and of themselves, but again aren't necessary to the story and slow down the film. <br /> <br />I give the original theatrical cut of Aliens 5 stars. The Special Edition I give 4 just because, once we get through the \\"extra\\" footage, most of which is early on, the movie still rocks. I'm glad I saw the Aliens Special Edition. My advice, if you want to own Aliens at its best, buy the theatrical cut on DVD. If you want to see the Special Edition, borrow it from the library and save your money.

0790729369|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed the movie which is very deftly directed by Eastwood. Handling such a delicate story in a so cinematically elegant way, leaves an enduring mark about the directorial abilities of Clint Eastwood. He also gives a very measured performance alongwith Meryl Streep as the protagonists.  The music is also a high-point of the movie.
B00003CWLF|1.0|I started out reading the book, Anna and The King of Siam y Margaret Landom. It was a decent book, I fell asleep reading it on occasions. I read it for a school project, not byu choice. I am a freshman at High School in New Jersey. I am in an English 1 Honors Course - so basically I am doing projects that are long, annoying, and overall things I don't want to do. Anyway, anfter reading the book I had to watch the movie based on the book.    MY MOVIE REVIEW:    This movie was completely inaccurate. It is based on the musical, The King and I, which is based on the book I read (Anna and the King of Siam by Margaret Landon). My book was based on the two memoirs Anna Leonowens, herself, wrote. Much of what Anna wrote in her memoirs was false. \\"Her memoirs were so full of mistakes that no one who reads them now and knows something of Thais in hose days can take them seriously\\" I read that quote in a book I was using to research her. Basically, her memoirs were so false that people who knew of Thais couldn't take the novels seriously. So even though the movie is good, it's accuracy is completely horrible. The movie makers, from what I have researched, have claimed it to be a real story. But in reality, it's not. It's all fiction!    Movie makers lied. The movie is not true, and honestly, I am glad it isn't. In reality King Mongkut was in his 60s when Anna came. Now, think about Anna falling for a 60 year old? And she was in her late 20s early 30s, if I remember right. I could further this noting all the real facts, but if you want real facts about Anna Leonowens, you can check out this website:    [...]    It is one of the sources I will be using on my report.    In conclusion, movie was good, but completely false.  I spent what, 2 hours watching this inaccurate movie?    I WANT MY 2 HOURS BACK! Come on, I have better things to do than waste my time watching a non-fiction movie that's not even true. Thank you very much for wasting 2 hours of my life. I could have better spent my time increasing the number of obeast people in this world by eating a bag of potato chips and other unhealthy foods.
0670033693|5.0|I was extremely lucky to have an advance copy of The Cold Dish find its way to my nightstand.  Now, having read the book, I believe it should come with a large, bright-red, warning sticker on the cover that reads, \\"WARNING:  THIS BOOK CAUSES READERS TO EXPERIENCE UNNATURAL EXCITEMENT AND HAS BEEN KNOWN TO CAUSE THE EDGE OF YOUR SEAT TO WEAR OUT BEFORE THE REST OF THE CHAIR!\\"  This is quite simply one of the best reads I've come across in years.  Craig Johnson's characters will make you laugh, cry, fall in love, bite your fingernails down to the nub and dare I say...(dare, dare)...Hope for a sequel.
B000021Y77|5.0|This German film is a fascinating exposition in how events in our lives that my seem trivial can actually have a huge effect in the long run.  Much like Ray Bradbury's butterfly, who's death in prehistoric times forever changed how the English language was written, this movie explores the domino effect.  By exploring three different outcomes from the same triggered event, it successfully reminds us that every moment of our lives is important.  Through the film, some of the differences between the three versions are very obvious, and some are quite subtle.  I enjoy such subtlety, as it allows me to watch the film more than once and see new things each time.   <br />Beyond the philosophy and creativity of the storyline, this film is also very well shot.  Bright colors and eye candy fill the 80 minute showing, complimented with heart-racing fast-paced editing and manic visual effects.  By the end of the film, one might be just as exhausted as Lola.   <br />I have not seen a lot of German cinema, myself, but after seeing this film, I think its time I explored their exports more.
B0001NBMBC|3.0|I suppose this is an OKAY album, I gave it less credit than it deserves upon first hearing it. <br /> <br />It's quite melodic actually, as it would appear Corey Taylor (vocalist) has fallen inlove with an acoustic guitar. <br /> <br />The majority of the songs on Vol. 3, are melody-ridden, and this may displease a few fans of Slipknot, I sure was disappointed to say the least. <br /> <br />But if you can see past the extensive melody, you'll actually enjoy this cd. <br /> <br />Vermillion and Vermillion II are 2 of the best Slip songs i've ever heard. <br /> <br />I reccomend this cd only to loyal fans, otherwise, skip this.
B000002H33|4.0|Battery: Awesome guitars and pounding drums open are a great way to start the album. A Metallica classic. 8/10 <br />Master Of Puppets: Stunning guitars all the way through, including 2 solos. 10/10 <br />The Thing that Should Not Be: Heavy riff and creepy lyrics. 7/10 <br />Welcome Home(Sanitarium): The Fade To Black of this album. Well written with a crazy solo. 9/10 <br />Disposable Heroes: Song with strong anti-war lyrics. 7/10 <br />Leper Messiah: Another heavy song with some angry lyrics. 7/10 <br />Orion: Beautifully written instrumental in which Cliff really shines. 8/10 <br />Damage Inc.: Fast paced thrash. great way to end this masterpiece. 8/10 <br />Overall: 64/80, or exactly 4 stars. Some songs could have been rated a little better, but they're all either great or above average.
B0002YCVXI|5.0|I purchased the CD within the past two weeks and, contrary to a couple of the reviewers (I considered the source!) I found the marriage of Yo Yo Ma's playing of the Morricone scores to be provocative and yet not intrusive.  The sensitivity of Yo Yo Ma's interpretation is on a par with the great screen scores of Morricone: the subtle nuances really enhanced the orchestral settings!  Yo Yo Ma does not dominate but rather supplies an embroidery to the scores.  Being a romanticist who is a composer/performer/conductor/arranger, I find the CD continues to thrill me after more than a dozen hearings.  I still discover new and innovative things that compel me to listen again and again.  I have recommended this CD to all of my friends/colleagues and associates. <br /> <br />Sincerely, <br /> <br />Wilbur E.

B0000CAXIC|4.0|Doll: A nice, soft opener that lulls you before Monkeywrench 6/10 <br />Monkeywrench: A fast paced rocker. Awesome opeing riff and an awesome shouted bridge by Dave. 8/10 <br />Hey johny Park!: Beautifully written lyrics and, once again, some great guitars. 9/10 <br />My Poor Brain: Loud and aggressive choruses and soft falsetto verses. Great song. 7/10 <br />Wind Up: Pretty good guitars and vocals. 6/10 <br />Up In Arms: A solid pop love song. 5/10 <br />My Hero: A great drum track with some awesome lyrics. 9/10 <br />See You: Upbeat acoustic number that's fun to sing along to. 6/10 <br />Enough Space: A good song to listen to when angry. The bass in this one really shines. 6/10 <br />February Stars: A beautiful ballad. Leads perfectly into Everlong. 7/10 <br />Everlong: The most gorgeous and romantic song FF have ever written. Guitars, vocals, and drums are all perfect. 10/10 <br />Walking After You: Another wonderfully written ballad. I love the lyrics towards the end of this album. 7/10 <br />New Way Home: A tremendous way to close a tremendous album. Well done guys! 8/10 <br />Overall: 94/130, or just under 4 stars. The album really is more than the sum of its parts. Songs like Up In Arms and Wind Up are still great, but they're nothing that special, so they received 5s and 6s which are about average. Only the better songs get 7 and above in my system. <br />
B00005JNBQ|5.0|This has got to be one of the most penetratingly funny movies I've ever experienced. Yes, it is an experience. The subtle genius is that the characters in this movie are so real because they possess characteristics we all readily recognize. Uncle \\"Glory Days\\" Rico, Kip the computer bound shut-in, Rex the overly aggressive, small minded, \\"business man\\". Then there are the jerks at the high school including the arrogant, big-fish-in-a-little-bowl, cheerleader and wannabe class president, Summer. How many times have we seen those people in our everyday lives? Then there's the butchy looking grandma and the blatant mispronunciation of Mexican food names. Uncle Rico with his get-rich-quick-schemes. Anything sounding familiar yet? And of course, there's Pedro, the innocent, even keeled and socially detached teenage Mexican who serendipitously slogs through the high school social strata to \\"make all your dreams come true\\". This is one of those few films that left me thinking about it for days afterwards. I still find myself quoting much of the movie with my kids and wife and laughing. Thank you Jared and wife for a movie that does not contain the trite and sterilized characters the Hollywood folks think we want. Excellent job!
B00003CY6M|3.0|i am a guy, and i bought this DVD for one line.  i saw part of the film on HBO and thought Piven's line \\"You... are... a ja*k-a**\\" on the plane was qool.  when i saw the rest of the film i kept thinking Cusack's character is such a wuss that would turn off any woman, especially one as beautiful as Kate Beckinsale.  he is, from the start, needy, talkative, pushy, boring, etc.  face it girls, if any guy tried that on you, you'd file a restraining order -- but no, because it happened in a movie its all ok.  im more handsome than Cusack, much more witty, and ive never had anything even remotely similar happen to me.
B0002NRRAG|5.0|I've had 55 years of intense listening to jazz and blues singers and this is one you don't want to miss. I only hope I can see her in person one day...
B00064MW6A|3.0|I liked the movie, eventhough most guys I talked with didn't. I think it was cute and my daughter sure loved the punch lines and the leather suit. However, I thought the writers could've put in a lot more work. Her identity was discovered too soon and the rest plot was a little flimsy. I liked the fact that this movie appealed to women, especially after watching both Spiderman and Spiderman 2! There's no comparison because women still can't seem to get enough justice :)...I can't wait to add this one to my personal collection.
B0002XDODU|5.0|...And that's just one of the reasons to totally dig this album.  They don't even speak English and they're coming up with great wordplay like that. <br /> <br />Rammstein are averaging 2 albums per decade.  When the much-anticipated tracks are finally released, there's an expectation of perfection surrouding them, and they have never let their supporters down. <br /> <br />This album is magnificent.  The riffs, the tunes, Till's voice, they just stick in your head for days, almost to the point where I believe I could actually listen to the whole album in my mind if I were sitting quietly in a library for an hour. <br /> <br />\\"Los\\" is the track that blew me away.  This is a startling departure for them; it's acoustic, bluesy, there's even a harmonica solo.  Right now, it's my second favourite Rammstein song ever, after \\"Sonne\\".  But here's the really interesting thing about \\"Los\\"; it's a decidedly \\"American\\" sounding song, with the blues riffs, the harp, and all that.  How ironic, then, that it segues right into \\"Amerika\\".  That obviously can't be a \\"coincidence\\" or an \\"accident\\"; as usual, though, we're left to our own devices in rationalizing the meaning behind this odd sequencing of songs.  Possibly their way of pointing out that America began as a country full of true heart and spirit, then degenerated into corporate whoredom? <br /> <br />\\"Amerika\\" is a fantastic song, and the video, with the boys looking decidedly clean-cut American with their Bryllcreamed hair plastered down and parted meticulously on the side, really gets the point across.  \\"Moskau\\", well, that's uncharted territory for me as well; now, for the first time, there's a balls-out jam in TWO languages that I don't know a word of! <br /> <br />There's two things that really worry me.  First, if everything stays the same, the new Rammstein album won't be released until 2007.  Second, I keep checking their website for dates of their American tour, and there are none.  I sincerely hope that the tragedies in the Chicago nightclub and the Great White concert disaster have not caused the powers that be to refuse to let Rammstein stage their pyrotechnics, because Rammstein fiercely stand by their commitment to give their fans the best show possible, and they've said they won't play anywhere they're not allowed to do the pyrotechnics. <br /> <br />I'll fly over and see them in Europe if I have to, but I will see them. <br /> <br />Oh yeah; definitely get this album.  It rocks, and that's all good.
0670033693|5.0|This is an amazing book!  I was fortunate enough to get hold of a pre-publication copy and found myself completely transported.  As a matter of fact, I read it in one sitting.  That this is a mystery is a given, but it is more than that. To me the truly outstanding feature of the book is its character quality.  These people are real.  Also, Mr. Johnson has pictured surroundings as authentic as the mixture of people who live in them.  Of particular interest to me is the contrast and blending of Native American and European cultures.  With his handling of character, setting, and plot, this is a book for everyone.
B0000029DD|5.0|It's such a shame I couldn't give this album more than 5 stars. I'd give it all the stars in the universe if they were available. This is likely one of the best albums ever made. Every song on it is different. Every song has it's own life,it's own spirit. Sure, there may be covers... but I can honestly say, I like Jeff's versions better than the originals. His rendition of Leonard Cohen's \\"Hallelujah\\" is definitely the best I've heard. I especially like his cover of Benjamin Britten's \\"Corpus Christi Carol\\"... it takes SERIOUS talent to falsetto something like that and still make it sound GOOD. \\"Lover, You Should've Come Over\\" is a great song. One of my favorites. \\"Grace\\",the title track.. is exquisite.^_^. I like \\"So Real\\", and I like the way it fits with the rest of the album. \\"Lilac Wine\\" is really pretty. I can feel the images in the song! The song taken off of it, \\"Forget Her\\" would have fit just as nicely on it. I'm thankful it's now in the Legacy Edition. It's so nice to have a nice studio copy :).. Dream Brother is absolutely haunting. I've never heard anything like it. Eternal Life, the same thing. Maybe I'm weird.. but I like the lyrics of it. .. Mojo Pin and Last Goodbye are great too.. last, but not least. I love them all. This is definitely an album that should be in every cd collection!
B0002Z9HT8|4.0|Because of a death in my family at the age of 15, I wasn't available to watch ANY of this musically momentous day. So I didn't even get the benefit of a needed diversion amidst family tragedy. I had to suffice with a glossy souvenir book of the show and only imagine what it was like. It was later said that this event would NEVER be released on home video due to the sheer number of artists' involved and the expected legal wranglings. Even though this may not be the ENTIRE program, for me it is better than nothing - an experience I thought I'd never see.
B0006284JQ|3.0|I love Britney Spears.She has some really good songs.I have 1 MAJOR complaint about this cd:SOME GOOD SONGS ARE MISSING.They are: <br />1)From The Bottom Of My Broken Heart <br />2)Born To Make You Happy <br />3)Don't Let Me Be The Last To Know <br />THE SONGS THAT DON'T NEED TO BE ON HERE: <br />1)Outrageous-This was NEVER a hit <br />2)Boys-SUCKS!!!! <br />3)Overprotected-SUCKS!!!!!! <br />   You can get almost all of her hits on 1 cd.Buy this cd. <br /> <br />
0790729369|4.0|Love this movie. It is incredibly moving and it is superb at creating erotic tension and build-up. Have to admit to tearing up on this one. Because of the choices made by the characters? Yes, of course. But there's ANOTHER reason: this is available only in a terrible, \\"full-frame\\" edition only. Whoever is in charge of home entertainment / dvd at Warner Bros. needs to get his / her a$$ and RELEASE THIS IN WIDESCREEN AND LOAD IT UP WITH EXTRAS!!!
B00004T9UF|5.0|oh no this b*ch a again eastnuga18 suck a d*ck.eminem is one of the best rapper out there b*ch. f*ck brooklyn
B00005QHPQ|5.0|This cd is so good i don't really know how to start. OK, my fave song is #7 Maybe because of its smooth lyrics and music and the great vocal performance. My least fave song is #6 Love 4 Fun because i feel the lyrics are kinda childish. This cd is great latin pop music with influences from electro/techno and acoustic sounds. If ur an Enrique fan from his previous cds and haven't gotten this one yet then u really should. And #1 Escape is the only single u've heard from this cd and u liked it, then also get this cd beacause it will get u moving just like the single. This is a cd u'll want to listen to over and over again.

B0002OERI0|5.0|I've been a fan of Green Day since the Kerplunk! era.  But after Dookie, I felt like they lost their touch..I was like eh... when I heard their other albums.  So I was reluctant to get this one.  But when I heard the buzz of how good it was, I decided to give it a listen.  I also saw them do a live set on Fuse which caught my attention.  They sounded great.   <br />This album brings back the old Green Day and once again reminds me of why I started listening to them.  Billie Joe's voice is awesome and all the songs have the old Green Day edge to it.  It's a very solid album.  If you've always liked Green Day, definitely pick it up.
1401300901|2.0|I was under the wrong impression from reading the back cover.  I didn't realise that Gerry had written the notes prior to him dying, I thought it was a supernatural type book where he gives her the letters from beyond.    Ok, so I was still willing to give it a go.  Like someone else said, the family/friends were such stereotypes that it made it seem like the author was trying too hard to be \\"cool\\".      There was many times i couldn't believe she wanted us to believe things way too coincedental.  Like, a small type movie her brother made, made the girls famous.  So famous that they even have fans recognise them when they are at the airport.  Then conveniently they're all on the same plane together.  And then even more convienantly, sitting next to them on the plane. Please.  As if.        The only thing I smiled at was the boss' remark to Holly about the Botanical Gardens.  I thought that was really sweet, and showed the strength yet also weakness of her boss.      Don't recommend it.  Too cheesy.  Too predictable.  Too bland, boring and BLAH!
B0002Y69NQ|5.0|I cant wait to purchase this special edition set. I have researched this set online and have found tons of info on them. But i am trying to decide which one to buy. Does anyone know what is actually in the 80 page book????
B00005176F|5.0|Like most people, the song that turned me on to blur is \\"song 2\\", when I saw the video for \\"coffee and TV\\" I thought it was crap, it was nothing like \\"song 2\\". And how wrong I was, now coffee and TV is one of my most fav blur songs, next to \\"this is a low\\", \\"beetlebum\\", \\"parklife\\", and of course \\"country house\\". Blur is much better than you think if you know them only from \\"song 2\\".  <br />Now the old fued.Oasis and blur are both good bands, when it comes to creativity blur wins.  When it comes to consistency Oasis wins.  <br />
B0002MPU1K|5.0|One of the best records I bought this year. Extremely refreshing, new approach, unique voice, and virtuosic piano chops. The most impressive part about this record is his songwriting. Not many people in this world can marry words an music together in the way this young man does. This is the beginning of something very powerful and you can hear it in his songwriting. In years to come this guy will make a an extraordinary imprint on the fabric of music.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|Everyone seems to miss the point. Turn off the sound and just watch Lost in Translation. This movie is actually cinematic, that is, it tells a story in pictures. It doesn't need words to define its meaning, to interpret. There's a line by the poet Lorca, something like, \\"Poetry is what survives translation.\\" Turn off the sound. Sophia Coppola is that good. <br /> <br />Another thing, to everyone who saw this movie as xenophobic and racially insulting a) other cultures do make fun of us and our big cars and fat a**'s and b) buck up little shavers, I bet you feel all the world's pain. You're sensitive and that's really nice but those scenes where Bob and Charlotte are faced with the \\"difference\\" and make fun of the \\"difference\\", its kind the point. That's what people do when they're afraid. It's true. It's part of the inadvertent neural coding that helps us to believe the movie. The scared little monkey in all of us believes that. <br /> <br />Look this movie isn't for everyone. And I am way too old to get caught up in trying to change anyone's mind but if you liked this movie, check out Akira Kuurosawa's  Dreams, it'll be right up your alley. And if you didn't like Lost in Translation, nobody will get hurt. <br />
B0002IVN9W|5.0|God, I wish everyone would stop with the hype talk. The Arcade Fire are virtually unheard of in the UK except for among my small group of friends. No big hype at all. But I'm sure there will be, when everyone else catches up. I first heard about this album from a Canadian friend, not from any particular media source. So I had already heard them when I read a review on Pitchfork, which frankly, people should stop complaining about, it's better than rubbish like the NME... <br />   Although most of the time I agree with Pitchfork, they recently gave the debut album from a band called 'Hope of the States' a mere 5.7, which is scandalous. I assumed they'd have the same hyper-critical view of 'Funeral', but I was pleasantly surprised...anyway, don't listen to critics opinions, develop your own. Don't listen to lazy comparisons, or unjustified criticism, anyone who just calls this a product of the hype machine is a heartless moron who treats music like this for granted (probably). <br /> <br />oh well... <br /> <br />Just buy it, everyone needs this music....
0618164413|5.0|This is the ultimate compendium for all Curious George enthusiasts.  I nearly cried when the Man In The Yellow Hat forgave George after another one of his ruckuses.  George is quite the rapscallion, I must say.  We can all learn something from the young monkey who always gets into trouble.  Can he even be compared to Heathcliff, that wacky, tricky cat?!  Perhaps the two should engage in a battle of the wills.  All in all, this was an incredible read.  A very crunk book, especially for those of you who love yellow hats.
B00004U2G4|4.0|The first Beck solo album is one of the best of british rock in the late sixties and had influence to many others in the following years like Led Zeppelin second album. In spite of some people think that Led Zeppelin was a better band than Jeff Beck Group, there is no reason that demostrate this. Jimmy Page plagiarized \\"You Need Love\\" a song written by Willie Dixon and retitled it \\"Whole Lotta Love\\"; \\"The Lemon Song\\" is \\"Killing Floor\\", a song by Howlin' Wolf; \\"Rock 'n' Roll\\" begins equal to \\"Keep a-knockin'\\" by Little Richard; \\"Starway To Heaven\\" contains parts of \\"Taurus\\" (Spirit) and \\"And She's Gone\\" (Chocolate Watch Band); \\"How Many More Times\\" initial riff is the same of \\"Smockestack Lightning\\" by The Yardbirds and it has \\"inspired\\" by \\"How Many More Years\\" (Howlin' Wolf), \\"The Hunter\\" (Albert King) and \\"How Many More Times\\" (Gary Farr & The T-Bones). Beck has no necessity to do this.
B00005QDW5|4.0|Almost every good song by the band is in here such as... <br /> <br />Astronomy Domine-5/5-Great song from the early Pink Floyd. <br /> <br />See Emily Play-4/5-Another Gem from the early Pink Floyd, not as good as Astronomy Domine. <br /> <br />Happiest Days Of Our Lives/Another Brick In The Wall Pt.2-5/5-Who hasnt heard the song? <br /> <br />Echoes-4.5/5-Damn,the orginal was over 23 minutes long but it was butcherd 7 1/2 minutes long.Still is a classic. <br /> <br />Hey You-5/5-Classic,good guitar solo too. <br /> <br />Maroned-3.5/5-shortened but good place in the album. <br /> <br />The Great Gig In The Sky-5/5-Great song <br /> <br />Set The Controls For The Heart Of The Song-4/5-A gem that shows the song sang by Roger Waters. <br /> <br />Money-5/5-What can I say? <br /> <br />Keep Talking-2.5/5-not a very good song. <br /> <br />Sheep-5/5-Only Animals track in the Album. <br /> <br />Sorrow-3.5-Not that great But good finisher for first disc. <br /> <br />Shine On You Crazy Diamond Pt.1-7-5/5-Mix of the 2 orignal songs,still great. <br /> <br />Time-5/5-Classic,great Solo too. <br /> <br />The Flecther Memorial Home-3/5-Very Weird,but OK. <br /> <br />Comfortably Numb-5/5-Classic and has one of the greatest guitar solos of all time. <br /> <br />When The Tigers Broke Free-4.5/5-Great Lyrical Performance. <br /> <br />One Of These Days-5/5-Best Pink Floyd instrumental ever. <br /> <br />Us And Them-5/5-Another classic. <br /> <br />Learning To Fly-3.5/5-Ok but sounds WAY too 80's. <br /> <br />Arnold Layne-4/5-Good early Pink Floyd song. <br /> <br />Wish You Were Here-5/5-Last Classic song in the complation. <br /> <br />Jugband Blues-4/5-Weird,but good for Syd Barrets last song. <br /> <br />High Hopes-4/5-Good Post-Pink Floyd Song. <br /> <br />Bike-4.5/5-VERY Weird gem from early Pink Floyd Years.Good Closer.
B0001Z53AQ|4.0|i like this album a lot. if u like em, you'll prolly like d-12. i mean, em did grow up with them. they help em develop as a rapper when he was growing up. but anyways, this album is tight. i liked devil's night and this 1 is better. the beats and songs are harder. in my eyes, this was must buy if you are an em fan.
006441034X|5.0|This was a really good book, and I think its obvious why such a talent as Miyazaki would be attracted to it. It did remind me of his films, especially with its subtlety. Ok, it's not deep reading for adults, but the characters really stick with you. I am in graduate school right now, and I can honestly say this is probably the most fun I've had reading in months.
B00005Q4CS|4.0|Other films explore drugs but this one goes further. The plot is pretty simple. Right at the start the characters are set up for respective gruesome, nightmarish cataclismic fall outs from drug addiction. The last twenty minutes in particular present a spiraling, multi-angled view of a sort of drugs hell- the veins, the needles, the pulsating arteries the physical transformations - beauty becomes gnarled, warped and frail. It makes for compulsive viewing.<br /><br />This is a movie dealing with extremes. Extreme loneliness, extreme desperation, extreme desire for acceptance, extreme addiction and extreme imagery. This is what makes it a cult tour de force along the lines of Trainspotting and Clockwork Orange (although I wouldn't quite elevate it to that league as the characters in this movie are not developed as fully as they could be). If such movies offend you, for christ sakes don't put yourself through the self inflicted torture of watching it. Remember the Director's Cut is even more gut wrenching than the original.
B0006284JQ|3.0|Britney was a pop icon for the late 90's, with the fad of bubble gum pop at its highest, boy bands battling it out for the top spot, no one saw the \\"no so innocent\\" girl from left field. Possing as the good girl next door Spears swiped tight beats with provacative lyrics, trying to be the next big thing. In retrospective this collection highlites some of the strongest hits of her carrer including 3 semi ammusing songs. <br />    The first new single off the Cd MY proagative is a cover from the 80's. Britney uses her by the numbers formula to give it the Spears sound. <br />     The final 2 new songs, are also basic Spears by the numbers efforts, both upbeat perky numbers, and the remixs on the bonus disc, are truly for devoted fans only. <br />     This would be the perfect album for anyone who is interested in getting a feel for Spears, and for the devoted Fan. As for anyone who may already have previous Cd's of hers, and are not interested in the current single, stick with what you have. <br />      Stand out tracks: Sometimes, Not A Girl/Not yet A Women, Toxic <br /> <br /> <br />
B00068IOWM|4.0|I've just listened to the album off the official U2 website and I am impressed.  All the songs were very well written and it is one of U2's best cd's ever.  All the songs could be brought back to somewhere near the 80's era.  Bono sang very well, Edge's guitar riffs were impressive, Larry and Adam were the backbone and did their jobs very well.  This is a must buy for U2 fans and non U2 fans will enjoy the hard rock of the album.
B00068IOWM|5.0|I can definitely understand the sentiments of other reviewers. I was hoping that every track on this album would be like Vertigo and be able to make me drive 80 mph in a 30 zone. Instead, I was greeted with a different kind of U2. A side of U2 I have only glimpsed occasionally but always wished would visit some more. I was kinda surprised to hear that the tunes are a little more somber and moving. From the delicate blend of harmonies in \\"City of Blinding Lights\\" to a truly inspirational melody line in \\"Original of the Species\\", my biggest problem is going to be figuring out which songs get 5 stars in my iTunes. Oh and, I'm probably going to have to not listen to this CD in the car unless I want mad speeding tickets-for a few tracks at least.
B0002TT0NM|5.0|This movie is wonderful.  This is also my favorite thus far of the books.  This chapter is much darker than the previous two, simply because the book gets darker, and continues to darken as the tales go on.  The first two films were more geared toward children while still keeping the novel's plot.  This movie is more real,...that is to say, it is so close to capturing the feelings and events in the book that it almost IS the book.  Instead of cutting out and lightening scary or sad moments that are in the book, the director keeps it real.  Harry Potter isn't just for kids anymore. :)
B000268QB2|5.0|Being an 80's rocker, I normally do not go for this type of music.  Now, I am addicted to Keane!  A wonderful, British Pop band, selling out at local venues here in San Francisco, you will enjoy their positive, and uplifting music.  The lead singer sounds a bit like Freddie Mercury, although the music does not sound like Queen.  Mostly piano-based, this band will grow on you, I guarantee!  We saw them live at Bimbo's 365 Club in San Francisco in September and it was a sell-out!  They continued their tour back to England, only to schedule yet another date in S.F. on Dec. 3rd!  We've got tickets!  Get the album.  You won't regret it.
B00005Y228|5.0|Just like the majority of the U.S. public I became aware of Kylie with this cd.  This is an excellent cd and I'll tell you why.  With Fever, Kylie heads to the dance floor without pretensions.  \\"More, More, More\\", the album's opening track, hears her oozing sensuous vocals over funky bass and disco beats, setting the upbeat tone of the album.  Retro-disco and electronica collide to create music for a world that doesn't care about categories or styles, but just wants to have fun and dance. If all you're looking for is a collection of sexy dance cuts, with hardly a slow tune in sight, Kylie's Fever delivers <br />Dance fans.  Also, check out her album \\"Bodylanguage\\" and sister Dannii Minogue's \\"Neon Nights\\" for some electro, 80's funky beats. <br />
B0000020C4|5.0|One of the best features of this recording is that, truly, this has The Dream Cast.  And this holds especially true for excellent performer Lea Salonga, who shows that Eponine can be played without having to squeak and whine one's way through her numbers.  Among the many actors I've seen doing this role, she's the only one who captures the RANGE of emotions a REAL person in Eponine's shoes would feel.  Frances Ruffelle in the OLC and OBC albums is able to get some emotion across, but her characterization leans more toward the one-dimensional, caricature-like acting method (and is imitated by succeeding West End and Broadway actors who don't know any better).  Worse, Frances' performance is plagued by serious speech problems, inappropriate singing improvisations (the only good part in her \\"On My Own\\" number is the first line -- she drags the rest of the song), and a poor-quality singing voice.  This is NOT a play, this is not the book -- this is a MUSICAL, and no matter who the character is, the actor playing the role is subject to stringent SINGING standards because the actor's singing ability is pivotal not only to her character, but to the narration of the story (Musical Theater 101, duh!) Unfortunately, in both acting and singing, Frances and the many actors I've seen in this role, while tolerable, can't hold a candle to Salonga's heartfelt and solid interpretation.      It's strange how far people go to make excuses for, as many have noted, Frances' lackluster performance...
B00005JN2Z|4.0|it's a very well made, coulda been a satisfying excellent one if the filmaker would've taken more risk....some cliche plot in the middle and hollywood ending..
B00006BTCA|4.0|I thought it was an okay cd, but it was not really a good one.  I dont like New or NYC, but some other songs are pretty good, but its not like theres anything here to lose sleep over.
B00005YW4H|5.0|This is an excellent album well tempered and full through and through. After several plays I still feel compelled to kick back and take another stroll through the meanderings of her piano and wonderful voice. Check out first sessions. Can't wait to see jones live. <br /> <br />
B0001ZMWQO|5.0|So cool i just listened to it like 4 times before school.  A hundred times during school, and all day, after school yesterday.  Just keeps playing and this cd never gets old.  Non stop fun.  Cant wait to order my own copy since this is my friends, or so he thinks.
0670033693|5.0|I was lucky enough to get an advance copy of The cold Dish. This novel is so alive and real you can feel it. You will want to leave for Wyoming to find the charactors and the county(Absaroka). You'll laugh, cry, cringe, fall in love, and laugh again. Mr. Johnson will change the way you look at law enforcment,love, murder, friendship and vengence! You will never guess the ending. YOU WILL WISH FOR MORE! Mr.Johnson will trap you in his world...One you will never want to leave. The best book I have read for many years. When it comes out, GO GET IT!
B00005GL0R|5.0|the beatles were all about originality when it came to their music,thats what makes this the best album ever made by the best group that ever lived. if they were to make a greatest hits album it would probably include every song they ever recorded, or you could just buy every album.
B000268QB2|3.0|I heard the single \\"Everbody's changing\\" and loved it.  However, I guess I expected too much of the rest of the album.  It is strange.  The music is great.  The lead singer has a beautiful voice, but the way that he uses it is terrible.  I find myself waiting for a note at the end of a verse that never comes.  The lyrics are just as bad.  They are weak and not insightful.  And sometimes the words just don't fit the tone of the song or the music.  If I were you I would just record the single and save your time and money.  Maybe this is just their immature freshman album, because it does seem like they have the potential to be good.  I would just get a new lyricist.
B0000VCZK2|5.0|This is the best package of movies ever! I didn't become an \\"alien\\"  <br />fan until just a while ago. The first movie (\\"alien\\") is the 3rd best movie in the quarilogy. \\"Aliens\\" is the best , \\"alien 3\\" is the 2nd best and \\"alien resurrection\\" is by far the worst but still  <br />OK. The quadrilogy is a great package containing 9 disks (all four movies all four extra features disks and the bonus disk\\". All of the movies in the quadrilogy are great and it is a must buy.
0375758992|5.0|It takes awhile to grasp Alexandra's unique dialectal tone and hang on to the unpredictable roller coaster flow of this beautiful little memoir. Once you do, one has to wonder of this woman is a genius; as she disperses crystal clear recollections and -hard to get at first- wry anecdotes of a childhood in an impovershed African homestead riddled with mud, numerous malaria outbreaks, multiple infant fatalties, alcoholism, shrieking madwomen, acrimonius relations with the neighboring villagers, and above all, survival. All set against a backdrop of blistering terra firma and wild animals abound. Not only was she born to tell one of the greatest stories of all time, it seems plausible that Ms. Fuller had been born with a silver pen in her mouth.  <br />Warning: this book is not for those who are of the faint of heart or weak stomached. <br /> <br />
B0000931QR|2.0|Este nuevo CD de LODVG es casi igual a sus otros CDs. La verdad, pienso que muchas de sus canciones se parecen y que algunas otras no tienen sentido. Este CD esta demasiado largo, te aburre depues de las primeras 5 canciones. Nada mas hay dos canciones que valen la pena, Rosas y 20 de enero. El CD, y me duele decirlo, es poco menos que mediocre. Pero como grupo, LODVG tiene varias canciones muy buenas, y me parecen muy creativos. Este CD no es de sus mejores cosas. Recomiendo cualquiera de los dos anteriores para los que no quieran malgastar su dinero.
B0002BO0AS|4.0|Quite impressive CD, definitly rocks from start to finish. Nice guitar work, good perccussion. Overall a good metal release. My only negative feedback is the lack of depth to the album. I usually only make it through about half the songs, then I gotta throw something else in. Worth the purchase though.
0553213105|1.0|Most people will probably hate me for writing this review about a classic, but I found Pride and Prejudice a terrible bore. Everyone knows what it's about, so I won't use up my time telling you. But the book is really sort of a nightmare that never ends. It is not romantic or charming in the least bit. The main character comes through as arrogant and at times even stupid. It is a completely forgetable book, and I have no clue as to why so many people find it romantic. The writing is good, it has it's moments, but it in no way makes up for this book's lack of everything else. Wuthering Heights and Little Women, other classics that are just about in the same genre, are by far superior. I was so disappointed I have not read another book by Austen, and I'm not planning on it.
B0002Z9HT8|5.0|My set arrived yesterday and it's fabulous. Flaws aplenty, as others have noted, but so what. I haven't felt this good since mid-day November 2 when the exit polls said Kerry was going to win.  So many priceless performances, live, from so many legendary performers...and not a lip-syncher in sight. Worth every penny.
B00000JZI9|5.0|It goes without saying that this movie was well written, well directed, and well acted. And the cast: Scott Glenn, Kevin Kline, Danny Glover, Kevin Costner, Brian Dennehey, Jeff Goldblum, Rosanna Arquette, Linda Hunt and Jeff Fahey is one of the best ever assembled for a western. What makes it extra special is the tenderness between the characters played by Linda Hunt and Brian Dennehey. I can't think of another western with a relationship like that. A must have for anyone's collection.
B00009MGQL|5.0|Short and sweet, and as eloquent as possible.... three words sum up Jeff Beck's circumnavigational career \\"Beck Never Disappoints\\"!  On the whole, 5 stars is not enough. Nuff said!!
B00003CXIP|5.0|In this movie i think the four children show how loyal they are to eachother, and how being best friends means to live and die for eachother. I also saw alot of bravery between the two main characters. They had several ups and downs that they then overcame, from arguing with eachother to being bullied. If you are a kid, or adult i recommend you watch the movie because it could make your friendship stronger in the real world, and it also shows how bad families can cause trauma to a child who is nothing but a good kid if they only took a chance to understand how their child felt then maybe they wouldnt be so misarable with themselves, as some of the families were in the movie.
B000002AH9|5.0|I'm at work listening to my mp3 player.  I have a number of Ms. Holiday's CDs on it.  I decided to listen to all of them.  The selection is scrambled so I don't know when a track from \\"Lady in Satin\\" will play.  After hearing her voice for a few seconds, I can tell immediately that I am listening to \\"Lady in Satin\\".  Like many of the other reviewers, I have to agree that much of this work's appeal lays in that inimitable voice.   <br /> <br />I am overwhelmed by the emotion pouring out of these recordings.  All of these songs reflect the agony of her life.  That being said, I am also deeply moved by the talent, brilliance & musical genius of the artist. <br /> <br />I only regret that I can only give it 5 stars!!!
B00028HBKM|5.0|Mel Gibson, the man behind those lame \\"Lethal Weapon\\" sagas has created one of the best films ever made.  A film that will be his legacy, for I believe it will long be remembered after he is gone.  At first I was put off by this film.  I absolutely hate subtitles, but honestly spoken english would have destroyed the integrity of this film. <br /> <br />It is beautifully filmed.  Lavish in splendor, harsh in brutality, but honest in its intentions.  Gibson is a master director.  He created a wide range of emotions for his audience to experience.  The performances are top notch.  I have never seen acting so real, so emotional.  If anyone can see this movie and not be touched, they are heartless.  When I saw it in the theater and showed this film at my house with some friends, there was not a dry eye in the house.  This is a masterpiece!
B000056HE9|5.0|The Preacher's Wife was a remake of this. In the Preacher's Wife, I kept rooting for the preacher to dump the controlling diva and go have some fun. The plot is pretty much the same, but it soooo missed the spirit of the original. In this one, you clearly want the couple to get back together, you can empathisize with all three characters, and you can see that it's really just a case of good intentions leading to overwork leading to marital problems.  It's an incredibly sweet, nice movie that all ages can enjoy.  And I'll take Cary Grant as my Guardian Angel, no questions asked!
B000022TSW|5.0|It took several attempts and cuts to get this film down to a 'R' rating.  I would truly love to see the original film, farts and all!  I'm sure we missed a lot of jokes, probably sick and twisted jokes, but funny I could only imagine. <br /> <br />What we have is a wonderfully wicked, sick, twisted and sidesplittingly funny satire on America, family values, paranoia, stereotypes, homophobia, and of course censorship.  Features an Oscar nominated (Yes, a real Oscar Nomination!) song \\"Blame Canada\\" a hysterical send-up of American values.   <br /> <br />All the characters are back.  Kenny, Kyle, Stan, Cartman, Big Gay Al, and yes, even Satan himself.  Funny, funny, funny.  This is not a cartoon for children.  Even if you never have seen the TV show, the movie stands on its own, and is enjoyable even to first timers.  The humor, often black at times, is very biting.  It is not for everyone.  Viewers discretion is advised...
B000002J23|4.0|I love this record. When the record first starts you know it is going to be awesome as Steve Howe rips into some of his heaviest and most aggressive guitar playing. Why didn't he ever do anything like this before (or after). Rick Wakeman may have been more dazzling on the keys but Geoff Downes conjours up more beautiful and haunting melodies than Rick Wakeman ever could with far less notes. In fact, there is not one bad song on this record. Every song offers something new and exciting to Yes fans, proving that a progressive band could continue to grow even when their era had died away. From the haunting \\"Man in a white car\\" to the beautiful \\"Run to the Light\\" this album grips you and constantly suprises you. If there is any down side it is that you will miss Jon Anderson. But the fact that he is not on this record doesn't cripple it like you would think. Owing to this fact the rest of the band, who are good background vocalists in themselves, come together to add a lot more vocal texture. If you don't have this record and your scarred to try it, I hope this review gives you a chance to cast off your ambitions and buy yourself a cd that will make you kick yourself for not picking it up sooner.
6305696071|3.0|I never understood why this film was so treasured when it first came out.  Until recently I didn't even own this DVD, but feel it does represent the love stories of the 90s quite well.  This is nothing more than an adult version of Cinderella.  It sweetens the lifestyles of hookers, making it look like a fun job until that perfect man comes and rescues her and sweeps her off her feet.  Yuck!  Pooey!  The saving grace of this film is that it is very well acted.  Julia Roberts was destined to be a star.  Any other chick in this role it would have been long buried.  She made the sugary crap believable.  Richard Gere made a career comeback (how many can one man have?) and is perfect as the prince charming in waiting.
B000001ELL|2.0|In 1979 Kiss released the album Dynasty. With the release of the album Dynasty Kiss tried an idea that they had previously explored with Double Platinum when they remade Strutter.They flirted with Disco on the tune I Was Made for Lovin You, which was actually a pretty good song,and became the big hit off the album.The other hit from Dynasty was Sure Know Something it wasn't as popular as I Was Made for Lovin You,but still one of the highlights from Dynasty.Another high point of the album is 2,000 Man.Other than these three songs Dynasty is rather weak when compared to Kiss's earlier albums.The band still plays good, but the filler,which sounds good just is not very entertaining even clocking around 40 minutes Dynasty does lose steam in the middle of the album.Listenable but not really that good as a whole,I recommend Dynasty for diehards only and some of them may be disappointed.
0142000663|5.0|Steinbeck made a living description of the live of Joad. I like some characters he created such as Tom Joad, Ma, and Casy(the preacher). I love some coversation concerning religion like Casy's self-confession. Also, when uncle John asked Casy if he was sinful or not, Casy said that a man had no right to tell another man what should do and what should not do. He also mentioned that one should not tell his sin to others so that he himself could feel better. Since I myself was in similar situation, I know better what I should do now.<br /><br />Now when I saw beggers and immigrants in my city, I start wondering if they led a similar life as the Joad did. I start sympathizing them. While before, I didn't like them, thinking them rude and civilisation-distroying people. Now I think everyone is equal to have a right to live better.
B0002UXBD6|5.0|When you get this CD (and if you don't already have it, order it NOW!) listen to it.  Then listen to it again.  Then do it again.  The amazing thing is that after 10, 20, or more spins, it only sound better and better.  Maybe you'll hear a nuance you didn't hear the first, second, or 20th time.  As others have written, there's not a bad cut - the only hard part is deciding which song (or movement - this really is a complete concept album) is best.  It just plain ol' doesn't get boring or tiresome - not in the least.  Of course, that is assuming that you don't set your CD player to play track 1 - the title track, \\"American Idiot\\" - over and over, since it has the best rock hook since I don't know when.   <br /> <br />When Grammy time rolls around this album BETTER be nominated and in an ideal world there's a good chance it would win because I couldn't imagine a better set of songs coming out this year - or any year!
B00013VHI0|5.0|Anathema is one of the bands, which creates himselffrom album to album. After my opinion this album is their climax. They deserve to be in a position, which must be better than they are in. Feel and Fragile Dreams are songs to be memorized. Just go and buy this album. Otherwise you will miss a lot.
0792164903|5.0|This classic Halloween tale has been taken to new scare tactics by the fantastic imagination of director Tim Burton....don't expect a cute and comical kiddie film here! <br /> <br />In a little spooky town called Sleepy Hollow a haunting occurs and people are losing their heads over it, literally! To the rescue arrives a less than nerdy Ichabod Crane (Johnny Depp) a forensic scientist with a bag filled with strange and revealing gadgets. Crane isn't the goofy, inept comedian from the original tale but some of the original characteristics remain in Depp like squeamishness and a bit of trembling fear. Sadly Crane lacks the efforts of his gangly foolish horse in this more serious version as well. But the Headless Horseman (Christopher Walken) is terrifying and his horse a bold and angry beast both pouncing through the screen with a vengeance. The heroine Katrina Van Tassel (Christina Ricci) is wise in her own regard having a few ancient tricks up her sleeve to aid Crane with his fight against the evil haunting in Sleepy Hollow. <br /> <br />Depp and Ricci are always great together and especially when paired with the amazing mind of Burton and the set creations he manages to conjure up in all of his pictures. Some of the be-heading scenes are rather gruesome especially in light of what our world has become since the making of this movie. The special effects are really astounding and the world of Sleepy Hollow (created in a film studio) is spookily enchanting just as a fairy tale should exist within. As with all of Burton's films between the darkness there exists a sense of comical wonder that creeps between the edges of fear. This is a great Halloween movie but I wouldn't watch it until the young ones are asleep because it is penetrating enough to cause a few nightmares worth waking up from.  <br />
0780622553|5.0|I just recently bought this DVD for this ridiculously low price.  I feel like I owe more money.  The story is one of the better sci-fi stories I have seen in a while.  I don't want to give anything away as far as the plot goes.  Let's just say the main character, played with brilliant bewilderment by Rufus Sewell, is stuck in a situation he has no knowledge of getting himself into.  Like Jason Bourne, our hero learns about his world at the same rate that we do, since he can't trust his own memories.  All the performances are great especially the underrated Kiefer Sutherland.  The extras are all informative.<br /><br />Now if the director would have taken the talent he shows here up a notch with I, Robot instead of going down a level.
B0000039PW|5.0|An excellent outing for Chris Wallace AKA 'Biggie'and his gangster Ivy league educated chums. This album would stand next to Talking Book and the birth of the cool were it not for the meddling 'P-Diddy' and his Catatonically dreary synth style beats on 'Big Poppa'. The album reveals Small's gangster fantasy world as he veers from Chris Walken King of New York style adventures to more realistic impressions of himself as a fat kid from Brooklyn who plays computer games. The Beats are thoughtful and well structured and in comparison to whatever there is now a days it makes you wonder how the general public is so easily fooled. Buy this on wax, slap it on ya turntables , West Coast-East Coast? we know who wins, but lets not let our maritime differences hold a grudge were all gangsters here....
B00005JMFQ|5.0|I never saw a trailer for Love Actually when it came out.  A friend of mine gave me the DVD thinking I would like it.  Looking at the cast, I figured it couldn't be bad.  I then watched it.  I called six friends after to tell them they have to watch this movie if they hadn't seen it.  It explores all kinds of love, from make believe to young love to shattered love to the loss of love.  And everything else in between.<br /><br />Richard Curtis does a great job with script and the handling of his actors.  The only fault I can find is that I liked these characters so much (even the ones that do stupid things) that you wish he wrote a screenplay for just each individual storyline.  It is rare that I find myself wondering about what happens to characters when they are not on screen.  I enjoyed these characters as real friends and I was interested in them so much I wanted to know more.<br /><br />The acting is top notch.  Hugh Grant is totally believable as the Prime Minister.  He brings a real person charm to a role that could have been dictated by the circumstances in which he is placed.  Emma Thompson and Alan Rickman, who act so often together, make there relationship so real it is palpable.  Thompson and Grant have a charming little scene in which she defines the real definition of a desperate housewife.  Keira Knightly is absolutely lights up the screen.  She is also an actor who knows how not to give too much away.  She has a perfect scene in which someone who she thinks hates her really does in fact love her.  She doesn't overplay it all and actually waits longer than most actresses would have waited to show her emotions.  There is another seen in which she could have gave away the ending of her storyline, but she plays it in such a way that even Grant and Curtis disagree about what happens to her character after the movie is over.  Laura Linney and Colin Firth are there usually excellent selves.  However, the best acting in my opinion goes to Liam Neeson.  His story is the loss of the love of his life.  He doesn't make it weepy but sticks to smaller things like just endlessly staring at a picture of his wife.  Then, he finds that his step son is in love for the first time.  He doesn't treat his son has a child having a childhood crush but really believes that his stepson is indeed in love.  He has an honest relationship with his step-son, and it is their love that becomes the true love story of their relationship.His story is the loss of the love of his life.

B00008H2LB|4.0|A lot of people have asked me what I thought about Linkin Park's 2003 Sophmore Release 'Meteora' and the first thing I would tell them was that it was a nice follow up with some songs that can push them in a newer direction. Now, a lot of you Linkin Park 'haters' who think this album was terrible won't agree with what I am about to say, and that's fine. Linkin Park has a style that, whether you 'love em' or 'hate em', is catchy and it works. They succesfully have combined hip-hop, rock, and electronica to make something that most of us enjoy hearing and they ACTUALLY care about their fans, unlike most bands out there. Now, back to what I was saying before about a 'newer direction'. Meteora was a necessity in Linkin Park's career because they hadn't finished experimenting with their style to a point where they could go into a 'new direction'. Sure 'Meteora' had its moments where it seemed that it was trying to repeat some of the songs from 'Hyrbid Theory' like (Easier to Run=Crawling, and Somewhere I Belong=In the End), but there were other songs such as 'Faint' and 'Breaking the Habit' that helped push thier style to a new point. 'Breaking the Habit' especially is the key song that was the most diverse of all the songs from any of their albums, and because of it they plan to head the way 'Breaking the Habit'  helped push them for their next album. I am a Linkin Park fan, yes, but I'm not gonna lie; I like their music and I liked all their albums so far, but I really hope they bring something different forward for their third album, because that is where true artists make/break it. But Meteora is worth buying; it's short, sweet and to the point. No filler songs and a very nice expansion upon Hyrbid Theory. Even if you're skeptical about buying it because you have heard it was bad, buy it anyway because why base your decision off of someone elses OPINION. You won't know for sure until you have heard it yourself.
B000056N8X|4.0|This is the closest in idea and feel to the first movie than all the others.  It's not just action and adventure and sword fighting, it's also about the pain and toil that comes with all the good things you get when you're immortal. <br /> <br />To the critics that state the obvious - that this film ignores the events of the other Highlander films in large portion, well...there's a good reason for that.  Highlander 2 is widely accepted amongst the Highlander fan base as \\"the movie that never should've been done\\".  Consequently, everything that has come since that movie has largely pretended that the movie never existed. <br /> <br />This movie does focus as much on Duncan from the TV series as much as Connor, so at least some familiarity with the TV series is recommended, but I'm not sure how necessary it is. <br /> <br />Personally, I'm a bigger fan of the TV series than I am the movies.  The only movie in the series I liked as much as this one was the first. <br /> <br />Without giving too much away, this film provides a nice endpiece to both the movie series (thus far) and the TV series, but at the same time positions the franchise to be able to make future films or expand the property in other mediums. <br /> <br />If you're a fan of the TV series, you're sure to enjoy this movie.  If you're a fan of the original movie, I think you'll still enjoy it a good deal.  If you're one of the 5 fans of the second Highlander film, you're a silly person.
B00068IOWM|1.0|<br />By DARRYL STERDAN <br />Winnipeg Sun <br /> <br /> <br />There are, it seems, two kinds of U2 fans.  <br /> <br />On the one hand, there are those who prefer the band's earthy, earnest emotional arena-rock. On the other hand, there are those who favour their esoteric, ethereal experiments. Which is to say: No matter what kind of an album Bono and co. make, somebody always seems to end up bummed.  <br /> <br />To their credit, though, U2 are good enough to give each side a decade to call their own. The rockers got to lay claim to the '80s, when Bono lit The Unfogettable Fire and waved the white flag for Sunday Bloody Sunday.  <br /> <br />The avant guardians had their way for the '90s, when the boys played dressup and went from iconic to ironic with Achtung Baby and Pop. With the coming of 2000, the tide expectedly returned to the heartfelt simplicity and no-frills rock of All That You Can't Leave Behind.  <br /> <br />And if you think U2 are going to leave all that behind one album later, you haven't been paying attention.  <br /> <br />If their last album was the sound of a band rediscovering their roots and reconnecting with their past, How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb, their 11th studio release, is the sound of a band hitting their stride and heading into their comfort zone.  <br /> <br />For the 11 songs on this 39-minute disc, the band stuck to the game plan that worked so well four years ago: Never mind all the bells and whistles; just crank it up, belt out the chorus and get on with it. The Edge's chiming arpeggios and scritchy licks; the rhythm section's solidly unfussy grooves; Bono's soaring vocals and philosophical odes to love and hope and birth and death and war and peace -- it's all straight out of the U2 101 textbook. Just dust off the white flag, assemble the heart-shaped stage and Bono's ready for the stadium tour.  <br /> <br />But of course, that's also the biggest problem with How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb. It's U2 by the numbers -- safe,familiar, predictable and, ultimately, somewhat uninspired and uninspiring. Naturally, there are standout tracks -- the clanging opening rocker Vertigo, the murky neo-blues of Love and Peace or Else, the fuzzy blast of All Because of You, the midtempo swirl of Sometimes You Can't Make it on Your Own (which Bono sang at his father's funeral) and the low-wattage One Step Closer (also inspired by his dad's death).  <br /> <br />But even these cuts don't have quite the same spark, the same punch, the same sense of wide-eyed exhilaration and rejuvenation as, say, Elevation, Stuck in a Moment You Can't Get Out Of, Beautiful Day and Walk On. The fact that a few of the titles are so similar-sounding doesn't help dispel that feeling of musical deja vu.  <br /> <br />Don't misunderstand. It's not that How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb isn't a good album. It is. At times, it's very good. But it's simply not a great U2 album. No matter what kind of a fan you are.  <br /> <br />[...]  <br /> <br />
B0001LJC2K|5.0|If you have heard either of the Muse singles \\"Time... or Hysteria\\" and have formed your entire opinions based upon those two songs, you are selling the band short. This album is mesmerizing from track one till track fourteen. A brilliant cultivating mix of strings, piano, and all out heavy licks makes the best album I have heard in years. You must buy!!! I went out today and bought thier previous albums to get more!
B000002J03|5.0|What else can be said about Led Zeppelin that hasn't already been repeated time and again?  Arguably the greatest band of all time, the combination of John Bonham's/John Paul Jones' driving rhythms, Robert Plant's wailing vocals and Jimmy Page's mastery of the guitar makes Zeppelin the greatest heavy metal band to ever take the stage, and Led Zeppelin II sets the bar for all heavy metal albums that ever came after; almost an unreachable standard.<BR>    The music of Led Zeppelin helped to define a generation, and their over-the-top stage presence was absolutely electric.  It is always a challenge bringing that type of live energy to the studio, but few accomplished this like Zeppelin.  Though it might not be accurate to say that Led Zeppelin II defined the music of the band, as it was constantly changing and evolving, it did reflect the band at their heavy metal purest; before the band began their flirtation with a more medieval sound (a la Stairway to Heaven/Battle of Evermore).  Led Zeppelin II represents the band at its hardest and most raw.<BR>    The question of the originality and influence of Led Zeppellin as reflected in II is always a heated debate between the belivers and the non-convinced, but in my humble opinion, there is a reason that Zeppelin has earned its reputation.  Any fool who even compares a band like Queen or Deep Purple to Zeppelin needs to up the dosage on their medication.  These bands, though great, (and favourites of mine), cannot hold a candle to the sheer brilliance of Zeppelin.  And with regard to the 'questionable influence' of Zeppelin, one needs to realize that Zeppelin essentially invented the genre which they made famous; they were the original and remain the standard.  The Rolling Stones and Beatles invented rock and roll, yet Mick Jagger has never denied the influence of men like Chuck Berry on his music.  The suggestion that Zeppelin is unoriginal is insulting not only to the band but to anyone who knows anything about the nature of music.  I doubt very much that any living member of Zeppelin would claim to never have been influenced by another band.  The music of Led Zeppelin II is reflective of Zeppelin's unique and original take on the powerful blues riffs that they took to new heights in popularizing heavy metal.  This sound has never been improved upon.  Though I myself am only 17, and was never lucky enough to see Zeppelin firsthand, I do know for sure that not find the pinnacle of heavy metal music, one must invariably seek out Led Zeppelin, and above all others, Led Zeppelin II.<BR>    To all the people who do not believe Led Zeppelin lives up to the hype, this record should be more than enough to refute any argument that may be devised.  The vocals of Plant are incomparable, and the titanic riffs and solos of Page are unparralleled, on any album, in any era.  My favourite Led Zeppelin's album; it is essential to any music fan.
B000002HAJ|5.0|Wish is not as solid as Disintegration but it is very close!  In fact, whereas the brilliant Disintegration is mostly on an even keel in terms of its slow, dark sound, Wish offers more variety.  It starts with the powerful rocker \\"Open\\" (which sports excellent lyrics about being trapped in a world of excessive social drinking and drugs) then moves to the happy sound of \\"High\\" (\\"when I see you kitten as a cat\\"), and then presents one of the most beautiful, slow songs I've ever heard \\"Apart.\\"  The album continues this variety with another rocker \\"From the Edge of the Deep Green Sea,\\" the quirky \\"Wendy Time,\\" and, later, another beautiful slow song \\"Trust.\\"  \\"Cut\\" is another powerful track.  \\"End\\" is another one of my favorites with addictive guitar riffs.  The only track I do not care for is the single \\"Friday I'm in Love\\" which I find a bit too cutesy.  \\"Doing the Unstuck\\" starts out in the same vein with  the \\"let's get happy\\" lines but then launches into some awesome guitar riffs. If it were not for the opening, it would be one of my favorite tracks off Wish.  \\"A Letter to Elise\\" was another single off Wish which I like better than \\"Friday.\\"  If you like the singles, I highly recommend checking out this album as there are much better tracks on it and it offers a whole range of emotions.
B00000K19E|5.0|The producer, writer or directors may not be fully aware of what they have done but they have created a ground breaking film of biblical significance. The film has many comparisons to the New Testament with Neo, Morpheus and Cypher playing the parts of Jesus, John the Baptist and Judas respectively.<br /><br />However even more interestingly is that we can now experience the Matrix for ourselves. Recently a new spiritual force has been spreading throughout the world opening up the possibility of experiencing this insight.<br /><br />The biggest difference to the film is that outside our Matrix lies paradise rather than the dark world portrayed in the film. In fact we are all in a perpetual living hell, it is up to each individual to learn how to escape it.<br /><br />So the question is \\"Do you want to take the red pill or the blue pill?\\".<br /><br />If you want to see something that will really bake your noodle then go to enlightenment.atspace.com.  Before I was blind and now I can see.<br /><br />Unfortunately no one can be told what the Matrix is, you have to see it for yourself.  Good luck and God bless.
B00005RHGK|3.0|Two charming siblings, Trish and Darry (Gina Philips and Juston Long) are returning home from college and driving down one of those long, lonesome, country roads (the ones that are so commonplace in horror films). They witness a man throwing bodies down a drainage pipe at the back of an old church and in an act of absolute stupidity, Darry (the dumber of the two), decides to investigate. He soon discover hundreds of perfectly preserved *dead* bodies all stitched up and artistically spread out throughout a dusty, dark cellar. His nosiness fuels the wrath of the killer who isn't a man at all but some sort of monstrous, murderous demon who has risen from the depths of the earth to feed on human flesh.<br /><br />I must frankly state that it was very difficult for me to feel sorry for the two main characters. Although they were both youthful, attractive and somewhat likable, it was their foolishness that got them in trouble in the first place. I am no expert in profiling but the film still begs me to ask the question: What part of the man's appearance/demeanor had they not mistaken for a vicious killer? He was only about 10 feet tall, was wearing a freakish, dusty, moth worn hat, a Jack The Ripper-ish over coat and was clearly dumping bodies (most likely dead bodies) into a drainage pipe. And let's not forget his mode of transportation and really bad driving skills.<br /><br />With that said, at the time of its release in 2001, \\"Jeepers Creepers\\", directed by the controversial and notorious Victor Salva, was one of the more original horror films. It has good performances by its young cast, some built up tension and a very mysterious killer. Although the film follows the typical slasher movie formula, it rises above most due to its enigmatic and supernatural storyline. The origins of the killer is never really explained and its face is not clearly shown until the final frames adding a sense of mystery and intrigue. When the monster is finally revealed, up close and personal, it is quite the beauty, possessing a face that any reader of \\"Fangoria\\" would love to pin up on their bedroom wall. Also add in to the mix some peculiar characters - the psychic and mysterious cat lady come to mind, some scenes of gore (not over-done), slaughter, and a surprise ending and you have an enjoyable, eerie tale of human idiocy, bloodshed and tears. Oh and who can forget that song?<br /><br />\\"Jeepers Creepers... where'd you get those eyes?\\"<br /><br />There are worst ways to spend 90 minutes of your life.<br /><br />*** ½the beauty, possessing a face that any reader of \\"Fangoria\\" would love to pin up on their bedroom wall.

B0002F6BRE|5.0|Not being a real fan of Saturday Night Live since the days of John Belushi and Bill Murray, my only exposure to Will Farrell came with the movie Old School. And while Farrell was the best part of the film, it wasn't like I would rush right out and see a movie with him as the star...So I missed Elf last year and finally saw it on DVD last night. This is a great holiday movie, and Will Farrell is hilarious. The story of Buddy adjusting to human life after being raised at the North Pole is enchanting, and Farrell's wide-eyed innocence gives you a chuckle as he wanders the streets of New York dressed in his elf attire. This really is a great family movie, kids will love to see Santa and the North Pole, and Buddy's antics will have them laughing as well. But this is not a \\"Kids\\" movie in the way that \\"Santa Clause\\" is. The jokes also target an older demographic that will have adults laughing too. This is the perfect time of the year to watch Elf, the holidays are right around the corner, and you can't help but catch a little of the Christmas Spirit after watching Elf. Also, any movie that features Bob Newhart's dry humor is worth your viewing. Newhart's Poppa Elf character just had me chuckling whenever he appeared on screen, not since Jack Benny has a comedian been able to express so much by doing so little. Great cast, great writing, great holiday sentiment....you can't ask for more than that.
B00063EMJG|4.0|This is the first compilation of his hits since Decade in 1977. As it is though, there isn't a huge difference between Decade and Greatest Hits, in that all but two songs on the new album are from the 70's. Certainly his hay day though. Still, this is Neil Young stuff, and all are great songs. The DVD feature is pretty simple, with cheesy early 90's era videos of Harvest Moon and Rockin' In the Free World, info on each song's original album, a picture from the time, and the lyrics.  <br />The opening tracks are the long beautiful Down By The River and Cowgirl in the Sand, then Cinammon Girl, all from Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere-a greatest hits album unto itself. This is a great album, all terrific, special tunes by a giant. <br />An interesting note: On the back is a sentence regarding how the songs were picked, saying that based on chart numbers, sales, radio play and downloading amounts these songs were deemed the \\"greatest.\\" Interesting that nothing from On the Beach or Tonight's the Night, two awesome albums released back to back in 74-75, is on here. In that way this album could have more. <br />
B00005R8FI|5.0|Blues, Jazz, Rock and Folk all rolled into one.  This recording is as innovative today as it was then.  Unplugged before unplugged was trendy.  The musicianship is masterful.  There has never been quite another recording like it.  Highlights are \\"Room to Move\\" (an FM radio classic in the early 70's) and \\"Laws Must Change\\" and having some extra tracks is a welcomed plus.  This is a must in every old hippie's music collection. Enjoy!
B0001NBMBC|2.0|Only for the song pulse of the maggots does this album get 2.5 stars that song alone brings this album up.  I like metal along with other genres of music.  Variety is the spice of life but these guys only pull it together for 3 or 4 songs on each album.  If I took all 3 of their albums and could pick and choose songs I could put together a decent album but alot of tracks are filler or just don't really vibe for me.  MUDVAYNE,is a much better overall band with alot more talent within the nu-metal genre.
B000003TAB|3.0|I quite liked this, especially the first seven or so songs, very catchy. As for the guy commenting on Appetite ofr Destruction, well, let's just just say I'm not into homophobic, sexist, no brainer singers like Axl Rose. Yeah, he was a good front man but  <br />it stops right there. Kurt Cobain had integrity and a writing craft to rival many...
B000002KYR|5.0|This was actually one of the first albums I heard as a kid.. <br />And enough though it is a step below some of the 70's stuff <br />it is a great effort. The thing is that it has ALOT of depth <br />and to me holds back on the fillers. The thing is that even <br />though it is really commerical, it STILL doesn't take away <br />from the talents that this band has had for 30 years! It is <br />ashame though that they spent the next couple of years trying <br />to make a part 2 of this album and it kind of led to a slide <br />in the great career they have had. <br /> <br />Standout songs: <br /> <br />-Gimme All Your Lovin' <br />-Sharp Dressed Man <br />-Legs <br />-T.V Dinners <br />-Got Me Under Pressure
B0002Z9HT8|4.0|I was vacationing in Europe during the Live Aid concert and was only able to catch parts of it on radio.  I was really glad to hear about the release of these DVDs as they contain most of the concert footage from the Live Aid concert. I was a little disappointed that some performances were missing, but after reading the liner notes, I understand the reasons why.  But, I am truly grateful for the footage that is available.  Sting and Branford Marsalis' performance is alone worth the $20 I paid at Target.  With all the other great performances (everyone remembers the incredible Queen set), this set is truly a bargain! <br /> <br />The video and sound quality are surprisingly good.  Some of the performances were not very good technically, but they were all passionate which is more important on such an occasion. I highly recommend it...it will bring back alot of memories.  I did not give it 5 stars because although it is an incredible collection, it is not perfect (because of some missing footage).   <br /> <br />Some reviewers referred to Geldof as an opportunist or megalomaniac, but I admire him for trying to help the victims of the famine.
B000002GBD|5.0|I don't really know if this band has ever really got it's <br />due for the great music it put out. Hair of The Dog in my <br />mind is one of the best songs in rock history! Granted, Love <br />Hurts is way overplayed.... But it's still good! There are <br />alot of other good rockers here! \\"Miss Misery\\" and \\"Whiskey <br />Drinkin Woman\\" are also really good songs. The truth is that <br />Hair Of The Dog is worth the price of the CD alone.
B000001FS3|5.0|U2's The Joshua Tree is at times, peaceful, moving, emotional, deep and rocking all at the same time.  Some of the social themes are still felt today in U2's later albums such as All That You Can't Leave Behind from 2000.  With or Without You, I Still Haven't Found, and Where The Streets Have No Name are still favorites.  But other songs like Mothers of the Disappeared and One Tree Hill are very well done too.  It is such a dynamic, creative and high point for the band and Bono and his band still perform songs from it in concerts.
B0001ZMWQO|4.0|It seems that after alot of lackluster time in the late 90's <br />and early 00's music is making a small return. While I can't <br />call these guys classic rock they have a really good sound. I <br />was actually surprised with the strange name and all. The <br />first song I heard was \\"Take me Out\\" and after that time <br />I was really hooked to these guys. But it isn't the only <br />good song on this album... You also have \\"Cheating on You\\" <br />which is a good but short sound. But I'd have to say Jacque <br />line is the most underrated on the album.  <br /> <br />For all the people that feel today's music has NOTHING like <br />to offer if you give this album a shot you might just feel <br />differently!
B00004S8X5|4.0|I still love Kylie's first album.  Although it got attention because of her remake of Little Eva's '60s hit, The Locomotion (people just LOVE those remakes, that \\"Oh My God, I remember that song!\\" reaction), the rest of the album is more exciting and fun.  I have played It's No Secret, Turn It Into Love, Look My Way (which sounds like the Whispers' Rock Steady), I Miss You, I Should Be So Lucky and others.  The one weak song of this album is Love At First Sight.  It sounds too kid-like for her.    As fun, catchy and addictive as it is, it is a Stock-Aitken-Waterman production.  Those three produced entire albums for Rick Astley, Bananarama, Donna Summer, and some songs for others. The music has a tendency to be repetitive, and some songs here from '88 are similar to the ones they did for Astley and Summer. Their clash of keyboard heavy melody, shades of late '70s disco and '80 dance in their sound made for a unique formula. One must ask how nonstop it was for them to make 40, 50 or 60 different songs for these artists in that successful period. But you wouldn't know it from dancing to all of it.  Kylie's first album was really the setup for more complex songs like her '90s albums and her most recent successful albums of Kylie and Body Language.
B00005JMH2|5.0|I found this movie just amazing i thought it was an excellent storyline about a man (richard Gere) was a loving husband to susan surandon who decided to try out a dance school with Jennifer Lopez who also was a dance teacher i just have to say it was a very warm and extremely touching movie all i can say is go see it it was fantastic and again when it comes out on dvd i will deffinately go buy it it was a tear jerker and such a warm movie <br /> <br /> <br />go see it!!!! <br />
B00000J7RZ|3.0|Jennifer Lopez made a good debut but her later releases are much better, especially the dance heavy second and the nice Rooney/ Trackmasters dominated third one.  I still love If You Had My Love, Waiting For Tonight, No Me Ames, the hyperactive Let's Get Loud, but the album sometimes suffers with too many ballads. The dance numbers are the ones I still play the most. Some of the ballads kind of drag for their five to six minutes and Lopez just doesn't bring any pizazz in them.  I noticed that it got mixed reviews in '99, but she was competing against people like Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera that year for the dance pop queen title.  When she did songs with Rodney Jerkins and a few others, they come out funky. But when she did songs with Dan Shea, Cory Rooney, Trackmasters and others, the results come off pedestrian and uneven. The Celine Dion-sounding ballad is just too slick for her. Lopez just couldn't make the translation from actress to singer very smoothly on some of her debut.  Her voice sounds a little thin and very close to Paula Abdul in some songs. Overall, a good start, but she just wasn't there yet.
B00005JNDX|5.0|i thought that this movie was hilarious i thought that the movie itself was a great story line.  I think everyone should go see this movie it was excellent
B00003CXCT|1.0|This so-called classic science-fiction trilogy is actually warmed-over and dumbed-down Joseph Campbell, with some assorted pilfering from old movies (The Searchers, The Hidden Fortress, and even Triumph of the Will.)  The guy is a genius - a genius at taking your money.  He'll keep adding crap and you'll keep buying the platitudes and cliches, and even better, passing them on to your kids.  In my experience I find that these films tend to appeal to individuals who are stuck at an early stage of emotional development.  Since unfortunately that includes a lot of people, this shrewdly ensures their success.    PS: Just kidding - like everyone else I love these movies!
B0002KVUKW|4.0|This type of film is not really my cup of tea, but my son bought it and I decided to watch it. I am still not sure whether the film is supposed to be a comedy or not but it had a tinge of Abott and Costello about it. It is a little bit of  modern day dragon slayer meets Mr. Hyde and Frankenstein's monster and Count Dracula and most other monster's you can think of.  Van Helsing is working for the church as their terminator of all things ghoulish. I found the film a hoot, but the special effects are absolutely terrific, as good as anything I've seen and the DVD is worth buying for these alone and of course Kate Beckinsale is easy on the eye too.
6304806434|1.0|Few movies can be considered dreadful enough to not have any redeeming charecteristics; this is one of them. Nothing could have saved this movie. I am writing this review in a state of rage, anger, embaressment (of having been seen watching the movie), and pain. So where exactly did this movie go wrong? It had a great cast, an all-star cast if you will. The movie had tons of money to spare, as could be seen by the liberal use of the special effects budget and the enormous sums paid out to the numerous big-name actors. Steve Buscemi was in it, and he is in many good movies. So what is wrong. <br />First of all, the acting was dreadful. I sensed that every actor was delivering the lines the same way that a hostage reads his ransom note. They seemed to be in constant pain and were probably kicking themselves for accepting such a poor script. The lines were delivered with a lack of coviction and sense of reality. <br />Now onto to reality; this movie is not reality. The Rock was more realistic than this. Wait...wait Star Wars was more realistic than this. Ok, no biggie. Action films are never supposed to coincide perfectly with realism. However this film goes so far from the laws of physics that it is unforgivable. For example, what happens when a motorcyle crashes into a fire truck? That's right: it explodes. Or what happens when a large transport plain crashes in Vegas? Yep, that's right: it skids for a few miles without going off of the road. Furthermore, nothing was ever explained. How was 'The Virus' able to hijack a fire engine and why didn't anybody stop Poe from getting onto the police bike?  <br />It's pathetic. Steve Buscemi was another problem. I saw the movie looking up for a short period of time when he appeared, then what happens? He has tea with a little girl and she 'reforms' him. I can't think of something more cliche than the child reformer. Oh yeah and children should never be allowed to sing in movies, or at all.  <br />The ending was so overblown and corny that it became completely unwatchable. I understand that I view this differently than most other folks here, but I couldn't bear to see Poe reunited with his family. I thought this was an action movie not the second coming of the Sugar Plum fairy.
B00068IOWM|5.0|Everyone who likes u2 knows that they are the best live band on the planet, that's where all these songs come to life.  Who cares about the album, the songs sound twice as good on stage.  I'll even go as far as to say that you can't give a valid point, good/bad, about the band until you see them in concert.  That's where their true magic lies.  But If I had to comment on the new album, its bloody brilliant.
1592400876|5.0|i mean, it's great.  see?  i learned sumthing.
B0006284JQ|1.0|I shall waste no words on this puppet. All I want to say is <br /> <br />It's a sad state of affairs when this person and the others from the same litter steal radio/TV time & sales that should go to infinitely more deserving {read: \\"re4al & outstanding\\"} artists like Rufus Wainwright.
B00042YBTK|4.0|The Repertoire label has just released a remastered version of this album and the sound quality is truly amazing, obviously taken from the first-generation master tape - makes the out-of-print versions by One Way and Polydor of Japan sound thin and weak in comparison.  A cursory glance through other reviews for these earlier releases show the potential buyer that this was an album you either loved or hated.  No question that there are some filler tracks here - my advice is to program out \\"I'm Dying, Or Am I?\\", \\"Gemini\\" & \\"The Madman\\".  What you're left with is one of the great unsung and underappreciated albums of the psychedelic era.  Andy Summers' solo on Traffic's \\"Coloured Rain\\" alone is worth the price of admission.  Add in a unique interpretation of Johnny Cash's \\"Ring of Fire\\" and a soulful take on the Bee Gee's \\"To Love Somebody\\", among others, and you've got an indespensible relic of the late '60's.    4 out of 5 stars for the aforementioned filler.    By the way, Repertoire also issued Eric & the Animals' penultimate album, \\"Every One of Us\\", at the same time - another strong recommedation.
B0001611DI|4.0|Im not big into zombie movies but this was REALLY GOOD. Im sure it was a classic for its time. It is one of the most grusome movies Ive seen and ive seen many horror movies. The director is an amazing filmmaker. I dont get shocked or scared easy but this one shocked me. I wasnt really scared by it but when the zombies start eating people it shocked me , it was so realistic. The plot is good to. I recomend this for zombie fans or just horror fans in general like me. I dont like most zombie movies and this one I enjoyed. The only part i wish wouldve been diffrent were the ending, it couldve been better. The actors were pretty good and the zombies great. The makeup work, the violence IS A++++ the best. Highly recomended. Classic. Id say in general its a 4 star movie but among horror films a 4.5.
B0001GF2DS|5.0|Those who love \\"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly\\" with all their hearts and those who think less of it.  <br /> <br />Those who think less of it have their reasons and I'm sure they are good, but when push comes to shove this movie is exilirating escapist movie making at its peak. It does defy common sense at times but that's part of the charm. Leone is truly one of the most underated filmmakers of all time. Underappreciated I would say. But that's just me. <br /> <br />I recommend you rent before you buy - you can't take chances with this movie because of its strange style, but I don't think you'll be dissapointed.
B000002J3W|2.0|After a huge debut, and then the comeback of the year with the mighty Slave to the Grind, Skid Row's third effort, Subhuman Race, is a big let down. It has it's moments (Into Another and Breakin' Down) but is very disappointing for the most part. Every time I hear the chorus to Beat Yourself Blind, I cringe.
B000002OHF|2.0|This is an OK 70s album but it followed the magnificent Argus so it had a lot to live up to. Unfortunately the Ash didn't even try following it up. I like Sorrel, it has an Argus vibe about it, Beacon is nice and sounds good live, but the rest is just OK.
0743201140|1.0|Not only was this book not a page turner, but it help me fall asleep.  Get the Memory Book by Jerry Lucas.
B00005JMUL|4.0|The Polar Express book has long been a family favorite.  When marketing for this movie began Christmas of 2003, I looked forward to what was to come.  Charlie Rose interviewed Tom Hanks and Robert Zemeckis about the making of this film.  Their perspective was that the movie was very true to the book.  The beautiful illustrations of the book were skillfully captured by the movie.  There are also some new elements in the movie like a very captivating little girl who is a passenger seated very near the main character little boy.  Her introduction to the story add depth and dimension to the trip.  She compassionately saves a cup of hot chocolate for a little shy boy from the \\"other side of the tracks.\\"  There is also the introduction of a hobo riding the roof and under carriage of the train.  (also played by Hanks.)  All in all, this story feels like a bedtime story your grandfather might have read to you on a chilly winter night.  I was charmed, yet not captivated.<br /><br />All in all... a good effort with great visuals.  Worth seeing.
0345457684|5.0|I recently stumbled across this book as a recommendation on Amazon, and I found this to be one of the most enjoyable reads I a have had this year.  It's a gumshoe/cyberpunk cross that is well written, has tons of action and a good storyline.  Of course some rockin' sex scenes and some nanotech enhanced ass kickin' helped keep it interesting too.   Seriously though, what I enjoyed most about the book was the whole sleeving concept.   The basic idea is that in the future humans have the ability to save themselves electronically on cortical stacks at the base of the brain.  Yes, this is way out there, and somewhat unlikely.  But I isn't pushing the boundaries of what is safely believable what sci-fi is supposed to do?   Time machine, anyone?  Anyway, along with such concepts as fully developed human cloning, and faster than light communication, the possibilities for interesting plot lines abound.  And Morgan makes the most of it.  What was refreshing about this book was that it actually made me think at the same time as being entertaining.  What would it really be like to have lived in a youthful body for 500 years?  I don't know, but hold that thought whilst I gun down these pesky bad guys.  Highly recommended.
038572179X|5.0|Look to other reviews for discussions of plot and possible spoilers.  These are purely my reactions.  I read this novel with NO preparation whatsoever, and think the experience was much the better for it. <br /> <br />\\"Atonement\\" is utterly compelling, beautifully crafted and perfectly realized.  Story, character, plot twists, climaxes, cliffhangers and dnouement; everything is here exactly where it belongs and masterfully created.  I would hold this novel up as a shimmering example of everything a novel can be at its best.  Reading this was deeply satisfying on every level.  Ian McEwan writes with an emotional truth I completely bought and totally invested myself in.  You can't help but live this novel.  This will stay with me for the rest of my life. <br /> <br />Read it -- listen to the audiobook -- whatever it takes.  Do not miss this one.
B0002VEPRQ|5.0|Actually, in reference to the lyrics shown below, it should be \\"Tuppence a bag\\".  That's the price for a bag of bird food. <br /> <br />As for the film, I still believe there was never one more magical and entertaining.  I don't really buy DVD's, but this one's an exception...can't wait 'til it's released.
1400032717|3.0|There is so much hype and excitement over this novel (as evidenced by the over 500 reviews already submitted) that I really felt the need to chime in a bit more reasonably. <br /> <br />This novel has definite merit, but it is really not of a literary kind.  Based on the knowledge gained from friends who have studied and treated children and adults with similar neurologically-based challenges, the depiction of Christopher is extraordinarily accurate.  This is the novel's biggest strength.  I would whole-heartedly recommend this to anyone interested in what the world looks like to someone with Autism. <br /> <br />That said, please do NOT expect great literature for your money. <br /> <br />The plot of \\"Curious Incident. . .\\" is thin and predictable, offering few, if any surprises, especially if you have any experience with Autism.  The characters are likewise under drawn.  I do not give exception even to Christopher, the narrator, who seems to me more a careful representation of Autism than a genuine human suffering through it. <br /> <br />Read this if the topic interests you enough to pay ten bucks for it.  If you're hoping for something beautifully written, resonating, and genuinely affecting to lose yourself in, don't buy the hype -- this is not your book.
B00065JTBA|5.0|This is, as every other review said, the best collection of unreleased demos ever. Every time I start listening, I have to go through all 4 dics without starting over. If you're a true Bon Jovi fan, get this NOW! You can see why these songs didn't make the records, but they're still just as great. Especially the three songs featuring Richie, Dave , and Tico on vocals. Tico does an amazing job on \\"Only In My Dreams\\". To quote Jon \\"... he sings from his belly.\\" There is a hidden bonus track at the end of the last disk, ten seconds after the listed track ends, but it's a suprise! You'll love it (please, nobody be a jerk and ruin the suprise.). I can't wait to see what the guys realse in the spring on their next studio album.
B0000AYL17|5.0|1981's Gaucho was the last release the band had until the release of Two Against Nature in 2000. Gaucho follows the pop-jazz path of their previous release Aja. The album has all the Steely Dan trademarks: impeccable production, cynical and venomous lyrics and undeniably catchy songs. \\"Babylon Sisters\\" opens the album with silky aplomb and then it moves into maybe the best Steely Dan song, the incredible \\"Hey Nineteen\\". The title track is an underrated song that doesn't get enough play and the album closes out with the crisp \\"Third World Man\\". Gaucho often gets lost in the shuffle as it followed Aja, but it is every bit a good as that album and ranks right up there with anything this great band has released.
B000002QWD|5.0|I first heard this album from an old vinyl LP called \\"Merry Christmas\\" Bing Crosby on Decca Records (DL 8128 MG 4088). I could not find a year/date anywhere on the sleeve or LP.  The LP has 12 tracks with note at the bottom of list \\"These records, with the exception of the last four titles, are also available on Decca Long Play Record DL 5019 (33 1/3 RPM), and Decca Extended Play Record ED-547 (45 RPM).\\" Tracks on this \\"Long Play 33 1/3 RPM\\" LP are in the following order: <br />side 1 <br />1. Silent Night (Christmas Hymn) Franz Gruber. <br />2. Adeste Fideles (O, Come, All Ye Faithful) with Max Terr's Mixed Chorus and John Scott Trotter Orchestra (Sung in Latin and English). <br />3. White Christmas with Ken Darby Singers and John Scott Trotter Orchestra, Irving Berlin. <br />4. God Rest Ye Merry, Gentlemen with Max Terr's Mixed Chorus and John Scott Trotter Orchestra. <br />5. Faith of Our Fathers with Max Terr's Mixed Chorus and John Scott Trotter Orchestra, Henri F. Hemy, J.G. Walton, Frederick W. Faber. <br />6.

Mele Kalikimaka (Merry Christmas) with Andrews Sisters and Vic Schoen Orchestra, R. Alex Anderson <br /> <br />I hope this sheds some light on this budget classic release.  It is all time Christmas favorite, filed along side the Elvis Presley \\"Blue Christmas\\" LP mom and dad gave me fromtheir collection.  Enjoy!
B0002K6Z16|5.0|After The River became Bruce's first number one album, \\"Hungry Heart\\" became his first top ten song and a hugely successful world tour, one would expect his next album to be in a similar vein to keep up the momentum. Instead of a River clone, Bruce did a complete 180 and released the dark, brooding Nebraska. Bruce at the time was listening to Woody Guthrie and other depression era folk & blues artists and this album reflects those sounds. The album consists basically of just an acoustic guitar and harmonica and explores subjects such as murder, crime, loss and loneliness. The songs are all sung in the first person and that gives them an intimacy that is rarely felt from an album. Bruce would explore dark subjects on later albums (\\"Born In The USA\\" was original recorded for this album), but he never recorded them in such a bare and stark nature. On this album, Bruce asks alot of questions and dares you to search for answers. The search is well worth the time and effort.
B0002Z1EG2|1.0|This CD gets one star for the fabulous Bill Currington.  I would have given it two, but they put the solo version of From This Moment on it - deleteing the fabulous Brian White.  Shania's songs sound so much alike I will start humming one and right in the middle continue on with another.  It's very irritating. Her music has not evolved or changed direction at all - like a truly talented musician would.  But she's no musician.  I think she's pretty much said all she has to say musically.  Please!!!!  Actually I am puzzled by the CD because I am sure all her rabid fans have purchased everything she has recorded. You would be better off just buying the single version of the Billy Currington or Mark McGrath duet.
B00064X3FE|5.0|Captain Fantastic & The Brown Dirt Cowboy is the most personal album Elton John has ever recorded. A concept album, it conveys stories from the lives of Mr. John and his co-writer Bernie Taupin. The title track opens the album with an old west sound that tells of Captain Fantastic (Mr. John) and the Brown Dirt Cowboy (Mr. Taupin) and their search for fame. It is a great track. \\"Bitter Fingers\\" tells of the struggles of writing a hit song when your world is falling down around you. \\"(Gotta Get A) Meal Ticket\\" is a ripper about a starving artist while \\"Better Off Dead\\" deals with Mr. John's dark thoughts. \\"Someone Saved My Life Tonight\\" also deals with his suicidal thoughts and is actually based on a real life event in which Mr. John tried to kill himself by sticking his head in a lit oven. The song still managed to become a top ten hit despite its somber subject matter. \\"Curtains\\" closed the original album and it is an operatic, stirring finale to a brilliant album. The bonus tracks are three classics including his number one hit, reggae flavored version of The Beatles \\"Lucy In The Diamonds\\" which features Dr. Winston O'Boogie on guitar. Dr. O'Boogie is of course John Lennon who became good friends with Mr. John and also collaborated on the achingly beautiful \\"One Day At A Time\\". The album closes with another number one hit, the powerful, catchy and rolling \\"Philadelphia Freedom\\" which was written as a tribute another friend, Billie Jean King, named after her tennis team. Mr. John was so popular at this time that Captain Fantastic & The Brown Dirt Cowboy became his sixth consecutive number one album and the first album ever to debut at number one on the Billboard album charts.
B00005AQE8|5.0|2PAC is my favourite rapper of all time (and i aint riding anything).... this brotha could do no wrong.... he was a actor, poet, activist, hell of a dancer, and a influence to every single rapper on the face of this earth... PERIOD.... <br /> <br />this double disc was different at the time... no rapper put out a double disc... that was wierd at the time (now every1 is releaseing a double disc from outkast to britney spears, from nas to even lil' flip... <br /> <br />my favourite tracks are 'all about u'w/ nate dogg, 'holla at me', 'how do you want it', 'california love', 'ambitionz az a ridah', and 'life goes on' this whole album is off the chain. <br /> <br />if you like true hip hop and not this crap on the radio... pick this CLASSIC album up and learn something... <br /> <br />the greatest....5 out of 5 stars
B00004S875|5.0|After Billy Joel hit the big time with The Stranger, he had the unenviable task of following up that classic. While 52nd St. isn't as good as The Stranger, it is still a tremendous record. The album opens up with the venomous and hard \\"Big Shot\\" and then does a complete 180 with the quite \\"Honesty\\". \\"My Life\\" is the big hit off the album and it bounces along while \\"Zanzibar\\" is the best song on the album. It has a smoky, jazzy feel and is one of the most interesting songs Mr. Joel has ever done. \\"Stiletto\\" has some slick piano work and \\"Rosalinda's Eyes\\" employs a Latin sound. \\"Half A Mile Away\\" is full of horns and verve and \\"Until The Night\\" is a slower number in which Mr. Joel stretches his vocal muscle. The title track closes the album out on a jazzy note. 52nd St. proved that Billy Joel was no fluke, as the album became his first chart topper and won the Grammy for Album of the Year.
B00005ALP6|2.0|\\"My fair lady\\", an adaptation of George Bernerd Shaw's play \\"Pygmalion\\".   <br />From my point of view the movie, My Fair Lady is a fairly good adaptation of Shaws play'. It is true that some of Shaw's original ideas are missing or are misinterpreted. From the point of view of producers and directors, it is understandable that they had to change the play in its movie adaptation in order to make it interesting to the viewers and maintain profits. For example the people at the horse races dressed in black and white was a funny scene, but it wasn't anything like that in Shaw's play. <br /> <br />Overall the movie for me as a 16 year old who is more interested in action movies from this century was not one of the most exiting I have seen. I must confess I fell sleep watching it, but in the the time the movie came out it was a huge succes. <br /> <br />Earlier I was talking about the diferences between the movie and the play but there are many aspects of the film that were very succesfully passed from paper to film. For example the character of Henry Higgins maintained the feeling it gave us when we read the play. Rex Harrison's performance as Mr Higgins was indead one of the best Ive seen. He really kept the satire in his character. When Eliza embarassed him at the tea party and he put the tea cup over his head and turnd away, it was a funny bit of satire  <br /> <br />Audrey Hepburn also had an outstanding performance. We could see the changes in Eliza very clearly as she became more educated and changed from a flower girl to a lady. <br />We could see how Eliza started to talk differently and act differently. She becomes a lady at the end of the  movie and we can see that she cant return to the streets.  <br /> <br />In this way the movie and the play were the same. <br />
B0002Z9HT8|5.0|Bob Geldof's Live Aid, an ambitious one-day, two continent concert on July 13th, 1985 for the starving in Ethiopia was a major cultural landmark of the 1980's.  Harkening back to the spirit of the sixties, the simultaneous concerts at Wembley stadium in London and at JFK in Philadelphia showed that musical artists could make a difference in people's lives.  Some of the performances from the concert were stellar and some fall short, but the fact that all the entertainers gave freely of their time to help a worthy cause should be remembered.  Of the two shows, the Wembley show produced the best performances.  U2's performance of a blistering \\"Sunday Bloody Sunday\\" and a majestic \\"Bad\\" helped catapult them into superstars.  Queen's performance is lights out and Dire Straits performance with Sting on \\"Money For Nothing\\" and alone on \\"Sultans Of Swing\\" is often overlooked, but powerful. The JFK performances were not as strong, but good sets by The Pretenders, Tom Petty & The Heartbreakers and Tina Turner joining Mick Jagger.  The DVD does not contain the entire concert as some acts have songs cut and other acts do not appear at all (Led Zeppelin refused to allow their performance to be include as they felt it was substandard).  While this is, of course, disappointing, the set is still worth buying.  The concert and the Band Aid & USA for Africa singles didn't end hunger as it is still a problem almost twenty years later, but it raised the world's consciousness towards it and showed that people still have the power and the will to help those in need, no matter where they live.
B000002J09|5.0|anyone who reads this, please check out \\"matrix mark's\\" review of this album and his other reviews. i really think he's kidding around, but if he isn't, then dear god, what a loser. He actually said that kurt cobain was a better guitarist than jimi hendrix. lol! man, i really hope this dork is joking.
B0000E64TR|5.0|The time seemed right for Elton John to do a time honored tradition, release a double album. Goodbye Yellowbrick Road is a sprawling album full of melodic hits and potential hits. The album opens with an eleven minute masterpiece \\"Funeral For A Friend/Love Lies Bleeding\\". The first half of the song is a swirling instrumental and then merges into a ripping rocker. \\"Candle In The Wind\\" made it's first appearance here and it's nostalgic lyrics hit the mark. \\"Grey Seal\\" is a remake of a song from the time of the second album and \\"Jamaica Jerk-Off\\" is a funny song set to a Caribbean beat. \\"All The Girls Love Alice\\" is a pulsating rocker and \\"Harmony\\" is a honey dipped ballad. \\"Bennie & The Jets\\" has the memorable piano riff and the crowd noise gives it the feel of a live record. The title track is song of lost love and fame and has the feeling of a Broadway show stopper. \\"Saturday Night Is Alright For Fighting\\" is as a hard a rocker as Mr. John has ever recorded and it will get your juices flowing. The album cemented Elton John as the biggest act in music of the time and spent eight long weeks lodged at the top of the charts.
B000002OVJ|5.0|It seems like a lot of the Who material out there is not entirly the original band.  The \\"Live at the Royal Albert Hall\\" CD and DVD, the \\"Live in Boston\\" DVD, \\"The Who Rocks America\\" VHS.  Very little is officially available that features the original band.  Thankfully, this is one that does.  Recorded at Leeds University in 1970, this is certainly one of the Who's best live efforts.  Keith Moon's drumming is such that no one can match.  And I think the added tracks are a real treat.  They are only further evidence that the Who is a great rock band.  The CD opens with a great version of \\"Heaven and Hell.\\"  This is followed up by favorites such as \\"Substitute,\\" \\"I Can't Explain,\\" and \\"My Generation.\\"  For me the standout of the album is a terrific version of \\"Summertime Blues.\\"  I also recommend the Isle of Wight CD or DVD.  The Who rock on and on.
B00064X3FO|5.0|This self-titled album was Elton John's second and breakthrough release in America. Mr. John and Bernie Taupin had been collaborating for a few years, but they really started to gel as a team on this release. The album has almost a baroque sound to it with alot of strings, harpsicords and airy syntheseisers. Of course everyone knows the megahit \\"Your Song\\", but the album contains others that would become Elton John classics. \\"Sixty Years On\\" is a stirring lament about growing old, \\"The Greatest Discovery\\" is a sweet ode to the birth of a brother, while \\"The King Must Die\\" ends the album in dark epic fashion. \\"I Need You To Turn To\\" & \\"First Episode At Hienton\\" carry on in the somber-like tone. The album is dominated by, but not regulated to classical stylings. \\"No Shoestrings On Louise\\" has a country twang, \\"The Cage\\" is a funky rocker, while both \\"Take Me To The Pilot\\" & \\"The Border Song\\" have gospel influences (Aretha Franklin had a big hit with \\"Border\\"). While not as radio-friendly as future Elton John releases, this album has an experimental feel and is worth repeat listenings.
B00065JTBA|5.0|first off let me say i am a huge bon jovi fan and have songs from them that aren't even in this box set and i thought some of them were great. and that i heard evrything they did. well i was wrong! I haven't heard almost all these songs. and the thing i want everyone to know that's reading this and thinking about this box set first off almost all the songs sound like they were rcorded today in 24+track studios! i don't know how they remastered some of these old songs to make them sound this good but if you are wondering about quality it is 100% quality!. this set just shows me how jon and richie and everyone involved are one if not the best band and songwriters of all time (my opinion) and the dvd is 1:00:00 long.
B00007LTIL|5.0|In 1970, The Grateful Dead released two albums that marked a change in the band's sound. Starting with Workingman's Dead, they moved away from the acid rock of their first releases towards a more rootsy, acoustic based music. Following up Workingman's Dead was the beautiful and brilliant American Beauty. Right off the top, the album shines with one of the band's all-time best songs, the gorgeous \\"Box Of Rain\\". The song has an almost country sound with heavily strummed acoustic guitars, a finger picking electric and perfect harmonies. \\"Friend Of The Devil\\" is another country flavored laid back song while \\"Sugar Magnolia\\" has a faster pace. \\"Operator\\" is a bit of a come down, but the effervescent \\"Candyman\\" pick things right up and they continue with the beautiful and inspirational \\"Ripple\\". The autobiographical \\"Truckin'\\" closes out the best album in the Dead's catalog.
B000002J09|5.0|This is in my top 5 albums of all time.  It is just the essential definition of rock n' roll music.  Jimmy page is a God, one of the greatest with a guitar I have ever heard.
B0006IUDXA|5.0|Thank you...    Macgyver resembles all that is innovation. He (and the show entirely) is the centerpiece of all types of engineering and puzzle solving. It is quite obvious that Macgyver was influenced from Adventure games like King's Quest and Zork.....and inspired an cult generation of Adventure gamers that still participate greatly in the Adventure genre. I too am one of these loyal advocates. Macgyver and Adventures share an enormous scope of characteristics. Both are some of the best forms of entertainment and education in existence.    Many think that Macyver is stupid and is plagued with bad acting, writing, action, direction, scoring, etc....  But it's not about that (eventhough sometimes they are pretty bad.)  It's about a true Hero that doesn't have any powers.  Just his body and mind.  (And this is even more solidified that Mac hates guns.)      Heroes are all about inspiration.  Mac inspired me showing that you truely can make something out of nothing.  Thinking outside of the box.  Personally, I call this a dynamic mindset; in essence, a dynamic mindset is a ton of varying viewpoints that do not focus on one topic or solution.  This mindset is also analogized via Mac's Swiss army knife.  A Swiss army knife is a n all purpose tool that can be used for any number of jobs; in essence a varying tool.  That is why they fit that well together.    This show is not about whizbang action or drama.  It is about a TRUE hero.       JOIN us as we Adventure into our forbidden treasure that is Macgyver on DVD..........after many sleepless nights praying this would come.    My cup runneth over, Lysergic Communion......We can now die happy men (edit: and women) once we receive these sets.........    (edit: i deleted my last review because i didn't like some things I said.)
B00068IOWM|5.0|After four years, U2 have released their 11th studio album called \\"How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb.\\"  It has the elements of any great U2 production, the addictive singles which get you jumped up, the signature ballads, and of course the songs which you can appreciate but take time to grow on you.  These seasoned veterans have been in the game for about 25 years now, but they still have that youthful energy which makes so many people passionate about their music.  After many listens, I think the new album stands above any of their 90's work, except maybe \\"Achtung Baby\\" <br /> <br />VERTIGO: first single and flat out rocking, Bono soars and Edge's slashing guitar are as hard as ever (4.5/5) <br />MIRACLE DRUG: wonderful piece of work, up there with u2's greatest. classic guitar and great lyrics (5/5) <br />SOMETIMES: good ballad which is still growing on me. good, but not great, but it is very emotional (3/5) <br />LOVE AND PEACE OR ELSE: another rocker, a very different side or U2.  sounds like something off the pop album, very good though, and the guitar work is insane (4/5) <br />CITY OF BLINDING LIGHTS: a future single for the band, very long with great lyrics and driving bass (4.5/5) <br />ALL BECAUSE OF YOU: has that old school rock feeling to it, another highlight for edge, who has a wicked guitar solo fired up by bono's classic yelling (4/5) <br />A MAN AND A WOMAN: a grower which really hasn't grown on me, U2 trying to do a R&B song and it doesn't work for me (3/5) <br />CRUMBS FROM YOUR TABLE: probably one of the most complete songs, has great lyrics and vocals by bonovox, and great guitar work by edge (4.5/5) <br />ONE STEP CLOSER: another grower which did grow on me.  very understated but at the same time has a big effect (4/5) <br />ORIGINAL OF THE SPECIES: the beatles, sorry, u2, do epic and it works out perfectly (5/5) <br />YAHWEH: very positive closer which sums up the album as a whole (3.5/5) <br /> <br />When it's all said and done, U2 will go downas one of the greatest bands to ever exist.  \\"How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb\\" captures the maturity of \\"All That You Can't Leave Behind,\\" takes snippets from the experiments of \\"Pop,\\" and finally continues the tradition of youthful energy of \\"Boy.\\" A release us U2 fans will be very satisfied with, and we will follow...
B00000732C|5.0|I was introduced to Primal Scream, well, their music at least, by this favorite person I used to know.  I had no music of my own at the time, or so I thought.  I mean no one at the age of 23 admits to liking John Denver. Anyway, I purchased all of Primal Screams albums. I hated them all.  I thought they were chaotic and redundant.  Except this one.  This surprised me.  Tranquil and hazy.  Its like being alone in your thoughts, without life intruding.  So, I sent the others away but this one I keep.  Thanks JS.
B00005ALP6|3.0|I have just finished watching MFL in english class, and I must admit that I ABSOLUTELY loved it. All the lovely sing-a-long songs really touched my heart, I cant wait for the moment to see it again.  <br /> <br />Although I ABSOLUTELY loved this film, I enjoyed the book like a hundred times more. The only downside I see to such an impressive masterpiece is the fact that much of Shaw's humor, and views are striken from MFL. This is a fault. But nevertheless I am compelled to agree with anyone in all their senses, that without doubt this is an ABSOLUTE classic.  <br /> <br />If I had to pick between the film and the book, I would have to choose the book, not that the movie is not an ABSOLUTE masterpiece, but more that the book, as is the case with most books taken to the screen, is much MUCH better. In MLF Freddy apears to be a highly respectable young man, in the book he is just a liar trying to \\"wing\\" it amongst the high-class, Claram, his sister does not even appear, what's up with that?
B0000959N0|5.0|mark steven johnson's director's cut of daredevil is something  i've been dying to see and i'm extremely happy that they are releasing it! fans should get both the theatrical cut and the director's cut in my oppinion. i have no regrets about getting the theatrical cut since additional scenes were shot for that and mark's commentary is priceless and the extra disc is awesome. the director's cut may not be a two disc set but it's going to be a better cut with SO MUCH EXTRA FOOTAGE. can't wait!!
B0006284JQ|4.0|As the liner notes state, \\"50 Million albums sold in five years...\\"  WOW, what an accomplishment!  To this simple fact, the cd title \\"Greatest Hits\\" holds true.  Everyone will have their views on Britney but just remember many back in the day used the phrase, \\"she won't last\\" to the Madonna as well and twenty years later...here we are and here she (Madonna) still is.  So this collection of songs is not the best song writing, or best vocals but they are good enough to be titled great, catchy pop songs (a few even to be considered classics).  I hope to see her come more into her own and start writing more songs herself.  AND yes, I know all the words to all her songs...true confession, take that!
1401300901|5.0|This is not just the best book I have ever read, it is the best book you will ever read. How do I know this? Because this book is the best book ever to be written. I am happy to say that Cecilia Ahern has brought forth from her young loins the greatest work of literature ever to be produced by a member of the human race. Reading this book will not just improve your life, it will enhance every aspect of the world around you too. Since Cecilia published her book, Ireland has become the best place in the world to live, and while Cecilia will probably remain domiciled in this fair country, the goodness is obviously spreading. Look at how America is improving by the day- this is because more Americans are reading Cecilia's lovely book. Soon the USA will also be the best place to live. If only the book could be translated into arabic...&#60;sigh&#62; <br /> <br />Cecilia is indeed angelically blessed. Her writing has been called naive and immature, even repetitive, and immature, but her father runs the country and she enjoys tax-free status, so who is getting things right here? God has come down to earth and dictated a chic lit novel of such breathtaking beauty that the fact that Murdoch paid a huge sum to her as a tax free advance which might have helped secure certain deals with her politician father need not even be mentioned.  <br /> <br />In short, this is the best book ever written. Cecilia is obviously a better author than Joyce (Val Joyce, that is) and is easier to read. You could read this book in a day (indeed, it only took slightly longer to write)and it is ten times stronger than the Bible, Koran, Da Vinci Code, all put together... <br /> <br />I am over the age of 13.
B00063MBU8|1.0|Honestly, I do not see how any person on the face of this blessed Earth can actually claim to like this band. They are nothing but a bunch of rich kids put together by a record company to make some cash, and by God, you kids are making all of their wildest dreams come true. <br /> <br />The \\"men\\" performing in this \\"band\\" are in their mid-twenties, kiddos. There is absolutely NO REASON for them to be singing about the high school drama they claim are \\"real problems.\\" Your arguement: \\"I can relate to the things they sing about.\\" No you can't, stop being selfish, little terds and realize life isn't about all the crap they idolize on their albums. <br /> <br />The so-called \\"music\\" they spew forth is boring and tedious to listen to, not one song strays from the typical verse-chorus-verse style, and NO talent is required to play a few power chords and hit the bass drum a few times. Whoo-hoo, angsty lyrics and mediocre musicianship to boot. Add some screaming thirteen year-olds and you've got yourself a steaming bowl of redundant, mainstream pop-punk. <br /> <br />Everyone who buys this album gets a free ***-whippin' from me, free of charge. Come one, come all.
B0002XDODU|5.0|The best cd of last year was Marylin Munster's \\"Golden Age of Grotesque\\". And that incredible album took its cue from Rammstein's \\"Mutter\\". Now, Rammstein are stealing back their own thunder with \\"Reise Reise\\"- the Deautch equivilent of \\"Grotesque\\". Picture Marylin Manson doing a gig at Stalag 13 and you get a good idea of \\"Reise Reise\\", which is both more melodic and more Gothic than \\"Mutter\\". Manson and Rammstein oughtta tour together!   (Rammstein fans should goto Amazon Germany- Amazon.de- and sniff out BOHSE ONKELZ. Especially their new CD \\"Adioz\\".)
B0002Z9HT8|5.0|I've waited almost 20 years to see these performances again and it has finally happened.  And once again the cause is good.  So there are some songs and performances missing.  So what?  Quit moaning and enjoy what is here, which is hour after hour of really worthwhile performances.  So what if the Led Zeppelin reunion isn't here.  I saw it.  Believe me, it's missing for good reason.  It was a great day in music for a really good cause, so sit back and enjoy.  I believe fans of Queen and U2 will really be glad to have this DVD set, even more than others, but hey, enjoy the music, laugh at the fashions, and help the cause!
B0002F6BRE|5.0|My wife and I went to the movies last year and our choices were BAD SANTA and ELF.<br /><br />Thank God we chose ELF.<br /><br />This movie hits all the right notes and will become holiday traditional viewing like A CHRISTMAS STORY and IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE.  They really knew what they were doing by making it family friendly too.<br /><br />Will Ferrell is absolutely perfect as \\"Buddy,\\" an adopted elf who discovers he's human and heads to New York to find this real father.  His energy and exuberance, along with a funny script, really makes this one work.<br /><br />I haven't even watched the extras yet but the movie is funny enough to give it five stars.
0553583182|5.0|What I love most about this book is how optimistic and uplifting it is. It's really hard to read it and feel sad or upset at the same time. And, because Murphy is so enthusiastic about the mind's own power, he radiates that enthusiasm to the reader. It can help you become a believer if you have trouble with your faith in his claims. It can encourage you to get up and try again when you feel beaten to the pavement by life. It can help you to see the divine qualities that are inherent in you when all you can think about is how flawed and imperfect you are.  <br /> <br />You will believe you have the potential for true joy, whether or not you want it now or later. If nothing else, Dr. Murphy is your friend when you need him as he now speaks from beyond the grave. Pertaining to subject matter and typical human issues, he leaves no stone unturned, and will help you to strenghthen your faith in whatever faith/religion you follow. It's just a great book to read many, many times over to remind you how to hope.  <br /> <br />P.S. Read this book with an open heart and mind...
B000669GAI|4.0|I've been a Pearl Jam fan since Ten and Vs.. They've been my favorite band for over 10 years. I own all the albums, live albums, dvd's, singles, anything I could get my hands on. When I first heard about a Pearl Jam Greatest Hits, I figured it would be a typical 15 song one CD release, similar to Soundgarden, Nirvana, Alice In Chains, Red Hot Chili Peppers, etc.. I also thought it would only include their early radio hits like Alive, Black, Even Flow, Daughter, etc.. As a die-hard fan I know some some of Pearl Jam's best songs have been written after 1994. I was totally blown away to see that it was a double disc, including many tracks after Vitalogy, and had 33 songs in total!<br />This Greatest Hits rocks from start to finish! I have no complaints at all on the choice of songs. I know from other Greatest Hits albums I own, that the more commercial songs are on it instead of some of my favorites.<br />I am a big Rock fan, I know the history of it very well, and own many ground breaking albums from The Beatles, Pink Floyd, Led Zeppelin, Neil Young, Nirvana, etc.. Pearl Jam is the best band of this Generation (sorry U2 fans, Bono, The Edge, and the boys don't come close to Pearl Jam) and could be in the top 10 all-time! This double disc Greatest Hits proves it! Buy the Album!
B00006AFUR|5.0|One word... WOW. Seriously one of the best albums i have ever heard. The production alone is amazing. Not to mention the lyrics and music. If you want a music EXPERIENCE i'd totally recommend this album. I'd also like to give props to all the 30STM fans. There are more of those then I thought. Keep one supporting this amazing band.
B0002S94OS|5.0|Ok, I bought this album about 2 weeks ago and it has not left my cd player yet. The production on this album is much better than on Palaces and it's just as brutal. I saw these guys at ozzfest this year and the were one of the better performances. Not too bad for a bunch of boys from Richmond. If you have never heard Lamb of God, buy Palaces and New American Gospel first. If you have heard them before, then you already have Ashes of the wake, I'm sure.  <br /> <br />Fork out the money, you won't regret it. <br /> <br />Oh yeah, stop buying Rollingstone magazine people, it's crap. And support your local metal scene.
0425170349|5.0|This was the first Tom Clancy novel I read and it got me hooked. I had looked at some of the back covers on his other books and thought that they looked kind of boring but this one looked interesting. I have now read all of his books and this is still my favorite. Personally, I get kind of sick of reading about Jack Ryan all the time and I'm glad that Clancy branched off into another topic. I will admit that the ending is an anti-climax but the rest of the book has as much action as any book that I have read.
B000062XFG|4.0|This season is notable for  a few things not many other reviewers have commented on-- the sole appearance of the wonderful Pakleds, the Dummies of Space, a very refreshing change of pace from the typical ST space menaces/pushovers. To this day, \\"He is smart!\\" and \\"We look for things to make us go\\" remain in my vocabulary.  The Pakleds never fail to make me laugh.  Too many trekkies are too uptight to enjoy them, I fear.  Then there is Lycia Naff's delightful Ensign Sonia Gomez, who only appears twice, alas.  Would that there were more episodes with this charmer!  They could have done a lot more with the Ensign Gomez; pity we never saw this.  Her enthusiastic naivete probably annoyed a lot of 'serious\\" fans, but I found her charming and the character could have filled the need for an \\"everyman/woman\\" type on a show mainly revolving around  super-gifted types.<br /><br />Q returns again (hurrah!) and Riker grows a beard and the holodeck begins to exert its colorful influence on the series and the crew survives the writers' strike, more dangerous than a pocketful of Klingons.  One misses Dr. Crusher, but no fear, she'll soon return for season three and beyond.  The ST:TNG program began to improve this season; by the next, all thrusters would hit warp speed at last.
B00008PX8P|5.0|This is truly my favorite music dvd.  It's nice to have these live versions of these songs, it's a nice change from what I'm used to hearing which are the studio versions(which in the end you can't beat.)  But these live recording sound really good and they are really rockin.  This dvd showcases the bands entire history and it does a damn good job of it too.  The acoustic set is great, it feels like an unplugged show.  And I love seeing the really young zeppelin from 1970.  The dvd concludes with a truly awe inspiring older Zeppelin at Knebworth.  This is guitar virtuosity at it's best.  Jimmy Page, Trey Anastasio, Eric Clapton and Hendrix are all on a level of being biblical.  Anyway I strongly recommend this dvd to any Zeppelin fan, also look into their live album \\"How the west was won.\\" and the original film \\"the song remains the same.\\"
B00005VWK3|5.0|Everybody that does or aspires to draw the human figure from imagination, not particularly from live study, should run, not walk, to get this book. A long time secret classic for people working with cartoons, concept art, character design and so forth. If you think you are covered because you got Burne Hogarth's books on the human figure, think again. Not to dis Hogarth, but this one is the real thing.
0698119347|4.0|This book is about a boy that lives in England with his uncle and his housemaid. His uncle works or a secret organization of spy's. His uncle is involved in a car accident and is instantly killed. The people he works for cum to see Alex  and tell him that his uncle is a spy and that he has to finish his mission.  What I thought about this book was that it is a very good book. I would recommend reading this book. This is a book for kids of all ages. This book keeps you interested the whole time there is never a dull moment <br /> <br />
068987474X|1.0|Most of what the male author of this book states is common sense.  E.g. \\"a cheating man is bad\\", \\"If he doesn't call you, ask you out, sleep with you, he isn't into you\\".  However--I hold great contention in how absolute the author in his assessment of men.  He presumes all men work the same, and that's just not true. <br /> <br />In the book he gives an example of a girl dating a man who's just come out of a divorce.  He's told her that he's not ready to get into a serious relationship right now because he just got out of one--makes complete sense.  The author's assessment?  \\"He's just not that into you\\".  Are you kidding me?  He says that if a man likes you, he will do what it takes to keep you in his life--he's knows a jewel when he sees one.  So are you saying that the fact that he just came out of a broken wedlock couldn't possibly have left him with hesitations about entering into another long term relationship so soon regardless of the girl?  Give me a break. <br /> <br />The author also says that if a man wants you, he'll do whatever it takes to get you.  I strongly disagree.  Take a look at the (male) author of this book, he's a self-proclaimed \\"bad boy\\", who we may deduce was probably pretty cocky when it came to dating.  I'm guessing (as per the \\"bad boy stereotypical formula\\") that he had no problems approaching and pursuing women.  The thing is though Mr. Author-man, not all men are created the same.   <br /> <br />Some men are shy.   <br />Some men genuinely have baggage.   <br />Some men need a little encouragement because their last few attempts have falled flat.   <br />I agree that the male should do a lot of the pursuing, but I don't think the girl needs to sit back and allow herself to be led at the will of the guy.  That's simply ridiculous. <br /> <br />The black and white \\"If he doesn't do 'x', then he's not into you\\" is way too simplistic, and it's a mindset that could potential ruin a perfectly good relationship if followed. <br /> <br />I do feel that some women make too many excuses for the way men treat them--and this book should shed light on them.  However, I caution them to read with a grain of salt because not all men are of the type the author write about. <br /> <br />I'm suspect when a non-expert writes so-called \\"expert\\" books.  There's definitely something to be said having formal education training --you understand that humans are complex beings composed of many different experiences, emotions, and opinions that form the way they react in a relationship setting. <br /> <br />My advice (and this is free!): Be yourself, relax, and don't try too hard to get someone to like you.  Recognize the common sense warning signs, and never stay in a relationship that doesn't make you happy 95% of the time.
B00007LTIA|5.0|One of the very few recordings that will send a \\"receptive soul\\" to the highest heights. Sounds silly, but it's not. The trick is to listen to it alone. Trust me, the others won't get it. You won't be wearing your boogie shoes while listening to this epic. No matter though. This gem is for the enlightened entities of our fair Earth. I recall listening to \\"The Remembering\\" while in a secluded spot in the Sierras (many years ago) and having that out of body experience that many pay huge bucks to experience. Do not listen to the naysayers, this album is remarkable and way ahead of its time.<br /><br />Buy it, double up on your diaper, sit back and listen. Then go in search of your soul after it leaves your body, and for some ungodly reason ends up in Canoga Park. The music is that intense and personal.
B00005LC1H|5.0|30 minutes on the lovely \\"Riviera of England\\" in the posh Fawlty Towers will raise your spirits.  Basil Fawlty (John Cleese) is the owner/propriator of a small hotel.  Basil has great plans for  raising the 'tone' of the establishment, his wife Sybil just wants to keep the 22 rooms reasonably full of paying guests, Polly (maid of all work) has hopes for escaping and Manuel (the Portugese waiter) would like to get through the day without incurring Basil's wrath. <br /> <br />The episodes are all delightful little gems, Basil attempting to 'thrash' a car into submission, pull one over on Sybil (or a hotel inspector) or catch a con artist (or a rat) are all hilarious. <br /> <br />The extras are also excellent, there interviews with Cleese, Prunella Scales (Sybil) and Andrew Sachs (Manuel) that supply entertaining insights into the series, as does the director's commentary.  There is also information on the various actors who made guest appearances in the series as well as a section of out-takes.
B000002C25|5.0|It's all well and good to be a Brit-pop band known for 4-minute radio songs, but that's not the way to challenge for the title of \\"Greatest rock and roll band in the world\\". Oasis's 1997 record Be Here Now was nearly as long as their first two albums COMBINED- despite only 12 tracks. The reason is a total abandonment of the pop sound for a sudden tendency- and talent- for rock epics, littered with noisy guitar solos, pounding drum-fills, and lighters-in-the-air hooks. The lead single, \\"D'You Know What I Mean?\\", clocks in at over 7 minutes. So do about half of the other tracks. Sometimes, the songs don't really go anywhere, and become annoying- like \\"Magic Pie\\". More often, however, Be Here Now is stunning, absorbing, enchanting, and powerful. \\"Fade In/Out\\", \\"Don't Go Away\\", and \\"All Around the World\\" are representative of that. Even when the songs are on the short side, the band rocks harder than they had before or have since, like \\"I Hope I Think I Know.\\" <br /> <br />Thanks to some of the songs off Be Here Now, Oasis became one of the best live acts of the late 1990's. This is one studio album that actually captures that feel: the grandiose energy that's become the band's trademark.
B00028HBKM|5.0|Yes of course ,Jesus kills nobody in this movie yet it still desturbs the mineds of liberals. I didn't expect to see any successful religius movie during my liftime and it is plesant suprise to me. Is this a violent movie? Yes, one could claim that, but I think that 80 % of the movies are more violent. In \\"The Passion of the Christ\\" only FOUR people die. Many liberal critics claim that the film based only on violance. I would remined them  of that idiotic bloodbath seen in \\"Dogma\\" which they claim \\"every Catholic should see\\". Antisemitism ? Guess who were Mary ,Peter , Veronica and other people who respect Jesus ... The anwser is simple : they were Jews. This is not just a story about a man (or a God) yet it is also the story about people who followed him or trying to kill him. Powerful music and high emotional scenes I just cann't express with words how beautiful it is.  Thank you, Mr. Gibson !!!  P.S. I hate George Bush !!!
B0001Z52RU|4.0|Wow! I really liked this movie much more than I thought I would. I was really impressed with Ashton Kutcher's performance. <br /> <br />It's a story about Evan (Kutcher) who has blackouts as a young child. He keeps journals and writes down everything he can remember so he can try and jog his memory. Later in life he is able to read these journals and use his memories to go back in time and change what happened then, and by doing that, he also changes the future. A very interesting movie! <br />
0385510438|4.0|John Grisham displays the ability to write a vaiety of types of books, all entertaining and unique.<br /><br />The Last Juror was not as fast paced and full of plot twists as some of his other works, but I think he was trying to portray life in an unspoiled, slow-paced Mississippi town in the 1970s - one that clung to Old South values and Old South traditions.<br /><br />I thought the commentary on how \\"Bargain City\\" swoops in and impacts small town America was interesting.<br /><br />I was very pleased with this book, and I am also proud of Mr. Grisham for keeping his books mostly clean and sticking to his faith in God.
B00004BZ0N|5.0|Awesome \\"double\\" album for cheap $.  There is not a weak song on here.  Love London Calling, Clampdown, Death or Glory, I'm not Down, etc ... too many to list here.  This CD Rocks!! Buy it, you will be happy you did.
B0000DZEA1|5.0|I don't know how much more I can add to what has already been said. While I personally don't feel the music from the 3rd film stood out as much as the first two, the inclusion of 'Into the West' by Annie Lennox is a definite highlight, and strengthens this album overall - pushing it from 4 stars to 5 stars on my chart. I'd also throw a bone to Billy Boyd's sensitive rendition of 'The Steward of Gondor'.
B0000028MA|5.0|Along with Temple of the Dog and the breakthrough records of Pearl Jam, Soundgarden, and Nirvana, the Singles soundtrack is one of my 5 absolute essential Seattle records. Pearl Jam is represented well here, with two fan favorites in \\"Breath\\" and \\"State of Love and Trust\\". Chris Cornell's solo \\"Seasons\\" acoustic guitar is practically definitive of the movie itself. The catchy \\"Dyslexic Heart\\" by Paul Westerberg sounds a little out of place, but it's a good song in its own right. \\"Crown of Thorns\\" by Pearl Jam predecessors Mother Love Bone is one of my personal favorite songs of all time, whether sung by Andy Wood or Pearl Jam's Ed Vedder. I could comment on every other song on here- it's just a collection of some of the very best music from the very best era in rock history.
B00068IOWM|4.0|i'd have to say that the review a couple of posts down by the guy slamming this album is the most inaccurate thing i've seen in quite awhile, but i guess its an opinion. however, just because it is not a 'guitar driven' album does not mean that it is bad, it in fact is just the opposite. maybe if you're looking for an album full of 'Vertigo'-esque songs then this wont be your thing. i can honestly say though that this is the best U2 album of the past ten years, and its almost as good as  Achtung Baby and The Joshua Tree. songs like 'Miracle Drug' and 'Original Of The Species' are U2 at their best as is nearly every song in between. 'Sometimes You Can't Make It On Your Own', which is already being talked about as a follow-up to 'One', is a great song written about Bono's father and has an amazing falsetto chorus. anyways, these reviews are hardly helpful to anyone i can think of but i just felt that i had to voice my opinion in case someone read through these and passed off a great album like this due to another reviewer.
B00005JMUA|5.0|Of course you have to watch the first movie to understand what's going on in this movie, but I liked this movie much better than the first. <br /> <br />Naturally, it completes the story of the \\"black mamba\\" and you get all the rest of the information in this movie. I felt it had much more of a plot, but still had some awesome fights. As a whole, I think both movies are awesome and worth watching! <br />
1591840562|5.0|Our business concept is unconventional. I'd read several business plan books and even tried business planning software, and was bending over backwards to make our concept fit the cookie-cutter notions provided by \\"the pros\\". We weren't getting any nearer to raising our initial operating capital.<br /><br />I got Guy's book the week it became available. Thanks to Guy, we totally revamped our plan and presentation materials. Now, our capital raising has begun in earnest. Just this week, we added three accomplished leaders to our management team. All had read our new business plan.<br /><br />The cover image on Guy's book is very appropriate. I read the book in two days, and since then have been totally on fire about our company. Guy's book is much more than a set of instructions: it creates a complete framework for success.
B0000024RZ|5.0|This right here folks is the successor to Dylan's highly acclaimed Freewheelin' and Dylan didn't take great a step down with this one.  Though not as timeless as The Freewhellin' nor as consistant, it does compile dark folk songs that certainly rank among Dylan's best from his early days.  Like the mystical numbers of Freewheelin', The Times They Are A-Changin' contains songs that simply blow the listener away time after time with their truth, emotion, love and despair.  The first notable one being 'One Too Many Mornings', a story of a man who reflects on the many days behind him and his lost fellings.  The simple guitar and harmonica here work beautifully at creating a most intimate setting for the tale.  The second song that stands out (IMO) is 'Boots of Spanish Leather', a song about a girl who leaves her man.  I absolutely love this song.  It just sounds so darling but ironically is so tragic.  It, in fact, reminds me of 'Girl From the North Country' on The Freewhellin' because their guitar parts sound similar (not to mention the love loss).  A third highlight is the epic 'Lonesome Death of Hattie Carroll' which investigates the murder of Hattie Carroll taking a third person point of view on the disgrace that it all was.  I'msure that I am not the first to say this but this song is an absolutely perfect recording of vocal and pace and purpose.  There is so much heart, so much hate, so much disgrace done impeccably.  Other notable tracks include everything else on side two and of course the title track.  To be honest though, I must concur with what others have expressed, 'With God On Our Side' at times does indeed drag a little too long.  I also should offer that 'The Ballad of Hollis Brown' and 'North Country Blues' may suffer a little in the melody categories though they still are important parts to this album.      To sumorize these thoughts- you would be foolish to read this review and decide not to buy this record.  One of Dylan's more personal, it offers brilliant love and protest songs that will no doubt affect you.
B00006RINF|1.0|I have been a true Lacuna Coil fan for the past 4-5 years. However I was awating this CD to come out and I decided to listen to it first, and boy am I glad i saved my money. lyrics by far not as passionate, male vocals suck. Female vocals are not frequent enough as in there previous albums. I really think that Lacuna Coil should of broken up if they were going to do something so horrible. Im still a fan of there older works but This by far is the worst of there albums yet, hopefully theres not another one if its going to be anything like this. No ones CD player deserves to be put through this torture!!!! thats my 2 cents!!!
B0006284JQ|5.0|Almost all the singels but missing 2, &quot;from the bottom of my broken heart&quot; &amp; &quot;don`t let me be the last to know&quot;. Those 2 songs should be on the cd too seeing &quot;Everytime&quot; is. I guess this is meant to be more of a fast up beat CD with all of the faster songs except &quot;everytime&quot;. but anyway, never mind the bad reviews, they know they like it. Even if you have all of her CD`s you should still get this one, the new songs are awesome and the bonus disk is really good. well worth the money.some people just write bad reviews because their jealous and they know she`s talented ect. This is a must have for any britney fan or even if your not a fan, because alot of people who say they don`t like her and her music really do. they just don`t want to admit it, but hey, some really don`t like her, i`m just saying. You should also get the dvd, it got all the videos on this cd and more and the songs that are missing from this are even on it. the song &quot;do somethin`&quot; is awesome and very different from the rest of her songs, not that the other songs are bad. my prerogative and i`ve just begun (having my fun) are really great too. best songs on the bonus disk in my opinion are toxic, breathe on me, and the chris cox megamix, well that`s all i gotta say, buy the CD and Enjoy!<BR>keep the music comming brit, don`t stop for too long,cya.
B00005JLZN|5.0|This movie is totally awesome!! Kate Winslet is a journalist picked to interview death row inmate David Gale. It takes place over a four day period (Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday she has the interview, and Friday is his execution day). Of course this movie is filled with flashbacks, but it is pretty easy to follow along. The ending is absolutely mind blowing!! If you're a Kevin Spacey fan, or just in the mood for a good drama with a little psychological twist you should definitely check this out!!  <br />
B00003CXCW|5.0|I am a wannbe film maker who loves great films. I thought I would get this one for a try and thought it would be okay, but not as good as they said it was. Boy was I wrong! This is the one of the best films ever made! It is also one of the first to go against the anti-artistic corruption of Holloyood. Even today they are surpressing great film makers works of art and turning them into formulas. This movie set the record straight on what makesa a good films great, and at the same time became a great films itself. See this film!
B000002H97|1.0|I know a lot of people like this record.  I know it sold very well and is responsible for elevating Metallica to the level of rock royalty.  That doesn't mean it's any good.  Could all those people be wrong?  Sure they could.  Look at Britney Spears.  Or how about Vanilla Ice, remember him?  The sad thing is, Metallica was talented.  For me, this record marked the beginning of the end of one of the greatest rock bands ever. <br /> <br />I grew up listening to Metallica.  The first time I heard \\"Hit the Lights\\" I said something like, \\"What the hell is that?\\"  The music was so aggressive, vibrant, and above all, totally new.  Then came Ride the Lightning followed by their crowning achievment, Master of Puppets.  With these three albums, Metallica had created and perfected a new kind of music.  This rarely happens!  Cliff Burton died and a few years later we got ...And Justice For All.  It was a step down, but it was still an ambitious recording.  It was apparent that the group was trying desperately to stay fresh and exciting.  I guess they ran out of ideas or just quit trying.  I think they actually made a conscious decision to dumb it way down and to become rock stars.  Why else would they have chosen Bob Rock to produce their next effort?   <br /> <br />Now, I feel the need to clarify a few things.  I did not expect or desire for Metallica to stagnate.  Why would I?  They never had before.  Ride the Lightning was a progression from Kill em' All.  Master of Puppets did not rehash material from Ride the Lightning.  Metallica had always progressed as a band, moving forward and writing better and better music.  I feel they took a huge leap backward with their fifth release. <br /> <br />I also want to explain that it is not simply a lack of complexity or of speed or any arbitrary aspect of their previous work that makes this record sub-par.  It is a lack of effort, resulting in a lack of quality.  \\"Enter Sandman\\" is just a big, dumb rock song.  The production is polished, but it cannot mask the mediocrity of the music.   <br /> <br />
0140277447|1.0|I visited this site today because I was just shocked to know that Iris Chang killed herself due to her long lasting depression. But what makes me more uncomfortable is that here I saw so many people are denying this history. I am Chinese and I stayed in Nanjing for 7 years. During my 7 year stay in the city, I often heard news that numerous skeletons were digged out by construction workers in the city, with Japanse bayonets and wine bottles,etc. To my surprise, even some Korean here is helping Japanese rightists to deny the history.<br /><br />But anyway, if this problem is not resolved, there must be another war between two countries sooner or later in the future. And I guess China now is no longer a weak country as 70 years ago, which any one could humiliate unhesitantly.......<br /><br />\\"The Rape of Tibet\\" is NOT a Holocaust!
B0006A9FMI|5.0|I saw this at the theatre, on the big screen. WOW, the opening credits and the music...WOW. The visuals cannot be described with words. I was whispering \\"Amazing\\" and \\"Incredible\\" until the City and Parade scenes toward the end. Outstanding! <br /> <br />Some people had trouble with the pacing of the film, I thought that the story was perfect. Simply put, this movie picks up where the last one left off. Concepts about life, death and the nature of humanity are explored throughout the film with style and grace.  <br /> <br />Be warned: Ghost In The Shell 2 - Innocence is not really an action film. But if you like REAL Anime, then you will love this work of art.
B00005JN4F|4.0|I really liked this movie alot! I thought the chemistry between Jimmy Fallon and Queen Latifah was awesome. <br /> <br />The story is about a cop, Washburn (Fallon), who has a major problem with driving. After his license is taken away, he winds up taking a taxi to a bank robbery. The taxi driver is the car obsessed Belle (Latifah) whose dream is to drive in a Nascar race. Of course an unlikely friendship forms and wacky things happen. Ann Margaret also stars in this as Washburn's alcoholic mom. <br />
B0000DD7LC|5.0|hands down to alicia keys again.. some artists are fake like britney spears.. actually i can't even rate alicia keys in the same catagory as her because britney spears could never compare to alicia keys.. not only is she beautiful but she has the true talent to back it up... have you heard her sing live?? well i haven't but you can sure as hell believe i would be first one in line to buy her tickets if she ever came to calgary.. listen to her music.. listen to her words and you'll understand why alicia keys has so much hype surrounding her.. like she said.. watch her when she's 31.. 41... and 51 she'll still be around.. this woman is so talented.. writes her own music, own lyrics.. plays the piano and sings at the same time.. unsurpassed.. if you're debating whether or not to buy her album.. you're a fool.. and don't buy it.. because if you have to debate.. you don't have enough love for her talent to buy her cd in the first place
B000002BBY|2.0|OKAY let's state the obvious here: You don't have to be real hard core Beatles fan to notice how Beatlesque the band Oasis sounds. &#60;Note to Noel Gallagher: you're full of it, man. You shouldn't call people nipples especially when they're the guitarist for the band you're trying to (miserably, I might add) copy off of.&#62; This CD sounds like what a Beatles tribute band would sound like if they tried to write all original songs...it still has that strong Beatlesy vibe to it. This CD is a crappy, lame British Invasion revival attempt by a bunch of sad poseurs who can't find their own sound so they try and rip off of the one British band that started this whole thing. I don't like Oasis because of who they are and what they have publically said about one of my idols, and yes I know that personal opinions shouldn't affect the way I feel about their music, and so I'm rating this album 2 stars 'cause you gotta give these guys at least some props for trying.
0345440900|4.0|I will start by agreeing with one of the previous reviewers: this book does NOT advocate attachment parenting. If that's your style and it's working for you, then most of this book might turn out to be useless to you. If, like me, you haven't decided if you want to use attachment parenting or something else, this is a good read. I read this one and the Sears books on AP and found this worked better for me.<br /><br />I can't speak to her words on breastfeeding-I skipped that section due to overexposure on breastfeeding advice. However, I found the recommendation for a structured routine (not a SCHEDULE!) very helpful. She points out that it's not a schedule, but a suggested timing of 2.5-3 hours for feedings. She does state that infants never need to feed more often than every two hours, but also that some special circumstances can exist.<br /><br />The most helpful thing I found in this book was the two tables on reading infants' cues- what different cries can sound like and body language, too. This was the golden fleece for me and my husband. As first time parents who almost never babysat, we were clueless how to read our baby's cries and cues. While she certainly wasn't absolutely right, she gave us enough info to work out the few specific differences with our son.<br /><br />Her description of the three stages of going to sleep was also indispensible for us. It made knowing when to put my son into bed much easier. In the space of a week, I feel much more confident in my ability to take care of my son.
B000026FOA|5.0|Five Leaves Left.\\"  The title itself seems a puzzle, and this sometimes sparse yet strangely compelling testament likewise contains other riddles and juxtapositions. Foremost is Nick Drake's own character, who, though lost to us, saw nuances and meaning in everyday life that most tend to gloss over and seemed to follow muses hidden to most.<br /><br />Whether conversing with \\"time,\\" in the opening track, Time Has Told Me (full of foreshadowing of Mr. Drake's inner turmoil); suggesting that we \\"look through time and find your rhyme\\" in Way to Blue; or acknowledging the cycle of life in Day Is Done, Mr. Drake is transfixed by the ephemeral elements of life, the cycle of seasons, and the need to self-evaluate.<br /><br />He writes lyrics about the deeper meanings of things and the inherent tension of trying to live life fully without becoming mired in melancholy, like a water skimmer shooting across a slow moving creek.<br /><br />Certainly Mr. Drake was also a master of understatement---though I think the string section may be a bit much in a couple of passages---the interplay of Mr. Drake's voice (I'm unsure what adjectives to apply to his singing), his acoustic guitar, and the congas and bass imbue Three Hours and Cello Song with shimmering elegance.<br /><br />The original production was excellent, and the remastering accentuates the tenor of the songs. \\"Five Leaves Left\\" provides an appropriate soundtrack for the in-between seasons of fall and spring and the transitional spaces one often carves out of mornings and evenings.
B000000HHE|5.0|De la Soul were (along with \\"A Tribe Called Quest\\"), both 'The Thinking mans Rap Group', but also a Hip-Hop group that weren't obsessed with getting 'Paid & Laid'.  What they had was a manifesto of Witty Wordplay, Freewheeling carefree attitude, a level of eclecticism rivalled by few, and (most people forget this) occasionally tackling serious subjects.    Where they dropped \\"3 Feet & Rising\\" in 1989, it (with the exception of \\"A Tribe Called Quest\\"), it marked a truly substantial album, that shifted the goalpost away from over confident posturing & a dour outlook of the streets, and delivered a supremely confident, assured & Energetic debut that raised the bar for the small 'Intelligent Rap' genre.    This was achieved through several fundamentally important elements.  (1) Taking 2 gifted rappers \\"Posdnuos, Trugoy, & DJ Pasemaster Mase\\" (to emphasise their sense of humour, try writing down, the two rappers names backwards), that weren't adverse to either, Weaving clever wordplay and deft rhymes, against whimsical playful ideas, and an almost nonsensical humour.  (2) Having leftfield Producer (of 'Stetsasonic' fame) \\"Prince Paul\\" provide a lot of the musical ideas, image, direction, (and most importantly) sampling, that made up a large percentage of the album.  Prince Paul's involved in the project was vital, because instead of collating Hip-Hop samples from the usual sources (Exactly how many times, has \\"James Brown's - Funky Drummer\\" been sampled in Hip-Hop??), he went further afield for his samples (much further), so a mixture of: pop, jazz, reggae, and psychedelia, Country, 70's soul, Rock  (and, yes the obligatory 'James Brown' sample) were used to construct the musical part of the album.    And from this wildly eclectic ranges of samples, beats, loops.....songs were then built around, and thus the range is diverse, with lyrics ranging from social awareness (\\"Ghetto Thang\\") to stream of consciousness (\\"I Can Do Anything\\"), Through to brief, but creative musicalinterludes that break up the songs, (Can U keep A Secret?, De La Orgee, Description, Transmitting Live from mars), with the album peppered with a variety of songs that were strong enough to exist outside the structure of the album and work as standalone singles.  \\"Say No Go\\", \\"The Magic Number\\", Me Myself & I, which sampled everyone from blue-eyed soul artists \\"Hall & Oates\\", Country legend \\"Johnny Cash\\", Adult-Rock duo \\"Steely Dan\\", all meticulously sampled and spliced with Hip-Hop beats to create a kaleidoscopic arrangement of Leftfield songs that shunned thumping beats and veered more towards innovative offbeat ideas and fast and loose humour.    But there were, (hidden deep) within the album, traces of a social consciousness, with songs dealing with more substaintial issues such as: true love (\\"Eye Know\\"), the debilitating effects of drugs (\\"Say No Go\\"), issues of Sex (\\"Buddy\\"), and social/neighourhood concerns (\\"Ghetto Thang\\").  But It would be (largely) fair to say that as deftly arranged and constructed as these tunes where, they weren't the majority of the album.  And a lot of the split-second timing of the samples in songs, and clever in-jokes & various references are what most people remember them for.    When this album dropped, it was (and still is) a landmark album, all the cliches of Rap music were abandoned, it sounded like virtually nothing else at the time, It moved boundaries and pushed Hip-Hop into new and interesting directions....The Critics loved it, The General Public bought the album in droves, and all was Good, until.....    A minority of people (and Critics), decided that the 'Happy-go-Lucky' and 'Daisy Chain' themes and structure of the album, was deemed \\"uncool\\" & \\"over optimistic\\", and so the band on each successive album, gradually began to drop the playfulness and become more serious, and focused less on whimsical goofy Humour (The \\"De La Soul is Dead\\" album, being one of their most widely public efforts to move away from the personaof old).  Unfortunately as great as their track record with albums has been, It has been a steady gradual case of \\"Diminishing Returns\\", with each album to failing to capture the overall energy and enthusiasm contained within this exceptional album.  Sure, there's always people that are going to refer to them as \\"Hippy-Hoppers\\", but why is that considered a bad thing???......this is easily as important any any Hip-Hop album you care to mention, and no true Collection is complete without it.
B000084T18|5.0|Get rich or die tryin` was simply a classic.Multiple platinum awards speak for themselves,and the only reason that this album got negative feedback was because frustated haters who think they know about rap are mad that Shady/G-Unit is gettin theirs.Plainly put,Get Rich Or Die Tryin had every single track hot as hell,and 50 and G-unit`s lyrics are real,and there is not one living MC today who has more flow than today`s king of rap,EMINEM.50`s G.R.O.D.T is a classic,the awards speak for themselves,and it is a perfect example of why Shady Records got it locked.
B0002XH9Z4|5.0|Any review that reviews the *life* of a performer rather than the music and performance has a rather unfair axe to grind. After decades of music critics giving a wide berth to performers as Jerry Lee Lewis or Chuck Berry (or . . . there are plenty of performers who have crossed some fairly serious boundaries of one kind or another), it seems that Michael Jackson must pass a special standard. No one is making excuses for unaccetable behavior (sharing beds, sleeping bags, and bedrooms with pre-adolescents - at most one hopes); this behavior - even if it extends all the way toward Jerry Lee territory - should not permit professional or amateur critics to reduce his art to his life. Clearly, if one is really listening (and from samples, the sound quality and uncovered lyrics are extraordinary), it is clear that Michael Jackson was dealt a lousy hand in life and did not play it well; he nevertheless shows quite a bit of courage to release a song like \\"Scared of the Moon\\" at this time. No one can use the word \\"terror\\" and be speaking of someone else's childhood experience; it is a convenient literary device to swap the gender while getting the matter off his chest. Again, it is no excuse, but for an artist in the midst of such a serious crisis that could make this his penultimate collection as a musician (also differing from artists such as Lewis, Berry, Polanski, etc.) this is an act of rare courage. I hope this matter can be brought to a speedy close with the least damage to all parties, but whatever happens, Jackson should know that his real fans will ALWAYS respect his work and his artistic gererosity of spirit and guts. Fans, if they are fans, ought to be an artist's friends and friends maintian love even when they do not always \\"like\\" certain behaviors or attitudes. And this music, captured in pristine form, will stand. His dancing can only be imitated and his songwriting is unique in its raw depiction of a soul in torment. (Not to mention that the music itself kicks [...]!) Jackson is one of the few real legends of the past hundred years and should be accorded respect for his accomplishments.<br /><br />[...]
B00003CXA6|4.0|This IS a long movie and some of the acting leaves a lot to be desired -- see other reviewers' comments. However, the movie has some excellent performances by Jeff Daniels, Stephen Lang, Sam Elliott, and a few others.  I think the special features, especially the Making of Gettysburg and the Commentary are top knotch and give the viewer an even greater appreciation of the battles at Gettsburg and what is portrayed onscreen in the movie.<br /><br />The Battle of Little Round Top and Pickett's Charge in the film show the relentless human wave attacks that 20th century war buffs mostly associate with the Korean War and the Pacific campaign during WW II. However, GETTYSBURG conveys very well the disturbing reality that Civil War soldiers were killing relatives, friends, and neighbors in some of those battles and often in hand-to-hand combat.<br /><br />Don't look for the pace of action or the graphic depiction of battle casualties to rival those seen in SAVING PRIVATE RYAN or BAND OF BROTHERS. What the battle scenes in this movie depict is the deadly toll of large scale frontal assaults by both the Union and Confederate forces. It defies all logic to think that hundreds of men (thousands in Pickett's Charge) would march in formation while lethal cannon shells explode in their midst and enemy marksmen fire deadly volleys of musket rounds into the advancing ranks of foot soldiers and cavalry troops. Yet, with the aid of a small robotic helicopter used to film Pickett's Charge and the massive artillery barrage that preceded it, the scale of the battle and the deadly outcome for the attacking Confederate Army are depicted vividly.<br /><br />The futile but heroic plight of Pickett's men becomes apparent well before the attack even begins. These were some of our forefathers shedding their blood on that hallowed ground, and the film helps to show how costly that War of the States would be on the country's psyche for nearly another century after the war ended.<br /><br />Watch the movie, and judge for yourself./>Watch the movie, and judge for yourself.
B00003CXCT|5.0|There is a division among Star Wars fans about whether the revised newer editions are terrible and outrageous tamperings or if they are great additions to the remarkable cannon that has become a cultural icon.  The bad news for purists is that the new DVD set has more tampering and some of it isn't very good.  Han Solo still shoots second in the cantina and it appears in Empire that poor Darth Vader is aware that someone named Skywalker is in the Hoth system but is completely oblivious to the fact that this Skywalker might somehow be related to him.  That nothwithstanding, the DVDs are in better shape than the old videos you used to watch religiously and the whole of the works are not so disturbed that purists can't enjoy the other aspects.  Not much more has been cleaned up since the special edition videos were released, but the sound quality on the DVDs is much better [in most scenes].  The extras disc is absolutely loaded with documentaries, commentaries, demos and other expansive treats.  The extras on episodes 1 and 2 were exhaustive and compelling and they still pale in comparison to the volumes of interesting features packed into the 4th disc.  Overall, this compares favorably to last year's release of the Indiana Jones trilogy.  It is well worth the money and worth finding space on your shelf for.
B00005JMAH|5.0|I hope everything I commented is not illegal, but it's true, Harry Potter 3 DVD was released here in the Philippines in November 18, 2004 (November 17, 2004 in U.S.A.).  This is by far the best installment to date, but I am waiting for the Harry Potter And The Order of The Phoenix - My most favorite Harry Potter stories.  About the deleted scenes, just wait on the 23rd for you to find out.  Of course it is too unfair if I disclosed it to all of you (hehe).  It's up for you to find out....
B000002IOW|5.0|Right off the bat, I have to say you need to give this one few listens before passing judgement. After 1 listen, I was unimpressed. After 2, I was intrigued. Now, Presto is right up there with Rush's best IMO. Songwriting has probably never been better. My favorites are Chained Lightning, Scars, Warpaint, and Superconductor. But in all honesty, there isn't a lemon on this release. As it is with most music, give it a couple chances before discarding it. I'm thankful that I did.
B000002U9E|5.0|I jumped on the Kate Bush bandwagon relatively late, after a chance run-in with \\"Wuthering Heights\\".  That song is great, but, comparatively, the rest of the album it comes from (The Kick Inside) doesn't measure up.  Nonetheless, I'd heard good things about Hounds of Love and decided to give it a chance.  It is easily the best album that I have picked up in the past few years, and probably in my top five CDs of all time.   <br /> <br />Before I get into the particulars of Hounds of Love, though, I should the inevitable comparison with Tori Amos.  I'm not particularly fond of Tori, but I can see how much Kate Bush has influenced her, and, to be honest, several songs MUSICALLY seem similar to some of Tori's stuff.  The real differentiation comes with the lyrics.  Tori is a kook, writing songs using the first stream of consciousness idea that pops into her head.  This ends up making the listener completely apathetic to songs like \\"Silent All These Years\\" or \\"Hey Jupiter,\\" which surfacely sound very pretty and emotional.  On the other hand, Kate Bush has the ability to write universal lyrics that are genuinely emotive and touching, without seeming overdone or trite.  It is this unparalleled talent that makes Hounds of Love so good. <br /> <br />Anyway, Hounds of Love is rife with spirituality and well-rounded ruminations on love and relationships.  Sounds like typical fare, but it's so much more.  From \\"Running Up That Hill,\\" an angry yet reticent song about the singer's inability to change her problems, to \\"Mother Stands to Comfort,\\" the first half beautifully represents a cross-section of the speaker's analysis of how messed up her life is.  Then the second half of the album comes, which chronicles the speaker's near death by drowning.  The album ends with two incredibly beautiful songs (\\"Hello Earth\\" and \\"The Morning Fog\\") which convey the idea that, though we may not accept all of our problems all of the time, you may become more aware of how valuable life is whenever it's nearly stripped from you. <br /> <br />The beauty of Hounds of Love is such a simple idea stands behind it--it's something we've all thought about.  Kate Bush just puts it together so elegantly and beautifully, and I think this is the reason why, as a concept album, it is one of the few I've ever found to be generally moving and thought-provoking.  All in all, you cannot go wrong buying this album--it's pretty much flawless.  (I say \\"nearly\\" because I know tons of people who think \\"Jig of Life\\" is one of the stupidest songs ever recorded.  While I like it, it is quite ambitious and the Celtic thing doesn't really fit on the album thematically, so I can kind of see their point.)
B00003CXTG|1.0|This Movie Was absolutely terible. The basic point of the movie was the same as Titanic. The makers were hoping to make the same billion dollars that the Titanic made World Wide. The love story is that the main character has a girlfriend and than supposibly gets shot down. While he is away his girlfriend gets pregnent to his best friend. Then he shows up alive and hates his best friend till the end of the movie were his best friend gets shot to death. Then he goes and marries his prevoius girlfriend. There is some good cinametagrophy in this movie but that is about all I can give it.
B000127LW2|5.0|With the success of running Star Trek: The Next Generation and Star Trek: Deep Space Nine together and The Next Generation moving on to films...they decided to begin another series.  This series would be different from any other that Star Trek has done before.  The biggest change...Kathryn Janeway!  What?  A female captain?  Yes that's right.  In this series, as part of a spinoff of Deep Space Nine, I suppose, we see the combination of a Starfleet and a Maquis crew.  These two must combine after they get thrown into the Delta Quadrant...70,000 Lightyears from home...70 years from home!  This first season is short as the series did not start until January of 1995.  It's a great start.  The first season gives you just a taste of what the show was going to be all about.  This show added a whole new dimension to Star Trek, and this is only the beginning... <br /> <br />Best Episodes: <br /> <br />Caretaker, Parallax, Time and Again, The Phage, The Cloud Eye of the Needle, State of Flux.
B000000OF6|5.0|No matter if you say this is not the classic rock. The fact is, Queen CREATED a new style in rock. It`s quite unfrequent you find such strength in arrangements and harmonies, such lead voice like Freddie`s, and such sense of future in their compositions.  <br />Sometimes underestimated, history will show Queen has been one of the best groups of all times, and this compilation is a clear proof.
B00005JN7O|1.0|That's the only way I can describe it; both the imagery and the actors seem to have been painted in watercolors, only with too much water and not enough color. As many predicted, the mostly-virtual sets don't provide much inspiration for the actors to, y'know *act*. Instead, the film sort of lurches from one improbable premise to another, with little or no basis in plot or anything resembling logic. <br /> <br />Overall, I haven't seen such a waste of time & money (not to mention pathetic acting) since the \\"Dune\\" remake. Near the end of the movie, our hero is fighting an evil cyborg, and gasps \\"Why won't you die?\\" By that point, I was rooting for the cyborg. 'Nuff said.
B0002XDODU|5.0|I really don't think it's too much different from any other Rammstein albums.....but it still rocks...and this is a band who's done nothing but impress me since day 1 back in 1994 when Herzeleid became available....their music is great and very poetic...and not only that they have one helluva live show and wish they'd come back to the states one time...well, when I'm not deployed anyways..:)....but this cd shouldn't dissapoint fans of the band...and people new to der Stein...this maybe even a good start for you....if you like your industrial metal served with a healthy slab of Deutsch you can't go wrong with Rammstein....this whole cd is great.  ICH LEIBE RAMMSTEIN!
B00005JNEI|5.0|This film had a profound effect on me the first time I saw it. Even though I had read about most of the topics covered in the film, it was shocking, highly disturbing to see, and left me seriously depressed and worried about the fate of our nation. What was perhaps more disturbing than anything in the movie was the fact that a filmmaker was needed to do the job that the media (\\"liberal\\" indeed!) failed to do. Anyone who thinks there were false facts or untruths in this film need only realize that not one single fact presented was disputed by anyone in the Bush administration or the rightwing talking heads.
B0002F6BRE|5.0|The Funniest scene was where Buddy Elf Poured Maple <br />Syrup on his Spaghetti because Christmas Elves eat sweet things <br />ALL the time. <br /> <br />     Also when I saw Gimbels in one scene it brought back memories for The real life Gimbels closed & went out of Business <br />in 1985. <br /> <br />     Again The funniest Christmas movie in years.
B000062YAY|5.0|This 2 disc live set is absolutely killer.  Any big Slayer fan Needs this set.  On disc one, we have most of their classics, Hell awaits, South of Heaven, Raining Blood, Dead Skin Mask, War Ensemble, Seasons in the Abyss, Angel of Death etc.   The second Disc is filled with other great songs that are still great, plus it has Chemical Warfare and Black Magic some all time favorites.  The only thing that most people fail to mention here is that in the Imports, disc two also contains Skeletons of Society and At Dawn They Sleep; two songs that would fit perfectly here.  Some songs shown here sound better then they do on the records, an example would be anything off show no mercy and haunting the chapel, as well as the song Born of Fire (the only song that I feel the urge to skip on the Seasons in the Abyss record).  The packaging is great, and there are no complaints.  Sure Tom's introduction to War Ensemble may seem a little strange, but the pit must have been getting out of control and the concert may have gotten canceled if anyone was seriously hurt.  Wouldn't you warn the audience if you were on stage and if it did happen, you might get sued or worse, or a riot starts or the show might get cancelled by the arena owners or whatever.  I'm also just really ticked off at what the reviewer Slyne said about Tom Araya's vocals and so I'm just going to blow off some steam right now.      \\"The singer - Let's start with the lyrics: a pile of garbage. This guy can't sing, and he's not even convincing. If you want something scary, go listen to Dimmu Borgir, for instance (Same satanic theme, but much more believable).\\" - Slyne    Now for my response.  Are you F***ing Nuts?!  Dimmu Borgir?  Tom's vocals are so much more believable in comparison it's not even funny.  An angry guy yelling is a lot more believable than, a guy making gurgle sounds like a pathetic angry hamster.  See the Dimmu Borgir songs Burn in Hell and Devils Path for proof.  I'm not saying that listening to DimmuBorgir or Cradle of Filth is a bad thing, there is far worse.  I'm just saying that comparing Dimmu Borgir to Slayer just isn't right.  Slayer and Pantera or Morbid Angel or Sepultura, or Vader, or hell, there is so many other bands that make for a better comparison, but because the guy chose Dimmu Borgir it isn't a surprise that he got 2/20 helpful votes.      Well, all in all this 2 disc set is worth every penny.  Tom's voice and bass is great here, the guitars are great(if you notice something Kerry controls one speaker and Jeff will control another, they work together flawlessly), Dave's drumming is phenomenal, and the quality is excellent.  Hoped this helped.
0812968255|5.0|Marcus Aurelius, the emperor-philosopher, ruled the immense Roman Empire from 161 untill 180. He is the last representative of the Stoa. In this book, also known by the name \\"Diaries of M.A.\\", written between 170 and 180 in his army camp, he reflects about his ideals and his doubts. In his meditations one can (constantly) very well distinguish the ideas of a living human being, a man ... ruled by the universe of the divine providence, where all men live as fellow citizens of the gods. With far more warmth than one may expect from a stoic, Marcus Aurelius emphasizes the social \\"duties\\" and the feelings of solidarity that originate of them.<br /><br />Another ever-recurring motive is the personal liberty, freedom of the individual. This is quite normal because ALL DEPENDS on our judgments (in the sense of 'impression') of the circumstances. Very often WE SUFFER FAR MORE OF OUR JUDGMENT of something or of a situation that we consider \\"terrible\\", THAN OF THE SUBJECT ITSELF !! For example a poor constitution (of the body) and other adversities cannot/could NOT HAVE influence our own inner compass...<br /><br />Top of the shelf literature, STRONGLY RECOMMENDED to ALL OF YOU!!
0743200748|3.0|I so wanted to like this book.  I had the right expectation.  I knew it wasn't one of Ambrose's usual war stories.  I didn't expect a lot of psychological jargon either.  I knew that Ambrose was a man's man writing about fathers, brothers, comrades in arms and other fundamentally male relationships.  But I was disappointed.  There was no lesson.  There was little inspiration.  I met several men, great (Eisenhower) and small (Ambrose's brothers), but I really didn't get to know them or learn much from them.  I didn't expect sentimentality, but I expected some meaning, some synthesis, some higher purpose.  But this is just a nice little book about men and with a portrait of the friendships of several famous people interspersed with a few Ambrose family stories.  I like the stories, but I didn't learn much.  What was the father's life lesson he wanted to pass on?  We aren't told.  What is the great secret of male friendships?  There are some hints, but not much.  What can I teach my son about what it means to be a man or how to earn the respect of men?  We have a few tentative conclusions and little that's new.  The reader will enjoy meeting the men in this book, but its all about male bonding.  The deepest lessons are left unsaid.
B00003CXCT|5.0|For me the Return of the Jedi is a masterpiece, worthy of the title of the best Fiction Movie ever.  <br /> <br />A new hope is also a marvelous movie. <br /> <br />If you was a fan of Star Wars, don't wait to buy it, it feel so good to remind all that marvelous scenes that we watch when we were younger. If you haven't seen Star Wars and you like fiction ... you are loosing your time, go and watch this trilogy, this is real emotion .... Lord of the Rings is nothing compared to this.
B00005JMJ4|4.0|\\"Lost in Translation\\" is a perfect vehicle for the kind of deadpan expressionlessnes that Murray assumes in his serious roles. It's more mugging than acting, but in this film, it works. Here, Murray plays Bob Harris, an American has-been actor in a lukewarm marriage, who is sent to Japan to star in a whiskey ad.<br /><br />\\"Lost in Translation\\" depicts the collision of the American and Japanese media cultures, making Hollywood seem tame by comparison. The Japanese, we are asked to believe, love anything Hollywood, whether they recognize the star or not. Along the way, we are treated to an inside view of the Japanese media culture, which is almost repellent in its mania for bright lights, loud music and in-your-face advertising. There's plenty of opportunity for comedy, as Murrray bumps into various people who treat him less as a human being than as a commodity to pampered, partied, posed and paid. Along the way, Murray makes the acquaintance of Charlotte, played by Scarlett Johansenn, the newly married wife of a wannabe director. Their loneliness and isolation gives them a chance to find friendship and perhaps more among the faceless rhythms of Japanese urban life. Their September-May relationship is touching, not altogether predictable, and throws them into new orbits, giving the audience something to ponder at the end of the film.
B0002XH9Z4|5.0|MICHAEL JACKSON IS THE BEST SINGER OUT THERE! This box set is going to be the best Michael Jackson has ever come out with to date. I cant wate to see the DVD and listen to all the songs that were never released to an album and I know there are going to be great. To bad he did not put the song XSCAPE on this cd I heard it the other day and its  AMAZING! <BR>KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK MICHAEL!
0743216458|4.0|Ambrose does a great job of conveying the experience of a single company of the 101st Airborne, from its organization and training in North Carolina all the way through Normanday and to the end of the war.  Along the way Ambrose teaches several lessons about training and operating an airborne unit on a squad, platoon and company level.  Some of these guys were simply studs, some were lucky and many, many were unlucky and wound up dead or maimed.  This small unit focus allows the reader to truly care for the individual soldier, but Ambrose manages to do this without sentimentality or over-dramatizing.  But, similar to Ambrose's other oral history books (D-Day, Citizen Soldiers, Pegasus Bridge), these stories are often told with a lack of larger context or meaning.  That was the experience of the individual paratroopers that this book is about.  They sweat on the training field and bled on the battle field, and they fought primary for themselves.  There is no psychoanalyzing the bond between these brothers in arms, but Ambrose shows us how real it it is.  Perhaps the ultimate lesson of this book is that wars are won by the courage and determination of small units like Easy Company.  For answering the call the duty, we owe them a debt, but they will never call it in.  They fought for each other.
B0002YLC24|3.0|Before Sunset is better than the first. I enjoyed it more maybe because I'm older. The movie is simple, and just relies on banter. The ending totally ruins it and leaves viewers with more.
0395389496|5.0|This is a completely sweet book. A boy who is in danger of losing the spirit of Christmas is visited on Christmas Eve by a magical locomotive. It whisks him (and many others) to the North Pole. The book's artwork alone is worth the price, as is its industrialist's fantasy of Santa's toy-building empire. The sadly sweet story should reconnect any adult with the years of innocent childhood when Christmas Spirit was real, and required nothing more than an open heart and a bright imagination.
B00068IOWM|5.0|I keep reading about people on these reviews hating on Bono.  Bono this, Bono that.  Bono meets with politicians, Bono talks too much.  U2 sold out for the deal they made with Apple and I-tunes (even though no currency was exchanged).   <br />CAN WE JUST STAY WITH THE IMPORTANT THING: THE MUSIC!!!! <br />Vertigo rocks, the album is top notch, all of the personal issues outside of the music is bollox.
B000000132|5.0|In my view the best Renaissance album. It all came together here, Annie Haslem's voice is on top form and the mix of folk rock and the orchestral backdrop works perfectly (and that is some feat if you consider how difficlt it has been to mix the two - aside perhaps the strings on Nick Drake's releases). <br /> <br />Turn of the Cards provides the band with two of it's finest efforts in Running Hard (glorious piano intro) and Mother Russia. I also like 'I think of You' with some great harpsichord supporting Annie's vocal. <br /> <br />Renaissance belong to a vintage crop of British bands including Fairport Convention, Wishbone ash and Pentangle. The question is are they still recording?
B0001KZM3O|2.0|This was one of the first Pink Floyd albums I purchased, and it remais today one of my least favorites.  It lacks the experimentation of the early albums and the orchestrations 70's albums.  Many consider it an extension of the Wall, but I think of it as a series of lesser outtakes from the recording of that landmark album.  Where the Wall was cohesive and flowed along relatively well, this album has a neurotic, depressvie vibe to it that makes it hard to penetrate.  I know many Floyd fans out there will cringe, but I prefer A Momentary Lapse or Reason and the Division Bell to the Final Cut.  Mind you, those post-Waters albums are not great either, by any means (not compared to their 70's classics), but at least I can sit through them.  Water's relentless rants make it difficult to listen to the whole of The Final Cut, with the exception of \\"Keeps your fithy hands....\\" and \\"Two suns...\\".
B000009RC2|5.0|This TRULY is a masterpiece!!!!! This album introduced us to the dynamic combination of John McLaughlin and Billy Cobham. Check out Vital Transformation for some phenomenal drumming and guitar work. Lest I forget, Jan (Miami Vice) Hammer is on keyboards along with Jerry Goodman and Rick Laird. This was the album that really pushed the envelope and combined jazz with rock. This album shows true musicianship at it's best. It's about 34 years old and STILL sounds as fresh and new today as it did back then. If you are a lover of great music and musicianship, this one's for you!!!!
B000002MU3|3.0|I realize that musical tastes are subjective, but I find it hard to believe a reviewer here would suggest that this album is better than \\"Automatic for the People\\".  That album, in my opinion, is one of REM's finest moment (if not THE finest.  AFTP was probably their most varied and creative effort, and boring would be the last word I'd use to describe it.  It would have been hard for any album to follow AFTP, but even so Monster was a bit of a let down.  I remember really liking the first single (\\"What's the frequency...\\"), and being a bit dissapointed by the rest of the CD.  It just drags along a bit.  I don't think it is their worst album, by any mean...and I still put in on my CD player from time to time.  Also, most people would say this album is REM's hardest rocker... but, in my opinion, that honor goes to \\"Life's Rich Pageant\\", which came almost a decade before and is a much better album.  LRP is probably my 2nd or 3rd favorite REM album...and it certainly gets my juices flowing more than Monster.  I recommend it to people that already own REM's best efforts, and want to venture into completing their collection.  But, definetly purchase Automatic for the People, Murmur, Life's Rich Pageant, Out of Time, and Green first.
B00063EMJ6|5.0|If you have never listened to old Neil, this is a good start. Of course there are quite a few titles missing (albums like Zuma and On the Beach are not represented here, so there are not jewels like \\"Cortez the killer\\" or \\"On the beach\\"), but some of the best songs are there. Of course, every fan has some favourites, these are just the most popular songs. The question is: in the age of downloadable songs what is the use of a compilation that any NEil fan can make on his own? Clearly the only possible target for this record is people who never heard Neil Young's albums, and to them I say \\"buy it\\"!
B00008GKEG|5.0|For any diehard Beatles fan like myself this is a must for your collection!  I remember when the Anthology came out on TV..I was so excited and taped all three segments but this DVD collection includes tons of footage that was not in the TV version and you are also presented with a fifth Bonus Disc where Paul, George and Ringo actually jam on \\"Blue Moon of Kentucky\\" and a Paul original..\\"Thinkin' of Linkin'\\"..Great Stuff!  The parts where all three are together remembering the past is the best part!!  You can tell they all loved each other very much and that John was very much missed during these sessions..regardless of the reported acrimony that existed among the bandmembers after their breakup you can't help but feel that these guys were like brothers..they had been so close...that in one interview segment you witness Ringo getting choked up..it's very touching...Many of their concert appearances in the early days performing some of their greatest songs are included on this DVD...many that has never been seen before...One part I loved was when they were being shuttled to their hotel after landing in the US and they were being filmed in the limo with hordes of fans chasing them and a police escort with horses..pretty amazing footage and very clear too!  This documentary was done with a bunch of TLC and comes close to being the best example of how a documentary on a legendary musical group should be done!  Many amazing interviews and the mania is captured wonderfully!  You feel as if you're living it all over again!  This is a must have for any Beatle fan!!

B0002Z9HT8|4.0|Hi <br /> <br />I just bought the 4 dvd case yesterday and i have seen the first 2 dvd already. At this moment, what i can say is that first of all, we need to think, before talking about the songs included or not, and before the quality sound, is about the the real goal of this package: TO HELP PEOPLE. The people that like music and have enough money to buy this dvds, will be very happy to cooperate with the this cause. <br /> <br />I tell you this because the first part of the dvd 1 is quite impressive. It makes you cry, belive me. Youll forget about the concert for a moment. <br /> <br />But then the music starts.... <br /> <br />The audio quality (which is a very important part in any dvd) is not quite good. In other word is acceptable. It reminds me about the knebworth concert. Even in the DTS part. <br /> <br />tha image quality is, again, acceptable. Its in full screen. <br /> <br />There are a lot of songs, a lot of memories comes to my mind hearing and seeing phil collins, u2, sting, elvis costello, sade, elton john, george michael, bryan adams, etc... <br /> <br />I think Bob Geldof did (and still doing) a very very good work helping people. <br /> <br /> <br />Oscar
B0001GF2DS|5.0|The greatest Western from ever [some say Once Upon a Time in the West is better and I can understand why, but I like this movie]is shown in its extended full length version! Fantastic movie and the DVD is great. It's good to get this version because it shows how Sergio Leone really wanted it to be viewed. I highly recommend this DVD for anyone wanting to lie on a couch and watch a fantastic western either with friends or alone.
B00068IOWM|4.0|I don't know about all that, it gets great competition from the likes of Franz Ferdinand \\"Self-Titled\\", Interpol \\"Antics\\", and maybe Velvet Revolver \\"Contraband\\" gets some consideration.  But even if \\"the bomb\\" is or isn't, it still is evidence that U2 have the skills good enough to make great music, which pleases Edge-Clayton-Mullen.  It is also enough for U2 to hold on to the title of biggest band on the planet, which pleases Bono.

B0002KVUKM|1.0|How is the movie Van Helsing like a vampire?  Both are things that have the semblance of life without actually being alive and are much safer unviewed and kept in a box.  How is it like Frankenstein's monster?  They are both monstrosities cobbled together from the bits and pieces of better things.  As you can no doubt can tell, I was not very happy with this movie. <br /> <br />In Van Helsing, the title character is transformed from the cerebral vampire hunter of the novel Dracula into a standard action hero who hunts monsters throughout Europe.  The structure of the film is actually similar to a James Bond movie:  we start with a brief action-filled prologue pitting Van Helsing against Mr. Hyde (who is the same type of Hulk-like monstrosity that was seen last seen in the similarly mediocre League of Extraordinary Gentlemen).  Then Van Helsing is given his mission and given neat weapons from a \\"Q\\"-like character.  Finally, we have the main story pitting Van Helsing against the rather standard villain - Dracula - who wants to take over the world and has a whole bunch of monstrous sidekicks.  Frankenstein and the Wolf Man also fit into this plot. <br /> <br />The movie fails on a number of levels, most significantly from its poor writing.  Sometimes the story is dumb, sometimes it's merely silly, but it's never very interesting.  The acting is nothing to speak of either; Hugh Jackman can play a decent hero (as shown in the X-Men movies), but here he is actually rather boring.  Kate Beckinsdale looks nice, but is also rather dull. <br /> <br />Most importantly, however, is that Van Helsing fails to capture any of the magic of the original Universal monster movies to which it owes so much.  The original movies - released in the 1930s and 1940s - may not all be great (though they are all better than this movie), but at their best, they at least have a nice level of creepiness, even if they can't scare a modern audience.  Van Helsing has none of this eerie quality and ismerely an action movie with slightly off-beat villains. <br /> <br />If you feel the urge to watch this movie, fight it.  Watch one of the original movies instead; I particularly recommend Frankenstein and Bride of Frankenstein.  This movie should be avoided as it will almost certainly disappoint. <br />

B0002Z9HT8|4.0|Positive points : large artist set, many interested songs, editing ok, filming ok, good situational explanation, rare and particular performances from not too visible artists make this set interesting. DVD menu includes a search by artists. Well done packaging, lots of extra including Bowie/Jagger video «dancing in the street». Profits of sales are shared with Live Aid Foundation. Tina Turner and Mike Jagger set is awesome.<br />Negative points : audio is ok but I expected much better because of the importance of the event filmed in 1985 for the TV, the 5.1 digital is weak, better in pcm stereo, these large happennings lack of visual and audio integration, originality and stage look. With the large set of artists, it is likely that many prestations will not have the same interest for each individual. Probably, one will not know all the artists present on this set. May be you will pay for songs that do not interest you.     <br />Overall, a good set interesting from a historical point of view, but do not expect the king of quality (audio, video) as Queen at Wembley, Rolling Stones DVD or others great concerts (Elton John, etc.). Particularly interesting for the music fan. Lots of music for the buck.
B00000JGHM|5.0|I inadvertently ended up watching Michael Mann's 1995 film \\"Heat\\" recently due to a DVD rental mix up. I was trying to get a copy of Burt Reynolds's film of the same name, and got this one instead. A bit miffed at receiving the wrong disc, even though I saw this film a few years ago and knew that it was good, I decided to make the best of a bad situation and just rewatch the thing before sending it back. No sense in wasting a rental charge, eh? After all, it could have been much worse; they might have sent me something like \\"Sex in the City\\" or a Meg Ryan film. Anyway, arguably the most memorable elements of \\"Heat\\" include the pairing up of long time veteran actors Al Pacino and Robert De Niro, and the shoot out in the streets of Los Angeles that eerily foreshadowed a real event several years later. But \\"Heat\\" is much, much more than a vanity project or a footnote in the history of real life American bank robberies. This is a darn good action thriller that still holds up ten years after Mann wrote and directed it. The fact that Michael Mann plans on bringing \\"Miami Vice\\" to the big screen in the next year or so (groan) should in no way diminish what he's accomplished here.<br /><br />The film opens with a smoothly planned armored car robbery orchestrated by master thief Neil McCauley (Robert De Niro). Something goes horribly wrong with the job, though, when one of Neil's underlings guns down a couple of the guards for no reason. Although McCauley doesn't know it at the time, it is this event that spells his ultimate doom. Veteran homicide detective Lieutenant Vincent Hanna (Al Pacino) signs on to the case, and he's a cop's cop, a real go getter that grabs hold of a case with both hands and doesn't let it go until he's got his man. He foregoes everything in his life, his marriage to third wife Justine (Diane Venora) and his relationship to her troubled daughter, to pursue bad guys. Oddly enough, Neil McCauley does the same thing. He's so involved in planning and carrying out his next heist that his personal life is a vacuum. Even when he strikes up a relationship with the pretty Eady (Amy Brenneman), he can't let go of his work. Other characters in the film have the same sorts of problems, especially McCauley's partner Chris Shiherlis (Val Kilmer) and his wife Charlene (Ashley Judd), who quarrel constantly about money and Chris's lifestyle.<br /><br />Hanna eventually discovers that McCauley and his goons are the guys behind the armored car heist, and McCauley learns that Hanna's on his trail at roughly the same time. In order to size his nemesis up, Hanna pulls over Neil on the highway and invites him to a restaurant down the street so the two can talk. It's an interesting scene, probably the best one in the movie, as both men dance around the other trying to get a feel for each other. They each come away from the encounter impressed with the fortitude of the other, recognizing that they both possess the same steely eyed determination to get what they want, but neither man plans on shying away from the coming conflict. That conflict comes when McCauley accepts a job requiring him and his gang to rob a downtown bank. They get out of the building with huge bags of money just fine, but Hanna and his \\"gang\\" of cops are right there to meet them. The resulting gun battle is breathtaking to behold, almost like a ballet of blood and bullets in the streets of Los Angeles. McCauley and Hanna escape the bloodbath to fight to the finish later on when Neil's failure to check his obsessive thirst for revenge leads him right into the detective's hands.<br /><br />The action scenes definitely grab your attention, but they play a minor part in the movie. \\"Heat\\" is all about the performances. It's astonishing to see this many recognizable faces in one film. Jon Voight plays a rough talking, pony tailed advisor to McCauley. Tom Sizemore turns up as one of Neil's reliable colleagues. Wes Studi, who also played a cop in Chris Eyre's \\"Skinwalkers,\\"plays second fiddle to Pacino's detective. Look for Mykelti Williamson, Natalie Portman, Hank Azaria, Henry Rollins, Jeremy Piven, Tone Loc, Xander Berkeley, and Bud Cort in major and minor roles. Wow! I'll bet Mann only had to say, \\"I'm making a film with De Niro and Pacino in it\\" to get people to sign on the dotted line. A few of these characters get their own minor stories that play out underneath the larger Pacino/De Niro confrontation, and Mann integrates them all masterfully. About the only problem I had with the film is that we don't get enough information on Kilmer's character's tumultuous relationship with his wife. We do learn enough to go on, that he's got money problems, but I wanted more.<br /><br />I was a bit disappointed with the extras on the disc, mainly because there weren't any. At least the audio quality sounded great, particularly during that shootout. The gunfire was so loud coming out of my sound system that I'm surprised the neighbors didn't call the cops. The picture quality is good, too. They really ought to release a super duper special edition of this film, a version with commentary tracks, behind the scenes features, and deleted scenes. Clocking in at an impressive three hours, \\"Heat\\" is one of the better action films released by Hollywood in the last twenty years, a film that literally transcends the genre due to its intensive character driven plot. If you haven't seen it, better add it to your list soon.plays second fiddle to Pacino's detective.

B00006G8G1|5.0|Being an old fan that stopped listening to Maiden back in 1985, I had not put much thought into getting this DVD until I recently purchased the remastered Piece of Mind cd for nostalgic reasons.  A perfect album and inspired me to purchase the rest of the pre-LiveAfterDeath catalogue.  So then there's this, Rock in Rio.  I blast in the face and ears assault on my thinking that the band went downhill after 1985.  How wrong I was.  This DVD is a testament to how amazing this band was in the past and is still so today.  Bruce Dickenson's delivery is flawless with all the enigmatic prowess that one expects from a group of this caliber.  Every member of this band displays mind-boggling virtuosity.  Just flat out amazing.  If there are any \\"old\\" fans that abandoned this group at any point, you must get this DVD.  You are most-likely to be re-converted my friends.
B000002H6C|5.0|On \\"...And Justice For All\\" the bay-area thrashers show thier true talent as musicians...the song structures, lyrics, riffs, solos, vocal melodies, and punishing beats make this a thrash album like no other. With trademark Metallica elements are all here. songs starting off with slow acoustic intros leading into powerful, punishing finales. \\"One\\" is this album's \\"Fade To Black,\\" and \\"Sanitarium,\\" packing emotional lyrics into classic thrashy power-ballad. \\"To Live Is To Die\\" would be the equilivent of Ride The Lightning's \\"Call Of Ktulu,\\" and Master Of Puppet's \\"Orion.\\" This is thier little tribute to Cliff, who wrote parts of the song before his tragic death.  <br /> <br />In closing this album is definate classic. Besides it is also thier last album before they went more commercial.....

My three favorite tracks (at the moment) are Miracle Drug, City of Blinding Lights, and Sometimes You Can't Make It On Your Own (a song which I would say is even more beautiful than One).

B000000H3Z|5.0|All other reviewers know what they're talking about, this is the best sepultura album, and is definatly up there with other thrash metal albums.  <br /> <br />Schizophrenia is a great album, but sepultura didn't quite manage it, although after experience with andreas kisser, they produced an almighty album. I can't actually think of a bad song on this album, they're all just so good, from the nice aucostic beginning on beneath the remains to the killer drums on mass hypnosis. Shame sepultura moved onto \\"tribal metal\\" then eventually with max leaving, but this, arise, (and schizophrenia) definatly deserve a place on any thrash mettalers music collection!
0060589272|5.0|In Response to Kosovar in New York:  Sex is merely the vehicle Coelho is using to prove his points and most of them (or at least one of them) isn't/aren't as lewd as you think it is.  Sex is humans' mean to intimacy and \\"oneness\\", either with God or the person you love. <br /> <br />The description of Maria's early sexual exploration in the beginning of the novel wasn't to stir any arousal within us.  If one really understood the intentions of writers, one would know that it was merely blocks in order to build the overall plot and meaning of the book. <br /> <br />People who are disgusted with the highly volatile nature of the sex are like the people who frown down on the same subject in \\"Eleven Minutes\\" like the librarian.  But if one decides to delve deeper into the novel, one realizes that Coelho's usage of sex isn't all about orgies, XXX, or other disgusting activities which only exploit the meaning of sex.  It's about humans' (in this case, woman's) realization of the significance of their inner being, of being able to feel important when the other sex understands our body, and thus understands our soul. <br /> <br />I wish Kosovar would get over his/her difficulties with such things (sex) which because of society and history's oppression, loses its underlying meaning of mankind and their closeness to God.

B0006B29Z2|5.0|Boy, i am exhausted! <br />Last night i decided to view all of the material and it was almost overkill! No, i'm kidding.Could anyone have too much of Early Iron Maiden? I don't think so. <br />The boys did an excellent job of trying to restore audio and images from their jurassic and ominous past.But certainly you only can do so much with the source material.In the Rainbow concert there is a constant hizz throughout the show.And in the show at Ruskin Arms (recorded like a bootleg, with only one camera)the audio even colapses for a few seconds and goes to \\"mute\\" during After Life song. <br />But this material will nonetheless be aprecciated by fans of Iron Maiden from all over the world.And the documentaries on disc two are full of surprises and gives fully context about what it was like back then (early 80's) to listen to something so imaginative and complex as Iron Maiden music was. <br />The highlight of the documentals is The Early Days, shot recently with a vast array of colorful characters.12 Wasted Years is masterful insight but this is just plain profound and detailed stuff.You have more time and dialog to understand the most inner feelings of pretty much everyone involved at certain point with Iron (although Derek Riggs is sadly not here giving his opinions and recollections of the past.It is here only for a few seconds from footage of 12 Wasted Years).The recollections are vivid, candid and not overly self indulgent. <br />Bottom line: a treasure.The fact that there is plenty of material to come that - hopefully - will be given the same detailed approach it makes me drool in anxiety! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B00005JMUL|5.0|This is one of the most beautiful , wondrous, inspiring and lovely movies to come along in quite some time--and a movie that ALL AGES will enjoy to boot! <br /> <br />The color palette is awesome--Vivid colors and activity--state of the art TGI animation--the irises of the eye are completely realistic on the close-ups. The book really comes to life.  Incredible! <br /> <br />This movie is a lovely tale of several children, who aren't quite sure they believe in Santa anymore. They make a trip to the North pole that is a magical and wonderful adventure.  They learn friendship, love, leadership and belief along the journey.  The last several lines of the movie says it all.  I won't spoil the mood of the movie by telling you those lines. <br /> <br />My heart was touched, inspired, filled with happiness, etc. by the end of this movie.  My children, ages 12 to 28, also LOVED it.  It is destined to become a modern classic!! Truly a delight for ALL--no matter what your age....and shouldn't be missed by any age.  Take grandma, grandpa, kids, teens, young adults and yourselves...and enjoy this special Holiday treat!!!  GO SEE THIS INCREDIBLE MOVIE--THE POLAR EXPRESS!!!
B000669GAI|5.0|I love all of these reviews which seem to be testimonials as to the degree of one's loyalty to the band.  There is a lot of passion in the Pearl Jam fanbase and a lot of discussion around whether such an album should exist.  I think this album is great.  Here is my review... <br /> <br />SONG SOURCES/DISTRIBUTION <br /> <br />Here is the distribution of songs by album... Ten(5), Vs.(6), Vitalogy(6), No Code(3), Yield(3), Binaural(2), Riot Act(2), From singles-not on an album (3), From movie soundtracks (3). <br /> <br />SONGS THAT WERE (RADIO) HITS NOT INCLUDED <br /> <br />Glorified G (Vs.) <br />Rats (Vs.) <br />Tremor Christ (Vitalogy) <br />Smile (No Code) <br />In Hiding (Yield) <br /> <br />SONGS I AS A FAN WISHED WERE INCLUDED IN ADDITION TO EXCLUDED RADIO HITS <br /> <br />In My Tree (No Code) <br /> <br />VERSIONS DIFFERENT THAN ON THE ALBUM <br /> <br />Once, Alive and Black come with an asterisk stating they were remixed by Brendan O'Brian.  I found them to be clearer and slightly more raw sounding.  Like the difference between the Lost Dogs version of \\"Alone\\" as compared to the B-side version.  Very slight difference from the original in my opinion.  Some of the alteration in Lost Dogs versions of songs were drastic as compared to this. <br /> <br />Evenflow is an entirely different take.  Another reviewer said it was the music video version.  This is not a re-mix, an entirely different recording.  Sounds live from a studio.  Similar in recording style to Zeppelin's \\"I can't quit you\\" from the Coda album. <br /> <br />State of Love and Trust is the most radically changed song.  Delay added to the backup vocals, echo added to the guitar solos, vocals more pronounced and forward, mixed louder and clearer.  In my opinion, long needed change.  The singles soundtrack recordings were not good recordings and this clears it up. <br /> <br />Breath was mixed louder and clearer as it was lower and muddier on the original. <br /> <br />Yellow Ledbetter was cut short on the final note in Lost Dogs.  Fixed on this album. <br /> <br />SOUND QUALITY <br /> <br />Very good and consistent.  The risk you run with a 13 year span of hits put on an album is having hiss on some songs, not others, different recording levels, etc.  This doesn't occur on this collection. <br /> <br />OPINION AND OBSERVATIONS <br /> <br />I think this is a perfect collection.  The distribution follows radio hits from the earlier albums, and contains what were released as singles from the later albums.  Collectors get cleaned up and some different versions.  Casual fans get 30+ great tracks.  People who bought Ten and Vs. and then lost interest get to see great things Pearl Jam has done since and may want to get reacquainted.  Separating hard rock (disk 1) and softer (disk 2) is good for parties, moods, etc.  Put it in and play! <br /> <br />A great companion to this is \\"Lost Dogs\\".  Fame freaked out the bandmembers and in later years, they decided to manage it by not putting catchy hooks in some songs, excluding songs that were obvious hits, not doing videos, keeping out of the news, etc.  Lost Dogs has some of these songs.  For example, if \\"Sad\\" would have been included in Binaural originally, I bet it would have been included as one of the greatest of hits on this album now.  Lost Dogs also has B-sides, Xmas singles, soundtrack songs, and a bone chilling tribute to the late Layne Staley.  <br /> <br />The thing \\"tweaking\\" me right now is when a song is over, I start playing the next one, from the original album, in my head, but an entirely different song plays instead.  I'll survive.  Enjoy this one!
B00000JNOJ|4.0|I feel a little guilty rating this a \\"4 star\\" album....but let me explain why. It is the extra tracks & the way they are so disjointed from the first 9 that originally comprised the whole album. If they were seperate....each piece would have the full 5 stars. Continuity is an important element of any great album. That being said, simply programming songs 1-9 and listening to them on their own merit willl BLOW YOUR SOCKS OFF! Incredible to hear Buddy Guy learn from the master. No wonder he became king of the blues himself! Enjoy!
B00003CX8Y|5.0|Beauty and the Beast is THE best disney. Well it's surely in the top 3. The only way to make this film better is to re-release it and jam pack it with amazing features. I think that Diseny has done a great job with this. <br />The story centers around Belle, the 'crazy inventors' daughter and an outcast in in small french town. She then meets the beast who was transformed beause of his shallowness, and needs to fall in love and win love in return in order to become human again. Unlike any other classic Disney film, this is not love at first sight, and after techincally kidnapping Belle the two become friends. The rest of the story ends with them falling in love despite Gaston's attempts to keep them apart and win Belle as his 'trophy wife'. One of the things I like about this film is that its the most magical film, the spells and enchanted castle help childen to love this film even more. Its a musical at its finest and has many Oscar and Golden Globe nominated songs.  <br />The dvd is of course way better quality than the Vhs, but is way more than just different quality. It is restored so that it can be seen in it's original quality, the way it shoud be. The songs are better, so is the colour and the overall proudct. It also features a new sequence, fully restored and animated. I really liked 'Human again' and am really glad that it's on the Dvd. The other special features are various triva, games and making's of, but the real novelty is to have it on the 2-disc special edition. Having only brought a Dvd player 4 months ago, this was the first I brought, and it is now out of print as Disney only keeps the special editions circulating for about 3-4 months. The others (for refrence) are; Snow White, Sleeping Beauty, Aladdin, The Lion King and very shortly Pocahontas and Mulan. <br />If you like disney and fairytales, then this is your sort of thing. This would appeal to anyone as this film has so many levels. Its a must see no matter who you are.
B0000062GE|5.0|This is the only review I have ever written online, and the only review I probably ever will write.  This is the best record ever created.  In my personal opinion, all paths in music through time are either leading up to the recording of this album, or degenerating into vacuousness since this album.  Though I consider myself a larger fan of neoclassical music like Holst and Stravinsky more than anything else, and then Tool is certainly my favorite band still together today, I believe that Stabbing Westward hit the goldmine on this album.  Their other three albums don't hold my attention as much.   <br /> <br />EVERY SONG on this CD is AMAZING.  I write screenplays, and I choreographed an entire movie to this album (with some dead space of course for dialogue and stuff).   <br /> <br />Vicious, tattered, dark dark dark dark dark, explosive, brooding, pathetic, violent, self-depracating... <br /> <br />Perfectly paced, episodic... <br /> <br />Perfect blend of synth and metal... <br /> <br />I want everything I write to sound like this album.
B00068IOWM|4.0|I read recently that the Edge basically begins all the creation of u2's music with his guitar work and then Larry and Adam come in and do their part, and then Bono comes in and does the vocals and lyrics to the music.  So that's probably why there were rumors this would be a harder sounding u2 album, but I'm guessing Bono came in and changed all that with his quest for his band to stay the most popular in the world.  There are many catchy choruses, sing a long verses, and universal ballads like SYCMIOYO which will be huge hits with fans and once again keep u2 in the mainstream while keeping their credibility.  Luckily, there are a great band and they pull it off greatly, as this is one very solid record, my people.     <br /> <br />Luckily, u2 are a strong democracy, and every member has their  say. I still think u2 are at their best when experimenting, and there is some experimentation with this album.  L&P or Else has some unique industrial sounds we've never heard from the Irish boys, and AMAAW is basically the band doing a R&B version of a Stones song.  People can say this is just a pop song, but 1)that's totally wrong and you have to appreciate u2 taking a step in another direction and 2)bass lines don't sound this good on pop songs.  Still, two of some of the best songs I've heard this year from the band didn't make the cut, \\"Fast Cars\\" and \\"Mercy\\".  The former is absolutely stunning, it is so out there for u2 and sounds like a young energetic band right out Turkey with it's arabic sounds.  The latter was so exciting to hear because it sounds like it was ripped right off of Achtung Baby, it seriously could have been a single.  And it didn't make the cut?? <br /> <br />But despite my gripes with the album's sometimes habit of being too constructed or forced, in the end its a fine piece of work.  MD is a great song with a killler solo by Edge, same with ABOY.  The whole first side of the album is classic u2, the second half is still growing on me but there are good tunes in there.   <br /> <br />It's time for u2 to start making bad records, they're all in their mid-40s and history says they will.  But they keep their habit of trying to be the best band in the world, and succeeding.  But while their at, here's to another experimental phase.  Go make another Zooropa on tour FELLAS! <br />
076790592X|5.0|Im 16 and a friend of mine died recently in a tragic car accident and I thought that reading a book like this would help me to maybe have a better understanding of death. I got a lot out of Tuesdays with Morrie, and it has inspired me not to fall into comformity, to always remember what is important, and to have a life full of meaning. The last two chapters I cried, a lot. Very sad book... <br /> <br />I decided, from reading this book that I want to be a great teacher like Morrie was.  <br />\\"A teacher affects eternity; he can never tell where his influence stops.\\" <br />Henry Brooks Adams
B00069YDXU|4.0|The pace is a little slower, but the technicality  and timing are still  there. This is a crystal clear DVD, that has great sound. <br />From beginning to end, ELP demonstrate the superior musicians that they are. The audience seems spellbound at times, and who wouldn't be ? <br />A great addition to any  ELP fan's collection, and great entertainment for  anyone else interested in the Prog Rock genre.
B0002Z0EYK|5.0|I found this film so touching. I'm Greek and although bits were left out (like the reason Achilles died was because his mother dipped him in the immortal pool as a baby but didn't dip his ankle- hence when Paris shot the arrow there) and he died. But I was surprised to find that, although the main lovers are Paris and Helen, not much was mentioned of the Archilles and Perseas love story. I found that so sweet and much more beautiful to watch! Definate must have!
B00005JNEI|5.0|A lot of people who criticize this film do so claiming it's biased and not a documentary. Moore stated in interviews from the outset that his intention was to motivate people to vote against Bush. I wonder if the same people who criticize the film are concerned that Bush was re-elected, in part, for the belief he'd select conservative nominees to the Supreme Court. Like Pascal's Wager, what the \\"right\\" fails to realize is that if their beliefs are wrong, a lot more suffering and needless restrictions on human rights occur that wouldn't have occurred had the \\"left\\" agenda been realized and been in error.* Likewise, I ask in relation to the film, what's worse?: A film that masquerades as documentary (when the ideal is to be unbiased) or a pre-judiced supreme court nominee who will masquerade as judge?    *These comments are assuming that fetuses don't suffer (and there's no credible evidence that the contrary is logically possible. Even \\"pro-fetus\\" people don't deny this. If they did, they would be hassling scientific labs rather than judicial chambers and the political process).
B00061QJZI|4.0|The problem with critics is that they're looking for a deep movie.  Of course Anchorman is a stupid movie.  Of course there aren't any deep themes.  This is, after all, a Will Farrell comedy.  I laughed the whole way through.  Will Farrell is much funnier than Vince Vaughn and Ben Stiller (Dodgeball, by the way, was more popular for some reason, but also less funny).  Plus, I think everyone will laugh at Steve Carrell's portrayal of the \\"special\\" weatherman.  I will admit that Christina Applegate was not that great and the ending scenes just kind of rambled and werent as funny as the rest of the movie (kind of like in Elf).   <br />In short, if you want a deep movie, go somewhere else.  If you wanna laugh all the way through, see Anchorman.
0446310786|5.0|The book begins with an observation from Charles Lamb that lawyers were children too.  Since its publication date in 1960, this novel has lost none of its popularity.  Atticus Finch, a lawyer, is the narrator's father.  Maycomb is a tired old town.  The family lives on the main residential street.      When Scout is six and her brother Jem is ten, a playmate, Dill, age seven, appears.  He is visiting his aunt for the summer.  Calpurnia, a servant, structures the children's days.  The children are fascinated by the Radley place.  I will not disclose the plot importance of the Radley connection in order to preserve the suspense for the reader.  The description of an Alabama childhood during the Great Depression is priceless.  It is no wonder this one book author could not repeat her achievement when, on the first try, she produced a masterpiece.      At school Jem and Scout are subject to a progressive, John Dewey-style education.  (Amusingly, Jem confuses the new plan with the Dewey decimal system.)  Atticus has to teach Scout the meaning of compromise as she attempts to understand and participate in the confusing world of the first grade. Scout thinks that laughter is coming from the Radley house.  The children believe that Arthur \\"Boo\\" Radley, a former resident of the insane asylum,  lives in the house.  They ask a neighbor, Miss Maudie, if Boo is dead, and she says no.  Atticus tells the children to stop tormenting the man.      The children start to find chewing gum in a knot in a tree on the Radley property.  Later they find a watch and a spelling bee medal in the knot hole, and still later the hole is filled with cement by somebody. Scout hears from a relative that her best friend Dill just gets passed around and does not have a home.  (Truman Capote claimed that he was the model for Dill, and indeed, circumstances of his childhood match the attributes of the character.) In one scene there is a deserted waiting street and a mad dog.  Calpurnia has an alert telephoned to everyone through  Maycomb's telephone operator.  Since the Radleys do not have a telephone, she yells in the direction of the Radley house for the Radleys to stay indoors, too.  In the evolution of this episode, Scout learns that Atticus is a crack shot.      There is a caste system in Maycomb.  Scout's father is handling an unpopular case.  Someone is accused of rape and Scout does not know of what the factors in the crime are.   Atticus sits in front of the jail guarding the life of his client.  A mob went to his yard earlier.  Atticus has a crowd of sullen people surrounding him at the jail.  Scout's conversation with one of the members of the crowd causes the crowd to disperse.  Atticus later cautions the children that a mob in every little southern town is always made up of people, regular people. The trial attracts  numerous spectators.  When the jury convicts an innocent man, Scout and Jem and Dill are shocked.  The man dies in a jail break.      A wonderful feature of the book is that the story is told from a child's perspective.  In addition, the rich oral culture of the region is evident in the book's pages.
B0002XH9Z4|5.0|Michael Jackson is not a freak...though many bashers want to stress this false statement. However, I agree with that one reviewer who explained that 1 or 2 people keep coming back to trash this album. Case and point: A reviewer came back to add to his review in a direct response to us divulging his secret. Sad.  <br /> <br />Amazon.com is a place where you can review an album that you have bought, or heard thouroughly. If there are reviews talking about his personal fortune, his personal life, and his extortion case, they obvioulsy have no substance or ground to write review on. Talking about his personal fortune, he maintains over a half billion dollar personal wealth fortune. As gullable as people are, they actually beleive he is in debt like Fox New's Roger Friedman says...but the truth...no. Fact: He owns his catalog now and the Beatles. <br /> <br />Talking about the music now: <br /> <br />The best stand out tracks are Scared of the Moon: A dark ballad. We've Had Enough is a clear anti-war song. Though it doesn't bash our current president, it does make clear that there are many people dying. \\"Love was taken, from a young life, and no one told her why...her direction, was a dimlight from one more violent crime....she gave a silly question why, why her father had to die, she asked the men in blue, how is that you get to choose, who will live and who will die......\\" Very personal and yet a strong message. Fall Again and Beautiful girl are beatuiful ballads. In The Back is a demo with a catchy beat. <br /> <br />Sunset Driver is a great song that should have been released ealier. Cheater, the first single, is a great rock song that sounds a bit like Mick Jagger. State of Shock is a duet with Mick Jagger. Someone Put Your Hand Out is one the best songs, though it wasn't released into the mainstream public until NOW!  <br /> <br />This is the great collection that spans a long time! Box sets don't historically sale well, but I have a feeling this is going to go through the roof. 3 cheers for the King of Pop!
B0002YLC24|5.0|When Celine and Jesse meet again in Paris we can't help but wonder about the meeting they originally planned. After the first movie I was more prepared for the mesmerizing experience.<br /><br />With pomegranate in hand (a good substitute for popcorn), I watched with a sense of anticipatory wonder. Would these two ever connect on more than a soul level, did they connect before and would this continuing conversation lead to some mutual fulfillment? I was not disappointed.<br /><br />The playful banter reaches some humorous high points that are beyond witty. Celine and Jesse seem to share a natural chemistry, which allows them to speak honestly without fear of rejection. Together they find a delicate balance of revelation and anticipation.<br /><br />What amazed me most is the extended scenes filled with complex conversations. The entire plot truly happens more in the characters minds than onscreen. The casual natural sets are still magical, but I think the best scene is in the first movie when Celine and Jesse are kissing under the stars. The ending of this movie has to be in my top 10 of inspiring movie endings. There is a taste of the future and enough uncertainty to intrigue long after this movie has ended.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review
B0001LJC2K|5.0|Matthew Cooke, who reviewed this album and called it \\"unoriginal\\" must be deaf. This album is highly original and exciting. Muse is that rare band that can fuse rock, beautiful melodies, haunting classical piano, string arrangements and grand theatrics to create something spectacular and completely enjoyable. <br />All of their albums are great but Absolution is Muse at its tightest! Matt Bellamy's voice is clear, strong and can reach unbelievable notes. Muse pulls off a cd that seriously rocks and their emotional lyrics add depth and power to each song. <br />Forget the Radiohead comparisons, these guys are in a league of their own. <br />Plus, don't miss their tour for this album...no one beats them live! <br />
B00002E224|5.0|In a world where characters seem to cautiously approach a tentative friendship before diving into an impulsive romantic relationship, it is almost refreshing to see both happening at once. From the moment American Jesse meets the luminous French Celine there is a soul connection that defies definition.<br /><br />At first, Celine seems to overwhelm Jesse with her intellectual wanderings and yet she playfully allows him to tease her. The chemistry is phenomenal and the sheer beauty of various scenes made me realize how the simplicity of the settings actually enhanced the emotional aspects.<br /><br />Throughout the entire movie you never feel that you are on the outside looking in, although I think that is the underlying attraction. I was so mesmerized by the script I felt I became each character as they were speaking. This is bliss for anyone who loves the sheer honesty of life itself. Jesse and Celine delve into philosophy, creatively describe their first romantic feelings and enjoy a spontaneous merging of the minds.<br /><br />When they meet on a train heading to Vienna, neither imagine they will encounter a reality that is better than any fantasy. There is a sweet innocence pervading this entire movie with an underlying erotic tension that never seems to find complete fulfillment on screen. While the ending of this movie is more melancholy, the ending of Before Sunset is more than delicious.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review
B000002UAU|5.0|In the (at this date) 100+ reviews I've done, I've never reviewed anything from the Beatles at all, even though they're one of my favorite bands. I decided to change that with the album often associated with the \\"summer of love\\" in 1967.<br /><br />It's pretty timeless, to be honest. I see this is a transitional album in their catalogue -- where they fully turned from a 50's inspired pop/oldies rock band into a classic rock band -- completing the change started in REVOLVER. It's not quite their best (that would go to the WHITE ALBUM), but I'd consider it their second best.<br /><br />1. The \\"live\\" sung, rocking title track opens with that famous guitar riff, and tells the story of the fictional band, Sgt. Peppers. Before long, it segues into the next track (sung by \\"Billy Shears,\\" which is technically the same song)...<br /><br />2. With a Little Help from my Friends -- ...which is really sung by Ringo. Though it's his only lead vocal here, he does a great job, as usual. More of a medium paced, pleasant pop/rocker that was thought to have drug references back in the day, though it's really just about him being with his friends, as opposed to in a relationship.<br /><br />3. Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds -- This is another semi controversial song, thought to be about LSD. In fact, it was John singing about his son, [future 80's pop/rock star] Julian's drawing. It alternates from a semi ballad on the verses to a \\"trippy\\" psychedelic pop/rocker on the choruses.<br /><br />4. Getting Better -- This catchy, melodic classic rocker sung by Paul is one of their most underrated ever - talking about various events in his life, and how it's improving since then.<br /><br />5. Fixing a Hole -- A medium tempo, more unique and strange (but still great!) song which sounds like it was inspired by early 20th century pop.<br /><br />6. She's Leaving Home -- This orchestrated pop ballad is probably one of their most depressing songs ever (it's still good, just sad-sounding). Lyrically, it's about (what sounds like) a woman who suddenly decides to get up and run away from her life and family - told from their POV.<br /><br />7. Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite -- Another of the \\"unique\\" songs. If MTV had existed back then, I could easily see a video set in a peaceful, European carnival in the daytime. Not surprising, since some of the lyrics were actually inspired by a 19th century carnival.<br /><br />8. Within You Without You -- This mid tempo, middle-eastern tune is sung by George (inspired by his then recent trips to India - and it shows). It's almost completely done on a sitar and other similar-sounding instruments (even the \\"drums\\"). It might be strange, but it's good.<br /><br />9. When I'm 64 -- Paul kicks things back into more typical pop/rock mode here, with this more humorous look on his own aging. It also has a little bit of an old time/vaudeville influence, and is kinda ironic today, since he's only got a few years until he actually is 64. However, I think he's aged better than his 1967 self feared, LOL.<br /><br />10. Lovely Rita -- This is a pretty, mid paced \\"BritPop\\" sounding rocker about a meter maid named Rita whom Paul falls in love with.<br /><br />11. Good Morning -- John takes on this happy pop/rocker, talking about a typical day in the life (pardon the pun), with a slightly hard rock guitar solo, and animal sound effects on the fade-out.<br /><br />12. The reprise of the title track is a somewhat faster-paced (and short) version, with only a few lyrics. It soon fades into...<br /><br />13. A Day in the Life -- ...which starts as a mellower, mid tempo pop/rocker, featuring a pretty accoustic guitar. Some of the ominous lyrics even helped fuel the \\"Paul is Dead\\" rumors back in the day (i.e. \\"he blew his mind out in a car\\"). Midway through, it almost becomes another song - a short, faster-paced rocker - before turning back into its earlier sound. Soon after, it builds up to the infamous, longest ending note in the history ofrock.:)<br /><br />All in all, I think the variety here - as contrasting as it may be - makes it that much more enjoyable. Songs like the two title tracks (and their accompanying follow-ups) sound alot like what we now call classic rock. \\"Getting Better\\" and \\"Good Morning\\" sound like a template to 70's and 80's rock styles. \\"Lucy...\\" and \\"Within You\\" sound more of their time, and some of the others are more unique.<br /><br />Find me a rap, boy band, or (the now bland genre of) pop/punk (with 16-song, mostly soundalike CD's) album with this much variety today, that all flows so well.nding note in the history of rock.:) <br /> <br />All in all, I think the variety here - as contrasting as it may be - makes it that much more enjoyable.

B00003CXGG|4.0|Without the pairing of Aaliyah and Jet, \\"Romeo Must Die\\" would be a typical Joel Silver action flick - great stunts, lots of hip-hop, interesting effects, and convoluted plot about rival gangs. Instead, this movie is special, and it's worth a second look.  <br /> <br />Aaliyah was a geniunely sweet performer, and it shows in every scene. Watching her now, and knowing the details of her tragedy all too well, I can't help but wonder if she would have matured into an household name ala Beyonce, as she certainly had the looks, personality, and talent. She and Jet Li have good, believable chemistry. As for Jet's performance, this is one of his better English-language acting jobs. Unlike most martial artists, Jet tries to offer different performances in each film, and doesn't shy away from enhancing his skills with wires and special effects. You'll either love him or hate him for this decision, but it's hard not to admire the razzle-dazzle of his artifically enhanced kung fu. Despite the gritty hip-hop and r&b on the soundtrack, this isn't even a remotely realistic film, so why not just kick back and enjoy the magic?
B00005K9LK|4.0|Though they had been around since the early 70's, heavy metal band Judas Priest didn't see any mainstream success until the start of the 80's, and the New Wave of British Heavy Metal (NWOBHM) movement, lead by JP and similar bands like Iron Maiden, Saxon, Ozzy Osbourne and even early Def Leppard.<br /><br />Stylistically, this would fall somewhere inbetween the pop/metal trend of bands like Bon Jovi and Poison (even containing traces of the arena rock catchiness in bands like Foreigner, Asia, or Journey, but alot harder), and thrash metallers like Megadeth and early Metallica. Musically speaking, it was closer to the former: catchier and slightly less \\"headbanging\\" -- no matter how heavy they were, they never lost their sense of musicianship and melody. Yet imagewise, they were closer to the latter. Especially with bands such as them being accused of their \\"supposed\\" devil-worshipping and the general lyrical content.<br /><br />With 1980's BRITISH STEEL, Judas Priest became somewhat well-known, but this album from 1982 really introduced them to the mainstream (comparitively speaking).<br /><br />1. The Hellion -- The opener is a 40-second, pleasant yet heavy electric guitar instrumental intro to...<br /><br />2. ...the small time hit \\"Electric Eye,\\" a synth metal masterpiece. Lyrically it seems to be not unlike a heavy metal version of \\"Eye in the Sky\\" from Alan Parsons Project.<br /><br />3. Riding on the Wind -- Starting out with a speedy, crashing drum solo, this accurately gives you a feel for the song in general. Rob Halford's high-pitched screeching vocals are at their all-time best here. Though it's played at 100 MPH (with a catchy guitar solo to boot!), it's still very melodic with a slight pop sound.<br /><br />4. Bloodstone -- Not one of the better songs, but not bad by any means. Sounds a bit like something they'd have done a few years earlier. It definitely has a 70's hard classic rock/metal sound, but it's not as \\"exciting\\" as the previous two songs.<br /><br />5. Take These Chains -- Okay, I know some people probably loathe this, but it's one of my personal favorites. Starting out soft, it soon becomes a more medium-paced love song, but it's still guitar based, and retains the feel of the rest of the album. Simply put, if Judas Priest (instead of Bon Jovi and Whitesnake) had made pop/metal go mainstream, this is probably how most \\"love\\" songs would sound.<br /><br />6. Pain & Pleasure -- Another mid tempo classic rock-ish tune (in the vein of, say, Foghat), this one is a little heavier with a definite \\"grooving\\" feel to it. It's almost a combo of the two previous songs, both musically and lyrically, but comes off as a bit of a bore to me.<br /><br />7. The title track is easily the fastest and hardest of the 10 tracks. Rob screeches his way through this. Though it's not what I'd call as having \\"repeat play quality\\" (the verses and choruses are sung almost identically), the 80's sounding backbeat and (melodically) thrash-like quality to it makes it unique.<br /><br />8. You Got Another Thing Comin' -- The band's only real \\"hit\\" emerges with this Journey meets Iron Maiden arena metal anthem. Though there's clearly some pop thrown in here, it's not something that pure metalheads will be turned off by. Sung in a more straightforward 80's arena rock way, it's extremely catchy (especially the bridge and guitar solo!).<br /><br />9. Fever -- The last two songs drop off in quality a teeny bit, but still are great. This is probably the least heavy thing on the album. Starting out very ballad-ish with an accoustic guitar and a softer variation on Rob's voice, it becomes a somewhat mellow medium tempo pop/metal rocker Ozzy could've done on his first two albums.<br /><br />10. Devil's Child -- This gets heavier again, with Rob also going back to his trademark screech. Not unlike the style of \\"Another Thing\\" and some of the more mainstream hits. This time around, it's not quite as catchy or memorable, but the guitar solo pushes it above average.<br /><br />All in all, I'd say this is the strongest overall JP solo album. Their next release, 1984's DEFENDERS OF THE FAITH would be somewhat in this style, but a little darker less poppy.but the guitar solo pushes it above average. <br /> <br />All in all, I'd say this is the strongest overall JP solo album.

B0002Z0EYK|5.0|I already reviewed this movie but i forgot to mention it needed a hotter girl.  Helen was ok but not beautiful.  Like they said in Mad Magazine of September 2004.  Her face isnt nice enough to launch a thousand ships.  No I'd say maybe 184 ships.  Yeah that sounds right.   <br /> <br />FYI  the girl in the tv miniseries Helen of Troy was WAY better looking.  Shes also in Resident Evil Apocalypse.!!

B0002F6BRE|5.0|This is a film for families.  If you like a typical Will Ferrel movie THIS is NOT IT!!! <br />This is actually a good movie.  Not to offend Will, he makes great movies but there kinda repetative.  This was special.  In summary this is a great movie for the whole family to enjoy. <br />
B000021XS0|5.0|Dream Theater is my favorite band, and this is one of my favorite albums.  The cool thing about this album is that it hase a story line, which I think is about someone who seeks therapy because his daughter was murdered, and the CD goes through his memory.  Either way, I thought this was an amazing album, and has some of the best DT songs on it. <br /> <br />To understand this album though, you have to get the whole album, you can't buy the songs off the internet.  I listened to the whole CD through once, and all the songs kind of link together. <br /> <br />If you are new to Dream Theater, get Images and Words first. YOu have to listen to Metropolis, Part I, because alot of themes reappear in this album. <br /> <br />Another great thing about this CD, as with all their CDs, is that they play whatever notes and rythms sound the best, without worrying about the time signature, or key signature. Dance of Eternity probably could have been improved though. I thought some of the linking parts, that linked one section to another didn't really build up as well as they could have. If you want to see the best version of Dance of Eternity ever, get Live at Budokan and listen to Instrumedley. <br /> <br />Anyway, awesome album, I would get it, but get Images and Words first.
B0000024UO|5.0|Johnny Winter's debut album will BLOW YOUR MIND. He's in already in my top ten best guitarists ever. His blues licks, speed and style are great. My favorite song on the album is \\"Be Careful With a Fool\\" because of its lightning fast licks and my next favorite is \\"Dallas\\" which is a has Johnny playing a great raw, rough and gritty sound the way the old blues were played. It features him on his National guitar. But his best version of \\"Good Morning Little School Girl\\" is not on this album but on \\"Johnny Winter And Live\\". \\"Drown in my own tears\\" shows his vocal talents and his ability to be able to handle slowing things down a little. This is an essential album for any TRUE blues or guitar fan. ALSO, any of you who like the blues should ignore this screwball bill smith, who should stay away from this kind of music and stick to his Kiss crap.
B0000CDLA7|4.0|First of all, it's Dream Theater, and everything they make is awesome. <br /> <br />Some of these people that are \\"giving up on Dream Theater\\" I don't think really understand what Dream Theater is all about. Throughout they're 15 year history they have never made an album that sounded the same as another album, and this one is no exception. The difference with this album, is that it is a different kind of music. <br /> <br />This album was much heavier.  Because of this, many people have said that it sounds like stuff other bands are playing. That's completely not true, nothing I've ever heard sounds like this album. <br /> <br />What I don't like about this album is a little complicated, and you might disagree. These songs all kind of have an angry kind of feel, and is usually the kind of feel coupled with rebellion, and I felt like the anger wasn't really directed effectively to attempt change somehow, which I usually like, although a lot of people don't, so this is just my oppinion. <br /> <br />There are two songs that kind of ruined this album for me.  One is Honor Thy Father. I have always known Dream Theater to be a band that wouldn't write a whole song based on anger towards one person.  They would always broaden this sort of theme so it would speak to the listeners. <br />The other song was In the Name of God. I thought this song could have been so much better. John Petrucci's lyrics (who I think writes the best lyrics generally) basically just stated the obvious, and the things he discussed are never going to change, so why bother? It was basically attacking radical religious terrorists, cults, and other obvious misusers of faith, and didn't really introduce anything new. <br /> <br />My favorite songs on this album are As I Am (even though it is simple), Endless Sacrifice, and Stream of Consciousness. <br />All in all, this album was a little bit experimental, and in all fairness, these songs ROCK in concert, so keep in mind they were made for live performances. But if you are getting you're first or second Dream Theater album, I would get Images and Words, or Scenes from a Memory.
B00068IOWM|5.0|I'm in high school and most of the kids in my class dont listen to u2, probably because they think its unhip to listen to a bunch of old guys play rock n roll.  But I got a copy of the new album from out of all people, my dad!! I never thought I'd be saying that...I might be moshing to VERTIGO with my pops at the next u2 concert.  Ya, that will ever happen.  Anyway, this is a really cool cd, I love Original Species and Sometimes You Can't Make it on your own.  But ahhh....City of Blinding Lights.  that's an awesome song, it reminds me of their old song Where the Streets Have No Name but better.   Will u2 fans kill me for saying that? Anyway, I love their new album, even if my friends don't.  They can listen to all the bubble gum pop they want, Ill jam to these guys and my boys the Killers.  They know they can't dance but at least they know (wink_) <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
0920668372|1.0|My 6 yr old son had this book read to him in Kindergarten. He came home crying and asking me questions about when I'm going to die, and how all that works. It was entirely too much for him at his age. He was so negatively affected, I had to ask the teacher to remove it from her reading list. In addition to all the other controvery surrounding this book, I say just \\"don't go there\\".  No children's book should be able to provoke this much negativity and still be in print. Read \\"Guess How Much I Love You\\" or \\"Owl Babies\\" instead. Much better, feel-good books that properly illustrate parental love for a child. <br />
B00005JNJ7|4.0|With a truly American theme song (...) Team America: World police is one of the funniest movies released this year. Trey Parker and Matt Stone do not care; they offend everyone equally. Even though I'm a fan of most of the actors of the F.A.G. (Film Actors Guild), I have to admit that the more they voice their opinions about world events, the more they become windbags just like the politicians. It's no wonder that actors and politicians are handled the same way in Team America; they're all such great actors! I think a movie like Team America is necessary in the world today. The world needs to watch this movie to see how ignorant Americans really are. We are the Mountain Dew chugging, \\"bad guy\\" killing, foul-mouthed capital of the world... and we're proud of it! This movie is a revelation about how hilarious the ridiculous absurdity of mainstream American culture really is. Team America: World Police is a necessary satire in an all too serious time.
B00005JMUL|5.0|Join the adventurous train journey with Hero Boy on the \\"The Polar Express\\" to the North pole to discover the true spirit of Christmas, twined with some surreal state-of-the-art digital motion capture technology and Tom Hanks near flawless acting - the movie is a Christmas feast not to be missed. <br /> <br />The movie is an adaptation of the popular Chris Van Allsburg children's tale \\"The Polar Express\\" and it revolves around a doubting young boy who has nearly lost his faith in Santa Claus and his journey of self-discovery that shows him that the wonder of life never fades for those who believe. <br /> <br />Ok now, the movie does have a creepy angle to it with some-what frightening action scenes and kids in \\"constant states of peril\\" but only making it grip to your seats more firmly. <br /> <br />I was awed by the creative execution and watching the movie in 3D at IMAX made the whole experience very special. <br /> <br />So get aboard this train for it promises an adventure of a life time.
B0001DI0FI|5.0|I went into the theater ready to hate this movie. I am not a fan of the novels, nor am I a fan of militaristic movies. <br /> <br />However, after railing against going, I loved it. This is a beautiful movie, the scenery, the dialog and the music are all wonderful. Russell Crowe did an excellent job of conveying the contrasts in his charcater, one one side an obsessive warrior and on the other a sensitive friend and musician. Paul Bettany is equally good and plays both the dramatic foil and the friend convincingly.  <br /> <br />Additionally, this movie is very esthetically pleasing. The backdrops of the open sea and the Galapagos are sparse, but beautiful.  <br /> <br />This two disc DVD set is very good and now this has become one of my favorite movies. I would reccommend this to anyone who enjoys a good adventure movie and especially to female fans of Russell Crowe who are looking for a movie that their husbands will enjoy as well!
B00063EMJ6|4.0|--but great to have them all in one place, well-recorded. <br /> <br />And, while the list of other songs that could have been included was generally well thought out, it's remarkable that such a well-informed fan included \\"Horse With No Name.\\"  That's the NY sound-alike song from the flash-in-the-pan group America, NOT a Neil Young song.  Sheesh!
B000683VI4|4.0|I saw this movie in the most unromantic place possible, the coach cabin of a long transatlantic flight. Yes, I was a captive audience with little else to watch or do, but usually I turn on the movie for 15 minutes and then go back to reading my book. I'm usually not a fan of the tearjerker genre either, but this movie however managed to hold my attention. <br /> <br />This is a very sweet story about love and dedication. Duke, played by James Garner visits everyday with an Alzheimers patient in a nursing home, played superbly by Gena Rolands. He reads her stories in the hopes that it might help her remember something about her own life. The story he tells her is about a young man, Noah, and young woman, Allie, played by Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams. They are from different backgrounds and they fall in love at the eve of World War II.  <br /> <br />The story told is not particularly unique, parents disapproving, young lovers seperated, etc. But the acting, sets and costuming are very good in this movie, making it very easy to get caught up in the story of Noah and Allie. <br /> <br />This movie has some big tearjerker moments. It was hard to watch on the plane and muffle my sniffles and dab at my tears without being embarrased, since my husband was sitting next to me laughing his head off at Anchorman. So, while I recommend watching it in a different location, I do recommend this movie. I enjoyed it and if you like romantic movies, you probably will too.
B000006MS3|5.0|This is without a doubt the best album ever made by anyone. Kate Bush is a genious, and her music (this album in particular) is a perfect demonstration of that fact. The only true way to go through and review it is to do so song by song (all individual reviews are graded out of 10) <br /> <br />1 - Sat in Your Lap (9): <br />This is the most accessable and radio-ready piece on the album. Kate sings like a siren, showing off her amazing range in completely different sounding sections and hooks of the song. To me, it only gets a 9 because it seems like her creativity was a bit watered down to have at least one track meant fo radio play. <br /> <br />2 - There Goes A Tenner (10): <br />This is one of the most standout songs, especially on the first listen through. It immediately draws you into it's brilliant beats and vocal hooks. Kate discribes a bank robbery gone horribly wrong in this second radio-ready track. It is plenty original and creative though to earn full marks. <br /> <br />3 - Pull Out the Pin (10): <br />This is one of the most intelligent, theatrical songs on the CD. It takes a while to reach the place where you are really into it enough to really understand and appreciate it, but once you're there you can't escape. Not that it's a major selling point, but I absolutely love her pained screams of \\"I love life!\\" throughout the chorus. <br /> <br />4 - Suspended in Gaffa (10): <br />Another masterpiece. Again, a bit hard to get into, but turns you onto the more abstract ideas of the rest of the album, especially the next two tracks. Very catchy, and fairly easy to get into. You'll find it annoying the first time, but it will all of a sudden just dawn on you and you wont be able to take it off \\"repeat\\" for a while. Mommy, where are the angels? I'm scared of the changes. <br /> <br />5 - Leave it Open (10): <br />While one of the most abstract songs on the CD, and not particularly catchy, this track is extremely well written. The filters on Kate's voice during the voices are perfectly suited, and whatever she did to it on the chorus is absolutely stunning. \\"My lies would creep in dust, things that decay, things that rust.\\" And that's just two lines of this poetic great. <br /> <br />6 - The Dreaming (10): <br />Another abstract song. In fact, everything about it is abstract, from the digireedoo to the chanting (and that little dance she does in the video).Absolutely brilliant, and easily accessable to general listeners. The lyrics can be interpreted in many different ways, leaving you thinking about something completely different each time you hear it. <br /> <br />7 - Night of the Swallow (10): <br />This, and the next three tracks, are the most inaccessable of the CD. This is a long, plot driven piece. The instrumentals are amazing, and Kate's vocals are perfect for the message she is trying to portray. <br /> <br />8 - All The Love (10): <br />An extremely sad song about death. The lyrics are beautiful, and the deeper meanings prevoke many thoughts about what will happen when you go, but could probably be interpreted differently as well. The quiet chorus is haunting. <br /> <br />9 - Houdini (11): <br />The standout song of the album. So good it gets even more than a 10. A perfectly written and carried out story of Houdini drowning, from the point of view of his lover, Rosabella. The chorus is so good it's beyond words. It's extremely difficult to discribe the song's greatness in words. You simply must hear this song to believe how great it is. This song is the source of the album's cover and the beautiful quote on the back of the LP. <br /> <br />10 - Get Out of My House (10): <br />This is a complete change of course from the previous track. Easily accessable and utterly brilliant. An amazing song about an intruder, filled with pained, dramatic vocals perfect background drum beats, and an amusing (and difficult to decipher) sequence with a mule at the end amongst the strange conversation. This is Kate at her best.Should have been a single. In fact, the whole album should have been a single.  <br /> <br />In conclusion, if you don't have this album, get it immediately. I have no idea how anyone could live without it. Dramatic, offbeat, and simply stunning. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />-Josh Hamon <br />Games Frontier Staff Writer <br />[...]
B00004NRWH|4.0|The Vancouver Canada based quartet deliver a solid album as usual.  Has about 2 skippable tracks but the rest are good, with 1 great song.  Has the deeper songs that make you think, something they are good at doing, as well as the more upbeat faster songs.  As with all their releases, you won't be disappointed.  Has one acoustic song which isn't the best.  Not their best album to date but definately a good, solid album and a must have for their fans or fans of alternative music. <br /> <br />#1 - 9.5 (great song) <br />#2 - 8 <br />#3 - 8 <br />#4 - 7 <br />#5 - 7.5 <br />#6 - 7.5 <br />#7 - 8 <br />#8 - 6 <br />#9 - 8 <br />#10 - 6 <br />#11 - 4 (same as #3 but the acoustic version) <br /> <br />Vancouver, BC, Canada <br />check all my reviews
B00005JNDX|4.0|OK I just saw this movie about an 1/2 hour ago. It is a good movie. Not great, but good. But then that is what I would say about the first one too. Anyway, I liked this movie. The 3 main stars return: Renee Zellweger, Colin Firth and Hugh Grant. Actually everyone that was in the first one is in this one. Bridget Jones (Renee) hasn't changed much. She has a real boyfriend now, but she still smokes and drinks (not as much though). My only problem is Renee looked too overweight. She looked good in the first one, but this one she just gained too much for the role. Mark Darcy (Colin) in this movie is a combination of sexy, annoying, snobbish & a bit funny too.(similar to the first movie, but better). There are times in this movie that I just wanted to shake some sense into Mark. The movie: It takes place 6 weeks later from where the first one left off. Bridget and Mark are together. It is still very awkward between the 2 of them. He is the straight laced serious lawyer and she is the insecure tv reporter.  Daniel Clever (Hugh) is also back - still the same sexy scoundral as in the first movie. It has some funny parts, some that you laugh at just because that is you during that scene or situation and then there are some parts that really don't make sense. Like the first movie, there are areas that don't match if you read the book and then see the movie or vice versa. You are taken through quite a few situations from start to finish, but in the end it finishes like you want it to. It is a good movie to see if you are 1) wanting to see what happens from where the first movie left off & 2) wanting to completely forget your life for an hour and a 1/2. I really suggest that you see it!
B000002LRX|5.0|Angel Dust is easily one of my top 10 cds I own.  In 2004 it still remains ahead of its time and will probably still sound fresh in 10 years.  I think this is Mike Patton's best vocal performance and contains some of FNM's best songs ever.  Buy it now!
0140277447|5.0|There is controversy to Ms. Chang's book, but the central message is clear - the inhumanity and evil imparted to the Chinese by their Japanese overlords defies logic and our capacity to comprehend.  We can understand war, we can relate to murder, but when one reads The Rape of Nanking the depravity of torture-for-sport and cruelty-for-pleasure is so utterly revolting it creates a sense of denial.  Only through denial can we escape the reality that humans are capable of these crimes.  What could possible make a young Japanese solider force a son to rape his mother?  Or laugh as a father rapes his daughter?  Gang rape women to death, burn men alive, hack living babies slowly to pieces?  Who could do this, how, why?; and more importantly, how could so many systematically partake in the horror?  Perhaps most importantly, how have we let that sense of denial turn the incident into collective amnesia?    Ms Chang speaks for the dead.  She speaks with a voice that is eloquent and powerful.  She touches a universal truth that death should be a gentle transition from this world to the next, surrounded by loved one and friends; and that the unmitigated hell of the Nanking victims in their last moments was the very definition of evil.  Through Ms. Chang, the dead raise their voices, imploring us never to forget.  Memory is all that is left of them, and without memory, it could all happen again.  In perhaps one of the most powerful admonishment ever written, Ms. Chang states that the greatest rape of all is allowing the horrors and atrocities to pass first into ignorance, then denial, and finally oblivion.    On a personal note, Iris Chang and I were born exactly 13 days apart.  We both went to the University of Illinois, though I never knew her.  I remember when the Rape of Nanking was published being awed by the power and grace and rage and intelligence of her writing and her research, that someone my own age could produce such a work.  Eleven days ago Ms. Chang chose to endher life.  I cannot imagine the horrors in her mind that would cause her to abandon forever her husband and 2 year old child.  Perhaps she was the last victim of Nanking.  If so, then let her voice join the others, and may their memories not fade from this Earth.
B000000H57|5.0|I got October Rust the day i came out back in 1996.  To this day, it is one of the best things I have ever heard and have accidentally impregnated three females to \\"LOVE YOU TO DEATH\\".  OK, so that wasn't true, but it could happen, that song is so good.
B000002O1P|5.0|I am shocked at the negative comments directed at this album. I have every Tom Petty album made and this one became my favorite after the very first time I listened to it. The album opens with \\"Rebels,\\" a powerful song about Civil War feelings not yet gone. Tom then goes directly into another song about discontent, \\"It Ain't Nothin' to Me.\\" Tom stays in a bitter and somber mood with \\"Don't Come Around Here No More,\\" the biggest hit of the album. However, the best song on the album is next, with the classic title track, \\"Southern Accents.\\" This song sounds  penned from Faulkner, with vivid references to the pride Tom feels for his Southern roots. The rest of the songs are all solid, with \\"Dogs on the Run\\" balancing out the album as the last great song. Music is subjective and to each their own. But for my money, this is Tom Petty's masterpiece.
B000001FI7|5.0|I heard Tricky's song \\"HELL IS AROUND THE CORNER\\" and loved it. I later found out he sampled PORTISHEAD, so naturally I went and bought this album.  THIS IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE ALBUMS!  Is is one of the darkest cd's I've ever heard, and that is saying a lot, just look at some of the other stuff i've reviewed.  BUY IT!
B0002SROT0|5.0|4 years ago I accidentally downloaded an orchestral version of Elliott Smith' &quot;Between the Bars&quot; while looking for MP3's. <br />That was the best mistake I've ever made, because since then I've become completey immersed in the music of Elliott Smith. He was a troubled man with a wicked pop sense, and easily this album is the closest you'll get to a lost Beatles album written only by John Lennon. <br />A lot of the songs on &quot;Basement&quot; were performed live by Smith, months before his death. Those rough ideas develop into amazing muiscal paintings on this album. Particularily &quot;King's Crossing&quot;, which made my jaw drop when the drums came in.<br />Essentially, had this album been completely finished by Smith, it would most certainly have been &quot;The new White Album&quot;. Smith had originally intended the album to have a second disc of instrumental experiments. Well, experimental, not so much &quot;Experiments&quot; themselves.<br />This is easily the best album to come out this year, a year already blessed with gems (K-OS - Joyful Rebellion, Nas - Street's Disciple, The Zutons - Who Killed The Zutons, Phantom Planet - Phantom Planet) to name a few scorchers. <br />I highly reccomend this album, and all of his albums. Though, if you like it more stripped down, I'd reccomend his first 3 albums (up to &quot;either/or&quot;). I love &quot;Figure 8&quot; very much though, as it was the first Smith album I got.<br />R.I.P. - Elliott Smith
B00006LLNU|5.0|it is that powerful, but I won't.  The first four tracks, track six, and eight are the best on the album.  I saw Sigur Ros live right when this came out and not only was it one of the best shows I've ever seen, but also one of my greatest life experiences.  Just look at my other reviews, this isn't even really my kind of music but i still love it.
1400032717|5.0|One of the most entertaining books I have ever read. Mark Haddon style in writing and easiness to follow is amazaing. The story is about Chris (the boy) who plays a detective role in finding out who killed the neighbours (Mrs. Shears) dog (Wellington), through that process he discovers more serious facts that makes him even paranoid with some daily incidents. Chris loves math and he tries to use that in explaining his point of view and why some things happen they do. Chris is very unique in his way of thinking, approach and conclusions he makes.<br /><br />It is enough to start reading the first 5 pages, and then you get hooked, and you have to complete this England based story. The book is full of humor, but at the same time serious enough to keep you wondering what is going to come out of Chris, the dad, the dog, and the ...<br /><br />Mark Haddon (the real author) does a great job in this book, and will get me to read more of his books.
B00006RAKP|4.0|This is a superb collection, but as other intrepid reviewers have noted, there are a few things missing, specifically \\"Mona Lisa And Mad Hatters.\\"  Still, following in the footsteps of seemingly every other classic rocker who has produced a double CD of Greatest Hits, this one at least satiates a good Elton John fix.  His collaborations with Taupin are still jaw dropping, and the layers of instrumentation are quite simply amazing.  You will, I promise, remember why you thought he was so amazing in the first place.
B0000025DD|5.0|It's now been an entire decade since Pink Floyd released a new studio album, and the likelihood of a forthcoming album or tour is getting drearier. So, once new fans have collected all of the albums of those legendary titans, and are perplexed as to where the \\"next Floyd album\\" is, they can find a silver lining in collecting the solo albums of the five past and present members. Aside from being a great place to start, David Gilmour's eponymous solo debut (along with fellow PF member Richard Wright's \\"Wet Dream\\") is significant for students of Floyd history; it captures the missing period of time between the 1977 \\"Animals\\" album and the long, tension-racked sessions for 1979's epic \\"The Wall.\\" Released in 1978, Gilmour's first album is both as atmospheric and varied as \\"The Wall\\" due to his signature guitar work, and often as rough as \\"Animals.\\" The opening instrumental 'Mihalis' and another interesting instrumental 'Raise My Rent' are like the instrumental demos Gilmour recorded during these sessions which would eventually become 'Comfortably Numb' and 'Run Like Hell.' But the top songs on the album present Gilmour as a strong songwriter, or in the case of the melodic 'There's No Way Out Of Here,' an interpreter. 'So Far Away' and 'I Can't Breathe Anymore' prove the guitarist is an excellent crafter of songs, and it's been speculated that 'No Way' could be Gilmour's description of Floyd's dominant presence Roger Waters, while 'Short and Sweet' (co-written with Roy Harper) is the kind of radio-friendly song that makes this album such a joy for even non-Floyd fans to listen to.
B00068IOWM|4.0|\\"How to dismantle..\\" is littered with very complete tunes and although it has 2-3 weaker songs, overall it is a good cd.  The postives: (1)Edge's unique guitar sounds (2)Adam with his bulldozer bass lines.  Negatives: (1)Bono is vocally great, but sometimes his voice sounds strained (2)Larry is solid but the drum volume is too low.   <br /> <br />STAND-OUTS: <br />Vertigo (as rough as u2 has ever been, and its great) <br />One Step Closer (I heard Noel Gallagher gave Bono the idea of this, he should kept it, Oasis need the help) <br />Love and Peace or Else (Trent Rezner, a u2 fan, would be proud) <br /> <br />LEAVE THEM BEHIND: <br />Original of the Species (will be a hit but I think its overproduced) <br />All Because of You (an \\"intellectual tortoise?\\" come on, bono)
B00003CX9E|5.0|A few weeks ago I had the astounding honor of fulfilling one of my lifelong goals; I met Roger Ebert.<br /><br />Me and my co-directing friend went to the Savannah Film festival with big cheezy grins on our faces. We were going to have a once in a lifetime opportunity to go through a shot-by-shot question and answer session with Roger Ebert. That in itself was incredible, and more than enough to keep this Alabama boy happy the rest of his days. I have spent the last decade reading his reviews, along with millions of other folks every week. He is arguably the number one personal source of information on Citizen Kane. So respected in fact, he was given the task to have an informative commentary track on the disk, which any fan of the film should listen to.<br /><br />We had to throw around a few bargains, but finally we krept our way to the front row. In front of me, the stool in which he was going to sit on. Most excellent, right? Wrong, that's nothing - just the beginning. Behind me, a voice was heard amongst the others in the packed theater. \\"Thats where he sat last night.\\" To my amazement he was pointing to the chair directly beside me. I choked as they brought in a microphone and placed it in front of the seat to my right. I was going to watch what the American Film Institute calls \\"the greatest movie of all time\\", with one of the most respected Critics of all time.<br /><br />Sure enough, he came in and gave a brief bow. \\"Peter O' Toole was here wednesday, and let me tell you, he is a pro at taking applause. First he gracefully entered bowing then, once he had sat down, he noticed the balcony, so he stood once more with a surprised expression on his face as if he didn't deserve it. He is the master.\\" Likewise he did so to the balcony.<br /><br />Ebert was very nice, and if he were to stop reviewing, he would have no trouble finding work as a stand-up comedian. Popping the Citizen Kane disk out and placing it in the player, he kept the crowd rolling with anecdotes. Anything from why watching weekly citcoms is a sin, to the absurdity of yearly sports. He is anti-cycle. \\"Watching three episodes of Seinfield is a good thing. Watching every episode of seinfield is a waste of life. Watch a movie, listen to music, have a picnic, make love to your spouse... anything!\\"<br /><br />Ofcourse there were some unhappy groans, but hey, he was honest and unpolitically correct, which anyone should give him credit for. Finally, \\"Lets get the movie going.\\"<br /><br />He sat down beside me. There was a brief exchange of nods as the lights went down. The rules to the question and answer session is, as the movie rolls if you have a comment or question you yell out \\"STOP!\\" And so he does, then the question is asked.<br /><br />I was able to decifer some of the unintelligable questions for Ebert, because it was a packed house and some of the voices were very faint. One person caused a laughing riot when he compared the little monkey dolls in the wife's room with the flying monkeys in the Wizard of Oz; As if there was some intentional link between them. Ebert replied, \\"That is something you have to decide between you and your conspirator.\\" The voice lashed out, \\"In this case, that would be you!\\" \\"Uh oh,\\" Ebert laughed to himself.<br /><br />There were many facts unearthed during the session. Some that even he, after over a hundred viewings, hadn't realized. Such as \\"the ranch\\" mentioned earlier in the film held the same name as the bar his wife is drinking in during her talk with the newspaper man. Also shot in which main characters are seen as the camera pulls back through a window. A hand is barely seen removing a chair from the way of the camera. Very neat information for fans. These discoveries led to applause towards the discovering audience members. Later these were put in his own essay about the festival.<br /><br />\\"The sled in the film was purchased at auction by Steven Spielberg.\\" I was shocked. I leaned over to him, \\"I was the one who sent you the e-mail about that when it happened.\\" He was surprised, \\"Really?\\" Then he want back to the Q and A. I supposed he was just humoring me, because he is no doubt use to the crazies out there. So I left it at that.<br /><br />Once the film ended and he had said his last words, the crowd stood up and raced towards him. To my surprise, he walked over to me, \\"So, you sent me that e-mail?\\" He really remembered. Out of all of the thousands of e-mails, he plucked from his memory, my letter. \\"Yes sir,\\" I said. \\"Wow, and I replied right?\\" he asked. \\"Yes, you said 'thanks for the information'. That 'news about the sled interested you greatly'.\\"<br /><br />I knew the people standing around us were growing angry, but we continued to talk. After all was said and done, my friend and I received autograph's and a picture which you can see at hideawayfilms dot com. He gave us almost all the time he had, and for all of these things I am extremely grateful. I know it took an act of God to bring all of this together so perfectly, and to him I am forever in debt.<br /><br />Watching Citizen Kane was an incredible experience that everyone should take part in atleast once. If you don't like it, that's fine, you know my opinion. Give the commentary a shot, it's a wealth of information that will help in your pursuit for film knowledge. Kane is the standard by which many filmakers, including myself, have set for themselves. It is a good measure.  ~S.A.O.S.~was the one who sent you the e-mail about that when it happened.\\" He was surprised, \\"Really?\\" Then he want back to the Q and A.

B00068IOWM|5.0|U2 are one of the few bands in the history of rock which have maintained such a high level of commercial success while still maintaining their musical integrity and basically addding to their absolutely HUGE following as they went along.   <br /> <br />However, I had lost a lot of the love I had for my favorite band of the 80s after the infamous ZooTV tour ended.  \\"Pop\\" was too over-the-top experimental for me, and although it was a good album, it had some fillers.   It felt rushed and we found out it was.  With 2000's \\"All That You Can't Leave Behind,\\" I found myself cringing at the feeling that u2 were simply running through the motions with a very \\"safe\\" record. Although the first half was maybe one of their strongest, the second half was full of weak attempts to fill an album, the exception being \\"New York.\\"   <br /> <br />To say I was excited to hear \\"How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb\\" might be the biggest understatement of the year.  This u2 record, for the first time in years, lives off emotion and is soaked with passion and pure beauty.  As a musician, I find myself being sometimes too critical of music I listen to.  With U2 this is easy, as you can not possibly get a grip on the true essence of any of their albums without fully falling into the songs and discovering each and every one of them.   <br /> <br />The first half of HTDAAB are stacked with singles and juggernauts.  \\"Vertigo\\" blasts through the speakers to lead off the album, the perfect first track as Bono does the Spanish countdown and Edge comes in with the angry guitar riffs.  I think \\"Miracle Drug\\" officially has the copyright sign after the G because it is a classic u2 song in which only they can do.  Incredible, as is \\"Sometimes You Can't Make it on Your Own,\\" which is a good companion to \\"Stuck in a Moment.\\"  It's honestly a little better though.  The hair-raising ballad leads into the experimental \\"Love and Peace or Else\\", which is filled with so many sounds it could have been separated intothree different songs.  The guitar work by Edge is nothing short of genius, and it covers up pretty weak lyrics by Bono.  The next track is the strongest on the record and will be the highlight of next year's tour.  \\"The City of Blinding Lights\\" is the song I've been waiting for them to make since the \\"Joshua Tree.\\"  It is pure beauty which puts you back in the 80s, and then the next song \\"All Because of You\\" seems to jump you back two decades more.  This is definetly influenced by the Stones, as Edge goes crazy with his guitar again.  Again, it does an amazing job at covering up a slightly weak chorus.  Other than that, a fantastic track. <br /> <br />Enough of those radio hits, now is when the record gets really interesting.  \\"A Man and a Woman\\" is a pretty risky move by U2 because it's basically a love song with some \\"marvin gaye\\" influence sprinkled on it.  Sometimes I sit back and think, how do they pull stuff like this off? But they do, and the funny thing is the first time you hear it, you say to yourself it may be the worst song they ever recorded.  Five listens later, you know all the words and are singing it at work.  \\"Crumbs from You Table\\" I was hearing was the weakest here, but that's very untrue.  The song and guitar work, although stellar, do get a little repetitive, but Bono is flawless here and delivers a monster.  \\"One Step Closer\\" is the song which is essential to the whole theme of the album, and it just has me in emotional knots when I hear it.  It's very touching, and I found it more personal than the following \\"Original of the Species\\", which is a fantastic tune but feels like u2 were trying too hard to make a hit with it.  And finally u2's best closer since \\"All I Want is You,\\" it is \\"Yahweh,\\"  a fascinating song which runs by you so smoothly like a summer breeze.  It has just impeccable lyrics and ends the album with Bono declaring, \\"take this heart...and make it break.\\" <br /> <br />With the collectors edition comes \\"Fast Cars,\\" a fun track which u2 completed in a few hours on the final day in the studio.  It's truly great, but I'm glad it is not on the regular album format, it doesn't fit the overall theme of the record.   <br /> <br />I've always stayed interested in u2 over the last few years, but I didn't feel that emotion to their music which had connected me to them when I first heard \\"Bad\\" in 1984.  This album brings all that back for me and once again displays the band's truly unforgettable fire.
B000669GAI|5.0|So finally Sony has decided to release a Pearl Jam Greatest Hits Package.  Like another reviewer, I was interested to see what they would chose for this compilation.  While little on it really surprised me (apart from Breath, and State of Love and Trust), it is still a great double disc set.  For those of you who only recognize PJ as the alt-rock radio band, then grab this (especially for under $20) - some of their later songs might be a nice surprise. I especially liked how they capped the whole thing off with Yellow Ledbetter at the end of disc 2.  It's out of order chronologically, but it's fitting and shows that some genuine thought went into making these cds.
B0002OERI0|4.0|First a comment on \\"punk rock.\\" People say it has to be NOFX and LAgwagon etc to \\"qualify\\" as punk.  Let's get past genre labels, they are a bit to reminiscient of a High School mentality.  If you think you are hard core punker, go listen to those bands that fit your expectations and leave the others alone.  American Idiot is a perfect album for Green Day to progress with, well written, catchy, thoughtful, and their best written to date.  For a band that plays a load of power chords this album sets green day up as one for the record books, they have outdone themselves.  This album is more than worth it, I can let it play all the way through without skipping a track, and thats the sign of a well written album.  Believe the hype.
038551123X|4.0|The serial-killer genre in both lit and film has been done to death. Hannibal Lecter, as far as fictional killers are concerned, has topped the charts, in terms of popularity. Lecter is unusually intelligent, cunning beyond words, and has aristocratic tastes, and a taste for human flesh. The old doctor kills when he's bored or annoyed. He disposed of the philharmonic's first-chair violinist, for example, because, he believed, the man played out of tune. In anyone's book, this killing was not justified, but justified enough for the ear-sensitive doctor. In Darkly Dreaming Dexter, we are given a unique perspective on a familiar theme: serial killer as avenging knight. Dexter knows he's an emotionless killer; he knows he's basically damaged goods because of a terrible event in his childhood; however, he has somehow managed to channel his fondness for murder towards those individuals who actually deserve it - child killers, etc. This is an interesting and unique twist for the genre, though Dexter loves his work, I mean, really loves it, which makes the whole concept a tad disturbing.<br /><br />For a first time novelist, this is a good effort, easy to read prose that pushes the reader along.<br /><br />Written in the first-person, we're permitted entry to Dexter's mind. We find that he has a dual personality, his social persona, the face he shows to the world, and the \\"dark passenger\\"; the famous Freudian \\"id\\", which drives him to commit these acts of \\"justice\\". The man appears to be in control of both personalities, until he begins dreaming about another serial killer's work. Another serial killer is on the loose in Miami, taunting Dexter, imitating his style, only he's much more efficient. Is it possible that Dexter is this new killer, performing these heinous acts in his sleep? Has it come down to the fact that \\"total control\\" Dexter is finally losing it?<br /><br />Jeff Lindsay has managed to make a serial killer a likable fellow - naive, self-deprecating and at times even funny.<br /><br />For pure entertainment, Dexter is good value.at times even funny.  <br /> <br />For pure entertainment, Dexter is good value. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B0002OERI0|5.0|When I first heard the newest Green Day CD, I was pretty unimpressed. I'll admit, I greatly disliked Warning and was a bit leery of buying this CD -until I saw them in concert.  The CD is by far one of the best Green Day has done. It shows a lot of growth and maturity, which is bad for a lot of people.  Yet, these guys are 32 with children, how many songs can you write about pot and beer and teen angst when you're a father?  They grew up, and it's great to see their music grow with them. <br /> <br />Some of the subjects did change, but the basic sound is still there, and it's only gotten better with time! Their \\"rock operas\\" are truly amazing, conjuring up images of Queen and Tommy. The music is so rich, it's impossible to get sick of this CD! <br /> <br />Some tracks to definitely listen to: Whatsername, Blvd. of Broken Dreams and Holiday.
B000089CJI|5.0|THIS RULES!!!!!!!!! I herd of them from a firend and i think they are awesome.
B00004XQP4|5.0|If you are going to listen to 'Warning' for the first time, here is what you should do: <br /> <br />1. Forget what you knew about Green Day and remember just one thing: it is the only punk revival band that can change stereotypes about themselves. <br /> <br />2. Don't be too concerned about sticking to the punk pigeonhole. That's not what this album is about - so just relax. <br /> <br />3. Listen to the music of one of the best American guitar rock bands of all time greatly influenced by the Beatles, the Kinks and the Ramones. Try to enjoy it be cause it's really worth it. <br /> <br />If you look at 'Warning' this way, I guess you would agree with me that it is the best album in the Green Day's ever-evolving career. <br /> <br />PS: I haven't had a chance to listen to 'American Idiot' yet.
B00065JTBA|5.0|I downloaded the songs off itunes and this may be the best collection of unpublished songs I have heard by any band.  I am truly addicted to the music- I cannot turn it off!!!
B000069HK2|5.0|The Used is with a doubt the best and will stay the best screamo band out there. Both of their albums are great! Without them your collection, your's isn't complete. Every song on the debute album is perfect and almost every song on In Love and Death is perfect. They combine Handcore and Screamo songs with softer songs here and there. Every screamo fan should have this CD. I can't wait until a third album of The Used comes out (Probably in about 2 years). Until then I'll listen to both of their CD's knowing they're the best band on the earth.
B000006TRV|5.0|I highly recommend this cd,especially 2 anyone who loves classical rock music. It's a little dark but edge. the guitar on most of the songs, sounds excellent.
B000669GAI|5.0|I used to ask myself if there was a way to get all of my fav Pearl Jam songs together on two (or even three or four) CDs. My question was answered on Nov 16, when Pearl Jam gave its die hard fans a nearly lethal dose of rock. Although there isn't anything &quot;new&quot; on the album, it was awesome to see a few new mixes. I really like what was done with &quot;Black&quot;, and kicking off the album with &quot;Once&quot; was an awesome idea. <br />If you're a new Pearl Jam fan, this is the perfect &quot;starter kit&quot; for you, but you'll still have to go and pick up all of the other albums (burned copies don't count!). I was a amazed when I saw that &quot;State of Love and Trust&quot;, and &quot;Breath&quot; were included on the album, as they are both classics. <br />Don't hesitate to buy this album (hell, get three or four copies of it so that you have one wherever you go). Every song will have you rocking out, and Mike McCready, Eddie Vedder, Matt Cameron, Jeff Ament,Stone Gossard and company never cease to amaze. <br />The ONLY things that I can say would have improved this album (if possible) would have been a live version of &quot;Yellow Ledbetter&quot;, (the studio version doesnt do the song justice) and a better CD insert booklet (I was hoping for commentary on the songs, lyrics and all kinds of neat stuff, like most of their other booklets have). <br />PEARL JAM ROCKS!
B0002XH9Z4|5.0|It doesn't matter what anybody says about this man, he is the epitome of a pop superstar, legend, performer, entertainer, songwritter & vocalist. His presence alone makes people cry & pass out, it's as if they're going through an exorcism. What other human being in this world has that kind of effect on people? You don't have to be a fanatic to see the phenomenal talent that this man has. All these popstars out there today: Justin, Usher, britney, beyonce, etc. are doing things MJ did 20 years ago yet people worship them & bash MJ. These people wouldn't even be here had it not been for him. This boxset is great, \\"Fall Again\\" & \\"We've had enough\\" show why Michael is the great music maker he is today. The 1992 concert? Truly amazing & Michael at his best. When doesn't he do a show stopping performance? From the time he first appeared on the Ed Sullivan Show to Thriller to History & beyond, he has changed the world & revolutionized popular music & this box set traces that journey. Michael Jackson is the definition of an icon & I find it so unfair that people choose to pick him apart the way they do all because he's extremely rich & extremely influential & they're just too damn jealous to handle it! Michael broke? HA! That man has income coming in from a thousand & one different places. All he has to do is give one concert & that'll generate 10-15 million bucks right there & if he went on tour... well, I think you already know. Michael is the king of Pop & there will never be another like him. That man commands respect when he shows up at award shows & he knows that no matter what happens, his fans got his back!
B0006IUDXA|5.0|MacGyver is  the original  DIY:  do-it-yourselfer.   You never  see him shoot a gun, he's afraid of heights, and he can work wonders with a rubber band and a paper  clip.

B000669GAI|3.0|I've been a Pearl Jam fan since the first time I sat down and actually listened to Ten.  They have been my favorite band ever since.  I have a collection of almost all their albums and singles on both CD and vinyl.  About 18 months ago when I first heard rumors of a greatest hits album, I was excited.  I knew Pearl Jam would not do the mainstream thing and release a collection of their singles......seems I was wrong.   <br /> <br />I find it a little sad because they have so many great songs that would make a great album, displaying the songs that many people may have missed in the past ten years.  Songs like Love Boat Captain, Thumbing My Way, Sometimes, Smile, Off The Girl, Thin Air, Untitled (from Live On Two Legs), Brain of J, Present Tense, etc.  I was really hoping to see a Pearl Jam really rock the boat and release a greatest hits album that didn't feature a single song that hit airwaves.  I know they could have easily pulled it off.   <br /> <br />After all the cool moves that Pearl Jam has made to defy mainstream, I am disappointed that their Greatest Hits is purely mainstream.
B0006284JQ|2.0|It is all corporate created jive!<br /><br />Where is the art???
B00063MBU8|5.0|This CD is great, I love it and I can't put it down.  It's a great departure from No Pads... and it's got a bigger variety.   <br />Go buy this album right now if you haven't already.  This isn't just some MTV band, it's a good band and they put on awesome concerts.  They're on tour right now go check them out and meet them! They're the sweetest guys, support them!  <br />I saw them in concert like the 3rd or 4th show and it was amazing.  I had a great spot and the sound was awesome.  I love seeing them live because of their personality and it shows.   <br />If you like Simple Plan look for- <br />Man of the Hour - Coming Soon <br />Good Charlotte - Chronicles of Life and Deather <br />Sugarcult - Palm Trees and Power Lines <br />Green Day - American Idiot <br />Sum 41 - Chuck <br />Avril Lavigne - Nobody's Home <br />
B000002KAT|5.0|What is there to be said about this phenomenal piece of art that has not been said hundreds of times before. This is an album of such beauty, such heartbreak, and such quiet desperation, that you don't know how it's making you feel, although you come out feeling quite melancholy. This is not an album chocked full of hits. Don't be expecting anything like Moondance, Tupelo Honey, And It Stoned Me, and especially not Brown Eyed GIrl on this album. This really isn't even a rock n roll album. It's more of a folk/jazz piece of work. It is not an album that you change the tracks on, but more like an extraordinary novel, that chapters cannot be skipped, and words cannot be over looked. This album is both spiritual release and spiritual adventure, always finding something new along the way, feeling like you're experiencing the album for the first time every time you listen to it. From what I have heard, Van watched his girlfriend die, i don't know exactly what from, but it shows, both in the lyrics, and in the overall tone of the album, especially Slim Slow Slider(I know you're dying baby, and I know, You know it too). One thing i have started to notice is that this album plays like a year, each song a certain point of the season, Astral Weeks and Beside You both being the joy and renewal of love and hope in the Spring time, although Beside You is a bit more somber in tone then Astral Week, but it is still a joyous time of life. Summer brings us both Sweet Thing and Cyrpus Avenue, seeming reminiscent of the warmth, and seemingly invincible tranquility you feel during this time of year, where nothing can go wrong for you, and it is all but an adventure. Then along come the Fall with the jazz like The Way Young Lovers Do and Madame George. Things are getting to be a little more uneasy, and a bit more melancholy, sort of like a crumbling relationship, when it reaches a stage of crisis, and doubt. You don't feel quite as invincible, and strong as you did in the Summer now. By the time the Winter has arrived, the relationship has crumbled, your hope, joy, and love has all been crumpled up, and thrown out the door. Ballerina is the sound of the love, and joy walking away, and closing that door you left open, so that the goodness of life will come to you, but you now know it won't be that way again. Slim Slow Slider is the sound of sorrow, the REAL sound of silence, and the sound of heartbreak. \\"You've gone for something, and I know, you won't be back\\" Van sings in his beautifully raspy voice, but in a hushed tone, which makes it seem as if he was feeling full of sorrow while recording the song. This album is pure emotion put on to tape. Astral Weeks is the reason we love music so much, and if you do not enjoy this album, you just don't quite understand the feeling of music. It's just too bad this was Van's second album, and he's never been able to come anywhere close to it sense.
B00068IOWM|4.0|what were they thinking calling this the album? some like it, but i can't be put in that group.  it is another u2 classic album though, i wouldn't call it a masterpiece like some have on these reviews.  also, why are people suddenly bashing the last album? i thought it was a great, had worldwide acclaim, and helped my family get through the aftershocks of 9/11.  so far i like it better than this new one.  i think the bomb has more strength because there are no real fillers on it, but the last record had \\"kite\\" which is their greatest song of the past 10 years.  highlights of the bomb are clearly \\"all because of you\\" and \\"crumbs from your table\\".  i love \\"vertigo\\" and its a shame the album couldn't be in the same vein as the lead single, its really exciting.  still, i do enjoy \\"a man and a woman\\" and \\"one step closer\\" two of the album's more slower songs. great album overall, just come up with a better title next time.   <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B0002F6BRE|5.0|I just watched my DVD of Elf last night.  We started out watching it as a family (my two kids, three and 18 months, my fianc and I) but ended up taking it to another room so the kids could watch Jimmy Neutron on Nickelodeon instead.  They were just too young to get interested.  That said, I thought this movie was very funny!  I loved Will Ferrell's acting in this movie.  He played the role of Buddy so well!  And Zooey Deschanel has a beautiful singing voice.  I also thought Buddy's supervisor at Gimble's was really funny.  It was also nice to see Mary Steeburgen in another holiday film, as her `One Magic Christmas' from 1985 will always be one of my favorite Christmas movies from my childhood.    <br /> <br />On to something else: The story was slightly predictable, but it was played out so well that I didn't even mind.  I thought the scenes in Central Park where the police are chasing Santa dragged a little, but that wasn't so bad either.  Overall, I definitely recommend this movie for families to enjoy at Christmastime.  <br />
B00005JMUL|5.0|If there's an Imax 3D theatre in your area, see Polar Express there!  The big screen, big sound and 3D make the experience awesome.  Anyone who likes the Peter Pan ride at Disney theme parks for its flight over and through London, will go bonkers for the aerial scenes in Polar Express.  The movie, as a story is good.  But for fans of animation and computer graphics, Polar Express on Imax 3D is the new state of the art.
B0000CDLA7|5.0|I have been following DT since the early nineties, and they never cease to amaze me. As a musician, I tend to look more closely at the dynamics a band puts forth. Dream Theater has it all. I would have to say that if....(if there has to be an if)DT has a weak point, it would be James LaBrie. (Although I admit, Jordan's Clavichord inputs are getting annoying. It sounds like something out of a western)  <br />James' vocals can be a little flat or sharp at times. But the music more than makes up for that. John P. and Jordan together make an awesome lead duo. Johnny M. is phenominal on bass. I could never hope to play like him. (although I can get close). And Mike? Well I've never heard the likes of him anywhere else. <br />Train of Thought is an awesome album. Everyone I've played it for has loved it. DT fans or not. (They are now!) I don't know what some of these 2-4 star boys are listening to but it can't be the same TOT I have. (The guy who said Rush can't play anymore...WAKE UP!!!!!) <br />All in all double thumbs up! <br />
B000286S8S|3.0|I hate to bring up the Van Halen Vs. Van Hagar or better yet the Diamond Dave Vs. Sammy, but with a release like this you just can't help it.<br /><br />I bought this CD out of desperation for music. Being in Iraq you have to put up with the slim selection in the mainside PX. I bought this CD mostly for the old stuff, and thought I could go along with the Sammy Hagar era as well.<br /><br />Well the CD jumps all over the place from Sammy back to Dave. It's almost as if the song list sets these two up to battle each other. It should have been Dave on one CD and Sammy on the other. I find myself hitting the FF&#62;&#62; button way too often.<br /><br />Yes I am a Van Halen fan of the old school. I like Dave as the frontman. WIth Dave, Van Halen was a party-hearty rockin' band. With Sam you get a cold and sterile corporate rock feel. You can almost hear the manager say &#34;All right boys, we need radio songs, you get paid for radio songs.&#34;<br /><br />I already have all of Van Valen's CDs (The Roth era mind you), and like I said I just bought this to tide me over until I get home. But really this is just another money grubbing tool that is unneccessery. And to be totally honest, Sammy has no business singing 'Jump' or 'Panama'. It just doesn't work. That's why Ozzy never sings Sabbath Songs from the Dio era.
B00028HBKC|1.0|I watched this movie many months ago and have thought about its violence, its intent and the historical context which Mel Gibson felt he was making the film.  A truely horrific film on many levels and I wish never to see it again.    The film began wonderfully and even engaged me as I watched Jesus make the decisions he knew would take him down the path to his ultimate crucifiction.  However as the film progressed the story, beyond its interpretive problems, grew into a movie of violence. I felt ill watching beating after beating and dramatic fall after dramatic fall.  The realism although technically commendable was beyond gruesome and beyond reasonability.  The story was far overshadowed by Mel Gibson's almost pornographic interest in the visciousness of the experience.      To bring a movie goer into the character's pain and visceral anguish is good film making but the level to which Mel Gibson goes takes away so much of the story of the crucifiction.  The suffering of Christ should be felt and felt soberly, but not to the outrageous degree that he takes the movie goer.    This film that should not be seen.  Read your bible and take it in with your minds eye, its a better choice.
B0002DB50E|5.0|If you are a Blondie fan, this is the movie where Debbie Harry has a nude scene. She looks pretty good as a redhead too. So at the end of the movie would you blow your head off to 'join' her?
B000002UJQ|5.0|I agree that disliking this album doesn't necessarily make you \\"musically immature\\" or whatever, and I can see how just the overall arrogance of some Radiohead fans can turn you off to it. <br /> <br />But at the same time, you don't really offer any compelling arguments as to what's wrong with the album itself. I mean, your major beef with it is that you don't like Fitter Happier? First off, it's unfair to classify Fitter Happier as a song, per se, when that's clearly not what it's designed to be. It wasn't made for your auditory enjoyment. But it is significant in that it basically embodies the theme of the entire album: the dehumanization of the human race in order to conform to workplace society, the usurpation of charm and personality in favor of mechanical \\"professionalism.\\" You might find the robotic voice annoying, but it clearly fits the theme of the track. And the fact that Thom came up with the idea to put it through his Mac while drunk doesn't take away from the value of it: while it might sound incoherent at times, he had written it out beforehand, so it's not just some unintelligible drunken slur. <br /> <br />If you don't like Fitter Happier, skip over it. It's just one track out of twelve. While I'll admit that I don't get the urge to listen to Fitter Happier every time I put in OK Computer, I appreciate it for what it is and don't hold it to a standard of what it is not. <br /> <br />And how the heck do the lyrics of The Tourist make it immature? Did you ever stop to analyze the meaning of the song, the deep, transcendentalist-like message that maybe everyone of us needs to slow down, that everyone of us needs to not be so caught up in frivolous cares, that we should all slow down and simply enjoy life? Not to mention that Jonny Greenwood's guitar playing in this song is absolutely AMAZING. <br /> <br />If you try to hold this album to standards of what it is not, you can't help but be disappointed by it. If you're looking for party music, this isn't it (not that there's anything wrong with party music). If you're looking for easily-accessible, sugary feel-good music, keep looking (not that there's anything wrong with a well-crafted pop song). If you come into this album with the idea that it's the most sacred and perfect fifty-three minutes of audio ever recorded, as many claim it to be, you'll also be disappointed, because this realization takes time to come to, and it's something that you have to reach on your own. So it's best to approach this album with a mind as open as possible, not being affected by the massive hype surrounding it but rather judging it by its own merits. <br /> <br />Again, I agree with you that it's childish and conceited to act like whether you like OK Computer or not is some litmus test for your intelligence or musical maturity. But Radiohead fans are known for their pretentiousness; maybe it's just that we appreciate their music so deeply that it's hard to imagine someone else not. But you shouldn't let this sour you on enjoying what is widely considered one of the greatest albums of the nineties, even of all time.
B0002IVN9W|5.0|This is one of the most exciting and emotional rock albums to come around in quite a while.  <br /> <br />Comparisons to other bands based on specific sounds (including the singer's voice), are superficial.  There is rock-solid pop songwriting at work here.  And the songs have an exciting and urgent emotional tone.  This arresting combination of strong songwriting and powerful emotion is what distinguishes Arcade Fire from their peers.   <br /> <br />
B00008OWZC|5.0|I never used to like Led Zep until one day my friend Mike in 2nd Grade gave me this album to listen . Wow. After my member started erecting after the first few notes played and I had an orgasm I knew that this was phenomenal music! In fact I'm still pinching myself every few minutes to make sure I'm not dreaming. It feels like I've died and gone to heaven. Now I don't bother trying to get a girlfriend and at night I fantatsize about Jimmy Page playing his double necked guitar. Thank you Led Zeppelin for your incredible music. You guys are up thee with Gary Gygax! I highly reccomend this CD to absolutely everyone.

B0006284JQ|3.0|Though her studio albums have shown occasional flashes of pop trash brilliance, Britney Spears remains an \\"artist\\" best served by her singles output, and this compilation does a fairly harmless job of piling them all on to one cd.  The proceedings start out with another misguided remake, this time of Bobby Brown's \\"classic\\" \\"My Prerogative\\"(which also informs the set's title)--someone in Spears' camp needs to buy this girl a bright idea and tell her to lay off the covers; this over-produced, underthought and undersung piece of soulless tripe actually makes the original(frankly not Brown's best moment in my opinion) really sound like a classic. Things pick up from  there with \\"Toxic\\", \\"Oops..I Did It Again\\" and \\"I'm A Slave 4 U\\" which, along with \\"...Baby One More Time\\" easily comprise her four best singles, on top of being fantastic pop records.  Shaky ground returns with the misguided \\"Me Against The Music\\"--still wondering why Madonna would lend her time to such an overly pedestrian track--oh yeah, i forgot.  AMERICAN LIFE.  Moving on, we have all those Max Martin soundalikes(\\"Stronger\\", \\"(You Drive Me)Crazy\\", et al), then a few ballads thrown in for good measure (\\"Everytime\\" and \\"I'm Not A Girl...\\" are actually both quite good, while the vile \\"From the Bottom Of My Tuneless(oops,Broken) Heart\\" was thankfully left off), then a couple more new tunes(\\"Do Somethin\\" actually wouldn't sound out of place being sung by Gwen Stefani--in other words, not a bad thing).  Just glancing at the tracklist, this \\"greatest hits\\" disc should also effectively put an end to the Madonna comparisons--like Madonna, this hits set comes four studio albums in, but really, can we be serious here?  THE IMMACULATE COLLECTION contained 15 CLASSICS(with SEVERAL top five singles actually left off), and this contains......you probably get the picture.  Still, as a snapshot of turn-of-the-century teen  pop, you could certainly do far worse.
0446677450|5.0|I was debating with myself whether I wanted to write this review or not, but after some thought I felt that perhaps someone who comes from a family that's already financially independent should say something. <br /> <br />My family isn't wealthy, at least we don't consider ourselves wealthy.  Our net worth is only about $10 million, and our income from investments and assets is only about $500,000 or so.  However, we are by no means going hungry any time soon. <br /> <br />My parents began earning their own wealth long before the Rich Dad books were published, and regardless of whether I had read them or not, my family would still be financially independent. <br /> <br />What I can say is this.  Though I don't personally agree with everything that Kiyosaki says in his books, I will say that alot of the fundamental ideas/concepts that he espouses in his book series are solid. <br /> <br />My father educated all the children in our family in the use and power of money.  And though the terms used were not the same, the concepts were. <br /> <br />1)  Education doesn't make you rich. <br />2)  Only money from investments makes you truly independent. <br />3)  Leverage is the key to success in finance, whether it's human, financial, or time leverage. <br />4)  Being wealthy is only a mindset. <br />5)  Money = freedom. <br />6)  Knowledge and experience is the only true currency. <br /> <br />Now, for those missing the last one, let me clarify this.  My father put it this way.  A rich man is rich not because of his bank account, but because of his mind.  You can strip all the wealthy people in the world of their money, and most of them will still become financially independent and wealthy again.  A rich man doesn't need money to become wealthy, they will find a way to earn/invest/build and become wealthy regardless. <br /> <br />What is meaningful about this series of books is not that it provides a \\"guide\\" of steps, but that they are useful in focussing one's mind intoa set of goals and finding a PATH to reach those goals. <br /> <br />It's not about the techniques, it's not about the methods, it's about finding a PATH to achieve what you want. <br /> <br />If you want to find your way to a place, you start with the destination then work out the route.  Not the other way around.  The same applies to money and financial independence. <br /> <br />In the end, the only thing that seperates the rich from the poor is the desire, focus, and drive to do what is necessary. <br /> <br />Finally, all the children in my family completed University, one has an MBA, all 3 of us work/have worked at the management level of various corporations/businesses.  None of us need to work.  Those of us who work for others, do so because we enjoy the work or desire to provide community service.  Not to menation that retirement at a young age is severely over-rated. <br /> <br />And for those of you who can't see who your real opponent is, I can only wish you luck.  You'll need it.
B000002IST|5.0|As a trio, Phil Collins, Mike Rutherford and Tony Banks had a part of Genesis of 20+ years.  In 1986, their previous album was their most commercially successful collection \\"Invisible Touch\\".  Meanwhile Phil was having a highly successful solo career while Mike was now finding success with his own band Mike and the Mechanics.  Still we may never know if they planned on 1991's \\"We Can't Dance\\" being their last album as a trio.  Either way, Genesis once again defines the rules for what their album should be and it results in this turning out to be 1992's Best Album of the Year (it was released at the end of 1991 and had its impact the following year). You will also hear Phil and Mike incorporate some of the elements they did on their side projects into this album while Tony Banks keeps the roots of Genesis alive. <br /> <br />When I look at Genesis as band, I see four distinct phases the band has gone through.   Phase 1 is the Peter Gabriel Era.  This spans from 1969 (\\"From Genesis to Revelation\\") to 1974 (\\"The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway\\").   It was during Phase 1 that Peter Gabriel was the lead vocalist and Genesis could easily be categorized as a progressive Rock band.   Phase 2 is the Early Phil Collins Era spanning from 1976 (\\"A Trick of the Tail\\") to 1982 (\\"Three Sides Live\\").  In this era, Phil Collins took over as lead singer.   The band was still very much a progressive rock band, but as the progressive rock landscape would change - so would Genesis.  This might indirectly have led to Phase 3 which is the Late Phil Collins Era from 1983 (\\"Genesis\\") to 1993 (\\"The Way We Walk Volume 2: The Longs\\").    At this point, there would be a lot less progressive rock flavor to Genesis' music.   The fourth phase, Phase 4 is the Ray Wilson Era.  This was when Ray Wilson took over as lead vocalist for Phil Collins.   There would only be one album in this era - 1997's  \\"Calling All Stations\\" and it seemed like Genesis tried to recapture some of their progressive rock roots -but 90s style. \\"We Can't Dance\\" was the last album of Phase 3. <br /> <br />In a lot of ways, the album title is appropriate (even though its a spin on the song \\"I Can't Dance\\").  I don't think Genesis ever planned on being \\"pop\\" stars - especially Mike and Tony.   However, if they were going to be pop stars they were going to do it their own way.  Yes, this collection does have some songs tailor-made for Top 40 radio (\\"I Cant Dance\\", \\"Hold on Your Heart\\", \\"Jesus He Knows Me\\"), but many of the songs do not.  There are four songs on this collection that are over 6 minutes long resulting in over 71 minutes of music on one disc.  <br /> <br />Here is a quick song by song synopsis: <br /> <br />\\"No Son of Mine\\" - not your traditional pop song.  One of the 6+ minute numbers  This deals with a very personal and troubled Father-Son relationship.  Mike had done \\"The Living Years\\" about his father, so this could have been the antithesis of that song. <br /> <br />\\"Jesus He Knows Me\\" - more of the \\"fun\\" side of Genesis.  We see this a lot with Phil and we saw this with \\"Illegal Alien\\".  This song reflects many of the scandals of the TV preachers that occurred during that time. <br /> <br />\\"Driving the Last Spike\\" - longest and best song of the collection.  Terrific song about England's railway workers.  Phil Collins had starred in the movie \\"Buster\\" a few years before, and this was an area that greatly interested him.  This proved the trio can do the \\"epic\\" song that is a trademark of many of their albums. <br /> <br />\\"I Can't Dance\\" - Weakest song of the set.  Very pop-ish.  Despite being appropriate for the album title, I don't think this is a good song.  <br /> <br />\\"Never a Time\\" - This is a pop song, but it still is a very good song. <br /> <br />\\"Dreaming While You Sleep\\" - Very underrated song on the collection.  This is over 7 minutes long.  Incorporates bits of progressive elements.  Phil Collins' drums are incredible in this song. <br /> <br />\\"Tell Me Why\\" - Sounds a lot like Phil Collins' \\"...But Seriously\\" work, but still is very good.  This song looks at sociological problems of the world. <br /> <br />\\"Living Forever\\" - Very good track.  Again, probably didn't fit into the mold of Top 40 radio.  Terrific guitar work by Mike and some nice harmonies and instrumentals are incorporated. <br /> <br />\\"Hold on Your Heart\\" - Probably the other weak song on the collection.  Sounds a lot like a Phil Collins ballad. <br /> <br />\\"Way of the World\\" - Terrific track and one of the best written. Incorporates a lot of analogies into the song to look at the problems of the world.  This track should have gotten more respect. <br /> <br />\\"Since I Lost You\\" - a slower song, but again seems out of the mold of a traditional pop song.  It's a nice change of pace.  There are also some nice harmonies in this song. <br /> <br />\\"Fading Lights\\" - Very appropriate song given this would be the trio's last song together.   Has a lot of elements of Genesis from their progressive days (long instrumental)  Perfect swan-song for the trio. <br /> <br />All of the lyrics are included in the liner notes.   There is an appropriate two sentence intro to \\"Driving the Last Spike\\".  The collection seems weaker in terms of the production credits.  Genesis might have crossed the line to Pop Musicians, but this proves that Genesis can operate in this genre and do it their own way.  This album produced some of the best music in 1992 and deserved Album of the Year consideration.  I find it ironic that had this album been released 3 years later, it might have bombed (this is because the music landscape would change drastically).  I highly recommend this collection.
B0002XH9Z4|5.0|And the winner \\"for best album of all time\\" is....Michael Jackson! <br /> <br />I just received it when I pre ordered it. Its amazing. Michael Jackson: I support you.
B000062YAY|3.0|First off, I am a huge Slayer fan and Dave Lombardo is one of my drumming heroes. <br /> <br />This album is great, but not very tight. Two songs are actually pretty horrific to listen to: War Ensemble and Angel of Death on disc 1. On WE, Lombardo is a little off with his ride cymbal until he hits the section with the fast double bass - then he is way off. In AoD, the section from the dueling solos to the end of the song sounds kind of like a trainwreck. However, these tunes were recorded near the end of Lombardo's first run with Slayer and at that time he and the rest of the band weren't getting along very well and his drum tech was not setting up his drums properly. (That's also why the double bass break in AoD sounds uneven.) As bad as Lombardo played on those two tunes, they are  actually neat little pieces of Slayer's history.   <br /> <br />With that said, the rest of the album rocks. It's nothing they haven't done live before but what more can you want in a Slayer show! <br /> <br />\m/ Slayer! \m/
B0002OERI0|5.0|I just read a couple reviews from a couple Green Day fans who appropriately rate this album low from the viewpoint of never wanting a band to change, always wanting the same old same old.  Well, being a real person who likes to have some variety in life as well as ever escalating challenges to overcome - I can relate to why Green Day has come back to the scene with something new and fresh, yet not unlike them.  This album is simply fantastic from start to end.  Just like with everything new, the first few listens can leave you feeing a bit alienated.  However, each time I listen I find new reasons why this is likely to be one of the best albums of the decade thusfar. But don't take my word for it - listen for yourself and give it a well deserved chance.
B0002Z0EYK|5.0|This movie is AMAZING... another epic adventure/ romance/ action right up there with Gladiator and Lord of the Rings! <br /> This is one of my favourite movies of the year... <br /> <br />I would definitely recommend owning this one!
0805076476|5.0|I found Palahniuk's almost disregard for straight-forward story telling thrilling.  The Narrator's sardonic view on everything very refreshing along with Tyler Durden's utmost disrespect for authority. <br /> <br />Everything in this novel is very original.  The twist, though I've seen it in the movie first, is still surprising.  More surpising in the novel than the movie, I think. <br /> <br />I would recommend this to everyone over the age of 16.  Enjoy!
B00006RU5B|5.0|From cochise, to set it off, to shadow on the sun, to getaway car and finally the last remaining light this album evokes so much emotion.  You feel energy euphoria and everything in between when you listen to this album.  Cornell's voice is so unbelievable in its beauty and range.  Sometimes I think its two different people singing on different songs because of the different characters he takes on in different songs.  This album is everything i've ever wanted to hear in an album.  Every single song is amazing.  I've been listening almost everyday for 6 months and I'm still not sick of it.
B0002OERI0|5.0|I'm 50 years old and had never heard any Green Day until this one. Most of my music is \\"classic rock\\" i.e. from the 70's and this album blew me away. It's also one of my 12 year old son's favorites. I've had the disc in the car for a while now and just keep playing it over and over. My wife took it out and I put it back in. The only down side is I have to listen to this one LOUD and I've had a few strane looks from people when the car windows are down. Can't recommend this one enough!
B0000020C4|5.0|It's incredible indeed what people will say to excuse Ms. Ruffelle's less-than-adequate performances in the musical.  Does being \\"a poor, beaten down and immature young girl\\" require that the actor playing Eponine in the musical have speech problems, an ugly singing style, and the inability to hit notes properly? <br /> <br />How can the audience get the nuances of her character when they can't even understand what she's singing?  So now, if one articulates well and sings clearly for the audience to understand the lines, the actor over-enunciates?  Ms. Salonga delivering a \\"happy\\" performance? Huh?  <br /> <br />Someone is definitely off his meds... ha ha ha!
B00065JTBA|5.0|Bon Jovi, Unreleased Songs, and Demos - OH MY!! <br /> <br />These demos and unreleased songs are a wonderful surprise. I was expecting to like it (huge Bon Jovi fan) but I didn't realize how much these songs would affect me.  <br /> <br />Highly recommended if you are a Bon Jovi fan or a fan of music. It gave me a much greater appreciation for how much work went into each song and each album. It is fascinating to see parts of and the progression of songs I know so well. I also enjoyed listening to each band member take the lead vocals. They each have a unique voice and style - but they are all wonderful.  <br /> <br />There are tracks that have dialog from the studio, songs that are obvious fore-runners to the released versions and a DVD that shows the guys in the band talking about the songs, when they wrote them, and the album they were left off of and why. I have heard there are Easter eggs, but haven't looked for them yet (too busy listening to the CDs). <br /> <br />I love that that Bon Jovi put this together for us, the fans. <br /> <br />FYI ... I got mine at Target for less than $30 <br />
B0004Z33G4|3.0|Wow, not a double dip but a triple dip. The Rambo movies are super movies, going slightly downhill with each sequel. All three are good. <br /> <br />So, here we are again, a new batch of DVDs for the series. The first set was awful. The second set which I own is quite good. Video quality and audio are superb on the second set. The second set comes in a tin case and it's called 'Special Edition\\". I guess in retrospect, it should have been called the \\"Pretty good, but there's more\\" edition because that's what it was. <br /> <br />With the superb quality of the Special Edition set, I can only really guess that the extras are the only thing worth making the upgrade for. For current Special Edition owners like myself, we can lok forward to (read: be pissed that Artisan held out on us) the following features: <br />1) Stallone commentary <br />2) Unseen suicide ending to First Blood <br />3) Other misc. stuff <br /> <br />So, worth the upgrade? No. <br /> <br />If you don't have the Special Edition set, you may want to pick this up. But for us Special Edition suckers, oops, I mean owners...Why bother. We can just pick up the super-duper-awesome edition in another year, then the HD version the year after that, and then finally the super-duper HD version, and then the........

All this book does is fatten the bank account of an egotistical maniac who provided advice and input on a terrible TV show about a bunch of women with low self esteem who liked to sleep around.  Save your money, or better yet, spend it on a book that is actually very well written: \\"Get Smart With Your Heart\\" by Suzanne Lopez.

But you also get the first two in a long <br />line of hits with Mama Kin and Dream On. This two songs are <br />actually arguable the best that they did. There are a few <br />solid other tracks like One Way Street and Write Me a Letter. <br />True, the other few tracks are fillers... But Dream On and <br />Mama Kin are worth the price alone.

B000002H6C|5.0|One of the best heavy metal albums and one of the greatest records of all time.........Metallica showed the world and their loyal fans what they can really compose and how they can just simply blow your mind away !!!! Recruiting Jason Newsted as their bassist after Cliff Burton's untimely death, the band recorded one of the most complex heavy metal albums of all time in terms of lyrics and composition !!! Everything from the album cover to the riffs and solos played by Kirk and James kick ass !!!Lars and Jason are truly phenomenal!!The album is all about the corruption  and the rape of mankind's justice...wars and battles based on false beliefs and the \\"Us and Them\\" relationship taking away the  lives of innocent millions.Metallica still plays some of the songs live on stage and gets the crowd in a totally frenzied state.......songs like \\"Blackened\\", \\"Harvester of Sorrow\\" and the classic pyro driven\\"One\\" remind us old school Metallica fans what the band really used to be !! Its really sad to see their talents decay and deviate to a form of radio friendly genre after the release of the crappy St Anger.  <br />My favourite songs from the album are the title song, \\"Frayed Ends of Sanity\\" and \\"Blackened\\". This album is their last real heavy metal work....(unless you like the Black Album, which is a great hard rock album in my view).Very few bands have the ability to produce anything like this. Metallica had really proved at that stage in time that they had perfected heavy metal.However,they deviated from their head crunching metal thrashing to a softer but less mature sound...Hope that Rob Trujillo can help the band release a true metal album like ...Justice for all, and prove all the haters wrong who claim that the band has sold out ....
B00004WIBW|4.0|Johnny Depp (Pirates Of The Caribbean, Secret Window) stars as Ichabod Crane who is sent to the town of Sleepy Hollow to investigate murders in which the victims head is cut clean off. The town tells of a headless horseman who searches the town for his head so that's why he takes people's heads for himself..to find his. Soon Depp digs deep into the towns past secrets about the headless horseman, Ray Park (plays the horseman without its head and starred in Stars Wars Episode 1 The Pahntom Menace and X-Men). Back in one of the wars the  evil horseman, Christopher Walken (plays the horseman with his head on and starred in Catch Me If You Can and The Prophecy) , is killed and his head is cut off. Depp also in the process falls in love with the beautiful Christina Ricci (Addams Family Values, Pumpkin). Also Depp has flashbacks to the murder of his mother with a very memorable scene where his mother pops out and blood flies out with her. Not a scary movie but it's a pretty entertaining flick and Tim Burton is at the top of his form trying to figure out clever ways to chop heads off. Also starring Miranda Richardson (The Crying Game, Spider), Ian McDiarmid (everysingle Star Wars movie), Christopher Lee (Lord OF The Trings Trilogy, Gremlins 2) and Casper Van Dien (Starship Troopers, Modern Vampires). Depp is hilariously brilliant.
B000667GFK|3.0|First, let us remember that this album is to introduce Mexican music to the world. It is also a tribute to Mexican music. It looks like Luis Miguel is heavily influenced by Javier Solis. <br />Before analyzing the cd I would like to recommend it to those who are not familiar with Mexican music. Does Luis Miguel forget that hispanics know almost every song by heart and is the standard mariachi repertoire? Unless your budget permits you, save your money. Excellent vocals but were missing something. Mariachi arrangements were some of the best in the genre. Comparing it to , say, Alejandro Fernandez-AF-, this album is more mariachi than the latter. AF is more of a pop mariachi and arrangements are too pop that they even limit the trumpet sound unlike this one which is MORE mariachi. However this cd brings nothing new to the mariachi genre except exposure: thus 3 stars. <br />Luis Miguel had the right mariachi and wrong arranger: Armando Manzanero. He should have gotten Ruben Fuentes or even the great Maguellanes. Vargas is an excellent mariachi but it needs an excellent arranger. He used Vargas arranger as well but still could have gotten a better one. <br /> <br />El Viajero- I have not heard the original. This song has good lyrics and good arrangements. Supposedly Armando Manzanero heard this song in a contest. Its author wrote it as a homage to Pope JOhn Paul II's piligrimage to Mexico. The original song, as one reviewer notes below, can be found in a link noted below. <br /> <br />Entrega Total- Javier Solis made this song famous. The original has an organillero arrangement and offered more to mariachi arrangements than what this cd being reviewed did. <br /> <br />Echame a mi la culpa - A Javier Solis hit. The one on this cd sounds 'nicer'.  Javier SOlis sounded like he lived it. The one on this cd is for the commercial world. <br /> <br />Mexico en la piel- very pretty. however, comparing it to the original arrangements, again, the original has more to offer. <br/>Cruz de Olvido- Another classic ranchera. Nothing new to offer. good vocals. good arrangements. <br /> <br />De Que manera te olvido- again, another classic. Made famous by Vicente Fernandez. good vocals. VF sounds much rawer and with more feel. This song is mostly exposure. <br /> <br />Luz de Luna- beautiful song made famous by Javier Solis. This version sounds prettier than the original. <br /> <br />Motivos- This song was made famous by some trio. However, Vicente Fernandez resurected it. This version is the best outthere and could have reached excellence if it included a trio chorus as in VF's version. LM dedicated this song to his mom.According to him, it was his mom's favorite. <br /> <br />Cielo Rojo- another classic. I was waiting for a falsetto. The vocals were great but it did not shine. Again, ranchera commercilized. <br /> <br />Paloma Querida-of course, JAM classic. JAM wrote this song for one of his wives. Paloma QUerida was a Jorge Negrete Classic. I love the Negrete version better. However this one is pretty. <br /> <br />Que seas Feliz- this one was another Javier Solis hit. compared to JS version, this one is just missing the women chorus. Again, LM is not doing anything to mariachi music. In terms of voice it is good. However, the older JS brought more to the mariachi world.Written by the author of besame mucho. <br /> <br />Un Mundo Raro- JAM classic who himself made it a hit. made more famous by Vicente Fernandez. <br />Sabes una Cosa- Another Javier Solis classic. <br /> <br />I've noticed that most of LM's mariachi songs are from Javier Solis hit interpretations ( Y?, La media vuelta, amaneci en tus brazos). Either way this cd is a well done cd. however, it did not contribute nothing to mariachi in terms of music. It 's purpose though is more of a hommage and exposure of Mexican music ( hence the Mexican flag in the cd) Enjoy .
B00014K5TQ|5.0|McCauley Culkin received some bad reviews for his portrayal of Michael Alig.  I might pose that those reviewers are unfamiliar with how over-the-top club kids were in the 80's.  What has been construed as bad acting is really an excellent parrotting of bad living.  The slow and subtle progression from all fun and games to madness and horror was excellently done and I think this is an excellent, honest chronicle.
B0002OERI0|5.0|I've been a Green Day fan for as long as I can remember now, and their latest offering is, in my opinion, the best album they've ever produced.  This album stays true to their edgy and fun nature, but it also shows us a new mature side we haven't seen before.  The entire album follows a story of sorts, something that few bands of today have tried to do, and the story is well told through excellent lyrics and brilliant music.  The album is great to listen to for the music alone, but it's even better if you listen to the story as it unfolds and get the true experience intended.<br /><br />\\"American Idiot\\" is a big and bold step for Green Day, and I say without hesitation that it paid off in a huge way.  This album has something for everyone, whether you just want to hear good music or if you're looking for something a few notches above the average rock album; whether you've been a Green Day fan from the beginning or if you've just started following them, I highly reccomend it.
B00003CX8N|3.0|This is a nice movie if you are the bland sort and only superficially into literature; if you are expecting anything pithy or deep or profound or edgy to be said about literature, you will be disappointed.  Even a bland, Republican, high school english teacher would get deeper than the dialogue allows Bancroft and Hopkins. Imagine the feast if Pinter had written the screenplay!!  But if you thought Field of Dreams was authentic, sincere, and a walloping good movie, you will like this smarmy, sadly lame film.
B0000041LL|5.0|Five stars are not enough. If Amazon had the equivalent of the Penguin guide's rossettes, this would get a double rossette!. <br /> <br />The warmth of tone, precise execution, excellent ensemble, and inspired interpretations from the Quartetto Italiano make for the most richly rewarding experience avaialbe to the string quartet listener.

0465043550|5.0|This is another in a series of books written by Benoit Mandelbrot that deserves to have a 6 star rating.The current foundation of practically all financial analyses ,excepting the \\"safety-first\\"approach of Roy and Charnes and Cooper,is the mean-variance(standard deviation)approach which is incorporated into more advanced versions such as the capital asset pricing model(capm)and the Black-Scholes options pricing model for puts and calls.All of these models assume that all price movements in all financial markets are approximately the same small size,are independent of each other,are homogeneous and satisfy the law of large numbers and the central limit theorem.This leads directly to the assumption that all price movements can be modeled as(as if)being normally distributed.The reader should note that practically all classical and neoclassical economic theory is currently based on subjective expected utility(SEU)theory which bases much of its practical results on the applicability of the normal probability distribution.The entire argument made by Milton Friedman and Robert Lucas,jr.,that all false trading(contracting)at disequilibrium(nonequilibrium)prices cancels out in the long run over time ,is based on the claim that such price movements are normally distributed around the market clearing equilibrium price.This equilibrium market clearing price is automatically interpreted as being the mean of a normal probability distributiion.Such a price is thus an optimal price since the average of a normal probability distribution is also the maximum outcome possible.The entire claim that price adjustments  lead to an optimal outcome in all(private sector) markets means that the socalled\\"INVISIBLE HAND\\"of the market is nothing more than a normal probability distribution.Any type of skewed and/or nonnormal distribution of price movements means automatically that such adjustments do not lead to an optimal outcome.Mandelbrot has thrown down the gauntlet,not only to the current purveyors of basic risk management,portfolio analysis,but to much of the economics profession as well.Mandelbrot does this by simply presenting massive amounts of empirical evidence showing that the commodity,futures,money,stock,and other markets price movements are not generally normally distributed.All of Mandelbrot's research has been replicated and duplicated by many other researchers in many other countries besides the USA.Since the mid-fifties,Mandelbrot has carefully and patiently presented his results in a series of widely cited scholarly articles and books.In this book,Mandelbrot has decided to take his case directly to the general public.The book is straightforward and easy to read and absorb.The only technical knowledge needed by a reader is some basic familiarity with the  normal distribution and an understanding of the basics of calculating a Z-score.I can't recommend this book too highly.
B000001GXB|5.0|I fondly remember the time I bought the distinctive green LP box set of these recordings in the late 1970s.  <br /> <br />I was not very familiar with the Beethoven piano sonatas. I made many attempts to try them out by auditioning the local library copies by well known artists, or whatever there was in the scant record collection at the college radio station music library. All to no avail. The music just didn't click for me. <br /> <br />I read some of the rave reviews about these Pollini recordings for a few months, so one day I just decided to bite the bullet and buy the LP box set. I was determined that if I'd give all the works in it enough thorough and attentive listening, I would understand why the music is so loved by so many. <br /> <br />Well, it didn't take much determination. From the first beat of op. 101, I got hooked. Pollini's unusual combination of high energy and contrasting effective tenderness made the music come alive for me. <br /> <br />When I got to the famous op. 106 \\"Hammerklavier\\", I must have replayed it 4 times the first night.  <br /> <br />The LPs were worn out quickly. Actually, I liked them so much I took even more care than I normally would, and I was pretty picky about LP care in those days. I was not about to see these LPs get thrashed! <br /> <br />Time has brought me around to appreciate the Beethoven 32 in ways that I never thought I could. I now treasure such notables as Kempff, Arrau, Brendel, and many more. Pollini seems somewhat excessive in comparison to most of the artists I now revere in this reportoire. But there is room for much interpretation in Beethoven, and I find myself returning to these Pollini recordings often just to remeber how much more there is to these pieces than is often rendered in more \\"classical\\" and accepted interpretations. <br /> <br />Severely disappointed was I when these recordings first appeared on CD in the 1980s. The first CD versions were dreadfully riddled with a resonant twang that marredvirtually every movement in every sonata at some point. The LPs were OK, but this music, especially with the high dynamic contrast of Pollini's playing, demand hushed quiet to be appreciated. CDs psomised some that hushed quietness, being free from crakcles, hiss, and so on. But the timber of the piano was very unnatural. Listening to those CDs was very painful. <br /> <br />Once again, DG have redeemed themselves by remastering these spectacular analogue recordings in the late 1990s to give us what have before us now. The Originals series continually give us CDs that approach the warmth and naturalness of analogue LPs. Thanks Universal. Give us more. <br /> <br />After reviewing many releases in the Originals series though, it is time I do criticize DG about one aspect in their reissues that is not \\"Orgiinal\\". The liner notes. Like most of the other releases in the series, there are virtually no notes about the works themselves. The only notes are about the performer, in this case Pollini, and perhaps the performers' affinity for the music on the disk, or something special about the particular recording. In this case, the original LP box set had excellent essays about the late sonatas. I read them several times, and picked more insights with each reading. The lack of notes about the works on the disk make it difficult to recommend any items in the Originals series as first choices for collectors that are not going to buy multiple versions. But that is exactly what these should be. So get with it, Universal, and next time give us ALL of the Originals, inculding the notes.
B00005JNEI|5.0|The first time I saw this movie, I wept.  The second time I saw it, I laughed and then got angry.  A couple more times, and I became motivated to change our great country.  Sure, there may be more substantive leftie documentaries out there, but Moore's effort stands out as a great piece of art.  This deserves all the accolades it gets (as well as all the conservative jeers, because it skewers their beloved leaders so aptly).  Buy it.
B00005JMAH|3.0|let me start off by saying that i've read this book at least 20 times, so it's fair to say i'm a fan and that i know the flow of events. it was my favorite of the first 3 books... <br /> <br />first, the \\"story\\" was poorly done. it seems like they cut the book up into scenes and pulled 25 or 30 out of a hat, and arranged them in that order. and then made up some \\"original\\" scenes of poor quality to make up for leaving so much out. this film could have been a half hour longer without getting complaints from anyone. the first film was 2.6 hours long, the second was only slightly shorter. i'm not happy at all with the story. they made up way too much, and switched around even more, and buzzed through the story without explaining the necessary things.. too much was left out. shame on this new director, and shame on rowlings for approving it <br /> <br />second, the acting... only one complaint here... DUMBLEDORE! ...it wasn't the same, he didn't even look or act remotely the same. he looked like an aging hippie, nothing like sir harris's Dumbledore. he acted like an autistic child, utterly devoid of the warmth and wisdom of the first two films... the kids on the other hand, are shining stars in the world of potter. can't complain there. professor trelawney was right on point compared with the book <br /> <br />3rd, the direction... the directing style was interesting. i liked the darker feel, but when coupled with the altered storyline, it was very frustrating <br /> <br />the visuals... are interesting as well. i like the dark style. i felt like the werewolf could have stood a few more rounds in the animation studio. he was scrawny and bald. just the word \\"Werewolf\\" brings to mind strength and raw power, supernatural musculature (see the movie \\"underworld\\" for better renditions of werewolves) lupin's werewolf was just scrawny and pathetic.. on the other hand, the dementors were spot on. well animated, designed and scary ...but then, the whomping willow was way too small, hogwarts was located in an entirely different place, hagrid's hut was half a mile from the castle, it was just all wrong... i'm all for creative liscense, but when you have a structure already mapped out by 2 previous films, then the only thing you're going to accomplish by scrapping it is disorientation, frustration and anger <br /> <br />overall, this movie could have been a lot better. this was more like \\"an interpretation of harry potter and the prisoner of azkaban\\" or, \\"a highly abridged telling of harry potter and the prisoner of azkaban\\"... i feel like i'm still waiting for the rest of the movie. i wanted at least 2 hours and 45 minutes out of it... if rowlings pulls a peter jackson with some \\"extended editon\\" nonsense, she'll have a lot more pissed off fans than she does now.. just get chris columbus back and it'll be ok jo!
B00063EMJG|2.0|This is not a release for loyal fans.This is a \\"Cash-In-At-Christmas\\" CD for fans who never bought past \\"Harvest\\" and only know subsequent releases from Classic Rock radio. This is a middle-of-the-road, take-no-chances greatest hits collection that is more befitting Kenny Rogers than someone who once proclaimed \\"This Note's for You.\\" Where's the reward for the loyal fan? Not even a single, never-released cut! He claims the selection was based in part on downloads. Somehow I can't believe \\"Comes a Time\\" was downloaded more than \\"Roll Another Number for the Road.\\" This is the third time some of these have been released. The SACD version adds sound quality but how much do you really think can be done to 35-year-old recordings? I've already forgotten what's on the DVD. Yes, folks, the once great Mr. Soul has lost his stones. The only rocking he seems ready for is in a rocker next to Mr. Stills at the Buffalo Springfield Old Folks Home. They can trade stories until bedtime. The same ones they told the night before. There should be a \\"Safe and Harmless\\" sticker on the CD. However, I do like the cover shot of Neil backstage at the Filmore. It reminds me of the time when Neil and his audience mattered to each other.
B0002Z9HT8|5.0|There were a slew of blistering performances to open the concert- Status Quo, Style Council, Boomtown Rats and Ultravox. I think that Ultravox's \\"One Day\\" was perhaps the best single performance. Unfortunately, this song was not included in the Ultravox set on the DVD. If you taped the shows, give this one a play. I suspect that 1.5 billion viewers might have contributed to the emotional intensity of those opening acts; after all, nobody in history had ever performed for such a large TV audience. <br />Even with some important performances missing, these DVDs are getting a lot of play time in my house. They are jam-packed with stunning performances by well-known and less well-known artists.
