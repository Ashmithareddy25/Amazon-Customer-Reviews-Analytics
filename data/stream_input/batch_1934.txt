B009ZXT4BY|5.0|this is a great game but for the demo you should make the time longer unlimited. just don't give us all the blocks we can build with. its better than minecraft pocket edition too
B005CRY2O6|3.0|These recipes are delicious (especially the on right on the cover) but I have to say some of the ingredients are a little hard to find. If you good at substitutions, this is a great book for those looking for veggie courses of all types for all occasions. There are a lot of preparation ideas that I've never thought of so it's helped me incorporate more veggies into my diet that aren't just salads.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|Arrived quickly.  Couldn't find this in the stores at Christmas time.  Had been waiting for this to come out in order to watch it in the order it was meant to be watched in.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Real good game.but I didn't see where it says demo cause you play half and get into it then u gotta pay to finish
B00AMBLXP8|4.0|This movie had some very funny parts in it and was overall enjoyable. It is definitely not suitable for kids.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Pinterest is great!! I love it so much I use it everyday. it's easy to use and quick I used it for Christmas gift ideas for my family.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I didnt think I would ever find a book I liked as much as Slammed and POR.  Wrong,  this one is right there with those two.  It was better then I expected and I had pretty high expectations.  She hit another home run with this one.  Cant wait for her next book.
B008JFUUIA|5.0|great movies &#60;3 came fast and was so funny great movie should get it from here no one els &#60;3.
B009CG2YDE|5.0|this is a fun 1980 style game. It's  fun graphics are a little weak but at the same time that's part of the 1980s feel to the game.
B00AMBLXP8|5.0|This movie was hysterical. I have been waiting to see it & it was worth the wait. Watched it twice.....once with hubby, next with friends. Laughed my butt off each time.
B000VDDDVO|5.0|It's a Wonderful Life is a much watch on Christmas Eve at our house.. this 2 disc set is wonderful. We haven't watched the colored version yet but the b&w is great! This movie will make you cry, laugh, and really come to find the true spirit of Christmas. Can't beat the price either!
B00AIQP9DE|1.0|I like this game but after I exit the next time I go to play it sits on a blank page until I exit...
B0060D123K|5.0|One of my favorite Christmas movies of all time and I am happy to have it digitally. The songs are catchy and the muppets are always hilarious. Great movie!
B005LAIH4A|5.0|This is such a great movie, not just for kids but their parents as well. My son (6 months) is always so inteiged with the colorful scenes and the fun songs
B004U52VPS|5.0|The Angry Birds game is a lot of fun for our little guys.  They love setting the pieces up, freeform of course, then they do their best to knock them all down with their favorite birds.  They have a great time trying to stump each other and compete to see who can make the best Angry Birds sound effects as they play.  This is a great toy simply because it provides the kids with physical pieces they can use to mimic one of their favorite Apps.  We have actually never followed the rules or used the cards.  We all just enjoy the opportunity to have creative fun with this toy.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|So far it's challanging. Sucks to have to pay for full version when advertised as free but I think it's worth it. The more difficult the better. Love the graphics. So far I'm enjoying it a lot.
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|My son wanted this for Christmas and he watched it Christmas day while playing with his polar express train.  I never really liked the movie, but my son loves it.
1451696191|1.0|Pardon me, but a simpering teen who cries frequently & wants to be a writer in spite of remedial language skills & sees a shrink & is so nice you often ponder a barf bag is not, not, not my cup o' tea.
B009HELT3C|5.0|I really like Men in Black 1 and 2, definitely one of my favorite series of movies. If you enjoy the other Men in Black movies, you will enjoy Men in Black 3 a lot.
0439023513|5.0|My son loves this book series!!! These are written well and the characters are well-developed. I will get a chance to read them when he is done!
B005FISBTO|4.0|- Brother Sam: \\"If you put your faith in the wrong thing, it can really ef you up.\\" (except Brother Sam didn't say \\"ef\\")<br /><br />DEXTER's Season Six gives you the awesome and gives you the suck. I do feel that this is the weakest season in the series. Not that I'll ever stop tuning in; I'm addicted to this show. Only, I'd never seen Edward James Olmos sleepwalk thru a role before. Even Steven Wright thinks Olmos is too understated.<br /><br />Catching up with our favorite serial killer: All is well in Dexter Morgan's corner of the world. He's moving on from his wife's bloody murder and from Lumen's abandoning him. He's very much a caring single parent - his kid's two now - and his job as blood spatter analyst at Miami Metro PD is fulfilling. And then there's his hobby... he hasn't given up gratifying his Dark Passenger. But Dexter's got his s*** together. As Season Six opens, he's off to attend his 20-year high school reunion. There, he busts a move to M.C. Hammer and plays flag football. He even gets lucky. But who're we kidding? Dexter is attending his high school reunion to target his next victim. Life is good for the Bay Harbor Butcher.<br /><br />This is the season wherein Dexter starts exploring religion. The charismatic Mos Def plays Brother Sam, murderous ex-con turned man-of-the-cloth who walks into Dexter's life and befriends him. Dexter is initially skeptical and dismissive and even targets him as a potential kill. But there's something about Brother Sam. Has he really turned a new leaf? Can he teach Dexter about the nature of faith? Mos Def turns in a mesmerizing performance.Even as Dexter seeks religious enlightenment, Miami Metro PD's Homicide Division investigates a series of grotesque killings that immediately assumes biblical connotations. How long before Dexter's spiritual quest collides with the Doomsday Killer's apocalyptic mission?<br /><br />This show has always been deliberately messy, but, yikes, the creep factor is off the chain this season. It's hard to pin down Colin Hanks' character. He's uneasy in his own skin. He's at war with himself, his reasoning self versus his very own Dark Passenger. However, I found myself wanting to skip ahead whenever the camera shifts to his and Olmos' narrative. Their dialogue is so heavy-handed. They just don't measure up to the show's past villains. Lithgow has set such lofty standards, it's ridiculous. Even Jimmy Smits from Season 3 brought a more commanding presence.<br /><br />Okay, off the top of my head, the unsatisfying stuff (and there's quite a bit): I didn't like that Louis the intern's arc never really goes anywhere. We have to wait until Season 7 for that to play out. In fact, even the blonde intern's arc pretty much fizzled early in the season. And ***Mild SPOILERS*** now for the rest of this paragraph: I wasn't buying it when the detectives insisted on waiting for Dexter before entering a crime scene. This allowed Dexter to be the first to step into the room in which the Doomsday Killer had drawn Dexter's likeness on a mural painting of the Devil. Needless to say, Dexter promptly made some cosmetic changes. With a hammer.<br /><br />And it's convenient, isn't it, that Angel Batista's sister had moved in next door to Dexter, this making it easier for Dexter to land a babysitter anytime he had to step out?<br /><br />And then there's that shift in Dexter and Deb's relationship, predominantly from Deb's perspective. It's a stunning revelation and it's cheapening. It undermines what has been a constant strength of the show: Dexter and Deb as a dysfunctional brother and sister pair who screws up a lot but nevertheless cares deeply for each other. This monumental reveal feels a bit insulting, as if the writers all of a sudden determined that the preexisting family dynamics weren't enough to anchor the show. That, more than anything else, is what's disappointing.<br /><br />I think whenever religion is introduced as a central theme, there's a concern that thetone may take on a certain heavy-handedness. Again, the scenes between Hanks and Olmos did nothing for me. There's also that telegraphed and pretty played-out plot twist concerning Olmos.<br /><br />I do like that Deb's arc plants her and the self-promoting LaGuerta more firmly in the spotlight. I love Jennifer Carpenter's rawness, her evocation of a broken but resilient woman. David Zayas is solid as Batista. He projects quiet reserves of strength. The show's weak link,Desmond Harrington's Detective Quinn, continues to be the poster boy for super-bland bad boys. C.S. Lee's lecherous Masuka keeps making me laugh. Michael C. Hall keeps doing the improbable, making his serial killer a lovable character. His inner monologues continue to make for a fascinating listen.<br /><br />Other folks had already mentioned this, but here it is one more time, just in case... Be aware that each of the 4 discs starts with a 2-minute promo that showcases several Showtime programs. Be aware that you cannot fast forward thru this promo or skip ahead to the menu. About a minute in, this promo reveals the shocking last scene of Season 6's final episode. It's a moment that fans had long been salivating for, and it just about salvages the entire season for me, a season which, by the way, feels more like a set-up for the next season. But now here's me backing down. As critical as I've been, I still love this show, love the cast, love the premise, love the final episode's jaw-dropping closing moment. So, 3.5 out of 5 stars for DEXTER Season 6.<br /><br />Anyway, the 12 episodes are on 4 discs, with Disc 4 containing these following bonus features:<br /><br />- Interviews with Michael C. Hall, Jennifer Carpenter, Lauren Velez, C.S. Lee, Colin Hanks, and Desmond Harrington<br />- Text Biographies<br />- Photo Gallery<br />- HOUSE OF LIES - episodes 1 & 2tone may take on a certain heavy-handedness.

B000W93CHC|5.0|There's a little big of everything in this book:  drama, love stories (and I normally don't like love stories, these aren't too smushy), wars, crimes, public punishments, death and taxes, kings and knights and serfs, monks who are bad, nuns that have lust (and not just for men), plagues, just a bunch of craziness I wouldn't think went on during the 1300s.
B00A9X9ORI|5.0|5 Stars because I enjoyed the world it set and the acting was very good. Nice change of pace from the usual crap that today's movies are.
B005HSL626|5.0|My son loves this and plays it all the time!! Fun game to play!!! Watch out though, it is highly addictive!!!!!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I'm the kind of person who knows what to say about almost everything. Yet, this book is just indescribable. I felt the whole journey through the three books, which I loved. It is so amazingly written. It's strong, powerful. It's really one of the best books ever written-and i don't care who disagrees. It's the truth. I loved this one more than the last two. I felt more emotion build up in this last one. It gives you more hope. The ending is just amazing- no it was Better than amazing. Way better. Yes, people will probably not be so sire about the last chapters until they read it completely through. That was my reaction. I was literally screaming at my kindle because of it, then I finished reading the epilogue and I was stunned. I know I keep rambling on and on about the ending- and I don't care. I recommend getting a copy of your own. It's one to have a hold of for yourself. It is definitely worth reading!
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|My family loves this movie! And I love what the movie teaches you. You have to believe. We watch this every year for Christmas. Next year I will have to actually by the DVD though.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book kept me interested throughout the entire story. It was suspenseful, brilliant, and refreshing. I would highly recommend this novel.
B00AJRQLTI|5.0|After watching the movie I could not wait to get home and download the sound track and it does not disappoint!!
B0062NAX1U|5.0|This movie is such a challenge for the dad's .  If men could take their rightful place in the raising of a child.  Dad's matter, and if they could know their importance in the upbringing of a child -<br />IF they do nothing else but follow the encouragement in this movie - kids would be better off
0756697875|5.0|I was looking for this book everwhere and found it on Amazon.com and my son loves it.  It's  really nice, my son is still reading it but really likes it.
B007K3JFUQ|5.0|A  fantastic  action thriller , I enjoyed the  story , scenery , locations , costumes and the special effects ! A movie you can watch again & again
B000KKPN5C|5.0|Far better than the built-in-flash for my Nikon D40.<br /><br />I use it with a diffuser to add a balanced light that fills the whole room.<br /><br />Tilting the flash upwards has effectively reduced red eye in my portraits.<br /><br />The flash also has a red eye reduction mode that is far less annoying that the beam of light released from the camera body.<br /><br />The flash uses AA batteries.  I bought rechargable batteries to use with this unit.  With a full charge, these batteries will power close to 100 photos.<br /><br />Overall, I've been very happy with this purchase.
B00AIQP9DE|3.0|This game is fun and makes you think long enough to be interesting but not so hard that it's frustrating.
B005LAIH3G|5.0|I don't care that this film was critically panned, and poorly advertised.<br />When it comes to Disney taking a big risk, and trusting Pixar people to do a live-action movie, this is a 'WIN,' in my column.<br />Action, cinematography, acting (Kitsch's best, I dare), and a splendid job by actress Lynn Collins (sigh...) make for a spectacular - if lightly flawed movie.<br /><br />There's a standoff in a Martian desert: one man-against-many. If you haven't seen it, you should *want to see it. That sequence, alone, makes the movie an instant buy, when i saw it in the theater.
B007HC3LHS|5.0|took some time to figure out where this was going--watch the dates!!  griping triller definately a good read..would recommend you read.
B000025QLX|5.0|In My Tree, Off He Goes, and Present Tense are some Pearl Jam's best work.  But I can listen to this entire album without skipping a single song.<br /><br />This album is tame compared to Vitalogy, and is more in line with their later work.
B005NWUSOI|4.0|couple good catchy songs, lots of energy if your feeling down just listen to this If you want to heading bang or dance or whatever weird s*** it is you do then this is the cd for you!
B0063IH60K|5.0|Plaid solitary on my hp and this is more fun because of colors. Easy to play.<br />I will be playing this all the time.
B0049VZ222|5.0|I love this show! The writing is superb and almost every episode leaves you gasping No! because you don't want it to end. Watching the characters grow and change as they are forced to make life and death decisions is intense. I wish there were more shows like The Walking Dead on TV.
B005LAIHR2|5.0|Got this for Christmas because my mom knew I loved 80's music I have watched it three times just this week! I can not get the songs out of my head so much so I went out and bought the soundtrack today. This is one of the best movies I have seen in a long time my husband who hates musicals loves it just as much as I do!!! If I could I would give it 10 stars!
B00005N6KG|5.0|I do not like ear buds to begin with and they would always fall out when I ran.. I decided to purchase these after reading the reviews and they are great! Sound quality is awesome and they are very light weight.. AND they do not fall out when you run!
B0099114WO|5.0|it was great, I like both of thiis actors.  Tommy Lee Jones is so good in this movie AND Meryl Streep cant be beat.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|This movie was awesome and a must have if you are into comics!  I highly recommend purchasing this DVD set.
B0099G7KDQ|5.0|I very rarely buy a whole cd because I usually never like all the songs but this is an exception. The whole cd is great. I even bought a second one as a gift. Amazon mp3 makes it so easy to give music instantly. I love it!
B0009XRZ9M|5.0|This comes with two dics (one has special features).. My boys LOVE this movie and like to watch it year round.. great price!!!!!
B00785P2QC|2.0|difficult to operate, I haven't taken the time to do research how to operate. wish it was more user friendly
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Can't wait to see the movie to see how it measures up. I couldn't put the book down, excited to start the next book!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This book series is amazing, it is simply riveting and kept me coming back for more every day! I recommend it to anyone who craves a great read :)
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Easy read. Read it in one day. Makes me want my Prince charming. Great romance book for waking up married!
B002VECM4A|5.0|Purchased a bad copy earlier and this replacement copy is just great. Got to see the whole movie finally. Will purchase future movies from this site.
B008G59IBI|5.0|It's not often that the best item in a trilogy comes last, but that is definitely the case with Tre!  I have listened to Green Day for years now, and was so impressed with American Idiot and 21st Century Breakdown that I planned on picking up these albums immediately upon release, something I rarely do.<br /><br />Uno was decent, although it seemed to have a lot of filler around the good tunes.<br /><br />Dos I listened to about 3 times and haven't wanted to go back.  It definitely felt to me like they wrote a bunch of tunes and decided to sell them all instead of just putting the best ones down, and I figured the best had already happened on Uno.<br /><br />If I thought so much less of Dos, I was worried just how bad I would think that Tre was.  I wasn't going to order it until I read a few reviews here that said that it was surprisingly good, and I figured that it was worth picking up.  I'm so glad that it did.<br /><br />This is the Green Day that took a huge step up for me with the two albums I named above.  It has a little of everything, and is the best sounding Green Day songs in a long time.  Standout songs are X-Kid, 99 Revolutions, the Forgotten and Dirty Rotten Bastards.  If Uno or Dos disappointed you, get this.  And if you didn't get either of those, get this first and decide if you want the others.  It's worth it!
B001A3CP5Y|5.0|5 great guitar artists together in one place.  I had this on cassette when it first came out and am now trilled to have these songs in my collection once again.  Try to have fun picking out who (Dylan, Petty, Harrison, Oribison, or Lynne) is singing at what time.  They switch so much it can be tricky.
0345803507|5.0|This book to me put the finishing touch to these book, but i'm glad Ana was the one that he fill in love with, because i dont think the out come would have been the same with Kate
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I loved this book. I really liked the main and the secondary characters. Loved the story. This book stayed with me for a long time after I read it which is the highest praise I can give a book. This is definitely one I would reread and I can't wait for Walking Disaster to come out.
B00A757EFW|5.0|I use to play PAC man in the 80's and it's still the best, thank u for bringing it back, PAC haven
B008RZHAAS|5.0|The album gets better each time I listen to it. I bought this album for my husband and my neice.
0345803493|5.0|This was the best one of all of the fifty shades trilogy, i knew they couldn't stay away from each other...I love Ana and Christian, and i can't wait for more to come
B00AQF8CJ0|4.0|fairly addictive. I like that the puzzles are a challenge but not impossible. no time limit is nice too. monsters are cute. lots of levels too.
1400067820|4.0|I HAVE ONLY JUST BEGUN READING THIS BOOK BUT IT IS EXTREMELY INTERESTING.  IT WAS EVEN MENTIONED IN ANOTHER BOOK I HAVE JUST FINISHED, &#34;THE ASCENT OF MONEY&#34; BY NIALL FERGUSON.
B009S8PEHY|3.0|I heard Stewart performing his Christmas music over my computer before I watched his Christmas TV special.  Stewart comes across better when you can watch him as well as hear him.  He has an easy, relaxed, crowd-pleasing style that enhances his rendition of the songs from his album.  I was disappointed in the lack of power and resonance in his voice.  Michael Buble's style and voice are more arresting.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I found found this book to corny and predictable. Anastasia Steele just sounds like a porn star name. Once I read all the other books I've ever wanted to read, then I will read the rest of the trilogy
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|I just LOVED the Movie!!! I had downloaded it on my Kindle to watch while in driving (I was the passenger) over Christmas<br />holiday. I would get the movie again and again. Funny!! Would recommend it if you liked Ironman Thor and the Hulk.
1908117230|4.0|I cannot vouch for the quality of the recipes on the book as I have yet to bake anything. I give this book four stars because it is poorly edited. It is obvious that ingredients have been unintentionally left out of the recipes and many of the page numbers for the links in the book haven't been included, instead reading \\"page 000\\". These things are incredibly frustrating to me when accessing a recipe.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|This novel is amusing, moving, badgering, and boisterous, keeping the reader mesmerized by the odd on-and-off relationship between a mentally disturbed young man and an equally disturbed attractive young woman.  The author's style is contagious. There may be a little too much dwelling on the Philadelphia Eagles (unless you are one of the team's rabid fans), but the troubled main character's family is one of those avid supporters, including a father who makes the week agonizing for his wife when the team loses.  Silver Linings Playbook is a rewarding, endearing book about memorable characters to share with friends.
B008OOYALE|5.0|An incredibly fun and interesting game. Great for relaxing your mind but challenging enough not to bore said users very good game.
B004O2AZHI|3.0|This blue ray was much cheaper than others offering it, but it turns out that they did not put in the product description that this disc only plays in Region B blue ray players, which means it only plays in European systems, and not in America, where I am. So unfortunately I have to send it back!
B000JHUTVO|5.0|I highly recommend this movie for family night.  There is plenty of action for the guys and some feely parts for the girls.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is the best app in the store! And I love it when I can take it on the go!
B003WUYRGI|2.0|I've learn that people should always think positive of there selves also love one another<br />I love LAFERRICK so much
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book ended abruptly. I couldn't wait to get the 2nd one. My husband loved me reading it too. Very good.
B003W5C0VW|4.0|Even in the 2010 Jagger interview included with this release Mick says he doesn't remember the band as this tight. While the sound quality and images are not up to 2013 standards there is plenty to hear, see and enjoy for the fan who wants to know why we old people love this band as much as we do.
B004YXE438|4.0|I enjoy jigsaws so having this available when I want it is wonderful and I haven't even used my own images yet!
B000KKPN5C|5.0|Purchased for use on a D7000.<br />In years past I've run with sets of lights and strobes such as the SB800's, but that's overkill with my current lifestyle.<br />The new SB-400 arrived, I put batteries in it, and stuck it on the D7000.<br />A few quick interior shots revealed that the SB-400 is a little gem that does great work.
B00AQ3K8IU|2.0|This kindle gift was disappointing and I'm only halfway through it.<br />I am not motivated to complete it. I don't recommend this for adult reading.
B0085KGHI6|5.0|For the Chicago blues greats as much as for the cigarette smoking guitar rifs of Keith and Ron. It is nice to see Jagger in awe of Muddy... again priceless.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Bought my new Kindle Fire and love love the option to play angry birds. Love my Kindle! Highly recommend getting one.
B0076DCT2G|4.0|Fast moving followup to the previous two political novels... The Lion and The Lions Games. Yemen  and its future are again in the news. And who is not surprized that the CIA, State Department and  Antii-terrorist organizations of the U.S. still can't co-operate and communicate and trust each other???
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This has been one of the best books I have read. I am so glad I came across it. With this many positive reviews I knew they couldn't be wrong. I absolutely loved it. I''m going to see what else she has wrote. Cause if this book was this great I can only imagine what the rest of her books will be.
B00009R6H2|1.0|I feel really bad that mislead buyers. in the picture are two and comes one in the package. I am not satisfied with the purchase
B001KQZ7I8|5.0|This is an amazing book. Once I picked it up I couldn't put it down. Would recommend to anyone who has an interest in psychology
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I chose this rating foremost because it works on my Windows 7 laptop, iPad 2 and off-brand, android tablet, which makes it highly portable like a physical notebook would be. I just use the free version, which has ads that are not too terribly obstructive. I share my anatomy and physiology notebook with my classmates using this program, too. I take pictures of the models in class, and have recorded test review lectures to refer to later for studying, too.<br /><br />So, I would recommend this to any student.<br /><br />That said, I gave this five stars because I cannot rate it 4.5 stars. I find picture taking slightly annoying in this program, since it is not always simple to exit out of that and you find yourself struggling to get past a new snapshot to continue note-taking in class. Also, due to that the Evernote auto spell-check does not recognize medical jargon, I have missed important notes trying to overcome that quickly, and I have to edit all my notes on my computer later because of that and also since I can then rotate my pictures. Finally, it is kind of a hassle to isolate pictures out of this program to put in compilation documents for printing later to study with colleagues.<br /><br />However, even with all these annoyances, I would still recommend this program to all students. It saves your notes to a cloud and then you sync your updates remotely to take your notes everywhere, but you share it by inviting people to specific notebooks. The aforementioned pluses far outweigh my complaints about it, which is why it gets 5 instead of 4 stars in an effort to be fair about it, after all.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|Really helps my baby and children fall asleep and stay asleep in a noisy environment! This has also helped my husband sleep during the day because he sometimes has to work nights.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I liked the story it keep me reading as I found it building up my curiosity as what was going to happen next. Too much sex for it to be realistic. Yes I would recommend it to my friends.
B0034G4P8A|4.0|It was surprisingly a good (comic book) film, even without having to lower one's standards.  Holds true to the comic despite having some adaptive elements.  Worth owning if you're aiming to collect the Avengers before they 'assembled' under Mr. Whedon.
160774273X|5.0|The gourmet bread baker of the family had researched this book an borrowed a copy from the library and wanted one of his own.  So this was a Christmas gift well received.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book took me four days and captivated me to the point of isolation, I couldn't put it down and all else was trivial compared to knowing the next step of Katniss Everdeen. Onward to Mockingjay!
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|Very well written. A great thriller/suspense novel. Definitely worth every dollar. Can't wait to read the next book in the series!
B0063IH60K|4.0|I really like this version of solitaire, however I prefer apps that come with a variety of solitaire games. That said, I really love the creative display when you win. They are a nice reward at the end.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|My experience with zombies had been limited to Dawn Of The Dead, Resident Evil and, of course, The Walking Dead.  So, I never really thought about the global epidemic that goes along with the dead coming back to life.<br /><br />Mr. Brooks has approached the zombie apocalypse from a new and fascinating angle; The global response.  The \\"war\\" covers the entire globe and is fought with everything from tanks to spears.<br /><br />Overall, I really enjoyed this book.  Everything from the characters to the technology was realistic and plausible.  Now to prepare for the war by reading the Zombie Survival Guide.
B008HT4FUW|5.0|I love all the people--upstairs and downstairs.  I keep pulling for Mary to finally achieve happiness.  Looking forward to Season 3 this weekend.
B0037HOWKW|5.0|he has build two of these, one as a gift in a display case and one for is own band display. they are intricate and very nice looking.
B0043WDK2G|5.0|This show has the episodic mystery and humor that one comes to expect and and enjoy. But the brilliant stories are the few but amazing storylines that are threaded through multiple seasons with little hints to much larger and more difficult mysteries. This season has unexpected twists. If you get this from amazon video expect to find yourself watching it straight through.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Highly entertaining story.  However, the ending spoiled it for me.  Otherwise, would have given it 5 stars.  Perhaps author is setting things up for a sequel?
0618918248|5.0|This book was purchased as a gift so it was important that it was received in good condition.  It arrived in a timely manner and was very securely packaged and in excellent, new condition.

B007N8RULO|5.0|This product is as advertised, and is a very good value.  I would order from them again, but these written evaluations are a real pain.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Another great love story by Nicholas Sparks! Really tugs at the heart.Full of suspense. You'll be glad you read it!
B0082Z1CVQ|3.0|Good book but it's not as good as THE SILENT STORM . It's a book about a girl who promised her father she wouldn't say anything until he gets back but he dies. So she can't talk. And she lives with her grandpa. There is a huracan. She gets lost grandpa go's and looks for her. Now grandpa is in the hospitals only way to save him is for her to talk. She has a big flashback  and saves grandpa.

B001NLKZUA|5.0|I think this book, along with the first, is wonderful. My friend<br />Said that she hated them so I decided to give them a try. This is one book we could not disagree more on. Love the wit, humor, love triangles, action, story. Can't wait to read the next one.
B003L77G6A|5.0|my son loves  the big bang theory. great price...love it, love it, love it, love it, love it, love it
B00AKEMHCA|4.0|Ok this game is great but takes forever to download it took about 15 to 29 minutes to download but still fun
B003ODIZL6|5.0|I consider it a useful resource and a key component to a library or a classroom recommend having the patience to read a lot have fun or not this book is kinds blind but kind of useful at times like when I need to get an A+ on an assignment I just run home open this book and hello A+ hell yeah I wish it was that easy
B009X01GJ2|2.0|it looks good and I like the option of vertical or horizontal but I have arthritis in my wrists and the weight was too much. I sent it back and got a lighter model. it won't hold the kindle up vertically but it doesn't hurt my hands.
B002N5N4M6|5.0|great price.  my son loves the big bang theory. love it, love it, love it , love it, love it
B004SUDQ8Q|5.0|This was not only an exceptionally well done movie, but also a very thought provoking one. I have loved this movie since my teacher showed it to our class while teaching us about our genocide of the Australian aborigines years ago! I loved it so much, that I had to go buy my own copy of the DVD for myself.
B007ZI06FE|5.0|A definite must read. A very original take on vampies. It was entertaining till the very end. I loved it.
B00APUQH0W|3.0|This is a great movie if you just want to relax and have a good time.  The performances from the main actors are good, although the supporting characters are extremely predictable and manipulative.  The writers went short of hanging signs on the characters necks, like &#34;No one knows this, but I'm the bad guy&#34;, or &#34;I will be the hero at the end&#34;, etc.  In short, they try not to make you feel guilty or sorry for certain characters' fates by making them unlikable, thus killing any possible moral conflict.  Would have been a much better movie had the actions of the characters had some real-life bad consequences along with the good results.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|This book was not what I expected. I felt sorry for the girl. This book makes abusive relationships seem exciting and appealing, which is wrong.
B0061S073A|5.0|this app is awesome I have a 4 year old that used my phone to buy apps and downloaded thinfs from advertisements with this app it prevents that from happening so that makes this app a great app
B005SMGRH0|5.0|he liked it a lot so that is all that counted he had it on his wish list .  So it was a great gift
B008M36EEI|1.0|One of the most predictable plots ever! A total disapointment, a waste of time.  I cannot understand how this film received such positive reviews.
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|This work meets Clancy's standard for believeable adventure without getting into the realm of fantastic. By giving Jack Jr. prominence, he is assuring a long life for the series.
B002UM5BXW|5.0|Having been in \\"the business\\" for 37 years, out of it for a year and a half, from grand openings to country clubs, from alcoholism to drug addiction, from divorce lawyers to losing a son, the cuts, burns, broken fingers.....even the CIA('80)....this book, Anthony Bourdain, perfectly describes  all of my reasons for getting into it in the first place, and for getting out of it. Yet I do miss it, having jumped into the service side of restaurants, because I always fixed my own equipment, I still twitch when I arrive during a busy lunch or dinner service to repair a refrigeration unit, and the crew is in the weeds , and I know I can help those pirates ........I still twitch, and I wonder if I'll ever really be out of the business for good. Thank you for putting all of it in print...
B008ELUEQC|5.0|After all these years, he still has it!  I am still  listening even if the season has passed! Everyone should own this CD!
B009RI4FRU|3.0|Some critics have seemed to fallen in love with this quirky indy film.  I am not one of them.  Despite the presence of several top notch actors - Bruce Willis, Bill Murray, Edward Norton, Frances McDormand, and others, its quirkiness is so over-the-top that it never rings true.  There is not a single character in the movie that acts in a realistic manner.  One could argue that since, after all, it is meant to be a fantasy film it need not be realistic, but any fantasy film still needs some grounding in some semblance of reality.<br /><br />I found the relationship between the two lead children, which some have characterized as whimsically innocent, to be only creepy.  What is their mutual attraction based on, simply that they both are weirdo outcasts?  There appears to be a sexual element which seems hardly innocent in two preadolescents.  The adult characters are all strange ducks - but not in any cute cuddly way - they all seem capable of being ax murderers in their lives off-screen (except for the Bruce Willis character).<br /><br />Finally, the characterization of the Boy Scouts in this film is so exaggerated, so stereotypically negative (whose leaders seem either Nazi control freaks or potential pedophiles) that it loses any sense of credibility.<br /><br />Critics seem to love indy director Wes Anderson, I find his quirkiness only annoying - witness Rushmore, The Royal Tenenabaums, and my most un-favorite, The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou.  Give the Bottle Rocket formula a rest Wes!
B00006JIA4|5.0|Collection is awesome but is missing two tracks as far as I am concerned. They are Dragon attack and Tie your mother down.
0141345659|4.0|This book seriously ripped my heart out of my chest and although I'm happy I finally read it to see what the hype was all about, there's no way I could knowingly put myself through that kind of heartache again over a book!<br /><br />John Green is an amazing writing and The Fault in Our Stars is proof of that. He wrote about cancer like he was an actual doctor and after I read that he lived in Germany for a couple years and researched/corresponded with numerous doctors on the subject (to the point where even his made-up medicine was entirely believable and I wouldn't be surprised if people who got cancer actually asked their doctors about this drug, only to be told it doesn't exist), I had to wonder if writing this book was as cathartic of an experience for him as it was for those who read it.<br /><br />Hazel and Augustus (Gus) are lovable, witty, thoughtful and sweet with one another in a way that isn't overly romantic.<br /><br />\\"I'm in love with you and I'm not in the business of denying myself the simple pleasure of saying true things. I'm in love with you, and I know that love is jut a shout into the void, and that oblivion is inevitable and that we're all doomed and that there will come a day when all our labor has been returned to dust, and I know the sun will swallow the only earth we'll ever have, and I am in love with you.\\"<br /><br />There were parts I was laughing, but mostly they were endearing and provoked a guarded smile out of me, because they came sandwiched between knot-in-throat inducing moments.<br /><br />\\"I think forever is an incorrect concept,\\" I answered.<br /><br />He smirked. \\"You're an incorrect concept.\\"<br /><br />\\"I know. That's why I'm being taken out of the rotation.\\"<br /><br />There was A LOT of parts that cut me straight to the bone and caused tears to fall out of my eyes. They couldn't be bothered with the slow descent down my face and went with the all-too-metaphorical free fall approach instead...<br /><br />'\\"You know how Iknow you're a fighter? You called a ten a nine.\\"<br /><br />But that wasn't quite right. I called it a nine because I was saving my ten. And here it was, the great and terrible ten, slamming me again and again as I lay still and alone in my bed staring at the ceiling, the waves tossing me against the rocks then pulling me back out to sea so they could launch me again into the jagged face of the cliff, leaving me floating faceup on the water, undrowned.'<br /><br />This book is so philisophical, I could have imagined it being on the syllabus in college, bringing out class-length discussions on The Imperial Affliction alone, the book Hazel and Gus idolize in Fault, which is really just the adult writer in John Green contrasting with the younger, but still deeply-philisophical viewpoints of Hazel and Gus.<br /><br />There is religious ambiguity in Fault. At first, I truly thought all the views on death were atheist, but I discovered there is double meaning in a lot of what John Green writes and he constructs his sentences purposefully and carefully for the reader to determine their own meaning at times. Other times, it is the admitted unknown of what happens next:<br /><br />\\"I believe the universe wants to be noticed. I think the universe is improbably biased toward consciousness, that it rewards intelligence in part because the universe enjoys its elegance being observed. And who am I, living in the middle of history, to tell the universe that it - or my observation of it - is temporary?\\"<br /><br />More importantly, The Fault in Our Stars is about being remembered and leaving a mark. Why are some remembered, while others are so easily forgotten after they die?<br /><br />The book was turned to the page with Anne Frank's name, but what got me about it was the fact that right beneath her name there were four Aron Franks. Four. Four Aron Franks without museums, without historical markers, without anyone to mourn them.<br /><br />Everything about this book was bittersweet. Hazel's brave reverence in the face of impending death, however vaguely ominous it may be, was so powerful that I thought, 'So this is how I would feel if I was going to die tomorrow?'<br /><br />'I would probably never agin see the ocean from thirty thousand feet above, so far up that you can't make out the waves or any boats, so that the ocean is a great and endless monolith. I could imagine. I could remember it. But I couldn't see it again, and it occurred to me that the voracious ambition of humans is never sated by dreams coming true, because there is always the thought that everything might be done better and again.'<br /><br />The Fault in Our Stars was excellently written. Having to see what all the 'fuss' was about, I bought the book and allowed it to collect dust on my shelf for six months before I gathered the courage to dive into it, knowing it would probably break my heart, which it did.<br /><br />You don't have to like the book to admit that John Green is severely gifted at what he does, and it would be smart of you to read this cautiously. It's ridiculous to allow yourself the comforting state of denial you'll inevitably cling to as you read chapter after chapter, ignorantly assuming there's no way he'll go there, because he can and does. He knows where to hit you where it hurts. I kinda hate him for it, but can't help but admit that The Fault in Our Stars left it's mark on me, that's for sure.
B008CLI4N4|5.0|This is a great video. I am please how well it adheres to the original story. Was a great Christmas gift.
B008UFUOH6|5.0|I listened to this in the car several times, and thoroughly enjoyed it.  Would have been nice to know in advance that packaging is not a jewel box, but a paper cover.  Wouldn't have held up as a stocking stuffer.
B0043KK4N6|5.0|Saw the commercials but did not get to the theatre in time to see it on the big screen now wish I could have. Watch it at least once a month.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I really like how you can save the sounds you mix plus there are so many options who needs the paid version! You can even set it to play for as long as you want if you want to even set a timer for it to go off! It's the best free noise app I've come across so far.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|Little Stomped is awesome too! Very fun game.<br />Runs fine on the following devices we have:<br />- Kindle Fire 2nd gen (3 tablets)<br />- Acer Iconia Tab A500<br />- HTC Inspire (AT&T)<br />- Samsung Galaxy S3 (AT&T)<br />- iPhone 5<br />- iPhone 4<br />- iPad 2
B004XDYJRU|3.0|Not really what I expected.  Don't always get the station I expect but, if it's not part of their system, they substitute what they consider a similar station.  My listening doesn't work like that.
B000001EHS|5.0|Am I in high school. This collection has all the hits that remind of when I was still in school. Rock until you drop!!!!
B008XG1X18|4.0|I like having my Pinterst to use when I want. I'm not sure yet on if I'm able to pin a site that may not have a pin button as on my laptop but navigation seems easy so far and the view is pretty close to being on my laptop. It's good enough to use without a lot of trouble or frustation.
B005HSL626|4.0|Only drawback is some rare freezing.<br />Played on the following devices:<br />- Kindle Fire 2nd gen (3 tablets)<br />- Acer Iconia Tab A500<br />- HTC Inspire (AT&T)<br />- Samsung Galaxy S3 (AT&T)<br />- iPhone 5<br />- iPhone 4<br />- iPad 2
B0064X7FVE|3.0|Not much one can say.  It tells you the weather, BFD.  No big whoopee in it...just the basics.  That's all I need.
B0008ENIAC|5.0|Now I can watch one of my favorites anytime I want. It is awesome to watch without having to tivo it to watch.
B009C7ZQM4|3.0|It seems to work. I'm not too sure if it cleans up well with my tablet being brand new but at least it gives me peace of mind to try.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|Great game! Stable and fun. Only downside is it kills a lot of time :-)<br />Using multiple Kindle Fire 2nd gen tablets.
B0051UP5NQ|3.0|Opened it.  Got some idea of what it's about but still have to sit down and figure it out.  Think I'm gonna like it.
B00417HV14|5.0|If you caught Joe's show on PBS or Palladia and enjoyed it or even if you only \\"sorta enjoyed it\\", GET THIS!  It is unreal how much better this is compared to those two great shows.  It has more footage and better surround sound.<br /><br />Only negative to the show? It ends.  You can not go wrong buying this DVD/Blu-ray (and if you don't like it, donate it to someone with hearing)
B004JZBGWI|4.0|I had downloaded another app for notes that had a lot more options but because this one allows you to lock a note I chose it plus the checklist feature is an added bonus. The only thing I would make different is to have the option for different types of fonts then I would give it five stars with no question.
1594487154|3.0|I am a big fan of Daniel Pink, so I was really looking forward to his new book and even bought an advance copy. He is an interesting writer, speaker and interviewer. This book is okay, but not great. Good ideas, but too much repetition. The length could have easily been cut by a third. We're all in sales, Dan, I get it. You don't have to go on and on repeating it.<br />Also, the distinction between sales and persuasion became a bit blurred after a while. maybe this should have been two books.<br />If this is your first Pink book, you'll probably like it because he is stimulating. Just wish it had been more concise. Still a fan though.
B00A9X9ORI|4.0|Novel set of premises and treatment.  Tight and well acted.  Predictable towards the end, so not great, but entertaining. Willis is always wonderful.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|game loft is the best. so many good free games. my number one app developer. and I also love army games. so many cost money. this is good. fast. free. fun. no ads
B004MC8CA2|4.0|So far this app is good. I wish there was a parallel and a study Bible version option but other than that so far I like it. I like that I don't need to be connected to the internet to use it, or at least with some versions, which makes it a convenience in a Bible Study or church. The only real down fall for not being connected to the internet is being unable to highlight unless it is connected. Still trying to learn it but I think I've got all I needed to know for how I plan to use it. Not into the live part of it though.
B0080A6VFK|5.0|I am very glad I can still get this for these old trusty printers. Still going strong even though HP dropped support for them.
B008JFUUIA|3.0|Overall, 'Pitch Perfect' is a perfectly enjoyable movie, if not horribly predictable.<br /><br />You have the hyper-stick up the a** leader, the rebel, the outcasts.  You have the meek, the poor song and choreography choices. You have the malcontent who can't make friends and doesn't want to be there.<br /><br />You've seen it all before.  Yet it kind of works on its own - that is if you're not expecting anything original.<br /><br />I get the director and writer have to make the point that the female group is in a rut they can't get out of - but it doesn't have to be with the same song. I would have preferred they did more scenes of the Riff-Off or the shower singing where they kind of let loose a little more.<br /><br />Frustration for me in a movie are the unexplained - the story line that isn't resolved (the ultimate goal of the main character), or the animosity of the leader of the singing group to the new talent.  There is no explained reason she dislikes her, so the reconciliation is just as lame.<br /><br />What makes the movie is the talent. Anna Kendricks is ok (though didn't she have the same kind of movie in 'Camp'?).  Rebel Wilson is spot-on.  And Elizabeth Banks is always better than what she is in (though she did produce this).  She gets extra points for having been in an all female acapella group called the 'Minstrel Cycles'.<br /><br />It's a fine waste of 90 minutes, but if you're looking for anything groundbreaking - keep looking.
1476715904|5.0|I love reading a story where you feel every emotion of the characters. I laughed and was almost bought to tears, feeling every emotion that Lake and Will felt in their journey to find each other. Could not put this book down!
B0064X7FVE|4.0|I like being able to check the weather by the hour, day, or week. So far it seems easy to use and comes up fast.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|Life of Pi was an amazing story of so many different yet connected things.  Childhood, zoology, religion, ecosystems...the writer puts you there with not only eyes but with all of your senses.  I must say that the ending quite threw me.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Having recovered from his own glimpse at mortality, Vince Flynn now returns with the same exciting and engaging book he has previously been able to write.
1449410243|5.0|Really nice contest, funny jokes and nice drawing. Totally worth buying it! What's more, it's cheap! My Bf loved it!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I loved Slammed and Point of Retreat - but this was so much better! I laughed and cried.  The characters are Amazing
B00APUYN0I|4.0|A fun packed movie with great performances.<br />For those that like Glee and Smash this is a go to movie.<br />Not a big fan of those shows myself but thoroughly enjoyed it anyway.
B00A820UF0|5.0|Great book, worthy of any mas effect fan to own. Full of facts about the characters and other species. My favorite part though is the alternative looks they could've used, looks like it could be used as reference material for aspiring artists or artists that draw Mass Effect inspired artwork.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|I own many versions of World of Goo from my kindle fire to my computer to my iPod to my Xbox. I love this game and I hiley recamend this game. A game callied Little Inferno made by the makers of World of Goo. In little Inferno you burn crapblike toys. go on youtube and search yogscast and watch them play it.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Loved it.  Really enjoyed this book.  Can't wait to read the third book.  Christian Grey is awesome. Great book. Best I've read in a long time.  Love the love story.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|It was fine. I like the app. I just have too many angry birds apps on my kindle. I would not have removed it otherwise.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I could not put the book down-Grishman was at his best once again.  A thriller from start to finish and one I would recommend for a relaxing weekend read. ENJOY!!!
B00A0SKFLG|5.0|We loved the original Total Recall. This version gives a good nod to the original with some well placed scenes. We enjoyed watching the turns in this version. Worth a rental...
B004J4WKDI|5.0|A very unique plot line!!!! So many new books theses days have predictable plot lines that have been done a thousand times, but this is one of those novels that comes out every once in a while and is above and beyond. Its always interesting, perfect love interest, and is so magical! If you liked harry potter or the host, you'll love this!! Probably one of my favourite books out there!
B004EBT5CU|5.0|Love this CD, love all Adele's work.  Looking forward to her next release.  Would give this as a gift to anyone.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Great book with a wonderful feel good romance!  I look forward to reading more from this author<br /><br />Keep them coming!
B004LWZWGA|1.0|Is there anyone who LOVES this movie? Then skip this.<br /><br />Dark Knight Rising is unleavened. Dull. I got up and just piddled in the kitchen off- and -on, Kanga, my meany momma cat, did a better fight scene with a phantom during the movie. She was atleast quick and light footed. Did they put lead in their shoes? They moved soooooooooo slow- lumbered.<br /><br />ACTION movie. Batman and Catwoman. Catwoman atleast doesn't get beat up and put in a hole that happens to have cable tv- a pit of hardship and depravity. Batman is boring the whole show what he says is meaningless and what he does is good for rest- puts your right to sleep. When he was hung by a rope to fix his back they did feet shots- two. Who thought that was good two shots?<br /><br />Don't let the music, director or actor ever attempt to tell a story. Oh, and the real villain who had sex with Batman/Bruce Wayne wanted to blow up the city. Two decoy trucks going on four blocks. Even me who can't find my way out of a paper bag could of located the atom bomb QUICKER.<br /><br />Boring. I kept faithful and every upbeat of music I'd look up to see if there was some action. Sometimes there was, but it was poorly executed. And, finally, I have a speech impediment and I don't like to make fun of funny sounding folks, but BAIN was too lispy and too much air. I just made up words for him.<br /><br />Save your money and if you MUST watch a bad movie get a better bad movie ABSOLUTE ZERO where no money is spent and its hilarious. Dark Knight wasn't even funny except when the villain woman died and sneezed as she died.
B00338QENI|5.0|This book was chosen for my bookclub, otherwise I am not sure I would have ever thought to read it.  So glad I did!  What an interesting story.  I will think about Henrietta every time I hear about any medical breakthroughs.
B00A757EFW|3.0|The game is pretty good burgers boring after a while!!! But it's still a wonderful old fashion game!!! It was hard to controll the controlls but other than that... The game is wonderful. Not my highst review!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Read a bunch of great reviews and I see why now. Don't miss it. This was a great read that helps spread the word about a great author.
B009VLX8FS|5.0|This album has great quality and her songs in this album are the best yet. She's my favorite singer, im looking forward to her next album.
B009XEE0DW|5.0|J'adore Mylene!  This CD is very upbeat and fun to sing to.  If you are a Mylene fan you won't be disappointed.
B003UMW62A|1.0|I think the product sent was technically defective. I could not watch it!!! It could not be opened.<br />I would like to get a replacement or credit.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Four stars. The story dragged a bit in some parts, it's seemed too descriptive until final chapter then you wish you had not skimmed thru parts. It all made perfect sense and ending total surprise.
B008LV8TSU|4.0|I really enjoyed the movie when I watched it and I was surprised that there was actually a book. I like the book very much, although, some may find it slow and a little convoluted in some places. The book certainly fleshes out the characters more than the movie and I enjoyed knowing them, however I think the movie and the book should probably be judged on their own merit.
B009SIE6AA|5.0|I downloaded this album after hearing and interview with James Taylor on 95.7, out of Seattle. Great interview. This is a fun Christmas album... traditional and not so traditional songs we associate with Christmas, done only as James Taylor can do them. Try it...you like it.
B0094K1PW4|4.0|Very Spielberg.  Elle fanning is superb Actress, highly enjoyable for the entire family.  THe special effects are pretty good but not that convincing
B009E3EY38|5.0|Very well put together set of Led Zeppelin's 2007 concert for the Ahmet Ertegun tribute.  Lots of Zep standards, plus the first-ever performance of &#34;For Your Life,&#34; and a resurrected &#34;Dazed and Confused&#34; (not played since 1975).  The highlights for me are &#34;Kashmir&#34; (which might even sound better than the album version) and &#34;Whole Lotta Love&#34; (the ending reminiscent of the version on The Song Remains The Same).
B009MCRHH6|5.0|Game worth the price of 4.99 only if it was free game again. Great graphics and features. Great game by 2-D boy.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I'm a huge fan of dystopian/science fiction novels and Wool is one of the best I've read ever. Early on in Wool, I didn't quite know what was going on having not read reviews prior to buying the book.  The story develops very quickly, but has plenty of surprises throughout.  I found myself thinking that I knew what was going on often while reading only to be surprised by the actual outcome.<br /><br />The Negatives:<br />I wish it was longer...<br />In all seriousness, early on I really didn't care for the style where the point of view changed to different characters so quickly in Wool 1 and 2.  It was necessary to do so in the story, it just left me a little out of place when the focus shifted to someone new.  This gripe lessened as the story goes on later in Wool.  A minor negative to be sure.<br /><br />The Positives:<br />This truly is an amazing work that I would recommend to any science fiction or dystopian genre reader.  I thoroughly enjoyed every moment.  The setting is very believable and the author really made me feel like his understanding of human nature was transferred into writing effectively.  The actions and reactions of characters during the entire story felt real to me in a way books rarely do.  It's not often I would admit that what you don't know about a story enhances the rest of the story, but the mysteries of what's really going on add a layer of suspense to the book that kept me turning pages.<br /><br />Final thoughts:<br />If you read anything in any review about this book that intrigues you or have had any recommendation to read it, please do.  I enjoyed every moment of it.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|At first I wasn't sure whether or not I should get this but it's free so why not. I ended up loving this game. It's fun and it's like fun. K so if you don't like this game your opinion is invaluable is and yea. So I highly suggest this game for everyone (:
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Should be illegal, that's how addictive this game is.  Would (and do) play again.  It takes you t ok a very calm yet anxious place.  In a good way.
B00770KR7W|5.0|I ordered this for my son and he loves it, it is very well made and has a good price compared to other retailers. I will be back to order more in the future.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|getting the accessories bag was a good deal can carry camera and equipment with no problem.easy to store and use
B000059HAI|5.0|I enjoy classic war movies, not gorey, the movie keeps you involved.<br />The movie has a good storey line, great actors.<br />I would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys old classic movies.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This says it all! I truly enjoy this app reminder of the power I have left to use my Kindle. Such a wonderful feature. Glad I downloaded it. It makes owning this device much better.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|I just finished playing this game. It was a good way to waste an afternoon. I will play it again.
B00000DOYL|5.0|Many people say that Zep started declining after Phsyical Graffiti. While they did start making different music, it didn't get any worse. I did not have high hopes for this album, but they were blown out of the water anyway. This is a very different kind of Zeppelin - definitely very different from the Zep you'd hear on II or even Houses of the Holy. I got my copy for under 5 dollars, when I would have payed 12 at a record store. Definitely take the time to listen to this overlooked gem.<br /><br />In The Evening does not set an appropriate tune for the entire album. This song features Plant's vocals at their weakest. However, the rest of the album is all gold. My favorites include Fool in the Rain, Hot Dog and All My Love.<br /><br />Please buy this album. You will not be dissapointed.
B0002O7XW2|4.0|I enjoy scarey movies, not gorey, but the movie keeps you involved.<br />The movie has a good storey line, great actors.<br />I would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys old classic movies.
B0098VYCCE|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie. I had just seen the episode of &#34;Once Upon A Time&#34; on Netflix which was the same tale. True, Snow White was  a little more feisty than  Kristen Stewart's character but it was fun to see the different character interpretation and story. I am really into all the fairy tale stories that are popular right now. It is one of my favorite sub-genres of fantasy literature.
B00069MQBG|5.0|Delta is a fabulous singer/songwriter - we just need to discover her on this continent. I've had her &#34;Delta&#34; release that targeted North America for a few years now and always thought it was great and just decided to check out some of these older releases and this one may be even better - give it a listen and you'll likley want to own it too.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|I rented this movie before I bought it. I love it and just got into the characters. I think it is a good movie and I recommend to anyone. Jennifer lawrence is awesome.
B00005K3NR|4.0|I enjoy scarey movies, not gorey, but the movie keeps you involved.<br />The movie has a good storey line, great actors.<br />I would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys old classic movies.
B00APUQJLO|1.0|This is a slow, cumbersome movie with few insights, shallow characters, poorly delivered choppy dialogue, and no interesting facets to redeem or justify its weaknesses.  A long slow drive across a surreal city is broken by brief interactions with empty characters.  We see sex with no real context, death with no reason or social commentary, and cliche contrasts between a filthy-rich young tycoon and various sycophants and have-nots.  These do not make a movie worth the time wasted to watch it.<br /><br />Robert Pattinson plays a an uber-rich financial tycoon out looking for a bit of a haircut across town (literally).  But his screen presence is stiff and simplistic - his dialogue carries none of the insights that would necessarily flow from someone sophisticated enough to have reached his supposed position.  Similarly the people around him bring little to the table.  The only message one could even remotely glean from this would be that youngsters who obtain power quickly bring little depth, intelligence, or sophistication with them to their positions.  It's a long movie for such a self-evident proclamation.<br /><br />This film is more like a high-school film project.  Other than that it was okay.
B00008RH8S|5.0|I decided to try some of Delta's older releases (have owned her North American release of &#34;Delta&#34; for a few years) and sure glad I did - her first 2 releases from back in 2002-2003 are both great - give them a try - you won't be disappointed.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|A must read! It is hard to put down. It is one of the best books that I have read in a while.
B007KQ6XYY|5.0|Hey this a great game. If you like cut the rope you will love this. It's really fun and it kills time. Buy it!!!!
044654146X|5.0|I found this book to be extremely informative and very uplifting.  It made me want to go to live in Israel.
B0006VIE4C|5.0|We now have all of the Star Wars Episodes thanks to amazon.com.  The DVD's arrive in perfect condition, very clear picture, great color and arrive in a matter of days.
B006RXQ2CY|1.0|Just another bit of fluff about the royal putrescence, don't you know. Too bad they wouldn't allow Unlawful Killing, the documentary about Diana's death to be shown in the US, but then, what would you expect? Just keep slurping up the royal swill, Americans, and don't listen to any of those nasty facts about how they murdered Diana.
0156027321|1.0|I don't know how the movie ever got made.  The book is very boring .  Read 80 pages and just can't get any further.
0525953728|5.0|Husband loved the book. Arrived fast and in excellent shape. He didn't know why all the flash about the book. he said it was really what was on TV
B009JBZH54|5.0|For the cost of the new movie alone, you could own the entire Nolan trilogy. The finest modern superhero movies and are about as fun as you'd expect to watch.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|As a developer on the Microsoft stack, I tried really hard to like OneNote.  I really did.  It came installed on my Windows Phone and is one of the components of Office 2007 Ultimate which I won in a drawing at a local .Net users group meeting.  However I never really got the hang of it.  Sometimes it would sync the phone and pc and sometimes not.  Then I tried Evernote.  I have it on my personal desktop PC running Windows 8, Samsung Focus Flash running Windows Phone 7.5, work PC, and my new Kindle Fire HD.  What I enter into one automatically shows up on the other three.  I like it a lot.  Plus it's simply easier to use!
B009YP9L7U|2.0|Story did not ring true. Very weak plot and characters. 10 more words required, but this story isn't worth 10 more
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Calculator plus is everything the description says it is. It'll definitely be all you need it to be. This is the rare app that exceeds your expectations.<br /><br />Jijooj
B00AA7O22U|4.0|It's a simple story and filled with action hero's we enjoy.  The interaction between characters that have their own histories can be very funny. Only a few of these character understand the personal darkness of their chosen profession. Stallone's character with a death's head on everything is the one who stands out as a man who accepts the darkness.
B003ZSJ212|4.0|My husband insists on replacing the Star Wars collection every time the quality approves. I don't get it, we have gone from VCR tapes to Blue Ray, but it makes him happy. The story is always good!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This is a great game for an easy day.  You do not need to exert a lot of energy or think a lot to drop coins.  Fun to occupy a child also.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Love the book, very romantic.  Love the characters.  Very erratic, sensual and detailed.  This book is very easy to read and is difficult to put down.
B00APUYWYA|3.0|I dislike Glee, so not sure why I thought I might like this movie.  It's cute, but I'm glad I didn't spend the money to see it in theaters.
0547391005|5.0|My Sons Really enjoy it They want to hear the story every night, even as they get older they still listen
0307592731|5.0|So many other reviewers have stated why this book is wonderful in such eloquent ways that I will just add my five stars to the pile and move on...but I wanted to take the time to acknowledge and recommend \\"Wild\\" to you. It's a great book! The author's humility, sense of humor, and sense of wonder combine for a fresh and approachable voice and a thoroughly enjoyable read. Throw in the suspense of the 1,000 mile plus trek through the wilderness, alone, and I found it hard to put down.
B004WR125O|5.0|I read every review, both positive and negative, and simply put, this works fine. I can connect and control my Onkyo TX-NR717  from my Android cell phone from more than 25 feet away. I pressed the USB button on the receiver, and then plugged in the UWF-1 adapter and connected with the app in less than 2 minutes.
B002RI9ZPY|4.0|I was concerned that this would be dull after the DragonTattoo. I was wrong. This one explains the story behind the first one so I found it a gripping and rewarding read. Of course the technology etc is outdated now but the story is strong and the characters are well drawn. If you get the chance, see the original Swedish films, they're really good.
0060254920|5.0|My Sons Really enjoy it They want to hear the story every night, even as they get older they still listen
B008KE3960|4.0|Great mind numbing game. Variety of planes, good graphics,  lots of maps. The planes should be earned not bought.<br />Kidsnlove it.
B005J32Y6Q|5.0|I have been a long time Lord of the Dance fan. After getting my 3D TV and Blu Ray player, I wanted to get some 3D titles. Very excited when I saw Lord of the Dance in 3D! I was a bit hesitant as I have the original DVD, and thought the quality was absolutely awful. And being in Canada, I had to order an import from the UK... costly shipping.<br />It was totally worth it. The 3D effects are amazing; one of the best I've seen. The songs in the show have changed, probably a natural evolution. I was pretty disappointed when Siamsa was cut from the show when I saw it live last year. But I was very happy to see it included in the Deleted Scenes. The new songs are pretty rocking. Very happy with this title!
B005EGXTEE|4.0|As a high school English teacher, my students asked me to read goth is novel. I was pleasantly surprised, found it a speedy read and genuinely liked the style and the concept. I have read much sci-fi and found this to be colourful, appropriate for teens and also a good read for adults. I read it BEFORE the movie came out and so I had no preconceptions. I guess the fact that a movie was on its way influenced me to speed up my reading helped! A good adventure and a great female role model in the lead character. Many of the BOGAN (redneck) moms of the next few years will name their kids after these characters ... . Lots of little Katnisses and Peetas running around :)

B004DM0UII|5.0|hee, hee, hee...listening to instrumental right now...fabulous!  Even has a graphic equalizer with bass boost.  Thanks for making this app free.  I am a cheapscape, and free is always a welcome choice!  Great christian stations complete with sermon and teaching broadcasts...
B00AF6MF9I|3.0|takes awhile to make progress then you lose some of your progress when you leave the game. frustrating!  fix those 2 things then the game would be much better.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Great book!! At first I really was not into it but after the first few chapter I could not put it down.

B009KHDT0C|4.0|I did enjoy watching this movie. Watched while the family took a road trip. Really helped to make the time go by nicely. I would recommend it.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|Very Reacher!!  A number of surprises and turns. Have READ them all and there were a number of things I missed.
0451529065|5.0|Everyone should have a copy of what started it all. Perennially interesting and brilliant work despite some mis-guesses in the early days.

B009VB97EY|3.0|It wasn't the best movie out there and pretty predictable but it was fun to watch and smile at. I would recommend it. Fun silly movie.
B005WUHAX8|1.0|When I received the case, I was expecting more.  The paint was already chipped, conversations are muffled, and I couldn't turn silent button on or off.  Was VERY dissatisfied.
B009HV2JT8|3.0|The film seemed over-budgeted and hastily planned. The movie has good visuals but lacked the substance to draw me into the story even though I already love the story. It is one of those movies that you can watch at home while doing something else.
B007STBUIW|5.0|My wife and I went to the mall one saturday very nice day outside we passed by the theater that was there it was a two screener just opened up my wife wanted to see the the love story forget the name of it, I saw the billboard for Jaws, knew nothing about. My wife turned saw me looking at it, \\"NO!! we are not seeing a movie about a fish. After I told her I would take her out to a nice dinner and dancing she caved. Well being the man I was from under the seat, she was taking in every minute of it for two weeks it was all she could talk about to me to her friends even the mail woman they were coming on their own at the time. I didn't talk about it. Me, I just couldn't get it out of my mind or dreams because being the man I knew how dangerous sharks were she didn't she was naive.
B0086700CM|5.0|This is a great tam I luv the graphics and all but a lot of companies are taking the ides but making it seem like their own I don't understand that very much though in this whole situation.
B0099G7KDQ|4.0|It's very similar to the first album and lovers of Mumford and Sons won't be disappointed by it. It has a religious sermon feel about it that I was not expecting but works well. Over all a fine follow-up.
B008QTVNUI|2.0|If they would leave out the language and raunchy sex/nudity this would be an awesome show.  I wish I didn't buy the whole season right off the bat.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|This game is very interesting! The game is very complex yet simple. The plot is very well thought out. I love it!!!!
B008XG1X18|5.0|Love to look at all the different subjects:  cooking, fashion, home décor, DIY, architecture!<br /><br />Sharing ideas, and following others posts.<br /><br />Love it!
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|I've quickly become a fan of Jack Ryan Jr. & the Campus, and this book doesn't disappoint. Excellent character development, strong plot, & a clever villain will keep the pages turning.<br />I would suggest, however, if you haven't read any of the Campus novels, don't start with this one...go and, at least, read Locked On, first. Otherwise Ryan's love life might destroy it for you.<br />Enjoy.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|It was a great read that really kept me interested and concluded well. I would recommend this to anyone. Cheers
B008JGSM6G|5.0|You will find this game very addicting. It challenges you to think spatially even though it is only played in 2 dimensions. It also helps you to plan routes to get from one dot to another. The 5 x 5 boards can be a bit easy but when you get into the higher levels things get exciting.<br />I hope you enjoy this fun time.
B00APUYN0I|5.0|My wife made me watch this and I was thanking her afterwards. One of the funniest movies I've ever seen
B001BTG3OQ|5.0|Excellent product!<br />I would say that the problem detected that made Nikon release the SB910, is nothing.<br />The SB900 works as good or even better than the SB910, and the menu is slightly simpler.
B005LAIIPS|3.0|If you are like me, you're looking at Bourne Legacy because of the previous three films. Do not expect the same style of character that you have grown to love with Jason Bourne. Now, the film itself has some great acting, some great action scenes, and a few interesting new twists to the previous story arc. However, it is lacking the intrigue and intellect we've grown accustomed to. If you go in watching this film expecting Aaron Cross to outwit his opponents, as Jason did, you will come out severely disappointed. If you go in expecting to find a character haunted by not knowing his past and therefore following along as confused as the main character is, again you will be disappointed. So take out the \\"bourne\\" from the title and go in with no expectations and you may be able to enjoy it as a good action movie. I do not want to spoil the plot, but I will mention that the writers have thrown in several key plot points that never existed in the three films and it leaves a bad taste in your mouth. Why now? Why now do you, writers, suddenly decide that's part of the bourne world? I have seen other films more poorly done as a late sequel, so do not misinterpret what I say as that this is a bad film. It just does not live up to its predecessors and doesn't particularly deserve the word \\"bourne\\" on its cover.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Coin Dozer is one of the world's best games and I love the way the others designed it. So thank you for your.
B0063IH60K|4.0|LOve the version on my Kindle Fire. Theonly thing is , it does not keep track of your scores like other programs do
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|such a cool game. my daughter had it on her kindle and I loved playing it though it takes a long time to load it is super fun.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Wonderful book series, but it could have ended with a bit more bang. All in all, I would read it over and over!
B00AE2J5HI|5.0|I'm a fan of southern,1930s, FACT based movies ESP with great actors, prohibition and a true story. (green mile also) I loved this movie from beginning to end. It reminds me of stories an old person would tell me. My favorites lol. Learning about history, a part of life I never knew existed besides reading in books. Such a harsh era. I love it. I suggest this movie for any southern gangster loving person. I watced it three times..... Enjoy. :)
078881172X|5.0|This is a wonderful movie and after watching Hook wanted to go back and see the original Peter Pan and remember the fun.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This was my second favorite hunger games books!!!! I just hate the last sentence. I like the first book better.
B002ZG97EC|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies for my daughter. It also keeps the parents attention which.is very nice. This is a must buy movie.
B004DM0UII|5.0|Very good interface. I would recommend this app to anyone looking for a radio station app. Large selection of songs. easy to use.
B004LWZWGK|1.0|Love this movie. The entire series by Director Christopher Nolan is superb.  However, I have come to despise UltraViolet for the god-awful product they put out.  In a digital age, I only purchase blu-rays  offering \\"free\\" digital copies of the film (or I'll purchase DVDs to rip them).  Digital copies of movies used to come with an iTunes code to download a copy of the movie and you could do with that copy as you saw fit.  You could play it on your iPhone, on your mac, stream it to an AppleTV (or other non-Apple devices), etc.  You could do all of this without downloading any additional programs, or signing up for annoying mailing lists.<br /><br />UltraViolet does not allow you to download the film without also downloading the Flixster & UltraViolet applications and signing up for accounts for their services and, of course, bombarding your inbox with emails about their offerings (unless, of course, you unsubscribe).  They completely restrict your ability to playback your copy.  You can only play it on your iPhone, but, again, only after downloading the Flixster app.  Once an UltraViolet copy of a movie is on your iPhone, they disable iPhone streaming to other devices, such as an AppleTV.  You can not stream the copy on your mac to any device, because the Flixster app won't allow it. IF you recently purchased a mac, and it has mirroring, you can watch the film in the Filxster app and mirror your entire screen on your AppleTV, but the quality is poor.  I read on some message boards that some users complained to UltraViolet about their inability to view their downloads on their devices, and UltraViolet would respond by giving them an iTunes download code for the film.  When I complained to UltraViolet customer service, I received no response.  Horrible product, horrible customer service.  Do NOT buy UltraViolet digital copies.
B001HN6922|4.0|Pixar's newest release is slick. And when I say slick, I mean it's SLICK. In the same way that Lightning McQueen is speed, Cars 2 is slick. Shiny. Mint. The animation is... there are no actual words for what the animation is. Especially the animation on the racing locations. I sat there thinking, \\"I want to go there.\\" Especially when they were racing in Italy, and, actually, I have no real desire to go to Italy, but those scenes... I would have just stepped into them if I could have.<br /><br />Cars 2 embraces everything kids loved about Cars and focuses in on it and makes it Bigger. Better. Faster and more intense (to quote a famous director (well, he's not famous for being a director, but that's the phrase he's known for when directing (points for anyone that knows whom))). Throw in Michael Caine as Finn McMissile, the James Bond of the movie, and you have  the perfect mix for the perfect spy spoof. And it is. If you can imagine a James Bond movie where he's accompanied by Johnny English (a Rowan Atkinson creation, if that gives you any idea). Actually, just see Cars 2, and you won't have to imagine it. Caine is suave and sophisticated while Larry the Cable Guy is, well, Mater.<br /><br />In comparison to other Pixar movies, this one has been getting bad reviews. Which puts it on just about even footing with other movies. As a total aside, I find it extremely curious that the first movie that Pixar has released that attacks a particular group, in this case Big Oil, is the first of their movies to get any kind of negative reaction. In general, their movies have been about the human condition, and this one is, too, but Cars 2, specifically, makes the statement that Big Oil is bad. WALL-E has a similar theme, an environmental theme, but they don't target any particular group with that movie; they play it safe by equating their environmental message with said human condition -- humans need to \\"shape up\\" but not any specific ones. But, hey, I agree with them, Big Oil is bad. They are one of the big evils in the world, and, if Pixar wants to call them to the carpet, I'm good with that. I mean, when a Saudi prince starts talking about how they need to drive oils prices down so they can keep the US dependent on the Middle East for oil, you know something's wrong.<br /><br />I'm not trying to say there's any kind of conspiracy against Cars 2 or Pixar by Big Oil, but I do find the negativity surrounding the movie to be, well, like I said, curious.<br /><br />Moving past the oil thing, probably, the biggest \\"flaw\\" of the movie is its failure to meet audience expectations. Cars is about Lightning McQueen. He is the star of the movie. The trailers leading up to Cars 2 support our assumption and expectation that Lightning will, again, be the star of Cars 2. Pixar fails to prepare us for the reality, and the blame for that lies squarely with them. Or with Disney. With whoever prepared the trailers, but I'd find it hard to believe that Pixar didn't have some control over that. The truth is, though, is that Lightning is not the hero of the sequel. That distinction falls on Mater (If you doubt it, check to see who got top billing for the movie. Hint: it wasn't Owen Wilson). I think it's quite possible that adult audiences just couldn't come to grips with the comic relief from the first movie taking over in the spotlight in the second. Kids, though... well, kids love Mater, and I'm pretty sure it hasn't been an issue for them.<br /><br />That's a failing I often see in reviews of movies for kids, the tendency to belittle them for no reason other than that they're for kids. Pixar, of course, has spoiled the wider audience by making their movies equally appealing to adults, so when they release a movie that is geared (no pun intended) more toward kids, adults get a little upset over it.<br /><br />If Cars 2 does a have a failing, I'd say it's one of story telling. The big plot is the spy story with the message about big oil, but they needed something else to give it that emotional impact they're known for, so they tried to weave in a story about friendship and how we need to accept our friends for whom they are. Lightning is embarrassed of Mater. In fact, it is the early conflict over this that sends Mater off on his adventure. However, because the movie is focused on Mater, we never get the opportunity to make an emotional connection with Lightning over the issue, so there's no tug on our heart when we get to the pay off for that in the movie. Just an intellectual acknowledgment that, yes, we shouldn't try to make our friends be someone they're not. It's the failure of these two story lines to support each other that leaves the audience feeling that there could have been something more. Sort of like making one peanut butter sandwich and one jelly sandwich and leaving it to the audience to figure out what to do with them.<br /><br />Having said that, I do feel the need to point out that this movie is still vastly superior to the average Hollywood offering. If this is the worst Pixar has to offer, and I'm not saying it is, because I actually enjoyed it a lot more than WALL-E, no one has any reason at all to complain. And it's worth saying: Big Oil is bad.
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|I'm a true blue Tom Clancy fan and was a little worried about  dilution from the Mark Greaney collaboration, this but this one fit the bill nicely.  Keep 'em coming boys.
B004NSULHM|5.0|I listened to this disc a couple of times but couldn't get into it.  But later I heard the live versions from In the Basement, and they were phenomenal. So I then revisited this album and have been listening to it now non-stop for a week.  it really grew on me and reminds me of stuff they released on Kid A and Amnesiac.<br /><br />And Live in the Basement is a great companion to the album.
B007IL5B6C|5.0|Super read with fantastic insights into the dedication required to be an elite athlete. Although I've no doubts Ian will rediscover winning form in the pool, he demonstrates in this book that's he's a true champ in the way he's faced down life's challenges and continues to drive forward.
B004EPYZPS|4.0|My wife screamed. I mean, she really screamed. I don't remember one time in over a dozen years when she's actually screamed during a movie. Generally speaking, she just likes to cut the circulation off in whichever of my limbs is closest to her during any suspenseful or scary parts. This time, she screamed. Loud. And ended up half in my lap. From a movie seat, so that was kind of impressive. She made me jump. I don't even remember what it was that caused the reaction, at this point, but she followed it up with 3 or 4 lesser screams throughout Super 8. And she squeezed my left arm off. Yes, it fell onto the floor, and I had to have it reattached. It was pretty gross, though. I mean, have you ever really looked at the... goo... on a movie theater floor? Let me just tell you right now, you don't want your arm laying around in it. Fortunately, because we went to a late showing several weeks post release, the theater wasn't very crowded, so there weren't many witnesses to take care of.<br /><br />My first reaction to Super 8 was very positive. There's a good story there. An actual story about real people. So here's the warning: there will be spoilers. I want to actually talk about this movie and J. J. Abrams, and I don't want to try to do it while dodging around trying not to give anything away about the movie. Also, despite anything negative I may say about Super 8, let me just reiterate that I thoroughly enjoyed the experience of watching the film. It's easily one of the best stories in a movie I've seen this year. Not the best, but, probably, top 5.<br /><br />I have very ambivalent feelings about Mr. Abrams. The more removed I am from the experience of sitting in the theater watching Super 8, the more my ambivalence towards Abrams extends over to the movie. See, Abrams has this problem: he likes to hide things behind his back to generate suspense. You remember doing that when you were a kid, right? Or, at least, having it done to you? When you're a kid, it's kind offun. Trying to &#34;convince&#34; someone to show you what he's hiding. It's fun because you know he really does want to show you, so, once you've played the game long enough, he'll give you a peek. Teenagers change this to the &#34;I've got a secret&#34; game, but it's really the same thing.<br /><br />There are two problems with this: 1. the thing is often anti-climactic 2. sometimes, we already know. Oh, actually, there's one other problem: it only works once. It's sort of a cheap trick in story telling because of that, when the suspense is being generated by just holding the secret behind your back. There's no reason to go back and experience it again, because you already know the secret. As opposed to a movie like The Sixth Sense (and I hate using this, because I don't have much respect for what Shyamalan has become. However, you can't deny that this one film was brilliant. Possibly the most brilliant of its genre) where the secret is really in front of you the whole time, you just don't know it because you haven't figured it out. You can watch it over and over again marveling at how you should have figured it out but just didn't.<br /><br />That was the biggest issue I had with Super 8; I had flashbacks of Cloverfield, which is a movie I just didn't enjoy. I appreciate what Abrams was trying to do (it was a great idea), but the execution was... well, it was just weak. A movie without a plot with the author holding a monster behind his back that he flashes to us for a brief moment at the end and leaves us saying, &#34;That's it? That was all? Two hours of this just for that?&#34; He applies this same gimmick to Super 8, and, although he gives us a better view of the critter at the end of the movie, I still felt like I'd been kind of cheated. It was sort of like finding out that all he'd had behind his back the whole time was a frog. There was nothing startling about the alien. It was an alien. Big deal.<br /><br />Abrams' genius lies in his ideas. He comes up with great concepts. Like Cloverfield. He doesn't have the best execution, though. He lets the idea run away with him instead of harnessing the idea. His Star Trek is a great example of this. He has this problem. He needs to re-boot the Star Trek franchise, but he doesn't want to just do the same thing over again. How could he shake things up? Destroy Vulcan. Go off on a whole new timeline. It was a great idea. But red matter? Seriously? That's the best he could come up with? And some guy sitting around in a space ship for decades just waiting? Yeah, it sounds malevolent and all, but, come on, decades? There's bound to be a point where the boredom sets in. Don't get me wrong, I loved his Star Trek. It's the best Star Trek out there, but, in the end, it's still just Star Trek with things like red matter that make my eyes roll.<br /><br />He seems to have a follow through issue, too. Like a cat in a field of butterflies. Alias comes to mind. Another great idea. The first season was exceptional. Hooked me and my wife. We watched the whole series based on that first season. Well, the second season was pretty good, too. Somewhere in the third season, though, he got a new idea, Lost, and left Alias to pursue that instead. And Alias was full of the &#34;what am I hiding behind my back?&#34; plots. Every season. Oh, and everyone was an enemy spy that they would just suddenly reveal &#34;by the way, I have a secret.&#34; I haven't watched Lost, but it has sounded like it was much the same. Great concept. It must have been considering how many people flocked to it, but he left it somewhere in there to go do Fringe, which I couldn't watch. I tried. But it was just too Abrams. Oh, and there was Star Trek in there, too, so, really, all you people out there upset about how Lost ended, you can't exactly blame Abrams, because he wasn't there. Other people were responsible for whatever bad stuff happened at the end of the series. Oh, wait. Abrams wasn't there. I guess you can blame him. But, you know, he probably didn't have any idea about how to end it, either, so it probably wouldn't have mattered if he had been there.<br /><br />Super 8 evokes all of these Abrams issues for me. I can see them all in there. However, 8 has one saving grace: the story is just E.T. With a twist. It's the &#34;what if the government had found the alien first?&#34; version. But it's still a story about a boy that has lost a parent and is trying to cope with his loss. By meeting an alien. If only that was an option available to all boys that have lost a parent. Spielberg gave Abrams an assist on the story, so it's not surprising that that's what we're getting. Just with a lot of explosions and guns and eating humans (because that's really the freakiest moment in the movie, the alien casually munching on a human limb like it's eating a chicken leg). It's a strong story, and I could probably watch Super 8 again for the story, although the suspense surrounding the alien won't be there. My wife said she'd watch it again just to see the train crash again. It is spectacular.<br /><br />Abrams does an excellent job with the setting. It evokes that sense of nostalgia in people my age and older. Those memories of what it was like to be a kid at that time. It's probably the strongest thing about the movie. It's perfect. Kids riding bikes. Models hanging from ceilings. Star Wars posters and comic books. All those things that are gone from mainstream life today. No cell phones. No computers. Cameras that actually use film that has to be developed. In that respect, I'm not sure how the movie plays to younger audiences. I haven't seen anything from that demographic about it, and we didn't take our kids to see it. I'm pretty sure all the explosions would make up for any lack of connection with the world of the movie, though.<br /><br />There's even a message. Most movies, these days, don't have messages. Or themes. Nothing beyond the good vs evil. Which is fine, but it can go deeper than that. Abrams doesn't want anyone to miss his message, so he states it plainly for the audience. I'm impressed by this. Not in that he did it, but that people have still missed it. I know they have. I've read more reviews about this movie than any movie in a long time, and they all missed it. I would have thought that stating it the way Abrams did was a bit heavy handed, but, evidently, you have to put it right out there for people to even have a hope of them getting it, and, still, people will miss it. It's like communication with teenagers. Maybe that's where he messed up; he didn't state the message at least three times. Having spent many years of my life working with teenagers, I have experience with the &#34;at least three times&#34; thing. Most of them will get it after three times, although some still miss out and have to come back and ask &#34;what did you say?&#34;<br /><br />At any rate, it's a good message. So good, in fact, that I'm going to quote it. The whole movie, the whole story, leads up to this one line. From the very first frame, he begins setting up the story, with a true plot arc, to lead up to the one line of the movie that will sum everything up. However, I don't think it will spoil anything to know it ahead of time, because this particular aspect of the movie is about the journey. The journey of a father and a son trying to figure out how to connect with each other after the loss of the wife and mother. It's a touching journey and more grounded in reality than E. T., since the relationship in E.T. is the relationship with the alien. Who, then, leaves. Like Eliot's father left. This time, though, the boy is left with his father and the knowledge, &#34;Bad things happen. Bad things happen, but you can still live.&#34;
B0098VYCCE|1.0|I think this SHOULD have been a good film, w/ some of the,special effects, charlize, & even kristian stewart  smiled in it, But, where the heck was the director during the editing process? this movie could not decide what it wanted to be comedy,drama or maybe even dramady???  It was none of those. SAVE YR $$$$ & time , i'll never get back! lol
B008MG1E4A|5.0|A great way to understand the suspense that surrounded the training and attack.  It gives information that makes one appreciate the work that the Seals do.
B0073COMKW|5.0|I just started getting into replacing all of my house lights withe LED Bulbs. Pricier, but savings on electricity and bulb longevity should pay for itself in the long run. This bulb has the same lighting color as an incandescent bulb.
B00991TCOG|5.0|This is a great album. It's something new to the music scene. With the combination of a violin and awesome bass drops its something worth paying for.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|I was going nowhere....just kind of partying and strangling random hookers.  But this game shoved its life affirming wisdom down my philosophy hole with the deft hand of a trickster god on a strictnne bender.  I put down the bong and started reading books. Paper books with musty smells.  I saw that there was a thin veil in the world that few cold see and I pierced it with my mind penis.  I also started eating vegan and I look down on you. You poor ignorant fools.
B007P3TMW2|5.0|The acting was superb and the story very engaging. I'd watch it again and recommended it to friends.  I wouldn't consider it academy award material but top notch entertainment.
B004SBULWE|5.0|This app is so easy to use and hopefully it works well. I use it everytime I get on line.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|Purchased for teenage son. Loved the movie and it brought the stories together. Save a little bit on price guarantee.
B009VLX8FS|3.0|The album is good not great. The last album<br />was awesome. A little disappointed on the style change. This was not as heartfelt.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|Very interesting story- pictures made the story even more interesting . Was a very quick read. Great story telling, suspenseful.
B00005M91K|5.0|This produce was accurately described.  I don't have anything specific to add.  Just that is was as described. That's All.
1449410243|3.0|Only mildly funny and has little to do with the book title.  I'm also bothered by its inappropriate jokes concerning homosexuality.  The language is not suitable for pre-teen readers.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|I like knowing that the new features in this are the best possible freelance programming language of warriors stars are cool
B00AJRQLTI|5.0|The album itself is very well done, in my opinion. The vocal performances are all to be applauded, however, I was sorely disappointed by how much was left out of the soundtrack. There are treasured songs that were cut down or completely cut out of the soundtrack. I can only hope that they will release another album which includes more of the songs, as the performances in the film were such a delight to hear. And since I cannot rate what is not there, I give it 5 stars :)
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I haven't had any problems with this app.  I really like that you can look back at the history of the problems you have solved.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|Hilarious, witty, entertaining, etc.  Teaches good morals. Much to glean from this inspiring movie.  Great for most everyone to enjoy.

030758836X|4.0|Loved the book. Couldn't put it down. Loved your 12 days of Xmas. The price was fantastic.  Hope to see you run deals like this again.
B006DHASYM|5.0|Cute movie and great quality of course.  Digital copy is great to put on your iPad to watch on the go.
B003O86FMW|5.0|As good as the first one.  I can't wait to start Mockingjay.  These have been the best reads in a long time.
B00447G29S|5.0|Got this as a gift for my nephew, but ended up loving it myself when we watched it over Christmas together.  There are some publications that claim children under 3 years old either:<br /><br />a) shouldn't watch 3D Blu-ray movies because it's not good for them<br />b) may not have the depth perception/binocular vision to really appreciation the 3D<br /><br />The first one doesn't really concern me, because I don't think those concerns have been substantiated, and (for what it's worth) my 2 year old nephew really seemed to think that the 3D was cool--don't know if it was that he actually thought that the movie was cool, or he just enjoyed wearing the 3D glasses :)<br /><br />As for the adults, we all really enjoyed the crystal clear clarity of the movie and the additional depth added by the 3D effects.  This movie is wonderful for all ages, and a must-see every year around Christmas.
B00A9X9TIW|5.0|Two things:<br /><br />1. Rian Johnson is a genius.<br /><br />2. Can kid actors get Oscars?  Because that kid was as creepy as he was endearing and that's a combination most adult actors fail to execute perfectly.
B008Y5OWMK|5.0|This new release is a revelation . I have had the VHS,then the DVDs (short and full versions) and am quite obviously a great<br />fan of this movie in it's full running time.<br />Criterion has gone back to the original seperate color strip negatives and produced a transfer that beggars belief.<br />The colors are rich and lush. Gone are the sepias and heavy filters. Gone is the less than clear soundtrack.<br /><br />This issue is a standout and will surely be among the candidates for best Blu-ray of all time.<br /><br />Buy it.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|Surprised as to how much room is in bag.  Nice touch, can put two camera bodies and lens to match.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|My review may not make sense to a lot of people but I know some of you will understand completely. I laughed, cried multiple times, lost my breath and felt my heart skip beats reading this. If you ever had a secret you could not share or were just afraid to, read this book.
B007HACDLK|5.0|I have read every one of his books with Mitch, this was the best.  A fast read in that it is hard to put down.  AS oppossed to the lastest Jack Reacher book by Lee Childs effort.  By the way I have read every Jack Reacher.
B0070NSPCU|4.0|I enjoyed this novel quite a bit. It was well paced, lots of intrigue and the author keeps you guessing with the main character as to what is going on behind the scenes. The main character is pretty badass too and does'nt moan about his struggle but just gets on with it. I thought it was gritty and realistic in the way that a warrior desensitised to violence from a young age like him, would react to the violence that he deals out.<br /><br />A good to great book.
1451695195|4.0|I would recommend this book!  Clearly the writer had an extraordinarily unique experience which he shares from the heart. I am particularly pleased about his determination to share his experience with everyone, especially his colleagues.<br /><br />I am especially hopeful that Dr. Alexander is successful in his quest to re-experience in his present life the beauty he glimpsed while in coma.  With great determination, I suspect he will encounter it very soon!
B000UVT3OI|5.0|It's kind of difficult to write a review for this CD - I mean, if you like his music then get the CD - you'll probably love it because it's his greatest hits collection, if you don't like his music, then what the hell are you even looking at this page for? I mean, really - if that's the case, then you're just wasting time. Be productive. You know you have work to do.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I loved this book!  It was a very quick read, in spite of the heavy topic.  The characters were engaging and funny and quirky and sad all in one breath.  I will read more of this author in the future.
B009RI4FRU|5.0|I rank this film in my top 10 of 2012 for multiple reasons. Most importantly, it's the characters that drive the film and are continually engaging to watch. If you enjoyed Royal Tannenbaums or The LIfe Aquatic, then you will most definitely enjoy this film. Highly recommend.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|The game is very challenging for my daughter which makes her want to play it more to it out.  The fact that the free version is fun to play and has not limited it or just a teaser to make you buy the full version is a real plus!
0443069522|4.0|This is a pretty decent anatomy book - it's detailed enough if you aren't in a graduate or high-level course, and is plenty sufficient for those just wanting to learn.
B002DQDV6Y|4.0|Like the first movie, this one looks a lot like the book does in your head when you read it, but I didn't particularly care for some of..............the oddly-placed.............pauses, and I can't fathom why the filmmaker wasn't more true to the book when Harry reaches the chamber.
B00AMBLXP8|4.0|Then you will probably enjoy this &#34;grandma's boy/half baked&#34; comedy with several raunchy one liners. Mila K is super hot too.
B00A11AN6O|5.0|Even though I haven't used it yet.  I liked the fact that I have the extra storage to place my pictures in when I get the time to put them in it.
B008BSPQ3E|5.0|First off, I'm not going to be reviewing the album as I see some have. It's just that if this album weren't amazing, you wouldn't be looking at customer reviews or seriously considering purchasing this set in the first place and I wouldn't be writing this right now. The album is a masterpiece - bottom line. And for those who weren't completely satisfied with this because it didn't include the b-sides or videos, I shake my head. If its videos you want, give PG's \\"Play: The Videos\\" DVD a try. And if you want to view them for free, simply go to his website or his YouTube channel. If its the b-sides you want, I understand those aren't really available anywhere else. I do know some can be found on YouTube. And although I don't think they were essential to the set and might not have been in the \\"So\\" album context, I must admit that PG and his team should have them available somewhere for those real big fans of those mixes, b-side songs, etc. But personally I think that PG went farther than he had to on this box set which I openly applaud.<br />When I first looked into this box set in October, I was a little confused on what was included. The contents included in this box set are...<br /><br />The original \\"So\\" album remastered on both CD and vinyl<br />Extra tracks \\"Courage\\" and \\"Sagrada\\" with alternate mix of \\"Don't Give Up\\" on separate vinyl<br />\\"So\\" DNA - a step-by-step process of the creation of the \\"So\\" album<br />\\"Live in Athens 1987\\" (or \\"P.o.V.\\") remastered on DVD<br />\\"Live in Athens 1987\\" audio on CD<br />60-page book<br />\\"Classic Albums\\" documentary<br />*All tracks available on vinyl and some videos from \\"Live in Athens 1987\\" are also available on digital download*<br /><br />First off, the \\"So\\" remaster sounds amazing - on both CD and vinyl. Really - the album sounds truly gorgeous. And that's all I have to say about that. The second vinyl record with the extra tracks and alternate of \\"Don't Give Up\\" are also a nice addition. \\"Courage\\" and \\"Sagrada\\" are great songs and the other version of \\"Don't Give Up\\" is beautiful. Before I talk about the DNA, let me point out that there's a video on PeterGabriel.com and YouTube that gives more about the extra tracks and the DNA that I recommend you see before purchasing this box set just once; it gives a more in-depth look at this awesome \\"bonus feature\\" to the album than any customer review can. But let me say for me the DNA was a wonderful and interesting experience. Moving on, the \\"Live in Athens\\" stuff is amazing. I loved \\"P.o.V.,\\" but the version I have seen is really bad quality. I still loved the show, though, which is one of the many reasons that propelled me to get this particular set. The quality of the remaster is truly artful; you can tell PG and his team spent countless hours restoring this show to modern-day-concert-film status and it shows. It looks and sounds better than I have ever known and I'm glad this marvelous show got this marvelous treatment. Same goes for the audio CD - I love live CDs and since every performance in \\"Live in Athens\\" is amazing this was yet another plus to this whole set that made this a seriously desirable piece of music. The 60-page book is nice; it includes some cool photos and an introduction by Peter Gabriel. And the \\"Classic Albums\\" documentary is very interesting for those who love this album.<br />Now about those digital downloads... I was quite excited when I found out that what was on vinyl is also available for download. I love things in both \\"hard copy\\" and digital form. The download went through without a hitch, but then I had to go through this whole hassle to get them to play. I found out that iTunes doesn't accept FLAC files, which is the form the downloads are in, and I had to download Songbird separately to play the material. Now Songbird is a great program, but I just like all of my stuff in the same place. By now I'm used to it, but I was sort of confused in the first place. I don't quite understand that if a good chunkof your listening public uses iTunes you wouldn't include a download that is compatible with that software. Shrug.<br />Bottom line - I loved this set. I am completely satisfied with it. It was definitely worth it to me. The album is amazing and its great that its 25th anniversary was celebrated so well. Highly recommended indeed.
B006YTTVHO|3.0|I really wanted to read this book, it is one I have looked forward to reading on the new Kindle Fire with Amazon Prime, too, that my children gave me for this past Christmas (2012).  BUT, since, even WITH Amazon Prime, I was told by Amazon customer service that I am only allowed one FREE download book and ONE PER MONTH on the book from the LENDING LIBRARY per MONTH.  I read Moby Dick in one sitting.<br /><br />Wish I could have read it.  Sad that Amazon sold me and my children a bill of goods.  So when I wanted to return the Kindle Fire, I found out that I would be charge a fee of 30 (thirty) PERCENT of the value of my Kindle Fire and forget about returning the leather cover.  Not a chance of returning that leather cover.

B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I love this game. its very addicting and it keeps you coming back. Fact that it notifies you when all your coins have regenerated is a blessing and a curse.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|Right now this is my daughter's favorite game!  She plays it all the time.  I am happy that it keeps her challenged and it was free, which is always a plus!
030759565X|5.0|I, too, had the thought that I could just follow her blog, but got this for Christmas and am so glad I did. This is a spectacular cookbook. The pictures are gorgeous, the book quality itself is very nice, and I just read through all the stories and recipes like an actual book. Have made a few so far, but am considering pulling a Julie and Julia and making every single one.<br />A note: This isn't an under-30-minutes cookbook - the recipes take some time and require actual cooking work, like grating and sieves and letting dough rise - so it's not for everyone. But it is great if you value real ingredients and enjoy the process of cooking.
1409136612|5.0|This is another wonderful book by the late Meave Binchy.  If you ever wanted to 'see' into how your adult children feel when you first toss them out of the nest, well this is an eye opener.  It is also a good, quick read.  It is meant to read on a short plane trip or on a lazy Sunday afternoon.  I read it in less than two hours, while waiting for an appointment at my VA Hospital.
B002UBRFDC|4.0|An English pilot in a Dutch vessel after an epic voyage goes aground in the Japans in the 16th Century.  A huge clash of cultures is woven into the text:  English and Japanese samurai culture, (Gaijin - Barbarian in the Land of the Gods).  Portugese and Spanish mercantile interests, suave Jesuits and unclean Spanish Franciscans, a powerful samurai leader and his clever planned steps to the Shogunate, overall ruler and military leader of Japan.  Also the clash between the Japanese culture of honourable Death and the European clutch on Life.  And this is all woven around a love story between the Anjin-san (the renamed English pilot) and Mariko-sama the beautiful high-born Japanese woman.<br />A really clever, superbly integrated story with multiple parallel themes.  But it is complex so it is not a book for the faint-hearted, but I do believe it is the best of Clavell's Asian novels.
B008DM4OTA|3.0|My daughter like it but it need to have more activities for children to do to be able to play for longer before getting bored doing the same thing over again and again.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I was a little concerned after reading the mixed reviews,but I have found no problems and great functionality on my Kindle Fire HD.  Thanks for a great app!

B0044RUSZM|4.0|Works and looks awesome . The only thing that might bother you is the springing bouncing it does when you type or rest your wrist on it, but if your gentle its not to bad . if you have a tap click it would most likely shake for fast 5 count.
B004SBULWE|5.0|A good app for closing all the opened stuff on an android.  Before finding this, we couldn't figure out how to close stuff and speed up the tablet.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|This Kindle Fire case is great.  It is durable, versatile, and not too bulky.  I have the black one, and it is stylish but not too flashy.  It is definitely the best Kindle case I have seen.
B005WYFLNU|5.0|I was very pleased with these books.  They were of very good quality and provided lots of room for individual interpretation.  In fact, I wanted to play with them!
B009MCRHH6|5.0|I love this game! It was free on Christmas, but I would have paid the $4.99. Some levels are easy and some are frustratingly hard.

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This has to be my favorite book by Colleen. She certainly knows how to stir the soul with an emotional heart wrenching story. I laughed, I cried, I got angry, & I fell in love with Holder too. Definitely worth a second read!!
B009IRVSVQ|1.0|I heard the single \\"Locked Out of Heaven\\" on the radio and wtf? That song is the most blatant rip off of The Police I've ever heard. Everyone sings this guys praises about how 'unique' and 'original' he is???    There is no hope for music and humanity when I hear s*** like that.    I award you no points and may god have mercy on your soul.

B002T9H2L0|5.0|Having been a Tarantino fan since True Romance, I can say that he continues to put out well done movies, with excellent stories.  Which each new movie he continues to refine his story telling.<br /><br />Inglourious Basterds was an excellent film and a great story.  Brad Pitt delivers an excellent performance.  The story is well told and enjoyable. While the movie isnt for people that dont like violence, if you enjoy an amazing story with fully fleshed out characters, I highly recommend this movie.
B0055SWM08|5.0|This game is truly Zen. I like playing it before bed for relaxation. The music just simply makes the game. Totally worth the purchase!
B001U0HBQ0|5.0|What would like be like if you could only grow younger? The Curious Case of Benjamin Button attempts to answer that question in a beautiful & exquisite way.<br />Without going way into depth - this really is an amazing film.  It succeeds because it brings the content to life in a realistic way that really draws the viewer in.<br />Even more importantly, there is a lot to be learned from watching this movie.  It is a long meditative film that really makes you think.<br />The Curious Case of Benjamin Button was directed by David Fincher & is loosely based on the 1922 short story of the same name by F. Scott Fitzgerald.<br />The film stars Brad Pitt & Cate Blanchett. To keep things simple Benjamin Button (Pitt) is born a very old man. Throughout the film he grows younger.<br />His love interest is Daisy Fuller (Blanchett).  Its interesting to watch because their love seems very pure.  The characters story is very unique but it seems like an<br />ordinary love story.  In a sense,  Benjamin Button's life is not that much different from a normal existence. A person is born, they live, they love, and they sail into the abyss.<br />This is life and the majority of the experience depends greatly on personal perspective.  The movie is long but it is a worthwhile adventure.<br />The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is a good film for mediative & thoughtful times.
B002ZG97LK|4.0|Being a fan of the original I think they did a pretty good job with the remake.  However I purchased this for my daughter who absolutely loves the movie.  She received it for Christmas and has already watched it 3+ times.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This show keeps you intrigued. It is not like anything I have ever seen.  It is a much watch drama. The zombie stuff isn't my thing, but the complexity of the relationships and the quest for survival keeps you hooked.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This is one of the best books that I have read on proof of the afterlife! I will go back to read again and again whenever I need the extra hope of what awaits mankind. The fact that it was written by a Doctor makes it the more effective. This book is so full of hope and wonder!
B004ZG5F28|5.0|When this first came out on TV I didn't really give it a chance and years later I actually watched the whole thing.  Then I wanted to see it again and again.  The main character's lack of finesse  makes you cringe and feel embarrassed for her.  You keep wishing you could help her and really start rooting for her to have a better chance at life.  You also can relate to many things that happens to her.<br /><br />It's just plain entertaining and now I watch it all I want too.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|A must see! Very funny and Fat Amy was awesome! This is waaaay better than the average music movie. If you like comedies you'll like this one.
B0076DELIG|5.0|This is definitely a must for all Michael Connelly fans and it certainly should convince first time readers to read his other books.  Harry Bosch remains Harry Bosch in every way that makes him so satisfying to follow throughout his trials and tribulations.  In Harry Bosch, Michael Connelly has created a character that always makes me anxious to pick up his exploits in the next novel.  Long live Harry Bosch!
B003JTHXOK|4.0|I was drawn into the story and really liked the way it was built up! I apppreciated the way the author introduced the characters and how he incorporated the background of domestic abuse. Now I want to see the movie. I think this author is a great story teller!
B00A77II0U|5.0|I played this game while in hospital. it took me three days to finish which is great for the price. it was just challenging enough to keep me entertained. the map that shows where you have things to do is very helpful I didn't even need the guide at all. loved it beginning to end
B003719G40|5.0|Easy to read; lots of sample anecdotes showing powerful changes by applying the information.<br />Even after more than 40 years of marriage, including many courses, books and seminars, this book is the best help we have ever come across. We are seeing results only two days after finishing it.<br />Everyone, whether in a relationship or not, deserves to read this book. It can improve, save or restore nearly any relationship where the two parties are willing to learn.
B00APUQMD4|4.0|I liked this it took a bit to figure out what was happening, I had to watch it a couple times to get a good idea of what was going on.<br />All in all if your a fan it's worth the a watch.
B00571F26Y|5.0|I read this book, almost in its entirety on New Year's Day, 2012. From that day forward, I gave up wheat and changed my eating habits drastically. At first it was hard but very quickly I got the hang of eating differently. I lost 12 pounds in the first 14 days of going wheat free and never felt hungry or exercised.<br /><br />It's been a full year since I read the book and I've lost 35 pounds pretty effortlessly. The information contained in this book is both informative and interesting (albeit clinical at times). Everything Dr. Davis says makes sense and it's hard to ignore the effect wheat has had on all of our lives once you understand what it is we're eating.<br /><br />I told a friend of mine that eating wheat-free is both the hardest and the easiest thing I've ever done to lose weight at get healthy. Hard because you have to think about what you're eating and make good choices -- easy because there's no counting, measuring, weighing or anything! I just eat meats, poutry, fish, eggs, vegetables, nuts, seeds and some small amounts of fruits. I call it the beef, butter and bacon diet!
159448385X|5.0|A marvelous story of life in Afghanistan. Everyone should read it to have a real life view of this complex culture.
B004FVHBXY|5.0|Great  movie! Unlike any other one out there. Leonardo makes the movie for sure. A must must see for anyone.
B007SGM084|5.0|I have read so many book, but never a book sooo intense before.  Recommended reading to all my lady friends.
B004EPYZUS|5.0|Lots of action, changes of scenery, and thrills. Great cast, exotic locales and plenty of twists to keep you on the edge if your seat.
B005C0DHEY|5.0|great documentary and one thing I noticed was people feel powerless.  But they are not, we have guns for just this sort of reason.  Point the business end at the drillers and pull.
B006ZDS7CE|5.0|Really love Lana Del Rey's voice and style of music. It's a mix of older &#34;Americana&#34; style pop and newer alt rock that is dark, sensuous, and catchy. Would recommend this to a wide range of people.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I have loved the Enders game Series since I first read this book about 8 months ago. I have now also read the other 3 books in the Enders Saga, which are a little slower. I also read Ender's Shadow, which is set at the same time as Ender's Game and lead me to read the book again. I would recommend it to anyone.
B00AJRQLTI|4.0|...but I wish it had been a double album and included more of the music. I was disappointed at what was left out, but what was in here was good and let me watch the movie in my head again.
B00785P2QC|4.0|Addictive game. Could be a bit more user friendly.  So far so good. I like that not having friends doesn't limit play.
B004ALB8OM|2.0|A slow burn of a wrestler who's life is in the toilet. Best part was the 48-year old, but still amazingly gorgeous Marisa Tomei as the on-again, off-again love interest/stripper/mother of a small child.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I love this game....I'm a mom of 3 and I really like playing this game...hope that you enjoy it as much as I have
B00AESN8XY|5.0|I waited two years for this app to come out on kindle it is so awsome. My brother had this game on his I touch and I searched every day for it on the app store. This is my favorite game, have beat it 100% on my bros I touch. I love the details put into this game. I SHALL DESTROY THE WORLD MUHAHAHAHAHAH!!!!!!!!!!
B0034G4P7G|5.0|This was a Christmas gift for my sister. She has been wanting to see the movie. Now that she has she really enjoys the movie.
B009LA1R34|4.0|In Habitame Siempre, Thalia sounds secure and confident as a vocalist. The music is exquisitely produced and the lyrics are smart and sharp. The songs are mostly powerful, emotinal ballads as well as catchy upbeats. The genres hop from traditional pop to cumbia to bachata to bossa nova, and more! It is truly exciting to hear Thalia sing so strong and comfortably and particularly exciting since she kept away from the trashy and predictable 'clubby' style that has currently taken over the music industry. Thalia... well done!
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I purchased this book for my grandson but read it first to determine whether it was age appropriate for him, yet, as he is youinger than the age span,recommended... although he is an avid reader.<br /><br />I loved the topic and how the author wove the tale with looking at the issue from diferent perspectives. It ws also a special story for me because I taught diasability awareness and respect to students in the same age category as the students in this book. It was an 18 year career of joy for me, as my students were incredibly receptive to people with all disabilities, as evidenced by the class visits as part of the program following experiential activities!<br /><br />Hence.. I loved Wonder, In fact, my niece also sent my grandson, Wonder with a note that he will want to discuss it with his grandma (me!)
B005LAIHZY|5.0|This s a really great movie. Watched it with the grand kids & they loved it! Now, one of our favorites.
B000HKW7E0|5.0|This is probably the best Christmas comedy of all time.  Looks pretty good in bluesy considering it is a 90's movie
B004Z2TUGE|1.0|Oh my god I could not sit through this. I am only writing this review because it was just that awful. I would rate it zero stars if possible.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|OMG. I could not believe this book and how amazing it was. Wow. So intense and filled with surprises. It sure kept me going. I loved it. Can't wait for more from this author. Thanks!!!
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|WOW! This movie is one of my favorites for 2012! Action packed - it had my interested from the first frame till the last. Can't wait for sequel.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|This is probably the best of all the Batman series.  The bluray quality is outstanding and the audio is excellent
1609611543|3.0|This is a book for a person who is serious about what they eat.  I had a hard time with it.
B001GKJ2DY|5.0|I have to laugh at all the self-righteous blowhards who came here to criticize everything about this film! Of course this is not 'Citizen Kane' or 'Gone With The Wind', and it's not meant to showcase the best there is in film-making art! This is a lighthearted, FUN musical, using ABBA's music, filmed in one of the most gloriously beautiful corners of the world (Greek Isles of Skopelos and Skiathos). The film adaptation is very well done, and the movie is pure fun and joy from beginning until end. The actors and actresses are not attempting to outsing the original artists- they are merely lending their own voices and personal feel to the great, classic ABBA songs here. To think otherwise is missing the point. Ignore the naysayers and watch it for yourselves IF you know how to have a good time, that is!
B005LAJ1HW|5.0|Boardwalk Empire: The Complete Second Season (Blu-ray/DVD Combo + Digital Copy) (2011)<br />It was fine. Cleared up many questions about later season.
0307346617|5.0|I gave this book to my husband as a Christmas gift. He requested it and he loves it. I'm happy that he's happy.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|I thought the first 2 books were  great, but the series is only getting better.  A fun read, am looking forward to the next book.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I have seen the movie before I read the book, but the book still surprised me in many ways and filled in a lot of gaps that the movie left. I thought it was amazing, and I've just downloaded the second book, and I'm going to read it right now
B0089K7DGW|4.0|It was fine, but the episodes were hard to move through. I don't have any further comments about this item.
B00A8ECU24|1.0|this is cute but I let my little sister play and she spent $ 99.99 on gems. I found out bc I went to check my email and there was a order for gems! I'll never play again. too bad. it was VERY CUTE!!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this is amazingggg! I love this app and I deffinatlly recommend it! also get the new update for it and it will be lil nyc and its so awesome trust me
B009RI4ZKC|2.0|It's a movie for children and young teens.  It's so corny that you can hear the corn popping.  Plot is implausible, characters are cute but unconvincing.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Vince Flynn is outstanding again! Plot line exciting and well though out. If this is your first Flynn book be sure and check out his others, you won't be disappointed.
B0076DELIG|4.0|Michael Connelly gets four stars writing his usual exciting Hary Bosch novel.  It's not five stars because of the predictable nature of Harry Bosch's ability to solve crimes. But, if you like straight-shooting Harry Bosch, that may not be all of a bad thing.  Harry has to deal not only with a criminal group but his boss in solving this 20 year old crime that occurs during the Watts riots.  Complicating matters is Harry's fumbling with his inexperience dealing with his teen age daughter without the help of a wife/mother.  Starting with very little to go on - and even that was his own crime scene data - Harry takes a 20 year old cold case and gradually unfolds the mysteries to nail the perpetrators.  Not the most exciting finish ever, but good fun reading, especially if you're a Harry Bosch fan.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I wasn't sure about this book at first but after the first chapter things really pick up and a wonder story developed. This isn't a history book but it offers a realistic view of the late 1950's and early 1960's. A great read that will entertain you for days.
B00A9X9VAI|5.0|As a big fan of twist-ending movies I will put this on my top 20 list.  And the little kid who play Sid is evil incarnate - or is he?
B0076DCT2G|5.0|Nelson DeMille ranks right up there with his peers! &#34;The Panther&#34; is another exciting and well-written story from DeMille. Read all his books.
B00APUQT7I|5.0|This movie was funny and entertaining for the whole family. I have 9 and 11 year old boys and they found it very enjoyable.
B00AHSGNJM|5.0|WHat a fantastic movie!!! Everyone in my household loves it! The story is wonderful and the characters are so loveable.....not to mention the animation is absolutely breath taking. DOnt miss this!!
B000000H64|5.0|I bought this CD because, shockingly, I noticed I didn't have it in my Fear Factory CD collection.  Once it arrived, the songs are great back-to-back.  In my opinion, this is their best CD yet.  My Fear Factory collection is now complete.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|I really enjoyed this book.  The love scenes are so descriptive and will pull the reader in from the very beginning. I imagine Connor being breathtakingly handsome. Easy read.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Wonderful to be able to pick up an episode when I have time... can't wait for Season 3 to start!
B0031ESIZQ|3.0|My boys really liked this when I got it for them, and wanted to play it quite a bit.  However, after a month or so, the newness definitely wore off, and they don't play it anymore.
B009DT9ANW|4.0|Did not see the shows in Milwaukee or NYC where the recordings were made (until now)<br />Lots of great guitar solos and a solid band backing up Peter.<br />Great new versions of some past favorites. There are some great Humble Pie favorites on here too.<br />Extra interview on how Peter was reunited with his famous Les Paul was an interesting feature.<br />I feel lots of great music is to come in the future being he has this great instrument back in his artistic hands.<br />I got to see him on the last date of his US tour in Nashville. This DVD brings back great memories of that show even though it was not recorded there.
B00A8ECU24|3.0|This game is fun and I also like the way it really shows the ponies and their houses like what it looks like on the show.<br />I also like the way all of it is 3d.
0345803485|1.0|This book was terrible, and I expected so much more from this book. There isn't much to the book besides sex. The book does not flow very well and some of the characters are not introduced well. The sex scenes were nothing special.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|This is an incredible story and an amazing production. If you like the genre and can take some violence, you will appreciate a great series for adults and enjoy the ride. I can't wait for season 2 to be available!
B00A1EOBJQ|3.0|The music is great except not enough of it. There should have been a few more tracks on this CD
B003WUYRGI|1.0|I picked this rating because it was boring and long and not really exciting. Make it a little more  interesting by adding some dollar. Also made definitions shorter. Okay.
B007W8S2MG|5.0|This game is exactly what the vita needs! I absolutely enjoy playing this game on my morning and evening NYC subway commute!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I had never read a King novel until 11/22/63, but the description of it appealed to me.Once I started reading, I was hooked.  Jake, the narrator, quickly became a real person, a character I felt an investment in.  Maybe part of that feeling about him is that I too am an English teacher.  For wharever reason, he became someone I knew and cared about, as did Sadie when she entered the scene. I could not imagine how the assasination was going to end.  I couldn't stop reading. I ran (hobbled) with them every inch of the way to Book Depository. I could see what Jake had in mind after Sadie died, but I wasn't totally prepared for what he found on his return to 2011, although I should have known.  After all,\\"the past is obdurate.\\"  Once Jake returned to 2011 after his reset, I was ready for the end, but King didn't end where I thought he was going to, and I am glad he didn't.  This one of those novels that will last.  I thorougly enjoyed the read and Stephen King.
B000001F2H|5.0|Did you like this one? So you have to listen to A Hard Road (1967), from Bluesbreakers.<br /><br />This was the album that catapulted Eric Clapton - then just a band member of John Mayall - the category of &#34;god&#34; to the British youth in the second half of the sixties. Released between the period when the guitarist left the Yardbirds and Cream rode, this album is still considered the best British blues album of all time and the result of the presence of Mayall proverbial within the English music scene.
0670024813|5.0|Jared Diamond specializes in taking our comfortable, pre-conceived notions and upending them.  In his The Third Chimpanzee, Guns, Germs, and Steel, and Collapse he examined the reasons why some societies succeed in becoming \\"modern\\" while others don't, and why even the most successful of societies run the risk of failure or sudden collapse.  Now in The World Until Yesterday Diamond knocks the props out from under our assumptions once again by comparing \\"civilized\\" societies with their more traditional counterparts.  Diamond has been thinking about these ideas for a long time.  When I was teaching AP World History I enjoyed using an article he wrote for Discover Magazine back in the 1980s which argued that the development of agriculture had been a mistake, a thesis that inevitably gobsmacked my bright and talented tenth grade students into some really effective critical analyses. The World Until Yesterday reminds me of that article  in its contentious and highly thoughtful arguments.<br /><br />Diamond begins with one of his famous vignettes, a description of an airport in New Guinea, symbolizing the rapid changes that have overtaken that land.  This is a fine entry point for Parts 1 through 4, all of which deal with  multiple comparisons between traditional and modern societies, including examinations of how they maintain law and order, wage war and make peace, treat their children and the elderly, and respond to threats.  I found each of these parts fascinating to read, filled with illuminating anecdotes and sober comparisons between societies that ought to have all of us questioning our most firmly held assumptions. Part 5 was the most interesting part to me, dealing with the evolution of religion, language, and dietary issues like diabetes and hypertension. And coming full circle, the Epilogue begins with Diamond's arrival at Los Angeles International Airport, a spring board for more comparisons and his final comments.<br /><br />When you see Diamond's name on a book cover you know you are in for a fascinating read that will startle  and at times irritate you, but you'll come away from it with a deeper appreciation for the complexities of our world and its variegated human societies. Now that we are well into the second decade of the twenty-first century such an appreciation, with an accompanying discarding of ill-conceived notions based on flawed assumptions, is essential.book cover you know you are in for a fascinating read that will startle  and at times irritate you, but you'll come away from it with a deeper appreciation for the complexities of our world and its variegated human societies.

B004SJ3BCI|3.0|This game is fun at first but once you get past a certain part it gets hard and frustrating. But it is OK
B003JTHXOK|5.0|THIS BOOK WAS GREAT! I COULDN'T STOP READING IT. I READ THE BOOK IN TWO DAYS!!!!!!!!!! THE STORY ABOUT KATIE AND ALEX IS AMAZING.
B00006878K|5.0|Did you like this one? So you have also to listen to I'll Play the Blues for You (1972), from Albert King!<br /><br />Although he recorded many albums, Albert King never received the credit he deserved because of his excellence as a player and as a bluesman. Everything changed when he signed with the legendary Stax label, and on the first album released by new home in 1966, with the support of the group Booker T. & The MG's in the recordings. The union between the King and the biting guitar sound basis and full of sauce provided a funky band repertoire as killer as classic, with the title track, \\"Oh, Pretty Woman,\\" \\"The Hunter\\" and \\"Laundromat Blues,\\" later re-recorded by Clapton, Gary Moore, Rory Gallagher and Free respectively. Great album!
B009JZVT70|5.0|Good entertainment that keeps me away from all the reality BS that is out there. I watch TV and movies to escape reality for a short time. The first season seemed a bit better than the second, but once we got a few episodes into it, I warmed up to the new story line.
B006O6F932|4.0|My daughter loved this! Exactly what she expected and she spends lots of time enjoying it:) I would definately give this a gold star!
B00A77II0U|4.0|This game is scary, and interesting to play!!<br /><br />I like the fact that it takes you to rooms and you find hidden objects to unlock other objects during the game!!
0060775858|5.0|All six of my grandchildren have been lulled to sleep by this kind and gentle nighttime story. A great gift for a baby shower. Grandparents should also keep a copy for the little ones' visits.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I got this a several months ago and at Christmas time a few of us women were raving about it.  Now my husband is loving it too.  LOVE IT!  waiting one more day to see the first of season 3 on PBS.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Absolutely adores this book not to mention the rest of the series. I highly recommended it for the Harry potter or twilight lover.
B00AHSINKO|2.0|The previews led me to believe the movie would have a serious undertone but with much humor however this is not at all the case.  Initially there are some funny moments between the husband and therapist and you think there will be more to follow, however there are not.  It is well acted of course with such a great cast, but the story and relationship between the couple develops very little.  Overall the movie is slow and rather depressing!
1455519006|5.0|Great story. My daughter took it out of my hands the moment I finished it! I will await his future novels.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Havent read John Grisham for a few years. Found this book a page turner  The plot was different and I couldn't figure out what was going to happen. Definitely recommend it.
B006ATJXQW|5.0|Best book ever if you like a lot suspends and lot of adventure who ever reads this book is going have a lot of fun
1481278738|5.0|I bought this book after watching the author's utube videos.  I found the book very helpful for me in learning about something totally new to me.  I am gettting more and more confident with this camera because of the information in the book and the how easy it is to follow.  I'm glad there is a book like this out there for people like me.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|As always, king makes it look easy.  Although it is not my favorite book, it was well worth the time and money invested.
B0087ZG7HK|2.0|Movie is great as always. But...maybe I'm just unlucky. The first DVD I ordered was right and had digital copy (which is a download code for the electronic movie and bonus features files), but the DVD was all scratched up. The replacements (twice now) from Amazon have come without digital copy, and the \\"100th Anniversary\\" special jacket. It's possible that they've run out of the 100th anniversary DVDs, and are just sending out regular ones mistaking them for the described product. What the heck. Still enjoyable, and the special effects still look believable all these years later.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Even though it will cost $2.99 to do the whole game including the last chapters and bonus chapter it is well worth it.  All of the annoying glitches of other games are not here. The grammar and spelling is good (that is a pet peeve of mine) and the clicking works when you find objects. The hidden object games are a bit more creative than usual. The puzzles have little clues when you first see them so you know what you are looking for. Even if you don't spring for the cost the free part has a nice length and quite a few games. Hat tipped to the creators - the screens are not so dark so my old eyes can actually see most hidden objects. A nice and fun game.
B00915G6MG|5.0|This is currently on pre order but my grandson has all the other seasons.  we have watched them so many times we almost know the script by heart
B005LAIHZY|5.0|It was really great to see a Disney fantasy fairy tale-ish movie where the heroine DIDN'T go ga-ga over a prince. The animation is lovely as always and the voices are a perfect fit.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Enjoyed the book can't wait to finish the series.  I would recommend this book to anyone who likes a good read.
B003WEA4UM|4.0|I had much more sense of where and when I was in the story-lines in the ebook than in the movie, which also had to cut out several senarios
B008DYZKQE|5.0|When I saw this available for review on NetGalley, I just about jumped out of my chair in excitement.  I loved this book as a child, and read it over and over and over again.  I was similarly ecstatic when I saw the Kindle version on Amazon for $1.89.  Needless to say, my kids have now read it over and over and over again.<br /><br />The Paper Bag Princess is a classic book that no child should ever grow up without, and I am shocked and appalled at how many people have never heard of it.  Robert Munsch wrote a brilliant story, entirely original in concept and execution.  Truly a classic.  I am more than overjoyed to see this book back in print.<br /><br />The Illustrations:  The artwork in this book is 100% fantastic.  I love the way Princess Elizabeth is depicted, and the dragon is full of personality and character.  Michael Martchenko has infused his illustrations with expression and story telling.  The pictures are the perfect fit for this book.  By the way, this was his FIRST picture book project! Amazing.<br /><br />If your childhood was deprived of this wonderful book, please do not bestow the same injustice on your own kids.  This book is a must-have for any children's home library!
B007712XAU|5.0|It is one of the very best series I've seen and purchased it for a gift.  They so enjoyed it as well.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|This is a great movie! We saw it in the theater and had to buy it when it came out on DVD. Great message!
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|Great movie for kids and adults, too!  A nice, moral message without being preachy.  As a mom who is also adopted, it kind of explains to them that there are families of all kinds...but the thing they have in common (even the ones with minions) is love.
B004DM0UII|4.0|Does what I need with an excellent interface. The streaming also alows you to pause the music and resume on the same part you were hearing.<br /><br />Works perfect on a Google Nexus 7.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Even though I seen the movie first the book was amazing! So excited to read book 2. For sure a great read.
B008FYZIVY|4.0|wonderfully fun to watch, Maggie Smith is just a joy. However it should be noted that this version is not in High Def
0743270754|5.0|Let's be frank: reading is more fun than reviewing. Reviewing steals time from reading. Nobody needs another review of this immense book. Therefore I won't review it; if you like, you can presume that I'm not even here on this page. But I have a few tangential thoughts to offer:<br /><br />1) The film Lincoln is no more \\"based\\" on this book than it is on the whole history of the War-to-Protect-and-Expand-Slavery (aka the Civil War) in general. The passage of the Thirteenth Amendment and the assassination of Lincoln - the subjects of the film -  are covered in about thirty pages toward the end of the huge book, which is a multi-person biography of the four men who aspired to be the Republican candidate for President in 1860, beginning from their childhoods. Seeing the film, therefore, is no substitute for reading the book, and reading the book will not radically confirm or contradict any impressions you've formed from seeing the film.<br /><br />2) Any imbecile who still argues that \\"the War wasn't about slavery\\" or that \\"Lincoln didn't intend to free the slaves\\" would need to be in a terminal stupor to finish this book without changing her/his mind.<br /><br />3) It's a powerful book, based on massive research and thorough assimilation of previous research. If you have any urge to make sense of American history, even the most recent, you ought to read it.
B005J6LKVI|5.0|I love this movie and teaches us about history and it's shameful that it was that way at one time.
B0086700CM|4.0|I love this game it is so much fun and I really really like it and its SO addictive!!!!! I think everyone should try it
B000KJT8IG|5.0|One of the funniest movies.  Great to watch at Christmas every year.  I don't usually purchase movies, but this is a classic.
B000W9399S|3.0|I had heard a lot about Terry Pratchett's Disc World, so I was curious about it. I thought this would be a good way to get into the series. Some folks said that this wasn't a good entry into the series, and maybe they're right. I don't have anything to compare it to, but I found it difficult to read. I plodded through it anyway because after a time, I got curious to see what happened. Maybe I'll try one of the other books before I give up on it, but I found it difficult to read.
0811875555|5.0|My daughter requested several art concept books for Christmas.  Not knowing what these books were about, I looked at this one in particular when it arrived.  What beautiful drawings on how the movie was brought about.  My daughter was thrilled when she opened the boxes on Christmas Day.
B005LAII8K|1.0|Bad bad movie.<br />How come the goal is to kid a child?<br />Tell that to the people in Newtown....should ban crap like this.
B008Y1YJ90|5.0|The Arthur Christmas (Blu-ray + UV Copy) [2011][Region Free] Came in good time (10 day), when it was Dispatched from United Kingdom to USA. My come from United Kingdom.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|What a lovely book.  I had it for several years and then ignored it.... this time, i got it for my kindle and couldn't put it down.  There are scenes from the book that I won't forget.  It will be interesting to see how the movie handles them.
1452101426|5.0|Purchased several art concept books for my daughter who is an art major in college.  She loved this one as she had seen the movie 3 times.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|so far this has been fairly simple I love the games from G5 hidden objects and mysteries are my fav keep up great work!
B001OGNJYI|5.0|My knowledge of the original R&B is not well enough to give a valid opinion however I've been listening to them since my days of youth thanks to the OG's that lived on my block however when I was young I could care less but because I'm getting older my taste in music is changing as well so now I can understand why this man was such a legend an why the older cats were bumping this man's sound round the block plus  there are a few tracks on here 4 that special some one an she'll get once the tack comes on
B007RTAR64|5.0|Saw the commercial this summer, swore I'd get it for her for xmas, she forgot and was surprised at the semi-joke gift, looks great in box :)
1557048630|5.0|Purchased several art concept books for my daughter who is an art major in college.  Asked her what she wanted for Christmas and she gave me a list of art concept books.  Christmas morning she was thrilled that I got every concept book she requested.
B00AMBK0X4|1.0|As someone who watches and enjoys Family Guy - this was not good.  I imagine the first screenplay meeting went like this:<br />&#34;OK Guys, we have 2.5 hours of unrestricted joke time.  Everybody write down 4 of your favorite jokes or crudest thoughts.&#34;<br />5 minutes later - &#34;OK let's collect them up.  Joe, you shuffle them.  Mike, lay them out in order and fill in the blanks with whatever lame storyline you can come up with.&#34;<br />20 minutes later - &#34;Done? Good.  Let's start filming.&#34;<br />Crude just to be crude is not that funny after the first 10 minutes.  2 hours of it is painful.
B000VHMF0A|5.0|well for any fan of bob's talents I'm sure that you already have all the records and all the live albums however this album offers what most fans already have on seperate albums in one place plus it was offered in mp3 since most of my cd's hae seen their way around the block once or twice so I needed this one Long Live da Jah Man
B002BI6SMI|4.0|I thought it was a good movie and enjoyed watching it. Waiting to check out Taken 2 to see if it measures up or passes Taken..
1452111014|5.0|Purchased several art concept books for my daughter who is an art major in college.  She loved this one as she had seen the movie 4 times.
B0090X4GLW|5.0|My sister and I are completely infatuated with Pitch Perfect so it made sense to give this to her as a gift. How they remix all the songs and add them together is pure genius! And if you haven't seen the movie, it's a MUST!
B003F3NDP8|5.0|Great show and another one I got for my sister. Came in fast and played perfectly! So Happy with this product!
0307957934|4.0|Bought this as a gift for him (on his wish list.)  He thought it was excellent and has given it to me to read (haven't yet.)
0811879631|5.0|Purchased several art concept books for my daughter who is an art major in college.  She loves all Pixar movies.
B000KKPN5C|5.0|The flash still works flawlessly (I'm a hobbyist, not a professional) after four years of use.  I have no complaints.
B004YM6JLO|5.0|I am completely thrilled with my order in whole. I received my product in a very short amount of time. Amazon did a great job and the product was in excellent condition. I love this show and recommend anyone that likes shows like Supernatural or True Blood to watch this show!
B005MJ883K|5.0|I ordered 3 different levels of this game and gave 2 of them for gifts.  My 6 year old grandson loves it, my 23 year old son loves it, I love and my 83 year old father loves it. Takes patience and a steady hand both enjoyable and frustrating at the same time.
B000SGGUWS|5.0|I am 10 years old and all I have to say is I loved this book it's so amazing it's better than the tv series I highly recommend u get this book and I've read alot of books and this is going on my favorite list for sure
B000O8OTNC|5.0|A great little knife sharpener. Carbide blades to start an edge and ceramic to hone it. Use it a lot to touch up my CRKT Drifter. The fold out serrated blade sharpener works well too.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Admittedly, I was a bit disappointed in Kill Shot, but The Last Man redeems Flynn in my eyes and then some.  This book grabs you from page one and doesn't let you go -- ever.  Bravo
B0031RAOW8|5.0|This one's a royal tear jerker!  Be sure to have lots of Kleenex available.  Hachi's love for his master was eternal.
B009ZXT4BY|5.0|This game is really fun. I suggest that you buy this one and try it out. Then you should buy the real one. Full version is 3.99 only.
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|I also really like this book because, its good for little kids reading levels. Diary of a wimpy kid books are really good books for kids to read, considering i‘m a 10 year old girl.Jeff Kiney, your a SUPER good author!!!<br /><br />                                              Sincerely,<br />                                       Emily Shyanne
B005GRTNVE|5.0|The camera people did an amazing job, the crowd was awesome, the songs unbelievale. It was as if you yourself was sitting front row. Each of the guys brought to the stage their unique personality. Watching in on your computer and putting the video full screen made it as if you could actually touch each of them.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|These books put you through all the emotions. I love it and I recommend it to everyone. Enjoy as I am. Once I'm done I'm going to cry because I will miss Ana and Christian Grey.
B008GXHOFW|5.0|This is a awesome game to get there is one black suit that is really awesome you should get this game
B0066WJLU6|5.0|works just as it's supposed to,  very easy to use.  illuminates area well.  i definitely recommend it.  good app very pleased
B0096BIENY|5.0|For all you guys/gals who love Il Divo as much as I do will fall more in love with the boys. Their remake of songs such as &#34;Can't Falling In Love&#34; will give you goose bumps and will bring tears to your eyes. Sorry Elvis who will forever stay in my heart but Il Divo especially David has taken your song and has literally made it soar.
B000095K7A|5.0|This album will be among my favorites for the rest of my life. exemplary music, lyrics and beats. Gibbard is a fantastic musician, you will not regret buying this album.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Everyone that I talked to said this was a good book um it took me three days to read it while attending my son. Keep the Fifty Shades coming!
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|love this game!! great way to pass time when you are waiting. this app is a great version for kindle!
B0002ZDVEU|5.0|i enjoyed this movie, and its a great part of the series. i am working on a full collection of the DVDs
B004XE0TDW|5.0|came in great condition, exactly as described. I love this record and highly recommend it to anyone who enjoyed Bon Iver's first album. It's less melancholy, a good transition.
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|I liked the book. The book is very very good and the book is a great deal I'm glad I read it
B00A0SJWQU|5.0|A thrill a minute! Very well done. An excellent adaptation of the original movie. No disappointment here. A must see.
B005LAII1C|1.0|I will be putting this on E-bay for somebody that likes trash<br />If your normal convertation has F*** this and F*** that, its your kind of movie. this is not a movie to show kids, i did not thank goodness.<br />I should get my money back.
B00280LYIC|5.0|I thought it was a very good book, very detailed<br />I really like this author, he writes very interesting books.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I tried a few different spider games and so far this one has the best graphics and the fastest loading time. Not to mention the smoothest card movement.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Fun to play.  Play it whenever I get a few minutes of down time.  Want to get all the games.
B004DM0UII|4.0|Another good reason for the FAOTD. I had idea this app was around. Will be a great way to reconnect with shout cast. Well designed with many options.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Fun game with nice graphics.  Had to think a bit to solve it.  Overall good experience, in my opinion.  Think you'll like it.
B000001EKX|5.0|Also, at this point, Kiss functioned more as a democratic unit than in later years when Simmons and Stanley took over as da de facto leaders of the band. Peter and Ace were still very much \\"in da game\\" @ dis point. Great songs evidence this: Strange Days (Peter lead vocal),the title track, Hotter Than Hell (Ace lead vocal, i believe) Got to Choose, Goin Blind, Parasite and Let Me Go Rock N Roll (Gene Simmons  is also on a roll songwriting-wise on dis joint). Kiss has only one other album in their catalog that even gets close to matching in da \\"heavy\\" category, that would be '83's Creatures Of The Night.
B003CN4R74|3.0|The cd came in very good condition, which is appreciated very much.  I have fun listening to it.<br />Thank you
B000FC1HBY|4.0|Started reading this because it was made into a TV series and as usual the book is a lot better than the movie. He gets really wordy with names and the list of minor characters is immense. It got to the point where I could no longer remember one knight from another but that doesn't detract from the story. In fact I'm in awe as to how in the world he was able to keep all this stuff straight in his own mind.<br />It's well worth reading and don't start it unless you want to get caught up in it. No sooner than you think everything is working out for some character they then fall deeper into something or they just get killed! Definitely a page turned and a grittier &#34;Lord of the Rings&#34; sort of book and not for the kids or young adults unless you want them to read four letter words and sexual situations.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|You better carve out some time for this purchase.  I bought this as a Christmas gift for my parents and now we're all addicted.  Great and entertaining series.
6305603847|5.0|perfect for the time pink floyd was on top gilmour on guitar is always welcome and the best of the best. the movie is good but I onlt got it for the music. since I love floyd
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book is so outstandingly written that I find it hard to believe that any person could read this and not be fully moved by this story. I want to read it an infinite number of times because I have such a refreshed outlook on life. Read this book, I promise you'll get something out of it.
B003O86FMW|4.0|makes me come back for more ,and i will read the next one. peeta is the reason these are so good
B005IKZ1B0|5.0|David Guetta is amazing! I love every song on this album. I had listened to each track individually at one time. Then I realized they were all on this amazing album.  I had to have it. The beats, the vocals, the mixing: it all comes together under David Guetta's direction.
B008RJFRTK|4.0|Ordered for my Kindle Fire to use in the car.<br />Likes: Gives and decent size map with larger overview than my GPS and easy to manipulate<br />Disklikes:  The images are very light in color and some roads don't show clearly.  Searches are awkward.<br />Decent map for the price.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This book kept me completely enthralled. The pace never slowed down. I didn't want to put it down. I can't wait to read more of this series and see what happens next.
B00A7CI82I|4.0|I'm giving it a four instead of a 5 only because so many of my questions about the Bourne Legacy were still left unanswered.  Guess they will make another sequel... Had a lot of good action and was very interesting to watch.  My husband likes these action movies and I enjoyed this one too as it had more than just action... but some drama as well.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Fun little game to play.  It doesn't take much thought but it is fun to watch how it moves along.
B00005JKEZ|5.0|To me Errol Flynn has always been the quint essential &#34;Robin Hood&#34; and then add Olivia DeHavillon, Basil Rathbone and Claude Rains, forget about It!
B002VX0A40|3.0|Our daughter loves Dee Dee. The crinkle wings and mirror tail keep baby entertained. Also, the attachment ring is great for connecting to plastic rings to use when out with baby.<br /><br />I did have one big issue however. The rattle that is attached to the dragon's right hand is made of rather hard plastic. Also, (as you can see in the pictures) the edges of the rattle are dull, but mirror a 'spiked' rattle. My biggest worry was that like most babies, my daughter would grab this toy and swing it back and forth as she plays and perhaps hit herself in the eye/face/head. I can tell you that the plastic rattle ball attached to Dee Dee is hard enough that if that happened it would definitely leave a mark and cause some tears. I was concerned enough that I actually cut the string attaching the rattle portion to Dee Dee to avoid any possible self inflicted injuries.
B00992CF6W|5.0|it is so cool so fun and addicting all in one its expencive yes but worth it buy it and give it 5 stars
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|I love all of the levels and the imaginative ways you get through them. I absolutely adore this app; it is amazing! I hope people who get this app agree. :) give this app a good chance because it will be worth it.
B003ZSI7R2|5.0|a friend of mine got me listening to Vintage Trouble.  I really enjoy this band.  If you like any of the sample sound clips, but the album.  It only gets better.
B009IRVSVQ|5.0|This is one of those CDs on which every track is great.  That doesn't happen too often.  The only down side, is the explicit lyrics.  My husband bought me this as a gift, and didn't notice that it had expicit lyrics.  I can't play this when my son is in the house.  Oh well, good grown up music!
B003O86FMW|5.0|It was good sad and scary. I thought it was awesome but a little bit to much blood then I thought it<br />...
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I so enjoyed this book. For a while it's kind of your play by play of a trial, but then it gets more involved, and the ending just blew me away. I never saw it coming. Definitely five stars!
0451232852|5.0|I learned a lot about the First World War.  The characters were good portrayals of different social groups of the time.
B004HNTER6|5.0|This is one of the best films I've ever seen. Before viewing, I had never noticed Formula 1 or even seen a race. Now, I love F1 and I watch regularly. I quietly cheer for the young Bruno Senna and hope his Uncle Ayrton is looking out for him from above. I can't help but believe that Ayrton Senna had a premonition on the weekend of Imola 1994. He seemed a very sensitive man and clearly he sensed tragedy approaching. You watch the film and be the judge. You will never be sorry you learned about this beautiful, passionate and compassionate man who also happened to be the greatest race car driver we've ever seen. I left this film shocked by the sudden loss of this amazing man but wanting to be a better person, inspired by how Senna lived his life.
B008QTV3X0|5.0|I absolutely loved this show. I got totally caught up in it right from Episode One and can't wait to see Season Two. This is a must see show in my opinion.
0525952926|5.0|This is the second in the trilogy and I can not wait for the third.  Characters are really well portrayed.
B00AMBK6J2|5.0|This is not a kids movie and unless you have some reasonably mature teens not a family movie but its a great guys night out movie with some dirty humor!
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|I purchased this movie as a stocking suffer for this past xmas and then I received an email from Amazon telling me that with my purchase I also got a free rental of this movie on Amazon Video.  I watched it (standard def) and it loaded quickly and played with no issues.  It looked great for standard def.<br /><br />I didn't know I was getting this and was very happy with the playback.
B009HEJXFS|4.0|This was a great movie! Had lots of action and kept you entertained. I recommend watching it especially if you enjoyed the other two.
B001OKGX92|5.0|This is a must own movie for any collection small or large.  The chase sceene is the one that set the bar every movie after this one.  I now have a copy on DVD, Blue-Ray and Ihave downloaded a copy to my Kendle Fire.
B0095R64AO|2.0|My wife wanted to watch this and I reluctantly agreed.  Se really liked it, found it funny and generally a decent romantic comedy.  I never got into it.  The basic plot just did not grab me so the rest of the movie just kind of went blah for me.  I wish I could give a better description but really I just lost interest in the first 20 minutes and rest is a blur when I try to remember it.<br /><br />One thing I can add is that we rented this on Amazon Video and continue to have a great experience with it.  We use a PS3 as our Blu-ray and ome media player.
B001KDQ4KQ|4.0|I recommend all her books, maybe not this one as much as her others , but well worth reading.<br />There is always an underlining story of right and wrong.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|Jess says it was amazing.<br />I'd listen to her opinion. Considering she didn't previously like Batman. Now she wants to buy them all.
B002ZG97M4|5.0|I bought this as a Xmas gift for someone else.<br /><br />The one thing I can note about it is that even though it is Ultraviolet they actually include a code for an iTunes file download with this edition of the movie!  The person I bought it for was particularly happy with this aspect of it!
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Love the series. Gave it to my cousin. Keep selling the Downton Abbet series please. We all love it.  OK
B003TSEEDY|5.0|One of the best books I've ever read! I highly recommend this book to read, I know you will love it!
B005CKPQNE|5.0|Breaking Bad is the best series we have ever seen.  It always keeps you in suspense and you can't wait for the next week and the next episode!!
B005LAIIA8|2.0|Boring. That's what my family thought. Even our children thought it wasn't very good. Wish we had saved our money & just skipped it!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Good way to pass the time if you are waiting at the doctor's office or if you are bored and you need something to do!
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|We had gotten rid of our dish, so we were extremely pleased to find that we could purchase this series from Amazon!!  This series will leave you wanting more after every show!  Definitely for a mature audience!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Was very impressed with the level of anticipation that was maintained throughout all the books. I couldn't put it down<br />Characters were well developed and you could really get in their heads to understand the how's and whys of there thoughts and teasonings
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Hopeless was even better than Hoover's other two books, and I absolutely loved them!  I read Hopeless in a day and a half!  I literally could not stop reading. I cannot wait for Hoover's next book. She is by far my favorite author. I feel sad to see the stories end, and I will be recommending this one to my friends.
B003L77G10|5.0|Excellent psychology, great nonverbals and acting, fascinating plots and construction of episodes, clever, and accurate representation of working for a law firm, as near as I can tell.  Characters are fleshed out well, and believable.
1603427244|1.0|I could not follow the pictures or words very well at all. Since I am an experienced knitter, it must just be the way I read, right?
B0091REZMW|4.0|not as intitutative as I had hoped.  stressful with a timer always in the background ticking away.  music is interesting to say the least.
B0053O89YM|5.0|Excellent psychology, great nonverbals, script, and acting, fascinating plots and construction of episodes.  The trials change each episode, but character development, interpersonal interactions are simply the best I have ever seen.<br />It is an accurate representation of trial dynamics.  Characters are fleshed out well, and believable.  Buy it.<br />You will love it. Better yet, buy the whole series.
1603429999|5.0|Great techniques in here that every knitter must have under their belt. Very well written by a well known professional.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|This is my first Gillian Flynn novel. Her characters have so much psychological depth, I'm amazed! It's been a long while since I've read a book that caused me to have my jaw dropped in shock - repeatedly. If this becomes adapted into a film version, I'm in line front & center for tickets. I was initially interested in reading \\"Gone Girl\\" until reading reviews for \\"Sharp Objects,\\" I gravitated to this title first. No regrets!! Now on to reading \\"Gone Girl.\\" Well done Flynn!
B003FSTN52|5.0|Excellent psychology, great nonverbals and acting, fascinating plots and construction of episodes, clever, and accurate representation of working for a law firm, as near as I can tell.  Characters are fleshed out well, and believable.  Buy it.<br />You will love it too.
B00992CF6W|4.0|I loved the game but it is missing a lot of features from the xbox or computer version. I also thought it was a bit overpriced considering the lack of items and other important features. Still, it's a great game!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I loved it.  Not much more to say.  All 3 books are a great read, no matter your interests.  Friggin Awesome...
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I got this on my Kindle Fire for my 7 year old Brony because he just loves MLP. I ended up playing it more than him. We haven't had the need to buy any extra bits or gems, as we just keep up with the shops and things like that. Well... we had just made it to level 34. Had over 17 shops and about 12 ponies, and over 34,000 bits saved. And then the app stopped running :/ It goes to the Hasbro logo on the load screen, then automatically goes back to my Kindle home screen. No matter how many times I click on it, it just won't load passed that screen. It was fun up till that point though! I have un-installed, then will re-install and see if that helps.
0440241901|5.0|This was my first non-&#34;Shopaholic&#34; book and I loved this so much more!  Yes, the main character gets herself in ridiculous situations but none of them make her seem as selfish and self-centered as the shopaholic girl (I found myself finishing that series just so I'd know how it all ended, not because I actually cared about the girl). This book is awesome and I kept picturing the characters as though ti was a movie, since I know that it was considered as a possible movie (too bad the shopaholic movie did so poorly because I think this would have done much better!). Loved this one!
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|So far so good. I'm hopeful that this will be super fun. Graphics are beautiful and very smooth to use for me
0061692042|5.0|With the minutia of minute-by-minute cadences of detail in every sentence, this is a narrative from the mind's eye of a fifteen year old, thrown out of his comfort-zone of love and family, into an alien and epic emotional landscape.<br /><br />Set across the almost formless but most vividly painted landscape of small town north America, the novel commands with spotlessly economical prose, an almost apocryphal scale of emotion and perspective in its detail.<br /><br />It is a novel that brings into question everything that is considered `normal' and the precarious proximity of everything that is not. It challenges what are defined as boundaries in the most profound moral sense, and brings into sharp focus the borders between the unsaid and the spoken, being and becoming, forethought and deed and the growing up of an individual propelled by instinct to establish the space in which he can find happiness, or at least construct a feeling of that out of nothing and with no one.<br /><br />This is a book that reminds us so warmly why we read literature.  Richard Ford, is a genius.
0385342063|5.0|I read this from the library on my own, loved it and decided to get it for a friend for Christmas. I practically reread the last 1/4 of the book because I loved it so much, it's such a cute and fun book!  Sure it's an unlikely story but who cares? With all the chaos and unhappiness on our tvs why not escape into a fun book. I've read all of &#34;Sophie Kinsella's&#34; books and this is one of my favorites for sure (much more likable heroine than the shopaholic). Gotta read this if you haven't already.
B0012GMW34|5.0|Carlos Santana and John McLaughlin both shine brightly on this spectacular collaboration. If you love jazz-fusion guitar, this is a great album for you. One of my all time favorite jazz-fusion albums, \\"Love Devotion Surrender\\" will come close to actually knocking your socks off. With the addition of two bonus tracks, an already great album is even better. Enjoy!
B009K6DKTS|5.0|Taleb nails it this time: Antifragile is masterfully written conclusion to his previous two books, all reviewing the same subject from different perspectives. And now he actually gives useful advice on how to tame and utilize the random, complex nature of modern world.<br /><br />This is truly spectacular book, that every practitioner of science should read. It advocates using simple heuristics instead of complex, fragile theorems for application of science into people's lives. It also manages to remind us of old (ancient) concepts from scientific process and take them beyond their traditional domains, like iatrogenics, meaning measuring unintended and harmful side-effects of intervening scientific applications.<br /><br />However, although he gives explanation for it, some of the language is overly provocative and he might actually get his message through better with less offensive style. There are also quite a bit spelling errors so some editing would have been needed.
B003YGSLDA|5.0|The best Santa out of all Christmas movies. Tim Allen has nothing on this Santa. My wife and I must have watched 3 times and told my neighbor about it so they tool my movie and they loved it
B00006JK1R|5.0|Men in Black II - really a good movie.  I get tired of all the filth in movies - the whole family can enjoy this together.  Love Tommy Lee Jones.

B004WCTLNY|3.0|The Adjustment Bureau was a good movie.  It was mediocre.  Not the best, but okay.  Matt Damon was good in it..
B008JFUPOY|5.0|i love pixar/disney movies also me my friend really like monsters inc and monsters university they are awsome films thay are a 5 star shows to myself
B002MQYOFW|5.0|It was amazing and I don't want to stop reading this book ever. It is not good for small kids.
B004EPYZP8|5.0|I absolutely loved the movie Lincoln Lawyer.  Got it is a flash and always enjoy watching Mathew.  He does some good acting.
B0083Z614S|5.0|A wonderful, uplifting story with a beautiful ending. Brought tears of joy to my eyes and warmed my heart.  Always believe in magic.
007174889X|5.0|This well-known book is easier to carry being that it is broken down into 2 volumes now. The price for these books was very affordable.
0790731894|4.0|Executive Decision was a good movie.  Anything that Kurt Russell is in is good! Kurt as always a good actor and brings life to the screen.
1455527475|1.0|Much ado about nothing. Smith's book evidences his own failure and shortcomings rather than shed any meaningful light on the bank he proudly worked for. Apparently an underperforming employee, Greg Smith is not much of an author either.
B0002Y4TOM|5.0|Fast shipping.  Everyone will find something in here that rings true.  If your childhood was void of some important family relationships, you will get it here.  Great believable characters 93% of the time.  Very very good acting, especially from the grandparents.  Enjoy!
B008XG1X18|5.0|Pinterest is the best. I use it everyday. I love to cook and they have the best recipes I have ever seen. I made a soup that I get at Olive garden, and it tasted just like the one I get at olive garden. I would give Pinterest 1000 stars if i could!!
B000YHG72E|4.0|New Christmas Favorite.  The kids and adults really enjoyed they story.  I could see us watching every year for the holidays.
B000A59PMO|5.0|Fast shipping.  Lots of twists and turns.  Kristen Bell is great.  Great characters and very good acting.  Third season slows down but have to see it through.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|Very very good.  Definitely worth the time watching.  Homeland is by far the best written, best acted, best directed show on television.
B0084AXZK0|5.0|I could hardly put it down. I truly great read and a classic that has stood the test of time.
B001152TL6|5.0|This is not a movie to make-out by or tweet or email by.  When it ends you'll think you zoned out or got distracted while watching it.  Then you'll discover the little guide included with the cover.  And immediately you'll pick up on some things and know you have to see it again.  Bill Pullman's acting evolves right before your eyes.  Bravo again Mr. Lynch.<br />I feel fortunate to say I went to high school with David Lynch.  I'm not kissing up here.  Russ
B008518MOW|5.0|great movie! my son in law wanted this for christmas, will be back to get another for him<br />for his birthday,thanks

B007HO392S|5.0|This is a CD and it came as described.  This was a gift and the the reciepient enjoys the music and CD.
0920668364|1.0|In this story, the mom creeps into her grown son's room and takes him out of bed and holds him?  The &#34;I love you forever&#34; rhyme is cute, but how they go about saying it in the story is just weird.
B004FGMV0W|5.0|This was on my granddaughter's wish list.  She was very happy to get it for Christmas.  Easy for me, too.  No wondering whether she will like her gift or not!
B003UYV08E|5.0|This was bought to give as a gift.  The recipeient was glad to receive the gift.  I would buy again if needed.
B0073PPKNM|5.0|I love listening to Melody Gardot. This album is a little more upbeat than previous and a great change of pace. I love her style!
B002K0WBXW|5.0|My granddaughter loves movies and has quite a collection of them.  This was on her wish list, so I was certain she would love it and she did!
B0051UH6W4|3.0|I wanted to like this book because it has such good reviews but it was irritatingly repetitive and kept teasing you with the climax for the entire book so that when it occurred at the end I felt let down. I had to keep forcing myself to read it and had to keep skimming the repetitions so I didn't go crazy. I felt like the author had decided that all the clever language she had worked out was so amazing that she had to keep slapping you in the face with it and endlessly repeating it. Basically the characters were well developed, the story, sad but valuable and the setting was new and different to any I have read before.
074356619X|4.0|A wonderful guide to get through life. It actually works well when I least expect it. I go back and listen to it every few months to renew my ability to use The Secret.
B00A3AUGEW|5.0|I was so excited to purchase Phillip Phillips first album.  I was not disappointed..  Amazon is a great place to purchase music.
B0098VYCCE|4.0|Great special effects. Story was well written. All in all a good movie. My hubby even enjoyed even though he deemed it a chick flick. Once watching he realized it is more an action adventure. Good movie. Not a five but solid four.
B001NESPHC|5.0|This was the first cd I ever heard from Melody and I have several &#34;all time&#34; favorite songs on this cd. I am so glad that I was introduced to Melody through this cd. I fell in love with someone and with her music!
B0042MEQVG|5.0|All the Eclipse movies are great.  I just had to have my own set!  Now I can watch them anytime I want.
1451648537|3.0|Steve Jobs book is a good read for anyone that is interested in the building of Apple. Otherwise, it is a slow read for others.
B001DCZ4IW|5.0|This is a classic. The soundtrack is one of my favorites.the film tells a great story. I love Harold and maude
B009AMANBA|1.0|I love history but hated this movie.  Dull, plodding.  It amazes me that this movie got such good reviews.<br />Best actor? Are you kidding me.
B009CPJHY4|3.0|I did not think that this movie developed the characers enough but, as there are 8 main characeters, in fairness the movie would need to be longer to do so.
B004SBX112|5.0|Fun game and good level of difficulty. I also like that it is AD FREE, blah, blah, blah, & lol
1591396190|4.0|I've read this before and it's brilliant. It's a bit involved to understand, and even more difficult to apply to your own business, but it is worth the investment. I consult for businesses in NYC and guide them better with the teachings and tools of this book. It's accurate, timeless and profound.
0446580848|2.0|Great story but bad story telling. John is losing it! I swear, if I read the word \\"Right.\\" one more time as John is talking to himself, me or another character, I will blow my brains out. Seems like someone couldn't think of anything or ran out of light bulbs and replaced it with the one-word sentence: \\"Right.\\" Just one more time...ONE MORE DAMN TIME....Once you notice that \\"Right.\\" is said every other 2 paragraphs you'll go insane. At least I did.<br /><br />The over-explanations and analysis of the plot and who and what everything is makes me feel like im in the 7th grade for the 3rd time. Pick it up at your own risk and if you pick it up. Count how many times \\"Right.\\" appears in the book. You'll be blown away.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|cant wait for season 3. this series is brillently acted. reminds me of upstairs downstairs. downton abbey rules. the britsh know how to make a great series.
0307463745|4.0|For anyone that wants to adjust their life in the slightest, I recommend REWORK. It's more than just talk about work, it's about simple things anyone can do to manage their time, energy and stress. Each tip is an easy, page read from the brilliant minds of 37signals. At this point in my life, I prefer to interact more with people who have read and internalized the lessons of this book. This book can help you be happier with who you are and what you do, if you let it.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Great book just a bit confusing at first but proved to be its a good read. You get started and can't quit
1451627297|5.0|If you had the chance to change the course of history, would you?<br /><br />As usual, Stephen King has rocked my world. His ability to weave a tale and get into the minds and lives of his characters is second to none. When I first opened this book (or as it was, turned on my iPod), I was expecting a story about traveling back to stop an assassination. While that did happen, it turns out it was not the main story. True to King fashion, he took us on an incredible journey to get to the heart of the matter. There were many side stories, which turned out to all tie into the big story. It was an incredibly complex journey, but as a reader it was easy to follow along and enjoy the ride.<br /><br />Jake, the main character and narrator of the story, is an easily likable English teacher with a simple life who is drawn by chance into this crazy world of time travel. Back in \\"the land of ago,\\" he becomes George, another likable character but by circumstance has to be more hardhearted and indifferent to goings on than Jake.<br /><br />I really love how King intertwines his stories. If you have not read some of his other books you would not get the references, but you would not be feeling like you were missing anything; you would just think it another side story. But, they are there for us who know King. It is like being on the right side of an inside joke.<br /><br />I listened to the audio of 11/22/63. The narrator, Craig Wasson, did an excellent job of creating his characters and fleshing each of them out. Though not a terribly emotion-ridden book, he was able to add it in through his voice where needed. I would love to listen to more of his work.
B000SXMSJ0|3.0|I inadvertently ordered a download of a recording I already own on CD.<br />The quality of the download falls short in comparison.<br />The music and the talent of the artist are exceptional.<br />I do not recommend downloading from Amazon. I was really disappointed in the result.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I have played a lot of hidden objects games and this one is one of my favorites. Awesome graphics / story line!
B0010SEMP0|4.0|I have been hearing about Cat and Bones from practically everyone for practically forever. So when I finally decided to pick up the first book and read it...whoa! I realize now what everyone is talking about!<br /><br />The second book in the Night Huntress series was just as action packed, fun filled, and hot and steamy as the first. I was a bit worried at first having Cat without Bones, but I figured he would not be able to stay away for long - although four years! What was he thinking? That was definitely long enough. I love that Cat is kickass and does not take crap from anyone. She sees what needs to be done and goes for it. She does not question herself or second guess her decisions. Many times you have heroines hemming and hawing over their decisions for chapter after chapter - boring! Cat is a go-get-em type of girl. I love how Bones just takes charge of everything. He walks into a room and commands it. The tension and chemistry between her and Bones is awesome and adds that little (or a lot) extra oomph to the story. Interesting ending to this one. I am getting ready to start the next in the series to see what happens!
B008X9Z3UC|5.0|I purchased this Kindle Sleeve for my husband to use with hus new Kindle Fire. He really likes it alot and protects his Kindle from getting scratched or wet, etc. Its very sleek and sturdy design is perfect for his Kindle Fire.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|This is an excellent book. I downloaded it on my ipad to keep as a all time referrance book. The book has help me understand so many relationships with my spouse and my family. I also recommend The Five Love Languages for Children. I would have like to have this book when my children was young. Great book to have around all the time. Thank you Gary D Chapman for this informational referrance.
B004WSX60M|5.0|A GREAT product for the price. A REAL country artist ! Not the new crap where they stick a slide guitar into a pop tune and call it country.
B008ENNXQI|4.0|Fun for the family.  Visually stunning.  Six year old girl and her eight year old brother both enjoyed the film.  So did mom and dad.
B009JBZH54|5.0|Love these movies only problem is that I hate ULTRA VIOLET its better then no digital but otherwise great buy!!!!
B000002VMH|5.0|For my money this is Annie's most solid Album. She has other songs I like but no album I enjoy as much as this one.
B00APUYWYA|4.0|I expected a silly movie and was pleasantly surprised at how enjoyable this movie was. Even my husband joined and watched, thoroughly enjoying. Anna Kendrick was great - she's a good actress, great singer, and she has the ability to make you laugh which is great for a lead role. Rebel Wilson was great too, very funny and charismatic.<br /><br />The music was good fun, which I found a little surprising considering I'm not a huge fan of pop music. I'd recommend this to anyone who likes light-hearted comedies. I found it to be very enjoyable!
B00A8ECU24|5.0|This is a cute, fun, functional game for Bronies and Pegasisters alike! Thank you!!! I love this game, even though I am 15! My little brother loves it too!
1455502758|3.0|I have long been a fan of Christopher Hitchens, so I was very ready to like this book about his last days. However, it is &#34;slim pickins,&#34; as someone once said--sad descriptions, of course, about cancer treatments, and descriptions of more than one instance of the man's great courage.<br /><br />Perhaps wrongly, I was hoping to be inspired, but I was not. I felt cheated. You will finish the book in no time, sadly.
B004TTMYQG|3.0|UPDATE (Feb 25, 2013): Requirement for Internet connection left me high and dry for the second time. Software just stops working with a demand to be connected. I've stopped using the software because of this one issue. However, if you're never away from the Internet for more than a day or two, this won't be a problem.<br /><br />-----------Original Review---------------<br />I've been using the paid version of this application on a Samsung Galaxy Tab 7 (Android 2.2) for about 6 months. Overall this seems to be a so-so application.<br /><br />PLUS<br />1) There's excellent font size control, allowing for tiny fonts (almost illegible the characters are so small) to a large size that would be equivalent to 14 points if the screen were paper. Smallest setting is \\"50%\\" and largest is \\"200%\\" -- the 70% setting, which I prefer, allows about 15 characters per line to display in the month view.<br /><br />2) The screen layouts are clean and easy to read. (My preference is for \\"lean and mean\\" -- those who like skins and fancy effects will be disappointed.)<br /><br />3) There is a large selection of nice widgets for the home page, both agenda views and calendar views.<br /><br />4) Recurring events are easy to set up with a good selection of patterns. Individual events in the pattern can be edited.<br /><br />MINUS<br />1) The settings and menus are non-intuitive. For example, the month-view setting \\"Tap on popup shows\\" has two options: Day View and Multi-Day View. However, the \\"Day View\\" option is like an agenda view (time of event, but no time grid). The \\"Multi-Day View\\" has to be adjusted (via the slider bar) to become a single-day view. (Once adjusted, it's OK.)<br /><br />2) Swiping is likewise non-intuitive. For example, in the month view, one must swipe up-down to change the date. However, in the day view, one must swipe left-right to change the date. Swipes often do not yield my desired result, but do something else instead.<br /><br />3) In the month view, swiping left-right sometimes shifts the calendar to \\"multi-day\\" view. I have not yet figured out when and why this happens -- perhaps I am swiping at different speeds.<br /><br />4) After about a week without accessing the Internet, the application stopped working -- it demanded an internet connection to continue. (I am using a local calendar.)<br /><br />5) Copying an event is tortuous. There is a way to do it, but I always end up re-entering the data.<br /><br />OVERALL<br />Except for the Internet connection demand (which if it repeats will cause me to abandon the calendar completely), this is a so-so application. Their \\"claim to fame\\" seems to be the variable-number-of-days view, which some might find helpful. My main objection to it is that the same swipe/tap/slide motion often causes different effects. So I stay with the month view to avoid that frustration. The home page widget is nice. (Without the widgets I would give this application only 2 stars.)
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|By far the best book I have read in my life! Her descriptive words captivated me from begging to end!!<br />This is worth the money, I don't want to spoil but I literally teared up but was intoxicated with the love story of \\"HopeLess\\"
B006LSZECO|4.0|IT was hard to get into this book at first, but after the first 5 chapters, it was enthralling. a good buy
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Love, love, LOVE this book. The author knows how to keep you intrigue frome chapter to chapter. Had a little to much sex in. it for me but that didn't stop me from picking it back up each & every time.
0452295548|5.0|Very insightful for stroke victims and their caregivers to understand what really occurs. The type of stroke was similar to our relative's.
B001BZRUR4|5.0|Breezed right through it. This does not fall into the genre of fiction that I would normally read but it was recommended to me and I liked it enough to try another Zusak.
B0027MJU00|4.0|Interesting read- a wild finish as advertised. Wish she hadn't dropped the Kill Club so abruptly, since they'd been the engine propelling the plot.

B000XUBFE2|3.0|My wife loved it. It took a little time for me to get involved with the story. Very interesting delivery.
B0015DWLD0|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. It showed me a different side of modern India, in an entertaining way. The story twists and turns and keeps you in suspense until the end.

B006T3RM08|1.0|I bought this product directly from their site. My BRAND NEW wireless apple keyboard does not fit. The dock is too small. Scratches all over the side of my keyboard trying to get it to FIT. Considering I wanted this for a trip which I'm leaving NOW for I am extremely pissed. They have no number to call, so I sent an email. I will update this review when I get a response.

B000000H6Y|5.0|I absolutely love Type o and when i saw this for under $3 i had to purchase it and with my birthday coming up on the 20th i figured Happy Birthday to myself. I ordered it on new years eve and received it 5 days later on none other than Peter Steele's birthday. Love and Miss you Peter. forever in my heart you remain.
B005CRQ2DK|5.0|This is such a great book! It's my favorite diary of a wimpy kid book. You should totally buy it.
146500632X|5.0|Ordered this for my daughters and they absolutely LOVE it!  It came exactly as described.  We are very happy with it.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I was lucky enough to stumble onto WOOL after all 5 parts were out and this story is just incredible!  It really builds such a real world to live in- with real people and surroundings- that it was kind of disorienting to finish the book and get back to my regular life!! The characters stay with you,  the plot stays with you in your thoughts long after you put the book down.  I love love loved it!!
B007TNS6JI|5.0|I am amazed at how an app like this is available for a kindle fire. I have fun playing it.

1574214276|5.0|This book is perfect. I just love it .All of the diagrams are very easy to follow. It combines all of the other books in one .
B0074D3CAQ|4.0|Harold Fry's 500-mile journey on foot is also a journey backward in time as he remembers his childhood, his marriage, his relationship with his son.  I personally found myself evaluating my own memories and relationships as I walked with Harold.  It is a memorable book, for someone who likes psychological dramas.
B0086700CM|5.0|addicted to it! !! The monkey are hilarious I love them I love being able to fell the anticapation it is really entrancing! !!
B004DM0UII|1.0|This thing plays internet radio stations, not real radio stations. They should say that up front. No use to me, glad it was free.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This is one of those rare books with depth, great writing, and a compelling thriller narrative all bundled into a single package. Not since reading Raymond Chandler- and I am measuring my words -have I come across such a smart, compelling read. I'm hooked on Gillian Flynn.
B00005OOQ5|5.0|I LOVE THE EXPERTISE OF EACH MEMBER OF THE TROUPE!!! I WOULD RECOMMEND ANY CIRQUE DU SOLEIL TO ANYONE WHO LOVES GREAT ENTERTAINMENT!!!!!!!
B003WUYRGI|1.0|I hate it was boring and the title is even boring gash so git me an new book or else

B005CRQ4GU|5.0|It was a good book I am looking forward to reading the rest of the series yup u are a good rider
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book struck my spirit and my way of life. If you do choose to read this book be very cautious of what you have ever dreamed or though all your life. Honestly I can not tell you how this book means to me because I really don't know what I am feeling right now. You just have to read it. Trust me.

B0082SU98U|5.0|Pollyanna was and is a great book and teaches a very valuable lesson. The  main lesson is someone might have it worse than you an  you should be glad you're not them.
1609611543|5.0|very informational and convincing. I have been off wheat for 30 days and I feel like a new person. I lost 5 pounds in the first week. I lent out my book before I could try the recipes so I am looking forward to getting it back.
B00AEFVRB2|1.0|If you like to be shocked, this is the movie for you. I rented this because it showed up on some &#34;Ten Best&#34; lists. Django Unchanged is shocking and original, but it also has humor and a message. This is just a tale of gross and disgusting people with gross and disgusting images. I did like the way that Matthew McConaughey's blue eyes were highlighted by his dark blue cowboy hat and dark blue shirt.<br /><br />I live in Texas, but I guess it's a different Texas from what is shown here. I found it unwatchable.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Pinterest is so much fun and this app makes it super easy to navigate. The only problem I have is that it wont let me add anything to my &#34;secret&#34; boards but I can see them from the app.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Initially reluctant to read any  books in the series.  But I quickly found myself interested and engaged in its unsettling plot.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|Writing and directing..Joss puts these character through their paces, with style.<br /><br />A short story writer must use every word towards the purpose of telling the story. Screenwriters and directors must do the same. In Joss's position - in both chairs - and with a &#34;crack staff&#34; of actors, this story is well told. The action is knitted with character's quirks and even things i remember from the comics. (&#34;Puny God&#34;)<br /><br />This is a well earned 5 stars.
B007ONSLLQ|5.0|One of my favorite bands. Have seen them live several times and they never disappoint! Music totally gets me pumped up!
B00AB0AXU6|3.0|I honestly think they should start timing the action vs. the dialogue in these movies of MIlla's. She does act well, if give half a chance.<br />This movie was more about putting another RE labeled movie out there than having the Alice character grow...<br /><br />But then again... the Alice character was never one of those &#34;huggable&#34; types... more like a butt kicker.
B001HN694K|5.0|Made an excellent choice for a co-worker! We have many laughs comparing our daily lives to the infamous rabbit hole :)
B000067FP8|1.0|I've been getting dvd's of movies my kids liked so my grandchildren can see them.  I got gremlins and gremlins 2 and let my 6 year old grandson watch the first gremlin movie and my daughter was telling me that I shouldn't have because the gremlin movie gave her nightmares.  I then got gremlins 2 in the mail and decided I better watch it and realized that gremlins 2 was likely what gave her nightmares, this is not for small children!
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|I'm only halfway through this game and I'm enjoying it very much. And if you get stuck, the developer is keen to respond via their Facebook wall. I'll be looking out for their stuff in the future.
B009329ZF2|4.0|I had not read any reviews, I just kept seeing it the stores so I decided to try it.  Battleship was quite different from what I expected.  I thought it would be like a WW2 war movie --- how wrong I was!  It is about alien invaders and fighting the invaders with an assortment of Navy ships, including a battleship.  Of course there is a romance in the movie but it does not dominate and does not ruin the movie like they have in the past (Titanic, Pearl Harbor, etc.)
B004DM0UII|4.0|Well worth the download as free app of the day, but I don't think I would pay $3.99 for it as TuneIn Radio Pro does more for 99&cent;. It's powered by Shoutcast which has a good selection of Internet radio, but no streams from &quot;real&quot; radio stations.
B004LWZW6U|1.0|I bought this to use on my new 3D tv --- the 3D effects were good.  However, the story line leaves a lot to be desired.  I would not recommend this movie it is a poor sequel to Piranha.
B00AMBK6J2|2.0|Some funny parts but they are few and far between and I found the characters to be basically unlikeable.  I find little interesting in slacker, stoner, stupid, ignorant, lazy, characters.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|Love this movie. The blue ray is awesome! Definitely watch this if you haven't already. It's action packed and a lot of fun to watch, too!
030758836X|2.0|I am so very disappointed in this book.  It started very slow and almost quit reading it, then it got much better and kept you going until the last few sections in which it was very obivious she had no ending.  The ending was awful, like I just spent all that time reading for nothing!!!!<br />Also the book could have been a good mystery without all the vile language.  I'm no prude but she did get carried away, especially with female anatomy.<br />Will not be buying her books again.
B0036BK6MW|5.0|Daughter received this for Christmas. Great movie and the quality of the DVD is excellent. Highly recommend this movie to anyone :-)
B003NFM3JK|4.0|Ordered this right before Christmas and didn't think it would arrive in time for Christmas but to my surprise it did and made a great stoking stuffer.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|It's not often I get emotional about a book, but this one was so damn heart-wrenching, I think it would be impossible not to. I can't even put into words how this book touched me. It's my first book read in 2013, and it's going to be a tough one to beat. I'd recommend this book to anyone!
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I love mahjong games.  This one is fun.  Now if I can just figure out how to turn off the sound.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|THIS WAS A REALLY GOOD STORY, I had a very hard time putting it down.  I would recommend every one to read it.  It's amazing how much peer pressure there is among our young people, even though this is a fictional novel.
0446556750|4.0|This was not as good as some of the &#34;Lincoln Lawyer&#34; books but is was good. I enjoy the Harry Bosch Series as well. Not always an easy read but it always works out well in the end.
B000C20VRS|5.0|THIS IS A CLASSIC  MOB MOVIE, KIND OF BRUTAL BUT ENTERTAINING<br />NOT FOR  YOU IF YOU HAVE PROBLEM WITH THE VIOLENT SCENES,<br />THEY ARE PLENTY OF THOSE.
0316069434|4.0|Typical Connelly...There were a couple of slow spots and I won't say more than that - don't want to ruin it for others. Overall a great read. We need more!
B00006J3WH|4.0|For those that enjoyed Buffy the Vampire Slayer television series, this release of the music from the musical episode is a jewel.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This application for the daily reading of God's Word is simply the best and user friendly I have found!  It gives you access to over 14 versions of the Bible.....giving you better understanding of the Scriptures.  It will even read it to you aloud!  Definitely a must app for every Christian and student of the Bible.....
B000W7JWUA|5.0|This item arrived very quickly and was just as described. We've been having so much fun teaching family and friends to play this game, and it works well with our Traders and Barbarians expansion pack.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so good and so adicting. you should totaly get it. you will not be sory. and it is free so bonus.
B0099G6Q5E|5.0|I really love the movie so of course I love the soundtrack. I only wish that the songs were longer since most are under two minutes but otherwise it is a fun soundtrack to listen to.
B005EHQGTS|5.0|quick to install and configure. Great response and refresh rate and easily discoverable connections. would recommend this to anyone needing quick access to regular operating systems.
B000ZMCVRI|5.0|How can you not love it?  How can you not love it?  How can you not love it?  How can you not love it? Perfect.
B00407PNY2|5.0|Everyone should have this movie in their collection. The car chase scene is memorable and Steve mcQueen is in the methodology of great actors.
0062215507|5.0|this one really touchs on detail s that other books just miss.  Pictures are awsome. I purchashed another similr book but this one is much much better glad i got it.
B00AQ3K8IU|2.0|I'm sorry it's listed under my husband's name since he bought my Kindle for me.  I don't quite know how I feel about this book.  It had it's up's and down's but mostly down's.  It's not one I would read again the more I think about it - I don't like it.  Holder is great, don't get me wrong...so is Sky but ugh, I can't figure out what pisses me off more about this book.
B0008ENIAC|5.0|This is why she was Mommy Dearest in later years LOL.  True Joan style and a classic.  I hear that a remake was done but this is the one you should have.
B009HQ9UHC|4.0|Bad Piggies Free HD has lots of levels and fun in every section.  &hellip; And it's free! Instead of buying it for $2.99, and it's also HD!!! How lucky are you! It's really fun, but it may be challenging for children under 7. I recommend this app, being a angry birds fan myself, and you should get this awesome, free app, made by angry birds creators!!! :)
B003P9VZ0W|5.0|I was looking for something to add some character to my daughters room with the flower theme she already has and this is perfect to coordinate with her current theme.  My daughter loves it.
B006LS7DQE|5.0|Fun game to play. New and interesting combat style for an RPG dungeon crawler with leveling system.  Very fun at least 20+ hours gameplay for a cheap game.
B0000VCZKM|4.0|Will the sun come out tomorrow? Is it only a day away? Well, Annie says yes in the most delightful way. A story of hardship, challenges and a desire to find a family of one's own all set to music. Annie is nothing short of a classic, and this film provides a highly charming Annie whose adventures are fun to follow. Perhaps in part because its musical aspect makes some scenes less heartbreaking. Besides, there is nothing more cute than someone sporting a ginger fro while running away from people who pretend to be her parents, so they can swindle an adoptive father out of some big bucks.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|People actually deal with this type of situations everyday. If have every been a victim to something let this please tell someone, your not alone. Great book
B0086700CM|4.0|Grandkids love it!  They want me to write at least 17 words to submit the review but I gave an accurate evaluation in the first three lines of these comments
B00ARAO1LC|1.0|Even McConaughey's excellent acting skills can't save this train wreck.  Dottie, the mentally-challenged sister role, is the only person who earned their money in this box-office flop. Poor acting, poor writing, decent plot. Save your money, there are way too many movies out right now that are far better.
B008QTV3X0|5.0|Homeland is not 24 but it is full of nice plot twists and entertaining acting.  It is a show that will keep you coming back for more.
B00AA7O22U|3.0|I have to admit, I am concerned with how the youth of our country are affected by the violence and easy killing in games and movies these days. I think we have dehumanized media in general and I do not know what can be done to fix the issues.<br />  That said, The Expendables 1 and 2 are major fun for those whom are able to keep the separation of reality and fantasy straight! The campy references to each others previous movie monikers brings a chuckle to the mayhem from time to time. It is exciting to see these action stars all working together and seemingly having fun doing so. The realism of most of the action scenes never enters the realm of plausability. Therefore, this movie becomes total entertainment!
B009GEEMLY|4.0|This movie was far better then my expectations. Iron man Thor and the Hulk running around together jacking stuff was really good.
B002WV5A9G|5.0|I can watch this movie over and over.  I'm not a trekkie but I did watch some as a kid.  Very funny.
B002ZB26AO|5.0|Would recommend this book to everyone.  Great insight into North Korea and the horrible years of suffering these poor people have been made to suffer.
B0094LTWDM|4.0|Practically every movie Nora Ephron has done is wonderful. She seems to be able to capture a true feeling of reality. This film parallels the lives of two people in such a seamlessly cleaver way that it is a joy to watch. It is an homage to the brilliant and innovative Julia Child (a hero to all serious home cooks) through the eyes of a modern young woman. A charming and uplifting movie, One of my all-time favorites. If you like to cook, admire Julia Child, or just want a good story, you will like this movie.
B001C08RHA|4.0|This film, apparently thanks to Downey, takes itself just seriously enough.<br /><br />Stark's conversion from being a rather thoughtless genius-billionaire weapons manufacturer to someone who wants to stop the psychopaths who make war on the innocent is the best part of the film (imo).<br /><br />But on a different axis the chemistry between Stark and Pepper, and the action humor is *also* the best part.  Threatening his robot assistants, being bounced off the walls during testing, being targeted by USAF fighters, and what seems to be a tiny homage to the nominally-second Star Wars film produce a fair number of giggles.<br /><br />Unintentionally humorous I'm sure is that, despite the foreign locale nominally being Afghanistan, most of the Bad Guys with speaking parts appear to be speaking Arabic, not Pushto.  I expect that's why the script \\"explains\\" that the Bad Guys are really an international, multi-lingual criminal gang:  they didn't want Pushto-speakers convulsing in the aisles from laughter.<br /><br />I've watched it several times already; it's a film that doesn't wear out its welcome.
B00464CU7M|4.0|I expected the quality of a Sarah Brighten production, but not quite.  Still well worth the purchase.  She certainly has the voice of one in a million.
B0051BVQFG|2.0|First part put together as a pseudo-documentary, last part as action film.<br /><br />Not much plot, cheesy dialog, expensive-looking special effects, and 100% unknown-to-me actors.  Anything that doesn't involve shooting things or blowing things up reveals the cliched shallowness of this film.<br /><br />If you can bear watching a rather shallow, wooden, cliché-ridden animated recruiting poster aimed at teenage males, go for it.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|I didn't expect to get so wrapped up in a series of books so rapidly!! I can hardly wait for the third book to come out...I already have it pre-purchased!! You feel the dynamics between both of them jump off the pages while reading. Hot, hot, hot!! Fifty Shades fans...give these books a whirl!!
B000PC6Z48|4.0|Worth watching, not of the caliber of the Sergio Leone films, but well worth watching.  Good story and plenty of action.
B008FRFN7A|5.0|I am very happy with this printer. It was reasonably priced and has totally changed ow I print.....for the better.  Wish I had purchased sooner!
B0085RQLXK|3.0|Doesn't rank up there with &#34;Toys In The Attic&#34;, &#34;Rocks&#34;, &#34;Get Your Wings&#34;, &#34;Pump&#34; or &#34;Permanent Vacation&#34; but well worth a listen.
B000XUOIQ4|5.0|Great movie!  Have love it since it first came out!  Had it in my library, and a friend barrowed it, for his daughter.  This was a replacement, for my first one.
B0000AUHPG|5.0|\\"Once Upon A Time...\\" is the ultimate western (spaghetti) in my opinion, Sergio Leone out did himself with this one.  The story line, the characters and the soundtrack are all awesome.  The music may be the most fitting.  Bronson, Robards & Fonda play their parts Xcellently!!  It's one of those movies I watch every tyme it comes on...ranks up there with \\"Tombstone\\", \\"Pulp Fiction\\", \\"Lonesome Dove\\", \\"The Godfather...I & II\\" and \\"Goodfellows\\".  Very enjoyable.
B0050XFY4O|5.0|I am absolutely in love with this move.  And perhaps I'm in love with the brothers too!  It is the sweetest love story I have seen in a long time, although quite an unconventional one.  Love is love!
B009YP9L7U|5.0|keep me interested, i was thrilled to read a free book that was exciting and interesting. i would recommend reading it.
B00A7ZWUJC|5.0|i think she deliver.... a pretty solid album. highs and lows of love and of course some nice dance cutes.
B0015GDVTU|5.0|i bought this for a friend and still dont regret it. we watch it every time it is such a great film
B004GJDQT8|5.0|Installed on y new iPad. No problems. I use Amazon on several purchaser month. I would recommend everyone install this one
B007712XAU|5.0|Was what I wanted and expected.  Loved it.<br /><br />Plan on ordering the 3 and 4 season after they have aired.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|If you liked the Mistborn series you would love this book. I was totally captivated with the whole book. You will not be disappointed!
B002Q1YDLI|4.0|This book is well-written, and I enjoyed the closure to the story begun in Something Borrowed. While it's not a classic it's a great book to curl up with and pass the time.
B007IXWKUK|1.0|Bad story and even worse &#34;writing&#34;, and I use the term loosely.  A waste of time and money. Here is a summary after their initial meeting: they argue, have sex, argue again, he buys her an extravagant gift, a crisis occurs and this cycle repeats over and over again. My advice is not to waste your time reading these books.
B000HAB4KS|5.0|The online order and instant movie watch is greate. It's 10+ years since the first time we saw the movie. Love the movie to see it 2nd time with family together. Kindle movie is usually $1 better less price than iTune/IPad.
B007IXWL2C|1.0|Repetitive phrases,  repetitive arguments, repetitive crises, repetitive strange intimate situations, and bizarre.  I wish I could have my money and time refunded! If you are still<br />intrigued by these books, please get them on loan from your library.  Save your money for something noteworthy.
6304293321|5.0|I bought this movie for my mom who was touched by it many years ago. It brings a tear to her eye every time she watches it.
B009JBWOU0|5.0|My son wanted these and is thrilled with this set. It comes with a book that includes pictures of the 3 movies. Good buy, delivered on time and intact.
B008AK8FHM|1.0|I am more then half way through this book.His description in no way describes the Bible description of heaven. It is great that a neurosurgeon has written about his experience. However, I believe his experience is that of a non believer, which he accurately calls himself right from the start. He is deceived by this statement... \\"you are loved you can do no wrong\\". Furthermore, there is no Jesus in his story thus far, who paid the Souls blood sacrifice to bring us to this status of, 'loved and given entrance into heaven' by the sacrificial blood spilled,to make us holy so that we might enter Holy ground! This was required all through out the Old testament, for entrance into a Holy heaven with a God who is  perfect, and cannot dwell with imperfection! Read '23 MINUTES IN HELL',(or view on youtube) &  EVIDENCE THAT DEMANDS A VERDICT. People make fun of the \\"Christian Right\\", why? Because Satan wants all the people he can take to Hell, via deception, to go with him! We all have to pick which side we will be on. Satan will do anything to deceive every Soul he can. This poor man hasn't found Jesus, The WAY, the TRUTH,& the LIGHT, as far as I have read. Thus I hate the book only for the satanic deception of it. It is true experience I believe,... but it is also contains the greatest deception.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book grabs you immediately!  I read it in less than 24 hours because I just couldn't put it down. One of those you find yourself laughing, crying & yelling the entire way through. Absolutely amazing!
B004SRNH10|3.0|Honestly I have no Idea what this is, I only had to download for a game that I wanted to try, not even sure the game is still installed on my tablet
B007PKDW44|4.0|good album/not great its like they tried to hard to make it a commercial success. some of it rocks pretty good but not all of it and you will recognize the songs that got air play but the rest are just OK.
0399160450|5.0|Clancy continues to move characters and topics along to fit the current and future conditions of the world. It hits on all cylinders of events and potential conflicts that can occur.
B008FQ1O1K|4.0|enjoyed the book, would not be his book in my opinion, have most of this author's books, very easy reading
B00AA7O22U|5.0|Action packed but I love all the &#34;old&#34; guys as I call them, sense of humor, for anyone who loves action movies, they won't be disappointed with this one, should see both though the first one and this one.
B004ZQ74G8|5.0|Really loved this book. It was so different, I didn't expect it to be like it was. 5 year old Jack was so sweet and imaginative, and I really wanted old Nick to be caught. I've never read any other book quite like it. Excellent read.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|- I really enjoyed the storya.  It was a great story and it kept me interested and it was hard to turn off the Kindle to go to bed.
1451695187|5.0|Excellent story of the doctor's journey from not believing to absolute certainty. This is another story that compliments the Allison Dubois books.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I was afraid to finish this book because I had read about so many disappointed readers. I am really glad I got through it. I loved it and I think the ending is fitting after the horrors the characters live through. I also like the way Collins portrays the authorities of district 13 as being almost if not, just as bad as the Capitol government, just that they are trying to establish themselves as the authority, but in the end are playing with their people, and children, just as easily. This is not a fairy tale, it is not a happily ever after ending. It is a book to make us think closely about how horrible wars can really be, and to ask ourselves \\"Where do we stop\\"?, where do we draw the line with revenge? With the differences between Peeta and Gale's reactions to the wars, it also shows how these situations change and mark everyone in different ways. Excellent, excellent, excellent. Thank you Suzanne Collins for creating these stories that entertain but at the same time provoke important thoughts for teenagers and adults alike.
0345803485|1.0|I don't think I can add much more that hasn't already been said for this horrible book. Just doing my little part for humanity by trying to bring the overall rating down as much as possible. Here are some things I found particularly annoying...<br />1.)The repetition is over the top. The author actually uses the word \\"besieged\\" in consecutive sentences.  Not to mention the blushing, flushing, the terms \\"holy crap\\", \\"oh my\\", and more.<br />2.)The heroine refers to her genitals as \\"down there\\" and then later calls them \\"my sex\\", which is even more disgusting.<br />3.)What girl wears the same dress on 10 different occasions when she first starts dating a guy?<br />4.)The tampon scene was just too much, and not in the least bit sexy.<br />5.)She just graduated from college and doesn't have a computer, cell phone, or even an email address?<br />6.)Her name is Anastasia.<br />I could go on and on...don't get sucked into this \\"double crap\\".  I honestly think the only people who like these books are people that have never actually read a book before. I've read better sex scenes in James Patterson books. Also, if you think it might get better in the second book, don't do it. I'm speaking from experience.
0790734850|4.0|My husband loves it and watches it all the time.  Not my kind of film at all, but he thinks it's great.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Loved this book! I liked it better then the first one, these books are similar to the fifty shades trilogy if that's what u are looking for
B0008KLVG4|4.0|For my husband to replace the one we have on VHS and he loves it.  I've seen it so any times, I'm not interested.
0345803507|1.0|horrible book...threw it into the trash where it belongs...this author is ignorant, and repeats her sentences over and over and its the 3rd in her series...the entire story could have been written in one book...except she kept re writing over and over all the ridiculous sex stuff over and over....its all about making money.....do not waste your money...
B001VB8UAE|5.0|I bought it for one concert that I had on VHS and wanted it on DVD and got another concert with it that is even better than the one I originally wanted.  I'd recommend it to all Streisand fans.
0671646788|5.0|Always be learning, add this book to your collection.  You will be thankful you purchased and listen/read this book.  Dont be afried to read it or listen to it more then once.  Every time you hear it you learn something new, something you didnt read/hear the first time.
B0032FPVKE|2.0|It doesn't even fit my p&s camera. Pretty disappointed. Its way too small. The way it was described for large cameras is  incorrect. It woudnt even fit medium sized p&s cameras

B005CRQ3NY|4.0|9 year old daughter liked this book. she read it pretty quickly. she said she gives it four stars. good
B00005N6KG|5.0|These headphones have really good sound for their size. I prefer these to ear bubs, they are more comfortable, they stay on my head, and they don't hurt my ears like ear buds do.
0525953728|3.0|NO EASY DAY is a compelling Story and there is no doubt that Mark Owen is a true Military Hero.<br />I just think Mark and the Book would have been better served if he had relied more on a Ghost Writer to help with the Narrative.<br />The writing is somewhat Simplistic and Amateaurish.<br />I am also curious as to why Mark decided to spill the beans on his Covert Operations.<br />I thought Seals took an oath of Secrecy.
B008J05EL8|3.0|You get some good fonts with this app, it is good for everyday use and special occasions I highly recommend this app.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|As much as I hated to see,the end of the trilogy  it was so well done.  Especially enjoyed the retelling of the beginning from the different view.  I stretched out the last chapters trying to make it last longer but couldn't put it down for long.<br /><br />Thank you E L James, please write more!  Will recommend for story line, info on so many subjects and levels.  WOW
B006SMLAMQ|2.0|Too complicated on Kindle devices. I do not recommend this app on any kindle device. Works better on Google nexus

B0049J3QF4|5.0|We rented this instant video and now need to buy it. My toddler absolutely loved it. He watched it for the 12th time last night, and I finally saw the whole thing from start to finish. It is a great movie, my husband even thinks so and he hates children's movies.
B006P0WMBO|5.0|I love super collapse. It's a lot like Super collapse 3 I have the pc game it' a little had to see on a smart phone

B009NOVCU6|5.0|Any and all stone fans.this is a must to have.there is no bout a doudt it.it is a greatest hits box set,and will be a collectors item....
B0076DELIG|4.0|The scope is more situational rather than one with a universal truth as some of his other books, but it's a great read.
1907590331|5.0|Never required to read this book in school.  Now, in my mid 50's have finally read it.  It is superb.  Great character studies.  A short book, but one I will never forget.  Makes me hungry for more Steinbeck.  Is densely packed with incredibly colorful descriptions, yet still leaves room for one's imagination to fill in some details. Probably can appreciate more now than would have in high school.  Steinbeck was a genius.
B00005LMBK|5.0|really good album, my favorite by the gorillaz, love all the songs<br />definitely worth purchasing if youre a fan or just started listening to them
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Downtown Abbey<br />Outstanding series.This was a gift to my daughter and we are both looking forward to season 3.<br /><br />E are both attending a high tea today where season 3 will be previewed
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I really liked this book and I look forward to the next ones can't wait for the house of Hades.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This book is great for someone who doesn't have much time to read. You could finish it in about a week if you're like me! It was really funny and it will get you laughing as soon as you open it. It might have some awkward stuff for older guys like me (10) but it's good
B002QE3CTY|5.0|I loved this book.  It really gets you hooked to it.  I would recommend this book to anyone who likes adventure and mystery at the same time.  It is  really good book!!!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I absolutely loved this book. Once I started reading it I didn't want to stop. Highly recommended. I loved it
B005COO1X6|2.0|Reminds me of my imagination as a kid.  Every kid wants to be a hero. Nice short read and is typical king and cars.
B008Y2FRFO|2.0|it was fun at first but then it started to send me ads and mail about buying a credit card
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I LOVED this book, from the beginning to the end LOVED! Women could only hope to have a guy like Holder.
B0002VFXFE|5.0|Arctic Silver 5 Polysynthetic Silver Thermal Compound Paste 3.5g is a great product.<br />It's nice to do a business with.
0756686970|5.0|My almost 5 yr old son uses it to &#34;look up&#34; some parts that he has. Helps with the imagination. My 9 yr old daughter loves it too. Read about all the intricacies of each character. One character per page (with added information on their star cruiser or planet origination) with over 200 pages. Very nice!
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|the book was good and sad in a way prim dies .. i couldn't imagine going through the things ..
B0070Y46UY|5.0|It was amazing!! I loved the detail! I also loved the plot!!! I enjoyed the travel on the water! Fantastic!!
B004H4XDBI|5.0|I got so into it, I cried! It was so bittersweet and it really made me want more than just this last book.
0062127241|4.0|Since the Who was one of my favorite bands, I'll admit a certain positive bias before even starting this book. But it didn't disappoint. I really enjoyed &#34;getting into his head.&#34; The voice sounds  honest and  authentic. Pete was often a troubled and conflicted man, and it shows here.  Will non Who fans enjoy this book as much? Who knows? But I don't think it was written for them, and there certainly are millions who would enjoy this book.
B00AKEMHCA|4.0|This game is really fun. The only problem is that there is no sandbox. I want to explore strategies beforehand. That is the only reason I am rating this<br />Game four stars. It took me an hour to write this review because of.autocorrect.
B001KQZ7I8|5.0|Attempting to understand how anyone could endure the holocaust without giving up hope is of itself almost unfathomable.  Yet Frankl, through his own direct experience, shows us how to find meaning through assisting others, thereby creating the purpose to continue on despite the suffering.<br /><br />In the second part of the book, Frankl then goes on to demonstrate how Logotherapy can be used in so many of the situations we inevitably encounter in our lives; from terminally ill relatives through to a reason to get out of bed each day and make a difference to the people around us.<br /><br />This book will put your own life into perspective, and will make you see the world in a vastly different way.  Well worth reading.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|This was an awesome book! I would highly recommend it and I will definitely be reading more from this author!
B000N2HBSO|5.0|Very intimate view of the President in action with his cabinet.  Hard to imagine how Ms. Goodwin found all the correspondence and conversation details.  I had the feeling I was in the White House with Old Abe.  It's also clear that the author loved this President as she made the case over and over (perhaps to a fault) why he was one of the greatest.
B005LLX582|5.0|I'm sure this has been reviewed to death, so I'll just say put me in the 5-star column.  There is a way of nature and a way of grace, represented by the different personalities of two parents, raising three boys in 1950s Texas.  But it's about so much more than that.  It has everything - God even makes a cameo.  Sad and joyful, inspirational and terrifying.  Play it loud, because a lot of the narration is whispered.
B001XCWPAM|5.0|My husband is a HUGE fan of this trilogy. I bought it for him for Christmas and he was extremely excited. The bonus features are amazing.
B004LAIU4I|5.0|Paul Simon always wonderful, coming around with some new older style music is how it feels.  Will recommend to friends.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|This book was the best of the trilogy. Unfortunately, there won't be another. I will miss living in the unpredictable life of Lisbeth. She is by far the strongest female character I have ever read about.
0307352145|5.0|In our society we seem to look at those who are introspective and quiet as defective.  this book sets new ideas towards that philisophy.<br />being an introvert- by this book's standards- gave me hope. for those who need constant exterior stimulation and must be always on the go - this book is eye opening for them as well- to help the understand that they must be aware that there is another way of doing and being.  It's all OK.<br />the author knows her subject well and presents the facts and thoughts in an entertaining manner as well.<br />Corporations should be using this as HR guidelines for encouraging and mentoring employees on all levels as well as interviewing prospects. they may be missing the next Einstein!
B008XX6J4C|5.0|This cd exceeded my expectations!  With wonderful musicality, the pieces draw you in and keep you tapping your feet or humming along the entire way through.  Interesting song selections are so varied and fun that it would be hard to pick my favorite, and I would definitely purchase another cd by this extremely talented group!
B00005QGAT|3.0|if i had known how much of this classic jackson album was commentary i would have purchase the regular album. it takes up a lot of space and once you have heard it - well once is enough. i will have to purchase a new CD for just the music. oh well.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I love the game.It keeps you busy big time.You can create accounts that if you don't want to get messed up you just make them a account.!
B0055V6EZE|5.0|Mr. Laurie's album is most entertaining.  the songs are not all familiar but the arrangements used make them all very fun to listen to and it was such a surprise to hear it. I find that while i am driving it puts me in a fine mood and doesn't distract as well. just good music with excellent orchestration and Mr. Laurie's fine voice. I will certainly consider another CD of his singing!
B0086700CM|3.0|Entertaining, but eye hand coordination & memory a bit slow for this.  Wish I was a tad younger to get more out of this.
B00005QGAX|3.0|Once you hear this commentary its a waste of space if you like to hear a CD a couple of times in a row( e.g. driving long distance etc) . had i known it was so much commentary i would not have purchased this edition.
0545259096|4.0|A good ending to this trilogy by an author with a lovely writing style. There's an interesting dialogue throughout the series about the nature of parenting and what constitutes a good parent that gets resolved here in an unexpected way. Cole and Isabel have real character growth and I found that I really ended up liking both of them. Rachel was just a plot device, but Cole and Isabel were real characters that changed. As in \\"Linger\\", the magic vs. science became a way to keep the story grounded in the real world as young people are turning into wolves. Clever.<br /><br />I wondered about the plot device of having an outsider help the pack in the final plan. Did the author feel that these young people needed some adult help in the end to get it all done? It seemed a bit contrived, but it was nice to see Sam finally come to terms with his past and grow into a man and a leader. I also liked that Grace acknowledged the change and liked it because that's real life. People grow up and change and if we really love them, we celebrate the change and stick with them. Some feel the ending was too open-ended but I thought it was fine. (contains language)
B008FPOIT6|4.0|a book about a magical bookstore ! what better for a reader! the bookstore offers books on a select few can even decipher and the recordkeeping system of each customer's purchase ( including what they wore, how they acted, etc) is enticing from the beginning.  the characters are interesting - the young college boy who has a shift at the store to the manager to the other clerks.<br />i love books like this that stretch the imagination, while offering mystery and happy thoughts throughout.  i found some of the passages returning to me upon occasion - visualizing the tall dark shelves and crowded little store etc.<br /><br />enjoy!
0545123275|4.0|I loved \\"The Scorpio Races\\" by this author and decided to try this trilogy. Yes, it's \\"Twilight\\" with wolves instead of vampires, but way better written. The writing is artistic with lots of poetry and art references and the characters of Sam and Grace are actually interesting. It has some themes of guilt and responsibility that are good for a teen audience. Bear in mind, however, that it's a YA novel so it's a fun read and not classic lit. (mild language and a sex scene)
B00005QGAZ|5.0|as everyone knows. this is the classic jackson album. even if you are not a jackson fan you probably like at least one song on it. just buy it.
0545123291|3.0|First, what I liked about this second book in the trilogy. The writing is beautiful and atmospheric as can be expected from the author. I liked the introduction of the Cole character, who has depth and is interesting. I also liked that he and Isabel were narrators because they provided some interesting counterpoints to the Sam/Grace story. The whole concept that the magic can be contained by science was interesting and different. I also liked the gender role reversal that Sam can be in touch with his emotions and artistic and Grace is the logical numbers person. Sam defers to Grace when he needs logic.<br />Second, what I didn't like. I felt like this was the middle book of a trilogy. I know, it was, but it shouldn't feel like it. It moved the big story along but there wasn't the narrative tension in this novel to make it feel like it was important on its own. So I accepted it as the bridge and enjoyed the lovely writing.
B007THA4FI|3.0|Ms. Rowling has a gift for story telling but as i ventured further into this book , frankly i couldn't finish it. it seemed to go on &#34;forever&#34; and the plot has many, many characters which in a series would be OK, but for a stand alone, it is wearisome to this reader to have so many characters and little except the death of a counselman to bind them. the characters- the children and some of the adults, are very sad indeed and that has nothing to do with the death that occurred.  i hope that one day i can go back and finish it but for me i can't do it right now. I hardly ever NOT finish a book, bad  or otherwise.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This series always makes me laugh and this is the only book that I will read the next one I don't like new books!
B005DOKL3E|2.0|i thought this would be a good case but i found it cumbersome to use as you always have to hold it or put it someplace when you are using your Fire.
B008OOYALE|5.0|the people who get these games for children and say they did not know that you have to pay real money should read the darn description why don't people read the description
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Loved this book. Even tho you may think you know the ending you have to read every word, every page to get there.
B0072GPQNG|5.0|Beautiful well done film, story leads from one to another of the horse's life, awesome horse, great story, beautiful horse.
B001KZG99A|4.0|Loved this intor movie and the introduction to Ironman and the other characters it introduces from the Marvel universe. I thought that Gweth did a great job as Pepper Pots.
141694737X|4.0|Our year old daughter really loves this book. The flaps are sturdy and she has a lot of fun flipping them around.
B009IU6BIS|5.0|I can not believe how smooth and clear the streamed movie is. This one is a classic! We find some new little detail every time.
B008L1DNGI|4.0|Thanks Sega!  One of my favorite games on Dreamcast now on my phone.  The puzzels are very easy to start but get fun as you continue on.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|The game is pretty cool and i like how it gets harder and harder and how it challages your mind.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved this book!! It had everything! Romance, Action, Sadness... I enjoyed every word and I never wanted to put it down!! I'm definitely reading the next one:)
B002UOSRAE|5.0|This movie is our families favorite when they were younger, they are in their 30's and their shilren love Disney to. We purcashed this movie from Amazon for 2 of our granddaughters. They love it just as their daddy did when he was young! Thenk you! Cindy
B005LAII12|5.0|So you may need to be from boston to get half the jokes, but if you are, or have been there watch it. It is wicked good dude.
B0002WZTOI|4.0|Top Gun (Widescreen Special Collector's Edition)<br />Excellent copy.  Sound track is great on my 6 channel system.  Like being in the cockpit with the pilot and his backup guy. Wow!  Seems to be the discriptive word here.  Have read some of the complaints about the transfer system used  in the video, however, this didn't seem to apply in the copy I received.  Have a 60 inch Sony HDTV and this film looked excellent.  Did not have any loss of visual content either top, botton or edges of the screen.
B008DM4OTA|5.0|I first downloaded the free version of Dr. Panda's Hospital, but it was very limited on what your child could do.  I upgraded and my daughters loves playing this app.  She is having fun!
B002ZG97EC|5.0|If you haven't seen this, you need to! I am a huge Steve Carell fan, but I really love this story because in the end its really about adoption and since we adopted our 6 month old little man, I love any positive story about adoption.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Pinterest benefits the whole family.  I love it for the art projects and clothes.  My husband finds awesome recipes to cook. It's very addicting, but full of amazing things!
B0091REZMW|1.0|This could have been a great hidden object game, but it turned out to be a total waste of time. Going back and forth between the same few rooms looking for the same few objects, sometimes in the same place I've already found them, is just pointless and frustrating. The &quot;quests&quot; are a joke- it tells you to find an item but then sends you to a room to find a list of other unrelated things. Many of the quests don't involve any skill or thought-tap on this little monster and pay 2500 coins to banish him (but then several more keep coming back). Add on the fact that you have to use real money to buy &quot;diamonds&quot; in order to move on, and I'm officially done with it. As someone else already said, I don't mind paying for an app, but finding out you have to pay to PLAY a free app is really annoying. And considering it actually gives you the option of buying something like 3000 diamonds for $100-I'm guessing it could actually be quite expensive to finish this game.
B0042U94UQ|5.0|This movie is one that we have watched over and over . We take long car trips and this movie is always one we take . Cant weight for the next one to come out.
B00005214X|5.0|Wonderful Music by a  Legend of good rock, I have played it to every ones delite, most songs are great and I made a CD of all<br />th
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I've been reading Steven King stories since I was 13. I'm 40 now and never tire of his witty and personal/paranormal writing style.  You will be amazed by how much you DIDN'T know about the JFK (attempted) assassination.
B004QZ9PLU|4.0|I love Nicholas sparks books and this is included although it was very predictable. Seemed very similar to a lot of the notebook.
B0077EBWVI|1.0|HOLY CRAP!!!! i can't believe how they desecrated this film! i'm not a troll. i actually wasted 2 hours of my life watching this because i was forced to on a plane and now i wish the airline would give me my money back for making me suffer. story was flat. characters were flat. acting was flat. ren, willard, ariel, ariel's older boyfriend rusty, ariel's father the preacher, everyone lacked the personality and edge that set each one apart in the first one and you are left with a complete and total feeling of just plain blah and disgust. avoid this flaming pile of dog crap at all cost and get the original.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Season 3 has turned out to be a great season.  I am thoroughly impressed with the show.  Highly recommended for all ages.
B002QE3CTY|2.0|The only thing that got me through this book was curiosity about it's ending. The characters were one-dimensional and lacked development. The dialogue was forced and uninteresting. The writing itself lacked creativity and finesse. I wouldn't recommend it.
B00AFWEPVI|3.0|I think that Kindel should rethink the price of the HD to include an APP to run the camera.<br />Complete disappointment came over me when I found out that, for the camera to work on<br />my new HD, I had to buy an APP.
B006LSZECO|4.0|kept my interest...crazy people...we are reading it for book club anxious to hear what other people think,thought provoking  gone girl
B004GBFF5Y|3.0|Story line was okay, but kinda petered out towards the end. Not really a messge to it all. Just a story that went nowhere really.
B004SJ3BCI|1.0|deleted this app from my unit. I do not care for the game. Obviously a personal opinion. Just not for me.
B00A9X9TIW|4.0|This movie was not what I had expected. I thought it was going to be all right but after watching the whole thing I just didn't know what to say. The actors and actresses did an amazing job and the director obviousely knew what he was doing. This goes into my top list of movies.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I like this app a lot. It can be set up to moniter different locations, it gives storm warnings and defines what is invovled in that warning (why they are posting a warning)  Gives more information than the local weatherman. Only thing better is looking out the window, but that doesn't give you eveything that is coming up. This will.
B000ALLLDO|5.0|The Gladiator has been one of the most inspiring film events in my life.  Not only did Russell Crowe become the Gladiator in form and spirit, the sound track brought you right into the scenes.  I play it constantly, along with the other Gladiator recordings and I can easily imagine myself in the film and the era it portrays.
B000Q99EAC|5.0|This is a great movie, full of motivational speeches. Watched all the series, and changed my views on life. These movies are GREAT!!!! got the rental for around $3 probably the best 3 dollars I spent.
B0086700CM|5.0|Great game!  Our whole family loves this game challenging and fun,  ages 6 to 74.  beware very addictive,  hard to put away.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I love the mix of puzzles and hidden picture mini games throughout this game.  Casual mode is not too easy and its not so hard that it frustrates you.  I haven't needed the hints at all!
B005FISBTO|5.0|Another great season of Dexter!!  Our only issue with the DVD is not the content, but how Showtime packages it.  Each disc has the Showtime intro and provides snippets of most of their shows.  You can not advance forward either, you have to sit through the Showtime intro each and every disc.  I'd recommend NOT watching any of the snippets because they show (at least for Dexter) scenes from future episodes.  Although they are very brief, they may just be a spoiler for your particular show.  Aside from that, nice packaging for the DVD and we can't wait to get Season 7.
B009HEMW4W|4.0|It was the normal MIB gig.  There was one exception and that happened towards the end when it was learned that there was a very special relationship between 'J' & 'K'.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|I could barely put it down.  It kept you wondering what would happen next.  A mystery til the end.  Recommend it to anyone who likes mystery and intrigue.
B0052AC8C6|3.0|This is an adult good guy vs greed storyline wrapped in a cartoon presentation.  The 5 year old and up will get it for sure.
B005LAJ22Q|3.0|According to recipient there seems to be a portion that is missing or won't play on the disc.  I am giving it a three because it was still received quickly and was in good condition.  I have asked recipient to please retry and if there is still a problem to please give it back to me so I can handle further if necessary.
B008QE9XD2|5.0|Wasn't sure if I was going to like this after seeing the reviews. It was funny but had more of a darker side than I thought it would. Pretty good movie. Enjoyed it.
B0015FHDRW|5.0|This was a great grungy, 60's sounding side project from Green Day.  I loved all of the songs and saw them live in Long Beach as Foxboro Hot Tubs as well.  A great CD.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|It''s like I'm addicted. I hate waiting for the next book. I literally wanted to cry after the first book having to wait for this one.  This series is so much better than 50 shades.that series was good but seemed immature compared to this one. Really liked this!
B006LSZECO|4.0|This was an interesting book.  The story changed in a different direction than I expected, so I liked that it kept me guessing for awhile.
0307346617|1.0|I cannot for the life of me, understand why this book has gotten such great reviews. It's not a great book. I'm an avid reader of all things zombie so I read it a couple years ago. I was so disappointed. And just recently I saw the author on a show called Zombies vs Vampires. He was such a freaking tool, douce bag. He took himself way to seriously as if he was actually an expert on zombies when all he did was jump on the band wagon and copy all the other zombie writers out there. Do yourself a favor and skip this one.  You won't be missing anything.
B004GHBQ7O|5.0|It's nice to have a collection of their live performances.  They sound just as good live as they do recorded.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I was looking for a cheap book & found this one. I wasn't sure about it because of the cover. As I started reading I could not put it down. This book let's you feel every emotion of the characters and makes you feel as if you would apply the situations to your own life...I guess never judge a book by its cover ;) great book!
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|LOVE the first season of Dexter and all those that followed.  His character narrates so well and it's a darkly entertaining show.  Everyone on the show acts great too.
B006LSZECO|4.0|If you require your books to have tidy resolutions and redemption for its characters, don't read this book.  However, if you love a book that keeps you reading into the night, Gone Girl is for you.  The story is told through the dual narration of a wastrel husband and his wife who vanishes on the couple's fifth wedding anniversary.  What follows are more twists and turns than a roller coaster.  Very good read.
B0047Y0FGY|4.0|This book made me laugh a lot.  She has a quick wit and it reads pretty quickly.  Her stories were cute.
B007UPNA6Y|2.0|Heard so much about it - finally bought it & found myself scanning & flipping over pages. Could not get into it im afraid!
B004X1WUQ4|5.0|Much of what we understand and much of what is executed by Modern Economists is premised upon the mind of Keynes. It is remarkable today to read of Nobel Laureates in Economics who obtain a wide understanding of society and the workings of money as value for labour. This read is invaluable to all of us, mere mortals, who want to help and serve Humankind.
0385721234|5.0|I re-read this every so often.  I have passed it to friends that need to brush up on Spanish for language aptitude tests.  Easy reading-good story.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I'm kind of &#34;late&#34; joining the whole Angry Bird bandwagon but I'm glad I finally caught it because I just love playing it and I've also discovered some of the other versions (Seasons; Rio and now Star Wars).  The best &#34;time-waster&#34; out there.
B008XNZMOU|1.0|What turn of events will it take before Taylor Swift quits polluting the airwaves<br />with her adolescent dribble.Her lyrics reflect the IQ of a house plant.Every song is<br />the same,\\"oh poor me,my boyfriend,A:cheated B:dumped me C:thinks I'm very stupid {a obvious<br />assumption}.Then this repetitive unimaginative mess is sung in the always twangy,whining,dimwitted<br />voice.The newest song,\\"Never Getting Back etc etc\\" is shockingly annoying and moronic even for her<br />low standards.Actually that is an insult to morons.Note to Taylor,you can't be brainless and 14 forever.<br />Want to avoid being dumped ?? Try growing up and being a woman rather than a self absorbed child.See<br />for example Miranda Lambert.
030791545X|3.0|Delirium is a story with lots of potential.  There is an easy flow to the writing, and it's a credit to the author.  Even though you know what's likely to happen, there's still an element of suspense as to how and when, and that's important to the story.  However, it was longer than it should have been because its primary focus was on the protagonist.  There were times I skipped sections because they were redundant veto the story.<br /><br />I've read a few dystopian stories and, unfortunately, this one misses the mark when it comes to what I'd consider a completely developed story. It's almost a given that if you introduce a whole new concept of the world, you spend some time explaining it to the reader.  It is important to the development of the story because without it the reader will be unable to grasp the driving forces behind the actions of the characters.  Otherwise, it's like a painted canvas that's missing some of the shapes and colors -- you might be able to discern the gist of it, but it's not quite as rich and powerful.<br /><br />I would read future books by this author because she is writes well, and will likely improve with time.
B008B68J2G|5.0|This cafe set is so cute and very colorful! The pic does not do it justice. My daughter loves to pretend her dolls are in Scaris!
B00APUQT7I|5.0|I think this was my favorite of all the ice age movies that i have seen. I enjoyed it greatly!
B008B68IUY|5.0|This car is bigger and cuter than the roadster. Bought it for my daughter for Christmas. She loved it! It's a sturdy car for play too!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I read all the time. I love to lose myself in Great stories. This book blew me away. It was so sweet and sad and heart wrenching. I felt excited, sad and sometimes sick!  It's rare that I get so excited that I can't stop reading. I read it in one night because I COULD NOT PUT IT DOWN!  The next day I had to read it again because I knew it would be even better now that I could appreciate every single word. Holder is amazing!!!!
B0083P1QUM|3.0|I have read the whole series.  Can't turn down the new ones though they are not as compelling as they once were.  Still enjoy Kay's family colleagues and friends.
6305069611|5.0|Saw this as a Bowie fan when it was still at the theatre.  It is the story of an alien whose on planet is in a terrible drought & dying, who comes to the water planet (Earth) to try to find a way to get water home.  The way he is treated when he is found out is appalling - and I'm sure we would really do it all.  Similar to ET, but NOT for the kids, some rather x-rated scenes.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|The first 8 episodes of season 3 are amazing! Can't wait for the rest of it!! It's a must see!!
B004TI5N38|4.0|This was a very enjoyable book, I like the ending and how the book came together.  I am looking forward to more stories about Puller.
B003UESJH4|5.0|&#34;The King's Speech&#34;. Adding dvd to reference library for myself, my children, my children and my great-grandchildren. So personal and understandable about the King and anyone with his speech problem.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I really enjoyed how the characters are able to continue through the years and intertwine through both books as they all grow older.
0062202081|5.0|This book was on The Santa list. She is happy as she got what she asked for..... She IS a Belieber!
B000W93CHC|5.0|This takes place 200 hundred years after &#34;The Pillars of Earth&#34;. I thought Ken would not be able to pull if off but I enjoyed this book better.
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|This show is REALLY awesome, love everything about it. Can't wait to purchase the rest of the seasons on DVD.
B0070ZLZ1G|5.0|Interesting read for why children succeed.  This idea of &#34;non-cognitive skills&#34; is fairly new, but very interesting.  Tough did a great job mixing some personal anecdotal stories in with some more in-depth research.  These issues are obviously incredibly complex, but Tough kind of simplifies them to the lowest common denominator.  That's not necessarily a bad thing, because it makes it more readable and appealing to the masses, but sometimes this book oversimplifies some very complex issues.
B000AGTPUU|5.0|I have seen this movie many times and I love it. I bought it for or Christmas movie collection. Very happy
B00APUYWYA|5.0|A fun movie with good music, funny characters and a feel good story. What is not to love about this movie? I have watched 3 times, just for its &#34;smile worthiness&#34;.
B008NW67E0|5.0|Good cd, good music and good price...<br />It was just on time for a Christmas present, he loved it!<br />Thank you!
B008D36INE|2.0|This movie just did not make it for me.  It was interesting how it was made like an old movie but the plot just trudged along for me and did not really hold my interest well.
B003O86FMW|4.0|It was easy to anticipate, but a nice read anyways.<br />Good book for anyone who way a nice and easy read.
B0064X7FVE|3.0|I have had other weather channels on other electronic devises that I liked better.  I dont feel the site is smooth to navigate around though perhaps I dont have it set up completely.  Provides very basic information.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|The hunger games was the first good book I read I read the first two non stop but when I got to the third book it wasn't as good as the first two but it continued the story my favorite part of the book was the epilogue. I know it sounds crazy but once you read it you will understand. READ HUNGER GAMES SERIES!
B0045XICB2|4.0|I did not think i would like this series but ended up trying it out anyway.  It was engaging entertainment and am look forward to the last chapter.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This was a great book. I could not put it down. I had no idea that it would end that way. Can't wait til the movie comes out.<br />Scoxward
B0098VXBIA|2.0|This movie was very slow and I fell asleep. I found that it did not hold my interest and was not very entertaining.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book is absolutely amazing, I definitely recommend it for both genders. It is a life changing story. It is a must-read..
B006TLFPKO|4.0|The final movie and part 2 is in theaters now but I have not had an opportunity to see it.  I am looking forward to the conclusion of the story.
0061692042|5.0|I've always enjoyed Richard Ford's Montana-based stories more than anything else he writes. His literary voice is spare, sometimes terse; it fits the landscape and the lifestyle there. Short story collections such as \\"Rock Springs\\" and the novel \\"Wildlife\\" evoked this kind of feeling, and Ford's latest, \\"Canada,\\" takes its heart from the Parsons family's struggling existence in Great Falls.<br /><br />Much has already been written about the beginning of this novel, when Ford, through his protagonist Dell Parsons,  mentions a robbery committed by his parents and the murders that followed. The narrative, most of which unwinds when Dell is 15, is actually told in retrospect. Parsons is in his mid-sixties, and in possession of more information, which he parcels out judiciously, not so much to advance the plot as to let the reader come to his or her own judgement about the characters, Dell's parents and his twin sister Berner.<br /><br />When we are fifteen we don't think much about our parents stories, what drew them to each other and what they gave up to fashion a life together. As Robertson Davies once put it, they are but bit players in our own personal drama. But Dell Parsons, in hindsight, and aided by a journal his mother wrote in prison, reconstructs their story in a compelling way. His theory that the bank robbery was perhaps an inevitable consequence of their life together is one of the more interesting turns of inner narrative.<br /><br />Some have found \\"Canada\\" slow going as young Dell escapes a certain future in a Montana juvenile home for a barren town in Saskatchewan, but I didn't. The story of how the young boy is uprooted and forced to fend for himself, among the type of characters who end up in a roughneck town deep in the Canadian interior, kept me involved, wondering how Dell would extricate himself and what exactly he would make of his life.<br /><br />If, like me, you admire Ford's stark honesty and are drawn to his Montana narratives, \\"Canada\\" will be one of your favorites, too.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|I had this on other devices and find that each device it is placed on has a learning curb in terms of navagating my way around the site.  It is okay and I just don't devote much time to this site as my friends.
B007RI56NY|5.0|Train's new album is a collection of catchy, melodic songs that you'll be humming to yourself without even realizing it!
B00AHSIQWE|1.0|I had five people over for New Year's day and four of the five of us fell asleep in this movie.  It was slow with clunky dialogue that did not flow well from scene to scene.  Regret wasting my time on this one.
B0069UP2PI|4.0|Two things compelled me to see \\"Contagion\\".  The first reason is I am a huge fan of director Steven Soderbergh's Academy Award winning film \\"Traffic\\".  Second, I have heard a lot of positive buzz about \\"Contagion\\" and decided to check it out.  While it's not 100% perfect, I was certainly not disappointed with my decision to see it and was very entertained.<br /><br />One of the reasons why \\"Contagion\\" works so well is its top notch cast.  From Academy Award winners Gwyneth Paltrow, Marion Cotillard and Kate Winslet to veterans Matt Damon, Jude Law and Elliot Gould the parts are very well cast and the actors do very well in their respective roles.  I am not a huge fan of Matt Damon but I believe he gives one of the best performances of his carrer in \\"Contagion\\".  His character seems to represent the every day person.  He is fortunate enough to be genetically immune to the deadly virus at the center of the film, but one thing he is not immune to, is its deadly consequences.  His wife Beth (Paltrow) and his stepson Clark (Paltrow's ten year-old son from a previous marriage.) die within hours of each other.  He and his teenage daughter from his previous marriage must remain in indefinite isolation, Mitch learns that not only was his wife unfaithful, she was the person who indavertently started the epidemic by a very sad case of being in the wrong place at the wrong time.  Rioting and looting is happening all around him.  While he was not directly effected by the virus it has had devestating impact on him in many ways.<br /><br />Every movie, even a medical thriller such as this, needs to have a villain and Jude Law excels here as anti-government conspiracy theorist Allan Krumwaide.  He is terrific as a man convinced that the virus, named Meningoencpehilitis Virus-1 (MEV-1) was in fact manufactured by the US government and released intentionally in order for pharmeceutical companies could earn billions marketing the cure.  What made me like \\"Contagion\\" even more is that Allan is soon revealed to be nothing more than a money grabbing opportunist and a liar.  As Matt Damon represents the every day person, Law represents the many conspiracy theorists who emerge whenever any type of diaster emerges.  They all claim to be heroes but they are actually (I know the next part of this statement is not going to make me too many friends.) nothing more than liars and frauds.  I'm glad the movie shows that.<br /><br />Despite the fact that he is only in two scenes Elliot Gould is excellent as Dr. Ian Sussman.  The doctor who defies orders and makes the necessary breakthroughs needed to help develop a vaccine to MEV-1.  His scene where he confronts (and ultimeately slam dunks) Jude Law's character is the best scene in the entire movie.  Gould has the best line in the movie when he tells Law \\"Blogging is not writing.  It's graffiti with punctuation.\\"  Enough said there!<br /><br />I think it was a very smart move on the part of writer Scott Burns and director Soderberg to have the final sequence of just how the epidemic started at the end of the movie.  That sequence is very well done and even a little frightening.  It makes you stop and think how a simple thing as cutting down two trees can have such an impact on people and things.  I always enjoy watching that sequence.<br /><br />I can't wrap up my review without, in all fairness, stating that there is a flaw in the movie.  I had a little trouble buying how quickly MEV-1 spread and how quickly it killed its victims.  I know there is some basis in fact for this.  The Spanish Influenza outbreak in the early twentieth century (Shortly before the end of World War I.) spread rapidly and killed millions of people.  Still, there were survivors of that epidemic.  In \\"Contagion\\" it appears everybody who was infected died within a day or two.  I found that a little hard to believe.<br /><br />With that said, I believe \\"Contagion\\" is a well made thriller that's is worth renting or (in my case) owning.  Irecommend you take some time to see it.  Just don't eat anything that happens to fall out of a bats' mouth and wash your hands!recommend you take some time to see it.  Just don't eat anything that happens to fall out of a bats' mouth and wash your hands!
B009329Y30|4.0|Very romantic and a plot that moved along well and made sense.  The scenes were engaging and the story line was interesting.
B0028RXXFC|4.0|HBO's Rome (2 seasons, some 22 1-hour episodes in all) is one of the best historical productions done with very close to authentic staging & costumes, excellent production values and the best video quality brought out in BluRay. Highly recommended, if you can take a fair amount of bloody battles and life's intimacies, shall we say. But as a means of immersing yourself in the times when Julius Caesar came to power and then was assassinated and Marc Antony and Octavian battled it out. Not a soap opera but a very realistic depiction of life as it might well have been at this time. Highly recommended.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|As soon as I finished book one, I immediately downloaded the next book to find out what happens next! I couldn't be left hanging!
B00A80SHFM|5.0|Really enjoy listening to the whole thing! Just like seeing the movie all over again.  I enjoy Russell Crowe's voice much more than I did in the movie, for some reason. If you liked the movie, buy it!
0307474259|5.0|so this was my secret weapon...  how did I lose 30 lbs in 2 months!?!?!?  by listening to this very smart guy...  he explains the history of nutritional philosophy and science... he explains why we think the way we do about food, why we crave the foods we shouldn't...  there is an entire chapter explaining HOW your body makes fat, WHY your body makes fat and HOW to tell your body to knock it off...  AMAZING knowledge... I cannot stress enough how brilliant this book is and how much is has helped me finally overcome being chubby!!
B00AHSINKO|4.0|How could any show with Meryl and Tommy Lee be anything but great!  Lots of laughs and often hit home with lots of older couples.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Loved reading this book. I couldn't put it down. Great story line and surprises through out the book. Loved it.
B005UBNKWO|4.0|I also own a 1090t, and that processor, although not spec'd out as well, generally feels quicker than this one does. This is a reasonably nice processor, but I wish I would have been able to get another 1090t instead.

B004DM0UII|5.0|xiialive is a great player for SHOUTcast streams.<br />When I searched the GENRE section, I immediately found a great station that I'd never heard of before.<br />The equalizer works pretty well on my Kindle HD7. I use a CUSTOM setting.<br /><br />It does have a couple of desirable features that are not easy to find, if you don't hold it right.<br />Bitrate selection requires holding my tablet in portrait orientation and looking for the android-standard menu on the pull-down buttons.<br /><br />It is not Pandora and it isn't RealPlayer, so there are several internet radio sources that it can't play, but that doesn't mean it is the worst player out there.<br />It just means that it won't play streams that aren't SHOUTcast streams, duh.<br /><br />And I finally found out how to close the player.<br />Press the STOP button, first, and then exit the app with the BACK arrow.
B008KE3960|5.0|This is a highly creative and quite addicting game. There are many planes and jets to choose from and each level can be replayed in multiple different ways. Challenging, but not frustrating. The graphics are cool and all around interesting.
B003CSV7TK|3.0|Great classic but thought I was getting the color version, which really adds to this movie. 5 star movie, 3 star format.
B00866H7SS|4.0|Enjoyed the book, very similar to 50 shades of grey but better written. Anybody who enjoyed 50 shades must read this!
B005K17RU0|5.0|This weather app works great on my Kindle Fire HD. It's proven accurate and has really good graphics and multiple features. I give this app 5  stars.
B00AMBK0X4|2.0|It had some funny dialogue but overall it was kinda stupid, especially if you're from Boston and know people don't talk like they're drunk like everyone in this movie.<br /><br />Mila is perfect. A+ performance on her part. God she's hot...
B004ZJZPZC|5.0|Absolutely loved this movie and the amazing colors.. Blu-ray/DVD Combo + Digital Copy... cannot go wrong with this item.... watched it three times in three days!!!!

B005MMYBXI|5.0|This show will turn a boy into a man! Gannicus is a beast and its awesome seeing the characters develop
B00A2FSTC4|4.0|This movie is inspired by a short story of the same name. The movie varies wildly from the short story, but I expect that. Good mix of action and story. I've watched this movie twice now, and I'll probably watch it again in another couple of years.
B0091LS07E|4.0|very nice .frist time i brought a cd by her.girl on fire was a good mixture of different types of music .

B007SGLZH6|4.0|I was already making Artisan bread when I purchased this book but reading it made improvements. I was convinced to buy a cooking scale and I found the recipes called for more liquid which makes better crumb. This book was worth the time to read.

B008X9Z37A|1.0|I ordered my case the same time I ordered my Kindle Fire. It was actually very nice looking. It didn't seem to fit well into my Kindle, not sure if I just ordered the wrong size or the the straps just were to loose. Unfortunately I had to return the case,the return process was a breeze. I filled out the return form on line, printed out my return lable, found a drop off box for UPS. I rec'd a confirmation notice about being refunded for the case within a 2 days.. I give the return process a 5 stars. And hate to say it but I did found a leather colorful case for half the price.
B0032CVAQQ|4.0|Loved this book and it really made me feel like I was learning something. It really seems to have helped us
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Usually a Nicholas Sparks book makes you weepy. Not this one! There were unexpected twists and I liked how it turned out. Quick read, story sucks you in fast. Then you want to know what happens next and how the main character achieved her goals. I am glad I read this book. Next step, the movie.
B004GJDQT8|1.0|It's just the mobile site. You have to log in every time you want to use it. At least if you use the mobile brouser it cant do anything to your phone unlike this app.
B0009P5YXO|5.0|My fiance is a huge Doctor Who fan! He's been talking about making a Doctor Who from David Tennant series costume for Halloween this year, I thought to myself, what better way yo help his costume off then getting a sonic screwdriver to go with it?<br /><br />Thank you,<br />Risner
030759565X|5.0|This book is beautiful, I poured over it so long before wrapping I almost didn't give it to my sister in law, because I wanted to cook from it myself. I'm ordering a copy for me so we can both cook and compare notes.
B00004T9VY|5.0|An avid Cat Stevens fan, I always find his music uplifting. The CD recording of Tea for the Tillerman was way better than the old LP that I had. Yep, just dated myself.
B000HT3PPG|5.0|This is my favorite Christmas Movie.  I watch it several times each year.  The only movie I like better is It's A Wonderful Like, Starring James Steward (Black and white version is preferred)
B007VPLNGW|5.0|This game is very similar to angry birds.  In my opinion shark dash is easier than angry birds. Game looks great on kindle fire hd.  It is worth the $0.99 that i paid for it, my nephew who is 4 loves this game. So if you are looking for a cute game to help entertain a child or if you happen to enjoy games like angry birds, get this game.
B000HKW7E0|5.0|This is my favorite funny Christmas Movie.  I watch it along with Miracle on 34th Street and Its a wonderful Life every year and of course  we have to include the Santa Clause Movies.

B00471TLZS|5.0|I haven't seen this movie since it came out in 1982. Loved it then and it hasn't lost it's touch. Still scared the ____ out of me several times. Love the actors - this is a classic!
B001UV4XHY|5.0|We are a family that followed the adventures of Harry since the first book, Till now we like to watch this movie again.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Wonderful book, Sparks never ceases to amaze me. I laughed I cried and I fell in love. Great read for anyone who has loved and lost.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|If you are a person that likes romantic movies, you will love this one!. I have watched Pride & Prejudice almost a dozen of times and I intend to go for more. Will like to see more movies like this!!
B00A8ECU24|4.0|it's a wonderful game! even my sons enjoy it! the only complaint I have is the high amount of gems needed to buy ponies and shops. I've no problem with saving them up but Rarity, who is a goal, costs 90 gems. otherwise I absolutely adore this game!
B001IFZL50|5.0|This is an excellent show! The comedy was right up my alley! I typically find shows like this to be boring.
B002BI6SMI|5.0|I love action movies and this movie was filled with it. Liam Neeson is a very good actor with lots of talent.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I like this series. Really good story. Can't wait to read the last book in the series. Can't get enough
B005KELW26|5.0|This case was beautiful. Well made but we bought a kindle fire hp and the case was for a kindle fire so it did fit and we had to return it for another.
B007MS5B6Q|4.0|My only negative is having room for only one DVD...would be nice to make it a little roomier inside...or something beside it for the additional seasons 'cause you know, a Walking Dead fan will have ALL seasons in their collection!!!<br />Great product!
B006LSZECO|4.0|This book was definitely a page turner for me. I really couldn't put it down. Lots of twists and turns throughout the book. I wasn't thrilled with the ending, but great book!
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I absolutely loved The Piano Guys. My first encounter with them was on Facebook just before Christmas, someone had posted their video O Come Emmanuel there. When I listened, and watched the video, it was so touching to hear the way these two instruments blended together and the cello, absolutely incredible. I love violinist but this has swayed me towards the haunting allure of awesome piano and cello combination. I enjoy writing stories while listening to The Piano Guys music because it puts me in a mood to create. I cannot say enough about these talented performers, their ability to stir the emotions and invigorate creativity, and look forward to hearing more from this great duo.
B005LAIGYQ|5.0|An action packed war tale by those who do this for a living. No need to train actors on tactics here. I found the most interesting thing reading the credits. It almost appears to be a film shot by the Navy. It certainly is predictable, but a great action flick showcasing Seal Team tactics.
B0041KVW2K|5.0|Es difícil decir de qué manera un producto que en sí ya es hermoso puede superarse a sí mismo. Para mí, en este Box-Set está el mejor ejemplo: todos los discos con ediciones cuidadas, material de colección, fotos, sobres internos para el vinilo originales (aparte de los funcionales), etc. El libro adjunto es una joya, un papel y resolución de las fotos realmente sorprendente. Lo vi con mis amigos y no lo podíamos creer,<br /><br />Si tiene las luquitas, recomendadísimo.
B0063GORYU|4.0|I enjoy the game and play it all the time. Not hard to play. But tough enough to be challenging

B0042FZOFU|5.0|I bought this for my son and he loves it.  Thanks allot for your product.  He enjoys watching this DVD.
B001EC2IXK|5.0|I would recommend this to everyone who hasn't seen it & encourage those who have to see it again.  It is a great movie
B009GIPDQS|3.0|A good story until the prisoner who engineered his own release under the witness protection scheme suddenly became the villain, leaving the reader with a sense of injustice and disappointment.
B00AHQNHSY|5.0|Before Moboplayer, I had to spend hours converting each file.  With Moboplayer that is all gone. Just drag and drop the file and begin watching.  Only comment I have is there is no real help file to use it.  Just play with the buttons and you'll learn it pretty fast.
B004LWZWGK|2.0|The dvds don't want to snap back in to the box. I let someone use it and when I looked down later on that night, the Blu Ray disk was under tree. Seems like they are trying to go to far in all the dvds,
B001G9LVGG|5.0|Midwinter Nights's Dream is  Another beautiful CD. She sings like an angel I'm very happy to have added this to my  music collection. I also purchased Nights in Alhambra...Excellent !

B007FZ7QZA|4.0|The music is great and this album doesn't disappoint. However, when I received the album, part of the case was damaged. That I didn't like so much.
0374533571|5.0|It was an amazing story. So well written. I've seen the move a few times now, but it's totally different then the book. I loved them both. So if you have seen the movie,  I would recommend you read the book, because it was so different you wouldn't want to miss out on the story the way it's told by the writer and vise vers.
B00A1EOBJQ|5.0|Fantastic CD...when does the second one come out?  I will be buying that one too!!!  All of the songs on this CD are excellent.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|Great movie! As an adult, I've found that I greatly appreciate the new Dr. Seuss movies coming out. Have to sit through them with the kids, so it's great when one is witty and has deeper meaning.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I have an 18 yr old with learning delays (which is why we bought the kindle fire for her to read on) Angry birds (even though I thought would be silly) is a great asset in helping her learn how maneuver around the touch screen. She really loves it!!! As I guess a million other do as well!!! We also got the Star Wars version of Angry Birds and can't get her off of it. This is the first 'game' that she has been able to play and succeed in. So with that I feel it is great!!!
B003K16P3M|5.0|Love this book. It totally got me hooked for the whole series. Very unlike any book I've read, about a talented young woman and her adventures, all with an unsuspected twist.
B000R7HY0K|1.0|I was really excited when I ordered this dvd however upon opening it and putting it in my dvd player, i found i was unable to play the movie. The disc scratch was not that bad but apparently bad enough to stop it from playing, and I know its not due to a sensitive dvd player. Really disappointed with this purchase!!
B002ZTQVBQ|5.0|Ponyo is such a good movie! It is relaxing to watch, and visually appealing. I enjoy the unique story line too.
6304907648|5.0|This movie rocks ! Sigourney Weaver is great in this movie alongside Holly Hunter! Put it this way a guy goes around killing people the same ways monsters like jeffrey dahmer and ted bundy did but with that you have a great cast of actors who really go great together now i will admit the killer is not scary but i think the basis of the movie didnt need that factor cause their was so much more going on so it will keep you on the edge of your seat but if your looking for gruesome get a rob zombie film this is a thriller action mystery film! ORDER AND ENJOY !

B00785P2QC|4.0|I like this game. Only complaint is the load time is horrible. The more stuff you have on the map the slower the game responds. I have a Galaxy tab 10.1
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I love this book. And the movie. I read this book in a day! It is so amazing and fantastic.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Haven't really had the opportunity to use alarm. But so far...looks good! Settings easy and a decent amount of variety. Worth the 1.99 I feel.

B009VB7P6G|4.0|I'm an adult but I did enjoy this movie.  Little girls would love it.  However, it perpetuates the myth that all little girls should look perfect and beautiful at all times.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Controlled, often beautiful writing.  The characters feel like folks I know, the pace creates the feel of the setting.  Amazing ability to take you directly into the heart of his characters.  More, please!
B000A2W1X2|5.0|I loved the movie Firelight, it was a beautiful story and I received it a short time.  Would like to see more movies like this.
B001DEVZUG|3.0|It's an absurd the amazon made a merchandising of this cd/dvd!! It's only one cd e only one dvd, and the dvd is missing most of music that is showing on the announce. I feeling betrayaled, fooled, an idiot, etc. the product I received is not the same as the announce!! please, don't fool people with wrong announcement!! I'll stop believing on this site!!

B000P0J09M|1.0|The movie stops not even half way through and returns to the main menu. When you go to the scene selections, it doesn't have all the scenes! Awful.
B000VYX8PE|4.0|Amazing and sad book do not read if you don't like sad books other than sad it is a really good book
B008M0NDOK|3.0|Started out fine. Now it's discontinued.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I have read this book in my youth many times and now have read it again to still find it enjoyable.<br />My oldest child read this book as a requirement in school and has enjoyed it as well.<br />Rumor has it that this is to be a movie, if so, then if they follow the path that Mr. Card has left, then it should be a great success.
B003L20IHE|5.0|this was a christmas gift exchange and is a great dvd....her friend loved it and is one of her favorites.....
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I am impressed by this app, especially the AudioBible feature. The app is easy to use and provides several version to select from. A wide selection of English Language versions to select from.
B00280LYIC|4.0|This is an excellent book. Great story and plot lines. Great character development you feel invested in the success of your favorite hero.
B007SGLZH6|5.0|This is the book I've been looking for for baking bread.  So far I've baked 4 of the recipes,  they have all produced good bread and I've made the best bread I ever have made!  The concept of baker's percentages was new to me and a great help.  Highly recommended book.  This one I should have bought in paper so I could make margin notes.
B007B5EDEG|5.0|I really liked the way the author constructed this book. I read all 5 books back to back - took me ages but I couldn't stop until the end!
B005LAIH4A|5.0|It's not a special edition or anything, but it is as described, the Lorax on DVD. And for the price, it was a GREAT purchase!
B002PEP4SC|3.0|I guess this wasn't exactly what I was expecting - felt just too much like an exact episode - fluffy read
B003O86FMW|4.0|This amazing sequel to the hunger games has changed my perspective on the whole series. Suzanne Collins has made many twists and turns in this book but has exploded my expectations for it ,just like the the force field that exploded in the book. My favorite part in this book is when Katniss realizes her enemy. Her real enemy is the person that put her in tree he arena, but surprisingly the head gamemaker is on the rebels side. I hope mockingjay is even better than this sequel that is going up in smoke... because it's catching fire.
B008A1NSTG|4.0|I love animal movies. There were alot of people in this movie, and I loved the 80's flashback. I thoguht it was a heartwarming story that showed what miracles people can do if we all set our differences aside and just worked together. The fact that this was a true story was really cool. My whole family enjoyed this movie.
B001UHOWXI|5.0|Watch it every Christmas. Such a classic. Never gets old. Never goes out of style. Will pass onto my younger generations.
B0095VPBFY|5.0|Plays recent games at decent settings without dedicated care<br />Can be overclocked<br />Really awesome<br />This is a really great budget cpu for gaming
B0087JTAKW|5.0|Many twists and turns along with symbols and emotions for our own lives.  Read it in one evening, could not put it down.
145210655X|5.0|I loved the art in this book, and the usage of actual quotes from the movies was really clever. Definitely recommend it for anyone who's a fan of Star Wars
B00AIQP9DE|2.0|This app was so much fun until I played for an hour and my inventory disappeared. I bought the full version thinking everything would work better. The cabinet will not unlock in the managers office. Please refund or fix!

B0063IH60K|5.0|Might as well have the cards on the table  in from  of you!.......... I love playing this game......keeps me occupied.
B00A9X9TIW|5.0|This movie kept me guessing pretty much the whole time. Fast paced movie along with pretty good special effects. The acting was well done.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|Absolutely love it and way different from the other organ trail and it is great for the kids they are seriously addicted wish it was easier and faster to earn energy
B007UW9WOQ|5.0|Yes, this documentary tells about sushi as an art form, but it is more than that.  For me the most compelling aspect of the film is the way it shows a way of life -- a life dedicated not so much to a profession, but to achieving excellence in what one produces and contributes to society.  In the West we rarely regard our working life that way.  This focus on excellence in the smallest details of purchasing, preparation, and presentation of the perfect sushi has its rewards, but also its costs -- lack of attention to a marriage and to raising children; the dilemma of conveying this dedication to two sons, but only one son can inherit the business.  In a sense this film is about work as meditation and is a window into an Eastern mind set that accepts life-long dedication as a matter of course.
B0084IG8TM|1.0|Although the acting was pretty good by not all,  but most of the actors, the movie itself is heinous, and a true teenagers blood bath.  In a world full of violence everywhere...a world without any true Christian values...We are presented here with another romantic,  bloody teenagers movie....Then we wonder, why our society is in the condition that it is in....I for myself had enough of violence in the movies...As I said, there is already plenty of it in the real world....<br /><br />But, to each its own.......if this movie grossed about $400 million dollars, it is definitely, a very sad illustration of the sick society we live in.....You enjoyed it?  Good for you....You will find this dvd in my trash bin at home........
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I have enjoyed every book in this series and also the Percy Jackson series as well.  Looking forward to the day my sons can read them with me.
B0053FANS6|5.0|This trilogy, really does come alive in blue ray....I hearty offer it for your consideration....Loved it...all three movies....GREAT, GREAT IN BLUE RAY....
B003TSEL7S|5.0|This is a great series of books for young and old.  If you enjoy mythology, you will enjoy these books.
B0091REZMW|1.0|Smart of the developer to ask for feedback before they start asking for more money so you can continue playing.
B0053TMP24|5.0|I enjoy both series of the Olympians that Rick Riordan has been writing.  I am current on all these titles/series and his Kane series as well.  Would recommend to young and old.
B0083P1QUM|4.0|Good read; a little jaded on the relationships and slow at times, but you will never figure out who dun it until the end. I love the Kay Scarpetta character, and this book focused more on her than on the other characters, as she ages and deals with her own demons.
B003ASLJO0|5.0|Clint Eastwood is so versatile!  He is a supreme example of a wonderful actor.  The movie world is a better place because of his talents, and this movie is no exception.
B00ADIT8U2|4.0|I thought this was a great game.  I only got stuck once .  I wish there were more games like this one.
B000056BB3|5.0|This is one of my husband's go-to movies when he wants something fun to watch without too much noise and flashing screens.
B008HT4FUW|5.0|I watched season 1 last year on PBS and bought this to see season 2.  It is even better watching it on  the Blue Ray disc.  This story grabs you and you want it to go on and on.  The scenery is breathtaking, the acting is superb.<br />This is a series to be watched again.  Season 3 starts on PBS tomorrow.
B006JPS1OM|4.0|I think its great! The only problem i have is when i get to a certin part and i save it, then go back and try to open it, it will load then  cut the whole game off. Fix this problem and i will give it 5 stars.
0394818237|5.0|Our 3 year old son loves these richard scarry books--the trucks one is also fantastic.  This book is so detailed, giving our guy lots to look at and ask questions about.  It covers so many jobs in detail--from how the mail is collected/sent, to what's involved in building a house, to how bread is made.  Fabulous book to have in your collection, easily one of our child's fave.
B007TBZ63Y|4.0|A good book. Action packed and full of adventure.<br />Would recommend to those who have read the first two books.<br /><br />P.S. ever heard the story of arachnes the weaver?
B004LWZWGA|5.0|Have not watch yet.<br />Like Batman movies Will get all that comes out .<br />I do not know what else to say
B007EE4XKI|5.0|Really exciting story which includes a flashback to bring us up to date on what has happened to Data's father in the years since he \\"died\\". It would be best to read \\"Immortal Coil\\" by Jeffrey Lang first, but I read it after the trilogy and still enjoyed them all.<br />Only thing I didn't like was the death of a recurring character. Very sad.
B008Y1YK9Y|5.0|All ways liked Men in Black movies. They have all ways been good. this one is good also. Keep making them.
B007SUW24W|5.0|A lot of CDs you will buy you may only like a few songs. I loved this whole cd! I'm so happy I bought it! :-)
B005O7PXNS|5.0|This show makes me happy, I could watch it without sound and be just as excited about it, but the sound is a terrifically awesome bonus! I can hardly wait for the next seasons!!!!
B0091REZMW|5.0|I have been playing only a couple of day, but I have to say I really am enjoying it. I do have to say to those people who complain about coins and diamonds if you dont spend them all right away you dont have to worry about it. Honestly, it's not that hard. Dont try to do everything at once.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Paid $20 for this and it was a great deal.  Great movie and even at a higher price you're getting a digital copy (non HD, boo!) 3D version, DVD, and standard Bluray.
B007FC3AAI|5.0|Since reading the books I find the movie enjoyable.  I have now investigated other Vampire movies and series i.e. Buffy the Vampire slayer and Angel and can see how the author seems to have copied some of their ideas about vampires and used them in the twilight saga.  I would recommend the books and the movies to any friends who love romance.  This is an incredible romance story
B000RH0C8G|4.0|Couldn't put it down!  Truly a book that kept you wondering what the move would be.<br />Recommended for younger people to read as well.
B0084IG8TM|5.0|I loved the books and read them several times before seeing the movie.  I liked the movie almost as much as the book.<br />That alone is impressive.  I find Most books are much better than the movies made from them.
B004DLPXAO|4.0|down loaded it for the wife on her new tablet .Now I can order her books on my account  and she likes the way it works
B0042MEQVG|5.0|Since reading the books I find the movie enjoyable.  I have now investigated other Vampire movies and series i.e. Buffy the Vampire slayer and Angel and can see how the author seems to have copied some of their ideas about vampires and used them in the twilight saga.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I loved this book!  Just as I thought is was about to end, the story takes a turn I didn't expect.  The relationship between these 2 characters is definitely a Beautiful Disaster. Despite some of the very real flaws of the male lead...he is very worthy of being loved.  I think I liked his character more than hers. She was very frustrating at times.  If this becomes a movie, it will play well on the big screen as long as Hollywood sticks with the story and not deviate.
B000HEWEJO|5.0|This movie DVD is awesome, as expected!  It's one of our favorite Christmas classics.  Delivery was quick!  I would definitely recommend it to everyone.
B007SGM084|4.0|I was peer pressured by my best friend to read this and am I glad I caved!  First time I read it...I read it so fast because I couldn't believe what I was reading.  I read it a 2nd time because I was so sad it was over.  Better the 2nd time because I took my time with it and paid more attention to detail and character development. I loved the music referenced in the book and have downloaded it all on my iTunes! Great variety. Book 1 is very dark, disturbing and sexually explicit but it all makes sense at the end. I definitely got schooled on the world of BDSM.  While I am 20 years older than \\"Ana\\", I found my thoughts mirroring hers...almost verbatim. I thank God I waited to read this after all the books were published.  At the end of book one, I didn't know if want to sob or throw up more.  Fortunately, I had book 2 available and started right in.  Books 2 & 3 are more romantic but still explicit.  There is lots of character development and some twists to the story.  While \\"Christian\\" is a very broken man on the inside, I can see why she loved him and put up with him.  In real life I doubt this relationship would last.  But for the book it works well.  It is a series that I will read over and over again.<br /><br />Over all it's 4 stars.  It would be 5 if the writing was better.  Too much use of the \\"F\\" word as a verb. That's not a turn on for me.  Too many repetitive sayings or word choices in the writing that I would do differently.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Love this game! Depending on your state of mind, you can play from \\"easy\\" to \\"tear your hair out\\" and still enjoy it.
B00AMBK6J2|4.0|it is great movie, I love the voice of ted &#34;peter&#34; gives the movie good taste of humor. ;) ;)
B000SI939S|5.0|I bought this book because I always wanted to know if it was Iggy or Ninny at the end of the story.  While it kept with the movie on most parts, it really painted and more clear and brighter version of the story.
B0070XB0N6|5.0|This book needs to be required life reading for all kids 8 and up. I am a new Gaiman fan.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|I love how this show just keeps you guessing.  The antagonist can quickly become the protagonist and the plot changes constantly.
B00AMBH70S|4.0|It was a good movie, on its own.  However, I don't like it being connected to Bourne because it feels like a different movie.  But full of action, and cool 'spy' like things.
B0092MKFIY|4.0|Imagine Dragons is a new group for me and I have really enjoyed this selection of their music. The whole album has a good sound to it. I'm a big fan of Coldplay, One Republic and Mumford & Sons, and I think this group's music fits right in with those. Give this album a listen. You'll probably enjoy it too!
B00A9X9TIW|3.0|It was good- but should have paid less for it.  I should have waited for it to come out in red box.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love the game Subay Surfers because it is fun and I could play it for hours at a time
B00AHSMDQY|5.0|I would dislike the fact its almost 3 hours long, but it kept me on the edge of my seat the entire movie. I would recommend this to any batman fan or Movie watcher. Just plan a bathroom break like 1/2 way through.
B003VIWO8Y|5.0|This was a great read.  I really enjoyed Dave's story very much.  Makes you really think of him as a hero that he is still making and performing music after all these years with everything he has been through.  Great read.
B009GEBBNQ|4.0|A cute and funny comic book movie.. I loved Robert Downey Jr and the guy who play Captain America in it especially.  The Hulks part was a lot smaller than I thought it would be.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Evernote is what I use for my diary and whenever I want to transfer a random file.  Its layout is fairly user friendly.
