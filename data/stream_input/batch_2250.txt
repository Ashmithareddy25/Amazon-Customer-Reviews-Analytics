B001EIOOV8|4.0|Casino is a brilliantly acted crime drama that chronicles the rise and fall of the fictional Tangier hotel and casino in Las Vegas, and is a classic Scorsese film. Though it's a bit long, and quite a bit over-narrated, it boasts some strong visuals and performances that rank it as one of the director's best.

0307950654|1.0|I came to the novel as a lover of the works of Jane Austen and a newcomer to the work of PD James, lured by the effusions of critics on the back cover that this was an `assured', `dazzling' and `elegantly gauged' homage to Austen's work as well as a crackingly good crime novel.<br />I am afraid that it disappointed on every level.<br />As a crime novel, I found it lacking in most of the essentials. Firstly, without giving anything of the plot away, I had no sympathy at all for the victim; the writer utterly failed to establish any of that compassionate connection which is essential if the reader is going to be sufficiently outraged by the crime to be engaged in its solution. He remained a faceless cypher, without substance or humanity.<br />Secondly, I could find no shred of assurance that the accused was not eminently capable of the crime; I didn't care if he swung or not. Characters' repeated protestations of his innocence carried no weight with me and became self-defeating. A second plausible perpetrator would have created doubt and confusion but it isn't until the last possible moment that a back-up is whisked like a magic rabbit from an all-but invisible hat.<br />The clues were there, of course, but so over-shadowed by the hallowed shades of Pemberley and its august occupants that the reader is denied the sporting chance of solving the mystery: another important ingredient in good crime fiction. Characters are allowed to fudge over important details, and keep their `honourable' secrets. Speech is often reported instead of direct. What would (what should) have cut through these blandishments is a crime-solver - a professional or an enthusiastic amateur - but such a figure is woefully lacking. The reader - like the characters - feels himself thrashing uselessly through impenetrable undergrowth without perspective or direction for most of the time. This is the third big failing of this book as a crime novel. But a decent detective would have cut through the wafer-thin prevarications of the witnesses at a stroke, and so of necessity had to be excluded.<br />So I didn't care about the victim, I didn't trust the (purportedly innocent) accused and I felt toyed with by the writer which is perhaps the biggest imposition of all.<br />But these disappointments are nothing compared to the writer's failure to take full advantage of the opportunity she has given herself in setting her novel at Pemberley, in resurrecting the Darcys and the Bennets and of developing their characters and relationships.<br />The characters, I am afraid, are mere chimeras of Austen's creations; Lizzie has no wit, Darcy neither the authority we expect nor the easy confidence or even dry humour we hoped Lizzie's love would uncover. The nature of their married relationship is not explored at all. Jane parrots platitudes like a wind-up toy version of her original, Lydia promises some characteristic displays of vulgarity and excess but is kept largely out of the reader's view. The singularly golden opportunity of writing a scene between Darcy and Wickham, with all the potent sub-text of their boyhood, Georgiana's threatened seduction and elopement, and the fraught period between Lydia's discovery in London and her marriage, is absolutely thrown away, reported in a couple of paragraphs.<br />James' language, after an initial effort, is a lack-lustre attempt to emulate Austen's sublime erudition. The closest she comes is a very pale reflection and at times she seems to give up the attempt entirely: I cannot conceive of Jane Austen ever employing the word `dollop'. I am afraid that lifting phrases directly from the original is disingenuous; they stand like monoliths on the barren plain of the novel's narrative style, which is for the most-part prosaic.<br />The attempt in the prologue, to pr&eacute;cis the plot of Pride and Prejudice, is self-indulgent and unnecessary, likewise the epilogue which attempts to unravel Darcy's thoughts and actions in the earlier novel. Neither is relevant to this novel.<br />All in all a flimsy petticoat of a whodunit swathed in borrowed finery. James never spoke a truer word than in her author's note: `had [Jane Austen] wished to dwell on such odious subjects, she would have written this story herself, and done it better.'ther is relevant to this novel.<br />All in all a flimsy petticoat of a whodunit swathed in borrowed finery.

B0000AGWJ7|5.0|Now, I'm not an avid A7X fan but I do know good metal when I hear it and to be honest, I was surprised by just how good this CD was. A7X has never really claimed to revolutionize metal. Instead, they prefer to build upon what's already been done and with influences ranging from AC/DC and Led Zeppelin to Megadeth and Pantera that's exactly what they've done on what many fans refer to as their magnum opus. While not breaking any new ground, Waking the Fallen is a great metalcore CD. It has it all: speed metal guitar work, bone-chilling screaming backed by melodic clean vocals, tight drumming that's neither too repetitive nor overbearing, you name it. The only thing this album doesn't have much of is filler. All of the songs are great in their own ways. From Unholy Confessions to Chapter Four to Radiant Eclipse to the final song, all the songs sound different and are great to listen to. Even though it's not Master of Puppets or Reign In Blood, Waking the Fallen is worthy of your  heavy metal collection.
0848817540|4.0|This deeply complex, densely packed, microcosmic epic of a novel is elusive and profound and in the end perhaps self-defeating. How can Forster encapsulate what he admits is indescribable? How will the reader ever understand what he says is ungraspable by the human mind?<br /><br />The story of a Passage to India is the least of its substance and is quickly told. Adela Quested arrives in India along with her prospective mother-in law Mrs Moore, to see whether a brief and lack-lustre attraction she and Mrs Moore's son Ronny felt in Grasmere might translate to marriage to him in Chandrapore, where he is the City Magistrate. But the insufferable Anglo-Indians, whose community she would have to join, the kind but unreliable Indians with whom she will never be able to strike up a meaningful relationship and India itself combine to render the prospect untenable, even if she loved Ronny. Then a mysterious experience in a cave unhinges Miss Quested, and her passage to India is at an end.<br /><br />It is more interesting to consider the aspects of the novel which both add to its complexity and provide its substance. As her name suggests, Adela is on a quest, to see `the real India', to understand it. It is a cerebral pursuit; only a matter, she thinks, of going there and looking about. The impossibility of such a task is the main thrust of Forster's novel. India is too vast, too varied, too old; a melting pot of culture and religions, a hugely diverse geography of mountains and plains and forested hillsides, a seething mass of multitudes. India cannot be `seen' by the human eye nor, it is powerfully suggested, understood by the human mind.<br /><br />Yet, while emphasising its immensity, the writer also manages to convey its minuteness. Scenes are repeatedly placed within a larger context, a man on the neatly-tended veranda of the club, the club against the sprawling city, the city against the backdrop of mountains, the mountains against the `overarching' sky, the sky itself against the incalculable firmament. This dichotomy results in `muddle' and `mystery'; India is an enigma.<br /><br />The diversity of Indian society adds to its complexity. The intricate differences between Indians of different races, castes and beliefs create a minefield, as well as the delicate mores which must be observed if social relationships between Indians and the British are to be pursued. The unfathomable Indian compulsion to tell a polite and sincere lie rather than an unpalatable truth muddies conversational waters at every turn. Add to this the ridiculous British impulse to force India into a neatly labelled box, to behave as though still in Blighty. But the gaggling chaos of the bazaar, the ramshackle, fly-blown bungalows of the populace, even the well-to-do residences of rich Indians, where guests are frequently tardy and dinner is always late, will never be regulated into the regimented rows of bungalows of the Civil Station. India is ungraspable, a live thing, many-hued, exotic and infuriating by turn.<br /><br />The failure of the British in India to appreciate these facts results in incidents which are, on one level, high comedy, on others, deeply shameful. The officious Surgeon General, the pompous Collector, the whole entourage of petty officials and their bigoted wives congregate at the Club (where no Indian is permitted unless he carries a tray of drinks) to decry India and Indians; they chafe and pontificate within their ludicrously inappropriate evening dress as India shifts and changes and defies categorisation.<br /><br />Amid this atmosphere of vastness and littleness and difference, the characters are constantly engaged in attempts to make connections. In a series of set-pieces, like formal dances, Forster tries to make meaningful links; between British and Indian, Hindu and Muslim, man and woman, man and man, but no two souls are a neat enough fit and even birds of a feather fall out in the end. No one has a wide enough vision or a big enough heart, or, if they have it one moment, it has changed into something else the next. Mrs Moore and the hapless Dr Aziz manage a fleeting spiritual accord, and the strength of it arms Aziz for the ordeal to come, but then India's immeasurable depth swallows Mrs Moore's faith, and she slips from Aziz' grasp.<br /><br />It would be easy to despair, in this mutable and somewhat nihilistic universe, where `everything exists but nothing has value' and where communication, Man's most precious resource, is reduced at last to an empty, meaningless echo. But Forster's mantra throughout the novel is a double helix of hope. As the tiny earth spins into the infinite universe, as the enormity of our own personal India engulfs us, as friends disappoint and loved ones leave, `goodwill, goodwill and more goodwill' and `kindness, kindness and more kindness' is both our bond and our blessing.g enough heart, or, if they have it one moment, it has changed into something else the next.

0307744434|3.0|The subject of this book intrigued me as I had contemplated a circus setting for a book of my own. Like all circuses this one arrives without warning and disappears just as mysteriously, setting each town alight with expectation as the day dawns to find it encamped on some grassy sward, and with a sense of emptiness and loss when the morning comes when the field is empty.<br />Opening only at night, this circus is all in monochrome - but none the less exciting and exotic for that. Every tent has a spectacle which is dream-like in its thrill and wonder. Seemingly impossible feats are performed before the eyes of the mesmerised audience. What is more, the circus offers each individual visitor a unique and personal experience which makes them return night after night, and even causes those who can to travel from town to town in pursuit of the magical splendour of the fluttering pennants and perpetually burning, white-flamed cauldron which is at the heart of the circus.<br />The tricks and illusions are breath-taking; impossible! and yet performed right there in front of their eyes. The atmosphere is intoxicating, charged with magic, as vivid - and as elusive - as a dream, but they are wide awake and when they pinch themselves it hurts. Even the food and drink is more delicious than anything the patrons have ever encountered before. Try as they might they cannot see how the apparently impossible is achieved night after night. It all seems so real.... But it can't be real, can it?<br />This question - how the circus works - is the subject of this tale. But the reader - like the spellbound patrons - becomes almost reluctant to see the wires and trap doors and mirrors which will spoil the illusions. I suspect Morganstern began to feel the same way - that to fully explain things would be to ruin the magic and turn the marvel of the circus into so much canvas and sawdust. But the fact is that from the moment she set out to uncover the force which drives the circus the circus itself was doomed. While quite appreciating her dilemma the solution she came up with felt like an awkward compromise to me. The 'reveal' was fudged and unsatisfactory.<br />Some of Morgenstern's language is really powerful and very evocative and I liked her concept of the circus very much. Unfortunately I found the characters lacked depth and subtlety to the extent that some of them were merely comic-book with names to match and some of the detail felt like it belonged in a children's book - much too simplistic for an adult fantasy.<br />However, when this book is made into a film - which I am sure it will be - it will be fantastic. The opportunities it offers for the special effects people are amazing. I can't wait for that circus to come to town!itself was doomed.

0316223239|5.0|Emma Donoghue's Room is a wonderful reading experience; thought-provoking, emotionally engaging, sad without ever being sentimental, a story about the lowest and the highest reaches of humanity. I cannot understand why this book did not win the Mann-Booker prize.<br /><br />Told entirely from the point of view of five year old Jack, the reader is introduced to Room, the universe of Shelf, Bed, Rug and Wardrobe. This is Jack's world, the only one he has ever known and, as far as he knows, only he, his Ma and `him', the man who visits Ma in the night, are real.<br /><br />But Jack is happy. He has Room, and Ma - his constant companion, teacher, playmate and comforter. Room provides everything that Jack needs: entertainment, education, activity, interest, attention and love. In Room, Jack is safe and Jack is free.<br /><br />But Ma is trapped, and far from safe. Without understanding it, without even seeing it, Jack conveys to the reader Ma's frustration, her boredom, her fear and misery. Her dogged adherence to strict daily routine might provide Jack with variety and secure boundaries but it is all which stops Ma from dashing her brains out on Wall at the appalling prospect of perpetual imprisonment and repeated rape.<br /><br />Then, in a bid as terrifying as it is exciting, Ma and Jack escape, and in a Himalayan learning curve Jack has to find out about the world outside of Room. It is big and strange and very frightening. The sun is too strong, the wind too fierce, the grass too green and the people are too loud. Jack has to share Ma. There's too much he doesn't know. Outside of Room, Ma might be free but Jack is afraid.<br /><br />The main achievement of this novel is Donoghue's faultless and unerring handling of Jack's point of view; the simplicity and perspicacity of this special five year old, his humour, his insight, his courage and his fears, are absolutely convincing and engaging. We shrink, we regress; the parameters of our world view telescopes downward and inward until we inhabit our five-year-old selves once more. From this view-point Room is indeed a safe, if curious, womb and the world outside a terrifying, crazy abyss.<br /><br />Room is based on a true story. Ma's terrible ordeal isn't fictional. Right now, in a street near you, someone may be imprisoned, enslaved, subjected to rape and torture. 'He' represents the lowest strata of human-kind and, scarily, 'he' may be your neighbour, your colleague, the man who runs your local shop. The Media, who ghoulishly pursue Ma and Jack and sensationalise their most harrowing experiences both of imprisonment and release, are little better. In contrast, Ma's great resourcefulness and strength in the face of repeated rape and perpetual imprisonment is truly inspiring, a testament to human - to female, to maternal - endurance, while her occasional droughts of coping, her sloughs of despond provoke the most extreme and tender feelings of empathy.

B009IEXKXI|4.0|So I don't like to give away details re. the story, this review will concern the elements of the book.<br /><br />The journal style was an enjoyable way to \\"see\\" what was happening.  The character development was apparent to the reader.  I liked that the book began with the main characters first log entry & the detailed back-story was shown a few chapters in even though the main character explained what had happened.  Government bureaucracy with all of its shortsightedness and no `Think outside of the box' people in power was illustrated in detail.<br /><br />The main character and a few of the secondary ones had a killer sense of humor.  I found myself laughing out loud quite a few times.  Being sci-fi, there was quite a bit of detail (chemistry, engineering & math), but that just illustrates that the author wasn't just writing conceptually, he actually knew that which he was writing (or did intense research).  There are quite a few \\"geeks\\" (they are working for NASA) but they were true to life, not some stereotype from someone who doesn't know what techies and high science people are really like.<br /><br />I know that typos and errors in indie writing are the fear of a lot of readers.  Being a technical copyeditor, I can tell you that there were only a handful of misspellings throughout the entire book.  They did not detract from the story.  Punctuation was correct, as was the phrasing and grammar.  For a first publishing effort, the entire book surprised me- pleasantly I assure you.<br /><br />All in all, I really enjoyed the entire book.  I read it in one day and continued to think about it after I finished.  I will look forward to seeing what the author writes next.

I noticed an unusually low price mark for this movie and decided to give it a try.  I was reluctant since the vendor is in Hong Kong.  I can happily report, I received it well before the promised date, and even though this is a ridiculously campy movie and Kim Basinger is exceedingly annoying, my husband was thrilled and surprised to now have the complete set of Bond films.  On a side note, my husband reports this version even has a scene that has been deleted from the US version.  Unfortunately, I don't know which scene.

0307341550|5.0|So, I'm reading Gillian Flynn's books out of order. Not that it matters. They each seem to have their own story line and unique characters, but there is definitely a reminiscent feel to the novels, when you compare one to the next.<br /><br />I borrowed \\"Sharp Objects\\" from a friend, after reading \\"Dark Places\\" with my book club. I loved how the perspective of the story switched between three of the main characters in Dark Places, and how the novel kept you guessing until the end.<br /><br />\\"Sharp Objects\\" differs from this in a few ways. First of all, the entire story is told from the point of view of the main character, Camille. Thank goodness that wasn't the case with \\"Dark Places\\", whose main character I couldn't stand (though she does play the heroine of the story). Camille, in Sharp Objects, is complex and sexy, intelligent and severely damaged by her upbringing. She is one of those characters you root for, not because she's the protagonist, but because you get a deep sense of her inner struggles throughout the story.<br /><br />I felt like the mystery unfolded in both novels at just the right pace, and I was sure I knew who was responsible for the crimes in each book, but of course, I was wrong. Next up, I'll read Flynn's newest novel, \\"Gone Girl\\", and see if it's as interesting as her first two books.

I think each are terrifically topical in 2013 irrespective of male or female.  Perfect for college students, interns, entry, mid and senior level professionals. Sandberg is a graduate of Harvard and Harvard Business School, worked for Larry Summers at Sec. of Treasury, top exec at Google (a job she almost turned down) , Boards of Disney and Starbucks, and right hand of Mark Zuckerberg at Facebook ... so yeah, it might be a worthwhile read!

The light gets used for finding things when it is dark, looking in dark places and as a light on the street when walking the dog at night.  Small and compact, but packs a lot of punch when you need the brightest mode.  Battery life is quite good too.  I might go through about two or three batteries in a year.
B003ODIZL6|4.0|I would make this a 4 star. I like this book and I would recommend it to who created dictionary
B00BP29SAA|4.0|My almost 4 y/o loves the Dr. Panda games. They are fun, interactive and cute. Her fav is the Daycare, where she feeds everyone and puts them to bed. We just found this new one and immediately bought it. This one is cute, has lots to do, however I feel like there could have been a little more. Checking out EACH customer for example, or when choosing and weighing the food, having the child put the scan sticker on by themselves. This would be a great chance to learn early money skills, but you just put the money back in the drawer according to color/size...thinking there could be a version where the skills are a little harder for the kids who already love Dr. Panda and want more! Still, great game, will definitely buy the next Dr. Panda when it comes out, whatever it may be!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This is  a awesome. I hope you get it if you read this comment. For only 5 dollars this is a great.
B000YHG72E|5.0|amazon made me right quite a lot here, and I didn't want to but I did anyway. I miss being able to just put in stars.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|Please keep the seasons coming since the acting is wonderful and storyline is great. Thank You! I love the series!
B008JGSM6G|3.0|it was fun but it was hard my kids also liked it and my wife<br />every one liked it a lot
B00683JK9K|4.0|Fun having a jig saw puzzle that you don't have to worry about putting up all those pieced. Definately a plus.
B000IZ6URY|5.0|The title says it all, even though I am pretty sure he is a foreigner. Parker, that is.<br /><br />This movie is so good I consider every single person who made this move, and was<br />featured in it an american. That goes for Kim Jong Il, and Alec Baldwin.
B005ZC0SYQ|5.0|Excellent movie with good effects and story line. Rather dark and foreboding subject matter.<br />Well worth the price of admission.
B003UPPO2G|5.0|A super DVD; enjoy this DVD and place it on your must have list. A play over & over event.
B001AQQR2S|5.0|The kids love it as well as adults.  Great acting by all the main characters. I have to type more words
034552554X|4.0|I recently read this for our book club (yet to meet).  I found the characters and the story line engaging.  Nicely written.  I enjoyed it and can't wait to discuss it at club.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|This book was a delight.  I was reluctant to read it because I am not really a flower person, and romances aren't my literary choice.  Very happy to say that I was wrong to be reluctant,and I would highly recommend this book.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I could not stop reading this book... it really made me realize that you can make it through anything... always have hope
B00A9X9TIW|5.0|My husband and I really enjoyed this movie. Very interesting and keeps you on the edge of you seat. keeps you guessing and thinking!
B00BESM14U|5.0|This movie was wonderful.  The actors were great and I'm pretty sure that almost everyone can relate to the scenarios and people in this movie.  I'm not very good at articulating my feelings about movies and books but this was an awesome movie that I would recommend everyone see and everyone show to their teens.  It's educational in some ways, enlightening and entertaining.  My husband who is a thriller/action movie junkie even liked it.  He can relate to some of it though because he was bullied in school.  I wasn't bullied but I did relate to a lot of the things the lead actress went through as I think a lot of women will.  It's a very good movie that I highly recommend.
B00ADQPB50|5.0|I can't believe how much a show can draw you in and make you forget that you are actually sitting on your bed. I was so addicted to the show that I watched the airing of it plus the encore just is case I missed anything. I love sister Jude and kit (returners from the first season as different characters). I can't wait until next season to see how each actor/ress is transformed into a completely different characters. And how they will twist a new plot into my Wednesday nights.
B00881VLCE|3.0|I wish there was more of a variety, to the puzzles. I found them a little too easy for me
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Excellent book. Gives not just the man's life story, but the feeling behind the story, both military and personal. Easy to read.
B007U1FEJE|5.0|Who would think that bryan Williams could still write great Beach Boys songs.-Well, he did it again.  Way to go Bryan
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|I really like it because I love racing games and this is one of my fav! I cant wait to see what is next? well I hope u like this review!
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|For a free game I must say this has quickly become one of my favorites, between the graphics and the controls this is for sure one of the better games for the kindle fire hd. It keeps my rowdy nephews busy and is also a fun way for me to waste time at work. :)
B005HEK3JW|5.0|Thanks to Amazon Prime I was able to watch all seasons. Each episode has a deep psychological meaning; makes you think about life, existence, understanding other cultures and customs, and so much more.
B008IJTFYW|4.0|I really enjoy this app. It has so many choices that everybody can find something they want to use. My only downside at this point is that the app does not close even when you check the box close after timer.
B0001XAPZ6|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed.  Much better than the chopped up version aired back in the 80's.  Really great to watch again and again.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This is a most read. I could not put the book down.  Loved how Sky & Holder came to gather. The story line keep me guessing homestead going to happen next.  The ending was great.
B005LAJ16I|4.0|Both my husband and I enjoyed it. My son (31) recommended it.  Has some twists we were not expecting that made the difference. Interesting characters and plot.  Does have some sex and violence so not recommended for the young.
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|this is a fun and relaxing. game that is great for killing time. Very unique and different from most games out there.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|Amazing story. Loved it! A more incredible journey has never been illustrated in such a unique light. We should all be so lucky.
B009VB7QQA|4.0|...seeing number 16-even in this phantasmagoric tale-was fascinating! I have watched it three times! It has just enough historical accuracy to make you wonder, but then....nah! It does have some nice twists and turns. Wonderful cinematography. Worth watching a few times!
B0000696I1|2.0|Finally I'm doing 20 years ago review for Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles III this has been the 1st time I have seen this movie since 93 or 94 seeing it again after so long I don't care for this movie. I don't love it I don't hate it's 1 of those movies I can sit through as a way to pass the time. It does have it's fair share of problems. Made on a budget of $21 million made $42 million it was somewhat of a hit. Directed by Stuard Gillard he has directed mostly Disney TV Movies wow what a great director. He also directed War Games 2 wow again. The movie stars Stuard Wilson as Walker, Paige Turco as April O'Neil, Elias Koteas as Casey Jones &Whit. This time Raphael is played by Matt Hall. Donatello is played by Jim Roposa. Michaelanglo is now played by David Fraser. Leonardo is stil played by Mark Caso. Brian Tochi & Robbie Rist still voice Leonardo & Michaelanglo. Corey Feldman returns to voice Donatello. Tim Kellnher now voices Raphael. James Murry replaces Kevin Clash as Splinter. Henry Hayashi as Kenshin, Vivan Wu as Mitsu, Sub Shimono as Norinaga & Travis A Moon as Yoshi. The story is you have this war going in Japan in the year 1603 meanwhile in the present meanwhile April O'Neil brings some gifts to the turtles 1 of the gifts is a scepter. BTW the costumes & animatronics are sub standard no where near as good as the 1st 2 movies. You go back to 1603 Japan where you're introduced to this guy named Kenshin who doesn't agree with his Father Norinaga who is in this war with a group of resistance fighter. A Weapon's Trader named Walker sells guns & cannon's to help beat the resistance. Kenshin finds this scepter where he is sent to the future & April is sent to the past. Norinaga thinks that April is a withch & has her locked up with this guy named Whit. Meanwhile Michaelanglo gets Casey Jones who doesn't do a<br />d  a  m  n thing in this movie. You have the turtles go back in time to get April & 4 of Norinaga's Honor Gaurds end up i the present. The turtles go to 1603 where they arrive on horse back Michaelanglo can't ride a horse he gets lost he's knocked out by Mitsu the other 3 turtles pose as Norinaga's Honor Gaurd's  get in the castle they find April & release Whit they escape through this storm drain thing. While looking for Michaelanglo they're attacked by Mitsu's Warriors this is a pretty good gfight scene. Raphael uses his Sai to stop Mitsu from firing an arrow. She stops her men from fighting when she sees the turtles look the same as the 1 they got. She takes them to her village where she sees that it's under attack by Walker & he has a fire set in the village there is this little boy named Yoshi who is trapped in 1 of the burning huts. Michaelanglo who has recovered calls Walker Clint Eastwood. Walker escapes not much of a fight scene here. Michaelanglo goes in the burning hut & saves Yoshi I do like the line \\"Kurt Russell eat your heart out.\\" Meanwhile in the present you have Casey Jones doing nothing The Honor Gaurds along with Kenshin are growing impatient & are growing violent so Casey Jones turns on The TV & they watch a hockey games. Raphael becomes friends with Yoshi. Yoshi has the sceptar & gives it to Rahael. Whit reveals that he's working with Walker he has Mitsu at knife point & he wants the sceptar so they have no choice also they want Kenshin back. You get to the finish where the turtles come from under the storm drain they also pull this big gaurd & toss him out of the storm drain they save Mitsu. The turtles go upstairs take down some of Norinaga's gaurds. They find a scorll that has them depicted as acient warriors. Mitsu & Norinaga want a fight to the death Michaelanglo steps in & stops that. They get outside where they battle some samuri's & you do get some good martial arts in this scene at 1st I thought this fight was kind of bad with Leonardo & Norinaga but it's the leader finally taking down a main villain by himself. Walker wants his men to shoot the turtles Whit turns against him is Whit TheLex Luger of this movie or what cause back in the mid to late 90's he always turned his back on his friends at the drop of the hat. Leonardo tells Walker why don't you shoot us. Walker goes to fire a cannon the turtles dunked their heads into their shells. Walker has the sceptar the turtles want it back he throws it off the top of thee castle Walker tries to escape Whit fires a catapult at him Walker falls to his death into the sea. Michaelanglo & Raphael want to stay especially Michaelanglo cause he has a thing for Mitsu. They convince him to go back to their time. They go back to the present & The 4 Honor Gaurds & Kenshin go back to their time Kenshin & Mitsu reunite. That's pretty much the movie I know that I didn't do a good job explaining the plot it isn't much it's run of the mill it felt like some of the actors didn't want to be there imo. The costume's & animatronics are sub par but atleast they are practical I'll give them that. Casey Jones had nothing to do. The villains for the most part are forgettable. Even if they had brought Shredder back I don't think it would be much of a differance cause you would be reusing an enemey for the 3rd time. The is even more of a step down by John Du Prez. The fight scenes are still good as well as the family unit of the turtles are still there. I give them credit for trying to do something different.  Stuart Gillard was not a good choice he seems like a hack. Stuart Wilson is actually pretty good. Elias Koteas felt wasted in both roles he played. Casey Jones had nothing to do & I didn't care for The Whit character. Sab Shimono was mediocore. Same for Henry Hayashi. Vivan Wu was decent. Travis A Moon was alright. The actors that had to play the turtles do a decent job. The voice acting by Brian Tochi  Robbie Rist Corey Feldman & Tim Kellenher is pretty good. James Murry did ok voicing Splinter. Overall an average movie & is a good way to pass the time. I'm sure they have released a box set for The Ninja Turtles movies so if you want to see part III I guess get it cause you would get the other 2 movies. Next 20 years ago review will be a Cop & Half which I am not looking forward to.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I loved this book! I am completely hooked on Christian and Ana. This was a wonderful part two and I can't wait to get to part three! I am curious to find out what happens, holding my breath to see if they Mae it. I would be sorely disappointed if they don't. This book was artfully written. A very fitting next chapter in their loves. Who couldn't fall in love with Christian? He is wonderfully created and I found myself cheering Ana on, supporting her, guiding her to see him, really see him. Thankfully she doe  and becomes that strong woman that he desperately needed. Such a beautiful love story! I am totally hooked!
B003O86FMW|4.0|A very good book. The ending left a need to move on to see how the revolt progress. Would recommend this book to all readers.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|This was the best book I have ever read. I love this book so much. Please read this book it is awesome!
B004HD61KE|5.0|This globe hopping tale keeps the reader holding his breath trying to outwit an ancient secret society. Unlikely teams join forces to save the world from destruction.  The Mormon stuff nearly made me stop, but read on it's fiction and entertaining.
B005BY3XHC|5.0|Excellent reading and the most practical advises for modern days....I loved this book very much and I recommend this book for all.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|What a great game yall have I will have this game forever until I get tired. But I won't .
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book had a big surprise I wasn't expecting! It was gut wrenching & heart felt. I can't wait to read more books by the author.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is soooo awesome I play this game every 3 minutes!!!!!!! if this game was not free on your device I advise you to buy it!!!!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|its really fun and you get to see the emperor's layer for one!you also get to jump on ropes and its never boreing
B0076DELIG|4.0|Had some interesting twists in the story line. It also left the question of why maindehaven was there. Which is good
076790592X|5.0|This book really changed my life. It gave me a whole new out look and taught me to live to the fullest. Everyone really should read this at least once, and MANY more to remind them what really matters in life.
B004EPZ06G|1.0|Absolutely nothing like the first, which was funny.  This was anything but.  Just goes to show that sequels rarely work.
B0052U59F4|1.0|I couldn't stand reading more than a few paragraphs.  After a few minutes I realized this was a complete waste of time.
B0058SN2C2|5.0|I was looking to replace my really old Mary Jane crocs, which I bought and wore for comfort and ease, not style.  I am so happy with this new pair that I want to put them on and never wear anything else again!  The best part is that they are not only SO comfortable, but really cute, too.  I can actually go out in them and they're so versatile, they can be dressed up or down.  My other pair of Crocs ran big, so I wasn't sure what size to get, but I wear a 7, ordered a 7, and they fit fine.  These are my new favorite shoes!
B008S4YZCO|5.0|Its great for kids of all ages!! I have 3 monsters so far,  and the graphics are beautiful!!!! so addictive!! perfect 4 u
B00BSBU4EC|5.0|I saw this in the theater.  I rarely buy DVDs but I had this one on preorder and couldn't wait to get it! Already a favorite and a classic!
B001FXCE46|5.0|I love this album from start to finish!!! This was my first kings of leon cd and so worth it. Amazon cloud made it convenient to make the purchase as usual.
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|Susan Boyle sings like an angel.  This is my favorite CD by far.  I listen to it in the car, in the house.  I listen to it all day long.  I LOVE IT!!!! I hope she produces more albums like this.  Of course, Donny Osmond doesn't hurt to sing with.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I've read all 3 of the Fifty Shades books and number 2 is my favorite.  So, much happens in this book.  I'm just sad that the series is over and doubtful that she will write a 4th book.  I'm also now into who EL James will select as Christian Grey and Ana Steele as cast for the Fifty Shades movie soon to be made.  Can't wait.
B008QE9XD2|1.0|This movie was labeled as a comedy. There was nothing funny about it. Boring more like it. I was sad about how it was made. Johnny Depp has done better movies. When I watch movies, I don't usually skip through chapters to get to the better parts, but this one I had to. It is worse than a sappy chick flick.
B001UN1KVE|5.0|This is a movie you can see over and over and it still makes you laugh. It is a must see for laughter
B009VIZDLI|4.0|fun although at times a not so credible story line but insightful.  My partner and i read it out loud to each other, was fun and had us thinking about our own relationship and how we relate to each other and the aspects of Don and Rosie that we hold.  It was definitely worth a read and i'd recommend it to everyone.  I think it's particularly useful for us to talk more about the differences in people as difference rather than fault, right/wrong, ok/not ok, etc.  This book did that particularly well.
B0066WJLU6|5.0|this app is great! its easy and works. i really like that you can customize the color to make a nice warm light rather than the usual cold led style. i got rid of my old flashlight app and kept this one.
B007MDB548|5.0|was waiting for redbox, blockbuster to rented but never happened , so just buy it and my wife watched couple times 3D pretty good movie
B00BFUC8RC|4.0|Love the physics of this game! Very entertaining and addictive! This is definitely a &quot;just one more time&quot; type of game.
B00AATV046|5.0|It's just not Christmas without the Bishop's Wife and Christmas Carol with Alistair Sims. I love the skating scene, one of the best!
B0063IH60K|5.0|i am a gr-grandmother who dreads new &#34;toys&#34;.  this was easy and is great fun while i wait at my numerous dr. appts.
B005LAIII0|5.0|This movie is a masterpiece. While not for everyone due to the philosophical teachings, I can't get enough of it. Seeing it two times in theaters in 3D, I can't think of a more beautiful movie. The blu-ray is also beautiful, with some good features thrown into the mix. It was a first day purchase for me.
B0083Z6AH6|5.0|Jane Austen never disappoints. Persuasion was a very enjoyable read and had an even more enjoyable price: $0.00<br />There is absolutely no reason to not read this book.
B0068LYEHA|4.0|I am neither a woman, nor do I plan on becomming one, but I really enjoyed Moran's deconstruction of what it means to be a woman. The book is continuously funny, and once I got into the flow of the book, it was hard to put down. Maran doesn't stray from controversial topics, always treating her subjects with great whit and frankness. Definitely recommended.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|I read this book in about 3 days it is better than most of the books out there. Loved it
B009NYF2ES|5.0|This movie looks and sounds great. Cabaret is a classic which reinvented musicals. There are some great special features, but the best part of the package is the film itself.
B0076DELIG|4.0|Michael Connelly has it down, he is consistently entertaining and this novel is no exception. The idea of using the title as an alternative to &#34;key to the puzzle&#34; is interesting.
B00AFEYUVG|5.0|The film lives up to the book. Perfect casting, the chemistry amoung the principle casts members is apart. The film is well paced and packs a powerful emotional punch. The film looks great, especially given its limited budget. There are two commentaries, which I love. Great product.
B003V4AK8E|1.0|I was looking for a slightly larger controller and this one certainly filled that need. However, there is a horrible lag problem.  I simply could not use it.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|Alien and Aliens are both classic films. Alien is a fantastic slow-burn horror/sci-fi film, and Aliens is a perfect sci-fi/action film. Two completely different movies set in the same world, both with great results. The other two films are good, and fun to watch. All films look pretty great across the board. Given the falling prices on this set, it is a must have for any film fan.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|I have told so many folks about this book. It makes understanding communication conflict so simple.  I really enjoyed the easy way the information is given as well as suggested applications.
B007REV4YI|5.0|This movie is a must buy on Blu-ray. There has never been a more beautifully shot Bond film. Thanks to Mendes and Deakins, the film continually thrills with top-notch visuals and camerawork. Thankfully, it is an action movie where the action is not hidden in quick cuts and shaky camera work. Everything about this Bond movie, from the acting, writing, directing, and cinematography showcase the brilliant talent behind the scenes. It's no wonder it is the highest grossing Bond film.
1616550414|5.0|I got the book and love it, it gives great insight into the series as a whole. A must have for all Zelda fans.
B000777J2S|5.0|You will either love or hate this.  Me?  I love it.  It moved me so much that I read everything I could find on his life. This is so much more than just music.  Listen carefully and you will learn something about life's struggles and the courage to accept yourself.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|With the graphics and arcade like gameplay this is one of the best kindle games around and combined with game circle it's guaranteed to give competitive gamers a thrill
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|I spend one evening zipping through the first season, recalling much of the events that brought Kate and Castle together and discovering events I had missed the first time around.  I am a fan.
B002RI9HUM|2.0|im not a big fan of Marian keyes i read her books still dont get what other people do sorry
B004LWZW7Y|4.0|Reeived in great condition. Was entertaining to watch over and over Children of all ages wou.d love it as well as adults
B0055SWM08|5.0|Great game! I even bought the next one! It's so much fun! Especially with the calming music and sound effects
B004EPZ07K|4.0|Received in Great Condition. Entertaining to watch oiver and over again. This kind of video is my favorite genre to watch.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This is a wonderful window into a bygone era, presented boldly, artfully, and with great realism.  We hope it continues for many more years!
B005IZLPKQ|5.0|The videos were received in great condition. Loved watching it. Very entertaining. Would watch it over and over again. This is my favorite of movie.
B006MW3UZW|4.0|I am through about two thirds of season 2 and enjoying it.  A very interesting portrayal of life in the early 1900's in England.
B003MC5N28|5.0|The Giver is an amazing, intriguing book about a Utopian society gone wrong. You have to get it! You have to! Get it now!!!!
B003Y5H574|4.0|As some here have noted, this is almost a great movie.  But it's marred by far too much in the way of crude or simply stupid dialog or events.  The good: most of the interaction between the adults. Cal (Steve Carell) has had only one girlfriend ever (now his wife), whom he met early in high school.  When his marriage hits the skids, Cal has no idea what to do; so he basically hangs out at a bar to drink and complain about his life.  Enter Jacob (Ryan Gosling), a successful bar-scene \\"player\\" who tells Cal that he wants to help him \\"reclaim his manhood\\".  Most of the  interaction between Cal and Jacob, as well as their interaction with other adults, is very well done, and if the movie centered exclusively on this it would be worthy of a 5 star rating.  Now there are some parts of the movie where Jacob takes the \\"manhood\\" thing too far; this straddles the line between humor and poor taste but it doesn't badly harm the movie.  For the most part, the principal actors (Carell, Gosling, Moore, Stone) do an outstanding job; I mainly was interested in this because I enjoy Steve Carell's comic acting, but I must say that Ryan Gosling gives the standout performance here.  The one disappointment among the adults are some of the scenes with Marisa Tomei.  Not her fault, she's great, and still looks fantastic (she's in her late 40's).  But a lot of the lines she's given to say, too vulgar and juvenile for what many would view as a romantic comedy.  It's a shame that her talents are somewhat wasted here.  Kevin Bacon does a decent job, but it's a very small role.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the film tries to cover more bases than adult bar/dating-scene interaction, and a subplot involving Cal's son and babysitter is almost entirely creepy, vulgar, unrealistic, and is not what I would consider to be humorous.  So when the action moves away from the adults to the teenagers, this becomes a far lesser movie than it could have been.  Which is too bad, because the young actors playing those roles seem very talented, they just have bad material to work with.  There's one scene that Cal's son has with his mother's \\"boyfriend\\" (Kevin Bacon) that was well done, and a little of his dialog with Cal is fine too.  But other than that, pretty much every time the son does anything it's a cringe-inducing, vulgar embarrassment.  And not at all realistic; the son is supposed to be one of the smartest in his class, yet he's got a creepy, stalkerish obsession with his babysitter, and he freely and proudly states and/or implies all sorts of vulgarities to various authority figures, who do very little to discipline him.  It doesn't help that Cal's son is short and young-looking even for 13, and the object of his affection is quite a tall (17 year old) girl; this only heightens the creepiness quotient, as it looks more like a young boy relentlessly pursuing an adult woman than one teen being interested in another. And as the movie continues, the babysitter even seems to be caught up in some unrealistic, misguided actions herself (mainly involving nude photos, which are not actually seen by the viewer).  So if you have kids, better make sure they either don't watch the movie or else explain to them that these actions are not only unacceptable, but could make them a major embarrassment to their family and community, and in any event would not succeed as intended.<br /><br />The movie also breaks down toward the end, as perhaps the writer decided to throw in several silly, semi-slapstick, stock plot devices - in order to make this fit the Hollywood \\"comedy forumula\\".  [MINOR SPOILERS AHEAD]. Toward the end we have, in rapid succession: several misunderstandings, a big chase related to the misunderstandings, a bunch of people wanting to do violence to each other (because of the misunderstandings), punches being thrown around, the police arriving on the scene, etc.  Somehow, someone in Hollywood got the idea that violence is funny; it never is, nor should it be.  Then there's the Hollywood cliche' of things going terribly wrong, only to be redeemed by a \\"great speech\\" that makes everyone stand up and cheer.  Yet it's not a great speech here, not a great message or a great ending.  The speech and ending does not ring true to me (yes I realize it's a movie, but still, there has to be some believability), and only compounds the unrealistic vision of \\"romance\\" held by Cal's son.<br /><br />So why four stars?  This is a movie with generous 5 star portions marred by seriously bad/disturbing 1 star elements.  Average those out, and it's a solid 3 star movie.  However, because the good parts here are so strong, I'll assume that the viewer can do their best to ignore the bad parts.  The good parts are definitely worth seeing, so I'm adding a star to the average - to make it 4 stars.  Definitely see this if the main plot interests you, and try to delete the bad parts from your brain as you watch.
1573229725|4.0|Wow. I didn't expect this book to draw me in as intensely as it did. It is so well written that my inklings of what was going to happen were soon turned topsy-turvy. The story is gothic, historical mystery, with a bit of Oliver Twist and lesbianism (nothing very graphic) thrown in. It was a bit out of my comfort zone, but I couldn't put it down.<br /><br />Heroine Susan is an orphan and a fingersmith (thief). She is sent by a man she knows as \\"Gentleman\\" to be a maid to Maud, an odd, innocent young woman cloistered by her uncle. Susan's job is to win Maud's affections for \\"Gentleman\\" so that he can get his hands on Maud's inheritance. The women are put through terrible torments and suffer betrayals, but the story was bold and gripping. The incredible plot twists are deftly done. I found the book refreshingly unique and mind-blowing at the same time.<br /><br />Ms. Waters won the Crime Writers' Association Ellis Peters Historical Award (2002) for this novel and was shortlisted for the Booker and other awards.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Too many ad interuptions.! It is so frustrating to have to wait multiple times for the same ads over and over.  I would gladly pay to get rid of them.  Other than that the graphics are great. very realistic. wish it was easier to earn gems.
B003ASLJO0|5.0|The characters are well developed.  It represents people as they really are and not so &#34;politically correct&#34; to seem  phony.  The setting is real also.  The same thing is happening in my neighborhood with the same ethnic groups.  However, my neighborhood issues will not have such a tidy ending.

B004J4WKUQ|5.0|Possibly the most entertaining book I've ever read. I often find myself skimming over some parts of books that are redundant or slow moving, but this story kept the pace up all the way through. Never a dull moment. An excellent read. I can't wait for more from this author.
B00B4VXQC8|5.0|I already knew I was going to love this item! I used the rest of my Amazon gift card money to pre-order it. I could not wait for it to arrive!! Then I went and saw BON JOVI LIVE IN CONERT!! They played some of there new stuff from the album( as well as all their greatest hits!) and I loved it! Everybody should own this cd( and more).  PS. If you haven't seen them in concert yet, GO DO IT!!!! : ) &#60;3

B004JN1D2I|5.0|If you have seen the show and love it as I do, you must read the books. They are even better than the show and will give greater comprehension of what you have seen.<br />If you have not seen the show but want to watch it, I would suggest reading the books first. They are great!<br />If you haven't seen the show and don't think you want to, start reading the books and you will get sucked in, I'm sure of it! The world and characters are so rich and intricately woven together it is unreal. It is a fascinating story with so many plot twists and character turns you have to read more!
B000JML7EC|4.0|Pirate tales are usual fun and this one certainly is. This story is actual short enough that when Hollywood put it on film, several times in fact over the years, it has not been condensed much. By the same token, one criticism is that the story is not longer. Trying not to spoil anything, but I would have liked a little more about events at the island before the protaganists arrived. Same with the conclusion. also I felt Stevenson tied the story up just a bit too quickly. I really was ready for more when it ended. So I gave 4 out of 5.
B00B2TTVNU|5.0|Valentina used Rachmaninoff's recordings, which do not always coincide with the scores that he edited between 1901 & 1921, as a guideline to her interpretation. The sound is excellent employing Deccas DX2 digital surround sound technology with a perfect balance between piano and orchestra in particular during the 3rd Concerto.<br /><br />  I already have 4 complete sets, along with 35 individual CDs of just the 3rd Concerto alone, yet it is in this particular Concerto that Valentina achieves new heights. In movements 1 & 3 she brings out all the inner melodic lines clearly and distinctly, employing a freshness and spontaneity that makes one feel as if they are hearing the music for the first time.Her 2nd mvmnt is more like the composers interpretation than Horowitz or Olga Kern who include the &#34;mezzo forte&#34; at pg 41 right before &#34;Tempo come prima&#34; giving this mvmnt a powerful focal point (which Valentina and Rachmaninoff's recording omit), yet her account of the 1st mvmnt cadenza may be the greatest rendition this &#34;ossia&#34; cadenza has ever known, rivaling Lazar Berman who for many years has set the standard.The bottom line is if you like Rachmaninoffs interpretation more than his editing (1910), Valentina's performance will not dissappoint.<br /><br />  Her account of the 1st Concerto is also marvelous during the outer movements, with virtuosity comparable to Pletnev and Byron Janis, and an abundance of fresh musical insights. Unfortunately conductor Michael Francis leaves out the triangle in the last movement which is supposed to keep the beat while the piano plays &#34;staccatissimo&#34; (pages 125-142 Boosey & Hawkes orchestral score) so hopefully someday Ashkenazy or Gunther Neuhold will conduct, in which case Valentina's performance would be comparable to the composers account with Ormandy.(Sir Malcolm Sargent went so far as to place the triangle close to the microphone during the 1948 recording session with Benno Moiseiwitsch soloist.)<br /><br />  In the 2nd Concerto, Valentina roles the opening chords of the 1st movement rather than play them simultaneously as written,(see my 3rd comment which explains why) and her second movement is faster than Kissin, Volodos or Lugansky so it may take awhile to get used to.(it took me 4 hearings).On the positive side she begins the beautiful melodies quickly and then gradually slows down, as if to simulate breathing as one talks.The result is an uncanny feeling that the piano itself is actually speaking, especially during the exquisite 2nd movement.A unique, original, and highly unforgettable concept.<br /><br />The 4th Concerto she plays beautifully, with a spontaneity and freshness that transcends criticism, but for some reason conductor Michael Francis ignores many of the fascinating rich orchestral details which make Rachmaninoffs later works so interesting, and with the Rhapsody on a Theme by Paganini, Valentina gives a high voltage performance evoking memories of the composer's performance with her countless expressive insights, melting legato in the exquisite 18th variation, and effortless virtuosity.<br /><br /> The 2CD case these Concertos come in may become somewhat problematic when you try to remove either CD since they are face to face on a single plastic page. Still this set is an excellent buy and remains unsurpassed for those that want the same pianist on all 4 Concertos & the Rhapsody.o, Valentina roles the opening chords of the 1st movement rather than play them simultaneously as written,(see my 3rd comment which explains why) and her second movement is faster than Kissin, Volodos or Lugansky so it may take awhile to get used to.(it took me 4 hearings).On the positive side she begins the beautiful melodies quickly and then gradually slows down, as if to simulate breathing as one talks.The result is an uncanny feeling that the piano itself is actually speaking, especially during the exquisite 2nd movement.A unique, original, and highly unforgettable concept.

B00B6DTWM2|2.0|I love horror flicks and this is a weird one.  didnt make any sense what so-ever...half the film is based in darkness and ethan watching a film about family memebers that were murdered by children that were contolled by this demon.  Not saying it was horrible, but i've seen better horror flicks... I wasnt amazed on how the lighting was as well...for example, ethan is sitting and watching the film and suddenly the lights close through-out the whole house , things seemed to happen to fast.. You keep hearing these good reviews from critics and other people and it really goes to show you that movies are a matter of taste.

The extra material is also great since it shows Sade and her team behind the scenes. Being a private person, this is a rare and good footage of her.

B00BHMF578|4.0|We all know how the story ends, and it ends happily, yet it is told in such a fine way as to make you wonder, and worry, that maybe, just maybe, they won't make it out to safety.  This is an exciting film, yet it is not the best picture of the year.  Those who voted must have felt sorry for the director; they need not have felt sorry.  He is doing just fine.  But this is not the best picture of the year.  But it is fun.

B0094K1QR8|3.0|I watched this to chill out and wanted something funny and light.  It was just 'OK,' and it was my fault for staying with it because it was not engrossing and was more like 'fluff.'  I suppose the younger generation would get more out of it, but it was nearly a waste of time for me as a senior citizen.  It was very predictable and without much impact.  I wouldn't recommend it for anyone wanting a really good film.

0316077054|4.0|When we last left Ethan and Lena in Beautiful Creatures, they had survived what no other couple could- Dark Casters trying to kill Ethan, and Lena making a horrible choice that resulted in her uncle Macon, the only parent she knew, being killed. Now, in Beautiful Darkness, by Kami Garcia and Margaret Stohl, the lives of the supernatural and the mortal in Gatlin continue...<br /><br />Lena has changed. As someone who lost his own mother, Ethan understands what that loss can do, but she won't open up to him at all. With Macon gone, she is floundering. As a Caster, she was supposed to choose light or dark with her sixteenth birthday, but that didn't happen. Lena knows her Claiming is coming up soon, but she is terrified by making the choice, because it means if she chooses Light, all the dark Casters in her family will die, and vice versa. The choice is an impossible one, and Lena is crumbling under the pressure. Who she chooses to help her through it are her Dark caster cousin Ridley (a siren) and someone named John Breed who is dangerous, but Ethan can't figure out what exactly he is- Caster, Incubus, etc.<br /><br />As Lena pulls farther and farther away, Ethan tried harder and harder to find a way to bring her back. Armed with his aunts' stalker cat, Lucille Ball, his best friend, goofy Link, and the new Keeper-in-training, Liv, they enter the Caster world to help Lena. They aren't ready for the dangers that lurk there, though, and are saved by Amma, (Ethan's Caribbean housekeeper who is more warden and mother than housekeeper) and Lena's family, Dark and Light on more than one occasion. When it becomes clear Ethan's mother was tied closer to Macon than any of them had suspected, she starts speaking to him through visions. She helps lead Ethan to the redemption both he and Lena need. But will he get there in time to save the girl he loves even though he can never truly be with her? Is there more to Ethan and his destiny than anyone could have expected?<br /><br />This was an excellent follow-up to the first book. My initial trouble was how long of a gap it was for me between the two books. I had trouble remembering what had happened already, and the author's don't really catch you up. While that is fine if you are reading the books back to back, it would be difficult for anyone waiting for the obligatory year before the next is published. Some information is slowly revealed, but it was too scattered and too vague to truly help. The best solution would have been for me to reread the first book, but with an ever present stack of books staring at me, I couldn't bring myself to do it.<br /><br />I also struggled with Lena's character in this book. She was always conflicted, and Ethan and her together made a doomed, but perfect couple, but I had trouble with how quickly she abandoned him and started using her powers for mischief without thought to the consequences. Ethan had lost his mother, and he was always supportive of Lena. I understood the added pressure she felt, but it was tough to read this book and not dislike her by the end. The bonus, however, was the supporting characters like Ethan's Great Aunts, Amma, and Link. They really broke out in this story and made it not only enjoyable, but fun even! As Amma threatens Link and Ethan, smacks Ethan, and keeps Lena in control, you can't help but adore her. Link is so ridiculous he makes the story lively and will have you giggling. And the Aunts simply speak for themselves! I loved these characters, and truthfully, they made a very long book fly for me.<br /><br />This is a very large book, about 500 pages, similar to the first book. That means, while it is an interesting and fun story, I probably wouldn't suggest it for anyone but a strong reader with a real interest in the supernatural. Otherwise, you might find a student really bogged down by the sheer length of it. The language and content is very mild, with nothing that would make it inappropriate for a student middle school and up. But again, the length would stop me from giving this to many kids. As an adult, though, I really love this story! It might be a good series to give to an adult you know to break them into the YA genre!l and up.

1449305172|1.0|im with the other reviewer who noted that way too many of the reviews on this book happened over a two day period to be real. Looks like someone paid off a company to write their reviews... no proof, but i dont buy this rating for 1 second.

B0099KJFJ4|3.0|Director John Hyams has raised the bar when it comes to low-budget, direct-to-video movies.  His two recent sequels to the seemingly dead \\"Universal Soldier\\" franchise were astoninshingly enjoyable and refreshing, and in my opinion, both were better than the original.  When I read that he'd be giving MMA champion Cung Le (\\"True Legend\\") his first starring role I was pretty excited.  I'd read a lot of mixed reviews about this film before I finally purchased it.  Reviews that mostly griped about the plot and its confusing presentation.  I would agree that some complaints in that department are not without validity but that's hardly what makes or breaks an action film for me.  I look for the action itself, which has been given both praise and criticism by other reviewers.  More on that in paragraph 3.<br /><br />Cung Le plays the silent Hong, a former convict who moves into the gang-infested neighborhood of St. Jude (a New Orleans borough, according to the DVD box) with intentions of cleaning up the streets.  St. Jude is ran by two gangs: the hispanic 6th Street Kings and the all-black Eastsiders.  Both gangs and the police are run by Mr. V (Peter Weller, \\"Naked Lunch\\").  After kicking the crap out of a couple of thugs, Kong slowly earns the respect of the gangs and Mr. V, who eventually hires him to oversee both factions.  Kong allows the gangs to continue operating, albeit with some restrictions on how they treat the locals and who they sell their drugs to.  Life becomes good for both the citizens and the gangsters until Mr. V's large stash of cash comes up missing.  V then hires the Devil Dogs, a group of brutal Russians, whose prior agreement with V was the only thing previously keeping them from taking over St. Jude.<br /><br />Those reviewers critical of the action have made minor mention of the overuse of slow motion and, perhaps, for many of them, it wasn't that big of a deal.  To me, it completely sinks the film.  I don't recall one fight that wasn't completely saturated with it.  Why does this keep happening with filmmakers who ought to know better?  Please stop it!  Stop and think about all the great martial arts scenes on film that have ever excited you and I'll bet that if any of them involved slow motion at all, it was used sparingly.  Unless your favorite fights involved the '90s output of Don \\"The Dragon\\" Wilson.  I'll even give American examples of good ones:  \\"Undisputed 2 & 3\\", \\"The Girl From The Naked Eye\\", \\"Never Back Down 2\\", \\"Blood & Bone\\".  Those are movies with great fight scenes!  All since 2006.  I'll admit that it's convenient to see a kick coming, knowing that I have time to get up, refill a beverage and come back before it's completed, but, ya know what?  I have a pause button on my DVD remote for just such an occasion.<br /><br />Along with Hyams' most recent film, \\"Universal Soldier: Day of Reckoning\\" (also with WAY too much slow motion, thought it works a little better), Jean Claude Van Damme's name is listed at the top of the DVD, clearly indicating a starring role, despite maybe 10 minutes of actual screen time.  Now for me that's not much of a deterrent as I'm not a particular fan of Van Damme.  Oh, there's a handful of his flicks that I enjoy, but deliberate deceipt concerning his involvement is still a risky move considering how many fans the Muscles from Brussels has out there.<br /><br />The DVD from Warner Bros has good picture quality with English as the only spoken language and subtitles available in English, French and Spanish.  This DVD has NO special features, either.  Again, the slow motion may not bother others nearly as much as it bothered me but I cannot recommend it primarily for that reason.  Otherwise the acting's decent and there are quite a few unique touches for a low-budget kick-flick.  Cung Le does a good job and I look forward to seeing him in more flicks.  The leader of the Devil Dogs is played by MMA fighter Trevor Prangley and his film presence needs to be taken advantage of ASAP.  Hyams is still in my cool book but he's on probabtion.  2.5/5<br /><br />2012age of ASAP.  Hyams is still in my cool book but he's on probabtion.  2.5/5<br /><br />2012

B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|Visually enchanting. I would be more interested in gaming if there were more like this. Kind of relaxingly Pac-Man. Pleasant sound effects and ambient music.
B007IK44CK|3.0|I enjoy a popcorn movie simply because it is a popcorn movie. Some that come out know this and go about doing their job to entertain you. Ten their are some that take themselves too seriously, MI: Ghost Protocol is one of them. I just don't know, the action was entertaining enough. Maybe it's the fact that Cruise and most of the cast (except Simon Pegg) just take themselves way too seriously. But hey, it's on Amazon Prime now, so watch it and enjoy the popcorn.
B000SEIK2S|4.0|I'd rank this as a 4-1/2, really.<br /><br />The premise is intriguing; you come to care quite a lot about the characters; the plot carries you along, with just the right degree of suspense for my taste.<br /><br />I believe I've heard it compared to Heinlein's Starship Troopers, and it does have a somewhat similar feel and structure -- but I found it more thoughtful, with more depth of feeling. Like the  soldiers whose story it tells, the book has a certain fundamental maturity.
B00364K6YW|5.0|I had been waiting for this one to come down to a price where I was willing to buy it.  I already had an old copy on tape but wanted a DVD version
B00ADIT8U2|3.0|I thought that this game was too short. But the puzzles were challenging. the graphics were ok. I've seen better. it was similar to lost city but not near as long. I had little problems like when I went to click on something it would take a couple seconds to load the next page I was going to. I think I was spoiled with games like shiver and haunt and even lost city lol But I still think it was worth the money. I had fun playing it
B00005JOA0|5.0|I had seen this on tv years ago and greatly enjoyed it and am happy now to have a copy so I can watch it whenever I want to

B009EEFTMC|2.0|If you are looking for a waiting room time waster,  this is a semi-tolerable HuskerDu in cube form.  There isn't much challenge to the puzzle mode - simply attempting to beat your own time, which cannot be reset.  As far as I can tell, the attack mode cannot be defeated, so what is the point?<br /><br />The colors are pretty garish and the patterns jarring, so this isn't a game to play if you have a headache.  Also the overly chordy, bad elevator music piano &quot;soundtrack&quot;  loops endlessly and drives me so bat-crap crazy by the 3rd time around the mobius strip that I have to shut the sound on my Kindle Fire completely off.  The sound needs an &quot;off&quot; option in the game desperately (my biggest complaint by FAR).<br /><br />Tried this out as FAOTD and for free it was an okay time-waster, but to pay for this, the soundtrack desperately needs to be able to be turned off without muting the entire device.  Or at least change your soundtrack to something more varied and less annoying.  (Classical piano, Baroque chamber music, Tibetan singing bowls, Tantric choirs - - something else PLEASE!!)  Fix this and I would revise my rating to more favorable.<br /><br />I do, however give it two stars for the nice smooth touch controls and gameplay.

0385349947|4.0|By Megan Miller<br />The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are her own.<br /><br />Sheryl Sandberg's \\"Lean In\\" isn't a self-help guide, corporate charter or memoir. The Facebook chief operating officer claims it's not a feminist manifesto, either. It's more of an amalgamation of all these genres. It ranges from intensely personal and insightful to didactic and methodical. Quoted research into how women measure themselves in the workplace and at home underpins a central Sandberg proposition - that women need to be more ambitious and men more accommodating.<br /><br />Of course, she is no ordinary working mother, or ordinary business leader. The overachiever in school and one-time McKinsey consultant joined Facebook in the early days and is now worth hundreds of millions of dollars. That's one reason her volume has stirred such a debate. But this is not a you-can-be-like-me book. Rather, Sandberg says she is dispensing the advice she wished she had received.<br /><br />It isn't really a question of work-life balance. Sallie Krawcheck, among the highest-profile women to make it big on Wall Street, is on record saying there's often no such balance for someone aiming high in their career. Sandberg surely wouldn't disagree. She didn't compromise her career goals much, if at all, for some unattainable idea of having it all. Rather it's a question of the barriers that still exist even after making that choice.<br /><br />One of her main points is that women are too uncomfortable with ambition. They don't want to be called \\"bossy,\\" a term usually reserved for women and never a compliment. They are, she says, often uncomfortable with success, and she is a case study. When Forbes magazine ranked her the fifth most powerful woman in the world, she told well-wishers this was absurd. An assistant pulled her aside to remind her that a simple \\"thank you\\" was more appropriate.<br /><br />Sandberg cites studies of both medical and law students that suggest that women think they have performed less well than men on tests, even when they have actually outperformed. Meanwhile men are often hired on potential while women are chosen on past performance. She calls for a more aggressive approach from women, and for more female networking. She made the same point speaking at Fortune's Most Powerful Women summit.<br /><br />She gives some practical advice, including a taboo-breaking call to put the job before the concerns of pregnancy. \\"Don't leave before you leave,\\" she tells women who might let future children distract them from professional ambition. After all, the cost of childcare should be weighed against future earning power, which will be higher if women keep on pushing.<br /><br />This discussion is in the second half of Sandberg's non-manifesto, which focuses on marriage and motherhood. She offers a contemporary sort of romantic vision, with a male hero who is a true partner and accepts the sacrifices needed for his spouse's meaningful career.<br /><br />It's perhaps easier in Silicon Valley, where reinvented lives and businesses are more common than in some other places. Sandberg's husband relocated his outfit - Survey Monkey - to San Francisco from Portland, Oregon to accommodate her career. Yet it still took Sandberg one failed marriage and about another 10 years to find her exceptional partner. Women have traditionally made such sacrifices routinely, but willing men remain scarce.<br /><br />\\"Lean In\\" ends with a section called \\"Let's Keep Talking.\\" This calls on women to organize their own peer groups to support each other's careers, creating a dialogue and a network of women armed with the knowledge that they are not alone. A community that provides connections to match the old boys' network could indeed provide a lever that might bring more women into positions of influence in business and elsewhere.<br /><br />The debate inspired by Sandberg's book may do its part, too. One participant, coincidentallyor not, is Erin Callan, the former Lehman Brothers finance chief who has kept herself, more or less, secluded from the media since the firm's collapse in 2008. Writing in the New York Times last weekend, she talked about the consequences of having devoted her life to a job that essentially evaporated.<br /><br />It's a different take from Sandberg's. But the more women and men, famous or not, who weigh in and think about it, the more there's a community for others to lean on - or lean into - and awareness among both sexes. Building that understanding might be the most practical legacy of Sandberg's book.<br /><br />[...]f, more or less, secluded from the media since the firm's collapse in 2008.

0307949486|2.0|I expected so much more from this book.  Alas, it is seriously over-hyped.  I read it not so much because of all the press it got, but primarily because one of the owners of a small independent bookstore recommended it when I was on a business trip.  Now I'm worried about the other titles I picked up there (though another one that I have already read was considerably better than this one).<br /><br />This poorly-constructed novel can't quite decide what it is.  Is it a mystery surrounding the disappearance and presumed murder of a member of a major Swedish industrial family?  Is it a story of corporate corruption and the journalists who work to expose it?  Is it a denunciation of violence against women?  It works best as the first, but because in some way it tries to be all three it fails to hold together or even to sustain interest.  After reading 150 pages I decided that you really have to want to get through this thing to stick with it.  And since I did stick with it I guess I did want to get through it--not because I was hooked, but in the belief that it certainly must get better.  But by around page 200 I realized that this was about as exciting as it was going to get.  I kept looking at the gushing blurbs on the cover, and at the \\"#1 National Bestseller\\" reminder displayed on the front cover, and repeatedly asked myself what could account for the book's huge popularity.  If it's not the plot, I thought maybe it was the writing.  But no.  There's nothing special about that, either.  My question still was not answered when I turned the final page.<br /><br />There are many problems with the book.  One is that there are too many irrelevant detours that, even if brief, detract from the flow and can only be seen as either showing off or a lack of focus.  But a more fundamental problem is that Larsson didn't know when to stop.  There are perhaps three endings here.  Was the author really sure what story he was telling?  There is the mysterious disappearance story, and the corporate nastiness story.  And here's the big problem.  The disappearance story is far more interesting, but it effectively ends more than 100 pages before the book does.  The rest is an anti-climactic working out of the other story, with no suspense, no drama, and very little momentum.  Having read that much of the book I felt that I should push on to the end, but there wasn't much of a payoff.  I can't say that I hated the book, because in fact the story of the mysterious disappearance of Harriet Vanger did usually hold my interest, but taken as a whole this unsatisfying book fell flat.  With all the other glowing reviews the book has received (including here on Amazon), I have to conclude that I must have missed something.  But whatever it is--yeah, I missed it.  I don't recommend the book, and I won't be reading the sequels.  Save your time and money and devote them to something else.nd the corporate nastiness story.  And here's the big problem.

It turns on in the hallway as soon as you are in front of it.  (The MAXSA Innovations 40341 motion activated outdoor light I also purchased for the hallway, turns on when your a few inches away).  It works great in my closet too.  I purchased this light to save on my electric bill.  Having a nightlight plugged in at night for the hallway and my children forgetting to turn off the light in the closet was not working for me.  This works fantastic!!  I will be purchasing more for my children's bedroom and bathrooms - it's bright enough that they won't have to turn the light to walk to the bathroom.

B0085Z8F4A|4.0|I've heard less than stellar things about Prometheus (although Claudia Gray seems to like it), but I still wanted to see it.  The trailers were fantastic and I love both Alien and Aliens.  I haven't seen the other films in the series, due to that hearing less than stellar things thing.<br /><br />I think Prometheus had one major problem: it's philosophy isn't that interesting.  There is lots of listening to people talk about why humans were created and what their purpose is which is a question many people care about, but it's irrelevant to reality when the movie is proposing the answer lies with giants in space.  Plus, the scientists have zero evidence for believing the aliens are benevolent creators, rather than people who just happened to visit Earth.  And yet that plot takes up almost half of the movie.<br /><br />Many people forget the pacing of Alien, how long it takes before a facehugger appears and then a guy gets his chest busted open.  The fault in Prometheus is not that the aliens don't appear soon enough, but that what happens before the aliens appear is pseudoscientific nonsense and pseudophilosophical babble.  And Prometheus does improve exponentially once the aliens appear and people start worrying more about survival than the origins of humanity.<br /><br />The casting is fantastic.  Noomi Rapace is beatific and miles away from her fierce, star-making role as Lisbeth Salander.  Michael Fassbender is strangely inhuman and quietly furious at his own creators.  Charlize Theron manages to make herself a plausible villain despite doing nothing truly villainous and being one of the most competent people in the movie.  (Everyone in Prometheus makes at least one dumb, out of character mistake.  Why is the geologist who maps the cave and can pinpoint his coordinates the one who gets lost?)  And Idris Elba is fantastic as always and injects some real personality into the Prometheus's crew.<br /><br />Prometheus could be much, much worse.  But as sci-fi horror goes, it is no Alien.  It does not live up to the promise of its trailer.  However, I can fast forward through the worst babbling scenes to enjoy the true scares the second half of the film delivers.oes, it is no Alien.

Other than mentioning some wet track fundamentals, name-checking Ayerton Senna, and naming his dog after Enzo Ferrari, there isn't much car racing going on.<br /><br />Read this book if you like books and you want to feel wistful and/or contemplative. If you want to read a book about car racing, this isn't it.

B007ZD17XO|2.0|This game is slow to load and crashes often. It also sticks when you are trying to slide the jewels so you loose precious seconds. You only have a minute to get as many as you can so losing a second or two makes a big difference. I also didn't get a sense of completion with each level. It's like you are just getting warmed up and have a good plan when your minute is up. I also don't like the store. It limits what you can buy after each level you get a star but only certain bonuses are available. I do really like the bonus level though. It's a challenge to destroy all the gems in a certain number of moves. I wish the whole game was that. If you like Montezuma 2 this game is not like that. I'd find a different<br />jewel type game to buy.

I wondered whether the airport scene was &#34;enhanced&#34; or true to fact; but it doesn't matter, really.  The cast was excellent.  John Houseman and Alan Arkin deserve the pre-Oscar buzz, but it is a Ben Affleck triumph.  I had almost forgotten how frightening the hostage-taking was, but the movie brought back the country's frustration, fear of reprisal, and burgeoning re-birth of patriotism While justified in their minds, I found it sad that the new powers in Iran adopted the brutality of the deposed Shah.  His long history of abuse and inhumanity needed to be exposed to the world.  Unfortunately, while our leaders had a moment in time to condemn his behavior, they turned their backs and laid the foundation for the existing hatred for the US that fuels Middle Eastern terrorists.  This is an amazing history lesson which should be watched in our schools.

It is incredibly quick-paced and each scene folds into the next seamlessly. Daniel Craig is top notch as Bond, in my opinion the best ever; and Judy Dench is a superb &#34;M.&#34;  Javier Bardeem breaks the mold a bit by adding a touch of pathos to the perquisite sinister bad guy.  I am taking a break so I can watch it for the second time soon!

081297381X|3.0|I read this book one year ago. I liked it very much.  Some books seem to become richer over time.  Each reading brings out subtleties. As I reread \\"The Black Swan,\\" I wonder why I failed to notice the author's bragging, if that is the right word to describe his attitude towards himself.<br /><br />The book opens with a description of life in Lebanon.  I really enjoyed reading about Nassim Taleb's experiences, up to a point.  He describes being accused of attacking a policeman with a slab of concrete. Taleb said he felt \\"a huge satisfaction upon my capture while my friends were scared of both prison and their parents.  We frightened the government so much they granted us amnesty.\\"<br /><br />This is a statement that calls for clarification.  Why would young men be able to frighten the government into amnesty, especially since he describes his friends as being scared? Could Mr. Taleb's feeling of satisfaction, rather than fear, be linked to the fact that his grandfather was the Ministry of the Interior?<br /><br />He writes that due to his experience working in the trading pit, \\"you become numb to insults.\\"  As anyone knows who has looked at Mr. Taleb's Twitter or Facebook page, he is the opposite of numb to insults. How could an intelligent person be quite so blind to themselves? It makes me doubt much of what he writes, especially his advice for living, which is sprinkled throughout the book. If he is as blind to himself as he appears to be, how much value does his other advice have?<br /><br />That said, I did enjoy and learn from the book. The sections that were bothersome are not extensive. It's worth reading, as long as bragging doesn't distract you too much.

B003Y5H5HY|5.0|David Fincher is one of the most visually stylistic filmmakers in the world today and his version of 'The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo' is nothing short of what to expect from this acclaimed director.<br /><br />I think everyone is pretty familiar with the plot of the story, but since these are called \\"reviews\\" I'll just give it to you in a nutshell. Daniel Craig plays Mikael Blomkvist, a journalist for a Swedish magazine named Millennium. After getting into some hot water with a seemingly fabricated story involving a politician, Mikael is called upon by Henrik Vanger to investigate the disappearance of his grandniece Harriet forty years ago. According to police records she is assumed dead but Henrik believes she is still alive. Later Mikael teams up with Lisbeth Salander (played brilliantly by Rooney Mara), a computer hacker with a disturbing past who has a photographic memory and great interest for the case. From there onwards the mystery slowly unravels and the shocking truth is told.<br /><br />Ok now the Blu-Ray comes to us from Sony Pictures and I must say they have done an excellent job with both the picture and the sound quality. The packaging inside is great with both pictures of Daniel Craig and Rooney Mara as their characters amongst the snowy landscape. I highly recommend this Blu-Ray for anyone who loves David Fincher films and for anyone who doesn't mind a little black in their coffee.

B005MW2Z8Q|5.0|This is a perfect album plus.  One of those rare treasures that defy words.  Trust me.  Listen to this album.  They do things that speak to your soul and spirit.  These guys will probably never get rich from their music, but their music has made me rich.<br /><br />I use to think Pink Floyd was the ultimate.  Add another.<br /><br />I always thought that music dead when Pink Floyd, Genesis, Rush and Yes ran out of steam.  But it hasn't.  The discovery a few years ago of Ayreon opened up the flood gates to other like Porcupine Tree, Riverside, The Pineapple Thief, Dream Theater, Phideaux, etc.  Very obscure names in the USA, but not Europe.  I thank the progressive renaissance that has occurred there.
B006MW3UZW|4.0|Fascinating show - dialogue driven, so not really a good choice if you like the blow 'em up movies.. .
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I actually read this book because I saw there was going to be a movie about it.  I really enjoyed reading this book. I read it over my last Christmas break from college. The book intrigued me so much that I finished it within 3 days.<br /><br />This great change of pace from Nicholas Sparks was welcomed with open arms. This wasn't the typical boy meets girl, they fall in love, someone important dies, and then they live happily ever after. This story had so much heartfelt pain and happiness that you couldn't put it down until you have found out why everything was happening.  This story is more along the lines of boy meets extremely damaged girl and somehow she ends up healing him while he heals her.  The book was well written and had so much meaning behind the plot.  This was more than a story it signified that there is hope for those women who are in situations like that.  It is possible to get out of a situation like that and live a happy normal life. Women need that hope.
0062127241|3.0|When I first heard that finally Pete Townshend was going to write his life story I though wow at last!  All my years of wondering, listening, reading pretty much anything he said or recorded was going to be put down in print.  Ok so I can't wait I order the book and as I read thru it, reread passages it started to dawn on me that once again like the title said Who am I?  I still don't know.  A little self-indulgent, a bit of a braggart, really big on scoring with the birds and as it turns a constant balance on being a rock star, husband, father (really not easy either way) To me what this lacks is any unraveling of great Who mysteries, legend, folklore and most of all any really understanding of what was the impetus, Gennis, or at least the creative thoughts that he would put down on vinyl.  Tommy,  Quadrophenia, is pretty much the only albums he goes into any real detail about while ignoring everything from My Generation, to Face Dances (though he did say he thinks it's a pretty good record after all these years).  So little is mentioned about studio dynamics, song ideas and contributions, what a Who recording session was really like and did he ever think his Life House/ Who's Next would still be standing after 40 + years?  I listen to his songs and just would like to know how he ended up writing them, how long it took, how many takes, he spoke about always wanting to leave so Ok he wanted to leave, he has some great solo work but beyond that a book publisher? Editor ?  If this was his true calling then he would have done it. At the end of the day to me this book was dull, vague and pretty unrewarding and let me tell you for me to say this really really hurts.  People will find his story  Amazing and that's great, but I can't say the same. I listened to the Who because they were like me, angry and played with fire, and left no stage standing, I only wish Pete could have put the same in to this book that he put in his songs and when on stage but it really doesn't matter I listen to their music every day, still search for Who treasures and in my own way like to think I'll be a Who fan to the end, heck I didn't die before I got old so maybe someday he'll write part 2.  Now when will John and Rogers's story be  written proper?tter I listen to their music every day, still search for Who treasures and in my own way like to think I'll be a Who fan to the end, heck I didn't die before I got old so maybe someday he'll write part 2.  Now when will John and Rogers's story be  written proper?
B007L3BMGA|5.0|The book is written in a way that won't let you put it down, until you have finished it. Whether a fan or not of the genre, I believe the book is very well written and it very easy to read.
B006LSZECO|4.0|The first half was quite slow, but it picks up and then I wasn't able to put the book down.
B007XKEY6Q|1.0|terrible game. it keeps on telling me that everybody has to many games right now and I know they don't because some of them are my best friends and I looked on their game and they only had two or three games and I have like 15 or less.so my rating is terrible. the worst game ever
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Chris Kyle is a true American Hero having served, sacrificed,& devoted his life to the military in active service. Men like Chris Kyle,are the reason we, the people of the United States are able to enjoy the many freedoms we have in this country.He was a mans man, down to earth.He told you straight up,how things were going to be, & didn't pull any punches.He was a good Father & a good Husband,who loved his Wife & Children very much. He died tragically, trying to help a fellow soldier,in need. We can never forget.... ''Freedom Isn't Free'' !!!
B00BHMF578|4.0|Very well written movie and a believable story line.  Actors chosen were perfect match for the character they portrayed.  Definitely kept you on the edge of your seat.  Made you proud to be an American.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|This an is a true hero.  He loves God, family and country.  He served faithfully all three.  But it takes a hero to tell the truth and about they as they really were.  All the best Chris.  You have my respect and best wishes.  Thanks for loving and serving your country.

B00AEJM6H2|5.0|This is a fun game and it lets you replay each level as many times as you want to try and better your score.
B008D30K7E|5.0|a great read thoroughly enjoyed it  his adventures were  fascinating and  he made me laugh  have recommended to all my friends
B000QRIGLC|4.0|I chose to give this book a rating of four stars, simply because it isn't the most well written book. The story of these brave American soldiers is absolutely amazing and should know by every American citizen in my opinion. I would highly recommend this book to anyone that I come across. Thank you Marcus Luttrell for sharing your experiences with us. I thank all the brave men and women in the military for all that they sacrifice to provide the American people with the freedom that we as a nation have.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I think this games is fun I would play it 24/7if I could you will like this game if you love house's
B008P1EWIM|5.0|If you want the weather with the main features that are clear and easy to read this is a great app. To select several different cities to switch back and forth when you want is simple. A great buy !
B006OCM0G0|5.0|I love this game!it's so much fun it's really interesting I would recommend it to all my friends :) it makes me really happy when I play
0143112724|5.0|I gave this to my grandchildren who have fallen into the trap of Middle School &#34;conversational&#34; English. I cringe every time I hear a sentence begin with ME, but need to keep this to a minimum for fear of being tuned out forever as Granny Scold. The illustrations in this book are so wonderful that if they don't respond to Strunk and White's poetic instruction, the whimsy of Maira Kalman's paintings should make this little book a keeper.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Loved reading this as much as the first 2 books. There's nothing better than reading an exciting and thrilling book with a happy ending.
B005WBBYXO|4.0|I consider myself religious.  I go to church, I believe in my religion and I try to practise my religion to the best of my ability.  I read this series because I heard it was controversial and I happen to be curious as to see what all the fuss is about.  Well, I couldn't see a whole lot of controversy.  I mean, so they try to kill God.  First off, the author's description of God is not as I see God so I didn't connect it to being critical of my religious views.  Secondly, the book is fiction and involved with so many worlds that I simply couldn't understand why people get offended.  Thirdly, I took the series as a fiction novel based on an atheistic viewpoint.  He doesn't share my views but that doesn't mean I can't involve myself with a fantasy world for a few days.<br /><br />If you are the extremely religious type, I encourage you to read this series if only to challenge yourself and look through another's eyes.  If you are not reading this series due to what you have heard, then I encourage you to pick it up and make your own opinion.  I gave this series 4 stars because, while I liked it, it is not a series I would read as much as I would read, say, Harry Potter. :-D
B00785P2QC|4.0|Nice game just got started so no problems yet... wish I could yet investment faster...and I'm just doing this to get one investment..Lol..
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Prepare for a lot of emotions this season, Very well done, but still you might need some tissues to get through a couple of the episodes.
B003E8P9G0|5.0|Great book. Love this author. This was my first book on my Kindle and I loved it. Can't wait to finish series.
B0053O89IS|5.0|Started with season 1 & watched  episodes in batches, each season in order, refreshed my memory about how much I love this story.<br />I like the science, i like having my vocabulary expanded, I love the forensic stuff, and I love the love story embedded in the crime stories.
0375869026|5.0|An easy read as the target audience is young adult, it has been enjoyed by me as well as my adult daughters.  The author gives us several narrators with different perspectives on a difficult subject.
B009G56RN4|1.0|The plot is vague if you can find it.  The music was something to endure, not enjoy.  I had to take a significant break half way through the movie because it is so difficult to listen to the music; at times, I muted the sound.  I watched it to the end hoping the story would have some redeeming value but found none.
0345803485|5.0|I ordered this for my best friend for her birthday and she is a Christian Grey fanatic now too! She said she received it in a timely manner and it was in great condition!
B008VBYN80|5.0|Great for playing in between classes at school since I tend to have around twenty minutes in between. Not too focus intensive, so I don't need to pay a whole lot of attention to what I'm doing.
0307277887|5.0|I love the show Dexter and I love the books even more! The condition was excellent for the price I paid and it arrived in no time!
B000FCKPHG|4.0|A book for you to understand about how you think, why do you keep thinking the same way, possible ways to stop thinking like that and how the world unveils itself after you start putting your mindset at your favor. It's a little too long for these days and repetitive after a while, but I think this is the way she found to put the message in our mind.
0345803493|5.0|I love Christian Grey and my best friend does too now! I ordered the first 2 books for her for christmas and now we are both in love! Great condition and arrived right on time
B00BSBXZDY|1.0|Seemed like a good movie but 20 mins in the Amazon network went down. All my other Internet devices (kindle, iPhone, computer) all had access. So much for our family movie night.
B008MM9630|5.0|Nice game with great graphics and fun characters. I like this game a lot and will share that with others!
B0013D6LEM|5.0|great price and perfect download, not one problem downloading and playing it on my kindle.  Highly recommend everyone using amazon to download kindle music.
B005HED11Y|5.0|The special effects are hokey by today's standards, but it's still a fun, innovative series.  Imaginative story lines, good interaction between the characters - the things that make a series still memorable after all this time.
B0040I09RM|5.0|love watching my prime movies on the big screen.  the kindly comes in handy on the road but nothing better than watching  my free prime tv series on my flat screen no problem setting it up and no problem starting up on my wii.
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|It was great and the graphics are amazing but I have a question. Can u turn<br />It back to normal when u download the dark forest.
B001AFF25W|5.0|Eat that Frog proofs how easy one can make life for oneself, just by practicing the obvious.  Deep down any realistic person knows what to do, but it needs to be spelt out to us in an ordinary manner to, again realize it.
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|I've been getting FAPOD to try out electronic gaming,which I haven't done since my parents disconnected the Atari for a VCR. This game has instructions,so five stars from me because games are not as intuitive as many developers think. Screen tips help make it lots of fun to play. I actually thought about physics! Ability to control speed allows play to be aggressive or mellow and enhances the otherworldly feeling. The graphics and music are beautiful.
1401324649|4.0|I was lent this book by a friend and after reading it you may want to repeat the favour.<br />The book tells the tale of a man who flees an old folks' home - and its matron/warden - on his hundredth birthday. He then steals a suitcase from an obnoxious yob that turns out to be full of drug money. Thereafter he acquires a motley collection of friends - including an elephant - while pursued by gangsters who resemble The Ladykillers in their stunning ineptness at besting the centenarian.<br />Interspersed with the account of his improbable adventures are flashbacks to his even more improbable life including encounters with Franco, Truman, Stalin, Mao, Churchill, the first two Korean Kims, LBJ, De Gaulle, etc., not to mention Einstein's (fictional) illegitimate half-brother who turns out not to be exactly Einstein.<br />History gets stretched just a teensy-weeny bit. If having Truman know about the bomb before FDR died bothers you this isn't your glass of vodka.<br />It will be for most people. The writing style is clear and crisp - especially as it is a translation - and the author has a whimsical, wry sense of humour.<br />It is very much a feel-good story that does just that. It would make ideal holiday or pick-me-up reading.<br />Why the four stars? I assume a default rating of three and work up or down from there. This isn't a masterpiece, not does it pretend to be. It's like a really nice dessert, nothing substantial but very enjoyable.
B008JMKN4Y|2.0|It started out as a good book, but the games these two played with each other wanted me to reach in the book and smack them upside the head.  I guess it has to do with how young they are.
B003730LRY|5.0|This has always been a favorite show for my family and I was tickled when I saw it was free with my Amazon Prime.  It played awesome and was so fun to watch.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book kept me wanting to read more. It kept me in suspense. It helped me cope with my own situations
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Im new to the Downton abbey series but fell in love with it.  I love being able to watch it on my Kindle fire HD.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|I loved the twists and turns  the plot took. I like that all this is new to the main character. It's being told to the reader as  she  herself the discovers the truth.
B008B3GP2A|5.0|Such a great cd.  I bought this for my Kindle fire HD and play it all the time.  Love it
0765325950|1.0|The best thing about this book is that it represents the end of a ridiculously overlong series.  Unfortunately, Sanderson has adopted the worst habits of the original author and his 'contributions' have also been far too lengthy, packed with minutiae and trivia that no one wants to read.  I won't go into details save to say that if you have never read any of the books, then don't bother starting.  This is a great pity considering how good the first 3 books were - around 20 years ago...<br />Sanderson needed a better editor than he had or maybe the publishers wanted to milk this whole series for every last drop.  As a 4 volume series 'Wheel' could have been great.  As it is, it is merely a bloated whale of a series.
B008CPZNL6|5.0|This is such a fun app.  I love the flipping part.  Its really easy to use and set up the things I want to see.  I was able to put National Geographic, Facebook and Pinterest.  So fun and worth the purchase.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|I'm a student, I'm currently doing an internship and I love to cook. Evernote allows me to keep my notes from school organized, as well as recipes I make or want to make. It has been great for making to-do lists for my internships. My only complaint is when I want to print something, I usually copy and paste to word because I don't like the way it formats it.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|This is a great app for one's Kindle Fire HD so that it can keep us informed about the weather. A great idea for those who travel and carry their Kindle Fire HD on their travels...that way we can stay informed about the weather in our travel destinations.
B00A2LOAKI|5.0|great batman movie, it is a good remake of the book... great for any batman fan!  this film has the Joker and Superman need I say more...
B008TRUDAS|5.0|Lake and Will learn quickly thar there is more to lifr than sex and partying. they take responsibility not only for themselves but also their brothers,  Great job.
B00B1E6DEQ|5.0|I've been on Team Biffy for quite a while and have all of their albums, including all the b-sides. I've seen them live a couple of times, and they really do live up to the hype. I love their older stuff and the newer, more slickly produced albums alike, but I think that \\"Opposites\\" has some of Biffy Clyro's best songs yet. It's wide-ranging, emotional, experimental, thoughtful, and challenging. I don't love all of the songs on the double album, but I love most of them and I like the others very much. In fact, there's not a single one I skip over when I play it, which I can't say about their other albums, as much as I love them. The double album format can sometimes drag on a bit, but in this case it opens up a broader experience - the guys clearly put a lot of thought into which songs would be included, and there's no filler here. You can listen to either CD by itself or even the individual songs by themselves, but taken all together, the songs in their intended order make a cohesive whole that's very satisfying. Be aware that the version that seems to be on sale here is NOT the full double album - six songs are missing. If you are a true fan, you'll want to have all of them, so go to the band's website or iTunes or whatever you need to do to get the deluxe version (which also has a DVD with a lot of fun behind-the-scenes footage of the recording, as well as the guys' own words about what this album means to them). The shorter 1-CD edition is still very good, especially if you are a more casual fan or if \\"Black Chandelier\\" is your introduction to the band. It delivers most of the best songs off the double album (notable for their absence are \\"A Girl and His Cat\\" and \\"Little Hospitals\\") and does not feel incomplete (unless you've heard the full version). You will not be disappointed, but if you really like the short form, do yourself a favor and go for the deluxe version too. Then catch them live next time they come through your neck of the woods. It's money well spent.

B001TCHDPS|5.0|A masterpiece.  I am so sorry that I did not know about this artist in the 70's when I was growing up, but I am so glad that I am able to enjoy it now.<br />After watching the movie &#34;searching for sugarman&#34; I fell in love with Rodriguez's music and story.<br />What a fascinating individual.<br />Great music.

B006MW3UZW|5.0|Love Downton Abbey, can't get enough of it.  I actually watched all three seasons on my Kindle Fire, one right after the other. The first two seasons were free through Prime and I had to buy the 3rd season but I was so hooked after the 2nd season there was no way I could go without knowing what happened in the 3rd season.<br /><br />There are a couple of real downers though..one is that season 4 won't start until Jan 2014...what's up with that? And I can't tell you the other downer (season 3) because I don't want to spoil it for you if you decide to watch.  If you love period movies..you will love all three seasons of Downton Abbey. The story line is great, the actors and actresses are awesome and the costumes are fabulous!<br /><br />My son says he doesn't get all the hype...I told him &#34;it's a girl thing&#34;.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This is a great book and very convienant since I could directly down load it to my tablet. I cant wait to finish reading, and continue on to the next books.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Love Pinterest. I can get great ideas for planning birthdays, coming up with meal ideas, home ideas, tattoos, craft ideas.
B007REV4YI|5.0|One of the better 007 movies as of late they brought back some of the more classic feel from some of the older movies.
B00005LAGO|2.0|Flashback to 80s fans. Considering the popularity of Doolittle this didn't appeal to me as much as I thought it would. Unfortunate but true.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|These books are intriguing, and I appreciate that I can read them in no specific order.  That Reacher is consistently good guy
B005LAIGSM|4.0|this movie skipped four or five times i cleaned it and it skips still but it said minor wear or tear. came on time case was great love the movie
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I don't play many video games; usually just Bejeweled &amp; similar puzzle-type games. I love Temple Run 2 though. It's just puzzle-y enough &amp; very fun.
B00364K6YW|5.0|My favorite movie of all time!  Such a great adaptation of the book!!!!  And you will totally fall in love with Mr.Darcy.
B00729GQ0A|4.0|This book was a bit of a surprise to me. I must admit, when I took this book on as a review, it wasn't at the top of my list. I wasn't very hopeful. I was like, \\"Okay, it could be good if the witch element clicks, but there's vampires. And you know how you are about vampires.\\"<br /><br />So I set to the book with low expectations.<br /><br />It blew them out of the park. The book was just a lot of FUN to read! Sophia just has a great voice and I admit I laughed. A lot! I don't think I was supposed to laugh at all the locations I did, but there's just so much pun and pop references that I actually GOT! LOL!! I loved the supporting cast of characters. Sophie was such a blast and I LOVED the Wiccan elements! Ms. Hamilton knocked that right out of the park for me! It was GREAT!<br /><br />All the structural elements were great too! The plot kept the pacing going along quite nicely. Charles was...quite hot and the reason for a lot of the laughter.<br /><br />It's a definite good read!! You should try it out. I will warn you. The reason it only got four dragons was because of the vampires. While they weren't the standard vampires...*shrug*...I'm still a bit burned out over the vampire scene. Dead guys can't be that hot. I mean...mine  wasn't. Granted, I'm sure mine was just off his medication because the man had a pulse, but be that as it may, dead, cold guys are just...dead, cold guys. That's my personal rant and not a rant against the book. Ms. Hamilton did a good job in making me forget for a time that she was telling a story about vampires. So...good job! LOL!<br /><br />I received a free copy of the book in exchange for an honest review.
B003THHIEM|5.0|Love this show!  Perfect cast and interesting mysteries. So glad they've let this romance blossom.  Can't wait to see what happens next.

B001PPLIEG|4.0|After watching Casino Royale, I wasn't sure about the new Bond character. After all, we grew up with him being suave, sophisticated and cool. This Bond is tough, uncouth, violent and dark; as M calls him, a &#34;blunt object&#34;. In this movie, we see a man dealing with the death of his love in the only way he can relate to - revenge. I struggled with this interpretation; even Fleming's Bond in the novels wasn't this cold. However, this movie is the lynch-pin of the series reboot; we see the character reacting with violence and realizing that violence isn't always the answer. We also see him dealing with many of his demons (mostly unsuccessfully) and coming to a newer way of thinking. After watching Skyfall I re-watched all of the Daniel Craig movies and saw the progression of this Bond and saw new life breathed into what had become a cartoon.

B0029LX2LC|5.0|When it comes to Q-Love and the Roots, every CD has to be experienced to be fair. I would rate this an 8/10 as a Roots CD. It is solid well produced. I cannot be impartial because I love everything this great (and underrated) band does. The song on this CD &#34;Dear God&#34; is worth the price of admission. It takes time to ear all the directions, The Roots can take you in, but it is all good. Once you have listened to &#34;Game Theory&#34; and Phrenology&#34;, you like what you hear, you are hooked. Quest-Love, and the boys can take you anywhere, and it is all good, but it is an acquired taste !!
B008JFUUIA|3.0|It is of course aimed at a youthful audience, however the characters and plot are cute and the music is very good.
B003XMWSSY|5.0|I have been writing for about three years and have my 1st book out now.  I can only say I wish I would have read this book and &#34;Self-Editing and Evaluation Checklist&#34; before I every seriously started.  Many of my hard learned lessons are talked about in both of these books.  Also helpful hints were given to help you out of some tight spots.  Websites have been offered that will lead you to communities of readers that will help by giving you much needed feedback on your writing.  This was one of the things I did not have to help me think through my plots and to get feedback on my word choices and my type of writing.  Start answering questions such as do they think I write in an interesting manner?  The First Five Pages will help you prepare for that first professional exposure to an agent or publisher----great help--I reread it at the beginning of the analyzation stage of editing my books, to help tweaking my book to a higher quality.  I believe writing is like a sport of sorts, you need to see a coach or have a watcher check on you don't slip into bad habits.  These two books have become two of those mind checks.
B004MNO0BQ|5.0|Great quality, worth the 99 cents. Has a lot of extra features like different backrounds and pucks.  Great fun with your friends or you could play solo. All around good game and I am pleased. No gllitches.

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book is great. The perfect way to end the series. I loved all three books but I love the way this one ended.
B003TTKB5I|4.0|I enjoy the series but only started watching it 3 years ago.  It's been nice to be able to watch previous seasons for free.  I never completely understood the living arrangements until I saw the first few shows.  It's great being able to watch all the old seasons for free and as I have time.
0385349947|5.0|Sheryl Sandberg is my hero. I desperately needed her to write this book and I didn't even know it until I read it. This is a must read for anyone (men and women) who are working --- not just in business. It will absolutely change your thinking. For women it might help you understand why you're so afraid to succeed... After reading this book I'm no longer afraid I'm now inspired. My father gave me the book on Monday and I finished on Thursday despite working full time and being in an evening MBA program. I've never read a book this quickly --- no other book has spoken to me on so many levels --- no other book has changed my life for the better the way this book has. Thank you Sheryl Sandberg. Thank you for doing what you would do if you weren't afraid...
B004SBS8LA|4.0|This is the first time I have played Angry birds, its addicting.  Lots of different venues and you just want to keep playing
B00BGZ8TVA|5.0|My kids range from 14,11,9 loved it and so did I, great feel good movie! story line was great and direct!
B0094BB4TW|4.0|Does what it is supposed to do, have not had any problems with it as of yet, we will see.
B007N85POS|5.0|My Nephew and his Wife played for quite sometime.  This game was quite entertaining and kept them occupied for at least an hour.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|The colorful screen of flow tubes create great mazes for the gamer to master at multiple levels.  Sound effects and touch  and release mechanism make this game addictive. What else can I say?
B006MW3UZW|5.0|We started watching this because we heard so much about it.  Everyone is right, it is really good! Can't wait for the next season.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love the costumes and the era that is portrayed in this program. I was hooked from the first show
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|We started watching this when we ran out of Poirots.  Now we are hooked.  We can't wait for season 4!
0743270754|5.0|History quickly recedes into the shadows behind us.  The group of men in this book, led by Lincoln, were in the prime of their life during the Civil War, and the youngest of them have been dead for over a century.  Ms. Goodwin's book breathes life back into them.  This is a book of history, but Ms. Goodwin's attention to detail took me right into the character's homes and introduced me to what life was like back in their day.<br />When I started reading this book, my wife (who had just finished an American History class), told me &#34;You know, the Civil War wasn't about freeing the slaves.&#34;  She was right...and she was wrong.  And the real story of how the radical abolitionists and conservative Unionists were both folded into the fledgling Republican party is much more interesting than arguing either side of that coin.  It's clear that Lincoln's opinions on the abolition of slavery &#34;evolved&#34; right up until the time he announced the Emancipation Proclamation.  And I think Lincoln would want you to know that once he made up his mind about emancipation, he never took a step back from it.<br />And there's more...frontier history (when Illinois was the wild west), Civil War history, interpersonal relations, team building, politics, intrigue, plots, victories, failures.  It's quite a read.<br />Even though I knew the end was coming, when it came I found myself moved to tears by the death of a great man who truly led from the heart.<br />He was just an old man on a coin before I read this book, now he's my most loved President of all time.
B001TCHDPS|5.0|This is fabulous - amazing this wasn't famous back in the day.  We have purchased both of his cd's.  WELL worth it!!
1451695195|3.0|I thought the book was well written and interesting on numerous levels. Started to lose me a bit on things such as 'the orb', 'the Earthworms Eye', the Creator, the Om, among other things. I found the story of his family, family history, and doctor stories all very interesting. Still trying to make up my mind on this one; seemed like Dr. Alexander's spiritual journey is a cross between Christianity and Zen Budhism. Worth the read but manage your expectations.
0385720920|5.0|Choke is a excellent book. I love Palahniuk's writing. This book is entertaining to read and there's never a dull moment. I recommend this book to anybody who loves a good satire.
1118156307|4.0|It is a good book for introduction to the subject and it is very well made! it gives examples and also a deepening on the subject in the end witch is awesome.
145150506X|4.0|Reading Poe is oddly refreshing, given that some of his stories can get pretty dark. I love the collection. It's great to sit down with a group and take turns reading the stories.  Poe is a genius of his time!
B004EIZCPM|4.0|Looking for something to watch with my daughter and she chose this.  I secretly rolled my eyes and bit my tongue, but then I was pleasantly surprised.  My husband openly rolled his eyes and got up to leave.  He wandered back in the room a few minutes later and ultimately got sucked in.  That hardly ever happens with him and chick flicks--from him that's practically a standing ovation.  So, while this is not a movie that I would ordinarily choose to watch, I was reasonably entertained.  I was certainly impressed with Emma Stone.  I'd definitely take an interest in any other movie she stars in.  It had a John Hughes-esque vibe to it.  You know, Pretty in Pink, Sixteen Candles, Ferris Bueller.  Not quite up to that standard but in the neighborhood.  I'd recommend giving it a watch.
076790592X|5.0|A Dying man narrating the simple philosophy of life, probably the philosophy of death is more accurate here, that everyone knows but still forget or everyone knows but have never experienced and refuse to do too in this fast moving world. Learn to die. A good read and of course a recommended read too!
B001FVD65O|4.0|With the new Die Hard movie coming out, my husband and I thought we'd refresh our memories.  What a hoot this ridiculous thing is!  I think I enjoyed it more years later than I did when it first came out.  It's silly, it's over the top, it's Bruce Willis.  An equal blend of action and comedy (both intentional and unintentional) made this a satisfying weekend rental.  Just recalibrate your brain, don't think too hard about it, and enjoy the ride.
B00AHTYI5M|4.0|It was a wonderful true story to begin with so that is a strong point first and makes it thought provoking.  The stars like Alan Arkin, Ben Aflfeck,  were great in their roles and John Goodman  was great touch of levity to bring to his role.  Argo was an Oscar winning movie and Ben Afflect was the Oscar winning Director so there is not much left to say.
B00AFEXRME|5.0|Awesome; Denzel at his best! Make sure you shield young viewers from the first five minutes and from some graphic language.
B00AEK9BKQ|4.0|Unbelieveably thought provoking!!  YOu must see this film with an open mind and an open heart for specail needs adults.  Superb acting with Helen Hunt, and William H. Macy.  It is a classy movie but watch the whole movie, don't turn it off because you are put off by it's story line.
B0074YVW1G|5.0|I have been a people manager for years.  This book would have made me a better manager if I had understood introverts years ago.  Very well written and a book that has changed my perception of people forever.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love it!!!!!! It is a fun and exciting game!! It is a must buy APP for ALL horse lovers.
B003PBB4ME|3.0|I order this item to go around with my camcorder trying to avoid shaking, but is made of plastic and if I don't have both hands on it, it shakes a lot when I walk.<br /><br />It get worse when I put weight like a light in the top, something solid like metal would make the job perfect.<br /><br />I don't recommend If you are serious trying to get a good footage.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|This game is fun if you enjoy taking care of animals and entering competitions with them. I would recommend this game.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|Another great book about a true American hero and his entire team involved in Operation Redwing.  I suggest this book to anyone who's a true patriot and enjoys seeing the real stories of what goes on in this conflict we are still in.
B004SJ3AXI|3.0|But Don't do the last scene in Summer unless you don't want to do many more of the scenes in Summer ever again. And the sound cut out so I deleted it.  I hope that when I put it back on my computer, it doesn't' have that problem.
B003VANOFY|5.0|I love this set, great sound, good battery life, nice recharging stand to hold the cord etc.  The speakers and mic both sound good.  I actually returned a set of \\"Afterglow\\" wireless headsets for this pair, and am very happy with my decision.
B003HARV4S|5.0|One of the greatest all time movies (my teen boys love it) and this had the Blu-Ray and DVD inside!  Quick shipment and received as expected.
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|heartbreaking and mesmerizing to watch Dean and Sam come to terms with the introduction of new people in their lives as their roles in each others decision making is reduced.  Plus, Castiel is as awesome as ever.  Jensen Ackles, especially, shines as Dean becomes harder, tougher, more thoughtful upon his return from purgatory.
B009M5CJI0|5.0|That´s what I thought after receiving the product. I had been looking for this book for a while but wasn´t able to find it in any bookstore, but Amazon has plenty of options to choose from.<br />The delivery time was great, really, nothing to say about the product, it´s as described by the seller and the price is reasonable. I hope I enjoy it as I enjoyed the process of buying it.
B001IT29FG|5.0|Arrived on time, appeared just as I expected, and even better once opening the package!  This is an essential Talking Heads album for any lover's collection!
B0061S073A|5.0|I love this App, I put it on all our devices. I love that as soon as the device turns on you can set it so that it automatically directs them to the kids place app where you can select what it does and doesn't allow them access to. It has a fun background or you can choose one of your own. You can disable purchasing ability and internet access as well. This is the best program that I have found for us. To get out of the app you have a  4 digit code, the only downside to that is older kids might be tempted to try to &#34;crack the code.&#34; But my little ones love it.
1451624468|5.0|It is very instructive, although I do not agree with a few points like when he extrapolates physiscs theories. The fact the a matematical model is defined from negative infinity to positive infinity, does not mean that it is applicable to all real numbers. For instance, if one plugs in a velocity greater than the speed of light in the theory of relativity, one gets negative numbers for the time. In other words we go back in time. This does not necessarily corresponds to reality. I remember the physiscs professor warning when extrapolating matematical models. He said, as an example, that if one applies the Gauss distribution to the height of the men that went through the phisical in the military draft, one would predict a person as tall as an ant. Having said that, I think it is a great book and definitively I reccommend to anyone to read it, particularly if you have studied projective geometry (The one where  paraller lines meet at infinity because they are represented as semicircles).\\
B001OSIV62|5.0|Very few people have the panache, or even the desire to attempt such a daring feat.  However, when you strip away the danger, the outrageousness, and yes, the illegality of Philippe Petit's walk between the World Trade Center's twin towers, you have wonderful story of dreams, belief, team work, and the courage to face the risk of failure.<br /><br />We all have  our &#34;Wire&#34; where we long to step out and turn our dreams into reality.  And while every dream has an element of risk, Man on Wire, place the risks that many of us face into perspective.<br /><br />Watch it, find your dream, and take that step...
B00684J49U|5.0|It is a must have for any Grey's fans. I really enjoy how this series does a great job building on what has come before in previous episodes.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|I enjoyed this moving from beginning to the end. I forgot about time and space and the worries of day... and became immersed into the imaginal world created by Tolkien. The only fault I can find is that around the middle there was your typically Hollywood gratuitous violence when the characters were escaping from the goblin tunnels. The only thing I wanted to see more of WAS THE MOVIE. I wish they had created a single movie instead of a trilogy or just come out with all three parts at once. The acting is excellent. The visuals are perfect. I enjoyed this movie so much I think I will watch it again tonight. Break out the popcorn and rent this movie tonight. You will not be sorry.
B006HL9G10|1.0|frustrating to set the timer unless you buy the upgrade... Don't know ....never bought it so I can't say how that would be
B009CUWG06|5.0|came very fast, was well poackaged, and a great savings. The service and processing was faster than expected. Merchant highly recommended.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Enjoyed seeing a lifestyle that otherwise would not be known to most of us. Excellent acting, beautiful setting. Especially liked the connection and kindness between the nobility and the help. Can't wait for season 3 on Amazon!
B0054SMIH6|5.0|I started watching this movie fairly late in the evening thinking that I can watch some and finish it the next night. But I ended up staying up not being able to do anything until the very end of the movie.<br /><br />Plain awesome movie!
B00AREIAI8|3.0|I like that I can buy different horses with coins I can earn.  The graphics are great.  The games are cute but they never change.  I wish the competitions actually involved more variety like in Nintendogs.
B004CES7DM|5.0|Neat action and great dialogue.  Really good special effects mixed with great writing and acting.  It's in my permanent library.
B000FCJZ3G|5.0|Secrets of the millionaire Mind is a MUST read  for anyone trying to better their financial situation.  This book  will teach  you how to overcome the  programming that has lead this country into the financial toilet .  TWO THUMBS UP !!!
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|I have Angry Birds on my Roku and this version for the Kindle Fire is just as fun. I removed it because the ads are very annoying. My grandchildren accidentally clicked on two and ended up on Amazon. I played it last night and got those ads at the end of each game. I can see small ads etc. but this was too much.
B004SRPXWQ|5.0|My grandkids have this on their IPad, I got a kick out of it when I first saw it. After I got my Android I downloaded it for free, everyone I show it to love it.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is so easy to get addicted to!! I got it for my daughter yet find myself playing it just as much as she does!
B004HU6YZ4|5.0|its hard not to like this they do happen to be my favorite band I here it all the time
B00ABGEFWC|4.0|if your child like LPS, they will like this game.  It works great on the Kindle Fire.  and it's FREE
B000MR1V22|5.0|This is one of my top 5 favorites of all time. The story line is amazing and captivating. All of the actors are genius. Alan Arkin cracks me up. I laughed, I cried, then I laughed some more. Each time I watch this movie I come away feeling warm and happy. It makes a person remember that we all have issues in life, but family is the glue that holds us together....no matter how crusty that glue may be.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This is the 3rd book of Colleen Hoover that I've read and I loved all three of them. Hopeless was a tough read because of the sensitivity of the topic. Keep a tissue box in hand. I liked Sky and I loooved Holder. Their intimacy is one of the best I'd ever read.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book was really good, it didn't get boring like I thought it would.  Everyone should read this...I think my husband would even like it!!!
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Fun game that can be played for hours!  highly suggest playing this game and its fun to go back for 3 stars!
B005P1YCNK|5.0|Darren Hardy teaches us how minor changes in our daily habits and thoughts can and will lead to major explosions of success, health and wealth in our daily living!
B00B7G3Y4U|3.0|It was just okay. The excitement didn't build until the middle of the movie. Wasn't as good as the first.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I could not be more pleased. Absolutely flawless performance and I like being able to manage content online. Get it!
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|This game is so awesome! I just absoulutly can not stop playing it!!! Its the same thing as crime city or modern war. Its just so much more.......... awesome.
B009439HEY|3.0|why are there cuts/breaks between songs that don't belong ??? some songs are meant to flow from one song to the next. some songs on this cd have breaks in them where breaks should not be. for example...fly on windshield (cut/break) broadway melody. on original recording there are no breaks (the lamb). on this version there is a break in between songs. this also occurs unquiet slumber (cut/break)quite earth (cut/break)afterglow. this is an audio cd and these songs should not have breaks in them seperating songs !!! this totally ruined the experience for me. i gave it 3 stars because i like the track selection. if anyone else has this problem ,please let me know. i feel like i got a bad copy or someone is selling bootleg copies or copying mp3 and selling them. the first time i played this audio cd in my car, i was shocked. buyer beware.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surf is a great game and I love the Easter egg hunt for Easter overall I love the game and it is addictive.
B005LAIH9A|5.0|I got the movie very fast and it does work. I am happy with what i payed for. Great deal
B0011N1WE8|4.0|Great spin on a classic theme..loved the cast and whole family enjoyed this movie.  Well done, fun, and a movie you can watch again.
B005CRQ4OW|5.0|It was OK. It wasn't the best book I have read it had a lot of suspense I just wanted to keep reading to see what happens next
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|This is an amazing mouse. I love how everything so customizable especially the logo light. The mouse feels good in my hands and I don't really need the extra weights. The performance is pretty good and I also love the programmable buttons. Thank you Anker!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Love the books sad they ended but they were amazingly written can't wait for the movie that will be competing next year
B004EBBPU0|5.0|great movie that tells story of one of rocks beginning starters of poetic lyrics Val Kilmer plays a truly believable role as Jim Morrison a must see for all doors fans
B006X5L6VS|1.0|I bought this for my Kindle Fire believing that it would function as advertised.  That is that you could aim the tablet to the sky and identify heavenly bodies.  Alas it only works with tablets that have a GPS function and the Kindle Fire does not.  Wish I had known in advance.
B0091REZMW|4.0|I like the program and playing the game but it uses a lot of energy and I wasn't playing long and my energy was down to 10% and I had to quit playing for the day.
B00AYHKIZ6|5.0|Although it took ten years for Bowie to create another album, it is well worth the wait.  Reluctant to change his stripes again, Bowie uses much of his last band team of Earl Slick, Gail Ann Dorsey, Sterling Campbell and Producer Tony Visconti.  Allegedly recorded in an intense three month period with the band, Bowie took the demos and took his time to incorporate lyrics and refine each song.  Sometimes Bowie will tell a story or use lyrics in a way to describe an experience, and in this case he also relies on using clever, catchy phrases and musical metaphors.  The result is a lengthy combination of bold, yet baffling segments of songs with thought provoking imagery.  There has always been an odd combination of twisted innocence in Bowies songs and he doesn't fail his fandom here.<br /><br />'The Next Day' makes for a great opener with its quirky, bouncy almost classic Bowie announcement.  The song, 'Valentines Day' has an upbeat feeling for such a dreadful incident of mayhem.  It's also great to hear Bowie still using sassy saxophones, particularly on 'Dirty Boys' and 'I'd Rather Be High' with an occasional, punctual blast of sax.  The latter also contains a nice interweaving of guitar work.<br /><br />Innovative, if not slightly dark, songs like, 'You Feel So Lonely You Could Die' and 'The Stars (Are Out Tonight)' carry the listener on a fast-forward trip of emotion with both lyrics and instrumentals - a pleasant feeling of cerebral wanderlust.  Although not particularly commercial, 'Dancing Out In Space' could easily be a club dance mix with its hip-hop/bebop rhythm and quirky interplay of vocals (listen with headphone on this one).<br /><br />Innovative, creative, fresh and an album that begs for repeated listening, Bowie has created arguably one of the greatest comeback albums in recent rock history.  When the album completes its cycle with, 'I'll Take You There' with the heartfelt lyrics of 'hold my hand and I'll take you there', it almost feels like Ziggy Stardust is screaming, 'gimme your hands' all over again.  But then, that was another Bowie.ardust is screaming, 'gimme your hands' all over again.  But then, that was another Bowie.
1476734941|5.0|I downloaded this book to my Ipad first since it was not available in print. I love this diet so much that I gifted the printed copy to someone else I felt would benefit from this diet
B00846WWVM|5.0|This is one of the more beautiful apps out there. I just love the graphics of this game. And, even with all the fluid water, it runs smoothly and without any lag. This is a different type of game and my only complaint is that I wish it came with a tutorial to get you used to the different controls and ways to do things. But with how much fun and entertainment I get out of this, I can forgive them for this.<br /><br />The levels are challenging. It ran great on my Samsung Galaxy S3. I bet this would look totally awesome on my Fire HD.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Thought this was a great story loved it! Could not put the book down. I would definitely recommend you read this book.
B007Q6XIMI|4.0|I'm a huge Irvine Welsh fan. I've read nearly everything that he has written. I didn't want to finish this book because we may not hear about Renton and Sick Boy again. The book didn't disappoint. There were your humorous stories but there were some very sad moments for these characters.
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|I bought the book thinking it was a horror thriller type book but it turned out to be more of a fantasy type . Even so I did enjoy the plot of the story. The author has a vivid imagination!! I would recommend it!!
B008IJTFYW|5.0|Have been using this for both stress relief through relaxation and as a sleep aid. I love it! The theta waves are amazing and really work for me. And the variety of sounds is a neat way to enhance your mood. Very cool app - and I'm only using the free version!
B00A9T1HUO|3.0|Excellent chorus and orchestra, but Mr. Groban should also invest in people who can write better songs for him. The majority here are mediocre, at best. I'm not sure what he was aiming for by featuring his own songs, but it missed the mark.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This network continues to draw the best writers, directors, and actors in the business. This is supernal writing fleshed out \\"pun intended\\" with amazingly complex characters that carry their trauma with them in their faces with such convincing authenticity it never fails to draw you in. These people are real, tortured, troubled people struggling to keep hope alive. Amazing!
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Close to the more famous jewel game and its free........much fun.<br />I'm a person of a few words so this is all.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This is a fantastic series, and it is so nice that amazon has the episodes available so quickly.  I never have to worry about the dreaded contract negotiations between AMC and my cable provider when I can access the show on amazon!
B00AYHKIZ6|1.0|God this is crap.<br />Ive listened to it - carefully and without distractions. I don't know what these positive reviewers are listening to but this is a struggle!<br />Its not a sing-a-long album that's for sure! Not one (okay maybe one) good song to press \\"repeat\\".<br />I listened to it once, almost twice but its not for me.<br />I think he's over done every song and if this is 10 years work then he needs to go back to the drawing board.<br />Terrible album, terrible.<br />And as for the cover!!! 10 years and that the best he can come up with!!
B005WUHAX8|2.0|The case did not fit well on phone.  It left bubbles under the front cover.  Tried many ways to get the bubbles out, but did not work.  I would not recommend this iphone case.
B004SIP9VA|5.0|This movie speaks to me on many different levels. In the end I really wanted to dance. We have been dancing for three months now. Learning tango (American) and thoroughly enjoying it. A great movie!
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|Enjoyed storyline- watched it with my 3 year old son and he enjoyed it also. Would recommend to others and purchase DVD.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|unique and entertaining to a certain point. it would be good for kids before they have a horse of their own or just to placate them for a while.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is awesome I thought that its cool how there stuff that can help u I like the shoes and my bff luvs it 2 the game was fun!
B008476HBM|5.0|I never get tired of reading this book.  It's easy to read and such a great story.  It is amazing!
B008TRUDAS|5.0|This book is full of heartache, loss, passion, and strength. It has you feeling every emotion from begining to end. In this beautifully written book it shows that through the passion one man has for poetry and its ability to heal through words that even when your life comes crashing down all around you its possible to love and live again. Just a helpful tip.. make sure tissues are on hand you will need them! Oh and also purchase book #2 when you buy this one because you will want to pick right back up where this one left off trust me!! :)
B002PEP4SC|5.0|If you like the TV show, you will love the book! Looking forward to the other books. So fast paced..
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|This book put me in my father's B-17 cockpit. I have even a greater respect for the amazing brave airman, both sides. This is a wonderful book.
B000002VMD|5.0|I am glad that I purchased The Bodyguard, The Original Soundtract Album.  I have been putting off getting this CD but since Whitney Houston is no longer with us on  this earth, I will always have her in my music collection
B00942G4UA|3.0|While I found a lot of the information interesting and learned some new things, I felt the movie tried to cover to many areas in the amount of time given. Trying to cover all aspects of the food industry in an hour and a half really didn't even provide enough information to allow further research.
B009J2VR3Y|5.0|I am happy that I order this Cd, I will Always Love You- The Best Of Whitney Houston.  Since she is gone from this life, I will always have her wonderful music.
B009IRVSVQ|1.0|To say that my wife is a big fan of Mars is a definite understatement.  She dragged meto his concerts everytime he was within 300 miles of ATL (which wasn't often but I digress).  I really grew to appreciate his first album so much that I bought a copy for my car as my wife would not loan me her Pre-Ordered copy lest I forget to put it back in her car immediately.  Anyway, what made D & S good in my eyes was good lyrics, hooks and musicianship.  And his concerts are an entertaining treat as well.  Mars might have a career in acting/comedy if this music thing get old.  Heck, I could even let the kids listen to his music as it was generally positive or at least relatively harmless compared to the tripe found all over the airwaves these days.  Then there was Unorthodox Jukebox. What happened?  Explicit lyrics, tired melodies (FYI Bruno: too many \\"ooohs\\" can spoil the lyrical cake Bruno), and overtly sexual rather than sexy/sensual messages in the music literally had us reaching for the eject button on the CD halfway through the disk!  Instead we skipped ahead and well by the end, that was all she wrote.  It's not just that this sophomore effort fell into the usual trap of regurgitating the freshman success (it didn't although that would have been a minor disappointment rather than a FAIL), but it almost sounds as if Bruno Mars went through some sort of drug and sex crazed conversion which effectively turned him into well, everybody else.  What made him unique and special has been completely subverted by what appears to be a complete \\"selling out\\" to the amoral machine that is most of the pop music industry these days.  Mars is a talented musician and a decent writer who crafty catchy songs that while may not have been universally liked, were imminently listenable songs that you found yourself singing along to with both your kids and wife/girlfriend.  It was music we could enjoy together.  Not sure who the audience was for this album, but it's a fair bet that most of those garnered by the first album will be turned off by this.  There was only one song, not Locked out of Heaven, that I kind of liked but the fact that I can't remember it because it wasn't good enough to make me want to keep the CD in the player or rip the one song to a compiliation is a telling indictment indeed.  Sorry Bruno.  I will listen to the next album you make before deciding whether to purchase.  That I do out of appreciation for the fine work you did in the first album, but your brand has definitely been tarnished severely in the eyes of our family.  I donated this CD to the recycle bin.
B0064T6LV8|2.0|This game crashes terribly on my android tablet. Wish they'd do an update that fixes this problem.  Btw, I purchased the paid version.
0143123165|1.0|Despite this book being wrapped in shrink wrap, there is an ISBN sticker under the shrink wrap on the back cover of the book (which sort of defeats the purpose of the wrap to protect the book).  And it's not one of those 'easy peel' stickers.  It won't come off, and even on the part that did, it left that sticky residue.  So if you're a picky book collector looking for a nice edition of P&P, this isn't it.  I was very disappointed, because this cover is a nice smooth sort of faux leather.  Yet they put a sticker on it.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I couldn't put the book down! A book like this is everything you want in a romance novel. Try it you'll like it!
0812550706|5.0|I first read this book a long time ago. Reread it and decided my voracious reader granddaughter might enjoy it so I loaned it to her to keep and still need a copy of my own.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|This game is a great racing game. I wish though they would add a multiplayer option so I could race other people.
0812550757|5.0|This will be a reread for I read it when it was first writer but since he came along and wrote another book that is chronologically moved into the second book slot I am saving it for later.
B008KZVNFS|1.0|The DVD would not play in my Blue Ray player. There is no indication as to why it would not play as it is an american DVD not one from the United Kingdom.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|Great cast, imaginative plots and great storytelling. Watching the whole show in order and loving it. Now I see why everyone else was buzzing about this show!!
B007HACDLK|4.0|Another great Mitch Rapp book!  Nice how it brought in the real issues of Afghanistan and Pakistan and wrapped them into the story.
B004WGIXX4|3.0|This movie was just okay, not terrible.  There were a few moments that were truly enjoyable, but for the most part it was a cookiecutter romantic comedy.
B000W93CHC|4.0|This is a good book - but not GREAT book- by Ken Follett standards. The predecessor, Pillars of the Earth, had a certain magic to it, that this book just doesn't have.  On the other hand, it is an enjoyable plot with some likeable characters. Just not a page-turner.
0425252868|5.0|This was a gift for my brother and he's a huge WWII buff. This book is such an incredible and personal story that really stands out in this era. He read it immediately after I gave it to him and we've had some interesting discussions about it. I'm glad he's enjoyed it so much and I've really enjoyed speaking with him about it.
0307593525|4.0|I haven't tried any recipes yet, but enjoy reading these volumes as culinary follow up to a trip to France.  I was considered trying one recipe with a gift of beef, but plans were way-layed when the ingredients started calling for things like veal knuckles and pig ears.
B007PVHAN2|5.0|This has got to be one of the best music / life documentaries I have ever seen.  Because of this DVD, I am now a super fan of Bob Marley's music...not only because of the music, but because of his message and what he accomplished in (for) the world.
B000YDCFRE|4.0|This is a good light boot.<br />It is a sharp looking boot to wear casually. But, it is not isolated or rugged.<br />It does provide all the quality of a timberland boot, but I would not recommend for use working or for serious hiking.
B009X2CUYA|5.0|This book was very well written and I couldn't put the book down once I started it. I have recommended it to many people.
B004S3MB2U|5.0|I often need access to a calculator in my job.  Most typically this is for the same reason that our parent's desks had adding machines. At the same time, I am an engineer, and the advanced functions on this calculator are well implemented and what sets it apart from others
B009X2CRMK|5.0|I totally related to this book as it was set partly in Brisbane, Australia for some of it. As I am from Brisbane this was great for me.
B00AEFXKOO|4.0|This is the classic Braveheart movie we all know and love, but we all must consider that movies back in the 90's can't be digitally enhanced into the jaw dropping graphics that we've come to expect in this decade.<br /><br />I recommend the blu-ray version only if you are starting a new modern movie collection, the DVD version is maybe a bit less sharp but the film itself is and always will be classic regardless of its format.
B009A87ZQU|5.0|Probably my favorite Bond movie. Kept me on the edge of my seat and interested. Gave a different image of Mr. Bond than the typical movies, but this was good.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Excellent television but even better on prime without as many commercials.  Reminded me of the simple tv days but even better.
B007REV4YI|3.0|I watched it at about 10:00 pm...It's the first Bond movie that I ever fell asleep watching. Not as good as other Bond movies.
B00AZ3027I|5.0|Peter pan is a wonderful Disney movie classic. Definitely a movie to have in your Disney collection or movie library.
B00A8ECU24|1.0|This is a cute game and my daughter loved it - the two times I let her play it.  Then I noticed several charges to my bank account directly related to this game.  Apparently there are things the child can click on that can be \\"bought\\" with just a simple click.  After losing $40 and a call to Amazon to figure out what the charges were from this app was immediately deleted from my Kindle.
B0060CTLOI|5.0|Hercules is a great classic movie and a must to have in your library. One of the great disney classics.
0880796863|5.0|everything about this deck is awesome, the art and the vibe is just perfect, love it, I highly recommend this deck.......
B005HNMPBM|5.0|Loved x-men first class. One of my favorite movies - action packed, funny, and great plot. Good for any x-men or marvel fan.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Refreshingly new and different, this read opens your mind to the realities around us but with a sentimental side. Very fast read...too fast.
B006OE7XM4|5.0|I love Gregory Porter CD.  I saw this video on You tube then I bought the CD.  I play this CD over and over as I drive in my car.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This was an excellent read. Once I started reading I couldn't stop. The story moves along at breakneck speed and leaves you wanting more. Can't wait to read the next one in the series.
B004RQVVGU|5.0|I am happy with this release as the live material is \\"new\\" even if it is the same songs as the Tribute album. I found the sound quality to be excellent possibly a slight step down from Tribute but Ozzy's vocals and Randy's guitar both sound incredible! Ozzy in partcular has his raspy strong voice going full force! I saw other complaints about the fact that there is not new material but there are differences in these songs and I found the listen completely refreshing. I have not had a chance to listen to the entire remastered Diary disc but it sounds fine to me and I'm sure it is an improvement over the original and the horrid 2002 release which is still unforgiveable (Sharon you bitch!!!) One last note on remasters, they should never mess with fade outs or things of that nature and should leave the music EXACTLY as recorded and simply clean it up as best they can. I have not listened to S.A.T.O. but heard that they messed with the slow fade out guitar solo. That would probably be my only complaint, still a minor one, and I highly recommend this for the new live material.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I thought this game was awesome my friend showed me this game on her kindle fire and I just had to get it it's awesome and fun and so fun.you should get it but I can't find subway surfer rio
B00AHXIC50|5.0|I have wanted to get this for a while now. I am so upset that I waited so long. I absolutely LOVE this album.  Bruno Mars is awesome.
B00A8ECU24|3.0|It's an ok game, if you don't count the bugs such as the friend system on kindle fire doesn't work, and there only 4 mini games to play, one of them being offered once a day. And of course, if you are not patient, you have to spend money to go forward. I mean some people who chose not to spend money, wait for 6 months to pass a quest. The friend system was faulty even before it went down. You couldn't visit your friends, it would just kicked you out of the game. Again, that's for kindle fire. Anyway, if you are curious, you can try it, and if you don't like it, you can always delete it.
B004GHNIRK|3.0|Too much history for me I'd prefer the movie script and did love it.  I would recommend to History Buffs.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|Wakes me up. I would recommend.  It works great for me, a simple easy application.  Just what I was looking for!
B00BSBT8M6|4.0|Disappointed beccause of all the hype. Expected more.<br /><br />Acting & special effects excellent<br /><br />I'd reccomend it to all children between the ages of 6 to 90.
B00AFROVQC|5.0|I'm not one to post reviews, but I just had to because these books are that good.<br />I started reading 2 weeks ago and have finished all 3 books. Can't wait for the 4th one! :)<br /><br />If you're into the Lord of the Ring and Harry Potter, I suspect you will like this. It has elements of each of those books within it.<br />As others have stated, there are spelling/grammar mistakes, but they are so minor that it doesn't take away from the story.
B00AH8FTT2|5.0|While it was a bit slow at the start of the book, the tension and interest built to the end.  Can't wait for the next book in the series.
B000X1Z0BU|2.0|Not my cup of tea. I did like the music in it but that was about it. Hard to watch if you really are not into it.
B00006L7XQ|5.0|This cd is great! I like that Johnny Cash was able to do some really good cover songs and do them so well. I don't think you will be disappointed with this purchase.
B004KBSQOW|5.0|love it - already recommended it to a friend who also ordered one...!!! really, really love it, love it, love it...!!!
B0017V7GTY|5.0|Music is great. Heard it at my local hot topic store and fell in love. Made my playlist. It is my driving CD. I have it in my car.-
B0055PGUYU|5.0|This book was on the Wired best read list for 2012. There's been a lot said and written about developing habits. This puts into practical perspective the necessity to develop the business habits of execution in order to get the right things done.
034580404X|4.0|Bought these for my daughter age 23. She loved them so much she read all of them within one week .
B008B3H4VQ|5.0|I love this band above all! It's great to see the band mature with each subsequent release. They just rock!
B0065SQ960|5.0|This album was born to be remixed. This artist was born to be remixed. Le petit peu de la musique rocked my socks!
B0089LOKHG|3.0|I'm sad that so many issues went unanswered , did Lena pick alex? What about Hana? Does anyone know what happens?
B0018CWEZ8|5.0|Looks great on bluray.  You can find all of the seasons for pretty cheap now!  Watch this if you need a good brain cramp.
B0066WJLU6|5.0|It's very bright and with it on my home page where my thumb lands, it's a perfect late night safety light. For walking to my car and getting the key in the lock, quickly.
0810993139|5.0|I gave this book to my grand- daughter, and she love it. I would recommend it to any child, good reading material.
B005C0DHEY|1.0|This film is deceiving people about what Hydraulic Fracturing is about. Fracking is safe if performed correctly. The video shown about methane in the water is not new and is not relevant to fracking. The water with methane had nothing to do with fracking. Methane can naturally be released from water wells.
B008476HBM|5.0|Mr. Darcy is my favorite romantic character of all time. Ever since I first read, and not watched the movie which I never sat through, the book of which I am currently reviewing. All the natural romance of the 1700s, and the best part is that there are no sparkling vampires. (No offense to Twilight fans.... vampires just shouldn't sparkle)
B00594XOZU|5.0|It's fast and easy to use...... since I'm on my kindle fire hd most of the time I got it to text and its faster then my phone...... and u can share pics..... great app and I recommend it for everyone...... So get it!!!!<br /><br />...
B009346RSS|5.0|I used this to connect to my Apple TV via optical output (and yes, the Apple TV sends an HDMI and optical output at the same time with no lag) to a set of Audioengine speakers... Perfect solution and iphone/ipad is now my controller and player for audio and video....
0385349947|4.0|I really enjoyed this book and despite the title I think it is valuable for just about everyone, even for single men. While the situations and stereotypes may be more endemic for women, I know of many men (including some in my own family) who have self doubt, don't sit at the table and avoid challenging assignments because they are comfortable and worry about planning for the future family. The many other lessons in the book are largely gender neutral in terms of what defines real mentoring and problems with gender stereotypes and discussing the whole issue.<br /><br />The combination of data and personal anecdotes makes the main text incredibly engaging and a quick, enjoyable read. It is a bit painful to read through the notes though; made me wish for footnotes rather than endnotes though I guess sidebars might disturb the flow for other people who don't want the backing information. I found the author incredibly likable in her prose which helps as well.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|After hearing about this series we decided to watch and see if we like it.  Went to Netflix to watch season 1 from the beginning.  After the first episode we were hooked.  We blew through the first season in just a few days. But oh, the disappointment when we found that they didn't have season 2 . . . so we bought it through Amazon.  Really like this show!  Now for season 3.
B001UV4XFG|5.0|Great movie. Loved going to the theater to see them but really love having them to watch when I want.
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|Good to see them back highly underrated show, hear they're lined up for season 9 and hopefully season 10 too.
B007FC3AAI|5.0|All of the Twilight movies are great movies. Breaking Dawn 1 and 2 are the best of the Twilight Saga.
1419705849|5.0|I bought this for my son because he has read every single book in the series. He is 14 and read it in one sitting! Better than him on the XBOX all night!
B007REV4YI|5.0|Another finely filmed  Bond. Cinematography was well done and I enjoyed this movie. Recommend this movie to family and friends.
B0066W1AZK|5.0|Chess is chess, right?  That is true until you face picking a chess app for your kid who is just starting to play.  &#34;Chess free&#34; delivered the two main things I was looking for:  an easy level that is not frustratingly challenging and no &#34;hint&#34; button (to force the child to play as oppose to get a free lunch by pressing it repeatedly). I can't speak for the more difficult levels, but I've got what I wanted, so it's five stars from me.
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|This game is a fun and challenging game. the graphics and colors are beautiful. I would reccomend this game to anyone who loves match 3 games.
1471100480|2.0|I know it is nigh on sacrilegious to say so and I promise to do penance for this, but I really think I liked the film adaptation of Stephen Chbosky's The Perks of Being a Wallflower better than the book. I know, I know, I promise I'll copy ten pages from Webster's Dictionary as soon as I finish this review.<br /><br />Admittedly I fell for the hype surrounding this piece. No less than ninety-nine of my Goodreads friends have Perks on their shelves as I type. Twenty-nine of them, the majority of those who've actually read it, have given it four or five star ratings. Now I'm not knockin' anyone's taste in literature here, just illustrating why I felt this one would be a slam dunk. Yet, here I stand, the ball having ricocheted off the back board instead of catching the net.<br /><br />Though I liked Charlie, Sam and Patrick, I couldn't relate to them. Maybe if I'd read this in high school I would have appreciated it more, but being a married mother of two I just couldn't rouse much enthusiasm for this piece. Or maybe it was the fact that I knew where the story would take me and felt the material came across better visually than it did in print. Or maybe I just have a problem with the journal like style in which the book is written.<br /><br />Noteworthy for its mature themes and edgy concepts, not bad, but not for me.
B001BR5NN0|4.0|Love to remember all of the insecurities we felt as teens and am grateful to have survived that time of our lives.  Although there's an 80's bent to the music and the character's outfits, the theme is timeless.  Our 15-year old daughter likes it, too.
B008YKGQR4|5.0|this is a app like no other soon as I seen dis app I Wang to see how it wld pull up so I truer it out dis is a really great app
B001AQO3QA|5.0|It had been years since I've watched any of the \\"Alien\\" movies so grabbing this set at a great price on Amazon made my day. I thought the studio did a great job at maintaining the integrity of the original film while ensuring top notch quality for this blu-ray release. I'm a sucker for bonus features and the interviews/making of's did not disappoint. They offer great insight into the design elements of all the films as well as some of the technical hurdles that were overcome to bring one of the coolest monster designs (IMO) to life. There's a reason this anthology is on most \\"must have blu-ray\\" lists.
B00BEPVAV8|4.0|nice graphics, easy to play, fun music. What's not to like? A little difficult to get the tilt steering correct but I just started playing. I assume I will improve.
B00992CF6W|4.0|it's not as cool as the Pc but it's still boss! so I think that if you don't have this game already you should get it!
0811729117|3.0|OK book, would have liked more detailed accounts of actual combat. Mostly focused on the wide overviews of the battle.
B003ITZBVS|5.0|One of the greatest DC storylines brought to life through animation.  This film looks beautiful, has a great voice cast, and it's a good price.  Highly recommend this film.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|See I'm a savvy shopper and when I found this for my daughter her eyes lit up when she saw it and I Rate it 5 stars!
B004XCUEU2|5.0|Foo Fighters are my favorite band and one of my dad's favorite bands, so I decided to get this for him for his birthday.  Band members and friends tell the story of the Foo Fighters, great behind the music interviews.  Plus it has plenty of your favorite hits throughout the film, and ends beautifully with Wasting Light performed live.  Anyone that loves Foo Fighters should own this.
B008CJ0KI8|5.0|I'm an old white guy who isn't interested in the LA \\"scene\\" and who has only a passing interest in R&B music.  But, I saw all the hype about this album and listened on Spotify.  Turns out I was hooked.  This is a beautifully produced, complexly layered, completely integrated album--it holds together, but each song is distinct.  It gets better with each listen.
B000WMEAKC|5.0|This album is downright amazing. I'm loving every song, and can't stop listening to it (I'm listening to it as I write this review). Each song feels unique (except one or two that seem similar, but what can you expect) but still similar enough to feel related. My personal favorites are Mercy, All Fall Down, All We Are an Prodigal. Download (or order) this album now, you won't be disappointed.
1439190275|5.0|Book arrived in timely fashion, actually faster than expected. In great condition. No torn pages or wear and tear noticeable. I would recommend this seller to anyone seeking paperback books or books in general.<br /><br />Content inside book is for persons wanting guidance to a healthier eating style for a lifetime and awareness of sugar intake. It's low carb and full of tips to achieve ideal weight and how to maintain the weight after accomplishing your desired weight loss. The guidance and tips are helpful and logical. Nothing tough about this change in planning out a person's day. The eating change does not leave one alone and wondering after losing weight. Actually it is not a diet but a way to change you daily intake of food in a fact-based and sensible manner. My husband has just been diagnosed with diabetes 2 and this life-changing book has been much helpful in planning and maintaining his sugar levels. A must for anyone who is diabetic. BUT check with your doctor first and foremost.
B005LAIGPU|5.0|I've this this a hundred times and love it.  The effects are great and the concept is interesting.  I also like the cinematography.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|The sex actually gets boring after half the book.  Frustrating because I know eventually she will end up with him.
B003VANOFY|5.0|Great sound/ love the padded ears/ works hours wireless /controls r easy to set up /  wish it came with manual instesd o f having to go online to download
B000I3PERS|5.0|I watched this movie movie when I was 10 now watching it 8 years later I understand the movie now and it has a big impact on me it's just amazing I love it
B00A7ZWUJC|1.0|Only one good song on the album, the rest is junk beats... Dull like a rock is more like it.
0596009208|4.0|Like this book because of friendly design, easy use and reasonable price. As beginners to JAVA we really benefit a lot from this book. Shipped soon with good package. Thank you and we recommended more people to purchase that again!
0553805371|5.0|I would recommend this product. The content is amazingly eye opening and it reminds me of Einstein with his relativity theory. Aside from the book, the service was great. I got the book by the expected date and it was in perfect condition. I'm glad that I was able to find this book here at Amazon because no one local had the book in stock. It was all special order and wait about a week or two.
1466208686|5.0|Cracking the Coding Interview: 150 Programming Questions and Solutions is a good deal. It can be very useful for you to prepare interviews for job-hunting. Design is nice and easy-going. Take it as I recommended!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game is very addictive and I love playing on it and challenging friends.The only downfall is that it doesn't show enough information so may be quite hard to learn more.
B008I3RARW|4.0|Right of the bat. this is a &quot;arcade&quot; game. not story. It is graphics wise fairly good. It has spark effects and decent physics. but the controls need tweeking ang there is only one track. but weather effects are great. but its not worth $4.99, more like &cent;99.
B008220DIC|4.0|\\"How could \\"Argo\\" possibly have won best picture?\\", I thought after watching this.  Sure, \\"Argo\\" proceeds at a break-neck pace and gets everything right, but \\"The Master\\" is Cinema with a capital C.  Fifty years from now, no one will be watching \\"Argo\\" or any of the other films coming out, but \\"The Master\\" feels like it will endure forever.  Speaking of forever:  The Cause at the heart of the film borrows a page from Scientology to posit that our souls were born trillions of years ago, only to be trapped into human bodies by aliens (I think).  \\"This is something you're in for a billion years or not at all,\\" Amy Adams-- the master's brilliantly humorless consort-- sneers at one point.  The dichotomy between our longing for freedom and our need for love and belonging, between loneliness and tyranny, is at the heart of the film.  \\"If you figure a way to live without serving a master, then let the rest of us know... for you'll be the first person in the history of the world,\\" L. Ron Hubbard (or Jim Jones-- pick any of your favorite American religious entrepreneurs), played by Philip Seymour Hoffman, tells the protagonist (Joaquin Phoenix).  Joaquin plays a WWII veteran, broken in body and mind; really, the only part of him to have survived intact is his eternal soul.  He is at once intensely human and sympathetic and absolutely terrifying, a loose cannon capable of any madness.<br /><br />The lack of certainty and direction is both this film's great strength and its weakness.  As with the films of Terrence Malick, the cinematography is so gorgeous as to overshadow the script.  What matters isn't the rather confusing plot but how you feel watching it, which is to say intensely alive.
B004X1U7DM|5.0|Great spiritual music for those that are looking for other than Christian, Muslim, or Hindu. Awesome for those that follow the Red Road.
B0097VS7ZS|5.0|Love to take it to Church on Sundays.  My Granddaughters love to take turns coloring the different pictures and it keeps them quiet/
B0050SYS5A|5.0|I have a little room where I can play my X-box with Kinect. The Zoom made play so much better. The system can now see my whole body instead of just half. It was really worth the money to fully enjoy my games.
B004L07KWQ|5.0|My grandkids love it in church it is quiet and easy to handle.  This has stopped me carring the color book and crayons every Sunday
B0034G4OYA|5.0|Itwas a Birthday gift for my grandaugther ad she enjoyed it as well as her sister. And she wil get more for Christmas
B004X6PRO6|1.0|When I began this book, I looked forward to what I would learn about North Korea.  What I got instead was the dark ugly world the author created, which may or may not bear resemblance to actual lives of North Koreans.  Jun Do's stint as a tunnel miner became a worthwhile metaphor the reader is forced to live for the entire novel - in  a blackened tunnel.  Learning how to see within this ugly world never became my goal - slogging through a book of endless cruelty inflicted by state-bred psychopaths was torture enough in its own right. The author could have ended his story 350 pages earlier and delivered the same message.  I wish he had.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|not bad. keeps you busy. you get all cuddly with the horse which is nice. I approve. bit annoying to wait for tasks to complete. at times
0812993292|5.0|Really cute little book.  I thoroughly enjoyed reading it.  The storyline surprised me.  I wasn't sure what the book was about and found it to be a very pleasant story.  It's quaint, interesting and Harold Fry is a cute little character.  It's isn't too hard to believe that a lot people would like to do what he did.
B0049U4INC|5.0|Mr. Kawasaki lays out the fundamentals for how to conduct business from a strategic and ethical approach. A lot of the concepts also very applicable in personal life as well. Definitely a must read.
B005FISBTO|5.0|I'm an addict when it comes to Dexter.  Every season, I wonder how they can continue such a story line, but it's always a surprise.  I really liked this season and can't wait until the next one.  Love the characters, always.  It's such a sick storyline, but they seem to pull it off well.
B0098VXMNE|5.0|I love this show and can't get enough of the violence and good looking women. The phantom camera is awesome !
B003ZSJ212|1.0|Star Wars is dead. It died in 1997 and is a complete trainwreck. The Special editions and the prequels are God-awful. Don't waste your time on these crappy films.
B005EGXTHG|4.0|It's a good continuation from the first book - takes it in a direction that isn't totally predictable which is good.
B00005JKQ6|5.0|Why is This Great Film Not Available on DVD? There is no way I am paying $80 for a DVD. It is available for Instant Video, but I want the DVD. Why? Why?
B005EGXTEE|4.0|I enjoyed reading this book. On a few occasions I didn't want to put it down because I wanted to know what happened next
B000EQ5SRK|1.0|so its really of no use to me very disappointed to b honest.<br />i think it shud b specified that it cant b played in europe when bought in usa
B008QE9XD2|3.0|Glad I watched it.  It was enjoyable, however, not something I'd re-watch.  Some of the product placement was annoying and there were a few times the focus on it being the 70's was ... odd.  It seemed as if they grossly underestimated the intelligence of the audience.  Wish I just rented and not bought it.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|I downloaded this app because I loved the original Temple Run from the beginning.  I did not get the same feeling from this game.  Many of the obstacles are more difficult.  I had the tilt the Kindle Fire too much to avoid some of them.  I still play the original much more.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Love to play! On breaks at work. Helps me relax. When I just have a few minutes to sit quietly and what to play.
B008WOULPK|5.0|It is a substantial history and bibliography of fashion photography as well as an inspiring example of someone who is passionate about their work and creativity. Half way through, I started Google imaging all the names that were mentioned to reference the photographer, designer, editor or hairstylist to see and understand their work and contribution which added greatly to the experience, then immediately started re-reading it from the beginning to continue looking at the rest of the references. Then there are all the charming drawings, selected works, photos and an edited insider's view of the business - making for several days of creative entertainment, humor and wonder.
B001OSIV62|5.0|I think everyone should see this film at least once.  There are no words to describe it besides, \\"Absolutely amazing!\\"
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|This was a great book buy this book because it is free and it is so sweet but not soggy kind of sweet.
B005SFR7YE|5.0|I watched this on Netflix and loved it SO much, I decided to buy it to watch off-line as well!<br /><br />I agree with another reviewer that the other Raouls were annoying.  This Raoul is not - which (to me) makes it more believable that Christine would fall in love with him and thus choose him over The Phantom.<br /><br />The voices are so clear and beautiful!  I was SO captivated!!  I enjoyed singing along in some parts and in others, I simply HAD to hear them w/o me singing...<br /><br />By far and away, this is my ABSOLUTE favorite version of Phantom EVER!  I especially loved the encore performance - just awesome!  BRAVO
B0042XA2U4|5.0|I find this author an easy read. Her book can be whimsical. Good book for a vacation or long car ride.
B005NFJAZS|2.0|The quality of the picture is good.<br />The amount of stars is based purely on my dislike for the content of the film itself.<br /><br />*don't read on if you don't want spoilers or hints on the plot*<br /><br />I give it only two starts because I disliked the content of the musical.  I know! I am sorry!  I just don't feel that the con man is really redeemed - it's not believable to me!  That and I don't find it believable that the smart librarian would so quickly cover for a con man!  Really?!  After only 3 days she hides the fact that he's lying to the WHOLE town and ripping them off just because her little brother talks to him a bit?  I don't know - maybe it was just poorly set up, and poorly executed - I just didn't find it believable.<br /><br />However, the singing is good.  I don't like many of the songs... but the quartet is really good!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|First class writing, acting and production.  Interaction between family members and staff during period of great change during early 20th Century England varies between intriguing, amusing, and heart-warming; but is never dull.
B009GI8J1O|5.0|This book segues all over the place.  One story just stopping in mid sentence, to jump to another story.  It takes a bit to understand the reasons, but when you do, it actually enhances the story, because it's a continuous mystery as to what is going to happen next.  It all connects, and it's mind-blowing!
B005J4TLN4|5.0|I saw the trailer on a rented video. Since I'm a Britnut, I had to see it.  LOVE LOVE LOVE this movie! The kids are totally ghetto ass brats. The residents are understandably fed up with the state of things. I like how everyone in this film is significant in some way: the teen girls, the mugging victim, the guy who owns the weed room, the well read rich boy, the little ones. I think that Joe Cornish did an excellent job of casting young actors who are not blase/jaded about portraying kids who finally realize what real battle and \\"Fam\\" is all about. Interesting how they use lots of  American as well as Jamaican & UK slang. This is my fave alien invasion movie ever! BELIEVE!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|The book was so good I would read it fifteen more times the end was the best part to me
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I love these books.  While there are some similarities to some other books, these characters are all their own.  Can't wait for the next one.
B004SBQGHS|1.0|There is absolutely NO REASON this PAID &quot;ad-free&quot; game needs access to my location, my accounts, or even open network sockets.<br /><br />Vote with your wallet and say NO to apps with invasive permissions!
B005VSRFEA|4.0|Good read about systematic evaluations of various systems. Gives good practical methods of where one is at when dealing with systems. The only drawback I find was that it leaned a little too left politically. Maybe it wasn't the author's intention, but I could feel it.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love how minecraft is now for kindle fire! And now with new updates coming out, soon it will be like the computer!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|This is how he used to write.  Hopefully, he is back on track and will continue to write more like this one.  hated to pit it down, his great humor is strong as opposed to the last few where it got tiresome.<br />Great Reading!
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|you must pick up this game. amazing graphics, plot is not as good as mc2s (in my opinion) but its VERY entertaining. New additions to multiplayer and a new and improved party system all for gust .99 cents!
B000JMKTLO|5.0|Totally enjoyed the mystery, the humor and all the characters!  yes, all of them!<br />Cant wait for her next book.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|It is really fun and it will entertain you for a long time!!!!<br />AND ITS FREE! Duh..... fun fun fun fun
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Easy and fun.  My whole family enjoys it.  Many games to choose from and not to hard to master.  Recommend.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Its addicting and awesome I love to play it when I'm bored.I give a hundred thumbs up:p. Its works perfectly and there's nothing wrong with it.
B006IYFCIM|5.0|This book is a mirror of what human minds think and handle the 'honest' stuff. I have a co-worker who says it is okay to watch pirated film even if it's new film. He justified it saying that he won't watch the film going to theater anyway so there won't be no loss of profit for the producer. He handled the dishonesty but i could not handle his behaviour.<br /><br />I wondered how persons like him could rationalize like that even though knowing they are wrong deep down.<br /><br />One day he said he won't watch pirated films; i was glad (thinking my lecture worked). He said the reason; he had been told that to enter 'God's real temple(the one in heaven i guess)' one has to be pure. That explains his cost benefit analysis. He does not care about being dishonest and caught in this life, yet he's worried about the punishment he would get (he thinks so) up in the heaven or hell or whatever.<br /><br />If you are a person who can't understand what it is like to be working with a co-worker like him, this book is for you!
B000YMM3CC|5.0|its the perfect love story to the end. it lasted through to death., all the way to eternity and beyond.
B00BEPVAV8|3.0|Mom were are you were out of toilet paper,mom come on hurry up my shows on<br />Man women sooooo slow
B009YP9L7U|4.0|The cover got my attention and after reading the forward, I was hooked. I recommend it for a nice light hearted read. It's cute!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Its a really good way to train your brain but its really fun at the same time. If you looking for a way to train your brain then this is the game for you!
B007REV4T8|5.0|Fast paced, visually stunning and a good story line..Bond has never been better<br />Too bad we lose a major character but the relationships continue to evolve
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|It is good I like it but it could move a little faster thanks for everything have a beautiful day all year nuts
B008N1V11U|5.0|This a is a awesome game for young children! Not a lot of violence but filled with action to keep them engaged! I think it was worth the money!
B0070ZLZ1G|5.0|Every parent should read this book. Its principal themes are about the impact of poverty on children's life-success, but it has as much to say about the &#34;adversity&#34; of affluence.<br /><br />Every over-moneyed, over-scheduled,, over-achieving child will benefit from parents who seriously consider Tough's conclusions about the importance and process of character-development
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I really enjoy this game. As far as free games go its really great. Its easy to play but not to the point of being rediculously boring. Great app.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|I wish Percy Jackson would be in the book. I  recommend this book to the sea of monsters,to the lighting thief,and to the Titan,s curse.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|i love this app I have always wanted a horse and this is about as close as ill get too its a wonderful app because its shows you how to take care of a horse and it shows the responsibility you have and plus I thinks it awesome because they have unicorns!
B00498YZH8|5.0|intense movie, but accurate portrayal of certain parts of the Ozarks<br />Jennifer Lawrence has an amazing talent<br />not for children!!!
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I enjoyed this refreshing tale of taking a leap of faith which others might not deem appropriate. Meeting these characters and watching their story unfold was fascinating and I was pulling for them to fall in love from the moment they first met. I will definitely read other titles by this author as time allows.
B009S33I68|4.0|An amazing view of the all around consequences of war and how it forever changes each warrior and his or her loved ones.<br /><br />A must read for anyone trying to come to grips with the emotional toil of soldiers and those they leave behind.
B008OCTMRS|5.0|Once upon a time we gave away our vinyl albums when we bought all our favourites on those wonderfully crisp, clear-sounded compact discs!<br /><br />Now, when a new product from a global superstar comes out, we buy the compact disc and, if one is available, the big, beautiful vinyl edition.<br /><br />Is there anything that sounds better than the sound of great music on vinyl booming out of big stereo speakers?  I doubt it.  Except of course if it's the sound of Michael Jackson music on vinyl booming out of big stereo speakers!<br /><br />Not only does the music sound great, but the packaging for vinyl is, of course, bigger and better than CDs have ever been able to be.  Add up all those pluses and BAD25 Anniversary Edition on vinyl is as good as it gets (at least until MJ's NEXT anniversary or new release album comes out!)
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this app my whole family plays it.just wish it was easier to earn gems.just wished more of my friends would play.
B000E1NWGY|5.0|This disc combines recordings made in 1961-2. These famous recordings are ones that I have had in my collection for years but in their previous formats. Having tested the 'Spain' disc and being much impressed I have moved on to the Heifetz recordings.<br /><br />So far I have heard two such discs and in case the improvement is marked with greater internal definition within the orchestra and with better balance between the soloist and the orchestra. There is also a greater sonic depth from front to back and the whole tonal range is far fuller.<br /><br />The performances themselves are, of course, so well known and famously so, that further comment on that score is hardly necessary. However I will comment that these are among the finest performances ever recorded of these works. Furthermore, any suggestion that Heifetz could be thought of as on the 'cool' side as has been remarked in the past, can now be refuted by these altogether warmer re-masterings which, I am sure, are not artificially enhanced but instead, tell the truth.<br /><br />In conclusion, I would strongly suggest that these SACD versions are superior to the previous versions and are well worth the price of upgrading. This is not something I would normally do myself so that makes this a particularly strong comment. Newcomers to these discs will simply be amazed at what the engineers could manage so many years ago. Fewer microphones placed accurately coupled with longer recorded 'takes' have a musical result hard to match with modern sophistications.f the playing and relevant comparisons. They are succinct. Keep up the good work!

The Beethoven is a fresh and pacey performance with a very lyrical approach in the first two movements and with an irresistible 'bounce' to the finale. The Mendelssohn redefines the meaning of a 'fleet' performance but this is never achieved with any sense of strain.

B007ZGO7EM|5.0|A good application that does what it says it will do.  It's a calculator.  It functions as a calculator and the price is great.

B008OOYALE|3.0|An engaging game, but you can only go so far before you have to start paying extra money for items you need to be able to progress in the game.
B008JFUNAU|4.0|Journey back to the land of Oz with this new hit that the whole family will love.  Not to be compared with the 1939 classic, this is a fantastic movie with a lot of heart, a bit of goodness, some magic, and some trickery.  Join Oz, Finley the monkey, and China Girl (my favorite character) as they walk across the yellow brick road to defeat the wicked witch.  But beware, the wicked witch may not be the witch that it's supposed to be.<br /><br />The special effects are jaw dropping and you simply must watch this in 3D.  Everything pops out at you and there were some scenes where I actually felt the need to duck.  I've never seen the land of Oz look so real.<br /><br />Bottom line - gather your family and friends and see this movie in 3D while it's in theaters.  It's worth your money and your time.
B00000JHAU|1.0|This is the best album ever. You can tell it's some pretty heady, affected, quirky stuff because there's a copy of The Trial on the cover next to that girl who's feigning fashionable malaise. The Trial is a book written by a smart Russian guy called Franz Kefka. I love books.
B004ZA9HB4|2.0|Every time i try to play a YouTube video it says &quot;unable to play, unknown video file format&quot;. I just want the app to use YouTube videos. Please fix it asap
B0091XIZO0|4.0|What I really liked about this Chopin Album is that unlike his Liszt album, Lang Lang didn't play all of the extremely stereotypical pieces of Chopin. Yes you could debate that his etudes are very often played but overall, I think his choice of repertoire was much more classier than his Liszt. I also enjoyed listening to his more musical side which came out more in this album as well. Overall, Lang Lang produced a very respectable Chopin CD!
B00129H7VS|5.0|I've been looking forward to the blu ray version for years and have finally got time to watch it.<br /><br />The storyline, characters, settings are all great and you can't ask for more from a war topic series... Finished the whole series in 2 days.  I couldn't stop but to watch it until my eyes were too tired....  And I won't stop if I could continue...<br /><br />BUY IT!
098478280X|5.0|I'm going to school for computer science. Even though I feel confident in my knowledge and problem solving abilities, this book has great information to help prepare you for the interview process. The author provides great insight and suggestions. I'm reading through it now, and I could see reading it again. I would definitely recommend this book. It is completely worth the money I paid for it. I just wish there was a Kindle version I could have bought.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I like that this version can switch to left-handed play - something only southpaws can appreciate.  The graphics are okay, and you can select the option to deal a potentially winning hand (as opposed to a purely random deal) which is nice.  Recommended...
B005LAII80|5.0|3D and regular versions are both good.  Well paced movie which is only just being discovered after not doing well at the box office.  Don't know anyone who didn't love it after seeing it.  Highly recommended.
B00B6KJ0AE|5.0|Krokus didn't let me down. I was eagerly awaiting this release, and I like what I hear.Their 1982 release \\"One Vice At A Time\\" still remains my favorite Krokus effort, but this release comes in as my #2 favorite Krokus effort. They do go back to their early style here, simple riffs and lyrics with some very cool guitar licks thrown in at all the right places.To sum it up, it's plain old, no frills, rock-n-roll with great vocals,and guitars front and center.If you crave guitar rock like you enjoyed from the 70's and 80's, here it is....enjoy!
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|Challenging and very thought provoking. Keeps you guessing. If you dont want to play kids games, this is for the adults who want more than just shooting games.
B007PF7MGS|5.0|With solid reference to our newest science this book has shattered all of my fears of eating a plantbased diet. This book will show you that a plantbased diet is not rocket science, it will show you how easy it is to get sufficient nutrition from plants and it will show you that by following very few and simple rules you can eat what you want, as much as you want, whenever you want. A must read for vegans.
0486438600|5.0|As a beginner at henna I'm impressed with the designs and beauty of the art contained within these covers. It's a must have for learning the intricacy and detail of this art form.
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|A strange side effect, I find this game relaxing. Fun to play. Simple strategy that gets progressively more difficult. Excellent look.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Love Downton Abbey, all seasons.  Watched all seasons on my Amazon Prime streaming, well worth the money.  Now have to wait for new seasons.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I can not explain more that I wish there was more to this book. But I mean I already know what happens from here on out and it makes me want to start reading them all over again
B008FYZIVY|5.0|You don't need me to tell you just how great this UK series is. The characters are so well drawn and the story lines are so engaging that you know you are enjoying the absolute best in programming!
B004HW7JH4|5.0|Can watch at my leisure and replay to see all the fantastic fashions and relive the sixties. This series is underrated in my opinion.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Great Book.  I wasn't goin g to read any more Stephen King but I tried this book...  Man he has done it again.<br />Where in the world does he come up with his storys.  Great Book.
0525478817|2.0|Initially, I approached The Fault in Our Stars with excitement having heard so much about it, but that quickly fell apart and I assure you that it's not because too-high expectations. It was just bad. The novel is essentially a love story between two cancer kids. Green does his best to keep his style unadorned and create a specific voice for Hazel, the protagonist. We get the picture: she needs an oxygen tank to breathe and she's best friends with her Mom. And while her life is not what anyone hopes for, Green uses humor to keep the novel from being of the overly sentimental variety. Okay. But from there, things fall off. How you ask?<br />1. Augustus Waters is completely contrived from the dialogue to his need for metaphors. He is essentially a cardboard cut-out of a dreamy teenage boy.<br />2. Green uses a novel both Hazel and Augustus read as a crutch to support their love story.<br />3. The third act's step away from realism or simple plausibility shows way too much conscious effort.<br />4. Hazel's voice is inconsistent and tiring after 300 pages.<br />I don't recommend this. I'm sure there are better cancer stories out there. With this one, You'll rip through it and wonder why you even bothered in the first place.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|This is a really fun version. It doesn't hurt that I love the movie & Samba. The bird graphics are fun. Although I just got the game, I can't seem to stay away. My European Burmese kitty loves to watch the graphics

B0014KD46W|3.0|The only compaint I have is that I don`t like most of the songs. I bought it for one specfic song and thats okay. It`s not uncommon for me to not like most of some discs. That does not reflect on the product or the seller.
B005UBNKWO|5.0|I got this processor to go in a whitebox test platform.  Put it in a M5A99X EVO R2.0 ASUS motherboard along with 2x4GB Corsair Vengeance modules and a Antec BP550 Plus 550W ATX12V power supply.  Everything worked well together and got the machine up and running in no time.<br /><br />Shipping was prompt as is always the case on with my Amazon Prime items.
B005DF2QMC|3.0|I bought this to take back to Canada wher my cassettes are . Therefore I really can`t rate the producr. If it does what it is supposed to do, I will be very pleased since I have alot of cassetttes
B006LSZECO|4.0|I like the story line and that the characters are immediately a little off....makes the reader just a bit uncomfortable and suspicious.  Well written in an interesting format.  Page-turner
B000660UN0|3.0|Have not yet received this product so it is hard to rate it. Saw the program on TV and if it is as good as that I will be pleased
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love to read the Bible and I was pleased to find all the different translations right there at my fingertips. It is easy to read and very resourceful.The price is right too.
B009X01FJS|4.0|I like the case--but do not know how to use the camera with the case on. Maybe the camera is not to be used with the case on. I do wish there was a way to use the camera--Maybe putting a hole where the camera is<br /><br />I enjoy the standing case feature and use it often.
B008K8VDPU|4.0|I like Pianist hd.  I use it to practice my part of a song we are singing in church. My niece enjoys playing with it.  The only thing I don't like is I would like to see more than one octave at a time.
0062082353|5.0|Fantastic book. A real life look into the story of an American hero. A brave soldier whose life ended to soon.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|This final chapter followed pretty good, action as expected as was the end, but overall I would recommend the series.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|Well done. Love the way you can combine the different backgrounds to your liking. Rain and wind are great for sleep mode.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Looked at hundreds of angles and from a global / people oriented perspective.  This could apply to any world changing event:  Plague, war, civil unrest, etc.  Highly recommend.  Watched the moving &#34;Contagion&#34; shortly after reading and found many similarities in the movie to this book, but World War Z was much more in depth.
B0034G4P26|3.0|Not too bad. All grandchildren have watched it.  Some funny parts.  Middle of the road. May watch it again in future.
B001992NUQ|5.0|I just watched this for the first time and it is already in my top movies of all time list.  It will blow your mind with amazing directing from David Fincher and excellent performances from Brad Pitt & Edward Norton.  This movie deserves to be in everyone's collection, and looks fantastic on blu-ray.  That's all because I am not supposed to be talking about it...
B008TRUDAS|5.0|I really enjoyed this book as I am a fan of poetry. The poems were really thought provoking and well written. I enjoyed the characters. I know people don't really believe that you can experience such intense emotions for a person upon the first meeting, but that happened to me 22 years ago. Today is our 21st anniversary and I have loved him from the first moment I laid eyes on him! Thanks Collen!

B001AQO3WY|2.0|As a Marine who served in an infantry unit right before the Iraq war, I can see aspects of the film and reminisce and relate, but.... The one thing that really stands out to me though is that the film really seemed to portray all marines as these renegade hooligans lacking self discipline. Every platoon has a couple guys we in the Corps called \\"s*** birds\\". They are Marines that need a little extra \\"motivating\\" and need reminding to shut their mouths and do what they are told. For the most part a marine unit runs like clockwork and these \\"s*** birds\\" are the minority. This film makes it looks like most of the Marine Corps is made up of these guys. Sure Marines can be rowdy but the training and self discipline kicks in gear when appropriate.  The other thing that really took me back is how jacked up their leadership was portrayed. The company Gunnery Sergeants (Gunnys) Sergeant Major and a good number of the Officers were all portrayed as either incompetent or a joke all the way up to their Lt. Colonel. The vast majority of senior enlisted Marines I served under were A. J. squared away hard Corps Marines, whom the majority of their troops respected and looked up to. I have never seen a gaggle of incompetent officers in charge like they show in this film. Marines might not always agree with the decisions coming down the pike, but it was never a group of idiots calling the shots like in this film.  I never experienced the racism that was portrayed at times toward other Marines. I always thought the Corps was a unique place where, for example, a country guy in tight jeans and cowboy boots was able to be buddies with a hispanic with baggy clothes from central LA, and all the other mingling from around the country with different cultures and ethnicities. Everyone becomes brothers with one another in the Corps...    The good parts of the film were where they showed every day life out there. The not knowing what is going to happen next, how things are constantly changing ata moments notice, and even some of the rowdiness, but most of that takes place during the down time, and the self discipline snaps in when appropriate. The action scenes I thought were entertaining. The fog of war and having to make due with less... This film could have been much better if they didn't dumb down the majority of the Marines the entire time, and showed them with some better leadership.

1451695195|5.0|When people have a near-death experience after a horrifying event, they feel like their entire life just flashed before their eyes. For Dr. Eben Alexander, his experience will be far more different when going thru a coma and sharing his beliefs with all of us. He even gives us his take on a question we probably asked before, \\"is there a heaven?\\".<br /><br />In the prologue, we get to read a lot of interesting facts about Dr. Alexander. As a young boy, he always dreamed of flying in the sky. He attended the University of North Carolina and joined it's parachuting team. He eventually graduated in 1976 and became a neurosurgeon. Now, we get to read of his near-death experience.<br /><br />It starts on November 10, 2008, when Alexander is having a usually average day. Later in the night after having trouble falling asleep, he has extreme body pains and ends up losing consciousness and out of life. He is then rushed to Lynchburg General Hospital, where he works, to the ER and they're operating on his brain and it's a big mess of spinal fluid, swelling, and pus. It all lands him into a dark come in an instant.<br /><br />Alexander gets to describe us what was like being in a whole different world while in a coma. He described as the \\"most beautiful world\\" he'd ever seen, as well as vibrant, earth-like, and a dream world. He also stated that he saw a little girl with blue eyes and shows him the world that's full of life. While he's in his coma, Alexander's family and friends stay by his side and hope that he survives his near-fatal journey.<br /><br />Dr. Alexander's story is truly a extraordinary journey that everyone should be reading. There is a lot of real storytelling and emotion in every page, and his explanation is very detailed in words and symbolism. We also read a lot a bit of some medical info on his coma and near-death experiences, as well as his memories from the event and more personal moments.<br /><br />For any medical doctor or student or anyone curious on near-death experiences or the afterlife, this is a novel that they'll find fascinating, no doubt. Other readers will be surprised and find this moving, heartpounding, and interesting, like I did.<br /><br />Final Verdict: \\"Proof of Heaven\\" gives us a powerful look of the underworld that will astonish readers.near-death experiences or the afterlife, this is a novel that they'll find fascinating, no doubt.

B007MU85D0|5.0|I Found l liked more than just one song in the album, like yellow light, i didnt know such song existed
B00AREIAI8|3.0|I love this game. It gets  very addicting!  Could be a little easier to get gems though.<br />You will not be disappointed with graphics.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I liked the growing suspense of the Flynn storyline. Also, Christian's battle with his upbringing  and the future he's trying to start with Ana.
B000KITQK2|1.0|Bought it to work with my Behringer Acoustic Amp hoping it would improve performance with my Schatten lipstick mic, which has no pre-amp. The Amp does not work well to begin with (effects are marginal at best and it produces lots of background hummmm) and there is no difference at all running the signal through the ADI21 V-tone. Tech support no help either. What a waste of money - don't plan to purchase Behringer products in general after this misadventure. At least the Marshall Amp did what it said it would.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game it's so addictive but to fun and this is the best-selling game and that's all I got to say
B00633W614|5.0|I could not put this book down.  I just wish Mr. Archer had the next installment in print.  Five scrapbook from a 5 star author.  Well done.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Fantastic...I loved it. I didn't want to put it down right from the beginning.  Now I can't wait to see the movie.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I do this game every day. I spend hours playing solitaire.  I usually run my battery down playing this awesome game.  I really like it.
B0009R1T7M|5.0|This album is an absolute work of art. The flow of the track list is phenomenal, and each song tells a story unlike the rest. I would encourage ANYONE to at least take a listen because any music lover will be able to appreciate this wonderful album.
B0012GTZC0|4.0|Not exactly lighthearted, actually quite gory in places, some sex scenes, but not too offensive (adults only for those reasons). Typical Follet with several threads coming together. Quite a page turner as each chapter leaves you in mid-air. An easy holiday read.
B0015DWJX2|5.0|The language, the humor, the characters, the history, the ending.  The pace and rhythm of it.  I loved this book.
B007THA4FI|4.0|There are over 3,000 posts to Amazonon this novel by critics with a better way of putting things than me.<br />For my two bits this is a fine novel for mature (be they 13 or 70) people with believable characters and interesting quirks. It dawns on the reader that fats is not nor probably ever was fat.<br />A fine novel following her most enjoyable children's books. I hope there are books for those of us who a willing to surpress our inner child.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Everything you need for a basic calculator app!  Kids love to play around with it too!  Must have app for your Kindle.
B00127RAJY|4.0|This workout works all the muscles in a very short time.  I am still in the first workout group... haven't made it thru all the sections yet but I am sure it will just get more intense. I work up a sweat and feel the burn in only 20 minutes.. Its great.
1603427244|5.0|Although there are other books out on casting and binding, I like this one as the pictures are good.<br />There is a handy chart too which explains which technique is best for which type of garment.<br />An excellent buy for your knit library....beginning to advanced intermediate.  Master's knitters<br />probably won't need it anymore, but still a great reference.
B007FH9GT2|5.0|I have thoroughly enjoyed this title and have revisited it numerous times. Very gripping story and equally fascinating characters. I highly recommend it.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Enigmatis is a mystery/hidden object game. The goal is to solve a string of disappearances in Maple Creek.<br /><br />LIKES:<br />1. The graphics are top notch.<br />2. The plot is intriguing and remains interesting. (For instance: one of the missing girls may still be alive.)<br />3. There is a lot to accomplish within the game. A few examples are getting lights turned on, breaking into a house, fixing up an old truck to drive and much, much more. There are also tons of hidden object scenes & plenty of puzzles to solve as well.<br />4. This is by far the longest and most involved game I have played by Big Fish so far. (Although Big Fish has superior graphics & well written storylines, some of their games seem a tad short.) Not so with Enigmatis. Just when you think things are finishing up you meet someone unexpected or find a new location.<br /><br />DISLIKES:<br />1. Enigmatis 2 has not yet been released.<br /><br />This game has restored my faith in Big Fish. Buy it - you won't be disappointed.
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|wish there was a delete game choice . I couldn't erase when I typed a freinds name wrong so now am stuck with that game showing all the time.
B00BJ9VBLI|4.0|nice, mindless match 3.  decent graphics and some puzzles have a nice degree of difficulty without being impossible.  all in all, good game
B003UBTX7C|3.0|The beginning was slow with many characters introduced. Once the plot materialized and got going, it was a enjoyable read.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|This is my 2nd G5 app and I'm convinced...I'll be playing all games similar to this type.  Hard to stop once I've started!
B004J4WN0I|3.0|A good quick read, but not much depth. Kinda like eating Goldfish crackers, a mindless brain feed that keeps you wanting more.
B002NXSRX4|5.0|It has joes, ninjas, gadgets, Dennis quaid, it's a hit. So what if your not 7. To 11 in age range, skip it and leave it for the rest that like a good popcorn film.
B00ATPVA78|5.0|G5 I am really happy with the games.  The graphics are great and the puzzle are challenging I love a good challenge.
B004J713JW|5.0|And this blu ray proves it over and over. Billy Joel can play rock nroll piano. Much better than Jerry lee who?
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|This game was great.  The story line was good and the graphics were awesome.  I am looking forward to sequels to a lot of you games.  Keep up the good work.
B003BZXI6E|5.0|Anything about her personal life, politics, or anything else. I do know that she is the greatest singer to ever live. Ever. And nothing is ever going to change that in my lifetime. There's a very good reason she only did one broadway show. As big as broadway is, she's bigger than that. She's bigger than anything when it comes to this style of singing. She's Barbra.
B002Q0F6V0|5.0|This is a fabulous record and still has the AIC pummeling riffs sound, and the fabulous voice of William DuVall. Still can't believe how he fits in so perfectly,with his own style. Lyrics deep and certainly speak at times to the loss of Layne. Can't wait for the next one.
145210655X|5.0|It's simple, not really all that funny, but for some reason highly entertaining and readable. My son loves it and I love him. This book is a hit!
B009YU62H2|4.0|A certain start to a great comeback, wasn't expecting much but was presently surprised, a definite buy for the Audioslave / Soundgarden/Chris Cornell collection..
B002CN2NCG|3.0|Movie was entertaining as a kid, a little slow nowadays. Lawrence Kasdan has never made an unclever movie in his life.
B007QVLKI2|5.0|Seems anything coming out of Iceland has something great to offer and this album and group is no exception. A must buy,
B008VBYN80|1.0|I played this for 10 minuets only to learn that not only do you have to spend loads of actual real-life money if you want to get anything done, but the only alternative is to invite your friends to the game. I don't know about you guys but generally my friends don't care fore these games and now neither do I. I would reccomend ignoring the leach like company that is Gameloft unfilled they wise up and get their collective head out of their collective sphicter. Greed begets nothing other than resentment. Good day and good riddance.
B00003JRCQ|5.0|I Love Jane Austen books and this movie captures the romance of the book.  Highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys Jane Austen.  Of course the books are always better, but this is very good.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. It's a little different then what I usually read, but it kept me engrossed from the beginning. I highly recommend this to anyone. I have never read this author before but would again.
B00005MP58|5.0|This is my all time favorite movie.  Jane Austen books are wonderful and I believe this movie lives up to her vision.  Great romantic movie.
B003VPWX6K|2.0|I haven't finished it, but so far it's all about what makes for a good butler.  Who cares?  Is this relevant to today's life?
B0077ATSSQ|5.0|I really don't understand the negative/critical reviews here about this film/DVD. It's a heart warming story, with a wonderful cast. Tom Hanks lends his voice and character well.
B00000JXVK|5.0|Although this a documentary, I consider it the best movie ever. It covers every thing 'motorcycle' but will be enjoyed by everyone.
B003YUQAFM|5.0|Just what I wanted.  Product description as billed.  Value for price.  If you like this style then go for this simple shoe.
0385336950|2.0|This would have made a good short story.  The plot was okay; the characters were caricatures, but the setting and balloon bombs were intriguing.  It was a great book to read at bedtime, because it put you to sleep rather quickly. The scene in the plane looking for the bomb and Belk parachuting out was good, well-written and tighter than most of the rambling descriptions..  The author needs to take a lesson from Hemingway.
B006OV7S1I|3.0|Maybe my expectation were too high for this film.  I had heard good reviews and overall the film was not bad just, not the movie I was expecting.  This and my next review both left me with an uneasy feeling. Neither good nor bad.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|This book was okay; nothing great and nothing bad...but it surely didn't make me run out to buy Book Two.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|This is one of those series that you can hardly wait for the next season to come out!  Already looking forward to season 3.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|...It is a good game for kids who is getting ready to get a horse who has a love and eager to see horses everyday.
B004HO6I2O|4.0|Another one of those movie that had a few laugh out loud moments and left me smiling through much of the movie.  A little different twist on the Freaky Friday theme.
B007FROH4G|5.0|I particularly liked the progression of events, desperately sad though they were, and the excellent way the effects of the decline in Alice's health had on the people who were family and colleagues, were portrayed.
B009POCFTG|3.0|Again,, like my review on Martha Marcy May Marlene, this movie just was not what I was expecting and left me with an uneasy feeling.  Great acting just, not what I was looking for.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love Temple Run 2  it's a great game it's so fun. It's great for kids. It's a Awesome game my brother and I both love it! I recommend it!
B007REV4YI|5.0|This has got to be the best James Bond movie in a long time if not forever!  I have the entire Bond series and I am waiting for more like this to come out!!!!
B0063IH60K|5.0|Very addictive! This game keeps you busy for hours! Well worth the purchase free or paid for.....gotta get some rest!
0756407125|5.0|Why is it that all the writers I love are also the ones that write the slowest?  Can't wait for more!
B002VRNR1Y|5.0|Basic clasic horror without zombies, CG graphics, aliens, vampires or werewolves.<br />Great acting, beautiful location, what's not to like?<br />I've seen it 4 times, and counting.
B007MC8YLQ|4.0|It's a well realized visualization of the classic game, with nice innovations and better than average play. Could use more interesting backgrounds, though.
B00BLGZDVS|2.0|Great actors, really disjointed script. It leaves you feeling cheated as you keep waiting for something to happen that will give some meaning to the events on screen.<br />Yes: a lost alcoholic, yes: a fascinating charlatan, and yes... what?
034580404X|5.0|My wife loved these books! She read through all 3 of them within just a few days of getting them and she is not normally the type of person that sits and reads anything. All of her friends have borrowed them so I would say they are more than worth the money.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I must say that I was a little skeptical in t he beginning.<br />However, with Eben's unique personal spiritual observations, tempered with his MD knowledge of the physical brain functions, the book is very powerful. As a result, it is difficult to not be convinced that there is a spiritual life after physical death..<br /><br />Please read this book with an open mind, it is an easy read and very well may change your life..
B008XBCJ34|5.0|I loved this movie so much I watched it in 3D Imax and regular 3D. Actually I enjoyed the regular 3D much better. I bought this set as it was a great 2 set deal and to test out my new 3D Samsung TV. If you loved the part where the flower of Ava Tree come together on Jack the first time and they float towards you too then you will love this TV version of Avatar 3D.<br /><br />Hope that helps.
B0043KK4N6|5.0|Cher has done it again, great movie and great acting.  The soundtrack is one of the best I play it often and the songs are wonderful.
B000SLP4SE|4.0|Although the movie started a bit slow the ending was unexpected and a twist. If you like anything spy like this is a good one.
B000I0QK74|5.0|This is a great album, wonderful songs just right for the holidays, I have played the songs over and over, never get tired of hearing them.
B00364K6YW|5.0|Colin Firth is one of my favorite actors and he did not dissappoint!  Have watched it several times already.  Humor, drama, heartbreak, suspense, it's all there with a happy ending.
0446580848|3.0|Enjoyed the read but this was not one of my favorites. I'll be waiting for the next Nelson DeMille book !
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|This is my second copy of this version.  I find that when I start watching, I can't stop. The characters are played perfectly by Ruth Wilson and Toby Stephens. This is a love story like no other I've seen.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|Sheryl's not trying to inspire the average woman. She's trying to give guidance to future potential leaders. There are very few great guides on this subject that incorporate a well-informed view of the challenges that high achieving women face.<br /><br />Criticism has come from many corners, often by those who haven't read the book or dismissed upfront the fact that one of the most successful businesswomen of our time (who remains actively involved with her family) may have a valuable view on the subject matter at hand.<br /><br />Admittedly, the first 6 chapters are repetitive, focusing on being assertive in one's careers. But then the book transitions to very practical advice that you hear surprisingly infrequently. For example: a) work your way up as far as possible before having children, then adjust accordingly; don't back down from responsibilities and opportunities years before a child enters your life. b) find a partner who is a true partner, who cares as much about being there for your kids as you do.<br /><br />The book may seem arrogant or out of touch for those that are insecure about their own place in life. But as a guide for motivated, smart people who want to make a difference in the world, it is very much worth the read.
B0053JJLLC|3.0|Biggest issue was how detailed and drawn out most of the deaths were but then the leader of the students, Danny and the inventor all died in a flash.<br />.kbf
B00A0SQBDM|5.0|Good story with good graphics and detail. Onced  purchased it was hard to put down. A good treasure hunt game.
B00AQ71FLK|1.0|This item was ordered by the ass that hacked the account and so I do not know or care to review it.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|this  book was different it had things in it most people never think about. makes for a good read exciting.
B00992CF6W|1.0|you create something and you blow it up while the app freezes every minute. that cost  $6.99. and for some reason my game graphics were really blurry.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|I really feel the writer was just using sex to fill up pages instead of having any real substance too much.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I love this calculator because the numbers/panel are large and bright.  It's easy, fast and convenient!  It works well on my Kindle Fire.  I highly recommend this calculator!

B008PE9GSA|5.0|A little grity on the Grunge effects but overall nice! Cannot take away  the Grade A Rating from these Guys.
B0076DCT2G|4.0|I love Nelson and everything he gives the reader. But in The Panther, my only objection was the repetition of, for example, The Panther's real name (we fans get it) and &#34;I'm only kidding&#34; (we know Nelson's humor by now).
B009YG2ND8|5.0|The game looks so good on my screen! They really did a good job on the game and I just can't put it down.
B000000H4V|5.0|Excellent cd and well priced at Amazon.  If you like hard core deep tone crunch Metal then this cd is for you. These guys are from Brazil. I followed them as a kid. This is the second time I bought this cd as I lost my first one. Well worth it these guys rock. One of their best albums.
B00785P2QC|5.0|This app is amazing u get to pretty much anything cause it is ur town. I would strongly recommend this app
B0034DGPEU|4.0|My heart ached for what the slaves endured at the hands of their owners and others.  A sad time in the history of our<br />country.  There is still too much hatred and racism in America today and a lot of it in our politicians, which is so hard<br />to understand.  Mostly with the legislators from the southern states.
B006BGZJJ4|3.0|I purchased this to replace the original cord that came with my Kindle.  The wires had come loose from the part that plugs into the Kindle and I was having a hard time getting a good charge.  So I purchased this one.  Didn't take long before this one was doing the same thing.  Also this one is a bit shorter than the original cord.  Currently, I have a popsicle stick taped around the end that plugs into the Kindle to keep it straight and keep a good connection, which seems to help.  I would think they could come up with a better design.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|There isn't really a word I can describe this book but amazing. This book hooks onto all of your emotions through out it. The book was very unpredictable which is exactly what I like to read to keep me interested and this book defiantly keep me interested. This is a must read.
0439023521|5.0|I'm not going to lie, I watched the movie and thoroughly enjoyed it. My youngest daughter wanted to read the book with me, so I bought it. The book is great as well. I can't wait for the other movies or to read the other books.
1586487981|5.0|There are Decades of investigations about the most important topics on poverty resumed in this book. the authors use an holistic view, taking to consideration all points, besides they are geniuses!!

B00BHU2A7I|4.0|It seems the biopic character du jour is Alfred Hitchcock: almost simultaneously released as this film was another real dud called THE GIRL dealing with the making of THE BIRDS which came and went quickly. Now we explore the great suspense maker through the machinations of the making of PSYCHO as the reason for exploring the strange body and mental habitus of Hitchcock. While not all of the data gathered for this film written by John J. McLaughlin based on Stephen Rebello's book `Alfred Hitchcock and the Making of Psycho' which in turn was based on the derring-do of filming Joseph Stefano's screenplay adapted from the Robert Bloch book PSYCHO which happened to be `inspired' by the serial killer Ed Gein, there certainly is a potpourri of ideas on which to let a cast a sterling actors dabble.<br /><br />The setting is 1959 and Hitchcock (Anthony Hopkins, flab enhanced) and his wife, Alma (Helen Mirren) are at the top of their creative game as filmmakers despite the fact that the various studios are suggesting that Hitchcock should retire. But Hitchcock has another film in his head - PSYCHO - and despite the fact that everyone including Alma believes the film cannot be made with the current censorship and because the story is tasteless Hitchcock decides to bankroll his own film and proceed. All of Hitchcock's characteristics surface - his propensity for blond actresses (he even spies on them while they are dressing), his involvement with the lurid story of Psycho to the point of visualizing Ed Gein (Michael Wincott) to bolster his rabid love of the story, his misplaced mistrust of Alma's friendship with writer Whitfield Cook (Danny Huston), and his demand that the entire cast and crew of the closed set film are sworn to silence about the movie's content. Hitchcock engages blond curvaceous Janet Leigh (Scarlett Johansson) and Anthony Perkins (James D'Arcy) for the leads, includes Vera Miles (Jessica Biel) for a bit part, and constantly fights for the film to be completed and released - which as we know, happened - due in large part to Hitchcock's own shenanigans about marketing.<br /><br />Though the real theme of the film is a love story between Hitchcock and Alma, the entire crew at Paramount Pictures becomes involved: Hitchcock's secretary Peggy Robertson (Toni Collette), Lew Wasserman (Michael Stuhlberg), Barney Balaban (Richard Portnow), Saul Bass (Wallace Langham), composer Bernard Hermann (Paul Schackman), writer Joseph Stefano (Ralph Macchio), among others. Hopkins gives us a fascinating portrait of Hitchcock and the rest of the cast fill their parts well. But in the end we are left wondering which film will be the basis of the next probable biopic of Alfred Hitchcock. Sacha Gervasi directs with some very generous asides to Hitchcock's mannerisms we all know well. Grady Harp, March 13d and released - which as we know, happened - due in large part to Hitchcock's own shenanigans about marketing.<br /><br />Though the real theme of the film is a love story between Hitchcock and Alma, the entire crew at Paramount Pictures becomes involved: Hitchcock's secretary Peggy Robertson (Toni Collette), Lew Wasserman (Michael Stuhlberg), Barney Balaban (Richard Portnow), Saul Bass (Wallace Langham), composer Bernard Hermann (Paul Schackman), writer Joseph Stefano (Ralph Macchio), among others.

B00BEN0YP8|5.0|A must see movie! Loved Liam Neeson as Oskar Schindler and Ralph Fiennes was menacing as Amon Goeth!  A powerful movie from director Steven Spielberg!
B00BM1AJIO|5.0|This is by far one of the best games I have played. Well worth the money. Beautiful graphics. Challenging and exciting. Good job G5. Played and downloaded well on my Kindle Fire.  Can't wait to see what G5 comes up with next.
1603420398|5.0|A wonderful, expressive and easy Crochet book to enjoy. I have already made many of the patterns in it and they are fantastic for gifts and extending larger projects. Great instructions and diagrams. Excellent Crochet book!
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft is fun to play. On survival it is very fun to take out zombies and creepers. I also love to build awesome houses on creative mode.
B005FLX2WC|5.0|I don't know where I've been, but I saw Beth Hart sing at the Kennedy Awards this year and fell in love with her voice.<br />I had never heard of her.  I listen to her CD repeatedly in my car.  I can't get enough.  I love the quiver in her voice.
B009NF54ZE|5.0|This game has it all: hidden objects finding differences, unscrambling messages, etc. This game picks up where Pirate Adventure leaves off. I highly recommend any of NevoSoft's games. You can play any of their games through the first few chapters to see if you like it.  Then, if you do, you can buy it here or on Google Play.  You can even get it free just by downloading other apps to try for free. NevoSoft gives you points to purchase their games from their web page. You will get 25-35 points just for trying other developers games to buy NevoSoft's apps. NevoSoft even has great apps for the PC. I've purchased all of the android games so far and have yet to find one I didn't like.
B00AUN2HBW|5.0|I enjoyed this movie every time I watched it. The characters and story line keeps me coming back for more..
B007VUA7VO|5.0|GREAT APP LETS ME KNOW HOW MUCH BATTERY I HAVE LEFT AND WENT TO CHARGE THE BATTERY ITS ' REALLY GREAT MUST HAVE
B00005JKG9|4.0|Everyone should see this movie at least once. Even if you don't like the story (real estate brokers), the acting its great. Pacino, Baldwin, Lemon, Spacey... A  great experience
B00BQPEIT2|4.0|I think the new version of the temple run is just great . I can't wait till the oz world's have finally came out because the dark forest over and over is really boring
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|Love story that makes you think about struggles of young love!  I will read more books by her again.  Really enjoyed it.
B004GUSG4M|5.0|The unraveling of this psychological mystery is masterfull. It puts the reader squarely into the plot with all the tension and paranoia one would feel in that situation.
B0051UP5NQ|1.0|This package does not accurately show your documents or let you do layout in editing documents unless you spend more money.  Like buying a car and having to pay extra for steering wheel.  On the other hand, it is a decent editor.  I'd give it 3 stars or so for functionality, but the only way to 'punish' the vendor for the fraud/deception/whatever is to give it the worst review possible.
B00A8ECU24|1.0|My 5 year old was very excited to play this game but was very disappointed when I had to uninstall the game.  I cannot afford to have a $100 mistake due to her pushing a wrong button.  This is unacceptable in a game marketed to small children.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is the best game you will ever download on your kindle fire. It's not as good as  the pc and Xbox 360 version but it comes very close. Do yourself a favor and<br />get this game! A 10 out of 10 game everyone should have!!!!!!!
B007KOMTUI|5.0|never dissapointed with Mad Men. We bought season 5 and plowed through it pretty quickly.  Excited to see what season 6 has for viewers.
B006RXSBS2|5.0|The movie remains impactful, after years of seeing it, to the point that I cheerfully bought it again instead of pirating it. Daniel Day Lewis is amazing in the role of Bill Cutting, and, even with a notable supporting cast, easily steals the show.
B0017R5UA0|5.0|This album is AMAZING and the fact that you can get it on vinyl is even better!Bought it as a gift for a friend who recently got a record player and he was excited to get it.
B008I3RARW|2.0|Throttle is busted.  You either go full speed or full stop.  Don't worry and drive like a maniac.  The cars are indestructable and the two cars you race against are driven by 80 year old grandmas.  The worst you can finish is third if you are a 100 year old grandma, but drive like crazy because its one lap and then app deleted!  Super lame!
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|It is the best game ever!!! The first time I played this game I was so adickdid to it .<br />You have to get this game if u want to .if that's the case. Until then good bye

B00AREIAI8|5.0|I think it's a very fun game. I play it every chance that I get. If you don't know if you should get it I say that you SHOULD, get it!!
B0058YPGL6|4.0|This show is on the cusp of becoming cornily awesome. The 'MTV' vibe fades in and out depending on the episodes, and the female empowerment is a little iffy in places, but all in all it's an enjoyable show with adorable characters and some magic.
B002VRZEYM|5.0|Blew me away.  I'm already a healthy eater and I grew up in a farming community, but I can't believe what has happened to the industry in the past few decades.
B008I3RARW|2.0|Okay game, but very simple. It is not, &quot;NOT&quot; I say, worth five dollars. thank God I bought it when it was the Free App of the Day (FAD).
0765325950|5.0|Like so many other readers of Robert Jordan's epic series, Wheel of Time, my first introduction to the series so long ago was 'wow!'. Then, about the middle of the series it was more 'meh'. I pretty much just kept reading because it seemed like I had invested so much time in it that I couldn't stop. But, to be honest, I had almost given up on ever seeing the final chapter, especially after Jordan's death.<br /><br />So it was a bit of a relief when Brandon Sanderson was chosen to finish the series and a huge one when A Memory of Light was finally published. I don't know how much of this last book was based on Jordan's notes and how much was from Sanderson's own imagination but I have to say that it was not a disappointment. At least the battle scenes weren't - the real Last Battle between Rand and the Dark One was pretty underwhelming. But right up until the very end, I was pulled into the story and had real problems putting it down so I could get a little sleep - given the length of this book (900+ pages), that's saying a lot.<br /><br />That is not to say I didn't have some problems with the book. Sanderson's depiction of the women characters still followed Jordan's - they were all one-dimensional, bossy, and down-right annoying. The only good woman character here was Nynaeve and that was only because she was hardly here at all and what little there was of her lacked a braid so no interminable braid tugging - that got a big 'yay' from me. As I said earlier the battle between Rand and the DO was pretty much a yawn and, without giving too much away in case there's still one fantasy fan out there who hasn't read this final book, Rand's end is, well, perplexing and something of a cheat.<br /><br />Still, I felt that Memory was a satisfying and fitting end to one of the best and best known series of the genre. It was tight, exciting and extremely well written. I expect, though, that most other readers will understand when I confess that the first word to pop into my head when I finally finished the last word of the last chapter was 'phew'.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|What a great story.  I didn't want it to end and am really looking forward to the next saga.  Thanks.
B007L3BMGA|1.0|So many stereotypes, so much gush, so little feminist awareness. Crap, utterly. Downloaded it by mistake - serves me right.
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|He could have lied but didn't. The plane crash scenes are captivating and are a must see. The movie is generally good.
B005OCFHHK|3.0|All 8 dvd's work fine. Quality appears to be good.<br />The only let down for me, is that I waited a long time to order the series hoping they would give me the extended versions. I have watched all of the movies on television. Often they are the extended version, with several scenes not usually shown.<br />So I feel sort of empty not receiving the extra scenes I'v watched on television.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Wonderful movie! It shows the plight of the hostages and brilliance of the CIA in the rescue mission. It also shows the bravery of and the emotion (for the hostages) felt by the character played by Ben Affleck.
B005GG0MIS|5.0|Very well written and easy to follow.  Love the history and little fun facts the authors insert into the book.  Gives insight into how things work in Washington
B00ACBN9CI|3.0|This game was really hard to control. Even when I changed the settings it was still hard to control. It wasn't bad, but it could be better.
0062082353|5.0|This book is a great read.  My condolences to his family.  What a tragedy to risk your life everyday overseas and then to lose your life after your safe return home.
B008AX18Y6|5.0|Josef Anton was the name Rushdie went by in the years he was hiding from Islamist assassins. His police minders called him ‘Joe’.<br />The tale he tells is gripping. It was a new situation and there was a general tendency not to want to ‘offend’ Muslims and to feel that he had brought his woes on himself. Over the years this attitude changed as people began to see the true nature of Islamist fascism. Rushdie increasingly came to  put extra value on the stand he had been forced into as time and again offers to find a solution were rejected by fanaticism.<br />He quotes a young man who told him that in 1989 he had been leader of demonstrations in the West Midlands against the Satanic Verses. ‘Recently, I read your book and I couldn’t see what all the fuss was about.’ ‘That’s good’, said Rushdie’ but I should point out that you, who hadn’t read the book, were the person organising the fuss’.<br />Rushdie writes: Literature’s view of human nature encouraged understanding, sympathy and identification with people not like oneself, but the world was pushing everyone in the opposite direction, towards narrowness, bigotry, tribalism, cultism and war. There were plenty of people who didn’t want the universe opened, who would, in fact, prefer it to be shut down quite a bit, and so when artists went to the frontier and pushed they often found powerful forces pushing back.
B0024FAG5I|5.0|It is brand new, as describe. It arrived well protected and before the day expected. The movie case is intact.
B001DJ7PQ4|5.0|The Doctor is at it again! This time the Doctor is bringing along some new and old friends.  Reuniting with former guest star Donna Noble (the humorous Catherine Tate), they begin new adventures with some of the Doctor's greatest enemies that span Earth, Pompeii, the planet of the Ood, Mesalline,  and many new realms of discovery.  The Doctor must also save the planet and friends he loves dearly including Martha Jones (Ayema Freeman) from the Sontarans, and witness the Earth abducted by long thought dead enemy, Dalek creator Davros.  And for any Whovian, Rose Tyler (the stunning Billie Piper) makes several attempts to contact the man she loves from her parallel world setting up for a tear-filled reunion between the pair.<br /><br />A must have!!!!
B00BETX5PS|2.0|Ordered the movie because of good critic reviews. Movie sucked, worst daniel craig movie as bond. Movie lacked good villain and james bond usual swag and womanizing techniques we all love.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|This book was a good conclusion to the hunger games series.<br /><br />It is worth the read. You will enjoy it.
B001NLL93W|5.0|Thank God that ask of this happened. It was so confusing what happens in this book and tragic. I've never cried while reading a book until now.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|This is My new favorite book and favorite author! I'll probably read it again! I definitely recommend if you're interested in a great read!
B004I744AS|5.0|I am truly enjoying this app. Having fun and learning with the games provided. So much better than the old boring dictionary I used in the past.
B007OWRBJK|4.0|Great read for who fans. Tastefully done compared to other rock icon books. Pete Townshend  is a true artist and rock icon.
B000RH0C8G|4.0|Michael Lewis kept me interested with history, facts, but more importantly characters. Looking forward to how it translates to the big screen.
B003B02O14|5.0|John Grisham has csptured me as a reader ever since &#34;The Firm.&#34;  He definitely has developed a sense to keep the reader intrigued, on his toes, and wondering what's on the following pages. This book carries on that tradition. Well done Mr Grisham!
B0083P1QUM|5.0|same as the other one i read and will share with other people and keep putting them on my kindle
B0091REZMW|4.0|l like hidden object games.  Most hog apps are too silly with fairies and mystical creatures.  I like to follow a story and meet goals. This game did both.  Their was no pressure for time but there were also no hints.  I play for relaxation so this game fit my objectives.  I think it would be better if more direction was given during the game.  I kind of felt like I wasn't sure what to do at times. Otherwise, it was  quite enjoyable.  4 stars!
B008IJTFYW|5.0|great app for yoga practices and meditations. I love how many different sounds and melodies it has and how one can combine those that are the best for particular situations. I also like to turn it on whenever I can't sleep, set it on the special mode with waves that put you to sleep and it immediately brings you to the places where you would love to be in your dreams! thanks for this app! I think it is great!
B00B2G4O2G|5.0|I had not seen Kevin Bacon in anything in a while, and have always liked him as an actor.  He is really doing some of his best work for The Following, in my opinion.
B00AECGQF2|5.0|I love the free flowing hair on this version.  Toca Hair Salon was good, Toca Hair Salon 2 is great.
0345803493|5.0|Having been caught up in the first book of the trilogy, I had to read books two and three. I read each book in three days. Most of my friends and relatives won't read the books because of their reputation for S&M. I won't deny that that entity is there plus the most detailed descriptions of sex but the point is that the story is so wonderful. And the humor in the e-mails is great. So<br />I highly recommend the books as light reading for women who want to read a great story who will not be offended by blatant descriptions of sex and who can get through the S&M parts.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|it worked at 1st then when I would click on the app it would show for a lil then right wen I was about to play it would go off.  :/
B003Y5H5HO|5.0|david fincher is tha man ! really awesome take on the already establish trilogy  , super coool , and very intense as well ! love the acting of mara and craig , the tone of the movie was phenomenal !the opening credicts ufff that was cool !
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I was happy to read this since I didn't get to the movie (yes, I do prefer to read the book first, but that is not a requirement). Also, this was my first experience with reading on my Kindle Paperwhite and I enjoyed all of the ways it made reading easy:  light (in weight), even with cover; automatic shut off by closing cover; and automatic at the same place when opened again; lighted; simple to turn pages.  It was a bit harder to find my place when I lost track, but I have figured that out.  I do have more to learn.<br /><br />Now, regarding the book's content:  I enjoyed the characterization and the interplay among the characters as they all worked towards the ending.  My favorite character was the consistently supportive brother.<br /><br />I continue reading hardback and paperback books, as well.
B0081HLM2E|5.0|omgggggggggggggggggggggggg!!!!! loooove this movie sooo much ! the story grabs you by neck nd does not let go ! every actor was on time , specially the photografy in the whole movie ! its was an experience that came raw ! loved it !
B00004Y6NW|5.0|Dire Strait's first Album. Mark Knopfler in my opinion is one of the top 10 guitarist of all time in skill, feel, style, creativity, music writing abilities, and execution. Sultans of Swing which is on this album is a masterpiece of a song.
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|I REALLY enjoy this game. Can be challenging<br />Good entertainment for all family members and friends. I highly recommend it.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Super for the simple tasks.  The first thing I did with it was to reconcile my checking account.  The image was as large as the tablet screen so the numbers were easy to see and hard to miss.  The calculator keeps your entries in memory until you delete them; so it's easy to go back to look for errors.  I would recommend this for general use of a calculator around the house.  I use it often.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I check this out at least three to four times a day. Texas weather is unpredictable and can change in a heartbeat! Very reliable forecasts.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Such a wonderful look at the real challenges of mental illness and the power of the mind. A fantastic read for anyone, but especially Eagles fans, who understand the insanity that cones with loving our team!
B0084IG8TM|5.0|I have seen this movie before. It's a great movie. I bought the DVD as a gift for my girlfriend. She loved it!
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I didn't expect to like the book; too much hype.  However, I found myself quickly wrapped up and enthralled with the characters.
B003EVWDR0|3.0|I love the movie Avatar. It get's 5 stars, but this stream wasn't in HD, I didn't think that was possible, since it was actually filmed in the newest and highest quality of HD. So the stream version gets 3 stars
B0034G4OYA|4.0|The kids loved it,and have watched it several times. Even has some humor that the adults can appreciate. Was a great deal buying online rather then in store.
B001BFFTO0|5.0|I haven't had these very long but I love them. CAUTION! You will look damn sexy wearing these bad boys. Be prepared. They do run a size large as everyone says. I'm a 12 and I got an 11 and they are still a bit big. I haven't worn them out hiking yet because I'm scared to scuff them actually. They are such good looking boots that you just want to wear them every where. Also they are super comfortable and light. This is the most comfortable boot I've worn.
B00003CXBH|5.0|I can't believe more people aren't aware of this film. In my opinion it's  DeNiro\\"s best performance EVER. And I do not say that lightly as I'm a huge DeNiro fan. A glorious film of betrayal and redemption. Shot in South America with all the lush jungles. Visually as well as emotionally stunning. Just PHENOMINAL performances by Robert DiNero and Jeremy Irons. Absolutely one of my top movies of all time. A guaranteed MUST see. No doubt
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is very addicting.... I cant stop playing even if I wanted too lol.... I promise you will love it too :)
B006LSZECO|5.0|kept me reading even when my eyes struggling to stay open, but always a suspenseful spot to leave off when I had to.
B005HSL626|4.0|Lots of slashing fun and great graphics, especially the passion fruit.  This is a great freebie by far, wish they there's more time on the clock.
B006VFLIYK|4.0|This was my first balsamic book and I liked it enough to see if I can find any others with Robie in them.  Easy read.
B001HBYHFA|5.0|I have always loved the works by Joss Whedon but my favorite all time show was Firefly. Even years later I am still in love with the show as strong as I ever was. This movie did as much justice to the short lived series as it could. Leaf on the wind.
B00000ADG2|5.0|i remember bumping this on cassette and cd's i love this whole album you can listen to the whole cd without skipping a song and yes i did say cassette i am telling my age lol
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I think this is one of the best shows on tv right now, it is well crafted, realistically written (for an unrealistic world), its a very human story that has great special affects and a good story line.
B0058RCVYS|5.0|Wonderful film. A very powerful premise, one that makes for interesting surprises throughout. Richly drawn characters, the central five (Jacob, Jorgen, Helene, Anna, Pramod) each tug at our heart in their own way.
B005GFPZYK|1.0|I never did get the book, so I cannot give a good review. I did get the bill promptly. And paid it. Jim hill
B003O86FMW|4.0|This book was unbelievable. Katniss Everdeen has already fought to the finsh.Just when she thinks maybe everything can be a little normal a tragedy happens.Two victors from each district must enter the games...again. Her and Peeta' s love won't keep them alive this time. Districts are rebelling,katniss has a fake baby and Haymitch who they thought they could trust does something that wont be forgiven. If you liked the  hunger games you will want to continue because you cant even imagine how it's gonna turn out
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|great awesome perfect axelerating haert pounding I would give a 5 every time they should make this a playstation 3 game
B00AHSIQWE|3.0|A pretty good sequel with good acting and excellent special effects. Christian Bale again gives a terrific performance as Batman.  Ms. Hathaway is also very good. The rest of the cast does a fine job especially Marion Cotillard. For me the film is just too darn long and at times seems to become some what repetitious. It needed better editing. I also got a little tired of the villain continually beating,  strangling and breaking the neck of everyone he meets. This villain is a one dimensional character if there every was one. This film really needed another villain like the Joker played by the late Heath Ledger. I know this is a cartonish movie but the ending was too ludicrous. Still if you like losts of action and enjoy top quality special effects this is a movie for you.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|I hope a good screenwriter will make it into a better movie then book. Good thread but lacking polish and depth.
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|This is a great film with an amazing performance by Denzel. It captures the spirit of addiction, lies and truth. It has the perfect ending. An ending that I am glad came because any other choice would have been sickening.
B00BBW16HW|5.0|Funny and with heart. I would recommend this movie to anyone. The streaming quality was also very good. Interesting view on this topic.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I love this app. my son cant play it enough. I recommend getting this app. You will regret not getting it.
B0063M22QO|4.0|This Mahjong is better in colors! After five years of black and grey, I can spend<br /> hours of relaxing matching.
B007REV4YI|5.0|This movie did not disappoint and can be watch again!<br />Great James Bond movie and will not disappoint anyone that watches it.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This is great! You dont have to buy gems to use the game. You get free gems all the time. Cute horses. Very well made.
B004SBS8LA|3.0|Please give the option of keeping the power-up bar hidden. It is annoying to have to hide it every time I start or restart a level - it gets in the way, especially since I don't like to use the power-ups.
0345525558|5.0|My book club and I thought this was an amazing, heart-wrenching read. We will never forget Victoria and Elizabeth. The battle for redemption was amazing, and to survive all the hurdles that life brought her took such courage. The ending gave such hope for Victoria, Hazel, and Grant, but it wasn't a fairytale closure, gratefully.
B008LFY6NI|5.0|My youngest granddaughter and I enjoy so much this spin art game. It's fun and exciting to see the vivid colors appear with the touch of a finger. Brings out the creativity in a child.

B000FC1HBY|5.0|This is a great series I cannot put it down, I have downloaded book 3 also now, so with the Kindle I will always be ready
143911000X|4.0|Got this for my husband for our anniversary and he couldn’t love it more. It is a great source of information and funny, some things aren't realistic.
B007THA4FI|3.0|Amazingly written characters. Perhaps there is such a thing as too much detail. Looking forward to Ms Rowling's next book.
B001FVV2X2|5.0|Love Walter !!!!  If It Wasn't For Walter I would Never Watched It. I just love Fringe. I had downloaded the first season and the quality is just SUBURB!!! I had no problems downloading it and had no problems with glitches. I rate this purchase an A great sound too.
B005HJWWW8|5.0|I was talking to my tech friend about audio when he showed me his Fiio E5 and I could hear the difference. I love dubstep and bass heavy music so he reccomended me the E6. I was at first kind of skeptical about paying $30 for an amplifier, but the audio quality improvement is just breathtaking. Instead of just hearing the music, you can feel the music. Especially if you have bass heavy music you can feel the speaker in your headphones pounding away. The natural amplifying setting is great for having a better sounding experience, but when you kick it into the second mode (when the light is red) you can feel the bass pounding in your ears. I have to admit, the E6 doesn't work as well with buds. I use the Premium Hi-Fi DJ Style Over-the-Ear Pro Headphone from monoprice (link:[...]) when listening to music but the Enhanced Bass Hi-Fi Noise Isolating Earphones (link:[...]) work really well too. The amplifier is really worth the money and It makes a huge difference when listening to your favorite tunes.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|Classic story of the poverty, misery, struggles, suffering of people in France in the eighteen hundreds.  Classic story of good over evil.
B003UPPO2G|5.0|Talent is what we had here and they were great right up until the end.  Music is first rate and camera work is also. My only wish  is too have been there and for some of the older songs they had done the complete version. I have always loved the voices together and this just shows that may years haven't changed my feeling about the group. After watching this both of us just said, WOW!
0714834491|5.0|This is a great book. I first borrowed this book from my grad school library after my professor recommended me to read this. After two weeks of reading the bulk of its contents, I purchased one for my own keepsake. It really is a marvelous collection of Mr. Fletcher's brilliant thoughts, art and encounters with unusual events. It greatly saddens me to find out he is no longer alive, but hey, this is a really great book that celebrates his astonishing thought process as a designer. This is the kind of book to keep nearby to entice curiosity and to take a chance and explore a random topic to read about. Also, it serves as a great read in my masters thesis research, contrary to its early statement that it is not a thesis book on anything in particular. Few graphic designers are able to do what Mr. Fletcher has done in this massive collection, which I mean, is that he has inspired my visual thinking process in approaching graphic design and in life. Very, very cool. I think everyone should read this.
B008I3RARW|1.0|The game hard to control cause the screen twist to much it even has 3 opinions your you to chose it race,time and countdown
B00AREIAI8|5.0|my horse is a very fun game with completion and fun games. you can buy different types of horses and clothes.
1442419814|4.0|Can on time. Only got to the beggining but so far this book is interesting but also a little confusing.
B005LAIIHG|5.0|When I first read this book, I stayed up all night to finish it.  And it immediately found it's way onto my top five books list.  I was excited when I heard there was to be a movie, but  I am almost always disappointed.  This movie is the exception.  It is beautifully made and heart wrenching.  That Pi found the final love and good in a tiger, and his care for Richard Parker, and was then able to hand their lives over to his God(s), made my heart swell.  I truly did not think they could capture The Life of Pi in a film, but they did.  What a wonderful surprise.  I wish I could give it some of the stars in the sky, besides the five allowed.
B00BBQXQFI|5.0|This was a great movie! I loved and so did my 3 year old! I loved the lesson it had and has even helped my son sleep at night without being scared. We have watched it three days in a row! It's so cute and just magica! The animation is also amazing. I really don't understand why this movie did not do good in the box office or why it didn't get good reviews..but the critics got it all wrong!!!
B0064BWDRW|5.0|Harry Hole is a very flawed detective but he always gets his man. He also has the greatest mess of a life of any detective I've ever read. He's quite well drawn, quite realistic as a person. This book is hard going emotionally and un-put-down-able at the same time. The drug addicts and dealers that this story revolves around are in every town and city in this world and that makes it realistic and also very sad - but it's a great read. I highly recommend it but do yourself a favour and read the other ones first so you have the whole history. It will make the book much better for you. By the way, there's a very good twist in the tale and it runs right through the book but isn't evident until the very end. So persist....
B00B2V66VS|4.0|well it sometimes doesn't let you open up this app I don't know why but it happened to me this morning
B001KDQ4KQ|4.0|The truth lies somewhere in between. Would recommend this book to anyone who has been a confused teen or has one in the house
B007P06DOK|5.0|So excited to get this after watching a PBS special. Especially enjoyed the extra remarks at the end by Paul Simon.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|I plan to purchase several copies as gifts. The book opens conversations - don't look to it to solve the problem. But more dialogue is needed, and we all need to admit that equality is still a goal, not a fact. I look forward to using this to start conversations - and maybe my own Lean In group!
B004KKX814|1.0|It was a piece of junk. My five year old cried he was so disappointed. It ended up in the garbage.
B00BMVTTJ4|5.0|The lord of the rings series was in epic proportion. I expect that the Hobbit trilogy will be just as good as the Lord of the Rings, if not better. The Hobbit is a great movie, any one who passes this title up, can rest assured knowing that they are missing a great movie to date.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I love this version of Angry Birds. It gives a pleasant new element to the game with the different backgrounds and different &#34;evil&#34; characters.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This is by far the best fiction reading I have ever read! Yes, it is by some people's standards smut reading, however the love story is phenomenal! I truly hope there is a book #4 in the works. Maybe, book #4 could be about Lincoln coming after the Grey's, Elena may re-surface with a revenge plot of some kind. Mia and Ethan's story line didn't have closure. Or on a sour note maybe another woman catches Christian's eye because kids and married life has made their life complacent and Ana has to win him back....just saying. Thank for such an awesome read! Looking forward to reading more books form this author!
B000BISBDY|5.0|Love this album as it has many of my favorites on it. Also liked that when I made the purchase of the album I was immediately able to have the MP3 versions to add to itunes!
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|I loved playing this game, it is super addictive!<br /> I really liked the challenges,  it was hard without being impossible.
B00ABGEFWC|3.0|The Pets are very cute and the game is good for if you have a lot of time to kill.
0061537969|5.0|When I first looked at the title I was like 'meh, it must be about a dog if there's a picture of it.' Well it is a book about a dog, but it's also so much more than that.  The trials and tribulations the people in this book go through had me crying in the end.  I first bought it on the kindle, but decided that it deserved a spot on my bookshelf. That's how much I love this book.
B00BFUC8RC|5.0|This is not a game that you will play for 10 minutes and delete. It is fin, and funny and a good game.
B00A7OIXW6|5.0|I loved this movie and I'm 30 something.  There is a lot from the 80's that little children wouldn't get but regardless my 8 and 10 year old love it as well.  Wonderful graphics and cute story.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This app is great. I love it. It is great for people who really love horses like me and my sister. We love how we can enter the horse in competitions. I recommend this app to everyone.
B0023AO5JC|5.0|There isn't anything I don't like in this film. Everything is<br />put together &#34;right&#34;. It's captivating from the first moment.
B003O86FMW|5.0|after  book  one, couldn't wait to start book two.  story line continues without any hiccups.  holds interest well.  book three should be great also.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|The ending was disappointing, not how I wanted it, or how I thought it should have been. However it was an exciting book to read, it got better towards the end, drawing you in.
B0067TGSOK|5.0|Great book  that has  ideas  to help start your business .  Since  I have recently retired, it will be easy to try something and see if it works. Input for kindle Fire builders- add an easy to find button that DISABLES every automatic text function. Just when I had this problem fixed, its back. Automatically completing the wrong word is especially annoying.
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|This is a good game just because there is pictures on the review app thing this still is a game. I highly recommend you to get this game if you want a good slender game. Watch out for slender!
B0049J2BSM|4.0|Great movie. Had to watch it again. It only gets better the more you watch it. I would rent it again.
B00846F1YW|4.0|Great game! Really enjoy the different levels and the different puzzles included in the game! Would recommend this game to others.
B005FISC52|5.0|I freaking love this show, they should continue to put these out b because I'm sure all the die hard fans will continue to purchase these from Amazon.
B0061PEAUY|5.0|Though it is frustrating to have read yet another book in which Tempe makes no progress in her personal relationships, the story was good.  The baby story was a bit hard to take and the resolution of that seemed rushed.  I did like the bigger plot behind it all, to me that was what both saved and made the book.  I learned new things (as I always do when reading Kathy Reichs) and found my curiosity awakened about other things as well.  This novel  is worth buying and let me just say to the author (right! Like she is reading MY thoughts! Lol) I sincerely hope your next book finds Tempe some personal happiness and you release the book earlier than August!  I want the next story!!
1439163146|5.0|In all seriousness, I really did enjoy this book. While it may seem like it was written poorly to some people. I thought it was perfect. The stories in the book are all pretty fantastic. I could not put the book down and I read it pretty fast. It was highly enjoyable, graphic, detailed, disturbing, and funny at-times. It could become a cult classic sometime in the future when it becomes well known, but right now, it's underrated and it's excellent. Franco, I'm ready for more books!
B00BMVTS1S|5.0|While there were a few times that the pace slowed, overall the story was still engaging and the settings were literally magical.  To see The Hobbit come to life on film is something I have waited for since I was a 4th grader reading the book for the first time.  I liked the inclusion of Radagast the Brown and the White Council.  These kinds of little story additions were fun.  Another strong aspect of the movie was its action scenes.  The showdown with Azog was awesome.  And finally, dwarf women conclusively have beards!  Now all is well in Middle-Earth!
B00992CF6W|5.0|Nice, but i think it should have EVERYTHING that the pc and xbox version has. But i Still doesn't beat ROBLOX.
B005KAH7QU|3.0|This movie was poorly written, directed, and choreographed.  There were quite a few incongruous fight scenes and choices that were forced upon the actors.  Choices like: taking the time to put your victim on a carousel to just spin him around all-the-while knowing that your nemesis is nearby and you were trained to be careful, efficient and precise.  Choices like: being a ruthless killer and not having a weapon when you know you would be needing one, and choices like running away from your victim when you know you have the upper hand in position and firepower. There are too many other sloppy directorial choices to mention.  The writers also added \\"filler\\" and scenes, that so contrast with the theme and the plot, they continually \\"throw\\" you out of the movie and make you constantly reminded that \\"Hollywood\\" was very much in play during the whole production of this thing.  You can just see it going through the actors' minds:  \\"Oh, my God, he wants me to do what now?\\" What sophomoric writers came up with this script? If Cate and Eric hadn't been in this movie, I don't think any one would have seen it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is so cool i would recommend this to temple run fans.you can also compare scores to your facebook friends.For the price it is so good,which is free.
B009X01GJ2|5.0|So far, so good.  I am very pleased with this case.  I particularly like the black elastic band that holds the Kindle shut when not in use.  I was concerned that the automatic on/off feature wouldn't work properly when bumped or dropped etc, but the band is great, holds it snugly closed.  I took my Kindle with me to a doctor's appointment to read while I waited (and don't we always have to wait?).  I got lots of envious looks!
B005N0PJJO|5.0|This series of books were very enjoyable to read and kept you in suspense and wondering what was going to happen next.

0385349947|1.0|This book is the latest and greatest example of the destructive notion that everything in the world can be changed to suit the selfish longings of every appetite, inclination or, as is too often the case, envy. It is a refusal to acknowledge that some things in life are not alterable or even understandable. In other words, sometimes the \\"why?\\" of life cannot be understood. (Perhaps because it would obviate the very purpose of existence?)<br /><br />One such why is why men and women are different? There are many others. The fact is we are all different: the races, the sexes, you name it. Every individual is a unique collection of potentialities.  Those potentialities are expressed by exercising the only respect in which we are the same: self-conscious beings with Free Will.<br /><br />Can some human-induced inequities be addressed? Of course. Yet it seems every time a movement like feminism is successful in righting obvious wrongs, like giving women the right to vote, it always has adverse unintended consequences. (No pun intended, but in this case it is like throwing out the baby with the bath water.)<br /><br />The sad result has been the devaluation of motherhood. Women today have been brainwashed to believe that they should be men--not have similar rights but be exactly like men in every respect. Of course this is absurd and will never be true. But the fantasy results in another instance of liberal/progressive delusion--thinking that simply declaring something to be true or changing the name of something changes the nature of the thing itself. (\\"... That which we call a rose by any other name would smell as sweet.\\")<br /><br />So, to believers like Sheryl Sandberg, women are always the equal of men in every instance, in every capacity. Unfortunately, therein lies the implied corollary that the reverse is also true: men can be everything women can be, including being mothers, if not physically then in every other respect. And do the job just as well. But when affirmative-action narratives like this involve \\"adjusting\\" the standards so as to allow formerly unqualified candidates to be deemed acceptable, as they always do, then the immutable inherent inequality is confirmed. Sadly, to the detriment of our children and by extension to all of human society.<br /><br />The quote below is from the FAQ link on the Web site for the novel Second Eden, which some have excoriated because of the common-sense enduring truths it espouses, especially when it comes to the role of women. Worth thinking about.[[ASIN:0595316530 Second Eden]]<br /><br />Q. Some think the book is anti-feminist. What do you say to that?<br /><br />A. \\"I prefer to think it's pro-motherhood. After all, Molly is an accomplished physician and scientific researcher, but her dream is to be a married mother. The book doesn't denigrate the role of women; to the contrary, it exalts the unique role of women. We in America seem to have forgotten that only a woman can be a mother. Only a woman can have that singular, bio-chemically-based bond with an infant that is denied to men. The bond depends, interestingly enough, on smell; it's imprinted at birth, so another woman cannot fulfill the unique role that the birth mother has been given. Too many people today have bought into the lie that children are little adults that can be raised no differently than domesticated animals, on the equivalent of farms by hired hands; in other words, it doesn't matter whose hands those are. Women have bought into the lie that motherhood is not only not a worthy career but that it is not as valuable--nor as valued--as traditional male careers.\\"
B009YP9L7U|4.0|This was an easy book to read. It was fun and  kept things moving along pretty well. I`d recommend it!! Enjoy!

B0072GPQNG|5.0|I saw War Horse the first time at the movies.  Then I ordered this CD because I just had to have this movie.  It is so very good.  The movie .  War Horse is terrific.  I recommend this highly.
B002X9GX4S|5.0|this band has a unique sound.  def theatrical metal, but at the same time very mild distortion tones make their sound standout
044024630X|5.0|As always, Lee Child does not disappoint, Jack Reacher is kick ass and bad to da bone! The bad guys never get ahead of him.
B00BK5D95C|5.0|From the layered vocals to the unique synth and rhythmic grooves...acoustic guitars..to the catchy hooks, this album has something that can appeal to a wide range of music fans.
B002J2PB10|5.0|This Is One Of My Favorite Tarantino Movie. Love The Transition From Vintage Look To Modern Times Movie. Great Storyline, Acting, Shooting, And Production.
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|it is reminiscent of asteroids but its unique gameplay is really catching. The graphics are very impressive as well. I highly recommend it.
B006M7JCC2|5.0|This is the most eye opening book I have ever read.  For the last 8 or so years I have read a lot of spiritual books looking for answers.  They have all helped me immensely in my journey but I have to say that I was never able to master the concept although knowing it to be true.  I just didn't know how to utilize what I learned.  She is very clear in that direction and I feel as though I have finally found the answer on how to do this.  I want to read this book over and over again as to keep it clear in my mind and never to forget or lose my focus as to where it needs to be.  On our center.
1476733953|5.0|Absolutely amazing. I kid you not when I say that this stacks up with some of the best books i've ever read (right up there with Foundation, Dark Tower)...i seriously couldn't put it down. I kept reading so long at a coffee shop that I got a ticket for parking there over 2 hours. If you don't buy this book then sorry for ya, you are missing out on one hell of a read:)
B00633W614|5.0|An amazing novel. I can't wait for the next in the series. A very enjoyable read that I strongly recommend.
B005HSL626|4.0|we love it.  Totally fun for ages 6-40!  My son and husband think it is so fun!  Easy to play too.
B00BEZTMFY|4.0|I don't care if its a directors cut or not, I just want the movie that we all saw in the theaters and loved.  I was going to go directly to Wal Mart and get this on Tuesday, but then I found out on their website that Wal mart is demanding $3 more for the same item. And I have to burn up gas, drive there, and stand in line to get it.  That's when I said no way, Im buying it on Amazon. I have a prime account so its not only free shipping, they say it will be here on the official release date , Tuesday.  But I think as we all have learned by now Amazons shipping delivery dates are not the most accurate, so I can only hope its here on Tuesday. But even if I have to wait a couple days I will for $3 difference.  After all, its only a movie. Not like its critical life saving or vital to ones survival. and in this day and age, 3 bucks is 3 bucks.<br /><br />once again amazon's promise delivery date is a farce.  When I ordered this they said get it by Tuesday, the 19th.  Today I received an email saying earliest delivery date now is the 20th, and that it was just shipped out tonight ( Monday) at 6:47pm.  But I ordered it on March 15th. Have to wonder about those 2 day prime membership delivery promises.  Heck, have to wonder about all the delivery date promises.  Saving the $3 bucks seemed good when I believed what Amazon promised, now, not so for sure.  I could drive to walmart even tonight at midnight if I wanted, or tomorrow anytime, get it for $17, and be watching it with my family.<br />I should know by now not to believe what Amazon tells you for delivery times.
0345803507|5.0|My husband wanted to see what all the hype was about, so I order all 3 for him. I read when I get time.
B001IYCMNA|1.0|After more than a year and many upgrades and tweaking and factory resets, I gave up. The device has two problems, the first is more important than the second.<br /><br />My setup at home is as follows: I have5 laptops, 4 iPads, 10 mobiles (iPhones/various androids and a blackberry)<br />I have a 100MB fiber connection @home. The Cisco AP is connected to my router through a Cisco PoE switch.<br /><br />Here the problems:<br />1- The most annoying thing is the fact that I HAVE to reboot it every other day. It could be that too many devices get connected to this router. But that's why I bought business-class AP not a cheap one!<br />2- The less annoying problem is the fact that my 9780 Blacberry can't see the AP! not matter what I do it won't recognize it. MY BB can connect to any WiFi network I through at it, but not mine!.<br /><br />So, I wouldn't recommend this AP, or any other Cisco product.<br /><br />------------------<br />Update Apr 19 2013<br />------------------<br /><br />I needed another AP since I started using the basement and the signal down there is very weak. So, today I went and bought a TP-Link AP (TL-WA801ND) for $38. I compared the two (TP-Link TL-WA801ND vs Cisco WAP4410N). The result was surprising.<br /><br />1- iPad 1: Connects to Cisco AP but very slow and many timeouts. Connects to TP-Link and very fast with zero timeout.<br />2- Laptop (Toshiba with Atheros N modem): With Cisco AP I get 65Mbps air interface speed which translate to between 22Mbps-25Mbps on speedtest.net. With TP-Link I get 150Mbps air interface speed and I get between 80Mbps-83Mbps on speedtest.net. Wow, almost wireline speed.<br />3- Blackberry: Doesn't see the Cisco AP, I have to program it manually and connect manually every time I arrive back to home.  TP-Link AP, picked the AP SSID and were able to reconnect automatically whenever I'm back within range.<br />4- Galaxy Nexus: Connected to Cisco AP gives me between 4Mbps-5Mbps on speedtest.net, Connected to TP-Link AP Igot between 5Mbps-6Mbps on speedtest.net<br /><br />So, bottom line, I'm so happy with my new TP-Link AP. I'm really astonished that such a \\"cheap\\" AP can beat the the hell out of the expensive Cisco. The only downside, TP-Link doesn't support PoE, not big deal since in the basement I'm OK with that.<br /><br />Cheers
B00BESM14U|1.0|This preview leads you to believe it will be a great teenage coming of age film, even with some humor. Turns out it is just depressing where you spend the ENTIRE movie worried the main character is going to OFF himself!<br />So- here we go, child abuse, suicide, drugs, and domestic violence. Yipee!<br />I SOOOOOO want my two hours back!!!!~!!!!
B001BKVWYG|5.0|Excellent, Dylanesque lyrics.<br /><br />Voice clear and a reminiscent mixture of James Taylor & Jim Croce but unique BEFORE they were famous, and occasionally wisps of Dylan, but not a ripoff.  Again, original.<br /><br />Some of the recording production is at once dated (some of the effects and string accompaniment) but also so well recorded for the vocals and placement that it's classic, timeless.<br /><br />You get this impression that it's going to be cliche folk, but then it's much more chordally interesting.  Very 70's Singer Songwriter.  On par with Carol King, Taylor, Croce, etc, songwriting-wise.  Then it's chords can sometimes be so pleasant in their progression, but the lyrics are based in reality and Rodriquez gives an occasional verbal zinger.  In other words, not formulaic.  Given that this was 1970, it's ahead of it's time.<br /><br />Somehow all the songs hang together as an album, but the songs are very different from each other.<br /><br />Not one bad song.  Such a talent.<br /><br />Wow.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|I don't think this book is as good as his others.  I have read all but this doesn't do it for me
B001TCHDPS|5.0|Rodriquez is ridiculously talented as a songwriter.<br /><br />These songs seem to flow effortlessly.  Lyrically masterful, melodically wonderful, musically classical 70's pop folk/rock, great arrangements.<br /><br />I really liked his first album.  Spare with some strange effects and a bit dated in that regard.  But this album, just 2 years later sounds fully arrived with Bass guitar and superb electric playing.<br /><br />I really like Rodriquez's haunting and beautiful acoustic playing on some tracks.  He's always able to evoke a mood, these are heartfelt songs, not contrived in any sense.<br /><br />There's no words to describe this album worthy of this album.  You just gotta stop reading and LISTEN to this album.<br /><br />Just a strong performance from everyone from vocals to musicians to engineering and production.  wow.  Has to be one of the best Singer Songwriter albums I've ever EVER heard.  Easily on par with Blood on the Tracks.  Easily.
0385536828|2.0|I find the main character, Serena Frome, is one of the most superficial, shallow, indecisive, boring, self-pity fictional character I've ever read. Through out the stories, we see her complaining constantly and hook up with almost every guy she encountered and that bothers me. And I utterly don't think she fit an intelligence job.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a fun little game. Nice graphics. It is a good relaxing time spent playing the game. I am hooked.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|I'm only half-way through season two but I've already made up my mind that it is absolutely fantastic.  All of the characters have been meticulously analyzed and rendered in a way that makes complete sense, without going overboard.  And,  in spite of what some people might think, I can assure you that the relationships between the lords and ladies of the house and their staff is accurately portrayed. ( We are talking here about the true aristocrats who know when to put their rank aside to do their duty/the right thing when it is called for.)  Hats off to Julian Fellowes for creating such beautiful story.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|I make regular transcontinental trips, which gets rather tedious. But the last wo months travel was transformed into something I looked forward to by the discovery of this series. I got season 1 and 2 and couldn't wait for my next flight so I could see more episodes. I just want more. Looking forward to season 3. The characters are amazing. You will love them, hate them, feel their victories and defeats, and mourn in their inevitable demise. The material is not appropriate for all eyes, with graphic violence and frequent nudity. I recommend a window seat if you want to watch this on a plane.
B004QX07G4|1.0|would not recommend.  learn how to write!!  Would prefer to get my money back and see what other readers say!  Seriously, I was just kidding!!!
B008I3RARW|3.0|its an ok game its made to be almost retro but its generic cheaply made and need better control would recommend it to first time gamer

B00BLGZDVS|4.0|Everyone involved in this movie was willing to take a risk and it's good to see that they pulled it off so well.
B008LZHA3G|5.0|Loved Bob Dylan since the mid-sixties.<br /><br />He went electric, I wasn't sure about that.<br /><br />Turned out to be a creative turning point for the better.<br /><br />Some good rocking tracks on here.<br /><br />I liked it a lot.
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|Keeps my attention.  Great graphics. Reasonably priced. Easy to navigate. I would recommend this game highly. It's simple enough for my 9 year old grandson to figure out and enjoy, yet complicated enough for me to enjoy.

B007REV4YI|5.0|When I got this film I was shocked to see how good it was. I have been a Bond fan for as long as I can remember and watching this film made me think of watching the Bond films as a kid. I was hearing that this was a great film but I was nervous to see it because the last film, Quantum of Solace, I really didn't like so when I saw this I loved it even more.
B00BP4Z8XY|4.0|Frankly, there were no surprises in this movie but it was a fine way to spend an hour and 3/4.<br />This was the first movie I've rented from Amazon and that was easy.
B0014J8D9Q|5.0|I bought this movie to add to my collection of classics, as Hollywood just do not seem to turn these out with any abundance anymore.<br /><br /> Although the movie builds slowly to a climax, once the premise of the movie is set and we know the characters, the total transformation of the Eastwood character from a benevolent person to a violent criminal becomes complete. As Eastwood always does, he will place a colleague in a supporting role to enhance the movie, in this case, Richard Harris.  A must have, as you know, they do not make them like this anymore!

B005K17RU0|5.0|Really like having this because I can just pulled it up and find out what to expect.  so far it has been very accurate at lease I know what to expect and not get a surprise.
B006M7JCC2|5.0|I love this book.  It really makes you think about what is important in life.  After reading the book one must consider what their purpose really is.
B00881VLCE|5.0|I love doing  puzzles and when I'm waiting and need something to keep me occupied this is the one because they are small puzzles and helps pass the time.

B0063IH60K|5.0|When I don't want anything that will take a long time to do I play this game, it is fun and at times it is hard to get a win but it makes it like you were playing with a deck of cards which it what I like.
B0038P80CO|5.0|Did anyone else feel that the first half hour or so seemed like it was Breaking Bad set in space? Totally felt like a Walter White-Jesse Pinkman dynamic (and Barrow even looked like Aaron Paul at times!) But seriously - well done film, which appropriately balanced suspense and plot twists with a healthy dose of human psychology and the perils and uncertainty of hypothetical space travel. The increasing dread of the dangers on board corresponds perfectly with the slowly revealed details of what has and will happen on the ship. Unlike so many other films of the genre, it doesn't have just one key plot twist at the end but all throughout; it also succeeds in getting to understand the psychological motivations of characters, even when their appearance in the film is relatively brief. Recommended!
B00BMUYLSE|4.0|I love half of the songs on this cd and the other half I thought were okay. The first few songs on the cd are the best.

1451696191|5.0|It's always tricky reading a novel after seeing the movie, especially when the movie was one of your favorite films of the year. 2012, despite all the incredible \\"best-of\\" films (DJANGO, ARGO, LES MIZ et al) my favorite film was THE PERKS OF BEING A WALLFLOWER, a film whose book version somehow had avoided me for thirteen years. I had picked up the book last fall and at the urging of a co-worker read it despite the idea of not wanting to tarnish my remembrance of the excellent film. That was a worry that came to naught. Author Stephen Chbosky faithfully adapted his own novel into the film, keeping the vision intact. WALLFLOWER is an epistolary novel of a year in the life of Charlie, an intelligent, emotionally fragile high school freshman, who falls in with a group of fellow travelers in 1991. His friends Sam and Patrick navigate him through the tunnels of drugs, sex and friendship, countering Charlie's sometimes emotionally distant family. The memories of his Aunt Helen, who died a decade earlier, are still a continuous source of confusion and sorrow. As the novel opens we understand that Charlie has been in a psychiatric facility after the suicide of a close friend. The book picks up as Charlie writes (and mails) letters about his daily life to an unknown (to us) person. I had just finished watching the run of FREAKS AND GEEKS for the third time when I started this book, so the stress of high school life was already in my head, and this book is similar, with less comedy of course; the stress of being in high school is a feeling that I remember, and navigating those years looking in instead of out is an emotion perfectly captured by Chbosky. Charlie is fortunate that an English teacher takes an interest in his intelligence and through the year loans him books to read, books with protagonists like Atticus Finch and Holden Caulfield, recognizing his intelligence and furnishing him with a window to a larger world. (I had a great teacher who loaned me THE LOVE YOU MAKE which opened my perspectives as well.) The book is apparently a \\"young adult\\" novel, but the themes approached by Chbosky are relatable to all of ages, and though I came of age a decade before Charlie I found it a truly moving experience.which opened my perspectives as well.)

B00AK0X5VQ|4.0|As you start the game, you are a little blue orb. Then you slowly grow though out all the levels.<br />there are a few catches, if shoot a lot of &#34;movement beads&#34; you start to shrink.<br />Then orbs that once might have been smaller then you, are now getting bigger.<br />And that is just about the whole game.<br />So if you like the first level of Spore or &#34;feeding frenzy&#34; = Great game.<br />But if you look for more action got to find it in other places

B00BHU2A7I|3.0|What a quaint little movie. Anthony Hopkins is totally immersed in the Hitch role, but the female cast stole the film (or maybe I‘m being biased about 4 actresses I can‘t get enough of). Might not be as interesting for someone oblivious to Hitchcock's work, but a must for his fans.

0199235694|5.0|I am currently in Japan and this book is very helpful and makes things around me easier to understand<br />Great!
B0028MBKVG|5.0|If you are thinking about running read this first. It will help<br />Eye opening and amazing this will help discover your inner runner.
B007ZUTNF6|5.0|A fantastic book that totally changes the way you look at the nature of reality...some of the information in this book is mind blowing and a real eye-opener...it`s a must read!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|My horse makes it feel like you have your own horse! You care for it, clean it, and play with it! Great getaway from the world game! For all ages!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Great reading. I really enjoyed this book and have started the Mocking Jay now.  It is a very entertaining series.
B000IZA9NK|4.0|Is what i give this movie...its a redo of the 60's with 60's ideas of things, i just watch the movie for its enjoyment. Miss Penny or whatever her name is...is irritataing!!!! But just when the movie is about over she shows some more character, thank God! I would love to see a modern version of this story.
B00BLGXL3U|5.0|It is quite telling that Hollywood and many reviewers (critics and viewers) do not get this film. Because this is not your mainstream entertainment and not meant to make you feel good, but meant to ask hard questions and most do not want to deal with that. I thought it was the best movie of the year, much better than any other that Oscars were awarded too (cannot even compare). Brilliant acting and directing.
B0037VNX44|3.0|Kept my interest up the whole way...bear in mind that Bonson is the 'Most Violent Prisioner' amongst other things. Like the 'Most Expensive Prisioner' which should be the 'Most Destructive Prisioner' but one does hurt more than the other...
B009UX2YAC|5.0|One of the best apps I've ever had I highly recommend it I love this app so much and they're always getting new AMAZING updates
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Many good things about this app... great graphics, cool moves, etc. But there's one thing about the kindle fire version. The leaning stuff, where you have to tilt the kindle to get coins is very slow, and I always feel like I'm over tilting. But it's a little thing. I still totally recommend this game.
B0098460O4|4.0|These kids have great voices. I would like to hear more non-classical songs. I  know they can sale more albums with their beautiful music.
B005COO1X6|3.0|Typical King with kids, good vs. evil and the gross out. If your a fan (and I am) you'll enjoy it, if not you'll probably  pass on it. This is just King throwing a tidbit to his fans while they await his next novel.
B009RI4FRU|4.0|Every heterosexual boy (other sexual orientations and identifications can speak to their own dreams, and chaste lusts), every heterosexual boy in Frank Jackman's  old corner boy working- class neighborhood anyway in oceanside Hullsville just outside of Boston, when he came of age, maybe at twelve maybe a little older  (rule of thumb for coming of age: when he saw those same elementary school classmate girls, or a stray girl or two around the neighborhood who went to private school, hell, really Catholic school in that neighborhood and thus even more exotic, that the previous year were nothing but distractions and nuisances to a corner boy orderly world had magically become, well, interesting) had his dreams of  finding his fair Rosamund and taking her, and them far away from the dreary day to day madnesses that they both faced. Taking that fair damsel drenched in some Sir Walter Scott medieval knightly romance saga from, you know, the endless parent civil wars traps, the other guys, your so-called best corner boy friends, who had no time for girls trying to cut your time trap, the school madnesses and assorted villainous teachers and other authorities trap, and worse, worse the raging hormonal (homicidal?) madnesses trap. And while in those days, those halcyon 1950s days, when it was a very close thing indeed whether we collectively of the earth would blow ourselves to kingdom come that dream, that Frank Jackman dream, looked and felt something like this movie set a decade later.
0425252868|5.0|I've read many books about World War II and about the air war in Europe in particular.  This book stands out for it's amazing insights into the nature of the young men who flew on both sides, the problems they faced, and the courage that it took to do what they did.  I was deeply moved by the particular event around which the book is based, the chivalrous sparing of a wounded enemy.<br /><br />This was the author's first book.  Based on the detailed and straightforward character of the writing, the meticulous research that provided the background, and the gift for imagery displayed, I predict a great writing career for him.
B0073TZ1AA|1.0|This app did not function at all.  It only read page numbers on a textbook style pdf.  A complete waste of money.
B009RI4FRU|1.0|This movie was the worst movie I have EVER SEEN! I cannot figure out why everyone seems to like it! The plot did not make sense, and the characters were just strange. Everyone is entitled to their opinion so don't complain about me loathing this movie.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|A friend of mine pointed me toward watching Downton Abbey......and now I can't stop!  I finished the first two seasons so quickly, that I had to purchase the third season.
B00B3EVNEE|4.0|Robin's guitar playing is superb as always. The arrangements he made for these songs make them his own and shows the respect he has for the blues.
B008220C56|5.0|This piece of art faithfully and imaginatively recreated the novel, and embellished the themes and style of the original to the point that the copy became better than the original; in many ways our society of simulacrum demands and gets reproductions without a comparable original, images which enhance our fantastic hyperreality- don't you agree? I loved the flow of the imagery, and the ways it blended space and time seamlessly. If some of the flesh was excised from the book, so be it. The meat is still there.<br />If there are as many minds as there are heads, then there must be as many forms of love as there are hearts.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Lot's of twists, just when you are sure you know what is going to happen, it changes.<br />A really interesting perspective.
1427210241|5.0|The readers are so excellent.  The story is so good.  The characters memorable forever.  What a marvelous book!  BEST BOOK AND AUTHORS EVER!!!
B001UGB1X8|5.0|I was prepared to not like this movie. Boy, was I ewver surprised.<br />It is one of Tommy Lee Jones best.
B007REV4T8|5.0|This is movie magic! Daniel Craig is the best Bond ever, and I began with Sean Connery. The world travels will transport you as never before, and the little inside joke at the end caps off the best Bond romp to date! This is truly what movies are made for.
B00BMCLCG6|5.0|30 years of music continues and it doesn't disappoint.  Just good ol' rock and roll from Jon and the guys!
B008I3RARW|2.0|I guess. I would have been very disappointed had I paid for it. As everyone else said, it's very basic, three game modes, but only one track, it was a fun track but the Ai wasn't very good and half way around the track on the first lap I was already 5 seconds ahead and it just got worse from there . Couldn't tell any difference between the different colored cars so I guess that's just aesthetics. Was fun for about 10 min but I'm already uninstalling it
B001CDZZI6|3.0|I purchased this book based on reccomendations from people at the college I was working at several years ago. I wasn't as impressed as they were. it was OK but not great.
B004SUDQ8Q|5.0|This is a very good movie. I would recommend it to anybody who likes true stories. The little girls were very good actresses.
0446554995|4.0|I half way thru it and am entirely mesmerized.  I do hope, however, that this one actually ends, unlike the last two.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Good game but I don't know how to update it an  I would like to so some one help please.
B0033H7VI6|1.0|I was excited when I received the Schrade SCHF9 via USPS in only one day.  Great job there.<br /><br />I took the knife out of it's packaging and loved the feel of it.  It has a great big beefy Kraton handle sandwiching a 1/4 inch of 1095 steel. It had great balance, and I was looking forward to using it.  And, that's pretty much where the good feelings started to fade.<br /><br />The first thing I noticed was that the \\"grind line\\" (which is the line where the first bevel starts as you move toward the cutting edge/edge bevel) is higher on one side than the other.  So much so that it causes the cutting edge to be lopsided.  In fact, the grind line is straight until it nears the end on one side, and sort of re-curves on the other. I also noticed that the point of the knife, when viewed on edge from the spine, was poorly milled.  The primary bevel almost looks like it is hollow ground on one side and flat on the other. As another reviewer put it: instead of /\ it's more like )\.<br /><br />I tested the knife on a piece of 20lb. printer paper and it simply didn't cut it for the first six or seven attempts. On the eighth try the result was a rather short and jagged cut.  This didn't really bother me. Not all knives come with a great edge so I gave it a quick hone which seemed to only help a little.  If I don't return it I will try to put a whole new edge on the blade.  The other thing I noticed as I ran the knife bevel between my thumb and forefinger was that the thickness was very uneven as in undulated between thicker and thinner a number of times.  Also the spine of the knife is not flat. It too undulates.<br />I tried notching a piece of 1x1 inch pine and my disappointment was complete.  It did notch the wood, but with more effort than my other knives.<br /><br />I'm not a perfectionist, but I don't want to have to rework a tool right out of the box to get what I should have gotten in the first place.<br /><br />I really wanted to like this knife and tried to talk myself into it, but the amount of work it will need seems unreasonable.  I know that the SCHF9 is a relatively inexpensive knife, but I have gotten more bang-for-the-buck from other knives.  This may have been a reject that fell through the cracks.  If so I'll keep the next one.  If not, then Schrade has a product with great potential, but poor QC.<br /><br />***I wrote the following two months ago and for whatever reason never posted it.  I apologize for the delay.<br /><br />Update 3/22/2013: Let me say this.  Amazon has been absolutely fantastic about everything from delivering this product super fast to providing timely, cooperative and professional customer service.  They have in fact been all over this issue.  I filed to returne the Schrade SCHF9 Extreme Survival Knife to Amazon and received the new one before I even got to send the new one back.<br /><br />As for the replacement knife, It had the same exact issues, but to a lesser degree.  The same grind issues, the same slightly offset point, the same edge issues but, all to a much lesser degree.  In fact, I wonder how much I would have noticed them if not for my experience with the first knife.  So now I'm left wondering if this was a batch issue.<br /><br />As I said in my original review I really wanted to like this knife, so I decided to try one more time.  But, by this time the knife was out of stock and was indeed difficult to find anywhere on-line.  A very professional Amazon rep told me that they would prioritize my order when the new ones were delivered to them.  It wasn't long before they received the new batch.  I was informed that they would not send me a replacement because upon inspection the new knives had the same problem.  I got my refund and that's how the story ends.<br /><br />Again, I can't stress how great Amazon was about handling my concerns.  Thank you Amazon.self into it, but the amount of work it will need seems unreasonable.

B0054JZC6E|5.0|These games are challenging like old school video games and fun for a few minutes it takes to play.  A nice diversion.
B004FWXKXS|5.0|Not just survival of the elements, but from man as well. The bear is by far the best part, keeping you on THE EDGE. Hopkins makes you want to cheer him on the whole ride and I'd say this is Baldwin at his best. If you like things out in the woods or not, this is a great movie!
B000FCKGPC|3.0|A whole lot of characters, very little plot advancement over the course of 800+ pages. I finally gave in and started skimming over paragraphs here and there where I knew the story line and people just didn't matter at all.<br /><br />Martin gives an excuse at the end that the book was too huge and had to be divided into another volume. It should have been edited into a single volume to increase the pace and focus.<br /><br />Not sure how excited I am to start the next installment since he's set it up to be more of the same slog.
B006Z00R1Q|5.0|I must admit that I like this series, now that I have saw them all I can't wait to see 5.
B001KNVJDI|2.0|I paid very good money for this item and expected it to be brand new since that's how it was advetised.  The outer sleeve looked just fine but when I looked at this disc itself it had several light scratches and marks on the playing surface, like it had been previously owned and then returned.  Could possibly be a manufacturing issue, but it looked to me like it had been 'handled'.  Unfortunately this is a very hard disc to find, so I went ahead and kept it.
B00821PCJS|4.0|This is a very interesting series, that depicts life as it could be if the whole world was invaded. It is - for sure - inspired by the latest invasions throughout the world, by different countries, that are oppressing others.<br /><br />It shows what we - the human race - would do to save our world, and how we interact with each other.<br /><br />It is worth watching.
0061537969|5.0|I read a lot but seldom write reviews - this is one book for which I felt compelled to  do so.  The story told by Enzo the dog draws you in, as does Enzo himself.  It is such a unique perspective and the message is deeper than the story.  This book is a real gem and will forever remain on the list of one of my all time favorites.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I would recommend this to anyone over 20. The story is substantive and realistic. It kept me always anticipating the next episode. (Do I really now have to wait for an entire year?) It is beautifully filmed. In short why can't there be more TV Shows and movies of this caliber?
B0083TXXZ4|4.0|These definitely have a higher dart capacity as compared to most nerf guns, but the velocity might be a little too high. Not good for short range. Owwwww!
B0055X6V4Q|5.0|One of the best reads EVER.  The journeys of all the characters were believable and full of life lessons without being trite nor maudlin.  I would recommend this to any reader.
B00A8ECU24|3.0|My daughter and I love my little pony! This is a fun game, and the graphics are pretty good, they prices are too high! They say it's free play but they give you quests that you can't complete without buying gems.
B003O86MY8|5.0|Very exciting, interesting and entertaining music!  Definitely worth the money.  We bought another one of his CDs.  Who would of thought rock music would sound so good on a violin?
B008LY9AWG|5.0|I loved reading Connelly's short stories.  You get maximum twist in one sit down reading!  I hope he publishes more of these short stories for Kindle, because I would sure buy them again.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|Clarity is the what everyone who attempts to publish a great book and &#34;Building Your Book for Kindle&#34; banishes the any cloud of understanding &#34;exactly&#34; what you have to do to accomplish your goals of this task. Lost is not one of those places anyone wants to be when I am wanting to get my work into the public domain. I love writing and appreciate the clear guidelines and this is certainly a book well intended to help all of the authors of this world. I believe on-line publishing, especially with Kindle is not only part of the ascending change of convenience - it is a necessity in our ever-changing modern &#34;Going-Green&#34; faster paced world, and so we can relax and feel comfortable and stay attuned with it. Great book, an absolute, Thank You!
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|Sparks weaves a believable tale of love, laughter, pain, and loss into a story that will leave readers wishing the book was not over.  Sweet, passionate, and deeply emotional.
B00B23O96A|5.0|This is some vintage Clapton!!  Track 4\\" Gotta Get Over\\" is a guitar driven rocker with Chaka Khan sharing the vocals with Eric and this song rocks! Great guitar with some \\"wah wah\\". So nice to hear Chaka Khan vocals on an Eric Clapton song.  \\"All Of Me\\" is Paul Mcartney on upright bass and vocals and this song is really a treat to listen to.  But my favorite is \\"Still Got The Blues\\" this has beautiful Hammond  B3 Organ played by Steve Winwood along with some fantastic acoustic guitar, also some gorgeous string arrangements. All of this builds to a climax with some of the best Clapton guitar work of his long career.  The solo at the end of this song is GREAT!!  Eric is way down on the fret board hitting those notes that sound like the Clapton we all know and love. The musicians are all top notch, Willie Weeks, Paul Mcartney, Taj Mahal, Steve Winwood,Jim Keltner,J.J.Cale, Chris Stainton and many more. The vocals by Clapton are top notch and heartfelt. Chaka Khan, Julie,Ella, and Sophie Clapton add some great vocals as well.  I have been a fan of Eric Clapton since his days with Cream.  I love all of his music so I was not worried about all those 1star reviews.  When you have a musical resume like Eric Clapton you can record old favorites for your satistaction  and the satisfaction of your die-hard fans!! Keep up the great work Eric I for one LOVED \\"Old Sock\\"
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Large buttons, easy input, perfect for all ages. My children use it to help with homework and the large display make it easier for my youngest one to use. It keeps track of the numbers you input just in case you lose your place while calculating.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I find the characters much more fascinating than the sex. I thought the sex scenes, although graphic, quite boring. I look forward to the next book to see why Christian is 50 shades of grey.
B002BBJ52U|4.0|All girls watch and learn.  If you think he's just not into you, he's probably not.<br />Great chick flick. 4 Stars!
0738711500|5.0|The cards are nice, colorful and durable. The book is written so it is easy to see how one card relates to the next and the next suit to the previous and so forth. The method the author uses really works. She has you write down what each card means and has you think how similar situations in your life might have reflected that card. Her methods really helped me remember a lot more of what I read. Good set to have, buy two, you will find out you will need a second set of cards.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|his is great I like this app it works wonderfully everyone should read this as a piece of literature. praise jebus w
