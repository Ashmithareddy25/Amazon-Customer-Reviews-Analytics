B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I don't care what anyone else says because I was so in love with this book & I wish I could give it all the stars in the sky!!! Gideon made me so happy & I fell in love with him 10 times over in EWY!!! Sylvia you are a phenomenal writer & I love this series so much(and don't want it to end) that even if you wrote 10 more books about it I would buy them all!!!! I can't wait for the rest!!!! And to all you haters out there nobody said you had to like it but that's no excuse to be mean!!! I'd love to see how you all would feel if you put your heart into writing a book and got slammed for it!!! Think about that!!!!
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|It's awesome best little game I've played for a while thought it would be boring at first but it's actually pretty good

B0000524E5|5.0|I have this movie on VHS and my VCR is broke and there is no place to repair it and no one buys them or sells them barely anymore so i bought the DVD
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|I'm not even going to complain about this series originally being a trilogy and is now being stretched to 5 books because if this book was good I wouldn't have minded a few more of Gideon and Eva. What's so disappointing is how this book totally has no story. As emotional as Reflected was, this totally left me bored and skipping through all the sex and nonsense and sometimes cheesy dialogues. It was so obvious ridiculous story lines are being conjured up to stretch it out to 5 books. There was no character development, no real progress in their relationship. This book is like Wednesday... It's the hump book everyone should suffer to get over to be able to get to the next one. And then you know how everyone hates Thursdays because it's so close to the weekend and yet it's not? That's how I think I'll feel about the 4th one! Please don't take long to get 4 and 5 out. We all just need to have this series end.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|I really like the world tour, I just wish that the Rome special character was a Roman soldier. But other than that, this game is great! It is definitely one of my favorite games for portable devices.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|It's a good game but could use some more options inside but it was free so I can't complain. I did like it though.
B008476HBM|5.0|Even though I knew the basic story of this book I'd never got around to reading it. I'm so glad I finally did, the writing and feeling conveyed by this book is wonderful and I'd thoroughly recommend to anyone!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think everybody should get this game. This a cool game. You could challenge your friends high score or even your own. This is a game for everybody. Trust me. You will thank me later.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this Bible app! It is easy to use and convenient to have on hand at any time!!! I love the &quot;verse of the day&quot; feature! My nine year old son looks forward to reading the verse of the day, which usually causes into read further! Praise God for a feature that encourages a child to read the Word!

B003X27L9U|2.0|Couldn't really get into this story, sorry. Found it very difficult to follow so gave up in the end, perhaps will try again at a later date.
B008476HBM|2.0|The plot line and underlying story were great, but the complicated verbosity of the author's language turned me off immediately. Dialogue was not often clearly attributed to a specific character and confused me sometimes. I made myself finish it just to say I did.
B00571F26Y|3.0|Much of the research cited implicates all carbs and grains, not only wheat. On pages 110-111 of the hardcover version, in the chapter on \\"Wheat and Insulin Resistance\\" after the heading \\"Deja Vu\\" :  \\"The concept that diabetes should be regarded as a disease of carbohydrate intolerance is beginning to gain ground in the medical community. Diabetes as a by-product of carbohydrate intolerance is actively being advocated by vocal physicians such as....\\" For me the \\"deja vu\\" is that I have seen this before in low-carb programs.<br />The next paragraph:  \\"Several studies conducted over the past decade have demonstrated that reduction in carbohydrates leads to weight loss and improved blood sugars in people with diabetes...\\" This is the same 'insulin as the culprit' cited in Taube's \\"Why We Get Fat\\" and by the \\"Protein Power\\" books by Eades as well.<br />On page 118 he uses a paleolithic high protein hunter gatherer study and citation, and this same work has been used by all low carb authors:  \\"Hunter gatherer diets of meats, vegetables, and fruits, along with relatively neutral nuts and roots, yield a net alkaline effect\\".<br />Combine this with chapter 13, \\"Goodbye Wheat:  Create a healthy, delicious wheat free life\\".  A synopsis:  Cut wheat, and all other carbs like Barley, etc. Eat eggs, meat, .....Basically, he is advocating low carb dieting.<br />Finally:  I have cut all carbs way down myself for 5 weeks now. Lost a big gut, feel great, have apparently resolved multiple health issues, never hungry. I still eat a little wheat(one bun instead of 3 with a burger) a little rice, and an occasional piece of chocolate. And I can say that I got very fat when I lived in Asia and ate too much rice, and almost never had bread or noodles or wheat. Everyone there said it was too much rice. When I cut the rice, I slimmed down, ASAP. And rice, just like wheat, has been shown in its own studies to create obesity and diabetes, as this Harvard study, cited in the March 2012 issue of Time Magazine, pointed out: \\"When it comes to your risk of diabetes, a new study by Harvard researchers suggests that eating less white rice could make a difference. Each additional daily serving of white rice, a staple of Asian diets, may increase the risk of Type 2 diabetes by 10%, according to the study, which analyzed the results of four previous studies involving 352,384 participants from four countries: China, Japan, U.S. and Australia. Those who ate the highest amounts of white rice had a 27% higher risk of diabetes than those who ate the least...\\" Again, the culprit is  any and all carbohydrates.<br />Same here in the USA; when I cut all carbs, I lose weight. I believe that this book is correct in that low carb dieting will work, but it needs to be low carb, not low wheat. If you substitute rice, for example, you will get or stay overweight. Try it and see.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I really enjoyed this next book in the Crossfire series.  I loved Gideon,Eva and Cary from the Bared and Reflected novels and to see them grow together and see what happens next was well worth the wait.  There are so many other books out there to read while waiting for the next books to come out; shame on the reviewers who posted nasty reviews when they haven't even read the book.  I can imagine that writing is not easy and is very time consuming.  I have read most of Sylvia's book and she is a first class writer and I treasure every second I spend reading her work. Entwined was a great read, and worth every penny I paid!  Patiently waiting for the next book...
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a fun game and people should get this game is for there kids and there God kids have fun with this game guys
B005G5PPGS|4.0|Liked the tempo and the insight into Billie Beane and Paul D.  The book was quick paced and the player descriptions and quirks fun to read
B007IXWL2C|3.0|I had to read the three just to see what the fuss was about and then said I would never spend the money to read Book Two but I did, to see what happened, and then on with Book Three.  There actually is a storyline which was in between the S and M parts. The author is a good writer I think, so not to take that away from her in that respect, but this stuff is just not my thing so, hard to comment on the racier stuff in the books.  The end of the trilogy just leaves you hanging and saying, &#34;What the heck?&#34;  If there is ever a Book Four, I would not read it.  I feel like I wasted the $30 but it was my own fault!  I had to know what happened, and then it left me hanging.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|I remember having one of the little small square copies of this book as a child and I would read it over and over again. So when I had to read this for class, I was excited!<br /><br />This is a classic story that takes the reader on quite a fun adventure. Dorothy and her crew really go through it while they are in Oz. Regardless of the films, which I've seen and were both good, I still enjoy the book.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|I think Nemo's reef is a great game in the way you can be creative and use your imagination, for how you see your world being.
B00BY9GQHM|5.0|I am so glad that I bought this game. It has everything a person could want in a mystery game. My son can't wait for me to finish so that he can play it. I love this game so much that I bought part 2. Good work!
B00CRQV1TY|5.0|I have long been a fan of John Fogerty.  Thanks to a few choice Credence songs being featured in the TV show Supernatural, my daughters have become fans.  This new album with new versions of a bunch of John's best songs performed with a really nice selection of other artists will surely attract a whole lot more fans.<br /><br />Like any great songs, all the songs in this collection have a timeless quality.  They could have all been written recently and for those that are hearing the music for the first time with this disc, it is new and fresh and charged with energy.  This should be a contender for best Rock Album of the Year.
193700788X|1.0|I'm sorry, but how can anyone give this book a 5 star review?  There were too many inconcistencies and the ending was just dumb.  Not to mention the overall message is that we should reject those different from ourselves and run from the hard work it takes to make a relationship work.  If Ms Harris had Sam in mind as Sookie's HEA she did a very poor job of setting it up.  I can seee where things may not have worked out with Sookie/Eric or Sookie/Bill, but seriously???  The way this book was written was rushed, full of continuity errors and gave me the feeling the author just pumped it out (or farmed it out to a ghost writer) because she had nothing left creatively to give us.  5 star reviews are reserved for a literary masterpiece, not this garbage.  Shame on her, her editor and the publisher for sending this to print.  Please be aware, those of you who read these reviews, that authors and publishers PAY PEOPLE to write glowing reviews.  If you notice, many of the 5 star reviews say the same thing and aren't specific to any plot points.  Phoney baloney.  This is a terrible book and a sad ending to a series that had so much potential.  If you must read it, borrow it from someone who has already bought it or better yet, go to the library....or watch for it in the clearance bin of your local bookstore.  I am sure you will see it there soon.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I must say I was skeptical that any one television show could be as good as everyone was saying but I was curious.  After the first episode I thought, 'Well, this is kind of interesting.  A historical drama that let's us in on the upper class and the servant class simultaneously.'  Then after the second episode I was keen to see the next and before I knew it I, too, was a Downton devotee.<br /><br />I've tried to analyze just why.  I believe it's the rich character development.  The acting, for the most part, is so good that you're drawn into the world of the characters.  Mary, for example, is a 20th Century Scarlett O'Hara who you despise one moment and cheer for the next.  Thomas is so downright disgusting that you wish you could reach into the screen and choke him.<br /><br />But it's the dry, British wit that makes the series.  The repartee between Carson and the Earl of Grantham or between the Countess and practically anyone else is understated hilarity.<br /><br />A special Emmy Award should go to Highclere Castle for best supporting actor as Downton Abbey.  The series would be only a shadow of itself were it not for this magnificent structure.<br /><br />It's odd, really.  Downton Abbey makes us yearn for a by-gone era to which we would never want to return.  Time for some inner-reflection on that.
0307476073|3.0|Well written, insightful in many ways and also dull, dull, dull in many places. Can't say I'd highly recommend it. For armchair travel novels I'd choose &#34;Miles from Nowhere&#34; and the &#34;Walk Across America&#34; series. Far more interesting!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This was probably on of the best plots to a book I can think of.<br />And I can t wait to read the next one<br /><br />-Taeo
B00136RXGY|5.0|I loved her since the Eurythmics days, I wish she toured more but if I were her I'd probably be tired of performing on tour, that has to get old.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|The Language of Flowers is so well written, I had a hard time putting it down. It's about the strengths and struggles of humankind
0452270073|5.0|The first in a trilogy about British soldiers in WW1, this book highlights a few officers, including known poet, Siegfried Sassoon , suffering from PTSD and residents at the Craiglockhart War Hospital, an institution where they're receiving treatment and rest. The main objective of the medical team, which includes Dr William Rivers, an anthropologist, is to try to treat them to the point where they are 'cured' and can be returned to front to help fight the war.<br /><br />It's an incredibly sensitive study of soldiers who have been in the midst of horrific conditions, seeing their friends cut down in front of them, having go crawl through dismembered bodies, one soldier even being hurled in the air after an explosion, only to land head first into the decomposing body of a German soldier, or forcing themselves out of the trenches, knowing they'll be walking into enemy fire.<br /><br />The relationship Rivers builds with some of the patients and his method of treatment highlights the fact that PTSD, not a term used or even understood back then, is not a form of weakness or madness and should not be stigmatized, as it was in those days, and still is to a certain extent today.<br /><br />The author puts a very human face to each of his characters, and raises the ethical and philosophical questions about war, making this not just historical fiction but also a very thought provoking read. The declaration by Sassoon is quoted in the beginning and is the foundation upon which the psychological and fatal effects of war may be argued.<br /><br />All in all, a thoroughly good read.
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|Great game I absolutely loved it. Helped me think and actually use my brain (hehe) yet still have fun at the same time. No glitches, worked properly, and helped me get rid of my boredom.
B004XZR63M|4.0|I found this book really inspiring, maybe it's not an investment's reference book, but it's really nice and push you to get out of your chair and start to make the money to work for you
B0041D843M|5.0|Before reading this book I was an avid meat eater who at best ridiculed vegetarianism. I thought what good is living if you can't eat meat and that PETA should stand for People Eating Tasty Animals. My family has a severe history of heart disease and by age 45 I had already lost my gall bladder to stones and my thyroid to cancer. I have also had numerous kidney stones. I have multiple friends who ate poor, animal based diets with few or no vegetables who developed cancer or multiple sclerosis or both in their 30s. All of this could have been avoided if we had been eating the proper diet. The authors of this book give overwhelmingly compelling evidence in support of adopting a plant based diet, and that is what I am doing now.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Great Historical Novel as most of Ken Follet's books. Loved to learn some history through a great novel which won't let you go until it's over
0425263924|5.0|I actually think this was my favorite in the series so far. Eva and Gideon both have some huge issues that can't possibly be wrapped up neatly in a trilogy. I'm enjoying really getting to know the characters rather than being rushed through their story.
159463176X|5.0|I absolutely lovedddd this book. It was just amazing. The way all the different characters' lives were portrayed and developed was just incredible. There were several characters and finding out how they were all connected was intriguing and exciting and i loved every second of it. This book took me on one of the most extensive emotional roller coasters of my life. I've read Hosseini's other novels, and this book definitely showed how much of a better writer he became. To be able to develop so many characters in one book and write in their point of views so magnificently takes great skill. I bow down to him and his amazing writing skills.<br /><br />This book not only tugged at my heart, but it pulled and pulled until my heart was torn into irreparable pieces. The end of the book was extremely sad, yet satisfying. It tied all the different stories together back at the heart of the story, between Abdullah and Pari. I find it an honor to have been able to read such an amazing book, and i hope no one passes up the opportunity to take themselves on this incredible journey.
B002SR2PKG|5.0|I just re-read this book because I am a new writer and it never hurts to see how a master develops characters you care about and plots that keep you reading to the last page. Has any adult writer ever given a better voice to children? I would be hard pressed to think anyone ever did it better than King.
B000SLP4SE|4.0|BEING RETIRED MILITARY I THOUGHT IT WAS VERY WELL DONE. DIFFERENT AGENCYS BARROW MILITARY PEOPLE ALL THE TIME. THATS IT!
B004478AS4|5.0|This book was awesome! It's amazing how Achebe set's up the story and gets you to feel the african side of colonization
B000O8OTNC|5.0|I have only had my Smiths sharpener and already love it. I have had experience with Smiths sharpeners, hones, and stones for decades and they hit a home run with this one. It will put a good edge on your knife very fast and easy and the foldout is great for keeping the serrated edges in top shape also. If you need a handle but high quality sharpener then this is the one for you.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|I love when a book grabs my interest in the first few pages.<br />I recommended this book to all my friends and they all agree that it is a page turner.<br />You can't help but fall in love with the characters.
B005QMOZOO|3.0|I am a big fan of PD James so was very excited to see how she handled a sequel to Pride & Prejudice. It was an enjoyable read, but as a murder mystery it is far removed from her usual books. Perhaps the simple story was more in keeping with the period of the setting and the writing style of the time.<br />I was a bit disappointed with Elizabeth in this sequel, her character played a very small role and seems to have lost all her spark.<br />I did enjoy the story, but I don't feel it is one of the authors better works.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Just finished reading it, and loved it!! I can't wait until the next book comes out.  I love series books and following the characters, I hope she just doesn't stop at 4.
B003QSLW0K|5.0|I LOVED Lilo & Stitch! It's a fun enjoyable but also tender (at times) movie! Lilo reminds me of my sister, who is actually 23..  I think that's maybe why I love it so much! I would highly recommend for everyone to give it a watch!
B0089LOG02|5.0|I recommend this book to everyone I know who enjoys a good story.<br />I did not know that an Orphan Train truely existed in the United States.<br />I feel in love with the orphans as children AND adults.
B009CPEOC4|5.0|I've liked Katy Perry for a while now (I say like because I didn't LOVE her...yet).  When I saw this on my suggested list of movies to watch, I thought, &#34;Well...why not.  It's not Justin Beiber...So I can live.&#34;<br /><br />I loved it.  It put a lot of that time frame into perspective for me watching Katy struggle with her relationship with her then-husband, the fans, her family, the difficulties and pressures she went through to get to where she is now.  I say I'm a fan now more than I liked her then because she seems far more real and human from seeing this movie.  She's human.  She's touchable.  And she's just as real as anyone else is.<br /><br />Fantastic with great music, cut scenes from her concerts (which I totally have to take my girls to), and behind-the-scene moments that really make you pay attention, this movie was filled with great moments, sad moments and was very well done.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I love the way it shows you the calculation you just did along with the result. As easy to use as an old fashioned calculator.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|It all started with the toys and my daughter (who was 2 at the time) doing learning apps on my kindle fire.<br />I love how it's low maintenance, and you don't have to get on everyday. It's simple to use. helps somewhat with &#34;computer coordination skills&#34; as well, not only has it been fun for her but it has helped with remembering (where her pets are), hand and eye coordination (playing ball with the pets), and also with facial recognition (what pets look like when another is looking for their friend to play with)<br />Now, she'll be 4 and this has also taught her extra responsibility on how to take care of her pets (online as well as her real life pets), I use this in sync with the &#34;Kids Place&#34; App,  so she isn't buying things and she absolutely loves it!<br /><br />I even catch myself (26yrs old) playing with the pets as well.
B00AGKH7K0|5.0|I was in the audience in 1964 when Eric Burdon, as lead singer for The Animals, performed live at the Paramount Theater in NYC. The Animals were the first original British invasion act I saw and they blew me away. Burdon sang House of the Rising Sun and Boom Boom and the other blues classics The Animals covered on their first LP. I can still see him up there, a little elf clappin' and shakin' on that big Paramount stage. What a voice!<br /><br />I followed The Animals and Eric as a solo act for a couple of decades, and then I fell back into listening mostly to jazz.<br /><br />This morning I heard Devil And Jesus on Facebook and it really rocked me! The man still has it! I hopped right over to Amazon and bought Til Your River Runs Dry (if you buy the CD, Amazon auto-rips the album to 256 kbps MP3s at no extra charge and stores them for you on Amazon Cloud, which is cool because you can hear the whole record immediately and download the MP3s while you wait for the CD to arrive.)<br /><br />The songs range from rock to blues and even a little New Orleans snuck in there on River Is Rising. Old guys like me will love it. Young folk may not get the hippie references, Bo Diddley tales, etc., but the overall performances are pure and beautiful. I have to wait for the CD to see who is actually playing behind Burdon, but I can tell you the guitar work is excellent!
B005K17RU0|4.0|Sometimes have to initiate a forced stop of the application to get the local Maps to reboot and come up real time. Other than that, it's an excellent app with pertinent weather info.
B004MC0FO8|5.0|I've only stumped it once.. with the &#34;on hold&#34; music playe by State Farm. It didn't recognize &#34;Just Like a Good Neighbor&#34;.
0783226845|5.0|I think this is one of Al Pacino's better movies, Chris O'Donnell was also excellent. This movie is a must have for your video library and the ending is one you can watch over again no problem.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|couldn't stop reading and I am not a sci-fi fan.<br /><br />Interesting premise, great characters and interplay, MORE about the silo's PLEAae
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I luv this game a lot! My family takes turns and try to get better scores. It's based on the hitting game temple run. Graphics are super cool. There's a little lag but after a while it goes away. The best part is it's FREE. So I would totally get this app :)
B00127RAJY|4.0|I would give this workout 5 stars, However you cant fast forward through jillians opening comments And go right to the workouts, which is annoying.  Otherwise this is extremely effective.  I double up on the workouts sometimes to get extra, But it is a killer!
B003XVYLDU|4.0|Vonnegut is content leading the reader through a twisting narrative rife with both blandness and sweet revelation. His novels are truly dark and light-hearted if there can be such a thing. Slaughterhouse five is an excellent example of why the art of literature can never die. Reading this is not simply an enjoyable pastime, it is a riveting experience in and of itself. Enjoy.
B00B5HQLMI|5.0|What I love about this movie is it is not perfect, he makes mistakes, he pays for his mistakes and there are times when he is down and out.  It makes the movie feel more realistic and less gimmicky. And speaking of gimmicks, all Q gave him in this movie was a pistol with palm grip security, period.  It is in the Daniel Craig era of more brutal and graphic violence but even that makes these seem more realistic.
B009NY43NY|3.0|True fan of the series, but I was neither a team Bill or team Eric fan to begin with (favored the weres).  That said, I just can't believe that she took all these characters that were so uninteresting and who I barely remember and created this convoluted plot in order to wrap things up.  Eric and Bill really got no closure, and I really can't understand how all of the sudden Sam fits into her life seeing as he was always like a brother figure.  But I guess the author is sooo over this series, and I don't blame her after 14+ books.  I just wish she put people in this final book that we actually care about.
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|this app is totally addictive.  it is simple enough to learn and complicated enough to require planning<br />and thought.  as thoroughly enjoyable game.
B0038GEUU4|5.0|One of their best! Absolutely LOVE MCR!! Includes bonus music videos. A definite MUST have for MCR fans every where.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I think that this app is really a very fun and enjoyable app to play and I spend lots of time doing so.
0316228532|1.0|I have to say this: I am a huge Harry Potter fan, & I fully realize that this book was supposed to be completely different. I have no issues with that. I'm a SAHM, educated & read a variety of fiction. I thought this was supposed to be a dark comedy, but there was no comedy. It was extremely dark, extremely foul, and if anyone really thinks that's real life, I sincerely pity them. There were a lot of characters, but they all were rotten & most boring, so the book dragged on like it'd never end. I don't know if JK Rowling felt she had to prove something (after HP???), or sadly, if this is who she really is, but I found the book deplorable and actually threw it away. It is not for kids, she wasn't joking about the adult theme. Sadly, I don't know or want to know any adults who would want to read it. I am so upset I read this; I really admired JKRowling, and now my view of her has been completely tainted. I regret reading this book.

B008OM0EDO|2.0|Super Silly because It has plot issues.  I just did not care for it at all. There were very few funny moments in this comedy in my opinion.
B00BJS7LHC|5.0|Incredible and exciting movie!!!! I truly enjoy watching Django. Quentin T did it again, Django is as intense as Pulp Fiction. You can't go wrong adding Django to your video collection.
B00AO2P3GA|4.0|A decent shooter for the kindle. Controls aren't too bad just a few quirks like where they put the grenade swipe you hit it accidentally a lot
B00AQF8CJ0|4.0|A great game to play on your free time. It is wonderful for a road trip, but could be fairly short. Over all it was fun!
B001K3EXTA|3.0|It helps one to understand  the selfishness of the rich. I would recommend others to view this movie since the new movie is out. I plan to see the new movie just to compare the different views.
B00C7KYXHW|5.0|A very intelligent show. Not for the squeamish. Great cinematography, great music, and great actors. What more do you want?
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|Loved the 3rd book in the series but It did nothing but leave me hanging. I cant wait until the next book comes out and maybe I can get some closure in my life :)
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|The best! Love 9 he is funny and has A heart! Watch this series! Great storylines and good acting ! A must !
B004MC8CA2|3.0|It like the helpfulnees of the app. It is quick resource that I have utilized time after time  for my bible studies. It is nice to have it handy rather than carrying a large book around.

B009G41CG2|5.0|This is a simple, match-two game. It's not difficult to learn and has enough variations to stay interesting. When I get bored with solitaire, mahjong is a perfect substitute.
B008JGSM6G|3.0|Some of the puzzles are easy and some require more thought. It is a way to keep the brain active and useful in your free time.

B0074D3CAQ|4.0|I enjoyed the personal aspect of this book.<br />Most interesting was all the people, places and things Harold encountered on his journey. Not to mention all hiding innermost thoughts.
B0044RUSZM|5.0|This laptop stand works great and keeps my computer from overheating. I rarely hear my fans turn on anymore. I also appreciate the design aesthetic. It's simple and clean.
B0098QBEXO|5.0|This film was wonderful. I think my only problem with this movie is the fact that you will miss some of the conversations because it is impossible to stop crying.

1780201079|5.0|It is a good edition with 4 nice books. It was published by Reader's Digest association, Inc in 2012. Also, it is in hardcover edition that protect the four books inside. At the last page  has some important references.

B007MB5OCE|5.0|The story was completely engaging and I didn't want to put the book down. It reminded me a little bit of a _Confederacy of Dunces_ and to some extent _The Selected Works of T.S. Spivet_ I bought a physical edition of the book as soon as I finished so I could easily share it with friends who don't have kindles and I have recommended it to more than one person.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|The acting is superb, great characters, mystery, history all wrapped into one neat package.  We are definitely addicted and are anxiously awaiting the next season.

B009NQKPUW|3.0|Well, the Alien series as a whole (no pun intended) has a few script flaws, but Prometheus tops them all. I have to say though, visually it is stunning and worth seeing if you don't have to pay for it.<br />Lets face it though, you get 2 hours tops to lay down a fantasy scenario that is suppose to be based in science and technology and the previous Aliens were able to achieve it much better than Prometheus.<br />I don't want to spoil it for you, but I will say this, if Scientists behaved the way these 'Scientists' behave I would question their credentials.<br />In addition to the visuals the acting was pretty good considering that some of the situations were a little too contrived and ridiculous for my tastes. I think that says a lot about an actors skills when they can pull you in no matter how stupid the dialogue or situation is.<br />I have the whole Alien series on Disc, but I will not be adding this one.
B005HSL626|5.0|It is pretty interesting. I enjoy a lot with my son trying to unlocked all Dojo's, The effects and visuals are really fantastics.
B008YKGQR4|4.0|Although the app offers &#34;Full Facebook&#34; as well as mobile options, the experience falls short of using a computer with a full-fledged browser. I use it for quick check-ins but it's not my favorite way to use Facebook. On the other hand, it works fine, gives me all of my content except links to Flash items - not their fault, the Kindle doesn't support Flash! But I do wish they'd upgrade their icon to an HD version that works on a large Kindle. A stupid, minor complaint but it sure is ugly.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Kept me coming back to read more. This was my first Nicholas Sparks book. I was worried it would have a sad ending like all the movies I've seen. Pleasantly surprised.
B0047Y0FGY|3.0|It's a fast read and at times funny, and other times she rambles.  Felt like she was talking among friends.

B0083Z614S|5.0|A delightful return to favorite classic read thirty years ago.  Enjoyed every word, conjuring up astonishing visuals of the dead garden coming back to life, and ultimately giving life.
B004RJMUJO|1.0|I really only bother with games for my 3+ hours of commuting per day.  So far I have been able to play this only once right after I installed it in range of an AP. Every other time I have played I am meet with a notice staying that I must have an Internet connection to pay,  followed by the app closing.  The most recent time this happened was just a few minutes ago with me sitting in the van on I-5 while listening to streaming audio over the Internet,  just after commenting on Facebook.  All the while there is an s a h session from my phone to my computer at home.<br /><br />1) requiring Internet is poor taste.<br />2) acting as if I don't have internet access when I do is a show super of a bug.<br /><br />I can't support these practices.  This app now.
B00499NHLC|5.0|It was really great! It kept my interest every minute.  I like that it wasn't predictable.  Dr. Watson was superb!
1616614609|5.0|I bought my first copy of Netrunner when it was first available in August.  Since then I've purchased every single expansion along with another copy of the core set in order to build more decks.  The game has a steep learning curve, but don't let that dissuade you.  The game mechanics are very solid and it's easy to play once you know the rules.<br /><br />The tension in the game comes almost exclusively from the player interaction and the fact that one side is completely unaware of what the other is playing.  This is an asymmetric game, which means that each side plays completely differently from another.  It's different from other card games where you may just use a different pool of cards for any side (ie Star Wars, Lord of the Rings CCG), but the way the game itself is played is completely different depending on which side of the table you sit on.<br /><br />Overall, this game is worth picking up for anybody who calls themselves a gamer.  Even with a single core set there are plenty of deck building options to keep you busy for months.
B0054W4JQK|5.0|A move away from my usual read.<br /><br />As I read the last page of this book I was secretly hoping there was another chapter.
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|Don't miss this book.  I thought I loved the Kite Runner, but this one is even better!  I could barely put it down.
B00AA0TZTW|2.0|If Jimi were alive today, he would have never released this record! more people cashing in on old tapes that were never meant to be released. I remember back in 1971, hearing about new Hendrix releases, and being told not to waste my money on them. I followed this advice until this year, when I saw this album and thought I'd give it a listen! Wow bad Idea! I would recommend buying just the three albums released when he was alive! poor sound quality, and a waste of time. sorry, just being honest.
B0047Y0FGY|4.0|I thought the book was entertaining but I really thought it would be funnier. I think she is one of the funniest people ever.
1575666286|3.0|It has a lot of healthy ideas, but it isn't practical for most people.<br />Health needs to be achievable.<br />I felt the book gave impractical advice.
B000XUBFE2|4.0|The only reason I don't give this book 5 stars is because it took me a little back and forth reading to make sure I knew what was going on in the first several chapters. After I caught on, the book was fabulous!
B005TBN3EU|5.0|I love this movie it is so realistic. The actors are very good very true tlife.  want to show this movie to al my friends.
B00BR0LQ5K|5.0|WOTE's new album REVO is awesome!  They have a great sound and I comend them on the use of so many different instruments.  If you get the chance you should see them in person, they really put on a entertaining show!
B008HK3XU4|5.0|i love my marware vibe case. i like the folding feature, i like that it keeps my kindle fire safe, and i love the color. it's exactly what i wanted. it won't allow you to charge while closed, which could be a drawback to some, but i just leave it open when i charge and that doesn't bother me. really nice sturdy case.
B004G5ZY7E|4.0|Once again, Jo Nesbo has created a page-turning thriller in The Snowman.  And, once again, his villian was  not apparent, at least to me, until the end, with several likely suspects discarded as the ending drew near.<br />I liked it!
B003V4AK8E|5.0|much much much much better !!! default ps3 controller hurt my hands during FPS games. I noticed i played better on xbox360, no cramping, able to aim down sights , no slipping L2/R2. I am so glad they copied the xbox 360 style with this controller. very good. i would recommend this to anybody that has LARGE HANDS. Just to give you an idea of my hand size:I am an automotive technician and a XL work glove is a snug fit on my hand, forcing me in some cases go go with a 2X. Night and day difference in terms of feel. I will try to do a follow up review to talk about battery life and other features. Love the light up buttons as well, nice touch.
B00BQ1D7X4|4.0|One mistake people do when reviewing records from their favorite bands that are more than 20 years old- they often try to compare new records to past zeniths. Every band has it's peaks, and for AIC- there peak was around the Dirt era. This is the 2nd without the late Layne Staley R.I.P. (3 full lengther without Mike Starr R.I.P who was fired in 93) Much like Black Gives Way To Blue- The Devil Put Dinosaurs here has a pretty layered sound to it. And for what it's worth- adds to the maturity of the band. And while there's no songs like \\"Godsmack\\" &/or \\"Junkhead\\" - there's still a sense of melancholy and gloom all over the place. What's strange are the catchier songs are my favorites on TDPDH... Maybe because the hook oriented songs are often the heavier tracks on the disc. The moods shift from one the album goes into track 4 \\"Voices\\"- a baritone acoustic guitar plays some pretty stripped chords over a heartfelt sung vocal and an overall feel of Jar Of Flies. But direction wise it feels closer to what's on Black Gives Way To Blue- which was sorta an amalgam of all the records in a sense. Most of the record feels mid tempo and slower brooding atmosphere-wise. The title track has probably one of the more interesting atmospheres - quiet and loud intermingle with trademark harmonized vocals by Cantrell/Duvall- who seems to have found a voice on here. Mostly vocals are often doubled by the two. Rarely is one dominating the lead vocal too much. \\"lab monkey\\" was a track that definetly grew on me.<br />It could be my favorite on here- there's a moment where the harmonized vocals remind me of \\"Sea of Sorrow\\". A few highlights on this disc: \\"Hollow\\", \\"Phamtom Limb\\", \\"Stone\\" & \\"Voices\\".  A couple of skippers on here- but most of this disc is pretty right on! Overall good production- not too much clipping like the previous album. A bit layered at times to the point where it becomes distracting- the highlighted tracks I mentioned have a nice thick guitar tone to them...Decent disc.
B008RJ6TTC|4.0|I have always loved  Columbo and could not pass up the chance to have the whole series.it is a great show with an unusual and memorable character.

B005NFWCSK|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. There are a few slow scenes but that worked well for me. Impressive CGI! Easy to download through TiVo.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This is a great game, but I feel that the order of 2500 gems for $99.99 is way overpriced, including some other in-game items.This game is one of the best games for horse lovers and animal fanatics.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love it so so much! Besides minecraft I love playing this game!I hope you all enjoy it to love ihascupquake
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|This is a great game for the whole family. All ages just love playing it. So hard to put down.
B00CO8D3G4|5.0|While large portion of James's new book is a collection of already posted articles on his blog, it is a succinct summary of his own original concepts, neatly organized in one place. James's blog makes me think and helps me come up with my own insights, which in turn boosts my confidence immensely. The least I could do to thank him is to buy and read the book.<br /><br />James has an unique background of making a name for himself in several different fields - web development, trading, financial journalism, angel investing, self-help author. You don't get to excel in so many different from each other professions without being a genius or having a system that could be replicated over and over again. You are not going to become the next James Altucher by reading this book, but you might become a better version of yourself and that's all that counts.
B00BESM14U|5.0|Most relevant coming of age story for current culture.  There's someone for everyone.  The movie doesn't convey the emotional elements of the book which are superior.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I needed a simple calculator app for my Kindle and downloaded this one. It works really well and is easy to use.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is the best game ever!!!! I always play it all the time. I am also a horse lover and this feels so real!!!!
B0070ZLZ1G|5.0|The most intelligent book I've read on the things we should teach our children to help them be successful -- in LIFE, not just in the classroom.  The book intelligently pulls together various disciplines (psychology, economics) & is an easy and compelling read, whether you're an academic or completely unfamiliar with the fields.  The conclusions explained in the book are backed up by empirical data.  Legislators and policy wonks should start with this book when they examine why standardized testing has failed to achieve the goals that the claimed that it would.
B008JFUTUY|5.0|This is a remarkable story. Rodriguez, a Bob Dylan alike, is amazing, also his songs. The movie changes any viewer's life.
B004EHZPEG|5.0|I was expecting to dive in to this book and get some quick tips on game design. The Karate Kid (ralph macchio edition) wanted to dive right in and learn karate and got frustrated with painting fences and such. This book takes its time and has you paint a few fences for a few chapters with some very general information on a lot of subjects (psychology, anthropology, etc) that set the tone and provide you with more lenses in which to view Game Design. This book is packed with an insane amount of ways to think about that game you always wanted to make, different approaches, different ideas. Take your time reading, absorb the information Sensei Schell has laid out, and you'll be crane kicking your way through game designs like a champ. *cue Joe Esposito - You're The Best Around*
B00CDSVZHY|4.0|..........was okay.  A little gory.  The ending was kind of goofy. I wouldn't watch it again, and I am glad I waited to watch it at home.
B00BQ1D7X4|5.0|This album is great!  Definitely worth the buy.  Was worried that it might not be as good as Black Gives Way to Blue, but it some how manages to top it.  Just good all around tunes on the Album.  My highlights so far are Hollow, Pretty Done and The Devil Put Dinosaurs Here.  Give it a listen.  You wont regret it.
B004UID2LC|1.0|When I downloaded this app, I expected it to download movies and videos that I wanted off of YouTube, but I was wrong.  It took about 2 or 3 minutes for a video to download, and whenever I go to the Personal Videos app on my Amazon Kindle Fire HD Tablet and tap the \\"details,\\" it shows that the video was downloaded on December 31st, 1969!  YouTube did not exist in 1969!<br /><br />This is the worst app to download YouTube from.  TubeMate is much better!
1401322786|4.0|Mitch did a good job with this story as he always does, I enjoy everything Mitch writes, good story teller.
B009AMAGQM|4.0|While the story relied on every tired cliche known to YA fantasy and there wasn't a plot twist in sight, I found myself enjoying this movie anyway thanks to the committed efforts of the cast. Jeremy Irons and Emma Thompson completely outclass the movie and do wonders with their roles. Emmy Rossum and Viola Davis are fantastic as always. And Alden Ehrenreich and Alice Englert overcome their thankless parts as doomed young lovers to shine as, wonder of wonders, three-dimensional characters. They were really great together. The cinematography was also lovely and made the most of the Spanish moss.
B005KJJ4F8|5.0|So, I just want to first say that Mrs. Marissa Meyer has major guts to write about a cyborg Cinderella! it isn't an easy thing to pull off because you have to get the idea right and come on, she is probably the first to do it!<br /><br />  Now, whether the idea flopped or not was something different. In this case, it didn't. I think it worked pretty well, for a strange combination. It was actually quite surprising because when I first read the back, I was like \\"interesting\\", but there was still a part of me that was going \\"are you sure you want to read this\\"? I've read books that sounded great, but when actually reading them, I wanted to bash my head into a wall. This was a MAJOR exception.<br /><br />  I found it made perfect sense and maybe I'm pushing it, but I thought it was better than Cinderella the original. In the original, Cinderella did EVERYTHING her step-mother asked and I found that to be really irritating. Meyer transformed the story and gave Cinder a backbone. I found it really awesome that it was so much like Cinderella, but yet so different!<br /><br />  Cinder also has good plot development. In the beginning, I find her too much like the submissive Cinderella, but throughout the novel, I watch Cinder grow as a character and even a person...er... cyborg. She is also one of the best YA characters in the sense that I didn't want to smash her face in at any point of the novel. I found her intelligent and kind of a role model :)<br /><br />  Wow... you know you're lame when your role model is a fictional character...<br /><br />  Another thing I actually like is the villain. Queen Levana (which I have come to realize, is the queen in Snow White), is actually a character I like. I find her interesting because she is portrayed as a villain, but there isn't much insight on her yet. Since it's a 4 part story, I expect there to be more in the future!<br /><br />  I think Levana is interesting because it is said that she killed her family members and that she's pure evil, but we don't know why. I just find the idea of a villain pure evil interesting. \\"Why is she this way? What does she want? Did she have a horrible past?\\" These are the kinds of Qs entering my mind.<br /><br />  Now, let's talk about something I don't like...<br /><br />  In terms of characters, since that's the focus right now, I didn't happen to like Kai.<br /><br />  He -if you haven't read the book- is the supposed \\"Prince Charming\\" of it. I found him to be way too immature to be a future ruler. I found his personality kind of cute, but he -in my opinion- isn't fit to be a ruler and I was constantly irritated by him and how he lets his emotions run his decisions. And then there's that moment [spoiler alert!!] where he tries to run away.<br /><br />Yes, kind of like this.<br /><br />  But, in all seriousness, it didn't add up to me. Maybe this is just my logical side coming out, but I found his actions to be far too naive and shallow to rule a country. Think of it as letting a teenage boy being a ruler, because that was basically what was going on!<br /><br />  But moving on to the actual writing itself, I just wanted to say that this novel didn't make me want to smash my head in... a wall... made out of bricks... while my enemies were laughing at me... yeah...<br /><br />  Okay then.<br /><br />  The writing flowed well in a sense that it drew attention in the moments where it should've been boring and added excitement to some of the minor details. I was hooked while reading and actually, I didn't want to put it down, nor go to bed. Of course, I had to because I would've fell asleep halfway through the night anyway.<br /><br />  The author also wrote in a way where I didn't question the character's actions. I found myself connecting with the characters, which -in YA fiction- doesn't happen a lot for me.<br /><br />  There was also a small part of me that believed that the world Mrs. Meyer created was legit. It was actually well structured and I feltlike I had enough background info on Luna and the Lunars. There was only one thing that bothered me, though...<br /><br />  New Beijing.<br /><br />  So, this book takes place in New Beijing. I am actually Chinese by birth. I also know a thing or two about Chinese culture. Since there was so many changes, I can honestly say that I think the only thing that made it Beijing was the name.<br /><br />  But the place was filled with people with the name Sunto, Kaito, Lihn, Peony, Pearl, Nguyen and Sacha to name. Chinese people don't have these names. Most people in China actually have western names, just like my Chinese name is my middle name (Xia Wen) while my first name is Western. I was a bit bothered by this because it was kind of the wrong info. It's also a major reflection on if the author did their research. I LOVE Marissa Meyer, but if she didn't do any research, it's kind of a deal breaker. Authors should never be lazy and not do research because it truly  reflects if they're writing about a topic they're unfamiliar with, but someone (like me for example) isn't.<br /><br />Another thing that I liked was just the idea of mixing Cinderella with Sci-Fi/Dystopian. If you look closely, you can see elements of Steampunk, Romance (duh), Fantasy (again, duh), and even some element of Werewolf!<br /><br />  The idea of all the different sub-genres working together (for lack of a better term) to create such an interesting novel, is truly amazing.like I had enough background info on Luna and the Lunars.

030789701X|5.0|Now I'll be honest. I've never purchased a guide before. I wasn't even planning on purchasing one for Skyrim until many hours in the game I find myself with dozens of miscellaneous quests that I don't even know where to begin in accomplishing them. Rather then constantly scour the internet I wanted something organized and reliable to help complete my side quests. That's when I stumbled upon this. I thought it might be overkill for what I needed, but I bought it anyway. With little expectations, I was COMPLETELY BLOWN AWAY with the amount of detail stuffed in this book. Can one even find all this useful? It's like someone translated all the programming code for Skyrim into English, added a bunch of pictures, put in a premium hardcover and called it a guide. I've read guides at Gamestop before.. None of them came even close to this amount detail. No this can't be a guide. This is something else. How Prima managed to put it together is beyond me... I could rant on but most of you are reading this for helpful information. So I will post the Table of Contents. Wait.. never-mind I just glanced at the TOC and it has hundreds of sections.. Too much to type. I will just give a summary.<br /><br />TRAINING pages 6-127 (covers races,skills,comabat,adventuring,crafting,hearthfire and more)<br />INVENTORY 131-156 (Covers all items, and their properties like weight and value)<br />BESTIARY 168-197 (Covers all living creatures)<br />QUESTS 198-580 (Covers ALL quests)<br />DAWNGAURD QUESTS 505-580 (DLC)<br />DRAGONBORN QUESTS 583-683 (DLC)<br />ATLAS 685-1066 (Discusses all places in Skyrim)<br />Appendices 1077-1100 (Bunch of cool stuff like Dragon language translations, skill books, unique weapons, ect.)<br /><br />All in all, excellent guide (if you can call it that).

B007J4T2G8|5.0|I have to say, I put off reading this book because I was worried about how bad the whole BDSM thing would be.  I decided to give it a try anyhow.  I was hooked from the first couple of pages.  I bought this as an audiobook and literally could not stop listening.  I love the banter between Ana and Christian including the e-mails, texting, etc.  This book was not what expected.  It was better than I expected.  Now, that I have finished this book, I have to get the next one.  Thanks.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|I have read and re read the trilogy numerous times and I really like the movie.  Of course it's impossible to cram every fact, every scene into the movie and keep it under 2 hours but they did a pretty good job of staying true to the story.  I have watched it many times now too and I never get sick of it.
B008YI9CWW|5.0|I bought this movie because blockbusters don't have them to rent. And just a bit ago, before it came back out into theaters, it was way way expensive to get; because nobody had them. Now one is making these movies anymore, so your only option is to buy it used on ebay and here. So seeing as I want my children to see these films I bought it.

B0089LOG02|5.0|I gave a rating of five stars because this book is brilliant.  The characters' stories are woven together in a spellbinding way and I found I couldn't put it down. The children who were orphaned, homeless and destitute were shipped off as virtual indentured servants. Some of it is truly heartbreaking, but there is redemption in the end.<br />The story came around in a circle and all seemed to come together in a meaningful way. Anyone who has suffered from a harsh childhood will feel a bond with these kids, and also glad that there were few who had a happy experience.<br />Excellent read.
B002K99P7S|5.0|Love the x-men films. Seeing as in the movies they have made wolverine a major badass this is one to own.
B00008QSA5|4.0|This album is a solid piece of eclectic blues put together by some lesser known names outside of the blues circle.  Bloomfield is one of the best at what he does and that is clearly indicated by the company he keeps; Muddy,Dylan and BB to name a few. The mans got soul and this album really displays the s*** out of it.  Season of the witch is a badass cover and the other tracks ooze that white boy blues. Great pickup for even the casual blues fan.

B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I love how Gideon and Eva became closer and more trusting and still there was doubt and mystery in their relationship.  Of course I can't wait to read book #4, But I think it is cruel and I think Entwined could have been longer... We waited forever for Entwined to come out.  And you are also paying top dollar for an ebook that should have been 500 pgs so it couldn't be dragged into two more books.<br /><br />With that said, I still loved the story and can't wait to see what happens with everyone.  We are left in a mystery again.  Megumi, Cary and Tatiana, Gideon's mom, Eva's mom, the Bracelet.....  Ugghhh.
B00CWVG1Z8|3.0|Powers are cool looking, but definitely not a guy movie. But great to watch with the girls. In all its and Okay movie
B000001E3V|5.0|Clapton and the Boys were ahead of their time with this one, in the sense that they were doing the up beat jam band thing 30 years before a band like Phish. They add funk, blues and an assortment of blended jams that just kick ass. Clapton must have laid off the junk before this show because the energy level is high through out and the lyrics are sang pretty clear. If your anybody who knows Clapton get this record because this him at his weirdest and best.

B00992CF6W|1.0|THIS APP SUCKS!!!!  I cannot express this enough. There are so many things more that you can do on the PC version. on this you cannot craft anything. there is so much less stuff to explore mostly because after so far the world just stops and there is a huge drop down the side. there are also no endermen or squids. no caves are included at all. there isn't any rain or snow. you can't cast water. there is no lava. when you try to kill an animal so you can eat food for health the animal dies but food hardly ever comes out. And if it does you can't craft a stove to cook it. there are so many other thing that I could point out are horrible in this app. its not worth $7.00. its not worth the name its given. DO NOT BUY THIS.

B008UCJ7KO|5.0|First and foremost, Sylvia Day has written another great read. I love reading her books.<br /><br />I know most of you are SO disappointed that there will be, at least, a book 4. OH NO... whoa is me! Another book to read to keep you entertained. GET OVER YOURSELF!!! You shouldn't rate a book based on the fact that the author decided to extend the trilogy into a series, that's not a review about the BOOK.<br /><br />Personally, I don't mind continuing to read about Gideon and Eva. It's a great love story, that I could not put down. It's full of passionate and steamy scenes! I love the twists and turns the book has taken.<br /><br />If it would have stayed the course and finished in 3 books it would have been way too much like 50 Shades of Grey.
B001AQT11M|5.0|awesome price to replace our movie. seller got it to me in no time at all and was just as they said which was great for me because the kids didnt miss it til I got it replaced
B001AOKA3W|4.0|It's a well made funky monster flick that's low on gore and high on action and incredible effects.<br /><br />I live in NYC and watching its decimation made me cringe more than any (tastefully handled) bloodshed.<br /><br />On a wide screen, the shaky-cam photography WILL get you a bit seasick, but it's a fun watch.<br /><br />There is, however, a major arc that had me screaming, &#34;then let him go, darn it! That's HIS thing, not YOURS!&#34;<br /><br />The ridiculous loyalty you'll understand I'm hinting at is almost more unfathomable than the monster itself.<br /><br />But a great popcorn and beer flick.

B00BVYNSLC|5.0|Great acting, suspenseful, many different characters played by Tatiana are all believable and well done..Looking forward to the next season..
B007HJ84ZK|1.0|I'm reading the first book and I'm about 200 pages in, so all of this plot is still very fresh in my mind for what I just saw on Episode 1. I don't understand why this show has such high reviews...perhaps the obscene amounts of gore and nudity? I only watched Episode 1 of Season 1 and that is all I will watch, for reasons I will make known below. Before that, I would like to state that this series may reflect the book, but it taints the reputation of the book and the reflection is not accurate in the least bit.<br /><br />Characters: First of all, the ages of all the children are older than in the books...which I'm assuming will make nudity of the girls...more acceptable to the audience??? Jon Snow is not at ALL what I pictured him to be...I mean it gives a physical description of him in the book...so there's no excuse for that. However, most other characters do look a lot like I would have imagined (esp. Arya and Ned), just not Jon.<br /><br />When the show began it completely butchered the scene of the Night Watch men who encountered the Others. The wildlings on the ground were not butchered and the man who deserted after the encounter only survived because he climbed up a tree. I know that seems like a small deviation, but for a series that claims to be so close to the book, the opening scene was screwed up. The execution of the deserter was handled well, but what about Bran's big question? Following the execution, the direwolves scene was mishandled as well. The actor playing Jon did not look as though he was caught off guard by finding the runt. Speaking of that, all of the plot was rushed much too much. The actors failed at capturing the nuances, pauses, and facial expressions that these characters make. I was frustrated throughout the whole episode because it seemed to rush to the nudity, which is FAR LESS IMPORTANT than, say, the scene where Ned and Robert were underground paying respects to the dead. That scene deserved more than it was given. They didn't bring Robert and Ned's relationship to life, instead they make Robert look like a man-whore and they made him look soft (as in fat is whole life). The king should be hardened, but with a softness that only Ned can bring out in him...Mark Addy is NOT Robert Baratheon. No, no, no. I'm so mad at myself for watching this because now all of the faces of the characters will be associated with the actors...Boo!<br /><br />The sex scene with the Imp and all of the whores was completely fabricated...I mean that was just completely unnecessary. So many people are stating that this series handles sex maturely, but it takes something sacred and makes it absolutely disgusting. The book did not handle sex this way at all! Also, Daenerys is supposed to be a 13 year old virgin and the show had the actress who played her take part in two obscenely long nude scenes. I'm sorry (not really), but that actress does not act very innocent or afraid and I don't think she can because she is too willing to pull her drawers down. The sex scene between her and Drogo was not handled well either because it made Drogo seem way more barbaric than he actually is in the book (according to that specific scene in the book). They didn't have time to throw in the fact that he tenderly asked her for permission? I mean, really? That scene in the book ended in mutual agreement...(well as much as possible considering the circumstances). Now, the sex scene of Cersai and her brother was pretty much dead on for the book...I will admit that much.<br /><br />Pros: The costumes, props, and scenery are somewhat nice. That's it. You can't build up a show on nice backdrops and cool clothing though.<br /><br />Overall impression:<br /><br />-The necessary scenes were rushed.<br />-Important details were completely neglected.<br />-Some characters are all wrong and the ages of the children are fudged.<br />-Sex has devolved into a barbaric act of overpowering women.<br />-Most of the nudity is unnecessary and is OVERWHELMINGLY uneven (all full-on naked women)<br />-Props and scenery are nice.<br />-Whorehouse scene completely fabricated.<br /><br />PLEASE READ THE BOOK. You'll understand why so many of the people who read the book are angry.<br /><br />Now I'm off to read the book some more, but I think I've made it quite obvious that this show has dragged down my overall \\"A Game of Thrones\\" experience. I don't even know if I'll finish it now, but I definitely won't be back to watch this ridiculous adaptation of it.<br /><br />Last words:<br />The actress playing Daenerys is so beyond wrong. I actually feel bad for the made-up character in the book!<br /><br />BLEH! >:(

1439153663|2.0|I do not understand all the good reviews this book received... I was totally unimpressed with it.  With all the catastrophes, it was melodrama on steroids.  Terrible, terrible things happen to every character (except Meg; sometimes immersion in botany pays off).  Lavinia transformed from a precocious child to a hapless twit who apparently felt herself unable to make any decisions in her adolescent or adult life; instead, there's a lot of sighing, wringing of hands, and drug addiction.  Her naivete' was ridiculously unbelievable-- she repeatedly remarks on how Jamie looks just like Campbell, but doesn't recognize Marshall as the father?  She medically helps treat Marshall's battered hand after his drunken binge in Williamsburg but doesn't realize he's assuredly violated/beaten/potentially killed someone?  She finds Belle's emancipation papers and then FORGETS ABOUT THEM?!  Oh, there's too many dippy moves she makes to list them all; as a reader, it was insulting to have the main heroine hide behind, \\"But if I had only known!\\" for hundreds of pages.  Ugh.  Most characters were cardboard cutouts; for example, the wise and faithful manservant/butler in Uncle Jacob, the sage matron in Mama Mae, the angelic but doomed child in Sally...  Actually, almost all of the characters are stereotypes.  The plot, too, is just silly.  Lavinia manages to seamlessly leave the kitchen house life for one of education and social propriety, marked only by homesickness??  Really??  What about her speech patterns after years of living with the slaves, or her ability to properly dress/do her hair, or any of the other hundreds of differences in the lives of the enslaved vs. their owners?!  As deranged as Marshall is, he comes from a wealthy, prominent family; yet somehow we are meant to believe that his aunt and uncle are thrilled that he's going to marry the orphaned indentured servant they have educated out of charity?!  And the evil Rankin... where/how was he lurking in the years that Willwas overseer, and how is he readily available to come back to Tall Oaks?  What town is he or the sheriff coming from, and why does that town have NO available friends/neighbors/etc for Miss Martha or Lavinia?!  So many other plot holes, but I have neither the time nor patience to list them all.  Even the prologue annoyed me.  We are told from the beginning that the hanged figure wears homemade shoes and a green head rag.  Pages later, we are introduced to Belle, wearing a green head rag.  Somehow, almost 20 years later, Belle is still wearing a green head rag (hmmm) BUT!  she puts it on Mama Mae's head at the last minute!  These 'switcheroos' are unworthy of a quality author, and I find them insulting.  This book may appeal to soap opera lovers, but as a historical fiction read?  Blech!!

B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I almost talked myself out of reading this because of all the bad reviews, but I'm so glad I caved and read it. I can see how it is a little disappointing when you were expecting it to be the end, but after reading it how can you not be excited to get more? I love all the characters and the intimate scenes are H.O.T. and totally worth reading. I had a smile on my face for hours after reading it. I can't wait for the next 2. I don't know what I'll do when they're really done. I don't think I could ever get tired if reading about Gideon and Eva. I say \\"crossfire\\" because it may be Eva's word to stop but for Gideon it means more.

1451695195|5.0|An authoritative, about impossible to refute, description of  an out-of-body experience. While the neurosurgeon who has this experience never mentions Jesus, as a Christian I found nothing to make me question my own beliefs and my own experience. Yes, I had an out of body experience, two in fact. As a CPA, Vietnam veteran, and all around &#34;question authority&#34; type, I had no use for God before my experience. My ride, however, was nowhere near as deep as Dr. Alexander's. this is about as good an explaination of the unexplainable that is possible.
B00CFA227C|3.0|I was hoping to catch this at Imax but was too late. The movie itself has many stunning visuals that I think would fare better on the big screen. Eleanor Tomlinson is absolutely beautiful, and if you like fairy tales then this is the movie for you. I never got bored watching it, and the flow is good. There's a couple scenes where the giants eat people and people die, however they do not get up and personal with it so from that perspective it's kid friendly. If I have one gripe on this movie it's not the movie itself but the script. The dialogue never really get's going between characters in this movie and I think that's what is stopping me from giving it the 4 stars that I wanted to. I think the directors \\"assume\\" you already know the story so you are kind of expected to fill in the gaps on your own. I would definitely watch this movie again. If you have an evening to kill with a date or kids and want to watch something this would be a good choice.

B00CXN2JNS|4.0|The 14th release by Megadeth is a fun record. Dave took the safe route and went mainstream rock in this outing, similar to what he did in Cryptic Writings and more so in the universally panned Risk.<br />The problem with a band like this, is the fact that no matter what they do their records are always compared to Countdown to Extinction, their most popular work.<br />If your a Megadeth fan, definitely worth the listen.
B00COGZ8FU|5.0|I have always been a Tom Cruise fan..I have seen all of work since &#34;Rainman.&#34;  This movie left me breathless. I loved his character and the way he chose to enter the movie during the right moment. His fight scenes were exceptional and the plot was just as entertaining. I do not want to give away too much but here it goes. He is Jack Reacher, an ex-military man who is a trained killer. A man who Jack knows got away with murder while he was in the military, is in a coma due to a serious beating while he was in police custody. This man is implicated in another murder and Jack comes to nail his ass to the wall. This is where the plot thickens. Rent it...You won't be sorry...

1442366621|4.0|The Fast Diet  by Michael Mosley and Mimi Spencer<br />I originally saw Mosley`s video on this type of diet, http://vimeo.com/54089463, and was intrigued enough to read this book.  Mosley is an MD and has spent most of his career as a science journalist and media expert. Spencer is a  journalist.<br /><br />Getting to an age where he is watching his health reports more carefully using his medical background, Mosley visits a number of top researchers and seeks a way of maximizing health without too much pain and inconvenience.  The result is a modified calorie restriction diet that he and his coauthor came up with.  One eats fairly normally for 5 days then restrict calories for 2 days ( 500 calories for women, 600 calories for men).  Both authors use this 5/2 diet and both lose weight with better lab results for the usual markers for good health- low sugar levels, cholesterol, blood pressure, etc.  They hope, but don't prove that the improved health indicated by these tests that will result in a longer, healthier life. It is worth noting that these good health levels are attained without the use of any medication. You use fasting to stress your body into a different body chemistry that is healthier, without making restrictive dieting a 24/7 marathon.<br /><br />The idea is that with the stress of fasting, your body will react in healthy ways to offset this stress (similar to Le Chateliers principle in Chemistry and Physics). Some think that the longer the fasting the bigger the effect. On his fasting days Mosely eats two meals totaling 600 calories, separated by about 12 hours. Spencer finds spreading her 500 calories over two meals and a few snacks more comfortable for her. Research is currently being done to test the various parameters to find what is most effective.  The idea is to help people improve their health profile for a longer healthier life, without requiring huge changes in life style that most will be unable to sustain.  The potential problem is that when you stress a body the exact results are unknown and this is where more research is needed, though starting gradually would probably provide a good measure of safety. They have a site to keep up with changes and PR- http://thefastdiet.co.uk.<br /><br />A number of researchers and their research are profiled showing good health results for various types of fasting in small trials. None are the gold standard of double blind research, and it is difficult to see how a randomized, double blind study could be done.  Given the apparent problem of increasing human obesity in the developed world and the concomitant very expensive, negative health effects, this could be a way of overcoming the problem without the complete lifestyle change needed for most diets.<br /><br />The authors discuss the parameters they think are important to maximize health benefits. They have a relaxed attitude where discomfort is minimized and an attitude that if it becomes uncomfortable- stop.  They suggest two days of fasting per week, with 500-600 calorie per day to lose weight. Once the desired weight loss is accomplished, one day a week is enough to maintain the health benefits.  They think it is a slight advantage to having the two fasting days next to each other and to maximize the amount of time between eating. Mosley wasn't comfortable with this and chose Monday and Thursday for fasting.  Spencer likes to snack between her fasting meals for a total of 500 calories.  The actual results with all the health benefits that are reported in the book are for these actual methods used, not the ideal.<br /><br />The main idea is to be comfortable enough to continue the fasting not to look for the absolute maximum efficiency.  It is well known that fasting puts stress on animals and humans, and this stress can cause important physiological changes. Fasting over time can cause substantial lowering of cholesterol, triglyceride, etc., levels, which is good. I've seen these levels almost cut in half byextended fasting, but these levels go back to normal when the fasting stops. Stress can cause harm especially if you have a health problem.  The advantage of this system is that you are encouraged to take it easy and to be comfortable so you can make it part of your lifestyle.  You may be able to apply just the amount of stress (fasting) to your body to keep your weight and health at an optimum, with minimum physiological and psychological problems.<br /><br />The book has a number of planned meals, with enticing color pictures and comments from people who have tried the diet (not very useful), and tables of calories for 100 grams of a very wide array of foods (very useful) are included.  In another area , of exercise, he similarly looks into using short duration intense exercise for improved health. It may be seen at The Truth About Exercise  http://fullepisode.info/horizon-season-50-episode-8-the-truth-about-exercise/

If the makers could really speed up the process of getting the update out I would appreciate it a lot. Overall this game is great and I would recommend it.
0307279189|5.0|It is an inspirational piece. It's is funny & keeps you wanting more. I couldn't put it down once I started reading. It really makes you feel like you are right there with these people. What a talent the author is. I will never tire reading this book for the rest of my life!

058201736X|4.0|It's a great book with an amazing report of Ann Frank's life. The book got delivered sooner than expected and came it inside a good package and safe. I just think that the book is simple and made with low quality paper, but that's fair for that price. I don't have any complain about it. I always wanted to read this famous book and I really suggest you to buy it. Im sure you'll be amused with this book.
1469220725|3.0|Reading the negative reviews about the stretching out of the Crossfire series, originally meant to be a triology, didn't bother me so much as the feeling that there was more filler in this book fro the previous 2. Gideon clearly has work to do but throwing in so many gratuitous sex scenes is making this couple become a bit boring in the face of added and, at the moment, unnecessary characters. Eva seems to be making some stupid decisions for the sake of future drama. Congratulations to the author for the success of this series. I'm hoping this isn't going to be strung out like she promised it wouldn't be. Having to wait so long for book 3 to have a somewhat repetitive cycle thrown at the audience make me think to not bother with book 4, specially if it takes an additional 6-9 months to publish.
B00BCK1A5G|5.0|I have read every book in this series, and enjoyed each one.<br />I have favourites and those less so.<br />And I have dreaded the approach of this book. The Ghost and hints of his story, and Kaleb with dark suggestions of his search, have been sprinkled through the novels leading to the final battle for Silence. I worried that what I wanted would not be what the author would write, and it would simply end up a rehash of a tired formula: Alpha vs weaker, but plucky woman, overwhelming mystical love bond, happy ever after.<br />But it didn't happen.<br />Don't get me wrong, the elements of the genre were there (I mean, there's a reason we read these books in the first place!) but they are not trite. The good guys win and the bad guys lose; light conquers dark. The characters are fresh and new - Kaleb is steeped in darkness but not evil; Sahara is broken but not weak. The fragments scattered in the other books have come together to form a whole, and one that works well.<br />This was an enjoyable read from an author who knows the story she wants to tell, and the characters she wants to create.<br />This was one book that was worth every cent.

B0085YOD1A|3.0|This is an okay app.  I got it as a free app of the day download.  It works, but it's very basic.  One feature that is nice is that you can see what percentage of time on your device has been used for what purpose/program.  However, I got \\"Battery Doctor\\" for free, and I like it better because it has a broader range of features, as well as very detailed and easy to understand screens that will tell you how to conserve your existing battery power. [[ASIN:B0097PW7H8 Battery Doctor]].<br /><br />Six one way, half a dozen the other...
B0050DIWFC|2.0|The book is well written interesting fast paced. I hated the ending. Everything is left hanging.  No certainty, no finality, no closure.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I LOVED this book and I loved that Gideon and Eva were happy in parts of this book (I wont say anymore I don't want to spoil the book.<br /><br />I love Sylvia's descriptions and the story. I wish there was a bit less of the recap stuff from the previous books, but that's my only complaint.<br /><br />I don't get all the complaints about the book leaving the opening for 2 more books, I'm happy to have 2 more books of Eva and Gideon. Don't rate this book based on being mad that a decision was made to extend the series, that's not a review about the actual book. I just hope they don't delay the next 2 books.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|This is a good book with a delightfully cute story! I enjoyed it and I'm sure you will all feel the same.
B005FLX2WC|5.0|A Beth Hart album with Joe doing backup and short solos - it doesn't get any better than that for blues lovers. Her voice and style are unbelievable! To think she was on death's door fairly recently and could have passed without a whisper, what a waste that would have been. She's more than back! You'll never be able to listen to Janis Joplin the same way again. And Joe, what can I say? Pure ear candy! Blues fan? Get it yesterday!
0307750922|4.0|I love the charactor, Jack Reacher.  He uses his instincts in trying to understand people he speaks to in the story.  Mr. Child seems to do a great deal of research, considering the details he describes in the story.  I was not disappointed in this novel.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I loved this book! I thought it was the best of the series. If you are a fan of the previous two books, then you will love this one. The characters open up more, and you get to see how awesome Gideon really is. I hope this is not the end of their story, there is so much I need closure on!

B00AALHW6Y|4.0|I like the music, but I am disappointed with the pre-order program. I needed to buy something else to get free shipping, so I figured that I would add on a CD. Unfortunately, as I waited for it to be delivered, I watched it fly of the shelf at the local Walmart for four days. Yes, amazon lowered the price due to it dropping since I ordered, but it ticked me off to wait. To add insult to injury, the autorip didn't show up until I had already ripped the CD myself. I learned a lesson.

B0057R5G6E|5.0|The T-Rex figurine is just awesome.  Well, if you haven't seen the movies yet, not sure what to tell you.  Visually impressive for their time... the first one is great!  The other two are amusing to say the least.  Overall though, quality set and picture, a must for any collector.  Picked this up on sale so got a great deal!
B00000JBFW|4.0|I think that this cd is the best Album of Deep Purple like Perfect Strangers!!!<br /><br />Yeas 80's is the best decade....
B00BEXB18M|4.0|After having listened to this cd a few times, I've come to the conclusion that this is actually quite a reasonably good Megadeth recording. There's plenty of good lead guitaring to be found, solid bass work, and I think Dave Mustaine's vocals have improved on what they were on Th1rt3en - possibly due to effects being added. Some weak points are; that the drumming appears to have lost a bit of the punch found on many of the earlier releases, the production could definitely be better, and the title track is rather straight forward and radio friendly for a Megadeth tune. Though in it's simplicity, the title track is quite catchy and grows on you after a few listens. There are times when the lyrics can be a bit mundane, or the vocals are a tad out of tune with the music, but the music itself is very much what you'd expect from Megadeth. There is the odd moment of experimentation, for example the banjo introduction and interludes found on 'The Blackest Crow' - which actually blends in quite well with this track. There is a quite good cover of Thin Lizzy's 'Cold Sweat' added as an album closer.<br /><br />If you're a fan of the first 4 releases only, this may not appeal to you, though there are moments here that remind me of those releases. Yes, the music is generally slower than what you'll find on earlier releases and slower than that on Endgame. However, this album appears to display a lot more creativity than 'Th1rt3en', The songs themselves are harder edged than many of those found on 'The World Needs a Hero' and 'Risk'. This album will appeal to fans of metal with a mixture of hard rock thrown in. Megadeth fans of recent years should also enjoy most of this album.<br /><br />Addendum (16 June 2013): My favourite track is Dance In The Rain. The last minute or so of this song changes course and ups the tempo - hearkens back to old school Megadeth. Lead guitar work does help to give many of the tracks a good metal edge. Most of these songs have stuck in my head after afew listens. It lacks the production quality and heaviness of Endgame, but these tracks seem more memorable to me.<br /><br />My last point worth mentioning, is that I regret not getting the version containing extra tracks. I've just heard the bonus track 'A House Divided' on-line and it's a great solid track. Begins with a trumpet intro and then builds up to some good speed metal. Dave's vocals appear to work quite well on this one. I can not understand why this did not make the cut on the standard realease. If you are keen on purchasing this album, it may be worth spending an extra penny or two on getting the version with extra tracks.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|I'll start off with the positives.  I actually liked how the relationship with Gideon and Eva progressed through this novel.  Their relationship makes the most sense in book out of all three (I'm sorry, I'm just not on board this new trend of a woman falling in love within three days to someone who treats you like crap).  They seemed to deal with more real relationship issues this time and handled them like I think many couples would. Also, this is a fun, quick read.  I read it straight through in about 24 hours (and I worked an 8 hour day).<br /><br />Now the bad.  Ms. Day must believe that the End Times are near because she literally wrote every single solitary story line into this novel that she possibly could.  It's like she doesn't believe she'll ever have the opportunity to touch a keyboard again!  I'm a fast reader so I won't spoil the plot for the rest of you but good grief!  Every character gets a new subplot in this book and (unbelievably) new characters are added.  What the???  On top of all that, the parts of the story that were already established became predictable and a bit boring.  And it really pains me to write this but... I get it, ok.  They have great sex.  Even Christian and Ana had more going on than that by the third novel.<br /><br />All in all, I feel a bit hoodwinked by Ms. Day and Penguin Publishing.  First you jerked me around with the release date.  I got over that, I'm sure whatever caused that suck on the business end as well as the reader's.  But then you lied to me.  STRAIGHT UP LIED by leading me to believe this was the final novel.  To be honest, if I'd had any idea at all that this was not the end of the series, I would have waited and bought them all at one time.  I was sold snake oil in pretty green packaging- it's not even a complete novel.  I understand the new trend of stringing out series until the reader just can't take anymore however the writer must have a beginning, middle, and end to EACH book.  We all learned that in elementary school English.  Authors like JR Ward, Marie Force, Nicky Charles, CC MacKenzie, Jill Shalvis, and S.C. Stephens have got this formula down.  Ms. Day should take notes from them and Penguin should be ashamed of blatantly milking their customers for every cent they can.  That's just mean.<br /><br />SUMMARY:  There was 1) too much of a delay in releasing this book; 2) too many subplots; 3) too much pointless sex (I have NEVER thought that about any book, ever); 4) too repetitive (she hot, he's hotter, he's rich, she's jealous... WE GET  IT); and, most importantly, 6) unfinished.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|I'm so dissapointed by this book. Ms Day, although I love reading how magnetic Eva and Gideon are with one another, it seemed as if the sex scenes were too many and too much!! Meaning, that was basically the story!! So many pages wasted on it! You lost light of what the book was about pretty quickly and just threw in random things. Plus, it's getting to be too \\"Fifty Shades\\"ish.  Too similar of story line! Plus, it's listed as the \\"crossfire TRILOGY\\" now your dragging it out!? Lost interest.... On to another series that doesn't strongly resemble \\"fifty\\" and that isn't ADD with the story line!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I LOVED IT!!!  I don't know what all you babies are complaining about?  This book is SMOKING HOT!<br /><br />I think you are mad just because it didn't end here.  When 50 Shades ended, we were, and still are screaming for more of that story.  So now we are getting more of this story.<br /><br />Suck it up buttercups!  BUT PLEASE, MS. DAY DO NOT MAKE US WAIT VERY LONG!!!!  We want more but need closure on this story, soon!
B00005MP58|5.0|I've always loved Jane Austen's &#34;Pride & Prejudice&#34; and when the first came out on A&E I was enthralled. It's long but it's so easy to get lost in the story; the characters are portrayed extremely well and Ms.Austen's most beloved tale has been brought to vivid life. Fantastic!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|This book was so good. I couldn't put it down. Can't wait for book 4! I wish it were out now!
0446572985|5.0|My husband is not a reader... but has not been able to put this book down since I gave it to him.  I recommend it to any man who enjoys military reads.
B0085YOD1A|3.0|Nice app but nonthing special. Can be usefull but dont have any specials feature. Just simple battery meter. I thought that there will be more.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|For me a book can be good if it has a great story to tell, even if the writer isn't a master wordsmith. But when the author can weave words like the threads of a tapestry...and tell a good story...and provide the reader with characters they can love...it's magical. Hugh Howey can turn words into music! I was hooked after reading the short story that started it all, and was so happy that I didn't have to wait to read the other installments.  Definitely on my short list of all-time favorite books!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|So far this has been very entertaining. It challenges your thinking&amp; problem solving process. If you like puzzles this is great
0802473156|5.0|This book is incredible. It really allows the reader/couple to tune into each other and find each other's love language.  A really powerful tool in marriage. I high recommend it!
B0082F0F8C|4.0|I really enjoyed reading this in October.  I loved the mood of the book (dark).  Loved the dark atmosphere (rainy and foggy).  I probably would have given it 5 stars but I knew that Jekyll was Hyde and vice versa.  It was also a lot shorter than I realized but overall enjoyed reading this classic tale.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|I loved the movie and the musical.  I am still reading the book.  It was free.  Thank you for that!
B0057R5G6E|5.0|So far no problems have surfaced with the discs and the statue arrived in perfect condition.  It's a great series of movies with just all around perfect performances and great CGI of classic Dinosaurs in the wrong place at the wrong time.  Everything that can go wrong, does.
0765325950|3.0|If you love robert jordans wheel of time like i did then prepare to be dissapointed by the ending. I suppose its not his fault but i waited ten years for this book and it just seemed anti-climactic in the end.

B000XUBFE2|5.0|I couldn't put this book down.  It is a realistic story in the Hitler era of Germany.  When I start to describe the story, it sounds depressing but it is not.  The author draws you into the life of a young girl and her love of books.  I felt like I was actually living in Germany in the 40s.
B009YN2M7S|5.0|This book by far was the best. I enjoyed it better than any of Nicholas Sparks other books. I also Liked it better than the Movie. ( of Course)
B0069JBKHI|4.0|I'm only on day 3 of this monitor, but it's working so already it's better than the other ones I've tried.<br /><br />There's about a 2-second delay. (Just like similar monitors.)<br /><br />This was the first monitor we looked into, but it had a $13 price tag on the app (that we'd both need) so I refused to buy it on principle. Now the app is free.<br /><br />We bought the Baby Ping (which we couldn't get to connect to our internet) and the Phillips (which we hooked up, but once we moved it, couldn't get it to re-find the crib).<br /><br />I'm sure this monitor will have some negatives as I use it more, but it was easy to install, so far has been reliable, is easily relocated (I like to monitor the dogs when we're out), can go wireless, clips to crib without having to be screwed into the wall (ping) or propped on something (phillips).<br /><br />Bottom line is I think this is a 3-star product, but gets 4 based on it's place in the current market of this type. I'd think that someone would have come up with a better one already, but when I watch the news, there is a delay so I guess I can't expect much more.<br /><br />BTW I saw one review complaining that you shouldn't have to have an iPhone to use this monitor. I'm not sure why you would buy this if you don't have an iPhone, but I'm only comparing it to monitors that are for iPhone use and are viewable from anywhere. I'm not interested in just seeing the baby when I'm home, I want it for pet monitoring when I'm out.

B00CXN2JNS|5.0|I was very surprised with the release of Super Collider. Straight off- I think it is fantastic and I enjoyed the hell out of it. It has moments of so many Megadeth albums from the thrashy and speed oriented to 'risk' taking musical passages. I was excited for nearly each song with some standing out more than others. Dancing in the rain and Kingmaker were 2 standout tracks, with The Blackest Crow being the most eclectic track.  I had read so many negative views of this album before it was even released that I was on the fence about purchasing it, however I took a chance and I am glad that I did. It really depends on what you are looking for when it comes to music and this album in particular. I had no misconceptions that I would hear a man in his 50's trying to sound and act like a kid in his 20's, I wanted to hear where he was now in his life and his expression through the music he helped to invent. He does sound older and worn, but to me it also sounds genuine. I liked that aspect. The music is heavy with a variety of tempos and styles but it is through the lense and scope of Megadeth in a very real and gritty sense. I believe that all comments are valued, even the negative views however after listening to Super Collider I was grinning ear to ear knowing that I have this to add to my collection. Listen to the songs, let them sit with you for a while and the hooks will be in you. This one may just 'Rattle your goddamn head' as the man once said. thanks for reading this and enjoy!

B0086449YA|5.0|Once again he brings rich lyrics of life and love with melodies to support the passions of his stories. He is truly a wonderful bard!
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|Ok I can see why everyone is upset, I would be lieing if I say I too hadn't been a little \\"What the ----\\"! But it was a good read! Ms. Day did not disapoint in the quality of her writing, yes we didn't really learn to much more in regards to the big picture but maybe that was her point, to get to know new characters for the big twist and turns she has in store for her readers.<br /><br />Can you really blame her for wanting to continue this story, the love affair that her readers have with this couple is unbelievable! Instead of being angry be happy that more of this loving couple will come our way. It's nice to see for once a couple try so hard to keep a relationship going instead of it being so disposable!<br /><br />It would be delightful if the readers did not have to wait another 6 months, but maybe she has another surprise for us, we can only hope. Don't give up so fast on Ms. Day, Gideon & Eva haven't!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Wonderfully told story of aristocrats and their staff;  love of family and fortunes lost and found,  humbling and heartwarming. Well worth watching.

B008MG1E4A|5.0|Very good.  My oldest son was in the Navy but he could not ever do this.  I never asked what he did besides flying helicopters.  I do not feel like any top secrets were exposed in this book.  This book made me more appreciative of all our service men.  The training they go thru and all they do for us.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|I love free stuff, and this is a really good app for free. The only reason I wouldn't give it 5 stars is because the boards are large, so to fit it all on the screen, they make the tiles smaller. I play on the Kindle, and I have to zoom in sometimes. Pretty good otherwise!
B008IJT0CE|5.0|Great to listen to when taking a nap or reading a book. I would love to have this on my computer so I could listen to end longer.

B008UCJ7KO|1.0|I though this was supposed to be a trilogy. After spending $10...I am SO disappointed that nothing of consequence really happened. The things of consequence that DID happen were so anti-climatic I almost didn't care when they happened. I want my money back... and I've loved Eva and Gideon's story so far. But I'm kind of over it. Unless the future books (I make that plural because who knows) are free or something I won't be reading anymore. I'm sorry Ms. Day... I'm just very disappointed.
B00B2QG3K2|4.0|I have all of their previous albums. But when I listened to this one, I was torn. It sounds like a great album. Great mix of songs, nice flow throughout. But it just didn't sound like a Paramore album. Whether this had to do with the loss of the Farro brothers, or another outside force. But it just didn't have the same power to it.
0812993845|3.0|This book was incredibly fun to read.  I was engaged in the character's lives and their adventures.  I was disappointed, however, in the ending of the book.  I felt that Kinsella brought up some very involved plot points (Fliss' son's stories?  The relationship between Fliss and Lorcan?) that she did not fully explain or resolve by the end of the book.  I was left wanting more explanation about these issues.  Overall though, this was a fun read and I continue to love Sophie Kinsella as a writer.
1451695195|5.0|The book is very well written and was a terrific read.  The author was not a believer but describes what happened and is very persuasive about it being real.  It was well worth the read
B001PJRAUS|5.0|the movie was fun comical romantic and entertaining. If you like jane austens movies you will surely love this comical adaptation
B000Q6GUT8|4.0|Fun movie. Well written and well paced. Plenty of action. Mostly, I liked the political undercurrents which assert, truly,that moneyed interests control our government. The film doesn't suggest that one skillful, well armed man can change the sad truth of economic injustice. But it does in my opinion inspire us to use the collective power of democracy to fight against economic tyranny.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|The Wool series is truly the kind of book you can't put down.  All of the characters are interesting and fully developed.  The premise is fascinating and the unfolding plot incredible.  I know technically this is science fiction but it reads more like a murder mystery.
B0089LOKHG|3.0|it's been a while since I'd read pandemonium and i kinda forgot what happened so I was relieved to discover that it starts right where it left off.<br /><br />first I would like to awknowledge the adition of Hanna's point of view. overall I liked it but soometimes (with Lena's POV being so intence and interesting) Hanna's POV got a little boring and sometims a little pointless . I didn't really care to hear about her wedding plans or dress fittings. i would much rather have seen her transformation into the person she became in the end more in depth. but i do have to say that in the end i was greatful to be hearing things from Hanna.<br /><br />next i want to talk about Alex. beware to the gjrls who fell in love with him because there is next to no Alex in this book . like none. this made it a little harder to get through because i love Alex and i love hearing about him. but not only is Alex slightly nonexistent but the times he is he's tottaly hating on Lena WHICH i can understand but still! and then he just left a vague note and left.<br /><br />Now that we're on the topic of character issues lets discuss Julian and Raven and Coral. i liked Julian in pandemonium. i really did and i was excited to hear more from him in book #3. sadly yes julian is with Lena and the group but he might as well not be. there was no charcter development no changes in him and no point in him being there! he was just there to be there for Lena when Alex wasn't and to put some dialogue in a few chapters. same with raven. same. FREAKING. thing. and coral was just annoying. they should've just sent her on her way after she got better.<br /><br />nevertheless i liked hearing from Lena. the transformation from delirium lena to requiem (did i spell that right?) lena is amazing. she really was the difference between this being a 1 star book and a 3 star book.<br /><br />new characters were added (ugg coral) and otheres just got better (Lena!) and worse (Julian). i really liked most of this book. which leads me to why i have deducted TWO WHOLE STARS. the ending. i have never in all my life had an ending as awful as this one. nothing was resolved! it's like ms. oliver has taken the last few chapters from us. what happens to Lena ? what does Hanna do? does Fred die? who wins the god dang war?! this is just the beginning of questions thay will forever not be answered. so dissapointing. there was no feeling of closure no ENDING! Not even an epilogue. it would be like cutting mocking jay off when the bombs went off at the hospital. it does not fly with me and unless lauren makes a book 4 i will never be satisfied.<br /><br />so here we are at the end of my review. despite its falling points i am glad i read this. so long my friends :)<br /><br />did i like this book? so so<br />would i recommend it? yes<br />will i read it again? nowhich leads me to why i have deducted TWO WHOLE STARS. the ending. i have never in all my life had an ending as awful as this one. nothing was resolved! it's like ms. oliver has taken the last few chapters from us. what happens to Lena ? what does Hanna do? does Fred die? who wins the god dang war?! this is just the beginning of questions thay will forever not be answered. so dissapointing. there was no feeling of closure no ENDING!

B000FC0OOU|2.0|The narrative is rather dry and dull. There have been some interesting parts in the story, where emotions and relations have been well played with. Would have been better had it not been 490 pages.
B005IQZB14|5.0|So well written, so raw, so insightful. And, in the smoothest turn-by-story-turn, so tenderhearted, gritty, and steel-willed.  What a tremendously talented and gifted storyteller and writer!!  I hardly felt at all that I was reading.  Rather, that I was tucked in her pack, on the journeys with her.  Of all the many things I loved about this book was that Cheryl Strayed STAYED with the story writing right up to its very last word. With most books I read, and even some/most of my favorites, I could go to the exact page where the story  transitions to its ending, too often accompanied by a jarring, almost palpable energy shift in the author's writing that all but says they want to be done but just haven't finished writing yet.  Not so with this book; she took such great care to leave the reader in a place that was internally consistent with the spirit of the journeys she took and described so beautifully in this book. I am definitely a new fan of Ms. Strayed's.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|Having read both the author's previous novels, I prepared myself for another heart wrenching rollercoaster and I got what I expected. Being a father of a little pair of siblings, the painfulness of the stories of Pari and Abdullah were magnified. As beautiful as this story is I can't help but rank it below the previous two offerings, but since the other two were perfect \\"5 stars\\" in my book, that's not necessarily a bad rating.<br /><br />What I disliked about this novel was too much of it resonated with the previous two works and many of the same themes come up i.e. guilt, American Afghans going back to the homeland, history lesson on Afghanistan's past dealings with Russia, the US, and the Taliban, etc. but what I least liked was the constant switching between characters and storylines and the leaps forward in time. Very disjointed at times and takes away from character development and consequently the story isn't as well told the previous two books.
B002HFP0R4|5.0|Great cd, was put together well. I like the idea of the 4 disc one for each brother concept. Lots of pictures and liner notes. I like that you have most all their hits and some rare songs as well.
B000FBJHZS|5.0|Dan Brown really created a different type of storyline here. I was mesmerized and couldn't put down this book. It was a great thriller.
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|I think this game is good for people who like puzzles. It is creative and interesting and really helps you think.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Some puzzles are challenging. Some are not. It's a game I can play and share with my son and neither of us get bored.
B00AAX68HG|5.0|Challenging and fun. Pay the dollar to have the annoying ads removed otherwise be very patient.  Don't buy the clues though...just go to youtube for the answers if you get stuck
B0089LOG02|5.0|Orphan Train: The Novel is now on my list of &#34;Favorites&#34; and I highly recommend it. I couldn't put it down.
B0042X9L6A|4.0|I purchased this to go along with another SB-700 and an SB-910 to have three off camera flashes in a compact Nikon CLS setup. The flash has been great and I've had no issues. There's not much I can add that the other reviewers haven't said. My only real hangup with this unit is the price and it's well known that you can put together setups using radio for far less than what Nikon CLS costs. Personally I just didn't want to deal with the extra hassle of transmitters and receivers, but whatever.
B0085YOD1A|3.0|This app gets the job done and does not have any ads.  The list of features just does not compare to Battery HD Pro, however.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I found Downton Abbey later, mainly because of everyone else talking about it.  I rented season 1 and 2 at the video store and then found I could stream season 3 via amazon.  I did have to pay for it as it wasn't a free streaming yet.  It didn't disappoint!  Another great season, it's just sad that I read we have to wait until January 2014 for the next season!
B00CEIGYAG|5.0|i totally love the 70's feel of this song. Its a great dance track for sure. Not sure about rest of album. Havent heard it yet.
B00000K3D4|5.0|Even my girlfriend, who seems to hate every movie I like, really enjoyed this movie. It's been a favorite of mine since I was a kid (except for those things that swap heads, I can't stand those things). Anyway, I bought it because it's been years since I've seen it and I can't recommend it highly enough.
0802473156|5.0|This book is very good. It should be required reading before you can get a Marriage License. And should be read every year on your anniversary.
B004W1GCNC|4.0|I decided to watch this since I enjoyed Downton Abbey so much.  I wasn't disappointed.  As with most shows, it takes a little bit to really get into the show as they're developing characters and the cast.  By the end of the third episode (which is the end of season 1) I was hooked!
B00CRQV1TY|5.0|Awesome pairings on the classics, Mystic Highway is classic Fogerty at its best. I have recommended this album to several people
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|This unit has so many five star reviews for a very good reason: it's fantastic. I can find nothing to complain about. It has served me well for the time that I've had it and I foresee it serving me well for quite a long time to come.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|I loved the first two books. Unfortunately, this one didn't do it for me.  It felt like nothing REALLY happened in this book.  There were some good parts, but the book felt like filler for the most part.  After a point, I skimmed over the sex scenes and the parts involving her co-workers.  With that being said, I do still love Gideon.<br /><br />My three star review is on the book alone.  If I were to review how Penguin handled the release of this book - it would be a one star.  After the release had been pushed back so far, I was super irritated when they decided to release \\"snapshots\\" every week.  You would think the book would be a lot better than it is with all the buzz they tried to create. Another thing that irks me is the price of the Kindle version.  Making the e-book version more expensive than the paperback?  Ridiculous.  If I read the next two, they will be from the library.
B007R21JJK|5.0|My first unlocked processor and had to find a well reviewed board for it. Love the 3570k, and love this UD3H board. I don't know why everyone wouldn't OC their processor when it's this easy. Will build another rig with this for my younger son.
B00A3NQNUU|1.0|It's a really awesome game and its cool how they thought of the dragons like double rainbow and metal it's really good PLAY IT
B0085YOD1A|5.0|Great for knowing battery level at a glance.  Easy to use and helpful in a five kindle household.  Works well and easy for the kids to use as well.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Lee Child continues to add to the Jack Reacher Mystique with this tale that starts off with Reacher being picked up as a hitchhiker, and unbeknownst to him, a hostage is in the car.  He figures it out in his own indomitable way, and look out bad guys, Reacher is after you!  You're hooked after the first page and I couldn't put this down until I finished it. Another Reacher classic by the master, Lee Child.
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|Unless they are the same price, go for the IB 3570K processor. Awesome performance, OC'd to 4.5 @ 55C. Ridiculous.
076421120X|5.0|I'm not sure why half the reviews on this page are for a CD/DVD when it clearly says Hardcover Book at the top of the page. But I wanted to make it clear that this review is for the book. That said...on to the review:<br /><br />Revealing Jesus by renowned worship leader Darlene Zschech, (writer of Shout to the Lord, a song that has been song in churches all over the world), is a 365 page devotional that compells you to think about and evaluate your relationship with God.<br /><br />Beautifully bound and laid out, this book is a wonderful addition to your morning devotionals. It is about the size of a bible too! Included in each thought for the day is a scripture to ponder on and a prayer to reinforce what you have learned.<br /><br />Born out of her own yearnings that she poured onto the pages of journals, these meditations and Scriptures show how much Jesus cares for us and wants to know us.<br /><br />Grab a coffee, your bible and Revealing Jesus. You'll be glad you did!
1594204217|5.0|Michael Pollan obviously had fun writing this book. He takes us through his hilarious travels to discover the essence of how the use of fire, water, air and the earth rendered humans a dominant species. He's concerned about our growing distance from direct, physical engagement in transforming raw stuff into cooked food and the nourishment such food provides as opposed to opening a package that has been processed elsewhere. A great read!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Alright, I'm on board with the majority of fans of the Crossfire series... yes seriously disappointed the Entwined with did not end the series.  I was looking forward to having closure on Eve 's and Hudson's love story.  After thinking about a possibility of one or two more stories in the Crossfire series I'm kind of glad there will be more.<br /><br />There was too much information to fit into the third book. I would rather wait for the next releases instead having the story rushed and feeling left unsatisfied that Ava and Gideon's story was forced.<br /><br />I love how Sylvia Day gives you more to think about than just a hot and steamy sex scene. I found myself become emotionally involved with each character. I don't think Sylvia Day will disappoint with how Eva and Gideon will end up when the story does conclude.<br /><br />It was irritating to find out that this was not a trilogy, as I thought it would be since the beginning, but I'm excited to see how this series does come to end.
B002G1YPH0|5.0|Don't know if it is the cooler, or the great design of the 3570K processor, or a little of both,  but quiet, cool, and 4.7ghz makes for a killer rig.
0425263924|2.0|Like many readers of the Crossfire &#34;trilogy&#34;, I waited many months and sat patiently through rolling delays. I am very sad to say that this book is clearly a ploy to milk readers for their money. There is no elevation to the storyline, and events aren't so eventful. The more I read, the more predictable the story became. I felt like I was only continuing to read because SOMETHING had to happen that would make the storyline more meaningful. After all this time, this book has left a bad taste in my mouth. What's the point in reading the rest? Read fifty shades again, they seem to mirror each other all to well. Sylvia Day, this was not a great move for you, which really sucks because I was REALLY a fan of the Crossfire trilogy.... Not so much anymore.
B00BSBUZPK|5.0|Being an avid Eagles fan it wouldn't have had to be very good to get 5 stars, but it was excellent.  Lots of things I didn't know plus the bonus DVD showing concert footage.<br />Worth the money!

B00969GFFU|4.0|BLURB..........<br /><br />An international bestseller and the novel of the year, `Freedom' is an epic of contemporary love and marriage.<br /><br />This is the story of the Berglunds, their son Joey, their daughter Jessica and their friend Richard Katz. It is about how we use and abuse our freedom; about the beginning and ending of love; teenage lust; the unexpectedness of adult life; why we compete with our friends; how we betray those closest to us; and why things almost never work out as they `should'. It is a story about the human heart, and what it leads us to do to ourselves and each other.<br /><br />I have avoided reading this book for a year or so, somewhat put off by the size of the volume, some 600-odd pages in length........not as long as some books on the TBR pile........ Robert Littell's The Company awaits further down the line at 900'ish! I just prefer reading shorter, sharper books.<br /><br />The book follows Patty and Walter Berglund, though mainly Patty through high school and college into middle age, traversing friendships, romance, marriage and parenthood and the inter-action of the older Berglunds with their neighbours, children, best (or worst) friend Richard and extended families. Franzen dissects and documents the mundane and everyday occurrences as well as those out of the ordinary. The devil is in the detail and Franzen skilfully and sometimes humorously examines the hurts and pain each one of them feels and imparts on to the others.<br /><br />Franzen could be commentating on anyone of us, or all of us. There's nothing particularly special or worthy about the Berglunds, that sets them apart from the rest of us trying to negotiate a way through life. I suppose that was a big part of the novel's enjoyment for me.<br /><br />To be perfectly honest though, I didn't really warm to Patty Berglund and as a result didn't connect with her pain, her traumas and her life issues, though I didn't find myself despising her at any point either.<br /><br />Best bit of the book, Walter and his speech-giving, a proper laugh out loud comedy moment for me.<br /><br />I haven't read Franzen before, but being the greedy, avaricious accumulator that I am, I have The Corrections and The Twenty-Seventh City on pile TBR. I'll read them some time in the next 20-years, but won't be rushing to acquire his next tome.<br /><br />In my opinion, John Irving does it better, probably with a touch more of the absurd but he's made me care more for his characters particularly in \\"Garp\\" and \\"Owen Meany.\\"<br /><br />Some commentators have described this as the \\"novel of the year,\\" NO WAY!<br /><br />Good, maybe a 3 plus out of 5, okay 4 then, but I wouldn't even class it as the best book I've read this month.<br /><br />My copy was acquired second-hand from one of the local charity shops in sunny Leighton Buzzard - a bargain at 50p!r />Best bit of the book, Walter and his speech-giving, a proper laugh out loud comedy moment for me.<br /><br />I haven't read Franzen before, but being the greedy, avaricious accumulator that I am, I have The Corrections and The Twenty-Seventh City on pile TBR.

B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love this series. I think it is my favorite one of all. I hope it continues for many more seasons.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I thought this would be an incredibly emotional book to read and while I did have a few tears throughout the book, I loved it! I think this is a youth book, but I thought the topic was really well written for a person of any age. It is a quick read, but a good one that will keep you thinking.

B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Downton Abby season 1 - 3 is just plane good. The cast and plot are wonderful. It is worth a Recommended seeing.
B00BEXB18M|4.0|I'll start by saying that Super Collider is awesome and is a much more diverse album than Megadeths last two albums. This album will be polarizing among fans depending on what you're into. The oldschool thrash diehards will be disappointed that it's not as fast and thrash as Endgame or Rust in Peace but fans that dig metal AND a broad variety of other stuff should be happy with it. I've heard it being compared to Cryptic Writings and Risk and I completely disagree with that. It's a much better album than both of those (and much heavier). It stands on it's own and thats one of the things I like about it. I don't think it's fair to compare it to any previous albums because it's different enough to be it's own entity. That being said... My best effort at describing it would be Endgame meets Youthanasia but I'm not sure thats really accurate either. If you like \\"The Right to Go Insane\\" from Endgame you probably like this album. From a production point of view the album sounds great. I thought United Abominations , Endgame , and Thirteen all had a similar sound. I liked all 3 albums but the actual sound of the records was starting to get stale / familiar. Super Collider sounds fresh and new. Dave seems to be experimenting more with different effects , different textural embellishments , and switching up the sound of the vocals. I think the vocals sound much better on this album than on previous efforts in part due to how they are recorded. Dave seems to be writing for himself on this record rather than trying to please the existing fanbase and recreate the old stuff. I respect that and the album is better for it.There also seems to be an effort to inject a bit more melody and hooks that have been missing on the last 3 albums. They aren't always successful but when they are it really works. \\"The Blackest Crow\\" may very well be one of my favorite Megadeth songs ever and it's one of the slowest tunes on the album. It's got a feel similar to Wanderlust off of the Risk album(because of the bluegrass / bluesy sound) but it's a much darker and heavier song, Lyrically and vocally , my favorite on the entire album. On the negative side of things there are a couple of songs (Like Burn) with painfully corny lyrics despite the solid riffs. The album as a whole may be slower than the classic stuff (and Endgame) but the guitars are most definitely heavy. Let me stress to those who are influenced by negative reviews of this album that there is no lack of HEAVY on this record. It is loud , the guitars are heavy , and it's still a metal record despite having a few tracks that are more \\"Rock\\" oriented. I found Super Collider to be a breath of fresh air honestly. It sounds like Dave and the guys had fun writing this record. There's a variety on this disk that wasn't found on the last 3 albums. I hope they continue to experiment and aren't afraid to try new things. Super Collider still sounds like Megadeth!!! This is not another \\"Risk\\". This is a metal record made by band who aren't content to repeat themselves.

This show had that \\"Twilight Zone \\" , ring to it when you watch the first season , it was wonderful , a island where the sick became well . Who wouldn't want to be on that island ? , No way its all a reality check into death in the final show . Seems JJ was more interested into getting his hands on Star Trek at the time , and lost interest in his show . Shame the writers gave up on its Fans , This show could had went on for many years, and what ever became of the Actors ? Nothing . Only one or two made it into another tv show . I gave it 3 stars only cuz Im a fan .

The character development is seriously flawed and I no longer like any of them.  It's not at all erotic but rather a bore over the top with words & phrases but no emotion & no heat.  The long publication delay between 2 & 3 made the story lose momentum and 2 more after this..............where could they possibly go as it's reached the end of the literary drivel line.
B00992CF6W|4.0|Please have your updates come as fast as the phone ones plz. That would really help with me connecting my kindle to my phone
B00A8ECU24|5.0|This game is really fun! There is so many things to buy and you make money so fast! The selection of ponies you can get is huge and awesome! The only thing I didn't like was that you have to be connected to a social network to add friends just  to get Zecora!
B0035WTE52|5.0|I love vinyl. The art of the LP is much more interesting that the CD. (Eu amo vinil. A arte do LP é muito mais interessante do que a do CD.)
B006Y5EDRG|5.0|Characters, conflict, cunning, cut-throat politics - this show has that and all set to music.  A stellar production and highly addictive.  The cast and story line are first rate in all respects.  Highly recommend it for anyone who likes theatre, likes a good story, likes a bit of backhanded badness.  It's all here.
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|This game is amazing all though I don't think u should have to have a certain number of stars to proceed
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book is so heartfelt and has so many genres I truly enjoy. I can definitely see me reading this book over and over!!!
B000NGTJTY|5.0|All star cast aside, this a well written movie. While Mark Wahlberg does his typical over-acting, the rest of the cast performs at the level typically expected of them.<br /><br />I highly recommend this for anyone wanting a more cerebral action film.
030788743X|5.0|This book is so so good! I loved it. It's so different than anything I've ever read. I was skeptical when I read the summary but i was pleaseantly surprised by a great story that was wonderfully written.  Couldn't put it down.! I highly recommend it!

B005IFZ36I|4.0|Lovecraft is often portrayed as the successor to Poe in the genre of short horror stories, but after reading Lovecraft's stories (and editing [[ASIN:1933747102 Edgar Allan Poe Annotated and Illustrated Entire Stories and Poems]]), I can tell you that he is no Poe. Lovecraft is much less a pioneer than Poe in both character and Gothic atmosphere. Lovecraft gave us the Cthulhu Mythos of cosmic horrors, of ancient horrors lying dormant, of horrors that transcend space and time and dimensions. He holds his rightful place of high esteem in horror literature for this and must be remembered as a result.<br /><br />Lovecraft studied Poe. He worshiped him and rightly so. He wrote \\"The Outsider\\" in apparent homage to Poe. But the similarities stop there. Let's not forget that Poe wrote 80-100 years before Lovecraft, too. Lovecraft also used the word \\"foetid\\" more than any other writer that has ever lived by a factor of ten, but that's another article. Plus, he looked downright creepy, too. Although Lovecraft was no Poe he gave us some great stories and these are my favorites:<br /><br />\\"The Call of Cthulhu\\"<br />\\"The Colour Out of Space\\"<br />\\"The Dunwich Horror\\"
B005IQ39AY|5.0|This game is very addictive and fun!  Good entertainment. Love it. I would recommend this game for anyone. Have fun!
B00992CF6W|5.0|this app is worth seven dollars. I encourage the download of this app.The possibilities are endless.I already have a full city within weeks
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Loving this game. Finding it challenging, but in a good way. After a while you start to feel bad for the character when he flips over and you hear &quot;crunch&quot; LoL
0380729407|3.0|On June 5, 2012, Ray Bradbury passed away. Long live Ray Bradbury.<br /><br />To readers he will live on through his myriad short stories and a few novels that are destined to be classics. The first is [[ASIN:B002C8XWUI Fahrenheit 451, The 50th Anniversary Edition]], a nineteenth century classic that warns of the dangers in banning books and censorship. The second Bradbury classic is [[ASIN:0380729407 Something Wicked This Way Comes]], with a title no less intriguing than the first.<br /><br />In SWTWC Bradbury has given the world a fiendish tale reflected through the eyes of two young boys and their wonderment of a traveling circus. At times the metaphors, the similes, the personifications are overwritten; but mostly they sing across this dark field of a novel, soaring over flapping circus tents and the bizzarrie inside them. Though lesser known than the decade older \\"Fahrenheit 451,\\" SWTWC is a classic that will be read for decades to come.<br /><br />Ray Bradbury isn't dead. He lives on. Long live Ray Bradbury.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I have insomnia. I have actually been able to get many decent nights sleep since downloading this program. It has been a total blessing!
B00BEXB18M|1.0|Being a fan of CW, RISK, UA, Endgame as well as the classic stuff; I am disgusted by Mustaine's lazy attempt that is Super Collider. Talk about phoning in an album. You would think Mustaine would want to put out the very best product he can being on a new label and all that has some marketing muscle. Not even Universal can successfully market this turd of a recording to any degree of success. Maybe Megadeth will get dropped by Universal, can't say I would blame them for not wanting this Megacrap in their catalog.

B009LMTDL0|3.0|I really wanted this book to be great with all the hype around it.  If you are a CEO, COO, VP or President then you will love this book.  For the everyday women out in the work world it is ok.  It is still worth the read...just not a 5 star read!
B000SEGUDE|5.0|I don't really write reviews but after reading this book, i had to write a review for it!  I think this is one of my favorite books of all time.  I think david mitchell is a superb writer and can't wait to see the movie!!  This book is a definite re-read for sure.  When you have discussions with people about the book you always think to yourself at least once during the discussion, \\"wow, i never thought about it like that.\\"  and then you want to re-read the story!  this book is amazing how it is set up, i've never seen anything like it.  I want to get it in paperback now just in case my kindle fritzes out!!! what a great book!
B004SBS8LA|5.0|my girls just love it and they play it all the time and would get more for them to play
B009B1UZ7C|5.0|I loved listening to this debut  CD where each song featured an intricate portrait with a mixture of social commentary, personal introspection, and romantic ambivalence.
B00BCK1A5G|5.0|This book has cemented my opinion of Ms. Singh as a truly remarkable author. Both her psy-changeling and Angels series are amongst my favorite. I awaited the release of this book with anticipation and excitement, and I was not disappointed. I read this book within 24 hours and can't wait for her next one.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Now if they would only let me add a row of number keys at the top, like the stock Samsung keyboard, it would be perfect!
B009UX2YAC|3.0|This game is fun for a little while but if you play it to a lot, often you get bored and quit.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|This app has been enjoyed by my grandsons.  They say I should tell you that it is very fun to play.  They enjoy interacting with the fish and plants.<br />  The background music is very nice and the graphics are beautiful.
B000Q6GUTI|5.0|I enjoyed this movie when I saw it on TNT.  That is why I purchased it.  I wanted my friends and other family members to view it.  It was followed by &#34;Four Brothers&#34; on TNT.  Both movies are of the same sort.  The movies are &#34;guy&#34; movies, but I am a girl and really liked them.  Because the &#34;Shooter&#34; WON against the corruptness of the government, I was delighted!  It was timely.
B0085YOD1A|5.0|I love this app. Tells me everything I eanted to know. I really wanted to know what percent my phone was at without having to go through settings and all that. It's right at the top so you always know.good job!
B0069JBKHI|1.0|I have ordered a replacement one so hopefully the new unit will work properly.  The one day it worked, it had decent video quality, had a nice night light the could rotate colors, but the microphone option to talk through the unit just locked up the app everytime you tried to use it.  Hoping the new unit will actually so I can update my review!
B0071XO8RA|4.0|This series kept my attention from beginning to end. Have already purchased the Shift Omnibus Edition to continue the story.
B00AMBH70S|5.0|Wasn't sure about a Bourne movie without Matt Damon but this was a different take on the movies and it was great. I have liked Jeremy Renner in every one of his movies or tv shows.  He is great in this movie.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I love this series, good and fast paced but this last book really left me hanging.  The book seemed like it ended too kick with so many unanswered questions.  I will definitely not pre-order next time (if there is one) and will wait for a lower price if this is what I get for my money.  Gosh I am just so disappointed.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|Martin is a master storyteller who has created a complex world with a dizzying array of characters. I love the fantasy of that world and the reality of his characters, for that is how people really are, not all good and not all bad. Martin's world is a violent one, for sure, but so is the one we live in. On a side note, I was impressed with the fidelity HBO gave to the screenplays of GOT; that is, until the Red Wedding episode. They took the violence over the top, killing sympathetic characters that Martin allowed to escape. The backlash has been aimed at Martin, and that's too bad.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|bloons 5 is a cool game. Its a lot better than bloons 4. It has new towers like the helicopter- new maps- and new up-grades!
B0058VW36U|5.0|I love your game but I think that you have to put it free for a limited time cause many people do not have money to pay it.<br /><br />adoro su juego pero creo que tendrian que ponerlo gratis por un tiempo porque hay gente que no lo puede pagar.
B00124PXW8|5.0|I'm a hard core Horror Movie buff.  If it's Horror, I've seen it (good, bad or indifferent) But this one is still my all time favorite based on creep factor alone.  Still a must see.  There's no fancy CGI in this one, just good ol' special effects makeup, but the story line holds this one together well.  An EXCELLENT film!
B009LMTDL0|5.0|I would read this book over and over again just to remind myself to never stop leaning in or keeping my hand raised. :-)
B0045EJY90|3.0|It's OK, Display is not as great as raving. Just a couple lines. It names files Aux8, etc.<br />The only thing you can record is CD's to a USB stick.  You cannot record blank CD's<br /><br />When I saw AUX in the specifications. I thought I'd be able to plug a turntable into it.<br />It was very hard to see a pix of the rear of the unit. If I could have I'd look for RCA inputs, which it did not have.<br />The price of it is OK, so I guess I'll keep it for a backup CD player.
B001AH6ZWY|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie. Great concept and makes you think about what actually may have happened, but Mr Garrison from South Park said it the best though. \\"Waited the entire movie to see the god damn aliens and it turned out to be her god damn father!\\" Haha! Classic.
B0000E1WKE|5.0|After listening to the holiday songs I ordered two more CD's for Xmas gifts.  They also enjoyed it.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|She copies the concept of 50 Shades of Gray...but differs in that the author of 50 Shades of Gray made it a trilogy and it was good.  Entwined with You was awful.  I will not be purchasing anything else written by this author.
B005GFPZYK|2.0|Skipped a lot of it, not that great. Lots of bs about how great it is to be a Texan and his bar fights, very boring.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|I always enjoy his books! As usual there were some parts that broke my heart but the ending showed that true love conquers.
B000062XFG|5.0|LaForge and Worfs' characters move up in rank and get to do more which offsets the fact that the doctor was replaced for this season and returned the next one.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|Very interesting read.  First Stephen King book I have ever read.  I like how he explores the idea of time travel and its consequences.  He did a great job of taking the reader back into the late 50s & early 60s.  Characters were interesting and book was suspenseful.  A good read and definitely generates food for thought.
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|Great graphics. Challenging and addictive.  Took me awhile to figure out what I was supposed to do but it soon becomes clear. Works well on s Kindle Fire.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|This is a really addictive game. I love playing it but because its so addictive I get a little aggrevated. Over all its a good game and I recoment it to anyone
B000127LW2|5.0|this one was good because it was like the next generation in that it has depth in that it explored the characters but it was also like the fun of the original in that they can get away from convention because they are way out in space.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|my brother has lots of disabilities and with this book i feel that i can empathize with him even more. R.J. palacio portrays auggie so well.
B00CY1JUW2|5.0|This is easily their best album to date. I can listen to it from beginning to end and not skip a single song. QotSA delivers yet again ...like clockwork.
B00BN3DPQ4|4.0|A very pleasant surprise and quite underrated. A lot of action and humor. I purchased it on Blu-Ray and look forward to watching it again.
B0002I831S|5.0|i recommend all three seasons of this series.  it was the first star trek series and the characters are more lighthearted and the plot is more lighthearted than the later series that focused more on the characters but that was just reflective of the eras involved.  there is some exploration of the spock character as he is the nonhuman crewmember.  this is an innocent series that has an uplifting view of the future and is innocent and wholesome.
B00BMR5HOO|3.0|The Glitching on the Weather App is Ok but the Locations is not right. I Want this App fixed ASAP!
B009EEFTMC|3.0|This is a fun time-waster.  But!  Every 4 or 5 games my computer (Windows 7) freezes and I have to reboot.  Any fix for this?
B007SGLZH6|5.0|An expert guide to making exceptional bread by an experienced professional. The book guides beginners through the artisan bread making process and addresses process nuances and their reason for the benefit of experienced bread makers. Ken's information is valuable given he was educated by some of the best breadmakers in the industry both locally and abroad
B0007TKH66|5.0|the third and the fourth seasons weren't as good.  these first two fit the trek mold.  while they were a bit slower in pace and had more primitive technology than other trek series the first two seasons taught lessons.
B009ZXT4BY|2.0|this game does not give you anytime to do anything Think about the poor people for once. you don't even have time to put one block down
B003IEJZUG|5.0|Why did I wait so long to read this...?<br /><br />I enjoyed this book and wish I had read it sooner. I was thrilled with every chapter and wondering where in the world Pi was going to end up. And I personally liked the parts of religion that are brough into the story. Great read and now I will be able to watch the movie.
B00CW665VI|5.0|I very witty read, refreshing to read a romance based off of a guy's view, Very well written and I laughed so many times during this book, enjoyed it!!!
0240815807|5.0|I know that's not what it's titled, but it might as well be, it is easy to read and while Mike does get somewhat technical, it's still easy to understand. While I haven't read all of it yet, by the time I'm done, I'm convinced I will be able to mix just about anything.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|You need to give this book a chance. I think this book is the best out of the 3. Gideon and Eva are great characters. I can't wait for the next book.
048623231X|5.0|Gustave Dore, the most successful illustrator of the 19th century, has produced a grim, dark, precise, nightmare masterwork in his illustrations for the Divine Comedy by Dante. For those familiar with the vast poem, The Divine Comedy, it is obvious that Dore knew the work well and in his grisly etchings captures the terror that dwells at the edge of each scene. Dore is a master of strategic composition with his careful, thoughtful arrangements of dark and light so as to direct the eye of the viewer to the center of interest. In misery the souls of the dead get into Charon's boat and are taken across the River Acheron. Dante mixed pagan and Christian images in the underworld and Dore captures both. Dante is lead into Limbo by the pagan Roman poet Virgil where he meets the great poets of antiquity who can never cross into heaven due to their pagan beliefs. Dante is often pictured clinging to Virgil as the souls of the dead reach for him. As Dante and Virgil cross the Styx, the doomed lost souls come out of the water and attempt to cling to the boat. Demons are illustrated in the classical bat wing style, but looking oily due to Dore's illustration skills. It only makes sense that pagan mythological creatures would reside in the inferno as they were pre-Christian. Thus Dante and Virgil encounter a Minotaur and Centaurs. Suicides become gnarly trees, sexual seducers are whipped by demons, while flatterers live in a pond of feces. The journey gets worse as they encounter damned souls that are so grossly disfigured that their dismantled body parts all act independently. Forgers must itch and scratch into eternity. Traitors are frozen for eternity in ice with only their heads above the water and ice line. Of course there are historic and church figures throughout for Dante made commentary about those in public and religious life with whom he disagreed. Purgatory is full of naked people but is far less interesting than the inferno. The images of Paradise are anemic in comparison to those of the Inferno. The book is actually fun to view, packed with full page illustrations, and wonderfully creepy illustrations of the tortures of Hell.
B00B8WXG9G|1.0|Very slow and tedious did not enjoy listen to this ablum at all.. Sorry Paul.. not your best work.. The
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|This is the correct cable that is required to recharge the Kindle Fire so I feel that it is a good value for the money.<br />I received it before the date promised so that was even more acceptable.<br />Cost was not a problem because delivery was to my door and I had to waste no time shopping or driving anywhere.<br />rg
B009UX2YAC|3.0|I love playing the game!let me first cover that.<br />If  you like twmple run you'll like this,its always changing and adding new things to keep you from getting bored!! There are many charcters and boards to choose from and any adequate gamer will easily conquer the game and quickly make enough coins to buy other characters and boards!<br /> What kept me from giving it five stars....<br />I recently had a few problems with the game update,and emailed kilo support team for help. All in all ,I got better help,and more caring person from blizzard(yes I know its other gamers) more then once. My first problem was that they couldn't tell me anything beyond we can't help you. Why have a support team who one,has no care in the world to even be polite to answer the gamer? There was no I'm sorry or anything,just plain I can't help you. I've worked in customer service,so I understand some customers are less then worthy of polite conversation,but I never once gave them reason to be rude! Secondary,I don't think the help team can really be called that when they obviously don't know what I'm talking about. It was very unsatisfactory for someone who is meant to help you. As long as you don't need help,this game is great
030789701X|5.0|Definitely worth the purchase .Big well made.and paper that is heavy grade but easy to flip.Covers almost anything you can dream
B00BCK1A5G|5.0|I've just finished reading the latest Nalini Singh psy-changeling novel &#34;Heart of Obsidian&#34; and I loved it. This series is my favourite series but what I really enjoyed about this latest addition is that I wasn't overwhelmed with reappearances of previous characters who then take over the book with their own continuing story. Instead this was a book of the hero and heroine and in a long running series it was nice to see that.<br /><br />I'm not going to mention who the main characters in the book are because I deliberately avoided reading any spoilers or excerpts of this, like the author intended, and I enjoyed the book so much more due to that. If you haven't yet read this series you need to start with the first book and enjoy the ride until you reach this one and you will appreciate it all the more because of that.<br /><br />I cannot recommend this book highly enough and now I'm off to re-read and enjoy the series all over again
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Sylvia did not disappoint. This continuation of Eva and Gideon' s story was heartwarming, yet still kept you on your toes wondering what was going to face them next. Looking forward to the next two books.
B00BESJYAY|5.0|I did not realize this was based on a true story.  It was an entertaining movie for the whole family.  My 9 year old daughter wanted to watch it again.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I have to say that since this book came out I've been dying to write a positive  review to counteract all of the unfair 1 star reviews that people keep giving over the fact that this series  didn't end with Entwined with you. Are you kidding me? How childish can you be? Who doesn't want more Gideon? Yeah it sucked that this book took so long to come out and that the release was pushed  twice but that doesn't take away from the writing and the story which was strong and compelling from start to finish. These two have  too many issues that wrapping it up this quickly would have ruined  the book and made it disingenuous. So many women including  myself are devastated when we have  to say goodbye to our favorite characters. We are lucky to get 2 more books; however the  publishers should do a better job with releasing the books closer to each other. Lastly, why is everyone all bent out of shape over the supposed cliff hanger? There wasn't one! Everyone is getting their panties all up in a bunch.  Thank you Sylvia for another great book and its a shame it's not getting the praise it deserves!
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|What happened in this book Silvia???  I feel the characters didn't match the other two books. Maybe in the offtimes it took to get this book published you should have re-read books 1 & 2.  In the last chapter of book 2 Gideon was telling Eva I love you and now for some reason he can't???  He is using her safeword to tell her. This would have been a great love story if it ended at their marriage but no you had to make that complicated too. The plot was hard to follow and I ended the book having more questions than answers. I can't believe I waited all these months and now will probably have to wait another two years to finish it IF I even buy the other two books!!!!!!!!
B000TEUSJK|3.0|I saw the original movie when it was released years ago...this unrated edition has been edited.  I believe some continuity has been compromised.  The movie is still good and probably represents the &#34;true&#34; Roman culture of the time (as hard as it may be to swallow).
B005CRQ3RK|5.0|The book is a classic,and I hope you(the reader)will enjoy it.<br />To be honest,I've read better books but this one is hilarious
B00CKOYVG8|5.0|Another Angry birds game, allows for variety  Good choice.  Ordered for my grandson to play when I'm busy and it keeps him occupied.
B009LGO88E|4.0|It gives you a perfect grip and for the 2 games I have played that are compatible Resident Evil Revalations and Metal Gear Solid 3 it really makes an improvement. I took off one star due to the lack of games that support it and why did they not make the extended R button just connect to the original R button? That way you can still use it for a grip for games that do not support it but would not have to reach over the CPP R button. Overall I am happy and would recommend getting it.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|Book was enjoyable and entertaining to read. I would recommend this book to others that just wants something fun to read.
B00BN3DPQ4|3.0|Might be worth seeing, but you can go with out, could have been better but script and director are mediocre
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love minecraft I love it because if I don't have WiFi I can still play it.<br /><br />It is so helpful.<br /><br /> I LOVE this game
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Okay so, I got this game thinking it wasn't going to be all that great. Man, was I wrong. The music is amazing, it kept me wondering it something was going to jump out and scare me! I personally can't wait for another room... I don't see how the makers are going to top themselves but, I still can't wait! Bottom line...get the app!
B006LSZECO|4.0|The book kept my interest, I didn't want to put it down.<br />The character after a while was not really believable.
B007REV4YI|3.0|Might be worth seeing, but you can go with out, could have been better but script and director are mediocre
B004W2UBYW|4.0|I thought the author did a good job of showing all sides of Jobs and he has an interesting style that didn't drag at all.  It certainly gave me more insight into the company and the people who built it.
1400049628|4.0|Very good and informational book to keep around incase of a zombie uprising.  Lots of dos and don'ts. All around a good book
B00459EZLW|5.0|Spoiler alert...<br />When will they be found, I am so hopeful this series will be picked up and continue, I was not ready for it to end!
B00CL0J99K|3.0|it tries to be a comedy, needs to be edited, the script could have been better, and a bit of a weak ending definitely not the best Iron man, but worth seeing
B0061PEAUY|3.0|Kathy Reichs is a brilliant scientist, and also a very good writer, the only thing I have against her writing is her trying to explain the process of her science in overdrawn explanations, just give me the facts and I will draw my own conclusions. The book was a good one, sad in its scope but something that unfortunately we see again and again. The process of the investigation is what holds your interest.
0061433047|5.0|I've enjoyed his writing style for some time now ..<br />he's got a good wit, a wonderful sense of humor<br />and he's quite the student of observation (of human life)
B00ADQ7JCS|3.0|Not as good as I had hoped considering it being billed as a prog super group but it contains a couple of gems, the best being the last album track, Carousel.
B005LAIIKI|4.0|Jamie foxx just isnt that good and the story doesnt build enough value to route for Django, bad montages of training,<br /><br />Christoph Waltz is amazing and Leo nails it again, worth seeing but will be a bit disappointed
B0090KZDSK|5.0|Sylvia has delivered again with yet another brilliantly written book in the Crossfire series.<br /><br />I don't like giving away much in reviews so i'll just say if you loved the first 2 books you will not be disappointed with the third book. With the growth of all of the characters we get an even better understanding on what make our  Gideon and Eva tick. This book has everything you could imagine and more with powerful and sensual sex scenes as well as plenty of laughs and twists you wouldn't be expecting.<br /><br />If you haven't started this series yet, what is wrong with you, go on and read book 1 and become a Cross girl too.<br /><br />Totally worth the wait and I can't wait for Sylvia's next book.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|This is my favorite ambience / white noise app among many. Plenty of different sounds with great audio quality. There is also a sleep timer, and the ability to save presets. Very handy, and I use it every night.
B00164GDD2|5.0|This move rocks! Best movie ever! Looks awesome on blue-ray. Had to add it to my movie collection! Thanks Amazon!
B00AS1Q8FW|3.0|Might be worth seeing, but you can go with out, could have been better but script and director are mediocre
B00BFBSV72|4.0|Good for 3-5 year old...does not require too much skill but does have colorful graphics and levels that keeps them occupied ...not a bad investment....
B008JGSM6G|5.0|can play a few take a break then go back and play some more love it keeps one thinking one step ahead
B0051OZ564|3.0|It's good for what it is. There's a lot of psychological subtleties that most people will miss, but for the most part it's entertaining.  Personally, I was liked the music most, but that's just my preference.
B009AMANH4|3.0|Might be worth seeing, but you can go with out, could have been better but script and director are mediocre and the fact its based off the Lincoln cult where he was a saint rather a tyrant butcher who used slavery to destroy the constitution Thomas Di Lorenzo does a good job explaining Lincoln. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbFty9nZUac
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft PE is very fun to play and can get you addicted for hours on in trying to build the best houses you can.
B00AMBLDEE|3.0|Just another of the Bourne movies.  Interesting - - but a little too much of the first movies - - needs a new story line.
8866137626|2.0|Photographing it and passing it to Evernotes it's very easy<br />I only wish it had more pages (I like to make a lot of notes)<br />Don't expect this to be a special notebook, it's just easy to photograph and convert to a digital note, that's it
B005S9EKCW|5.0|An Amazing film it looks crisp and sounds just as clear as it is Beautiful if you have the time and love musical dramas this is the film to own Wow!!
1401938906|3.0|I don't like the style in which this book is written.  Leaves a lot to be desired from those of us who believe that God's spirit is love, and not just our servant.
B00CH87HF4|4.0|Good game for RPG lover's. Only small thing is the control's. Takes a while to get used to. Overall a good game, good story.and action.
B0087HT36U|3.0|The game is fun,  but his part is really lame.<br /> It won't let me go on without rating the game
B009VYF5E2|5.0|Scenery is incredible in Wales and France.  You can see that the moment it starts.  The actors/actresses are more than what they seem when in costume.  It is refreshing to get lost in a series and then have a week to look forward to the next episode.  Only the BBC can do that as they have shown us year after year.
B000FCKGPC|2.0|This isn't as good as the first 3, but it's not as bad as some of the reviews make it out to be.
B008NNNF7G|5.0|I found this cd while I was poking around looking at music on Amazon.  After looking at some of the reviews and listening to the previews I dedided to download the MP3's.  I'm glad I did, this is a really nice cd that in my opinion brings you back to some of the good old Southern Rock genra.  Great vocals, great musicianship and really solid songs.  It reminds me of Lynyrd Skynyrd in a way with their own twist.  If you like Southern Rock, get this, you won't be dissapointed.
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|I love how cute these pudding monsters look like, even the sounds they make. The puzzles are just so much fun to figure out too. I would definitely say &quot;get this&quot;. Plus its too addicting!!
B00B5A9FLY|5.0|I had thought all year that there might be some way to bring back the characters for another season.  Well, BBC squashed that to hell for me and probably millions of others, too.  It's not that I felt I got to know the characters as friends but I made it to comic.com and got to meet &#34;Merlin&#34;--the actors, writers, etc. and everyone there was bowled over.  Like one said American fans are unique--and that's the truth.
B00D1HC8VS|5.0|It's great getting the bonus cd with tracks taken from the Cow Palace concert without having to pay $100 plus.  The only downside to this version is the booklet that's included is very skimpy with no information whatsoever.  Still, you get the remastered music and it sounds great.  But don't pay $30 for it.  You can get it at Best Buy for $16.99.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a great and fun app for all ages my 5 year old brother loves it and so do I and I'm 12
B0085YOD1A|5.0|Awesome app now i can depend on something to tell me how hot my device is.....the condition of my device....and the excact amout of juice/power in my kindle....phone.....and ipad i recommend this a 5star app and a must have app
B001224WBS|3.0|First of all, there's no volume 2 in sight, so if you want the hits not included here you'll have to go search for them.  Weird mix of tunes from all of the bands history.  Early stuff is VERY different from their later work-almost sounds like a different band.  If you like the Mode you've heard on the radio you'd be better off buying their more recent albums and letting this go.
B003XMXZCW|4.0|This is a blend of realism and surrealism.  Francis Coppola renders stories with his signature vision.  If you love film you should have this on your shelf.
B004WGIXX4|5.0|personally I am big Portman fan, so it is an excellent watch for me. I loved it.<br />And I don't mind watching it again
B00COGY2P2|5.0|the movie started out a little slow.  It took a little while for me to accept tom cruise as the character jack reacher.  The last half of the movie had a lot of action and i enjoyed it.
B006PAZMMK|5.0|Great, upbeat mixes that keep me moving through my chores.  A lot of catchy tracks that get stuck in my head.  Check it out.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|I put up a projector and a sheet and did a movie night at home. The kids loved it. This is such a great movie. I'm not a John C. Riley fan, but Sarah Silverman makes up for it.
B00CHNKJFO|4.0|I have to say this is a fantastic pinball game in the FX series. I have played better pinball games but for a fan of both Star Wars and pinball then you can't miss with this game.
B008VBYN80|1.0|Do not get this game. I really liked Clash of Clans on my friends iPad but could not get it on Kindle. I got this, thinking it would be similar, it wasn't. DO NOT GET IT!
B0040JBAMY|5.0|Has all the Queen hits you want and then some lesser known tunes thrown in.  Really great album and a must for any Queen fan.
B003Y8YXEO|5.0|Another great collection of one of music's giants who left us far too early.Someone who is a true master of melody he is up there with Puccini,Bellini,Rossini as one of the all time masters of writting melodies you can't forget nor do you wish to.Buy this and enjoy.
B004GHNIRK|4.0|Having read an excerpt in school, heard and seen parts of the musical, I was anxious to read the book.  It is fairly heavy going, but I am enjoying it when I switch back and forth from other works.  At least on Kindle it isn't heavy!
B00AB7HESI|5.0|I love this game! Invest some money in it, and its the best game ever!!! Its so creative and fun!
B0034KHFM4|5.0|Never gave Gaga much of a chance, but this was on sale so I snagged it.  GREAT STUFF.  Pretty short album, but a good listen.
1594203334|4.0|I have just become a parent. Bombarded by baby books on this and that, Pam Druckerman's book made for fun reading. It also offers a different perspective on parenting and what it entails. The French style of parenting versus the American one is certainly different. Gives you ideas on what works best for you and how best to be a 'good' parent. I would say this should be a must read especially for the varied point of view.
B00BIVN82M|5.0|The entire CD is fun to listen and dance to. You can't go wrong with this new CD from Michael Buble.
B004RJMUJO|5.0|I've always loved thgame but had to play it on other devices until I got a kindle! You should really buy this game!
B007URVZJ6|5.0|Really helped me get my kindle books looking better.  Easy, step by step guide, and had helpful illustrations.  Worth every penny!  ;)
B00ACP3OOM|1.0|Looks nice, but dead on arrival - USB device not recognized.  Has to be returned.  Hmmm maybe should have paid more attention to all the reviews questioning quality control.
B008JJM88Q|1.0|So the app was fun for a couple of days, but then I started getting push notification ads. And immediately after my phone began downloading apps that I had never even looked at (or at least showing shortcuts to them on my home screen) I felt like my phone had been invaded. Do not download this app. Just play the game online, if you really want.
B00C5GZKVQ|3.0|For people who like flight simulators, this is an okay game. Its free and kinda fun. Its different in the way where your an RC helicopter in a house and you get to shoot other RC helicopters with a gun and missles. If your into that, give it a shot!
B000TEMRIU|5.0|Pumpkins are THE band for '90's angst and this is THE album from that period.  The hits are great, but the whole thing together is a masterpiece.
B000H1RFKA|4.0|Fun from start to finish.  The back and forth between RDJ and Val is classic, and you can tell they were having a blast making this.  Too bad a followup never happened.  Imminently rewatchable.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I love this game but it keeps crashing when I try to open it.<br />other then this most addicting game ever:)
B009KS4XRO|4.0|It's very addictive I've spent hours playing. I just wish u didn't need facebook to finish rooms. Other than that i love playing.
B009YU62H2|4.0|Good album.  Sounds like their old stuff, but none of the tracks really stand out.  Worthing listening to, but nothing here will get stuck in your head.
B009RH9J7W|2.0|I really did not like the color.  I ordered a black one and you sent me a gray one.  I am really not happy with this product.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I play a lot and a good app that goes good with minecraft is pocket Inveditor good for hackers. have fun.
B0006L0LOS|5.0|I love this move it can in a nice case. It has lots of stunts and Halle Berry looks beautiful in it.
B007M45PMU|5.0|Bought it just for Hey Ho, but all the tunes on this are great.  Smooth sounds all the way through, I find it very relaxing.
B00992CF6W|1.0|The android and ios users already have the 0.7.1 update and we don't I want to play with my friends and I can't for that reason so please update because this is poop
B008XNZMOU|4.0|The CD is in great condition. However, I'm not a big Taylor Swift fan. It's okay. Another CD to add to the collection!
B009GEYX5E|4.0|The color when the picture comes out is wonderful and has that nice vintage look. When looking fot film for my Polaroid I wasnt sure if this would work bu t I tried it and it wotks perfect.
B005DOJ68K|5.0|Really great album.  Has all of the favorites and some lesser known &#34;hits&#34;.  Classic CCR and worth putting in your cloud.
B00AQF8CJ0|4.0|This is your basic run of the mill puzzle app. I like the gameplay and look of the app. It is challenging at times and I think they do a good job of introducing new factors of the gameplay to keep players interested. I would recommend this app to anyone who enjoys games  like cut the rope or flow, as well as those who have an urge to get perfect ratings on all the levels of games. Connecting the blobs together completes the level, while connecting them over all the stars gets you a perfect, which is nice because it lets the game appeal to players of all skill levels.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|This is a great app.very easy to use,and the steps to follow are very well explained and clear,I'll highly recomend this app.
B007MU85D0|5.0|There are literally no bad tracks on this album.  They're all great and I've listened to it again and again.  Great buy!
B003Y5H5AG|5.0|I had to get this movie for my great-niece and I enjoyed the movie also. It is funny and interesting.
B001RHPJBU|3.0|Songs are just OK.  Listening makes me realize how much more I like Collins when he's fronting Genesis.  Pass if you're not a hardcore fan.
B005LAIIJY|5.0|This movie shows how the old days were, at least some of it. The movie is very interesting. I actually seen this movie at the theatre and just had to purchase it.
B0011Z5IXC|5.0|I'm not a huge Zeppelin fan, so this album was perfect.  I got all the hits and few lesser known tracks.  Satisfies my Zeppelin cravings.
B004DK5CYM|5.0|This is one of the beautiful stories I've ever watched. Brings tears to my eyes everytime I watch the last race!
B0087240Z4|5.0|Sounds like the old Pumpkins from the '90's.  If you like that, you'll love this.  Album really flows and is worth a listen and another, and another, and another...
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|I am one of the many Downton Abbey fans around the world. Everything is absolutely perfect; the writing, the acting, the directing, the clothes, the amenities....where can I buy one of those beautiful table lamps from Season 2 with the pink tassled shade and cream/gold base??!!!
B005RAO0GS|5.0|Really intense album.  Not a bad track on this one.  Check it out.  You won't be dissapointed.  Florence has a powerful voice.
B001JRB16U|5.0|I purchased this movie for my grandson after renting it for him. At six, he loved the magic and the dancing!! Couldn't have been more pleased!
B000B5MI3Q|2.0|The watch arrived soon after I paid to have the shipping expedited.  It looks good, it feels good, it is the dive watch that I have wanted for years.  I set it to the correct time and date and put it on.  Within 2 hours the day indicator changed to the spanish indicator.  I readjusted it back to english, a couple of hours later I noticed it was back on spainish.  Again, I adjusted it back to english and later that evening, it was back on spanish.  I set it back to english and that is the way I packed it up to send back.  Having to adjust it 3 times within 12 hours of owning it was too much.  Overall I am disappointed because I have always wanted a seiko dive watch.  I gave it 2 stars because the fit and finish were nice.  If it operated correctly, it would have been my everyday go to watch.  Now I am going to give a shot to the citizen version. Wish me luck.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Everyone 8 and older should read this book!  It's about being different and coping with the often unkind reactions of others.  It's about Augie's courage and even the courage of some of his friends who are able to see past his physical deformities.  I absolutely loved it!!
B00A8ECU24|5.0|Good and smooth game design. Land building is pretty simple and the quest system gives good rewards. Fun! Definitely recommended.
B005LAIIQC|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie and hope they make more movies with these characters.  It's fun, intense and a good story.  I've watched it many times.
1742200508|3.0|A single volume travel guide for England is not something that I would recommend. There is simply too much material to cover and one would be far better off with a couple detailed regional guides.  No sane person is going to attempt a single-visit comprehensive tour of this country anyway.  I wouldn't even recommend a single-visit comprehensive tour of just London.<br /><br />The Lonely Planet guide to England tries to be comprehensive (846 pages in all) and to do so with small print in a book of small dimensions that could fit in your luggage or backpack. It breaks England (???) into 12 districts, and begins with a trip planning section (the only thing that might be considered causal reading). Each district's section includes Lonely Planet's top 5 suggestions for Best Places to Eat and Best Places to Stay. Everything is cursory as are the tiny maps.<br /><br />At the end are general sections that might be called \\"Britain 101\\" for those in a huge hurry and with minimal interest.  As with other Lonely Planet guides this one also comes with a small pull-out map (in this case of London); which is a serviceable guide to the underground routes and tube stations if you are changing planes at Heathrow and have a 12-hour layover to visit the city. This guide would be useful in determining the two or three districts you want to build your visit around, then you can purchase guides for each one and leave this at home.  If you actually visit Britain you will want to take real maps with you.<br /><br />Then again, what do I know?  I'm only a child.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|I really like this movie.  It's fun, good story and the Heroes figure out how to win.  I even got all the individual movies with the Marvel characters to know the back stories.  These are fun for the whole family.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|Couldn't put this book down, read it while waiting a swimming lessons, while cooking supper...even told my husband he should back off if he wanted to live during the final two chapters.
B003H6KRIE|5.0|I have watched and re-watched these movies.  I really enjoy them and their story.  'Bourne Identity' is my favorite followed by 'Bourne Supremacy', although I enjoyed Marie's character and didn't like that outcome.  We don't care for the 3rd move, 'Bourne Ultimatum' as much because of what we call the \\"shaky cam\\".  I get dizzy from all the movement.
B004AUGJS8|3.0|The movie was okay. It seemed to be an average form of entertainment with the bizarre character of the husband.
0811879542|4.0|Gave this as a gift to 4 yr old and it was funny seeing the adults trying to figure it out. They were expecting it to do something when you pressed the dot, like a real app. LOL. I like that it encourages kids to follow directions in a fun way.
B004GJDQT8|3.0|I am still a little concerned about the security of the phone system in protecting my personal information. I am trying to learn to trust it.
B00A0MJA1I|4.0|This is the first Disney blu-ray I've watched and its impressive and the picture quality is amazing. It's doesn't fill up my widescreen TV, I guess because its an older film, but its not bad.  I haven't seen this film in forever and while watching it with my 2 yr. old I never noticed all the anger. The dad's shouting, there's fighting, tinker bell and the mermaids do mean things to Wendy, etc. I'm surprised its rated G. I guess it's a more suitable G movie for an older child. I'm going to sit this one to the side for a couple of years.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|Although it took me a chapter or two to get into the story and develop a connection to the main character, I quickly fell in love with this story. The book is fast paced, fanciful and well written. The photos are a really cool addition as well. The only thing I didn't like is that it ended so abruptly! Can't wait until the next book comes out in January 2014 (yes, I checked).
B00005JNX0|5.0|The first two Madagascars are so funny!  I wish there was less fighting because we tell our son hands are not for hitting. Other than that, it's great family entertainment.  I waited for the price to get down to under $7 before purchasing.
B00CATSONE|4.0|This was a fascinating look at the mind and life of Nicolai Tesla, and the reader will learn a thing or two about Edison and other figures of this era.
B0039N74CW|5.0|The Shrek movies are funny. Yes there's some crude humor but my 2 yr old doesn't get it. He just smiles at the characters. This is the only movie he has sat through. I waited for this to drop to under $5 before purchasing.
B001PPLIFU|4.0|I never heard of J Bond before in my life. I'm glad I did, now I know all about it. THanks.
B001AQR3JY|5.0|My 2 yr old loves music and everyone knows how amazing the music is in this film. He also likes animals so I thought he would appreciate all of the animals. He didn't seem too interested the first time I turned it on. He enjoys his PBS shows more right now, especially Super Why! (See my review on those DVDs).  It's a great investment for years to come, especially for road trips.
B005GG0MIS|5.0|Tells you more things things than you can imagine and I thought I knew so much about presidential politics. Fascinating read!
B0000BWVCM|5.0|I got this for a steal (less than $4) and its a great addition to my X-men collection!  I like that they use Storm more in this one.
B00CATSONE|4.0|Great minds not always rewarded.  Tesla was the master mind behind Americas industrialization and electrification.  His namesake car may yet celebrate his genius by its' success
B00005JKDR|5.0|Who couldn't love Boo!  My 22 month old doesn't get scared by the monsters. Movies don't keep his attention as well as PBS shows like Super Why! (See my review on those DVDs) but its a great investment.
B00C33M2EE|5.0|This includes both video dvd and audio cd of the music.  Fresh, crisp arrangements for piano and cello, flawlessly performed and amazing video.  Great job to a bunch of very talented artists.
4883191028|4.0|The book arrived in fairly good condition - the penciled-in notes are easy enough to erase wherever needed.  I only hoped it would have come with its original cover.  All the same, I'm glad to have this book - It's helping me a lot in my continuing studies.
0425263924|5.0|So let see, many are bombing the book, not really sure why. I thought it was true to form, Eva always unsure of her self and Gideon reminding her that she amazing. Both helping each other to grow and surviving their mistakes and past. Was this book my favorite no, but it was good and I look forward to the next book, because I knew she was not done, she put that rumor to rest months ago. Thank you for another enjoyable read. Continued Crossfire fan!
B00AYB0TOW|3.0|Too much red in this movie.  I was bored and needed to see a &#34;good&#34; sci-fi action movie.  This movie has action, and all kinds of killing - however, the &#34;good&#34; wasn't there.
B00B7Y0206|1.0|I don't like this app it wouldn't even let me get into the app it kept saying &quot;force close&quot; every time I click on it
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Irresistible. Can't leave trying this game again and again. Its addictive and easy to play. Can be played at anytime
B003ODL004|5.0|Next to John Williams, Hans Zimmer is one of the best composers out there for music. In fact (as hard to believe) this movie would not have been half as good as it was without the music behind it.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|Makes it very easy for you to dig deep into the directory and find out any files/folders that is not shown in Kindle.
B00000FC5H|5.0|Having just attended a live performance of EW&F, I can attest that this CD has all their hits - there is not a &#34;unknown&#34; or filler in the bunch. A &#34;must have&#34; - you will be so happy to own this!
B0050DZ8J0|5.0|This is the best app to connect to you professionals, network with like minded individuals as well as great tool to search jobs.
B004P1JDJO|4.0|Good material simply delivered. Nothing flashy, easy to digest. Not overly academic, put in language anyone can understand and share. Worthy reading.
B005LHOKFS|5.0|The best of this is to read reviews of other travellers which helps you decide your itinerary. Would refer it to anyone.
B000P3G8XK|5.0|Must see...must have for any resistance training individual regardless of whether you compete or not. Apparently you have to be excessively wordy to leave a comment.
B008BU75IQ|2.0|The book seemed like the author was obligated to finish the series and wrapped it up as quickly as possible. The ending was a big disappoint , after giving so much of my time to the story I felt cheated.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|I love games with hidden objects.  This game has them and so much more. You really use your brain on it.
B00AQF8CJ0|4.0|It was fun and challenges the mind.  Would recomend for all ages. Hard at first but easy to get the hang of for the nonperfectionist
B009LGO88E|5.0|Item is great for those who has an 3DS XL. Also great for games such as &#34;Kingdom Hearts Dream Drop Distant&#34; and &#34;Monster Hunter 3 Ultimate&#34; for the 3DS.
B00CHI5B7A|3.0|Predictable - Good guy does bad things for the good of the people.  Uncaring guy, becomes caring - gets girl.  Liked the historical background!
B007NZQU72|4.0|Stay with this author through the jargon and scientific studies until she gets into the real stuff of speaking to your spirit.  I learned new things about the parts of my being that are most important to me.<br /> More--- I want to hear more.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I loved the game because ur chanced by a police and his dog when u trip the police will kechup but still have a chance to get away but if u  run into something it is game over.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this installment to the Crossfire series. If you are a fan of the series I don't have to restate the obvious in terms of the erotic scenes between Gideon and Eva. Those more than hit the mark, as usual. If you are new to the series then just think Fifty Shades, somewhat raunchier and not so much BDSM, although it certainly has elements of that.<br /><br />For this specific installment, I like that readers are finally getting to learn more about Gideon's past trauma. which explains his relationship with his family. From the first installment we pretty much know what Eva's demons are and it was nice to have more insight into Gideon's psyche. I also like the inclusion of the Eva's ex from Book 2. The re-insertion of his character gives some more layers to Eva & Gideon's conflicted relationship. I think Ms. Day does a lot in this installment to give more layers to Eva even, in terms of her female relationships. I absolutely look forward to reading more about Gideon and Eva, and even the secondary characters like Cary, Ireland, Megumi and others.<br /><br />I read some negative reviews from other readers that gave me pause before downloading this to my kindle. However, when I read the meat of the negative reviews, what I saw was that most of the negative reviews weren't based on the actual story, but based on the reviewers expectation that this was to be the final installment of the series. In between the smoking hot and steamy erotic scenes, mentioned previously, I enjoyed the storyline in Book 3 thoroughly and became more invested in several of the secondary characters and their stories as well. There was the romance, intrigue with Nathan and the mystery surrounding Nathan, Gideon & the mob connections.<br /><br />I hope this helps others in making their decision on whether on not to pick this up for Kindle or other versions. I think it's a no brainer, go out and get this book. If you like the others, you will not be disappointed. If you really wanted a Trilogy with a nice conclusion in Book 3, I can say, you will not be getting the ending you want just yet, but don't let that stop you from enjoying another wonderful addition to this amazing series.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My nephews; ages 7, 9, and 12; play this game a lot. They enjoy collecting coins and using the coins to purchase new boards and other items. Definitely keeps them entertained during their Tech Time.
B0083P1QUM|3.0|I've been reading Kay Scarpetta books for 20 years at least.  This is better than her last few but not as good as the early days.<br />That being said, still glad I read it.
B008C20TDG|4.0|Diet is a bad word, instead this is about cleaning out the crap and fueling your body with real food. The plan is strict but to get back on track and really see what the effects of processed food is having on your body it's a great guide. I'm day 7 and feeling good and again finding new ways to cook and eat while not missing the ingredients that are on the no list.  For anyone looking to restart their eating, grab hold and go in 100% and in the end, in the very least, your body will be working better and maybe, just maybe that ding dong or diet coke will look less appealing. Your mind and body will thank you for the whole 30 journey.
B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|Fun and engaging game. Requires you to pay attention and work in sequence. Can't wait for the next edition. Well worth the $2
B00CDT41RY|3.0|It wasn't even the vulgarity of this movie that turned me off, it was the corny ending.  The first half of this movie was AMAZING. The second half of the movie was horrible. The ending was horrific!!!
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|I've been wanting to buy the complete set ok bluray for awhile. I got it on an amazon deal of the day for about $35 and bought it right away. Well worth it, especially for half price.
B00A9X9TIW|3.0|Keep in mind, I was really stoked about this movie when the previews hit the internet.  I just felt like that idea was so awesome and the movie totally disappointed me.  It was ok. Worth watching but didn't leave a lasting impression.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|this game is so fun. I love it. I love how you can unlock all different stages and cars. it is awesome
B009NPKTN6|1.0|Silly me for not watching the preview first.  I didn't realize that this was a musical.  Didn't even make it 5 minutes into the movie before turning it off.  Waste of money.  My own fault though.  Nowhere in the description does it say musical....so be warned, if you don't want a musical, don't pick this one!
B00729GQ0A|5.0|The Forever Girl, by Rebecca Hamilton, was nothing like what I was expecting. I love when an author can paint a picture for me, and I am able to see it clear as day in my mind. I could see each character, and felt like I had known them my whole life.<br /><br />The book revolves around Sophia, who lives in a small town, and doesn't fit in for one problem or another, which will be revealed in your reading. She has this horrible noise (a buzzing and hissing) that has plagued her 24/7 for many years. Yet she has managed to complete college, and get a job at the local diner. She hopes to cure the noise with a Wiccan spell. That's the night things get a little hairy in her life...<br /><br />Find out more about Sophia, her love for her Wiccan religion (kudos Rebecca!), her ancestry, love and pain as you read this wonderful new take in the occult and supernatural reading!

0307730700|5.0|I read over 60 books a year and this one is my all  time favorite. I have read it several times and love it more each time. I have given it as a gift to several friends and they loved it too. Eric Blehm tells his story seamlessly. I promise you won't read a better book, ever.

B00000GAIW|5.0|Jethro Tull's \\"Aqualung.\\" That expression kind of speaks for itself, doesn't it? After all, this is one of  the earliest and therefore most important hard rock/heavy metal releases in  the history of music. A true landmark album, and easily Tull's finest hour, and not to mention their most popular one, at that (it would go on to shift upwards of seven million units, thus making it the highest-selling effort in JT's discography.) All influentiality aside, \\"Aqualung\\" is perhaps most famous for its inclusion of a song, \\"My God,\\" which is eloquently graced by a jazzy flute solo. Indeed, the record nimbly jumps from hard rocking metal songs to pure progressive rock wankery, and does so seemingly at the drop of a hat. So while even though there is plenty of hard-driving stuff to please heavy music fans the world over, there are also plenty of songs that play almost like full-on folk music.<br /><br />The aforementioned \\"My God\\" is a big album highlight in that it builds from a proggy, noodling acoustic guitar/piano intro to chunky, klunking guitars, dropping in some excellent harmonies and light-heartedly soaring melodies (which come in the form of beeping synths, somber piano bits, and wailing flute solos) along the  way. But the album's biggest standouts are its heaviest moments, including the title track, which is propelled forward by a heavy and head-bangable, yet still oddly enough hummable riff, fluid, bubbling bass, and bouncy drum fills. It is also noteworthy for its  inclusion of a nice, piano-aided acoustic breakdown; and a tasty guitar solo peppers the arrangements, as well. \\"Cross-Eyed Mary\\" is another big riff rocker which begins with a moody, melodic fade-in intro before abruptly turning to a catchy, galloping rhythm threaded by steady, heavy bass lines and hooky guitar leads. And it is all iced off by another batch of fiery guitar soloing, some cool-sounding piano splashes, and catchy, sing-songy vocals. Others include \\"Hymn 43,\\" which is equal parts heavy, driving, hard-rocking metal and bluesy melodic balladry. Its muscular riffs and solid, grumbling bass lines are offset by frollicking piano splashes. Thus, the song (or more accurately, \\"hymn\\") ultimately comes across sounding like a cross between Black Sabbath, Deep Purple, Led Zeppelin, and Jerry Lee Lewis!. And one last song of this kind is \\"Wind Up,\\" which is an almost purely doom metal-derived dirge driven by heavy guitar and bass grooves. (The song is also of note, however, from a lyrical standpoint, as its lyrics, which are conceptual dealings with God and religion, are definitely worth reading.)<br /><br />The rest of the songs might not stand out quite as much as the above, but they are all definitely worth hearing nonetheless. \\"Cheap Day Return,\\" \\"Mother Goose\\" (a four-minute long mini epic that is rich with terrific guitar melodies and nasal crooning), the nice and warm-sounding \\"Wand'ring Aloud,\\" and \\"Slipstream\\" are all super trippy and ethereal acoustic-strummed (and, in the case of the latter song, softly-sung) interlude numbers. And proggier even still, \\"Up To Me\\" takes on the undeniable feel of a Southern-tinged  backyard porch jam, with its jangly acoustic guitar and occasional traces of whistling harmonica. But there is also some material that is back on the heavier side of the line. Track numbers ten and twelve, \\"Locomotive Breath,\\" with its wailing harmonica, piano splashes, and guitar hooks, and the funky \\"Lick Your Fingers Clean,\\" with its crunchy, rolling guitar leads beefed up by heavy, swaggering bass grumbles, are two cuts of memorable, light-hearted blues metal. And the last real song to be found on \\"Aqualung\\" is the \\"Quad Version\\" of \\"Wind Up.\\" This is a much bass-ier version of the song, as it is complete with plenty of great, heavy, throbbing bass lines throughout.<br /><br />Even some forty years after its original release, \\"Aqualung\\" is still a record that has a boatload of value, even beyond its enjoyability. It did, after all, laythe groundwork for legions and legions of hard rock/heavy metal followers, with acts like Elf, Wolfmother, Iron Maiden, Down, and Rush (to name only a few) using its formula of hard-rockin' stoner metal riffs mixed with heavily progressive flourishes, as a template.the groundwork for legions and legions of hard rock/heavy metal followers, with acts like Elf, Wolfmother, Iron Maiden, Down, and Rush (to name only a few) using its formula of hard-rockin' stoner metal riffs mixed with heavily progressive flourishes, as a template.

B008UCJ7KO|1.0|Like most other reviewers, I LOVED the first two books and waited (not very patiently) for the third book to be released.  While I'm really annoyed the story doesn't get wrapped up in Book #3, I'm mostly disappointed because I don't feel like this book moved the plot forward in any meaningful way.  I will PROBABLY give the series another chance with Book #4, but it better be soon or I will certainly lose interest.
B0037QGS0A|1.0|For well known actors was truly a boring movie. This was such a disappointment I was sorry I ever purchased. I would never recommend this movie, and was not worth the watch. A true waste of money!

B000FC10HA|3.0|This book has some great ideas and is very easy to read and absorb.  Unfortunately it is so dated that it is hardly relevant any more.  Many of its case studies and examples center around companies - and sometimes industries - that no longer exist.  More useful as a history of marketing text than a forward-looking manual for managers.
B0015DWJX2|5.0|Loved this different way to tell a story by reading letters. The characters were easier to keep straight than I thought.<br />Highly recommend this book.
0316247545|5.0|As mush as I thought there was a few errors in the book. But I think it was just calling ponies by general names. Like Dr. Stables was called just Doctor. Also they called Time Turner Dr. Hooves. And then in the cards, it says his name is Time Turner. So I don't think that's right. But overall I like the rest. Just a few fact errors that's all. But the interviews and art looks cool.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|This book and series is amazing! I Can't wait for the sequel!!!!!!!!!! The end is such a tease! A must read.
B00BF123WG|5.0|I heard a lot about how disturbing the torture scenes are.  Well, they're not that bad.  Of course they are disturbing, but it's nothing close to a Hostel-style gore-fest.  They serve a purpose within the narrative and aren't what I would consider gratuitous.<br /><br />That being said, I think this is one of the best movie of its year.  Blows Argo out of the water for me.  Jessica Chastain is amazing.  I highly recommend it.
B00296A4F4|3.0|Just another average show in another average season of cookie cutter attempts at comedy. There's not much else I can say about it.
B000RUAR5G|4.0|Who can forget Michael Jordan and his ground breaking performance?  Makes Marlon Brando look like crap.  Also Bill Murray is in it.
1781162646|5.0|First of all those giving this book one star because it's not out as an e-book are doing themselves a GREAT disservice. Get down off your high horse and pick up this book. You'll thank me.<br /><br />Now onto the important stuff. This is truly Stephen King at his finest. It's nothing like i've read from him before but at the same time feels like classic King. A heartwarming story about growing up and learning your place in the world. But that's really just the start. Adventure, mystery, thrills and chills are all promised and boy does he deliver! I can't wait to see what else Mr. King has in store for us and will likely read this one over and over again.<br /><br />Seriously go dust off the old library card if you don't want to purchase one of these ancient paper creations.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I absolutely love the Crossfire series. Seeing the love, understanding, and trust grow in their relationship is wonderful. Even with all the outside forces trying to drive a wedge between them and push them apart, they bask in their love for each other. In doing so they also learn that trust is essential.<br />I wish Sylvia Day could write as fast as I read. Anxiously awaiting the next chapter in their story.

0143034901|4.0|\\"The Shadow of the Wind\\" begins in 1945 in Barcelona, still reeling from the effects of the Spanish Civil War.  Ten-year-old Daniel Sempere lives with his father above his book store.  One day, his father takes him to a secret place called \\"The Cemetery of Forgotten Books,\\" a labyrinthine library of old, forgotten books salvaged by a few lovers of books.  Daniel is told he can take one book.  It is there he discovers a book, \\"The Shadow of the Wind\\" by Julian Carax, that will change the course of his life.  After he has read the book, he is fascinated with the story and decides to learn more about the book's author.  Carax is a failed author whose books never sold.  Nevertheless, young Daniel learns that a mysterious stranger who has given himself the name of a Carax character has been systematically destroying copies of the books.<br /><br />The story is an ode to literature.  Zafon weaves a magical story of fate and romance, with many subplots.  Zafon is a gifted wordsmith.  He conjures up some very interesting characters; the most memorable being a homeless man named Fermin who Daniel befriends.  Overall, the book is very satisfying, but ultimately doesn't really deliver as one might have expected.  Despite its strengths, the story seems to be lacking whatever it is that makes a book truly special.  Perhaps the biggest problem I had was with how Zafon chose to reveal the mystery of the Carax books, through an unbelievably long letter that is found.  Once the letter has been read, much of the life goes out of the story.  I suspect that lovers of the classics might truly love this book.  But many American readers will not be satisfied, especially if they are looking for suspense, thrills, and action.  In the end, I think it merits four out of five stars.
B00CTSDDVO|5.0|I've been a long time star trek TNG, Voyager, DS9 and even the enterprise. And Im telling you this movie was impressively done.

This movie is awesome, wait till they start JJ starts rebooting TNG spinoff or the like STAR TREK is BACK!
B000SCHBGQ|5.0|My 14 year old son recommended this series and a friend mentioned the name Nicholas Flamel was referenced in Harry Potter. I gave it a chance and was not disappointed.

B0058DRUV6|4.0|Good to Great by Jim Collins is a fantastic book that covers multiple characteristics of companies that excelled phenomenally in the stock market. The characteristics of \\"great\\" companies that Collins' research team looked for were 15 years of returns at or below the stock market average, followed by a transition and 15 years of returns 3 times higher than the average. The companies that fit these main criteria were studied, and the common characteristics that propelled these companies to greatness were covered in great detail.<br /><br />All of the concepts that were exhibited by \\"great companies\\" mentioned in the book are important, but some of the ones that I found most critical to the success were: Cultivating Level 5 Leadership, Creating a Culture of Discipline, and the Hedgehog Concept. Collins does a great job at providing an in-depth analysis of all of the characteristics that make a company \\"great\\", and goes above and beyond by providing many real-world examples of the concepts that were expressed by these companies and their executives. Collins also does a great job at emphasizing the traits that companies and leaders must have before they can transition into greatness. I found it helpful that when comparing great companies with regular companies, Collins gave numerous examples of the \\"great\\" characteristics that the regular companies didn't adhere to. The only negative thing that I must mention about this book is that there were multiple occasions where the concepts would be repeated, which made the reading seem a little redundant at times.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this book to any aspiring business executive, aspiring leader, or any business professional looking to find ways enhance their leadership ability. I think that this book should be a required read for all business executives, because it has the potential to change ideas of how a business should be run. On a more personal level, I will be the president of a club in the upcoming year. There are many good to great concepts that I have taken from this book that will assist me in becoming a better leader, and I believe they will assist my club and its officers in achieving greatness.

But, her descriptions and discussion about how she dealt with each challenge was very helpful. Even if you don't follow her advice or mirror her decisions, I think it is helpful to hear that others face these challenges... and SUCCEED!
B00BG08FKK|4.0|I recieved my order very fast, which made me very happy. It did surprise me though that I had paid an extra $4 for gift wrapping and it was not as nice as I thought it would be, so it was not worth my money. Also I was surprised to see that it was not it an actual cd case, but in a paperback(i guess you would call it). Which bummed me out because if the cds were so expensive I would expect them in a hard case like other cds come in.<br />My mother however loved her mothers day gift anyway.

B004P1JDJO|4.0|I thought it was really helpful to read this after reading a few books: Lean In by Sheryl Sandberg, Delivering Happiness by Tony Hseih and Start with Why by Simon Sinek. They all touch on culture in some way and seem to center around what causes success for any given person or company -- it all boils down to understanding why you do what you do. If you can make it something that gives your life or efforts meaning and you can connect that to the services you offer, you will experience success. Sounds hokey -- but, I believe it. Every word of it.

His growth and development from Harvard slacker to empathetic boss and investor was nothing short of remarkable. I am very impressed by what he has built at Zappos (with his team) and I am inspired by it!

0812993845|2.0|I am beginning not to be able to tell the difference between any of Sophie Kinsella's books.  The Shopaholic series, I've got your number, Twenties Girl, I've got your number... they are all written exactly the same with the main character being an obtuse, oblivious, naive girl.  I'm getting a little sick of the same story.  I don't remember if the Madeline Wickham books are also written the same way, as it's been years since I've read one of those.  Sophie Kinsella may be an author I need to put on the shelf.
B00CRS88IO|5.0|The first great thrill of this book is the concept -- following the real Ian Flemming on a James Bond style adventure, wondering if it's true, how much is based on fact, but ultimately not caring because it's just fun.  What makes it a great read is the details involved -- from the politics of the war, to the technology and machinery involved in spy craft, down to the clothes and styles everyone is wearing.  It is an adventurous trip back in time, with a great lead character in Flemming -- every much the charming, resourceful, daring spy that James Bond is.  The writer really did a great job.
B00338QENI|5.0|For a book about science, this was a great read because it's really a story about a woman and her family.  It is eye opening to learn what has happened in the field off medicine as a result of one women's incredible cells.  It is also a moral play on who owns cells taken from the body and whether or not a donor should be compensated for medicines that are the result of research using a donors cells, blood, tissue, etc.  I think this book should be read by every high school chemistry or biology class.  It's important to realize the vast possibilities which can be accomplished using the cells of only one person.  Read it!  You'll be glad you did!

B008UCJ7KO|2.0|I got this book the day it was released on my Kindle app.  I found it very slow moving and there was way too much filler of Eva talking about how good looking Gideon was.  I was about 2/3 through the book when I realized everything wasn't going to be tied up in a pretty bow at the end.  I came on Amazon to see all the bad reviews and my fears were true... this isn't the last book.  This was supposed to be a trilogy, but somewhere along the line it got changed.  Probably because it was making the author good money... so why not stretch it out.<br /><br />The ending is so ridiculous.  It just ends.  I feel like the book was meant to be it then they realized they could stretch it out.  So they took out the part of the book where it ties up any loose ends.  Then they added about 100 pages of filler of Eva talking about how hot Gideon was, another 50 pages of her talking about how much she loves him and he killed for her And a ridiculous story line about Megumi (honestly, who cares??  she's in the first 2 books so little).... oh and a bunch of filler with the reporter (although this isn't as bad as all the other filler).<br /><br />I feel like the first half of the book had no plot.  There was no much going on, except of course, sex with Eva and Gideon.  Nothing really starts happening until after the half way point and nothing good starts happening until the last 1/4 of the book.  I finished the first two books super fast and couldn't put them down.  This book took almost 4 days (which is a record since I read the first one in a day).  I had to force myself to get through it so I could move on... plus, I paid $9.99 for it!!  What a waste!<br /><br />Now the plot... or lack there of.  I thought it was supposed to be Gideon's story and how him and Eva move on after what he did in book #2.  Half way through, I found myself wondering when they would address everything.  It was just a lot of sex and alone time with Gideon and Eva with no explanation of things.  Eva has lunch a few times with someone she works with whose wife gave up carbs (see, I can't even remember his name!).  Brett comes back into town to debut his video for 'Golden' (which is the song above Eva) and she meets up with him and even invites him up to her apartment!  Ugh!!<br /><br />Disappointment doesn't even begin to cover how I feel about this book.  Will I pay another $9.99 for the next book?  No way!  There isn't enough story to write another book, let alone 2 more.  And there's no way I'm paying money to read more 'filler' about how good looking Gideon is.

B00CB4ET0K|3.0|Like most glu games it is a lot of fun with good graphics and gameplay. But also like most glu games you have to pay pay pay to get any good weapons or upgrades. I always find this irritating.
B00AQF8CJ0|4.0|I've only played through the first few levels but it's been fun so far. Good successor to cut the rope.
B00BEXB18M|2.0|First Off, I Wanna Thank Dave Mustaine For Keeping Megadeth Alive! (As Well As The Rest Of The Members). I Have Been A True Genuine Megadeth Fan Since The Early 90's (Mostly Since \\"Rust In Peace\\"). I Own Megadeth's Entire Discography. I Have Seen Them Live Six Or Seven Times And Every Show That Iv'e Seen Was Awesome! They Have Always Put On A Great Show! Despite All The Linup Changes For Whatever Reasons, Different Record Companies, And So On. I Have Always Been A Loyal Fan. Thanks For Everything Guys!<br /><br />Back To The Review Of \\"Super Collider\\"... I Was So Stoked When I Heard Megadeth Was Going To Drop Another Album! I Couldn't Wait To Hear More Material Dave And The Crew Had Created! Especially After Hearing What \\"United Abominations\\" & \\"Endgame\\" Had To Offer! Usually, I'm Always Checking Youtube Or Other Sites To Hear Samples Of Their New Material But, This Time I Just Wanted To Wait Till It Hit The Stores.<br /><br />After Buying This Album & Listening To It From Beginning To End Several Times Over & Over, I Still Don't Know What To Think Of It. I Don't Want To Say It Sucks But, I'm Going To Say It Is Definitely Different From What I Expected It To Sound Like! I Was Really Hoping For More Political, Biblical, War-Type Songs! This Is Totally Different From \\"United Abominations\\" & \\"Endgame\\". This Album... Possibly Being Another Experimental Album Like Risk Was Or Maybe Newer Songs That Have Been On The Back Burner? I'm Not Sure. But, This Album Is More Hard Rock & Mainstream Than Being Heavy Metal. I Realize That Megadeth Is No Longer With Roadrunner Records Which May Be The Reason For The Change Of Lyrical Content And Material.<br /><br />Even Though \\"SUPER COLLIDER\\" Is Not A Speed/Metal/Thrash Type Album That Megadeth Is Well Known For Producing Over The Years. However, I Do Recommend This Album For Any True Megadeth Fan! Also For The Mainstream Or Hard Rock Music Fans. May Even Be An Excellent Album For The Younger Generation Out There As Well!<br /><br />My Favorite Songs From The Album So Far Are...\\"Kingmaker\\", .\\"Dance In The Rain\\", \\"Cold Sweat\\" & \\"A House Divided\\". More Songs May Grow On Me Later On But, Those Are The Ones That Really Stand Out For Me As Of Now!<br /><br />I Really Like The First Half Of \\"Dance In The Rain\\" But, Don't Really Care For It After David Draiman Of Disturbed Comes In. I Think The Song Really Had The Potential Of Being A Great Classic, But Ended Up Going In A Weird Direction. (Just My Opinion Of Coarse!)<br /><br />Overall, The Album Is Different But, Decent & Tolerable To Listen To!(Not My Favorite Album Of Megadeth's & Not The Worst Album Either.) Excellent Sounding Production. I Think Some Songs Could Be Mixed Down A Little Better Tho. Awesome Guitar Solos, Riffs, Drums, For The Most Part Dave's Vocals Are Pretty Good Too!<br /><br />If Megadeth Continue To Keep Going, I Hope Their Next Album Will Be More Like \\"United Abominations\\" & \\"Endgame\\"<br /><br />I'd Rather Listen To This Album Over Alot Of Garbage That Is Coming Out These Days... Hands Down!
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is awesome. I'm just upset that 7.0 is out for Apple products, and not for kindle. But this game is great the way it is, and would be better with the update.
B00BEXB18M|5.0|Makes him look like he's really ticked off, that one of him in between those train cars, I wonder if he was not feelin' good on that day, no offense Dave just makin' an observation. LOL - Looks like he just got woke up and he wasn't in a good mood.
B00BTYP6QE|4.0|This is a Good game for my 4yr old - he loves it!!!!!!!!!!! Lots of fun in my down time too
B009VIZDLI|4.0|This book was such fun to read. By the end I felt so familiar with the central characters that I was sad to finish it. I think it is one of those rare books that anyone of any age would enjoy. It reminded me of another very funny book - \\"My Uncle Oswald\\" by Roald Dahl
B006VFLIYK|5.0|This was this first book I've read with the Will Robie character and I really enjoyed it. I don't know how Baldacci keeps coming up with such great ideas for characters, but Will is very likable (despite his choice of carrier) and I look forward to reading about him in his next book!
0765325950|5.0|This is a great group of books. Rich in details of the struggle to understand six youths fight against Darkness.Amust read for book readers.
B003VS0CX8|5.0|The Sound of Music remains the best musical of all the musicals I have ever seen. Nothing beats it. Not even after so many years have passed.
B0085YOD1A|5.0|I hated playing the geussing game when it came to how more time is left on my kindle my dad told me over charging something is bad so tend not to charge it over night so this app is very useful
B000068FXR|5.0|Yes brought back many memories... LOVED IT!!!!  Was just what I wanted to add to my CD collection... Buy IT
B004WGGQPQ|1.0|Drawing Pad looks like a great app; and I'm sure it is but I cant get it to download. So I'm not sure if I paid money for nothing.
B000N3ST3Y|5.0|Listened to this for a week solid....put it into my car and just let it play each time I was driving..loved it
B0091REZMW|4.0|Not bad. I wish the screen was a little bigger to see the objects. It's a little had to see on a Kindle Fire.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|When an author writes a series and ends it people tend to want more. Sylvia Day is doing just that. She announced weeks ago that the story would not be ending with EWY and that we would see more of Gideon and Eva, which by the way I am stoked about. I read an author recently and when the book was finished her fans went to social media and begged her for more. What did that author do? She decided to continue their story for her fans. I hate to see the way Sylvia is being attacked over the extension of this series. I'm excited to get more of this story and can't wait to read books 4 & 5. Now, Onto my review of Entwined With You.<br /><br />The beginning of this book picks up right where Reflected in You left off, so you get no missing pieces. Eva was a lot more opinionated in this book. Gideon, Well he was down right sexier and I love that he finally started to open up to her. We got to see them in an almost normal relationship and I fell in Love with Gideon even more. I just have this awful feeling that the next book is going to tear my heart out. To me it seems like Sylvia wrote this book with a lot of holes on purpose. The end was nice but she's heading to California and that I don't think is going to go so nice. I don't think Gideon is free and clear of Nathan's death even though I hope I'm wrong. This is what I took away from reading this. She wrote this book building you up for the rest of the series and it was wonderfully written. This is my opinion and clearly that's what a review is. Will I read the rest of the series? Heck Yea I will. I'm dying to see where we go from here. Will Brett come between Eva and Gideon? Is the red head from the benefit going to be a huge part of the next book? Have we seen the last of Corinne? God I hope so. These are the questions I asked myself when I finished this book late in the evening on release day. I am throughly pleased with this book. It's not my favorite of the series, but who can say that they loved all the books in a series equally? Well done Sylvia Day, I'll continue reading this series.series equally? Well done Sylvia Day, I'll continue reading this series.
B005HI4LLY|5.0|Funniest horror movie.  Liked it better than Shaun of the Dead.  Not really a spoof movie but it does play on a couple cliche's.  I never heard about this movie till it was on Blu.  Would have loved to see it in the theaters.  If you like to laugh....get the movie.
B00A757EFW|4.0|this should be a 5 star, but it is two small on the kindle hd to play well. I would not buy it.
B003B1X80Y|4.0|Very good movie that sucks you in right away.  I can apreciate a good romantic movie, Titanic being one of my favorite overall movies, and I enjoyed this movie also.
B00C5ZS5SC|5.0|Had no Idea who she was, then I heard Dance on my own and I was hooked. Very talented singer!
B00CWM3F4C|3.0|I really loved Black Gives Way to Blue so I had high hopes for this album. I've listened to it a few times now hoping it would grow on me, but the songs are extremely forgettable. I almost gave it 1 star, but I made it 3 because I want to support the band. I hope their next effort is better. Bring back the hooks!<br /><br />Also, the album title is stupid. I'm not religious so it's not I'm not offended. I just think it's a silly topic taking a jab at the religious minority. Boring and lame.
B001K3EXTA|4.0|Saw this years ago and watched again after seeing the new version. Things from both movies I liked. Of course Refford is always great
B00002N9ER|5.0|Used them to mount my 3 D cell to the seat frame of my jeep. I did not use the provided screws. Instead I used bolts to secure it to existing factory holes in the seat frame. I only used one bolt per bracket and some heavy duty double sided tape to avoid having to drill additional holes.  The brackets hold the flash light tightly; it takes some effort to remove it, it's very secure.
034580404X|1.0|WOW, These books were soooooooo boring.  I want to cry because of the time that I took form my life to read them.  Time that I will never get back!  I purchased these books because I wanted to see what the hype was all about and I didn't want to wait to get them at the library (truly a bad decision).  I kept waiting for the books to get better, it NEVER happened.  I didn't bother to read even look at Freed.  I struggled to get through part 1 and 2. I would never tell anyone to read these books unless they needed to be punished.  REALLY A BAD DECISION TO BUY AND READ. IT was unrealistic.
1580176941|3.0|I have a lot of cookbook for cookies. I love to make roll out cookies and decorate them and so was excited when I saw this cookbook.  I was disappointed when I got it.  Wasn't really what I thought it should be.  I have some that are much better in explaining techniques and have better pictures.  Pretty much this book is sitting on my shelf gathering dust.
B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|game has a good deal of playability without having to spend extra money. later play does get tougher. still definitely worth the space on my kindle.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|THIS IS A GOOD ACTION MOVi E FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO LOVE THE ACTION I ORDERED IT FOR MY BOY FRIEND AND HE LOVED IT AND SO DID I!!!!!!!!!!!!
B0094K1MH2|4.0|The Kids love the movie. They can watch the movie over and over. It is a Great family movie everyone can enjoy.
B009H5IS1W|5.0|I absolutely love this television series, but I never have time to sit down and watch it when it is on.  Tivo is an option, but the disc gets full with hubby's sports and then I'd miss a series.  With Amazon Prime, I can purchase the series watching them one at a time or in a marathon - at my own schedule.  Great price! No mailing of discs! Not available on similar competitors online services.  Can't beat it!
0307352153|5.0|Just ordered this book after being asked by my extroverted wife to attend another social event (Sigh). Good thing my wife understands me and I do these things as a compromise. Hey, that's what marriage is all about so she knows I have my limits when it comes to social events. My entire life, I've been called \\"quiet,\\" \\"shy,\\" and even \\"anti-social,\\" when in actuality I am none of the above. But, I agree that I am an introvert who does not like to talk just for the sake of talking. And yes, I'd rather write a letter than sit on the phone for hours running my mouth. I often wondered how some people can run their mouths non-stop, meanwhile I can sit quietly doing something which interest me and me alone.<br /><br />I look forward to reading this book.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love how we get to unlock caricatures and board's and like it never gets boring and the outfits are realy cool and I love that they change the city's!!!!!!!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Not normally my kind of program but this was great. Have to pay attention to catch all of the little remarks. Bring on season 4
193700788X|2.0|I started reading the Sooki Stackhouse books after the True Blood series started.  From book 1 I was hooked.  I went through the first 10 books in record speed because I fell in love with the characters and Sookie's interaction with the Vamps.  The last few books were a disappointment and I was losing interest but my love for Sookie/Eric/Pam was a driving force to at least reading the final book.<br /><br />Blah is the only word I can think of.  Not much Eric, Pam or the exciting vampires.  Where are the dead in Dead Ever After?  Did Charlaine Harris forget who and what  made this series great?  I had already resigned myself to having Sookie end up with Sam....the writing was on the wall once her relationship with Eric took a nose dive.  What disappointed me even more was that we didn't even get a decent send off for them.... No real confrontation about loving each other, Something, Anything......that would have at least put closure to what for me and I see by the comments, for many others, became the core of passion for the Dead Series.<br /><br />I feel sad that I won't be reading about Sookie anymore and disappointed that there WASN'T a....Wow, what a great end to a great series feeling.
B00BGIBVP8|5.0|I liked the movie.  when I watch a movie silly comedy is my favorite so this fit the bill.<br />I wouldn't recommend you watch with young children, or if your not into funny naughty movies..
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|This is an interesting game.  I love all the mini puzzles on top of the hidden object portion of the game.
B00CKJ2KK2|3.0|if u want to bi something. on it it will not purchase I spent 15$ and just wasted my money
B006M4F67A|5.0|I play mahjongg a lot.  I love that this one gives you several different types of stacks.  It makes playing a little different every time.
B00C7JFIRC|1.0|Basically if you want to own both the copies you end up spending north of $50 when usually they would cost anything between $25-$32 in a combo pack. Shame on Disney for doing this.
B003R4ZMNQ|3.0|LIKE most people, I am rather fond of the original<br />So I am concerned when they 'reboot' a series<br /><br />Question 1: they found the original session musicians to play the theme song - so it could be like the original.<br />If the new is going to be like the original, then why bother re-recording it?<br /><br />Question 2: so Lt Commander Steve McG is the original Steve (Jack Lord) McG's son<br />Then how come the Chin Ho Kelly isn't older?<br /><br />Until the 3rd (of 6) DVDs, the show was Ok<br />Then they started this 'Lt Commander McG's mother was blown up (or not)' nonsense<br /><br />As the stand alone new show, this would have gotten a 4<br />But as a reboot, nah.<br /><br />And to make things worse, Seasons II and III don't get better.
B00821OX98|5.0|I have enjoyed watching this series. The special effects are good and so is the story line. The actors keep you interested in watching it because they do their parts well. When you keep watching episodes back to back it must mean that you are being entertained. I look forward to seeing season 3 this Sunday.
B009UNGYHG|5.0|It's a amazing item don't wait get it today...........I love mine and use it all the time get it now
B009NY43NY|5.0|tied up lingering questions, didn't see her ending up with the vampire, nice goodbye to ex flames.  can't wait for the post sookie novel!
B007PTJOV0|5.0|this game is almost like Mario and super pepe world. you should get this awesome app.I know you will love it and you will see how close it is to Mario.
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|My 8 year old loves it she loves showing me how to play it. I'm not good at it but I think it's a good game for kids.
B009NY43NY|5.0|It's always sad to say goodbye to a friend and although its not the ending I expected, I thoroughly enjoyed it.<br />For my own selfish reasons I would have liked to see more of Eric.<br />Thank you Charlaine for taking us on a fabulous journey with wonderful characters  I will definitely miss Bon Temps.
B0063IH60K|4.0|THIS IS AN EASY FOR OF SOLITAIRE. HAVE NOT USED IT ENOUGH TO TELL IF I REALLY LIKE IT. WISH THERE WERE MORE CHOICES BUT MAYBE AFTER USING IT A WHILE I'LL LEARN.
B0031P6X2K|5.0|Great, all songs in this album and SRV its a geatest guitar player, and he has a loveble style. Frist Hear later talk
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Great graphics! So fun and lots of pretty horses. There are also lots of activities and training you can do.
1600240917|5.0|I really love the King/Maxwell series but do wish these all came in the unabridged versions.  My car is older so the MP3 format doesn't work...but there is enough to make this a good listen.  Fills in how they first got together.
B00CFQMVLS|5.0|i love this watching on line its easy and convinient i woul recomend this to all my friends and family
B009FZHYKU|5.0|For as potentially hokey as the plot could have become, it remains true to human nature in trying times. Some get stronger and some get stranger.  Good writing well executed by the actors. Very much worth the price of admission.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Martin does a masterful job of hooking the reader from page one. You really begin to feel a part of the characters he has created. The 'game' is intriguing and ever changing. Reading this series and watching the HBO series in tandem gives even more life to these characters and their stories. Highly recommend reading the books and not just watching the adaptation.
B0088O11NU|1.0|My anti virus program on my tablet said that it found a threat in this program when I downloaded it.
B003M6EAXM|5.0|This was the last season of 24 - until Fox decided to revive it with a 12 episode run starting May 2014. This season continued the legacy of excellent writing and acting, and had excellent production values as well. I'm thrilled to see 24's return.
B00CP2Z5TC|5.0|Along with the Alt-J album, here is my other summer album for 2013.  Incredible album from start to finish.  Trust me.  Just buy it and listen.  You won't regret it.
B00C5W3SBE|1.0|Disney already made money on the movie from the initial worldwide release. PPV and rentals are phase two of the profits and now  finally the sales. In short everything is pure profit but I guess still not enough for Disney? They must need someone to pay for the losses on John Carter.<br /><br />It is hard to believe there are four separate packaged versions of this movie for sale:<br />Blu-ray + Digital Copy<br />Blu-ray 3D + Digital Copy<br />Blu-ray / DVD + Digital Copy<br />DVD + Digital Copy<br /><br />I have not seen it in the theater and was looking forward to purchasing this movie. Not now, not with these ridiculous pricing policies where one has to effectively pay twice to get the 3D and 2D version. Their marketing dept. must be full of idiots if they think this is a good idea and that it is a good thing to piss off their customers.<br /><br />Tell Disney what you think by not buying the movie.
0425263924|4.0|I'm having a hard time reading all these negative reviews.  Yes, there could have been a bit more substance to Eva and Gideon's story, but I was kept well entertained, Sylvia Day wrote beautifully as usual, and I am very excited to read the next one.  For those of you who are so angry about her writing 5 books, I think Sylvia Day chose to write 5 books in the series bc there is such a high demand for them. Mist of my friends and I are excited for the next two.  We're just hoping that we don't have to wait too long!!!
B0089LOG02|5.0|Fascinating part of our history that I did not know and the contrast between the times was intriguing and a eye opening to the problems of today's children.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Love the characters..they are realistic. The acting is suburb, you can tell when money is spent on talent wisely. Recommended!
B000CNFC76|5.0|I hate golf - really hate it but this movie was excellent that I could see and feel the emotions of the players...  Have watched at least 4 times and still enjoy.....
B0053O89RY|4.0|I just love Modern Family.  The first season is my favorite...but this one is still funny.  What a cast of characters...now tell me that you don't know someone who these characters remind you of.  I love the story and characters.  Very realistic chaos. I highly recommend this series and buying it through amazon.  Purchases always come quickly and in great shape.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|Loved the movie but also cried at the end....  WOW..  And then leaning this was a true story in Japan of a beloved dog made it more fun...  Again, get plenty of napkins for the tears......
0062101897|5.0|Great book! Great weight and detail.  Bought this as a gift for a Harry Potter enthusiast...best gift ever! No collection of Harry Potter is complete without owning this wonderful book!  Even if you are not a Harry Potter fan...it is so rich in color...it would make a great coffee table book...or add a splash of color to a bookshelf.  I would highly recommend this book.
B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|I really enjoyed the first game, despite its tendency to occasionally reboot on the Kindle Fire, wiping out all progress.<br /><br />The sequel does not have that reboot issue, is not a straight rehash of the original, and it has several features to keep it interesting once a player has defeated all 50 waves of zombies.<br /><br />When playing the waves one uses one of three different hero characters rather than just the samurai from the first game. Each has particular strengths and weaknesses.<br /><br />The allies available are expanded from the first game, and a player can acquire (by using gold coins or finding the right \\"mystery box\\" in the game) stronger \\"champion\\" versions of each ally.<br /><br />There is also a multiplayer mode that allows for head to head confrontation against other players. Other players are attacked to acquire upgrades, and upgrades that have been acquired may need to be defended - be prepared for that.<br /><br />Finally, there is the daily challenge. There are a limited number of these, not a brand new one every day.<br /><br />The only major issue I have here is the cost to buy the Sorceress hero - $54.99.<br />I enjoyed this game enough to buy $20 worth of gold coins to use in the game, but the price for the sorceress is not something that I am willing to pay. That said, the sorceress character is not required, and I have had a lot of fun anyway.
B000H6SXMY|5.0|What a great gift at a great price!  I purchased this for my daughter.  I loved it when it was on the air and now the next generation can watch it now and enjoy a great series.  Every episode is as funny as the next.  It never gets old. By the time you get finished with the 10th season and start all over again...you always find it just as funny as watching it the first time.  I highly recommend this series. Amazon packaged and shipped this very quickly without paying the extra shipping most other places require.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|Got this for my 6 yr old granddaughter . She can do a lot of it on her own but occasionally she comes to me for a little help. :)  She loves when we are wifi availble so she can play. And a little disappointed when wifi is not... like in the car.
B0087ITBT8|3.0|The beginning and most of the middle is about an overbearing Jewish<br />mother played by Barbara Streisand.  Who else could play that role better?<br />But it gets hectic having her smother the son and he's a loser insofar as<br />selling his cleaning product.  But in the end, the film has a nice humanistic<br />ending.  I recommend renting this piece first.  I bought it because I thought<br />it was going to be funny. Not too funny.  The Three Stooges was FUNNY.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|As stated previous in the title. I find this game not only like the movie.  No matter the person's age its guaranteed to be worth the wait for the coveted pearls.
B00AS1Q8FW|5.0|Tom Cruise does a great job acting in whatever roles he has played.  In<br />Jack Reacher, he portrays a touch, ex-military copper, called upon to<br />solve an investigation involving a suspect that he had caught previously --<br />a sniper who went crazy and killed several contractors in the middle east;<br />but was swept under the rug because they had been involved in a massive<br />gang rape.  This time, though the sniper was being framed and it is Cruise's<br />job to find the truth, but he has to battle all these tough criminals who are in<br />his way.  His martial arts skills are very good; he talks the talk and walks the walk.<br />Go get it; it's worth several viewings.
B003K1EYM6|5.0|Excelent
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I honestly loved this book, and I have to say I'm more disappointed in the readers who are upset about the continuation of the series. Yes I know you spent good money for an ending, and I know a cliffhanger is a horrible way to end the story. I also know that despite this books short fallings more than half of you were smiling, laughing, and happy for Eva and Gideon trough the journey of Entwined with You. Would you be this disappointed if you did not love the book and the characters? I think Sylvia Day loves these characters as much as we all do, and I think that drove her decision to extend the series. I think the disappointment would have been just as much if you readers felt like the end was rushed and things were not wrapped up. I have read a lot of romance novels and by far Sylvia Day is one of the most talented writers in this genre, despite the disappointment people feel, this woman can write a book. I could not put it down and I enjoyed to ride. The reason we read is to relax, and be taken away from our own personal lives for a short time. Did this book not give you that? Its just a book, and a damn good one as far as I'm concerned. I think everyone needs to take a step back and think about why they are really reading. This book for me was a break from summer classes, a nice way to spend my lunch break at work,and a relaxing and exciting way to end the night before bed. It is a well written book and I was happy to be able to read and enjoy it for what it was.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I normally don't like a whole bunch of romantic drama, gossip intrigue plot lines, etc. However, I am obsessed with Downtown Abbey, much like the rest of the world it seems. I love the historical setting and the characters are very interesting. My husband and I started our own Downton Abbey Season 3 viewing club. We're three episodes in and sometimes we fight sleep just to sneak in another episode.... a habit since season 1.
B009NY43NY|5.0|This new Sookie book lives up to the series. Keep me coming!  Once you read one you have to read them all.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway Surfers is a very fun,active game. Most games that I play I get bored after a while of the same thing all the time,but on Subway Surfers,it changes like from China to Miami to just a plain sunny day. You never get bored. There's<br /> always something new about!!!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love this game it helps out your reflexes and makes you become faster, whoever made up this game you are very very very brilliant and intelligent this game is very addictive.
B00992CF6W|3.0|The only thing I play on my kindle is minecraft because of the bigger screen, other  wise you can get anything better on an Apple iPod. You can ask anyone. Well anyone who owns an iPod and a kindle, can tell you that updates come faster
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book is a must read. You'll be pulled into this book  with the drama it's a great  way to end the series.
B003XU02QG|2.0|couldn't hold my attention, overuse of graphic violence killed the storyline which might have been good given the era of the story
B00BQPEIT2|4.0|Love the game but should really be able to upgrade the save Me and maybe have more characters or combine the 2 games.
B005H9B44A|5.0|great job with the story line, effects and cast .. actors were very good and the special effects out of this world, literally
B0035JRVBO|5.0|Great example: Showing all people are different and worthy of their heart desires. I loved this movie because Forrest was not discouraged by other, no matter how people treated him.
B0029EDMEG|5.0|Watched them all on tv, last year, but it's one of the ones you want to watch again. Viewed this one on Amazon Prime Instant Videos and have not been disappointed in their movie selection.  Love these laid back movies. Tom Selleck is a name associated with quality. You rely on his name to give you a good couple of hours of entertainment.
B00C1BU7V8|4.0|Just something for you to keep in mind so that you don't let history repeat itself. Thanks to President Lincoln, although it was long, long before my time.

B0076DCT2G|5.0|Great book, hard to put down. Thrilling.  This is one of my favorite characters. can't wait for the next one.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|This is the best weather app I have tried. Really accurate with temps and weather warnings. The only reason it's not 5 stars is the chance of precipitaton is not that accurate. But it's still closer than all others.
B00CS65JS2|5.0|Being a longtime fan of Daft Punk, I've been stoked to hear their newest album, debating on whether or not to pre-order it solely dependent on the SNL ad. Then I listened to &#34;Get Lucky&#34; the radio edit version and the debate on whether or not I should shell out my money continued! It all in the end was dependent on the fact i couldn't solely pre-order the mp3s in, so I nearly shot my foot, waiting until the 25th to buy the thing and boy-- I had felt like I should've shot my foot for doing so.<br /><br />BECAUSE it was so different, you thought they'd add more electronica to it and less artsy fartsy stuff to it; the first time around to listening to it, I felt like I wanted my money back.<br /><br />The second time around I thought, &#34;meh, it isn't too bad&#34;, continued to listen to it because I spent 12 dollars on the thing.<br /><br />And after a while, I fell in love with 'Beyond' 'Within' because it reminded soo much of their more mellow tunes like 'Something about us' and that is when I truly realized this is indeed the Daft Punk I absolutely loved and adored.<br /><br />Seriously guys, don't rate this until you've given it a week or two.<br /><br />And to anyone tentative to buy it, I highly suggest listening to it via streaming websites such as spotify or looking through youtube to see if someone's posted it for you.<br /><br />But anyway, that's my 2 cents; I liked it, I wanna see them perform these songs live and yeah. Good album.
B0001XAPY2|5.0|This movie is a great example of a fantastic kids' film that is clever and funny enough to appeal to an adult audience as well. And, I think the folks at Disney did a really good job with the English dubbing - the voice actors all bring great qualities to their roles and it is not distracting.
B00005JNJV|5.0|The movie worked wonderful. Batman is a great movie. It fit perfect into our collection. It was a good movie.
B00D1HC8VS|5.0|When Paul McCartney and The Beatles dissolved their partnerships, McCartney was bound and determined to go his own way. He made a few solo albums, like the masterpiece \\"Ram,\\" but then decided he wanted a full fledged rock band behind him. Hence were Wings born. The corresponding Wings albums, like \\"At The Speed Of Sound\\" and \\"Venus and Mars\\" had McCartney insisting, over and over, that Wings was a band. To the point where Linda McCartney and Denny Laine were singing. The Beatles were dead and gone. Wings were here and now.<br /><br />Until 1976 and the tour where McCartney shocked everyone. \\"Wings Over America,\\" the then triple album, featured Wings and Paul digging into The Beatles' catalog, which also meant that he was performing some of these songs for the first time in their existence, to a live audience. (As a reminder, The Beatles turned their back on touring in 1966.) The crowds, understandably, went nuts. With that kind of energy, Paul leans into \\"Lady Madonna,\\" \\"Blackbird,\\" \\"Yesterday\\" and a few others with an obvious glee; he may have been trying to erase his past before, but there's no way to deny he was reinvigorated to be on the road without dragging around the invisible elephant in the room.<br /><br />It also shows off Wings as a more capable band than most critics gave them credit for. The opening \\"Venus and Mars/Rock Show\\" opens the concert with some serious electricity, and \\"Live and Let Die\\" rivals \\"Helter Skelter\\" for McCartney's all time rockingest tune. As an added feature, the song \\"Soily,\\" which was a regular on McCartney tours, has never been released except for \\"Wings Over America.\\" It's among the McCartney and Wings songs that take up the bulk of the album, with highlights being \\"Hi Hi Hi,\\" \\"Band On The Run,\\" and the single from the album, \\"Maybe I'm Amazed.\\"<br /><br />Now condensed to a double CD, the remastered sound is terrific. (I had the older CD, and a one on one comparison reveals a crisper sound, less muffled.) If you want to spend a couple extra bucks, the triple version contains an eight song bonus disc from San Fransisco's Cow Palace and adds \\"Let Me Roll It\\" and a differently arranged \\"Bluebird\\" as the main attractions. (Although the fade on \\"Picasso's Last Words\\" is annoying.) All together, this is one of the more important documents of Paul McCartney's recorded legacy, the moment in time where he let his past catch up with him and he doesn't turn it away.d a couple extra bucks, the triple version contains an eight song bonus disc from San Fransisco's Cow Palace and adds \\"Let Me Roll It\\" and a differently arranged \\"Bluebird\\" as the main attractions.

B0065GC0BA|4.0|This was a very touching, easy read with good characters.  It is not a superbly memorable book, however it captures the emotions of the characters well and is quite a page turner.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|Well, I bought a few games and this was one of them, I leaned over to watch my son play it, it is interesting tho.
B00000K3G8|5.0|Another iconic CD from years past-lost my original, and of course, can't find in music stores (the ones that still exist). I'm enjoying this one more than the original.
B008OOYALE|5.0|It keeps my son busy for an hour +, than he'll switch to another game. I downloaded about 8 different ones.
B0094M2S5A|5.0|Absolutely great writing.  You just dont see writing like this in movies anymore.  All the actors are great in their roles
B005HSL626|4.0|My son loves the Ninja&#34;s.  He plays this game constantly for hours, now that schools out i don't mind but....
B00992CF6W|4.0|I like it. All it's missing is a bucket so I can collect and move water to a location. Oh and the cookie. Because I love cookies. :p
B00A8ECU24|4.0|I loved this game. It's fun but... when they added Canterlot to it, it's all confusing. I have not enough bits for TWO towns! D: And the &quot;friend&quot; list thing doesn't't work. And why is Sweetie Belle so high!? I hope this is better... soon...
B007P6VM4A|5.0|Rock AND Roll like it should be. Great sound, and great recording. Have listened thru 3 times and already know this will fit in perfect with the rest of their discography. They take chances and pull it off. Long live the Hives.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|There is a newer version - I got as a beta - that is WAY neater. Lost it when I upgraded my tablet.
B000NIVJGI|5.0|This movie is wonderful!!  The music and the dancing is superb!  Love to watch Patrick Swayze dance!!!!  So sorry that they never made a sequel to this movie before he passed away.
B005F9TQ4C|5.0|I love this album, it replaced the original album I wore out listening to it so many times.  Bob Dylan has changed my way of thinking, living and understanding...My 8year old grandaughers favorite album is Infidels, she know every word to &#34;I and I&#34;, pretty amazing, just keep passing the code on and maybe one day all will be right.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|Went to see this movie in the theaters when it came out last Christmas and it was FANTASTIC!!!  The entire movie is sung!  The actors and actress' in the movie have the most wonderful voices!  Well done to the casting director!!!  Highly recommended to anyone who loves musicals!
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|This game is very fun and challenging but not too terribly difficult. Very addicting. I can't seem to put it down so far. It works great on my Kindle HD too. It hasn't crashed yet!
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|I was such a fan of the Crossfire series when the first two books were out that I couldnt wait for the third. The love story between Eva and Gideon bloomed beautiful and was a joy to read. However, The beginning started off great but then continued out and seemed to completely drag. I found myself skipping pages because it was endless words that seemed to collide together for the sake of dragging out sentences. When I completed reading about 80% of the book then things started to pick up and then when you finish it, it just drops! Nothing was left finished it seems like there was no real direction towards explaining anything of real importance that linked to the 2nd book.I refuse to give more information about this book because I dont believe in spoiling things for other readers, but if I were to give any advice either wait til it comes down in price or get it at Target for 20% off because honestly I feel like I've been ripped off, and unfortunately I will wait for yet another book of the crossfire series because I would like to know what happens in the end but entwined with you? Very long, drawn out, no conclusions whatsoever. Thanks for reading my review.
B00BESNKB8|4.0|As long as you go in not taking this movie seriously, you will be more than entertained. Watched it with some friends and we had a great time. Totally worth at least one viewing.
1781164266|5.0|Yet another must have visually stunning coffee table companion perfectly suited for any person who appreciates the artistic ingenuity that goes into the design and development of a video game. The dust jacket has a smooth, almost liquid velvet touch to it and the vibrant reds ever so perfectly hash their way into the black darkness. A metallic overlay has been added to specific areas, thus creating this awesome coffee table piece to be drooled over by all who dare to draw near it.<br />\\"Chi Wai Lao's final approved drawing of what would become the iconic Engineering Suit was his 38th try at it, and that's after many other artists had a go at Isaac before him.\\"<br />Inside, over 300 stunningly captivating pieces of artwork can be found, including the most model sheets for a game I have ever seen within a book. Nothing is left out; from the sketch-ups to the final turn tables, we get an insiders view of the ingenuity behind one of the most beguiling games to come to market.<br /><br />This compendium takes you through the seven-year journey behind the scenes of the creative geniuses at Visceral Games studio, behind the video game, Dead Space. As a game designer, I can fully appreciate all of the details put into these companion books. It's not just about the game story, but of the birth and creation from one idea that blossoms into the next idea. It's more than just smashing  a few buttons on a controller while attempting to beat the game. It truly is about a much larger picture unseen by most, yet appreciated by millions. Even if you are not an avid gamer, if you are into art, this is a book that you must have.<br />*You can view the original review at City Book Review
B00CW665VI|5.0|Kudos author lady.  I took this book down in one day.  It was witty and funny and I loved that it was told from the male MC's POV.  This was such a light great read but at the same time it had heart.  LOVE LOVE Can't wait to see what you do next.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|So far, I absolutely love the mouse.  I like that (unlike the terrible r.a.t. 7 which only lasted 3 months), it seems to be quite functional in ubuntu linux 13.04.  I wish that the software extended into this segment, but it is not totally necessary (the buttons perform a set function, but are not customizable as far as I know).  At least the dpi function works and the button closest to the back of the mouse functions as a start button.  For the price, compared to the rat 7 which ended any thread of hope I had for madcatz as a company, this is the best mouse on the market :)
B004EPZ06G|4.0|Not as good as the first one (of course), but still very good and worth watching.  A bit over the top at times, but very funny.  You just gotta love the Hangover movies.

B0085YOD1A|1.0|Pros: This app has some interesting info it provides beyond the scope of just the battery<br />Cons: It provides roughly the same information Android does<br /><br />Final Thought: Not worth the money as you can get the same data if you just look.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Better than expected - my husband & I have really enjoyed watching Downton Abbey.  Great character development & a good story line. A+ historical fiction.
B005LAIIKI|5.0|I have the soundtrack album of this movie and it includes lines of dialog that didn't make it into the movie.  I was hoping to see the deleted scenes with those lines, but there are no deleted scenes in this disc.  The movie is terrific, one of the best westerns ever, but the DVD could have used more extras.  The extras that are supplied are pretty good.
B009NY43NY|1.0|So I'm not going to rehash what everyone else has said - not because I disagree but because I think we all get the point. All I really want to say is how disappointed I am that such a great series has gone downhill so much. This last book was the worst... It felt rushed - like the writer was just ready to be done with it.  Tie it all up and call it a night.  I wish I hadn't pre-ordered it because I most likely wouldn't have purchased it after reading all the reviews and wasted my money.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|While waiting to go to sleep, reach and choose melodies like a river, a waterfall, ocean waves, rain, or many others, and it stays on all night and wake up relaxed and to a fully charged cell phone providing you plug it the night before.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|It's been a long time since a story kept my interest like this one.  I felt all the emotions this family went through...it was quite a ride!
B00CTSDDVO|2.0|In all fairness, I wasn't going to go to this movie. I wasn't impressed with the first one. While it wasn't terrible, it was pretty forgettable. Not a hallmark of a great movie. But some friends talked me into it so here I am. Déjà vu.<br /><br />And much like the first movie I'm kinda torn here. While there are many things going right for this movie (it looks beautiful) I still can't get past the feeling I had 3/4 of the way through it as the (SPOILER) Enterprise is falling toward Earth in what should have been the most intense part of the movie...I was bored, so bored that as the ship was falling to Earth I actually thought that this would be a good time to run the credits over the scene. Maybe it had something to do with the fact that this scene seemed to tacked on (like many other scenes) that its hard to imagine they actually did it. Or maybe it had something to do with the fact that I didn't care if the ship did crash, killing everyone on board.<br /><br />The first part of the movie was smart. The plot and the character development seemed headed in an interesting direction. But ultimately, it fizzled. And so to make up for it, they throw in some really unnecessary scenes to create the tension that the main story arch should have provided.<br /><br />I dunno....after watching both movies, I really think they should refocus their energy into doing a TV series....that is where Star Trek has always shined. That is where Star Trek was always the most interesting. A medium where they can create more substance....and fewer explosions. Action scenes and explosions were never what Star Trek was about. I actually feel that these movies are doing Star Trek a disservice.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|It is the best because it it  kind telling you what to do if you had a pet.It kind of tells you what to expect from your own site for how to play,feed and wash them.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|They loved it and have even gotten this grandma hooked on them, too. Love that its a complete set. The movies are great!!
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|I played this game on my Kindle Fire despite being leery about playing a hog on it. To my surprise it was a delight to play. The story was clever and intriguing, the puzzles challenging, and the cut scenes, ambient noises and character voices were superb. Well made game that I would recommend to anyone who enjoys adventure gaming and hidden object games.
B00BG08FKK|5.0|When I do not have the time to watch the movie, this is the next best thing! So glad I bought the CD.

B00B7VZN76|5.0|HD Blu-Ray just makes it better.I love the special features and would love to see more deleted scenes. CBS please do DS9 after TNG!
B0024RIMBG|4.0|I would recommen this DVD.  It is well done and contains a lot of music.  The Celtic Woman are beautiful vocailsts and fun to watch.  The musicians and orchestra are wonderful.  I didn't think the selection o sons was as good as other Celtic Woman concerts.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|A rare view of one of the greatest leaders ever during a major crisis.  Lincoln's desire and ability to put personal feelings aside and build a cabinet with former &#34;enemies&#34; is amazing as is his uncanny ability to make hard decisions.  A great historical book, but also a leadership book as well.
B0093Q8W0C|5.0|North by Northwest is a classic suspense film by Alfred Hitchcock, the master of suspense, with a great cast. The DVD is clear and crisp.
B0019IB0II|5.0|Dr. Taylor's book is a treasure. For anyone dealing with an individual who has suffered a stroke this book is a must. I only wish I had been able to read this volumn prior to spending the last few months of her life with my mother. This book profoundly altered my understanding of stroke victims as well as my understanding of how my own brain functions. Thank you Dr. Taylor for a beautifully written  and insightful book.It changed me forever.
B005RYF5JA|5.0|I love the music and energy these performers have.  Beautiful music and lovely dresses.  The sound quality is excellent and the filming is well done.  I would recommend this for everyone, especially those tired of the current typical &#34;Bad Girl&#34; performers.
B00578FKVE|5.0|What more needs be said about this, it is a tragedy that this show was cancelled, there were so many possibilities that could be ironed out with a weekly episodic Terminator. Netflix take note, to hell with Arrested Development, revive The Sarah Connor Chronicles!
B003UPPO2G|5.0|Not much on musical videos, but my friends, this is a musical masterpiece that will last as long as there is an ear to listen, and an experience to remember. You may never see anything like this again!
B0090EJ99A|5.0|This was Zohan meets Borat, meets Cohen - but it was funny in places but very predictable and playing on the cultural stereotypes that Cohen is most at home with, so yeah pretty good.
B008Y1RTUG|3.0|much like the twilight movies its not so much that they are really really bad its just it wasn't much better than really bad. the writing was less than fantastic, less than alright. the writing was flat out terrible. However, the cinematography was beyond expectation. the performances mostly were at least alright and i was suprisingly pleased to see both Bob Hoskins and Ian McShane even if it was only for a few minutes altogether. I think they are two fabulous actors and while the writing was ghastly and the parts were suprisingly small (no pun intended)they made the best of their ten minute appearance. the writing was bad enough i was suprised to see either of those two as well as Charlize Theron. Now coming to our key cast, I appreciated the slight scottish brogue that our hero had but felt it didn't add much and possibly it would have been better without. other than that he was a highlight although I prefered him as Thor. maybe its the cocky arrogance he pulled off so well yet still was like-able. Charlize Theron did well. She was possibly the only person fully invested in her role. and Kristin Stewart, well I can't help but feel the good reviews she has thus far gotten for this movie come from either her parent's friends, her staff, and the many twi-hards who dont hate her for ruining the fantasy about bella and edward out there. she played the same role she always plays with a less than believable vague british accent. this movie was trying to be to way too dark and too serious with a large budget focusing on a relatively untalented person. If you want a dark snow white movie watch Snow White :A Tale of Terror. the acting is at least as good and snow white herself is considerably better still maybe no oscar winner but better. the movie all around is better according to me. not saying its a good movie just a better version of the same story. which oh yeah who ever wrote this knocked that movie off somewhat at least as far as snow white falling for the other guy rather than the prince.rather than the prince.
0425263924|4.0|This is a hard review for me to write because I'm always so nervous when it comes to sequels and third (and fourth and fifth) books in a saga. I loved Bared to You and Reflected in You and I feel like I've been waiting for Entwined with You for ages. Honestly, I think the only way to fully wrap my head around the third installment of the Crossfire series would be to re-read the entire thing from the beginning but ain't nobody got time for that.<br /><br />Entwined with You picks up right after Reflected in You leaves off... so for those of you who have read the series, you know what was just revealed.... and it was a big deal. Despite the fact that this giant revelation is sitting in Gideon and Eva's laps, they decide to turn their focus to their relationship and have a lot of sex. I mean, a lot of sex. More so than what I remember from the first two books and while I do enjoy my fair share of steamy scenes, more often than not I was rolling my eyes and thinking, 'Come on now, guys. Let's stop humping and get to talking!\\"<br /><br />That being said, I did appreciate all of the attention that they paid to bettering themselves as a couple. Gideon and Eva had been through a lot in the past book and it was nice to see them trying to work through it all. And, after the roller coaster that was Reflected in You, I enjoyed a relatively drama-free ride. There were definitely tense parts that tested Gideon and Eva's relationship but compared to the previous books, it was smooth sailing. They were both able to admit areas that they needed to work on and seem very committed to seeing their relationship through.<br /><br />Unfortunately, nothing is ever good for long and I fear for the two in the fourth and fifth books. As much as I enjoy their story, I would have been okay wrapping things up with Entwined with You. I'm afraid that Day is going to pull out ridiculous plot lines that will eventually ruin the love I have for this series. But, let's be real - I could always say that I won't be reading the next book... but that is not going to happen.<br /><br />This review was originally posted on www.acreads.blogspot.com.t I won't be reading the next book... but that is not going to happen.<br /><br />This review was originally posted on www.acreads.blogspot.com.

B00B2TTVNU|5.0|I am writing this review in response to the blowhard \\"musical experts\\" who rated Valentina Lisitsa's Rachmaninoff recording a 3.<br />These are tone deaf trolls with personal agendas for promoting other artists. These clueless wonders ignore the fact<br />that Rachmaninoff was a close friend of Horowitz and called Horowitz' 1943 performance of the #3 at the Hollywood Bowl \\"The way I only<br />imagined it in my dreams.\\" We know how Rachmininoff thought it should sound because he told us Horowitz was perfect. We don't need the amateur opinions of<br />third rate musicians. And yes, indeed ! Watching the way Valentina drapes those long Horowitz like fingers over the keys there is a technical virtuosity comparable to Horowitz.<br />Secondly Valentina interprets Rachmaninoff in a very Russian tone that is natural to her. Despite the speed with which she plays<br />she exquisitely voices all of the melodies to perfection. There is one critic who called the engineering \\"blowsy\\" and unfortunately I agree with this.<br />I don't want to \\"hold my breath\\" so I can hear the twinkling soft piano passages. I ripped the mp3s and boosted the soft passages 25%. I also<br />boosted the overall volume another 15%. I would say that the engineers did this recording a great disservice. But once boosted up to listenable<br />levels, the mesmerizing beauty of these recordings immediately becomes apparent. If you watch the Documentary on how these recordings were made<br />you will see that Valentina is playing a 17 year old Steinway with a specific \\"twinkly\\" sound. The true magic of this special piano requires<br />the boost in sound levels. So with a little bit of work I got myself a one of a kind CD that is a work of pure pianistic genius.<br />A great performance by the LSO could also have been better engineered. Specifically, not enough bass end for my taste. But all quibbling aside<br />I have listened to this CD 15 times in the last couple of weeks .... MESMERIZING. It delivers its emotional payload with authority.<br />Valentina makes good on her claim that Rachmaninoff needs to be interpreted as a contemporary composer, not as a romantic. Great stuff.
0380018179|5.0|Fast delivery, good quality movie, good price, everybody at home likes good movies and this movie was great. I recommended. I would like to see the movie but was not available or I didn't see it.

0425263924|3.0|I waited for months, re-read the others to get ready for it.  Was ok to read, very hot and steamy but realised it stopped so abruptly. Trilogy is exactly that....a set of 3, not 4 or 5.  Its a pity really as it would have been fab and did the story justice by sticking it in 3 installments like FSoG. No need to drag it out further as most of the angst has been sorted. Only so much of on/off/on/off relationship a couple can have then it turns far fetched crap!!
B00CW665VI|5.0|I loved every page of this Book! It was funny and wit! I definitely will read more about this Author! Great Book!
B00CT2P6VA|5.0|I have quell and quell reflect. all 3 games are equally as challenging as previous. it took me awhile but I finished the other 2 and just felt like I wanted more and more. THANK YOU!!
B004T32SOK|4.0|As of right now, i am using this on an HP Touchpad running Cyanogenmod. This is an easy way to transfer data without an SD card(which it doesnt have) or using the cable. The interface is good (simplistic) and the data shows up relatively quickly after adding it to my account from another device. It comes with 5 gb's free storage. When i bought my Touchpad, they were giving away 50 gb's with no annual fee so i got that. Works good. I would like it to have the ability to download pictures and cache them so my tablet can be a digital picture frame and then delete the cache when i exit. I know that's a lot to ask and not very conventional. Over all, it is a basic &#34;cloud&#34; storage service that many others also supply.
B009HEMW4W|5.0|This is an excellent movie, my favorite of the franchise.  Great fun and action. Spoiler alert... its got a sad ending.
B00001X590|5.0|Joe Cocker has always been one my favorite artists and this is one of my favorite Cocker albums! I have heard Joe do many versions of With A Little Help...,but on this album the power of Joe's voice will give you chills! His version of Bye Bye Blackbird is unique and beautiful! Every song on this album is great! If you are a long time Cocker fan or a first timer, I believe you will thoroughly enjoy this album!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Timing was perfect. Usually middle sequels are slow and tedious building to the next book, but not this one. I highly recommend this book!<br />Barb S in Montana
B0085YOD1A|5.0|Good app works as described and takes up minimal taskbar space. Got while free app of day and like it so far
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|This movie was not only beautifully crafted,directed, written and casted, it took the viewer to a place of unparalleled horrors.  The small glimpses of true humanity through the chaos of it all--be it the caress of a baby brother's head or the defiance of an unaffected tourist to lend his cell phone for a moment brings to mind so many questions and issues that humanity as a whole must face, regardless of tragedies such as this. The acting is second to none by all involved. You'll be fearful, happy, in tears, and somewhat hateful at all twists and turns, much like the water itself moves you. Definitely a must watch.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Absolutely loved it actually I lifestyle whole series .Can't wait for the next book. Any news when it will be out?
B007P2DQJI|5.0|good stuff good stuff will shop again thanks for everthing great shop to keep it up good day ....................... thanks
B001GM28HO|5.0|A bit odd to be reviewing this in 2013, but seeing as how I want to do album review videos, this seems like a good start. Let me start by saying I've been a huge Lady Gaga fanboy ever since I saw her \\"Poker Face\\" music video in early 2009. I often associate that year with this album because I listened to it a lot that year and honestly couldn't go anywhere without hearing one of her songs! Haha. I guess you could say it was the soundtrack of my '09. Anyways, I've actually never been all that into mainstream/radio music, nor was I a big pop/dance person. I preferred rap and rock, mostly. The main reason I checked out \\"Poker Face\\" was that I found Gaga to be so beautiful, and I've had a major crush on her ever since. It's hard to describe her music as a whole because of how varied she is, but her instantly-recognizable voice, clever use of metaphors, and addictive, catchy beats make for something I can fully enjoy. I received the 3rd edition rather than the usual 2nd edition that was more common in the US, and this one is definitely the definitive version of the album. It contains 16 songs, all but \\"Retro Dance Freak\\" which can be easily found with a YouTube search. I will give a quick summary of my thoughts on each song:<br /><br />Just Dance: Explosive, energetic beat, very catchy chorus, lyrics are a bit simplistic compared to the rest of the album, but it's not too repetitive or anything. Good lead single.<br /><br />LoveGame: A rather infamous song featuring the now-iconic \\"Disco Stick\\" line. Many say that music can't \\"turn you on\\", but this is quite a sexy song, for lack of a better word. Easy to dance to!<br /><br />Paparazzi: Hands down, my favorite Gaga single to date. The music video tells an interesting story, and out of all the singles, this one carries the most complex and often strange lyrics. It's essentially about a stalker. Has similar sex appeal to LoveGame.<br /><br />Poker Face: What many consider as her \\"signature song\\". Contains humorous metaphors and allusions to gambling turned into sexual puns(if that makes any sense). Dark, almost hypnotic beat.<br /><br />I Like It Rough: For some reason, this one was #5 on this version of the album. It's the perfect song to drive fast to, although you may wanna listen to it and play Need For Speed or something, because driving fast IRL could get you into some trouble, haha. As always, it's uber-catchy, and the title kinda speaks for itself!<br /><br />Eh, Eh: A rather overlooked and underrated single. It was given comparatively low reviews for being too different from the others, but albums are supposed to be varied, after all! It's a happy, feel-good song with pretty simple lyrics. Good to listen to when feeling down, maybe?<br /><br />Starstruck: Yet another sexually-charged song full of clever sexual puns made out of musical terms. It has a hip-hop feel to it, and has a guest rap verse by Flo-Rida. Auto-tune is used here, but it's one of the only songs since \\"California Love\\" to actually use it right. Sex appeal factor ranges from equal to or greater than that of LoveGame, your mileage may vary.<br /><br />Beautiful, Dirty, Rich: A promotional single that was originally going to take the place of \\"Poker Face\\". Has a driving, up-tempo beat and was apparently written while LadyG was rather high off of cocaine. Again, the title kinda speaks for itself. Overall a pretty fun song and great for rhythm games.<br /><br />The Fame: Well, it's the title track, and as it should, it really stands out! This one is a look into the lifestyles of the famous, albeit a bit of a tongue-in-cheek one, full of sarcasm.<br /><br />Money Honey: Probably my least favorite song on the album, but not terrible by any means. Her vocals are a bit different here and she tries to do this thing with her voice that I can't really describe. She does it in Retro Dance Freak, but pulls it off a bit better there. Lyrically it's aight.<br /><br />Boys, Boys, Boys: Another one of my least faves if I hadto pick, but then again, it's not made to lyrically appeal to straight males. I love the beat, however! Reminds me a bit of her later song, Dance in the Dark.<br /><br />Paper Gangsta: A bit of a genre shift here, as this is a rap song, and surprisingly, she raps pretty damn well! This song is about Def Jam records turning her down abruptly when she was trying to make it big. It has a degree of emotion behind it; it's a bit melancholy but catchy nonetheless.<br /><br />Brown Eyes: This is my favorite song on the album by far, and my favorite song she's ever made. It's a rock ballad. I was actually quite appalled that someone said it sucked in another review. This one really hits home with my emotions and shows a more serious side of Gaga. It's about a love lost, which is something anyone should be able to relate to.<br /><br />Summerboy: My second-favorite song on the album. It's about how relationships, particularly with random people you meet during summer, can be very fleeting and short-lived. Again, it really plays with your emotions, but is very happy and feel-good, similar to Eh, Eh.<br /><br />Disco Heaven: First bonus track on this version. As the title suggests, it's a pretty straight up disco song, very catchy and fun to dance to. I played this at my senior prom, and everyone loved it!<br /><br />Again, Again: Second bonus track on this version, was originally a regular track on the first version. It's another rock ballad with a similar feel to Brown Eyes, or her later hit, You and I. It's another one of my favorites, and I even uploaded my own cover of it on YouTube.<br /><br />In conclusion, this is one of the most solid albums I've ever listened to, and after 4 years, it still hasn't gotten old or boring. Though I adored Lady Gaga's next two albums, I feel like she's yet to top her original. Either way, sorry for the long ass review, but I hope I gave enough insight here.to pick, but then again, it's not made to lyrically appeal to straight males. I love the beat, however!

B00AYR2FOI|4.0|Boz Scaggs was a favorite in our household years ago.  I wondered how he would sound today.  &#34;Memphis&#34; does not disappoint!  Boz's smooth, soulful voice sounds just as good today.  &#34;Gone Baby Gone&#34; and &#34;Corrina Corrina&#34; are the standout songs on this CD.
B000U6BT40|1.0|I couldn't watch the whole episode (almost made it through). The premise was just stupid and the acting was pretty bad. You could tell the actors thought the whole thing was silly.<br />If it's meant as a spoof it rates a little higher.
B005CQWDT8|4.0|The graphics were nice and it connected with the old story rather well. All that being said it never really developed into something other than more of the same.
B000FA675C|5.0|Though fictional, this book was intriguing from the beginning to the end.  It illustrates what 'could' happen if we are not careful in what we allow others to do for/to us.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|this game is soooo addicting!!! I justify it by saying that it increases my spacial awareness and my problem solving abilities. I HIGHLY recommend this!!
1469220725|3.0|What there was of it was good but I completely understand why other readers are so angry with Sylvia Day.  The book ended so abruptly the only conclusion one can come to is that the author is exploiting her audience for monetary gain. Disappointing.
B008133MDK|5.0|I really loved this season, it was great watching it, I can't wait for next season, this is a great show

B009IH0ICG|5.0|I purchased this one by mistake , not realizing they are made for the , Weber Smokey Joe series , so if you have one , this , &#34; Weber 7447 Compact Rapidfire Chimney Starter , is for you , don't waste your money on the cheap ones , as they don't last and are quick to rust !! These last longer , and light your charcoal so much faster !! The one I bought , I gave to a friend , ( who has a Weber Smokey Joe )  , and she loves this new starter !! So that is two satisfied customers !!

B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|This game is tons of fun and extremely addictive. It is challenging but never too much so. Would definitely recommend.
0425263924|1.0|I bought the book thru Apple Itunes, but I have to write the review in this website to discourage people from purchasing this crappy book.  I had looked forward to finishing the trilogy, and run to the abrupt ending and a disingenous blub from the author who wants to make money from her customer.  Don't bite the bait. I will not buy another book from Sylvia Day! I felt tricked and upset about the stunt she pulled on a trilogy that turns to a never ending serial storyline! The book have too many forgettable sex scenes, and a sketchy, thin plot.  It was a complete waste of time.
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|It's not what I was expecting in the iron man game. I enjoy playing it but it may just be the novelty of something different.
B00ABGEFWC|4.0|This game is so adorable it's ridiculous. The little rides for the pets are too cute, and it has a lot of little touches that really make it shine.<br /><br />HOWEVER<br /><br />This game is also an outrageous cash cow, looking to suck parents out of hundreds of dollars. Yes, I said hundreds. One pet costs 750 &quot;bling&quot; to unlock and purchase. 800 &quot;bling&quot; is sold for $50. So if your child has their heart set on an elephant, you are either going to fork over $50 or have a temper tantrum on your hands. And that's just ONE of the dozens of cash purchase pets. A tiger will cost you 1000 &quot;bling&quot; and there are even higher prices. It's actually quite disgusting to see a children's game so shamelessly packed with greed. I have no problem spending $5 or $10 every now and then on in-app purchases, but this is ridiculous. The pets priced in the low &quot;bling&quot; amounts are welcome though rare. I would love to see them bring the prices down out of the stratosphere.<br /><br />Gameloft has released yet another &quot;free&quot; game that is more about jacking your wallet than anything else. Honestly Gameloft, are you all out of your ever-loving MINDS?!
B0087ZG7PW|5.0|The birds is my favorite Alfred Hitchock movie, timeless and always delivers. The DVD is also a great price. Love the movie.
B007HO392S|5.0|She has done it again.  This is a great CD.  Songs range from sad to funny.  If you haven't heard the Cupid and Two Black Cadillacs----run don't walk to buy this CD.
B00881PTRC|5.0|I enjoy using this game to kill time while waiting in line a Disney and at airports.  One of the few games that I play on a fairly regular basis.
B003CI90MQ|3.0|This really is a good book and has some valuable tips. It truly isn't bad, but I was expecting for something more advanced. Most things I've read here, I already knew. I found a couple of things to be repetitive.<br />All-in-all, it's a good book if you're getting started with photography.
B00A6KGDDM|5.0|One of the more consistently exciting string quartets making specialmusi these days is the unique Quatuor Eb&egrave;ne formed in 1999 when the players were students at the Boulogne-Billancourt Conservatory. The members of the ensemble are: Pierre Colombet and Gabriel Le Magadure, violins; Mathieu Herzog, viola; and Raphaël Merlin, cello. They are a creative crew, pushing the boundaries of the classical repertoire with crossovers into popular and experimental music.<br /><br />But it is the ensemble's classical side that has earned it its greatest successes, especially in performances of works by Haydn, Schubert, Brahms, Borodin, Faur&eacute;, Debussy, Ravel, Prokofiev, Bart&oacute;k, and scores of others. Here they page homage to the Mendelssohns offering refreshing alive performances of the famous couples string quartets.<br />Included here are the following:<br /><br />String Quartet No. 2 in A minor, Op. 13  of Felix Mendelssohn (1832)<br />String Quartet in E flat major of Fanny Mendelssohn (1834)<br />String Quartet No. 6 in F minor, Op. 80 of Felix Mendelssohn (1847)<br /><br />The Quatuor Eb&egrave;ne delivers another recording filled with innovation and virtuosity here exploring the music and relationship between the brother and sister composing duo Felix and Fanny Mendelssohn. The immense outpouring of respect the quartet has for the Mendelssohns is brilliantly displayed in this release. They capture the Felix and Fanny both showed in these amazing pieces as well as their youthful, yet elegant and masterful talents.<br /><br />Felix wrote The Quartet in F Minor, Op. 80, months following Fanny's death in 1847. It was the last major piece he completed before he died two months later on November 4, 1847. He composed the piece as an homage to his sister Fanny who had died on May 17 of that year and it bore the title \\"Requiem for Fanny.\\" The piece contains an anguished Allegro vivace assai, dark Allegro assai, moving Adagio in A flat major, and Finale that expresses extreme grief up to its anguished closing bars. This powerful piece would prove to be Felix's final piece as he died months after its completion. Grady Harp, June 13sses extreme grief up to its anguished closing bars. This powerful piece would prove to be Felix's final piece as he died months after its completion. Grady Harp, June 13
0345537998|5.0|I had read all 5 GOT books, so I looked at this earlier GRRM work.  This is a highly entertaining, and very imaginative<br />book that is nothing like the GOT series.  An easy read (but still 300 odd pages), yet it will get you thinking.  Highly<br />recommended for any that enjoy science fiction.
B004TTMYQG|5.0|I've tried a bunch, but none are as easy to read and use as this one. Lots of options and works beautifully with Google Calendar.
B00CTSDDVO|1.0|First off let me start with the positives. The action is shot well, the actors all do their job, and the music wasnt half bad.<br />Its those things that keep this from being one of the worst films Ive seen this year. And boy did it try its best to suck. The story was nonexistent, rather the writers decided to liberally lift from previous films and incarnations of Star trek, the dialog was bad (apart from Scotty, but its Simon Pegg, so of course he's awesome), and the \\"science\\" part of this science fiction was really bad. Using cold fusion to defuse a volcano? Actually dropping Spock into the volcano in person rather than just beaming the device from space? Theres so much wrong with the prologue alone, one could dedicate a thesis paper on it. To me the biggest offense this film took was using the events around 9/11 in a shockingly tasteless way. Im surprised more people werent outraged by this film, because it was offensive on all fronts.<br /><br />I know a lot of people probably dont agree with me, but I find it hard to believe that this is the best JJ Abrams and co could come up with after what was a really fun reboot of the franchise (yes im aware its flawed as well)
B003SHDP4K|5.0|Ha ha or however the French say it. A stunning follow up to Angels and Demons. Langdon is called up again to solve the riddle of the ages. As with the first book, wonderfully written and totally engrossing. This is not Catholic bashing, it's a story and if anything adds to the intrigue of it all.<br />I was lucky enough to visit Paris recently and was excited to try find the special places from the story.
B0085YOD1A|3.0|I'll try a lot of apps but I don't want any taking up room on my device unless I feel that they are useful.  The first page you get after you click on this device in the carosel is a page with a picture of a battery that has the percentage of battery left and an approximate time.  We all know the time left depends on what you are doing so it really is just an approximation.  Below the battery there is a strip with three choices, BAT, AC, and USB.  BAT is the only one not greyed out on my Kindle Fire HD and you really can't select the others so I have no idea what their intent is.  Below the strip is a bar with two blocks, Notifications and Advanced.  If you touch Notifications so the circle has the green dot then when you swipe down to see notifications you will see your battery level.  If you touch the Advanced block you go to a page that shows you the battery temperature, Voltage, Health, and battery technology.  I use the Android Assistant App and it gives me all this data and a lot of other useful stuff so this is just redundant for me.  Below the temperature, Voltage, Health, and technology are a \\"More Apps\\" block and a \\"Useage\\" block.  More apps just what you would think more apps, both free and to buy\\".  I don't like the idea of buying apps from within apps but that is just me.  I had high hopes for the \\"Useage\\" block.  I was hoping it would show what was using my battery and how much percentage things were using.  I'm such a dreamer.  All this does is take you to the Kindl \\"Device\\" page that show you how much Batter power you have remaining and where you can set it up to show the battery data in the Status bar.  Really, I can swipe down from the home page, select more and the select Device to get to this same page.  I can select \\"on\\" for the \\"show battery percentage in status bar\\" and I always have the battery percentage at the top right of my screen on the same row where it has my Kindle name and time.<br /><br />So with all this said I just don't see a use for this app.  I guess if you want it in your notifications rather on the top right of your screen you might find a use but I think I'll just stick with the Kindle feature and save the space for something more useful so I'm removing it from my device and account.  There isn't really a reason to junk up my cloud with it either.  My virus program did scan it and said it loaded clean.  I did turn off my wireless and it still worked so I'm not sure why one reviewer said it needed the internet.  I didn't find anything bad but I didn't find it useful for me so that's why the 3 stars--it's just OK.for this app.  I guess if you want it in your notifications rather on the top right of your screen you might find a use but I think I'll just stick with the Kindle feature and save the space for something more useful so I'm removing it from my device and account.

0425263924|1.0|My advice on this book? Don't bother with it. Having read 'Bared To You' and  'Reflected In You' I looked forward to the conclusion of the story in 'Entwined With You.' Apparently Ms Day doesn't understand that the word 'trilogy' means 3,there is to be a fourth and even fifth book,  '[[ASIN:0425263924 Entwined with You (Crossfire, No. 3) (A Crossfire Novel)]]' advances the story very little and the frequent and repetitive sex gets to be irritating as does Eva's constantly reminding us how gorgeous and well endowed Guideon is........Yeah I think we got the point in book one.<br /><br />I'm done with this story and wish Eva and Guideon luck. They're going to need it.

It was so well written from a mans point of view and really had me belly laughing at times.  A really great read
B0085YOD1A|3.0|It works like a charm. I like this app very well considering the price. It tells me how long I have left to use my device before it dies.
0425263924|4.0|I had this book on pre-order and it was well worth the wait - I started reading it as soon as it landed on my kindle.  I love these books and love the writing style of Sylvia Day.<br /><br />If I'm honest, I didn't think it was quite as good as the first 2 but I still couldn't put it down and love the relationship between Gideon and Eva (true love conquers all).  I cant wait for the 4th and 5th ones to arrive; hopefully they wont be too long a wait.<br /><br />I must also note to any newbies thinking of reading this series, please dont be put off by the seriously negative reviews that have been written of this book (some of which I cant actually believe!!!!). The series is a great read and you wont be disappointed so bite the bullet, go for it and welcome to the world of Gideon (nom! nom!!)
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|This is a hard book for me to review. I LOVED the first two Crossfire books! This one was still a good read but I think after waiting so long for this book to be released I was expecting so much more, and because of that expectation, I was disappointed.<br /><br />I liked seeing Gideon's personal growth and the progression of Eva and Gideon's relationship. Gideon is more relaxed and playful with Eva. He opens up more and answers her questions freely where before he would close up and she would have to work at getting him to talk to her. Their sex was HOT and Intense!!  But I wish the story was more about them and not all about the drama surrounding them. I also felt the ending was awkward. Thank goodness there was no major cliffhanger but it left you confused and definitely wanting more.<br /><br />Lastly, although this did not affect my rating of the book, in my opinion it would have made more sense to keep this series as a trilogy and maybe do a spin-off of the other characters if Sylvia Day and all of us fans wanted to keep the story going. This book needed to wrap up Eva and Gideon's emotional love story with the happy-ending we are all waiting for. Instead it jumped around too much and put the focus on too many secondary characters and their stories ~  Megumi, the new twist in Nathan's Case (the Russian Mob), Eva's mom and dad, Brett, Tatiana, Trey, Mark & Steven, Deanna, Corinne & Jean-Francois Giroux...phew.....TOO many! Sylvia Day has an enormous amount of talent and I do not feel that this was her best work.

0375851569|5.0|My wife and I have made it a tradition in our family to give this set of books to 3 year-olds on their birthday. Beats any number of toys or useless games that are available on the market. People who know us already know the drill. They do not go out and buy Dr. Seuss books, knowing that they are going to receive this set when their kids turn 3. Amazing how effective these books are in teaching children to read.

B008UCJ7KO|4.0|But really hated how it ended.  Really left you hanging. Hope we don't have to wait another 9 months for the sequel. I think waiting that long is BAD.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|\\"Greed Is Good\\" according to Gordon Gekko, Wall Street...This must have also been the mantra of Sylvia Day and her publisher!!! What other reason could there be to lead her readers on with this non-book and expect us to patiently wait for two more and charge us another $10. for each one? WTF? You know, it's one thing to pay $3.99 for a book that ends up being a one star waste of time but it's hard to stomach this type of greed! I loved book one and two and pre-ordered this one in anticipation of wrapping up a great \\"TRILOGY\\". This was such a huge disappointment. I was as annoyed with Eva and Carey as I was with Corrine! Seriously, how many different ways can Eva get to work in the morning?!!! I will not pre-order any more books from Amazon, I'll wait and read the reviews first. I can only hope this will be a PR nightmare for Sylvia Day and her publisher!
B0049J2BSM|5.0|I didn't let my daughter watch this movie for several years because I did not want to put the idea in her head that there are monsters in her closet , but at age 6 I felt she was ready, and she loved this movie!  So did my 13 year old.  It's a fun story and a great plot.  John Goodman and Billy Crystal are wonderful!  Both kids wanted to see it several times after we rented it from Amazon.

B008UCJ7KO|1.0|I've NEVER returned a Kindle book for refund UNTIL NOW.  Trilogy means THREE....this book did nothing but introduce SEVERAL new sub-plot lines and wrapped up NOT A SINGLE ONE.  Spoiler Alert:  The author (very poorly) introduces several sub plots, including, but not limited to:  Cary may or may not be the father of an illegitimate baby, Megumi is mysteriously missing from work, Gideon and Eva get married, but don't announce it, the jilted former lover/shrink's wife enters the picture, a possible mob connection to Nathan's death...probably a few more I'm overlooking.  NONE of these are wrapped up and the reader is left poorly hanging on to the promise of more to come.  Well...no thanks.  Got my $9.99 back and won't be giving Ms. Day another dime.  The book was touted as the last in a TRILOGY.  Misrepresentation = Refund.
B00797MB0O|3.0|The writing was far from superb, but there was a simple brilliance in the characters. This film isn't about the Adonis, Ulysess, or some epic hero. This film depicts the tragic struggle of young adults to make their lives work in a modern society. We are given a small window into the young married couple, the lonely geek character, and--of course-- the woman and her attempt to make it on her own.<br /><br />There's no redemption to her character. There's no depth. This women is merely entirely narcissitc with mild delusions.<br /><br />This movie is captivating in its ability to portray mental illness without hyperbole.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I absolutely loved this book! The story, the characters, the easiness of the reading itself were all perfect. I have not seen the movie & I'm not so sure I want to as I just can't imagine it living up to the quality of the book.

B001N1DPDE|5.0|Purchased my BK2 locally with a double your money coupon. When The salesperson placed the knife in my hand I was surprised by the weight knife and thickness of the blade. Yes, I had watched the videos, read the reviews and \\"knew\\" that this was a heavy, thick knife but until you hold it, it doesn't really sink in. Although substantial the knife is not too large and fits in my big hands with a comfortable and solid grip.<br /><br />The factory edge was sharp enough to slice through paper and remove some hair from my forearm. A gentle honing with a ceramic sharpener and some stropping finished the edge nicely. For use as a camp/survival knife I didn't want an edge so sharp it would not hold up well with rough use.<br /><br />I tried carving and shaving some tinder from a piece of pine and it was like I was using one of my good wood planes. the wood came of cleanly and formed nice curly strips that would make excellent fire starting material. With more pressure it was easy to remove large amounts of material yet maintain safe control of the knife. Chopping and batoning also proved to be effective with the BK2.<br /><br />I found only two less than positive things about this knife:<br />1. The blade is hard to remove from the molded sheath. You really have to pull to get it to come out. However, I would rather it be too tight that too loose. I am sure this will lessen with use and I certainly won't be worrying about the knife accidentally falling out.<br />2. The black finish is easy to scuff and remove. In just the small amount of testing I performed there are already a number of scuff marks and some of the black material has come off right along the edge where the taper of the blade begins. It is not attractive but no one will think I don't actually use the knife.<br /><br />I can't say that this knife is the best at all the varied tasks it can accomplish but it certainly does a good job without busting the bank. For the time being, I have found my camp and survival knife. This knife meets my needs and is fun to use.

B008UCJ7KO|1.0|This is the first time I have written a review and I read at least two books a week.  I liked the first two books but this one was a total waste of money and time. The ending was abrupt and I agree with everyone that wrote reviews and only gave one star. I also agree that the series was changed from 3 to 5 books inorder to make more money. I do not plan to buy book 4!

B008JJM88Q|5.0|This app is by far my family's favorite. It went down once right after I downloaded it and while it worked fine there was no picture with his guess, but all I did was power off my kindle and when it came back on the game worked like it should again. The five member's of my family have stumped it numerous times on the first guess, but all but once it has been able to guess on the second try. It even got the family dog!  Even dad, who is very anti game, loves this one! The only downside for me is that you have to have an Internet connection to play, so sadly, no play on the go.
B00AESN8XY|3.0|It's fun for the first few times you play it but after a while you know basically all the right steps to win so it becomes boring.

B00COHAUD4|4.0|Both a friend and my brother recommended \\"Mama\\" to me knowing how much I appreciate a good horror movie so I finally decided to watch it last night, insisting my husband watched it with me since I heard the movie had plenty of scares. The film itself has beautiful yet eerie cinematography with a muted bleak palette that reinforces the dark themes in the film. At the heart of the story are two sisters, Victoria and her younger sister Lilly who after five years of being missing are discovered in a dilapidated cabin in the woods in a remote area. The sisters are brought to live with their uncle, Lucas (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau better known for his role as Jaime Lannister in Game of Thrones)and his girlfriend, Annabel (Jessica Chastain). The psychiatrist assigned to the girls' case (Victoria is about 8 and Lilly is about 5 or 6) insists that the 'family' move into a home owned by his clinic and in exchange the psychiatrist, Dr. Gerald Dreyfuss (Daniel Kash) commits to supporting Lucas' claims in a custody battle with the girls' great-aunt Jean (Jane Moffat). The young girls indicate a bond with something they call \\"Mama\\", which Dreyfuss initially dismisses as a coping mechanism rather than anything real.<br /><br />Before long, it becomes apparent that all is not well with the new family unit. The entity that had been caring for the girls at the cabin in the woods has followed the sisters to their new home and feels threatened when it perceives the girls are bonding with Lucas and Annabel, particularly Victoria, the older sibling. An attack by the malevolent entity leads to Lucas ending up in hospital, and Annabel is left to shoulder the burden of caring for the girls by herself. Gradually, over a series of interviews, Dr. Dreyfuss is able to uncover the mystery behind \\"Mama\\", going back in time through history to the 1800s where a tragedy unfolded involving a young, mentally unstable woman who is so consumed by rage when her baby is torn away from her.<br /><br />Though not without its flaws, I found myself quite immersed in the storyline throughout the film. The main actors deliver credible performances though both Coster-Waldau and Chastain were not really able to exercise their acting talents to their full potential here, due to the limitations of the script. Chastain's performance here is actually a bit tepid, and I thought the actor portraying Victoria did a much better job emoting and conveying her dilemma and horror. The CGI effects were great and conveyed the deep sense of horror unfolding on screen.<br /><br />I would recommend this movie for fans of atmospheric horror movies with jump in your seat moments!ot without its flaws, I found myself quite immersed in the storyline throughout the film.

B004WPYNY8|5.0|I thought Paradise Lost was a great album.  I find myself listening to this more.  It's pure metal, with some of the best song writing I've ever heard, and Sir Russell's out-of-this-world singing.  He can do it all.  Darker, heavier and more brutal than the previous offering from these guys.  They're my new favorite.  I've had this CD for a month, and it's all I play.

B004DI7HZ6|3.0|Diana is a historian, who just so happens to be a witch.  Her parents died when she was 9, and ever since then she has avoided magic at every turn - and yet it always seems to find her when she is least looking.  And thus begins the novel, as when Diana is working on a research paper, she stumbles upon a book (Ashmole 782).  This book was long since thought to be lost by all of the supernatural world.  What will she do when witches, vampires and daemons are after her in order to obtain the book for themselves?<br /><br />Matthew Claremont is the first supernatural to show up, a vampire, interested in the book for his own reasons.  As he follows Diana, he is compelled to focus more on her protection, than finding the book.  As the two fall in love, it become evident that this is not the way things work in the supernatural world, as cross-supernatural love is forbidden.<br /><br />I found this all a bit cheesy for 2/3 of the novel.  Matthew and Diana fall in love right away, but I didn't feel any real connection between the two of them.  There was none of that sexual tension that I enjoy in a novel where two beings are inexplicably drawn to each other.  Instead we are just told that they love each other.<br /><br />The story also moved rather slow.  Ashmole 782 didn't seem very spectacular in the beginning.  It wasn't until the end that I started to grasp its importance, but even then it remains a mystery, and not one I'm on the edge of my seat to find out about.  I really had to push myself to keep reading this book, as there was nothing to really excite me.<br /><br />It did get better about 2/3 of the way in.  There was more magic, the mystery of Ashmole 782 was lightened a bit, and we got some more interesting characters as well as a house that has a mind of its own.<br /><br />One thing that really bothered me was Diana and Matthew.  Diana at times seemed like a strong woman.  She was able to withstand serious torture, but then when Matthew wants to host secret \\"war\\" meetings she is not invited, nor is she told any of the plans.  Is there a reason for this?  Not particularly, other than the fact that Matthew wants some nice quiet days without her worrying before things start to heat up.<br /><br />Matthew was also overprotective, which I like in novels where the hero is a strong man.  This is not the case as Matthew appears far too sensitive from the very beginning.  Their relationship just didn't quite fit to me and it wasn't one that I would like to have.<br /><br />However, I will be reading the next book, as the end of the book finally got interesting. If the author could have somehow cut out some of the lengthy descriptions, and slow unnecessary scenes, maybe she could have gotten to this point of it all sooner.  It wasn't until the end of the book that I felt we were just getting to the plot.  There wasn't really any conclusion or big climax that made my heart jump.  Instead it felt drawn out in order to lead up to the ending, which was very cut off.war\\" meetings she is not invited, nor is she told any of the plans.  Is there a reason for this?

B0050DIWFC|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed the whole emotional process of this book.  I could relate to a lot of it because I have sons and could imagine not being able to believe your child capable of committing a serious crime. I was completely blown away by the ending.  In fact. I read the last chapter a second time just to make sure I did not miss something.  We will be discussing it at our book club next Monday.  Should be interesting.

A friend threw a handful on the table and said we could each draw a card and share what it meant.  This is a fun and meaningful experience.  If we didn't like the card; draw another.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|Like others who have read the first two books in this series, I too was anxiously awaiting the release of this book.  Since it took so long to release this book, I actually re-read the first 2 books just prior to reading Entwined with You.  All said, I read all three books in 4 days.  While this book is not the best in the series to date, I really enjoyed it.  Both Eva and Gideon have grown a lot in their ability to trust each other while they still have hang-ups trusting themselves.  The sex scenes in this book are a little more graphic than in the first two books and show an increase in trust between the main characters.  The secondary story of the love triangle between Cary, Trey and Tatiana is a little frustrating until the twist at the end.  It will be interesting to see what happens with Cary in the next two books.<br /><br />I think that the negative reviews are a bit unfair.  Yes, it would have been nice to have the series wrapped up in a trilogy.  However, I look forward to the completion of this love story.  Overall, this book was enjoyable and moved the story along.
B0089LOG02|5.0|I absolutely loved this book about the orphan trains who brought orphans from the East Coast to the Midwest until the late 1920s. The story of Vivian, now in her 90s, is woven together seamlessly with Molly's, a teenager in foster care who helps clean out Vivian's attic. Vivian's experiences on the orphan train and later with the families she ended up with are harrowing and touching. Molly, a tough kid with a kind heart she is trying to hide under her Goth appearance, also has an interesting background. I read this novel in one day while on vacation. It was excellent!

Oren is brilliant at articulating techniques ahead of their time and this book or the \\"red bible\\" as I call it for those that purchase the hard copy, is that good, I read it for the second time immediately after finishing it. The third time I used it like a text book, It guided and helped me re-think my whole approach to the way I pitch in every business and social interaction.<br /><br />For those of you who dare to dream no matter how big or small, \\"pitch anything\\" will change your life and make \\"anything\\" you want, happen.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I was really looking forward to closure but there was none.  Eva and Gideon love each other that's been established.  Now they are still not together, together, hide and seek and some people still have it in for them and looking for secrets to be revealed.  There is so much sex and play that after a while it was too much.  Sylvia Day needs to remember Trilogy means 3 not 4 books, not happy with the ending, I need to hang on for months to see what happens again? Really.<br /><br />This book may have turned me off, Book 1 and 2 were good but 3 was a disappointment.
B0085YOD1A|5.0|Does as outlined in description. Love the temp gage. Also like that it had an easy to read notification counter at top of my nexus 4.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|A historical masterpiece set in pre and world war 1  England. Beautiful costuming brilliantly acted. Downton Abbey is my secret pleasure.
B006GWO5NE|2.0|This product doesn't work for 7&#34; kindle fire, but might work for the kindle fire HD at least now ok
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Uhhhg I can't wait for the next one! Great read! I hope the next book comes out sooner then what I had to wait for this one!
1564148793|4.0|I found this book to be very relatable because he talks about how he's come against so many different attacks from other people, spirits, and even choices that we ourselves made that brought spiritual harm to ourselves.  As I read this book, I was like, FINALLY someone understands what I'm feeling!!!!  But then when he started discussing the solutions....well....let's just say I was raised as a Christian and when I bought this book, I was just getting my feet wet in terms of making the transition into the Craft so some of the lingo had me almost sending this book back at first.  And see the only flaw to this book is that there is no background to his methods--you just have to trust it which I do not recommend to any newcommer to the Craft.  DO YOUR RESEARCH FIRST!!! But with that said, also try to keep an open mind before you say &#34;Oh hell no I ain't touchin that.&#34;  Because now that I am more educated in the areas of his discussion, I must say now, there is really stuff in this material.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I love the fact that there is so much more to the story.  I'm not ready to say goodbye to Gideon just yet.  Knowing there are two books left in the series is like a dream come true.  I love book three and thought it was super sexy.  I can't wait for the fourth installment!
B0091WAWTM|3.0|It did good with describing the different Wiccan practices until they got into the human sacrifice part.  Wiccans don't believe in that
B00A81MV3U|5.0|This was a gift for my mom who does not watch many movies - she did watch it on my recommendation and loved it.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|I have contact with friends that I haven't seen in many years. We thoroughly enjoy updating each other on what's going on in our lives. It's also an excellent source for much news that regular media does NOT report on. All-in-all, it has been a very pleasant expeerience for me to use it.
6305212112|5.0|This movie was very charming and Jessica Tandy was great as usual and I lived in Georgia for a few years and this made me feel like I was back there again. The cast is wonderful and so is the story. I also have a friend who had eaten at the place and had Fried Green Tomatoes there. She saw the movie with me too and said this was a romantic movie. You realy should see it you may just want to buy one. (JV,)<br />.
1476734941|5.0|This is a great book.  Easy to read and understand.  Makes so much sense.  I have been following it since April 1st.  I feel better every day!
B009MCRHH6|5.0|This amazing app is top-notch. A large physics puzzle game that challenges your architechtual ability. No, this isn't your run of the mill build the bridge, let the car cross. You must let small balls of goo get to a pipe, which can be anywhere from the bottom of a spike pit to 50 feet in the air. So what do you use to get there? The goo balls themselves! You do have to keep a certain amount of goo to finish.<br /><br />Again, top-notch ADDICTIVE physics game for any age.<br />-my son's lengthy opinion
B004ZRV3AU|5.0|Works like it is suppose to. See their video before using, instead of using the directions included in the box. It takes a very light touch to score the bottle. A deep score doesn't work well.
B004SRPXWQ|5.0|Talking Tom is adorable!  I introduced him to my mother and now she has him on her kindle and is driving everyone crazy!
B00CXN2JNS|4.0|There are some good songs on here, but for some reason some of the tracks lack that snarl or grit of past Megadeth albums. I do love &#34;Dance in the Rain&#34;, as it has the classic snarl and angst, and the last minute's guitar riffs are some of the best I have ever heard.
B005544V6A|5.0|I finally ordered season one.  I have been wanting to watch this show for a long time but wanted to start from<br />season one so I can understand the plot and characters.
B001QC6QRC|4.0|My son is 5 and he seemed to like it, but he is so obsessed with Ninja Turtles right now.
1405910275|2.0|I just finished what I thought to be the third & final book. Imagine my surprise when reading the last page to find out there is another book coming out- and apparently another after that. I felt the ending was stupid until I learned of this. I found the storyline very repetitious. Kept going back to the same old crap... Eva doubts Gideon's love for her. Will I read the next 2 books? Probably. I hate to leave things unfinidhed
B000HZD168|4.0|Got to see it if you're a Star Trek fan. Classic episode with the crazy enemy Khan. Khan!!!!! Spock is heroic in this.
B000FA675C|2.0|too silly too silly too silly don't buy it, too silly can't say much more than too silly, except very readable lol
1451695195|3.0|Even though I enjoyed the story of the author being in a coma and coming out of such a terrible sickness, the author gave a lot of descriptive events, but too much was medical and technical jargon for my taste.
B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|I liked the characters, and it is well written.  If I had been 30 years younger I would have loved it.  A lot of teenage romance but I was young once, and it was short and if you're a teenager or in your young 20's you will absolutely love it!  I guarantee it!
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|I really can't make an honest judgement on the 3D version because I own a DLP television and I'm not sure if I have the best 3D Bluray player either. But the movie itself is great. Amust to add to your MARVEL collection.
B004J4WKTW|4.0|My lovely daughter thought I  should read this book.......<br />........I owe her a thank you!<br />You know me better than I thought.
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|excellent graphics - I love watching the blobs dance to the music! the sound effects make me laugh.  sometimes I toss the blobs off just for giggles.  the blob doing a &quot;Dolby&quot; in the hint box is great.  everything about this game makes me keep trying for all stars on each level.
1847879071|4.0|This was a great resource and Andy Field does a nice job of bringing humor into a potentially dry subject.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I saw all. The negative reviews for this and just couldn't believe. It. Yes I was disappointed that everything wasn't neatly wrapped up and solved and that we would yet again have to wait. For answers, but the book was written with the same style that had us falling in love with Eva and Gidion. In the first place. Some time what an wither plans and what happen are 2 different things. And don't forget one of the most famous \\"trilogies \\" ever was actually 6 books The Lord of the Rings.
B003XCO800|5.0|This was a replacement DVD. The original \\"died\\" during a move. I love the entire Star Trek series and plan to continue my collection. (reviewed by friend of scribbles)
B00AYR2FQ6|5.0|I bought this for Song for Zula, but have to say, every track is fantastic.  I especially love Ride On/Right On and A Charm/A Blade.
B000HCO83G|5.0|My girlfriend has the box set and after she insisted that I keep her trilolgy together, I decided to get #3 for me. I already had the first 2 and did not know there was a third. Thrilled to have it!(reviewed by friend of scribbles)
B00846REIS|1.0|If you liked Fifty Shades of Grey, you'll hate this.  It's a rip off, poorly written, and the sex scenes are more unbelievable than Fifty's...if that could have even been possible.  Of course she's a rich girl with a sordid past who doesn't care about his money, and of course he's a gorgeous and rich man with too much baggage to handle.  Yet they love one another and constantly have sex...make me gag.<br /><br />Waste of 9.99 for real.  I would give Fifty Shades of Grey a 5/5 in comparison to this book, and I didn't think Fifty Shades was so great either.
B00BSBT8M6|1.0|I downloaded the movie but when I tried to play it I received an error message indicating the download would not play due to some streaming error. I watched the other movie I downloaded; Gangsterland fine with no issues.
B00CWV8TIU|5.0|Enjoyed Side Effects. A good mystery, kept me on my toes!<br />The acting was very good.  I would recommend this movie, if you like an exciting movie.
B008469DGY|4.0|Great scenery, lots of challenges, GREAT graphics! Great way to spend free time! This is one I don't regret downloading,
0345803485|2.0|Oh please this grey character needs to get a clue.  I hated this book.  Here is this rich guy who has everything but is unhappy.  Also the girl is a 25 year virgin - really!
B000B8L6LI|5.0|Great sharpener! Get's all my blades super sharp! Super easy to use on any kind of blade be it pocket knife, chef knife or scissors.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I was looking for a calculator for my Kindle Fire.  Downloaded and Installed this calculator and it works great.  Exactly what I was looking for.  Does what I need it for.  I'm happy.
B009JZSFUY|4.0|This movie is pretty good. Time travel elements, with dumbed down terminators. I have been watching this cast of star trek since I was a kid (30). While this one is not my favourite, it is still a good watch. Like all trek movies, there is a clear message. Give it a watch, you won't walk away disappointed.
B00005RHGL|4.0|I had to watch this, I live fairly close to Tombstone here in Arizona and have been there a bunch of times!  It's a great little city if you've never been.<br />This movie was actually made in part in Tombstone, though I forgot to look for landmarks I'd recognize!<br />I really enjoyed this, never thought I was much of a &#34;cowboy movie&#34; lover!  I thought the cast was darn near perfect,  I just love Kurt Russell and Val Kilmer!<br />I'm glad I bought this, will watch it over and over again!
B0041KKYBA|2.0|\\"Inside Job\\" (2010) documentary explains nothing clearly, identifies no clear villains, and isn't good \\"Scapegoat Theatre\\" or even plain old good show biz done well!<br /><br /> ------------<br /><br />I got INSIDE JOB (2010) in the mail yesterday (ordered a cheap used DVD from good old reliable Amazon.Com), screened it last night.<br /><br />Ugh!<br /><br />The movie didn't provide clear information, targets, villains to remember......nothing. Wasn't good \\"Scapegoat Theatre\\" in the honored tradition of \\"All The President's Men\\" (1975) starring Robert Redford (which implied the Republican Party tried to murder Washington Post reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein, and got away with it!), or \\"The China Syndrome\\" (1979) starring Jane Fonda and Jack Lemon (which claimed power industry people sent hit men after employees willing to be \\"whistleblowers\\", and got away with it!).<br /><br />When the \\"Michael Moore Memorial Scapegoat Movie Awards\\" for \\"Best Scapegoat Movies In History\\" are set up (definitely an unmet need in today's world), two movies which don't deserve top honors as \\"good scapegoat movies\\" are certainly \\"Inside Joh\\" (2010) and it's brother movie about the 2008 finance industry \\"meltdown\\" \\"Too Big To Fail\\" 2012 starring William Hurt as the anguished USA Secretary Of The Treasury.<br /><br />I spent two wasted hours watching \\"Inside Job\\" (2010) and I wasn't a happy camper when the movie was over.<br /><br />Just 2 hours of tormented, uncomfortable, intense guys wearing dark suits and ties talking about, complaining about, apologizing for who knows what?<br /><br />The movie didn't explain anything clearly, didn't identify or highlight a single understandable issue.<br /><br />\\"We got trouble right here in River City\\" all seemed to agree.....<br /><br />OK....so what?<br /><br />The best part, such that any best part occurred at all, was when the insincere and bureaucratically skilled Dean Of The Columbia University (NYC) Business School sort of lost it toward the end of the movie, and told the guy interviewing him he (the Dean) was sorry he agreed to be interviewed, and the interview would end in 3 more minutes and.....that's ALL!<br /><br />Tough dude!<br /><br />That part of the movie was supposed to show how academics in famous business schools were big supporters of the Wall St. players they (the academics) helped make rich and gave profitable advice to (what at Business Schools for, anyway?) the bad guys who made big money and walked away with it during the \\"meltdown\\" crisis of 2001-2007.<br /><br />People go to business schools to learn how to get rich.<br /><br />That's what the schools teach, the best they (the schools) can.<br /><br />The movie producers tried to vilify the school teachers at the business schools for doing their job.<br /><br />Well......OK.<br /><br />At least it would have provided at least one clear villain and one clear target, one clear issue......bad guys at business schools.<br /><br />George W. Bush was (is) a Harvard Biz School grad....has a Master's from that school.<br /><br />That's a start. Go after Biz School grads, esp. famous ones who go on to get power and big money! Great show biz!<br /><br />The \\"Business School grads and teachers conspiracy\\" would have made GREAT \\"scapegoat theater\\" and INSIDE JOB (also TOO BIG TO FAIL) would have been much more entertaining and watchable (this has nothing to do with logical and morally worthy).<br /><br />Anyway, the closest INSIDE JOB came to being good show biz was the scene when the agitated Columbia U.

B0087ZG7UW|4.0|I've never seen this before, just heard about it.  So I thought I'd watch it.  I enjoyed it a lot!  For a movie that was made before lots of special effects were common and before tons of modern techniques, this movie really stands out.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I play this game the most out of all my apps I have. Number 1game. I would recommend. this game to all my friends.
B002RSDW80|4.0|I read the book a long time ago and just never got around to watching the movie.  But I really enjoyed it.  I think Meryl did a great job playing Julia.  And who doesn't love Julia Child?  I'll watch it again soon!
B004QOB8SO|5.0|Even better than the first season.  Love a great mystery with a great detective.  Season two will not disappoint you.
B00AFPTSI0|5.0|I have never read such an academic approach to karma. Great read for everyone wanting to make their workplace better. Adam, you should visit Burning Man this year. Its a week of giving!
B007SGM084|5.0|I had all 3 books finished in about a week and a half!! Great series! I hope El James continues the story!
