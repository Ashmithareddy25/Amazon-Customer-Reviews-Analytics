B007SGLZP8|4.0|Grisham has in the past forced readers through densely worded tomes with intricate plots and many characters.  This is a very refreshing departure, as the tables are turned and the lawyer is one of the incarcerated.  The lawyer theme is intact, but the story is completely different than most of his books and this reader found the crisp plot development and abbreviated character set a fine read.
B009CPES4I|5.0|Ordinary British retirement age people set in their ways take a leap of faith and move to a ramshackle hotel in bustling India where their lives are changed forever. Something essential to the human condition is touched in this film as the Brits, uncomfortable with change, must change to learn needed lessons of life and love. Highly recommended.
098555780X|5.0|As a knot-tyer, I'm always looking for new ways to keep my fingers busy.  This excellent work by J.D. has given me new knots to try, new designs to make, and hours of peaceful, productive fun.  Thanks, J.D.!  Love the YouTube videos, too!
B007HACDLK|3.0|The Last Man is nowhere near the greatness of previous Mitch Rapp books.  The plot is all over the place and the dialogue is disappointingly vapid.  I love the premise, and was excited to see our old friend Louie Gould again, but the execution just isn't there.  If you are a fan of the series, you will certainly enjoy The Last Man to some extent, but Flynn is rapidly going the way of Patricia Cornwell and her Scarpetta series.  When American Assassin came out, I was thrilled because Flynn seemed to recapture the old magic.  Then there was the lackluster Kill Shot, and now this mediocre offering.<br /><br />Vince, I love ya, man, and I'm trying to remain motivated.  I would be very sad if you bagged the Rapp character, but maybe it's time for you to take a break and go with something else for a book or two, like John Sandford does when the Prey series starts getting stale.  I can't justify spending the crazy prices your publishers are dreaming up for such weak stories.<br /><br />It's just not the page-turner the earlier books were.
B00A7ZWUJC|5.0|The best song is Loveeeeeeee Song featuring Future. Rihanna has come with a new sound and style this album and it is amazing.
B00571F26Y|5.0|Great information, a must read! I learned a lot reading it and it helped reaffirm for me the choice I've made to eliminate wheat from my diet.
B00A12VW86|1.0|I think all the tracks should be called things like \\"High Again\\" \\"Didn't Learn My Lesson the First Dozen Times\\" \\"Relapsing Dufus\\" \\"Who Cares, I'm Famous\\".  Maybe they could have called the album \\"I Set a Crappy Example for My Fans Who Shell Out Hard Earned Money to Help Support My Habit\\"?
1401322786|5.0|I planned to start reading this book on a rainy Saturday.  I was so enthralled with the story that I could not put the book down!  I took a break to run an errand before the store closed, came home and finished the book that evening.
B007LB1O3I|5.0|Ok I admit to being a bit biased here as I love Madonna, but I really like every song on this recording. Plenty to dance to in the first half. Among the others, Love Girl Gone Wild and I'm Addicted are a blast to dance to. Some of her writing on this recording is a cathartic release of emotion I'm certain, thanks to the split with Guy Richie. (I Don't Give A and Love Spent are two of these). I'm A Sinner is a fun track that you can't stop singing as you listen. Falling Free gets me feeling a little verklempt when I hear it....seems so heartfelt.<br />Having seen her perform the tracks live on Madonna's MDNA tour recently just reinforced my enjoyment of the whole thing.<br />What a show...can't wait for the DVD to be released next year.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I loved the casting, the originality of the scripts, the interaction between the characters, the plots...it was so entertaining and a perfect movie date...
B008KE3960|5.0|Well designed and very entertaining!  Well thought out and very quick to learn. Great variation of typical castle defense games. I enjoy this one for hours on end.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|I love it - the actors, the location, the premise, the script - it was great!  It gave me a great view of India and the crowds and people...it was enlightening and was the perfect date movie...
B0058VW36U|4.0|I really like this game until the spiders and the sharp pulleys get involved. Then I get easily frustrated. Otherwise, I enjoy the mental challenge of figuring out a geometric solution to feeding the monster the candy.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|In my opinion this game is very fun and can be enjoyed by almost anyone. If you like hidden object games and mystery you will like this game to.
B004RJMUJO|5.0|As fruit is flashing up on the screen, your finger acts as a sword to slice and dice each item. Watch out for the bombs though, because they make the screen explode and end the game. Very cool game.
B004SD5GZ4|2.0|Slow, hangs often, hard to scroll to next page.  If swipe slow, it stays on the same page, if you swipe hard, it moves multiple pages.
B004SBX112|5.0|Love this game, very addicting. It's all about finding the right angle for propelling the little bird so that it crashes at just the right spot, bringing down the shelter for the pigs.
B004DLPXAO|3.0|works as expected, buy and read Amazon books.  Does not open other file formats such as PDF or office docs
B007MNV5WU|3.0|I like the angry birds games, but I didn't like this one as well as some of the others. It's confusing to me. But that's just my preference. The app itself works okay.
B009AP2G26|5.0|Great episode. Great quality - stream was clear, commercials were short.  Will definitely download video to my kindle fire from amazon again!
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|Exceptional story of courage and redemption! Great read! Prayers for th Brown family! I feel like I know them now!
B001KZG99A|4.0|Grittier than Iron Man 2, and not as polished, but still fun. Loud for grandma and junior. We liked it.
B008ULRY78|5.0|The topic says it all. True to its idea, The Raid doesn't have the greatest story ever written, but it works. More importantly, the choreography and actual camera control are both brilliantly done, meaning there's not only great action and fight sequences, but you can actually see them, instead of getting just blurry motions like other movies I could name. I saw this in the theaters just before it got taken out (dubbed films still aren't very popular, but I can't imagine listening to other people's voices now), and I don't regret buying it for an instant, although I do wish Amazon supported streaming to more than just PC and some consoles.<br /><br />If you're looking for a good, modern take on the &#34;kung fu&#34; (martial arts) genre, definitely check this out. Far and away one of the best ever made, much less one of the best in decades.
B000000OU4|5.0|The first time I heard anything off this cd was on the radio....of course it was \\" to the end of the world\\" I only got 3 minutes and I knew there was more to it so I got the album....I feel that all facets of music show glimpses of perfection, evolution and timelessness.....this album demonstrates this.... Being a dj I immediately pick up on the sample of Snap's \\" I got the power\\" (the drum loop ) on \\" to the end of the world...and Metheny's effortless ability to tell a story that allows you to see drew me in.....I appreciate when an artist can use a sample or a loop and make it their own....the loop is slowed down and chopped but it is a beautiful composition.....for those who are resistant to change .... listen to this cd and free your musical mind,,,,,
B007MU85D0|5.0|Just buy this. You won't be sorry!!!!!!!! ps. little talks is my fave Srsly you need more 3 more words?
B007URVZJ6|5.0|This is very concise and on the spot right on for how to format your documents and get them published on Kindle.  It sure helped me.
B0076DCT2G|4.0|I hadn't remembered how many wise cracks J Corey had in past books, but I find it a bit too much. It detracts from the storyline. Also, not enough action... I feel I am on a bad tour of Yemmem with Tony Bourdain, not in a good way!,, Grumpy from Carmel
B001HPP2X2|5.0|I was introduced to this show by my Doctor. Where the hell have I have been for 7 years?  I don't have showtime but I purchased the first season and now I'm hooked. I've caught up to the current season now and I anticipate seeing what the writers come up with next.  Michael Hall is an EXCEPTIONAL actor and he has a great supporting cast. GREAT SHOW! How long will they drag this out?
1439153663|4.0|THE KITCHEN HOUSE is an engaging and informative book.  I didn't want to put it down!  My reason for not giving it a perfect score is that some of the plot turns seem a bit contrived, perhaps a bit unbelievable.  Overall, though, it is a fine read and a great contribution from a first-time author.  I look forward to Grissom's next novel.
B009KHDT0C|3.0|Typical Johnny Depp if you are a fan it's O.K. if your not it's not worth ypur time to se it.
B009S8PEHY|5.0|Quick purchase, immediate download, reasonaable price, quality as well. Without going anywhere, just in pace of my home. Thank you Amazon
B0011Z5IXC|4.0|Lost my copy of LZ4 so got this to replace it plus it includes some greats from other albums.  Lotta Led for a good price.
B0035VFLI2|5.0|Great record! High -energy, sexy, raw, Texas to the bone! He is an icon in the great state of Texas and should be elsewhere too!
B0055SWM08|5.0|Another reviewer called it \\"deceptively simple\\" but I would call it charmingly clever. Quick little games, perfect for waiting in line or at the airport, with a great \\"hook.\\"
B00A12VW86|5.0|Some great songs, maybe one of their best albums.  Love &#34;Amy&#34;, &#34;Nightlife&#34;, &#34;Stray Heart&#34;, among others.  Could be some classics in there.
B0018LX9T4|5.0|Interesting that the boss's last name is Grey. Hmm. Just finished a book with another boss with the same name. This is soft and very subtle. There is nudity but not gross. Like the movie so much I had to simply own it. very sexy!
B007PT3QOQ|2.0|Loved the game but it did not take very long before I had to purchase more energy in order to continue to play the game or wait a long time for more energy to build up.  I am not into purchasing extra anything to play a game.  Unless you want to spend a lot of money I would not recommend getting the game.
B002VECLVO|4.0|This was a good movie although very sad.  Colin Firth's acting was excellent along with Julianne Moore.  Again a sad story.
B000T412OU|5.0|The line, &#34;Get off my plane&#34; - was said at the right time. To think that the weapons on Air Force as written - if they are really there, it could be a disaster.  The pilot and co-pilot did what they had to do, and I would too.  Well written, Harrison Ford is a favorite of mine, and his movies are worth watching.  I want to add this one to my DVD collection.
B004LROMSO|4.0|I enjoyed this series and thought the movie was good.  I'm looking forward to the second part of this series.
B009329ZF2|4.0|This is a must see (or purchase DVD) - this movie is worth watching over and over.  The action keeps you on the edge of your seat, and if you must take a break, be sure to pause - you do not want to miss a minute. I will of course purchase or rent again.
B003PGNBO8|3.0|I gave this a three star.  It was okay but rather far fetched.  The acting was very good but that is all I can really say.
1439108277|5.0|Totally different from what I spected it to be, however ... wonderful!<br />This is a Physics book in fine prose. No equations, few diagrams and photos and a lot of plain, simple and complex, phenomena and their detailed explanations.
B0026IUXO2|4.0|This was a good movie and I enjoyed Cate Blanchett's acting.  Good story and held my interest throughout the movie.
B009VB97EY|3.0|Ok, so let me just start by saying that as I was watching this movie, I did enjoy it. As most everyone has said, the dance scenes were pretty entertaining. When the movie was over, I was like, ok, that was nothing special but not a horrible way to spend an evening. But as I thought about it the next day I realized that the story was actually pretty horrible and not thought out at all. I thought Channing Tatum did a decent enough job with what he had, but his character could have had so much more depth. Both The kid and Matthew McConaughey's characters were one dimensional and pretty terrible. There were a lot of scenes that really didn't add anything to the plot. Sooooo...good for one viewing maybe. Glad I waited for this one to come out on DVD.
B0014Z4OL6|3.0|This movie was okay, anyone that likes a true story would be interested.  The actors gave a good performance but it did not really capture my attention to the end.
B0043OUZW2|5.0|Still enough edge to satisfy my rock tastes. I was initially concerned it might be too youthful for me, but it surprised me with its polish & maturity. I can hear her classic rock influences coming through, yet she keeps it current. Every song is enjoyable, and I especially like the duet with Lacey from Flyleaf. I'm not qualified to determine whether her guitar work is technically excellent or not, but I know it is what she is known for and I still shake my head in wonder every time I listen to it. I highly recommend this album, and for a little less pop check out her &#34;Fire&#34; EP.
B0018RE7DU|3.0|American Gigolo - This was just okay, not one of<br />Gere's best performances.  Got cumbersome at the end of movie.
B004SIP7US|5.0|One of my favorite movies. Blu-ray quality is perfect for both the audio and video. Would highly recommend this film.
B009IJJB8G|4.0|I enjoy series' like this which indicate thought and information, intelligent discourse, and don't rely on slow, obvious spoon-feeding of plot or personality.  Sure, the personalities at work here can be a little extreme, but are at least thought-provoking, and so far not annoyingly soap-opera-y in using absurd, standard emotional manipulation as plot mechanisms.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Once I started this book I couldn't put it down. I read the book within two days. I downloaded book three right away
B009HV2JT8|5.0|This movies was fun and action packed from beginning to end.  This movie was just pure entertainment.  Definitely a movie to watch over and over again.
B0090YHSFC|5.0|Was not expecting much, but this is a really fun and addictive game.  It starts out fairly easy but gets difficult after the first few &#34;worlds&#34; at just the right pace.  Great job!
B008GFI3QE|5.0|If you're the type who reads Beatle books and likes the backstory on all the principle characters, you'll love this biography. Just remember, it's about George Martin, not the Beatles, so there's lots of autobiographical info about his life that has nothing to do with the fab four. Fascinating and interesting to the Beatle nation, probably less so to rest, but why would any of them even be looking at this film?
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is a great app! Keeps me entertained for hours. I've had No problem with this app.  Highly Recommend it!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This tv show is amazing! I watched the first season in or sitting. Finished the second in one week. Now I'm on the third and I've found myself now watching season one again. Reading the books. Memorizing the wiki. It's just that good. I had my doubts when someone told me it was about zombies, after all every zombie movie I've seen was just terrible. There really isn't anything enticing our enjoyable about zombies, but when you throw in incredible acting and a well written script, the show becomes so much more captivating. I hIghly recommend this show. You will not regret it.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|this is the second time I've played it from the beginning and it is one of the best games ever!
B009JZVT70|5.0|Love the concept of the show. Watched the first season on Netflix cause I didn't know about it, but now I love it. Very imaginative and one of a kind. Can't believe now that this had never been done before. Can't wait to see what happens this week! I hate one week breaks from my fave shows!!
B008WCP2PG|3.0|I had never seen Magic Mike and decided to wait for the dvd release. First and foremost, I got most of what I expected- lots of eye candy and performances with no oscar nods. However, i was reading about a deleted scene with Matt Boemer as a Ken doll and hoped that it would be included with the film- not so. I think this film could have had a blast with compiling features along with the movie. What a shame. Matt is worth the extra film time.
1455527475|4.0|A little too much chest pounding about his achievements, but overall entertaining, no real harsh words about GS, just alot of talk about how wall st no longer thinks long term and is focused on the next elephant.
B0016BP0PW|5.0|This is my favorite movie of all time, hands down. I love the beatles and this is such an awesome way to see thier music come to life
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I like the different levels, they are challenging, and I like the layout, it is easy to play on my GS3
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|This is a must have for any Christmas video collection. The animation is superb and the sounds are great with the surround sound system.
B009YX02T8|5.0|This album is definitely a favorite. My favortie is Green Days's Forgotten and Thousand Years Part 2. Good music for the soul.
B009VB97EY|3.0|Yes it's always nice to see some hot men with their shirts off, but overall as a movie it wasn't that great. I personally think it could have been much better quality and made it more interesting when shirts weren't off.
0156027321|5.0|The movie is absolutely wonderful, but this story is too large for just the screen--you must reed this amazing book as well!
B00A12VW86|4.0|Another dose of power pop from Green Day. A lot of good songs, but for me nothing stood out as exceptional. Seemed to be a lot of sameness. On this CD they sound a lot like that Foxboro Hot Tubs band...... oh, wait
B001609SQA|5.0|one of the best sequals in movies of all freakin time. better than the 1st alien. enough said. also if you love alien and aliens check predator out. the 1st predator with arnold shwarzennager and carl weathers was just excellent. the sequal was good but without a doubt not as good as the 1st one. any way aliens was fun bad ass and just a freakin classic one of the all time great movies
B003TSEL7S|5.0|Happy the Percy Jackson series continues .. great new twist and characters, definitely hooked!! Can't wait to find out more of the other camp
B0063GORYU|4.0|no distracting ads. variable backgrounds. smooth action. launches smoothly. i am enjoying playing very much. best of the spider games i have tried.

B007HC3LHS|5.0|I enjoyed this book , had alot of twists that I was not expecting. i will read more from Elizabeth Haynes.
B00A12VW86|5.0|Picks up where UNO left off. Lots of power pop type songs. Baby Eyes could have been written by the Misfits.
B009VA1FN6|5.0|The best Kate Morton so far. Lots of twists and turns. Compelling right to the end. I highly recommend it.
0385344333|5.0|Lee Child is another of my favorite writters. I have read all his books. I enjoyed it very much. His books are so fast reading, they are like a good dessert.
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|It was way too short! For us D.A. fans, we want more as we can barely wait until January! But I enjoyed watching it for free.
0399157565|5.0|I liked this book but was confused by the title. It wasn't until near the end I finally figured out why it had that title. I enjoyed the book but it should have a different title. It had very little to do with a bone bed. It was good any old way as all her books are. She is very percise in all details. Very enjoyable read.
B005RAO0GS|5.0|I recently attended this concert in L.A.. She is a phenomenal performer. She kept bouncing around the stage like a gazelle. I kept wondering how she got that height in heals! The energy she brought was amazing. I especially like the song Spectrum, the chorus goes &#34;say my name&#34; and you feel it. I wanted to run out of the auditorium and shout to the night sky &#34;say my name!&#34; Very inspirational;)
B009GEAPYW|4.0|It has been many years since I read The Dark Knight Returns, but from what I remember this is a faithful adaption of Miller's work.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|This book felt rushed.  I wanted more when reading.  Long gaps between story lines.<br />Hope got read more from this author.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|great story that kept me well entertained for most of the day. game is long but not tedious. some items. are small but you can enlarge the picture. great buy!!
B007TK77QE|4.0|Very small townish - not sure we have towns quite like this in Australia. I had to keep going back to check on the characcters.
B004L0NGEC|5.0|Very versatile.  No bugs.  Good job on this one. I would recommend to anyone with picasa web albums.  Easy to use.  Lots of features.

B000FC130E|5.0|Loved this facinating book about a child who is adopted by graveyard souls and lives his childhood out on the edge of both the living and the dead.  His adventures are exciting and original, it may expand your imagination; what could be better?!
B008Y5OW20|5.0|Very good come back of great master.I liked evrething what he did before.I'm also waiting for the new releases.Long live Jeff Lynne and ELO.
B008GXHOFW|5.0|this game is awesome!  my 5 year old and i both love to play it.  Fun for the whole family.
B0098VYCCE|1.0|This movie is dumb and childish.  I realize it is a children's story supposedly but I would take the Disney cartoon when it comes to maturity and intelligence over this film although that's not saying this as I find animated films superior to many live action films.  If you want to see a great re-telling of that story check out Mirror Mirror with Julia Roberts as the evil Queen.  Now that's a great re telling!

B009KHDT0C|5.0|The original show was a very mundane show.  It took Willy Lomas three days to get Barnabus Collins out of his coffin and another episode to introduce the character.  People talk about Spencer Tracy, Cary Grant, Dustin Hoffman, Tom Hanks, Al Pacino, or Robert Dinero, Peter Sellers as possibilities for the best actor of all time without considering Johnny Depp, and for him not to be on that list because he hasn't been around forever is just nuts.  That movie is so funny and great because he never gets out of character.  This is a movie I will definitely watch more than once.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Is the best porn romantic novel I ce ever read in my life<br />The size of the text is comfortable
B0090EIILU|3.0|It is funny but more of the typical very rehearsed crap than the fresh and unique Bruno and Borat.  I agree he should compensate his unwilling performers more sometimes, but without looking at the moral issues those movies are far more humorous, engaging and entertaining than this movie that seems to the formula comedy.  I don't like reality tv either as I find that mundane as well, but Cohen has a way of mixing reality with his story in funny and smart ways.  I don't mind that The Dictator should not have been scripted, just less formulaic.  It is definitely worth a watch but everybody also owes it to themselves to watch the original Dictator by Chaplin just to see how the films very.  Remakes like these are especially great because of they are such reflections of the times and these to films are hot button topics.  The other thing to watch for is the ending with the varying monologues and there solutions.  They are both honest and heartfelt but very different approaches.  Charlie Chaplin's version I suspect was very influential in the making of future Mel Brooks movies.  I could pass that film off as a Mel Brooks movie to the typical idiot that has never watched a movie before 1970 or 1980.  There's probably morons that never seen a movie in the 1900s, I'm sure I could make them think they are watching a Brook's film like Young Frankenstein.

B0096PAA6E|4.0|The Texas city has a long history of producing critically acclaimed musicians- be it by way of the music festival South By Southwest or the natives that were born and raised there. Carrying on that city's musical legacy is the guitarist Gary Clark Jr.- a musician who was respected by some of the greatest in blues rock. In his short time, he performed alongside artists as diverse as Sheryl Crow, John Mayer, B.B. King, Eric Clapton and Steve Winwood- to name a few. As a recording artist, he released two studio albums and one EP on his own label Hotwire Unlimited Recordings. After all of the acclaim bestowed upon him, it was only a matter of time before the major labels began calling. He signed with Warner Bros. Records and released two more EP's before he went to record his debut for a major label. In October 2012, Gary finally released his album \\"Blak And Blu\\".<br /><br />Joining him for the production of the album is Dr. Dre session musician Mike Elizondo (Fiona Apple, Switchfoot) and Rob Cavallo (Goo Goo Dolls, Green Day). Those expecting him to make a straight ahead blues rock album will be in a bit of a shock. He does blues rock, as well as pop music, R&B and even arena rock. The album starts off with the radio ready \\"Ain't Messin' Around\\", which leads into the nearly eight minute \\"When My Train Pulls In\\". The title track \\"Blak And Blu\\" shows Gary showing vulnerability with an understated John Legend influence. He sings about his life as a stage performer on the first single \\"Bright Lights\\" and wishes to change his life on the noticeably poppy \\"The Life\\". He recalls the sound of Memphis soul on the song \\"Things Are Changin'\\" and channels Marvin Gaye on the ballad \\"Please Come Home\\". Being that he's often compared to Jimi Hendrix, he does a cover of \\"Third Stone From The Sun\\" which leads into another cover- Little Johnny Taylor's \\"If You Love Me Like You Say\\". The ballad \\"You Saved Me\\" sounds like early era Prince, while the album ends with the Delta Blues influenced \\"Next Door Neighbor Blues\\". Gary Clark Jr.'s \\"Blak And Blu\\" is a good debut from the singer-songwriter. He may lose a few with the genre bending nature of his album, but he's only doing what's natural to him. In the end, that's all that matters.ced \\"Next Door Neighbor Blues\\". Gary Clark Jr.'s \\"Blak And Blu\\" is a good debut from the singer-songwriter.

B009E3EY38|3.0|Ok, it is Led Zeppelin.... BUT, if I were to sit down with my kids and tell them they are about to watch the greatest rock band ever, they would laugh me out of the room before the first hour was over. First off, the audio is not right nor is the video that great for a Blu-Ray disc. Second, it seemed that the group was trying to provide a 70's type concert experience 40 years too late (Dazed and Confused.... really???.... they might have flashed up on the screen that mass amounts of drugs are required to enjoy this song.... if only they had played Moby Dick next). Somehow they did pull off Stairway to Heaven.... although barely (who needs to hear this song for the 10,000 time).<br /><br />I now know why it took so long for this disk to come out and why Robert Plant declined to do any more touring with the group. Everyone would be much better off watching Robert Plant and the Band of Joy Blu-Ray disc. Maybe some things are better left to the past.
B0041KVW2K|2.0|I'm not sure that there are enough adequate words to describe my frustration, anger and disappointment about this set. When I first heard about this reissue campaign, this became a must buy set and I waited with much anticipation for it's release. After reading numerous reviews on a trusted message board I decided to stay away from the box set and pick up a few individual titles. Out of the three I got, only one had issues! (yay!) Yesterday, however, my daughters gave me the box for my birthday. Well, in hopes that my set would be a good one, I opened it up. I have to say that the box and book are both very nice but that's not why we get this set, is it? I started playing it last night, beginning with PPM. Most of you are aware of that disgusted feeling that comes over you as the issues begin mounting. Here are the \\"highlights\\"...<br /><br />Beatles for Sale - several loud pops on both \\"Baby's In Black\\", \\"Rock and Roll Music\\" and \\"Kansas City\\". Same pops on Side 2 on two tracks.<br />Help - no fill issues and visual stitching on the disc, at times it sounds like somebody is farting in the right channel<br />Revolver- has a small chunk missing from the run in groove, looks like a mini pac man decided to take a bite out of it<br />White Album- a few small bits of no fill and a skip during \\"Mother Nature's Son\\"<br />Abbey Road- Side 2 is ruined with a semi-constant static-scratching sound<br /><br />I could go on but that's enough to illustrate the shoddy quality that abounds with these titles. Now, I'm a bit of a music freak and buy hundreds of LP's a year so I understand that there will be issues from time to time. It's hard to quantify but being generous, I'd say that out of every 100 records I buy, maybe 1 (at tops 2) have an issue. That's about 1-1.5% of records I buy that need to be exchanged. These reissues have a much, much, much higher percentage of defects and that is unacceptable. How does something like this happen? It's only the greatest band ever and themost highly valued music recordings of all time! Surely, something as revered as The Beatles' musical canon deserves a more critical eye towards quality control, right? Some of these look and sound like the records that were in my collection when I was about 9 years old after a year or two playing them on my Fisher Price record player. Unacceptable. Also, these aren't priced as budget releases. They are asking a premium price for THIS product. Unacceptable.<br /><br />In fairness, the sound on the discs that have little to no issues sound and outstanding. Warm and open. Very dynamic Beatles vinyl experience. I've got the blue box set and to my ears the new vinyl remasters slightly outclass them in sound (tho I know this is a hotly debated topic). So it's not the music on the discs, it's the way that these were manufactured-pressed.<br /><br />Best of luck to those that have the perseverance to keep mixing and matching trying to put together a good set. I can't do it. I'm too pissed that I should even have to try to do that. Paying $300+ dollars to then send stuff back and forth numerous times is preposterous. Unacceptable. I'm now awaiting the Mono Box release but my expectations are greatly lowered and the anticipation quelled. This whole debacle is an outrage and I want it fixed. We and The Beatles deserved so much better than<br />this.<br /><br />*** UPDATE *** 12-22-12<br /><br />I'm still in shock to read that folks got perfect sets. Quiet pressings with no snap, crackle and pop were a distinct minority in my set and I admit that I was very envious of those who had them. I digress...<br /><br />After a frustrating couple of weeks I decided to contact EMI-Capitol directly to tell them about my experience, my disappointment and to itemize the almost unbelievable amount of issues I encountered with these LP's. I mostly did it to vent, to make those ultimately responsible aware of my frustration and anger. I honestly didn't expect a response but a few days later Igot one. Granted, it was automated (meaning there must have been enough of us venting to generate a mass response) but it indicated that EMI-Capitol were willing to try and make things right.<br /><br />Tho' I had already listed the issues, in detail, that I had with each defective record, I did as they asked and emailed another itemized list, proof of purchase, address, etc. It took a little while but I finally received a response stating that I had provided enough info and that they would be sending me replacement copies in two to four weeks. I'm still awaiting their arrival but I have to give EMI-Capitol a little love for being willing to tackle what must be a huge headache and logistical nightmare to make things right. That feeling of being fleeced is gone (for now) so thanks EMI!<br /><br />Once I receive my ten (10!) replacement copies, I'll listen and review accordingly. I really want to be happy with this as it's been something I've looked forward to having since it was first announced. To those still encountering issues, my condolences. I hope it works out for you.<br /><br />**Update 1-3-12**<br /><br />Kind of an odd story here but it's the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth.<br /><br />A box showed up on my doorstep on 12-28. In the box were 7 of the replacement LP's that EMI told me would be coming. There were supposed to be 10 replacements but the box was missing The White Album, Past Masters and Abbey Road. I contacted EMI again and told them what happened, included the shipping number and the shipping clerks name. They got back to me and said that there was a mistake made as I was supposed to receive all of my replacements in one shipment. They said they were going to take my receipt number and other info I provided and try to figure out how and why the mistake was made. So, I am still awaiting those three.<br /><br />The seven they sent me were all good copies. Much, much better than the noise filled, cosmetically damaged ones I originally got. So, here's the rub.... The clean copies sound wonderful. Warm, open and immediate. Sound quality is a hotly debated topic and many will disagree but this is the best sounding Beatles vinyl experience I've had (and I've had more than the average bloke). Comparing them to some of my late 60's-early 70's UK Parlophone pressings, some Japanese reissues, some Germans reissues, the DMM reissues, the BC13 box and some MOFI titles (Capitol doesn't really count), these are my preferred copies. I'm hearing them from a new perspective. The early Beatles stuff suffered from a lack of bottom end and Ringo's bass drum was buried but on these you can hear them driving the tracks. Shoot, I'm hearing echoes that must be on the master tapes, caused by the numerous overdubs eroding the tape. It's like I'm a kid again hearing some of this again. So, tread carefully. Make sure that you can replace defective copies and then don't be afraid to try them out. ONCE you get a good pressing then I think you will enjoy them. Good luck
B009ZAY8MM|5.0|i love pentatonix they are so talented. I would buy their music any day. And it was real easy to download.
B004FP1WX0|5.0|VERY WELL DONE. I watched this documentary because it precedes the tv show Catfish. I thought it was very well done and enjoyed watching the events unfold.
B0076DCT2G|4.0|A little light but entertaining. Similar to his other book. I don't find his action realistic. Would like to see him return to his original genre.
B002BWCJOA|4.0|This was a wonderful movie that my 12-year-old son really enjoyed. He felt that it could have been better if it were longer like the book. :)
B00005JN8Z|5.0|THIS DVD HAS A VERY GOOD PRICE.  IT WAS SENT TO ME VERY QUICKLY.  I RECEIVED IT BEFORE THE EXPECTED TIME.  GOOD  WORK.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I &#60;3 solitaire! While my kids & grandkids are on their Ipads, I play solitaire on my brand new KIndlefire!
B00AA7O22U|4.0|Hokey plot, but fun to see the &#34;old&#34; actors reviving their past characters. Done without need for gross images or language.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|loved it! I was laid up for a week and watched the whole thiing- perfect way to keep me sitting down and intrigued.
B006M4F67A|4.0|I found this game to be challenging and the different patterns keep it fresh. I found myself addicted to the game.
B007ZZ3RI0|5.0|Trespassing is one of those rare albums that you can listen to in its entirety and enjoy almost every single song. Not only was I mesmerized by the intoxicating way this album drew me in with its alluring beats and melodic tunes, but Adam's voice is simply phenomenal. He definitely showcases his stellar singing capabilities in more than a few titles. Since Trespassing offers various ranges from slow ballad types to edgy and funky pop selections, I believe this album will complement the tastes of and appeal to a large audience. Not only is Adam an incredible and brilliant singer, but he offers a distinct sound that isn't showcased very often in our current music industry.<br /><br />As a fan of Adam Lambert since his American Idol days, I was definitely not disappointed with this album. Well pleased!
B008JGSM6G|3.0|great fun and makes you think.  but hints should be free rather than buying more.  come on -- if the game is free but you have to buy some of the parts it really isn't free!
B001QB5S3G|5.0|This is a classic! Beautiful music, great actors, great story. I even bought the soundtrack, I think it is a master piece.
0316187216|3.0|I read all of Joe Abercrombie's books. I started with Heroes and then read The First Law trilogy.  First Law was better, but all were great reads. The characters fit the \\"universe\\" and had complexity and qualities that made it possible to be concerned about them. It's altogether different for Red Country except maybe for Shy and Temple. However the story lagged and was just too much brutality for its own sake. The plot was thin and I didn't like the ending either.  Another one like this and I'll stop reading Abercrombie.
B009E3EY38|2.0|Just got the new Led Zepplin Live show on Blu-Ray. The concert must have been great, but the guy who did the Video editing must have been high as a kite. and the Guy that recorded Jimmy Page guitar work must have been tone deaf and has no idea how to use an EQ. May be I got a bad copy if you disagree please message me.[[ASIN:B009E3EY38 Celebration Day (Deluxe Edition 2CD, 1 Blu-Ray, 1 DVD (CD sized digipak)]]
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|I don't and never have played video games, but still found this book to be thoroughly engrossing and couldn't wait to get back to it. It's a great blend of humor, action and science fiction. A great story, well told.
B008XG1X18|3.0|i got this app and was really excited. it was doing really good but i tried to do something and now it is curently loading. it has been for a half hour now!
B001FVV2X2|5.0|It's rare that I get hooked on a old TV show but this one has me gripped. I recommend this show to any scifi fan.
B003QSS2VW|5.0|My family loves this classic Disney film. I wondered how my children would like it as it's an older film, but they loved it and were signing the songs for days!
B009Y2KGSQ|5.0|5-Stars are only the beginning.  Each track takes you through a musical trip that reminds you of the past but with so many new twists it becomes new and fresh.  Take a tour and enjoy this one.
B00A6PD9I4|2.0|I was very disappointed with this movie, I felt it was a little to dark for a kid movie and wasn't good for young chldren.
B006JD48NM|5.0|Senna once said..<br />\\"Racing competing is in my blood\\"<br /><br />This man is a legend, an icon and a hero for Brazil and fans around the world, they said he was a man possessed on the race track but man that helped unprivileged kids with his foundation, a great documentary !!
B004X75RK4|5.0|reat Romantic Comedy. I have seen this movie many times and laugh so hard still. I highly recommend this one!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|The book is great if you like stories that you do not figure out in the first few pages now.<br />Twist and turns and you would never guess where it's going.<br />Pure delight.
142314189X|5.0|I don't need to tell you that this series by Rick Riordan is phenomenal. It's common knowledge by now. But purchasing the boxed set is much, MUCH better in the long run than each individually. The box keeps the books well sorted when not in use, and since these books are so amazing and compelling, you won't have them in there too much. For those of you who have not experienced the magic Percy Jackson is willing to share with you, imagine Greek Mythology. In New York. In modern day. That's all you need to know; and you'll be hooked. This book is great for fans of J.K Rowling's famous Harry Potter books and Christopher Paolini's Eragon. The age this book is for is probably 4th through 7th grade, but anyone can really enjoy the novels. The set includes hardcover books-much more durable for a longer period of time. The paperback books tend to bend at the spine and become white. The hardcover boxed set is a great purchase for those of you willing to try the series out (you won't be disappointed) and even better for those of you who have already become Half-Bloods like the most of us.
B0086700CM|5.0|one if the best games I've ever played really addictive its crashed one and some sometimes glitches if you've been on it for a while.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|Great totally worth it amazing book taught me. many words and still helps me when I'm clue less you should get it
B008JGSM6G|4.0|This app is great because it makes you think ahead about how the whole puzzle has to fit together. It's challenging enough to be fun without becoming frustratingly difficult. I enjoy it as kind of a brain teaser during down-time.
B009GEBBNQ|2.0|Boring movie, terrible plot, slow and plodding, and silly special effects, such as the flying aircraft carrier. If you're really into the Avengers universe or Marvel comics you may enjoy, otherwise skip it.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this story.  John Grisham has returned to his style made famous by The Firm and The Pelican Brief.
B0063IH60K|4.0|i don't care for the scoring options, i'd like to see vegas-style scoring, but solitaire, as always, is addicting.  not a bad choice, just could use more oomph.
B0036BK6MW|4.0|I really liked the movie. My only gripe was it took to long to download and therefore had a short time to watch. I did receive this as a warning but seriously took too long to download to my tivo.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|Not being a gamer, I always heard what a fun game Angry Birds is, so thought I'd try it.  The game loaded and works OK, is a bit annoying, but after a while is OK.  Here's the problem.  When the game comes up on my Kindle Fire, it loads 'upside down' as opposed to everything else.  Have tried all the 'tricks' (swiping the screen, etc), but I have to rotate the Kindle 180 degrees to play Birds.  Then, when finished, rotate back around for everything else.  So, at this point, it gets 4 stars.  Any help on the rotation business, out there??
B005I6EU7U|5.0|I love this product! The kindle fire fits it perfectly and it protects it as well. People always assume t is a book. :)
B00A12VW86|5.0|Uno was good, this is great! Looking forward to Tre. This is a party album. Definitely pick this one up.
B009NQKPUW|4.0|I was very disappointed with this film. Until the last minute of the movie did I realize everything....So although I was not enjoying this film...it was only until the last minute did I realize Ridley's intention. Must see for all those Alien fans!
B00992CF6W|4.0|good but a lot of money the game is really good but cost a lot of money I mean 7 dollars. really?
B009RI4372|5.0|This movie is about terror but in a way the author intended to make it a bit about humor. So if you like terror but are just looking for a few laughs you should watch this movie.
B009VSW15Y|4.0|I downloaded it and was immediately up and running.  It is very simple to use.  I did feel it should have come with the kindle, but it was cheap enough to buy.
B009RI4FRU|1.0|The actors are good? but the scenes are quite boring. The music is boring, 90% of the scenes are boring quite unreal and stupid.
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|What a treat to hear a clear and full voice sing these songs--some of my favorites from Broadway. Boy, does she do them justice! Susan seems to sing with the greatest ease, always with perfect pitch and control of an incredible range. She effortlessly turns these out while really putting her whole self into the music, giving us an interpretation that suits her mood as she sings moving from one octave to another, taking us with her, surprising the listener over and over again.<br /><br />It is hard to believe that this is the same Susan Boyle that once appeared on \\"Britain's Got Talent\\" hoping that she might someday be a professional singer.<br /><br />What a blessing it is to see her succeed--for her--and for us who will profit greatly from her success.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|love the game and the sounds. am I the only one who hears bubbles? bunches of colors. hi hi hi.
B0099G7KDQ|5.0|I like their sound and the unique vibe they provide.<br /><br />If you want to experience something different,<br /><br />Give them a try.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|I have it on my computer and now my phone so I can take it with me where ever I go
B001GJ3BR8|5.0|Everyone should see this movie. Great inspirational journey. Get!!! Great cast. Young people sould see tbis to learn it is possible to overcome anything.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This show is so well written with every episode twisting and weaving dialogue, drama and action. Every leaving us hanging from a cliff. Can't get enough.
B000VNMMQG|5.0|Wilberforce was great man. His deep hatred for slavery strikes a chord within men as very similar to how I feel about the horror of abortion. Wilberforce's horror over slavery is only matched by his love for God. Its touching to see how he draws close to God and finally gives in to Him in the early part of the film. I have bought more than 1/2 a dozen of these dvd's as gifts
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this game consists of so many games that you'll run out of points before you can play all the games!!! this game us great for kids.
B009GEEMLY|3.0|Only thing interesting in this movie is the action, but it soon becomes tedious..A movie should have action to compliment the plot, no a weak plot to add to the action.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|History with a therapeutic flare. More real than all of modern fiction. Her majesty held respect in the empire and showed postal profits.
B00004S6GL|4.0|I love Elliot Smith but I think Figure 8 isn't as good as &#34;XO&#34; or his final album: &#34;From a basement on a hill&#34; moody, emotional and deep lyrical these other albums are better in my opinion than this dream works produced theatrical hyped up production. When listening to a guy like elliot it's better not to be overly produced and have to deal with all the big noise coming from all these orchestral induced hollywoodish big band sounds that drown out something that should be kept simple and plane.
0553579908|3.0|after the first chapter i was interested to read more but ive found this so far very tedious except for the Tyrion  hope the next book is better reading these b4 watching the tv series where at least they can cut half of this tedium out:)
B0007MWZEK|5.0|My name is Donna David.  I received a message from Swivel Sweeper that I had made a derogatory comment concerning the Swivel Sweeper product.  Although this was an error on my part, I feel that I should set the record straight.  I love Swivel Sweeper.  This is the 2nd one I have purchased in the last 6 or 7 years.  My son loved my first one so much he took it home to &#34;try out&#34; the sweeper at his house and never returned it.  So now I have my second one.  Also, I must say that not only is the product wonderful but I was very pleased with the low shipping cost.  If you have declined to buy a Swivel Sweeper due to an erroneous error on my part, please go back and take a second look.  It is worth the time and the price.  I believe you will enjoy yours as much as I have and do enjoy mine.  Thankyou for taking the time to read this review.
B0043WDK2G|4.0|only on episode 18 and so far so good wish they would get it together them two drives me nuts but then, there would be no where else to go err, see season 5 however be swet to see that first kiss oh lala..lol
B00A6PD8RQ|3.0|My daughter loves it, but she also loves Barbie movies.  It is weak compared to other Disney films.  It was like the thing was written by the marketing dept to hit a release schedule.<br /><br />Update April 2013 - This is one of her least watched Disney movies.  In fact other than the first week we had it, I do not think she has watched it again.
B005FFW46S|5.0|I enjoyed ever page. I can only say at time forget that word is round . Commander Sam is true. Cop
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|Very good movie.  The theme of the movie is disturbing, but very moving.  I am looking forward to the next three films.
B009CPJHY4|3.0|You will want to watch this just to see the fabulous cast.  They are the best. The script is weak though and would have had easy fixes. So who edited this thing?  Some scenarios just weren't necessary, i.e. the guy finding the local British gal for a late in life connection. Really, in love just like that? Just not realistic.  But the acting was superb!
B002WJI63A|5.0|I buy these all the time from different local stores and they normally only stay together a month or so.  These have lasted almost three months and still don't show any signs of of tearing or falling apart.
B009H442DG|1.0|John Travolta does not sing! He just kind of talks the songs. They could have picked better songs for the cb.
0446580848|5.0|Kept me interested.. not boring - yes, I would definately recomment it to my friends and family.  I seem to favor Nelson DeMille's books
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|A good time waster game and regenerates coins quickly.  I reccomend GameCircus games if you like these sort of games.5stars
B004P4S4NM|5.0|I ordered and received Adele 21 and was more than amazed.<br />The songs were so groovy :-)<br /> I would definately recoment it to friends and family.<br />Loved the bonus songs even better
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I haven't received my copy yet but based on the first two seasons, I can't wait.  When will I receive it??
0525953728|4.0|I learned a lot..  not sure if it's true or not.<br />yes i would recommend. It repeted a lot of things.
B001VIMCW4|5.0|Great Bond movie! Daniel Craig is awesome. If you like Casino Royale, you will love this movie as well.<br /><br />Enjoyed it!
B004RGHWIQ|5.0|With an endless number of versions available, I had a really hard time deciding upon which would be most compatible with my Sony HX series 3D TV and active shutter 3D glasses (also using a Sony 3D Blu-Ray Player).<br /><br />After much research & debate, I purchased the region free 3D version, which had no comparability issues. The picture quality & 3D are amazing - better than it looked in the theater. The lower price for this import version made it a complete no-brainer (kind if like the Alien Anthology region-free Blu-Ray set). Great movie, great price. Recommended!
B009HV2JT8|3.0|We preferred the book to the movie. Lots of graphic violence in the movie which isn't necessarily bad, but leaves nothing to the imagination. Ending was too campy.
B0079J28NW|5.0|Must have for any Beatles fan.  Significant step up from the picture quality of the DVD.<br /><br />I was a bit apprehensive when reading that the audio had been remixed, but truth be told, it sounds FANTASTIC.  Dialog is much easier to understand and the music sounds terrific.  The booklet, animation cells and stickers were a nice touch too.  I would recommend picking this one up without any hesitation!
B009K0P10K|5.0|I love this show, and love the characters. Not sure if I would give a 5/5 to the new &#34;commercials&#34; with surprise boxes (Target & Neiman Marcus??), they take-away from the show, I think. I was upset there was no episode shown due to the music awards!! I am having withdrawal symptoms.... Can't wait for next week's episode. In my opinion, there should be two episodes, back to back, to make up for our &#34;void&#34; from last week!!!
B001IBIHQ4|5.0|The Pacific Movie<br /><br />Great for my husband, who enjoys this type of movies.  Great service and in great condition.  Would recomment to others.
B009WJ44KC|4.0|A marvelous work, evocative even in its understatement, buoyed by plenty of intimate solo performances. Most of Williams' Americana techniques are evident, but in spite of such familiarity the work is expertly executed and impressively cohesive. One of the year's finest scores.
B001VIMCW4|5.0|Really Loved it.I wanted to watch it before I went to see the new movie.<br />I recommend this to everyone.
B009WJ2XT6|3.0|While this score is a good match for its film and is blessed with some rather enjoyable action material, its lack of a strong thematic core also makes it somewhat anonymous. I like it, but with each listen I keep wishing the title song melody was more intertwined with the material. Good, but likely weaker than what David Arnold could have accomplished for the film.
B008Z9YLV2|4.0|The Hunger Games<br />I enjoyed this movie. my internet conection was slow so I had to watch it in low quality but the movie was good anyway.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Extremely entertaining...page turner! Will not be dissapointed... I loved it...have read it three times already, probably will go for a fourth time.
B009NQKPUW|3.0|Prometheus<br />My internet conection is slow here so I had to watch it in low quality but I still enjoyed the movie. it was hard to follow in places but the overall story line was clear.
B002LMV7TS|5.0|good price and shipped quickly.kids loved the movie and the grinch.would easily recommend this movie.jim carrey is very funny.blu-ray is great.
B00447L4KA|5.0|My Daughter ask for this dvd to watch. No one had it locally. I tried Amazon sure enough they have it. Along with 2 other dvd's my daughter wanted. Thanks Amazon you saved me.
B00992CF6W|3.0|I think minecraft is awesome and I love it but when ever I watch movies on my kindle black pixels keep popping up on my kindle and that never happened before I got minecraft. uninstall or not...
B009FZHYKU|5.0|We love this show.  We do not have cable so it is very convenient to purchase it episode by episode.
B008ASLK8A|5.0|While I prefer a more realistic version of Sherlock Holmes, this movie was good enough to keep my attention through to the end. And the end was good ,but not quite what I expected( I just will not spoil it for you) Most of the action is believable though some 'supernatural' events do put speed bumps in the story-line ,for me. I bought this for my Niece ,for CHRISTmas and got the BONUS of being able to watch it on-line for myself. Quite a good DUAL GIFT. If mystery,action,adventure,and general stuff blowing up will interest you...you will also enjoy this movie.
B009RI4FRU|4.0|One of my favorite movies in years. Wes Anderson's magical thinking is unapologetically on display here, but the most remarkable thing about this movie is how deeply it understands the experience of being 12, and combines both a child's and an adult's understanding. As for the product, I was a little disappointed with how few extras there were on the disc and not much printed material. The fact that it shows up with a zillion formats is interesting but mainly useful for people who want to play it at home, in the car, on the iPad, and on the computer all at once (meaning, I suppose, lots of kids) and that's not my situation. So even though I love the film it's a little hard to justify $25 without more extras.
B002ZDOXM6|5.0|This CD was exactly as advertised and needed. I had looked other places but could not find this CD anywhere else.
B008Z9YGEE|4.0|This was an entertaining movie. I gave it a four because I thought the ending was lacking but not disappointing.
B006M4RN3U|5.0|And the energy of the band caught my attention. The electronic sounds referred to by other reviewers is so minimal that I hardly notice it. Crisp, clean production style. Makes me want to see them live.
B006HL9G10|5.0|I like the set it and forget it timer.  I also enjoy the connection to others on the internet.  The different sound options is good too!
B00A7ZWUJC|5.0|Not much of a Rihanna fan, but this album has quite a blend of different styles. This album is very good!
1933952806|5.0|The Nikonians website is one of the most useful on the net and this book, from a long time Nikonians member, is very well done. I especially appreciate the very comprehensive index and Mr. Young's tips and conclusions at the end of each section. And lest you think this book preaches the Nikon bible, the author is not afraid to criticize the camera when criticism is warranted. (Like the Scene mode...I still can't remember how to access it but then I've been using SLRs for over 40 years and don't need it. How the heck is a new used supposed to use this mode?!)<br /><br />Well done. . . .!
B005LAIHZY|4.0|Strong women, and men, and no sappy un-realistic love story to muck it up!I want a cauldron answering system. Gingers rule!
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is sooo fun its addictive I love it and recommend it to anyone of any age.I love it and you will too!
B009A3NGF4|5.0|A very good collection. Fifteen songs of pure enjoyment! A great addition to my music collection. A must for all Mumford and Sons fans!
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|I haven't had a chance to watch season 1 yet, however season 2 is amazing. Some parts have been predictable, but it keeps you guessing every step of the way!
B007MDB6L0|5.0|My daughter's and my favorite movie yet!!  Got it exactly when I was told!  Wonder movie for kids of all ages.
0062082353|5.0|Chris Kyle is the real deal.  He has killed many bad guys and the world is better for it.  I love his saying about violence solving problems.  This is a great book and Kyle is a first rate guy.
1589946634|4.0|In Space Hulk: Death Angel, a group of super-human Space Marines in powerful Terminator armor have been sent to investigate a mysterious spaceship infested with an alien species known as Tyranids. The Terminators are forced to face down a ferocious, sharp-clawed group of Tyranids known as Genestealers, which slash at their throats and can easily carve through their armor. Death Angel is a suspense filled card game adaptation of the original Space Hulk board game, set in the popular Warhammer 40,000 universe.<br /><br />I don't have a gaming group, per-say, but fairly regularly, I'll get together with a group of pals to play a game, usually Munchkin. Growing weary of the backstabbing so common to that game and also looking for a solo game to play in lieu of video games, I decided to pick up Death Angel, as I've been an on-and-off fan of Warhammer 40,000 for years. Unlike Space Hulk the Board Game, or the 40K tabletop wargame, all players work cooperatively against the Tyranids rather than on different sides.<br /><br />Death Angel is very difficult. The game is tactical in nature and careful planning is required to execute a turn properly. Yet, your plans can easily go awry with a poor dice roll. The rulebook is fairly difficult to understand and poorly organized--I would recommend watching some videos on YouTube to get more acquainted with the rules, but I'll provide a brief, undetailed overview here. The rules at first seem overwhelming, but after deciphering the myriad of symbols, colors, and numbers, it's actually really quite simple.<br /><br />The marines are set up in a single-file line to represent a narrow corridor. On either side of them are terrain cards--spawning points for the Tyranids differentiated by color. At the top of this line is a room card--an overview of the special features in this area. On either side of this room card are \\"blip piles\\"--the maximum number of Tyranids that can be spawned in this room.<br /><br />There are twelve marines total, divided in teams of two. The game can be played with a maximum of six players, with each player taking control of one team. For fewer players, either not all marines will be used, or each player will be in control of more than one team. These teams, organized by color, each have three action cards associated with them--\\"Attack,\\" \\"Move and Activate,\\" and \\"Support.\\" An attack card can be used to, well, attack a Tyranid swarm. Move and activate can be used to move your marines up in line, turn them around, or activate a specific terrain card. Support can be used to place a support token on any marine, which allows them to re-roll a failure in combat. Each team also has special abilities associated specifically with their actions.<br /><br />Choosing an action for your team is how the turn begins. The tricky part? You cannot choose the same action twice in a row. For example, if Red Team \\"attacked\\" the previous turn, they cannot attack again this turn. Each action card has a number in the top left corner that indicates the order in which all of the actions will be completed. Players are not supposed to reveal their cards to each other when discussing the actions they will take, but we broke that rule fairly quickly and had loads of fun discussing all of our tactical options.<br /><br />After resolving the actions for each team, the 'nids attack. You must roll higher than the number of 'nids in the swarm attacking you to defeat them. Sometimes, this becomes literally impossible, as the included die only goes up to five, and swarms can become absolutely massive. If you roll the wrong number...your marine dies. The turn ends by drawing an event card--this determines the actions for the next round, including Tyranid movement, spawning, and marine penalties or, sometimes, bonuses. When one of the two blip piles has been eliminated, the marines move to the next room. All spawned Tyranids follow you. If the assignment for the final room is accomplished, the game has been won.<br /><br />My group was excited by the game and was eager to press forward after initial failure. When we finally won, we literally jumped and shouted with exclamations of triumph. We felt like we had actually accomplished something by winning the game. But, the game's difficulty severely harms replayability once the marines have finally achieved victory. I imagine the same feeling would occur were the marines to lose over and over again. Though it's great fun, especially with a group, there's not much motivation to go through the tense, heart-pounding ordeal again after you've managed to thrash the Tyranids once. While I have solo'd the game since we won as a group, no one has asked to play cooperatively since then.<br /><br />My group was excited by the game and was eager to press forward after initial failure.

B008XG1X18|5.0|Love this app! I actually prefer the mobile app over the full website. It runs a lot faster than the full site most days.
B007UXTG8M|4.0|Movie was great. Michael Fassbender's 2nd best drama next to Hunger (another Steve McQueen film). The film moved quickly and to the point, explaining sex-addiction accurately while incorporating other factors that can contribute to the anxieties and stresses that they cope with.
B0046B1KHG|5.0|My 3 year old loves it as does my wife and I.  There is comedy for everyone in the family to enjoy.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|Awesome movie. If you like action heros and super hero movies then this is the movie to watch. I loved how they brought each character in staying true to the movies/character they represented, brought new characters and molded a well written and well acted story, the visual effects were just icing on the cake. Greta movie!!!

B006M7JCC2|4.0|I am not sure of this adventure.  I liked reading it but not sure if I agree with it.  I will have to read it again.
B009KHDT0C|4.0|loved it campy but sly isn't requiring twenty more words is foolish it's a quick review not a critique, really?
0756686970|5.0|GOT THIS FOR MY SON, HE LOVES IT. LOTS OF INFORMATION ON THE VARITY OF CHARACTERS, THE DIFFERENT LEVELS OF RANKS AND INSIGHT OF THE STORIES,

B007SGLZP8|4.0|john grisham still captures the essence of a good read packed with legal information and an interesting plot . the title is a bit misleading but the book itself is not.
B008M9PHWM|3.0|good record of course Bob's voice isn't what it used to be isn't requiring twenty more words is foolish it's a quick review not a critique, really?

B0060D0OWA|5.0|Watch this all of the time with my grandkids and we love it!  Pair it up with The Sorcerer's Apprentice and we have a great movie night.
B00935KWWO|5.0|I have it for my kindle fire ! And it works good ! It's fast and very responsive I recommend
B009NQKPUW|5.0|Eventho I disagree with the commercial politic of selling the combo with any possible format, this 3D bluRay deserves the title of master piece. The differences between the 3D and the regular bluRay movie are huge. The deepens in the 3d create a very different experience. I am a fan of detail and this movie is full of them. Great movie.
B0086449YA|5.0|As the founder of Dire Straits and continuing on through his other bands and solo career, Knopfler has proven himself to be a first class virtuoso giutarist and lyricist.
B009YU62H2|2.0|While I'm a big fan of Soundgarden I found this release to be full of disjointed soft rock songs that lack the fire and passion of their previous albums. I was really disappointed. The only ones I  liked were &#34;Taree&#34; and &#34;Rowing&#34;. As a Soundgarden fan, I wanted this album to have more of a &#34;Superunknown&#34; feel to it, and it doesn't. This album just sounds like a bunch of millionaire middle aged guys going through the motions. Sad. Now I know why it only cost me $3.99 to download this weak effort.
B005IU1OMA|5.0|this is a must have for any snowboarder!!! the product arrived on time, and was undamaged. every satisfied with every thing.
B009OYTAL8|4.0|Been a tv addict for a long time and think this show is well worth giving a try if you like this genre.
B000OXHRRC|5.0|A nice, fun, flick.  They do a great job of capturing the &#34;feel&#34; of rural France (relaxed, beautiful).  Worth watching
B009OXS8RQ|5.0|Lana really outdid herself in this special version. The addition of new songs really being a different side to her. There's more darker tone yet with so much honesty and beauty. I really love the addition, especially Ride, Yayo and God & Monsters. In Yayo there's this really unique sound and tone that you only hear from Lana when she sings live, it adds that jazzy, unrehearsed style and really brings so much emotions through her voice. This is an album of the year for me!!!
B008OOYALE|4.0|Love the breeding part its fun to see the new dragon creations. Its fun to see them evolve into their larger forms.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|Ms Goodwin does a fantastic job of capturing the drive and mission of her characters.  I've read several Lincoln biographies, but this is the first that really brings to life Lincoln's contemporaries.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|Good story line that kept you turning pages.  Ending was a bit predictable and light. Would however recommend it. All his books are great.
B008NMT684|5.0|My kids like to play with puzzles and my boy love it he likes the pictures and he learn to play
B000002LAC|5.0|I first owned Trio in cassette format.  I played it until it was worn out.  I've replaced it with a CD. The sounds of the 3 singers are mingled wonderfully and the songs are great.
B000FA5SMK|5.0|Nelson DeMille has done it again with Plum Island. He tells this story with suspense gripping enough to keep you breathless all the way through, and keep the reader guessing 'til the end.  I couldn't stop reading this tale of a mysterious and dangerous island where people fear chemical and other hazardous weapons are created and stored.  I stayed up way into the wee hours reading.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|so easy to use. for someone who is mathematically challenged this app is a life and time saver. you can be sure this app will be used often.
B007THA4FI|5.0|I am of the &#34;Harry Potter&#34; generation. I grew up eagerly awaiting book after book. I was never disappointed and Rowling certainly has not let me down now. The Casual Vacancy is not the next HP. Don't read it looking for magical creatures or for a new brand of He Who Must Not Be Named. Instead, read it to enjoy Rowling's superb story telling skills and to appreciate the intricacies of her well considered plot. If you consider yourself a fan of fine modern literature, then The Casual Vacancy is sure to please.
1439152802|5.0|I  love her work  it is so new and different  only other author out there doing anything unique is Sarah Addison Allen.  I loved the Forgotten Garden but this one was even better.  Read very carefully  you might miss a big clue.  I read the last 50 pages three times I loved it so much and got more info every time.  It twists and turns more than the most winding road you have ever seen.  This is a great read
B002DQFHKM|5.0|Very good album. Wonderful piece of nostalgia and some really good music. Can't wait to get DVD!<br />Can't go wrong if you like 80's rock.  Movie is not bad either......
B0092MKTL2|5.0|I couldn't believe my ears when I first stumbled upon them on spotify. Usually artists with this genre someone manage to throw in abusive language or content, but Imagine Dragons kept it clean all the way through! As soon as rounded through their album the first time, I couldn't help but getting enthusiastic about sharing them. And share them I did. So here I am, sharing them again and being proud to recommend a group with such rising potential.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|Best app ever! You can serve custumers and make money.You can even go to other story's and give them tips.I recommend that you get this app.Its just AWESOME!!!
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Great acting! Love the story line! Always enjoy a good scary story and this is it! Don't miss an episode!
B00A6PD9I4|4.0|kids loved it it was slow moving for me would reccomend anyone to see  it. thanks amazon for the rental
B005UA0FLE|5.0|This is a great addition to a Christmas collection. I love Buble and this album does more to solidify that.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Crazy good story done in the backdrop of a zombie filled world. Character development is great. I was surprised when I found out that everyone was coming back whether or not they were bitten. That took a few days for me to get good with.<br /> But overall the series is hypnotic. I cant wait for the next release.
B009SQQRH2|5.0|I rented this for my son Jagger, 3.5 years old and he loved it! Not to mention its good for parents as well, kept my sons and my attention. I highly recommend, and this may be a purchase for Jagger's stocking.
B009GEBBNQ|1.0|I am really not sure what this movie is about, so I won't try to give a detailed review. I was most impressed by the long leather coats that Samuel Jackson and a few of the other actors wore. I was also impressed by Scarlet Johanson's make-up, which actually made her appear to be swarthy in several scenes. There was a lot of action, but I was never really sure who was doing what to whom. Also, what was the deal with this tesseract thing? It didn't even resemble a real tesseract -- but what does? I am sure that if I watched this movie again several times I would begin to figure out what it was about, but life is way too short to waste the time. This one is going on my list of all-time over-rated movies.
B002ZG976U|5.0|The best combo around, awesome music with an awesome cast!  Uplifting, fun, feel good movie!  You can never get too much Burlesque.
159413586X|5.0|I really liked this book; I got this copy for my 9 year old grandson, and he liked it also.  It arrived in great condition even though it was listed as a used book.
B009VB7P6G|5.0|My 5 y old daughter and I watched this movie in theaters and she had tears in her eyes! Absolutely a must see and buy movie!
0439023521|5.0|The first of the series and it was great - a little bloody, but definitely grabbed my attention!  Grandson now reading the series.
B005PMNBNG|5.0|Pop and progressive influences blend to create a sound that is accessible as it is unique.  Use this CD to enhance mood and concentration.  Great for work or relaxation.
B009GEBBNQ|4.0|I'm not one for these types of movies but I must admit that I enjoyed the movie especially the technical aspects and character humor.  I was pleasantly surprised.
B007HO392S|5.0|I have all of Carrie's CD's and this one is one of her best.  Lots of hit songs.  Great CD.
B009CPJHY4|4.0|Love anything with Judi Dench and this is another movie where she has not let me down. Enjoyed the romance and looking at retirement as the next exciting chapter in life.
B0068MNO4S|5.0|I was pleased with the movie \\"Anonymous.\\"  I used it with my Senior English classes as a suipplement to our study of Shakespeare's writings and the Reaaissance period of British literature. It evoked much good discussion.
B003TQKVGU|5.0|I didn't expect that much for this book, I thought maybe it would be a above average self-help book. But this book was very practical and straight forward on how to apply. What had most impressed me it the timelessness of this book. It goes well, really well with the 2012 higher conciseness theory coming into play. Get a head start...and prepared for the coming golden age...(-. Also can be applied to how the media is turning the public into zombies by slipping bogus straight-up conscious info from the broadcaster straight into the seat of your subconscious. Once that's been completed ............
B003F48E4W|5.0|old moves on blu-ray are so clear you see new things that you could not see on VHS and better then DVDs
B0071MQBX0|5.0|We loved this performance. It was so incredible how they did everything, it makes you feel like you're part of the audience. Saw the show in Vegas and let me tell you......watching the show on video in this kind of setting is awesome. Much better than the movie in 2009.
B009LK6JS2|4.0|I'm not a gamer but it's fun to pass the time when just don't feel like reading.  I would recommend it.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I feel like the episodes are starting to slide a little.  The characters aren't staying true to form but the show is still amazing!  I'll keep watching!
B000OWAFPE|5.0|My 18 month old granddaughter watches it on my Kindle Fire and just loves it.  She recently got through a 2-hour plane ride thanks to this movie.
B005LHOKFS|4.0|I use this every time we go to a different town to find the best places for various type of food.
B005I0DUMC|4.0|I always liked this movie and when it became available on blu ray I picked it up. it was filmed in edgewater n.j. a little town just south of the George Washington bridge. I used to live near there and it was interesting seeing the old area. it is a different kind of stallone movie.
B008KE3960|3.0|This program gets boring real fast.  It is fun for a while but it is not real difficult to master.
1861085257|5.0|It's not what I would consider a comprehensive &#34;class&#34; but it is certainly great for techniques I've not used before as well as projects I hadn't thought of!  I love this book, and I have no regrets about buying it. It's a great way to hone skills and perhaps even discover a new way to do something, like texturize breads and coconut shells.  Great book with lots of challenging projects.  Recommended!
B005K17RU0|4.0|This program seems to agree with the readings that I get on my home unit and is closer with predictions than the weather channels.
B0092C2X7U|5.0|This is a lot of fun to kill a few minutes here and there. Quick menus to get right to playing. takes some timing skill to master and is very addicting!
B008YRVW0I|4.0|It's like playing other match games, but with more of a reward.  The match boards vary, which makes them more interesting, and it's fun building your takes.  I'm enjoying it greatly.
B0058YPL66|5.0|Imaginative, well written series with great characters and fine acting! Television at its best! If you love fantasy as much as I do, this show is a must! From the writers of &#34;Lost&#34;, need I say more.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|It's fun and fast moving and for the most part plays like regular bingo. I just wish it was easier to get more chips  when you run out.  I think it's silly to have to purchase chips when I get the game for free.
B0081KTI0E|5.0|Love the &#34;feel&#34; of the film, cinematography was spot on. Good story and nice to see Daniel Radcliffe play something other than Harry Potter.
B00A7ZXH4O|5.0|My first Rihanna album. I have purchase singles before, but not a complete ablum. Man I love every song, but my favs are, Diamonds, Pour it up, Jump, Stay, and Love without tragedy/ Mother Mary. Loveeeeee it!!!!!
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Played it for hours on in.  If you a fan of this game, you need to download it. I did.
B008XG1X18|5.0|My supervisor turned me on this app and I love it to pieces. Thanks to whomever developed this apps for us.
B0071MQBX0|5.0|This is a fabulous production. It makes you feel as if you were in the best seats in the house - not the nosebleed section where I saw it for the first time. I highly recommend this to anyone who loves Phantom or wants the experience without paying hundreds of dollars for that perfect Broadway seat.
B007ZGO7EM|1.0|I don't see the point in having an app like this that I can't use when I am not on wiring.
B006SMLAMQ|3.0|This app is about as accurate as any weather forcast and since you can access it any time you want for<br />any city you want and it breaks the day down into hourly increments it is very handy to have.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|The family bond, the freedom to choose your own destiny, and the opportunity to be yourself, not what the world wants you to be are all in this movie.  Great family entertainment.  Probably one of the best Disney Pixar films since Toy Story.
B009LUCPWQ|5.0|They might not be as young as they used to be, but Graham Parker and the Rumour are as spry as ever and still play beautiful music.  With this album, Parker shows he's one of the few rockers whose later work is as good or better than his early work.  It's a spirited album with unusual chord progressions and melodies, adult lyrics that don't insult your intelligence, often with uncommon rhymes, and hooky guitar licks.  There are one or two songs of dubious quality, but compare that to other seasoned rockers too numerous to mention whose whole albums are of that caliber.  I'd actually rate this a 4 1/2.
B007ZGO7EM|1.0|you cant do square root or any thing important like that. so this app is a fail and i see y every1 likes this calculator.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|This movie is a great twist on the typical princess movies out there. Best part is the diversity now a days.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Good Book. Most exciting of all The Hunger Games books with some very unexpected plot twists. Recommended to anyone who loves a good book.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This is a great show! Just wish we had cable again to watch it faster. They leave ya on the edge of your seats!
B0086DBE62|4.0|This is a good movie.  I rented this for my granddaughters entertainment on Thanksgiving and she really enjoyed the movie.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Really helpful and always just a click away.  Don't use it for forecasts as much as current weather conditions at my destination.
B009KHDT0C|3.0|This movie is okay.  I found it to be funny but I would not buy this.  I found using Prime was worth buying from Amazon.  I love being able to rent a movie without leaving home.  I do wish the time I had to view was longer.
B005HSL626|4.0|For a game, this is a great app. But now if I'm not connected to Internet, I get kicked out. and when I have Internet on, it means lots of ads. Good game, bad consequences.
B0011Z3334|5.0|This is one of the best albums I've bought, but I really have no idea how to review music, it being so subjective. I suppose the only thing I have to say is, Paramore is so unique in its sound that they're definitely worth a listen, and if you've liked any song of theirs you've heard, you'll most likely enjoy this entire album.
B0074JODP8|5.0|Joe is awesome as always.  This is another great performance by Joe and all of his guests.  It is a must have for any Bona-holic's collection!
B0021L8V0M|4.0|Okay, I thought this was a great movie. Now, I should mention I'm kind of a big Angelina Jolie fan, so my opinion may be skewed, but opinions are by nature biased anyway so who cares.<br /><br />Anyway, I was entertained from start to finish, and I didn't see most of the twists coming. Jolie's a great action star, and I think the best part of this movie is that it has a female action lead without making that the point. So many movies with female action leads seem to be -about- the fact that the lead is female, but that's not the case here- the lead is a badass, and she just happens to be female.<br /><br />About the movie itself, you definitely want this edition, and you definitely want to watch the Director's cut (not Extended), as it includes a better ending and scenes that were changed for the theatrical release are much better there. If you like spy flicks or action films, you'll enjoy this movie and all that happens, especially some rather extreme and original moments.
B000SGSU58|4.0|Huge Michael Connelly and Harry Bosch fan and this book didn't disappoint. Get it if you like a good suspense story.
B00A6PD9I4|3.0|The movie has some entertaining parts to it.  The basic premise isn't that great.  The little brothers and the dad are entertaining.  Truthfully, when the mom becomes a bear the movie takes a huge dive.  It's just plain boring and lost me.  Ending is fine.  Without a doubt pixar's worst yet.
0061537969|5.0|Am anxious to read this.  I love animals and am anxious to get in a quiet corner and cozy up and read it as soon as possible.
0553801473|4.0|This one overlaps events in book 3 and 4.  It helps to explain things that have happened and are about to happen.  But don't be surprised if you are flipping back through the previous books to figure out where characters fit in.  Once again the lists of houses is essential to keep things straight.  The game continues...<br /><br />Winter is STILL comiing...
0812984412|5.0|Am anxious to read this.  Sounds like a good read.  Am stocking up for the winter reading on my list.
B008BM9L72|5.0|Having noticed that just about every woman had a copy of this book, and seemed not to be able to put it down, was the reason I bought it. I think the long, and very explicit sex descriptions (although tastefully written) are little tiring, because there was a very good storyline behind that. It may be a little optimistic that Christian was &#34;cured&#34; so easily, but it was heading in the right direction.<br /><br />It also gave an insight into the world of sado-masochism, which I knew very little about. It also gave insight to a women's feelings about sex, and, as such, is worth reading by men who want women to get more enjoyment from sex.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I truly love this series. I am anxiously awaiting Season 3. The acting is very good, and the story lines just draw you right into the Abbey.
B0067AC5KA|5.0|Great case!!!!! The quality and price were perfect. I would be this product again. I have recommended it to my friends.
B0074MZSWW|4.0|They are great. New to me, like all kind of musical talent. This group will go very far. Lots of oopa.
B004UID2LC|5.0|its a great app u can upload small little Tv shows so u can wach them even if u do not have wii its great u can even wach music videos its awsome
B0071BGOJC|5.0|I have waited with great anticipation for Winter of the World and Ken Follett did not disappoint me.  I have only one complaint - the book is so difficult to put down!  I can't wait for his next novel.
B008G59IKO|5.0|I have been a Green Day fan ever since I first saw the video for Longview many years ago. I have faithfully purchased every album Green Day has produced, and usually pick the new one up as soon as it is released. Knowing Green Day throws out an album every couple of years, I hadn't really followed any recent news since 21st Century Breakdown, an album which I think is excellent. I figured I'd do a search a few months ago to see if they had anything new in the works, and sure enough, I wasn't surprised to see a new album coming my way. I was pleasantly surprised, though, to see we were getting a triple dose of back to back to back studio releases. Yes! 30+ more songs I will have instantaneously permeated into my brainwaves! Forward several months later: Picked up UNO! and enjoyed all the songs on this album, but didn't find anything too different, from previously released albums except for KILL THE DJ, that really reached out and grabbed ya'. There were some vocals and chords/rhythms that were pretty reminiscent of some past Green Day tracks thrown in, but you usually notice that on their albums, I guess it's just their style. Still an enjoyable CD, as their past CD's, I will listen to it repeatedly until I have nearly every track memorized. Now, fast forward again, two months later: Picked up DOS! and, damn.. this, in my opinion, is my favorite and best Green Day album to date. For everyone that says they don't like the poppy sound or style that Green day has embraced over the years,(not my personal opinion at all) please give this album a listen! I have listened to this album close to ten times now, and every song has it's own uniqueness and catchy sound and vocals that just completely blows UNO! out of the water. Every song on here is amazing, even the rap-esque song, and I despise rap music with a passion. Thank goodness they try something different on their albums. Who wants to listen to the same old style again and again like you get from other mainstream bands? If there ever is an album to display how good Green Day really is, this is the DEFINITIVE Green Day album to own that shows just how talented they really are. After all these years, there is still much, much, more to look forward to as far as great music from this band. Honestly, when has Green Day ever produced a bad album? Never. Thank you, guys, for producing such a fantastic work of art. This is your crowning achievement.? If there ever is an album to display how good Green Day really is, this is the DEFINITIVE Green Day album to own that shows just how talented they really are. After all these years, there is still much, much, more to look forward to as far as great music from this band. Honestly, when has Green Day ever produced a bad album? Never. Thank you, guys, for producing such a fantastic work of art. This is your crowning achievement.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Very good book! Had some interesting twists and turns right up to the end of the book!  I will be looking for more by this author.
B005LAIHSQ|4.0|The movie is good but I except different ending. I think the ending is not very exciting and need more action before end.
B009YG2ND8|5.0|My sons are 7 and 9, and we fight over our daily reading time, they will play this game and happily sound out mythril and pheonix fur (fleece?  I forget...) We limit their video game time pretty severely, but it's nice to know that when they are playing, it's not some realistic violent our pointless dragon raising game, they have to remember where things are and read read read.  My husband played this game when it first came out, and is equally obsessed.  It's been a great purchase for ages 7, 9, and 40.
B004LWZW7Y|4.0|I like to watch anmination movie and I think the story was very good and funny, for the whole family.
B000SEJHRA|4.0|Sedaris is the PG Wodehouse of our era it's not about plot twists and impossible fantasies but regular people in slightly weird situations. This is classic Sedaris humor making you laugh uncontrollably in public. Or smile like a fool when you read something that seems to have taken from your life too. There is a bit too much of his France and French adventures but maybe others would relate to it better.
0385535147|4.0|This is one of the best Grishams that I've read in years. It's fun, full of twists and turns and keeps you turning the pages until the end. John Grisham is a master storyteller. He may not be the world's best writers and you have to suspend belief on several occassions but he keeps you engaged and interested in what is going to happen next.<br />  The story is about Maxwell Bannister and what he'll do for freedom and revenge. A lawyer who is carelessly caught in a big indictment, he spends his prison years plotting what will happen next in his life. He has lost everything- his wife, child, career and respect. He wants a life when he is free and he sets up an elaborate plan to do so. One of the questionable aspects is his relationship with Vanessa. How did they get so close? How did they plan together? Sometimes it's just better not to question too closely and go with the flow. And what a flow it is. The story takes many unexpected tujrns and kept me guessing to the end.<br />  It was a pleasurable read and I had a great time.
B004NELBPC|4.0|Huffington Post loads the articles surprisingly fast.  This is etter organized and easier to read than most other news apps.
B009FZHYKU|4.0|Love this show but subtitles need to be added. Otherwise the hard of hearing will have to watch it somewhere else.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|I just finished reading this book--couldn't put it down.  I have been a DeMille fan for quite some time and always eagerly await his latest work.  He never fails to deliver.  I especially enjoy the books featuring John Corey, the wisecracking, sarcastic NYPD detective.  In this book, he is after another &#34;cat&#34;--code named The Panther, who engineered the attack on the USS Cole during a refeuling stop in Yemen.  If you've read &#34;Lion's Game&#34; and its sequel &#34;The Lion,&#34; you will find this book equally fascinating.  John always manages to get himself into some very thorny situations, but always gets himself out.  This book is no exception.  He, along with his wife, Kate, are somewhat coerced into going to Yemen on this special mission.  Along the way, John realizes that he not only has to worry about being done in by the terrorist he is after but also worry about being double-crossed by certain members of his team.  .<br />.<br />DeMille's narrative sometimes gets a little &#34;wordy&#34; or overly descriptive, but that is fairly typical of this author.  In this case, however, the narrative brings some very important insight into the situation in the Middle East.  It gave me an understanding of what conditions are like--how alliances are made among various groups, government agencies, and countries--including the United States.  This book in its own way serves as sort of a primer on modern international relations.<br /><br />The book is such a great read; you will not be disappointed.
0756405890|5.0|I liked this book very much and am waiting to get part 2 of the trilogy. I hope there is a happy ending somewhere.
B00AA7O22U|4.0|massive action packed footage.  With hardly any moments of silence or boring parts.  Epic cast of crew from numerous films working together on one film.  Although the story line could have used some additonal plots, the overal action made it a great GUY movie.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|The best set of books Ive ever read!  I am sad that there are only three books in this series.
B005LAIHY0|5.0|I would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys a movie brings out the big questions and leaves you more questions when it over. Like why don't they make a sequel to this movie where they explore what happens when our heroine gets to the home planet in one of their ships and demands to know why they wanted to exterminate the human race. Of course given our current planetary consciousness or lack there of,its no stretch to see that we still have a long way to go,before we are ready to deal with other species from other parts of the universe.As for the movie,it was visually captivating and engrossing from start to finish. It could have been longer and I would not have noticed, I was so fascinated with the interiors and set design's and wondering what a lot of it was used for in my imagination. I have read some of the criticism about this movie and for my bucks,which I bought the movie I have no regrets at all. I only hope the franchise continues and brings more marvels to the screen.
B008NR90HQ|2.0|I know in this day and age the &#34;F&#34; word is used in daily conversations for many uneducated folks, however its still shocking to hear in this house !<br />A warning would have been nice and I would not have wasted my money !!!<br />Its a sad tribute to a great guitar player, sorry they thought it was O.K. to leave that in.
B00A6PD9I4|3.0|Well visually, musically, acting, etc, it is all up to disney pixar standards, except where the plot line goes. It's the same typical plot line I have seen in a million movies, and not even remotely hid or spun into a new concept. Kinda disappointing, but pretty.
B008966SLM|5.0|Roberts guitar playing at its best !<br />And that signature voice of his, well what more can ya say ?<br />Excellent piece of work and I vote it for the coolest album art of the year !!!
B008XBCJ34|5.0|Awesome with the Samsung Smart TV! ! The TV may be expensive, but totally worth it to be able to watch a 3D movie at home!
B004I8WD6E|5.0|This clear case is actually quite sturdy. I like it. I still don't feel completely safe dropping it like I would an Otterbox, but it a nice change. I could actually see my iPhone. Which never happens! :)
B0013WJGJ0|2.0|I had seen this film in 1989, but had forgotten that it really wasn't that much better than the 1960's Batman. Worse, the 80's fashions are no longer in style and make this film even more laughable. Disappointing film from Tim Burton. I think I actually enjoyed his first Frankenweenie better.
B009LK6JS2|5.0|I enjoy trying to land on the carrier. Plane responds well to the device being turned and tilted. Works well on a phone but better on a tablet. I am going to purchase this companies other apps.
B000IZ8SD8|4.0|This Star Trek marked the best of the Next Generation film franchise. The next two were greatly disappointing! Always great to have the Borg involved. Like the previous franchise, I enjoyed the literary references (Moby Dick in this one and see Star Trek 6, the Undiscovered Country, reference by Christopher Plummer,&#34;Shakespeare is always better in the original Klingon).
B008S4FZHI|2.0|The Scarpetta novels are becoming more and more of the same: characters who have really proven themselves in the series are continuously under suspicion  ( this time it 's Marino, more often than not it 's Scarpetta herself) and the culprit is again a fringe character who is hardly mentioned in the course of the novel.
B000002VRZ|5.0|I have this album on the original vinyl and rediscovered it on Amazon while looking for something new. I play guitar (not anywhere near this level) and appreciate the playing by this band-innovative and tight. They maybe one of the most under appreciated bands from the southern-rock genre. TASTY STUFF.
B004GJDQT8|2.0|Well, all excited and ready to go to no avail. App does not work on my tablets, period.<br />It works fine on my mobile though.<br />The software experts got to pull some late nighters to fix this problem and to make it compatible with all droid systems.
B006TKP2B2|3.0|The book is interesting because it is based on the quite possible environmental consequences of humanities current behavior. I am put off, however by his constant use of Thai terms, the meanings of which I often cannot even guess.
B009329Y30|3.0|Not one of his best books or movies. I was kind of disappointed. But the book was a bit more entertaining than the movie.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|I would recommend Angry Birds Star Wars to any Angry Bird lover.  The sound effects are really fun, and the action combines the best moves of all the previous games.
0446401307|3.0|A decent installment but you can feel something is different.  Low and behold this was originally an installment based series in a magazine which flipped into a novel after the fact...explains that different feeling.  But it's still Bosche, so you still have to read it and it's decent.
B00124DSR0|5.0|I remember seeing Chicago in Chicago just after this album came out. They were great! The album brings back such memories.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|it is a fun and a good time taker for any one like found at state fairs with out spending deal money its great
B002HLM4E0|5.0|Great movie, whole family liked it.  Streaming was easy you could pause and go back when needed.  I would do it again
B009NPKTN6|2.0|Not worth the rental. Took out all the amusing and good parts from the original musical and left a mediocre shell.
B0055B7IPE|5.0|This is a good movie for adults to watch. Kids will enjoy the movie, but the concept is more for adults.
B001O6W9QC|1.0|One of the 10 worst movies I've seen. Two or three amusing moments during the 97 minutes. The rest is just dumb and boring.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Many levels from easy to hard. Great free app for entire family. I would recommend to my family and friends.
B007SGLZP8|1.0|Thought that I was buying a regular book not a short story.  This is a definite ripoff. Don't buy it.
B004GYY714|5.0|Can listen to my favorite professional football team. Generally easy to use, although it took me a few seconds to figure out how to turn it off.
B008OOYALE|3.0|Loved this on my old Kindle Fire (original model) but I cannot access all portions of the islands on my new HD 8.9 Kindle Fire. Also the zoom in and out is screwed up. Will zoom in but not out and won't let you go back to the original once you do zoom in. Now there are areas of my neighbors islands and my own island that I cannot play. Would really like an update to fix this and will report it to teamlava.<br /><br />I would give it a better rating on a different device but lets face it, once you get above level 25 on an old Kindle Fire it is really slow and you have to clear your cache or things don't show up/dissappear; and on the new device the whole island is not accessible.<br /><br />Amazon, you really need to step up with apps, I love your tablets but there are so many good apps that you don't have or that just don't work right :(
B007RI56NY|5.0|I love this album. I cant think of a song on this album that I dont love. California 37 is my fave! CD is full of upbeat awesome songs!
B004MC0FO8|5.0|I love it . It works and anytime I need the name of a old song i can rest asure shazam will give it to me
B009VB7QQA|5.0|A fast-paced vampire hunter movie that is in no way meant to be taken seriously. Very easy to watch--not unreasonably gory--and best enjoyed with a group a friends.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I have found old friends with this. I have created many groups and keep in touch with my family. Facebook is the best
B002ZG99IG|5.0|The Roomate is quite an entertaining movie if you want to know how someone can be so obsessed over her best friend's private life. The story is somewhat pretty old but when it comes to murder, then people start paying more attention to the main character as much as the others. I know that these kind of movies are B-grade and better off just watching with your close college friends. Hey, but at least you won't get bored and doze off if the story is this interesting, right guys.
B004W2UBYW|4.0|I read a little at a time, then read something else, then come back to it.  He really was the Edison of our time and his story is something everyone should be familiar with. I just get tired of all the detail (I'm not a real computer person).
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|Very easy to use. Get the best quality download allowed. Quality not so good on anything else. Other wise good experience.
B009NQKPUW|3.0|Some nice effects and intriguing as a pre-quel for &#34;Alien&#34; series, but too preachy a message towards the end. Characters garner no sympathy from audience, especially the old man who wants to live forever. No wonder &#34;God&#34; wanted to destroy them.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|My 3 year old son loved this movie and so did I... It is really about morals... Teaching people not to be selfish...
B001B4JVKE|2.0|The Katie Melua Collection DVD won't play on a Sony DVD player or a Samsung DVD Player.  Could only get it to work on my Laptop.  Not sure why this is the case but I would not have purchased if I had known this
B0034G4P1W|5.0|It has humor and action... My son loves this movie... He watches it atleast once a day every since we got it for him...
B004V5A7K8|5.0|I love this game on my Kindle Fire.....it works very well on this device and it becomes an addictive game!
B009D5VNLS|5.0|Great movie. For kids or adults.<br />Has a good story line, and overall message.<br />Awesome graphics with attention to detail.
B00181JGI2|2.0|This felt like an excessively long and violent Saturday Night Live skit.  I was getting impatient anyway, so the toe was my breaking point.
B0076DCT2G|4.0|Great sarcasm from Corey, and wife Kate, but could have been more action.  Still, another fun read from De Mille.
B00A6PD8RQ|3.0|Really looking forward to watching this after all the hype but for me it fell flat. Fabulous animation could not make up for the complete lack of anything else.
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|Non stop action that keeps your attention. Easy to watch late a night when you are tired from a long day.
B008SVS3FC|3.0|John has done better, as far as albums go (i.e. Bring the Family, Master of Disaster, Dirty Jeans and Mudslide Hymns are keepers)
B00006I53S|5.0|I have only recently delved into digital SLRs after a number of years shooting with an array of point and shoots, even to the point of winning a couple of photo competitions. I am good with composition but still learning with the technical side.<br /><br />I bought this lens as I needed a walk around lens with a bit of zoom for taking photos while bushwalking and also while in the city. Originally I had a Canon 18-55mm kit lens and a Sigma 70-300mm zoom. I have used this lens on an 1100D (Rebel T3) with the APS-C sized sensor.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Very clear photos<br />Very fast auto focus<br />Works well in bright and low light<br />The focus ring operates even when autofocus is switched on allowing fine tuning.<br />Very smooth focussing<br />smooth zooming<br /><br />Cons:<br />When camera is point directly down or up to 10 degrees off it extends by itself.<br />A bit heavier that other lenses<br /><br />After using this lens for about 2 months now I find that it was an excellent choice. It is very good in most light, fast to find focus and gives surprisingly clear results. With this lens I often can zoom up to 100% when cropping the image and still have an acceptable result.<br /><br />I have taken photos of birds in flight, moving vehicles and people running both at high and low shutter speeds and have had pleasing results. I have used it for photos of waterfalls, plants, flowers and vistas with great effect. I have also used it family gatherings and found that the zoom is great for capturing candid shots.<br /><br />The quality in this lens is well beyond the other two I mentioned above and I would recommend it to anyone who is ready to take the next step with their photography.
B0096PAA6E|5.0|This kid is a star.  Stay tuned because we will be seeing a lot of him, I hope and predict.
B007NCSQFO|1.0|Previewed the album before I purchased it and the music content was explicit. Just downloaded the album and the music content is clean..... Not the item I wanted....Disappointment!!
B000SEGUDE|2.0|Too convoluted for my reading tastes.  Why do you need 14 more words in order for me to &#34;submit&#34;?  I do not understand.
1439193630|5.0|Far from boring!  This book on writing was so good that I couldn't put it down until I finished it.  I've numerous books on honing my writing skills and trying to just get started on a writing projects.  This is the only one that has kept my interest and was so down to earth.  I look at Stephen King in a different light, now.  I always wondered how he got ideas for his bizarre stories.  Thanks to this book, I've finally started my novel.  One of my best buys yet.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Awesome. All three seasons have been terrific. I highly recommend. Great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great a
B0095R76EW|3.0|Huge Jason Segel fan and this movie was kind of depressing at times but its worth a rent for sure
B005LAIHYU|4.0|I really like this movie that is why i just had to have it. Also i have very fast shipping, quick and simple. I was very surprised how quickly it arrived. This is a great movie in my opinion if you like vampires and all that jazz. Even my dad enjoyed the movie and he doesn't really like vampires, i would say that's something..
1439153663|5.0|We all enjoyed this book, gave us another perspective on slavery.  We are hoping for a sequel!  For a first novel she did an awesome job!
B007K3JCAE|4.0|This movie comes with a blu-ray and digital copy and an ultra violet copy, hence coming with three total copies of the movie so you can watch in different devices. i love the quality of the movie and the packaging as well. A great movie to add to your collection and to give as a gift.
B008K7WCJM|5.0|Not an easy listening but if you bought it intentionally you already knew what you're getting into. It has everything from noise, electronic soundscapes, and epic melodies and includes songs beyond the 20 minute mark.
B00846REIS|5.0|Such a good book. Couldn't put it down. Also read the second book in the series hate that i have to wait til spring for the third one
B005HJWWW8|4.0|The previous reviews are fairly accurate, the EQ settings are partially usable and well described. I don't use them and the sound output is clear and precise, but I wish the amplification would be a better. Still, using it with my old Sennheiser headphones gives them the necessary boost when plugged into my iPod and laptop.
0439023521|5.0|I loved this book! It has everything; action, adventure, love, and well you've probably seen the movie but the book is so much better.
B0081TZETY|4.0|You'll either love it or hate it which is probably true for all Liars albums, they are far from melodic mainstream and are not easily described by any musical style. This one has some smooth electronic beats and is a bit more accessible.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|This is a great game to waste time on. Some puzzles are really hard and some are really easy. I wish they could give you kore hints.
B009NQKPUW|4.0|The fascinating premise that mankind was DNA seeded in prehistory by a race of alien travelers begins with a grand opening of cinematography and music.  As the story unfolds, these &#34;Engineers&#34; left their calling cards throughout a few early human tribes.<br />The modern (future) discovery of these wall and cave paintings leads to an expedition to the star system and planet depicted in the drawings.  Upon the discovery of remnants of these Engineers, other life forms are encountered, and any similarity to Ridley Scott's &#34;Alien&#34; points to &#34;Prometheus&#34; as the prequel.  While this movie lacks some of the horror-shock of the Alien series, the storyline is compelling and clever, the acting is vibrant and real and in the end, there are more questions than answers.<br /><br />The last scene begs for a sequel, which I understand, is in the works.
B009SQRL4U|5.0|This is a great family movie for the holidays. No bad language at all and it's good for all age groups.
B0085Z8F4A|3.0|The 3D disc worked very well.  NOT ONE GHOST!  Plenty of depth and resolution but not enough &#34;pop-out&#34; for my taste.  The story is good; the acting OK.  Noomi, however, is GREAT!!  Because of all the dark scenes the 3D black acuity wasn't that great on my TV.  The sound is great on my system.<br /><br />  The DVD version is excellent vis a vis the colors.  My receiver did the 1080i to 1080p upscaling very well.<br /><br />BUT:<br /><br />This is the second package.  I returned the first one because the BluRay version had freezes and droupouts on one BD player, and took an age to load.  The same BD version did not even load on my other (3D) BD player.  The BluRay disc from my second package corrupted my BD player something awful and I will not even attempt to load it again.
B009GEBBNQ|1.0|I downloaded the movie, but was unable to watch it because it never loaded on my Kindle.  Very frusterated on a 6 hour flight with no movie to watch.
B009RI4FRU|5.0|Fabulous, funny, fantastic movie! If you are a child of the 60's, you will love this movie. Everyone is fabulous!
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Really enjoyed playing this game. Very addictive to play. One of those games that you can't seem to put down until you are finished.
B009SQQRH2|1.0|Don't know because it expired before we finished. Will rent from a different source so I can actually watch the movie with out it expiring and waisting my money.
B009VB7QQA|3.0|It was the exact combination of silliness I expected. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't all that great either. Certainly worth the rental.
B0085Z8F4A|2.0|3d copy start and stop start and stop for about half an hour.had dust and fingerprints all over it.cleaned it up but no difference
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|I really liked this movie. Good for all ages! Great for family nights in. I would buy it if i could!
B008G33NFC|4.0|I always enjoyed NIGHTWISH and when Tarja left, I thought that they would carry on with their musical ideas, but she has found her perfect niche, and this concert DVD is very impressive. Sure she is a Diva, but what a voice and stage presence.
B0058YPGSY|5.0|We don't have cable and Netflix was taking forever to send the discs, so I brought the season and loved it.  Can't wait for season 5!
B00A14SQBU|3.0|There is no doubt that she has one of the best singing voices in the business, but it seems she can't figure out who she wants to be.  There is no continuity to this album.
B008ALAHA4|5.0|I had an extra charging cable for my old MacBook Pro for travel and was not looking forward to spending another $80 to get a travel cable for the new one. Thankfully, this one made the old cable work with the new laptop. It doesn't attach to the cable by any means other than magnetism, though. So I use this on the MagSafe 1 cable at home, and travel with the MagSafe 2 cable.
B005PW3OS8|4.0|In my youth I read comics to escape certain periods of my life.  Captain America, like many other of my favorite heros have been brought to the screen in recent years.  In many ways it is nice to see them come to life in a newer form.  Evan's film is a lovely adaptation full of action and adventure.
B008XG1X18|4.0|I love almost everything about Pinterest. The one thing I wish they would add is categories inside a board. Otherwise I am totally addicted to this place! Love you Pinterest!
B004XANKVO|5.0|I have owned a few backpacks over the years and this maybe the finest design and construction for a 17&#34; notebook that I have ever owned.
B003F3NDWG|5.0|Castle rocks!  I hope this show is around for a long time to come.  My favorite television show on t.v.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|These have been the industry standard for a longtime.  Reliable, light weight and affordable, they are the best choice for your bag!
B001ECDVKE|5.0|This movie is a classic.  If you have never seen it, check out all the big names in this one.
B007BVOEPI|1.0|While the pilot was mildly interesting, it felt like it was written by comic book guy from the Simpsons. The women were disposable and the men had all the fun.  My advice? Pick up any novel ny Phillip K. dick or go watch venture bros. Your I.Q. Won't suffer for it.
B008J34466|5.0|The music on this CD is varied and mixed as is typical of PINK.  She doesn't disappoint with this one either.  Good stuff.
B008NEVP1S|5.0|There is only one other thing in the universe more soothing to my central nervous system than Aimee Mann's voice.<br />That would be a tribble from Star Trek. But, they all died because they ate poisoned quadrotriticale grain at a space outpost station. So, that just leaves Aimee. I'm cool with that. I have all of her records and Charmer is the best, so far. I saw her Charmer tour at three different venues in California this fall.-Fillmore,S.F./ Uptown Theatre, Napa / Ebell-Wilshire Theater, L.A.<br />Like fine wine she just gets better and better as time goes on - a truly gifted signer-songwriter. If you see her in a photo smiling, it's her natural state.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|My granddaughters have been wanting to see Brave for months; Amazon made it very affordable, and we made a family party out of watching it all snuggled together in front of our TV with popcorn and pillows.  It was a typical Disney story; wonderful for the kids, but fun for the grown-ups, too; and with life-lessons we could all talk about afterward.
B000JMKTLO|3.0|Again, G. Flynn tackles one of societies sad and difficult warts and does it well but I would tend to recommend it to someone studying deviant behavior or psychology. I did not find it entertaining but very interesting.
B0036XN2L2|3.0|it seens they are lusing inspiration.<br />all tracks seens to be the same.<br />they are really getting old.I think that is the end.
B008O69SZ0|5.0|I am a life-long Ian Hunter fan (just saw him in concert again last night), and think this latest disc is vintage post-Mott Hunter.  It's a bit more up-tempo than his last few recordings, and well worth a listen.  The Rant Band sounds very tight as well.
B0000024JN|4.0|dont sleep till broklin and fight for your rights pays the record.<br />the gittar solo in these two tracks are wonderfull.
B0096HID5M|5.0|i saw the show on broadway and n.y. like the movie ,play was  great but the m ovie story better
B0097GVJWQ|4.0|I love this kind of game. Good story and just a relaxing time passer.  Hive me more of these games. Just keep the cost low.
B006YXTRHY|5.0|wanted to see it before I saw part 2.  Glad I did.  Was a good movie.  Not a classic that will live on forever but nice entertainment.
B008B1VYP0|5.0|I love it! I bought it for a great price. I love maroon 5, this album shows their growth as a band
B003ZTQN1I|5.0|Great CD arrived on time great condition.  I have been listening to it everyday.  The only thing I was looking forward to listening to Give in to me by the actors on the move. Faith Hill did a great job think actors were a little better.  Sorry Faith.
B008J34466|3.0|I typically don't mind off-color language but she uses more curse words that felt comfortable.  It was almost as if that was the point of the song.  It didn't emphasize or give emotional color so much as just distracted and jarred.  Analogy: if f's were bombs, she'd be a B-52.
B005NNV4TU|3.0|There are some great songs here but overall it sounds kind of bland.  It was a huge success for them and rightfully so.  Technically proficient but not a lot of feeling in the songs. Kind of goes down like The Long Run by The Eagles or Gaucho by Steely Dan.  Great groups trying to be TOO perfect.  The perfection wipes away the soul.  And yes Pink Floyd at their best had soul.  Still a good album and worth buying.
B009A3NGF4|5.0|Enjoyed the  folk tune modernized. Great cd that I can listen to start to finish. Their other CD's are just as good as well.
B007MDB548|5.0|I'm actually going to let my kids review this movie considering I bought it for them! They love it. They are 3 year old twin girls so Tinkerbell having a sister was a great idea for them.
B0091REZMW|5.0|i have really enjoyed playing this game.  it is worth the purchase if you enjoy the seek and find type games.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I enjoyed reading the final book of the hunger game trilogy.  There were surprises, good and bad.  I wanted the story to continue.
B00A3DZ61W|4.0|Very good free game. Passes the time. Better effort than many other free games. six more words needed, now finished.
0307891372|5.0|Purchased this a long time ago when the game came out. Is a great book and had everything I needed in it. It is easy to refer to this while playing then trying to google up the info I need. Complete lists and maps for items and locations on anything you can think of.
B008KE3960|2.0|I have only played it a few times, but did not find it very addictive and have not gone back to the game.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Seasons 1 and 2 were great but I was worried going into season 3 that the storyline would start to slow down and drag a bit. Boy was I wrong! Every single episode for season 3 has been suspenseful and just incredible so far. Every time I watch an episode I think the production staff has outdone themselves and they can't top that episode and the very next week they prove me wrong! Non stop action and suspense thus far! This series quickly became our family time tv show!
B0096PAA6E|5.0|This is one of the best new CD's I have heard in a long time.  Roots blues runs through the whole album even though only a few of the songs are true 'blues' songs. The rest of the songs rebuild the blues form the ground up to create a beautiful 21st century interpretation. Really, really good music!
B008KE3960|5.0|Stuck at the airport and it made my layover &#34;fly&#34; by :)<br />This game is challenging and has replay value because you can play levels you didn't do so well in with new planes you've unlocked.
0143121421|5.0|Its a John le Carre book, need I say more?  He weaves a tail that keeps you turning pages well into the night.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|I have it on both my phone and Kindle fire. Love it and I have to force myself to stop.
B007ONSLLQ|5.0|Absolutely awesome. Not a weak track on the entire album. Halestorm is amazing and the album was nothing short of what I expected it to be.
B0015346OM|5.0|This was a great book explaining the inner workings of the military elite troops in action.  Well told story. Thanks!
B009YU62H2|5.0|Soundgarden did not fail in meeting my expectations of their newest album. It's almost as though they picked up right where they left off with Down on the Upside.
B0026SFEW8|5.0|The movie was a wonderful voyage back to my youth.  It allowed me to return to the &#34;good old days!&#34;
B005LAIHZY|4.0|As usual, I read the one star reviews before I actually saw this movie, and I have to say - there are some serious spazzes out there.  People were talking about how dark and horrifying this movie was, with small children running screaming from the theater and protective mothers preparing to make a dash, which, frankly, gave me even more motivation to watch the film.  I have to wonder what pile of powder puffs these people have been living under, because this movie was hardly the dark, gory nightmare they made it out to be.  I mean seriously, what kind of lies has a parent been telling a child for them to be crying over a bear eating fish? Come on people!  The reviews I read had me thinking I was going to see something entirely different from what really happened.<br /><br />There's a maid whose cleavage is rather prominent (not spilling out of her clothes, but the cleavage of a full figured woman in clothing that a woman of her station would have worn during that time period), but it's suited to her figure - frankly, big girls have big breasts, and big breasts make for noticeable cleavage.  I didn't find it offensive, but accurate. Kids see more on regular tv, the internet, [home] and magazines than what was shown in this movie.  The only other thing that some may have found offensive were the bare bottoms of the clansmen when they had to use their kilts to get off the roof after the triplets locked them up there. And there was the ridiculous fighting between clans due to the delay in a decision on the suitors, but there's a greater message lost on those who get caught up in the superficial.<br /><br />The mother/daughter rift and emotions were real.  Elinor's doing her best to prepare her daughter for what seems to be inevitable [according to tradition], Merida isn't ready and thinks it's all unfair (especially given they just dropped the bomb on her, no warning this was about to happen at all) - most of us would feel the same way about being forced by tradition todo something you neither want or are ready to face, never mind the fact that the sons she had to chose from were seriously lacking in so many ways and downright unappealing.  Elinor is the calm in the storm.  She's smart, composed, and commands respect just by her presence - and she's trying her hardest to teach her daughter the importance of these traits in their environment, but Merida is daddy's unruly girl and bucks at the constraint of her mother's constant chiding, correcting and teaching - she just wants to be herself.  All of it is understandable and real.  They both learn something about themselves via the spell and gain a new respect for each others differences - daughter applies a lot of mother's long-taught lessons (kids are listening even when you think they aren't) and mother finds a strength and freedom she didn't know she had.<br /><br />Some people ask, \\"why a bear?\\"  Why not a bear? Would a talking frog have gotten the point across about the strength of a mother's love and protection? No.  The humor wasn't quite on par with what we're accustomed to, I'd agree that it's more slapstick than wit, and there is something lacking between the realization that the old woman's a witch and the decision to ask her to change Elinor (happened too fast, no questions or thought, just a knee-jerk decision (which some people do in real life) - but there is a lesson to be learned from that too).  It's a bit disappointing that Merida didn't get to use her archery skills in a more heroic way, but maybe that's the reality of her existence and part of what will eventually make her a good queen.  The triplets and the maid were fun.  The men were reduced practically to oafs, in that boys-will-be-boys sort of way (embellish the truth, fight now ask questions later), which was rather disappointing considering they were leaders, but at the same time it's refreshing not to see the usual perfect, buttoned-up royals that Disney tends to portray.  Given the men's, behavior though, there's no wonder Elinor is always so restrained and worried about her daughter.  I also understand how some people felt mislead by the title and previews - but that's what studios do nowadays with most movies, they feed you the best parts through the previews and leave you wanting during the actual movie - marketing at it's best.  As it turns out, the title doesn't just apply to our little red-headed heroine, but her mother as well - it does, however, over-sell what the movie is really about.  All that being said, it's a very Disney movie, but it was enjoyable and reflective.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|My kiddos loved this version. I has quickly become their favorite. It also has some great lesson in Science:gravitation forces, balance and unbalance forces.. good job!
B005R32L66|5.0|I can only say it's great for seeing family. Marvelous. Can see our grand children all the time in real time.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|I personally love this app. I think that when you buy this app you should also whach the movie. I think that the people who made this app are very smart and I think ghat it is a great mix of two games. oh and go to pictures and whsch the trailer it is so FUNNY!
0439023491|5.0|Great product cheaper than others!!!! Definitely would buy this product again, good quality no hassle buying from buyer no problems
034580404X|3.0|I had no idea what I was going to be getting into reading this book.  I got the three books in paperback, so felt I should read them.  If  you're into that sort of thing, you might enjoy reading these.  The writing is well done especialty when the author was writing about things she really had never seen.
B007PS0X0W|5.0|This movie is just as good if not better than the movies before it. Great storyline, dialog, and special effects.
B000M5NRLC|5.0|I love this movie!! Definitely a must see for the Christmas holiday season! I like the movie much better than the cartoon :-)
B007H7XJD4|5.0|This movie is just as good if not better than the movies before it. Great storyline, dialog, and special effects.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|The newest Disney release is a great family film... Full of good morals and good laughs, the kids couldn't wait to watch it again! A great movie for young and old!!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|More zombies, more characters, more surprises in the plot. Season 3 has so far been a solid one. As a comic book writer, but not a reader of this series I can get into this series spoiler-free and I'm not bogged down by always comparing the books to the show so I'm sure that has it's advantages.<br /><br />Can't wait to see where we end up by the finale.
B009GEEMLY|5.0|The best of the series; you need to watch Thor and Captain America first in order to appreciate the characters and some of the plot details.
B008RV5K5E|4.0|This is a good adaptation as stated above. Took a while to get into the voice acting not because I dislike Peter Weller's acting, but because I'm such a fan of the work done previously by Kevin Conroy multiple times in this animated role. It started out a bit slow, but eventually it picked up speed. I found this first part to have a decent balance of &#34;talking&#34; scenes as well as action scenes that were in the story to serve a purpose. Some previous DTV DC animated movies are all action and become redundant and almost senseless in spots, but here the action and fight scenes have more weight to them and the storytelling of  the framed moving art is beautiful to watch – never confusing. I can't want to view the second part soon!
B004O3YGMC|1.0|This app presents a wonderful idea, but it is clearly not ready for prime time, at least, not on the Kindle Fire, as of 11/12.<br /><br />The mouse indicator is too small and too difficult to maneuver -- it is impractical to continually zoom in and out to make it workable. The mouse buttons do not work consistently. Thus, navigation is, at best, awkward.<br /><br />Videos brought up with Real Player or Windows Media Player do not play.<br /><br />The device automatically changes resolution on the desktop monitor without explanation or warning.<br /><br />The documentation, what little there is of it, is useless... as is the app itself.<br /><br />The developers should be shamed for putting out such a product.
B009VB97EY|1.0|This is the worst movie we've seen. We kept leaving the room, hoping it would be over when we got back.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|This is one of the best Angry Birds yet -  not easy at all!  Very challenging - I like it.
0765356147|5.0|Throughout this series I have been amazed again and again by Sanderson's genius. He has surprised me at every turn, making the ending to this book, and the series, unforgettable. During the first book the setting was explained, characters introduced, and the series began. In the second book the characters were developed more, a new plot was laid out, and new mysteries were discovered. Finally in the third installment, we see the big picture coming together. We see preservation and ruin, the two con tolling forces of the universe.<br /><br />This trilogy has given me many a night spent in the late hours desperately trying to finish chapters, yet unable to stop reading. I give this book a five out of five for its continuous development of characters, amazing plot, and it originality.
B009JBZH54|5.0|I love batman. I've seen every Batman Movie at least 5 times (except The Dark Knight Rises), l played the crap out of Arkham City and Arkham Asylum, have Batman posters, have Batman pajamas, etc. And now I have this to add to my obsession of Batman.I can't wait to watch the trilogy in Blu-Ray as much as I want, and I also can't wait to have All-Night Marathons of this.In my opinion, Batman is the best superhero. The stories are great, the villians are phenomenal, the costumes are fantastic,and it seems like every Batman movie and T.V show is memorable (except Batman & Robin). Ever since I saw the 3rd movie, I instantly wanted the DVD.
0385535147|4.0|I have read nearly all of John Grisham's books and they never disappoint me, as they're not only entertaining and fast moving, but give one a quick study in the law. And this new one is no exception. Malcolm Bannister, a black lawyer, has been convicted of a crime he didn't commit and is now an inmate of a frederal prison camp when we first meet him. His situation doesn't bode well for him--his wife has left him and he's lost his beloved son--but our boy Malcolm has an ace up his sleeve. A federal judge and his young secretary have been found murdered in a remote lakeside cabin and a safe in the cabin has been broken into and is now empty. What was in the safe, the authorities wonder, and who killed the judge and his girlfriend? There are no clues or fingerprints. But Malcolm knows who the murderer was and what was in the safe (a great deal of money), and he's willing to reveal what he knows in exchange for his freedom. He contacts the FBI and they believe him, up to a point, and release him from prison, but to keep him safe he must enter the witness protection program. Here he undergoes plastic surgery to change his looks, and is given a new name and an entirely new identity. Along the way he acquires a new girlfriend, the gorgeous Vanessa, who becomes a valued helpmate as he has a few scores of his own to settle. The two embark on a journey with lots of surprises that leads to a surprise ending, as Bnnister pulls off his revenge scheme and gets the money.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|The final book in the Hunger Games trilogy finds Katniss alive, but emotionally and physically damaged from her rescue and the consequences to her district. Life in District 13 is regimented in the underground bunkers and she is having a hard time adjusting. Katniss is torn by the wants of the leadership for her to be the figurehead for the revolution and her own misgivings about her position and those left behind when she was rescued. Katniss must chose her path, knowing that it will affect her family and friends. What follows is more death and destruction as the revolution marches on. Katniss comes to many realizations on power, the relentless and cold nature of war and is deeply affected by what she sees and experiences. Without giving more of the plot away, this book takes a more philosophical turn beyond basic survival and choosing between the love of two boys into the real meaning of life and love. This was a somewhat unexpected, but powerful ending to the trilogy and while the ending may not have been entirely to my liking, it fit in with the dystopian world created by the author.
B009YU62H2|5.0|I was amazed at the raw, restless energy of &#34;King Animal&#34;. Chris Cornell not only has one of the finest voices in rock, he has been sorely missed on the charts. Here's hoping that &#34;KA&#34; sells a billion copies and demands a follow-up.
B006CA5NUY|3.0|As artists mature, it's to be expected that there would be an evolution in their musical style. The band Korn is no exception to this rule. While on it's own, the album is good, it is also very much not the band that we have known up till this point. The album is well produced, and often times very catchy. It's a reminder that bands will, and must always change, or drift into obscurity.<br /><br />That being said, I cannot fault them for experimenting with their sound, and for the most part it turned out very well. But as a long time fan of Korn, I have to wonder if this new Korn, is something that I can find myself anxiously awaiting new releases from.<br /><br />If you like Korn, and don't mind a more digital presentation of the band than you have had in the past, then this album will be great for you. If you want to hear the old Korn, then you might not enjoy this.<br /><br />.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|Homeland is exactly what I did not expect. It was like asking a cashier to change a ten, but instead being given the US Treasury.  No punches are pulled from a single character, and it's fascinating to watch each one endure devastating twists every episode.  It expresses how each tier of government (on either side more or less) is marginally navigated by 99 career clowns to one dedicated professional, and how the reality of that is more than any one dedicated professional can bear. Terrific writing.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|This movie is entertaining for adults and kids alike. Love the minions! Looking forward to the sequel that's coming in 2013.
B009SQOGZ2|1.0|I had a very bad experience, u need super kadooper high speed for the purchase.  I'd really appreciate it if I could get the actual DVD since the experience was unsatisfactory
B0091574VI|4.0|Watched with my 10 year old son and we both loved it. Very uplifting story and great movie for the whole family. The scenery and the animals are absolutely breathtaking.
B008ASLNN2|5.0|This movie is a great movie mostly all the scenes are action packed and I like the slow motion from the guys at theslowmoguys on youtube its really amazing and overall a good movie.
B004P4S4NM|5.0|We love Adele and listen to her albums a lot.  She is fantastic and super talented.  All the tracks are great.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|I love this series, and am also watchim<br />ng it on HBO on demand. It is addicting! I am reading first before watching
B0037BB00I|5.0|Our family loves Adele and have been listening to it a ton.  She is super talented and the whole cd is good.
B009KHDT0C|5.0|Saw this movie in the theatre & liked it.  I usually don't buy too many dvd's anymore but if it's got Johnny Depp in it, it's a winner hands down!
B005LAIIHG|5.0|Wonderful and magical. And breathtaking.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I don't think it will do too well at the box office: the marketing for this movie has been so very atrocious I almost didn't watch it.<br /><br />Despite what the previews and promo posters might suggest, it is not yet another derivation of the Jungle Book as a motion picture (not that there is anything wrong with the Jungle Book or any movies or animations it inspired) or some politically correct cultural lesson on things that are Indian.<br /><br />What it is is a singular experience, and it is absolutely beautiful. I have been watching lots of movies ever since I was five years old, and I am having difficult time  coming up with another movie this captivating or visually stunning.<br /><br />I should be a bit ashamed to admit that I have found the majority of Ang Lee's movies rather boring (due to my attention deficit syndrome), but Life of Pi is NOT at all boring. Not even a little bit.<br /><br />This is the kind of movie you definitely need to watch on a big screen, so, folks, go see it while you still can!!!
B003OWVHVC|5.0|Never heard of Aloe Blacc before but glad I bought the CD.  It is great and I'm glad yinz had it for a cheaper price than the stores
030758836X|3.0|RARELY DOES A BOOK COME ALONG WITH CHARACTERS THAT HAVE SO LITTLE REDEEMABLE  OR DECENT PERSONALITIES.  pITY THE POOR CHILD...............
B0054N73EY|5.0|I love their new album.  It is great and I'm glad yinz had it for a cheaper price than the stores
B008QTV3X0|5.0|SIZZLING, INTERESTING AND WELL ACTED.  IT'S ALSO TIMELY AND SEXY.......... TRY THE MANCURIAN CANDIDATE IF YOU LIKE THIS ONE,  SAME IDEA.
B007MS5B6Q|5.0|For the fanatic, it is a must have and great edition to my collection.  It was in perfect condition.  Thanks
B007SGM084|5.0|This is a must read for every woman! It's hot and sexy and definitely a re-read over and over again!
B0075MFS9Y|5.0|This has been one of the best music purchases in 2012. From a sleepy folk band who was barely known when they came to SXSW2012 has blossomed into something everyone can enjoy. Their set at ACL was too big for the stage they were on -- it was that anticipated! The 11 track album puts a spell on its listeners and out of the 30 people I've recommended this album to, only 3 didn't fall in love. Definitely give it a listen. Bonus: \\"Stubborn Love\\" and \\"Ho Hey\\" are on various commercials, so these guys are creating ripples. My guess is they'll be nominated for Best Album alongside Mumford and Sons, Babel.
B000006FNX|5.0|sean connery adds a certain style to all his bond movies.  great movie and i would go on a date with barbara carrera<br /><br />  any day of the week.
098478280X|5.0|I bought this book as I began to prepare for interviews with Facebook and Google. Without this book and its awesome review, I can pretty much say I would not have gotten the position at Facebook (btw I did get offered one).<br /><br />Its not in-depth review on each topic, but it covers everything and helps you recognize what you need to dig deeper on.<br /><br />Best $20 a software engineer can spend
B008U7ZPHS|5.0|Found it very interesting to read.  Still lots of fun in the characters. Would recommend to anyone who wants a combo of modern and ancient history. Nothing too in depth, but lots of fun.
B00A6PD9I4|4.0|We watched this together with our 5 yr. Old daughter. It was a cute movie and I enjoyed it<br />It too but some of the scenes were a little intense for her.
B00A6PD8RQ|1.0|I am an avid Disney/Pixar fan. I was not impressed and am my sure I would let my kids watch this. The animals are a little frightening and it was not a good move.
B006M7JCC2|4.0|I found this book to be very helpful.  The author's experience and mine while not exactly the same are similar enough.  I appreciated reading that at least one other person experienced the same feelings and thoughts that I have during cancer treatment.  It lifted me up.<br /><br />Her writing style was a little difficult to follow at times and a bit repetitive, but the information and validation are worth the wading.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|Well written with a bit of history and a fantastical element.  Highly recommended to anyone who loves vampire novels and/or the Outlander series.
B008U7ZPHS|5.0|It is one of the best books I have readed in my life.  Rick Riordan is one of my favorite writers in the entire world!
6305428042|5.0|Love this fun movie!  I made my own Spell Book and it's awesome!  The three witches are adorably wicked and funny!
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|I enjoyed being introduced to Angry Birds & look forward to other versions ! Angry Birds seem's to be very popular.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|fun and addicting. nice little challenge too. once you start playing you will not put it down. worth the $2.
B00632HWOG|4.0|I like it for my tablet  I would like it better if it was more like Yahoo mail that I use on my computer  I will have to get use to it
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Flow is the most addictive game ever. This game will have you entertained for hours. Be careful though it can get pretty. hard at times. For tiles of you who need a good brain work out this is the game for you. I'he completed most levels. once you get into it you can't stop. GET THIS GAME NOW!!!!!!!
B0094BB4TW|4.0|Using on a tablet.  All comments on a post not visible unless you tap to see all comments.  Will take a little getting use to since it's not like using it on my home computer.  Once I do, I'm sure it will be fine and suit my needs.
B002O3Z50Q|5.0|Brad Pitt does a good job of playing Achiles.  This is a good movie for the entire family to watch.
B000AGTPUU|1.0|The audio is terrible.  The music and train sounds are very loud and the dialogue is so bad that it is almost mute.  Perhaps I received a DVD that is bad or, perhaps, I should have ordered the letter-box version rather thzn the full screen version.  Any comments?
B000V39KDO|5.0|The special effects in this movie are great.  The story line is easy to follow, even for those that do not remember history class.
B005LAIHGI|5.0|This movie is hilarious.  Sasha Baron Cohen is a genius in my opinion.  The satire is great and very relevant.  I will definitely be sending out this DVD, it's too good to sit on a shelf!
B009KS4XRO|1.0|Kept stopping during a game - I wouldn't see the Bingo Numbers.  Wasted my money on purchasing coins for the game and then couldn't use them.  Deleted this game!
B008VVT51U|3.0|I found this movie to be slow and boring and not at all what I expected.  The premise sounded like a comedy but it really isn't.  The characters weren't likeable enough to hold my interest.  Can't recommend this one.
B000ID37RM|5.0|I think we have come a long way since 1932, in relationships between black and white people. I felt anger at the injustice done to a black fellow falsely accused by some people.
B005DJGMQE|4.0|On the night of 14 April 1865, John Wilkes Booth shot President Lincoln. In addition, the plotters aimed to kill the Vice President and Secretary of State, thus eliminating the next 2 successors. Only Booth succeeded.<br /><br />Booth and his conspirators met frequently at the boarding house of Mary Surratt. Her son, John, was involved but it's unclear just how much Mary Surratt knew and how much she aided the plot.<br /><br />This movie depicts the assassination night, and the legal defense of Mary by a reluctant lawyer, Frederick Aiken.<br />Overall, the movie maintains a good sense of historical accuracy, showing the courtroom scenes which were held as a military tribunal rather than in a civilian court. We have the zealous Aiken being true to the Constitutional rights of the accused and imperial government bureaucrats and big wigs who seem bent on railroading a guilty verdict and influencing the sentence.<br />One thing I didn't understand is why they portrayed Frederick Aiken and his wife, Sarah Weston as engaged rather than married. They married 8 years before the action in the movie.<br /><br />The language used seemed to be pointed at current decisions made with respect to the war on terror. In this sense, the producer is making a parallel in the same way that Arthur Miller's Crucible although historically depicting the Salem Witch Trials was a actually a criticism of McCarthyism.<br /><br />Overall, a good drama with history you won't have to \\"unlearn.\\"
B0053Q9DQI|2.0|If you make Jane Eyre into a two hour movie you have to work extra hard to make sure it is not boring and dull, that time was not taken for this adaption.  The director and the writer did not worry about such things as making a good film, they simply took out all the action and replaced with terrible dialog that made you want to fall asleep.  The burning of the house, the accidents, his horrible crazy first wife Bertha, all explained away and not really shown.  The acting, make-up and costumes were wonderful, but it could not save thing boring movie.<br /><br />If you'd like a good movie, see the masterpiece theater version from 2006, four hours well worth it.
1455502758|5.0|This much is clear from Hitchens' ordeals which he recounts with no more or less a scruple of  wit and grace than we must allow him;<br /><br />no excess<br />and no insufficiency<br />just effulgence<br />which like the sun we must allow him<br />which like the sun we must allow in.<br /><br />I'm in stage 4 prostate but simply haven't any hear any near term prospect of the horrors that Hitch has seen, knock on any old wood including Heaven's door.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|Love the sounds and actions.  Also  love how birds depict Star Wars characters.  I am an Angry Birds addict!<br />Can't wait to see what  the next Angry Birds game will be.
B0042RJWTC|5.0|This is, hands down, one of the ~ if not THE ~ best series I've ever seen. I watch is time and again and just LOVE it!!<br />The acting is SUPERB!! If you like movies from this era, you will be glued to the screen just like I was.
B004SBX112|5.0|I AM ADDICTED TO ALL ANGRY BIRD GAMES.  SEASONS IS AWESOME.  CAN'T WAIT FOR THE NEXT VERSION TO BE AVAILABLE.
B003L20IJM|5.0|Having viewed both Nanny McPhee films, as well as the reviews, I was delighted with (the lovely) Emma Thompson's performance, who once again provides that wonderful touch of magic and charm.  As another reviewer put it, and which I agree with completely, Nanny McPhee Returns was charming, funny, touching and intelligent.  Like the first, this is a wonderful family film that I think adults and younger minds will enjoy.<br /><br />In short, I think the positive reviews pretty much dismiss those few negative reviews I've read.  For the price, it's an enjoyable sequel; wouldn't mind having Nanny return just one more time!
B008B1VYP0|5.0|Totally impressed with Adam Levine's vocals. Didn't think I'd be too wild about the commercialization of the band, but  glad to be wrong.
B000002LEE|5.0|Its like jane says - Coming down the mountain!  Super awesome cd - I love every single song on this cd!
B007FEFLTO|4.0|Like many of the reviewers, I`m a huge Follett fan. The first installment in this trilogy was infinitely more readable. I couldn`t wait to dive into this book, but often found it to be tedious. It`s a fabulous refresher course on World War II history, and some of the necessary background information slowed down the usual fly-through-the-pages pace of Follett`s writing. The final third of the book made it worth trudging through the first 800 pages, but the ending (which I will not describe to spoil your read) seemed a bit sophomoric. The writing was just not as elegant as one would expect from Follett.
B00000295Y|5.0|Smoke that bowl - cypress hill rocks sun up til sun down all over the world and all around everywhere!
B008XNZMOU|5.0|It came quickly and I love Taylor Swift. Not typical Taylor music, but it is a good different. Definitely recommend.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|My son and I are both artists and very creative. It gives us a fun way to communicate and play as artists and creative people.  Some of the subjects are so challenging to convey with drawing I cannot imagine how to do that, so it would be cool if illustrations of successful drawings could be browsed once an attempt at a challenge has been attempted and failed or succeeded. Just a thought.  It is entertaining for both of us.  I am 59 and my son is 27 it is interesting to try something new like this to keep our common interests lite.
B00A81MV3U|4.0|\\"Silver Linings Playbook\\" has had Oscar buzz surrounding it for what feels like forever. It first debuted here in Houston during the Cinema Arts Festival earlier this month, but critics, entertainment blogs and magazines, and anyone who's seen the film who has a working mouth and all of their fingers have done nothing but praise this film. Speaking as someone who could care less about what films win awards and what don't, the Oscar campaign revolving around the film is falling on deaf ears. Just focus on being a fantastic film first and let the accolades come to you. \\"Silver Linings Playbook\\" certainly deserves the praise.<br /><br />Eight months ago, a teacher named Pat (Bradley Cooper) came home to find his wife in the shower with another teacher. Pat lost it, was diagnosed as bipolar, and has spent his time in a mental institution ever since. Now, with permission from the court, his mom (Jacki Weaver) has come to take him out. Even though Pat is in his parents' custody and has a restraining order against him, he believes that he and wife Nikki (Brea Bee) are still very much in love. Pat eventually meets Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence) who's also having a rough time since her husband of three years suddenly passed away. Since Tiffany also recently lost her job, Pat begins to realize that the two of them have more in common than he once thought even if they can't stand to be around each other.<br /><br />This is the best Bradley Cooper has ever been. Being one of the few people who's actually a fan of some of his different outings such as \\"Limitless\\" and \\"The Midnight Meat Train,\\" it was still surprising how good he was here. Maybe it's because everyone seems to automatically label him with that raunchy, obnoxious, R-rated comedy label whenever you see his face, but you just don't expect to be taken aback by a Bradley Cooper performance. This is Cooper offering a serious spin on being in a mental institution. His outbursts, his devotion to his wife who hasn't shown any sort of reciprocation, and just his display of raw emotion is undeniably superb.<br /><br />In the same breath, you have to recognize Robert De Niro in this as well. When was the last time De Niro cried in a film? Can you recall? Has he ever? He's so emotional here, which seems extremely uncharacteristic of the 69-year-old actor. His yearning to spend time with Pat, his random OCD, and violent past seems to haunt him now more than anything. It's almost as if he constantly wants all of these things he'll never fully be able to grasp. It's a very different turn for De Niro.<br /><br />Even with the strong performances from both Bradley Cooper and Robert De Niro, \\"Silver Linings Playbook\\" wasn't really as great as everyone was making it out to be until Jennifer Lawrence came along. This is the most adult performance of hers so far and she knocks it out of the park. Tiffany seems completely devoid of emotion at first and is very blunt; sometimes says exactly what's on her mind when she probably shouldn't like Pat. But she begins to open up the more the two of them spend time with one another and it's her chemistry with Cooper that makes the film reach such incredible praise. The scene at the diner is just outstanding as is every time Tiffany surprises Pat when he's out jogging.<br /><br />This is the story of extremely flawed individuals that are written so well that they're easy to relate to. Bradley Cooper and Robert De Niro give career best performances while Jennifer Lawrence proves that we've only seen a glimmer of what she's truly capable of as a talented actress. Laugh out loud funny at times and gut wrenching at others with just the right amount of bleak material to be intriguing and not overly depressing, \\"Silver Linings Playbook\\" is one of the most genuine and human films of the year.sort of reciprocation, and just his display of raw emotion is undeniably superb.<br /><br />In the same breath, you have to recognize Robert De Niro in this as well.

0763619612|5.0|My grandchild is creative but struggling with her interest in reading.  This book is about a subject in which she excels.  I am anxious for her to receive it as a Christmas gift.  The story is great and really inspiring for children or even adults who don't know where to start with art and creative expression.
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|Tightly knit plot, full of suspense. Great read on the bus to work every morning! Now I want to read the rest in the series.
B00A6N7BS0|2.0|cheesy acting weak writing the supporting cast was full a good actors but the no name main guys sucked bad
B00A6PD9I4|4.0|It was a super cute movie.  I watched it with my husband at two little girls (5 & 3 yrs), and we all loved it.
B0095J0AL6|5.0|quick to ship and great quality. My daughter loved getting this year book and CD. This item was great choice for a directioner
B0085MNZ66|2.0|This game is just not interesting, and has not gotten my attention.  I will probably remove this app from my device.
B008458O3S|4.0|Not too overly challenging but a great distraction when on those long waits or at work when you need a little change in the routine
B006YC74E8|4.0|I was actually surprised at how good this app is.  Lots of features and pretty easy to use.  Glad I downloaded it.
B008XNZMOU|5.0|It comes immaculate, no problems with anything. And it arrives before of the expected (just 4 days to Chile). Thanks for the service.
B00A2DOKLU|5.0|Seriously the only reason to get this album is for is raw sexuality. Put this on when you want to hammer out your girl.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I absolutely love this series!  I would give it ten stars if I could.  I hope it runs forever.  I would suggest to anyone who likes this genre to watch.
B0066W1AZK|5.0|I enjoy playing against the computer. It's a good memory builder; keeps you sharp.<br /><br />You'll like it, and the price.
B000UVLK1M|5.0|joni mitchel could not have any better representation of her songs than Herbie hacock and his great guests. the track with tina turner is particularly amazing. I wish whole heartedly tina would do a whole album in this stile of singing.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Wow! what a significant application this is. I recommend it to all.<br />check it and try it out, I'm sure you'll like it.
B00005V1Y0|5.0|A must see. I love this sweet, quirky romance. A classic. Can be viewed and appreciated again and again. never gets old.
B009YU6FJM|5.0|How do you review an album? You either like the type of music or you dont. I love this album like all the other Deftones albums but that is because I am a fan of their music.
B00005O438|5.0|GREAT&#60; GREAT&#60;GREAT&#60; Wonderful, terrific, outstanding, scarey, lovely, scarey, lovely, scarey, lovely, scarey, lovely, scarey, lovely, outstabding and great and wondeful.
B007ZGO7EM|3.0|Nice to have a calculator which is not an extra weight in a ;purse. Makes it possible to be found easily when needed.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|Ok, yeah it's a little glitchy sometimes so that deducted a couple stars.  but listn we are writing reviews of the app itself. like if it loads fast, is it a easy installation. not to be mean but, nobody wants to hear about your enemy tagging you in a picture you didn't want. and how could you even know this if you weren't their friend? (think about) Its on the internet there os no such thing as privacy. anything you have online is probably out thereon Google. So dont complain about friends and privacy. Don't give one star because, &quot;My social life is runed!&quot; Give stars for the app.
B005LAIHZY|1.0|The start of the film may seem like something promising, maybe like a 'How to Train your Dragon' theme. However, the movie quickly turns into a road that has been all too well-traveled. How many movies can you name where the main character doesn't like the situation they are in, turns to witches and magic, doesn't get what they bargain for and the rest of the movie is based on fixing that problem?<br /><br />Answer: too many<br /><br />Obviously, that's where I think the movie lacks originality. Tired of the same ol' thing from Disney. Hoping whoever is left from the original Pixar crew will stand up to what's helped them become such a success story and go back to those unique and fresh elements.<br /><br />Just an honest opinion, but another movie with this same plot and Pixar will RIP in my book.
B00785P2QC|5.0|This is a really great game for those who like virtual games! it goes down to the smallest details in building your city, like setting your trash truck and bus routs and even delivering your factory items to the \\"s-mart\\" for people to buy and the great thing about the game, is that you still earn money when your not even in the game and when you come back nothing except the amount of money you have is diffrant. The only problem I have with the game is that to do some of the objectivs you have to have a facebook. :( other than that, I love the game!
B005D81W5Q|5.0|If your looking for something funny to watch without having to think much, this is it. You want action, depth or tears, go watch Lifetime. It is that simple.<br /><br />This is a movie about teacher Elizabeth Halsey (Cameron Diaz) who has dreams of marrying rich so she dresses and appears this certain way to keep up this persona so she can get a rich husband. Her fiance dumps her and she winds up broke and back to teaching, She meet Amy Squirrel (Lucy Punch) who is clearly gay and wants Halsey, but because Halsey \\"doesnt eat muff pie\\" Squirrel sets out to destroy Halsey. The Gym Teacher (Jason Segal) is clearly into her while Halsey is clearly into the new sub (Justin Timberlake) because he comes from money.<br /><br />She smokes pot, drinks booze in class, subjects her students to watch movies, dresses totally awesome and has the greatest one liners ever. Last, she also cheats on the state exam. Eventually she buckles down and takes teaching seriously, but even that is for an incentive.<br /><br />Here is the reality, teachers are not really like this. Schools and principals are not this oblivious. It is a movie probably written by someone who wished school was like this and honestly, I do too. She is a woman sadly living real life. Thats its. Like I said, you want entertainment and to laugh, this is it. You want something more meaningful, try Netflix.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Great book can't wait to read the third book. One of the best books I've read in a while. Thanks
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|I love this version! C3PO, R2D2, jedis with light sabers... It's great fun! works fine for me on mobile and tablet.
1451638450|5.0|This, under the stunner fire, is a love story.<br />It is very well told, with many surprises, and many just well done words. As a writer I am trying to learn how she does it. One thing I noted is that she does not do cliffhangers: she resolves each chapter in a way that you want to know what comes next,<br />but with that chapter firmly resolved.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|great game and easy to use. first levels and smaller grid pretty easy buy challenging the more u get into it. addicting!
B005FRF6PC|5.0|Get inside Rafa's head.  Reading this gives you a lot of &#34;ah ha&#34; moments especially into his style of play.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|I love Angry bird games!  I had no idea how much of a challenge this game would be!  Thank you!
B000MAH5O2|1.0|Horrible. proves that we have a dangerous moron in the white house. socialism and spending are th e agenda. we are doomed with him in charge
B0060CTLOI|4.0|Well obviously this was for the kids, and I am assuming because it says Disney on it you have to purchase an HD version. Good movie though
B000N2HCM4|1.0|. its obvious that he wanted nothing to do with his mothers family from an identity standpoint no matter how well they raised and treated him
B009Z8HPYM|5.0|Great new sounds from Neil and Crazy Horse.  Classic sounds of Neil's guitar and unique voice (love it or hate it) plus Crazy Horse.  Been a huge fan of Neil since Heart of Gold, CSN&Y, etc.  I really liked this download, almost as much as the 2 Decade Albumns (vinyl) the I wore out years ago.  Any fans out there, add this to your collection.
B005AERS74|5.0|I really enjoy this album! Maroon 5 delivered with their usual upbeat and catchy music. Buy this album and dance around!
B004UNX1LS|5.0|what a great app. you can watch all the latest videos in high quality with great sound anytime and anywhere.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|I love it!  I think Rovio keeps getting better and better - Every time they release a new game, it has me anxiously awaiting the next!  Keep up the great work!
B002WV5A9G|5.0|Every year for Thanksgiving we watch a science fiction film. This year, It was this one. Ran well, was what I thought it was. Easy rental I didn't have to leave my house- a big deal when Black Friday started six hours early!
B0052RDHTM|4.0|This was a fun read.  Loved learning more about world war 1.  The characters were interesting and represented a good perspective of their country and personal ideals!  Loved it
B0020M99LC|3.0|Very poor audio - impossible to understand.<br /><br />In order to reaach required<br />number of words:<br /><br />  Very poor audio - impossible to understand.
B009KYXEY6|1.0|As with multiple reviews on the cd the last three tracks on Born To Die are missing ! Very dissapointed with Interscope, but Amazon was very helpful accepting the return.Don't buy for a gift until we're sure product and advertising are fixed or someone may be dissapointed Xmas day !!!!
B009WO7NQO|5.0|I love this so much.  Graphics and sound are great.  Makes me giggle when I play it.  Very creative. Success!
B000IZ7YK6|5.0|For film noir buffs, and indeed all fans of cinema, this is a not-to-be-missed movie!  Every aspect is absolutely top shelf!
B0063GORYU|5.0|Terrific game!!  Love the four levels of difficulty.  It almost always gives you a feeling that you're going to win, but it certainly isn't that easy.  Very very addictive!!
B0076DCT2G|2.0|White plastic chairs and John Corey's  sarcastic remarks throughout the narrative pulled it down.  This is my last DeMille novel.....well maybe not...but this one was disappointing.
B009HV2JT8|2.0|When I was watching this movie, I felt like some one picked up the book, read the back, and thought, &#34;Hey, this would make a great movie.&#34; They then summarized the back of the book for someone else, who wrote the screenplay based on that. The book was AMAZING, especially in how the author combined historical and fantasy. Abe Lincoln worked hard to get strong enough to fight vampires. There was none of this super-hero chopping trees with one swipe cause of his feeling crap. Read the book, skip the movie.
0896762629|5.0|If you are familiar with Janet Arnold's work, then there is nothing for me to add.  If you are not, you need to be.  Ms. Arnold in all of her work expands ones knowledge of clothing over the centuries through her exhaustive study and explanations in both word and image - a must for serious clothing historians.
B00A6PD9I4|3.0|It's a kids show - and its OK.  Watched it because it is associated with &#34;How to Train your Dragon&#34;, which was great.
B008CP93S0|5.0|Hilarious! This movie had me dying laughing from beginning to end! Be prepared for some full frontal though! Lol! :)
B007FEFLTO|4.0|To me, this second book of the Century Trilogy is less compelling than the first, but it is still historically accurate and fascinating for its characters and the enormous scope of the subject.
B006MW3UZW|4.0|Fairly soap operay, but entertaining.Actually. Upstairs Downstairs has better acting and is less of a soap opera. The settings and costumes are wonderful and Maggie Smith is superb.
0307346617|4.0|I picked this up, thinking it would be a decent zombie/thriller/comedy/drama, good for a couple-three afternoons. I didn't expect to be reading a fascinating collection of short narratives posed by a variety of characters over the span of exactly what the title implies. Separated out into various points in the war, it's often quite realistic, and provokes a desperately-needed fresh look into the genre. Definitely worth the buy.
B009RI4FRU|3.0|Two strange kids falling in love theme made an over rated movie in my view.  The movie \\"Deep Impact\\" made better use of this theme as well as weaving a more complex and exciting story line.  The quirky kids and strange parents in Moonrise Kingdom just barely held my interest.  This is an old story going back to the times of Romeo and Juliet, Like Shakespere, you could also call this a tragedy only from an entertainment standpoint.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|AWESOME SEASONS! We  look forward to every episode.It's one of the best shows I' ve ever watched. Great special effects specially in the zombies.....
B008ASLK8A|5.0|Spell binding.  Different than the first, but kept you interested.  It left room for a subsequent episode.  Would recommend as a gift.
B009CPE424|4.0|Fun for whole family. Humor and laughs abound. We saw first two Dog lovers will love this movie.and this one didnt disappoint.
B000YHG72E|5.0|Cant go wrong with Will Ferrell! Love this movie and so does my 18 year old son and 13 year old daughter. Great for all ages!
B008CP93S0|3.0|Even Jennifer Anistons mediocre performance didnt make this movie go down in flames. At least its different from the same flowing stream of movies Hollywood expects us to swallow. All the while the movie does manage to give you a laugh or two in the midst of its theme of bucking traditional lifestyles to explore and find whats best for you. Not for kids eyes please. But a pleasant surprise.
B00A77II0U|5.0|Oh,  man this one is good! Definitely the best I've found,  and I have downloaded just about every game of this type. The cut scenes are movie quality,  and the storyline is creepy &amp; exciting. So so so good.
B0046UGSNS|2.0|Still leaves me wondering what the point was? I mean on the surface it was mice to see a family go through family problems as a married lesbian couple. However,<br /> throwing in the biological father would have been enough on its own, the affair, another obstacle, but the twist felt forced and upset the balance of the film, which then took focus off of the &#34;kids being alright&#34;.
B007J2TMQ0|4.0|reading this book puts a very different idea of the horrors under which the war was fought. it makes the lives of the &#34;normal&#34; soldier much more real.
B0098VYCCE|3.0|I wish Kristen Stewart would learn to emote. In the real world and the acting world...nevertheless her fellow actors drag this film up from her dark depths of voidism and put together a very adult Snow White tale. It could have been better but it appears the studio was going for the twihards to boost weekend box office sales instead of casting accordingly. Worth a mention are Chris Hemsworth and Theron, both did outstanding work here.
B004YM6JLO|5.0|ENJOY THE VAMPIRE MOVIES.SPECIAL TREAT DURING HALLOWEEN WEEK.MOST DEFINITELY RECOMMEND IF YOU ARE A TRUE VAMPY.HOPE THE SAGA CONTINUES ANOTHER SEASON.
B0095R64AO|3.0|Not what was expected from this film. Drags on a little like an actual five year engagement might only to end with the couple feeling worn and already married. Not much point in rooting for them cause you dont care one way or other by the end. Highlight from film were supporting characters who are dr. with main character. Thiers linea are witty and bring commical relief. Which you will need if you choose to watch.
B003RNXIBK|5.0|I LOVE this album, probably because I relate to it very well. I've been dealing with depression the past couple of years, and am starting to come out of it. I understand what Eminem is talking about in so many of these songs....and I appreciate very much that the music is positive, the lyrics are uplifting and speak of getting better, stronger, healthier. There are of course songs that don't cover this topic, but I rate the album 5 starts because it is a genuine work of art that has encouraged me to keep walking the road of recovery.
B009KHDT0C|2.0|I love JD and Michelle Pfiefer ever since Greae Two but this movie felt like it had multiple personalities. It felt Disneyesc with a bit of amatuerish flare. The comedy wasnt that humorous and the dark not dark enough. Overall they left it open for a sequel which I hope isnt on JD to do list. Skip it...and if I say this, one who gives most movies the benefit of the doubt...dont waste your money.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Fast-moving, clever dialogue, with  a singular edgy humor - well developed, complex yet authentic characters in parallel professional and personal storylines - highly recommend
B00A6PD9I4|3.0|The movie was mediocre at best. Storyline threw me when the mother turned into a bear... And the whole time I was suppose to feel like the daughter was learning somthing about herself? Beautiful animation, not enough adult humor to override this very simple, child driven film. Im not saying that wasnt the point, grwat little film for the kids, kust be prepared to read a book while its on if you are the adult.
B000059TFO|5.0|Ordered this for a friend an she loved it! She just loves to watch this movie. Although kinda hard to watch.
B008JH5CVS|3.0|Love science fiction, action, and government oversyepping boundaries, well then tgis movie is for you. Not for those who dislike violence or that videogame feel, but it turned out to be an enjoyable night at the movies.
B000002JK4|4.0|I was never a big Zeppelin fan, though I did like some of their music.  But when Robert Plant's piece, &#34;Big Log&#34; played<br />on MTV in the early days of music videos, I found the song captivating.  So about 25 years later, I decided to purchase<br />the CD really just for that song.  The price was very low, and I am very glad I have it.  Not much else to say about it.
B009329ZF2|3.0|If you are looking for the next oscar winners you wont find that here. However if you love action, savung the world, and good old fashioned kicking alien rearend then this one is for yoy. Enjoy my earthling commrads!
B008QTVNUI|5.0|Loved it... Now watching the second season.... Its amazing. My husband and I watch episode after episode and I cant seem to get anything else done..
B008JAGZDE|4.0|What did they want from another movie in this franchise. Albeit the fact that the reunion comes at a wier time and is explained away in a one liner and we all are suppose to buy inyo it the movie only had 90minutes to catch you up on your old favorite characters. It was innapropriate, raunchy, full of crude humor, and had the same feel this movie is famous for. Would it be nice to spend time eith the gang on a more mature level, sure. However, that wouldnt be an American Pie movie, it would be some melodramtic bore.
B0091REZMW|3.0|This is a hidden-objects game with quests to complete.  Entertaining and good if you like hidden-object games, but the one component I think they should either do without or improve is the &#34;energy&#34; component; every time you enter a room it costs you energy (similar to farmville and pioneer trail on facebook).  Either reduce the time it takes to get the energy or do away with it so you can just play the game.
B0083P1QUM|2.0|I felt that this wasn‘t  Cornwell‘s best effort at all. There was too much of the same old introspective carrying on, and an unsatisfactory plot conclusion.
B007GOTJ6Y|5.0|What a great group of boys! Not as good as there new CD...but I am still a Directioner! Love this group!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I couldn't put the book down, I have read through the series 5 times now! seriously one I couldn't put down!
1589946006|5.0|I bought this bag as a display gift and was not at all disappointed with the result.<br />This bag comes with many differing sizes of Cthulhu statues. They are all durable and attractive and I find them to be wonderful for decoration around the house for any Cthulhu mythos lover.
B009WUAK2M|4.0|I usually watch action movies with my husband. So, I know almost all of the main stars/heroes from them. If you have watched those movies, then you will probably enjoy this one. It's an action-packed movie with appearances from all your favorite action stars (almost-I think they have a few more they can add).<br /><br />The little remarks and references to the old movies makes you smile and even laugh out loud. The comedy touch keeps the movie from getting too intense, while still giving an adrenaline rush.<br /><br />One very gross part-you'll know it when you see it. Ewwww<br /><br />I would recommend this movie.
B00A12VW86|4.0|Enjoyed it much more than UNO. Although UNO has begun to grow on me. Many of the songs have a foxboro hot tubs sound to it. Billie Joe finally gets to rock out many guitar solos in this album which is a change. Very uptempo flow to the album. Can't wait to see what they have in store for tre!  Highly recommend it to any green day fan
B009VB97EY|4.0|I really couldn't wait to see this movie...I thing that Channing Tatum is definitely the &#34;sexiest man alive&#34;. It is an entertaining movie and I thought the ending was adorable!
157421327X|5.0|A beginners Zentagle, introducing the concept, explaining the technque, and delving into the fun and intrigue of random yet controlled doodling.
B007TNS6JI|3.0|Controla are awsome, graphics are great . Sometimes the screen choices dont react to my touch. Deff. get this as a free game
B0092C2X7U|2.0|If you don't turn off the blood and you have bad timing then you just walk away from this feeling bad about abusing this guy.
B008VBYN80|4.0|Great game.Needs to change way it finds friends.Ive been playing a week and I think im the only one who owns the game.
B004OZOTSQ|5.0|I really do love it! By far one of the best apps that would allow me to transfer files between my PC, Phone and Kindle! The only thing I didn't like is the fact that the Android version I bought for my phone was not recognized by the Kindle but it only cost me an extra $1 so I digress...
B00338QENI|5.0|Although I knew somewhere in the back of my mind that someone's cells were being used for breakthroughs in modern science, I never imagined the human side of the story about the family and the doctors.  Ms. SKloot wrote a factual, touching, and very amazing book about something she felt strongly about.  And yet, she was able to tell the story and the science while making the reader able to form one's own opinions about the secrecy, the lack of privacy of the family, and - it seems - the lack of empathy of the doctors and scientists who used a woman and her family.  The story of Henrietta Lacks is something that everyone should know about.  We all owe so much to the memory of Henrietta Lacks; we owe much more to her family.  And we owe ourselves the knowledge of how this sad and wonderful event happened in our world. Thank you, Rebecca Skloot, for your time, your patience, and your abilty to tell this story.
B008458O3S|5.0|This is a Great game and very challenging the farther you go!  I would recommend this game for all ages!
B000HKW7E0|5.0|I have however not watched it yet.  But it looks great and arrived in a timely manner. It is a Christmas present for my daughter.  It is my favorite Christmas movie.  Beverly
B007Q0OV6Q|5.0|I purchased this for my nephew who LOVES Star Wars.  This will be a fun/daily activity to do through December.
B004FRX0MY|4.0|Needs an equalizer function, and genre tab, as well as adaptability to change album arts when I change them, but other than that, it's a solid music app. Just improve.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I wasn't sure if I would like this trilogy, since it was slated as teen reading.  I pleasantly surprised to really enjoy these books!  Great story line and not your &#34;run of the mill&#34;.
B0068AWO00|5.0|It took vampire's out of the meta-sexual depressed realm of &#34;Interview with a vampire&#34;, &#34;Twilight&#34;, and brought it back to a durable, eating and killing machine in a modern world.
B008NW67E0|5.0|If you liked &#34;Sigh No More&#34; then you should get &#34;Babel&#34;. Key tracks(for me anyways) are &#34;I Will Wait&#34; and &#34;Ghosts We Never Knew&#34;. I don't see their style of music falling out of circulation any time soon.
B0098VYCCE|4.0|Good movie, not what I expected but a good play on a classic. I would recommend it to friends. Well worth the time to watch.
B005WUHAX8|1.0|Damged upon arrival!!Noooooooooooootttt a good product!<br />Do not recommend the product at all. Do not buy thi a t allllllll !
B000ICZD4I|5.0|wish it was on prime its a true moviie i love it one of the best all time movies i have seen in a long time
B0086DBE62|5.0|The movie was adorable and funny.  It was the perfect movie for the whole family to enjoy.  I have a 9yr old boy, 10 yr old girl and 12 yr old boy and they all liked it.  The humor and fighting scenes kept the boys interested while the strong princess character, beautiful costumes and humorous scenes kept my daughter wanting more.  I highly recommend this movie for families.
B008XG1X18|1.0|utility unclear. I cannot see any clearcut advantage to this vs. Facebook. this is too much of a &quot;me too&quot; bit of software.
B0098VXBIA|2.0|The movie had some funny moments but overall it was boring and predictable.  If you saw the previews, you already saw the only good parts of the movie.
B000067IZ3|5.0|Movie was great and the viewing of it on my kindle was great..enjoyed it immensely..will probably view it again even though I own it on DVD..
B009MF5BXK|1.0|My word! They would have TROUBLE MAKING A WORSE MOVIE! We walked out about 50 minutes into the movie. We expected junk with a few laughs. It actually called into question the IQ of any person willing to watch it. I always enjoyed the dumb 1980's action movies. But this was pathetic!
B007SAKY42|5.0|I was hardly familiar with Blur when I ordered this set.  I had only just recently become a HUGE fan of Gorillaz and decided to take a chance that I would enjoy earlier Blur.  What a surprise.  The quality of the jackets, sleeves and vinyl is top-notch.  Sound quality is amazing.  Very quickly Blur became one of my top bands.  I really can't say enough positive things about this set.  No regrets whatsoever.
0553801473|2.0|I'm a big fan of the series, but I've lost a little faith in Martin. If I could use one word to describe this book its disappointing. The pace slows down considerably for this one and frankly it doesn't add much to the story. Maybe its because I'm not invested in them but the new characters are not very interesting. The old characters seem to be to busy doing unimportant thing to advance the plot. There is a lot of repetitiveness as well.<br /><br />I really hope the next book is better because I really look forward to a good conclusion to a what otherwise has been a great series.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Though he uses slightly different voices here (and in first and third person) Grisham once again delivers the engaging read you expect from him. His wry social and political commentary - and his delightfully lowish opinion  of the legal profesion- come through in simple comments/thoughts from his characters. Wonderfully twisty plot. And I loved the Author's Note at the end where he fesses up that he made all of it up, being particularly lazy with this book- or so he claims. Perhaps, but The Racketeer delivers everything I expect when I see 'Grisham' on the spine.<br /><br />All these books (and years) into John Grisham's career- and I still can't wait for the next one. He's pretty much the only (semi) legal thriller type writer I still read ...at least most of his books are touch ground in some way with the legal system. He's one of the few authors who can make me smile or laugh out loud as he tells the story...<br /><br />There' something wonderfully Southern in the way John Grisham weaves a tale, and a taste of Will Rogers in his view of our politicians, legal system-law enforcement (often including the FBI these days),  the media  and our society.<br /><br />Beyond the story, Grisham effortlessly leads you to think 'why of course that's completely crazy-absurd'...'that' being whatever he's decided to poke a little fun at, shine a some light on in a particular passage... something you more than likely saw on TV or heard about recently in the news. His finger remains softly on the pulse of the country. As our times change, so do those things he works into his latest book. And he sometimes educates the reader a bit (at least this reader) by providing a bit of 'this is how it works' insight or info..<br /><br />This stuff is pretty much gravy because at the heart of a Grisham book is a good story and a hero (here, perhaps an anti-hero)  you begin to care about quickly.<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed The Racketeer. And once again can't wait for the next book. Even the short ones are great.
B004XDYJRU|5.0|This is a great radio.I get stations from all over the world. listen to classical music. I would recommend it to friends,
B007QPFGJW|3.0|I found this book to be eerie and scary--it deals with the drug scene in Oslo, Norway, with the ultimate death of the main protagonist.  There are a number of unanticipated twists and turns, but ultimately leaves one with a sadness of the addiction that rules lives.  Well written
B000ICXQHE|3.0|Another well written, well acted suspense story.  Nothing all that new or intriguing but a good escape on a quiet evening.
B009CPES4I|4.0|This movie provides a thoughtful perspective on aging and the new possibilities that arise later in life. Each of the elderly English characters (with amazing performances) chooses a low-cost retirement in India, surrendering a familiar vision of their lives for the practical necessities of life in a (cheaper) foreign place.  The world they enter feels chaotic, boisterous and gorgeously colored, while presenting novel opportunities and temptations.  Set in the almost dreamlike hotel, and in its young manager's (Dev Patel of Slumdog Millionaire and Newsroom) dreamlike ambitions, each character's path unwinds to an unexpected result. A tidy, conventional and (for me) satisfying character-driven drama, with the rare, unhurried pace of maturity and the rich performances of a superb cast.
0393312836|5.0|Brilliant - Brilliant - Brilliant<br /><br />If you can see past the gore and the sex, then this is a book of a generation.<br />Quality writing brings this story to life.<br /><br />I have never seen the movie because I don't want to spoil my opinion of this book - this is a must read!
B004GJDQT8|5.0|I realky love this app its very useful has everything you need and fir the most part they delivered as advertise

B0043RSK3K|2.0|Way too long.<br />The content is ok<br />Way over the top vocabulary.<br />Could have said the same with much less
B008HK3XU4|5.0|This makes it easy to watch everything I have downloaded.  I use it at home and on the road.  In fact, it went from the U.S.A. all the way to Europe and back again.  I will always take it with me, whenever I leave home!  I would recommend this for anyone who has a Kindle Fire HD 7&#34;.  By the way, I got purple to match the cover of my iPhone, but it comes in many others.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Terrific<br />Never knew what was was coming<br />Couldnt wait for the conclusion for the right reasons.<br />Grishham still the best<br /><br />Great ending
B009MF5BXK|5.0|This one tops the first Expendables by a mile.  To see Stallone go toe to toe with Van Damme was fantastic.  If only they had done this twenty years ago.  I have to wonder why a project of this magnitude couldn't have been done a long time ago.  It would have been better to have seen Stallone fight when he was at the peak of his fame.<br /><br />For any action fan this was a non-stop train ride.  If you like the genre or a just want a solid action film, this is the one to get.  If , like myself your dollars are on a budget, get this one before any other action film.  It delivers.  The extras in this version give you a history of the best of the best.  Everything from the director's commentary to the mini-documentaries are top notch.  Usually, these collaborations are overly long.  However ,Stallone gave everyone here a chance to shine.  He left no stone unturned.  I'll be there for expendables three, four and five!
B008QTVNUI|5.0|well-acted, well-written, exceptionally good series. I would recommend it to anyone and I can't wait to watch the next season.
B009HV2JT8|3.0|It held my interest for the whole movie.  It's not a great work of art but for a lazy evening with some popcorn or pizza it does satisfy.
B0086700CM|5.0|you earn money or coins while running with that money you can get characters and upgrades. this game is awesome.  you can even learn achievements
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Great mindless fun for my long commute. Runs well on my phone. I wish the you didn't have to purchase hints.
B0086213XW|4.0|This was a funny, strange little movie, but I really enjoyed it. It was well acted and kept my interest the entire way through. It avoided a lot of the usual cliches.
B00005N6KG|5.0|I bought these to use with my 7&#34; tablet. They're light, plastic and powerful, and I don't have to worry that they'll injure the screen if they touch. Great deal!
B009GEBBNQ|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie. I like it so much I decided to watch Captain America, which I also enjoyed. This one was fun and kept the plot moving along.
B008GFI418|3.0|As a big Beatle fan I always felt George Martin was the true fifth Beatle. Just listen to the \\"Let It Be\\" LP, somethings missing from that album, and it's George Martin, the only Beatle album he didn't produce. There's something missing from this DVD, and it's the Beatles. I was hoping for more Beatles on this DVD, but that 's on me. It covered all of Martin's work. I just felt a little more time could've been spend on the one thing he produced that made him REALLY famous, The Beatles.
B008M34INW|2.0|It was pretty dark and violent. I didn't love it. I thought PAYBACK was much better, it was violent but it was so well done I didn't mind. This one, not so much.
B0063IH60K|5.0|who doesn't love Solitare. One of my favorite games and this one is just as awesome!! Played daily more than once a day!
B008Z9YLV2|4.0|This was very well done. I liked it, it wasn't nearly as sad as I thought it would be. I know I won't be watching any of the rest of the movies, though, because I know the books get sadder and sadder.
B009KHCRVO|4.0|This is from Finland, and is a comedy!<br />Good to great acting , wonderful f/x and music!<br />The story is funny. If you like 1941, you will love Iron Sky,...I did!
B0085A9HXS|5.0|My younger brother doesn't get excited about many things, but after seeing the Raid, he couldn't shut up about it. I was skeptical, but when I finally saw it, I loved it. A martial arts action movie hasn't got me this excited since Ong Bak. The fights are brutal and feel realistic with people getting exhausted.<br /><br />I describe it as the martial arts level of Ong Bak, the grim reality of Old Boy, and a similar setting/premise of Dredd 3D, all of which I love.
B00A6PD9I4|4.0|This movie is so cute and has some very funny satire in it.  The technical production is excellent.  Would recommend it to ANYONE!!
B004KKX80A|5.0|bought as gift for grandson, its the one he wanted, he will go nutz, cant wait to see his face on christmas eve!!!

B007J4T2G8|5.0|Could not put this book down.  Fifty Shades of Grey kept my interest throughout.  Was really surprised at the ending.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|I gave four stars only because I wanted to focus more on the plots as some of the love scenes got too repetitave. However I enjoyed the book the first one was better can't wait to read the third.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Great movie and a great price.  This movie was our first 3D movie purchase and our kids have been playing it non-stop.  The 3D effects are so much better at home than the theaters.
B0048WQDIE|4.0|Brilliant, subversive, dark and dangerously funny - what more do you want from a war novel? Oh yes, death. There's plenty of that amidst all the madness!
B007NCSQFO|2.0|I did not realize how persistently foul Nicki Minaj's song lyrics were until I hear this unedited album. Even the couple songs that are popular on the radio are spoiled by the language, without being edited. I had intended to give this to my daughter, but after listening to several of the tracks decided it does not deserve to be shared.
B007OLYQ4E|4.0|This wonderful novella has lost none of its magic over the years. Capote is an extraordinary writer and Holly is one of his most memorable and enduring characters. Forget the film - read the book!
0345803485|5.0|This book was great! It takes you into the mind and life of Christian and Anastasia.  It shows you that two strange people from different backgrounds can love as you. I can say that I didn't even get into the mist of the love making parts. It was the way that no matter what, they wanted each other happy. This is not normal in this world to to escape to someone's else life is amazing. It was well worth the trilogy and I didn't want it to end. Christian a very rich man way beyond his means fell in love with a woman who had to normal his life out. The way he was written could blind every woman vision in another man. He was the perfection of grace, charm and looks with no outside flaws. He had a smile to die for and the smell to lust for.  With all the money in the world he had a flaw that no worth could cure but, her love was the one thing that could cure him. Anastasia a pretty normal female who didn't see her on worth in life but the love of this man changed ever thing in her life. She did normal things and lived a basis life. She had a hidden inner glamour that only her could bring out. She secretly had a hidden need and Christian from the beginning knew he could grab and Own It.  Trust is the one thing that they both had to overcome but it was well worth it.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Narrated by Death during WWII, Zusak richly describes the experiences and hardships of the characters and the complications of life during wartime.  I appreciate Death's commentary as the narrator, as it offers insights and foreshadowing without spoiling the story.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|To start with Him is like a dream come to.  Gideon Cross was a man who knew what he needed in life and had no problems going after it.  He demanded his needs and had no problems taking it.  He was sexy with every essence of his being. Body, hair, smell and swag to die for. Gideon had hidden secrets that haunted him so uncontrollable that no one woman was allowed to share his bed with him. Until he meet this one woman who was able to consume every inch oh his No flaws. He wasn't able to tell this woman no even when he knew he should. But her secret would lead him to the unthinkable act of all that should take their world on another emotional roller coaster journey in the next chapter<br />I can't wait until May 2013
B0090P98Z4|5.0|I am enjoying this game and it's not like those limited repetative boring ones. It looks great on my kindle fire and easy to use.

B009329Y30|4.0|The Lucky One is a romantic film that contains elements of mystery, destiny, and attractive actors. It is somewhat predictable in its outcome, but the journey getting there is appealing. I liked it.
B0053O89Z6|5.0|I love this show.  I'm not going to waste time giving an episode-by-episode rundown...if you're considering buying the 7th season, I think it's fair to assume that you've seen this show before and that you already like it.  Enough said.  :)
B009CPJHY4|5.0|\\"The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel\\" - Great story, well acted; and I enjoyed the experience of watching it. Judy Dench is wonderful, and I appreciated all the characters. It was very honest. I would definitely watch it again.

B008MG1E4A|5.0|This is one of those books that you read from cover to cover in one setting. As non military personel, I found this book fascinating.
B0080SZ0V8|4.0|This is a fun game to play while killing a bit of time.  The games are not too challenging but just challenging enough to keep interesting.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I grew up on games in general. It's entertaininly fun. I played this while sitting at the mechanics. Even one a few games !!
B005LAIH4A|5.0|Great movie about taking care of this earth for what little time we are here to inhabit it. It teaches kids that the actions we take today has a consequence (good and/or bad) for the future.
B003NFM3JK|5.0|All though this an animated movie it is hard to tell the animation from live. The animation allows for greater visual interpretation then what can be provided by live action. The effects are outstanding. The story line is very close to the written word. So in the whole I have hugely enjoyed this movie.
B0046W5E0Y|5.0|one of the best cartoon movies i have ever watched.  graphics were really good. i am sure kids would love it
1557048630|5.0|A friend's young son really liked this movie & I've been meaning to pick this up for him b/c he likes to draw.<br />I'm glad that this book has illustrations of both the Dragons & Vikings.<br />The kid is having a blast reading this book & drawing his favorite dragons. :-)
B009HSVHV2|5.0|KISS comes through again! Better than Sonic Boom. My favorite KISS CD since Lick it up! I would highly recommend this to any KISS fan.
B005P4PAVK|5.0|Great Show: My granddaughter and I enjoy watching these episodes. We watch them more than once. That is about it.
B009NQKPUW|4.0|It was a decent movie altogether, but it wasn't anything like I thought it was going to be. It was really weird to be honest.
B005LAIHZE|4.0|InThe scheme of things a very entertaining movie. Definately worth owning in your library. Great visual effects. Buy it you will be glad you did.
B0091XRL86|5.0|of course its got hidden adult low brow jokes, but its got some action and twists, and lets see if your kids get the secret of the pirates &#34;friend&#34;
B000GYI32M|5.0|The seller sent it brand new and I seriously watched it in about a day... But beware, you'll be really sad to know this is the last light-hearted season. So enjoy!
B009NQKPUW|3.0|the special effects were good, but it leaves you with more questions than answers... like lost, but not corny, good way to make more films
B0009K7QZ8|5.0|If you're getting a late start on the OC, don't stop! I made fun of it when I was younger and it first came out, but now I'm one of those girly weirdos who refers to the characters like my bffs haha. It's so good :)
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|cant wait for the next one, yeah go iron man. . . . . . . . . . .
0345803507|5.0|The world really knows whats hot! I heard about this book every where and just had to read it. I am so glad I did. Now you can't put it down!
B0036SSZIC|5.0|Great movie- gets you thinking about things. Michael Moore nails this movie, a must see for those that are working people.
0345803485|5.0|This book is....OMG! or should I say OH MY! You really can not put the book down. Love the way you get happy, sad, mad, hot, and so hot, E L James is a genius!
B008Z9YGEE|5.0|Pretty true to the book.  Everyone enjoyed the movie.  Like the ease of renting the movie on Amazon.  Would use again.
0425263908|5.0|Sylia Day is one of my favorite writers, she really knows how to keep you in the book. This book is super good and I really need to read the next one! I can't wait.
0425263916|5.0|I absolutely loved this book.  Cant wait for the follow up in the next book to come. Keeps ya interested, great story line and well written.....
0425263916|5.0|This was a great follow up to the first book, I can't wait for the next one! I need to know what happens next!
B009GEOLM4|5.0|After renting it via streaming it through Amazon Prime, I had to immediately buy it. Probably one of the best Batman stories ever told. Bruce Timm and the gang did an outstanding job of turning this into a two part movie. I don't know if this was intentional, but they did a great job of even showing how the Dark Knight Rises adapted scenes from the book. The movie doesn't follow the book exactly, but that is mostly so that they could turn this into a two-part movie. For those who may be skeptical by that last sentence, don't be. They do a fantastic job at creating a very self-contained story and then create a little cliffhanger to set up the second part.<br /><br />The story is great. The animation is great. The music is great. Heck the whole movie is great. I wouldn't recommend this movie to little kids, but to young adults and older, this is a must see.
1455508977|5.0|This book was so good. the author kept me in suspense waiting for the next thing to happen. The characters were well written. The ending took me by surprise, but a good one none of the less.
0446580848|5.0|As a huge Nelson DeMille fan, I couldn't wait to read the newest.  It did not disappoint.  Love it.  Love it. Love it.
0345803493|5.0|I love me some grey! I love the inner goddess as well. This book is super good, very well written.
B009NQKPUW|4.0|Nice movie, everything about it was put together a good look for you SiFi fanatics hope to see more of the same
B0023SDPS6|3.0|Found it hard slugging...too slow.  Only read part of it, and put it down.  Lost interest...so I never finished it.
1401937268|4.0|Love that the cards have positive messages.<br />I have small hands so need to find a way to shuffle that doesn't tire my hands.
B0098VXBIA|5.0|I've already watched this movie three times. It is witty and absolutely hilarious.  It has some great actors in it too.
B000I9UA8U|5.0|I'm not sure why I never went to see this movie when it first came out, but a current infatuation with Robert Carlyle as Mr. Gold/Rumplestiltskin on Once Upon a Time led me to it now. I'm thankful for years of watching Coronation Street, which made me comfortable with the idiomatic dialogue here - and happy about the short appearance of &#34;Les Battersby&#34; in the try-out scene. I love the heart of this movie: the relationship between Gaz and Nathan and the friendship among the six men who really come to care about one another through tough times. Robert Carlyle is always at his best when he's playing a dad fighting for his child, and the short exchange between him and Nathan in which they shoulder-punch one another and wind up hugging almost made me cry. Yes, the six men get naked at the very end of the movie, but that's really incidental to the honest emotion of their relationships and the genuinely funny parts: Robert Carlyle, swaddled in a blanket in the police station, swearing with a straight face that they were stealing pipes &#34;in the buff&#34; was hysterical. I'm wearing out my DVD from overuse.
B00899E5B4|5.0|I downloaded the MP3 version for 3.99.  I'm very happy with it and have always liked Joe Walsh.  Very good easy listening type music.
B008NW67E0|5.0|This is quite honestly the best album I have heard all year. Every emotion is shown, and felt, throughout the album, every song displaying a new one. I got goosebumps, chills, & had tears.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I love this book. I've read all the books and watched hunger games the movie. I can't wait to see the movie of catching fire!!!!!!!!!!! In all its all a amazing book!
B009CPJHY4|4.0|Great movie.  Interesting plot, funny cultural crossovers, and a cute love story tossed in. It is worth a watch on a lazy Saturday.
B0088TG252|3.0|This is entertaining but also forgetful. If your at home it will entertain you for the evening but you will probably never recall that you watched it.
B004FGFQBS|3.0|I see Charles Dutton and Charles Dance listed as a few of the cast members, and even a comment about pulling the Queen into the molten lead.  First of all, the Queen was in Ripley's chest;  the Alien which got fried wasn't a Queen.  Second, this description - along with the names Charles Dance and Charles Dutton - go with Alien 3, not Aliens.
B0076NKNLA|4.0|Starts out a little slow but picks up midway through. Very interesting view into Marilyn if this is an accurate description of her character.
0525953728|2.0|It took 3/4 of the book before the author got to the meat of the story.  There are a lot better books about SEAL training and war stories.  Kudos to him for his service and career - but not so much on his writing.
B008Z9YLV2|4.0|One of the most entertaining movies I have seen within the past year. Excited for the second movie in the series.
B002BI6SMI|1.0|It never loaded onto my TIVO, so we didn't watch it.  I ended up purchasing it thru the TIVO rather than thru the Amazon website. It was $1 more, but at least it worked.
B002C4YYEU|5.0|Quite similar to Forest Gump and that's not a bad thing. It has a way at tugging at your heart strings.
B009CPGHDI|4.0|Extremely well done documentary. Shows that even stars can even endure heartbreak, but the show must go on!<br /><br />Well done.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This is such a great show. They did such a fabulous job casting the characters for this show.  I can't wait for Season 3!!!
B006MR2ZQC|5.0|My son got this for his 5th birthday.  There are alot of moving parts to this set and he has had alot of fun with it.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|I am a big fan of Masterpiece Classic and the BBC channel.  This a great series and I am looking forward to season 3.
B008MC175A|4.0|I upgraded from DVD to Blu Ray with the X Men movies because of the Amazon deal and I'm pretty happy with it. Yeah, X3 and Wolverine are pretty much throw aside (or give to friend) movies but the improved quality of picture and sound were well worth it.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Love my Kindle, but having access to my books on my phone is perfect.  Whenever I have a few spare minutes I can always relax and do some reading.
B005UPOAT2|5.0|Well written and a true love story about how fate works and that you should never give up hope. Great acting as well!
B009NOVCTM|3.0|ANOTHER \\"Greatest Hts\\" thing?  Well, \\"Doom & Gloom\\" sounds...KINDA \\"Stones-ish,\\" I guess, but that initial riff - indeed that one riff played throughout the song - is exactly the same riff that Steve Lukather played on Michael J's \\"Beat It,\\" the one that set up Eddie's solo.  Guitarists: play a \\"D\\" chord, and with your pinkie, play an \\"F\\" over and over again on the \\"D\\" string.  That's, uh, it...Keef says \\"HE didn't play it, Mick did, but he taught him.\\"  For what THAT'S worth...The Stones are getting to be as bad as Procol Harum re-re-REleasing \\"greatest hits\\" compilations.  My 2 favorite groups...sigh:  Maybe Mick was correct in an eighties/something interview, where he stated \\"I'm afraid there is no future to Rock and Roll - it's all recycled past.\\"  Me, I'm holding out for Big Daddy's newest...
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|sometimes. u just need to simple calculations. and this app helps u do just that. no confusing or hardly used bells and whistles. to bog u down. its just a nice calculator.
B0043GAZYS|5.0|I love this movie.  Very happy with the blue ray and I watch it all the time. I'm a nerd
B009A9BEHU|4.0|I really enjoyed this concert film. It's great and all the songs are fantastically well played. I loved the introduction on piano done to \\"Yellow\\". As with the video quality... I think it's O.K. Part of the \\"feel\\" Mylo Xyloto wants to capture is this freshness and freedom (not bound to anything). This spirit is captured by the video takes and the different formats used throughout the whole film. It's really not an error but an overall effect to get the audience into the spirit of freshness (contrary of perfection and neatness)... just look at all the graffiti's in the cover... come one, don't expect this to be a neat, clean & crisp experience; it's free and fresh, so enjoy.<br /><br />The whole album is an amazing ride. My only complaint is that there are not enough songs. Where is \\"Talk\\", \\"Hardest Part\\", \\"Speed of Sound\\", \\"Trouble\\", \\"Don't Panic\\", \\"Lover's in Japan\\" or \\"Lost\\"? The only album well represented in here, besides Mylo Xyloto (obviously), is A Rush of Blood to the Head: it's got \\"In My Place\\", \\"Clocks\\", \\"God Put A Smile Upon Your Face\\" & \\"The Scientist\\" (this last one in the extras). But the other great albums, especially, Parachutes and X&Y are almost forgotten in this concert. All the songs in this live album are fabulous, but I think the DVD/Blu-ray has more space to fill and it would have been nice to include more songs.<br /><br />But being left with desire for more is not really that bad, reason why I only subtract one star for this.
B0077ZNCE2|2.0|Coming from my girlfriend who has watched them all....<br />Very cheesy and boring compared to the others. Total waste of my time.
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|Dexter is the consummate gentleman, a Miami police blood spatter analyst and an ethical serial killer. In this first season, we are given a thorough glimpse into the mind of a psychopath, and as such, the focus is squarely on the protagonist. Like the novel, the side characters serve as obstacles and/or pillars in Dexter's life. This set-up could easily become boring, but it never does. Dexter's placid monologues belie his tragic past and glut of experiences he has gone through. Every layer of this complex onion that is peeled back draws the viewer in for more. A crescendo slowly builds, leading to a tension that is rarely found even in horror movies and novels.<br /><br />This show is an intriguing look at not only the darker side of humanity, but the darker side of ourselves. Who among us would kill pedophiles, rapists, torturers and murderers if we could get away with it? This premise has surely been asked by psychiatrists, psychologists and ordinary people for decades, and yet only now do we see this incredibly disconcerting question raised and discussed on TV (and by extension, the Internet, dinner tables and so forth).<br /><br />Some minor character descriptions follow.<br /><br />Maria LaGuerta gets more screen time than she did in the novel, and we are given an enticing taste into the greasy underside of law enforcement politics. This theme never fully disappears in subsequent seasons.<br /><br />Sergeant Doakes, an African American officer who sees Dexter for what he is (apparently, one of very few who actually can pull off such an incredible feat). Vince Masuoka is my personal favourite, as the foul-mouthed forensics analyst who works alongside Dexter and his blood spatter deductions.<br /><br />Dexter's foster father, Harry, and his stepsister Deborah are given more character development commensurate with their importance in Dexter's life, and while Dexter cannot feel love or affection, he does thoroughly understand familial obligations.
B009E3EY38|5.0|I've been reading reviews about the audio on the bonus DVD being poor. I don't know where any of the reviewers listened or how they listened to the DVD, but so far I'm on \\"Black Dog\\" and the Audio is the SPECTACULAR Soundboard audio that has been released in the past year. THE AUDIO IS FANTASTIC!!! I'm listening to this on my old Kenwood 5.1 receiver with optical audio out of my Blu-Ray player. Again this is Soundboard Audio. I have yet to even look at the Blu-Ray yet as well as listen to the CD's, but so far I'm extremely happy that we have this officially released material. If your on the fence about the deluxe version, rest assured the Audio is<br />is amazing!! The Video is a Static shot but the big screens behind the group has all the close-ups.<br /><br />Grab a few beers and ROCK 'N ROLL!!
B000V86OKG|5.0|I will be including major spoilers for season 1, so if you haven't watched it yet, please come back after you've seen it and have become an adamant fan. ;)<br /><br />With that out of the way, season 2 begins shortly after Dexter has dispensed his brand of justice to his elder brother Brian, and caught the unwavering attention of Sergeant James Doakes, an experienced African American cop who sees through Dexter's carefully crafted veneer. As a result, Dexter has kept his addiction in check for over a month. While the novel has Dexter lounging around at home, watching TV to bore Doakes out of his personal stakeouts, the series has him go bowling. For hours on end, with the rest of the Miami homicide team. This allows the side characters to get more limelight (although I would have loved to see Hall bring his monumental acting talents to show us his rendition of Dexter as a slob), which is, all in all, the right choice for a TV show. There is already plenty of inner monologue, and too much more would run a considerable risk of boring the viewer.<br /><br />The cliffhanger at the first episode's conclusion reveals Dexter's handiwork being discovered by divers not far offshore. Having never felt truly alive, the fear of capture and execute sets Dexter's heart pumping, and catapults us into the primary plot for this season - Dexter's efforts to keep the FBI off his trail while juggling his addiction and keeping Doakes at a comfortable distance. Subplots include Dexter digging into his and Harry's past (gleaning uncomfortable revelations concerning his biological mother and Harry), confessing an \\"addiction\\" to Rita (though the exact nature was obviously kept secret), and his sister Debra's paranoid nature following her treatment at the hands of the Ice Truck Killer and subsequent romantic entanglements.<br /><br />Maria is reinstated as Lieutenant early in season 2 (wouldn't want to lose a fan favourite, now would we?). She plays a major role in the Bay Harbor Butcher's investigation and is perhaps the most emotionally damaged individual by its conclusion.<br /><br />Evil personalities dispatched by Dexter this season include: a heartless and seductive car salesman, the moustachioed gang enforcer Little Chino, and one character that shares a deep bond with Dexter and how he became what he is today.
B009RI4FRU|4.0|Odd group to some but good acting, good story, and just like reality for those that have to live with the odd. Great movie.

6305075352|1.0|I love this movie. I didn't like the dvd I received. Watched about 85% of the movie and then the dvd decided to stop. It stayed at that point and I could do nothing to see the last 15% of the movie. Sent it back.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I've recently been sucked into Pinterest and this app makes it SO easy to pin everything! If you're on Pinterest, you need this.
B009K0P10K|5.0|I do not own a television, so having an opportunity to watch a show like this, when I can, is a relaxing calgon moment as I call it. I was a bit disappointed that there was not an episode this week, but I guess the holiday had a great deal to do with that. So, I will have something to look forward to, next week. Thans Amazon, for making my life one step easier.
B008QTV3X0|5.0|A consistently edge of your seat drama.  This show is engaging from the first scene.  With an incredible ensemble cast.

B000068TPN|5.0|This is such a historically accurate film. They pull no punches in this film. It makes me want to read the book.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|Great game; a little harder than previous versions.  But the tie-in to Star Wars is a plus for me.  May the force be with you.

B00A11AN6O|4.0|Nice to have a way to see photos on tablet. Orgaganized alphabetically instead by  the way it is on website.
B0045XICB2|4.0|Good movie. Action, drama, romance, teen angst. Bella must choose between the 2 she cares for most, and must weigh her options, the vampire she loves, who would give her a forever undead life in which she would have to give up her family, and friends for, or the wolf she cares for deeply with whom she would live a life surrounded by her family and friends. But does she really love him? Looking forward to the next movie.
B000ICXQUQ|5.0|I've already seen this movie plenty of times, but I watched it with a friend who's never seen it and he loves it now. It's a classic movie.
B00646UU5Y|5.0|Can't get enough of Primeval. They kept building up to the end of the season making you want the big boom, and then they provided it. Good stuff.
B0062NAX1U|4.0|This DVD is very good for the entire family. It moves right along in the story line and has excellent Christian values that we all need to be reminded of periodically.
B005LAII08|1.0|I have a Samsung BD-C8000, and it won't play the 3d.  It will load the Blu-Ray disk to the point of the title bar, then it stops.  Samsung (in India) says \\"so sorry, gotta wait for the next update, you can't play this\\"  Samsung hasn't updated this player since 2011, so I'm not holding my breath.  So, if 3d is important to you, beware, Disney likes to use \\"new\\" encryption schemes, and your Blu-Ray player might not play this title!  Thanks Disney and Samsung for making me pay a bundle of $$ for a coaster.  I do like the movie...I don't like paying for disks I can't watch.<br /><br />If anyone HAS watched the 3d portion successfully, please respond to this and tell me what worked for you!  Specifically, which BD player can play it?
B0070R40V6|5.0|Awesome book, cheap price. Good deal<br /><br />Would be nice if the text on the maps was easier to read, but that's just being picky

B008KPIN9C|5.0|I have known these guys very lately but it seems that they will be number one in my playlist. I am impressed with their passion to the music. They put some heart into their songs. If you look at the album song by song, all of them make you feel different emotions.Thank you Two Gallants.Also thanks to Amazon for the low prices.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|my 11 year old girl thought it was adventurous with lessons.  my 4 year old boy liked it because it had funny and cute characters.<br />great for tween girls and moms to watch together.
B008MG1E4A|3.0|Although handicapped by a desire to not reveal secrets, this feel short of an exciting adventure and fell short as a policy analysis.
0061726834|5.0|This is a Young Adult dystopian novel where \\"amor deliria nervosa\\"  or love is a disease. In this novel, \\"The Society's\\" scientists have come up with a surgical procedure, to prevent this \\"deadly disease\\". Around their 18th birthday every citizen has this procedure that will prevent or cure amor deliria nervosa. Lena Haloway 's mother was affected by this disease despite numerous subsequent surgeries and that has left a scar on her family's reputation. Lena is 95 days away from her procedure and is glad to have it done and over with so she can move past her mother's reputation, that is until she becomes infected as well. The society that Lena lives in is an interesting albeit disturbing one. I enjoyed how Oliver has a way of working in the nuances of the society into the story so that the reader completely understands this society, we can then empathize and understand the mindset of those characters. Oliver has a fantastic way of writing so that you can picture exactly what is happening. The reader gets to know and like (or not like) the characters in this story as well. We go through the process of Lena going along with the society and then beginning to question that society and their rules. It is safe to say that I loved this series. It's a great read and I highly recommend this series!
B009JZPH32|1.0|This film is very bloody and hard to follow at the end I think the script could have been better
0307730697|5.0|This is an incredible story of Adam Brown's life. It's not like other typical SEAL books, it's more than just what it takes to get through BUD/S. I like how it tells his whole life story, from the time he was young, growing up, his family and friends. It ties in many personal accounts from people that knew him well which really gives you a better picture of who he was, the relationship with his wife Kelley as well as his SEAL buddies.<br />It also tells of the incredible job that Navy SEALs do and the dedication and teamwork that is required.<br />The book has something for everybody - it has the action/adventure in the detailed accounts of the military missions and the seal training, but it also is a love story of a very unique couple, Kelley's love for him and faith in him is amazing. It is also a story of redemption & hope (second chances) going from the dismal pit of drug addiction to an amazing life. It also has many humorous stories throughout his life. You really get to feel that you know him (a little) through all the personal accounts of his friends and family.<br />I've read a few of the negative reviews, which complain about references to his faith. It really wasn't a big emphasis of the book but his faith was obviously a vital part of who he was.<br />It was a easy read, very exciting, didn't really want to put it down. I read it with my 9 yr old son. Note: if you are reading it to younger kids, parents should read ahead first -it does have a few spots where descriptive language may not be appropriate for young kids.<br />nothing bad but because they quote what others say, you may want to substitute age appropriate words for young listeners.<br />I highly recommend this book and have a greater respect for all our Navy SEALS and all our military and their families and the tremendous sacrifice they make for the freedoms we enjoy.
B005RDF2RG|5.0|for kids and adults. This is one of the &#34;classics&#34; we come back to watch again and again over the years.
B0054TVW04|4.0|It is a paper form of magic crystal ball...it tells you about the past, present and future of our world with a new perspective...
B000YAA68C|5.0|Just a beautifully presented movie of a very sad experience of a young woman.  Having experienced a similar loss of my wonderful husband, I could identify with her emotions.  I thought that it was very well done.
B007FEFLTO|1.0|How can there be a DOJ settlement when Amazon is still fixing prices?  This is a huge rip off, going for the free version again instead of buying.
B0087HT36U|4.0|this is a great game...though others have compared it to angry birds, I found it different enough that I enjoyed it thoroughly.  Game play is smooth and there were no obvious faults or glitches when played on my Xoom.  Still waiting on additional levels, though...and that's my only beef with this app.  If more levels are released, I would happily change my rating to 5 stars.
B009KHDT0C|5.0|This was one of Johnny Depp's better movies in my opinion..I actually seen it when it came out in the movie theater...I've purchased the DVD copy to give to my Big Brother for Christmas...He was a big Dark Shadows fan and I think he'll love it...The movie keeps your interest, is very entertaining AND a great family movie..
B004DLPXAO|1.0|I already have a few ebooks from other sources and would like to Import them into Kindle and can't for the life of me figure out how and wasn't able to find a way online. Now, maybe I didn't dig as deep as I should in the FAQs but something as small as importing other source books should not take a PHD to figure out!!

B0076DCT2G|2.0|Nelson DeMille once wrote fantastic novels.  I  couldn't wait for a new one to come out.  But now he reminds me of other authors like Ken Follett and John Grisham that produce big sellers, and then seem to coast along on their fame, churning out mediocre novels for years thereafter.  This novel started out fine.  I was interested in the details of the Middle East wars, but the meetings with high ranking government officials went on and on and on.  Surely there could have been a better way to introduce the back story and fill in the details we needed to know.  I kept waiting for the real plot to start.  To sum it up, I got bored and gave it up about half way through.  For one thing, I got sick and tired of Corey's wise cracks.  It became like an annoying uncle at a funeral, trying to make jokes and be funny when everybody else was being serious.  The whole story was improbable and the writing itself was disappointing.

B00A6PD9I4|3.0|Good story and humor but most good animations have enough humor for adults as well but this does not. Kids will enjoy it more than grown ups will.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|I couldn't even get the game to load on my Kindle Fire properly and I never got to play. I ended up just deleting it. Very disappointing.
B009G78EE2|5.0|Awesome album from start to finish. Great music, great lyrics, great songs. These guys are true artists. Not the typical club music crap. I have a new favorite rapper.
B0056H9LS4|5.0|I never cease buying compilations of Supertramp, just because the songs of the band represent a matter each one that is answered by the next universal matter represented by the follower. This is an abstract language and never ending pleasure to fill my ears. The songs of Supertramp, are a great help for me when I consider my problems, often when I must decide something, I use the band as an oracle, and this is possible because the message of a song in Supertramp includes always the opposite, and doesn't pretend to be a close decision.
B0080YGZ20|5.0|Every time i listen to this album i like it more and more. I love Mike Patton's music and this kinda sounds influenced by him. Her music is all over and crazy yet remains catchy. I am a fan.
B000T412OU|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies.  Harrison Ford's portrayal of the president is exactly what we need in the US.  He is a man of character, strength & integrity.  And he doesn't back down or compromise his beliefs.  I highly recommend it!
0316227706|5.0|I've never had a book make me smile and laugh out loud repeatedly. These photos are unique and wonderful. Definitely a book to share with others!
B004SBQGHS|5.0|I got this as the FAOTD to replace the free ad version. It is nice not to have the annoying ads. There are so many variations on this game but the original is still fun though I would never pay for it as long as there is a free version.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Very entertaining book. Good twist in the plot. Trust Grisham for a good read! Look forward to his next book!
B004TTMYQG|5.0|I got this as the FAOTD and use out exclusively a my goto calender app. It easily pulls in any other calender information you may have like googles calender. It has a very intuitive interface and uncluttered display. This app would have been worth purchasing even if it wasn't free.
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|Star Wars and Angry Birds go together like chocolate and peanut butter!<br />Most definitely a recommended app for any fan.
B004FOA84A|4.0|This is a puzzle find it game that is well written that doesn't make necessary items so small or impossibly hidden that you give up and use a walkthrough guide. The only shortfall of the game is out is very short and is really only fun once (no replay value) I got it as a FAOTD so the cost was appropriate.
0062101897|5.0|Item matches description exactly. It is also an amazing christmas present and I would definitely recommend this product to anyone.
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|Got this as a FAOTD and love how it handles office documents on my galaxy s phone and galaxy tab 10.1
B008ASLK8A|5.0|Excellent movie.<br />Why do you have to be connected on line to watch the 48 hour rental, amazon?<br />Your reply is appreciated.<br />JON
B004SBS8LA|4.0|This is still angry birds. Ad-free makes it nice, but if you have gotten tired of angry birds, Rio doesn't bring anything revolutionary to the franchise.
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|This ap has it all. It lets you into the newest Angry Birds world. It downloaded quickly to my Kindle Fire with no problems.
B006RXQ2CY|5.0|I lived in England from 1945-1949 and therefore can relate very much to the human emotions portrayed. If you are a history buff, this movie is a must because it portrays real events viewed live worldwide.
B0036K3OFY|5.0|Awesome, great action. Needs a sequel. Rain was incredible and the cinematography was outstanding. My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed it.
B0015S7040|5.0|This is a great version of this wonderful piece.  The solos are really fine, and the choral sections and orchestra are beautiful, too.  I highly recommend this piece, if you haven't heard it (although you'll recognize the first movement immediately from dozens of movies!), and this is a perfect version of music that is fun and really interesting.
B002UPA4ZY|5.0|If you like Andrea and Love Christmas this is an album to listen too. David Foster always seems to bring the best out in Andrea.
B0053O89WY|5.0|The package arrived in a timely manner and was in good condition.  I watched the entire set of DVD's to verify that they were all in very good shape.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|If you read this, you will scratch your head as to why the Pentagon reacted the way they did, until you read how the SEAL's thought of the current Administration.  This book is well written and takes you not only into the Bin Laden raid, but you follow the author on his trip from civilian life to becoming one of America's elite warrior's.  I would like to thank the &#34;Mark Owen&#34; for writing this book, so that we get to see something that is not influenced by any &#34;political&#34; pressure or influence.<br /><br />DVSRomad, USAF TACP - Retired
B0023SDPS6|5.0|This was a good book.  Arrived as advertised.  Would purchase from them again.<br />But the story was what held me.  This series of books is better than the TV series.<br />Nice to hold a real book too
B009FZFONO|1.0|I was really upset that this is a online only viewing.  I'm a trucking with a very limited monthly bandwidth allowance from my hot spot.  So I can't watch this unless I find a high bandwidth location and willing to use my password in that location.
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|My children love this movie. Great Christmas story! Follows the book for those who have read it. Very reasonably priced too.
B008602KQI|4.0|This was a fine adaption of a book that seemed impossible to put on screen, at least in a live action film. The casting and acting we're first rate.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is a great Calculator app. It's actually my favorite so far and easy to use. I would definitely recommend it to others.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Very great read. A couple of times I wanted to back up and check if I missed something, but I knew I hadn't. Asked a friend if he had read it. He had and echoed my praise for the book.
B008Y6TGIY|5.0|A wonderful animation from Disney studios. My children love this move and it is one they watch over and over.
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|I fell in love with Travis from the start.  Abby was such a strong woman.  I also loved Shep and mare.  This book had me rooting for them all.  Enjoyed reading can't wait for the next one.<br /><br />If you liked this book try on Dublin street you will love it too.<br /><br />@
B008WCP2KG|2.0|The info said you could play the dance scenes back to back but I wasn't able to. Also the 2nd DVD did not work for me. Very misleading
B002QBS9KE|3.0|Don't know if they really work. It was included as part of a gift. I'm not sure if they even got used.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I finally started watching Downton Abbey on n--fl-x, after much prodding from my daughter. I was so totally hooked that I paid for Season 2 on Amazon Instant Videos. I can't wait to see Season 3, but I must wait until January 2013 for the USA release on PBS. I think I'll sign up for automatic viewing of each segment of the series on Amazon. It's so worth it.<br /><br />Highly recommended!
B0000640VN|5.0|saw this along time ago but couldn't find it anywhere. glad i found it here, i bought it immediately and have watched it multiple times
B0045XICB2|5.0|Continuing the love story and interaction between the vampires and the werewolves.........but the fans know all this........:0)<br /><br />Arrived well within the deadline............:0)  and well worth the price.........:0)
B0002VEPRQ|5.0|such a classic movie. we had a girls night the day it arrived and very much enjoyed watching it again.
B005LLSLPE|2.0|There aren't any good guys, the \\"sons of anarchy\\" are a criminal organization, somehow I guess we're suppose to see how they're \\"human\\", but they're just thugs and I don't like them.  They all ride harleys, have lots of tatoos, don't have jobs, and they sell guns to pay the bills and murder people to prove a point.  But they don't like anyone selling crank in their town, so they have a good side.  I can't understand all the positive reviews on this terrible show.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Couldn't put it down then couldn't wait to pick the next one up. Loved every minute and so did my husband :)
B0033807E0|5.0|another great book from Rick Riordan!!When luke turns into Kronos, he is going to destroy camp half blood with the entry through the labryinth. Now, only Percy Jackson can save the day. Another fascinating adventure
B007IXWL2C|5.0|A fabulous story with the right amount of intensity to the story line. The &#34;romance&#34; is definitely not for the faint of heart. Worth the time to read all of them
B0012NVGHU|5.0|My husband and I both loved this movie, the music is fantastic and the story is hilarious and heartbreaking. Five stars.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Perfect follow up to the first one and a perfect lead into the last. The intensity of the story line picks up more in this one but its still exciting at every turn
B00A6PD8RQ|5.0|This is one of the best movies I have watched in a long time. Thoroughly enjoyed this movie. Great story, great first experience with Amazon video on demand!, Awesome HD content and 5.1 sound!!<br />Thank you
0525953728|5.0|I BELIEVE MARK OWEN'S BOOK &#34;NO EASY DAY&#34;..I DON'T WANT TO COMMENT TO MUCH, AS I KNOW, OBAMA HAS BLOOD ON HIS HANDS!~
B00992CF6W|5.0|I have it for the x box and the pc and I have been waiting for this to come out the new update is so cool I love it<br /><br />very cool game you should buy it
B007UPNA6Y|2.0|Usually Reacher gets u turning the pages early on. I found I had to get half way through the book before I felt that excitement build.
B005V4FJC4|5.0|It is such a brilliantly different sound that is warm enough to bring a fireside mood no matter where you are.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This show is so great! I love how I am able to watch the episodes the next day after they air.
B0094WK9GU|5.0|This album has awesome tracks that bring back memories for anyone whose been to one of their recent sets. It has all the bootlegs 'n mashups they rocked the crowds with!!<br />I know some people were a bit upset at the 'live set&#34; style continuous tracking, but I love it! its a throwback of SHM's First album,  &#34;Until one&#34;<br />I've got nothing but  love for these three .
B00A8ECU24|5.0|This game is awesome! I love it alot! I got it because i was bored and to have another app for my little sister but it is super fun!!!
B00899F0G8|5.0|I love this show! My roommates and I spit the cost and purchase episodes because we can't wait for it to come out!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I like being able to hear some of the names of people and places. Helps me focus on the content and not the phoenetics.
B009RROP12|5.0|I heard a preview of this CD and after the first 30 seconds I had to buy it. Excellent and uplifting melodic rock that makes you feel energized.
B0086213XW|1.0|Boo! It was very boring. We stopped watching it half way through. We felt like we wasted our money and time.
B005EVE8WG|5.0|Couldn't stop listening to it. Well-crafted melodic rock that sticks in your head. In this era of empty headed corporate robot music for the masses, it is refreshing to hear such thoughtful and upbeat music.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|The book was well written and it was a very funny book. Well written Jeff Kinney. I loved this book
B008S4YZCO|5.0|This game is the best !<br />I never stop playing it . Gameloft is great ! I,m trying so hard to get a Vaccumster that I can,t stop playing the game . I,m on level 34 . I,m thankful for the last sale . It was great . I adore my Pegaster . I wish that every<br />monster that cost crystals was 90% off .
B009NQKPUW|5.0|I love this movie; the creature effects and story line really drove it home for me.  The detail in the environment and the chemistry between the actors were great.
B009329Y30|5.0|Awesome movie, great story line, romantic, and heart warming. Great acting, it's a feel good movie. Loved it. I highly recomend.
B008EQIEWS|5.0|This movie didn't disappoint!  I love every minute of it!  The various character flaws and creature effects were always on point.
B009HV2JT8|3.0|There seems to be too many vampire movies/books out there now days that we now have to make everyone into a vampire. Just watered down versions of the good stuff. I have to say more entertaining than Bella and Edward staring at each other for two hours. ;)
B006P96PAO|5.0|You will learn what the meaning of Dad is.<br />This movie has everything. Comedy, action, drama, and the best a Christian reflection of what God inspect from us.<br />My family love this movie and we think the same way as the big message for this movie send. ( Joshua 24:15 NIRV-ENG)<br /><br />&#34;But suppose you don't want to serve him. Then choose for yourselves right now whom you will serve. You can choose the gods your people served east of the Euphrates River. Or you can choose the gods the Amorites serve. After all, you are living in their land.<br /><br />But as for me and my family, we will serve the Lord.&#34;
B009NQKPUW|2.0|Just didn't really do it for me. The effects were fine, but that is about all good I can say about the movie. I don't really know why the big bald guys wanted to kill the humans other than everything wants to kill humans.
B003L77GRO|5.0|What a good show! Every time I watch one, if I have time, I just want to start the next one!
B009B4ZEKM|3.0|LOTUS: Nice intro. For an intro a bit too long hense too repetitive but to be honest one of my favourite songs on the album. 8/10<br /><br />ARMY OF ME: Not a huge fan of the song. Not a bad song but I really don't like the vocal & instrumental arrangement of the song. Not something I would just skip while playing the album. I love the bridge though. Lyrics are not the best that could be yet they don't suck either. 7/10<br /><br />RED HOT KINDA LOVE: Not really memorable. Writing this review after like my 10th listen of the album but I just can't remember anything about this song. An interesting song though. Don't know why I have a hard time liking this or even remembering it because it sounds kinda catchy while listening but after finishing the song I just forget about it! But it's not a bad one either. Just a simple avarage pop song. 6/10<br /><br />MAKE THE WORLD MOVE: I really like this one.  A standard pop song but very catchy and suitable for dancing, listening for leisure, I mean it's a good song with a strong sense of vocals. CeeLo actually brings an interesting flavour into the song! Extremely repetitive but doesn't really bother the ear. 8/10<br /><br />YOUR BODY: The first single. This is a very nice bitchy song. I seriously LOVE it. Really catchy but unfortunately not a song which can promote itself or Xtina. Love the vocals on this! 8/10<br /><br />LET THERE BE LOVE: Could have been a succesful 1st single. Maybe my absoulte favourite song on the album. VERY CATCHY. Wish there were more songs like this on the album. This song brings me joy. 9/10<br /><br />SING FOR ME: The vocal production in the beginning is bad. And the song sounds very boring for a ballad. There are interesting ballads which make you love them. This is NOT one of them. This is a ballad where Xtina shouts her ass off in the verses and actually the album would be better off without this song. After the first half the vocals become more interesting but they are still like shouts. BOOORRRIIING!! 4/10<br /><br />BLANK PAGE: This IS an interesting ballad. This is what I was talking about. This is an amazing collab with Sia. Very emotional and one of the best ballads I've heard in a long time. Some great vocal jobs, and she doesn't shout all that much. Amazing song. 9/10<br /><br />CEASE FIRE: I'm not sure of what to think of this one. The intro back vocals are amazing and the lyrics are awesome in the first verse but just too much autotune and it disturbs the ear. And not a very interesting song. Repetitive. Not the worst song on the album. 6/10<br /><br />AROUND THE WORLD: Even though  most people hate this one this is a very catchy song in my opinion. An interesting song to listen. I don't get bored listening this one and find it really catchy. 8/10<br /><br />CIRCLES: Absolutely the worst song on the album along with Shut Up. WTF is this? The whole song goes by Xtina telling her haters to `sit on her middle finger' and she tries to rap a bit sounding like Nicki Minaj, who I quite hate. Catchy song but not in a good way.  2/10<br /><br />BEST OF ME: An OK song. Not half as bad as Circles but not as good as Blank Page. The verses are better than the chorus, which seem to be the case in many songs. Bridge is `meh' and quite unoriginal. 5/10<br /><br />JUST A FOOL: Again against most people I like this one. A bit too shouty and screachy but not a bad song. Blake's voice adds quite a bit to the song. The bridge is just AMAZING and yet the chorus is just good. I enjoy this song very much to be honest. 8/10<br /><br />LIGHT UP THE SKY: The most unoriginal song on the album. SO boring as well. I just wanna skip this song. This is unbearable for me. Not a good song. Musically worse than circles. In general, just a bit better without all the repetitiveness. Vocals are good and the production is nice BUT the song itself is pretty bad. 4/10<br /><br />EMPTY WORDS: This is another song that I just can't remember BUT it's a very very good song. The vocals are not amazing but the song itself is really good. Cheap-ish production & a bit forgetable but other than that it's a solid song. 7/10<br /><br />SHUT UP: Circles v2.0. I'm having 2nd thoughts about this album after listening this and Circles. Two VERY VERY VERY terrible songs that just keeps space on the CD. 2/10<br /><br />YOUR BODY REMIX: Not a pro about remix but very club oriented. Like it. :D Dubstep-ish and very nice. Quite as good as original. 7/10<br /><br />Average: There are some AMAZING songs and there are some VERY bad songs here. The so-called comeback CD is not as good as it was expected. Wish it was stronger. These 2-3 bad songs make people want to download the album illegally and remove the bad songs keeping the good ones only. Well, anyway if you like Xtina buy it but don't have super high expectations. The cover photo is VERY VERY good. Very original and inspirational, unlike some of the album. 6/10 (***)t amazing but the song itself is really good. Cheap-ish production & a bit forgetable but other than that it's a solid song. 7/10<br /><br />SHUT UP: Circles v2.0. I'm having 2nd thoughts about this album after listening this and Circles. Two VERY VERY VERY terrible songs that just keeps space on the CD. 2/10<br /><br />YOUR BODY REMIX: Not a pro about remix but very club oriented. Like it. :D Dubstep-ish and very nice. Quite as good as original. 7/10<br /><br />Average: There are some AMAZING songs and there are some VERY bad songs here. The so-called comeback CD is not as good as it was expected.

B003JTHXOK|5.0|I am a fan of Nicholas Sparks. I have read all his books. This book held my interest and I could not put it down. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes a good mystery mixed with a love story.
B004SOR4H6|5.0|GREAT!! I do not think I would like this but it is great fun! You really have to try it.
B0092MKFIY|5.0|I absolutely love this album!  I had heard the first song, Radioactive, before and just decided to get the whole CD since it was so cheap.  I am so glad I did because the entire album is amazing!  My favorite song is Bleeding Out.
B007A2O3FO|5.0|Loved this movie. The story was magical and light. A good movie for the whole family. Maggie is great as usual. You'll want to see it again and again.
B009LK6JS2|5.0|This app is a lot of fun for the price. Some day I will be able to land on a carrier!
1608871088|5.0|Personally, I am very picky about art books. I prefer a balance of both early sketches, paintings, character tds, and digital manips which this art book succeeded on all fronts. It's filled with beautiful, unique designs making it surpass both the Tangled and the How to Train Your Dragon I own (which were originally my personal favorites out of my collection).<br />Each of the main characters are shown in intense detail along with each of the \\"worlds\\" they are located in.<br />You'll definitely be blown away and I would give it a must have for art book collectors and concept art appreciators.
B0096CDG0O|5.0|Very entertaining game. Much less time involved than with taking turns than with words with friends! Less thought involved!  Reminds me of &#34;yachtzee&#34;
B00364K6YW|5.0|LOVE THIS MOVIE!!! Pride and Prejudice arrived earlier than expected arrival date. Brand new.  This is a wonderful buy, and Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth are perfect in this!!!
B009CPES4I|3.0|A nice feel good sort of movie but the storyline wandered without building to much.  It felt like the characters were not developed to the point where I knew and or cared that much about them.
B009ZAY8MM|5.0|Winners of the sing off and an awesome group. Can't wait to see them live in 2013.<br /><br />I suggest anyone should buy!!
B000FC0O7M|5.0|Great read. I'm not finished with it yet but it's been interesting and fun to read. yay. three words needed. yay
B0031RS2HC|5.0|As usual this book was a gripping tale and I couldn't wait for the next exciting page.<br />Loved it.<br />Looking forward to the next book in the series.
B004LWZW42|4.0|This movie is a good explanation of the mutant conflict in general. It was well done. I liked it very much.
B00338QENI|5.0|I loved this book! It was a great combination of human interest and science. I would highly recommend it to any reader, even if you have no science background.
B004EPZ07K|3.0|I felt like nobody really wanted to be in this movie. Very disappointed with the actors and the pacing. The effects were okay, but the &#34;Keanu Reeves style Klatu&#34; feel just didn't work at all. I'm a comic book fan from the fifties, so my tolerance levels for this genre are pretty high. This was stretching it a little too far.
B008GXHOFW|1.0|The game wont even start. All I get is the start up video and then im shut out. Im not happy, waste of money
B007M45PMU|5.0|I am in love with the Avett Brothers, Mumford and Sons, and so many others. This band is great and from my part of the world. Love their sound and was a great buy.
B00003ZKRM|3.0|These 1960's recordings present a terrific conductor's view as executed by a second or third rank orchestra. The 4th and 7th symphonies are, I think excellent interpretations.The 1st and 3rd as well as Finlandia I fine really grating. In the<br />same time period there were recordings by Karajan/Berlin and Bernstein/New York which hold up much better, to my ear, although neither or those recorded the entire seven symphonies. The price,however is DIRT cheap.
B003O86FMW|5.0|As good or better than Hunger Games - holds your attention and enriches the personalities involved.  I recommend this good.
B007XF4J66|5.0|Casablanca. Best movie every. All-time great. Hard to imagine a better movie for someone who was alive and aware in 1941-1945.
B008KE3960|5.0|The 5-year old loves it  Fun to play together. Easy to get going and to interface. Short learning curve. One two three
B007U4DIM6|5.0|I love the movie, although I think #1 & 2 were my favorites. It's nice to have the set and the price was definitely right.
B00498TQV8|3.0|I thought this movie was a good portrayal of many of the impoverished ones of our country, the US. The hard truth of this young girl's struggle to take care of her family is much like many people's struggles to keep their homes after losing their jobs in this present economy. I thought the movie was very slow going and not too much action. I think it might have been a little better if it had more of a climax, instead it was very monotone.
B009KKLQVS|4.0|Many fans have intentionally constructed harsh reviews to punish the BB organization for failing to produce a full-show or 50 song DVD film, so many of these negative reviews are a form of critical sabotage. Take then with a grain a salt, as the product is much better and more aesthetically fulfilling than the these will opponents will allow.  Others have made more valid critiques of the photography and production artistry, and I myself was sensitized by their cautions when  I first put the show on. However:  because, despite any concerns, I was simply overwhelmed by the quality of the songs in themselves, the excellence of the performances, and the chance to see so many things that my shaking binoculars prevented me from seeing in concert.<br /><br />I concede that there is a Platonic BB concert film in our imagination somewhere and perhaps even in the realm of earthly possibility, if the very best production and sound artists were in charge of every recording and filming detail.  But in its absence, I will watch this over and over; I find it intimate, detailed, bright, optimistic, loving, and warm.  I love the song selection, the directness of the performances, and the tons of lost (now found) Beach Boy Dave Marks playing monster licks.  The reality of seeing the BB performing together (and not in grainy you-tube fan videos) trumps an over attention to the details about film editing and camera angle.  Viewers will do well to disarm their plastic, Apollonian senses and give themselves over to the Dionysian intoxication of the BB music.<br /><br />Added note: if you are a fan of David Marks you have to be very happy: I watch the DVD over and over just to study his riffs, some of which are historical (the parts he and/or Carl played) and some of which are invented anew. For many who embrace archetypal narratives of redemption, David Marks IS the reunion. Imagine that kindly boy from \\"across the street\\" who left the band at 15, now, in his 60's playing again with theBB, drawing fans to their feet with gasps of awe.  Yes, I want a 60 song DVD, and I want to see David himself leading the BB orchestra in a majestic version of Pet Sounds, but I will wait for those and cherish this DVD (the price of 2 venti pumpkin spice lattes?) for now.
B008WCP2PG|1.0|The language was too raunchy for me, could have been done without the dirty talk. The story was weak, also.
B0009F9O6W|1.0|(I'm qualifing sound, music is superb)<br />I own original UK CD edition, as an example: Man Erg starts with a low piano (peaks of -15db), in new edition, same piano peaks at -4db. When loud parts come in the new edition is almost saturated, and dynamics has been lost (you can't get any louder than 0db). Old edition peaks at -3db with whole dynamics preserved, drums presence, etc.<br />I'm very dissapointed, and will only preserve this new edition for its bonus tracks.<br />Same thing happened with some remasters of Alan parsons, Harrison, ELO, etc. (Beatles were ok).
B008COD5OO|3.0|It was funny...and a little different...but typical high school teen movie...with plenty of under age drinking....and 18 year old boobies..lol
B008HJGPVO|5.0|This stylus is perfect! The three different sized tips make it invaluable for any job. In addition, the handy clip allows the Kindle owner to attach it to the Kindle cover, so it will never be misplaced. In addition, my Kindle's screen no longer has any smeary fingerprints! I would not be able to do without this valuable tool, now!
B001GJ9G90|4.0|Jane and John Smith are government assassins working for different agencies.  They are unknowingly assigned to hit each other.  The best thing about this movie is the chemistry between Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt, and the dialogue, as they try to work out their domestic issues while trying to kill each other.  The little looks they give one another and the throw-away lines are some of the funniest moments of the film.  You have to pay attention or you will miss something.  The things I didn't like with the stupid errors in continuity and the lack of good sense in some scenes.  In one scene Pitt drove to work in a Cadillac and drove home in a Lincoln.  Jolie's Mercedes is totaled in one scene and comes back in the next scene.  She is wearing one costume in the desert, where Pitt tries to kill her, and she is wearing a different outfit as her wounds are being treated.  These mistakes are amateurish and really take away from the film.  Never mind that.  Enjoy the snap, crackle, and pop between Jolie and Pitt.
B007HWTQQ8|5.0|Excellent depiction of the crucifixion of Christ.  Some argue that there is too much emphasis on Mary the mother of Christ and I can somewhat agree.  It really doesn't matter though.  It's a little too violent for young children.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|It us fun after you beat the first rounds of games. my kindlefire applications didn't allow them to charge me for this game. it says it has billing but if u have a kindle, its FREE!!! :D
B000BW7QWW|5.0|Special effects are stupendous! Action packed! One should also see/buy the Firefly series on dvd and watch the whole story.
B000HKW7E0|5.0|One of the best Christmas comedies around.  There is some adult language so I wouldn't let the little kids watch it.<br />A great movie to start the Christmas season off.
B009CPJHY4|3.0|Been to India several times. I find India more conservative than this program. But then I do not frequent the more decadent places.<br />I did not care for the obligatory immorality relationships in this story, that seems to be required nowadays in today's features.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|I got this game as part of Amazon's free app of the day and WOW!, what a great game!<br />If you like Bejewelled, you will like this game.  It is much more challenging then Bejewelled, with the main goal being to form up the murals by getting the pieces on the board to the bottom.  Doing this allows you to eventually harness the power of Atlantis.<br />The story line is a nice touch as it gives a bigger goal then just finishing the puzzles.<br />The graphics are beautiful and the voice overs are well done.<br />Highly recommend! It is worth paying for if you enjoy these gem matching games.
B009NPKTN6|5.0|When I first heard about this movie, I wasn't too excited to see it. I thought it was going to be another lip sync musical, but in actuality everyone sings for themselves. Even Tom Cruise. I thought the love story could of been better but overall, I was very impressed with it. :)
B00632HWOG|4.0|I chose this because it allows me to not only get my emails it allows me to respond.  I like it because it lets me respond to my emails.  Previously I was accessing my emails through yahoo.com and although I could read them it wouldn't allow me to compose.  When I attempted to respond, the keyboard just would appear.  I dislike that it doesn't have the same appearance as when I go to yahoo.com.  I would recommend this as an alternative to going to yahoo.com if you can't do what you need to.  I just started using it a few days ago but it seems like it will serve my purpose.
B009DZDJU6|5.0|I was very impressed with how the writers intertwined the history of Abraham Lincoln, Civil War and the undead. Every actor/actress was very good!
B009FZFONO|3.0|Not nearly as action-packed as the previous two seasons. So far not as thrilling, more like a soap opera with a zombie theme.
B0069GRIHW|5.0|Apart from the remastered album which is OK, the second disc of this set features unreleased alternate tracks of the album. It was known for years that this record have been almost entirely live in the studio, and here you absolutely get that feeling. It feels like the band are playing live with no audience. It is a taste of what could have been had Morrison lived and returned to LA to tour this album. A 5CD (then 3CD) set containing all of the LA WOMAN had been planned but for the moment there is no official word on if this will have a physical release or not. I guess they picked the best alternate takes of the songs for this one disc release, but given the quality of this stuff, WE WANT MORE!
B007XU0N1G|5.0|He is one of a kind composer and musician. The new album is fantastic. I just can't wait to see them personally!
B0079J28NC|5.0|You don´t have to be a Beatles fan to love this movie. It simply states as maybe the best tribute to the 60´s hippie era, the psychedelia, the swingin´London. But it is actually more than that, it is a testament to the power of love and music. Lovingly restored, it also includes the Bulldog scene which was not available in all the previous releases. The extras are very nice too, some of them have historic footage, and they are also restored as well. The stickers are beautiful, but I was expecting a better booklet with some more details or memorabilia.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|This is the best tv show we have seen.  I have recommendedit to a number of people because I think it is the best.
B004NDVK1I|4.0|This is a classic record from Rory´s early years. In it you will find all of the man´s trademarks: guitar virtuosity, some great song writing, true live performing, etc. This record ranges from classic blues with some clearly BB King influences in his playing (I wonder WHo), hard rock (Tattoo´d lady, the best number here and best version ever), acoustic numbers (As the crows flies), and some of the man´s most introspective songs a million miles away). The only reason I don´t rate this album 5 stars is that Rory´s best numbers were still to come, but otherwise is an excellent record.<br />The package is really nice in a letter envelope- style. Essential for Rory fans and a nice way to start getting into this artist as well.
B005MMYBXI|5.0|love it, can't wait for the third season. will order that next. just a shame they had to switch actors.
B0063B2BNE|5.0|This was easy to order and watch from home or on my smartphone. The quality of the HD video was excillent and reliable.
B00A135YUW|5.0|I used to get into so much trouble at home for using the f word, now people just sing it like it's no big deal.<br />LOL
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|I found this book on my Kindle, not realizing it is a young adult book (don't let that stop you from reading it!!), and it's now a best seller.  I really enjoyed this book.  It's fiction and fantasy, combined with REAL photos found around the globe, and makes for a really interesting read.  Different concept and story - well worth reading.
B007WKEM8C|5.0|Love it......I think it is ridiculous that you require a certain number of words for a review.....just how I feel
B00992CF6W|1.0|you suck at prices I'm suing you for 100.000.000.000 not kiding I hare $25 and it touck every last peny. sorry people don't buy it.
B0086700CM|5.0|every one always say I lages but it works fine  so if I were u I would get it it is awesome!!!!
B0077ATSSQ|1.0|I was so excited to get this dvd, but was very disappointed in it.  It was boring and not like a movie at all.
1577314808|5.0|This book sells itself. I don't however, care for the fact that my review requires a certain amount of words.
B0015RFCZ0|4.0|Very good movie.  I thought it started a little slow, but it was a very touching movie.  I recommend it.
B009LL4LMM|4.0|Takes a little to get used to. But it's a fun game. Good application of physics, and very cute. Even if you just play to unlock hats.
B008LY5VHE|5.0|I saw this movie for the first time at a school classic movie night.  I loved it.  Was very glad to see it was available from amazon in digital format.
B00701L5XS|3.0|A nice idea, and not hard to get the hang of. However not all of the knots are entirely accurate. The double coin knot for example looks nothing like the one in this app.
B008ASLK8A|4.0|Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows<br />Roberrt Downey is a new, non-traditional Sherlock Holmes. His acting is top notch and the feats he performs border at times on fantasy.  Dr Watson complements the Holmes character nicely.
B007TMON8M|1.0|Not worth it even free. The game has a terribly narrow range of success, and the solutions often seem counter-intuitive. Uninstalled after 20 minutes.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Awesome - great read. I couldn't put it down.  I can't wait to read the last in the trilogy now!
B009SIE6AA|5.0|Superb artist as always and I appreciated the Christmas songs downloaded easily to my Android. Gets me is the mood whilst on the run.
1878424319|5.0|As the author of [[ASIN:061554052X The Pi of Life]] I love books that engage, inspire, and uplift. The Four Agreements is one of those books. It's easy to read with a powerful message .<br /><br />Truth is Truth. And The Four Agreements overflows with Truth and Wisdom. If you're on the path of self-mastery this is a great book for you. I love the simple yet powerful message each agreement contains and highly recommend this book.
B008B1VYP0|5.0|A lot of Albums have a couple songs that I like. But this one is great from start to finish! I love it.
B00A6PD9I4|3.0|This movie is on the level of most animated movies these days, but no where near the level you would expect from Disney, slow moving plot.
B00AA7O6QC|5.0|I loved the wink/wink from one actor to another (former tough guys) appearance after they enter the scene. And of course, no action movie would be complete without really nasty, gnarly sounding weapons. Perfect.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|My son loves this game (and so do I)!!  And I don't feel that bad letting him play it, as it teaches him reasoning, trying to put together the different parts to allow the pig to get to the stars and the end.
B00A6PD8RQ|5.0|The movie had plenty of action yet the sound track didn't chase us from the room. It was a classic theme with a pleasant mix of her prankster brothers who come to the rescue. I liked the ghosts/spirits that take her from one adventure to another.
B007SGM084|5.0|I love this trilogy on my cloud reader because it allows me to escape into it while reading and because it is on the cloud, I am able to pick up where I left off on my tablet and my android phone and my laptop.  Fun and very sexy story. Simple yet well written.
B00A14SQBU|5.0|She has such a beautiful voice.  The whole cd is awesome.  I love listening to it.  All song selections just work. I recommend this cd!
B001TODO54|2.0|I was driven to read this book solely due to it's good reviews. I finished the book, and although I cannot say it's a bad book, it certainly did not live up to the expectations I had after all the praise I read. The \\"action\\" is mediocre at best and the romance, while endearing, remains dull. Upon reading the last page, I was disappointingly left saying, \\"that's it? What the hell?\\" It felt like a \\"rip-off\\", so to speak. The story (and the characters) did not resonate with me at all, in fact it's only been 4 months since I read it and I barely remember anything except the overall \\"gist\\" of things. The main character seemed somewhat robotic to me and although I wasn't yearning for her demise, I wasn't rooting for her either. To make matters worse, the sequel (which I did not and do not care to read)does not continue where Graceling left off,  instead it tells a completely different story, set a few years AFTER Graceling, with the little girl named Bitterblue protagonzing in the novel.<br /><br />I really wanted to like this book, and I read it wholeheartedly yearning to love it, and tried to do so all the way to the last sentence, but alas, I did not. Perhaps if I would have sat down and written a review right after reading it I would have more to say, but, as I mentioned, the story was so average that I don't really have anything great or horrible to say about this book. The fact that I can't remember anything of worth in a book that I read less than 4 months ago but yet I can remember every detail about the plot and character in books like Divergent or Delirium (and their respective sequels)two books that I read many months ago, serves to demonstrate that something about Graceling just didn't cut it for me.
B009WUBERW|4.0|I enjoyed seeing some of my favorite actors off all time.  It was very entertaining.  The story line was a little weak but who cares.  Great movie!!
B004TI5N38|4.0|I would have given this 5 stars except for the doubt cast by reports this is a knock off of a novel by Lee Childs. (The Childs novel is not even out yet? Who's knocking off whom? Somebody needs to get the lawyers working!)<br /><br />Fortunately, I read this novel before reading its reviews. It was the best book I've read in a while. It starts with the murder of an entire family - a very gruesome murder. Forcing the Army CID investigator to work with a pretty town cop - the top cop - was good for interest. The story is very complex and develops in spurts with a big spurt at the end that takes a couple of readings. The characterizations are great.<br /><br />I would have preferred to see Puller take the promotion. He certainly earned it. But a guy with his experience would probably know good reasons not to do so. After all, if he can date a general, ....
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I felt this is one of his recent bests.  The plot and character development was very good and the ending was a surprize.
B000X2H8G4|5.0|I was looking for a amplified mic to use on a large  Parabolic dish that i use for recording wildlife in my area. I dident want to spend alot of money and came across the Sonic Super Ear Personal Sound Amplifier and i liked the price!! I wasent sure what i would get or if if this would even work for my aplication. This Mic and Amp combo works Great on my Parabolic dish and would recomend it to anyone on buget. A few words of cation! If you are using this mic for the hard of hearing, make sure there is very little or no back ground noise at all! As this mic is so sensitive, it picks up everything!! This is a great mic if used under the right conditions! As for one on one conversations or TV watching with no other back ground noise in the room this is a great buy for the money!!! As far as for use on my Parabolic dish! I can hear what kids are talking about at 100 yards away, very clearly!! I realy like this mic!
B008O5NINY|5.0|This book takes meditation a lot further, and puts its message very clearly with very good exercises aimed to achieving the results for which one would hope.  This is a bopok to consider re-reading several times.
B009NPKTN6|5.0|very entertaining.  The music really brought back memories.  would reccommend this to anyone. I hope I can find more current movies like this on Amazon
B00122O34O|2.0|I really only wanted one song on this 'album', the Kinks' &#34;Well Respected Man&#34;. It's not available ANYWHERE as a single or on a Kinks' compilation (how weird is that), so I had no other choice but to buy this whole album. Nothing wrong with it if the other songs are to your taste, they're just not mine.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I love everything about the show, top quality actors, dialog, special effects, makeup...you name it.<br />The Walking Dead is the first TV show in years that I've been willing to try, since I'm a horror fan.<br />I just got tired of being a faithful follower of TV shows. Some shows I watched for five to six years and at the very end of the series, time and time again, I felt like I was given a bull$%^& ending,for example &#34;Lost&#34;. The writers and cast were the once lost.<br />I just hope that the people at AMC and writers of The Walking Dead have more respect for their fans... well, time will tell.
B000F0UV0E|5.0|This puts me in a state of mind that makes me feel calm and puts me in such a beautiful state of mind,that I do not care what troubles may arise.
B007TXN4TK|4.0|This is great for me as  a beginner, but have to use on an I pad would be better since my fingers are too big to use on Iphone
B009LZDGSI|4.0|I am enjoying this series, seriously. Both characters' have just enough Quirkiness about them to blend together well. Both have brillient, but flawed past lives to be interesting storylines. I am looking forward to more episodes of \\"Elementary\\".
B009NQKPUW|4.0|It was a good fast moving movie. it had a good story for this type of movie. I am glad I choose it
B009ZTLPJM|2.0|Nothing on this album sounds like a  &#34;Kick Butt&#34; song. Its dull and lifeless....Sounds like another Chris Cornell Sideshow act.....
B009HV2JT8|1.0|this movie was the pits I know it was surpposed to be campy but it was flat and boring. I would avoid this one
B000001DVD|4.0|great cd, this is what rock n roll should sound like, great vocals and awsome rythems, much more raw than pyromania and hysteria, you can realy tell how they were still lookin for their signeture sound, definitly one of their best, this is the type of music that gets your blood flowing,
B00A6PD8RQ|5.0|Or daughter's. This is such an amazing movie and one that I really enjoyed watching with my 7 year old little girl. It's not often that you find a movie that stresses the importance of the mother/daughter bond and this one nailed it!
B000001DV2|4.0|very good alubum, littlie bit more pop sounding than thier early stuff but still good all the same, you can realy hear how  joes voice has matured oveer the years, miss that screaming guitar riffs from steave clark and the old days,but keeping up with the times all in all good album.
B009FZFONO|5.0|Keeps you on the edge of your seat, I always look forward to new episodes! This is probably one of my most favorite shows ever.
B000001E21|4.0|great cd, bit heavier and darker compared to  some of there other albums. and even though the band has changed sounds a little over the years you can still hear that true def leppard style in there that cemented them in rock history, and knowing that after all the other bands that have disapeared from that era, lep still got what it takes to rock.
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|Combine a highly addictive game with the sounds and music of Star Wars...Priceless! My six year old couldn't put out down, even with threats of death poor dismemberment...
B0036BP6XQ|5.0|This purchase was for my granddaughter, who is almost 18.  She specifically asked for it so that she could look at it whenever she wanted.  Wonderful movie.
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|Easy enough for a 3 year old to pick up and play but challenging enough to hook adults.Great game! Highly recommended
B009HEMW4W|3.0|It was ok something to watch once and enjoy but only once.  The first was the best and it has been down hill ever since.
B009CPJHY4|4.0|The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel<br />Movie purchased as a gift for an individual<br />who really like movie and wanted to add to<br />their collection.
B007Y36K46|5.0|This a great movie.  I have watched it several times and each time I have found it to be equally enjoyable.  I do not understand why this movie failed at the box office.
B005LAIHY0|5.0|I love ridley scott and I love the alien franchise.  I knew to expect a slow dramatic thriller with lots of musical cues to set the mood so I loved this movie. The only drawback, not just for this film, is the expensive price most studios charge for the 3 pack.  You pay for the movie, not the format it is delivered in, at least not for DVD and digital as the material costs are insignificant (when compared to blu-ray blank discs), and their 3 in 1 is a ploy to excuse why they charge so much more.  I don't use DVD, since I use my PS3, so why would I and I hate having to download extra software, flixter or itunes, to view my digital media.  Plus when they go broke, have fun trying to get the digital copy back.
B008QE9XD2|3.0|An ok movie but I had to see some parts twice because I fell asleep while watching it.  I would not go to the theatre to see this movie.
B007THA4FI|2.0|I really found this book to be a bland, tawdry look into British suburbia.  It reminded me of Days of Our Lives (British style), but much lower class....  I really couldn't get into it at all.  If you were expecting mystery, magic, or even characters you could love...... You'll be disappointed.
B001L63JC8|5.0|One of the best albums of the 70's prog-rock era. If you like prog, you have to own this.Highly recommended!!
B009HV2JT8|2.0|Not what I expected. Sort of got bogged down in the political side of Abe, but the vampire action and cinematography were great!
B000JMKTLO|3.0|seemed liked the author was trying to be creative and unusual. it was just okay. I thought there were way too many wealthy people in Windy Gap compared to the population.
B004EPZ034|2.0|I finally was able to see this third installment of one of my most beloved childhood characters and after what I thought were two fun and enjoyable films and I excited to see the new one. At this point I was expected no more character introductions and just a great Chipmunk story. Unfortunately I was not to happy with what I got.<br /><br />'Chipwrekced', was nothing but a simple no effort film that ties up all the lose ends that the predecessors left behind. Also, it was an attempt to place stupid pop culture references all through-out the movie. Of course I will admit there were some very cute moments and jokes. Even more so a little bit of character development, but a very small amount. The music of course is always a Chipmunk staple, but it this film the flow of the songs was just very unorganized and a little over done.<br /><br />At this point I think it is safe to say that this franchise is history, it was nice to have a brief moment of Chipmunk-Mania, especially since these characters have been in the public eye since the late 1950's. Still, if you want to have a proper send off, you gotta give it some effort. Will there be a 4th film...if there is I would not be shocked, even if it was just a made for video release. Will I see it...unless they fix what they broke, definitely not...I'm munked out for now.
B005LAII08|4.0|This movie was a bit darker then expected, but still good. My 5 year old twins had mixed reaction. My son enjoyed it, but my daughter seemed more disturbed by it. Of course she loves all the sweet gentle Disney Princess and this fiesty spirited Pixar princess was not what she expected, plus the bear scenes were a bit on the loud side. The second time she watched it, I actually heard her laugh at a few scenes and found it less shocking so she enjoyed it more.
B008XOXGCO|4.0|While they may not be one of the best groups in music, they are surely one of the most original. Since their sophomore release this trio from Ireland has grown on me and with '#3', they have become a regular in my listening cycle. Their blend of harmonies and rap along with their one of a kind lyrical capabilities makes '#3'one of the most unique albums of 2012. As a person who was not the biggest fan of their debut, I am now tempted to give it another listen. No two songs on this album sound the same. The meaning of each song is different. Each one puts you in a different mood. Some are sing-a-longs and some are just great listens. One thing is for sure, The Script is now going to be one of those bands that will stand the test of time. While they may not be in the limelight on a constant basis, they will keep putting out records and remain a household name among the fan base. '#3' is a great album, and it is definitely worth a listen if anything.
B008NB0SQO|3.0|I have the VHS version of this movie and it is my personal favorite!! I just watched my newly purchased Blu-ray copy and was highly upset by the fact that they cut the song &#34;When Love is Gone&#34; from the Blu-ray! Why in the world would they do this??!!!!!!! I would never have bought it had I known this!!!! I want my money back and I will go back to my VHS version.<br />Not a happy customer!
B008G59IKO|4.0|I think it is safe to say that old school sound I have been craving. Well, I am not getting that from this new Green Day trilogy.<br /><br />'Dos' is a good listen, don't get me wrong. It is definitely a Green Day album, just not that Green Day that introduced themselves to us in the early 1990s. 'Dos' can be called an innovative album because while that old Green Day sound may not be there, the old early punk sounds of the early 1960s are there. There even some very small links to the Green Day of old in the songs 'Ashley', 'Baby Eyes' & 'Lady Cobra', as a whole...energetic and fun. 'Nightlife'on the other hand, probably the worst song they ever recorded. Trying to put hip-hop in a Green Day record is like trying to put vinegar in a hot fudge sundae...it doesn't work!<br /><br />This album is still keeping my Green Day fandom very much alive. The fact that they pulled away from the whole rock opera motif was a positive thing. I am curious what 'Tre' will be giving us, even more so because instead of January this album is being released a month early. So, for now enjoy this new Green Day album.
B008Y1YJZY|5.0|I thought this was a really cute movie! I loved the plot and the heart of Arthur. Glad to now have it in our Christmas video collection.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|while it can seem repetative at times there is enough variation in recipes and types of cooking implements to make it refreshing.  it is as close to the casual facebook social games as I have seen on a mobile device.
034580404X|5.0|I loved these books so much, more than I expected to.  I'm obsessed with Ana and Christian!  For adults only though!!!
B005LAIIHG|5.0|I usually don't review movies.  I stick to books.  However, with The Life of Pi, I am choosing to make an exception.  It is so darn good and so close to the book that I feel it deserves a review that reflects how wonderful it is.<br /><br />The Life of Pi is about and adult man named Pi who has a visitor in Canada who has met his uncle in India.  His uncle told the visitor that after speaking to Pi, he will believe in God.  Pi has a story to tell and he chooses to tell the story to the visitor who has the time to listen.<br /><br />Years ago, Pi's parents owned a zoo in India that started going bankrupt.  They decided to sell the zoo but take the animals to Canada and perhaps make a fresh start there.  The animals and Pi's family are loaded on a cheap ship like a poor man's Noah's Ark.  The animals are all tranquilized and kept in the basement of the ship so they won't get seasick.  A storm occurs and Pi and everyone else on the ship go overboard.  Pi finds himself on a lifeboat with a tiger named Richard Parker, a post-natal orangutang, and an injured zebra.  Together they start a stupendous journey through the Pacific waters.<br /><br />Most of the movie's renderings of Richard Parker were done by computer graphics and it's a mighty fine job they did.  We see how Pi and Richard Parker vie for space on the tiny boat and how, daily, Pi fears for his life as a tiger's meal.<br /><br />The movies has some strong philosophical and theological issues that play out beautifully and it is one of the best movies I have seen in a very long time.  I am very impressed at how close the movie is to the book.  Usually, I get very annoyed because movies and the books they are made from have very little in common.  Not so with The Life of Pi.  It is a beautiful book, a beautiful movie, and the two mesh together as one.<br /><br />I recommend that everyone see this movie.  I saw it in 3-D and that was quite an experience.  However, I get migraines and the 3-D was a bit overboard (no pun intended) for me.  Someone told me that the actor who played the young Pacine had never acted before.  If so, he is a natural, and a wonder to boot.<br /><br />There isn't a spare word in the movie, nor a spare scene.  It is beautiful, thoughtful, and we finish the movie asking ourselves whether God exists.pun intended) for me.  Someone told me that the actor who played the young Pacine had never acted before.

B009WO7NQO|4.0|My son (10) loves it, except the fact that you only get 2 worlds and have to buy the rest. Otherwise he says it's a great game with lots of characters.
B00008438V|5.0|This is a great DVD great picture and sound, just as described brand new will recommend to anyone. Great purchase
B0038VPB5W|4.0|The music is great, some of there best by far. It's a good album for first timers. Veteran BFMV fans will love it also.
B008FWHGYS|5.0|Good Movie. I knew if Anthony Hopkins is playing it must be good. It is a good story line. Deff. recommend to watch.
B000LXHK22|5.0|It is a very well made film with a good message for all who view it....Life really is too short and we all need to slow down and enjoy it...
B009HV2JT8|5.0|The thing that really bothers me about most films is their lack of continuity, especially after they have completed the final cut.  Well, this one has continuity.  Movies are rarely always loved or hated by everyone.  There always seems to be some saving grace in the films that have been panned by the critics and things that fall short in even Oscar winners. It is personal taste.  This film has a lot of emotional aspects to satisfy the \\"chick flick fans\\" and an abundance of action to satisfy  \\"horror and gore\\" fans.  I enjoyed it and didn't fall asleep once.  I won't continue or reflect on the special effects, costumes, sound or photographic results, this has already been covered by previous reviewers.  When in doubt see it for yourself.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|Super graphics, good sound, lotes of challanges. Getting bonuses and star fighters is really cool. not sure how the bonus planets works but I'll figure it out.<br />jim
B007918P1E|5.0|Beautiful album with great performance!<br />My favorite on this one is &#34;storm the sorrow&#34;.<br />I think I did a good purchase, really pleased!
B000HF0ILY|3.0|IT HAD CAPTIONS AND I DIDN'T WANT THAT TYPE OF DVD. BUT IT'S MY FAULT, I DIDN'T READ THE COPY WHEN I ORDERED IT.
B000VCDJQY|5.0|Amazing vocals, seems to prove that although is a metal group the singer actually can sing. And of what range!!!<br />Love every single song.
B00632HWOG|5.0|Love this Yahoo app.  Very easy to use, very cool.  Let's you edit your emails, like deleting them or saving them to a folder.  Try it , you'll like it.
B002RCEBBI|5.0|Meaningful lyrics paired with musical extravagance, what makes easier to digest the seriousity of the message.<br />The&#34; tides of time&#34; is simply a masterpiece!
0374214913|3.0|A co-worker loaned me her copy of this book after telling me a bit about it. \\"It sounds... whimsical,\\" I said. I don't really do whimsical but decided to try it. It's very much the product of growing up in the 80s and 90s and embracing the technology of the 21st century. It references all things nerd: Star Wars, Star Trek, Harry Potter, Dungeons & Dragons, every cliché fantasy book ever written, videogames, webcomics, and possibly even the TV show Warehouse 13.<br /><br />At first I thought it would be a heart-warming tale about how a young man uses technology to help save a faltering bookstore. No, not quite. There's a mysterious ancient cult, a bit of romance, and a real world D&D quest of sorts. A sense of danger to heighten the mystery is lacking though. There are no dead bodies or self-flagellating albinos here. It's not bad but it's rather bland and probably best understood by someone who appreciates computers, history, nerdy references, and graphic design.<br /><br />It's a story where fact and fiction are woven tightly enough that I found myself googling a name or a technology every 5 seconds to see if it really exists (Ruby, Hadoop, Aldus Manutius, and Mechanical Turk do; Griffo Gerritszoon and his ubiquitous font do not). Google features so prominently that I originally thought Mr. Sloan either worked for them (he doesn't) or was writing them an open love letter. But he seems to be poking fun at Google and the youthful mentality that a fast enough computer can solve anything - even the issue of immortality.<br /><br />Assembled is a cast of charmingly eccentric 2-dimensional characters that remain static throughout the entire book. Kat Potente, introduced as the love interest, is intelligent, beautiful, and works for Google naturally. I tried to like her but she ends up displaying the immaturity of a moody teenager. There was an opportunity for growth there and it was wasted.<br /><br />Written in first person, the book flows easily enough with a humoroustone. I didn't mind living in Clay Jannon's head even if he suffers from the inability to communicate with the fairer sex (a weakness all fictional nerds have apparently). While the novel explores how books and technology intersect, there's nothing really earth shattering here unless you've never heard of OCR or print-on-demand. It's a decent effort though.
B009WO7NQO|4.0|The game is great fun to play. But I was a little disappointed to see that you have to pay extra to play The Path of the Jedi section. I believe that this should be included in the purchase of the game.
B009Y6V7XK|5.0|another in a long list of excellent music from these guys. they never fail to reach in and pull your guts out!
B009NQKXYK|2.0|Another Alien movie.  Ugh  Same old story.  Monstor saves Mother.  Would definitely NOT recommend.  Boring, uninteresting and just a rip off.
B0051ANPZQ|4.0|I enjoyed this book and decided to read it aloud to my sixth graders.  They are now halfway through and are getting a lot out of it.  There's at least one teachable moment in every chapter if you are reading this book with your child or your students.  It's not the best young adult literature I've ever read, which is why I couldn't give it five stars, but the story line is great.  It's very easy to identify with the characters and the plot moves along quickly enough to keep you interested.<br />I've taught several kids over the years who look a little bit different due to their physical disabilities, including one boy with a craniofacial abnormality similar to the main character in this book, and I have two adopted daughters who have purely physical disabilities that people often mistake for cognitive disabilities, so I can identify with Auggie's struggles.  I think the author captures things fairly well, and at the very least, you will have a broader perspective after reading this book.
B0036EDVS0|4.0|VERY good movie.  Love Johnny Depp.  My only problem was the background music drowned out the dialogue.  But, would definitely recommend.
0671004107|5.0|What a great read! I have become quite the fan of Carl Sagan after reading this book. It was a required read for a Astronomy course I am taking - initially I was a little taken back that the professor would require a science fiction novel to be read for the class, but upon finishing &#34;Contact&#34; I understood why.<br /><br />Carl Sagan ingeniously incorporates real science and an honest opinion about the unexplored frontiers of space with a very beautiful, artistic view of our real world, and real emotions that we deal with every day.<br /><br />One of the best books I have read in a while. I immediately sent it to a friend to read and he loves it too.
B002UXRGM0|5.0|Amazing visuals, amazing narrator, amazing location, amazing occurrences, amazingly amazing amazingness of awesome. Everything about these series is really mind-blowing.
B0096PAA6E|3.0|It is magic when I find an album that I can listen through every track from start to finish, sadly Blak and Blu is not one of these albums. And I think the worst past is that I was undoubtedly expecting it to be.<br /><br />There are some real gems on here - the 3 minute solo on this album's version of &#34;When My Train Pulls In&#34; is the highlight for me. &#34;Numb&#34; is another fantastic gritty blues song. Even when he gets a little soulful with some of the softer tracks like &#34;Please Come Home&#34; and &#34;Things Are Changing&#34;, I can dig what he is doing with a little diversity.<br /><br />But he takes it a little far with a couple of cliche pop tracks that could easily be covered by a teeny bopper - such as &#34;The Life&#34;. A Generic sound and cheesy lyrics about the LA party scene - none of that dirt and grit honesty that really makes Gary Clark Jr. the artist I have loved.<br /><br />And I really tried to love this album. Perhaps it just isn't my taste. But even if you enjoy all of the songs on here, it isn't very cohesive. It isn't an album you pop into the CD player when you want to drown yourself in a single raw emotion. It isn't all blues, it isn't all grit - it is just a grab bag of various sounds.<br /><br />I am still a big fan of Mr. Gary Clark Jr. And this album will still get quite a bit of play time in my car, but it isn't what I expected. And I will probably never listen to it from start to finish - which is hands down my favorite part about a great album.
B00A3AYI50|5.0|I followed Phillip from the beginning of American Idol, hoping he would win, but not believing he would.  I'm thrilled his first album is so good and I hope he has continued success.  I love this album and look forward to the next one by Phillip.
B007K3JFUQ|5.0|The movie was in as good a condition as advertised. Arrived on time and in great condition. This movie picked up and carried on the same quality as you saw in the first movie.
B000W4KT64|5.0|This is such a fun musical.  Everyone is perfectly cast.  A joy to watch no matter how many times I've seen it.
B00913DPW2|5.0|I loved this game. Kept me going for hours and kept me wanting more.  Very challenging.  Great for those whonlove thinking games. I admittedly had to use the walkthrough for a few things but mostly was able to dononnmy own. Great game.
B009HQ9UHC|3.0|Not as good as Angry Birds. Kind of boring.  Has a bad set up for the game. It is okay, but I am not thrilled with it
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Filmed in ga. Has the best actor. It's the best. I am never disappointed with the walking dead! Cliff hanger after every show!
125000568X|5.0|Like Tina Tuner: Queen: simply the best. I recommend it. Enjoy your  Q U E E N B O O K.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I love this app.  I was searching on Amazon for a sleep machine and came across this for Kindle.  FREE!  The sleep machines that I wanted were $50 and up.  This is great and I love to mix sounds.  My fave is storm and cavern!  I highly recommend!
B00917IQFY|5.0|GP is back and in amazing form. While the band looks old, they sound great! The album I have been waiting for! Can't wait to see them live and in the apatow movie.  You can't argue with big sounding songs three chords good, arlington's busy, snake oil capital, long emotional ride and coathangers.  He may not have had implants and go to the gym as much as Bruce, but he's back and it's awesome.
B000VBJEEG|5.0|Amazing how you can just purchase this and within seconds you are able to watch it,love it fast and easy
B009NPA3Q4|4.0|Phillip Phillips' first full-length CD for Interscope after his big win on American Idol 11th Season is a strong outing.  With nine of the 12 songs co-written by Phillips, it is also highlights Phillip as a songwriter.  His single \\"Home\\" that was on his American Idol EP and was featured on the Olympics telecast is the second track, sounding as fresh as it did when we first heard it.  \\"Gone Gone Gone\\" is a very catchy track with Phillips' trademark wail powering a super lyric, \\"You're my backbone; You're my cornerstone; You're my crutch when my legs stop movin'; You're my head start; You're my rugged heart; You're the pulse that I've always needed; Like a drum, baby don't stop beatin'.\\"  \\"Get Up Get Down\\" is another catchy track with a punchy drum track by Gunnar Olsen driving the rhythm.  When I played this CD in the car, my daughter said, \\"Is that Dave Matthews?\\"  It's a comparison frequently made with Phillips' music.  I hear it on the track \\"Drive Me\\" with his rock vocals strong and Fred Williams' saxophone giving a classic feel to song, \\"Like a moth, I cannot be turned away, Lead me, Take me, Far from here sweetly.\\" Other tracks like the opener \\"Man on the Moon,\\" \\"Tell Me A Story\\" and \\"Can't Go Wrong\\" are also gems.  This is a strong freshman effort from this powerful singer.  Enjoy!
B003QSMC18|5.0|my daughter love seen this movie on line, she love so much that we purchase it ,it was fast and easy
B008NW67E0|4.0|After five spins, I've gone through a journey with Babel.  \\"Sigh No More\\" was so utterly stunning that by the second CD, the formula becomes more familiar.  However, this set also offers its share of gems.  \\"I Will Wait\\" delights with its confident promise of romantic loyalty, \\"Raise my hands, paint my spirit gold, bow my head, keep my heart slow.\\"  \\"Hopeless Wanderer\\" is another gem that starts soft and bursts into a pounding anthem about two minutes into the track, \\"So when your hope's on fire, but you know your desire, don't hold a glass over the flame; Don't let your heart grow cold; I will call you by name; I will share your road.\\"  On this deluxe edition, the Sons' version of Simon & Garfunkel's \\"The Boxer\\" fits their style like a glove on the \\"lye la lye\\" chorus.  \\"Babel,\\" while not as strong as the amazing first CD, is still well worth discovering.  Enjoy!
B000M5NRLC|5.0|Amazing how you can just purchase this and within seconds you are able to watch it,love it fast and easy
B008458O3S|5.0|This is fun little game.  Entertaining in a mindless sort of way, with enough challenge to keep it interesting. Worth a look.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|Our heroine is so enduring, I kept wanting to hand her a hair brush and tell her that she would make any mother proud.
B009NOVCTM|5.0|i have been playing this in the car.....blasting away....what isnt to like about the stones...im glad that i ordered it.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Works as well as getting the Weather Channel on my PC or TV.  Easy to go to other than home locations too!!
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|Great for the holidays and something a little different than your standard Christmas merchandising tie-ins.  Excellent quality picture and sound on the DVD, blu-ray or 3D blu-ray.
B00A6PD9I4|4.0|I wont give away plot, but Disney took one joke and repeated it.  Good story.  But not enough twists or scrats!
B007TK77QE|4.0|An extraordinary novel showing the true genius of J K Rowling. A courageous attempt to depict the damaging effect of the deep seated divisions that still exist in British society. Even more remarkable that it should have been written by the most successful and richest British author.
B009JZPH32|4.0|I enjoyed this movie, but it could have been better. I'd give it 3 1/2 stars if I could, so I rounded up. The plot was solid and all of the actors were great, but it was missing the wow factor to make it great. Either way, still worth the rental!
B0077ZNCE2|5.0|Good romantic movie.  I also really like the CGI.  When the guy turns into a wolf, is amazing graphics<br />thanks
B008673ZAQ|5.0|After reading the 50 Shades of Gray series, I was a little upset with this series being a copy-cat.  But this book turned it around for me.  I highly recommend it and can't wait to read the final book in the series!
B00A6PD8RQ|2.0|I'd give the movie a 3.5.  I give the Amazon streaming service, with the recurring stalls and re-starts, a 1.5.
B000YHG72E|5.0|Very family friendly ! Great Christmas movie tradition! Great for all ages ! Price good too ! Make it part of your family
B00A4GXJD0|4.0|Kid Rock is one of my favorite artists.  I honestly came late to the game but I like his blend of rock, soul, and country sounds.  If you enjoy that mix of sounds you will enjoy this record.  It does not disappoint.<br /><br />As for all of the political comment in these reviews kid rock doesn't exactly hide where he stands on issues.  If you have a problem with his stance just don't buy the record if you are that closed minded.  Personally, I listen to plenty of artists that are on many different sides of plenty of social issues.  If you are that closed minded that you can't handle someone challenging your view point maybe you shouldn't be part of the conversation because its not much of a conversation when you are so threatened by someone who doesn't share you view that you descend in to bigotry.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|I like the bright colors and the classic looking tiles.  Towards the end of the game when I got stumped the tiles were rearranged and I was able to finish quickly.  Lots of fun for visual people or people who need to imprrove their visual acuity.<br />Kabuki style sounds when a match is made add to the satisfaction of making a good move.
B007SGM084|5.0|Its my second time reading this trilogy bundle and I could not put it down.  Its a must buy and a great trilogy  to share with your girl friends and your special lover!
B009KS4XRO|4.0|The app drags a little bit but over all I enjoy playing this game, so I will deal with it until you get the bugs fixed
B007FEFLTO|4.0|Heavy duty material. Very believable and apparently well researched. The way the characters were intertwined was very interesting, but ultimately became predictable. Great follow up to Book One.<br />While the plot was well done, the way the author presented the reaction of the principle characters to their various government actions was the highlight. Most of them were decent people trying to get by, somewhat swept along by events - the way the majority of people in Nazi Germany, Communist Russia, and the other countries of the time probably were.<br />Very interesting reading, but a bit depressing at times, as the worst side of society came to the surface.
B009HEMW4W|3.0|there are moments where it is really good but too much time goes by in between them. the plot was not amazing. the actors save it a bit.
B009HQ9UHC|4.0|Makes you think, the little vehicles you have to build make the game fun! Little kids might have a harder time with this compared to angry birds .
B004GBIE3Y|4.0|Grab a teen and watch it with them if you've got one around.<br /><br />Saw it awhile ago, wasn't that impressed. Teenaged Daughter wanted to watch it, so I sat with her and enjoyed it more this time.<br /><br />Thought provoking, and a conversation starter.
B004FP1WX0|5.0|I first saw this film about a year ago and have watched it at least six times since then with different friends and family members. I never tell them the plot because it is so cool experiencing the confusion along with Nev, Rel and Henry and trying to figure out what is really going on!<br />Catfish is such a fascinating account of human deception and the lengths we go to to live a lie.  While it is entertaining to watch, it also starts important conversations after the film is done.  A little lie always has to be covered up by dozens of other little lies and sometimes, as in the case of Angela, your whole life becomes a lie. Even when she is caught, she continues to lie (knowing the woman in the pictures, she has cancer, etc.)<br />If the film had ended with Nev storming away, swearing he would never talk to Angela again and calling her all sorts of expletives, I would not recommend the film, even with all the interesting plot twists that had transpired before the reveal.  However, the film has a strong theme of reconciliation and change at the end.  Angela stops pretending to be someone she is not.  She and Nev remain friends.  This story has a redemptive ending and is well worth the watch!
B000VIPJKM|5.0|Once in a while I have a teenaged girl that I feel the need to share this movie with. I love that it pushes the girls-need-to-stick-together theme, and I love Jennifer Coolidge. If it has to be wrapped in pink glitter to get it though to some people, I can handle that.
B00A14SQBU|2.0|It just does not seem as good as some other music I still really like old fashioned Jazz music like  louis armstrong billie holiday etc
B00110K62U|5.0|An excellent extrapolation of the novel to the stage--at least as much as that can be done.  The novel, itself, is--in my opinion-- beyond filming or staging.
B004JK61K0|5.0|This app solved my email interface problems.  It works reliably, quickly, and accurately.  And it's got a very cool icon.
B008B1VYP0|4.0|Wish this had the radio version of Payphone for my kid but this album is classic, poppy Maroon 5. If you're a fan, it's right in your wheelhouse.
B006FO3ERQ|4.0|This book tells a very unexpected story with interesting character study and development.  You come away wanting more of the story as you are left scratching your head about what happened to several characters.
B009X01C64|5.0|Overall, this is a fine case for the 8.9 inch Fire HD. The overall quality is quite nice - I have other Marware products for my Kindle Touch, and it's good to see that they are continuing to maintain a strong focus on product quality. All the materials feel nice; the stitching is tight and even; there's ample cushioning for tablet protection while maintaining a slim profile; and the elastic strap holds the cover closed in a secure fashion.<br /><br />I also like how Marware packages their products with a minimum of packaging waste but still ensures the product can travel through the mail without being dinged up. The package is also easy to open - no fuss, no muss.<br /><br />I initially had some difficulty getting the Fire into the case. The Fire is held in place using a plastic cradle, but it seemed to be too small. I had to (gasp!) resort to reading the user guide that came with it, and found out I needed to position it in a certain way and then snap it in. When it is properly inserted you'll hear and feel a clear \\"snap\\" at each of the four corners of the tablet. When properly installed the case holds the tablet very securely. I shook it vigorously (over a thick cushion in case it failed) and the Fire stayed put.<br /><br />My main quibble is with the rotation feature. I was really looking forward to this since some apps only run in portrait mode; others only in landscape. While the rotation feature works, it is very stiff - you really have to twist hard to get it to rotate. It's a two-handed operation: one hand to rotate the tablet; the other to hold the case while you're turning.<br /><br />The bottom of the cradle has a tab that fits into a slot on the base of the cover to prop up the tablet. This works in both landscape and portrait modes. There are three tabs so you can adjust the angle.<br /><br />There are cut outs for the power and HDMI ports. I had no problems accessing any of the ports, power button or volume controls while it was in the cover.<br /><br />Since I often end up having to charge the Fire while it is in use, I rotated the screen so the power plug is at the top. That allows me to keep the tablet propped up on my desk in landscape mode for video watching, but still use the power cord.<br /><br />It also offers an auto on/off ability - the Fire turns off when you close the cover, and wakes up when you open the cover. It's a nice feature and it works well.<br /><br />It has a slot on the cover so you can fit your hand into it for ease of holding it. That has value, but what I would have preferred to have instead (or in addition to) is a pocket on either the inside or the outside to hold items such as a cleaning cloth. This is not a huge problem, but I'll certainly miss that since the case for my original Fire has a outside pouch that is great for holding a cleaning cloth and a small stylus.<br /><br />I'm going to give this 5 stars, but 4.5 is more accurate given the reluctance of the rotation feature. But, since it does everything else very well, looks good, and feels nice, it's closer to a 5 rating than a 4./>Since I often end up having to charge the Fire while it is in use, I rotated the screen so the power plug is at the top.

0425263916|5.0|Can't wait till the next book!! It's just as good as 50 shades !!! It leaves u wanting to know more
